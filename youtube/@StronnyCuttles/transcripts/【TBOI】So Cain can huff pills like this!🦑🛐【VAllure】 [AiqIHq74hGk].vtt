WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.920
I think the test is in twickels.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.920
Are you there? I'm on? I'm alive?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.920
Woman! Reeling!

00:34.920 --> 00:38.920
Good morning! Good evening! Good afternoon!

00:38.920 --> 00:43.920
I know. I'm a whole six minutes early. What's going on? What's happening?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.920
Isaac's a bit loud. I thought that.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.920
You know what? I actually thought Isaac was a bit loud.

00:50.920 --> 00:55.920
Oh my god, my controller isn't on. Of course it's not. How embarrassing.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.920
I'm going to go into a match because I think the actual game volume is lower.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.920
Of course we get burn in basement. Relax.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.920
Oh my god, wait. I haven't done hardcore angels?

01:10.920 --> 01:14.920
Wow. Terrible.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.920
Who are you and what have you done with mommy? She's never early. I know. She's always fucking late.

01:19.920 --> 01:26.920
Right. Updates. I've got good updates. You're going to like this.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.920
Is Isaac still too loud?

01:31.920 --> 01:35.920
You know what? I'll put it down again. I'll put it down a wee bit more.

01:36.920 --> 01:42.920
So I did a community post where you can submit.

01:42.920 --> 01:49.920
If you didn't know, I did a community post and you can literally tell me what words you want me to say or phrases.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.920
A lot of people have given me phrases which I'm surprised about.

01:53.920 --> 02:01.920
But I'm basically taking screenshots of what you guys are saying

02:01.920 --> 02:06.920
and then I'm going to do like a 60, like a one hour.

02:11.920 --> 02:19.920
The caught fish is never early nor is it too late. It will arrive safely on stream when it meets you.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.920
God, there's how many chicks like unironically watch me. I'm getting asked.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.920
So good girl.

02:30.920 --> 02:39.920
I succeed. Oh, if you want to play along with it. And before I lose this and you guys are like, I'm still doing the run. Smile.

02:39.920 --> 02:46.920
But yeah. If you want that, there's a community post.

02:46.920 --> 02:52.920
I have officially written or sent away all the content

02:52.920 --> 02:56.920
for the ASMR collabs I have with other creators.

02:56.920 --> 03:03.920
Okay. It took me so long to do. I have 11 confirmed ASMR 101 collabs.

03:03.920 --> 03:14.920
And it took me so long to get there. But I've done 11, which means when I've wrapped up, that's 11% of my freaking goals, my objectives.

03:14.920 --> 03:21.920
So if I keep on track, I should be able to do finish my goals within a year because I wanted to do that.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.920
I don't know if I can do the Xbox goal. That seems like a second year goal.

03:25.920 --> 03:34.920
I'm going to be so happy because she woke up. I am God's EPS soldier right now.

03:34.920 --> 03:43.920
But yes, I did that. I took a look into doing the clipping program.

03:43.920 --> 03:54.920
So if you're an established clipping channel, it looks like we can basically match Idol End's offer, which is a dollar a pair of 1000 views.

03:54.920 --> 04:01.920
A pair accepted clip channel. So that will be something that comes out in August.

04:01.920 --> 04:10.920
The video game for a viewer is definitely looking like August, sadly.

04:10.920 --> 04:19.920
I fucked up my artwork. I'm really upset, but I've kind of... I've done it now. I've made a mistake. I've learned from my mistakes.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.920
So if Gen 2 and 3, if and when, do come out with a video game, they're going to be correct.

04:25.920 --> 04:32.920
I'm very lucky that I fucked up on my specific artwork and not someone else's specific artwork.

04:32.920 --> 04:39.920
Aces is fine, Emmys is fine, Azuras is fine, Merces is fine, Shibys is fine. It's mine I fucked up on.

04:39.920 --> 04:46.920
So I'm really glad it was mine because mistakes were made, things were learned along the way.

04:46.920 --> 04:54.920
But next time when it comes to animated alternative art, it's much wiser to just go to the person

04:54.920 --> 05:01.920
that draws and animates it, not get it drawn elsewhere and then animated by someone else

05:01.920 --> 05:10.920
because that's how things get messed up and my section is supposed to be banal,

05:10.920 --> 05:17.920
but instead it's turned into hot dogging, but the audio I recorded is for banal and I don't know what to do.

05:18.920 --> 05:28.920
I think I'm going to leave my original audio type in, but unfortunately the artwork doesn't match the section correctly.

05:28.920 --> 05:35.920
So yeah, that's my update about my section in the video game.

05:35.920 --> 05:44.920
But look, mistakes happen and I will say, I have learned so much and I'm so happy that I could even learn...

05:44.920 --> 05:49.920
I can even learn to commission a video game, I know it sounds silly but...

05:58.920 --> 06:01.920
But yeah, is there a scene where it works properly?

06:01.920 --> 06:12.920
So yes, everyone has an animated scene, but my type is banal but the animation is hot dogging

06:12.920 --> 06:15.920
because that was a mistake on my part.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.920
The animator didn't know that he was supposed to make it disappear.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.920
Hocus pocus.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.920
But anyway, I messed up, but look, lessons learned, things have happened.

06:31.920 --> 06:38.920
I had a cute night with my dad, he wanted to watch me play meccosal and I was like, oh god, oh god.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.920
Because I was like, what did I see in the stream?

06:40.920 --> 06:44.920
But we actually did see him watch it and it wasn't that bad.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.920
I honestly wasn't that bad that stream, I could have been way worse.

06:48.920 --> 06:54.920
But he was like, oh my god, I remember all that and I'm like, oh yeah.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.920
I showed him, he was freaking laughing at me.

06:58.920 --> 07:05.920
I showed him the map where he watched the meccosal, we watched it together, we didn't watch Star Trek last night.

07:05.920 --> 07:11.920
And he did what?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.920
Oh excuse me, how are we on today?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.920
Pardon me, boys.

07:16.920 --> 07:23.920
I was like, I don't know if you just remember the snow map where you had to blow up the generator

07:23.920 --> 07:27.920
and then all the friend Lee's turn hostile because you were actually hidden.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.920
And I was trying to blow up the bridge and he was like, oh, that weapon's not going to do anything against that bridge.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.920
And I'm like, how am I supposed to know that?

07:36.920 --> 07:38.920
I'm going to make, it's giving me missiles.

07:38.920 --> 07:45.920
Of course I'm going to use the freaking missiles and he's like laughing at my terrible freaking thingy.

07:45.920 --> 07:50.920
And I was panicking and he was like, you know what, you actually are a wee bit entertaining.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.920
I'm like, excuse you, I'm a bit entertaining.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.920
Like give me some credit because he was like, oh that was actually kind of funny.

07:59.920 --> 08:06.920
And I was like, yeah, so like if a dad calling you, literally call me a noob and I'm like, excuse you.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.920
I was like, not even, I probably couldn't even speak when I first consumed the game.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.920
Like, yeah, just to be that, right?

08:16.920 --> 08:21.920
Because we were talking about content creators in general because I showed them more of the VTubers

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
and I showed them what the girls were doing, what I do.

08:23.920 --> 08:29.920
And I said like, if you play a game that a refund really enjoys, like it's more entertaining.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.920
Like it has so much more factor because if I had to watch a streamer play Viva Punyatta

08:34.920 --> 08:41.920
or play, you know, Hell Divers 2, well I have a nostalgic bonus when it comes to Viva Punyatta.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.920
Shame my daughter is a noob. I am forsaken. Why am I forsaken?

08:47.920 --> 08:52.920
But he wants to play the game so I think my PC is getting stolen after this stream.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.920
But it was fantastic.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.920
Yes, I do apologize to anyone who is looking forward to the ASMR.

08:59.920 --> 09:04.920
This is where the bad announcements begin.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.920
We hate you, strongy, bad announcements.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.920
I cannot do ASMR for three weeks.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
Nor can I do any type of membership stream for three weeks.

09:14.920 --> 09:24.920
However, as always, I will make it up instantly when my me pops goes away way again.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.920
So today's ASMR has been swapped out.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.920
But yes, there will be no ASMR plans for three weeks, there will be no thingy.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.920
However, my gen mates are always doing ASMR.

09:35.920 --> 09:42.920
Mercy did a fantastic ASMR stream yesterday called You Are My Pet POV.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.920
Anarch, you're so stinky.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.920
Boo. Thank you for the tip, Anarch.

09:49.920 --> 09:54.920
Literally, this is the boooove ones. You suck, strong, boo.

09:54.920 --> 10:00.920
Okay, for the updates on everyone's Patreon, today everyone's Patreon will have at least one audio out.

10:00.920 --> 10:06.920
There is a bit of a...

10:06.920 --> 10:11.920
Try to phrase it nicely so it doesn't sound like an arsehole, but I do want to explain the situation.

10:11.920 --> 10:18.920
There is a bit of a traffic jam, if you will, in production because some talents got a bit distracted

10:18.920 --> 10:21.920
and forgot they had to record on top of streaming.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.920
And it caused a bit of a traffic jam.

10:24.920 --> 10:31.920
So today, by the end of today, this stream, I will be editing for myself in Azura.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.920
There should be a Mercy and a AC.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.920
And Shibi and Emi should already have uploads because they are done.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.920
Okay, I have it.

10:42.920 --> 10:48.920
Literally, the girls got a wee bit carried away and I was like, hey guys, remember that time we did Patreon

10:48.920 --> 10:50.920
and it's like your main source of income.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.920
Please, please, it takes 15 minutes.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
15 minutes, please record.

10:55.920 --> 11:01.920
So it's a bit of a traffic jam, but it should be resolved by the end of this week.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
So, yeah.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
Understandable games are...

11:03.920 --> 11:06.920
Yes, thank you for no one being annoyed at them.

11:06.920 --> 11:12.920
But yes, at the end of the day, I will ensure that there is an audio for everyone at least one up.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.920
And level up.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.920
Okay.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.920
And then take 15 minutes forever later.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.920
Ah.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.920
I love them.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.920
I'm like, girls, please.

11:26.920 --> 11:32.920
Now, they're still in my batch of scripts and I know my batch of scripts takes 15 minutes to record and you know more.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.920
And I'm like, come on, baby girls, come on.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.920
I'm like rubbing the lamp.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.920
I'm like, come on, genie, you come, you come.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.920
I'm like begging them, please, please, I want my knees.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.920
But yes.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
Thank you for your patience.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.920
Apologies for the wait.

11:47.920 --> 11:53.920
But again, after today, at least one will be up and then it will smooth out and be like,

11:53.920 --> 11:56.920
there's two out by the 14.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
Roughly.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.920
I can't remember what everyone's upload date is, to be honest.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
It's all over the shop.

12:01.920 --> 12:07.920
But next month, I plan on having dates along with their schedules.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.920
You know how they posted that funny haha schedule?

12:10.920 --> 12:12.920
That...

12:12.920 --> 12:15.920
Oh, it's not an ASMR stream.

12:15.920 --> 12:16.920
My apologies.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.920
No, I can't do ASMR for three weeks.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.920
My gen mates at any point are doing ASMR.

12:20.920 --> 12:26.920
Emmy is doing ASMR this week when she returns.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.920
She's actually done a membership script writing.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.920
We lurking to be like, hmm, is this how you write scripts?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.920
I mean, this is how I write scripts.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.920
I mean, it's just pure paper.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
Pure paper.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.920
Okay, I'm a...

12:38.920 --> 12:39.920
You can always rub my lamp instead.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.920
Go over here.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.920
I'm going to slurp my tea, okay?

12:43.920 --> 12:45.920
And then we'll get into a cane.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.920
So you can actually see cane stats to the left.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.920
He has 1.3 movement speed, which is fantastic.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
And his damage is a bit harder.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.920
That 4.2 damage.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
Not bad, believe it.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.920
And he has 1% luck.

12:58.920 --> 13:03.920
So luck doesn't affect things like the Gambo machines.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.920
What it affects is drop rate.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.920
So we have an item, that little foot you see on my stuff.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
We have a little item called Lucky Foot,

13:12.920 --> 13:16.920
which means one, our luck is added by one.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.920
And two, it means we can huff pills,

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
and they will be positive.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.920
Now, there is a few pills that are positive in quotation marks

13:25.920 --> 13:26.920
that aren't really.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.920
An example of that is One Makes You Vigor.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.920
It increases your hitbox, but it's considered a good pill.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.920
But it means you can't lose stats via pills, basically.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.920
Hi, Strawny.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.920
With her father-in-law, I'm guessing there won't be a new

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
Patreon recording session.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.920
I've already recorded my three audios.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.920
I need to edit the script for the fourth that we wrote together.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.920
And then, that's all for this month.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.920
So don't worry, my Patreon.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
I'm a smart bean.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.920
I did a few things in advance,

14:01.920 --> 14:04.920
because I knew how much of a numpty I was going to be, okay?

14:04.920 --> 14:07.920
It also affects some item ability proc rates.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.920
Yes, that too.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.920
That is a very big note.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.920
If you see in the bottom left,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.920
it looks like I have a little paper clip in the corner.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.920
I can open gold chests for free.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
I do not require a key.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.920
Three One Makes You Vigor should give you a transformation, though.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
Yeah.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
It's just that amazing.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.920
Yeah, I knew I had to spam ahead, if you will.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.920
Right, I'm slurping my tea.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.920
The tea has been slurped.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.920
Wow, Cain was built for a looting.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.920
Yeah, so we're not playing Tainted Cain.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.920
Tainted Cain has this thing called Loot Bag,

14:48.920 --> 14:51.920
where you can take eight items.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Isaac's still a bit loud.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.920
Goddamn, Isaac, calm down.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.920
I was really, actually,

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
that was one thing about the Microsoft stream.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.920
My dad was like, wait, you didn't test the audio.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.920
And I'm like, fucking stop annihilating me.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
Oh my gosh, not all streamers are perfect.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.920
I was getting absolutely roasted by my dad on my stream,

15:11.920 --> 15:14.920
and I'm like, I've already told him how much I made in my first month.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.920
I'm going to let it be a surprise when the short comes out

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
how much I made in my first month,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
but I was like, I'm fucking annihilated.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
I'm like, back off.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
Get off me.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
What's up?

15:24.920 --> 15:25.920
Hi, Stranny.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
Hi, everyone.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
Are you excited?

15:27.920 --> 15:28.920
Immers is coming back.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
Your dad's a pro stream critic.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.920
You're perfect roasted by dad.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
Everything is shining.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.920
Did he get shocked when the helicopter scene showed the audio peak?

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
Well, he was...

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
So we were at the waterfall,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.920
and he was reading chat.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
He was reading you guys,

15:42.920 --> 15:45.920
and he was like, oh, they're really nice to you.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.920
Because you play so badly.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.920
I was like, all right, dad.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.920
Fuck's sake, man.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
But I was like, yeah.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.920
So that's what chat is considered about.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.920
I was like saying that.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.920
I got asked reflins, but people say chat.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
And he's lurking.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
Literally, he was reading you.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.920
And he was like, oh, everyone's so nice to you.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.920
And I'm like, yeah.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.920
And he was like...

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
So obviously, I was telling the stories about, like,

16:11.920 --> 16:14.920
my dad used to play multiplayer in the water on Atlas.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
And he was like, oh, you remember, you remember.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.920
And I'm like, yeah, dad, you never stop talking to me about it.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
Every time I bring up, like, Xbox.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.920
Was he expecting us to treat you like an enemy on Xbox Live?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
Oh, well, I was talking about, like,

16:28.920 --> 16:31.920
how Xbox used to have open mic in those games.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
And I was like, oh, people would play music.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
They'd spam the N word down the mic.

16:35.920 --> 16:36.920
All of that.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.920
And he was like, oh, that's right.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
That's right.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
Yeah, yeah.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
And I'm like, yep.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.920
That's because it happened in Call of Duty when I played.

16:43.920 --> 16:49.920
Well, is there a chance Papa Kottos is lurking?

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
Well, he's not reading.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
Right now he's asleep.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
I can hear the walls vibrate, which vibrate.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.920
Vibrate of vibration, which is why we can't do it anymore.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.920
But there is a chance he might watch this and be like,

17:01.920 --> 17:02.920
what did you do today?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
Because he finds it fascinating.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.920
He's like, how did you earn that much money?

17:06.920 --> 17:09.920
And I was like, oh, like, I believe in consistency.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.920
I believe in an exchange of goods and services.

17:12.920 --> 17:17.920
I was like explaining, like, we are being observed.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
Yes.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.920
I was explaining to him, like, the way I like to say thank you

17:22.920 --> 17:25.920
is I like to provide more content.

17:26.920 --> 17:31.920
So I have a disclaimer in my short that says how much I earned.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.920
Basically, it's over 10K.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.920
Because you guys are stupendously supportive.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
But yeah, in my first month of strong calls,

17:40.920 --> 17:43.920
I made over $10,000.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.920
Because you guys are fucking insane.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.920
I also break down the income via Patreon, stream elements,

17:49.920 --> 17:52.920
and what I earned on YouTube.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
Nothing you don't deserve.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.920
I find it hard to accept.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.920
I'm going to be honest.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.920
That is a...

18:00.920 --> 18:03.920
You know how, like, people were like, oh,

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
we need to support her more.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
You give me more than enough.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
We're funding Gen2.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.920
Look, my Donathon is an October 10th.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.920
At this rate, the Donathon end of goal is going to be like

18:17.920 --> 18:21.920
$5,000 Gen2 production confirmed at this rate.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.920
I'm going to be honest.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
You will accept her money and you're going to like it.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.920
Well, at least let me fucking get some ASMR in exchange.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.920
And you were worried about funding Gen2.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.920
Literally, I'm not being funny.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.920
Originally, my Gen2 goal was going to be like

18:38.920 --> 18:41.920
I think $15,000 US was my end goal.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.920
And I would have things all the way.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.920
And at the end, it would be like Gen2 confirmed production.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.920
Motherfucker, I'm going to do it with like $300 at this rate.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.920
VTuber community support.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.920
It's actually insane.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.920
It's genuinely insane.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.920
Some had a year of build up.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.920
I couldn't hold it.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.920
This is terrible.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.920
She said she was supported enough time to support her.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.920
No, seriously.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.920
So I broke down the income, but I had to see a few disclaimers.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.920
My disclaimers, like, I stream every single day.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.920
I can't remember my other ones.

19:20.920 --> 19:21.920
But I did have disclaimers.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.920
And then at the end, I was like,

19:23.920 --> 19:26.920
I remember to hold 30% for tax purposes.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.920
Like, I sounded so depressed at the end.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.920
You deserve it.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.920
You're basically a comfort streamer for all good.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.920
Even with my wee accent.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
Yeah, am I your comfort streamer putting you to sleep?

19:37.920 --> 19:41.920
My only gripe is having to pay 5 or 10% of that taxes to the company.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.920
You beat 10% taxes.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.920
What country do you live in, Luxembourg?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.920
10%?

19:49.920 --> 19:51.920
10%?

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
What the fuck?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
I'm, like, 30%.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.920
Hmm.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.920
Accent's part of why I come back every day.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
You're like that.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
You're like that.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.920
And then, see, that accent is getting you 10K.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.920
I don't think that I'm not being funny.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.920
My Donaldson goal is not going to be 10K at this rate.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.920
Like, the end goal, you know how it's like,

20:12.920 --> 20:14.920
oh, my goal has been achieved.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
Right, here's extended.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.920
No.

20:18.920 --> 20:24.920
I have put in a plushy request for a certain MILF goddess.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.920
Goddess of fertility.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.920
Pardon my French, not MILF.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.920
I have put in a request about a plushy for a bleeding heart.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
So I'm going to see what the response is.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.920
And depending on that, we either do a different business

20:38.920 --> 20:41.920
or see what happens, I don't know.

20:41.920 --> 20:46.920
But I am starting to mildly prepare for Azur's donathon.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.920
Her birthday donathon starts and immediately ends.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
I'm not being funny, but I'm starting to think

20:52.920 --> 20:54.920
that's what's going to happen.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.920
I don't want to predict the future,

20:55.920 --> 21:00.920
but I'm getting nervous for how little the actual end goal is.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.920
It's going to be, like, Gen 2 production confirmed.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.920
$69.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.920
There you go.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.920
When is Azur's birthday?

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
The 21st of August.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.920
Now, I know I'm being a bit pre-emptive,

21:10.920 --> 21:12.920
but a month and a week and two weeks and a...

21:12.920 --> 21:15.920
Just change the goal at Gen 3 while you're at it.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
Honestly, at this rate.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.920
Hmm.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.920
Just add more goals then.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.920
Thankfully, I do have very good stretch goals,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.920
which I think everyone's going to be quite happy with.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.920
I am focusing on more public access things.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.920
Maybe, you know, free.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.920
Actually, that reminds me, I need to edit so much for Twitter.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.920
I'll turn it off.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
And...

21:41.920 --> 21:44.920
And I've got a Bible movement inside me.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.920
Stretch goals.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
Quite literally.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.920
Yeah.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
The rest goes to the shareholders.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.920
Hmm, yes, we have shareholders.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.920
Anyway, done with the high table while we're at it.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.920
Okay, I have hydration.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.920
Hmm.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.920
The community posts in the community-related videos are quite good, yes.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.920
It's my first one doing it.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.920
I was like, I want to do a 60-minute, like, triggers.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.920
So I'm going to take screenshots of the ones that I want to see.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
Now, I don't want anyone being...

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
Having a sorbuti, because I've no peggio for one.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.920
But then you have a sorbuti if I didn't pick the phrase or thing you've asked me.

22:27.920 --> 22:32.920
It's not like it's the only one I'm going to be doing, okay?

22:32.920 --> 22:34.920
Hello, America Hiya!

22:34.920 --> 22:36.920
You're my goal and I want to straight...

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
That's terrible.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.920
She says one of her goals is literally a figurine.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
That's a tentacle.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
Can we be a bit mean with the phrases?

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
Yes, most certainly.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.920
I have absolutely no issues with that.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
Okay, so we are lovely cane.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.920
No, we're not going to do boss rush.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
I'm just going to talk through it.

22:55.920 --> 23:01.920
So you can actually see we have a lucky foot pixel on our right foot.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.920
See how it's like a bit red?

23:04.920 --> 23:07.920
We've got a sacrifice room, which no, we are not messing with.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.920
But there is a chance the fires can drop a cheeky coin for us.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.920
Cane is smooth like butter.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.920
We did pick about one a wee coin.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
You also have the best drink ever.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.920
Good smile collab when steady on.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
I think we need a wee bit more numbers now.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.920
I'm not much of a number whole bag,

23:26.920 --> 23:30.920
but I have to admit when it comes to contacting companies like that,

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
I kind of need the...

23:32.920 --> 23:34.920
Oh God, these blow up.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
Oh no.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.920
Okay, I am not good at Isaac.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.920
So if I could just get Godhead, that would be...

23:42.920 --> 23:44.920
I don't even think I've unlocked Godhead.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.920
You know, there's so many items I've yet to unlock.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.920
But yes, we're just having a chill day on Isaac.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.920
I get to nerd about it because I love it.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.920
And I can't wait to play multiplayer Isaac with you.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.920
See these spiders?

23:58.920 --> 23:59.920
See you.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.920
One shot, yeah.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
Oh, and it unlocks a new spider.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.920
Just to really upset me, yeah.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.920
I am taking damage in unclear room,

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
grants flight,

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
spectral tears,

24:12.920 --> 24:15.920
stops time greatly increases speed and fire rate.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.920
I mean, we have to take damage to activate it,

24:18.920 --> 24:22.920
but I mean, it's better than nothing.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
Okay, we'll grab this.

24:26.920 --> 24:27.920
Godhead.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
Cast the gate that enemies with the Godhead.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
I keep forgetting you can slowly move if you're on a controller.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
Oh yeah, I'm a controller.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
I'm not moving.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
Oh, you didn't see that.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.920
No, that's it.

24:39.920 --> 24:40.920
Wait, why is it so small?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.920
Why can't I make it bigger?

24:42.920 --> 24:44.920
No, I feel like manual...

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
Oh my God.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
No, don't.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.920
This is embarrassing.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
I like...

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
Stop.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
I like accidentally minimized it.

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
It won't let it go big.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
Stop.

24:53.920 --> 24:54.920
That's so embarrassing.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.920
It won't let it go big again.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.920
Get big.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.920
What are you doing?

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
Oh my God.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Right.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
Hold on.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.920
That's actually so embarrassing.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
Okay, that's the best I can do.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
I don't know how I managed that,

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
but what's done is done.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.920
Press F.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.920
Alt return to full...

25:16.920 --> 25:17.920
Alt return.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.920
Stop.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
I'll actually believe you.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.920
But the heck is return?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.920
Return isn't a button on the keyboard.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
Oh my God, it is F.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.920
The reeflings told the truth.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.920
The reeflings loved me.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.920
They didn't tell me to Alt F4.

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
Hold on.

25:32.920 --> 25:33.920
Yay.

25:33.920 --> 25:34.920
Thank you, reefling.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
Who said Alt?

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
Alt owner.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.920
Look at you.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
I actually being nice to you.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.920
What the heck?

25:41.920 --> 25:43.920
See, other streamer communities

25:43.920 --> 25:44.920
would have trolled the fuck.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
I'm like, uh, uh, uh, actually panicking.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.920
Oh, I don't like those guys.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.920
I don't like burning basement.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
Actually, well, I'm at it.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.920
I don't like any enemies in Isaac

25:57.920 --> 25:59.920
because they're all meanie-boo beanies.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
Please don't jump into the fire.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
Because when he jump into the fire,

26:04.920 --> 26:06.920
he gets higher and higher.

26:06.920 --> 26:11.920
Can we get much higher and higher?

26:12.920 --> 26:13.920
Stay.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
No, we don't need that.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
What we got?

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
We got useless.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.920
We don't even have enough for it.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.920
And it's an unidentified film.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.920
Not even Larry Junior?

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
I don't know.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.920
I hate this, the sailors,

26:29.920 --> 26:30.920
because it fills spiders.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.920
Otherwise, other ways for sure.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
But I like that.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
What do you mean?

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
We never billy or troll you forever.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.920
Okay, this isn't actually the worst jewel.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.920
I'm kind of wanting to get rid of the baby guy first

26:41.920 --> 26:43.920
because he's a bit of a headache.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
Oh, it's not going to happen.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
It's not going to happen.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
It's fine.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.920
Watch me get...

26:55.920 --> 26:57.920
Yeah, unfortunately, when he gets untethered,

26:57.920 --> 26:59.920
he has quite interesting physics,

26:59.920 --> 27:02.920
which I don't like going off against.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.920
I don't know, maybe we can just do that.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.920
Are you joking me?

27:08.920 --> 27:10.920
The one thing I didn't want was to go against him.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
Empty heart.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.920
Taking damage as a chance to spawn a red heart.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.920
Okay, hold on.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.920
Now, we could maybe get insanely...

27:22.920 --> 27:24.920
Oh my god, it's a wake-up.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.920
We could maybe get insanely,

27:28.920 --> 27:34.920
insanely lucky on these sacrificial spikes.

27:34.920 --> 27:40.920
Due to old vantage, has a chance to spawn hearts.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
Okay.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.920
Okay, hold on.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
And then we have two hearts back here.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
So you'll notice we pee now at the door.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
When your health is hidden,

27:50.920 --> 27:52.920
that will tell you if you're in trouble or not.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.920
So we're peeing because we have a half a heart.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.920
So we're going to pick up these double hearts here.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.920
Yummy, yummy, juicy, juicy.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
What?

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
Aww.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.920
Why does the message only say faces on screen?

28:08.920 --> 28:09.920
I'll make you change that.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.920
Thank you very much to me, Tim Schottel.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Thank you.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
For your kind tip.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
I appreciate it.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.920
Does that actually mean...

28:19.920 --> 28:20.920
We got a sack?

28:20.920 --> 28:21.920
Oh my gosh.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
Wait, that was actually a really good story.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.920
Oh, and we got a heart back.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.920
Come on, surely we'll get an S tier item.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.920
Literally S tier.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.920
And we got a heart back.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.920
Oh my god, we're actually doing so good.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.920
What do I need to do?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
Do I need to sacrifice that wee guy?

28:45.920 --> 28:46.920
I think so.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.920
I think I'm going to have to sacrifice that heart.

28:50.920 --> 28:51.920
You know that?

28:54.920 --> 28:55.920
Okay, we're not...

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
Oh no, it's behind this.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.920
Oh, I wouldn't have done that had I known.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.920
And seeing Gamble luck, I thought it was going to drop.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.920
I just realized we can probably just...

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
die in this room.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.920
If one of the bombs ricochet...

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
Oh god, get me out, get me out, right.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.920
Safe, safe, safe.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.920
Right, what's the card?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.920
Teleports Isaac to the shop, sure.

29:18.920 --> 29:19.920
Okay, we are going to...

29:19.920 --> 29:21.920
Oh no, we don't have enough health.

29:23.920 --> 29:24.920
Oh, I shouldn't have picked that up.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.920
I could have bought one from the shop.

29:26.920 --> 29:27.920
You know that?

29:27.920 --> 29:29.920
What have I done?

29:30.920 --> 29:31.920
What have I done?

29:32.920 --> 29:33.920
You have to kill me.

29:33.920 --> 29:34.920
I'm going to kill you.

29:34.920 --> 29:35.920
What have I done?

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
You have to kill an angel.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
No, you can actually...

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
There's not a heart in the shop.

29:40.920 --> 29:41.920
Are you serious?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.920
If we do not get Gibbon...

29:48.920 --> 29:50.920
a heart when we stand on the spike,

29:50.920 --> 29:53.920
I don't think we can pick up our reward.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.920
We need a heart to draw.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.920
I literally...

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
Alright, bye.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.920
Are you serious?

30:05.920 --> 30:06.920
We need...

30:06.920 --> 30:08.920
We need a smithereen of a heart.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
We're going to have to actually buy that card in the shop

30:10.920 --> 30:12.920
and hope it's the lover's card,

30:12.920 --> 30:14.920
which gives us two red hearts.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
I have been trolled.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.920
I have been trolled.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.920
The super secret room, maybe.

30:35.920 --> 30:36.920
I mean, we'll pop it.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.920
Oh, I knew the secret room was there.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.920
Alright, hold on.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.920
I'm doing it from this side, though.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.920
Please have something in it for me.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.920
No.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.920
It's just money.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.920
So where's the other room?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
Is it down here?

30:57.920 --> 31:00.920
I thought it might be here or there.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.920
I don't like this map play out.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.920
I hate when the maps...

31:06.920 --> 31:08.920
I mean, it could be an elbow.

31:08.920 --> 31:09.920
Which is here.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.920
We'll only have one bomb left.

31:12.920 --> 31:13.920
Buy the pill.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.920
Maybe it's a full health.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.920
I can't believe we did all the sacrificing for nothing.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
Come on, pill.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.920
Tears up.

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
I mean...

31:29.920 --> 31:30.920
It's alright.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.920
Oh, that's so unlucky.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.920
What shop doesn't have a freaking heart?

31:37.920 --> 31:39.920
And there's no heart that dropped here.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
There could be something behind here.

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
Money.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.920
Not what we wanted.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.920
Super secret room isn't next to any other room.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.920
Yeah, it can be, can't it?

31:54.920 --> 31:55.920
Gamble over.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
I believe in the sack luck.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.920
There'll be nothing inside that we can utilize.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.920
Yeah, a bomb and a key.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.920
That is so unlucky.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.920
Wait, is that actual?

32:09.920 --> 32:12.920
Not me learning that Super Secret Room only has one connected to it.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.920
Well, then it can't be elbow.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.920
It has to be like one of these weird ones here.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
My guess is opposite of the shop.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.920
We're doing it once.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.920
I don't want to waste my bombs.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.920
Well, I've wasted my bomb.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.920
I can't believe that.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.920
We were one away from greatness.

32:30.920 --> 32:31.920
Oh well.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
We tried, we tried.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.920
We can maybe do a bit better on the next floor, okay?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.920
Womp, womp, womp.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.920
Terrible luck.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.920
I should feel ashamed of myself for how terrible that luck was.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.920
Shops, treasure rooms and boss rooms don't count as rooms.

32:48.920 --> 32:49.920
Great grandpa.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.920
Okay, we're just going to pop the hermit then now.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.920
Because normally we do get spawned in.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.920
God, what a trinket now.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.920
Again, there's no healing in here.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.920
The game where it's like, oh god, I really need to not mess up

33:06.920 --> 33:08.920
or this is going to lose my run.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.920
Okay.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.920
Got a bomb back from him.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.920
Okay, hopefully there's something good in this suite.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.920
Oh, there is a chest here we can get into for free.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.920
We just need to sacrifice a bomb for it.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.920
I know, I know you're like, oh, strong eight,

33:30.920 --> 33:32.920
where did you get these MLG skills?

33:32.920 --> 33:34.920
I know, I'm just so good at Isaac.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.920
What do you mean I get super lucky?

33:35.920 --> 33:38.920
And the only reason I win runs is because I get like,

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
I love Spoonbender.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
It's my favorite item.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.920
Because you don't have to aim.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.920
I love Spoonbender.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
We got a cheeky heart.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.920
Let's see what's in here.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.920
Slows down enemies, deals 10 damage.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.920
I mean, it's a fill room damage.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.920
We don't even have an active item.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.920
Right, we're going to pop this.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.920
Is there a tenant rock?

34:06.920 --> 34:09.920
Hey mom, hi broly legend.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
We've got started.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
We're doing...

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
I was actually lucky.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
Okay, now we have tons of keys.

34:17.920 --> 34:18.920
Just like that.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.920
We are playing...

34:20.920 --> 34:22.920
Isaac Kane,

34:22.920 --> 34:24.920
and we can huff pills on Kane.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.920
We love Casting Spills.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.920
I hate...

34:28.920 --> 34:30.920
I hate when the enemies do that.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.920
Sorry.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.920
Someone's getting the boot.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.920
We got two pills though.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.920
Luck.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.920
Experimental HP up.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
See, where were you when we needed you most?

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
Hmm?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
Could have used my ultimate.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.920
Spoon, Bender and Brimstone.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.920
Oh yeah, that's exactly what I like.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.920
Thank you broly legend for the fine.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.920
You missed it, but I was talking about

34:57.920 --> 35:00.920
how supportive the reeflings are

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920
and how my...

35:02.920 --> 35:04.920
God, it's because my luck is so high.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.920
Now we have an increased rate for chest drops,

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
which gives multiple items.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
I don't know if I want to go in there yet.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
What, we got 100% Devil Deal?

35:13.920 --> 35:16.920
I don't know if we're doing Devil Deal.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.920
Phew, you cheeky cheekerton.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
I prefer the Angel Deal

35:22.920 --> 35:24.920
because you don't have to sacrifice anyhow.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.920
Ooh.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.920
Devil's Isaac's Coins.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.920
Ooh, okay, okay, okay.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.920
What was in the shop again? Was it anything of value?

35:34.920 --> 35:36.920
No.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
One luck, double it in that.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
Shops aren't being very kind to me today.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
Brim is the Devil item though.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.920
No, but...

35:47.920 --> 35:49.920
What happens if I got Sacred Heart though?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
Smile.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
Oh come on, don't...

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
I hate these guys when they hide behind rocks.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.920
You know what you're doing, eh?

35:57.920 --> 35:59.920
Yeah, exactly, as soon as I get closer to it.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.920
What does it do?

36:00.920 --> 36:02.920
Freaking jumps closer to the screen.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
That's right.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
That's right.

36:04.920 --> 36:05.920
You're done for.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.920
Get rekt, get rekt.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
I knew it, I knew it.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.920
Probably Isaac's.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
Um...

36:13.920 --> 36:16.920
Another hermit, surprisingly enough.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
Sacred Heart is better.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
Breath of life incoming.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.920
Stop, if that's my first item.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.920
Uh...

36:28.920 --> 36:29.920
Steady on.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.920
Oh god, my analogue stick's kinda...

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
Gonna look funny.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.920
Bomba, no tinted rock.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.920
Get rid of that.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.920
See what you're gonna draw behind you.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.920
Okay, that's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.920
Right, so because there's nothing here,

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
it makes me think, oh no, I can't be here.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.920
What the heck are the secret rooms in this map?

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
Down, straight down.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
Elbow maybe?

36:59.920 --> 37:01.920
And then one here?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.920
Yeah, okay.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.920
We're gonna...

37:08.920 --> 37:11.920
Now you can get pills from...

37:14.920 --> 37:17.920
From the mushrooms, so I think I am gonna

37:17.920 --> 37:19.920
spend some bombs on these.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
Yes, that's what we wanted.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.920
I'm drowsy, no, oh no, I don't...

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
Ah, right, what a waste.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
Draft, draft, double draft, but it's fine.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.920
It's fine, you can't win them all, smile.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.920
Hopefully we'll get a key beggar.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.920
Slow down.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.920
What? What kind of room is this?

37:44.920 --> 37:46.920
Oh, hold on, let's pop this right now.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.920
Yes, we definitely would like a slow down effect,

37:51.920 --> 37:53.920
I say, as the or is already sped up.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.920
You were like slow for a millisecond, please.

37:56.920 --> 38:00.920
I don't have the tears or benefit of any of this yet.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.920
I literally have like super passive items.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.920
The only reason we have a stat up is because of...

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
What's it called?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.920
Because of...

38:13.920 --> 38:14.920
Pills.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.920
Because we have astral projection,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.920
which it gets me a thing if I get damaged.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.920
Lucky bandage is passive and so is lucky key.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.920
Oh, please, just perish.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
Actually, I will say one thing I like about the monster design.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.920
If you look at this monster, he has a cleft palate,

38:30.920 --> 38:33.920
which is when your little schnozer in your mouth connect.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.920
You can get it fixed in surgery, it's not a big deal.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
But I like that the designs are quite...

38:38.920 --> 38:42.920
There's quite a few diagnoses that turned into bosses,

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
which I think is pretty cool.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
I mean, I thought it was pretty cool.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
Oh god, I'm so tempted to go inside.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.920
Ruffer's floor, little monstero, yay.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.920
But there is quite a few...

38:51.920 --> 38:55.920
I'll take the diamond card with me so we can double our money.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.920
I know I should have done the cursed room,

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
but I had terrible luck last time.

38:59.920 --> 39:04.920
I'd rather sacrifice my health on...

39:06.920 --> 39:08.920
On a...

39:08.920 --> 39:11.920
Oh, yeah, fuck him up, fuck him up, yeah.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
Take that, take that.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.920
All right, so I get to keep this.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.920
I'm just losing all my health.

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
I'm just losing my health, I don't want it.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.920
I didn't want my health anyway, I didn't need it.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.920
I'm going to lose my angel deal because of this twat.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
Oh, goodness' sake.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.920
That was terrible.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
Sorry, I really am just terrible at the game.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.920
I'm just popping this right now because I don't trust myself.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.920
Yeah, that's...

39:40.920 --> 39:43.920
I'm going to need the shops to help me out with something.

39:43.920 --> 39:48.920
Give me, like, champions belt, damage up.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.920
I'll take that.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.920
Black candle...

39:52.920 --> 39:54.920
Does that give me a damage up?

39:54.920 --> 39:57.920
Give me a damage up and avoid curses?

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
I think so.

39:58.920 --> 39:59.920
Money!

39:59.920 --> 40:00.920
Boss rush this time?

40:00.920 --> 40:01.920
No, you ain't getting it.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.920
You excited for the next Ed McMuffin game?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
It's called Mugenics.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
I saw gameplay footage of it.

40:07.920 --> 40:12.920
I'll be interested to see if it will...

40:12.920 --> 40:14.920
Oh, I don't want to take the full heart yet.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.920
I'll stay half heart in case there's a sacrifice room.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.920
Mugenics looks interesting.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.920
I'm not sure how much I...

40:23.920 --> 40:25.920
I'm going to enjoy it.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.920
It is a perplexing game.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
From the stuff that I've seen of it.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.920
I don't know how the mushrooms work, I'm going to be honest.

40:34.920 --> 40:38.920
I don't know if he's going to do a diagonal.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.920
I do have time to react though, so I can get out of the way.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.920
I hope it's multiplayer.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.920
Think big, find chaos in the shop.

40:46.920 --> 40:47.920
Wild card.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.920
A little bit cheeky chaos.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.920
I'm going to play it safe.

40:53.920 --> 40:54.920
This guy really...

40:54.920 --> 40:58.920
You shouldn't really be taking damage from him once you know what's up.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.920
I'm just playing mega safe because I lost all my hearts

41:02.920 --> 41:04.920
and I really want to get an angel deal.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
He just perished him.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.920
He's like, I've had enough.

41:12.920 --> 41:13.920
A large bomb.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.920
Well, we'll touch it anyway,

41:15.920 --> 41:18.920
but I think it actually prefers slowing.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.920
The large bomb would help with the enemy though.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.920
I don't have flay and before it drops like a coin.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.920
I don't have flay.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.920
Give me...

41:29.920 --> 41:32.920
Yeah, I was going to say counterfeit penny.

41:32.920 --> 41:33.920
I don't have flay.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.920
Maybe I'll get flay in a sec.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.920
If I do actually win this smile.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.920
Right, I beg, give me something good.

41:49.920 --> 41:50.920
You didn't see it,

41:50.920 --> 41:54.920
but I just violently put my head backwards out of annoyance.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.920
Well, this bomb in exchange of seven is worth it,

42:05.920 --> 42:07.920
so we'll grab that.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.920
Wait, use it to become flying.

42:10.920 --> 42:11.920
Refling?

42:11.920 --> 42:14.920
Can I teleport you into my brain right now?

42:14.920 --> 42:15.920
Oh my God.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.920
Why are you so smart?

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
Why?

42:20.920 --> 42:21.920
Okay.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.920
The question is, do we take counterfeit penny or not?

42:25.920 --> 42:27.920
Did we do it?

42:27.920 --> 42:29.920
Did we go out on economy?

42:32.920 --> 42:33.920
Yes.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.920
Because we have a good drop rate.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.920
We're doing economy.

42:37.920 --> 42:38.920
I should have picked that up first, idiot.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.920
Anyway.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
Right, grab this first.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.920
And then we'll go back to this.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
Refling, you're so smart.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.920
Right, we're going to pop our diamonds.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.920
So boom, we've got 48 coins just like that.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.920
We are going to pick up the cards

42:50.920 --> 42:52.920
because we might get a hierophant.

42:52.920 --> 42:53.920
Ooh.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.920
Ooh, we got the justies.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.920
Okay, we'll just go full health over that.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
Spawn's a blood donation.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.920
Teleports Isaac to the first floor,

43:03.920 --> 43:06.920
and then we'll just do angel deal to get it.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
We got holy man.

43:14.920 --> 43:15.920
Oh my Lord.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.920
I don't know if I can beat up this angel.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.920
I don't think I have the strength to beat him up,

43:25.920 --> 43:26.920
but we have holy man.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.920
Oh, we'll come back and beat up the angels at a later date.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.920
What we got?

43:31.920 --> 43:33.920
Blood donation machine.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.920
I'm going to see if there's a sacrifice one.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.920
It doesn't look like there is,

43:38.920 --> 43:42.920
but we might be able to get a sugar ton of money.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
Please don't do that.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
Money.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.920
Please stop jumping around the map.

43:48.920 --> 43:49.920
You're scaring me.

43:52.920 --> 43:53.920
Wah.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.920
Now you can go into the curse room for free.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.920
You are so right bestie.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.920
So I never realized this stuff until you type it out.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.920
I'm sure there are tumors that can maximize.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.920
Isaac runs down to every little detail.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.920
Me, I'm like, oh yeah, you can do that.

44:09.920 --> 44:10.920
Can you?

44:10.920 --> 44:11.920
Yeah.

44:11.920 --> 44:12.920
Right.

44:12.920 --> 44:13.920
Let's go grab.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.920
I think we'll pop blood donation machine as well.

44:22.920 --> 44:25.920
This is why we don't do the curse room.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.920
I'm kind of tempted, but I don't want to...

44:32.920 --> 44:34.920
If we get back in the angel room,

44:34.920 --> 44:38.920
I'll take that as a sign that we are supposed to jump in.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.920
We are not taking curse before.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.920
And I was like, oh, why don't you take curse today?

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
Do you need to take curse?

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
No.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.920
Okay, let's pop this one.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.920
Two, three, four.

44:54.920 --> 44:58.920
And then grab that and then one, two.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.920
Oh, we did get a bandage prop.

45:03.920 --> 45:04.920
Oh, there we go.

45:04.920 --> 45:05.920
That's what we want.

45:05.920 --> 45:06.920
We want the...

45:06.920 --> 45:09.920
We want the bandage train.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.920
Well, someone please think of the bandages.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.920
We might be able to get blood at IV bag.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.920
If we get IV bag, we're in the money

45:18.920 --> 45:21.920
because IV puts off our speed.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
Here we go for it, I think so.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
Oh, there you go.

45:28.920 --> 45:31.920
I think we're going to go and roll for IV bag

45:32.920 --> 45:36.920
because it puts our speed up and gives us another health slot.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.920
What did you call me?

45:37.920 --> 45:38.920
Yeah, that's right.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
I called you that.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.920
We're also going to put money in the donation machine in general

45:43.920 --> 45:46.920
because that will raise our floor luck.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
Okay, I stick.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
There we go.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
Yeah, you better start proking.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.920
Shawnee breaking the economy feels good, man.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.920
I became the very thing I swore to destroy.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.920
Oh, come on, pop.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.920
Oh, no, no, this can't be.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.920
Right, we're going to grab this health.

46:06.920 --> 46:07.920
We're at 84 economy.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
Don't mind if I do.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.920
Shawnee, this is a lot.

46:12.920 --> 46:13.920
Weezer build?

46:13.920 --> 46:15.920
Are you making fun of my build?

46:16.920 --> 46:18.920
Getting billy though.

46:18.920 --> 46:22.920
Right, we don't have anything else we can really utilize.

46:22.920 --> 46:23.920
Tell for Isaac.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.920
Right, first things first.

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
We'll just double the bombs now.

46:26.920 --> 46:27.920
Get out of the way.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.920
Bunk and then do that.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.920
And then buy you the world.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.920
It's probably better using on the next floor.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.920
We're going to put away some money so we can increase our luck

46:41.920 --> 46:44.920
and angel deal per chance.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.920
Or we'll just jam it and get nothing.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.920
Not like I wanted anything anyway.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.920
Right, four.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.920
What do we need?

46:57.920 --> 46:58.920
We've got eight key.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.920
I mean, we have plenty.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
We'll keep the world for next.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.920
You already have Nightmare Penny in the shop.

47:04.920 --> 47:05.920
Yes, I've done that before already.

47:05.920 --> 47:07.920
And then I blew it up.

47:08.920 --> 47:13.920
We'll just bomb this because we can't donate into it anymore,

47:13.920 --> 47:15.920
but we can get the monies out of it.

47:15.920 --> 47:20.920
Now, our great chance fight for the shop does go up exponentially.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.920
Okay, wait.

47:24.920 --> 47:25.920
So what is here?

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
Okay.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.920
That was gamer sense before.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
And it was like, are you?

47:33.920 --> 47:35.920
There was a poop in here then.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.920
All time we could have got IV bag.

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
We could have fully healed.

47:40.920 --> 47:43.920
We could have fully healed, but did we?

47:43.920 --> 47:44.920
No.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
Yeah, no.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.920
Of course, I destroyed the machine before finding the room.

47:49.920 --> 47:50.920
Okay.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
What is it?

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
Versus pestilence.

47:52.920 --> 47:58.920
So unfortunately, we don't get what is considered a normal boss kind of item.

48:02.920 --> 48:07.920
I really hope the shop is going to start giving us something that helps with fights

48:07.920 --> 48:13.920
because unfortunately, our item rooms, they haven't been lacking too much.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.920
As I said, the angel deal came in close.

48:16.920 --> 48:20.920
Oh, it's not got ahead when she keeps on sucking.

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
You'll lose your hit.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.920
That's not how anatomy works at all.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.920
We are going to play it careful.

48:30.920 --> 48:31.920
I really...

48:31.920 --> 48:36.920
Again, as I said, if we do unlock the angel room again, I'm going to blow one up.

48:36.920 --> 48:40.920
But it actually is in our best interest to lose this angel percentage

48:40.920 --> 48:43.920
because we've already snuck inside and got the item.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
Motherfucker.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.920
Okay, we're going in.

48:50.920 --> 48:51.920
Right.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
Get rid of the fire first because that's such a health hazard.

48:54.920 --> 48:56.920
And then we gift a this.

48:56.920 --> 48:58.920
Now, if this goes well...

48:59.920 --> 49:01.920
Oh, there's a thing there as well.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.920
If this goes well, we can actually fully unlock the key.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.920
Now, I do have a mod that lets me see where they're going to fire

49:07.920 --> 49:10.920
because I'm not good enough to not have it.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
I ain't that good.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
I'm not that guy.

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
Trust me.

49:13.920 --> 49:14.920
I'm not that guy.

49:14.920 --> 49:19.920
We could potentially take on the second angel as well and get the key.

49:19.920 --> 49:24.920
So we get two key pieces that will maximize our drop.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.920
We are just playing it safe.

49:29.920 --> 49:30.920
We did get hit.

49:30.920 --> 49:37.920
So unfortunately, my holy mantle is gone, but that's okay.

49:37.920 --> 49:40.920
As I said, it's not too bad.

49:40.920 --> 49:41.920
I mean, it's alright.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.920
I would like to keep our eternal heart.

49:44.920 --> 49:45.920
That's what that white heart.

49:45.920 --> 49:54.920
If we make it to the next level with it, we will get to keep a whole new red heart.

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
So again, oh, he's red.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
Oh, he's raging.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.920
Slow down, mate.

49:59.920 --> 50:00.920
Slow down.

50:00.920 --> 50:01.920
Right.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.920
You're getting bombed.

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
Honestly.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.920
Okay.

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
Well, completely missed.

50:05.920 --> 50:06.920
Oh, no.

50:06.920 --> 50:07.920
Oh, no.

50:07.920 --> 50:08.920
Oh, no.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.920
I fucked up.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.920
Bruh.

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
Bruh.

50:13.920 --> 50:14.920
Stop.

50:14.920 --> 50:15.920
Oh, my God.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.920
I'm actually going to, I'm going to lose this, please.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
I would like to remain alive.

50:19.920 --> 50:21.920
I would like to remain well.

50:21.920 --> 50:22.920
Please get bombed.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
Oh, my God.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.920
The bomb hardly does anything.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
Oh, my God.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Sorry.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
I am severe.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.920
I'm starting to need startups.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.920
Yeah, I can see the need for the startups.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.920
Please stop this madness.

50:39.920 --> 50:40.920
Stop it.

50:40.920 --> 50:41.920
Stop it.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.920
You're spawning in too many babies.

50:44.920 --> 50:45.920
Okay.

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
Okay.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Okay.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
Okay.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
It's fine.

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
It's fine.

50:50.920 --> 50:51.920
We did it.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.920
We did it.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.920
We just need to take out this baby.

50:54.920 --> 50:55.920
Okay.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.920
There we go.

50:56.920 --> 50:57.920
Oh, okay.

50:57.920 --> 51:02.920
We now have increased our angel deal as much as we can outwith like blowing up the shopkeepers,

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
for example.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.920
The angel think you're going to produce gen2?

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
Exactly.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
Unconfirmed?

51:08.920 --> 51:11.920
No, we're not doing angel.

51:11.920 --> 51:15.920
I'm tempted to go grab that chest.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.920
I don't know if it's the wisest thing.

51:18.920 --> 51:26.920
I mean, surely with holy mantle and I'm not going to mess it up so badly.

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
Surely.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
And we could get something out of it.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
We're going to do it.

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
We're going to do it.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
Send it.

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
Let's see what we're working with.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
Okay.

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
That wasn't bad.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.920
I just need to not mess up now.

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
Focus.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
Focus.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
Focus.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
Concentrate.

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
Concentration.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
Patient.

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Patient.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
Okay.

51:46.920 --> 51:52.920
We're going to pop that on these guys because they like to run at you.

51:52.920 --> 51:53.920
Yeah.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.920
That's right.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
I'm on to you.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
Mm-hmm.

51:56.920 --> 51:57.920
Mm-hmm.

51:57.920 --> 51:58.920
That's great.

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
That's great.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.920
You're doing shrapnel.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.920
I've got these guys.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
Okay.

52:04.920 --> 52:05.920
One more phase.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.920
Oh, I'm just serious.

52:08.920 --> 52:12.920
That's the one thing I could perish this game for.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.920
It's like, oh, let me just blow them up.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.920
Let me just spawn them on your face and I'm like, no, please don't do that.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.920
That's not very nice.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.920
Oh, please stop spawning flies.

52:23.920 --> 52:26.920
Bro, I ain't got bombs to deal with them.

52:26.920 --> 52:30.920
I really don't want to lose my little spiral spiral spirit heart.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.920
It's not spirit heart either.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.920
Soul heart.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
I didn't.

52:35.920 --> 52:41.920
I mean, we actually didn't come away any worse.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.920
I'm catching up at 1.5 speeds.

52:44.920 --> 52:45.920
Sorry.

52:45.920 --> 52:50.920
You don't understand how many buttons you add the rest of the other hit.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.920
I've been left, of course, restoring all the money.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.920
Oh, lol.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.920
I think I could stand myself at 1.5.

52:59.920 --> 53:03.920
She's becoming Neo and dodging every bullet.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.920
How is this still open?

53:04.920 --> 53:06.920
Normally like shots.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.920
Yeah, I was going to say normally shots like that.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
I hate these guys.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.920
Even worse if their brother who spawns 20 million yellow jump inspired.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.920
Oh, I hate these booters.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
GG.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.920
Look.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
Momathon.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.920
No risk, no reward.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.920
Oh, we got a chest.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.920
And before there's nothing in it.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.920
I'm going to pop the world card just so we know it's up ahead.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.920
That's not bad.

53:32.920 --> 53:34.920
If we get a trinket to swallow, then...

53:34.920 --> 53:36.920
Oh, we've got a library.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.920
That's not bad.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.920
Oh, why is it the diagonal?

53:43.920 --> 53:47.920
Oh, I hate the diagonal ones.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.920
They're so bad.

53:49.920 --> 53:50.920
They're so bad.

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
Please.

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
Please.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.920
Right, everyone's getting popped right now.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
I've had enough of yous.

53:56.920 --> 53:58.920
Everyone's getting popped.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.920
Right, we'll do the secret room and then we'll go to the library.

54:01.920 --> 54:06.920
Because if we can get double shot, that should increase our DPS by a bit of considerable output.

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
Okay.

54:12.920 --> 54:15.920
I'm going to hopefully get a bomb out of this.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.920
We might come back for that trinket.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.920
That's not a bad...

54:23.920 --> 54:25.920
That is not a bad trinket at all.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.920
Not a bad trinket for what we have.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.920
Not bad at all.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.920
The odds of the shop having...

54:41.920 --> 54:43.920
I'm just going to pop that.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.920
And it spawned blue spiders for us.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.920
The astronomical...

54:50.920 --> 54:51.920
I'm going to take HP.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
Yep.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.920
I just knew I should have saved it for this room.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.920
I could have seen it was a big room.

54:59.920 --> 55:01.920
I knew I was taking damage.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
These bats are terrible.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.920
I think they're called zoo bats in game.

55:05.920 --> 55:07.920
I know Pokemon zoo bats.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
Yes, I know.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.920
Please, three books.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.920
Close enough and you come.

55:15.920 --> 55:16.920
Oh, wait.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.920
We just got the angel deal on purpose.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.920
But that gives us infinite health.

55:24.920 --> 55:25.920
I think...

55:25.920 --> 55:27.920
I think we're swapping teams already.

55:28.920 --> 55:30.920
It didn't take as long.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.920
I think we're swapping teams already.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.920
Oh, it's Sissy the spider.

55:34.920 --> 55:35.920
Hi, Sissy.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.920
Look at the cute little blue spider.

55:38.920 --> 55:42.920
That sounded like a silverback gorilla came up behind you and squeezed all the air.

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
I already popped.

55:44.920 --> 55:50.920
Your vods are the only ones I've watched at normal speed since you said they spent time is more important than watching the entire vod.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.920
Yeah, YouTube's so annoying.

55:52.920 --> 55:55.920
I'm literally tempted by the devil unironically.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
I want to pop it so we have full health.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.920
That's terrible.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.920
And I just got the angel deal as well.

56:05.920 --> 56:06.920
Oh well.

56:06.920 --> 56:10.920
I prefer playing safer with full health than anything else.

56:10.920 --> 56:13.920
So please forgive I am a bad...

56:13.920 --> 56:16.920
Oh, well, that can have gone any worse.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.920
Please, I hope this shop has something decent inside.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
I'm...

56:22.920 --> 56:23.920
Or the item room.

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
I'll take the item room out.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.920
Oh, Sissy drops me spiders.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
Is that a bomba?

56:30.920 --> 56:31.920
Are you a bomba?

56:33.920 --> 56:38.920
Well, we do have a chance to do mega satan if things go in our favor.

56:38.920 --> 56:42.920
Whether or not they will, that's different, but you never know.

56:42.920 --> 56:43.920
Right.

56:44.920 --> 56:45.920
Good item.

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
Are you joking?

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
No, not Keynes.

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
Oh, yuck.

56:55.920 --> 56:58.920
My own eye is back.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.920
Entering a new floor has a chance.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.920
I wish I really need a swallow pill.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.920
I need to swallow the trinkets.

57:05.920 --> 57:09.920
Oh, it's not a greed fight, but it's absolutely rubbish.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.920
You should be ashamed of yourself.

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
What's this?

57:12.920 --> 57:14.920
The Emperor challenge mode.

57:14.920 --> 57:16.920
What is with these shops?

57:16.920 --> 57:17.920
What's that?

57:17.920 --> 57:18.920
Five plus bombs.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.920
I mean, 15 quid for five bombs isn't terrible.

57:21.920 --> 57:25.920
I'll swap out for it and I'm going to see what this pill is all about.

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
Because we've not discovered it.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
Please be a swallow...

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
pheromones.

57:28.920 --> 57:31.920
Okay, thanks for wasting my money.

57:31.920 --> 57:32.920
Money.

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
Yeah.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.920
I'll give it to the judgment.

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
He's giving me bombs.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.920
We do have enough money to go around.

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
Yeah.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.920
It's fine.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
I didn't want...

57:46.920 --> 57:49.920
It's not like I wanted a billion trinkets anyway.

57:51.920 --> 57:53.920
I think the secret room's below us right now.

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
Because look at...

57:54.920 --> 57:56.920
See how flat the wall is.

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
Yeah.

58:00.920 --> 58:01.920
You can...

58:01.920 --> 58:04.920
Right, we are going to bomb these skulls because there's a chance we get...

58:06.920 --> 58:09.920
I said there's a chance we get a black heart from them,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.920
but no, no, all of them were like not...

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
Right.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.920
Obviously, I've used the keys already to get in the rooms.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.920
We've got the hearts for devil deals.

58:21.920 --> 58:22.920
Don't say it.

58:22.920 --> 58:23.920
Don't make a flat joke.

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
Look.

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
You know what?

58:28.920 --> 58:30.920
Speaking of flat.

58:31.920 --> 58:32.920
Gen 2.

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
That's right.

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
Get your facts right.

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
I don't know.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
I'm sorry.

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
I'm dying.

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
But yes.

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
I do have a short.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.920
That reveals how much I earned coming out soon.

58:46.920 --> 58:48.920
Arissa's been fantastic to work with.

58:48.920 --> 58:51.920
She's actually about to do a batch for Sheebie.

58:51.920 --> 58:57.920
I think management's about to do a tweet asking for more Ed tours.

58:59.920 --> 59:04.920
Because we're kind of sitting about twiddling our thumbs,

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
waiting for other people,

59:05.920 --> 59:09.920
and it's like the contents, they're ready to be edited.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
We're just waiting.

59:10.920 --> 59:15.920
And obviously, shorts are very important for the growth of...

59:15.920 --> 59:18.920
Oh my God, Sissy is kind of getting it.

59:18.920 --> 59:20.920
Sorry, Sissy's doing so well right now.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.920
Right, we can't go into the curse for free.

59:24.920 --> 59:30.920
So, if you have Ed in...

59:30.920 --> 59:31.920
Do we want?

59:31.920 --> 59:32.920
If we do read,

59:32.920 --> 59:37.920
then we just focus on getting devil deals now.

59:38.920 --> 59:39.920
Speaking of that, how is Emmy?

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
Emmy's coming home, didn't you know?

59:41.920 --> 59:43.920
She's actually got a stream.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.920
She's so excited to stream again.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.920
She's like missed her big brother so much.

59:48.920 --> 59:49.920
And before I know it's like,

59:49.920 --> 59:50.920
that's weird, you're playing into that.

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
Fuck you.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.920
People enjoy things consensually.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.920
Fucking relax, okay?

59:55.920 --> 59:57.920
Right, I'm going to bomb him.

59:57.920 --> 59:59.920
Oh, I haven't got money.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.920
We are going to get a devil deal,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.920
a bit of a devil deal.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.920
We're going to keep the book on our persons.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920
I like it because I like planes to proceed

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.920
with like infinite health respawn.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.920
Do we keep?

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.920
I think actually, you know what we're going to pick up?

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:27.920
We are going to pick up the restock trinket.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.920
And we're going to say goodbye to counterfeit penny.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920
You've done fantastic.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.920
You've absolutely boosted our economy out the wazoo.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.920
But now that we have 4% luck,

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.920
our drop rate is high enough to enjoy what it's worth.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.920
Play into your gen mates theme, thinking.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920
How dare...

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.920
Motherfucker, I created Emmy in that image.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.920
I'm sorry, I see this again.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.920
Emmy is created in my image.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.920
If I had a lighter voice, it would be over for you fuckers.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920
It would...

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920
How did I already get hit?

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.920
Was I not paying attention?

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.920
God, I really need some devil,

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.920
good devil items to come through.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
She's like everything I want to be.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.920
Small, cute, adorable, absolutely outrageous, yes.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.920
But I don't have a light voice, so I can't do that.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920
Unless you guys want like...

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920
Was it the gap mo?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.920
I remember when you guys taught me what gap mo means.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920
I was like gap mo, huh?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920
What does that mean?

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.920
Unless you want the gap mo to be astronomical,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.920
and we just end up getting a lollipop version of me.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.920
And I still sound the exact same.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.920
My voice doesn't change at all.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.920
I'm just like, who goes, how's it going?

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920
I'm strong here.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.920
Do you mean it looks cool that you knew?

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920
Why?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
What is gap mo?

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.920
Gap mo is when you're designing your voice

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920
and attitudes and...

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920
Are you joking?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920
Don't...

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920
Give me that.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920
Right.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.920
We've got two orbitals now.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.920
That didn't do anything.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.920
And there's nothing in the shop.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920
Right, okay.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.920
There's no point in hanging about

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.920
if we didn't get the devil deal.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920
Right, off we pop.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920
I want a lollipop.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920
You're going to gap mo.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.920
I'm going to gap mo all over you.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920
Petition for saying all the letters in mo.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920
Moe.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
Oh, gap moe.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.920
I want lollipop strong now.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.920
Honestly, that'd be hilarious.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
I don't...

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920
I wouldn't mind it.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920
I think that would be funny.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920
It's probably being like,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.920
Hi guys, how's it going?

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920
I'm strong here.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920
Like in my deep voice.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
Everyone's like,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.920
You don't sound like you think at all.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920
Oh, I peed myself.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Thank you, Broly Legend, for the tip.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
Um...

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920
What?

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.920
See, this isn't the thing about Binding of Isaac.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.920
You can play so much

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.920
and you end up getting like the most random rooms

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920
you've never seen in your life before.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.920
I can see that tinted rocks.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920
I'm just gonna...

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.920
Oh, and it misses both of them.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.920
You know what I think about you?

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.920
You farts, honestly.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920
Honestly.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.920
We are needing stat up.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.320
We are needing stat-ups, we're needing pills, we're needing anything because this is getting

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.840
a bit of a donk y'all aren't you mate?

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:41.960
Okay, we're gonna pop this so we're definitely gonna have high priestess.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.000
There may be sacrifice room on floor, maybe?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.600
Oh, I wasn't paying attention sorry.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:57.600
Hmm, I've never seen that if only you could throw keys at an enemy.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.600
Hey wait a minute that's an item.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.600
Just out of curiosity is there a girl and veeler that isn't in a pet play?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600
What?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.440
Wait until you hear the logic behind it.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.120
Remember that time I told you guys that women don't like it if you treat animals cruelly?

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120
Hmm, I wonder why, smile.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.440
Oh for goodness sake!

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.440
You're so dramatic, you're so dramatic Keen, get up!

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.440
Is that a double tinted rock behind the skull?

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440
Am I going crazy?

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440
No it is a double tinted rock, I knew it!

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.440
I knew it was a double tinted rock.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:46.440
I know we don't have to kill this but out of principle perish.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.440
Again these red fires can only shoot one fire at you, they can't shoot anymore.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.440
So don't get too scared now, don't hurt them now.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.440
Okay so we do have that knife orbital so we can play a bit dangerous.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:07.440
If we time it correctly we can just jam the knife in the enemies but you know you have to make sure you don't mess it up.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440
Or else you're just taking XP damage.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.440
Although we do have holy mantle which is negating a heck of a lot of damage.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.440
Yeah again, here we go.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.440
See we just shove our wee orbitals in it and Bob's your auntie, Uncle's your fan or something.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440
Shit, I feel bad.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440
Pills!

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.440
Why we got speed up?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.440
Look up.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440
What's that one, hold on, hold on.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440
Oh sorry I've lost my hang.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440
Unidentified Pills.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440
48 hour energy, sure pop it.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.440
We don't actually need to do this room so we'll just teleport to the enemy.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.440
We've got Sister Viss.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440
Sister Viss.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.440
So we're maybe just do orbital knife on these guys?

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:57.440
Although I would like to maintain my face.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.440
That was so extreme and you know it was extreme.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440
That was insane.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.440
Oh.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
I should maybe just do more.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.440
Right one's down.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.440
Did I just get to stay in astral form?

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.440
Why am I so bad?

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440
No!

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.440
Right you're getting nuked.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440
I'm so bad.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.440
Oh we get Bookworm.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.440
Right, ultimate.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.440
Grab this.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.440
So we've got Bookworm but I'm keeping this because it's infinite health.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.440
And we're going to the El Diablo deal and we're just grabbing it.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.440
Thank you El Diablo.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
We have our Drosidae Vildil.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.440
Received that.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440
No, see it doesn't give me infinite health.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440
God how far in the map did we?

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440
Whoa this is a big map, isn't it?

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.440
It's not an XLR4.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.440
The purple, red can keep firing you.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440
You want it?

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:09.440
You want me, I'll sit here and prove that the red only shoots once.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440
Sorry that was gamer instinct, I just knew.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.440
I know it doesn't make sense but I just knew, okay.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440
Oh, that was not the one we wanted but hey ho.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440
Actually, oh we got Lucky Penny.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.440
We're at 6 luck.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.440
If we could get a trinket that had something like that.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440
I keep dropping more heart.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.440
Okay, we're literally full on money.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.440
Thank you, a key beggar.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440
Maybe not right now.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.440
No, rooms like this I wish we had flying.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
Holy moly.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.440
The bugs are coming.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.440
We need to be careful of the bugs.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.440
They're gonna steal my little holy mantle.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.440
You wouldn't steal my holy mantle, would you?

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
A wild card.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440
Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440
Kiff?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440
Charly?

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.440
I think I said that right.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.440
Thank you for the tip, I appreciate it.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:27.440
You're literally reducing the gen 2 goal.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.440
Not even kidding.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.440
I very much expected a greed fight.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.440
I am not at all surprised.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440
Whoa, good block.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:48.440
Good block on the orbital knife.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440
That was a fantastic block.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.440
No, stop spitting out spiders, I'm getting annoyed.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.440
No, don't give me double spiders please.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Okay, the mulligan fly.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.440
We need to perish because they always hit me when they're on a poopy.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.440
We need to find gen 2 before the donor thun so we can focus on gen 3.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440
You want me to pop out gen 3?

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440
We haven't even been a 2 months here yet.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440
We haven't even been a hero.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440
Whoa!

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440
Whoa!

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.440
Okay, my tears are now connected with damage.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.440
Oh my god.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440
There's no way, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.440
Now there should, there looks like there's going to be a secret room here at the bottom.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440
What?

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.440
Oh come on mate, cheeky.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440
Okay, there we go, we got both our secrets.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.440
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.440
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.440
Give me that bad boy, are you joking me?

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.440
So we did just take a tier reduction, but the reason why that's so good,

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.440
as if that didn't push the thing up there,

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.440
we now can block enemy projectiles by firing.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440
That's right, according to the encyclopedia of,

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.440
we are what's called MLG proof.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.440
Nope.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440
Oh, that didn't get the guy on the bottom.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440
Ooh.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.440
Hey, I'm going to pop my ult.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.440
I should probably hold it for the next floor.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.440
Hold!

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440
But it's fine.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440
Yeah, holy crap.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.440
I can't believe we're doing a mega scene.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440
I'll take that to the next floor.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.440
Unless this card up here is way better.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440
I don't know.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.440
Still got zero damage.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.440
I knew, I knew, I knew damage.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.440
Weird damage, no damage.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.440
Okay, we'll grab this heart and then we are good to jump off this floor.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.440
Now we have had one greed fight.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.440
I believe the next floor is our last chance for a shock.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.440
So if we get a greedy greed fight,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.440
it's ogre.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.440
I don't know if I should use this key burger.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.440
I'm going to go for it.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440
Now I might regret it,

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440
but I might not.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440
Have you ever thought about that?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440
Okay, I regret it.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.440
We'll go down to what?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440
I don't know.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440
Okay.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.440
Brave.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.440
Brave.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.440
Okay, we'll go down to 10 keys.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.440
Okay, give me that.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.440
10 keys.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.440
And here's a gift for you.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.440
I enjoyed every second of that.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.440
I don't want to go to that chest because I'm too lazy.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440
Look at all that money.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.440
I know I'm literally max money.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.440
The game is like more.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
I'm like, no.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.440
Low shot speed is always nice.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.440
You can still pick up the batteries.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440
Oops, did I forget the batteries?

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.440
Okay, so this is our last chance for a shock.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.440
Is it going to be a greed fight?

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440
Odd say yet.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Our survey says I.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.440
Okay, we can bomb the absolute...

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
Mmm.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440
Okay, our devil deal went up, which is good.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440
Good.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440
Okay, we have this.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440
What are we looking at?

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440
What are we looking at?

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.440
See, Holy Mantle is so OP.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440
I am very happy.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440
No, don't jump.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440
I hate him.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.440
He jumps and he's stinky because he lands on your head.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440
Oh, please.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440
Okay, that's better.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.440
Okay, I'm just going to pop out so we have all black hearts.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440
So if we do get heart,

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.440
the game says nephronomic effect smile.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.440
All right, I do this.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.440
There's no way.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.440
Either this one's going to go good or not.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.440
Oh, I came to Lake Leech.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440
I'm sorry.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.440
I think leech is a cute bit to me, but I think we can do better.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.440
All right, we'll grab this.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440
I like leech.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440
I do.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.440
Are we going to blue baby?

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Up or down?

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.440
I think we may have to go down.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.440
No, not unicorn stump.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440
Thanks for the attempt though.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.440
No, not anti-gravy.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.440
You suck.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440
No, not scatterbombs.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440
You suck.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.440
We should have taken leech.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.440
It's going to blow up on the next one, I think.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.440
Are you...

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:47.440
I should have taken the leech, the cute little wiggly boy.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.440
Sometimes it's all about taking a wiggly boy, OK?

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.440
So...

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440
Oh, I lost my heart doing that.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.440
I thought I was being so smart, being like, ha ha ha.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.440
Ugh.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.440
Well, it's fine.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.440
Sometimes good enough is best.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440
Literally, the game punishes you for thinking,

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.440
for having the audacity to try and get better.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
Uh...

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440
What?

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.440
Is there a room, potentially?

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.440
Uh, I don't have an orbital.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.440
OK, the electricity does help with guys like that,

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.440
where they can only be hurt from one side.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.440
I do see the tinted rock.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440
I mean, maybe we'll get a golden chest out of it.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.440
I'd rather we actually get golden chests

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440
and the chance to spawn an item,

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.440
or keys, I guess.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.440
Uh, than, like, anything else at the moment.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.440
But yes, we're going to do cane.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.440
And if I have yapped a bit too quickly,

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:59.440
then I think we'll give a Zazzle a cheeky run, as well.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.440
A Zazzle actually starts with flight.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440
Now, whenever you play this game,

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440
you notice that flight is very valuable,

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440
not only for mobility,

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.440
but to get access to items otherwise you wouldn't.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440
For example, we don't have access to that money.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.440
Now, we're lucky our economy is so high that we don't nest,

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.440
so there's a sputter.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440
Get that sputter!

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440
We don't actually need it.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440
Is there a tinted rock?

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.440
I can spot it in here.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440
With your bad eyesight.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.440
Oh, gee, son, is that you?

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.440
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440
Ooh!

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.440
I am so bad at reacting to that.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.440
I just was like, yeah, smile.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.440
No, we could have had a leech on our side.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440
No.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440
The game's taunting me.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.440
I could have had a leech friend.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440
Spitters are quitters.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440
Flight is for cowards.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.440
No, it's so OP, though.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440
Okay, what happened?

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.440
Is there a rock?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.440
I can't even see.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.440
Oh, there's a gap in the ground.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.440
I can't even see what I'm supposed to be aiming for right now.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.440
Okay, here's the moment.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.440
Oh!

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.440
As if it just did that.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.440
Lol.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440
As if it just did that.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440
See, this is why holy mantles clutch.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440
Last time I was saved by the...

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.440
Wow, that's...

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.440
If the shops could be any more disappointing,

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.440
I don't even think this is possible.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.440
Now, normally I'd be like, yay, vault,

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.440
but I actually don't think we want to.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.440
I don't, it's not...

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.440
We have such low damage to recharge.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440
It's like damage per 4 increases,

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.440
like, nah, we're literally going to take ourselves away

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.440
from even having the...

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.440
Did that really get me?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.440
See these wee hings?

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.440
I've got nothing but the audacity to tell you that much.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.440
Is there really no sacrifice floor?

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.440
And I've popped the book.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440
I better have popped the book.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440
Oh!

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440
I need my glegs on.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.440
I'm saying, oh, you've not got your glegs on.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440
I've not got my glegs on.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440
Honestly.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440
As you get for questioning my loyalty,

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440
we got tricked with the backstab.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440
Honestly.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440
Not one sacrifice floor.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.440
I'm so sorry to backtrack,

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.440
but the value of having a sacrifice room

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440
is like pretty high because we have old bandage,

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.440
but we got it once and then the game was like,

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440
nope, that was your one chance to shine.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440
Never again.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.440
I'm like, okay.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440
Of course you get me.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.440
Like, you're not even near me.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440
Right.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440
We'll see you perish.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.440
I did all that backtracking for a chest.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440
Enter an unclear boss.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.440
Fully recharges the activity.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.440
Wow.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440
That was rubbish.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440
Once again, I'd like to thank Holy Mantle

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440
for carrying us exactly.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.440
Without you, I could bomb that thing back there.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.440
I'll try.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.440
Literally carried by the wafer,

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.440
carried by Holy Mantle,

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.440
and now getting again with the three and not a card.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440
Rubbish.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440
You can take it.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.440
What, the trinket?

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.440
Oh, you're right.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440
This is the last floor.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.440
I could have done anything with this current trinket,

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.440
which is pay to win.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.440
Sorry for the backtracking.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:53.440
Yes.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.440
Mercy has a full video coming out on her channel soon.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.440
For you who use Holy Harvester,

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440
we're so shocked she played it.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440
Yes, she's getting a highlight reel of it

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
because she just loved it so much.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.440
But management's going to tweet out

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.440
that we need editors for Shorts

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.440
and for, oh, why did that glitch out?

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.440
I have the mod that lets you see her foot coming down,

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440
but I think it's bugging out right now.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440
I don't know what blue mum means.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440
I don't know if it means she's more aggressive.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.440
Oh, I've lost already.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.440
Oh, no.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.440
This can't be.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440
I'm going to lose.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.440
We are solo energy.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.440
Sorry, we're having to take the negative

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.440
because this is insane.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.440
This is absolutely terrible.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.440
No stat upgrades, actually.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.440
If anything, stat down because lost contact,

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.440
but her stat's down.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.440
I don't want to sacrifice too much of my health for this

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.440
because the next few floors,

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.440
they do have cheeky enemies that take out your health quick

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.440
and I really don't want to go low.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:17.440
But yeah, this is cheekily not the best.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.440
We could definitely be doing better with just about everything.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.440
Leave my dead body alone.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:32.440
Yeah, this is a unique situation to be in.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:38.440
Oh god, we've got flight now.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.440
Okay, I can deal with flight.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.440
But yeah, that's how lower damage is.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.440
Just nothing is happening to Mohen.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.440
Oh, well, I'm going to pop my ult.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440
Maybe the net cross is what's going to take her out.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440
The net cross effect.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440
I think it's 60 damage by default.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.440
If you get page two, I think it increases to like 60.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.440
I meant to say 30 if I said 60.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.440
This is not going to go well.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.440
I'm trying.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.440
Come on, game.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.440
You must realize my health is low.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.440
You must know how terribly low my health is.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440
This is excruciating.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.440
This is a crawl.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.440
I don't know if I need a bomber.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440
You know that?

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.440
Okay.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440
Pardon me.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440
I'm sorry.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.440
We did fail the devil deal, which is a shame.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440
We are going to have to take the damage, the negative.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.440
So we're going to have to drop down below Satan.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440
Satan.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440
Bless you.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.440
There's a cough.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440
Actually, hydration check.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:58.440
I think I'm about to start coughing.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440
I love my boomer gamer veto words.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440
I'm not fucking boomer.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440
I'm not even.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.440
I'm not even millennial.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440
Boomer.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.440
I'll shove a boomer up your arse.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.440
Okay.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.440
We don't have anything else we can do on this floor.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:22.440
We're going to take the Satanic Bible with us.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.440
T-boy is pretty old mummy.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.440
What the sigma?

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.440
Let's hope we can get a devil deal as well as a devil item on this floor.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:38.440
Because that would make the world a difference if we got some of that good stuff.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.440
I'm wondering if brimstone shot.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.440
Oh, you're done.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:50.440
Brimstone shot would still have the negation.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440
Like they can't hit us.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.440
What's the fight room?

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440
Tell you what.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440
Tell you what.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440
Let's just do that.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.440
Zoomer, but somehow also not a weeb.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.440
Well, we're watching anime together.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.440
She better get recommended me the ones I need to see.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.440
I've seen the ones that everyone's seen.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.440
Like attack on titan, death note, kill or kill.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.440
I've seen what needs to be seen.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.440
So you guys can actually start recommending me animes.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.440
And we'll do full binge anime days.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.440
I think runescape.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:36.440
We might do a binge because I got two more streams and then I've got my 99 on runescape.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.440
So that's another goal met that I wanted.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:45.440
And then we'll do weeb days.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.440
And then I'll call it the weebification of strawnae.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.440
I'm going to pop this just to make sure I've popped it.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.440
That's a lot of enemies.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.440
I'm trying to get the one in the corner so I can run somewhere if I need to.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.440
But it's not really happening.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.440
The enemies are so polite.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440
They just don't walk into me.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440
My favourite kind of enemy.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.440
I'm watching dundum iron-blooded orphans.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.440
It's pretty gay.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.440
Cowboy beatbox.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.440
I've seen samurai shampoo.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.440
Is that really not a hit?

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440
Oh!

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.440
Why did I not see the dam?

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.440
I did not see it coming at all.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.440
It must be the confidence that you give me reeflings, honestly.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.440
That's right, I'm turning this on you.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.440
It's your problem.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.440
It's your problem.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.440
It's my problem.

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.440
Please item!

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.440
Receive triple shot.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440
Triple shot?

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.440
I mean, I guess.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.440
We can use it if we're in a pinch.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:25:00.440
See, flight for a room like this would be so helpful to avoiding attacks.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.440
No confidence.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.440
You give me all confidence.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.440
Oh!

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.440
Okay, we can at least go in the curse room to check it out.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440
Let me get up.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440
Let him get up.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440
Oh, one more.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.440
One more.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.440
Some of these enemies do not want to be vanquished.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.440
I'm so used to them coming flying at you.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440
Okay, we can pop this.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440
Maybe a guppy item?

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440
Speed?

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.440
Sure.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.440
Oh, guppers!

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.440
No.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.440
The game really wants me to take it.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440
Oh my gosh.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.440
Wait, you can get a library?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.440
What?

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.440
I didn't know you could get a library in the room.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440
What?

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.440
Well, we've already got that.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.440
I'll go at ten keys and no more.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.440
I didn't know you could get a library down here.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.440
Oh.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.440
I'll take that.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440
I don't mind if I do.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.440
A devil beggar.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.440
Sure.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440
Boom.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.440
Well, you can actually do something with the money.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:21.440
I had no idea you could get it down here.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.440
Do I have access to a shop?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.440
Sure.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.440
I'll take it.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440
Thanks.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440
Did you get 20-20?

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.440
Yeah, I got 20-20 bookworm.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440
Hey, hit him with it.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.440
Hey, hit him with it.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.440
Gobi.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440
Gobi.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.440
I love it.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.440
I love the jump animation.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.440
It's so cute.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.440
No, go away.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.440
No, go away.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.440
You stink.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.440
Ow.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440
Okay.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.440
Did I use the book on this floor?

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440
I have now.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.440
I've used it twice if I forgot the other time.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.440
I don't like these guys.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.440
I wish we got more pills dropped actually.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:09.440
Now that I think about it, six luck but not getting pills dropped.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.440
Hmm.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.440
Curious game.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.440
The game knew I picked Kane.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440
Hmm.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440
And I had Lucky Foot.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.440
Hmm.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440
This game wants me to suffer.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440
Admit it.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440
You want me to be upset.

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.440
You want me to vanquish and cry.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.440
So not only do we have contact lines, we actually have PapaFly which protects us from incoming

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440
projectiles.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.440
I get, yeah, literally I can just spray them down.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440
Feels good, man.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.440
Okay, hold on.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.440
Alright.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.440
Doesn't mean I'm immune though.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.440
Can I blow this up?

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.440
Yeah.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.440
Sure.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.440
I'm sure that would come in handy.

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.440
So what's down here then?

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440
Just a random room.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.440
Whoa.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.440
Just a room to punish you if you got a bit curious.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440
That's all.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.440
Oh, we got Back Saber.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440
Back Saber, proct.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.440
That's right.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.440
The word is proct for you noobs that have never played this game before.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.440
It means the effect came into play.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.440
It's okay if you're a noob though.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.440
I'll look after you.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440
What the heck?

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.440
I rarely go against this boss.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.440
Wow.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.440
I rarely go against this boss.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:40.440
They get...

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440
Hold on.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.440
I need to pop this.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.440
I never go against this boss.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.440
I hardly...

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.440
What?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.440
It has a phase freaking worm too?

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:57.440
And of course it's not projectile base because that would be too easy.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.440
Right.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.440
Damage up.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.440
Thank goodness.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.440
Are you kidding me?

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.440
We got a Krampus fight.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.440
Our damage is now seven so we're actually looking decent.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440
A Krampus fight.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.440
At least give us Lump of Coal instead of his head.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440
At least...

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:21.440
I didn't realize he could spin in a wee circle like that.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.440
I said Lump of Coal.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.440
I can't believe that.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.440
I wouldn't have gone any worse if I tried.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440
Lump of Coal.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.440
And we got head.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.440
Look, head's good for you but for me not really.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.440
That's terrible.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440
That's awful.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.440
The way it just rolls off my tongue as well.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.440
That's terrible.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.440
Oh, of course there's pinworms as well.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:55.440
How could we forget?

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.440
Okay.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.440
I have no idea.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.440
Oh, then we've got an arcade.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.440
Okay, we can utilize our monies.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440
Arcades don't need keys.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.440
They need a single cent.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.440
Hmm.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.440
The arcade machine took a full health.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.440
Not a wee one.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.440
I was going to say we can maybe get IV back.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.440
But if it's taken full, I don't think so.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.440
Oh, please.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.440
I think I can just mow them down.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.440
I don't need to aim if it's a projectile.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.440
That's a mimic chest but because we have Holy Manta we can grab it.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:43.440
Yeah, this is a womb floor.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.440
Ooh.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.440
The classic womb room.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440
Give me that.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.440
Right, popped all.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440
So we're 100% getting a devil deal.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.440
Whoa, we beelined.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.440
Oh, I hate this guy.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440
I hate this guy.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440
Please.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440
Please be nice.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.440
Please.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.440
Okay.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:07.440
The enemy, the secret room can't be in that previous room.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440
Maybe here?

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.440
Yeah, okay.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440
That's the best we can do.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:16.440
Increase our chances by popping his cloaks.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.440
36%.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.440
It's not the best.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:19.440
He's alright.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.440
But yeah, that's pretty much all we can do.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:27.440
Women downwards always is full heart damage, dang.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.440
What am I meant to do beneath our desk now?

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.440
You can lick my toes.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440
That's terrible.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.440
That made no sense if no one was reading chat.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.440
I apologize if that came out of nowhere.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:43.440
It's because I didn't read the full message.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.440
Okay.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.440
Okay, come on.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:51.440
Okay, we're going to commit and we're just going to spray down the center.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:59.440
Because I think we'll, okay, unless she does that, unless she does that attack, then I'm

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.440
not sure we can out-shoot this.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440
Just take your time.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.440
We can out-shoot that.

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.440
That's fine.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440
We have orbitals as well, which are also protecting us.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.440
We have gone full defense this run.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.440
Actually, now that I think about it, this is just full defense.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:25.440
I need to remember to go down after this fight.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.440
Can you reach over there?

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.440
Seriously.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.440
I must remember to go down.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.440
Come on.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.440
Please don't start laser beaming.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.440
That's when I can't keep up.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.440
That's the very move I was actually talking about.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.440
Funny you mentioned that.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.440
That's actually the very one.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:51.440
Okay, we failed the devil deal, which is a shame.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.440
Let's just go down then, I guess.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.440
Just cast Feet of the Lea.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440
There's plenty of things to look down there.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.440
How much longer are you going to play for?

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.440
More meh.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440
Oh, wow.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.440
This run's actually taken a lot longer.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.440
I think we're only doing one run today and then I'm going to redirect into Sheepster.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.440
Oh, there's an eyeball.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440
Okay, we're fine.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.440
I don't know if Sheepster's is up yet.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440
Okay, we've got bombs.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.440
I'll probably just read a few marshmallows after this.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.440
I didn't realize how much of a yamper I am.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.440
I do apologize again for anyone who...

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.440
Oh, I don't have flight.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.440
For some reason I thought I had flight because he had flight.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.440
Although that's not how the game works.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.440
I would love it if I did that.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.440
Pop and all to confirm that we're getting a devil deal item.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.440
Sheepy has a collab so she seems later today.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440
Sheepy, are you dodging me?

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.440
I'm starting to think you're dodging me.

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440
Smile.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:53.440
Yes, for anyone that is listening in,

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.440
I will repeat myself in a few days' time,

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440
so don't worry if you didn't hear it at first.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440
There's got...

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440
Wait, is the enemy still in this room?

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440
Oh my God, I thought that.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
I was like, wait, are you still here?

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440
Hello, is anyone here?

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.440
I can't do any membership streams

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.440
or ASMR streams for three weeks.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.440
But I will always make it up to you

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.440
because you know what I'm like.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:21.440
So all I can say is thank you for your patience

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.440
and waiting on me.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.440
You're joking.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.440
Fricking...

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.440
But my gen mates, you can find their links

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.440
in the description below.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440
They will be doing ASMRs,

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.440
though Mersi had a fantastic ASMR role play

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.440
if you want to check out the VOD where she went to.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.440
That was really good.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.440
I found it really good anyway.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.440
Considering she knew to the ASMR side of things

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440
and producing it side of things.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.440
I mean, we can try and find the secret room,

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.440
but yeah.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440
I think we'll just go for it.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440
I'm going to pop the hanged man.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440
I'll see if I regret it, but...

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440
Oh, and Holy Mantle's gone already.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.440
Lovely.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.440
I might just pop the thing so I have the Necro effect.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.440
Please don't spin. I'll cry.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.440
It's not too bad.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.440
It's not too bad.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440
It could be worse.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440
It could be a heck of a lot worse.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440
I really hope we get a good item

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.440
in the treasure box.

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.440
Is it the dark room it's called?

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.440
Oh wow, the card didn't last.

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:50.440
Okay, we can just keep spraying

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.440
because we have the dodge on the things.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.440
As just as he's going to keep spraying.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440
Do you mind?

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.440
Papa Fly is going so ham right now.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.440
Well, that's what we didn't want, but that's what we got.

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.440
Okay, we got that. That's fine.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.440
Oh, I just got hurt by something.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.440
Something's... I have no idea.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.440
I don't have a concept of what's happening.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:25.440
Okay, lovely.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.440
Please don't...

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440
I swear if I die because I'm just trash,

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440
I'm going to cry so much.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.440
I literally have Holy Mantle.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.440
Imagine dying with Holy Mantle.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.440
I'm not even playing the loss.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440
Okay, don't do that again to me.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.440
I suck and there's no charge things back there,

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.440
so I'm just going to...

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.440
Mercy went all out in the stream.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.440
It was good. It was really good.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.440
Honestly, you're scary when you say that you will make up

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440
for it last time.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440
You did four streams back to back.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440
What will happen?

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.440
Please take care.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440
Oh, you already know what's going to happen.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440
It's going to be like multiple membership streams,

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440
multiple public streams on the same day.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.440
Or endurance streams back to back.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.440
Nope, don't need money.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.440
Taking damage spawns a permanent demon.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.440
Oh, of course I don't get to see my health either

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.440
because that would be too nice.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440
I'm going to take flies.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.440
I like flies.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.440
I'm just going to grab these. Why not?

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440
We have Holy Mantle.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440
So we can what? Come in and out.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.440
Holy moly.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.440
I love Holy Mantle.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.440
Enter in a room poisons all enemies.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.440
Yes, that's a good one.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440
We got egg as well.

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.440
So we get soul heart and we can negate 20% damage.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.440
That was a really good room to get all things considered.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.440
I hate these guys.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.440
They're terrible.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:47.440
He's super scary.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.440
He just got me.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.440
Sorry, hold on.

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440
My fingers falling off the analog stick.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.440
He's so scary.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.440
I hate him.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.440
The wee mask guy.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.440
Come on, blue baby.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440
Beat him up with your wee flies.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440
Oh no, you're not blue baby.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.440
Sorry, zombie baby.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.440
Dead baby.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.440
Rotten baby.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.440
Rotten baby.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.440
I forgot his name.

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440
An egg.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.440
It's literally an egg.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.440
Look at my head.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440
I'm an egg now.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440
I literally have an egg head.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440
Who you calling an egg head?

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.440
Look at my head.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.440
It's an egg.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440
Secret floor.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440
Secret room, sorry.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.440
And it's not a pill room.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.440
I can't believe I'm actually asking the game to give me a pill room.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.440
That's when you know it's bad.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440
Relax.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.440
Okay.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.440
Well, I deserve that.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.440
Are you?

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.440
I'm actually going to die at the end of this game.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.440
Please.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440
Please.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440
Okay, that was lucky.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
What do you?

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.440
Oh no, he has the brimstone aim.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.440
He has brimstone aim.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.440
Like all lock things, my Bobber.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440
And he's going to do it.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
I don't know when he's going to do it.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440
Okay, he's giving me spiders.

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.440
Yeah, he just did it there.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.440
Did you see that purple charge beam?

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.440
I was on a you, you, you mop bag, honestly.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.440
I saw that coming.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440
If we could raise our base damage,

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440
we could raise our base damage.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440
We could raise our base damage.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440
We could raise our base damage.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440
We do have 6% luck.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.440
Honestly, we should probably be getting a bit.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
Did I?

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440
I just.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440
Hold on a minute.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.440
Wow.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440
Who are you calling a pin today?

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.440
What did, did you guys know that match is the secret voice actor of Patrick star?

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.440
Who are you calling a pin?

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440
Right.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.440
I'm going to pop my alt because I've no got a scooby-doo what my health is,

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.440
but he needs when he needs.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440
Right.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.440
The fear is actually helping to take enemies off of her bat.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.440
Oh, this is a terrible room.

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440
No.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.440
No, that's what I didn't want.

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440
How am I supposed to negate that?

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.440
I don't know.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.440
He's curving.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.440
He's not straight.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440
He's curving.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.440
Why is it curved?

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.440
You got me.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.440
Okay.

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440
Hold on.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440
I'm just walloping them.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440
Okay.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.440
I don't know if this boss fight is going to go well.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.440
I'm going to keep all my bombs for the boss fight because I don't trust this.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440
He's by the pope.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440
Donating cause I'm sad.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440
I can't watch.

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440
Just listen.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440
You'd only hear me right now.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440
Are you at work?

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440
Don't make me start.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.440
Thank you, Broly legend for the tip.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440
Patrick is a neat and still makes ends meet every month.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.440
Wait, you keep people actually say ain't got a scooby-doo.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.440
That wasn't a sigh up.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.440
No, we say that.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440
I've not got a clue.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.440
I ain't got a scooby-doo because scooby-doo are always looking for a clue.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.440
I've not got a scooby-doo.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440
What's going on?

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.440
I've not got a clue.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440
It's not a sigh up.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440
It's real.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.440
I promise you British people are real.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.440
I'm sorry you had to learn this way.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440
That's a good something.

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.440
Oh no.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440
I may have just killed us.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.440
I may have just killed us.

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440
I may have just killed us run dead in the water.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.440
Oh yeah, piggy bank.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.440
That'll sure help.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.440
Yeah, thanks piggy bank.

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.440
Yeah, thanks.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.440
I accidentally picked up a quarter which has no value at all in this run.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.440
When I desperately need health and I keep messing up.

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.440
If I could just mow him down before he mows me down.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.440
I can't tell if that...

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:08.440
So sometimes the game puts down bombs to give you a hint that the secret room's there.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.440
But obviously you can't, you always believe it.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.440
Okay, that was lucky that Toxic Shot came in clutch.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.440
So again, we're going to try and mow him down and make him scared because his attack is insane.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.440
I do not like his attack.

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.440
Okay, that was lucky.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.440
This is not lucky.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440
That's not lucky at all.

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440
I really would like...

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.440
I would really like a chance to survive, please.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440
I really don't want to lose right at the end.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440
I'm going to be so sad.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.440
There was a guy there.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.440
I didn't realize he was there.

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:53.440
Toxic Shock is definitely helping do some damage, which I'm glad because we don't have a lot.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.440
Damage and taking damage, taking damage shoots away to assure.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.440
See, I...

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.440
That was four.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.440
I'm kind of stranded because my car broke down and my phone's almost there.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.440
That's like...

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.440
Are you called...

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.440
Are you called a mechanic or whatever?

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.440
Nah, I believe you.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.440
You can win this easily.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.440
Wait, they're real.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.440
I thought it was just a joke.

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.440
You only lost one red heart, but I don't have any red hearts now.

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.440
Are you scared?

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.440
It means I have very low soul hearts.

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.440
Because we had four red hearts, so we're now missing four hearts.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440
And I'm taking damage in every room.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Like a dum-dum.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.440
Okay.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440
Were we just saved?

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.440
Oh.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.440
Turns all troll bombs into safety ones.

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.440
Well, I'd rather take the safety ones.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.440
Did we just get saved by Cricket's Head?

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440
I think we did.

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.440
I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440
I'm not even kidding.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440
I'm gonna pop this instantly.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:13.440
Okay.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440
I think we just got saved by Cricket's Head.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440
Holy moly.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.440
I'm gonna just spam my wee bombs.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.440
Now the purple might wrap around.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.440
Okay, we're gonna spam the bombs.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.440
Whoa.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440
Okay, see, that's what I didn't like.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440
I'm just gonna spam bombs.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.440
There's nothing wrong with the bur-bur-bur spamming.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.440
None wrong with spamming the bombs.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.440
Okay, we actually did it.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.440
Sure.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.440
Let's do a victory lap.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.440
The lamb can't kill you with shielded tears, mommy.

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.440
I don't believe in myself.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.440
Okay, seller one.

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.440
Right, we are just gonna do one run.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.440
Oh my god, we're so strong.

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.440
Okay, now we can be picky and choosy.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440
Continuum, absolutely.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.440
I love continuum.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.440
Very good.

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.440
We now actually have range.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.440
Let's go.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.440
Adult and adult?

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.440
No.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.440
I don't wanna take these.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.440
Yucky.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.440
Stinky.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.440
Right, so we're doing what's called a victory lap,

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.440
which means you basically get to go again

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440
and keep all your items,

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:27.440
which is pretty cool.

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.440
So we might get a chance to get-

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.440
Oh, we got BFF.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.440
I forgot about that.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.440
Okay, we're gonna go to the room.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:35.440
And we're gonna grab this.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.440
Spectral tears and flight.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.440
Yep, we're gonna grab it.

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.440
So this is where things get super OP

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:45.440
and things get super duper easy.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.440
Which is exactly why I like this.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.440
I'm gonna take BFF.

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.440
We'll take Buddy in a box.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.440
Why not?

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:55.440
We'll try and get the conjoined transformation.

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.440
If you get Mum's pills, why not?

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.440
Range up.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.440
Health up.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.440
Balls of steel,

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.440
which gives you two soul hearts and power pill.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.440
But yeah, this is the cool part about Isaac.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.440
It means more time with moment, yeah.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.440
We're gonna do this.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.440
Now, normally you could just obliterate through it.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.440
Sadly.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.440
Wait, what's going on?

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440
Oh, whoops.

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440
He wasn't taking-

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.440
He wasn't taking the health I thought he was taking.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.440
You didn't see that, okay?

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.440
You didn't see that.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.440
You didn't see that.

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.440
That was rather embarrassing.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.440
I wasn't paying attention, okay?

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.440
I wasn't paying attention.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440
We could grab the heart in here.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440
Fill damage, yeah.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440
Whoopsies.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440
I wasn't paying attention.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.440
Thank goodness we're OP.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:02.440
Oh, health up.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.440
Oh well.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
Maybe we can get a-

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.440
Oh, look at that continuum already.

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.440
Looking spectacular.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440
Don't mind the fuzz, please.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.440
Can I get an item?

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.440
Come on.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440
Give it to me, Rachel.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440
Show it to me, please.

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.440
Yeah, this is why I adore-

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.440
What was it?

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.440
Radiation?

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440
Toxic shock?

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440
It's just so good.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.440
Come on, give us-

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.440
No.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.440
Flight for the room.

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:39.440
We've already got flight.

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.440
Mommy's throwing!

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:41.440
No, I'm too OP.

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.440
I need to level the plane field, okay?

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.440
But yeah, look at that.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:46.440
Oh, so satisfying.

01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:49.440
Did you know that if you don't attack,

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.440
we fly then it'll buzz away

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440
and you'll get an item on lock?

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.440
Leviathan, speed and damage.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.440
Like, this is what we're talking about.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.440
14.37.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.440
Damage.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.440
We'll go next.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.440
I like Super Meat Boy when he's fully transformed.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.440
It's so good.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.440
Do your best, mommy.

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.440
I will!

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.440
And we're gonna do so MLG in this game.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.440
Okay.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.440
Again, a room with nothing.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.440
Oh wait, we can go in here.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.440
Okay, let's see.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.440
Can we get so hard?

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.440
Stompy.

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.440
So hard.

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.440
Balls of steel.

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440
And we've got El Diablo.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.440
Oh, it's so satisfying

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.440
when you do a frickin' victory lap.

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.440
I'm so sorry.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440
If you're ever bored of Isaac,

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440
do a victory lap.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.440
It's just like, oh, that's right.

01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.440
I'm mowing you all down

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.440
and there's nothing you can do about it.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.440
Take it.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.440
Whoa, we got C-section?

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440
Hold on.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.440
Oh my gosh, the babies are cute.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440
Look at the electricity coming from them.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.440
C-section is like an insane amount of damage.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440
And they have homing.

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440
That's right.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.440
The babies will home to you.

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440
Nah, you just need a tears up.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440
Birth rate?

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440
All future floors will contain

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440
an upgraded arcade room.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440
What?

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.440
That's so cool.

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.440
What's that?

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.440
Full health.

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.440
Full health.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440
I'm not going to spend my money

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440
because I've been spending another shot.

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.440
Oh, toxic shot just took over there.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.440
Right, that was a shot, wasn't it?

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.440
Unfortunately, we do have...

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.440
Oh, that's a sticky penny.

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440
You can't pick it up.

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:56.440
Unfortunately, we do have the curse...

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.440
What curse is it?

01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.440
The no mapping curse.

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.440
But I think I know where I'm going.

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.440
I think I trust myself.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.440
Let me grab this.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.440
But look.

01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.440
Looky, looky.

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.440
All done.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.440
Sure, we've got conjoined.

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440
Yay!

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.440
Shoot normal tier 7 pair of damage.

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.440
I mean...

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.440
Did we just take him?

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.440
I feel like we replenish our health so quickly.

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.440
There's no point in like skipping.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.440
I feel like I'm feeling it.

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.440
Okay.

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.440
C-Section and Shield of Tears is dumb

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440
because they keep firing homing Shield of Tears.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.440
Never seen that item after 200 hours of this game.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.440
What one?

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.440
Oh, your profile picture is my eyeball.

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.440
I recognize my own eyeball anywhere.

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.440
Don't forget to use your item.

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.440
Yes.

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.440
I popped that mouth like bang.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440
I gave it that hook too.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.440
Okay.

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:04.440
Look how big my little guys are.

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.440
They're so big.

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.440
No.

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.440
I'm just...

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.440
We could honestly just speed it to the fight again.

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440
I like taking my time, you know?

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440
It's not all about a race.

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.440
Sometimes it's about the drone.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:27.440
And now I'm mad I dropped that trinket

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.440
because it didn't occur to me I could do a victory lap.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.440
But it was the best thing to do at the time.

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:44.440
So we just accidentally skipped an entire floor.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:50.440
Telepills has a chance to take you to the error room.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.440
Which is what I managed to do successfully.

01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:59.440
I don't know why that one broke my mantle,

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.440
but the other ones didn't.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440
Oh well.

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440
That's unfortunate.

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440
I did not expect a...

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.440
I am error room from that.

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:16.440
Well, we might get a planetarium.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.440
You know what?

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:18.440
We might get a planetarium.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.440
Spawn's a devil beggar, sure.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.440
I don't have health.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.440
You're asking the wrong Isaac player for health right now.

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:31.440
I'm gonna pop my ult.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.440
Now we do have...

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.440
We got fun guys.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.440
So I get a size down and I get range and speed up.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.440
So my hitbox is like smaller.

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440
My...

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440
My followers are bigger than me.

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:49.440
My little...

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.440
Familiar, it's not follower, sorry.

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.440
Are literally bigger than me in the game.

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:57.440
I love being tiny, it's so cute.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.440
The gate.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.440
You have type cent chance to ignore damage.

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.440
Oh, I forgot about that too.

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:08.440
Right, so we're supposed to have upgraded arcades now.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.440
Is this the upgraded arcade experience?

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.440
Because it doesn't look like it.

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440
I can tell you that much.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440
Look, shite.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.440
Damn right we are.

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.440
I love being tiny, it's another way to say that you like...

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.440
Giant?

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.440
Why do you think there's a giant here?

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.440
Why do you think she can be as tall as a skyscraper, huh?

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.440
I made it that way.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.440
Did I use my ult?

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440
I'm just gonna pop it.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.440
I can never remember.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.440
The damage, I know.

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.440
And it's only going up every time we get more money.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440
Money.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.440
Money.

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.440
Call me Mr. Krabs.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440
Okay.

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.440
Gonna let the game do its thing.

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.440
I do have a sock.

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:09.440
Now the explosion can hurt me, but it's a homing explosion though.

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.440
How kill was that?

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.440
What do you mean it's super dangerous and I shouldn't do it?

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.440
What?

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.440
Oh come on, we're just having fun.

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440
What do you mean this is so risky and I shouldn't have picked that up?

01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:23.440
Oh come on, live a little.

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:26.440
You're such a worrier little weak one.

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.440
No way.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.440
Pop ult.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.440
Gumpers?

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.440
We got gumpers.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.440
Yup.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.440
And we got gimpers.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.440
We're in a gimp suit.

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.440
Any hero members?

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.440
We've got a gimp mask.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.440
I'm not even kidding.

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440
It's actually in the game.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.440
Perfection.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.440
That's a big boy.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.440
Gen 1, the crater is barely disguised.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.440
Pink.

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:00.440
Honestly.

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.440
It was so fun.

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:12.440
Now I'll also say Gen 2 is not being created in my image with my particular interest in mind.

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:25.440
However, depending on a few things, it's very unique what we're appealing to.

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.440
What's the rib of greed?

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:29.440
5% more coins and fewer hearts from room clear.

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:31.440
Greed and super greed no longer appear.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.440
I mean, sure.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.440
Whoa, what did I just...

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.440
Experimental.

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.440
Shot speed up.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.440
Let's go.

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440
Not good.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440
I like it.

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.440
Considering how your luck was at the start, this is quite a turnaround.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.440
And whose image is it created?

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440
The janitor?

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.440
No, the concept.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.440
I submit what I want.

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.440
I'll show you how it works behind the scenes.

01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:58.440
But I submit what I want and either I get it or not.

01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.440
And I just send an art focus board.

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.440
Again, with the second concept artist, I sent her a board of stuff I was interested in.

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.440
She sent me back her version of that.

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440
Does that make sense?

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.440
That makes sense.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440
That's English.

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.440
That's how it's been done.

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.440
But again, I'll show you all the behind the scenes.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:27.440
Obviously, Gen 1 was a bit chaotic because it was my first time ever doing anything like that.

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:30.440
So, it was rather...

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.440
It was a stressful time.

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.440
Let's put it that way.

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.440
But the reason why I'm so happy to talk about...

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.440
And uncomfortable to talk about Generation 2 is because...

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.440
It takes a year for...

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.440
God, balls of steel again.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.440
Again, it gives us two soul hearts, which is just fantastic.

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.440
God, birthrate on Cana's Bazaar.

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.440
I don't have time for these machines.

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.440
They're going to take too long.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.440
You know those flames can spawn hearts?

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.440
I didn't... when bombed?

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.440
No.

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.440
What's in here?

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.440
La bomba.

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:19.440
Now, if I could get blue fly from the shop, that would be great.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:21.440
Hive mind, not blue fly, sorry.

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.440
Hive mind.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.440
No.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440
But nice try.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.440
Made in mommy's image.

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.440
Gotta love the wounds.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.440
I'm not reading that one out, but you're welcome.

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.440
It's literally like top tier.

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.440
Sorry, I don't care what anyone says.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440
That's weird.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440
Good thing it's fantasy then.

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440
Smile.

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.440
Upon death, we spawn Isaac in the same room with half a heart.

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.440
Speed and massive size then.

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.440
Wait, so I can be a tiny baby?

01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.440
Wait, you didn't know about the blue flies giving blue hearts when blown up?

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.440
They are very much like a ball.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.440
You didn't?

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.440
Wait, what?

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.440
You didn't know about the blue...

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.440
Oh, the blue fire is giving soul hearts.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.440
Yes, no, I knew about that.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.440
She says that she walks right into it.

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.440
No, I did know about that.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.440
Why not?

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440
We might as well do this.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.440
I'll blitz this over you.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440
Yeah, good luck surviving this.

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.440
Yeah, that's right.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.440
Now we do the boss fight.

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.440
Unless we want to do the angel.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.440
I can be your angel or your devil.

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.440
I can't see shit.

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.440
Yeah, it does happen.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440
Let's not waste too much time.

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.440
I don't want to waste your time.

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.440
I want it to be entertaining.

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440
I want it to be peak.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440
I want it to be high.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.440
Conga time.

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.440
Like, game Isaac be like,

01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.440
we go up this time?

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.440
Yes, we can go up.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.440
Hey, we can get shooting orbital.

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.440
Oh, that's so good.

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.440
Oh, thank you, game.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.440
No, really, you shouldn't have.

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.440
You should not have.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:09.440
Just keep that.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.440
Strongly move ball.

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.440
Cathedral music is my fave in the game.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.440
I really like,

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:19.440
is it Ghana?

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.440
No, wait, that's the country.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:23.440
Hold on.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440
The mausoleums?

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.440
It's not Ghana.

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.440
I'm sure that's the country.

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.440
Yeah, Ghana is the country.

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.440
Gehena.

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.440
Gehena?

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.440
That sounds exactly.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.440
Powerpill.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.440
No, thank you.

01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:43.440
Gehena.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.440
Any Gehena

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440
rappers?

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.440
I don't know if I should do that.

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:51.440
No, go all out on El Diablo.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.440
Is it country?

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.440
You're probably talking about...

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.440
Yes, okay, outside.

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.440
Oh, wait, we're already on the last floor?

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.440
No, our last shop.

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:02.440
Cannot be.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.440
Don't say such things to me.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.440
I'm enjoying this run.

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440
But yeah, if you play victory lap,

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:13.440
you can pretty much ignore everything.

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.440
If you won once, you can, you know, do it again type thing.

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.440
Wow.

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:22.440
Oh, wait, it's not open.

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:23.440
Open.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.440
Open.

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440
I just let the flies deal with them.

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:31.440
Please open.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.440
Thank you.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.440
Another victory lap.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440
No.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.440
Okay, we'll take Poki Gold.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.440
If clearing a room would yield the reward,

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:40.440
it gives you coins.

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.440
Sure.

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.440
Okay, maybe one more victory lap.

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:44.440
Just a little one.

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.440
No.

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440
I don't want one makes you larger.

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:51.440
You suck.

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:53.440
I'm back to being normal size.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.440
Okay, maybe...

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.440
We know where the secret rooms are,

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.440
because we just picked up Tuesia map.

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.440
Wow.

02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.440
What's in here?

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.440
A bomb.

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.440
Okay, so that was a waste.

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.440
We're not getting many bomb drops.

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:15.440
That's my only ditches of my complaint.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.440
Oh my God, you're complaining about the game

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.440
that you're smurfing right now?

02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.440
Yeah.

02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.440
What?

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.440
See, if we had Keeper's sack,

02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.440
I would have picked this up possibly,

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.440
but I do like that we have infinite health.

02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:29.440
I'm not sure.

02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:34.440
Any bombs?

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:36.440
Pills.

02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:37.440
Two soul hearts.

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.440
Adult.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.440
50% to try and die.

02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:43.440
The die appears only then the die doesn't pick up.

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:49.440
Balls.

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.440
One makes you larger.

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:51.440
One makes you larger.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440
Do we want that?

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440
I don't think so.

02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.440
I've not used it, so I don't think I want it.

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.440
Because that's how it works, right?

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.440
If you've never used it before you.

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.440
I think there might be a secret room.

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.440
There's not.

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440
I was going to say,

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.440
how have I not consumed all the pills yet?

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.440
I feel like...

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.440
I've seen them all at this point.

02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:15.440
Day's fast proof.

02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.440
Mummy, can you check for marked rocks at all?

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.440
I'm full health.

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.440
Is that naughty of me to ignore them?

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:27.440
Oh, we got boss rush.

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440
Sure.

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440
Do you want me to go up, right?

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.440
You wanted me to go up.

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440
Let's go get this.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440
And then we'll do boss rush.

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440
Yeah, that's perfect for what we need.

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440
No effect from BFF.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.440
Stinky.

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.440
And then boss rush is in here.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440
Ready?

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.440
Right, we can take...

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.440
Taking damage reduces.

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.440
So that's kind of like the way for it.

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.440
Isaac's movement.

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.440
Charges forward.

02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.440
Dies in one hit.

02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.440
Oh, that's terrible.

02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.440
Um...

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:02.440
I guess this is technically the way for after one hit.

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.440
Abel, my brother that I perished.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.440
We'll do the sea bomb.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.440
They're already perishing.

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.440
I can't remember how many rounds there are,

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.440
but I think there's like eleven or something.

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440
But we'll...

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.440
We're just gonna send it.

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.440
To no one's surprise,

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.440
we're just gonna spam upwards.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.440
Boss rush?

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.440
More like massacre, exactly.

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440
Um, if you are trying to get unlocks,

02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.440
unfortunately victory lap,

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.440
like this doesn't count for unlocks.

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.440
So don't...

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.440
Don't think you've got a way out.

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.440
I thought I was so smart doing this.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.440
I was like,

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440
I will get all my unlocks to be a victory lap,

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.440
because how can anyone naturally get boss rush?

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.440
Uh, no.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.440
I...

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.440
My first boss rush was on Eve.

02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.440
I accidentally got it on her without realising.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.440
I was like,

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.440
Oh, what's this room?

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:03.440
Uh, and...

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.440
Yeah, basically stress myself out to high heaven.

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.440
Who...

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.440
Who or where is this enemy?

02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.440
Ah, there we go.

02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.440
At least give them a chance, you bully.

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.440
No, I need my full health.

02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.440
Give full health or perish.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440
Could you imagine you end up doing enough victory laps

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.440
to the point the game crashes?

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:27.440
Well, funny you mentioned that.

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.440
If you do enough victory laps,

02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:32.440
the game actually starts removing your items.

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.440
And then you become the lost.

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.440
It's really bizarre.

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:38.440
It just happens.

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.440
I do not want chocolate overridden by C-section.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.440
Damage scales with the charge time.

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440
Wait.

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.440
It's overridden by C-section.

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.440
Yeah, so I keep C-section.

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:57.440
No, I don't want to add to the charge time.

02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.440
What did I just pick?

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.440
Did I pick something up there?

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.440
Health up.

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:05.440
Sure.

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:06.440
Sure.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.440
One singular health up.

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:08.440
Chucky milk.

02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.440
Name a more iconic duo then.

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:10.440
Oh, hey, what's this?

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:13.440
An incoherent stream and I'll scream and I'll wait.

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.440
You're always stressing.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.440
I mean, one of them is bar.

02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:17.440
It's not really useful.

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:18.440
Yeah.

02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.440
I think we'll pass on Chucky milk because that...

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.440
I don't know.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.440
It says chargeable tears.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.440
Damage scales with charge time.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.440
Wait, no.

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:29.440
If it comp...

02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:30.440
Does it complement?

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.440
Maybe it complements?

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.440
I have no idea.

02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:36.440
It didn't really state it changed anything.

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.440
Sure.

02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.440
Let's go.

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:42.440
I don't know if I made it worse or better.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:44.440
Somebody come get her.

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.440
She didn't just like us.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.440
We go arcade with this.

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.440
And of course, I can't see my health.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.440
Because why would I be able to?

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.440
I'm going to pulp this to make sure that we get our Chucky item.

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:02.440
No, we need more damage.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.440
I do need more damage.

02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:05.440
I can hear my data weak.

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:07.440
He's making a call for me.

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.440
Make me a T-ball yet out of me.

02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:15.440
Okay.

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.440
We might be able to get an item out of this.

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.440
Nope, that was wishful thinking.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:22.440
We do love a bit of wishful thinking around these parts, don't we?

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:23.440
Yes.

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:25.440
So actually, this is a little thing.

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:29.440
So you see how we can see top right the other secret room?

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.440
Because it's a super secret room.

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.440
That's an indicator.

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.440
It's actually where the boss fight is.

02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:39.440
I did consider it.

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440
It's very plausible.

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:51.440
I think my landlord is nice enough to let me install a temporary pool.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.440
I mean, I put a damage up a bit.

02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:58.440
Give us film towel kits.

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:02.440
Oh yeah, we should be picking up money because we have...

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.440
That pool.

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.440
Your dad would make you tea.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.440
Yeah.

02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:14.440
It's kind of custom.

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.440
You know, you make your family member a cup of tea.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.440
Like when you go, do you want a cup of tea?

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440
You offer it to each other?

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:21.440
Who or where?

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440
Whoa!

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.440
Oops.

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:29.440
Oh, we get mother transformation as well.

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.440
Yes, mother.

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.440
Oh, random rune shard.

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:38.440
We're going to step over art tile.

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.440
Maybe we'll get...

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440
No, that didn't work.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440
Well, we tried our best.

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440
I can't always work out.

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440
Whoa!

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.440
17.68.

02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.440
This is getting astronomical.

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.440
Two soul hearts.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440
I'll hold on to you.

02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.440
I'm going to hold on to that.

02:07:58.440 --> 02:07:59.440
100%.

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.440
Thank you for the tip, really legend.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:06.440
I definitely considered for 3D.

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.440
I'm not going to pretend otherwise.

02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.440
Definitely considered.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.440
More damage because reasons.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440
Why, yeah.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.440
A library again?

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:19.440
Oh, wow.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.440
You can pop this one because it gives us a wee familiar.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:27.440
Oh, I've got a wee fly that goes around me.

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.440
Save first.

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:33.440
Imagine.

02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:34.440
Interesting.

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.440
Here I come.

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:37.440
It's common that the younger one serves the older one.

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.440
Not in my household.

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:48.440
We're just kind of like mom's pearl.

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.440
No, that's definitely not my household.

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.440
Everyone's just nice to each other's smile.

02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:56.440
It doesn't matter when you were born.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440
Because that's like cheesy doodling.

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:02.440
I was born for...

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.440
It's giving I was born first.

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.440
That's what children argue on the playground.

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440
I was born first.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:09.440
You have to be nice to me and do as I say.

02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440
No, that's not how it works.

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.440
Not from around these parts.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440
Not from around here.

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.440
Age has no correlation to how nice you can be.

02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:23.440
I mean, we don't need it.

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.440
But we're going to take up the money.

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.440
Because it's not about the money, money, money.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.440
I don't see the appeal of pole dancing.

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.440
You don't?

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:41.440
Isn't it like normal dancing?

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.440
No, it's like supposed to be all...

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:46.440
Have you never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.440
You've never been to the Unicorn Palace in GTA?

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:53.440
In no way.

02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:54.440
In no way.

02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:57.440
3D Ring Fit Adventure Stream.

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.440
I do have a Ring Fit coming out next week.

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.440
Next week.

02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:06.440
But yeah, if I get 3D, I'd 100% be down.

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.440
I'll pop my ult, but I don't think I need it.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.440
Sure, let's go in the secret room.

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.440
So again, we can see where the other secret room is.

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.440
And it's an indicator that most likely...

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440
Who or what did that?

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:23.440
Oh, not up to it right now.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:26.440
I'm going to pop this guy so we can get increased.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.440
Yeah, there we go.

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:29.440
A 1 tooth piece.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.440
Imagine...

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:35.440
Oh, we get damage up for it.

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.440
Let's go.

02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:40.440
19 damage.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:42.440
Hair tier.

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:47.440
And that doesn't even include all of the other effects that come with it.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.440
I'm surprised we're actually getting room cleared.

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.440
Wait, the boss room isn't this way?

02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440
I can't believe that I've been lied to.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:58.440
Reduces all Devil deals to a heart.

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.440
It doesn't reduce the other ones though.

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.440
No, I've actually...

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.440
My item I've got right now...

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:05.440
I use Black Feather.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:10.440
Every evil item I own, my damage goes up by 0.5.

02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.440
And because we're taking tons of Devil deals, it's going up.

02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:21.440
I'll pop my ult.

02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.440
Okay, well, I shouldn't have.

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:24.440
But I did.

02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.440
Whoa, we get fire rate up and 3 coins.

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.440
I think he just passed the boss room.

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.440
I saw a health bar on the screen for a moment.

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:39.440
No, that can't...

02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.440
It doesn't work like that, you goober.

02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:43.440
You're teasing me.

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.440
That's not how it works.

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.440
Oh wait, why does it go that way?

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.440
Okay, let's...

02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.440
Oh, we're at 20 per tier now.

02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:00.440
Oh, will we do Hush?

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.440
Let's do Hush.

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.440
Oh, it's Dark Bomb.

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:07.440
Okay, you come in and then...

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.440
Killing an enemy has a chance to spawn the ghost.

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.440
Here, you come in too.

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.440
And then we'll go do Hush.

02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.440
So Hush is the last time Isaac breathes.

02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.440
Hush can't fight back because of the shielded tears.

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.440
Hey, Stony, can you kill the boss again?

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:28.440
I blinked.

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.440
Yeah, I can kill that boss again.

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.440
Oh, that was a good kill.

02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.440
Oh, I had balls of steel on me.

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:44.440
Oh, the music's on.

02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:45.440
It's the music's on.

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.440
We've already got last...

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.440
Wait, how did it double up?

02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.440
Would it have just become bigger?

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.440
No, I wouldn't.

02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:59.440
So normally there is a crawl space in these rooms.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.440
I do say the term normally in quotation marks.

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.440
Okay, I do say the word normally there's a hidden...

02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:19.440
Oh, grants immunity to explosions and damage.

02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.440
Okay, normally there's a hidden crawl space.

02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.440
Normally...

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.440
Yes!

02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.440
There we go.

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.440
Normally there's a hidden crawl space.

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.440
And we got Hush.

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.440
Okay.

02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.440
I love how Stony plays the same game over and over.

02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.440
She just let me through for real though.

02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.440
Bandit only took me like...

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:47.440
Chose between two items?

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.440
No, that's terrible.

02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.440
I think I'm better just keeping my minions.

02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.440
I'll pick up a tally pill.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:02.440
Right, we are ready to take on old Hush.

02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.440
If you look at the wall decorations, you can see the faces of the enemy.

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.440
Roll a d4 for the memes.

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.440
Are you kidding?

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.440
I've never had such a good run.

02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.440
That's kind of funny though.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.440
Maybe we go to Delirium.

02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:22.440
What we do, Delirium?

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:23.440
We could.

02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:24.440
Where is we?

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:26.440
Get over here.

02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:33.440
A monkey on a pool.

02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:36.440
Well, you need to give me time to learn.

02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:37.440
Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:39.440
You need to give me time to learn.

02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:44.440
But, I mean, a bit of cheeky 3D tracking on.

02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:45.440
Get me going.

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:48.440
We roll your whole bill, should we?

02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:53.440
Right, how about we go take on Delirium.

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.440
And I'll re-roll my whole bill.

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:02.440
I'm gonna not go well at all.

02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:05.440
I'm not even paying attention.

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.440
I'm just spamming.

02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:07.440
I don't even know if I've lost any health.

02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:11.440
Look at the purgatory just going crazy.

02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:13.440
See all those little red guys?

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.440
Oh, is that why I'm getting fed pills by a dark bum?

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:26.440
Alright, we'll re-roll into Delirium and see what happens.

02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:29.440
I'm gonna regret it so much, but why not?

02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.440
Whoa, he's crying.

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.440
Don't cry.

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.440
Or should?

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.440
Maybe I shouldn't re-roll.

02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.440
I'm scared.

02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:46.440
Do we have to re-roll?

02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:48.440
Okay, I don't want to do Delirium.

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.440
If we do Delirium, am I allowed to not re-roll?

02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:53.440
Because I quite like what I've got.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:56.440
I've got like Guppy, I've got Mum, I've got Flay,

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.440
I've got Spectre, I've got everything.

02:15:58.440 --> 02:15:59.440
Don't re-roll, don't re-roll.

02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:00.440
Okay, okay, okay.

02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:01.440
Thank you.

02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:02.440
Sorry.

02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:03.440
Right, well, do Delirium is...

02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.440
Thank you.

02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:10.440
I am doing a victory lap.

02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.440
That is why I have so many items on my Persons.

02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:21.440
That little flag means I am on a run.

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:25.440
I'm on a rune.

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:27.440
Speed up.

02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:28.440
I'm already...

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.440
My speed drives the telepills.

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:35.440
Oh wait, you can't get a...

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:41.440
I was gonna say you can't get an I am error with this kind of stuff.

02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:43.440
Alright, what's in here?

02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.440
We've got the Headless Horseman.

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:47.440
She's on a victory lap.

02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:48.440
Don't risk it yet.

02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:50.440
Well, do Delirium.

02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:51.440
Health?

02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:53.440
Don't really need health.

02:16:57.440 --> 02:16:59.440
Sure, we can open that.

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:01.440
Again, with Memic Chest, we can just straight up open them

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:09.440
because we have Holy Mantles, so it's not a problem for us.

02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.440
We are gonna get the Secret Room that's over here.

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.440
What's inside?

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.440
Absolutely nothing.

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:22.440
We've been trolled by the one...

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:26.440
Oh, well we'll take the money because again, we have deeper pockets.

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.440
We actually should be picking up every single penny, but I'm being lazy.

02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.440
Something's happening over there.

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:37.440
Debizzle can pick up all these.

02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:40.440
What just happened?

02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:42.440
Oh, nothing's getting me.

02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.440
What did you just throw at me?

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:46.440
I don't know what he gave me, but thank you for it anyway.

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:48.440
I'm quite happy with that.

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:51.440
Health turns off Polaroid.

02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:55.440
Yeah, I'm not gonna pick up any red.

02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:00.440
Again, we are gonna try and pick up as much coin.

02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:04.440
Got Toxic Shock because I've got so much damage.

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:08.440
Toxic Shock is actually killing enemies as we enter the room.

02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.440
I mean, I'll take a quarter.

02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.440
You don't have to tell me twice.

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:18.440
We just went up like a full mom's heart.

02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:25.440
Oh, tears. Absolutely.

02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:30.440
We can fly over everything.

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:37.440
Now, Delirium can only spawn...

02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:40.440
Strony Dominating is just natural.

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:41.440
So you admit it.

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:43.440
I'm a dumb. Got you.

02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:45.440
And 4 Key.

02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:48.440
You admit it yourself.

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:49.440
Thank you.

02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:51.440
There is a tentacle here.

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.440
Maybe an item.

02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.440
We got money. We got money.

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.440
We don't need that debuzzle, but thank you.

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:02.440
I've been in that room, so we'll go this way next.

02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:03.440
We'll pick up.

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:05.440
No, you big sub. How dare you?

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:08.440
You just admitted I wasn't.

02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:13.440
We get a stat up from this pill, whatever it's gonna be.

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:15.440
Luck.

02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:17.440
I think we've got enough luck for one day.

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:19.440
I'm gonna be honest, little guy.

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:23.440
Dumb only in this game.

02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:25.440
Mummy gets moonies.

02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:32.440
We're fully, we're fully all in on black hearts, actually,

02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:35.440
which makes us super potent.

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.440
And we got page 2, which means we do extra damage.

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:44.440
Now, I'm curious if delirium, because we know where the other secret room is.

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.440
If delirium is next to that secret room.

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:49.440
Adverture.

02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:52.440
If that is an indication.

02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:54.440
We're at 23 damage.

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.440
Can we get 24?

02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:00.440
Right, I'm gonna go up on purpose to try and collect as much money as possible.

02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:04.440
And get as much boss fights for extra items as possible.

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:08.440
Cheeky item? No.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.440
24 now, between every shot.

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:13.440
That's amazing.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:17.440
There's so much going on the screen, though.

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.440
Time to mega-mush in a rock bottom.

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:28.440
I don't have rock bottom unlocked, I don't think.

02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.440
I think you need to do boss rush Jacob and Isle on hard mode.

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:37.440
I don't even think I have rock bottom.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.440
I wish I could get rock bottom.

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:44.440
I'm so curious to unlock death certificate, but I'm so far away, so...

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:47.440
I really suck on Bethany.

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.440
I have a really hard time on that.

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.440
Where am I going?

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.440
Anonymous, thank you for the tip.

02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:06.440
I'm curious, do you spend time playing with someone special?

02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:10.440
Or would you say you're competitive gaming to win?

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:15.440
I...

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:16.440
I guess?

02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:21.440
Because I like playing with you guys, I'd rather have quality time playing multiplayer games.

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.440
If I'm not good at a game, I don't play it.

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:28.440
That sounds like such a sore loser, but I am.

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:32.440
If I'm not good at the game, I'm just like, what's the point?

02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.440
I suck.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:37.440
I don't want to put my time into something I suck.

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:39.440
But Elden Ring, for example.

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.440
I'm absolutely terrible at Elden Ring.

02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:44.440
I have never had so much fun playing a game.

02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:47.440
Commentate and stuff in my face.

02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:52.440
You guys make that game so fun for me, and you make it playable for me.

02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:56.440
Because if I had to play it the natural way, like the actual way...

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:02.440
I don't think I could enjoy it, so it's thanks to you guys,

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:07.440
I can literally enjoy a game that unironically wouldn't be accessible to me

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:12.440
due to my stubbornness of, oh, if I'm not good at the game, I'm not playing it.

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:17.440
Because I don't spend overwork myself,

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.440
and then go, oh, you know what?

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:23.440
I fancy getting absolutely demolished in a game for eight hours.

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.440
I don't really tickle my fancy.

02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:29.440
It might for some people, but for me, yeah, not really.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:32.440
That is a friendly enemy before you panic.

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.440
Please don't panic, guys.

02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:40.440
We've got two balls of steel pills, so I'm going to keep them on hold.

02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:42.440
We've already got max speed, so...

02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:48.440
Do you have any tainted unlocks?

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.440
I do, I will show you after we finish this victory.

02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:56.440
It's a turd, it's a brownie.

02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:59.440
That's kind of the point of Souls game.

02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:02.440
Well, I mean, I can enjoy it with you guys, so I don't count.

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.440
Really, alabaster box?

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:07.440
Right, you should be ashamed of yourself.

02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:12.440
More like, full of rubbish box.

02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:14.440
Thank you, I'll be here all week.

02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:17.440
Right, I'm purposely avoiding that last boss room,

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:20.440
but I think that's where our enemy resides.

02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:23.440
By the Pope.

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.440
I'd basically come to you and be like,

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:37.440
Riefling, I can't get past this part,

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.440
and then you have to come through and get me past it.

02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:45.440
And then 20 minutes later, Riefling, I can't do it.

02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:47.440
Thanks for the tip, Anonymous.

02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:51.440
Literally, you're trying to do your own gaming session.

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.440
I'm like, Riefling, please, I can't do this.

02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:57.440
Right, it looks like...

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:00.440
We're here.

02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:04.440
What the f...

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:05.440
What?

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:07.440
Emmanuel Coppa?

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:09.440
Coppa D's nuts and my mouth.

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.440
Thank you for the 50.

02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:11.440
Gluck Gluck.

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:12.440
Are you serious?

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:14.440
That's a lot.

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:16.440
Thank you, Emmanuel.

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:19.440
Jeez, Louise.

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.440
Wow.

02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:26.440
Thank you very much.

02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:28.440
So we're like a big brother to you,

02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.440
then playing the hard parts for you.

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.440
I mean, literally.

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.440
Yeah.

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.440
Thank you so much.

02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:38.440
Congrats to everyone who caught that with their faces.

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.440
You might have a prompt in chat.

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:46.440
That'll tell you, like, oh, I think Delirium's in that room, by the way.

02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:48.440
You might have a prompt in chat where you have to, like,

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:49.440
enable the thingy-ma-bobber.

02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:53.440
You just do that, and you'll hopefully catch it.

02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:56.440
I do have new emotes coming very soon to you.

02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:58.440
Very, very soon to you.

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:01.440
The girls are getting their emotes first,

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:03.440
because, you know, we can be patient.

02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:05.440
But thank you so much, Emmanuel Coppa.

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:06.440
That's crazy.

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.440
I'm still assigning people to even get the gifted membership.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:13.440
And thank you, Broly Legend.

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:14.440
Not gonna lie, I would love that.

02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:16.440
Yeah, you'd love carrying me in my games.

02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:18.440
Mummy's sitting on her lap as we help her.

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.440
Emote teaser.

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:22.440
Blast from the past.

02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:23.440
Are you squidding me right now?

02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:26.440
Stroney's the little sister that gets you to do the hard parts of the game,

02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:30.440
and in return, she does the hard parts for you.

02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:32.440
Ay, yeah.

02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:34.440
What's that mean?

02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:36.440
I don't think I know what I mean.

02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:38.440
Ah, shot and behavior.

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:40.440
Holy crap.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:44.440
Literally, it's still going, Emmanuel.

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.440
It's still going, right?

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:50.440
Hydration check.

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.440
That last part isn't for you.

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.440
Oh, of you, and does the hard parts of you.

02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:57.440
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.440
What a spammer.

02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:01.440
I can't believe it.

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:02.440
No, I'm kidding.

02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:03.440
Do not time anyone.

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.440
Jesus, are you joking?

02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.440
Congrats on the membership.

02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.440
Yeah, congrats on who caught it with her faces.

02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.440
Oh, crap.

02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.440
Thank you again, Emmanuel.

02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:15.440
It's 50.

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:16.440
50.

02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:17.440
That's a big number.

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.440
Okay, sometimes there's wee numbers,

02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:21.440
and sometimes there's big numbers, okay?

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:22.440
That was a lot of money.

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.440
How much money was that?

02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:28.440
Is that like $300?

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:34.440
Oh, God, that's insane.

02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:37.440
Thank you, all by Isaac.

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.440
Small loan of a million dollars?

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.440
Exactly.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:41.440
Yeah, okay.

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:43.440
Delirium was next to the secret room,

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.440
which is very curious.

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:50.440
Now, thankfully we do have lost contact,

02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.440
but Delirium...

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:53.440
Now, Edmick Muffin...

02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:54.440
Who goes there?

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:07.440
I mean, that sounds like a deal to me.

02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:10.440
Thank you, tiny spiny.

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:12.440
Oh, I just lost my holy mantle.

02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:14.440
Oh, no, I lost holy mantle and my blanket.

02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.440
I actually had two because I'm just so good at the game.

02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:18.440
Hold on.

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:20.440
I'm MLG pro-gaming.

02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:21.440
I'm not owl.

02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:23.440
I'm not even looking at the screen.

02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:24.440
I'm cheating.

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:28.440
Wah!

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.440
It's ogre.

02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:31.440
We're dead.

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:35.440
We did it!

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.440
We did Delirium.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:38.440
Wee!

02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:41.440
Oh, Parisic.

02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:48.440
Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:57.440
Oh, I like that.

02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:58.440
Hold on.

02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:02.440
No, I like that because I can information dump on Isaac

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:03.440
and be like,

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.440
Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.

02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:11.440
Thank you so much for getting me rock bottom.

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:13.440
I need to return the favor now.

02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:21.440
Isaac, my boy.

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:22.440
There he is.

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:23.440
We scale it in.

02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:25.440
Look at his repel this.

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:28.440
His wee hip bones are jutting out.

02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.440
Thank you, Anonymous, for the suggestion.

02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:31.440
Thank you.

02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:32.440
That is my concept now.

02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:34.440
I now own the legal rights to that idea,

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.440
and no one else is allowed to do it.

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.440
Copyright holder, scrawny culls.

02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:48.440
More like rockin' your bottom.

02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:50.440
So that's dad walkin' away on the hill, rip dad.

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.440
He's walking away forever.

02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.440
That was it.

02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:00.440
That's the binding of Isaac repentance team.

02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:04.440
Poor Isaacers, honestly.

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:07.440
Get her rock bottom so she can go down to your rock.

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:12.440
How long still until scrawny plays Roblox?

02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:13.440
I've never played Roblox.

02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:15.440
Now, I will say one thing.

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:17.440
I saw the funniest TikTok,

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:20.440
and it was like Roblox jumping course,

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.440
but you only jump by your mic getting activated,

02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:25.440
and I was like,

02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:29.440
could you imagine the noises all six of us would make on Roblox?

02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:30.440
Being like,

02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:33.440
whoa, whoa, like trying to get the mic to activate.

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:36.440
It would be absolutely a zoomer,

02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:37.440
but she's never played Roblox.

02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:40.440
Right, I'm gonna say something controversial,

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.440
but does Roblox no give you absolute five-year-old vibes?

02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:47.440
I've seen people roleplay as a cashier

02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:48.440
in a hairdresser in Roblox,

02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:49.440
and I'm like,

02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:51.440
I think this game's from the younger,

02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:54.440
young, young, youngins, you know?

02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:56.440
The ending song hunts my nerves.

02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:58.440
Jesus loves you.

02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:03.440
That's good, but the louder you scream, the higher you jump.

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:04.440
Roblox is like a kiddie game, I swear.

02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:06.440
Yeah, it's like younger, zoomer.

02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:09.440
Bro, it looks like it's for five-year-olds

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:11.440
that if they would get their first game,

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.440
I feel like that stream would get demonetized.

02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:16.440
But anyway, this is my save file,

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.440
so for my tainted characters,

02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:23.440
I've got tainted Isaac, Madeline, Cain,

02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:24.440
but as you can see,

02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:29.440
I have hardly achieved much and tainted.

02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:33.440
Oh, it almost gets me like,

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.440
that's where Dad's singing to us.

02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:38.440
But I've done Greed Mode.

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:40.440
I really like Greed Ear and Greed Mode.

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:43.440
I know a lot of people hate it, I don't mind it,

02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:46.440
but there are quite a few that I haven't done.

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:49.440
Like, I've not unlocked Tainted Eden.

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:51.440
Lost, yeah, surprise, surprise,

02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:53.440
I haven't got much about that.

02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:55.440
What about the death penalty?

02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:58.440
Lilith, Keeper, Polly on,

02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:01.440
The Forgotten, Bethany,

02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:04.440
Jacob is locked, I've not unlocked him,

02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:07.440
but yeah, my tainted isn't very good.

02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:10.440
Greed Mode, hey, taking Lilith to Greed Mode.

02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:13.440
I don't know, what's for your tainted version?

02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:16.440
Betrayal, Fetal Fury, and Jello.

02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:18.440
Jello's pretty strong.

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:20.440
Jello's a strong ba-ba.

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:23.440
Jello has ult lock as well, if I'm not mistaken.

02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:26.440
What, do you want to try a Greed on Lilith?

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:28.440
We can try it.

02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:31.440
I don't expect to win, but we'll try it.

02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:34.440
I always feel like clearing my safe and starting all over again

02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:35.440
when I watch streams of this game.

02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:37.440
Are you a god?

02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:40.440
Oh wait, no!

02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:43.440
I thought it was going to be Jello as an active item.

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:45.440
Oh no.

02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:48.440
We are not making it out with this one, Chief.

02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:52.440
Look how slow I am, I'm so sluggish.

02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:56.440
Yeah, we're not making it alive.

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:59.440
Oh, we have lucky, oh wait, you don't get pills,

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:01.440
you need bi-pills in this game.

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:03.440
Ooh, it's not happening.

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:06.440
Thank you Anonymous for the tip again if I didn't say thank you,

02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:09.440
because all I said was stealing your idea.

02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:12.440
You have Honing and a Whip that does three times damage.

02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:17.440
I mean, if it has Honing, there's a chance.

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:22.440
If it has Honing, come on Jello, if we can get BFF

02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:25.440
in Treasure Box, I assume.

02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:27.440
Oh my god, look at the...

02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:29.440
Go Jello!

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:31.440
Keep me safe down here.

02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:34.440
Wow, there's jobbies.

02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:40.440
But I do not suspect I will win,

02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:42.440
but that's not going to stop us, is it?

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:45.440
Come on Jello.

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:47.440
With that aimbot, come on Jello with that aimbot.

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:48.440
Hit him with it.

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:51.440
Don't shoot, just whip.

02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:52.440
Oh no.

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:54.440
Wait, are you sure?

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:56.440
Oh.

02:32:58.440 --> 02:32:59.440
Oh my god.

02:33:00.440 --> 02:33:01.440
Oh, you're so right.

02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:02.440
Wait, what hit me?

02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:03.440
I don't know what hit me.

02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:04.440
Something got me, I don't know what it was,

02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:06.440
but I guess I deserved it.

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.440
Oh my gosh.

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:11.440
Hit him with it, whip.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:13.440
Now watch me whip.

02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:15.440
Now watch me, that must have been made so many times

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.440
considering how old this game is.

02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:20.440
Yeah, dang.

02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:22.440
I'm so slow though.

02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:24.440
0.85 movement speed.

02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:27.440
I'm late, but I still made it.

02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:30.440
You're lucky I was fatigued enough to

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:32.440
commit to this game mode.

02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:33.440
I thought I was going to have my

02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:35.440
freaking treasure box

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:36.440
thinking my bobber, but I don't.

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.440
I've forgotten what Feetal Fury was

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.440
or what my passenger was.

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:43.440
Is that the tummy thing?

02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:46.440
I am whipping the crap out of this thing.

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:48.440
Wah.

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:50.440
Whoa.

02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:51.440
Juke.

02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:52.440
Juke, go away, Juke.

02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:53.440
Go away.

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:54.440
Go away.

02:33:56.440 --> 02:33:58.440
You have respect, my Paratain.

02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:00.440
Oh my god, I feel like Cartman

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.440
because I'm so slow.

02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:03.440
Okay, one more fight.

02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:05.440
We're going to ignore the devil

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:06.440
deals.

02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:08.440
We're going to go angel deals.

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:13.440
Oh wait, can Lilith only get a...

02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:15.440
Oh, well that was very unfortunate.

02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:17.440
Did not mean to lose that.

02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:18.440
Ooh.

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:19.440
No, I can get angel deals.

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:20.440
Okay, that's fine.

02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.440
We are a puppeteer now.

02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:26.440
I wonder how many even got that

02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:27.440
song reference.

02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:31.440
I feel like that was popular now.

02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:32.440
Watch me whip.

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:34.440
Watch me now.

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:36.440
Right.

02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:40.440
These are all pish.

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:42.440
That can get people.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:44.440
I'm probably going to regret this,

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.440
but I'm going to sacrifice...

02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:50.440
That's why I regret it,

02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:52.440
because you need to go in with sugar

02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:54.440
and spice and everything nice.

02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:58.440
Right, we'll take our monies.

02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:00.440
Oh, I thought Jill could pick up a heart.

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:02.440
But we cannot.

02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.440
Okay, let's go next.

02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.440
Let's go next.

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:06.440
Let's not hang around.

02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:08.440
Let's not beat around the bush.

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.440
Any beat-bushers?

02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:10.440
Any bush beaters?

02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:11.440
Sorry, I said it wrong.

02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:14.440
That song was in almost every vine

02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.440
bought back in the world store.

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.440
Right, we've got tier rate up,

02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.440
so does that mean the whip is faster?

02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:23.440
He's so fast.

02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:25.440
He's such a baby.

02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:28.440
Oh, we've got Haun.

02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:29.440
I like Haun,

02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:31.440
because he goes and does damage on his own.

02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:33.440
Anything that goes away

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:34.440
and does damage on its own,

02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:35.440
I'm like, are you?

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:44.440
Yeah, Jello's giving us the range

02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:45.440
to not be attacked.

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.440
Right, pick up the key first

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.440
and then grab Haun,

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:52.440
because I think Haun's a cutie pie.

02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:53.440
I like Haun,

02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:54.440
because he goes and attacks

02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:55.440
all the enemies for me.

02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:57.440
Are you?

02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.440
Wait, how does that work with Jello?

02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:04.440
Oh, he spits out.

02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:06.440
He spits out C-section.

02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:09.440
Oh, my gosh.

02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:11.440
I'm so lucky.

02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:14.440
Oh.

02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:17.440
Oh.

02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:28.440
I'm here for it.

02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:31.440
My yum heart.

02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:32.440
Yum yum.

02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:34.440
I like that.

02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:35.440
Thank you, Anonymous,

02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:37.440
for the suggestion and the tip.

02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.440
I need to write all these down.

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:39.440
I need to get, like, a document,

02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:40.440
because you guys give me

02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:41.440
such good suggestions.

02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:43.440
And I like making content

02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:44.440
that you want to hear

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:46.440
versus what I think you want to hear.

02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:47.440
Like, I'd rather...

02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:48.440
Oh, my God, Haun is getting it.

02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:49.440
Go, Haun, go.

02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:50.440
Go, Haun, go.

02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:53.440
I'd rather, like,

02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:55.440
feel more confident writing stuff

02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:56.440
that you guys, like, want

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.440
than me guessing that you want.

02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:00.440
I don't know how I didn't get hit there.

02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:01.440
I got...

02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:05.440
Right, we kind of need a bomb.

02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:11.440
Well, that's a bomb, all right.

02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:13.440
That gives us health and a bomb.

02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.440
Hmm.

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:16.440
I think that's...

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:18.440
Right, I know this seems crazy

02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:20.440
because it doesn't do anything.

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.440
The odds of rolling a bomb

02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440
are terrible.

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:29.440
At least we have unlimited bomb.

02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.440
Ooh!

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:32.440
That goes pepper's goods.

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:33.440
Nerd Girlfriend talks

02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:34.440
about Isaac Lowell doing it

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:35.440
the entire time.

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:36.440
Well, I really, like,

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:38.440
I'm surprisingly enjoying it.

02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:39.440
I don't know if you guys

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:40.440
like that.

02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:42.440
I'm surprisingly enjoyed

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:43.440
writing Ignore.

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:47.440
I'm so surprised I liked it

02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.440
because...

02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:50.440
But it does, like, have funny things

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:52.440
where I could, like, be playing a game

02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:53.440
in theory.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:54.440
Oh, no, that was terrible.

02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:56.440
Right, I'm not popping this anymore.

02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:58.440
In theory, it could, like,

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.440
lead Rise to me having to carry on

02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:01.440
with things like that.

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:04.440
Because it is just, like,

02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:05.440
a bit of goofing off.

02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:07.440
And I can be, like,

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:08.440
Girlfriend's addicted to

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:10.440
Binding of Isaac while she ignores

02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:11.440
but gives you free use

02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:13.440
ASMR, like, that kind of stuff.

02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:15.440
Oh, I'm too slow!

02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:17.440
How did I dodge that?

02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:21.440
I have no idea how I dodged that.

02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:22.440
That is hilarious.

02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:27.440
That was...

02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:29.440
I have no idea how that just occurred.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:32.440
I know I should be whipping,

02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:34.440
but I'm terrible, okay?

02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:37.440
We're gonna blow up an angel.

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:38.440
That sounds terrible.

02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:46.440
Okay, and then next...

02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:50.440
Okay.

02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:51.440
Oh, and we got a frickin'

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:54.440
and it's fearin' him!

02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:56.440
Come on!

02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:58.440
This is so good.

02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:00.440
And we can sacrifice health

02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:02.440
to get a bomb if we need a type thing.

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.440
Very nice.

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:09.440
Let me read the

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.440
suggestion again.

02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:22.440
Ooh, baby.

02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.440
Man, I've been an MVP, literally.

02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:28.440
Casually just

02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:29.440
Morgan everything.

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:30.440
Right.

02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:31.440
I

02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:32.440
can now go into the

02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:34.440
curse rooms without any issues.

02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:39.440
Some issues with the curse rooms.

02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:41.440
I'm so slow!

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:43.440
Please, no more bombs.

02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:45.440
No, I'm so slow!

02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:47.440
That's what I didn't want.

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:49.440
And it happened anyway

02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:51.440
because I'm too frickin' slow.

02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:54.440
Now...

02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:58.440
That's really good.

02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:00.440
I'm gonna take it.

02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:01.440
I know I probably shouldn't,

02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:03.440
but that's really good.

02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:06.440
Now, I can blow up

02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:08.440
like that.

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:10.440
Yeah.

02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:12.440
Okay, that's good.

02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:13.440
I'll take the penny.

02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:15.440
In for a penny,

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:16.440
in for a pound.

02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:18.440
Your mama.

02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:20.440
We are gonna blow him up as well.

02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:22.440
As I said, now that we can

02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:24.440
kind of sacrifice Red Heart

02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:25.440
for that.

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:26.440
Strony a snail.

02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:27.440
Honestly, snail confirmed for Jinto

02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:28.440
because that was

02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:30.440
absolute slow poke territory.

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:31.440
That was awful.

02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:34.440
I mean...

02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:36.440
We could maybe do one attempt

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.440
at the secret room.

02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:44.440
Okay, that was lucky

02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:45.440
because, yeah,

02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:47.440
I only had one chance.

02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:48.440
Can you hypnotize me

02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:50.440
to finally stop procrastinating?

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:51.440
That one's out of my

02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:52.440
experience level, chief.

02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.440
I'm afraid you're on your own

02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:54.440
for that one.

02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:55.440
I don't...

02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:00.440
It's happening again!

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:02.440
It's happening again!

02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:03.440
It's happening again!

02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:07.440
Oh, my lord.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.440
Oh, my lord.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:12.440
It's happening again!

02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.440
It's happening again.

02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:15.440
Okay.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:17.440
We now have a panic button.

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:19.440
We have a panic button.

02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.440
I repeat, we have a panic button.

02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:24.440
We're going to go as far as we can.

02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:25.440
But...

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.440
Yeah.

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.440
We've got Curse of Darkness,

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:30.440
which is a shame.

02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:34.440
Um...

02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.440
But we've...

02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:37.440
Okay, okay, hold on.

02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:40.440
Let him get up.

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.440
Can you grab that for me?

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:43.440
Jello, bring it...

02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:44.440
Jello, bring it over.

02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:46.440
Jello, bring it over.

02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:49.440
Right.

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:52.440
I am going to get that key.

02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:53.440
I'm just going to go and

02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:54.440
explode for it.

02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:56.440
Um...

02:41:57.440 --> 02:41:58.440
Well, we can maybe get a chance

02:41:58.440 --> 02:41:59.440
to get the secret room,

02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:01.440
which is exactly what I was hoping there.

02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:04.440
Huh?

02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:08.440
Two back-to-back...

02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:09.440
No, that can't be...

02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:13.440
My code is QQ3G80R2.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:15.440
We can't have both.

02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:16.440
No, we can't.

02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:18.440
I'm keeping the R key.

02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:20.440
Um...

02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:22.440
Where are you?

02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:23.440
Large orbital, the block shot.

02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:25.440
It splits into smaller versions.

02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.440
The smaller version breaking

02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:27.440
into blocks.

02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:28.440
I'm just going to go and

02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:29.440
explode for it.

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:30.440
It splits into smaller versions.

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:31.440
The smaller version breaking

02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:32.440
into blue spiders.

02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:33.440
Respawn.

02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:34.440
Okay, so kind of just

02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:35.440
spider, spider.

02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:36.440
Rider, rider.

02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:37.440
We're going to...

02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:38.440
We're going to go for it.

02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:39.440
We do have a...

02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:40.440
We can bomb the angel.

02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:41.440
If we get an angel,

02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:42.440
then we can get 100% angel deals.

02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:43.440
So we don't have to sacrifice

02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:45.440
any health for any of those

02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:46.440
good things.

02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:49.440
Oh, I'm too slow for this.

02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:51.440
I am too slow for this.

02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:54.440
We do have a chance

02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:56.440
for blue smoke as well,

02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:58.440
which is good.

02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:02.440
I'm going to pick up our weak lines.

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:04.440
Streamer luck.

02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:06.440
Actual streamer luck though.

02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:13.440
Actual streamer luck though.

02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:14.440
I was like,

02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:15.440
oh, I don't know if I can win this one.

02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:16.440
Well, you know,

02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:18.440
my confidence has gone up a little bit.

02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:19.440
I'm not sure why.

02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:20.440
Totally not because I've got an R key,

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.440
but streamer luck don't mean

02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:23.440
if I do.

02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:24.440
Okay, steady.

02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:26.440
I really do not want to lose

02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:27.440
my holy mantle.

02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:28.440
Although we could just leave

02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:29.440
the room and go again,

02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:30.440
can't we?

02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:31.440
Yeah,

02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:32.440
actually,

02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.440
I'm over-complicating things.

02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:34.440
Classic women women.

02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:35.440
Ah,

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:36.440
where is he?

02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.440
I'm just going to let them

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:38.440
kind of deal with them.

02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:41.440
Are you squidding me right now?

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:42.440
By the pope.

02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:44.440
I just wanted everyone

02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:45.440
to have a chance to

02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:46.440
have a chance to have a chance

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:47.440
to have a chance

02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:48.440
to have a chance

02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.440
to have a chance

02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:50.440
to have a chance

02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:51.440
to have a chance

02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:52.440
to have a chance to have a chance

02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:53.440
to have a chance to have a chance

02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:54.440
to have a chance

02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:56.440
to have a chance

02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:57.440
to have a chance

02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:58.440
to have a chance

02:43:58.440 --> 02:43:59.440
to have a chance

02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:00.440
to have a chance

02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:01.440
to have a chance

02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:02.440
to have a chance

02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:03.440
to have a chance

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:04.440
to have a chance

02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:05.440
to have a chance

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:06.440
to have a chance

02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:07.440
to have a chance

02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:08.440
to have a chance

02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:09.440
to have a chance

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.440
to have a chance

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:11.440
to have a chance

02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:12.440
to have a chance

02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:13.440
to have a chance

02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:14.440
to have a chance

02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:19.440
to have a chance

02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:26.320
We have a pirate. They're so fast. Oh my god. I shouldn't have done that. Why did I do that?

02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.920
They're so fast. I've just cornered myself.

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:41.200
I need to do this. Oh my gosh.

02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:46.560
Oh my gosh. I don't know how I got away with that.

02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:49.280
This is a scheduled and pre-recorded tip.

02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:55.600
No, it's not. Stop it. People are gonna believe you.

02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:03.760
Thank you Spidey for the tip. Never punish. She hates us. I don't hate you. What the heck?

02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:11.200
I haven't said anything. Right. We've got the key. So now we have 100% angel chances, which is huge.

02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:17.600
We got very lucky there. That could have gone really bad.

02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:24.720
Rather fortunate. You see? Oh, we've got actual bombs this time, so we don't need to keep hurting

02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:35.920
ourselves. Right. No point in deep poke. Wait, hold on. If I'm resetting, is there odds of me getting

02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:46.400
like a rune like Yara or something? Huh. Self-proclaimed Dom keeps foregoing and uses the whip, honestly.

02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:53.840
Right. Because we're gonna reset, this might be worthwhile to pick up. So I'm gonna do it

02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:59.600
against my better judgement. Taking damage has a 50% chance to spawn something. Not necessary,

02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:10.560
so I'm gonna just destroy this. Did you pick up that coin, but you didn't pick up the key?

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:24.720
I don't know. Nothing's really speaking out to me. I'm gonna just walk away and go next,

02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:33.520
because I'm not really, not really sure, am I? One good shop is all you need to do the infinite dopes.

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:36.800
She loves this lovely replay.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.840
Right, we did get the angel deal. Short speed, I'll take it. What's the card? Pickups? They're

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:54.240
turned into horror. Okay. Here for another NSFW concept. How about a solo audio for Patreon?

02:46:54.240 --> 02:47:00.160
Stromi reads some of the thirsty marshmallows from Reflings and becomes overwhelmed with lust.

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:06.960
She can't help but to inquire reading the Maros. So Patreon don't allow live recordings,

02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:08.880
but Twitter does.

02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:18.720
I'm very much thinking of doing a menu, which I think you guys will approve of.

02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:27.440
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I have fire. I can destroy these guys for free if one of them procs a fire.

02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:36.080
Come on fire, fire, fire. Give us fire. That's just what Twitter will do when she got shy, honestly.

02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:47.600
Twitter for the dub, yes. Don't be surprised if you see a lot of Twitter content over in August,

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:54.480
I will start taking it super duper serious. Wait, okay, wow. I forgot you could do that.

02:47:54.480 --> 02:48:02.080
Right, speed. Now, normally I wouldn't waste my breath on speed, but in this occasion,

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:08.160
thank you for the tip again. Hey, Stronny, it's me. Type view and aim here. Just here to watch

02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:14.640
my favorite Scottish streamer play. Insert whatever game Stronny's playing today. Good luck and enjoy

02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:22.000
the stream. Love the content. Delete remainder of message. This is DonoScript number 39.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:27.200
You know what's even worse? You trolling about with this, you creasing in your little chair. I'm

02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.080
about to release a short that's like, this is how much I earn to obviously like show that like

02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:39.200
the other, you know, something to worry about us. AI generated viewer response. Stop. And everyone's

02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:44.560
going to be like, oh, it's an industry plan. She's like faking the numbers or whatever. No one's going

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:54.400
to believe me. No one's going to believe the numbers when I show them. If our 49201, thank you

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:58.640
for becoming a member and all the numbers out there in your name. But thanks for becoming a member.

02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:06.080
Insert positive message here. I believe you. Stronny, you're going to have to punish chat.

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:08.640
Oh, well, you're getting punished because you didn't get nothing for three weeks.

02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:15.120
How's that for punishment? Oh, dear you. Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:20.400
I've got to go, mum. My phone is at 5%. I'm going to miss you.

02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:27.680
Okay. Thank you for hanging Broly legend. Rip your phone, Barry. 5%. You win as a fellow acoustic.

02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:35.200
I believe you. I can keep for three weeks. Okay. This is the cruelest punishment imaginable.

02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:40.000
Thank you. I can't believe I have to thank you. Thank you. Type Donator name here.

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:45.760
You're done. Right. I'm going to get the speed so we can actually, you know, not get wrecked and

02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:48.800
decked. Oh, I do love a bit of Damage.

02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:56.640
I'm going to grab a key. We are going to pick up that damage because that is well worth it.

02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:06.160
What are you? Taking damage can make invincible. Oh, and we can huff pills if we happen to unlock

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:12.640
any. Good luck. Yeah, hope your cargo will not explode. Smile. We have been infiltrated

02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:18.160
by the High Table. We need a purged room of A. Thank you. You could get a Rune Bag at some point.

02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:24.480
That is what I'm hoping for because we're going to have a reset. I'm like, hmm.

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:31.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back it up, man. Even the pot of speed, I'm still slow.

02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:36.880
I am good. That damage up is certainly going to help with our little C section, but

02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:45.600
these guys do not care. Oh, I hate everything about those guys. Come on, buddy. Okay, thank you.

02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:58.720
Oh, not you. Come on, haunt. Come on. I really need BFF. BFF would be so beneficial right now.

02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:01.600
I'm going to grab these right now.

02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:13.120
Oh, there's a ghost. I actually got him somehow. And I dodged the attack of that guy somehow.

02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.120
Well, the pregnancy is more to be followed up with C set. No.

02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:27.360
That artwork should actually be coming through soon. So that's going to be hilarious to write for.

02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:32.000
Actually, oh, dad, I'm going to wait and record. You need to be quiet. Oh, what are you recording?

02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:34.480
Pregnancy smart.

02:51:36.880 --> 02:51:39.280
He's going to be like, what the fuck are the reflins in there?

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:47.680
He's going to wonder if these are all okay. Okay, we're going to leave the room to get Holy

02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:54.800
Man all activated back again because we did on four. Shouldn't we just lose it there? Why are you so tiny?

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:08.720
Oh, I'm just spraying my little C sections because they will attach to anything they

02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:17.840
do get hold of. So it's not like bad. Oh, there's explosions. I'm getting them reddish boys ain't

02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:25.040
right, but perfect. Like my mom and dad knew I was a weird kid. So I'm sure they're not even

02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:31.120
surprised about any of the shenanigans I get into these days. There's like, yeah, yeah, that's

02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:31.840
strong. All right.

02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:42.000
Right, we're going to leave. I'm going to pick up damage.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.960
Health, but short speed down, but tears up.

02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:59.680
No, we deserve better than that refling. Your C section with them having C section on their own

02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:04.800
is horror material and play some weird stuff going on. Funny, you seem there's normal kids out there.

02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:10.880
Oh, I have 71% chance with Anna.

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:22.320
There's a difference. Oh, that's hilarious. I'm telling them you said that.

02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:32.880
We did not get your daughter pregnant. So that's amazing.

02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:41.760
Sorry, I'm trying not to lose any health. I really don't want to lose fully mental. I think we can

02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:45.200
get another angel deal. Praying it's a good one. Come on, give us

02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:54.400
what is it? Or give us full. Whoa. I don't, I think haunt.

02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:06.880
71% angel deal, by the way. 71% angel deal. You forgot the yet we didn't get your daughter pregnant

02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:14.480
yet. Reflings, you can't say that about the convention. We're getting trouble if you skip.

02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:21.360
I'm skipping. Give me these coins. Give me these coins.

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:26.800
Right, I'm going to blow up the machine because there's nothing I want in this

02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:35.520
lot. So just blow up. Whoa. Hold on. I'll take Seraphim.

02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:41.120
Yes. Yes, I will. Look at that. Whoa.

02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.640
Wait, no one say anything about the convention.

02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:54.160
Okay, I can't grab these coins. No, no, they have to leave.

02:54:54.160 --> 02:55:01.040
Yeah, it's a shame that D6 is getting ignored, but it is what it is.

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.760
A little flower, a little flowery.

02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:17.760
What are we looking at? Range, luck and a soul heart. I will absolutely take it. Are you joking?

02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.920
And we could just got five cents from that fire. Not bad at all.

02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:30.800
Are we skinny enough? Are you serious? Okay.

02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:39.840
I need fire to burn these guys. Come on. Come on fire. Oh, and I missed. Okay. Well, I'll try.

02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:49.440
Come on fire. Isaac got pranked. It hurts even though Archie has more value. Yes.

02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:52.000
The reason

02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:02.000
the stream is longer than I thought it would be. Yes, I am slightly addicted to Isaac.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.800
My pro dad's been up for a while. I'm just getting ignored right now.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:13.680
Today we're going to Bunnings, which is the equivalent of being cute. We need to hire a car.

02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:17.760
Go do a car rental because I don't drive. I ride a bike.

02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:33.120
Oh, come on. Bunnings is B and Q in Australia. And I'm picking up sand so my cats can shit in

02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:39.760
a sandbox. This is true. Oh wait, we have neutral pills. Health up and another health up. I don't

02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:52.160
know if I want too many red hearts though. Right, what are you? Sure.

02:56:54.480 --> 02:57:00.640
The stage transition nightmare shows the wrong items in greed mode. That's hilarious.

02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:09.600
Range and tier size. If the C-section babies are big. That's a good thing, right?

02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:18.800
No, so thankfully Bunnings isn't too far away, but that taxi driver was,

02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:25.840
he was on it. He must have been on the sniff or something because that was erratic driving.

02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:30.000
That was horrible. Although I will say one thing about me. It was nice enough to stop on

02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:34.480
the side of the road. Like we were on the fucking highway and I was like blabbering about like,

02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:40.640
oh, I'm going to get my dad's of the airport and all that. And I was like, I'm so sorry.

02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:44.880
I need to be sick. Can we please stop? And he stopped on the highway and you're not supposed to do that.

02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:53.600
How would it be a traditional Scottish ride and all the reef links and kick kills?

02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:59.520
Yes, that's when you wear kills that way. The booger sugar, that's such a good way to call it.

02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.800
Tier size. I think we'll do tier size up. Why not? I don't really want anything else.

02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:08.880
We will pick up the- Are you squidding me right now?

02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:15.840
No wonder those cheeks be clapping like crazy. You'll be working them thighs every day on the

02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:23.440
bike. Yeah, I ride a bike. I love my bike. I think riding bikes are cool. I may not be killed for you.

02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:28.800
Wait, what did you say at the end? I never heard it. What did he say? What did you say?

02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:36.560
I can't read it because I'm freaking in mid-match. I don't want to get whipped,

02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:40.880
but I'm pretty sure that I couldn't hear the end of it because I'm freaking trying to game.

02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:45.520
Okay, we're definitely leaving to get Holy Mantle back. I've messed up this one so badly.

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:51.280
Hold on. You get a spank in a minute.

02:58:51.600 --> 02:59:05.200
Oh, jeez, Louise. Come on, haunt. Take them on, haunt. Replay the voiceler. No wonder those

02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:11.040
cheeks be sitting on my face and letting me beat you. Wow, refling, that was so direct. I thought

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:15.760
you were supposed to be shy. I'm supposed to be my shy little boys, but you're not. You're feeling

02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:26.960
it today. Oh my god. Techpoint 5? Scottish culture. Doms, fanboys. Why are there so many people

02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:34.640
trying to make me wear a skirt? No, we don't. It's traditional. I guess meme done so much like,

02:59:34.640 --> 02:59:38.720
oh, it's got people wearing skirt. All right, what are you going to do? Shoot yourself? Sheesh.

02:59:44.480 --> 02:59:53.440
Oh, more damage. Yeah, we'll take it. More damage. All the damage. Right, we've got Holy Mantle back.

02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:02.560
Oh my god. Wait, so the tears are coming from my tummy, but the shots are coming from the end

03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:09.440
of Jell-O. That is very curious. Come on, haunt, and Jell-O.

03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:19.840
Ow, my mantle. You suck. Give me it back. Thank you for the tip, anonymous. If I didn't say thank

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:25.840
you, I'm so sorry. I'm getting distracted. I, for one, accept my kill future. Strani, please

03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:30.320
make an emote for a reflim wearing a kill. I will. Is that what you want? Because I think I have a

03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:35.920
few more spots left. Haunt, just having them in the corner. Oh, I'm going to hurt myself by accident.

03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:44.400
Are you serious right now?

03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:56.080
Converse all heart containers into black hearts. Oh, sure.

03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:59.520
Is that, then?

03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:11.200
Getting trolled. Pretty fly. For a white guy. Yeah. If we're doing a reset,

03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:15.360
might as well not. Well, I'll grab this pill, then. Change my mind. I want it.

03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:20.560
Hill. Up. Getting trolled by this game.

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:28.000
Someone else that says damage. I think it's a gamer term. No, is it not?

03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:33.680
Oh, I see it. A tinted rock.

03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.480
Yay. I'll pop this.

03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:49.440
Uh, right. We've got the high priestess card.

03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:55.760
Wearing a kill means fresh air down there. No smoke path. Yeah, you're not supposed to wear underwear

03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:06.240
with a kill. Okay, we'll play this one and then we hit reset after it. Or do we actually do the

03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:13.600
boss fight and then hit reset? I feel like we still could have got, whoa, guppers.

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:17.600
Well, not quite guppers, but you know what I mean. It's collar.

03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:27.120
Oh, you can just skip this floor? I'm not sure about that. Oh, no, there's no re-roll. I hate

03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.120
when they have no re-roll. Well, we're going to blow this up anyway, so we might as well take

03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:38.080
over to the guys and save ourselves some time trying to get that thing to pop its clogs.

03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:44.320
Two out of three for guppers though. Bunk. Oh, under.

03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:57.040
D20 can re-roll the... No, I don't want to. Maybe you can find two here. Well, I was just going to

03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:02.240
reset. I don't want to buy anything on this floor, so maybe we just play it and then reset.

03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:12.320
I was hoping to be a bit stronger in all honesty at this point, but we're not really...

03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:20.000
Oh, no, I have Hungie. I'm a Hungie boy.

03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:28.960
I will... Tonight, I'm having Steak, and my dad's cooking it, and he's cooking it well done,

03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:35.040
and I will not have any slander against well-done Steaks. It's okay to be wrong sometimes,

03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:44.000
Reeflings. It's okay to be wrong. Oh, we can actually proc all those guys for coin drops.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:49.280
Purly. Thank you for becoming a member. I hope you're not Purly though. I hope you are in good

03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:54.880
health and have long prosperity. Live long and prosper, smile. Whoa, wait, what was that? There's

03:03:54.880 --> 03:04:02.960
something in front of me. I never even saw him. Okay, let's... Yeah, let's burn...

03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:14.400
Yes, one more, and then we'll go out and get Holy Mantle. Come on, you want to give me the flame?

03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:20.960
There we go. Okay, spider's lovely. Bright woman needs immediate... medium steak correction. Also,

03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:25.040
respect for being a cyclist. I'm too scared to learn how to drive a car because I have terrible

03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:33.360
perception, and really, I am pretty certain that I would cause a collision of some kind. I don't

03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:39.840
know what kind. Most likely, a roundabout. Like, if I was gonna go, but the person in front of me

03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:46.880
didn't go, I'd just, like, rear-end them a roundabout. I don't... I do not trust my perception, so...

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:54.880
Yeah, my next is riding a bike, but I've always rode a bike. I love my bike, and it's fun, and I

03:04:54.880 --> 03:05:01.680
enjoy it, and I know it's kind of... I don't know, not nerdy, but, like, I know everyone kind of drives.

03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:09.200
Okay, we're gonna take the devil's deal, and then we're gonna reset the question mark. Maybe,

03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:14.960
I don't know. Or maybe do the fight that's below. There is a fight that's below.

03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:26.480
Taking 15 spawns a permanent demon after 30... what? Caps up four familiars total. Should

03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:30.080
grab it, and then, sure, just grab that. While we're at it, might as well just take everything.

03:05:30.640 --> 03:05:41.840
All right, we do have 45 coins. Can I... please? Thank you. Thank you! Money, money, money.

03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:48.560
I never drive. I'm too fear of it, honestly. I know, like, it's kind of one of those things where

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:52.560
it's like, you know what your limits are? It means, like, yeah, I do not have the perception to be able

03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:57.440
to drive. I wonder if self-driving cars would change anything. I think you still need to be

03:05:57.440 --> 03:06:02.240
able to actually drive, but, like, the license... go license for that. Also, thank you, Anonymous,

03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:08.880
for asking to be my bike seat, if I didn't say thank you. In case I was too distracted.

03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:20.480
Okay. We might be able to just straight up... oh. Okay. Thank goodness we didn't do that. We almost

03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:27.680
skipped steam sail. All right, come on. Come on, flames, you can do it. I wish I didn't have to

03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:37.280
drive. Cycling's so fun, because you get to appreciate the nature and so... reset now or do the fight.

03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:44.720
Because I can always reset after the fight. Right, if I'm getting hammered in the fight,

03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:53.840
I'll just reset if I'm getting hammered. I'll reset. I definitely could have more damage.

03:06:57.360 --> 03:06:58.640
About 10% of the way.

03:07:05.040 --> 03:07:07.120
I mean, because the C-section is locking.

03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:19.440
Okay. Okay. Oh, there's a penny. You ain't mine now. I mean, 60% maybe?

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:31.360
Okay. What are we doing? Health? Right. I'm not giving too much health back.

03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:41.360
All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, 50%. We will reset. There is another round after this.

03:07:43.920 --> 03:07:47.280
All right. I think we can get... Come on, haunt. You're doing it all, buddy.

03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:54.480
We didn't get BFF, but we might be able to roll for it. I don't know why the flames are going in

03:07:54.480 --> 03:08:06.320
such random direction. Gento. Okay, we did it. I'm feeling confident now. I think we did it.

03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:12.400
I was worried we didn't actually roll. We've got it. We got it.

03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:19.120
It's okay to be nervous and sometimes self-doubt is natural, but we got it. Oh,

03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:25.040
God, please just perish him before all these guys come out. Okay, thank you. Okay, no flame.

03:08:26.880 --> 03:08:29.280
No, I'm keeping my money because we're going again.

03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:34.240
If you guys have rule plays, let me make sure to send them in Marshmallow. Yeah, yeah,

03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:36.960
don't... Yeah, you can do it for free. Stop giving me money. What the heck?

03:08:38.720 --> 03:08:42.320
Do it for free in Marshmallow and you can rewrite what you've already submitted. Please don't

03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:50.000
think you're ever bothering me by like... All right, reset. Ta-da! We're all the way back here.

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:53.760
Yeah, please don't think you're ever annoying me in Marshmallow or anything. Don't be silly, Billy.

03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:59.760
I'm just glad that we can talk on Marshmallow again. Nun's Habit.

03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:08.640
Behind the key is the key and a coin. Sure, I'll take it. All right, we're gonna...

03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:16.160
Well, there's a meme audio idea test, a self-car. Oh, right, okay.

03:09:19.120 --> 03:09:25.440
Right. Oh, we stalk up on Hells. I think that's... We'll stalk up on Hells.

03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:31.680
And then we'll... Oh, wait, we'll take Nun's Habit in case of something good.

03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:40.400
Fire rate, I'll take it. Shot speed, I'll take it. Range, I'll take it.

03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:46.880
Tears and shot speed, I'll take it. Speed? I'm actually a bit of a speedy Gonzalez.

03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:50.000
I'll take the Trinket because we actually don't have one.

03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:54.080
You're done. Okay.

03:09:56.880 --> 03:09:57.840
We'll reroll.

03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:11.280
We have two, two diamonds.

03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:20.480
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I understand what needs to be done.

03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:24.880
I understand what needs to be done. You need not give me... It's not that, but...

03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:32.480
Okay, I'm pretty sure I heard him or I heard a bird on the roof. It's one of the others.

03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:37.120
Okay, I understand what I need to do and I do have the strength to do it. Thank goodness.

03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:46.960
Or just you spin me right round, baby, right round. When you go down, when you go down.

03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:58.720
Where's the enemy? No idea. This floor, you cook. Yes.

03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:06.560
So we can pop one of the cards and then take the one to the next floor and...

03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:16.960
Okay, one more.

03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:24.720
Now we're going to avoid the El Diablo. I'm no interested. You cannot tempt me this time around.

03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:30.960
I was desperate because... Right, so we do have to pop one card on this floor because we don't have

03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:36.000
room for a second card, which is understandable, haven't I say? We are going to... Oh, I should have

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:41.760
done it on the other side, but you know what? You live in your life. So we do have to pop one,

03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:47.360
but we can pick up the other one and then use it on the next floor. No, please don't touch that.

03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:54.560
Thank you. Okay, and just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, doubles Isaac's number of coins.

03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:57.680
Right, once and then we pick this up, we take it to the next floor and then we'll

03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:01.840
double what we have on the next floor. Okay, and then we jump down.

03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:12.960
Karaoke stream when? After three weeks, if you want karaoke, I can do a karaoke.

03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:24.240
Okay, five bombs, sure, and I don't actually want any red health. Goodbye. Oh wait, have immaculate

03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:33.600
conception. Oh my god, these are good. Right, don't get distracted. Let's maximise our monies

03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:41.120
by getting these guys, sorry, my stomach just made a noise. Karaoke club. I don't think my

03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:53.520
ping is good enough for the, right, and then fire. Come on. Fire.

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:03.680
Come on. Karaoke would be fun. Yes, we can definitely do karaoke. I have no problems with that.

03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:11.120
Oh, why bombs?

03:13:16.800 --> 03:13:22.000
This game's so, oh, I lost my holy mantle. How? I haven't even saw the dying thing.

03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:24.800
Right, we're going to back out and go in again.

03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:32.080
Even though I should actually try and take damage because we have immaculate conception, but

03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:37.680
at the end of the day, at the end of the day.

03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:48.240
Okay, okay, sorry, I'm trying not to lose anything right now. Karaoke, you have to stream, my beloved.

03:13:52.560 --> 03:14:00.160
Okay, sure. So if I bomb him, do I get anything? I don't think so.

03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:12.160
Hold on, I'm so sorry. My dad's literally right outside the door. Even when it's like...

03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:38.480
I had to tell myself, fuck off. He's on the phone with my mom and I'm like, stop saying names.

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:45.760
Stop saying names. Pleading with him. Right, okay, what was I doing?

03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:52.000
Ah, okay. Sorry, I couldn't hear my ingame audio there.

03:14:52.960 --> 03:15:02.400
What have I done? What? What did I do to the game?

03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:12.480
Why aren't bombs popping?

03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:24.720
Oh, I was like, did I break the game? Sorry about that. I was so confused.

03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:28.000
Okay, yeah, so if I destroy an angel now, nothing happens.

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:32.800
I thought I broke the game. I was like, excuse me. Now, I know there is a heart in there, but I'm not

03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:41.760
really... I was kind of hoping for a... Oh, I can take pills. I can see forever. I'm

03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:45.440
drowning. Is it in here? No, it's not. It's actually down below.

03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:56.320
A womb room. If I had a donation machine, a blood donation, that probably...

03:15:56.560 --> 03:16:04.160
Oh, I'm just going to pop it now. All right, two diamonds pop.

03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:10.480
Yeah, something tells me we're not going to struggle in the...

03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:14.800
Sorry, I keep forgetting. That's a delay. I'll just take it.

03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:24.240
Right, fully recharges activated. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.

03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:28.320
Give me. What's my birth rate? Familiar is that normally,

03:16:28.320 --> 03:16:33.920
fallotain to the lilas, follow her jello instead. The melee attack gains three damage.

03:16:33.920 --> 03:16:37.120
I'll take it. I'll take it. Don't mind if I do.

03:16:40.640 --> 03:16:45.360
Okay, we can always see the secret room. Sure. Mother transformation.

03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:52.000
It's not really going to do much for me, but it's only seven. BFF!

03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:57.680
BFF! My beloved. Okay, I'm going to restock like this.

03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:02.720
Oh wait, let's see what trinket we get. 100% wider tears and restock back. Why not?

03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:13.520
Right, trap door can give us a new item potentially. Whipping me. Range, heart, no.

03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:24.560
I'm going to take this. Oh, there's chaos. Do we rip on chaos? Take the range.

03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:32.080
Wow. Do we rip on chaos? Well, we can't grab that almond milk.

03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:38.720
It's damage with C-section, is it? Oh, because of the whipping.

03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:44.560
Oh, we got a paternal heart for it. I'll stop at you.

03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:51.600
I'm starting to think you guys are in a fendom at this rate.

03:17:53.360 --> 03:18:01.760
Thank you. I can't believe I have to say this. Thank you. Viewbot number 5109172 for the donation.

03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:11.440
You're ridiculous. Thank you. Okay, wow. Jello's so big. Oh my god, look how wide they look like.

03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:20.800
Right, well, we do chaos. As if yes or she wasn't any indication. Right, we've done chaos.

03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:23.360
Number of bombs, sure.

03:18:23.680 --> 03:18:30.960
Two of clubs. The two of clubs. Shot speed, no. Let's refresh.

03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:39.280
Bouncy tears, absolutely. Where are you? Cage leaps on an enemy that deals the first

03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:45.440
damage to Isaac, deals 90 damage and releases four rock, chases enemies for 13 contact damage, sure.

03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:50.720
Spider baby, sure. I'll take it.

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:58.240
Flight, sure. I'll take it. I'm spending all that money. Petrifying tears, sure. I'll take it.

03:18:58.240 --> 03:18:59.520
You don't have to tell me twice.

03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:05.040
Angry fly for Beelzebub, sure. I'll take it.

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.400
A shield, sure. I'll take it.

03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:11.920
Bloody guts, sure. I'll take it.

03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:17.360
Gumpers, my beloved. I know I don't need it, but I'll take it.

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:27.200
Okay, sure. We'll take it. Oh no, we can't afford jiddy. My shadow, not jiddy.

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.360
Wait a minute, Jello can move this out the way. Come on, Jello.

03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:44.480
Move out of the way for me. Yeah, I'm so smart. Oh my gosh.

03:19:45.920 --> 03:19:53.200
I'm so smart. Why am I so smart? Oh my, whoa. Oh, I thought that was an enemy coming at me.

03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:56.720
It's my own thing. Okay, let's do this.

03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:06.240
Take almond milk. Can I reach it? I don't think I can take the thing.

03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:17.120
Yeah, you need that thing, that puppet thing to get access to this one. It's a troll. We are being

03:20:17.120 --> 03:20:21.920
filled. We are being made of full of ourselves. You need the jump book. You're flying. Wait,

03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:27.040
what do you mean I'm flying? Yeah, I can't get in.

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:36.480
That's what Reefling said, I can't get in. Just use the back door. Right, if we do this,

03:20:36.480 --> 03:20:43.840
it turns everything in here into a bomb. Something exploded over there.

03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:51.200
Uh, don't need that. Don't need the bomb. So we'll just nuke this.

03:20:52.640 --> 03:21:00.080
Get some pennies back, and then dead eye. Why not? Why not? I will take dead eye.

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:05.120
Okay, let's go. I'll just make sure I picked up everything.

03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:11.440
Well, Maze will take that now. It doesn't really make much of a difference. Let's go.

03:21:14.720 --> 03:21:17.520
No, you can only get it with the jump book pretty funny.

03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:21.760
No, you can get it with that Muppet thingy, you know. I'm going crazy. Can't get in,

03:21:21.760 --> 03:21:25.680
because I'm too big. Real entrance.

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:40.960
Hello? Are we about to go crazy? Right, I'm going to purposely get

03:21:41.680 --> 03:21:49.120
energy on my dick, so I can dig your hole. All right, money for money. Oh wait, I have flight,

03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:54.560
idiot. I'm going to pick up that box, because that's like the most OP thing I could possibly do at

03:21:54.560 --> 03:22:04.720
this. Look at all the babies. I can't see anything. Uh, right, we're going to purposefully get...

03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:12.480
Ah, sure, I'll take that. You're already crazy. This is overkill. I'm going to imagine if my game

03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:19.920
got corrupted, because, uh, not corrupted. Bruh! Bruh, it's so bright in here. Hold on,

03:22:19.920 --> 03:22:26.640
let me put reactive mode on, just so you know how is it going to go on. Is that reactive mode?

03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:31.040
Yeah, that's how red is.

03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:46.480
I have no idea what that did. Well, I'm going to do my wee staircase, and then I'm going to go down here.

03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:50.560
Did I really help them with the visuals? Pretty, like, oh, we've got black mark!

03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:55.040
Oh, I don't know if it's the one that doesn't let you progress. Like, some of them don't let

03:22:55.040 --> 03:23:01.360
you go backwards, so hold on. Hold on, I am going to take this. I don't want to miss it.

03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:10.000
Wouldn't miss it for the world, wefin. And then, we're just doing this. Oh, we've got perfection

03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:15.040
unlocked! Oh, we can pick it up, actually, because we've got, um, I can't see shit.

03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:21.840
Stop giving me devil deals, or you will pay for your crimes.

03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:31.200
Roon shard! Oh, I've opened up a wimmy. Okay, we can't do anything, but we are going to go down

03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:40.320
to the secret lair. Hopefully, we do get a Yara. No, not, oh wait, no, there is something here.

03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:50.080
I hate the game going up where OP is. Um, it's going real good.

03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:53.760
We're actually going to take this to add to our damage.

03:23:54.720 --> 03:24:01.600
The black rune will consume it, so boom. And we got nothing we wanted. That's okay!

03:24:02.640 --> 03:24:11.120
Right, I'm not health, fiery, range. There's no downside to you, I will take you.

03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:19.360
Okay, let's go. What runes do you have unlocked? Not many. Yara was actually, oh, it's an error

03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:28.400
room. Well, thank goodness I didn't go ahead. It's in here. Oh, there's a chest on him. Okay,

03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:38.000
I'll blow him up. Picking up a coin has 21st chance to spawn a red heart. Well, I don't need

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:41.680
it, sweetie. And here you thought you weren't going to finish the run. Literally, I thought I

03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:51.600
wasn't going to win, but we winning. We win, aim. Is she becoming on in 30 minutes? Or did I make?

03:24:59.920 --> 03:25:11.120
Are you serious? I love chaos. I love chaos. I love chaos. 40 minutes until the collab. Okay,

03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:14.880
I will redirect into sheepsters because I always seem to miss her, so I

03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:26.000
I literally chaos deniers and shambles. And I get the Seraphim unlock. I know I already have

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:35.280
flight at the moment, but you know, Seraphim is nice. 23 damage. Oh, and a boss room little

03:25:35.280 --> 03:25:43.360
cheeky man. Oh, look how big the babies are. They're humongous. They're a baby. Oh, wait,

03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:54.000
I'm dumb dumb. Here. No, no, no, no. I don't want to skip. Okay, let's go. Whoa. What are you?

03:25:54.560 --> 03:26:05.440
No, not Levitical. Levitical sucks. Okay, I see sack. Guppy's head. Wait,

03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:11.920
I already have guppy? Oh yeah, I do because look how much buzzing around. Right, spawns a sack.

03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:17.840
Every six rooms. That sounds good to me. Beelzebub transformation.

03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:27.840
Not bad. Okay, let's blame him. I missed those things. Okay, hold on to her money.

03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:34.480
We might get Yiera, which is in the room. Wait, if I pop my ult, I've popped it twice.

03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:37.600
Oh my god, this is insane.

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:42.720
Bro, they can't even spawn in.

03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:51.760
I can't even see. I don't. I don't want to pick up the coins in case I've got a Yiera.

03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:55.760
I don't seem to have a Yiera. I don't seem to have half rooms at the moment.

03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:06.400
Bro, I love this game. See, this is when the game's satisfying and you don't want to like

03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:10.080
nuke it into the stratosphere is when you're like winning really easily. I said what I said.

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:17.920
Empty vessel. When Isaac has no red hearts, you get flight and you actually get a proc.

03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:24.480
Aw, that's a shame that I've got so much. So, does you drop a pedestal item now because I have

03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:27.520
chaos? No, you don't. Curious.

03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:32.720
How did that black room get taken out of my hand?

03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:37.440
Look how fast I have to charge it again. Barely took two seconds, honestly.

03:27:37.440 --> 03:27:41.120
Right. No, I didn't drop a Yiera, but I'll do this one off.

03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:48.000
I don't know what it does. Sometimes it doesn't even say out loud what it's doing and I'm like,

03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:53.600
um, okay, that didn't help me at all. I am so small I can hardly pick up the coins properly.

03:27:54.560 --> 03:28:00.640
Right. Uh, because nothing in here. Was there anything worth?

03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:10.880
Every time we purchase something, we might get 0.5 damage.

03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:18.400
Chaos deniers in shambles. Shambles.

03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:23.600
Oh, and we've got money back, bro. Money back guarantee.

03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:30.720
Oh, we can actually get rid of Levitical. We've got range for that, I'll take it.

03:28:31.600 --> 03:28:36.560
Cause it's a chance to shoot. Yeah, we're gonna grab it and we're gonna be even more OP.

03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:43.760
This is getting, this is getting a bit silly in that. Oh my god, hungry soul. I'll take Bob. No.

03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:46.880
Well, we can actually get Bob Transformation if we want to.

03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:53.680
Blood Poppy chases enemies. No, he's cute, but he's dangerous. He'll attack you if you're not careful.

03:28:54.560 --> 03:29:00.800
It doesn't mean it. He just gets a little excited. Taking damage shoots, uh, sure.

03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:06.480
So if we do end up taking damage, they're getting annihilated on site. They don't even have a choice

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:11.520
in the matter. Uh, Papa Fly. Chance Lock, yeah.

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:19.600
For, for $7 we can get 25 coins, sorry, 7 cent we can get. What's this?

03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:24.000
I agreed. Every 20 seconds, Isaac shoots a coin tier that deals...

03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:27.920
Oh no, I cost a coin to shoot. No, thank you.

03:29:30.160 --> 03:29:34.720
What a deal. Literally, what a nice shop. I like the economy in Isaac's world.

03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:41.920
You can break it so easily. A Rift? I actually think Rifts will be more dangerous because of our C-section.

03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:52.000
Uh, we've got Book of Sin. Spawn's Barriers, no. We might try and go for Bookworm just because we can.

03:29:53.520 --> 03:29:59.920
We don't need bombs. We don't need lunch. We can do it again. Maybe we'll bomb it just to re-roll it for free.

03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:10.560
Polyphemus? Oh, I'm gonna cream. Oh, and we've got that as well. I'm creaming.

03:30:10.560 --> 03:30:18.720
That's a shame we couldn't get that, but I'd rather take the thingy. Polyphemus. You just need Keeper's

03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:28.960
head. 76 damage. Look at them all coming out. Brav. This is getting outrageous. This run. This is

03:30:28.960 --> 03:30:38.080
outrageous. Oh no, the cloud. It said AFU to us. What, stinky cloud? 76 damage. Feels good, man.

03:30:38.160 --> 03:30:50.160
That's a wee rune. I need to find out. Okay, I didn't do anything. Sure, let's bomb this.

03:30:52.480 --> 03:30:59.440
What did you drop? More bombs. Okay. Sorry for the brightness. I'm trying to burn the Keeper's over

03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:05.840
here. Man, I can't see. I need to leave. Sorry. I literally cannot see. What's going on? Right.

03:31:05.840 --> 03:31:14.560
You. I've been needing you because... Oh no, I need... Oh, well, sure.

03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:27.440
It's fine. You're allowed to do that. I can't see a thing, honestly. The flashbang in.

03:31:27.440 --> 03:31:31.520
It's pretty severe after I've met, even by my standards. I'm like, sirion.

03:31:32.320 --> 03:31:40.640
We got baby spin for all our familiars. They're actually gonna have accuracy, you know?

03:31:42.960 --> 03:31:44.400
Oh, what are you giving us? Pills?

03:31:47.200 --> 03:31:50.560
Wheel of Fortune? Yeah.

03:31:50.720 --> 03:31:56.640
Is that what I just did? Is that a passive?

03:31:57.920 --> 03:32:02.000
Luck up, sure. Hyrofan, sure.

03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:14.000
Pretty fly. High Priestess. Okay, that was a lot. We're not doing that one. That one's rubbish.

03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:22.960
Hopefully we'll get a Yara. What now, though? Bingeater. Oh, I like poison tears. I think poison

03:32:22.960 --> 03:32:34.560
tears is the way to do it. Oh my god. I know I'm full, but... No, we don't actually need that.

03:32:35.520 --> 03:32:40.000
I don't even know why I'm, like, trying to stretch your size with game. I mean, look,

03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:42.800
we're not even a cheat. Like, this game's gonna break.

03:32:47.120 --> 03:32:52.960
I can't even see. Oh, there's a Yara. I repeat, there is a Yara.

03:32:54.480 --> 03:32:59.200
Is there another Yara? Imagine if we drop two Yaras. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want the coins

03:32:59.280 --> 03:33:10.960
coming over to me. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope. Okay, we've got Yara. Let's pop it.

03:33:14.960 --> 03:33:23.040
Was there a second Yara? Nah. Draft. Okay, but we got the coins. That's the main thing.

03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:25.200
We got our second Yara.

03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:33.200
Okay, you know what? We'll just go for the devil. There's so much health in this.

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:35.840
Oh, I forgot we were not doing...

03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:41.520
I'll take it for the bookworm transformation, but I'm not gonna leave with it.

03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:46.960
What does it do? It gives a soul heart. Not sure. Give me up then. Pop it.

03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:50.160
Oh, thank you.

03:33:52.480 --> 03:33:54.240
I could have saved it for the next floor.

03:33:57.120 --> 03:33:58.160
What'd you mean, the night?

03:34:00.400 --> 03:34:01.520
Saved what, Monkos?

03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:07.520
What did I misunderstand? I misunderstood. It does not compute. I suck.

03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:10.960
Right, we'll do poison tier. I'm actually not that fussed for...

03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:16.320
What's it called?

03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:20.960
Benjyter, just because it cycles through everything and I'm really dumb.

03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:28.320
Using a rune has a tip to spawn a copy. Oh, that's worth it. That's so worth it.

03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:36.480
Okay, the 50% wider is worth it as well. I know I'm down to three luck, but we're doing so much

03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:42.000
damage. I'm not fussed for Benjyter. I know it's good, but...

03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:47.440
Do you need to save at this point? Probably not.

03:34:47.440 --> 03:34:49.760
Tears up. Oh no, tears are capped, aren't they?

03:34:50.960 --> 03:34:59.040
Thothic! Thothic. I got Thothic about damage and health. Conjoined, why not?

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:04.400
Enemies explode into tears. Isaac's tears are connected with a beam of electricity.

03:35:07.600 --> 03:35:12.400
It's a good day to be an Isaac player. It's a fantastic day to be an Isaac player.

03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:14.480
Damage, just whole straight up damage.

03:35:16.720 --> 03:35:19.520
Oh, it's a good day. Right, we're gonna bomb you too.

03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:26.240
Thank you. What does the cookie do again?

03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:28.480
Each of Isaac's tears have a different stars effect.

03:35:30.160 --> 03:35:33.440
We're gonna get the Christmas box in here. Oh, wait.

03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:38.960
I've got lump of coal, I'm guessing. It doesn't work.

03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:43.600
We'll grab it, honestly. We'll just spend everything. Spend them all.

03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:49.840
We're melting the PC today. If us, where if this game breaks right at the end?

03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:53.520
I'll be region. We're literally one away from the boss fight.

03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:59.680
Play the cookie, it's fun. Yes. One here.

03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:07.520
Sure, give me an internal heart. Okay, bomb, so it's fine.

03:36:09.680 --> 03:36:13.760
What are we looking at? Oh, well, we can actually get a devil horseman.

03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:17.440
Oh, no, the fire thing isn't broken. Hold on.

03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:23.120
Okay, I think it's propped. Is there one over here? I have no idea. Hold on.

03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:27.840
Oh, that's a... We'll grab the seven seals, why not?

03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:32.640
I don't think we actually have to play anymore, if I'm being honest.

03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:35.680
I think we got Yara instantly.

03:36:41.840 --> 03:36:42.880
I got a green shark.

03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:50.800
I can't see. There is a Yara. I'm gonna pick it up.

03:36:51.760 --> 03:36:53.440
So it's already in my persons.

03:36:59.680 --> 03:37:02.320
Okay, okay. One more time.

03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:07.840
I didn't even... I didn't even need to do a new shoot.

03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:11.280
Yeah, I'm gonna pop the Yara, so it'll be a surprise if there's a Yara up there or not.

03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:15.360
Well, that's so good. Thank you for that. Please don't waste my time ever again.

03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:19.520
What enemies literally cannot see them?

03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:22.480
Okay, we got him.

03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:25.680
Good thing. Maybe.

03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:28.400
What did that do?

03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:33.280
Yeah, it does not do anything. Rune shard.

03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:37.600
Okay, let's just grab all this money, spend it, and you.

03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:42.000
Because this was like the best run I could have ever asked for.

03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:46.800
Literally a reset key. Special shout out to reset key. You did it.

03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:52.240
I'm gonna try and... actually, you know what? I have 30 bombs. I think I'll be okay.

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:56.880
I'll just spawn them. Spawns a random coin.

03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:01.680
Imagine if we got Lilith giving birth to babies, literally.

03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:04.640
She's raising the population by herself.

03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:13.200
A whip. No, I want this one.

03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:17.040
Could you imagine if that Yara duplicated though?

03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:19.920
Could you imagine if it did though?

03:38:22.240 --> 03:38:26.560
The high priestess. I got a drowsy repeatedly. Oh, thanks, I guess. Drowsy.

03:38:28.160 --> 03:38:32.640
Okay, let's see what we can buy. Oh, no point in the coin thing.

03:38:32.880 --> 03:38:42.080
We've got a quick worm. Not bad.

03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:47.280
Could just go with familiars, to be honest, because we're about to double the familiars.

03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:53.360
Levity in front of Isaac deals... what, ill damage?

03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:56.240
Jeez, sure. Give me that. I don't recognize it.

03:38:56.880 --> 03:38:59.760
Spectral tears. I think my tears already capped long ago.

03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:02.880
Picking up 15 hearts, yeah. Go for it.

03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:07.760
We'll reroll a little cheeky reroll. Actually, we're just gonna bomb for it,

03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:10.800
because we've not got that much money. Three hell.

03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:15.920
Sure, why not? Just give us everything, okay?

03:39:15.920 --> 03:39:18.400
Whoa, what do you get? A chest gives you one coin.

03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:22.880
It's a bit late for that, I think. We could maybe bomb these.

03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:28.000
Okay, uh, I'm gonna bomb too.

03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:34.320
Okay. Well, something tells me we're ready for this greed fight.

03:39:34.320 --> 03:39:38.720
You know, I'm not too sure we've got it in the bag, but why not? Let's see, one coin.

03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:43.600
Okay.

03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:50.800
Oh, that was a tough one. That was scary. Not gonna lie, I was on the edge of my seat.

03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:58.560
Okay, let's at least get some money to donate to them. Okay, here it goes.

03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:03.680
Oh, for goodness sake.

03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:08.080
Could you imagine this is greedier of always?

03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:13.200
Sure, I will put money in the greed mission.

03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:24.160
I'm ridiculous. Let's pop these. Maybe we can get a few coins to put in the machine.

03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:27.440
That was crazy.

03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:32.720
Oh, we got a few more coins to put in. That wasn't bad.

03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:40.800
That was so close. I know we almost didn't make it.

03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:47.920
But yeah, that's Lilith on greed mode. As you can see, she's OPE, the Binding of Bosses easy game.

03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:52.640
It just depends. Sometimes you can get the best run and it makes you addicted to the game,

03:40:52.640 --> 03:40:56.400
and sometimes you can get work, but like terrible run after terrible run,

03:40:56.400 --> 03:41:00.480
and it makes you so upset you literally are like, had enough.

03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:07.600
So if I minutes until the collab. Okay, I will do marshmallows,

03:41:08.560 --> 03:41:12.720
and I will make sure I'm redirecting into Sheepster's. She is broken in general.

03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:18.000
Try her if you want an easy run. Does donate and even do anything after the first time?

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:21.440
No, it doesn't, but I just do it because, because why not?

03:41:21.440 --> 03:41:26.480
But yeah, that's my save file on Isaac. So this game becomes multiplayer in November,

03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:34.000
which is when you guys are going to come in, because yeah, I haven't gotten all the unlocks.

03:41:34.960 --> 03:41:41.360
Um, I still don't even comprehend how some of the characters work, like, um.

03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:49.280
Who's that? Bethany? I always struggle to understand what she's doing.

03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:54.080
Shawnee's going to carry us in this game. I know for once I get to carry you, maybe, I'm not sure.

03:41:55.200 --> 03:41:59.200
I'm not, I guess I could start playing. No, it's very, if it's not the game for you,

03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:04.640
do not force it. I am so serious when I say that. Bethany is really strong in the city.

03:42:04.640 --> 03:42:09.360
I just want the game to play with you. Oh no! You need to make sure you actually like the game.

03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:16.480
It's not an easy game. So that, those symbols on the left side are like the unlocks of certain bosses

03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:22.880
that have killed, and like, I'm missing a lot. Like, the tattered page means I've done delirium

03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:27.600
and all of that, and most of these are like super lucky runs. I don't really get good.

03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:32.800
There needs to be a mod where the familiars are replaced by rooflings. I would be so down.

03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:38.880
I finished Tainted Lost, then we've go, brev, brev. I've not even started on Tainted Lost.

03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:45.520
I'm too, like, this is how the average Tainted Lost run goes. Are you ready?

03:42:46.960 --> 03:42:51.120
So we, we have a holy card. We can pop it, so we're now one shot death.

03:42:52.080 --> 03:42:59.840
Like, this is, we're not going to make it. Yeah, we've got a sacrifice room that we can't

03:42:59.840 --> 03:43:05.600
do anything, and before it finishes the run, no chance. I have attempted so many times and I just get,

03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:10.480
like, literally we're down, we don't have another holy mantle.

03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:20.080
Or, I've already messed up. Okay, we're not fighting those spiders. Like, this is how bad it is.

03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:26.160
Tainted, Tainted is just, like, such a un,

03:43:28.080 --> 03:43:32.720
unfun experience. Now, I'm sure it's fun when you actually, oh,

03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:41.680
okay, well, right, let's try again. Let me just try and explain again how bad this is.

03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:46.080
Okay, we're going to pop the holy card, and then we're going to, you know, just flutter about,

03:43:46.080 --> 03:43:52.320
get a few things going on. And we're just going to check out the shop, okay. Mm-hmm, close enough.

03:43:54.640 --> 03:44:00.880
Yeah, like, eternal hearts mean nothing, so, yeah. Strony is locking it. No, it's not happening.

03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:05.600
I basically, in order to even get anywhere, I would need to roll,

03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:12.800
maybe a spoon bender. I'd need to roll that first.

03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:19.680
Now, the only thing is, we do have spectral tears, which means we can shoot through rocks,

03:44:19.680 --> 03:44:23.200
like that, which is obviously a bit much, much, mutual helpful.

03:44:25.360 --> 03:44:32.560
But no, I have never successfully done this. I remember when we both came out and people had

03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:39.840
to date, I mean, how to get the lost, honestly. Some of the requirements in this game are like,

03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:49.120
right there. But yeah, I basically would need, like, the most OP items ever. Now,

03:44:49.120 --> 03:44:55.760
the tainted lost apparently comes with better items. Do we believe that? Let's find out what this

03:44:55.760 --> 03:45:10.480
better item is, hmm? Oh, what? Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need. The one item I need. Hold

03:45:10.480 --> 03:45:18.240
on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The one item I need in order to do this

03:45:18.240 --> 03:45:28.960
game mode. The one item I need in order to do this game mode is the sign. It's the sign. It's

03:45:28.960 --> 03:45:32.960
the sign. It's the sign. It's the sign. Right, don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess up. Don't mess

03:45:32.960 --> 03:45:42.800
up. I don't want to mess up, but those strays from the flies are very dangerous, as well as his

03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:51.040
triple shot. Hmm, not a fan. Oh my god, we have an orbital. We're so safe. Let's go.

03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:59.520
Focus. This run is real. Better items means you can't find useless items and gives health and

03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:08.480
weight. Okay, now I can take a devil deal. That's not a problem. So I actually misplayed there. I

03:46:08.480 --> 03:46:14.240
could have killed all these guys without them getting close to me like this. But we can hover on

03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:19.920
the rocks safely and I'm taking it. I don't care. You should boost the fight, strongy. No, I don't

03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:25.680
care. I'm literally tainted gloss. Leave me alone. I'm just going to blow it up because it's a health

03:46:25.680 --> 03:46:30.080
hazard, okay? Okay, this room's a bit of a hazard. I'm pretty sure they have spectral shots. Do they

03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:38.560
not? Well, they can come on the rocks. So, not the best room, but we're alive. Oh, we need a key.

03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:51.120
Okay, a key. Our coins. Coins are a key. No one destroyed, strongy. I also can't find defense,

03:46:51.120 --> 03:46:57.520
like most orbitals, cuba, meat, bandage, or exception. Yeah, nod leaf is taken out of the item

03:46:57.520 --> 03:47:04.320
pool. If I had nod leaf, the only reason I've done stuff on the other tainted, the lost in general,

03:47:05.200 --> 03:47:09.600
but nod leaf is taken out of the item pool for tainted. And I'm like, ah, great. The only thing

03:47:09.600 --> 03:47:17.120
that is keeping me alive during all my runs. Nod leaf is the MVP for me personally. Okay, I have a

03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:28.960
key. I'm actually going to regret this if it's not got a key and it doesn't have a key. Key!

03:47:32.720 --> 03:47:33.840
That might have been wiser.

03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:44.000
We're going to have to sadly skip our item room, it appears, but we got a second

03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:51.920
lifeline with holy mantle. That is an unfortunate pill to swallow. Maybe I can get a key out of

03:47:51.920 --> 03:48:03.040
any, a key, a coin out, oh, there we go. We are going to pick up phd, so it means we can swallow pills.

03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:13.440
Something's wrong. Okay, now you have to play it. I'm not, I don't know. Okay, okay, okay.

03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:27.600
Hopefully this is, this. Okay, it looked like a secret. Oh, what? What? Right.

03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:35.440
That's why I didn't want to happen. And there's a secret room!

03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:48.320
Oh, I'm so scared. Oh my god. Oh my god, is this the run?

03:48:52.160 --> 03:48:53.200
Is this the run?

03:48:53.920 --> 03:49:08.000
Is this the run? We got blank card on tainted lost with holy card in our freaking holster.

03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:14.560
Oh, please don't fuck it up. I'm going to be so sad. I'm going to be so sad if I fuck this up.

03:49:14.560 --> 03:49:26.560
I'm going to camp on the rock. I know. Okay, we can, we can take a devil deal. It's fine.

03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:37.440
Curious. Oh no, it's goat head. My apologies, it's goat head. Absolutely, absolutely on goat

03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:39.600
head. Okay, so we can choose now.

03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:52.960
Okay, I am so scared. The code, papa, vector, hotel, foxtrot,

03:49:53.520 --> 03:50:05.760
New Guinea. What's it? November, echo, wanker, November. I hardly even know.

03:50:07.680 --> 03:50:13.920
I am so scared to progress. I don't not want to lose this run. I feel like I'm going to be dumb

03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:21.360
and use the card or something. Can, holy mantles can't stack, can they? I can't stack this holy

03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:30.400
mantle card. I've never had the combo before. Okay, sorry. They can't stack. Okay.

03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:37.360
Sorry, I just got a little nervous. Sorry. I lost my cool a little bit.

03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:48.720
Okay. Okay, now I just need some good combos to put my damage up so I can one shot stuff as soon

03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:53.680
as I enter the room. Is that too much to ask for? To one shot stuff, huh?

03:50:55.280 --> 03:51:02.000
Not this room, not this room. It's so small. Okay. Okay, hold it. Cards can't stack, but

03:51:03.520 --> 03:51:16.320
consider this. I am MLG pro. Shot speed up. Okay. Okay. I'm analising the contents, not really

03:51:16.320 --> 03:51:24.320
speaking to me. I don't know where to go. I feel it. Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like this is

03:51:24.320 --> 03:51:34.400
the way to the boss. Okay, easy, easy. Take out any. It's not small. It's just cool. You lost your

03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:42.960
cool. I lost my cool. Oh, wait, shit. Oh, my soundboard isn't up. Right. Sorry. I need to try

03:51:42.960 --> 03:51:51.280
hard. Forget the soundboard. This might actually be the run. This might actually be the run. I'm just

03:51:51.280 --> 03:51:56.960
from afar, nice and safe. If I could get contact to protect me.

03:51:56.960 --> 03:52:07.440
Ah, right, okay. Okay, okay. What's in here?

03:52:09.280 --> 03:52:17.280
Moves along. Enemies are attracted to the fly. Okay, this is good. Oh, that's why it's called

03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:21.520
lost fly because it takes away the attention from lost. I know there's a tinted rock here,

03:52:22.240 --> 03:52:29.040
but we don't take any so hard. I don't think we're going to raid Toshiba on time. Oh, no.

03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:36.400
Don't the whole point. Oh, don't thank you. Right, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.

03:52:36.400 --> 03:52:39.440
Nice and steady. Use her.

03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:51.120
Well, we just turned back into the boss. I don't know. These spectral tears are so good early on.

03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:04.240
Okay, he's attacking him, so I'll do that. No, no.

03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:10.160
We're not. Key. I was too late for that on the other side of the map now.

03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:16.960
Right, holy car, do not dare use right bumper or I will eat your face.

03:53:18.800 --> 03:53:23.280
Okay, well, I was a waste. Don't do that again. I believe Mercy is going to be the one responsible

03:53:23.280 --> 03:53:27.360
for the POV. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay.

03:53:27.360 --> 03:53:36.240
Okay, I can do this. Well, the odds of the secret room being right here are pretty high.

03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:41.680
Yeah, what we got? Rubbage, right.

03:53:45.600 --> 03:53:47.920
Oh, no, I'm not getting an item.

03:53:50.560 --> 03:53:54.960
Unless it, well, if it's another, oh, he's attacking the fly. Thank goodness.

03:53:55.360 --> 03:54:01.440
Okay, 50%. He might, yeah, I was going to say he might swap the flies out of range now.

03:54:04.960 --> 03:54:08.720
Yep, that's okay. Perfect will.

03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:18.480
Cube and meat. Lamal. Cube and meat. We take perfection. I mean, we can fly over to items.

03:54:25.600 --> 03:54:32.720
Well, sure. And pop it. Well, there's no point in popping it, but we could maybe get

03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:40.400
bookworm or whatever it's called. Oh, stress, stress, stress, stress.

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:48.880
They are making Shrek 5. Better not. Thank you, but meat. Well, if it turned into meat boy,

03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:53.840
meat boy goes away and attacks, which wouldn't go amiss.

03:54:58.640 --> 03:54:59.440
Why are you a patch?

03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:09.360
Okay, these are the diagonal guys, so we're just going to stay nice and steady.

03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:19.920
Breathe and hydrate, bro, honestly. I'm so stressed right now. My blood pressures through

03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:25.760
the roof. My ears must be red from how stressed I am right now. Okay, we've got lucky penny,

03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:31.040
so if we pick up any kind of staticy effect, as long as we don't get walloped,

03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:34.880
I couldn't have made that closer if I desired.

03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:42.240
I couldn't have made that any closer if I had the desire to. I would like to find the shop, please.

03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:48.240
No. Let's go to this one for that. He can't come over yet.

03:55:52.160 --> 03:55:53.120
Oh, I do have a key.

03:55:56.160 --> 03:56:02.240
Yeah, 11% luck. I'm going to need you to start dropping pickups because I'm starting to not

03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:12.400
think it's 11% luck. I need range as well. I need to be able to safely attack from like halfway

03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:23.520
across the room. A bomb? A bomb's not key though. Can you say key? Right, I'm going to push them

03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:28.000
into the fly on purpose. I could have easily gotten hit by that. I'm not going to lie.

03:56:28.240 --> 03:56:38.320
Okay, he's rejecting key. Right, I'm not laughing anymore video game. I'm getting stressed.

03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:45.200
I'm getting stressed. Okay, we have a key. It's a golden one, so we don't have to sacrifice any key we obtain.

03:56:49.760 --> 03:56:56.960
Why is this map so long? I almost just backed into that. I almost just backed into that. I'm

03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:07.040
not even kidding. Oh, I saw it. The pointy rock in the corner. I am playing so safe. You have no idea.

03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:12.880
I'm trying to range up the exact thing I needed. Hallelujah.

03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:16.800
The game may sometimes deliver.

03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:25.200
Automatically charges and fully charges the active item. Okay, I'll just pick it up now.

03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:34.960
So we can get it even more common. Yeah, this is definitely a bomb run and not any other kind of run.

03:57:38.080 --> 03:57:42.480
I'm stressed. The blood, if I had a heart rate monitor on right now, it is not going to blow

03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:47.840
on 120. Right, we're going to turn back and we're going to go to the item room.

03:57:48.240 --> 03:57:52.880
I love how you can actually do it in pencil. It's so much

03:57:53.920 --> 03:58:02.880
big. Just ask Johnny. It seems like, how about work? Fly is putting in work. The fly is taking

03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:10.000
all of the aggro when we enter a room, which is really, you know, that's such a shame. Yeah,

03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:16.560
the game is like, oh yeah, you get good items. The items in the game. Butt bombs, top blasts.

03:58:16.560 --> 03:58:23.600
Okay, thanks, I guess. That's just an average day for me, if I'm being honest. Butt bombs.

03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:32.320
I love how this began as a demonstration of why lost runs are so hard and then you get a god run.

03:58:33.600 --> 03:58:37.280
The pressure is getting worse, so I feel like I'm going to mess it up really badly,

03:58:37.280 --> 03:58:43.280
which is a shame, but it's kind of on par for me. So I wouldn't be too surprised.

03:58:46.800 --> 03:58:52.640
Wouldn't be surprised at all. Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. Thank goodness that

03:58:52.640 --> 03:59:07.280
fly took the aggro for those spaky guys. Wow. Breathe. I'm so scared.

03:59:07.440 --> 03:59:16.880
I'm going to be sick. I'm actually going to be sick in this run.

03:59:20.080 --> 03:59:23.600
A quarter or a backstab. I'm going to go with a backstab.

03:59:27.600 --> 03:59:33.840
Oh, I'm so stressed. What other items do you need? Everything. Just everything.

03:59:34.480 --> 03:59:37.200
We're on floor five. One more and then we do mam.

03:59:40.160 --> 03:59:44.320
Curse of the blinds. So we don't know what item we're going to pick up, but thankfully

03:59:46.320 --> 03:59:52.560
I made it home. You're alive. You didn't die. Thank you for the tip, Rolly legends.

03:59:55.200 --> 04:00:02.640
Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good. I am so lucky I held back those bullets there.

04:00:04.400 --> 04:00:10.000
Come on. Come on, just die. You're not even a champion.

04:00:14.320 --> 04:00:17.200
I feel sick to my stomach from worry.

04:00:20.880 --> 04:00:26.160
Everyone wants a gamer girlfriend until she throws up on Isaac because she's got a really good last run.

04:00:27.520 --> 04:00:31.120
Okay, we're going to get money from this fight. We know that there's not a greed's fight in the

04:00:31.120 --> 04:00:38.720
shop, so it is worth her here. Oh, my stomach is actually twisting and nervousness. Bro, calm down,

04:00:38.720 --> 04:00:43.520
relax. It's just a video game. If it's just a video game, then why does it make me so happy? Win, win.

04:00:46.160 --> 04:00:49.360
Her palms are swayed. They are freaking, oh, we got another range.

04:00:51.280 --> 04:00:59.040
Oh, this cannot be true. And yet it is my eye. Oh, it's the jumpy ones. It's the ones I don't like.

04:00:59.600 --> 04:01:02.400
They've got blood on their front. That means they're a jumpy one.

04:01:04.720 --> 04:01:07.920
Okay, okay, that's fine.

04:01:10.480 --> 04:01:13.440
Oh, my, I'm not kidding. My guts are genuinely twisting, bro.

04:01:16.880 --> 04:01:21.840
Okay, take your time. Take your, use your, you can

04:01:22.400 --> 04:01:31.840
know again, Hunter. I kind of still want perfection. Whoa, we got planetarium. No way.

04:01:39.360 --> 04:01:45.360
If I lose, you have to comfort me unironically, Ruth, and that's so mean. Putting that pressure

04:01:45.360 --> 04:01:50.880
on me. We got planetarium. Please be political or like something or Venus or take Venus.

04:01:52.160 --> 04:02:02.400
Oh, God. Mars. What does Mars do? I don't know what Mars does. I've never had it before. What does

04:02:02.400 --> 04:02:11.760
Mars do? GG run. Wait, why? What does it do? Double tap the move button.

04:02:12.160 --> 04:02:24.480
This is getting wet. What? Double tap the move button.

04:02:26.800 --> 04:02:33.120
Nothing's happening. Mars is bad. Of course, I get the only one thing that's bad.

04:02:35.520 --> 04:02:37.680
Double tap, move in the same direction.

04:02:37.680 --> 04:02:46.640
What? I have a ram. I have a ram. What's wrong with ram? Am I going crazy?

04:02:48.320 --> 04:02:51.920
Okay, we're better chests. I'll take it. Wait, what's the

04:02:53.440 --> 04:02:56.720
one point? It lets you dash, but it works weird.

04:03:00.480 --> 04:03:02.720
Oh, that's so lucky to fly, honestly.

04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:10.640
Short speed. Flight for the room. No, we need holy mantle. Don't tempt me.

04:03:11.360 --> 04:03:13.600
We already have flight. We're the loss.

04:03:18.880 --> 04:03:22.800
And before I die via mimic chest, I wouldn't put that past me.

04:03:25.280 --> 04:03:26.240
Okay, that's fine.

04:03:26.720 --> 04:03:34.240
Well, we have mum's keys. We actually don't need that.

04:03:36.080 --> 04:03:41.040
Oh, no. These guys will charge across the map. I am letting distance do the rest.

04:03:42.720 --> 04:03:47.600
You can use it to go in the curse room. I am not risking like that. I am not good enough for that.

04:03:47.600 --> 04:03:52.880
Right, we've got the planetarium. We've got everything along the way. Okay.

04:03:53.600 --> 04:03:56.080
Monster 2.0.

04:04:01.840 --> 04:04:07.920
I don't like it. Okay, he's focusing on the fly, though. I'll take it. If you want to charge the

04:04:07.920 --> 04:04:13.920
fly, I was going to keep up with the fly. Oh, this is fantastic for aggro.

04:04:14.000 --> 04:04:20.160
Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, farted, sorry. Excuse me.

04:04:23.200 --> 04:04:26.640
We need to get poisoned. They got poisoned by Mayukas. Mayukas.

04:04:28.320 --> 04:04:30.960
Buy a bow here, ladies and gentlemen. Buy a bow here.

04:04:31.840 --> 04:04:33.680
Oh, right, aggro. He's got aggro.

04:04:34.720 --> 04:04:38.080
Well, okay, I understand the problem now with Mars.

04:04:38.480 --> 04:04:42.400
I did not do that. I understand the problem with Mars.

04:04:43.920 --> 04:04:48.080
I understand the problem with Mars. I don't know what it is, but I'm taking it. It's free.

04:04:48.080 --> 04:04:54.160
Okay, we've got a guppy's hairball, sure. Mars is very bad. I agree. I agree, I agree, I agree.

04:04:57.040 --> 04:05:00.560
Lost fly is good. Right, we're doing the first mum fight.

04:05:01.520 --> 04:05:03.760
It's like we have hardly any damage.

04:05:11.920 --> 04:05:12.560
Someone.

04:05:17.200 --> 04:05:23.760
All right, no mimic chest. What was that? Short speed? That looks like it.

04:05:27.920 --> 04:05:28.880
Take your time.

04:05:31.440 --> 04:05:34.480
Oh, that's in here.

04:05:37.840 --> 04:05:40.720
Oh, that's kind of worth it if I don't fuck up.

04:05:44.000 --> 04:05:46.880
Kind of worth it if I don't mess it up.

04:05:49.360 --> 04:05:52.960
I think I'm going to have to do it. I do. Okay, okay, okay.

04:05:52.960 --> 04:06:01.840
What? You moved me. Please focus on that fly above you.

04:06:03.840 --> 04:06:07.360
Please. The fly. Oh, okay.

04:06:09.680 --> 04:06:13.440
Okay, the poison damage is, I don't know. Did we do it?

04:06:15.120 --> 04:06:21.920
Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. The fly. The fly. Look at the fly. No, Mars, please.

04:06:21.920 --> 04:06:24.000
How did you even do that? I was looking above.

04:06:26.880 --> 04:06:31.840
Oh my gosh. Oh, all right, we've got damage. That's all. Okay, I'm luck. Okay, I'll take it.

04:06:33.520 --> 04:06:38.160
I'm going to be sick. Anonymous. Thank you. You didn't say anything in your message. Thank you,

04:06:38.160 --> 04:06:45.120
though. I will take that as your silent support of this run. This most stressful encounter. I'm

04:06:45.120 --> 04:06:49.360
going to have to tell my dad to stop doing whatever he's doing. I'm actually about to talk.

04:06:50.880 --> 04:06:58.480
It's fine. We're okay. We're okay. Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax. Okay,

04:06:59.840 --> 04:07:09.680
marked. I don't like marked. That's shit. Okay. That's right. Just look at the fly.

04:07:10.240 --> 04:07:17.680
Mimic chest. The fly is so delicious, isn't it? My heart just jumped. It's fine. We have a holy card

04:07:17.680 --> 04:07:24.480
and we have the card repeater. Curse of the maze strikes again. Curse of the maze wasn't supposed

04:07:24.480 --> 04:07:31.200
to put us in here, but okay. We already have it back. Thankfully, we also have voltage or

04:07:31.200 --> 04:07:38.240
whatever it's called. I'll just forget the name between them both. Relax, relax, relax. Safety,

04:07:38.240 --> 04:07:44.000
safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. I'm not sure what we would benefit in an

04:07:44.000 --> 04:07:54.000
arcade. Hell, maybe. Give us our item room. I am, yeah, I was purposely-

04:07:54.000 --> 04:08:13.040
Oh, my heart is jumping. Speed. I'll take speed. That can get us away from the enemy.

04:08:13.680 --> 04:08:24.800
Okay. I can pick all these up. That's fine. Check it was in the shop. A greed bait. That's fine.

04:08:26.800 --> 04:08:32.320
Okay. Okay, absolutely wait for me. That damage upgrade? Fantastic. I'll take 12 more of them,

04:08:32.320 --> 04:08:39.600
please. I'll have 14 more. Right. Okay. So greed can no longer appear in shops because we dealt with

04:08:39.600 --> 04:08:46.320
greed and super greed. So now for the boss. Right, we're going to check out the arcade. I have plenty

04:08:46.320 --> 04:08:57.120
of money to go around. No. But thank you though. But no thanks. Okay, we're just going to gently

04:08:57.120 --> 04:09:06.880
make our way, Mosey, our way back to the boss fight. Now, this is ma'am. Oh, it's the end, isn't it?

04:09:06.880 --> 04:09:11.360
It's the last shop. Oh, you're right. I don't realize how fast we're going through it. Not me going

04:09:11.360 --> 04:09:24.720
faster in this mode than like actually playing a regular cane run. Okay. Okay, okay. That's fine.

04:09:26.560 --> 04:09:33.520
Wow, we are so interested in that one fly, aren't we? Oh, we love that one fly. Thank God I have

04:09:33.520 --> 04:09:37.600
the mod that lets me actually see when she's stomping down. Mars, not now.

04:09:50.240 --> 04:09:51.120
Not now, Mars.

04:09:55.680 --> 04:10:00.480
I was really hoping for a Pluto because we could get such a small hitbox with Pluto.

04:10:01.040 --> 04:10:08.720
We did it. What are we taking though? What's the question? Enjoying, sure.

04:10:10.720 --> 04:10:12.240
What are we taking? Damage?

04:10:17.040 --> 04:10:25.360
Invincibility. That was cat. Damage. Taking damage at half a red heart and none. Damage. Okay, the

04:10:25.360 --> 04:10:36.720
negative. 7.61, that was good. That was good, right. Hold it together,

04:10:36.720 --> 04:10:46.800
refling. Hold it together. I'm very nervous. Yeah, I don't even have one unlock on him.

04:10:47.520 --> 04:10:54.560
Just, I'm going to use a lot of rocks for cover and stuff like that.

04:11:01.680 --> 04:11:07.200
Or moam down like that, that's also an option. I'm going to pick up all I can. If we get like

04:11:07.200 --> 04:11:10.320
beggars, I'm just going to give it to them. They might be able to this.

04:11:10.320 --> 04:11:13.440
Assist us.

04:11:18.000 --> 04:11:21.680
I am so sorry if I seem like such a tryhard. It's because I am tryharding.

04:11:22.720 --> 04:11:25.440
Please follow the fly, not me, the fly.

04:11:28.080 --> 04:11:37.440
Okay, take your time. That was naughty. That was very naughty.

04:11:41.280 --> 04:11:49.440
Oh my god, my dad's gone for a piss.

04:11:50.400 --> 04:12:02.560
The toilet's right outside my door.

04:12:08.240 --> 04:12:13.360
All right, let's try that again, shall we? There's a shame we didn't get more pills. You

04:12:13.360 --> 04:12:16.560
know that should have bought the pills in the shop. I just think I was paying enough attention.

04:12:16.640 --> 04:12:20.240
That's on me. Oh, that's on me. That was my mistake.

04:12:24.480 --> 04:12:31.360
You first. You next. Just take your time. We've got, time is on our side, okay?

04:12:32.320 --> 04:12:36.800
Where there's no timer, there's no rush. We just need to find the boss room.

04:12:39.360 --> 04:12:44.320
I'm fine. I'm not just randomly singing out terrifying fear. Okay, that's fantastic.

04:12:45.040 --> 04:12:48.320
We're going to see if there's a, oh, there you go.

04:12:50.880 --> 04:12:53.120
I just realized that thing splattered and could have got us.

04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:58.080
What the hell, Shrek 5 is real. Are you guys trolling me right now in the middle of this

04:12:58.640 --> 04:13:07.520
very intense game? Please look at the fly. The fly, yes, the fly. The fly. Oh my gosh.

04:13:08.080 --> 04:13:15.520
Oh my gosh, are we going to do it? Size down, hit box smaller. I repeat, hit box smaller.

04:13:17.520 --> 04:13:22.240
Hit box, stop, Marshmars. I was going to say Marshmallow. No.

04:13:27.200 --> 04:13:35.920
Wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay, that's fine. Okay, holy cards. We'll have everything. Okay.

04:13:37.520 --> 04:13:40.960
All out for head. Yeah, Shrek 5 is in production. It's almost enough, so.

04:13:41.680 --> 04:13:46.240
You really deserve a cola. I will, I am going to lie down after this one. I can tell you that much.

04:13:50.960 --> 04:13:57.840
Gamer instinct. Where is the boss? Top left. Okay, gamer instinct. Don't let us down.

04:13:58.880 --> 04:14:02.880
Now again, we have spectral tears. We will use rocks to our full advantage.

04:14:03.840 --> 04:14:11.840
Okay.

04:14:13.360 --> 04:14:16.960
Oh, that's okay, Marsh. You were allowed to do that when I'm not in a fate,

04:14:16.960 --> 04:14:23.600
but when I'm in a fate, Marsh, no, Marsh, that's naughty. You're a naughty boy, Marsh. You know,

04:14:23.600 --> 04:14:30.320
I didn't want you. You know, I wanted you to be Pluto. Shit. Please do not fuck up in this room.

04:14:31.280 --> 04:14:34.880
Okay, yeah, let's go for the day. Yes, yeah, let's go for the...

04:14:35.680 --> 04:14:40.240
See how there was a flat wall and all the enemies spawned right side? Do not tear or touch that.

04:14:43.360 --> 04:14:51.040
Okay. Okay, okay. Sorry, I am tryharding out the Wazoo. I'm not even pretending.

04:14:51.040 --> 04:14:54.480
We could do Gambo, but we don't have a beggar, so there's no point. I'm telling you,

04:14:54.560 --> 04:14:56.880
do it on purpose. I will fly it in your boot, too.

04:14:59.840 --> 04:15:04.960
I don't want to break these rocks. These rocks can break into splatters. I might actually hurt

04:15:04.960 --> 04:15:16.640
myself. I know. Go away. Oh, gamer instinct. Oh, my gosh, gamer instinct. They can fly,

04:15:16.640 --> 04:15:21.760
they can fly. They fly now. They fly now. They fly now. Okay, okay, to get it.

04:15:22.720 --> 04:15:26.560
Yeah, he could fly a couple of episodes back, but it's fine. He'll let us sleep.

04:15:29.120 --> 04:15:32.240
No, I could only be, like, if it wasn't here, I could only be there.

04:15:39.760 --> 04:15:43.200
Oh, no, I messed up. I messed up. I messed up.

04:15:43.840 --> 04:15:48.880
Oh, go for the fly. Go for the fly. We love the fly. We love casting spells. Shadow Wizard,

04:15:49.440 --> 04:15:55.840
yeah. Mars saved me. Mars, I judged you too quickly. Forgive my ignorance,

04:15:55.840 --> 04:16:01.840
for I did not know what I was judging. I love you, Mars. We love the planet. We love the red

04:16:01.840 --> 04:16:09.520
planet. We love the iron-ice planet. Oh, that's fine. It's fine.

04:16:12.560 --> 04:16:18.480
Wait, on half a heart or less, I assume that counts right now. Surely that counts right now.

04:16:19.200 --> 04:16:27.040
Oh, okay, okay, we're in the money. Not as being able to do hush, absolutely not, right?

04:16:27.040 --> 04:16:33.360
We took the negative, we must go down. We must stay focused. Yay, now you're all...

04:16:35.600 --> 04:16:42.640
Babylon works. Okay, gamer instincts. Bottom right, gamer instincts, bottom right.

04:16:42.880 --> 04:16:49.840
Shh, you know what? I've had a lot of gamer instincts today. Let's try that again. I meant

04:16:49.840 --> 04:16:57.920
to say right, right, it's for gamer... Okay, hold on. We can take these. Yes, please. Range,

04:16:59.040 --> 04:17:06.000
speed, sure. Something's wrong. Short speed, absolutely. Power pill, no.

04:17:06.800 --> 04:17:11.920
Okay, please do not whip me through the rock. I would appreciate that.

04:17:13.680 --> 04:17:17.920
Do we want to be max speed? I don't know if we actually want to be max speed,

04:17:17.920 --> 04:17:24.640
because it gets very slippery. No, no, no, no, no, no, focus on the fly, the fly, the fly.

04:17:29.200 --> 04:17:33.920
Oh, are you ranged? Yep, I want to shoot from halfway across the room.

04:17:33.920 --> 04:17:36.320
If I'm correct, about right side gamer instinct.

04:17:42.160 --> 04:17:49.360
I am wrong. Okay, go for the thing, go for the thing, not me, go for the fly. Go for the fly!

04:17:50.880 --> 04:17:58.160
The fly! Go for the fly! Oh, what was the secret room, though? Because why would it be,

04:17:58.640 --> 04:18:06.880
no. Okay, it's top right. I was close. Okay, do not roll over any rocks that have spikes in them.

04:18:07.920 --> 04:18:09.520
What are you and why are you that colour?

04:18:14.480 --> 04:18:19.600
No secret room, secret room above? Okay, these rooms are getting odd, though.

04:18:20.400 --> 04:18:28.560
Stay in the rocks, shiver me timbers. My timbers have been shivered.

04:18:30.560 --> 04:18:36.720
Oh, in the rock. Oh, laser beam! I did not even see that laser beam, that was so lucky.

04:18:37.600 --> 04:18:45.040
I did not even see that beam. I'm happy with my trinket, I will not be tempted.

04:18:49.840 --> 04:18:53.360
He doesn't go away. Okay, that's fine. He doesn't have to go away, okay.

04:18:55.760 --> 04:19:03.760
Gamer, oh no, it's the Satan fight, okay. Gamer instinct, go for the fly. No Mars, not now.

04:19:06.560 --> 04:19:11.520
Okay, they're going for the fly, I'm happy. Okay, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly,

04:19:11.520 --> 04:19:15.840
go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, Satan, go for the fly, go for the fly. We love,

04:19:15.840 --> 04:19:25.760
we love going for flies. Yes, good, Satan. Now, the last fight, go for the fly,

04:19:27.440 --> 04:19:37.920
go for the fly, the fly. We love the fly, we love the fly, we, we lost fly.

04:19:38.080 --> 04:19:47.280
Oh, God, are we doing it? Can we do it? Can we do lamb on tainted?

04:19:49.680 --> 04:19:59.280
Oh, we can take nothing, can we take anything from here? I don't know how it works,

04:19:59.280 --> 04:20:02.080
can we take anything? We have Athene, I've never had Athene.

04:20:02.800 --> 04:20:11.200
Can I take one thing from here? Take one, I am, take brimstone, okay, I trust you.

04:20:14.160 --> 04:20:21.120
Okay, shit. Oh, it's homing, I have homing, I forgot.

04:20:24.000 --> 04:20:28.800
I forgot we had homing. Oh, what, there's three? I thought there was two.

04:20:29.200 --> 04:20:32.000
Two. Mars, not now, buddy.

04:20:39.440 --> 04:20:42.240
I have a sore stomach because I'm gaming so hard.

04:20:44.080 --> 04:20:47.920
Stop, look at the fly, look at the fly, we love the fly.

04:20:49.760 --> 04:20:56.400
How I did not lose anything there. Oh, the fly, please.

04:20:59.440 --> 04:21:05.440
Okay, okay, the fly. No, do not give me bombs.

04:21:09.200 --> 04:21:14.560
Oh, consecutive tier hits, yes sir. The fly.

04:21:16.880 --> 04:21:22.720
You know you want to take that, Gro, I almost just walked into him and substituted my holy mantle.

04:21:23.120 --> 04:21:24.640
Oh.

04:21:27.840 --> 04:21:36.400
Tears can bounce, can brimstone bounce on these cheeks? I'm asking for a friend, can brimstone bounce?

04:21:39.120 --> 04:21:43.840
Oh my gosh, where is it? Is it bottom left?

04:21:47.120 --> 04:21:51.040
It's either left up or down left, so strong I can hear that.

04:21:51.040 --> 04:21:54.800
So strongly I heard the stream is pre-recorded one or counter that.

04:21:54.800 --> 04:21:58.560
I read it before your thing loaded, get right, that's how it's not pre-recorded.

04:22:00.560 --> 04:22:04.000
It's not what we want, but it's okay, thank you for your submission.

04:22:07.920 --> 04:22:14.400
Okay, that's right, like that, the fly is getting, oh, wow, wow.

04:22:14.400 --> 04:22:16.640
Thank you Broly legend for the tip, I'm so sorry.

04:22:17.600 --> 04:22:21.040
Nope, we're absolutely not, proof that this is pre-recorded confirmed.

04:22:21.040 --> 04:22:25.680
That's not, how, oh no, okay, he's gonna be occupied with that fly.

04:22:26.880 --> 04:22:32.800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, it has to be left side.

04:22:35.680 --> 04:22:40.720
I don't, I don't think I want that, I don't know, you guys will tell me if I should take it or not.

04:22:41.440 --> 04:22:47.120
Okay, will you guys tell me if I need that?

04:22:47.680 --> 04:22:52.800
Inner eye, decreases my fire rate, Isaac shoots three tears at once though.

04:22:54.800 --> 04:22:57.520
Triple shot is good, slower shot but three.

04:22:58.320 --> 04:23:00.960
Doesn't give you triple brimstone, I have no idea.

04:23:00.960 --> 04:23:02.480
I have wall bouncing as well.

04:23:05.040 --> 04:23:09.040
Let's find out, is it wall bounce, oh okay, it like fully wall bounces.

04:23:11.280 --> 04:23:16.080
Oh wow, okay, wow, wee wee wow.

04:23:17.680 --> 04:23:19.680
Oh, I missed that shot, that's okay.

04:23:21.840 --> 04:23:24.000
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

04:23:24.640 --> 04:23:29.600
Oh, and we got a fricking unbelievably, we got that back, unbelievably, I can't believe that.

04:23:29.600 --> 04:23:32.080
I do believe, but it happens so I believe it, I believe.

04:23:34.880 --> 04:23:36.960
Spiders do not give contact damage.

04:23:36.960 --> 04:23:44.000
Now, hear me out, we go back and try and pick up as much items as possible or do you think we can do it?

04:23:46.240 --> 04:23:52.080
Did we just go for it or did I go back and pick up as, wait, you say pre, if I unlock delirium,

04:23:52.080 --> 04:23:57.440
you're right, if I unlock delirium we have to send it for delirium, so I'm going to try and unlock everything.

04:23:59.760 --> 04:24:02.960
Perfect, we're gonna, we might get delirium, okay,

04:24:03.680 --> 04:24:06.960
and if we do, I want to be as ready as I can be.

04:24:08.160 --> 04:24:10.240
Mars, you are so cheeky.

04:24:11.680 --> 04:24:15.760
You're a cheeky boy Mars and you know exactly what you're doing, giving me a heart attack.

04:24:18.000 --> 04:24:25.120
Okay, bombs, sure, poison immunity, a chance for a random direction, sure, I'll absolutely take that, are you joking?

04:24:27.440 --> 04:24:28.400
What we got, what we got?

04:24:29.840 --> 04:24:31.920
Invincibility, every six frames,

04:24:33.840 --> 04:24:36.160
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:24:38.400 --> 04:24:47.440
We pray for delirium, we pray for delirium, I can't believe I'm asking for delirium, but I am, no,

04:24:49.360 --> 04:24:53.120
no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, not a good pick up.

04:24:57.440 --> 04:25:01.760
There might be a secret room here but I don't know, I don't know,

04:25:02.320 --> 04:25:10.320
maybe here, there you go, no, room, room, delirium doesn't close when you exit the room,

04:25:10.320 --> 04:25:12.160
I didn't know that, hello, okay,

04:25:14.960 --> 04:25:22.160
come on, Mr. Fly, it's the lost fly versus lamb, it's nothing else, oh, he's like literally synced on

04:25:22.160 --> 04:25:33.680
tom, oh, he's synced on tom, he can't get enough, oh my god, no delirium, no delirium,

04:25:36.240 --> 04:25:45.120
drop, no delirium, okay, we did it though, that's my first fucking win, let's go, gee,

04:25:45.120 --> 04:25:57.440
motherfucking gee, wait, oh, you liar, you liar video game,

04:26:01.280 --> 04:26:03.520
am I getting the unlocks, I'm not getting achievements,

04:26:05.040 --> 04:26:09.280
there they are, I know we're not playing hard mode, I don't care, I'm number one on this one,

04:26:09.280 --> 04:26:18.560
okay, delirium, I'm coming for you buddy, I don't know where you are but let's go for it,

04:26:19.840 --> 04:26:25.440
now you do get boss items by doing boss room so we could upgrade our current stash,

04:26:26.880 --> 04:26:28.320
spiders don't hurt us, let's go,

04:26:29.040 --> 04:26:37.760
oh, can we do delirium as a question, Mars, stop, you naughty boy,

04:26:40.640 --> 04:26:50.000
sure, sure, how do it, oh, come on,

04:26:50.640 --> 04:26:56.560
oh, come on, where's the first boss fight, right, we've got one here,

04:26:59.760 --> 04:27:03.040
okay, school x, not to be confused,

04:27:09.520 --> 04:27:13.600
I mean, at this point does keys make a difference, not really, might as well just take them,

04:27:14.240 --> 04:27:18.560
he could maybe give us a guffy from a red chest if he were to drop one,

04:27:22.480 --> 04:27:26.560
okay, so unfortunately our first item didn't give us anything good but that's okay,

04:27:34.080 --> 04:27:39.200
we're just playing it nice and safe, take that key,

04:27:44.080 --> 04:27:50.480
okay, okay, nice and safe,

04:27:52.400 --> 04:27:56.160
is that a boogie, no I don't want some boogie, thank you though,

04:27:57.520 --> 04:28:00.880
that's a lot of items, keys, oh I could have given it to him,

04:28:02.080 --> 04:28:07.200
didn't take that far, hey did oh, surely I'm just blasting this to oblivion, stream,

04:28:08.000 --> 04:28:15.920
oh, respawn though, what happens if you respawn, don't be shy, respawn some more,

04:28:17.840 --> 04:28:19.920
drain's all short speed,

04:28:24.240 --> 04:28:33.120
wait, keys, you want to take that key, oh no, it's one of these rooms, is it,

04:28:33.120 --> 04:28:38.160
it's one of these rooms,

04:28:44.400 --> 04:28:49.120
I can chase them around the room, oh thank you buddy, look there's more keys for you if you want

04:28:49.120 --> 04:28:55.840
them, what are you thinking, you want this key too, no, you shy, okay, you don't have to,

04:28:55.840 --> 04:29:00.160
you don't have to give me keys all the time, it's fine, oh no, okay, another new chest,

04:29:00.160 --> 04:29:08.880
okay, okay more money, thanks mate, more key, oh, oh I do like bird food, but can I do it,

04:29:09.680 --> 04:29:14.480
can I do it, I've no got two trinket slots, unless, do I, I don't know, I'll go back, oh sorry,

04:29:15.200 --> 04:29:22.560
I was gonna hand it to him physically, after the holy chest it just stops items, I wish I had freaking

04:29:23.520 --> 04:29:30.880
another slot for dead bird because that's like another player on the map really,

04:29:30.880 --> 04:29:38.880
able to, anyways, I start to bless them, I am sweeping, that cannot be a secret room,

04:29:38.880 --> 04:29:55.040
okay, no key, okay, oh, just mild stress with delirium,

04:29:57.840 --> 04:30:05.920
shumer goes to hospital for a heart attack due to playing the lost on Isaac, that'd be quite the

04:30:05.920 --> 04:30:12.480
headline, my stomach's sore, my heart isn't sore, but my stomach's sore, it's twisting,

04:30:12.480 --> 04:30:21.120
out of nervousness, that could have gone terribly wrong, I'll remember there's a

04:30:21.120 --> 04:30:33.280
arrow in here, but there's not too much I can do with it, come on, oh wow, I'd shot too late,

04:30:34.000 --> 04:30:45.360
or early hover, don't do that to me, my heart can't take it, mimic chest, now's not the time to show up,

04:30:45.920 --> 04:30:54.800
now is not the time for mimic chest to show up, do I make myself clear, arrange up,

04:31:02.480 --> 04:31:10.240
full health, full mapping, okay, now we can use this to our advantage,

04:31:11.200 --> 04:31:20.000
if we go down we can get to boss, we can get boss fights that aren't delirium confirmed,

04:31:24.000 --> 04:31:32.160
did I almost just walk into a chest though, I almost did it wrong, okay, we can

04:31:32.480 --> 04:31:35.600
take this, keep her sat,

04:31:39.440 --> 04:31:43.280
I mean it's too late now, I'm sorry,

04:31:45.760 --> 04:31:49.760
keep taking his weakies, I'm sorry, I don't mean it, I promise I'm doing it on purpose buddy,

04:31:51.680 --> 04:31:56.000
which is very low IQ right now, okay there, take it,

04:31:56.240 --> 04:32:00.400
right, this one can't be delirium,

04:32:03.200 --> 04:32:09.120
I'll take that, are you joking, all stats up, I'll take that, right, what one can't be delirium,

04:32:16.400 --> 04:32:19.920
I mean it's unlikely it's this one, it looks like the top left is delirium,

04:32:20.880 --> 04:32:32.960
down is free, gentle, what do we get, a bane, I don't want a bane,

04:32:36.400 --> 04:32:40.960
which one, it looks like that left one, like if you look where I'm literally

04:32:40.960 --> 04:32:45.200
standing in the game on the map, I think that one's delirium, I mean this one

04:32:45.440 --> 04:32:53.120
and the one over there, right, we'll go up for now because I don't think the one up is delirium,

04:32:55.360 --> 04:33:00.160
sack and sausage, I don't even see that, I'll take that, are you joking,

04:33:02.880 --> 04:33:06.160
okay, no keys for you this time buddy, sorry,

04:33:07.040 --> 04:33:16.160
okay, a blast assist, okay, down left is free, okay and then delirium is where I think he is on

04:33:16.160 --> 04:33:24.400
the map, sure bottoms why not, then yeah we've got one more boss to walk by and then it's delirium,

04:33:24.400 --> 04:33:31.360
oh boy, I hope because we are smaller,

04:33:33.360 --> 04:33:40.320
we are gonna be okay, yeah for a second, yeah, I hope because we are smaller, our hitbox does not

04:33:40.320 --> 04:33:50.320
right just, okay,

04:33:54.560 --> 04:34:03.280
okay, that was dangerous, oh there's pins, okay that was lucky,

04:34:03.280 --> 04:34:07.040
okay, oh right,

04:34:10.000 --> 04:34:15.200
how much more OP can I get, I've come on a smaller hitbox, let's go,

04:34:18.160 --> 04:34:25.120
ooh, oh you're so funny like that delirium, you think I didn't see silly sausage, I don't

04:34:25.120 --> 04:34:32.480
know exactly where you are, you think I don't have the skill, the intellect, the foresight

04:34:32.480 --> 04:34:38.240
to know what's going on with you Mr. Delirium, do you think I do not know these things, your

04:34:38.240 --> 04:34:47.520
crafty ways, your terrible reign against poor Isaac that you have, the grasp that the boy cannot seem

04:34:47.520 --> 04:34:58.960
to undo, stop it delirium, you're upsetting me, I'm one shot, no well I have a Hail Mary,

04:35:01.840 --> 04:35:10.560
you're upsetting me delirium, no more will you harm the child known as Isaac,

04:35:10.880 --> 04:35:15.920
the boy will no peace, he will ascend without you,

04:35:22.880 --> 04:35:23.760
did I do it,

04:35:24.080 --> 04:35:32.400
did I do it, I did it, I unlocked ghost bombs,

04:35:34.960 --> 04:35:37.920
I did it, oh my god,

04:35:42.080 --> 04:35:50.480
oh I don't, that's not registered, I did that, I just did that, my first ever look like tainted lost,

04:35:54.640 --> 04:35:58.320
oh my god, that's not registering,

04:36:00.240 --> 04:36:05.600
what did I say about this stream being squitted being pre-recorded and that you would win your

04:36:05.600 --> 04:36:11.200
first lost run on stream, I think maybe you need to comfort me instead of the other way around

04:36:11.200 --> 04:36:19.280
for all the denial, now be a good girl and come cuddle me, oh my god, what just happened,

04:36:20.240 --> 04:36:25.840
thank you so much, anonymous, you never even said anything, thank you tiny spiny for the tip,

04:36:25.840 --> 04:36:32.880
anonymous, congratulations, take my super chat cherry, I think I took it twice,

04:36:32.880 --> 04:36:40.160
did you mean to do that twice, thank you domino mickey, I'm thinking, congratulations,

04:36:40.160 --> 04:36:48.720
take my super chat cherry, I can't believe I did that, our hands are sweating, I'm like ringing my

04:36:48.720 --> 04:36:55.440
hands right now, I'm so nervous, money duplication glitch, thank you, yeah thank you for the money

04:36:55.440 --> 04:37:10.080
duplication, oh my gosh, thank you anonymous, oh my god, we did that, we have ghost bombs,

04:37:10.240 --> 04:37:17.440
oh, we unlocked ghost bombs,

04:37:21.520 --> 04:37:24.720
well I don't know where they'd be but I assume somewhere near the end,

04:37:27.360 --> 04:37:34.000
you're so good, no that was luck, literally we started with homing, the spin is the only reason

04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:40.800
I could do that run, the spoon is the only reason, scrawny has humbling bundle in real life, okay

04:37:40.800 --> 04:37:47.360
that's actually really good, ghost bomb for ghost bomb, you have to take them up to have them appear

04:37:47.360 --> 04:37:52.720
twice, might have said in before at the start the run that died on the second room doesn't count,

04:37:53.360 --> 04:37:59.760
thank you no alessandro, we did it, amazing performance, I don't know how I did that,

04:38:00.160 --> 04:38:06.080
ghost bombs, I don't know where they're hiding but they're somewhere here,

04:38:08.240 --> 04:38:15.360
I can't believe that, that's absolutely amazing, there, there you are Mars, I could have rolled

04:38:15.360 --> 04:38:20.720
anything else, radiant victory, the moon's blessing, so secret rooms, mercury speed up,

04:38:20.720 --> 04:38:27.120
you feel elusive so I'm super fast, venus, I have charm effect, born of rock destroy stuff,

04:38:27.120 --> 04:38:34.240
