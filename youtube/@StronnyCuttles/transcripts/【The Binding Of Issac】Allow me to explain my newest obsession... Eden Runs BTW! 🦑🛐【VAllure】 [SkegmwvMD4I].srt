1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, so if I push for me, you read it, you read it, you read it, are you waiting until

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
it registers? For some reason it doesn't register, really.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll wait for YouTube to prompt me to put ads on, that's when I know I can start talking

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as soon as YouTube's like, do you want to put ads on? I'm like, no. No, I'm running

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
started with a stream, why would I want to put ads on? Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is my fucking model crashed? Whoa! Excuse me, I saw that. OBS is currently eating 40%

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OBS, hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who or what? Nothing is open.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
OBS, relax! 40%? The Binding of Sheevee, honestly. I do not know why I'm lagging.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is there memory leak on the fucking main menu? Goddamn. Don't laugh that I'm not on a

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
win streak. Me, thank you for becoming a member. Dear Asical, thank you for redirecting into

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
my high snowberries, I don't know why OBS is melting. Whoa, you're breaking my model,

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OBS, what the fuck? Holy shit, I think it's not an Isaac Data leak, it literally says

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OBS bro, you need to calm down, who or what? I got the movie, I got the movie open for later,

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I might have to delete the answer. I'm sure maybe that much of a video. Right, looks good bro,

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I enter the news, I'll pretend that my model isn't lagging. So this game is called the

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Binding of Isaac, is that a biblical reference? Yes it is, this game is about a 5 year old

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
boy called Isaac. Just close and reopen OBS, I don't know how to inform you, OBS is what

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm streaming to you on, you're asking me to reset the stream, no chance. You should

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
reinstall it. So this is the Binding of Isaac and it is about a poor 5 year old boy who

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,000
experienced severe religious trauma and this poor boy has to go, I don't know the quickest,

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
basically long story short, he sees himself as a bad child, he sees himself as a part

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,000
of the devil and he chooses to lock himself in a chest in his room, all while his poor mother

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and father are trying to find them, unfortunately his mother and father split, but these characters

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you see on this main menu, Isaac, Magdalene, Cain, Judas, Eve, Samson, sorry Blue Baby,

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Samson, Azazel, Lazarus, Eden, The Lost, Lilith, Keeper, Apollyon, The Forgotten, Bethany,

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Jacob and Isu, these are all Isaac, my poor little boy Isaac is currently inside a chest

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
hallucinating due to the fact he is losing oxygen inside the chest. We are going to do

28
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what's called an Eden run, Eden tokens you might notice, what did I purposefully plan

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
such an escapade on Eden tokens, no that's just how perfect the world is for us reeflings

30
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and snow bears are hanging out too, thanks snow bears, I do appreciate you, so poor little

31
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Isaac, we are going to do what's called an Eden run, Eden starts with two, statistically

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
two items, although you can start with an active item, a passive item and a trinket,

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
if you're really lucky, but it's completely random what you get, so we look at Lazarus

34
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in comparison, we see Lazarus has three hearts, two speed and two damage, Eden is randomized

35
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and it can produce quite a unique run, so we're going to try an Eden run, just normal,

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've not played, the last time I played actually was when the girls had just been picked, okay

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
so we have the pickaxe, our passive is the wafer, do you see that little tiny red circle

38
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
under the minimap, look I'm kissing it, see this little circle, thank you June for becoming

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
a member, I appreciate it, the wafer means that I take half health damage now, so this

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is an incredibly lucky run, and my active item is the pickaxe, which can actually let

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
me get into secret rooms in this game, that circle will literally be, okay, so now I want

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you to notice this detail, I'm going to write a review on this game, this is a 10 out of

43
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
10 game experience for me, so if we look at our stats on the left side, Isaac's base stats

44
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
are 1.0 for speed, that's a little boot with speak marks coming behind it, I always get

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
fire rate and tier size mixed up, but it's below average, our range isn't awful, but everything

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is really not the best stat wise, we have a pretty decent tier rate honestly, not bad,

47
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
not bad at all, unfortunately, unfortunately, it could be better, what have we got, so this

48
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is a passive unfortunately which will not give us anything other than money, now there

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
are shops in this game, oh see this is a perfect example of why our starting item is such a

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
good lucky pull, we normally would need a bomb in order to access this, so because we

51
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
already have a soul heart on our persons, we are going to pick it up because we will take

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
soul heart damage over red heart damage, I already missed the rock because our tinted

53
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
rocks also wasn't paying attention, oh wait, am I going to, no, sorry, sorry, wait what

54
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
do you mean I missed our rock, motherfucker, right, there's also a thing called tinted

55
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
rocks in this game as well, whoa, right, we've got BFF, that's pretty decent, and the item

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
room, oh for fuck's sake, right, hold on, hold on, embarrassing, embarrassing, here's

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
me trying to be like, oh this is how this game works, and of course I missed something

58
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
really obvious, oh for dear eye, I was like eh, there's no rock back here, oh that's so

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
obvious, okay so there's also a thing called tinted rocks, when you destroy them you have

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the odds of getting one soul heart are pretty high, now you also can spawn trap doors, and

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
depending on if they have a ladder or not, it would actually be kind of nice to get BFF

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
in case we pick up a familiar, the odds of receiving a familiar in the game are pretty

63
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
high, so these stone guys aren't real enemies, but I would like you to take a note, look at

64
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
our body, and then look at the body of the enemies, okay, okay he may have just walked

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
into the fire, all the enemies are poor little Isaac, and all the rooms are Isaac in the

66
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
chest, look at the shape of this room, now I know you might be saying absolute schizophrenic

67
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
gameplay, what do you mean the room, the room's rectangular, it's one of the most common

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
shapes, and that doesn't make sense because look at the room you're going up ahead, look,

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
they had to do some stuff, okay just relax, we're getting the pickaxe out, it's very safe

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to have the pickaxe, but everything relates to poor little Isaac being in a chest, now

71
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I knew the secret room was most likely there due to this long room especially spawning in

72
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
on a flat floor, so this is called a bomb beggar, you can't, fantastic, fantastic, we are finding

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
so many soul hearts, which I will tell you exactly why in the next level is very important

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to get these soul hearts, so this is a bomb beggar, an exchange of la bomba, he can potentially

75
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
give us a payout of keys, of money, so if you wanted to do a cheeky exchange rate you most

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:43,000
certainly can, but the original game, are you going devil, no, I am an angel player,

77
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
now unfortunately me, thank goodness I was actually going to, that went really well,

78
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
oh right, so sometimes rooms can spawn spiders that weren't originally there, if you don't

79
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
want to, I have watched so many people play this game and I actually had no idea what's

80
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
going on until now, allow me to explain, I started this game this year and it's just

81
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
absolutely fantastic, so we're not going to carry this pill, but notice how it says

82
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
question mark or unidentified pill, it could potentially be a good pill, it could potentially

83
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
be a bad pill, I personally am not risking any stats down at the moment because we are

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
needing a bit of health and this card, the two of hearts, not any tyrant cards, the two

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
of hearts, doubles Isaac's red hearts, well that's actually pretty terrible, in all actuality

86
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that's pretty terrible, we might get a machine, so we've discovered those two secret rooms,

87
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
so there's a secret room, a super secret room and there's actually an ultra secret room

88
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
which we do not have access to, nor can I guess where it's located on the map, we could

89
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
go inside, this is what's called the cursed room, so the reason why we're going to go

90
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
in the cursed room, you notice those teeth marks around it, danger, danger, not good,

91
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
however we have the wafer which means we will take half health, so for the sacrifice of

92
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
one soul heart, we might be able to get something better, so we're going to risk it, we're going

93
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to risk it, we have received two black hearts, these have a necronomic effect, I'm an idiot

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
there's a penny back in that room, we are going to bomb up my donation machine, you can

95
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:45,000
see it's a bit low, so necro hearts are, we are going to pick up BFF, oh ok, we're not

96
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
going to pick up BFF against the sadness of my heart because the likelihood of us doing

97
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
it, we do have piggy banks, so we're going to get members access which opens up a, oh

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
did I just freaking buy a pill, I might as well take it then right, what is it, what's

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the pill, ok it was actually a tears up, ok so that means we fire more tears, that was

100
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
so lucky, we're not doing BFF, however we now have access to a secret shop, no it will

101
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
be a ridiculous price and unfortunately it's very unlikely we'll be able to, again with

102
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the spiders, it's very likely, we're going to have to raise our economy, however thanks

103
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to the pickaxe, we can destroy, honestly we might as well just destroy, oh wait hold on

104
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
we're not even done the boss fight yet, ok first boss fight, now you might notice those

105
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
two symbols, bottom left on the statistics look I'm getting closer to them, see these,

106
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
this is devil deal and angel deal chance, you do not spawn devil deal or angel on the

107
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
first floor, doesn't matter, you can't get it, the exceptions are if you have a joker

108
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
card, you spawn in with goat head for example, but for the first floor of the game, you ain't

109
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
getting nothing, you ain't getting nothing, sit down ok, was the same colour of the pill

110
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the one you skipped, let's find it, no, so this is not a tears up or else it would identify

111
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
itself as a tears up because we now know what type of pill that is, ok, so again we've

112
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
discovered both rooms, we have actually purchased a secret member door, we do unfortunately

113
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
have yet to receive the gurglings, right, three of them, this is terrible streamer luck,

114
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
back off, stay back, on guard, on guard, ok so we just had a necronomic effect which is

115
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
ok, that was terrible luck, ok we do receive a speed upgrade which is good, we are now

116
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
above speed, the base game speed so we'll be able to kind of dodge more enemies, that

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
was terrible luck three of them, but anyway we now have enough speed to get away from

118
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the most average enemy to make a bit of a room between us, ok, but we did it, we destroyed,

119
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
oh poor Isaac, he got jumpscared on the toilet, Isaac is not, so you'll now notice on bottom

120
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
left we now have 100% chance of a devil deal, if we were to receive any red heart damage

121
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we have two red hearts, a lot of souls and we necro as well on top, ok, sorry I'm going

122
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to drink my tea, before anyone that does know this game, no we're not doing boss rush, a

123
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
kibiar's, unless we get Miss Bomba, I forget her name sometimes, I'm going to sit with

124
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:53,000
my tea, but yes this game is absolutely fantastic, unfortunately for level 2 we got what's called

125
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the burning base mint, if you look on the walls you'll notice there's fire but what

126
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
means is that there's also a few enemies on this floor, Mama Mega, there you go Miss Mega,

127
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I was close enough, Mama Mega is the exception that'll let you into the boss rush room, but

128
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
no we're not going to do any alt pathing, we're not going to do any of that, I'm just going

129
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
to show the basics, we're going to hopefully have a successful run, I would very much enjoy

130
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
an item that does some, is that a cat hair in my tea, I swear Gimli, is that a cat hair

131
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in my tea, hold on a minute, no oh my god it's just schizophrenia, it's just schizophrenia

132
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry, right hold on, no we're not doing hush either but yes this game is a 10 out

133
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
of 10, it is absolute chaos the first time you play it and I kid you not it takes hours

134
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
upon hours to even comprehend what you're doing, you might think oh Isaac, Binding of

135
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Isaac that we game, where that cute little pixel boy runs around, absolutely not, this

136
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
game is horrific but I will point out we picked up the bell and look at our stomach, we have

137
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a bell on us now, as you pick up items Isaac will reflect those items, that's why we're

138
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
currently glowing blue right now, that is because of the wafer, fantastic angel item

139
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that we spawned in, it's just schizophrenia, I relate to that on a personal level, don't

140
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you have to unlock the burned rooms too, yes I forgotten how I unlocked it but yeah, Binding

141
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
of Isaac players be like I have 4000, I'm still a rookie, yes so this game, if it is

142
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
a game for you or might be a game for you, it becomes multiplayer in November which obviously

143
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you know exactly what that means, we flings, we're all going to be playing it together,

144
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the lobby sizes can go up to 4, so basically we're going to have quite a few endurance

145
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
marathons and multiplayer together, Strone is truly the Binding of Isaac Warmaster, I

146
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
wish we could do an omega run, the likelihood of an omega run is absolutely minuscule unless

147
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
our secret room, actually speaking of secret room, how cool would it have been if it was

148
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
in there though, imagine if it was, sometimes the secret room spawns directly in the room

149
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you spawn in, well it is a lovely game and I can't wait to play with you in November

150
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
if you are an Isaac player, I do not have all unlocks, I do not have, I don't even have

151
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
a second file, you're supposed to have all unlocks on a file 2 and 3, I don't even have

152
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
them on one, but the items you receive from the treasure room, from the shop etc will

153
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
shape your run as well as the angel and devil deals will come in clutch, now originally

154
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I said I would do angel deals but I have to admit with our high HP right now I'm a bit

155
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
tempted, I have so many arrows in the game I still don't know how to spawn the angel

156
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
room, if you take, if you walk inside a devil deal, you are not allowed an angel room, if

157
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,080
you walk inside it, if you ignore it and go down into the next level your angel room will

158
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,320
take over your devil room percentage, you can also raise it by going on the sacrifice

159
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:51,080
room, or I think it's called the sack shuffle to some people, don't give in to temptation,

160
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,360
no I want to show you the power of angel deals, I also want to show you something critical

161
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,920
you must do if you want to raise your angel deals, I will also do it in greed mode, I'm

162
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,240
going to play one Eden run and then we're going to play one Lilith greed mode, just

163
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,080
to talk through the mode, greed mode Lilith is the easiest character you can play by

164
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:21,480
far due to her treasure blocks, I've almost finished my tea I promise, I promise, Lilith

165
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,240
Seals so okay I'm going to get a wee drink of water as well, I can open it this time

166
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,040
without my wrist cracking, you're allowed to visit but don't take anything, I haven't

167
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,320
found that unless I'm being daft, I always find ignoring it is the way it goes, right

168
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,200
this room is smaller on her little map, can you see her little map on the top right, so

169
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,760
likely there's not too many enemies in here, so we are just going to go this way but yeah

170
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,880
there we go, and now he shoots in a diagonal at diagonal, up at downy 4, these red poops

171
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
cannot be destroyed and you do not get items from them, do not be fooled, do not be fooled

172
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,680
they are not good, but you will get, you will encounter enemies that like you can't reach

173
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:14,960
or you can't do anything with, okay no, no I'm not energy, if I could get a spoon spender,

174
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
if I could get a spoon spender that would be great, so we only have one key right now,

175
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,320
so I'm actually going to pass on the shop, we only have three coins so there's no point,

176
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm going to look for a tinted rock but there's no tinted rock in this room, well I have,

177
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Jesus, getting my hammer out for this one, get down, relax, I only just got in the room,

178
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,840
there is a chance, there you go, I was going to say, there is a very high chance your secret

179
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,160
room is actually right before the boss, it's so common, curious, I do not have, your luck

180
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,560
percentage doesn't affect machines like that, apparently, but I don't know how much I believe

181
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,760
that, peeking the first devil deal makes you next 50-50, but if you ignore then it locks in,

182
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,040
okay that makes sense, okay we're gonna get the fucking pickaxe out again, geez, we keep

183
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,480
getting rooms that are like really bad, right, again we only have one key so we're going all out

184
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:30,400
on the item room, surely, surely it's a good item, it's an active item, yeah, okay, I don't need

185
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:41,360
an active item, maybe we can get a black rune, don't want to, oh, yep, okay, sorry, I saw that

186
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,400
come in halfway across the room, I was like, I do not have the speed for these guys, okay,

187
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,560
one more, one more, one more, those Isaacs have a bomb in their head and they chase you down,

188
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:04,080
which isn't very nice, but is that gonna stop them, no, so we actually are gonna bomb for this one,

189
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,080
the reason because is we can actually get money from the pops, like that, so again, spider spawned,

190
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,760
but we're just gonna leave the room, don't even have to deal with them, as for the secret room,

191
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,080
okay it's here, sorry, I have a bit of sense through the classic Isaac gaming experience,

192
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,720
but we've discovered both our rooms, again we don't actually have any keys to access the shop,

193
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,960
nor do we have enough for the premium item, sometimes items can be for sale in the shop, but

194
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:44,000
we don't have a key, so we can't go in, however, we could bomb this fortune teller machine up for

195
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,680
a chance, for a chance of a coin or a soul heart, but hey, I'd rather not gamble like that, I have

196
00:22:51,680 --> 00:23:00,000
found, oh, Jukka flies very easy enemy, oh my god, it's a big fly though, relax, I don't have the

197
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,560
damage for all of this, relax, okay it's fine, it's fine, Jukka is very weak to bombs actually,

198
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,080
so I'm just gonna put one, Jukka is very weak to bombs, so I'm just gonna, there we go, there we

199
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,120
go, there we go, I was gonna say something, I'm just gonna put one down, he's very weak to bombs,

200
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,640
so again, the devil deal has spawned, but we say no, we have received a range upgrade, and was that

201
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,640
tier size, I wasn't paying attention, is this after birth, this is all of them, I've completely

202
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,440
forgotten, so again, we don't have a key, we're gonna have to say sorry shop, and the active item

203
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,640
was a lobomba, again, apologies lobomba, but you do not do anything for us, there's no tinted rock in

204
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,120
this room as far as I can see, well, time to go next, we're saying no thank you to El Diablo,

205
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,920
you could visit the curse room, I could, but because I had necronomic hearts, I like them as

206
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:12,080
a lifeline, yeah, not this time, right, let's get toot, oh, I'm getting so distracted, sorry I was

207
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:20,720
gonna talk about this flat wall, hold on, hold on, are you trolling me right now, right, notice how

208
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,280
flat this wall is here, there's nothing against, oh for fuck's sake, of course it's not even the

209
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,560
secret room, I was gonna be like, if you ever enter a room and there's like a really flat wall,

210
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,720
that was absolutely terrible, hold on, I need MLG this right now, okay boom, normally the,

211
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,360
oh for fuck's sake, I hate these guys as well, yeah, it's even they do like a triple spray, like

212
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,600
bro, you don't even have the, you don't even have three familiar transformation, I've forgotten what

213
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,120
it's called, you can't hurt him unless he's shown his wee neck, thankfully, oh wait, hold on, this

214
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:08,240
wall is flat, okay, there we go, this wall is flat, so I came to, leave me alone, Mr. Spider, I'm so

215
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,960
bad against spiders, literally it's the only thing that freaking kills me in this game, now we have

216
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:24,160
a bit of a gamble, whoa, what did you do, a sack, oh well, we have a bit of a gamble, right, so look

217
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,600
at my angel percentage, it says 33.8%, we are going to bomb this corpse in here, and look, it went up by

218
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,000
2.5%, so when you bomb it, I guess previous Isaac bodies is really the only way to see it, we're

219
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,360
going to come back, we're going to come back to that room, let him get up, let him get up, although

220
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:53,200
actually you can get in golden chests, you actually can get a few items in a secret room from a

221
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,960
gold chest, so we may, I don't know, I don't want to miss the shop, we have really good economy and

222
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,120
we have a member's card, which means we have access to, oh right, there we go, boom, boom, boom,

223
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,920
let's see what's in here, key, we got our money, we got a key back, there we go, we have a tier

224
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:17,600
upgrade and range and three random hearts, and we get very lucky with an necronomic and a soul,

225
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,240
because we have that soul heart, I am happy to go back into the curse room, I'm going to sacrifice

226
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,560
the soul heart to see what's at curse, are you fucking kidding me, it's just more spiders,

227
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,160
um, now unfortunately our damage is low, which means that we are having to lick these enemies

228
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,240
for quite a few moments, unfortunately he splits into two spiders, which I'm not looking forward

229
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,760
to, there you go, um, now we, this does count as an active reward, like an active item reward,

230
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,200
doing a room like this, but that is a shame that we didn't get a payoff, but hey, what the heck,

231
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:04,560
uh, what a strange room, right okay, we've got super sloth, which isn't ideal with our freaking

232
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:15,840
terribly low damage, and all these, wow, these things are absolutely, oh dear, oh my god,

233
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,960
oh I need to start out spiders, please, no please, please, no what the heck, he can, stop, stop,

234
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,800
stop, this is awful, stop, this is truly awful, please, stop, stop, stop, or my damn right,

235
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,200
you're giving me a pedestal item, that couldn't have gone any worse, that's actually not that bad,

236
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:47,600
right, if, okay, okay, we've got a black rune, um, we've also picked up a trinket that lets us,

237
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,680
that was the worst, I couldn't have made that any worse if I tried, um, this is, that's why I'm

238
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,040
saying we are very low damage, things are able to punish us very harshly, I'm just gonna check

239
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,920
there's no tinted rock in here, no, not as far as my elf eyes can see, that was awful, and of course,

240
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,680
please, I want spoon bender, so I don't actually have to aim, that would be great,

241
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,480
one spoon bender, or familiar spoon bender, I'll take it, okay, there we go, now we do have a

242
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,560
chess, which we've got two hearts from, please,

243
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,240
um, right, so because we picked up the trinket on this floor, we actually don't have the respawn

244
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,480
box, which is a shame, we are gonna take ice baby, we might be able to get conjoined three,

245
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,440
now if we end up getting conjoined, this is where we go, draft, the game could have,

246
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:54,000
um, the game could have, it's icy, oh it's icy actually, hold on, let's see if we can pick up

247
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,640
an item for everyone, oh okay, Miss Dolly's gonna be sheebie, because sheebie has nice blonde hair,

248
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
and then the red bow will be the red at the bottom of her hair,

249
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Emi is something evil, we don't have anything evil for Emi yet, but we're gonna pick it up,

250
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:21,600
we're gonna hopefully get conjoined, normally you get a few more, see, oh my gosh, right,

251
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,640
we need to stop taking damage, I ain't joking the way for saving us, re-factor, thank you very much

252
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,400
for coming to member, so once an enemy's frozen you can actually use them to attack, um, I don't

253
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,800
know where the secret room is, other than that one we're at, lawyer, I really don't like long

254
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:47,760
room spawning in because I, oh they're bombs, the, the spiders are bombs, wow, are you joking that

255
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,440
tiny wee thing, ah we're actually losing, the raw embarrassment, whoa,

256
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,040
birthright and steam sale, steam sale lowers everything by half, birthright gives us three

257
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:12,880
items to choose from, uh we've got dead bird, we can put our health up and shot speed up over dead

258
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,120
bird, I don't know, dead bird might help us though, if I'm completely messing up, I mean

259
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,880
there's no point in doing duality, oh is there though, no because we're going for angel,

260
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,840
I, I mean shot speed going up or a bird that comes in attacks every time I take damage,

261
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,320
wait I get electric at both, spawns both in devil and angel room if either,

262
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,600
entering one makes the other disappear, I don't know, I,

263
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,480
dead bird's gonna fm up though for me which is kind of what I'm needing, not gonna lie, not gonna lie,

264
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,640
I'm kind of needing a bit of dead bird, but I'm needing health as well, right, fuck it dead bird,

265
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,960
Eve come on in, right let's see what's going on down here in the basement, hello,

266
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,920
hello, this soul, grants an aura that repels the projectiles, I know there's red key,

267
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,000
um this is such a good batch as well because this would give me conjoined part two of three,

268
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm going for repel,

269
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm going to see if we can come up with the money,

270
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,920
right okay okay we can get conjoined part two, okay okay conjoined part two, oh my god look at it,

271
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,520
oh he's got we nail, we, that red key is pretty special,

272
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm gonna see if we can get a money off this keeper as well, no didoms,

273
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,640
he does a veep attack this fly so you can kind of ignore him, are we that,

274
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,640
we got a dame, wait oh we don't have enough though, wait,

275
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:21,600
okay there we go, I was going to say the odds, and another soul, wow, wowie we wow,

276
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,680
we're actually doing very lucky, yeah how do you say lucky, lucky, lucky, even though I suck at

277
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,280
the fates, but we're actually doing pretty decent, why are you spawning two enemies,

278
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,760
this is so unfair and I got hit, that's right, no get him get me, get him get me, beat him up,

279
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
hold it, go get me go, go get me go, wow, let's go get me, you did it, and we got PJs,

280
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,880
now we're full health, wow that's actually pretty insane, right a special fact with the angel deals,

281
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:05,040
health up and damage, okay this if you want to continually get angel deals you have to do this

282
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:12,720
thing that makes no sense, you have to attack this angel and they will drop a key piece which

283
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,560
which raises your chances of getting more angel deals, don't don't ask to make sense of it,

284
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:27,600
it makes no sense, literally attack an angel and oh I do have a mod that lets me know when they're

285
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:35,680
laser fire because I have a few mods, I have laser fire mod, I have mum stomp because I can never

286
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,320
see when she's gonna stomp down on me, I'm absolutely rubbish at it, truly rubbish, so angels

287
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,760
can actually, I forget his name, but he can actually hurt himself on the blue fires, blue fires

288
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,080
or you have a chance to drop, okay this is what we don't want with him spawning loads of different

289
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,240
little guys, because that is gonna add up to damage over time which we're not interested in,

290
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:10,960
you might notice our little buddy is bringing in some big massive hand, that is called big brother

291
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,760
or little brother, his hand comes up, right here we go, so key piece two, getting both parts opens

292
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,960
a big golden door, don't worry about the golden door okay, I doubt we're gonna do it, 25% angel

293
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,560
room chance and our chance for an eternal heart goes up just a smidge, an eternal heart if you

294
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,680
take it to the next floor will give you a full red heart, but again our angel deal chance has now

295
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:42,080
just gone up considerably, now we are full health so we don't need to bomb this fire for a chance of

296
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:48,480
soul heart, we are good to go, so that was an incredibly good one, no we're not going down the

297
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,760
alt path, I'm too scared and it's too late anyway, we're not going against mother, we're going against

298
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,680
mum, we have discovered both of our lovely jubbly secret rooms, we do have 15 bucks which is not

299
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,320
enough for the red key, although I'll be honest and say I have zero success finding the ultra

300
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,680
secret room, I see that I am description mode, oh yes, the creator Ed McMuffin as he likes to go

301
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,880
by, whoa we got a library, oh we have no keys, oh that's not good, okay libraries if there's three

302
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,840
books inside gives a, whoa a transformation chance to get bookworm which means we will have a chance

303
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:42,560
to throw out two tiers pair, like two tiers like this, we need, whoa, I am so bad at dodging

304
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,160
anything, did you see those spiders come, oh sorry fuck them up Gamma, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma go, right

305
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,520
we do have a key, I'm gonna risk it and hopefully we get rewarded with bookworm with three books inside

306
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:02,000
close enough, right 40 damage to all in the room or a black heart however

307
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,600
using the item before boss fight makes the reward a devil deal, purchasing it does cost

308
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,800
does not affect item pedestals in the voice, now I am going to take this, the reason is because

309
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:25,200
it is infinite health source, I, I have faith, unfortunately this key beggar, I'm sorry I have

310
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,320
no keys, he will have a higher chance to drop a key which he does, thank you very much, we say

311
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,480
thank you pickaxe for doing your duties, you've done us fantastic, we have discovered all the secret

312
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:47,360
rooms so far, we are going to ultimate because we can basically take devil items and be rewarded

313
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,280
without the penalty of not being a loud angel, I am absolutely messing this up, sorry the,

314
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,360
the familiars hook attack is really messing up with my eyes right now, yeah that's right just

315
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,360
blame the game, blaming the game on itself, yeah maybe I'm just a bad player, I don't know you'll

316
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:12,960
never know, devil items statistically are very strong however angel items you can roll an

317
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,760
absolute terrible angel room, you can absolutely terrible like I don't know I guess the urn thing

318
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,560
that pot thing that I never bother with is just awful, a little mushroom guys they have a lot of

319
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:36,000
HP, I don't know if I want to use a key on that, I'll use a key, two bombs in exchange of one key

320
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,040
when our economy on bombs is pretty high is perfectly fine, it's a bit rough but it's fine,

321
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,840
we could go for this, ah fuck it, let's just go for the chest, let's see what's inside,

322
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,600
let's see what's inside, oh we, oh we have an extra soul heart, fuck it,

323
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:07,840
okay guess I deserve that, you suck, okay, yeah soul heart, rubbish that's why I hardly ever do

324
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,120
the curse room because it's so stinky honestly, okay that was really lucky that our guy has curved

325
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:20,080
bullets, now because we have so much HP we could consider the sacrifice room rather dangerous but

326
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:31,040
but I mean we're not doing, we're not doing bad, these guys aren't too rubbish, a little bit rubbish,

327
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:39,920
they kind of suck, we could consider it because actually I'm feeling risky you know that I'm

328
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,720
feeling riskier, I'm feeling a bit riskier, is this where the secret room is, yes, player instinct,

329
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,080
so this is a mimic chest, do you notice the blood on the bottom right, this, you will have to sacrifice

330
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,280
health in order to access this chest, now I am going to do it because we have the wafer,

331
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,200
whoop, whoop, we got a bomb and some money again, not, not absolutely not, the chest

332
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,720
cannot hurt you, once you've opened up the mimic chest cannot hurt you, so don't worry,

333
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,080
the sac room will give us a lot of piggy bank money, you are absolutely correct little rifling,

334
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:24,720
thank you for reminding me, I think we're gonna do it, I think we're gonna be a bit crazy

335
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,360
into the sacrifice room, now I will talk through the sacrifice room and I will give you all the

336
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,840
secret deets and all, but the reason we're gonna do it is because it's going to significantly

337
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,920
raise our, or it should anyway, significantly raise our angel chance which means we don't have to skip

338
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:50,160
a floor of no chance, it's very good to try and avoid having no kind of reward, now you'll always

339
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,600
have a boss item, you'll always have a treasure room, don't get me wrong, again we have the bible,

340
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:03,600
right, there should be a pay to win machine in here, ah, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

341
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,400
have satanic bible, right, those flies can't hurt you but they can take away charges on your active

342
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,120
item, so for example satanic bible has six active charges, those little guys will come and bop you

343
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,720
and all you'll hear is mew, mew, we are not gonna spend our money just yet because I want to see

344
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,760
what the shop has to offer but we might purposely roll for conjoined, let's see what the shop has

345
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,000
to say first before we make a decision, okay, now we are just gonna kind of run around, we are

346
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,520
getting poison damage by our familiar, very happy with that, again free, there, no, okay unfortunately

347
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,520
it's a, no, okay, the more money you hold in your hand the more likely you are to spawn a greed

348
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,240
fight, this is called a greed fight, there are no items in the shop, we are very lucky to have the

349
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,800
membership passive which means we do still have access to a shop down below, it's not restockable,

350
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm like 99% sure it's not restockable the way we, this shop would be, oh no, gammy,

351
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,800
you're too late, I messed up, I lost some hearts for that, I suck, gammy, I've let you down but

352
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,400
thank you for your service, gamgoo, we appreciate you, okay, let's see what we're looking at,

353
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:30,160
we've got a necronomic, we can sacrifice, 50% chance for a treasure room, I think we're on floor

354
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,320
three so there's like three more, no, no, we're better with restock, we have very good economy,

355
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,400
look at A.C. just hiding behind the ladders, A.C. do you want to, oh well there you go, we are

356
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,000
going to do the sacrifice room now because again we have the wafer which makes sacrifice rooms

357
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:00,000
very worth its while and I'm feeling lucky, okay so because I have the item description it tells

358
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,560
me exactly what's coming up next, 50% chance for a coin, do you feel, are you feeling lucky

359
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,560
brief ones, are you, oh yeah right because we have piggy bank we got more, okay we didn't

360
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,280
actually get a payout so look 67% chance for an increase, we didn't get it, of course we didn't,

361
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,080
okay we've got a chest, let's go, bomb and a key, lovely, lovely, okay are, wow it only did 6% are you

362
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:39,360
serious, okay okay yeah one more, right we got our heart back that's fine so this one

363
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,320
you bop it, run out, run away, run inside, spawn the angel and go bombs, go fuck them up,

364
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,440
fuck them up, go gammy, go gammy, go, right the reason why we're destroying this angel,

365
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,760
yes I know there's a host in the corner I'm trying to avoid him, the reason we do this is

366
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,000
because we now have two key pieces, look our angel it has increased again I shouldn't have picked

367
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,520
that up yet, okay this is the last upgrade, it's 50-50, money or soul hearts, okay this is very good

368
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,360
for us we're gonna keep the restock box, trinket, it means there'll be a restock machine that spawns

369
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,240
in our lovely jubbly treasure room, item room and we are gonna focus on that, I am now going to use

370
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,120
satanic bible because we're going to try and maximize our hearts now that we've done that so

371
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,440
we're just gonna roll, I see you're right on top of the item so it's a bit hard to tell what we're

372
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:50,000
looking at, no not very good, unfortunately we actually have too many soul hearts etc

373
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,600
and we don't need to spawn Gabriel because we have a full key piece already so there's no need to

374
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,960
spawn Gabriel, no need at all we've got full key it will not increase our angel chance or anything

375
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,320
like that don't worry and so again candy to heart we can't even utilize well we have far too much

376
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:17,520
soul and black hearts or neck hearts, it's not a bad item but it's not what I'm looking for I

377
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:27,280
really prefer conjoined right now, I mean I mean it's all right it's not terrible but it's not

378
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,920
quite what we're looking for, the d20, if only we were in greed mode I

379
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,040
I don't care that was very unfortunate that we didn't get a conjoined for that

380
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,600
and we cannot enter the battle dome because we're not 1 hp sometimes it will open up under

381
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,360
other circumstances but that was very unlucky and that we didn't really get I should have taken that

382
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:01,600
and was it not the cloak wheel now we have such high economy it's definitely worth it to go to

383
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,960
this judgment he's not a beggar he's a judgment right so bombs are a two tile radius so one tile

384
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,200
two tiles does that make sense there we go and then we're just gonna jam ourselves in the corner

385
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,640
and then this judge

386
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,520
two coin judgment streamer luck two coin judgment is insane

387
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,840
two coin judgment gash galley okay I don't like him because he sprints halfway across the map

388
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,160
that is insane streamer luck two coin judgment judgment normally asks for a pretty penny off of

389
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,080
you I'm talking around um at least 15 like almost an exchange rate at the shop truly

390
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,760
um that was insane we're just gonna check I think the secret room might be somewhere in here

391
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,280
unfortunately I am very bad at finding obscure secret rooms yeah um we'll just press onwards

392
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:12,080
and maybe it's outside the boss room um but a cheap day on oh well okay whoa that's so good

393
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:19,440
as well come here please thank you now um do you notice how the water almost looks like an arrow

394
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:27,520
pointed to here you know what I'm not gonna speak again for the evening um thank you for listening

395
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,600
to me it's been fantastic uh I was going to say the game likes to hint where the secret room is to

396
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:40,240
you normally it can be there so yeah unfortunately our super secret room is elsewhere please I am

397
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,000
embarrassed do not acknowledge that now we're gonna keep the joker card on us in case of failure

398
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,160
because this will take us to the angel no matter what okay we've got bumbo the poor lad just wants

399
00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:00,000
a bit of cash honestly um bumbo has a secret ah gammie please I'm doing so terrible please gammie

400
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,400
um bumbo has a secret if he picks up I think seven to nine coins he will actually spot I am

401
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:13,840
just not dodging anything at all thank goodness we have the wafer so we did fail but we have conjoined

402
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,560
so conjoined means our damage goes down but what do you notice

403
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:28,160
shot superiority gained oh yeah baby now we're gonna use the joker card to get us to our angel deal

404
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,120
and it's absolute caca thanks for the waste of time mate uh see this is the problem that I have

405
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:43,120
with Isaac you have angel and devil deals that don't give you anything so this is an example of

406
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,080
you should have gone the devil and you shouldn't have wasted your joker card but we're gonna go back

407
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,640
and pick up our little black room here because it's very op thank you thank you oh wait I am going

408
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,480
to use the black room on the d20 and we will hopefully get some sort of stat upgrade that is

409
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:09,360
useful and not to range because we already have 10 range is that tears right okay we got tears right

410
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,880
up I'll take it tears right up we have quite efficient now I cannot guess where the secret room

411
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,640
is I already popped the bomb there I'm sorry I'm just looking at the map for a possibility but

412
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,200
unfortunately these kind of the bigger the map gets the weaker my guesses are did we do this

413
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,160
am I being done I've already done the shop look I'm in no rush before and it's like

414
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,520
eh you're taking so long to play the game relax chase chase we're just trying to enjoy ourselves

415
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,560
I think it's right above you possibly all right we're gonna buy this car because we might as well

416
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,240
right we've got the full card I'm gonna keep um I never played this game but I'm impressed with

417
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,920
the amount of detail oh it's a very good game I thought here right we've only got three bombs so

418
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:06,160
this is it one or done nah all right we're out we're already we're out of 5000 um but yes we

419
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,880
if we pick up one more book we also get bookworm which means we'll spam even more shots

420
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,400
for the price of no passive really um but we're just gonna go next I don't see any tinted rock in

421
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,960
this room sometimes a boss fight has I don't know if it has a higher chance of a tinted rock

422
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:31,200
but I seem to personally have a bias eh straight up fire rate yes sorry did I say the wrong thing

423
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,320
fire rate yeah my tears come out faster so this is a different kind of battle dome room

424
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:45,120
um we could full card it if we want however if we do this we get more uh active item

425
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,960
entering a new floor that's it's not bad but because we have such high economy

426
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,480
eh see we've just charged our active bar there and these enemies aren't oh my gosh why do I have

427
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,920
such terrible damage I know I just took conjure at conjure conjoined as well which doesn't make

428
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,600
this any easier oh I freaking hate these guys so much you can only hit them on the back of their head

429
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,360
gammy why don't you come out like when I'm not perishing how about you come out like

430
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:24,640
right now gammy and just deal with them please I'm so bad you can get I can't remember what the

431
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,320
trinkets called it gives you a one in five chance of spawning a bird pair kill in the room uh I

432
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:37,040
absolutely adore it whoa that was good that shatter right we're doing it we're doing it so for this

433
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,360
room that's a yuck heart we actually don't want that it's worth not a full heart if that makes sense

434
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,120
it's worth half a heart it does let you have a blue fly though that goes after enemies but it's not for

435
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:58,000
me that's this niche for my um so that those two fires might indicate the secret room is also there

436
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,320
the game likes to do double fires a lot can you stop pooping please um the game loves to do

437
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,320
double fires like absolutely adores it I can't stop it normally again it's another indication

438
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:19,200
that the secret room might be there no I don't I don't know if we're doing the curse oh okay so that

439
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:26,800
was another hint no it wasn't I just suck at this game you know what you know what game you embarrass

440
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,080
me anymore I'm taking it up with a pope or something are you drunk right we're not going in those rooms

441
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,880
anymore we're actually not going in the cursed room anymore we've had absolutely nothing from it

442
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,800
I've been they're making a mockery out of me they're making a mockery out of me right sorry any pop

443
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:52,720
satanic bible um so we actually now have no angel deal chance what the heck am I mistaken

444
00:51:53,120 --> 00:52:00,160
because I pulled a joker card wait if I completely messed up this run I mean honestly we can go to

445
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:07,440
the devil because of how much HP and the wafer in combination so honestly I'm not that mad I'm not mad

446
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:14,880
I promise I'm not mad bro I'm not absolutely raging at the fact that uh we've just lost angel deals

447
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,840
for some reason it must have been because I pulled the joker card um but this is the game that I

448
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:25,280
learned tarot cards in I know we've been playing balutro recently or balutro as I call it um

449
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,880
normally the wee secret room does spawn in this room in between these guys but I wasn't paying

450
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,200
attention to where they spawned the enemies will also give you a hint if they're here but fuck it we'll

451
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:45,040
try it I give it wait satanic bible raise took away my angel deal

452
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:55,920
it's not fair give it back oh I hate these guys oh my god they like extend their neck

453
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,960
if you get too close to you oh come on give me come on give me bend and spoon come on give me bend

454
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,600
yeah boss oh for goodness sake right okay well I've kind of gone on a bit of a side quest

455
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:13,280
that was useless poster oh my god please I'm not even hitting anything these guys in the middle

456
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:20,560
are just getting a free wall upon me honestly right again we're now full health actually thanks to

457
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,000
the satanic bible right there we go boom and we got a key which is good uh unfortunately yeah as

458
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,240
the game gets larger and larger map wise I find it much so harder to find the secret rooms unless

459
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,640
we can get blue treasure map in the shop potentially potentially blue treasure map allows you to see

460
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,920
the secret and super secret room it does not reveal the ultra secret room but again we need red

461
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,800
key to access that which we did pass on and I'm not familiar if there's any I see please um

462
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,560
they're not too wow we've completely changed we don't have so many keys but hardly any bombs

463
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,960
whoa scary guy we're just gonna spray them down in the middle

464
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,560
how weak how weak is our attack holy crap we need like a damage anything please again we have

465
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,080
another heart this is a unique room I don't recall ever being in it you can play this game for hours

466
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,840
upon hours and enter a room layout you've never seen before in your life super secret rooms are

467
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:28,400
usually close to the boss and connected to only one room okay they're not like this room

468
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:38,480
okay okay uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh whoa it dropped a uh chest uh are these called globes or something

469
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,720
whoa we have a guppy it's very unlikely we're gonna get guppy

470
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,400
I don't hate infestation

471
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,680
I feel like we can get something better though

472
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,040
I hate it wait no I hate it stop giving me active I um

473
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,360
huh right

474
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:18,400
the reason I'm taking this is because it can phd it turns all bad pills to good

475
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,800
and it can put your stats up I get yet instantly we've been gratified by our choice our speed is

476
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:32,800
now up we can also take pills which is fantastic um I ran away from this pill what we got 48 hour

477
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,880
energy which is not quite what we're looking for but that's okay but like again if there's

478
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
no pills in the shop we can utilize

479
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:52,560
okay so okay right get them gammy get them gammy that's right so if you're incredibly unlucky

480
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,800
and you have a lot of money on hand your chance of getting super greeds goes up it's exponentially

481
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:05,200
and we have been very unlucky to now miss out on two freaking shops but we did get an item pedestal

482
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,360
I'm not gonna pick it up just yet in case there's some trickery you picked it up and dropped it again

483
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:17,200
did I actually oh my god what are you lunch no what are you the livers what are you

484
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:23,680
yera which duplicates whatever goodness I mean

485
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:33,440
that's terrible yeah I have to admit this is probably the most frustrating mechanic

486
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,960
I am playing normal mode the odds of us getting greed actually shouldn't be that high but

487
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,800
if you play hardcore mode for unlocks you without fail yera

488
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,200
I'm gonna hold on to yera yera duplicates so if we find something like a a pill maybe the um

489
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:04,640
does is good so we are full money there's a room I didn't explore off to the side here my bed oh well

490
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,240
I shouldn't have discovered it I take it all back but anyway we can take pills now and when we do

491
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:23,840
blood donation machines we get even more money for it unfortunately we are having just terrible

492
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:34,560
luck trying to get what we need um we don't need any of that the lean bags secret room is left of

493
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:43,760
the treasure room do you solemnly swear wifling that is your final decision left of the treasure room

494
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,400
okay if this if this secret room is not here you're being timed out

495
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,280
whoa the bomb follow does ah we just wasted a bomb doing that

496
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,000
no one move it okay you're not being timed out congrats unfortunately we are full

497
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,160
we are very full of coins and we have nowhere to spend it and we destroyed the donation machine

498
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,600
and we don't have an arcade machine uh arcade level I think arcade spawns every odd even four

499
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,080
if you have five coins or more something like that um

500
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,320
unfortunately we don't have enough bombs to try and find the super secret room

501
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,360
what we got looky a bit of looky oh yeah a bit of looky

502
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:42,240
yeah you like that yeah unfortunately he's a bam and uh yeah I'm gammie you know I meant that

503
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,120
that was actually a tactical move to unlock gammie so gammie does all the work for us it was a

504
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,400
tactical move it was a tactical move stop it stop calling me a new bin Isaac look I play it for fun

505
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,560
okay too many sweats and Isaac too many sweats and Isaac this is what I just played for fun see gammie

506
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:04,160
does all the work if there is ever a game where it was all about familiars I'll be in the development

507
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,800
team because I like when the familiars do the work and I get to lay back and just enjoy the game

508
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,920
I get to enjoy the music the aesthetics I get to enjoy the game design like come on come on go gammie go

509
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,720
oh we get flay absolutely we are gonna take that and we're gonna pop satanic bible and we're

510
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:30,560
gonna see what satan has to offer us we might actually get guppy the odds of getting guppy are

511
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:39,600
like so rare we might actually do it holey moley well now that we have flight we're gonna take a

512
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:47,440
little uh detour so when you have flight uh floor spikes can't stop you um I'm gonna grab that heart

513
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,280
um but uh obviously you're not limited to the floor um crazy concept of the flight I know um I

514
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:02,000
know I should probably take up through his head but uh due to the fact that satanic bible will help

515
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,680
me out with health I oh but you have wafer you have wafer I know I know but I suck you can see I

516
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,120
suck and to be honest we're actually not doing I should have taken the full card not that we're

517
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:22,800
gonna be able so are you gonna point and do in this room because yeah I was gonna say if it's money

518
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:29,120
then what's the point all right let's go oh flight is just so easy oh wait no there's gonna be a

519
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:35,280
full card in this floor anyway um if I wanted to use it but it's not like we can get boss rush

520
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:41,440
it's been an hour and we've not even perished mother dearest the most basic mother dearest

521
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,760
mom's heart is it mom's heart no mom's heart it's the next one it's just man

522
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,960
oh I should stop picking up coins oh the spider's coming at you no I'm hiding get away from me

523
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,360
go away I'll let go away I'll let my familiars deal with you go away no I'm not taking any

524
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:07,040
damage because you guys are ganging up on me so you notice that um black one over there how his

525
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,920
pathing's given up because he's like I can't reach you it's actually quite humorous to do that in

526
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:20,080
the game I like it um the game's just like I cannot reach you I give up um the game also has a soft

527
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,960
lock feature um if you're in a room for too long uh the game will actually unlock it itself because

528
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,680
it's like hold on a minute something isn't right you should be out of this room by now basically

529
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:42,800
uh a treasure room for free sure sure okay mother's bra no we'll pass but thank you for

530
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:50,800
the kind offer though uh an orbital no we don't really let enemies get that close to us a coin no

531
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:57,840
no not on health either oh we're gonna say we no that's an act

532
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:10,720
poggers poggers wait triple oh wait we okay we're gonna we're going up in damage but hold on let me

533
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,200
cook hold on hold on let's see the damage let's see what happens whoo okay hold on wait I may have

534
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,440
messed up a little bit but it's fine it's fine I actually don't mind this it's cute it's cute look at

535
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:28,800
it look at it going everywhere we're just oh a Christmas miracle and we get f all of course we

536
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:35,760
get f all right hopefully there's an item down here won the run with that literally now we could get

537
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:43,760
midnight snack I don't want too many red hearts oh wait no the devil's gonna ask for that um

538
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:52,240
automatically charges the first bar yeah if we could get that in greed mode that in the sprinkler

539
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,160
that'd be great yeah that's all I need okay unfortunately the last shops have been yeah this

540
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,480
is the last shop it's been uh rather disappointing I'll just buy stuff because I can really um

541
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:12,000
justice uh justice yeah this is where I learned my tarot cards from justice gives you one of each

542
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,960
pick up basically uh it does have a chance to give you a troll bomb that's on the town side

543
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:25,920
um we are gonna just quickly kablamo these guys um have I used the bible this I'm gonna make sure

544
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:33,360
to get an extra devil item because we are we're starting to not be now we do have flight the

545
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,880
mobility that you get from flight is very important for like dodging enemies like for example this enemy

546
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,840
I can I call me Duke can you come because I'm juking his ankles or something I don't know um

547
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:51,760
maybe the secret room above here nope it's not uh that was why it's good to check rooms

548
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,520
but like see how we're doing so much damage from across the room it's kind of splitting

549
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:04,800
chat it's splitting um like oh fantastic again because of flight we don't have to spend a bomb

550
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:11,840
and we can just see what's in this rubbish rubbish don't waste our time so again we can

551
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,680
kind of hide behind items as well that obscure the enemy shots of us um the let's say the secret

552

567
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:15,360
there's a chance it could be small rock in here now notice this room and now if we don't kill her

568
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:23,920
notice how you see mom's eyes coming through the door holes etc um and she's going Isaac Isaac

569
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:30,480
okay keep that in mind keep in mind before I say what I'm gonna say next after the fight

570
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:46,320
oh I didn't even know you were in here sorry oh we failed the devil deal which is a shame

571
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:54,640
right did you notice how she was looking through the door almost as if she was peeping inside the

572
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:03,200
chest and she finds Isaac and she's trying to desperately get inside we're still on time for

573
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,880
boss rush one you're hilarious two oh my gosh I took me an hour to get to the mum fight the most

574
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:16,800
basic level six mum fight um but yes uh when I talk about my uh when I do the review on this game

575
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:22,480
which I'm very excited to do um I'm gonna talk about all my little theories because everyone's

576
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,360
like got different theories about it but mine's like the reason why everything's rectangular is

577
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:34,800
because it's you in the chest but um you heard your mum go Isaac we are gonna go down and we're

578
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:41,520
picking up even more damage um the satanic bible doesn't work on that floor but that's fine

579
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:48,960
no boss rush but maybe hush are you joking me you guys are having a Fibonacci sequence on me because

580
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:58,880
you're you're having me on what was that range okay okay right I'm just gonna pop satanic bible

581
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:06,000
now it doesn't really matter if we take damage because um range you'll notice the tears aren't

582
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,160
actually hitting we're just having to guess the path of the tears it's not when you have this

583
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,920
I've completely forgotten the name of that item when you have it you're not really actually aiming

584
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,680
to hit directly with the tear you're even in front of them now our luck is gone up which means our

585
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:33,520
drop rate on items uh is gone up which is nice and cool do appreciate um but we're just gonna

586
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:41,200
walk around have a little uh have a peek into all the rooms we're not really we are not in

587
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,760
trouble let's just say we're not in trouble I feel confident about this run I was a bit nervous

588
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:53,200
uh he hemo claria hold on hold on hold on wait hold on need to stop swallowing what are you

589
01:08:53,200 --> 01:09:03,120
swallowing stop it someone is swallowing a hemo lacrea okay that's it hemo lacrea yeah you have

590
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:11,600
to aim a bit funny we're hemo lacrea sorry let's do me a hold second now because what right if this

591
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:21,920
isn't a guppy item you're not forgiving game close enough close enough uh what are you spawns a devil

592
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,400
are you joking come on that's rubbish right we're gonna do it

593
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,480
I was a terrible idea

594
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:45,520
come on chaos card I mean I'll take it oh he gave us two hearts what the heck sure

595
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,120
and what tablet have you given us luck up

596
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:00,640
tears and damage and two black hearts and leviathan transformation right we're gonna pick this up

597
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,440
hold on wait I'm gonna drop it real quick so I can read out what it does we've just picked up the

598
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,520
chaos card using the card throws it in the direction Isaac is moving instantly kill any

599
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,600
enemy except delirium and beasts so we can pretty much just instantly do this fight if we so desire

600
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,800
um it's very good I'm gonna pick up the red hearts but we're not gonna go all the way back

601
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:30,800
and we we got the pact which is fantastic absolutely fantastic is this a chance for the

602
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:40,960
hidden room hey let's go whoa we got binge here temporarily two permanent startups depending

603
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,280

611
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,240
this run is far too good to be mucking about with that if the run was bad and we were like struggling

612
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,640

Wow, we are not doing mega Satan to known surprise

716
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:03,840
I'm gonna go pick up the hearts. I completely forgot it did that. I

717
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
Knew it was bad

718
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,960
But I completely forgot I did that

719
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,800
To say I'm upset as a wee bit of an understatement

720
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:24,960
Okay, maybe we are in trouble no mega Satan oh we do have the chaos card for me no cuz mega has two phases

721
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,680
so we can't

722
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,600
Make it has two feet. I think we're gonna have to use it on the lamp. I don't I don't think we're getting out here alive

723
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Right, I will drop the monkey paw

724
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,600
Pick up the chaos card though

725
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,640
Oh, we have gupsters. Okay, we have guppy here bowl

726
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,840
I

727
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,080
Percent chance for a rift. I'll take that and then we'll do health here

728
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,520
Were you a backstabber hitting an enemy in the back? Yeah?

729
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,040
Oh

01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,120

Even though even though I didn't take damage get me you do the rest this is

733
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,640
Democracy manifest

734
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,400
Okay, okay, okay, that was lucky. Okay, that's a mimic chest and we're not interested

735
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,640
Notice all the flies that's because we have guppies transformation. Wow that actually saved us I

736
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Worried

737
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,080
We just need we just gonna take the snack

738
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,560
We got guppy up by what cost honestly honestly though

739
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,720
How could I be so foolish

740
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I'm gonna take the foot taking a damage

741
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,320
chance

742
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:15,600
I might actually take that on the basis of if gammy gets summoned out and he's our last lifeline

743
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,480
Are she sorry

744
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,320
Grants a random zodiac. Fuck it. What is it? What we getting? I

Oh, yeah, I'm always pop the babel. Sorry

747
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,440
We are sorry, I am having a try hard so much right now

Right, what's that double shot wait, did that remove course I know

749
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,920
Just make things worse for myself I it's very possible

01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:05,480
Don't charge don't charge go little flies go go guppy flies go. Oh that this orbital actually take the heat off of us

751
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:14,360
I'm an idiot. It's not the one. I thought it was it was a freaking fly. I thought it was the fly that goes around the wall

752
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,360
I am a dumb dumb

753
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:23,920
Tears shoot slowing effect. I mean no, it's too late for any of these transformations

754
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:32,000
It's too late guppy can carry you through the lamp save chaos for mega. Yeah, I

755
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,080
Will try mega if we lose we lose at least we like literally had to which one though

756
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,340
Contact them makes Isaac Isaac immune to damage and deals

757
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,080
Nah, that's rubbish

758
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,100
So I owe you. Well, thank goodness. There wasn't an enemy in there. I wasn't charged up

759
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,480
Okay, and we're gonna go do the lamb. I have no idea. Oh, I keep forgetting

760
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,480
Okay, oh

01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,780
I'll take it. I'll take it. We're where was it? Oh, it's below a

762
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,760
Fart bean a little fart bean. Okay, we'll do a health. No, actually

763
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,640
We'll do the fart bean because it's funny and I like it, okay

764
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:25,180
If I just do that, it's just gonna okay. Okay. I see you see I don't really want to take

765
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:30,220
Right, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do lamb and then we're gonna go back to mega Satan

766
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:41,100
No damage no damage, okay, the rift is helping us out insanely right now because it's sucking him

767
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,220
Okay, we're gonna go do mega Satan

768
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:52,260
We're actually gonna go do mega Satan with freaking cursed I I am going to go into the other rooms

769
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:56,660
I didn't realize how much of a speed down we had. Wow. How did I only just notice that?

770
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,180
We're gonna hopefully get something

771
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:05,820
Sure, why not? Let's get you root emick to you. I really can't take much more health. We are so slow. Oh

772
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:11,780
Wait, there's a there is a a pill in here. Is it a speed pill? That would be great. Not gonna lie

773
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:14,740
What are you?

774
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,740
No, I

775
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:24,700
Do we can someone look up do we need face to Satan with chaos card mega Satan face to magazine

776
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:30,380
Oh, does more health slow you down? Yes, we have what's called binge eater and and every time we pick up a health

777
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:33,140
We do get damage, etc. Sadly though

778
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:39,780
Yeah, I can't see all right, sorry, I can't see what's going for me. That scared me

779
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,540
I

780
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,740
Probably better to kill

781
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:50,340
Phase one with chaos at least yes two phases. Okay, what and then just don't mess up five heads

782
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:58,020
Just don't mess up chaos car chaos card only kills one phase. I thought that

783
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,980
Thought that

784
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:08,460
Yes to be probably better to kill phase one because it's the longest phase okay

785
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,140
Can we do it?

786
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,140
Can we do it?

787
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,140
No pressure. I

788
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,940
Mean the good news is you can try phase one a billion times each failure only costs half of her

789
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,740
Take the bad chest and use the book

790
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,340
I

791
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:44,060
Don't it's not gonna have an item only. Oh, it does have an item in it another charged attack. I'll pass right fuck it

792
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,060
We'll take this

793
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,340
No, let's go

794
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:54,100
Your flies will melt through phase one if you get hit on phase two you'll tell you

795
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:02,340
Let's try it come on what you got your fucking bam come on

796
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,940
Come on

797
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:11,020
Okay, we've got rift which will suck a lot of attack away, but we must be careful

798
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,380
We must be careful

799
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:19,580
We must be careful. I'm sweating. I'm sweating. Oh my god

800
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:25,020
We have we have no way we have the zodiac over out. We're out take your time

801
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,700
That was so dangerous, I'm not laughing

802
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:38,980
Oh, it hit me cuz I touched it. I didn't see what touched me

803
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,700
I don't know

804
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,340
Did Satan touch my butthole? I didn't

805
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,580
Come on mega Satan we can do it

Where did the card go? How is it there? I?

828
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,340
Wasn't on that side of the map

829
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:45,180
How is it there? How is it there? I wasn't on that side of the map. I

830
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:53,180
Wasn't even there am I going crazy help help help actually have to do the Satan fight with cursae I

831
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,420
Wasn't on that side of the map though

832
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,820
Please guppy's flies do it please

833
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,380

I got me baby boy. Come on guppy. Oh

836
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,020
We did it delirium

837
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:17,300
Delirium no, but we did it

838
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,700
The rift sucked my card. Oh

839
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,820
We did it yatta. Oh

840
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,860
For goodness gravy

841
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:32,540
Goodness gravy cursed I an exchange of guppy

842
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,860
Oh

843
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:40,940
Through Isaac he sees himself as a bad boy, but he's not a bad boy. We did it first try that was crazy

844
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,700
I kept my card got sucked out of my hand

845
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:48,220
It literally was like when something gets blown in the wind that you're hold on holding I

846
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:53,220
Can't believe we did that. I was ready to go to delirium for the hell of it. Oh

847
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,100
This is such a creepy credit

848
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,860
Oh

849
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:12,340
It's such a creepy credit, but oh my god, how did we do that?

850
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:17,180
Flex missed the chaos card to prove that you didn't need it

851
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:23,380
Honestly that run could not have gone any better Satanic Bible. I have to admit is fantastic

852
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:30,660
You get unlimited health from it statistically when you find energies around the map you get unlimited health

853
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:35,820
You get extra devil deal items on top of what you're doing. Anyway, I'm

854
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:40,180
Satan and shambles literally Ed McMillan. I hope it's the next time

855
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:45,020
And Ed McMuffin is currently working on a game called me eugenics

856
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:50,100
Which I'm very excited for its release. Sadly. There was a bit of delay in development

857
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:57,420
And due to a few issues and him adding on extra things and I will say that I've played Isaac

858
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:03,860
I definitely feel and I have got my money's worth and

859
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:10,020
From it yellow baby, wait, I'm not I actually unlocked something there

860
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,020
Wait, did I not do mega Satan on?

861
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:22,220
Who was it who's a plane on Eden? I didn't do mega. Wait, where the fuck is Eden Eden? There you are. Oh

862
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,620
Wow, I never actually had the thing

863
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:30,220
Is it over? Um, no, we're gonna do one very cheeky

864
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,940
greed mode with

865
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:37,020
Lilith and then yeah, we did it. We won though

866
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:45,060
I've faith Isaac and super meat boy. We're both incredible. Yes, I believe you unlocked a court, baby

867
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:51,220
Yeah, I can't believe we did that right. We're gonna do a little greed mode. I'm just gonna show you greed mode

868
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:57,780
It's super simple to get the grass Bob. A lot of people don't seem to enjoy it. I for one enjoy it

869
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:04,140
So I've got my little sookie bus, but look I have no eyeballs, so I can't cry if you didn't em know

870
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:12,780
The attack in these games are about crying because poor Isaac is crying himself. Um, so this is a room

871
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:19,540
It is a rectangular long rectangle. Um, they are going to be 10 phases

872
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:24,100
You might notice that there that little 10 there that is saying what phase we're on

873
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:28,900
There will be 10 fights in this room back to back to back to back

874
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:34,740
There is a timer to tell you in the next comment. There's a locked door. There's an open room

875
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:38,660
And we're going to get a range upgrade and a heart. We're going to hope

876
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:45,300
Unfortunately, we did not get a soul or a necro heart. That's okay. 169 tokens exactly

877
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:52,660
Now curious deep pockets, we're not probably gonna get anything like that. Oh anonymous

878
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,100
Thank you so much for the tip. I'm glad you

879
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:59,940
Enjoyed my victory royale literally flexing on them

880
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:03,060
So in greed mode your only

881
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:10,420
Opportunity to make money is via fights and that is the only way you can upgrade your stuff. Okay

882
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:13,300
so

883
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:18,020
Um, but there's a few hidden a few hidden differences. Okay a few hidden differences

884
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,980
um, we can

885
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:23,060
Bomb these

886
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,220
Keepers here. These are passed away keepers

887
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:33,220
Um, and we actually have a higher chance of getting things like keepers head for example or steam sail for example

888
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,060
They have a high chance of dropping a cheeky quarter

889
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:39,780
No, not quarter five cents

890
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,180
um

891
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:47,300
But yes, so we want to try and get a key which is five bucks to get into our room now

892
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:51,860
Because we are lileth. We don't really want an active item at all. We like

893
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,580
Look now we have two we have double the firepower because of that move

894
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:03,860
So, uh, this can get out of hand very quickly. Thankfully lileth is the easiest to play

895
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,620
In greed mode. I just kind of want to show you off. But as you see there's a timer

896
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,860
um

897
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:15,620
Those we enemies are doing their thing again. We are getting a active every time new enemies come in

898
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,420
We're getting an active so now we have three firing power

899
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:26,420
Um, we definitely want to clear enemies as fast as they come in because once you do not want overwhelmed on the map

900
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:32,740
As soon as you get overwhelmed that's when your health takes a tank and it is very hard to try and

901
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,220
Like it's expensive to try and roll for a soul heart for example

902
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:43,780
Again, we now have four firing power. Please don't touch me. Please. Oh really don't want that really don't want that

903
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,740
um

904
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:52,420
Really don't want that but hey, oh it happened. We're gonna stay in we're gonna do what's called the boss fight

905
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,380
Um, that was very unlucky though very unlucky. Um

906
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:02,180
So these flies can shoot out. Sorry my fingers getting sore

907
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:07,700
I actually should take a picture of my controller to show you how intensely I play Isaac

908
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,340
So we have now completed

909
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:16,020
Um phase eight. So there's like an optional kind of you know boss fight if you will

910
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:20,340
Now the game. Oh, I shouldn't have popped that actually. That was very silly

911
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:27,060
Because we needed it for the next floor, but that's on me making mistakes and it's okay. You're allowed to make mistakes in the game

912
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,620
What is the enemy

913
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,700
Oh, it's you guys you stinkers

914
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:38,900
But yes, um, as you can see why it's easy on Lilith is you just

915
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:45,700
Continually get more and more damage and as you get any sort of upgrade you get rewarded for it. Okay

916
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:51,460
So Lilith is all about minions. Yeah, she is my favorite for greed mode because of

917
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:57,940
The familiar help. I love games that have familiar help. So that purple guy is called lust

918
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:03,460
I think if i'm remembering correctly, he will try to touch you. You need to try and juke him

919
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,540
Yeah, you need to get rid of him quickly

920
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:07,380
um

921
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:12,900
But the good thing with uh, we're actually gonna try and get rid of the baby first because he runs around erratically

922
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,580
Um, which is not good for us. Unfortunately. We have base speed

923
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,660
I can't see the enemy. Okay, we're fine

924
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,260
Now as much as I actually want to go for a devil deal

925
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,620
I'm not interested in greed mode in a devil deal. Okay

926
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:34,660
So unfortunately, we got absolutely nothing in here which sucks

927
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,740
But hey, so we're gonna get a key

928
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:41,460
And we're gonna see if we can get a bomb. Unfortunately, we don't have a bomb in this role

929
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:44,020
So we are gonna get a key and see what's in our active room

930
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,060
Our active room the purple guy

931
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:52,900
Uh, we've actually got spawns a random pickup. So that's not bad at all

932
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:58,500
And we're getting a lot of coins from the fires not bad at all indeed

933
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:06,500
Um, I'm going to avoid the curse room because we do not have the goods now. I could do a tier rates up here

934
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,540
It does seem a shame to miss out on it

935
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,580
But i'm kind of needing a bomb for next round

936
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,020
Oh

937
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,140
Decisions decisions. This is the problem with greed mode

938
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:29,780
All right. I'm against my my judgment. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna hope for a bomb

939
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,740
Sadly no bomb

940
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:37,140
Uh, I'm going to elect to keep my money for the next floor

941
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:43,220
Um coat hanger pretty good. Yes. So now look how fast it is. Look at him go up here up here up here up here

942
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,220
Yeah

943
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:52,260
Yes, I always wait for a round with discounted item and try and do that. Yes. That is a very viable tactic

944
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:56,260
Uh, sure

945
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,820
Sure, why we don't even have eyes

946
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:04,740
But sure now we can buy a key to instantly get access to that room to see what's going on

947
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,700
Interesting another tears up

948
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:16,180
Now we're gonna keep

949
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,940
Hold on we're gonna use this key

950
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,580
We're gonna buy two keys

951
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:27,220
Okay, let me cook. Let me cook

952
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:32,740
We're gonna unlock one of these to get a bomb because we need it for the angel fight. We're gonna do

953
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,420
Uh, we're gonna bomb him

954
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:38,820
Wow

955
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,860
Wow

956
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:44,980
Normally they almost always drop something we're gonna see what's in here

957
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:48,500
I've got Bob's head using the iron and firing it throwing the head explodes where it lands

958
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:56,980
Uh, we're gonna try and find the the secret. Oh no, I can't be in here. I can't be in here rubbish rubbish

959
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,100
Well, we're just gonna eat it out of the wall. I guess

960
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:02,820
I

961
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,180
No, there you go

962
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:09,380
Didn't get it didn't get it. Where'd the angel deal chance go? It only comes up after the boss fight

963
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:13,060
So we're guaranteed an angel wait. I'm Lilith. Hold on

964
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:18,100
Hold on a minute. I might not be guaranteed it like a dumbass. I'm Lilith. I'm evil

965
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,380
I may have messed up slightly. I may have done a slight miscalculation

966
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:27,140
Is it Lilith? Because I know Bethany gives you a higher angel

967
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,860
So I

968
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,500
Unfortunately used up the last

969
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:38,180
Thing which I shouldn't have done. So we're actually down a little guy. Of course we have hosts

970
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:46,340
Hosts can easily overrun your game easily. So we really want rid of them like ASAP. That's really bad for

971
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,820
Whoa

972
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:52,340
You couldn't have done that before we spent our monies

973
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,420
Jeez, we got a golden key. That's such a shame

974
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:01,220
At least we can get two bombs. Oh my god, our pickup is going wild

975
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:04,260
Sorry, sorry. I'm getting too distracted

976
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,020
Sorry

977
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:08,020
What's going on down here?

978
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,620
Definitely don't want them coming near us because we don't want any damage

979
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,140
Oh my god. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

980
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:20,980
That's what I'm saying. You can get overwhelmed just like that. Whoa, wait our bag is multiplying

981
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,020
I just noticed that like an idiot our bag is multiplying. What the heck?

982
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:31,300
I didn't know the the pickup bag's multiplied. I was like, why are we getting so much good stuff?

983
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,020
Whoa

984
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:36,020
That's hilarious

985
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:40,180
That is fun

986
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,580
That oh dear

987
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:49,780
Oh dear, we're now risky territory because if we go for the next ball. Oh, no. Oh, no

988
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:54,420
Putta madre. Oh, it's widow

989
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,540
What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you not coming over? Do you not jump?

990
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,060
Whoa, what's going on?

991
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,460
Creamy little spider you are aren't you?

992
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,260
Spider girl confirmed for gin too

993
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,140
absolutely

994
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,780
No, um

995
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:18,900
Okay, we are playing it very risky right now, but I do not want to leave the room

996
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:25,220
So we're gonna we're gonna send it as the as the young one where the heck is the enemy

997
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:31,540
It's worms. It's wiggly worms and I completely missed all the damage against them

998
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:35,060
We got bombs though

999
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,140
Okay

1000
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,740
We're really playing at risk

1001
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,740
Okay

1002
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,580
We're gonna bomb this angel. I don't think we can actually bomb it

1003
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:56,340
We've not got enough health. We actually can't bomb the angel to increase our angel deal

1004
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:59,940
It's okay

1005
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:04,020
A worm confirmed for gen two actually for real for real though

1006
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:09,700
A little wiggly worm that comes out of the ground and she has an obsession with your prostate

1007
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:13,540
She just wants to poke it. She's like, I just want to poke it

1008
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:18,820
Well, do it no ball. I I certainly do not have any balls. I assure you

1009
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:22,740
I shite bag if you didn't I actually I'm a shite bag

1010
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,500
right

1011
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,860
Now we have a golden key so we can take these bombs for free

1012
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:33,220
And we got penny back. We need to be very careful in between those spikes

1013
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:34,500
now

1014
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,180
Because we have treasure box conjoined is just

1015
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:40,180
insane

1016
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:44,420
The insanity of conjoined goes crazy. So I am going to buy this

1017
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:50,340
Because it gets out of hand so quickly. Oh my god. They look like little diamond

1018
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,780
Uh little diamond thingies

1019
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,900
um

1020
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:02,580
As much as getting a bone heart would be all right for going in and out the curse room

1021
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,980
We actually don't have the money

1022
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:07,620
No, we don't I mean we could

1023
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,100
Now they have a higher payout rate

1024
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,900
I mean we got five bombs for it. Sheesh

1025
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:24,900
I'll take it. Uh, right as for where this hidden room is it's either in the curse room or it's right here

1026
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,380
Yeah, the odds of it being here is pretty high

1027
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:36,900
Decrease spawn rate of all hearts to 20 percent all black all hearts turn into black hearts

1028
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:41,460
Increase the drop chance the keys. I even do anything. I think we'll just do lunch

1029
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:48,980
I doubt I don't think that does anything in greed mode. Uh greed mode does negate a lot of different things. Um

1030
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:56,420
But that's not here not there. Are all the beggars refillings. I'm seeing them really like in mummy

1031
01:48:56,740 --> 01:49:00,580
I know they've been so kind in greed mode. The rate goes up exponentially now

1032
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:04,420
This is just a small thing you can do but you can actually bomb these

1033
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:10,980
It will reroll but you can also get money back. So we've actually just been given the chance for damage

1034
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,820
And we might spawn a Yara rune

1035
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:21,220
No, this sprinkler this sprinkler is so good

1036
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:28,660
Oh wait, but we're lily so we don't need the sprinkler. It's fine. Right. We have a shard rune

1037
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:35,620
We are going to use it on a gemmed tailstone for the chance to do uh

1038
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:39,140
What the fuck did that do

1039
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:44,340
What did that do? Oh, it made something cheaper in the shop. Oh, I should have saved it for the next floor

1040
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:49,220
I was hoping we were going to get a crawl space and it was going to have an item inside for us, but it's

1041
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:54,660
Okay, right. We have no money, but we have bombs and we have two

1042
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,780
Familiar well, we technically only have one for conjoined

1043
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,980
It would affect the drops of your mystery bag

1044
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:05,460
Okay, so we now have oh, no

1045
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:13,540
Oh, it hurts

1046
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,940
I

1047
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,820
Mean dumb dumb

1048
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,180
I forgot we had pain

1049
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:31,940
Pain damage multiplier full health pain

1050
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,580
Too measly pain

1051
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,380
Now we are actually gonna be

1052
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:43,700
It forced a bomb these to try and get a freaking hit

1053
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,340
And I bet you if I had money it wouldn't be that

1054
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,060
Exactly. Ah, that's right

1055
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,300
Unfortunately, we are kind of getting a bit uh needing

1056
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:04,340
A few things now. I'm going to hope my multiplied drops are going to do something

1057
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:09,300
Okay spawns a devil burger. Um

1058
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,940
One more for the gentleman in the back

1059
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:20,260
And nothing. Wow, we we're having it rough out here. Let's hope there's something of

1060
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:22,260
Um

1061
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,900
We now

1062
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:41,300
Do not have to aim. I repeat for those of you who do not know what homing spoon is. We do not have to aim

1063
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:43,460
Let's

1064
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,260
Go

1065
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:50,020
We just need to do a rooty mick tootie in any direction talk about streamer luck

1066
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:57,540
We do not need to aim the game will do it all for us. Oh, I love being a strummer

1067
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:02,420
I just took health damage. Why is there a blinking light bulb? What is that?

1068
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:08,580
What whoa, that's that's a lot of enemies. You're putting my money everywhere

1069
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:17,060
Oh my god, we got a dame as well, which is 10 cents. Are we going eternal heart? Oh, I don't I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet

1070
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:21,460
Holy moly. Look at all of this goodness

1071
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,500
Holy moly

1072
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:28,180
I'm gonna mow this one down because they're not very nice to go against

1073
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,380
And then again

1074
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,740
Here we go

1075
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:40,100
Whoa, we're getting like special attacks as well now. They do throw bombs. He does throw bombs. So don't don't be too

1076
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:46,020
Okay, one more one more don't take any oh he's it's a poop

1077
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,300
He's a wee poopy thing

1078
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:53,300
I don't know what's going on down there. It's chaos, but we're we're spraying and praying boys

1079
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:58,980
Okay, we're spraying and praying. Okay. We've got a devil deal and we have no health to take it

1080
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:02,580
So we are not taking it. We're gonna take the eternal heart, which is fantastic

1081
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,340
We're gonna explore and see if there's anything in the room below

1082
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:10,180
Other than enemies got a lot of enemies. So we don't even have to aim

1083
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:15,060
Um, we could bomba like this

1084
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,980
Are you joking me?

1085
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:29,140
Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, that one's fucking cute. All right, what's going on in here?

1086
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:37,540
Uh, right, we have a card spawns dev. Well, I can't even utilize your bro

1087
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:40,500
Again, these items are

1088
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:45,060
Rubbage a chest and a chest class the guys like right fuck it

1089
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:59,220

01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:03,540
App absolutely freaking pranked. I like come on

1091
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:07,060
Come on right

1092
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:13,620
Okay, we now have mother transformation. So we now have mom's homing knife. Wait, how does that even work?

1093
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,660
It's gonna like home to them when they come to me

1094
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,260
Now we are gonna try for secret room here

1095
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,820
Didn't get it, but that's okay

1096
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:26,260
Did get three coins now we can go to the angel

1097
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:30,580
I'm just gonna check I picked up the items in the treasure rooms because I forget to do it a lot

1098
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:35,940
It makes the knife powerful. We got mercy. Oh my god mercy for real for real. Okay, we have mercy

1099
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:42,020
Um, did we get a zero? Maybe immaculate conception is a zero technically

1100
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,180
Uh, right we go next wait, hold on

1101
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:53,300
We can bomb for a potential discounted item

1102
01:54:54,260 --> 01:55:03,060
And get some coins. Oh a money back coins back. Holy crap. I'm so sorry. I stopped talking there and get some coins back

1103
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:07,540
Hold hold it mullet right. We're gonna pick this up because that's damage

1104
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,340
Um, oh god, that's damage again

1105
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:22,260
Some what I know I don't know how us if I go into the angel deal it's gonna charge me 30 for something good though

1106
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:30,020
Am I gonna be raging if right? No, I'm gonna be raging if I pass up on something

1107
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,420
Oh god, the discount's so good though

1108
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,300
Right

1109
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:41,780
Uh range nah, it's fine. Right. We don't need anything. Oh do we need the soul heart?

1110
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:46,180
No, we need 15 bucks for the angel to see what's inside

1111
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:54,340
Wasn't it only 15 it was discounted, but I don't know if it's 30 for the full

1112
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:01,620
Yeah, ah prism actually is fantastic with how much really make tooting and shooting we do

1113
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,100
Um

1114
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,500
Oh like it's long shield the trinity shield

1115
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,180
Oh, no, we just gave her money to the beggar

1116
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:18,180
I

1117
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:22,020
Wasn't paying attention. I was like, oh it's links feel

1118
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:29,220
Uh, I might beat this angel up actually to try and increase my angel

1119
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,860
Oh my gosh, did you see that though?

1120
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:42,260
Okay, sorry, I need to try hard. I really don't want to take any damage because we do not have much for

1121
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,140
for free

1122
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:49,700
Stop spawning in those guys, please. I can't deal with you all right there

1123
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:54,340
We have no increased angel chance when we do our boss fight

1124
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:57,780
Goodbye bean. We do not need you

1125
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:00,580
And okay damage again

1126
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:02,660
again

1127
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:04,660
seven damage

1128
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:07,540
We're getting there right what we got what we looking at

1129
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:12,820
What we looking at analizing the room that's looking good

1130
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,060
Good for the most part

1131
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:18,740
For the most part, but yeah that uh trapeze trapeze

1132
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:24,100
Uh the prism that we got that album from that one band. I completely forgot the name of it

1133
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:30,740
Again like the I don't want to pay money to roll these I'd rather just blow up the donation machine and spend it on angels

1134
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:33,300
honestly, right so we are going to pop

1135
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,900
Pop lock and drop it by uh

1136
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,100
Doing that so now we already have two prisms

1137
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,060
It oh god, I hate the eyes so much

1138
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:48,180
They like laser beam attack and you have like zero time to respond. It's so annoying

1139
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:52,020
But with how many

1140
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:54,180
Drops we might be getting

1141
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:58,260
I hate the ones on the wall as well. Oh and the ghosts as well. You know what?

1142
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:02,980
I just I just struggle with a lot of isic enemies. You know what? I'll admit my weak points

1143
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:06,340
I'm just bad at the game. I just get very lucky with my drops

1144
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:11,140
But yes as you oh my god, lunch it was a two percent drop for lunch

1145
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:20,420
No way it was a two percent drop for lunch. Can you can you come out already? Geez you are hiding bro

1146
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,540
You're quivering

1147
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:26,660
Is he for real? Is he the only enemy in the room? Ah, right? Okay

1148
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:30,340
Uh two percent

1149
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:36,020
Bro the streamer luck. Sorry. I've never had such good isic. I wonder I've not played the game in like over a month

1150
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:38,980
Is it possible the game like detects?

1151
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:46,500
Fuuuuck you know is it possible the game can detect have not played in a while and is like uh

1152
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:49,940
Game odds make this person addicted to isic again

1153
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:55,860
I don't know if that's a thing. I mean it could be if you wanted it to be

1154
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:59,220
Oh my god the homing

1155
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:01,220
Oh

1156
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:04,020
Not those homing bombs the other kind of hoping

1157
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,940
Ah just

1158
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:11,540
Do you see the bottom stat that says 66

1159
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:18,740
Angel and we and we get devil grove. I'm not risking my health. Sorry. I'm not I'm not risking my health

1160
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:21,620
Right, we've got a golden key, which means we get a free pair

1161
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:24,420
Yeah

1162
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:28,580
If this drops yara rune it is over

1163
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:37,140
If this drops yara rune it is over yara duplicates all items that are on the floor

1164
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:43,380
I'm going to pop temperance as well. I'm going to use that on this floor

1165
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,380
It it is over

1166
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:53,620
I'm going to pop temperance uh on purpose. I'm going to pop it inside the shop. I'm right

1167
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,420
Right

1168
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:00,020
I'm gonna pick that up. I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna tap down to two

1169
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:04,580
No, no pay out. Are you not feeling it buddy? Come on

1170
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:07,540
I'm so mommy

1171
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:12,420
What is this flight for the room? Okay curious curious don't need it but curious nonetheless

1172
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:14,420
Oh

1173
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,140
What is going on?

1174
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:28,580
What is going on we now have counterfeit penny which every time we pick up one coin we have a chance to double it

1175

Uh, maybe a crawl space

1179
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:56,180
We just broke something. I heard that

1180
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,740
Did we break something?

1181
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:04,260
Um, it's gonna be worth their money. I'm not gonna put it down any further

1182
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:10,420
There we go black. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. Okay

1183
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:15,860
We've got the hanged man something broke in here. I heard it when we use that room chart

1184
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,900
Keep money for the angel

1185
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:22,420
Man, you're so right me once

1186
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:28,180
I will not be tempted I will not be tempted

1187
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:33,060
Although I have five bombs so I'm just gonna blow him up in case he has a chance

1188
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:39,380
Oh, we can get it we can do a tears up and two so hearts

02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:48,980
I can't believe the streamer luck. What is this?

1191
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:52,820
What is the streamer log? I can't believe it

1192
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:57,140
Oh, come on we lily

1193
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,260
I'm ready to have a heart attack out of excitement

1194
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:02,740
Right don't

1195
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:04,420
Oh

1196
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,420
Hell is that it?

1197
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:10,740
I'm actually not that interested but I'm interested in blowing you up to fuck me

1198
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,500
Do we want to I don't really want to

1199
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:27,300
I

1200
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:32,500
Stone at the top one guys. What did I miss? Yeah, Edmund person that showed up in my house when I stopped for a year

1201
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:35,380
Oh Edmund personally showed up at my house and stopped

1202
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:40,180
Yeah, I'm not really fussed. I might give

1203
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:45,620
I might give some of my money to to the beggar honestly

1204
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:49,940
Right, we're gonna bomb because we have one in three chance for a soul here

1205
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:57,220
Well, I used up all my streamer luck. I'm gonna give some money to the judgment. Normally he gives us a good little

1206
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:02,260
Uh, we already have mother which is a shame. Um, but hey hope

1207
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:07,460
Right, we've got a maculic conception and now we will leave. Thank you

1208
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,420
Now we can go straight into here

1209
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:13,460
We may get conjoined

1210
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:17,940
Oh my god, just say you love me game

1211
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:26,020
Just say you personally love me. It's fine. Oh and another one of these come on, baby

1212
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:35,540
Just say you love me

1213
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,860
Just say it game

1214
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:42,980
Right, we're gonna use the hanged man because there's not really gonna be any opportunity to use it for anything else to be honest

1215
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,780
Oh

1216
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:50,180
As if that didn't drop anything range or range is fine

1217
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:54,020
This is insane

1218
02:03:54,020 --> 02:04:00,500
What the hell is happening? Uh, I'm getting extremely lucky to the point where my chair is wet

1219
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:06,900
This is just by far insane

1220
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,820
Streamer luck that you're seeing in 4k

1221
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:14,340
Um, it is beyond comprehension

1222
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:19,380
How insane I'm gonna purposely try not pick anything up because if we drop a yara rune

1223
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:25,220
I see skinny runes being dropped. I'm asking politely for a yara rune. I don't spot one

1224
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,900
I don't spot a yara

1225
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,020
I don't spot one

1226
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:34,740
Maybe next time maybe next time maybe next time

1227
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:37,060
Okay

1228
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:43,860
Okay, one more fight one more fight. I can I'm trying so hard not to pick up anything. Oh, it's that yara

1229
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:52,500
I'm fucking coming. I'm coming right. We need to do the angel first though

1230
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:56,420
What are you seraphim double tapping creates a shield sure?

1231
02:04:57,620 --> 02:04:59,620
Oh my god, we have yara

1232
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,500
Oh

1233
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:07,700
Yara duplicates all pickups in the room. Well, I am

1234
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:10,740
Don't mind if I do

1235
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:13,380
Talk about streamer luck. Holy moly

1236
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:18,580
A bit of streamer luck don't mind if I do. Uh, I'm probably not actually oh my god. Oh

1237
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,460
My yeah

1238
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:25,220
We oh, we have so much we have so much we need to go spend

1239
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:32,180
Please right. We don't need range. We don't need that. Let's do what we're not going to do chaos

1240
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:40,980
We're not going to do that either. Jeez. Uh, I mean an orbital for defense really isn't that bad. We can swallow trinkets

1241
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,860
Is that no am I done I did I buy the wrong thing possibly

1242
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:53,060
We could buy a card pack and the chance that we get two

1243
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:56,020
Times two money on hand

1244
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:58,500
doubles my bombs

1245
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:08,980
Yes, please I will make sure I have 50 in my inventory. Thank you. Oh my god. What is going on?

1246
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,580
What is going on actually hacks right now? I'm not being funny, but actually hacks

1247
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:17,700
Uh

1248
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,860
Attracts coins. No, I don't need that

1249
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,860
range

1250
02:06:21,860 --> 02:06:23,860
No, we don't need range

1251
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:27,460
We'll take any of this stuff

1252
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:30,420
More damage

1253
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,020
for me

1254
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:34,500
Oh, you shouldn't have game. You're so nice to me

1255
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,460
Do it again and keep doing it. I'm gonna come

1256
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:42,580
Every 30 seconds drops a battery for max pair

1257
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:45,060
to in the room

1258
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,220
You want that? I think we want that

1259
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:52,100
No, we are not using plan c before anyone says plan c shite bag if you didn't

1260
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:55,140
Uh, sure. We'll take another

1261
02:06:56,260 --> 02:07:01,220
I've got another orbital if we want protection high priestess. I'm going to check what's in the bottom room

1262
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:04,100
Let me just pick up the rest of these real quick

1263
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:10,660
Um, we do have a chance for a crawl space with these guys. So use them on the diamond. Uh, there you go

1264
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:14,260
Just like that. Uh, any any image tail

1265
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:17,140
Do we

02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:19,700
Homing homing lasers

1267
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,900
Homing laser beam

1268
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:31,380
Oh, we have met uh homing laser beam. So we're going to take this rune shard to the next floor

1269
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:36,100
Homing

1270
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:38,820
Uh

1271
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:45,140
This cannot be

1272
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,900
This cannot be

1273
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:52,740
Is this what the children refer to as streamer luck? Now, we're gonna just pick up the bandage because why not?

1274
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:56,500
Were you shot speed and health? No, thank you

1275
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:02,900
This can't I'm literally hacking the the code is called

1276
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:07,060
A h a a 3g to tango

1277
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,500
Come on. Oh my god

02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:15,300
Uh, I don't want black hole the one that let's try and I oh

02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,900
Oops, I can't get the angel angel deal now. Oh well

1280
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:31,940
The bells of heaven are ringing

1281
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:39,300
What the fuck is this dreamer look every time we now activate we double or we double on uh like on top like

1282
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:40,580
brov

1283
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:42,580
brov

1284
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:44,660
What is going on?

1285
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:51,780
Right, we have bombs. We're gonna bomb the machine. Hopefully we can get a fiverr back. Uh, I doubt it, but hey ho

1286
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:54,180
You never know

1287
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,060
We got our penny back

1288
02:08:57,060 --> 02:09:00,420
Um, right. We're good to go. We've got counterfeit penny

1289
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:04,420
Life is good and we have freaking yara

1290
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,660
I'm making sure to avoid that with all my life

1291
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:10,740
And I definitely picked up the items from the room because I forget all the time to pick up the items

1292
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:12,900
But I'm just making double sure right, okay

1293
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:19,380
This is rng the greatest rng to ever rng. Yes again the room code for this greed is

1294
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:24,020
alpha hotel alpha alpha 3 juliet 2 tango

1295
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:27,940
Okay, we're taking yara to the night floor

1296
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:33,700
And before another yara, okay, this is now the last ah sugar

1297
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:37,620
I should have

1298
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:43,540
Oh, that would have actually been a bit juicy. I have to admit it's a damage up. Um, like it is what it is

1299
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:45,940
It is what it is

1300
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:48,900
Uh judgment. I'm so sorry to do this to you mate, but

1301
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:52,580
There is no hope

1302
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:54,980
Right you and go

1303
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:56,660
Okay

1304
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:59,380
Okay, let's see what the shop has to offer off the oh, wow

1305
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:05,220
Whatever, uh, oh no should have left on the floor. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

1306
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:10,740
Okay, let's clear out this area see if there's anything of interest

1307
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:15,300
Uh off the bat not rng yara. Maybe bomb these guys see what's up

1308
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,340
And this was a

1309
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,300
What does 19 do

1310
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:31,060
Taking damage as a span chance to spawn something not really fuss for that. Uh, we will cycle to the next just to see what's up

1311
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:38,180
We might be able to get a spun duplicate two random pickups in the room

1312
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:41,060
Curious

1313
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:47,060
Uh, right yara. We do not want to pick up anything. Is this run even a challenge? No

1314
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:51,460
And that's the best part about isaac when you break the game

1315
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:56,420
Because the game wants you to suffer the game wants you to cry and give up

1316
02:10:56,820 --> 02:11:02,500
So when you break the game because of how kind it's been. Oh, wow, we're unlocking super meat boy

1317
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:07,380
I didn't realize you do that that laughter meant there's a hand going to come down

1318
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:15,620
Yeah, like that. I'm trying not to pick up anything. I really am I'm trying got out something got me. I don't know what got me

1319
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,140
I'm

1320
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:23,540
Again with the hands. Hold on. I really am trying not to pick up a single thing in this room, but they're getting pushed around

1321
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:26,980
Oh, goodness, ruby. I can't

1322
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:29,380
I can't even see

1323
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:30,420
Okay

1324
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:35,860
Okay, just gently easy. Let's kill the bosses nice and quick nice and quick

1325
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:40,820
Nice and quickly now. Don't pick anything up in this room

1326
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:44,660
Okay, one more time one more time

1327
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:48,580
Uh

1328
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,900

02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:58,180
Okay, okay easy easy just just edge ourselves gently

02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:21,300
Okay, duplicate everything and then we're going to look to see if there's an extra era just for the

1335
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:26,100
Unlucky we've got full health on the sun. So let's pop that

1336
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:29,860
And then we're going to grab oh the sun again

1337
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:33,860
Of course, it was going to be the sun again because we uh did a thing called duplication. You dumb dumb

1338
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:39,300
Roon shard. What did that do? Roon shard

1339
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:45,540
Okay, we're gonna just do a little investigation on our our wares or trinkets

1340
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:49,940
Unlucky room full ago. I know I guess there is another era though

1341
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:54,660
Okay, let's go spend some of this goodness. We're gonna go to short speed

1342
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:59,220
We don't really need luck although that gives us a soul heart and

1343
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:04,660
Oh, no, I'm already full. Okay, let's spin. Wait, there might be a secret here

1344
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,780
No, it must be down

1345
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:11,380
Uh, we don't really need any of this

1346
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:19,540
Can we duplicate spider baby? That would be cute. Oh sure. Oh wait. No, that was silly. Okay taking damage of this goods

1347
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:25,220
Sponsor sack. I mean we're at the end of the game anyway. We don't really need it

1348
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,620
Yeah, let's see what else we've got. We've got fun guy

1349
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:36,340
I mean, what's underneath fun guy? We won. Oh, we got spun. We got spun feels good, man

1350
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:39,780
Okay, let's uh

1351
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:42,900
Wait, didn't I not bomb that or am I going crazy?

1352
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:50,900
This is why Lilith is so broken in greed mode honestly

1353
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:54,820
so

1354
02:13:55,780 --> 02:14:03,300
Are you fucking serious right now, right? Anyway, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

1355
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:06,180
I'm not mad

1356
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:12,820
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Okay. I'm not mad. I'm not raging. I'm not absolutely raging

1357
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:19,700
I didn't even know the runes could do that to be honest. Oh home in tears as if I need it as if I need it

1358
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:26,260
Right, I'll pick it up already. I mean I can Yara this room room, I guess

1359
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:29,940
Yara

1360
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:32,020
Give me my pennies

1361
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:33,300
right

1362
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:41,220
What can we can buy four more items as long as the restock machine? We don't need health now

1363
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,500
As long as this doesn't blow up

1364
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:46,100
What?

1365
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:51,860
Okay, my only exception of going in here is for yeah, oh first wrong one. Oh, that's a bomb

1366
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:55,140
Oh, we got gupsters

1367
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:57,540
Oh, we got one gupsters

1368
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:00,340
Yeah

1369
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:03,540
And then we go pick up immaculate conception again

1370
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:10,740
Active item can be overcharged if only you showed up a bit earlier right we'll take halo. That's a massive upgrade. Um

1371
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:14,340
I mean, we've only got enough money for two more

1372
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:21,780
Range on tapeworm. Why would the tapeworm give you range? Honestly, and then just bomb it because we've not got enough for anything else

1373
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:28,900
Uh, oh, that's a shame. Uh, that's rubbish. Right. Uh, let's let's go

1374
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:36,740
Um full health. We'll take it just in case but I'm not really too worried and as we take damage

1375
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:39,460
We actually can spawn in more of the goodness

1376
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:43,460
So we got guppy a wee bit of guppy, but that's fine

1377
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:46,420
Now she finds sacred heart discounted to

1378
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:49,060
Oh, literally

1379
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:51,060
Oh, wait, there's another level to this

1380
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:52,900
Oh

1381
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,900
rubbish

1382
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:59,540
Wait, how did you predict that? I would get sacred heart spawned in again

1383
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:08,900
That the game literally said I'll be nice to you. That's funny though. It's okay though. Oh, there

1384
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,780
Are sure the judgment why not?

1385
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:15,300
Can't really do anything else with more money. So here you go buddy. All yours

1386
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,820
I only have 15 coins. Don't be greedy now

1387
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:22,980
I have the stars. Yeah, I'm not sure the

1388
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:28,500
Hey, I only I only have three coins judgment. You're supposed to have an increased drop rate. Yeah, okay

1389
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:33,700
Well, it is what it is

1390
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:43,460
Okay, now there's normally we enemy in here. I'm not gonna pop my active for this room. That's just not worthy at all

1391
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:46,660
Um

1392
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:49,380
Can bomb the I mean it doesn't really do anything at this point

1393
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:54,820
It's just the instant like

1394
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,020
Uh

1395
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,460
I don't know

1396
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:02,420
Now we can purposely hurt ourselves

1397
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:05,460
To get because we have nuns habit

1398
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:09,540
If we purposely hurt ourselves, we can get charged and then that's another

1399
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:14,740
Like batch of guys in to do damage. This is ridiculous

1400
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:17,700
But as you can see, um

1401
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:23,700
Lilith is a wee bit broken in greed mode. We literally aren't even fighting. He's not even near us

1402
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,340
And we're just mowing this poor guy down

1403
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,300
Like

1404
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:31,460
We're not even

1405
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:34,740
We no wild card necessary in this run

1406
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:39,220
Oh my god, and we're dropping charges. We might actually get another

1407
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:41,780
um

1408
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:49,060
Chart if someone drops the chart, uh, you we could get another go out. I mean, it's done for honestly

1409
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:53,540
It's done for

1410
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,500
He he he

1411
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:59,380
But yeah, that is greed mode

1412
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:07,140
And I'm just pop it again so we can have another duplicate of everyone look at my gang

1413
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:11,780
Look at my gang. My gang is amazing. This I've already done 99

1414
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:19,700
20% jam rate as you can see I enjoy playing Lilith a lot in greed mode because you see the 20 percent jam rate

1415
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:23,220
That means that machine is all fed by her and no one else

1416
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:31,060
Um, that was a bad jam rate. But yes, that is greed mode. That is Isaac is a fantastic game

1417
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:33,140
I cannot praise it enough. Um

1418
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:38,980
You will lose so many hours in this. Why no phase two. We were not playing greedier mode

1419
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:43,620
Greedier mode is a lot different than greed mode. I am not that strong in

1420
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:46,740
Greedier mode

1421
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,740
Oh, you remember that

1422
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:50,020
um

1423
02:18:50,020 --> 02:18:52,900
That was complete streamer

1424
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:58,500
Um rng complete streamer rng. That was insane. Um

1425
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:05,220
I cannot believe that. I truly cannot believe that. Well, you play Isaac more and I mean in other streams. Yes in november

1426
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:07,620
I'll be playing it with you

1427
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:10,180
Um

1428
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:14,660
But yes, this game has like an insane amount of items

1429
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:21,380
Like in com in combinations you can do and as you can see an elite gamer like myself

1430
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:28,100
Still hasn't unlocked everything yet. Look, I've still not unlocked everything and I have like hundreds of hours in this game

1431
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:33,860
Um, but yeah, there's like look see look tons of stuff. I haven't unlocked

1432
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:39,540
Eh, there's so all these items you unlock by playing the game

1433
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:41,540
I

1434
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:46,900
How fast it's doable to I'm not even fighting him absolute Chad menace

1435
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:50,660
But yeah, as you can see a lot on the the last stuff not unlocked

1436
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:53,380
Bloody guts

1437
02:19:53,380 --> 02:19:55,140
Lusty blood

1438
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:57,140
Does he fuck?

1439
02:19:57,140 --> 02:19:58,900
Fuck his ass

1440
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,420
But yeah, um

1441
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:05,860
Absolutely fantastic game. Uh, you know make or break your run come. It's it's

1442
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:10,740
Insanity the game started with, um

1443
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:13,780
Ignore the death counter

1444
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:17,620
Ignore the best street counter while you're at it as well

1445
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:20,500
um

1446
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:23,940
It's just I cannot praise the game enough. Um

1447
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:27,540
You know, there's tons of endings in the game

1448
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:31,140
Well, I'll show you the true ending

1449
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:35,060
That makes me very sad, but this is a true ending

1450
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:03,140
His mother mourning the loss

1451
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:07,940
He saw his father leaving them without turning to say goodbye

1452
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:13,060
He saw his mother sleeping and his father taking money from her purse

1453
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:18,900
He heard the late night fights they had that kept him up at night and the guilt

1454
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:21,220
He felt for what he believed he was causing

1455
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:25,540
He felt the pain in his stomach during those sleepless nights

1456
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:29,140
And saw his shadow in the closet waiting for him

1457
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:32,500
As he rose he felt his fears drop

1458
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:41,700
I cried so hard the first time as he became lighter his ascent became faster

1459
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:45,620
He saw his one true companion alive

1460
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:50,980
He saw his mother and father together again holding each other

1461
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:55,300
He felt his mother kissing him on the head after he had said his prayers

1462
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:58,740
And the comfort in knowing someone was watching over him

1463
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:06,260
He saw his own birth and the faces of his parents filled with joy and optimism

1464
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:08,260
And then

1465
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:10,260
He saw nothing

1466
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:13,140
Are you sure this is how you want this story to end Isaac?

1467
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:16,500
You're the one writing it. It doesn't have to end this way

1468
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:18,420
Here

1469
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:20,420
How about we tell it a different way?

1470
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:22,820
Maybe a happy ending

1471
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,620
Good

1472
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,620
Are you getting sleepy yet?

1473
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:28,660
Yeah

1474
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,660
Okay, so

1475
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:36,980
Isaac and his parents lived in a small house and that's the start of the that's the opening of the game

1476
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:40,660
So that ending a lot of people misinterpret it

1477
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:43,300
a certain way

1478
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:51,940
But Ed McMuffin has confirmed multiple times that yes, Isaac dies in the chest. He is a dead five-year-old in a chest

1479
02:22:52,820 --> 02:22:56,500
The ending people couldn't make heads or tails of because that male voice

1480
02:22:56,740 --> 02:23:01,700
Male on stream and that male voice you hear is his dad annunciate in the game. Okay

1481
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:06,500
But the reason I want to point it out to you is because

1482
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:09,060
Isaac has been

1483
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:11,940
You know, he's got religious trauma. So he's being told

1484
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:15,540
If i'm a good boy, I go to heaven all my fears go away

1485
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:20,020
So as he's in his final moments as he slips away

1486
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:26,740
In his head after defeating all these enemies these endless waves of bosses. He's done everything he possibly could

1487
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:29,620
he feels

1488
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:30,980
the fear

1489
02:23:30,980 --> 02:23:31,940
and

1490
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:36,020
The guilt just melt off his body as he finally slips

1491
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:42,980
And passes away inside the chest. He can see that third perspective of his mum finding him

1492
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:47,140
He can see that third perspective of him watching over because um

1493
02:23:47,860 --> 02:23:50,020
In the male in the dad's voice he goes

1494
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:56,340
Are you sure you want this story to end this way Isaac and Isaac says? Yes. I want it to be over

1495
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:02,660
I want it to be why did you show us this because people can't figure out what the ending means and i'm gonna mention it

1496
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:07,700
I'm gonna mention it in my little review and be like, why is this open to interpretation? It's very clear

1497
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:10,180
If if Ed McMuffin goes

1498
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:12,260
Isaac perishes

1499
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:17,860
Everyone's like oh, but the fight the fight. He's away in heaven. No Isaac perished. He's been taught about heaven

1500
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:22,900
This entire game is about being taught religion dogma all this stuff

1501
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:24,420
he

1502
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:26,820
Thinks he's going to heaven in his last moments

1503
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:32,180
He feels no guilt because he's done everything this entire thing is in his head. He is in a chest

1504
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,500
Adroni, Adroni explains the Bible

1505
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:40,900
Sorry, I'm like clapping me hands. I'm like, who do she wants this to be to breath right delirium ending is that ending 21?

1506
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:42,900
19 is delirium

1507
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:45,140
No, this is the mother fight

1508
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:47,780
in 20

1509
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:52,580
So

1510
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:56,260
Is this still this isn't delirium

1511
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,900
Are you sure these three are hand clapping

1512
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:06,660
Why are you just drawing the game for me close the game's been out for 10 years?

1513
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:14,740
It's the 10 year anniversary this year. Do don't come here being like you're running the game 10 years this game's been out for

1514
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:19,780
You're not coming to me being like no you've given me spoilers. No, I'm not having that

1515
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:24,420
10 years you've had a you've had a deck aid

1516
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:27,860
A deck aid

1517
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:32,340
So this is what happens dies. This is his wee body

1518
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:38,820
He's no longer missing because we found him

1519
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:45,140
You haven't finished a single run in this game that's different

1520
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:52,820
I was five seconds from getting this ending now it's ruined. Yeah. Well, you know what else is ruined open your mouth

1521
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:54,500
I'm gonna fart in it

1522
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,500
Now your taste buds are ruined

1523
02:25:56,660 --> 02:25:58,660
I

1524
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:02,740
Can't believe strong we just spoiled the game like that a game that's been out for a decade

1525
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:11,140
Yes, um, I am going to absolutely go ham reviewing this game. I'm reviewing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I'm a reviewing Isaac

1526
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:14,500
I'm actually doing call to the lamb which is probably my newest 10 out of 10

1527
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:17,300
um

1528
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:20,020
Out of respect for the development team

1529
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:24,100
I'm not allowed to review Elden Ring because I don't play it the way it's intended

1530
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:31,700
But if I could I would I would say it's a 10 out of 10 if they implemented multiplayer the way people would like it

1531
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:38,500
What will she ruin next first mix? So now Isaac. Oh, I can't believe it

1532
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:43,460
Out of respect for the dev team, bro. I do not play I uh

1533
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:45,140
Elden Ring

1534
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:48,660
In any way shape or form of what the dev team announced that

1535
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:52,340
Uh, we intended it to be like right now

1536
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:57,700
Oh, I just got an achievement. It says yellow baby unlocked and caught. Don't mind if I do

1537
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:00,420
Uh, we are gonna redirect

1538
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:02,020
into

1539
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:03,220
sheepsters

1540
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:05,220
If she's uh

1541
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:12,180
If she's uh, if she's uh, no, we're not because I'm freaking logged out. Holy crap. Wait. Why am I?

1542
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:21,940
I'm logged out of youtube so hold on. I might have to go to my other fucking pc from are you serious?

1543
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:25,220
and

1544
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,220
hold on

1545
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:30,260
Actually, I do have something to show you though

1546
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:38,500
But yeah, as you can see I do not even have an even start one two sheep

Which is this is the version I can show you on youtube

1549
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:51,300

Roommate instructs you to help with arriving at your destination early

1563

So if you're an early destination arriver, I may or may not

We are going to return the favor to serenity

1584
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:50,660
Serenity has been a fantastic friend of mercy and she's redirected into me a couple of times. Please

1585
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:53,300
Be very kind to serenity

1586
02:30:53,380 --> 02:30:59,460
She has shown us nothing but kindness and she owes us nothing and yet has poured her heart out to violor

1587

So please I urge you to give a very nice. Hello to serenity on my behalf

02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:18,100
If I can pull up her channel, please. Why does it do that? Honestly?

1591
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:23,060
Um, but yeah speaking of tarot cards, she's one of them

1592
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:28,500
She's kind of playing sonic adventures a little nerd

1593
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:29,940
and

1594
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:31,940

1598
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:55,860
Thank you so much for letting me neared out about Isaac as well. This game means a lot to me in terms of

1599
02:31:56,420 --> 02:32:01,940
I played it a lot whilst um violor was in production. So I felt quite

1600
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:08,980
I don't know. It's just one of those things where I will always associate the game with just having a hoot and holler

1601
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:10,500
Um

1602
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:15,060
And all that jazz. Anyway, thank you so much. We feelings. I'll see you shortly if you're a member or if not, please don't worry

A cheeky bit of iron man and you'll be able to see what's coming up for the week

1606
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:29,060
I am doing a bit of shorter streams, but that's because I have very fantastic news coming out soon

1607
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:36,260
There is a lot of exciting things. I cannot say yet, but I believe in the next 40 hours

1608
02:32:36,260 --> 02:32:42,020
There should be something very um fun that I will review on stream. That is public access. Um

1609
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:47,620
There's also uh another thing. You know what? There's a lot of things. Okay. Um

But yes, thank you so so much for letting me know about Isaac
