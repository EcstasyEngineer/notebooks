00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Wait, she's going in the garage now.

How do I trap her in?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Oh, we pull it down.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
We pull it down.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh no, I was...

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh no!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Have I just softlocked us?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
The objective, get her stuck in it.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Me instantly get stuck in it.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Wait, until she gets inside.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello, come in.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Wait, unless I steal an item and run in with it.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Chase me into the garage.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
No, I dropped it. No, I dropped the freaking thing!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh no again!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Why is this so hard?
