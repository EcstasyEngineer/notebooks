432520	441000	okay and me mark my territory okay okay okay my cringiest memory was uh when i was like
441080	446760	around five years old my dad would always pester me about getting a boyfriend he would always be
446760	452680	like oh your friend your friend ashley has a boyfriend why don't you have a boyfriend and so one day
452680	457560	he asked me again and i got really really fed up so obviously i didn't have a boyfriend
458920	463720	so what i told him he asked me again like oh do you have a boyfriend in me
465160	469320	i said the name of the only boy that both me and my dad knew
471000	475480	and do you want to know whose name i said who i said what was my boyfriend your brother
476200	482600	i said my cousin's name i told my dad i was dating my cousin
486280	488600	kastin a little too good over here what the heck
493720	499160	mersey my cringiest moment my entire life is a cringe
499240	504680	oh so it's hard to pick out one so i guess my most
505320	515320	cringiest moment i can think of is like oh i really was tuney like real tuney back in like
515320	521480	middle school and elementary school i would refer to myself as like third person and then i would
521480	529880	be like yes yes i can control the wind oh i can control the wind and i was born in a family of like
530760	536600	i don't remember what i fucking said i think i was like you know it was like a phoenix a phoenix angels or
536600	544920	something i was so cringe hell yeah azura oh no
553560	562360	i relate a lot to mersey just kidding sorry oh no look all right hear me out all right i'm
562840	566920	sure everyone has a moment when they were a kid you know
569480	572120	i used to pretend to be an animal
577960	586840	and i would run around on all floors in an empty park oh that's normal for a kid yeah but some kids
586920	591640	my school caught me oh no it's all right i barked at people
602440	609720	okay i think i think i can finally speak now okay so my uh
610680	618920	cringiest and most embarrassing memory is when i was in elementary school
621080	628280	at the end of the year we had like this uh thing where we did a lot of different dances
628840	634200	and everyone's parents would show up to like a big like area to see that
634920	641960	so we would practice the dances and stuff and i was like so confident and sure that like i
641960	652280	remember my dance moves and everything and so we're all like sitting down uh and there is like
652280	658040	a certain like specific part in the song when we need to get up and like start the actual dance
658200	667320	mm so the music starts and then you see me the only one who gets up to a fucking early
668040	675800	and starts dancing and then i realize that it's too fucking early and i'm just looking at
675800	685800	everyone around me it's so fucking embarrassing like and like slowly sitting back no this little
685800	696360	sit down of defeat yeah it was so embarrassing well let's see if i can beat all of their cringe
696360	705320	stories lads so i've always been uh sleeping during the day and up during the night and i had a
705320	711720	dentist appointment i was incredibly delirious because of the time it was at was actually in
711720	722840	my bedtime and if you didn't know the tongue is an exploratory muscle that you have so for around
722840	730680	15 minutes while i'm getting my teeth cleaned i essentially used i was really tired okay to be
730680	736520	fair but i essentially sucked and licked on this old man's fingers at my dentist and i didn't even
736520	743560	realize i did it until i got home because i was so delirious so this per man was like trying to
743560	749720	oh he liked that no he was like trying to help me get my teeth clean he was like oh yeah no
749720	758120	everything looks good and i'm just like like it haunts me to this day so that that's my
758120	768120	reduced memory no he totally liked that he jorked off to that later right right right right
768120	775080	on a more positive note how about we share what happy memories you have any any happy memory
775080	778600	it doesn't matter what it is well we start with ac this time and work our way back up
779480	793720	okay um my happiest memory is from when i was a child and basically my grandpa had this summer
793720	802920	house that he had built and my grandma and grandpa they had like a small farm in that house and so we
802920	812520	would go there a lot of times so that happy memory happens there because there's this one time when
812520	821560	me my mom and my grandma we went to sit on the tall grass outside and it was very cloudy and my mom
821560	831640	was like reading like a book story to me and then it started raining so we went inside and i remember
831640	840360	just my mom like making me tea and my grandma getting some fresh strawberries that she picked up
840360	847800	and giving it to me and just you know the nice scenery of the rain and the clouds while meeting like
847800	855720	fresh strawberries looking at my Barbie magazines just i don't know there's something about that memory
855720	865400	that is like the happiest i've ever felt in my entire life really so beautiful that's so my
866280	868280	uh-huh has there
871240	887480	well uh well last year my my cat did pass away um but my happiest memories were of us chasing each
887480	895080	other around the house uh i'd play you know hide and seek with him i'd hide and he'd look
895080	901960	for me and sometimes he'd also hide and wait to scare me and then we'd later duke it out
906360	907560	my cat is the same
907800	919960	memory um i guess when i was a kid um
922680	931560	mama and papa would uh we we didn't have a lot so the most distinct memory is of me receiving my
931560	945080	first gift from them um which was a vhs a vhs uh movie of pokemon the first movie and i was so happy
945080	950840	because that was the first time i've ever realized like what gifts were you know all day
951640	953640	oh
960920	967640	okay well a happy memory of mine is um i used to have this rat called medkip uh
968600	974600	she died a couple months ago but um she was my oldest living rat and she lived for almost three years
974600	981880	and that's really long for a rat they they don't live long so before she died i took her
981880	986200	outside of the house on a walk to the park and she stayed on my shoulder the whole time
986760	993640	and and we just sat um on the grass at the park and we watched the sunset together oh that's so precious
995880	1000440	and i carried her in my sweater on the way home and she pooped all in my sweater
1005000	1013960	um so as i mentioned in my debut i really love fantasy and um when i was younger my
1013960	1019720	grandparents took me to a renaissance fair and i got to dress up as like a little
1020440	1027480	little renaissance girl little princess and when i went they had the joust and i was selected to
1027480	1035000	give my favor to this lady knight and so she won her joust and then i got to give her a little like
1035000	1044120	favor on her um lance and i just felt like all of my dreams had come true like i was a part of
1044120	1055400	a fairy tale it was just i loved it so much it was so wholesome uh for my happy memory um so my dad
1055400	1059960	takes me game shopping as a child it's all childhood all of us were like childhood childhood
1061320	1069000	um so i couldn't read at the time like i was very young so i would go to the game shop with my dad
1069000	1074040	and look at the covers on the games and then present it to him and then he would judge if the game
1074040	1082440	was worthy enough for me to play or not so it was like some judgment of like um is this quality
1082440	1088600	enough for strawney a player or not um but it also led me to getting into a lot of like cooler
1088600	1094920	games that i wouldn't have had access to like mech assault or halo these kind of games so i'm very
1094920	1100760	thankful for my dad um it's just like such a goofy little memory of being like please dad can i get
1100760	1110760	this game and be like no no that's not good enough for you strawney okay and then that's adorable now we
1110760	1119480	do need chat participation for this next one okay we're playing two truths and a lie chat do you
1119480	1128760	think you're able to detect a lie from these girls hmm yeah hmm we'll find out we'll find out so
1130760	1136280	you know what i'm gonna start this game i need to need to open up chat so i can do a little thing
