0	3000	I'm not happy with you, you know.
3000	8000	Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?
8000	12000	Alright, I need to get a chance screen.
12000	14000	I need to get a chance screen.
14000	19000	Why is my iPhone bugging the fuck?
19000	21000	Oh, relax.
21000	22000	What?
22000	24000	I'm bugging out.
24000	26000	Am I getting a chance screen?
26000	27000	Get a chance screen.
27000	29000	No.
29000	30000	No, it's not.
30000	31000	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
31000	32000	Scuffs already started, boys.
32000	33000	Scuffs already started.
33000	35000	Look, he's a, he has a thing.
35000	36000	He has a thing.
36000	37000	One minute, one month.
37000	41000	I was there to do some, some business things.
41000	45000	God, the freaking scuff is a thing.
45000	48000	What the hell's going on?
48000	52000	The tracker is hating me right now.
52000	54000	Can you hear me?
54000	55000	Have you all seen this?
55000	58000	Have you all heard about this?
58000	63000	Okay, I think I'm going to have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck?
63000	66000	Can you guys hear the background music or no?
66000	68000	Okay, you can now.
68000	70000	You can hear a bit of Assassin's Creed.
70000	71000	Good morning.
71000	78000	My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal.
78000	82000	So not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on.
82000	85000	I'm just calibrating, testing left.
85000	87000	No, what the heck?
88000	90000	Can you not see my face?
90000	92000	Sorry, blame the technology.
92000	93000	What's that?
93000	94000	I should have used my loading screen.
94000	95000	Sorry, can't relate.
95000	97000	Couldn't care less.
97000	99000	And something, something.
99000	101000	Oh my God.
101000	103000	Is it because it's dark in this room?
103000	104000	I can't believe it.
104000	111000	I can't believe being a goblin in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons.
111000	113000	Hold on, hold on.
113000	120000	I need to come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC.
120000	122000	This is nonsense.
122000	123000	Honestly.
123000	125000	Why can't you see me iPhone?
126000	128000	I'm out of the port?
128000	130000	There are no keys.
130000	132000	Oh my God.
132000	136000	Right, anyway, I've got some good news.
136000	141000	Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out.
141000	144000	Right, I've got to lay on.
144000	145000	Right, I've got to lay on.
145000	147000	Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
147000	148000	Right, back and back and back.
148000	150000	Yeah, that's snuffing those.
150000	157000	Why can, can V-tube Studio not handle how you want them?
162000	164000	Why is that going?
164000	166000	Right, I don't think V-tube Studio works at all horizontal.
166000	168000	Oh, fuck you.
168000	170000	You stupid little twat.
170000	172000	First of all, you little prick.
172000	173000	Can it, hun?
173000	176000	Can it not, it can't go horizontal?
176000	178000	I'm confused but I'm ready.
178000	180000	You know what, fuck it, we're just jumping in.
180000	186000	I'll, I'll deal with the tracking issues once, uh, hold on, hold on.
188000	189000	Fuck it.
189000	190000	Okay, there we go.
190000	191000	I'm actually normal.
191000	193000	I don't know why the tracking bugging.
196000	198000	I'm covering up too much of the screen now.
198000	201000	Who's ready for someone's house screen now?
201000	205000	I do believe Asakul is still streaming, so please do support Asakul.
205000	216000	She's still streaming for a white Christmas.
216000	220000	Uh, let me just check before we jump into that.
220000	222000	Need to make sure I've got subtitles on.
222000	225000	Spoken language, English subtitles on.
225000	228000	Oh my god, I'm such a real gamer.
228000	230000	Are you ready?
230000	231000	AC is just ending.
231000	233000	Oh, does she be next?
233000	235000	I think she'd be maybe next.
237000	239000	Her god's EPS soldier.
239000	240000	Yeah.
240000	242000	Right, okay.
243000	247000	Oh, actually this is some, oh wait, no.
248000	258000	I, I did all my like, oh, latest, like tipper and all that if you did a donalink to me.
258000	259000	Oh no.
259000	260000	Oh, you know what?
260000	262000	Fuck it, we're playing Assassin's Creed, man.
262000	263000	Fuck the money.
263000	264000	I want to play Assassin's Creed.
264000	266000	Um, I wanted to say something.
266000	270000	I don't know if you guys would like this, but whenever we play a video game, obviously
270000	274000	there's names in the video game and, uh, as rid for a feature, but to like name people
274000	275000	and chat.
275000	281000	So I want it to be like special congratulations if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean,
281000	286000	if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy, if your name's Ezio, like in the video game.
286000	291000	I don't know, like maybe only the guy names make sense, but I thought that would be a
291000	292000	bit different.
292000	296000	Um, yeah, special shout out if your name's Desmond.
296000	299000	Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me.
299000	301000	Eh, there we go.
301000	304000	Eh, Desmond, that's right, your name is Desmond.
304000	305000	Okay.
305000	309000	I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find themselves caught in
309000	312000	the middle of a war between two secret organizations.
312000	315000	I know I do, but here I am.
315000	316000	On one side-
316000	318000	Can you guys hear the game?
318000	321000	Better known these days as exturgo industries.
321000	324000	They're in the business of control.
324000	326000	Politics, economics, knowledge-
326000	332000	Hey Skull, hope you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with
332000	333000	you.
333000	338000	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
338000	339000	I'm terrible.
339000	340000	I'm terrible.
340000	341000	I'm terrible.
341000	345000	Friendsly remainder, we don't have HR, uh, if you-
345000	350000	Did you enjoy Whim Raider, you little E.P. polar bear?
350000	352000	I caught the start of you, shtween.
352000	356000	Don't worry, I'll tell you the lore that you're missing out on, cause I'm rambling on
356000	357000	the top of it.
357000	358000	Ohhhhh.
358000	359000	Oh my God.
359000	360000	Altair.
360000	362000	Not Altair.
362000	365000	Not Altair.
365000	369000	The Templars wanted the location of something known as a piece of Eden.
369000	370000	The HR made-
370000	371000	Go out at night!
371000	372000	Nah, you're done.
372000	373000	Go away, manager.
373000	375000	Actually scare me.
375000	378000	They actually can make me graduate.
378000	381000	I always have to be like, my views are not-
381000	384000	They do not reflect the agency, because my views-
384000	388000	Mm-mm, they shouldn't reflect the agency.
388000	389000	Okay.
389000	392000	I was hoping that would be the end of my misadventures.
392000	394000	I have honey tea.
394000	397000	How are the snowberries?
397000	399000	Piece of Eden?
399000	400000	Eden D's nuts.
400000	401000	Okay, that was good.
401000	402000	You're welcome.
402000	403000	Da Frenze!
403000	407000	My ancestors from their insolence, searching for a path forward.
407000	408000	Ahhhhh!
408000	410000	But me!
410000	412000	I'm still here!
412000	413000	Ezio!
413000	414000	Ezio Auditor!
414000	415000	Hey, that's from Assassin's Creed 2.
415000	417000	We're gonna play that Lea-
417000	419000	Okay, I'm gonna play all Eden.
419000	422000	But we're playing Brotherhoods first.
422000	424000	Take me in between the views of the towns,
424000	426000	just to not reflect the agency.
426000	427000	True.
427000	428000	This is my story.
428000	429000	Oh my god.
429000	431000	Okay, I'm getting ready.
431000	433000	Oh my god, I'm ready.
433000	435000	I'm so excited to fucking play with you.
435000	438000	I'm sipping my tea.
438000	440000	Tell me if it's too loud or I'm too loud.
440000	443000	But let's be honest, I'm always too loud.
443000	445000	If I'm too big, I might need to make myself smaller.
445000	449000	You know that.
449000	453000	Would you like me small ewe?
453000	454000	Me.
454000	456000	This is a police dog from Mario.
456000	457000	Let me hear.
457000	462000	That's actually the full dialogue.
462000	463000	We got it.
463000	466000	We did the quick time thing.
466000	468000	The bigger the better.
468000	469000	No!
469000	474000	Oh my god, it's a horse feature bird!
474000	476000	Oh my god, it's Oz!
476000	483000	We're Ezio!
483000	485000	Serious hooded man.
485000	488000	Watch this.
488000	492000	You're awesome.
492000	494000	Technical difficulties.
494000	495000	Oh my god.
495000	496000	I couldn't.
496000	497000	This isn't on Xbox Game Pass,
497000	499000	so we're not getting any gamerscore from it.
499000	500000	What's that?
500000	501000	Another reason to play this game later?
501000	503000	Gee, will it hurt?
503000	504000	I have to tell.
504000	509000	Oh, it's General!
509000	516000	Fun fact.
516000	519000	So excited to play.
519000	521000	Who is Desmond?
521000	532000	I don't understand.
532000	539000	Oh, wait, that's not Italian.
539000	542000	Where did that Italian speak?
542000	551000	I'm here, me, Ezio Alditore.
551000	552000	This is my favourite bet,
552000	554000	because it always glitches out.
554000	556000	The fabric always glitches out on his knee in the scene.
556000	558000	It doesn't matter how many times you play through this game,
558000	560000	like it is instance of new glitches going to occur
560000	561000	during the cutscenes,
561000	564000	but it always glitches out on the knee at that cutscene.
564000	567000	It doesn't matter how many times you play it.
567000	569000	Mario, what are you doing here?
569000	571000	Better to be left in the hands of the earth
571000	576000	than in the hands of man.
576000	578000	I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished.
578000	581000	Where's that bloody Pope gone?
581000	586000	Where's that Pope gone?
586000	587000	Sorry, I'm drinking,
587000	589000	and then it makes me do hypnosis.
589000	593000	I'll just get so excited, okay?
593000	595000	Ah, we're being swallowed alive.
595000	597000	A zirgian taste.
597000	605000	It's already occurring.
605000	606000	Are we ready?
606000	607000	Are we ready?
607000	610000	Are we ready for the best freaking voice line from Mario?
610000	615000	Better to leave you in the hands of the earth.
615000	618000	Ah, it's such a good freaking quote.
619000	621000	It's an entire anime.
621000	622000	I was worried.
622000	625000	Quick, we have to get out of here.
625000	628000	Okay, so you can't actually jump up
628000	630000	if you do not engage in Eagle Vision.
630000	632000	So we're already in tutorial mode.
632000	634000	If you do not engage in Eagle Vision,
634000	637000	the game will not let you climb up at all.
637000	639000	But until you engage it.
639000	642000	So we're playing Ezio Auditoria da Frenze,
642000	645000	which means he was spawned in Frenze.
645000	649000	We are already an established assassin, okay?
649000	652000	We've just defeated the big bad evil in Assassin's Creed 2.
652000	654000	I'll shut up.
668000	670000	Oh my god, right, okay.
670000	671000	So yeah, we're Italian.
671000	673000	So Babadabopi, oh, that was jokes.
673000	676000	This up next part section.
676000	678000	So we're still in tutorial mode, obviously, the game.
678000	680000	But the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode
680000	684000	is because the game perfectly is structured.
691000	694000	He's created the sympathy of the only place.
694000	695000	What you're doing.
695000	696000	Oh, that's another good thing.
696000	699000	You condemn what you do not understand.
699000	701000	Right, so we can push people out of the way.
701000	703000	Out of my way, out of my way, out of my way.
703000	705000	Rosary beats up your arse.
705000	706000	Leave me alone.
706000	707000	Away you go.
707000	709000	Mario will actually get caught on those people.
709000	710000	It's quite funny.
710000	711000	That's your uncle Mario.
711000	712000	Uncle Mario.
714000	715000	Okay.
715000	716000	There you go.
716000	718000	My arm would blurted his attack.
718000	720000	Now I want you to remember that pineapple.
720000	722000	For no reason at all.
722000	724000	Remember the pineapple.
724000	727000	All hail the pineapple.
727000	729000	All hail the pineapple.
729000	732000	Okay, this next section is how you get one of the easiest
732000	733000	achievements in the game.
733000	735000	And it is perfectly sequenced for you to do so.
735000	737000	So look alive.
737000	739000	This is how you get the...
739000	740000	You haven't...
740000	741000	You're not to get hit.
741000	742000	You're not to get hit.
742000	743000	Oh shit, he knocked them over.
743000	744000	Right, hold on.
744000	745000	You wait for them to attack.
745000	748000	And then if you perfectly execute all these men,
748000	750000	then you get your first achievement,
750000	753000	which I believe is frenzy.
753000	757000	But if you do it perfectly, Mario shouldn't.
757000	759000	Unfortunately, the camera angles are a bit...
759000	760000	No!
760000	764000	I lost this straight because of the freaking camera angle.
764000	767000	Anyway, your first achievement is to kill 10 people in a row.
767000	769000	You could easily do it at that section of the game,
769000	771000	but don't worry if you miss it.
771000	773000	There are many opportunities to do so.
773000	775000	The camera angle will...
775000	776000	Merce you up.
776000	777000	I was going to say,
777000	778000	Merc you up.
780000	782000	The camera angle is a bit funny,
782000	784000	especially when you're in between buildings.
784000	786000	It's telling me to follow Mario.
786000	790000	You must also trail behind Mario a couple of meters.
790000	791000	If you are right behind him,
791000	794000	you will knock him off his coded path.
794000	795000	The AI will fix itself,
795000	797000	and he will go back on the path,
797000	798000	but you must give him space,
798000	800000	or you will knock him off the rooftops,
800000	802000	and then you have to wait even longer
802000	803000	for this section to occur.
803000	804000	But it's fine.
804000	805000	It's not a bad section.
805000	809000	This is to learn mostly rooftop moving about,
809000	811000	how to get your agility sorted.
811000	812000	You kind of get used to holding down.
812000	813000	I recommend...
813000	815000	Oh, see, that's another thing.
815000	817000	Sometimes AI say we will do something.
817000	819000	When you tell him to jump in a certain direction,
819000	820000	it's fine.
820000	822000	This game has aged beautifully,
822000	825000	and I believe this game came out...
826000	830000	2012.
830000	833000	Skyrim was 2011.
833000	835000	Again, you can knock Mario off this
835000	836000	if you're too quick.
836000	837000	You must be careful.
838000	840000	It was 2010.
840000	842000	Oh my God, I was a baby.
843000	846000	I remember asking my dad for this game,
846000	848000	and fun fact,
848000	850000	my dad bought me the special edition,
850000	852000	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
852000	855000	and it came in a special box.
855000	856000	If you opened it up,
856000	859000	I had the Assassin's logo on it,
859000	860000	and you opened up the box,
860000	863000	and the game pops up and presents itself, man.
863000	864000	It was freaking good.
864000	866000	Here's another section.
866000	867000	If I continue up,
867000	868000	he does not move.
868000	869000	Are you ready for this?
869000	870000	I'm going to...
870000	871000	Oh no!
871000	873000	You can't progress.
873000	875000	You have to go to the side.
875000	876000	He is in a wall right now
876000	878000	in the tutorial phase.
882000	883000	Yes, my dad gave me it,
883000	884000	and I was so happy.
884000	885000	I was so lucky.
885000	887000	Well, I'm a Sitma fish.
890000	892000	We're holding the apple of Eden.
898000	900000	The page doesn't load if you
900000	901000	click the link in the description.
901000	903000	Did I mess up my own donation link?
903000	904000	Oops!
914000	917000	Oh, this is a beautiful song.
930000	932000	Oh, the theme song.
932000	934000	I think that theme is called
934000	936000	Family Auditore.
937000	939000	It's such a lovely song.
939000	942000	It takes you to just your profile,
942000	944000	but not the tip page.
944000	945000	Eepth.
945000	946000	Eepth.
949000	950000	Can management...
950000	954000	Can you update my link live on the stream?
960000	962000	Thanks, management.
969000	971000	So we are now going back to
971000	973000	Montregion,
973000	976000	which is the home of the Auditore family.
979000	981000	And we've been introduced to cannons.
985000	987000	Finish my tea.
991000	993000	Look how much money.
993000	996000	We have 53,000 Florence,
996000	998000	which was the currency.
998000	1000000	Florence, yes.
1000000	1002000	So we are now heading back
1002000	1004000	from Il Vaticano,
1004000	1006000	Roma, with Mario on our little
1006000	1007000	horsey-worsies.
1007000	1009000	And we're about to come back
1009000	1011000	to our family villa location.
1011000	1013000	You can see that we've got the
1013000	1015000	Brotherhood, the Assassin's logo
1015000	1016000	on top.
1016000	1018000	And we've also got
1018000	1020000	the Assassin's logo on top,
1020000	1022000	and Assassin's is very famous in the village.
1022000	1024000	Because he's kind of the
1024000	1025000	back-assit.
1025000	1026000	Assassin's!
1026000	1027000	Assassin's!
1027000	1028000	I want to meet him!
1028000	1029000	Please!
1029000	1030000	Enjoy your meal!
1030000	1032000	We are going to be home.
1032000	1034000	These places just keep getting better.
1034000	1035000	Yes.
1035000	1036000	So everyone's very happy to see
1036000	1037000	Assassin's back.
1037000	1038000	Thanks to you.
1039000	1041000	And we also renovated this place
1041000	1043000	in Assassin's Creed 2.
1043000	1045000	It's your sister!
1045000	1046000	Claudia.
1046000	1047000	Claudia.
1047000	1048000	Claudia.
1052000	1054000	I'm so glad to see you with my own eyes.
1054000	1056000	The Contessa afford me to
1056000	1057000	welcome you.
1057000	1058000	The Contessa?
1061000	1062000	Here?
1065000	1067000	June, you're truly dead.
1068000	1070000	She has a really, like,
1070000	1072000	good but bad voice line at later
1072000	1073000	section.
1074000	1075000	But it ruins it
1075000	1077000	if you've not played this game.
1080000	1081000	So, we are assigned
1081000	1082000	three.
1082000	1083000	I repeat,
1083000	1085000	three little side quests here,
1085000	1087000	and it just kind of shows you,
1087000	1088000	you know, you can walk around,
1088000	1090000	you can walk around in the game.
1090000	1091000	If you hold the trigger,
1091000	1092000	you will do...
1093000	1094000	Oh!
1098000	1100000	A bit of degradation there, mate.
1103000	1104000	That'll do.
1105000	1106000	Did you know,
1106000	1107000	to say,
1107000	1108000	push in Italian?
1109000	1110000	Spingy!
1112000	1113000	Oh, also,
1113000	1115000	it shows a bit of a...
1115000	1116000	a bit of a slag.
1117000	1119000	A bit of a Waman's man.
1119000	1120000	A bit of a slag.
1120000	1121000	But then, anybody, then, anybody.
1122000	1124000	We'll make sure he gets his whole...
1124000	1125000	Oh, that's actually Scott!
1125000	1126000	A second teacher!
1126000	1128000	To say get your whole
1128000	1129000	means to
1129000	1130000	punk a girl.
1133000	1134000	Yes.
1135000	1136000	Sorry.
1136000	1137000	No one in Town Watch
1137000	1138000	who's such a burden.
1138000	1139000	I am sure
1139000	1140000	it's the only self
1140000	1141000	to be proud.
1143000	1144000	You know,
1144000	1145000	he's this big.
1151000	1152000	Rizio Auditori
1152000	1153000	defends
1153000	1154000	it for Renzi,
1154000	1155000	for real, for real.
1156000	1157000	You?
1157000	1158000	The party
1158000	1160000	was supposed to be a secret!
1160000	1161000	Well, that's what happens.
1161000	1162000	Loose lips and all that,
1162000	1164000	both bottom and top, hen.
1166000	1167000	Several things.
1168000	1169000	Hey!
1170000	1171000	She is offering us
1172000	1173000	gratitude
1173000	1174000	and services
1175000	1176000	to keep her sealed.
1178000	1179000	She won't be sealed
1179000	1180000	once I'm
1180000	1181000	in the room.
1181000	1182000	I don't know what she's like.
1183000	1184000	So we have to
1184000	1185000	complete her first quest.
1188000	1190000	Oh, she's touching her chest!
1191000	1193000	Nipple stimulation.
1195000	1196000	Oh, it's always tomorrow
1196000	1198000	with you lassies.
1198000	1199000	It's never now.
1199000	1200000	It's never...
1200000	1201000	Like, come on,
1201000	1202000	let's go behind the dumpster.
1202000	1203000	Always the motto
1203000	1204000	with lassies, man.
1205000	1206000	Can I trust them?
1207000	1208000	The link in description
1208000	1209000	has been up to you.
1209000	1210000	Just make sure
1210000	1211000	in OBS
1211000	1212000	you have the audio set
1212000	1213000	to monitor.
1216000	1217000	Sure.
1217000	1218000	I'll totally do that.
1219000	1220000	One
1220000	1221000	out of
1221000	1222000	three
1222000	1223000	side quests, okay?
1223000	1224000	So you're supposed
1224000	1225000	to do the flower girl
1225000	1226000	first, okay?
1226000	1227000	Because she drags you
1227000	1228000	into the villa,
1228000	1229000	like up to the villa, okay?
1232000	1233000	Fancy a shag
1234000	1235000	from A.C.W. himself.
1236000	1237000	Can I do an Italian accent
1237000	1238000	with the Scottish slang?
1239000	1240000	Fancy a shag?
1241000	1242000	No, I didn't.
1242000	1243000	It just sounds like
1243000	1244000	fancy a shag.
1244000	1245000	No, no toilet time.
1246000	1247000	Oh,
1247000	1248000	Mario's going to murder me.
1248000	1249000	I have lost
1249000	1250000	his favorite horse.
1250000	1251000	Ah!
1251000	1252000	You're tipping!
1252000	1253000	Wait, I didn't hear it, though.
1253000	1254000	I see the tip.
1254000	1255000	I saw the tip.
1257000	1258000	I saw the tip.
1258000	1259000	Oh, hold on!
1259000	1260000	Wait, I just bet
1260000	1261000	if you run ahead of the horse,
1261000	1262000	you can actually get the horse
1262000	1263000	first time in the tutorial section.
1263000	1264000	Keep running, keep running,
1264000	1265000	keep running.
1265000	1266000	And then if you're Prince Pampi,
1266000	1267000	beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
1267000	1268000	aw, we missed it.
1268000	1269000	You can get it
1269000	1270000	first time in this tutorial section.
1271000	1272000	I'll open up
1272000	1273000	the stream elements
1273000	1274000	so I can see he just tipped.
1276000	1277000	Oh, my God.
1277000	1278000	This frickin' horse
1278000	1279000	he always jumps around.
1279000	1280000	Get on the...
1280000	1281000	Okay, there we go.
1281000	1282000	Horsespeed Tubers,
1282000	1283000	dominated.
1283000	1284000	Check.
1284000	1285000	Ta-da!
1285000	1286000	But you can't do that.
1287000	1289000	World record pace ruined.
1291000	1292000	Wait, so did you guys
1292000	1293000	hear any notification
1294000	1295000	of that tip?
1296000	1297000	I need to go read it.
1297000	1298000	Hold on.
1298000	1299000	Oh, my game paused!
1299000	1300000	Oh, my God.
1300000	1301000	Such a professional streamer,
1301000	1302000	by the way.
1302000	1303000	Stream elements.
1304000	1305000	Okay, stream elements,
1305000	1306000	sign in.
1307000	1308000	We hear it.
1308000	1309000	You don't.
1309000	1310000	I did hear it.
1310000	1311000	Oh, you heard it.
1311000	1312000	Was it loud?
1312000	1313000	I need to turn it down.
1315000	1316000	Oh, no!
1316000	1317000	I don't have my login
1317000	1318000	for stream elements.
1319000	1320000	I can connect it
1320000	1321000	to my YouTube.
1323000	1324000	Management that connected
1324000	1325000	to my YouTube?
1325000	1326000	Or is it...
1326000	1327000	No, wait,
1327000	1328000	that doesn't sound right.
1328000	1329000	No, it should be connected
1329000	1330000	to YouTube.
1330000	1331000	Stream elements should be
1331000	1332000	connected to YouTube.
1332000	1333000	Yes.
1333000	1334000	Yes.
1334000	1335000	Okay.
1335000	1336000	If the stream goes down,
1336000	1337000	it's because I'm a fanny.
1338000	1339000	Full stop.
1339000	1340000	That is the same.
1341000	1342000	Uh...
1342000	1343000	Uh...
1343000	1344000	Can I...
1346000	1347000	Hey!
1348000	1349000	Wait.
1352000	1353000	Uh...
1353000	1354000	Wait a minute.
1356000	1357000	Uh...
1357000	1358000	Right!
1358000	1359000	Why is it showing me
1359000	1360000	people subscribed
1360000	1361000	to the YouTube channel?
1361000	1362000	Terrible.
1362000	1363000	Well, it's good that you subscribe,
1363000	1364000	but it's clogging up
1364000	1366000	the frickin' thing.
1367000	1368000	Right.
1368000	1369000	Save.
1369000	1370000	I see it!
1370000	1372000	I see tips!
1373000	1374000	I see snowpots as well.
1374000	1375000	Ta-ha.
1375000	1376000	Get it?
1376000	1377000	Anyway, sorry.
1377000	1378000	Thank you so much.
1378000	1379000	6.9.
1379000	1381000	Assassin's Creed Battle Hood.
1381000	1383000	Thanks for playing this game.
1383000	1384000	Uh...
1384000	1385000	Why are you re-thinking me?
1385000	1386000	This is literally my favorite game.
1386000	1387000	Uh...
1387000	1388000	Someone called Bajinga
1388000	1389000	works now.
1389000	1390000	Okay.
1390000	1391000	Congratulations for the four.
1391000	1392000	Thank you for the tips.
1392000	1393000	I really appreciate it.
1393000	1394000	Uh...
1394000	1395000	Right, okay.
1395000	1396000	Straight back into the fun
1396000	1397000	with just...
1397000	1398000	You spend as much time in battle
1398000	1399000	as your Uncle Mal.
1400000	1402000	My battles have already won.
1402000	1403000	I see.
1403000	1404000	That is good news.
1404000	1405000	Arrivederci has...
1405000	1406000	Arrivederci!
1408000	1409000	Sorry.
1409000	1410000	Are you squirming me right now?
1410000	1411000	Right.
1411000	1412000	So, you're like...
1412000	1413000	So, the next objective
1413000	1414000	is up there
1414000	1415000	and you'll be sitting yourself.
1415000	1416000	Uh...
1416000	1417000	I am gonna have to really
1417000	1418000	annoyingly
1418000	1419000	walk up all these buildings,
1419000	1420000	climb them up.
1420000	1421000	Eh, no.
1421000	1422000	The game is kind enough
1422000	1424000	to give you these sandbags.
1424000	1426000	Up the sandbags you go.
1427000	1428000	Right.
1428000	1430000	Why can I not hear notifications?

1655400	1658840	Joe Mikar I'll read it over after the sections
1661160	1663160	I believe it
1663160	1667360	Can I tell you a sad story actually really cried like I cried squid me right now?
1667840	1669640	Hey
1669640	1673440	Right, I'll read the the random Italian this person thinks I could think I can see
1691600	1693600	Thank you for listening to my Italian
1693600	1695600	Oh
1695760	1698660	El car yes, well, I gotta give
1699320	1704200	To compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way. How many times did you play the game to know it so well?
1705800	1710920	The answer is I actually couldn't even count how many times I've played this game
1713280	1715280	No, anything killing us is that breath
1719280	1721280	Take a drink of war
1723960	1728720	Did you saw my mother in Italian? Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves about this game
1729440	1733120	The freaking cannons. So you see how the hit markers there?
1733120	1738480	It looks like you're gonna hit it and the cannons are like way loud in this game. They're like far too loud
1739280	1741280	They're insanely loud
1742560	1744720	My my foul-ass breath
1745960	1750560	The guy sounds like a Skyrim guard most video games reuse
1751160	1755520	Voice actors, so you will recognize people over and over again
1755520	1761160	It's very common if you work in a video game that you will be used for NPCs for example
1762080	1770200	Or just miscellaneous characters all the time very common Skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors
1770200	1772200	Being used over and over again
1773080	1779040	Other than Cicero and Skyrim shout out to Cicero and Skyrim can't remember the actual guy's name
1779160	1781160	But goodness greatly
1783160	1787920	He said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented. Maybe you can teach me a beautiful
1788960	1794160	Wait, you can't even speak English and you like my accent, bro. You're gonna be in for a shock
1796680	1801360	My favorite oblivion line. Oh, let me retake that. Let me redo that in the left in the game
1801480	1806640	Okay, we have now just finished all our three side missions. We have just handled the cannons. Hmm suspicious
1806640	1812640	I wonder why we have also been able to ride a horse. That's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very
1813840	1815840	Necessary to X
1816040	1821400	To explore certain locations and it's just not possible on foot is partly you can do it
1821400	1823400	but it just takes up so much time and
1823960	1830320	We also help the lady which established that it's a auditory is a bit of a bit of a ladies man
1830320	1834760	And he's out for ladies holes. I mean we're all out for the ladies hole at the end of the day
1835600	1837600	Hey, hold
1837760	1839760	This is outrageous
1840520	1843020	By Zura by Zura by Zura
1845400	1849680	There are two major hubs of English voice actors to go from
1850640	1854720	So this is Katarina sports. She is a real person
1855920	1860160	Did occur a very badass personality
1862200	1864200	Based on a real person
1865440	1869360	We're like Katarina do Fanny cuz we're getting her
1871880	1873880	That's her mummy
1874920	1878040	That's Marquia Valley recurring character
1883320	1887400	I wish I could show you the magic she performed very good
1895600	1898040	Moving painting of the goddess Minerva spoke
1899200	1902480	Don't have a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future
1903280	1906560	Give hope of lost temple that will provide a to humanity
1907960	1912160	Then she called out to a phantom desmond as if you were there
1915240	1917960	After her warning she vanished
1917960	1919960	I
1920840	1922840	Cannot imagine such wonders
1923840	1927600	Did not house the terrible wet food fear this is good news
1930240	1934720	Did she appear human yes, but her words proved otherwise
1935600	1942880	All of her kind died many years ago. I wish I could show you the magic she performed all of the good delivery good delivery
1943760	1946240	Where are these temples Minerva spoke up?
1947040	1950400	Do not know perhaps we must search for them
1951320	1957800	Tell me how it ended for you did Rodrigo beg forgiveness. Make excuses from his power
1958840	1964120	No, none of those things the script pulled off another one. I got you pulled up another
1967400	1971160	Just watching the mirror on her the spaniards
1972040	1974040	Oh
1975680	1977680	Some of the voicelines are a bit goofy
1996480	1998600	Damn straight you don't come Mario here real one
2001160	2003160	That's me your uncle Mary
2009360	2015640	Maria auditory as your mummy big mummy kins. Did you know actually that's a bit sad
2015640	2023360	Maybe not and we'll just continue to the next part of the sequence. Oh, right ready everyone group session right now everyone get out
2023480	2032000	Not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on
2036280	2038120	Wait for it wait for it
2038120	2042000	See this is what happens when you pay for the premium pass at the VL or meet and greet booth
2042400	2048120	You're presented with a bathtub and then this part is me. That's you okay. That's you in the bathtub. This next bit is me
2050120	2052120	Yeah
2053360	2056160	Oh, this for a hundred dollars for the premium pass. Yes, please
2057600	2059600	Coming at you in my bikini

2068720	2070720	Mom is
2084120	2089040	Do you think a con we would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious
2090320	2092720	Forgot about that part of the scene. Oh, oh
2093600	2097960	Like what happens in the ASMR booth stays in the ASMR booth everyone sh okay
2100240	2107080	Fun fact I played this game in front of my mom and she was mortified at this scene because I was very very young
2107720	2112600	And I remember playing it at midnight and I had the dining room chair in front of the TV
2113360	2115360	My mom let me play it on the big TV
2116240	2120640	And she was like, what are you playing now? Like it's a sad that's great
2121760	2124760	Mom, please. I didn't make the game
2127760	2132800	One should always have the freedom to choose. Oh so salty so salty
2132800	2145200	Yeah, damn train and exercise is out of control
2149680	2151680	Put in the ass
2154880	2157040	Actually, that's another side note
2157040	2159240	I remember why my dad needed to spell
2159560	2163320	Oh, I was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years back now
2163480	2168520	He was like, how do you spell assassin? I was like ass ass in and we both looked at each other like that shrek meme like
2169400	2171400	Like burst out laughing
2173080	2175080	Such children honestly
2180040	2184840	I'm not I'm not gonna lie if I felt like that my ankles would be gone. They would be dust
2185640	2195240	Okay, this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can do everything right and the game will still fail you
2197960	2199960	So Mario has the apple of Eden
2210920	2214440	The one Italian like oh my god, she really likes assassins
2214920	2216920	My goodness
2217960	2223400	Uh to say help and uh, oh no, we lost our monies. It's not about the money money money
2224600	2227000	Forget about the money money money
2227960	2233240	Uh, you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence
2233240	2235240	So
2240680	2246360	The entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and I'm currently singing that one Scottish song
2251560	2253960	All the horses get back up in this video game
2253960	2257960	I just what for anyone who doesn't like when the horses go down and with you with that
2258520	2261960	The horses always stand back up in video in this video game
2261960	2265960	No horse ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt la la la la
2266760	2269640	Okay, this is the part I hate you can destroy
2270200	2275880	All the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can fail the section
2276200	2278200	I have done it consecutively
2278440	2281160	All you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore everything else
2281160	2285400	But the freaking it's really hard to tell. Yeah, see I should have hit that third one
2285480	2291000	But it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your
2292200	2296440	Area of effect if you will and my goodness gravy it's frustrating
2299080	2302600	No horses were harmed in the production of this video game. No, they're not so
2303080	2305080	Please don't worry. All horses get back up
2306760	2312600	The aoe area of effect is it's so freaking hard to tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like
2312600	2314600	I should have three but yeah
2315480	2317960	And especially the ones on the hill this oh
2318600	2320600	Beautiful beautiful
2320920	2326600	Do that again Hen do it again do it again do it again. Give us three. Oh, baby
2327800	2331160	Right, so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed this one
2332200	2334200	Boom, baby
2336680	2341400	Okay, next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can fail
2342360	2348200	The problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons. Oh triple, baby
2348600	2353960	Let's go three for three. Obviously. We can't do it for this one because it's not third, but we've got three for three so far
2357000	2361000	Okay, wait what that one survived. Hello
2361720	2363720	Uh
2365160	2367160	Use me excuse a moi
2368440	2370360	Do my eyes
2370360	2373160	So this is the problem. You can't really hit those ones
2373640	2377800	Now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing. I've forgotten what their legal name is
2378680	2380680	But the big brown thing doesn't count
2382120	2384120	Uh, we can kill it. We've done what we can
2384520	2390120	So either we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10
2390680	2391720	five
2391720	2396280	We did it. We didn't get a ballista a siege tower. I
2399560	2401560	Soldiers are climbing the walls
2402520	2405160	Okay, this is one bit. I don't like about this game. You ready for this
2405960	2411880	They change your weapons. So they've given me a sword. I've said, uh, let me keep my blade out because
2412280	2414280	I prefer fighting with a blade the only
2414840	2418920	Enemies that you're not to go against with the blade jump down. Oh, jeez
2419480	2422040	Yeah, my ankles would be disintegrated if I did that
2422920	2424200	um
2424200	2426840	It's much easier to fight with the blades. Oh my god
2427720	2434760	He just curbstomped that borgia guy. Did you see that encio? That's a war crime. You can't curbstomp people
2435640	2437640	That's not how it works
2438200	2440200	Jesus etio
2440440	2442280	Okay, hold on
2442280	2446840	These enemies. Oh my god, I just got twatted. Oh, I'm getting twat twice. Sorry. I'm too busy trying to be chatting
2447480	2452840	Kill at the same time. Um, no, I'm missing. Oh, no, everyone's gonna know I'm a terrible gamer
2454200	2459640	Um, the only enemies that are not effective. So like these guys for fuck's sake
2460040	2464840	They freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming. It's not a problem
2464920	2468920	Again, you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out boom
2469720	2473960	It didn't register it. See, oh, he's getting a bit close mate. You're gonna need to aim
2476520	2478520	That was kind of it close for comfort
2480840	2486440	Point blank etio that probably wasn't even five meters. No been do we need to put glicks on them?
2492200	2494200	Oh, this is a sad bit
2498920	2500920	Of assassins
2517160	2521000	This is an invitation my family to yours
2521000	2523000	I
2536040	2538040	Like that part
2541240	2548200	There is a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for us keep that in mind
2548520	2554120	I can walk faster means to stop in Italian
2557800	2559800	So we are now
2560680	2565560	Basically running on fumes adrenaline wise. We've literally just been absolutely
2566600	2569880	Destroyed we have three bullet wins. I think shoulder
2570520	2575960	Uh abdomen. Oh, okay. Just to show we've got two bullet wins. I could have sworn it used to be three
2575960	2578520	But I'm probably just wish me remember being
2579480	2586760	Uh, but yeah, we've literally our liver is currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow. What happened there?
2589000	2594440	Did you see me get turned into that rubbish pile? I was like liquid. Did you see that?
2596440	2600600	Ouch, I don't want to be jelly. Please don't turn me into jelly
2602600	2604760	Hey leaf cloudia lonia bam
2606200	2612840	So you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence, but they all do they all are aggressive towards you
2613560	2616680	You can clean them up if you really desire
2616920	2623320	But if the arrow is red that means the ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack
2624120	2628360	Oh, also the guards have assassin abilities. Look how he's sitting on the wall
2628920	2635880	The coding in this game is a bit funny. Um, if you upset NPCs, they turn into assassins and start climbing walls
2635960	2637400	and stuff
2637400	2642360	You could always break a guard stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them
2643000	2646760	But we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly. Um
2647880	2653880	But yeah, uh, you can ignore all these I think and just go straight in here. No you can't
2654360	2659320	You have to wait until they're assigned to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. The game does it quite often where it won't
2660920	2662440	Let you in
2662440	2664680	If someone is target locked onto you
2666280	2670520	Hey, come on Claudio ain't go all day. Jesus. We're under a siege. Take your time hen
2671880	2675640	Ezio, I'm in here. I will hold the back. Stop wait for us
2676200	2681400	We thought you had to kill sir Ezio. Not yet. Where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls?
2681400	2686520	Are you surprised it exists? I might have to open my door. Um, I must go help the troops
2686920	2689880	My freaking room is getting so hot with this computer
2689880	2691880	Ah
2693400	2700440	I'm coming. So we're currently inside the Auditori villa. We're now going down down down down deep inside
2701560	2704120	Down deep inside see how do you pick me?
2707080	2713800	I'm sweating um, I'm sitting on my sweaty feet right now. I don't know how you guys sit in your chairs, but I sit on my feet
2714120	2716120	Oh
2717640	2722520	We will play Assassin's Creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in Assassin's Creed 2
2723080	2727400	We're essentially playing Assassin's Creed 2.5. It's fine brotherhood's good game
2729000	2733800	Right lore lore. I'm gonna take a war sip water sipping then take a sip with me if you're not got war
2744760	2746760	Oh
2755080	2757080	The horse was a paid actor
2760520	2764040	I'm not flexible enough to sit on your feet. I'll make you flexible once I've done me
2765880	2767880	Sorry
2768360	2770360	Hmm
2771960	2773960	We're actually speedrunning
2774680	2780280	Just love this game all over everything about it. The patience fantastic. We've completed sequence dna one
2781800	2783800	Battle wounds achievement unlocked
2788120	2790120	Lucy, I can't seem to get a position
2792040	2794600	Poe could one of you tell me what's going on
2795160	2796600	Sorry
2796600	2801160	I will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now
2802680	2804680	But only at the end
2805160	2807160	Right, so that says in present day
2809320	2811320	Congrats if your name's Desmond
2812600	2814600	Congrats
2814680	2818360	Congrats if your name's Sean Sean's one with glasses. Congrats
2818680	2821800	I'm convinced we need to get our hands on Ezio's apple of Eden
2822360	2825640	Minerva altered it somehow when she are the tame traveling
2826120	2830280	We're at the Alti Torre Zilla. I will tell you in a second. It's our last safe, but we were present day
2830520	2832520	It turns out the Templars are watching the border
2833160	2838520	Ezio hid the poe sometime in 1507, but when I try to access that dna sequence
2839160	2842040	He seems to be remembering something else
2843160	2846200	Like a memory inside a memory. Yes, exactly
2846920	2852280	Maybe exactly maybe I believe you experienced something similar back at obstaga, didn't you?
2852520	2857080	Subject 15 exhibited memory within memory like patterns, but she was pregnant
2857640	2860520	The memories of prego's father and mother not in this was
2861320	2863320	Desmond's not pregnant
2864280	2868280	Oh my god, we've just been fat shamed in 2024
2869720	2875320	You guys remember when Bal got that model and she was like inflated and someone was like
2876040	2880280	This is fat shaming. I was like, no, bro. That's real 34 open your eyes
2884120	2889480	That's crazy that either that or rebecca's is not a very good engineer. Thanks asshole
2891880	2895880	Imagine coming out with an inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming. No mother fucker
2905560	2912920	Ages ago the waves go through everything above brown. They're gonna find us. No, they aren't come with me
2923320	2925320	Oh
2928200	2933320	There's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead, but I'll try and for those who don't know the game I will very quickly summarize
2933400	2935640	From the inside we're not getting in this way
2936280	2941480	What's her next move the road just moves back into the highway. This is not a good place for us to be right now
2941720	2946920	Do we have any tarps? We need to cover up the van. I really hate to stress this yeah, but we are running out of time
2947960	2951400	That's Sean. We'll help us. That's Rebecca. That's Lucy any ideas?
2952200	2957160	I don't know. Maybe there's another way into the sanctuary. Hey, I think I've got something
2957480	2963560	Okay, so we're modern-day Desmond if you don't know the game
2963960	2966680	Uh, we basically have a special bloodline
2967960	2969960	That commutes to the gods that created us
2970360	2977320	Um, and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go back in the past very fictional based. Uh, I
2978200	2982520	Absolutely loved the concept when I was a child and I wanted it to be so real
2984040	2986280	I was like take me back to the battle of anaconda
2987560	2989560	Take me to big willy walrus
2990440	2992440	I want to see the construction
3003320	3006200	So we are like the trunk. I'm sorry. I don't know what the trunks are
3007400	3012680	Memories are stored in DNA. Yes. That's the quickest way. Oh my god me and Lucy
3017880	3019880	Oh
3026040	3028760	Oh, yeah, you know how to have fun you'll have fun with me the night Lucy
3036760	3042920	Okay, there we go. Oh, that was a loading screen by the way, it looked like it wasn't they were trying to hide it
3043160	3045160	What was that?
3045480	3051960	So Desmond also sees the past because his it's basically leaking into his present
3052840	3055400	So Lucy can't see any of this we can see this
3060440	3066440	They escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack I can see them now
3067800	3072200	I know it's difficult, but try to compartmentalize focus on the present
3072600	3074600	What if I can't stop the visions?
3074760	3077000	How long before I start painting symbols on the walls?
3077640	3083640	Don't joke about that. Subject 16 had the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself
3084200	3086520	But we learned more about him in Assassin's Creed 3
3092200	3094200	Well the animus he does to a man
3096040	3101640	Please do not refer to the animus that lets us go back into the past is the animus
3103080	3105080	Oh
3108120	3112920	Is a revelation not unless you want me to end up like that skeleton always
3114120	3116120	I'll find a way around
3116280	3119640	Always revelations, you're right. Sorry, my apologies. I apologize
3121800	3124600	I would say this is a revelation
3125240	3129720	Do you guys remember Dan bull's cover of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood revelations?
3130280	3132920	I meant if you see any
3135640	3138520	So we are now backtracking our way of sort
3140440	3143960	This is the problem. There's so much dialogue in this game at the start
3144440	3147720	And we are now backtracking trying to get back inside the villa
3151000	3153560	Oh no, Claudia, that's our sister
3160440	3165480	Just joined. Why is he wearing jeans? We're in present day. Actually. Yeah, could you jump about in jeans?
3167160	3171160	I don't even wear jeans. I don't even wear clothes after time actually
3172440	3176440	Do you want to guess what clothes I'm wearing right now? Because it's not what you think
3180840	3182840	Okay
3184520	3186520	We are selling tutorials, so it's a bit slow, but
3189720	3191720	Okay
3192120	3195480	Um, I just wear a bra and a hoodie
3196600	3202280	That's it. So my bear arms is on my game and chair right now with my sweaty feet as well
3203400	3208680	They never stop sweating neither do my hands. My hands are very sweaty right now actually, but they don't sweat as much as my feet
3208760	3211000	I'm sorry. I don't I don't think I don't care. I'll show up about that
3214440	3216280	Oh my marriage
3216360	3220920	Oh, I have marriage oopsies forgot to talk about that. I have marriage if you want to support me
3221160	3225080	I'm getting key chains with the girls and we're I'm going to make a little key chain ASMR
3231800	3236440	So the thing about this cutscene you have no health so you can literally just do that
3237240	3240280	You can't die in this cutscene in this section of the game
3241400	3243880	It's not a cutscene. It's a section again. You can just drop down
3247240	3249400	When did this become I wish I wish you
3254120	3256120	Nice try ready
3259400	3263560	God well, do you see such a skinny legend on this one found a switch
3266360	3269800	Oh, no, no don't do that. That's morey. Here we go
3273400	3275400	Something's open
3275800	3277800	Yeah, my leg. Hey, yo
3280520	3282520	Absolutely brain
3285320	3287320	So he shouldn't have said this line yet because
3288200	3289320	Oh
3289320	3292520	I've never had that happen before I got pushed out the way by the shadow
3293880	3299160	Oh my god, I've never had that happen before the shadows are freaking I wonder if you can attack the shadow
3300760	3302920	I've never been pushed out the way by the shadow before
3303640	3310040	See this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic
3311000	3313240	Anyway, we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste
3316200	3318200	The game's being coded as you play
3320600	3324200	Toxic waste it was Lucy's idea
3324200	3326200	Oh
3327720	3328840	You're exaggerating
3328840	3335000	Whoa, whoa, uh, see when the camera angle start to shift it actually makes things like really hard to judge
3335320	3337320	It's good for the skin
3338200	3340920	Remember the that one post where that guy was like
3342040	3348920	For $500 let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was like, oh you're
3349800	3351240	I mean
3351240	3353240	Yeah, that was quite the post
3354440	3356440	Wait
3357000	3359000	You're going so fast the game can't keep up
3360600	3362600	That was minging honest
3368360	3373960	Oh my god, it's you no it's you Desmond. Did you just ask a woman why she's not wet?
3374680	3377320	That's sexual harassment, honestly water check
3380280	3382280	Oh, I just fell water. Oh well, it's fine
3383240	3389560	I'm sorry. It like cold water just went on my leg and I'm like, ah, you know, that's fine. It's actually not that big a deal
3392680	3395800	Jesus, you know, that's brutal making someone fall to their death
3398040	3400520	Now I'm wet. I'm a cuttlefish. I was wet from the start
3405240	3411000	Human resources. Why is septic tank? It's just what the guy wanted. It's like that Japanese post
3411720	3415240	Oh, this is another thing. There is this is a true
3415720	3417080	hashtag
3417080	3418120	story
3418120	3419480	and
3419480	3422920	So this wife went away on holiday for the weekend
3423880	3426200	And her neighbor on Friday
3427160	3429800	went into her like toilet tank
3430680	3433640	Like Japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done
3433880	3438280	So he could look up and peep at her while she disintegrated basically
3438840	3442680	Um and because she went away on holiday, uh, that man
3443320	3444920	perished
3444920	3445960	via
3445960	3448440	I'm freezing to death in kaka
3449080	3451080	I was like, bro
3451560	3454120	Don't get me wrong. I'm no really
3455320	3458280	Shame in anyone for what they like, but to die
3459640	3460680	To die
3460680	3462680	I'll wait here. It's a bit extreme
3463560	3465560	It's a bit extreme
3466280	3469160	Oh g-san messed up on that one. I'm not gonna lie. Oh g-san
3471160	3473160	Yeah
3476760	3479800	Did they scatter his ashes?
3481080	3485800	That's too funny that I can't even laugh at that. That's awful. That's awful
3488360	3491160	Oh my god, that was so quick-witted
3491960	3493960	Damn
3494280	3494840	Thanks
3494840	3500120	Anyway, the sequence is just teaching us the relationship that et-sio has with lucy
3500680	3503800	Ed Desmond has with lucy jesus. I have the bleeding effect myself
3504440	3509480	No, no before you freaking take that out of context. The bleeding effect is when Desmond thingy's
3510280	3515720	Oh, uh, Veechabur's stomach is sore. It must mean they're they're just a ketchup packet. No
3517000	3519960	Stop it with the ketchup packet allegations. Okay
3520760	3523160	Veechabur's can't beat them enough. My goodness
3525080	3532440	Veechabur feels mildly ill. Oh, she must be a ketchup packet. You stop that right now naughty naughty
3533640	3535640	Stop it
3541800	3545720	It's all right, I'm a mustard pat it comes out yellow. Hello
3545720	3549240	Oh, should I be worried? Do we need to get you a doctor?
3554920	3559320	When the past memories and new ones melt in yes Desmond has a very hard time
3559880	3566200	Differentiating himself from et-sio because he spends so much time in the animus as et-sio. I mean you'd do it too
3567320	3571720	You'd do it too. You'd do it too. All right friendly over the section
3572360	3575080	Oh my god, it's the back of the statue
3577160	3581160	Repeat after me stat you that's how you say statue in scots stat you
3582520	3584520	No tea stat you
3586200	3588200	Oh, I guess there is a tea technical
3592760	3596680	Well, I'm as if you die in the animus and you just perish
3598680	3600680	No tea I've finished
3602360	3604680	Wow weapon ice gets free
3606920	3608920	True
3612760	3615080	Et-sio must have come back here way after the attack
3616440	3618040	But why
3618040	3620040	Desmond
3620280	3627240	Desmond let's open that door. I think big dizzy. Here's like, hmm big easy big as you all the touring
3627640	3636280	You have any fizzy juice, no, I might get a cola later, but right now I'm I'm high. I'm high is okay
3636360	3641080	I'm literally playing my favorite game of all time. I'm allowed to just word vomit and do whatever I please
3642120	3648440	Life is good. Bruv. Bruv. Life is good. I'm happy. I hope you know this experience is enjoyable
3648600	3651800	Don't apologize about burps. I don't burp much with water, but hey
3652760	3657960	Can you open the damn bookcase Desmond says Sean as I cut over his voiceline
3660280	3664120	Yes, et-sio has three things
3665560	3669720	Assassin's Creed to Assassin's Creed brotherhood and Assassin's Creed revelations are all et-sio elder towards storyline
3674120	3676760	Numbers Mason. Oh my god, we need to play black ops
3677720	3679720	In 1421
3680760	3685320	Oh my head, are we? That's all right Desmond has a boo boo
3695000	3697000	Let's get the animus down there

3714920	3716920	What is that smell?
3716920	3721080	It's my clothes. It was Lucy's idea. I smell like you swam through a sewer
3722440	3728200	It was Lucy's idea. It was Lucy's idea. Wait a second guys. You need to remember the there's a line right?
3728200	3730760	Is that confliction in his voice going? That's the word

3748680	3751320	Obviously, I'm happy to talk about like some behind the scenes stuff
3751640	3754520	But like they were kind of shocked that I'm like, yeah, just do what you want
3754840	3757240	Like whatever you want go for it. You can say what you want
3757240	3761480	Obviously, as long as you don't see any nda content, you can talk about the interview with me if you want
3761480	3763480	You can talk about how you found the process
3764120	3766120	Talk about how you found debut
3766120	3771160	Um, yeah, just do what you want and have fun. I'm here to be a booty hole
3772920	3775800	Right look around Montoregioni for circuitless
3775800	3780600	That little dude asked they'll re-wrote small amounts of electricity to the power line underneath the villa
3781000	3784200	Don't ask me how they work if I understood that I wouldn't be the fellow hide in the van
3784440	3786440	I
3787000	3789000	Used to think
3789000	3791000	He is he Wheatley?
3791720	3794280	I think he might be Wheatley. I'm not sure from
3795080	3795880	a
3795880	3797880	portal to
3798280	3803960	So we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus underneath the villa
3804760	3812120	In order for upstairs go the big baddies are called upstairs go in this game or templates. Those are the big baddies
3812920	3815160	Um, so basically you just need to go around the city
3815160	3819240	You can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago
3819880	3823960	That the big old fights were occurring. I really like stacey milk. Yeah
3826120	3829800	I saw the reaction to fondle a bosom
3831640	3837560	Admit that it was funny. Okay. Admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now
3838040	3844360	And anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars. Okay fondle a bosom was hilarious. I don't care

3860680	3861560	like
3861560	3868600	Cuttles cuttlefish. Okay, so any cuttles. Let's go. Uh, a polar bear. Okay. I see I see still pause. Yes. She has pause
3869160	3871160	And she's cold. I see stop us. Let's go
3871640	3873640	Like it's really it's not that bad
3874040	3878920	Um, so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense of moving around. Um
3879880	3886120	And all that jazz there's like one right next to me. Isn't there yet? It's right behind me. Uh box
3887080	3889080	I vana humpullo
3889240	3890600	Hey
3890600	3896200	That was not a name karambi. No karambi for like a cs gov each of her
3896760	3899800	Perfect name. Don't care karambit. Yes
3900520	3904120	And karam sounds like haram so you can probably make a few puns
3907320	3909320	Yes, it's booted
3909800	3913560	Name from money python's life of brian incontinent above
3913960	3919000	African saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot
3919240	3923960	I was like, oh no, they've got me laughing. I was like, oh, that was actually really funny
3924760	3925880	All right, we're going in the animus
3925880	3930840	We're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory if we're still in the tutorial stage
3930840	3935240	I will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage. Uh, we've still probably got another hour and a bit
3936360	3938360	sanctuary
3939320	3945480	As you may have noticed in the van, I've made some improvements to the animus and have a new vr training program
3946840	3950360	Here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors
3950920	3952600	Let me open one in the mission
3952600	3954120	AC show
3954120	3955800	AC hall
3955800	3960920	Okay, but it doesn't make sense. Maybe if we had like a fire and ace like v tripper just saying ac
3961160	3967000	No, we can't like call ac. We already have ac. Oh, oh shit. Okay. So this is the virtual training. I despise it
3967000	3969000	I absolutely despise it
3969720	3975560	I just cannot stand this section. It's for people who enjoy the combat or practicing it me
3976120	3981320	I hate it. I despise it. Okay. You see that skinny guard? He is a problem
3982360	3988840	They can grab you. Yeah, see the guards are trying to grab me and then it breaks your streak if they grab you and so annoying
3989560	3996520	I freaking hate the we guards. Honestly. Oh, and I hate the Lancers too. I absolutely hate it. I'm much better in combat
3996600	3998600	Yeah, fuck you. Take it
3999000	4003560	Take it the Lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter
4003640	4009320	So when you're on a killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically
4011480	4013480	Skinny ball bad guards. Oh, honestly
4014040	4018360	Lancer hates the skinny guards hate because they are agile warriors
4018840	4023320	And you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly
4024200	4027240	Shrimp check. Yep posture still shrimp. Thank you
4029320	4032280	Oh, we're in the tutorial for like another two hours
4032680	4037960	But the reason I'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial
4040440	4047080	You progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like I know that sounds silly to praise that because obviously all games work like that but
4048520	4050520	I'll kind of
4053720	4055720	You can leave the machine whenever you like
4056520	4058520	I'm all set to go. Don't worry
4059720	4063560	One last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing events
4063960	4065800	repressed memories
4065800	4070520	You might even discover some repressed memories. She be caught in bottom. Okay, let's get started
4076040	4079640	Ass and feet locked on that seat. Oh, that's actually a really good like model
4080440	4082440	Ready for like an eight hour stream
4082920	4084920	Ass and feet get on that suit
4087000	4093560	Anyway, I never expected you to see you play something. I have terrible news, but these should personally play a video game
4097800	4099800	Subjects, dude
4105240	4107240	Okay, we're here present day
4107640	4115400	Give me one second. I'm gonna get a cola. Okay, I'll leave it on so I'm least I'm not yapping over the actual cutscenes for once
4115400	4117400	Oh
4138920	4143880	Sorry, I forget my hip. I need to close my eyes if I walk away so the sleep thing clicks on right but
4144840	4147960	Come on me. Come on me. Oh my god. Listen to the music
4159800	4161800	Beautiful
4166920	4168920	Oh gorgeous
4170520	4172520	Roma
4174600	4176600	Yes
4178280	4180280	I just got chills
4180520	4183720	Such an idiot. I just love this game so much
4187560	4193720	I just feel like so full of it like my heart feels so full. I get to share this game and
4194840	4199560	Just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010
4200200	4206040	And it aged beautifully. I will not tell I will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well
4206440	4213480	So we're currently injured and going to the doctor. We're about to learn about health bar. So we're still injured
4213560	4215240	We're still hurt
4215240	4219400	In the top left corner. We have five health squares and only one left
4220600	4224360	That is how we deal with health in the game. Do not take that horse
4224440	4226760	I don't know why they put that horse there unironically
4227400	4229800	You don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer
4233000	4237400	Trying to tip you it says internal server. It's okay. You don't have to give me money. Just hanging out. It's fine
4238360	4240360	Hey, I'm not sure about the problem is but hey
4241160	4243160	But don't worry. You don't have to give me money. Thank you very much
4245400	4247800	For a man of your age. Tisk, tisk
4257000	4259000	Four out of five doctors would suggest leeches
4260920	4262920	No leeches
4262920	4265800	However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the sea
4266600	4268600	Do you need anything else?
4269320	4275560	Have fun at work. Don't worry guys. If you ever have to leave stream. I am an endurance streamer. I'm not very friendly
4277000	4282840	Long time streamer. Um, I do plan on streaming for eight hours or finishing the
4283800	4291720	Story mode of this game and tomorrow we will 100% it because I've never 100% of the game before but with your
4292440	4297080	Encouragement, I think it's possible. I think I could 100% this game
4297560	4300920	When you collect all the board your tower like the flags
4301480	4302840	um
4302840	4307560	All the hidden flags that are also in the halls of nero, which I will teach you all about very shortly
4307960	4309160	So this
4309160	4315640	Beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD. Okay, they're all hidden at the moment
4315640	4318440	But we are going to be doing map update as you can see
4319240	4322840	Uh synchronized view points beauty beauty beauty
4324840	4329560	It talks on you. I'm listening at work. Oh my god. Oh, those are the naughty naughty
4331720	4333720	Stinky borgia
4334360	4341320	We don't like borgia. We don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borgia
4343720	4349480	100% in this game in two days possible. Yes, sir with autism anything is possible
4350200	4353240	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I apologize
4355560	4356920	Um
4356920	4361400	I am very passionate about what I'm passionate about and if I am like unable to do so
4361480	4365960	So ie I can just straight up like play this game the way I want to then yes
4366360	4369400	We're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one
4369960	4375560	I'm so sorry. It must be like really weird. Just randomly come out with it. I'll
4377000	4383480	We'll refer to the strontism. How about that? So we're currently tailing. Do you see the yellow hit marker or hitbox above these?
4383720	4386440	This is tailing. It means do not be discovered by them
4387000	4391800	They can be pushed by NPCs so they can turn around and look at you. It's not um
4393240	4397160	It's not the best but it certainly works perfectly well
4400280	4402200	It's absolutely beautiful game
4402200	4408120	So we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards unless an NPC kindly bumps into them
4408440	4411320	So we can get as close as we want. We can like creep on the walls
4411400	4414440	Cece he just turned around there if I wasn't creeping on the wall
4414520	4418440	Even the game's like uh, you should maintain your distance. You're a bit too close, but we can like creep
4418440	4420440	Creeping
4436280	4440760	Okay, and you can also blend in but I am not controlling the movement of this crowd
4440840	4445400	The crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered
4445720	4449640	While concealed in a crown like this guards can walk by me
4449720	4453640	I can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as long as I am
4455800	4458360	100% in the achievements in skyrim, sorry
4458360	4464040	I don't mean 100% in skyrim because that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors
4464600	4467720	The achievements I have 100% at skyrim achievements
4468280	4473480	Uh multiple times and I would absolutely love to share the experience with you and tell you about all the secret
4474200	4476200	little bits I know
4477800	4479800	And yeah, okay
4480200	4483640	I'm also going to mention the multiplayer and brotherhood. I believe the servers are down
4484360	4490200	Okay. Oh, whoa. That just came out nowhere. Hold on. Hold on. We weren't even at the we were not even at the section
4490840	4492840	Okay, we didn't even go
4493480	4494440	We were
4494440	4497480	And see I didn't kill civilians. Did I kill a human?
4498440	4500280	Like a non-guard
4500280	4502040	What is going on?
4502040	4506440	Oh my god, sorry. The sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase
4506760	4511240	It's supposed to start by the freaking did I kill him if I'm a citizen?
4512600	4514600	Uh
4517880	4521640	What just happened? I think I was too distracted. I apologize
4522600	4525720	But don't worry. We can always replay and come back for 100%
4526120	4528120	I can't believe I just killed a citizen
4528920	4531320	I never make that mistake in this game
4533000	4535000	Sorry
4544040	4546040	I too have lost family to the rope
4552440	4557080	Treachery you called you cuddled off
4563000	4565000	When you are what the fuck go down
4565720	4569480	Sorry, you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen
4570200	4573880	I was like, these are too many things going on right now. Okay, so
4575000	4579400	This quest do you see how we are assigned someone with a name?
4579960	4583400	That is because you're actually killing multiplayer characters
4584360	4589320	That are in multiplayer. I know it sounds silly and I know it sounds bizarre, but
4590280	4593720	When you could play Assassin's Creed brotherhood multiplayer
4594360	4600120	You got to pick between the skins and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode
4600680	4604360	100% for this one is just air assassination. Super simple and easy
4605240	4610600	The guards do attack you but some turn into cowards once you kill multiple guards, which is a lovely
4611240	4613480	PayPal support doesn't open for several hours
4615400	4617400	Did I break PayPal?
4618040	4619800	Oops
4619800	4623160	Are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke PayPal?
4623720	4627320	Wait, can none of the girls get donations right now?
4628760	4633560	Uh, so you can be grabbed but as I said the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones
4633640	4639640	Like the ones with just a hat will turn into cowards, which is an absolutely lovely human detail
4639960	4645400	Yeah, see the ones with those like beret type hats they turn into cowards
4646040	4647720	Beautiful
4647720	4654200	Beautiful detail. I think that is gorgeous to show human nature instead of the AI
4654440	4662520	Just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die because you will I just think these are and this is 2010
4663960	4670280	Development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even as far back as 2007
4670840	4673240	Um, so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops
4673720	4680280	Because guards find you extremely sussy, but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now
4680840	4682280	um
4682280	4685080	But like for development that far back to like capture
4685720	4692280	To even think outside the box to capture human nature like that definitely hats off to the development team
4692840	4698520	Um, I know it is by ubi soft and there are some very there's a very unique
4699320	4705160	Ending to this tale and Assassin's Creed brotherhood and I couldn't for the life of me
4705880	4707880	There's a feather up on here by the way
4708680	4710040	You can grab
4710040	4715880	Sightings if you cite something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map
4715960	4720360	Which is fantastic. So if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment. Um,
4721320	4723320	But yeah
4723400	4726520	This game has also been rated
4727080	4729560	In the top 100 games of all time
4730360	4734680	I believe it placed around 60th on recent 100
4735800	4737400	Game ranking type things
4737400	4743560	But Assassin's Creed brotherhood always makes it and I 100% agree for me it is first place, but I'm biased
4744200	4749160	But absolutely deserved it. So we have met marquiovelli. This is marquiovelli. He was the guy
4750600	4755320	Um, that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us not killing the spanyard
4756280	4762280	Uh, and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know what's going on in roma
4762280	4767160	We know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front of us right now
4767960	4771480	So we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma
4785320	4787320	Yeah
4793320	4795320	Borja hate we hate the borja
4796440	4798440	I'm gonna burp is that okay
4800120	4804760	That was me popping my lips. That was the actual burp. Sorry. Sorry to mislead you like that
4805560	4810200	So you need to wait for a little second, uh, because if you go too quickly into the
4811080	4812280	Blacksmith
4812280	4816600	Uh, the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest
4816680	4818840	So you're buying an armor and a small weapon
4819160	4826920	This small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself
4827480	4832920	Now you can survive that's right. That's right. I debated you didn't know. Yeah, you thought that pop was my burp
4832920	4834920	And
4858040	4862520	So for some reason even though you're right next to him he gets really quiet in certain voicelines
4862920	4864920	Cruel beyond the magic
4865000	4867000	The laws of men mean nothing
4867560	4871800	He murdered his own brother who takes power. He knows neither danger nor fatigue
4872760	4875880	Those who do not fall. I'm literally hugging him to get him to talk
4885480	4887480	Jar of leeches head of the people
4887560	4889560	What does he intend to do with his power?
4890360	4892040	so again
4892040	4896760	Eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now, but that's okay
4912600	4914600	Okay, so we're starting to learn
4915480	4921080	That the Borgia has overtaken roma and is completely messing it up for the people
4922760	4929320	And mark you avail is obviously not very happy, but we have to do what the current laid-out rules are
4930280	4932280	and
4933080	4935080	Yummy jar of leeches
4936200	4939080	The cuttlefish eat leeches. I feel like they probably do
4945080	4947080	I'll talk after this bit
4948680	4950680	Water check
4952040	4954040	large
4975560	4976840	Okay
4976840	4979400	Now to very quickly bring you up to speed
4979960	4987000	The Borgia are forbidding us in this section to use the stables and other areas of development
4987720	4989720	Also, this is the most fucking annoying
4990440	4996440	Thing to get 100% on hold on. Oh get off the horse. I hate when they go on the horse
4997000	5003800	Oh, no, I've made it so much worse. Okay. So this captain you have to grab him and put him in that
5003960	5005800	Um
5005800	5009720	Uh, oh my god, that freaking citizen was in the way. I didn't want to strike in case
5010120	5012440	I can't see because of the camera angles
5013960	5018840	By the way, this game aged really well aged really well. I promise it aged well
5020200	5021960	No
5021960	5024680	Right. I am going to no. He's on it. No
5025960	5027960	This couldn't have gone any worse
5028920	5032600	Please I've never had this issue in this game before
5033160	5036920	Right, just grab him grab him and push him. Fuck him. You can kill
5037880	5043960	Right. No, right. We're not 100% in this right now. I'm literally bright red and embarrassment of this gameplay
5044200	5045640	We're fuck you
5045640	5048360	Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you
5051560	5057640	Please get off the horses. I hate when they're on the horses. All right, maybe I can do it. Hold on
5058200	5065160	Oh my god, I can still 100% it. Okay. You need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding and push him in it
5066120	5068120	Yes
5068440	5073480	Whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body
5073640	5076280	He has insane amounts of money on his person
5076840	5079560	That was terrible, but we resurrected it
5079880	5086920	The reason and you have to kill the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100% on this
5087480	5093160	Borgia tower. My god. I have never attracted those other four guards before
5093240	5096280	I've never had them jump on freaking horses before
5097000	5099000	That was terrible
5100680	5102680	But we did it we got 100%
5104840	5108760	Oh my god, I'm my face is bright red. I'm like, oh my god
5110040	5113720	Oh, I forgot to burn the tower off for goodness sake. Okay. We need to call
5114280	5118840	Not the tower. Oh my god. I'm getting so flustered. Oh, right
5119480	5126520	So we've just reclaimed this district. So you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the
5126840	5133000	Borgia, they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of roma. Okay
5133880	5135880	wait
5136280	5143160	I'm an idiot. Marquia Valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet. Please pardon me for jumping that tower
5143560	5145560	I'm skipping ahead of the game
5146440	5148840	Right out my way out my way out my way out my way
5149480	5153480	The guards make peep you here, but they don't actually get you. Okay. We are now giving instructions
5160280	5163560	Oh, I might need to take my hoodie off I'm sweating and embarrassment
5164200	5167800	I was like, oh my god, you guys are gonna think I've never played this game before. I'm like, no
5167880	5174040	It's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never follow you inside as long as you keep moving
5174200	5176200	Yeah, the guards will never go for you
5176440	5177640	Um
5177640	5184600	Literally xio is exhausted. He's climbed this tower three times now. He's like Jesus woman. Give me a break. Okay
5185640	5188120	You can ignite to the Borgia tower
5189400	5191400	Like so
5198280	5201240	Oh, because all the kill-out
5208360	5216120	Okay, now this is another interesting part of the game, which you can renovate districts to have an income
5220120	5224520	The controller vibration on the literally uh, it's crazy
5225080	5229880	Okay, we have just renovated the stables. We now have access to horsey-worsies
5231240	5232120	Yeah
5232120	5233960	No
5233960	5237320	So we will jump on a horse. Thank you horse VTuber. We love you
5242520	5247960	He does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so he's not talking to us right now
5248440	5250440	but basically he's like
5251000	5255080	You can't just do what you want. It's xio. It's dangerous. Roma have been here
5255560	5257240	The Borgia have like
5257240	5262520	Settled their ways the people are scared basically too long didn't read. Thank you marcia valley for your input
5263000	5265880	Uh, it always bugs out. He should be talking to us like right now
5273480	5276760	You always use the white and gray horse here, I'm gonna say something
5277240	5279240	Nope, here we go
5291480	5293480	Oh, he mad at us
5307320	5311240	Yes, yes brotherhood of the people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry
5312440	5315880	Also, you should always go behind the NPC because that'll happen
5320200	5322200	The audio is bugging out
5325720	5327720	Wait, can you guys not hear the game?
5329080	5331080	Eh
5331400	5335560	I will wait that he can't be Torio. I need to get contact there. It sounds fit
5338360	5340360	Give me a bad one. Eh
5341960	5343960	Why oh
5345720	5351320	Input what you can turn this feature off. I never fucking asked you to turn it on you twat
5352600	5354600	Fuck off right

5361480	5365400	Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. It's chase mission. It's a chase mission
5368440	5371720	It's the game that's crunchy. What the frick why have to be crunchy?
5373240	5375240	Oh
5375320	5377320	Hold on
5378040	5380040	Why are you crunchy?
5381000	5385720	Okay, I'm opening up the game. I'm gonna muck around with the audio sentence. Um, you know
5386360	5388360	Mission failed. We'll get him next time
5389320	5394360	All right, why would you be crunchy even though I didn't change a single thing?
5394360	5396360	Am I gonna have to close the game and open it back up again?
5402600	5404600	Yeah, this isn't gonna do anything
5405320	5407320	Okay, okay, we're closing the game
5407480	5409080	We're closing the game
5409080	5415080	Abort memory. Oh my god. We're in the middle of a freaking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No progress. It's gonna be lost sure useless
5415960	5423480	You naughty boy. Why would it be crunchy? I got a notification and the thing was like I am changing
5424120	5429640	Your input and I dismissed it because I never told it to do anything and I just freaking did it. I'm gonna burp
5431320	5433640	Who goes there by the pope identify yourself?
5435400	5437160	I said close game
5437160	5439160	Did I not say close game?
5439160	5441880	Would you like to would you like to close perhaps?
5442680	5446520	Yes, yes, you may close the game. Yes, that's as perfectly fine. You're allowed to
5447240	5449240	uh, right close
5450280	5452280	That
5452760	5455240	Maybe I just need to do desktop audio capture
5456280	5458280	This is plausible
5458520	5460520	And this is probable
5461160	5465720	All right, okay. Hold on. I'll down. I'll down. Look come on. No streamer's gonna go without unhinged
5467640	5469640	Open

5482520	5489320	Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's loading the logo and we can't see it. Yeah. I'm just like, let me just
5489720	5491720	Calibrate the game real quick
5493160	5495160	Just a few technical difficulties
5495320	5497320	Ah
5497560	5501880	Also me this game stood up to the test of time clearly fucking not
5503400	5507560	Can you lovely jubbly peeps? Can you
5509400	5512600	Can you hear there? Is that crunchy? No
5515160	5519320	Is that still crunchy if not, you're just gonna have to hear my desktop audio instead
5525640	5529800	Sounds good. Okay. Why is game not on stream stream scream?
5534840	5540760	Uh game. Hello game game. Would you like to show up, please? Is it because I'm not is it because I'm not in game?

5565720	5567720	Mm-hmm. Oh
5567720	5569720	Oh, no, I'm pretty sure
5569720	5575960	Assassin's Creed brotherhood is like really problematic to capture in window and I've just fucked it up because I closed it there
5576360	5578360	Oh
5579080	5581080	Oh
5582120	5586600	Thank fucking god, I thought I was gonna have to end the stream to like get it to start back up again
5588120	5591320	Don't ever do that to me again
5594120	5596680	Oh my goodness. Oh shit, right chase chase chase
5597640	5600840	Uh, I used to kill this guy all the get time and not understand why
5602040	5604040	I'll go at least
5604600	5606600	That in your life
5606920	5613960	Rip your ears. Is it too loud? Sorry the guards don't like me yet. They're pushing me away. Don't push me. I'll push you
5616920	5620360	Stream it. Yes me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh
5621640	5623640	Thank god. I was so worried
5624520	5627720	My heart feels full of relief. It is so bootyful
5628760	5632680	Um, obviously because of it's an older game you can see the distance rendering
5634200	5641240	Not loud just the scream was ear piecing. Oh, okay. Do apologize for that. Sometimes I get a little bit excited
5641960	5644440	But I'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear
5647560	5652360	Not now Sean not now Sean go away. Get back here. Give me my money back
5655880	5657880	Okay, there we go. We made it
5658600	5661720	Did you liberate your money from our friend?
5662920	5664920	Week
5665000	5669880	They are up and time with work. We'll have a few dozen more depends on the the
5671400	5675080	Subject six you mentioned. We'll do that at the end. I don't want to do subject
5675080	5679480	Now where is my contact Vinicius? He should have already intercepted the letter
5680280	5682280	follow me
5682280	5689640	Okay, we are now riding our horses to roma. Uh, marquiovelli's just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people
5690120	5694680	And it's he goes. Yeah, I believe in the people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us
5694680	5696680	But we got it back. That's fine. That's the main thing
5697160	5704360	But it's he is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an ordinary citizen
5704680	5708120	who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has
5709320	5712600	Um, just had an absolutely awful time and you've gone. Hey
5713240	5715320	Do you want to get back at your oppressors?
5715960	5720200	And then they go, uh, cc because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes
5720360	5723800	They'd say see you and then the good part that
5725480	5729080	The best part I would argue about this game starts up from there
5731320	5733320	Okay, so we're just following horsey horsey around
5735160	5739400	Uh, I love you excelene because I'm like you don't worry. I'm like you in general
5739400	5741400	But these are just one of the games that I'm like
5742920	5744920	I love everything about
5745480	5748360	Sees the means of the projection mi amici
5751400	5754600	Astroni can relate to being a precious gosh steady on
5755640	5761480	Thankfully I was born in a good timeline, but uh, if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate
5762040	5764040	Scottish people many a time
5764280	5766280	However, uh, the
5766920	5770440	Romans built a wall called hadrian's wall
5771160	5775080	Because they weren't interested in going any further into scotland
5776360	5779960	They said now you guys can keep it. We're not interested in invading. Yes
5781000	5783000	That's true. That's actually science
5786520	5791160	Leave my thieves alone you foul beast. Oh that was a bit steady on it
5791400	5794360	It's here. What was that? It's so you're supposed to like jump on them
5795240	5800280	Okay, well we got countered so I'll just be up. Let's just kick the thief
5801000	5803400	I've never had these issues. Oh my god performance. I say
5805880	5807880	I can't get up one in three men
5811960	5817400	Time me at the term the baths. Okay, we'll find you the baths. Okay, we're about to do a major tutorial part coming up
5817960	5820680	But don't worry. It's like a good part
5821480	5825720	Um, so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway through this. We're currently in the coliseum
5826200	5827080	Uh
5827080	5832600	Coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now. This is very accurate to probably what it looks like going
5836200	5841000	One in three men, but one in one colfish. How dare you? I assure you my bony
5841800	5843800	bony can
5844920	5846920	My pecker
5847640	5852840	Um, it's so easy to get to get engorged
5855640	5862600	Oh my god, I'm actually gonna announce it any engorgers anyone getting engorged right now. Yeah. Yeah, I bet you are
5864120	5865320	Okay
5865320	5870920	This part if we can do it flawlessly first time so I don't need to be embarrassed
5871320	5876040	however, the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so
5877960	5883080	First things first take out your wee knife. Know the big knife. Take out your wee knife. Okay
5883960	5885960	For this part that comes up
5885960	5891320	Because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me river and moon walked into that sequence there
5895640	5901080	We are about to encounter a second enemy not the border
5903480	5905480	Romulae
5906440	5908440	Let's see if I can do this without messing up
5909720	5915400	Okay, pause you have to reselect your small knife because the game always
5916040	5921400	Right if I don't get hit I am blessed by the gods because you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit
5927880	5930440	I hate when they attack that blinking means they're attacking
5930840	5935960	And you can if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't tell if they're about to okay
5936360	5939400	We got the 10 in a row serial killer achievement. Oh
5940440	5942440	We did it 100% of that
5943240	5944360	Oh
5944360	5946360	That a bit always stresses me out my heart rate is
5948040	5950040	Okay, this is a tutorial sequence
5951160	5953160	This is called the
5953400	5955400	layers of romulus
5955640	5959480	Guy or Romulae if you you want to get techie speaking but Romulus
5960920	5962680	Wow
5962680	5965080	I swear she killed them all with one knife
5966680	5969560	So this is timed. Okay. We're on a timer
5970440	5977480	Um, you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes
5977560	5982680	Because we will have to come back in 100% this section because in order to get the 100%
5983640	5985640	Um time
5985880	5988120	Is what this one is. So we're just gonna
5988840	5994200	Speed on by we're gonna do a little speedy Gonzalez. I am not going to read chat for eight minutes
5994200	5999480	It takes me about seven minutes to do the sequence. The timer is eight minutes. I apologize chat
5999560	6002680	I can see you rating my burp in the corner of my eye
6002920	6008200	You must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time
6008440	6010440	Um
6010600	6013880	It is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time
6014600	6016600	Um, but normally I finish
6017240	6019960	Roughly 40 seconds to one minute early
6020680	6027960	Um, unfortunately this game is a bit funner. I've just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame, but
6029080	6031080	Hey ho, it's what happens
6031160	6033160	uh
6033240	6037880	Yes, obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the I don't know how compose the music or
6038200	6041000	Do is commission to compose the music very
6041800	6043080	Very good
6043080	6048440	Okay, I can read you for like one second. She hates us. No, I don't need to do the time sequence
6049880	6055320	I finished early. Oh, I finished early. All right. You want to tell me tell you how early often
6057080	6059720	I think I've said this before but um
6060520	6065080	My record is like one minute and like 54 seconds
6065240	6072360	Roughly and the only reason I know why is because that's how long the preview was for the video
6072920	6080920	It was a free preview. I'm just gonna admit it. Sorry, but if you guys are like, I'm so nervous to talk to her in chat
6081480	6082920	I am
6082920	6084920	absolutely not destined
6085560	6086600	uh
6086600	6088600	to be
6088680	6089880	professional
6089880	6091400	or whatever
6091400	6096440	But uh, yeah, that's actually true story. I could probably find the video and share it
6097640	6099640	um
6099800	6101800	If you really wanted to see how good that
6103960	6107560	Um, we're under a timer so we are just gonna kind of
6113320	6113960	Right, okay
6113960	6117400	You need to look for the open gate and I get it wrong all the time
6117480	6121800	But open gate and then take a no. Oh my god. I get it wrong all the time
6121800	6125240	Do you know how many times I've freaking played this game and I do that every single time?
6125800	6127800	You'd think I'd learn honestly
6130600	6132600	One day I'll learn
6133400	6135800	But I have a fun factoid
6136760	6140600	That I will tell you later once we get to that part of the thingy
6140600	6145800	But uh, this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed on this channel
6146760	6149560	Uh, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on this channel in particular
6151000	6159160	Um, because I um have very much tizm this game into submission and
6161080	6165800	I don't know should I just ruin it? You know what if you're here right now, I think I'm allowed to ruin it
6166280	6170680	So my birthday is the 10th of october
6171640	6174120	Um, oh you must always grab this light
6174840	6181240	The game will pretend like you can do it. So october 10th is my doughnut on and you'll never guess what date
6181640	6186920	Uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th. So we're playing it on my doughnut on
6188920	6195640	Um, and I get to nerd about the game all over again, and I'm already beaming with happiness just thinking about it
6196600	6201400	I was like, oh no, no, no, no. I'm going to subject you this twice
6202120	6206600	You you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it
6208680	6210280	Um
6210280	6211800	We're getting close to the
6211800	6215640	Main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the sequence comes in
6216360	6223560	I'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because I've not really had I don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section
6223800	6225800	Once you've killed all the romuli guys, then
6226440	6230040	Uh, not once have I had the game crash on multiple playthroughs
6230680	6237720	Um, this game was literally made for me for real for real like actually though like I mean, how did they know? Like, oh my god, this is
6238920	6243720	Um for safety, I just follow this. I think you maybe can jump off
6244600	6249400	There's a fire, but uh, I'm not risking the run. I do not want to play this like
6250360	6252920	Section again. It's not boring
6256920	6262040	Hmm, I'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching. They're not um
6263160	6269000	Obviously every game section you have a preference for me being timed to claim about isn't
6269560	6273560	But I understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like
6274360	6281320	Not to panic the player, but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas, then it might
6281960	6283320	be quite
6283320	6285320	boresome
6285320	6291480	Any boresoms? There's a flag to the left. We will not be collecting it. There's also a treasure box up ahead again
6291560	6295320	We're not going to be collecting it. We are trying to get our eight minute timer
6296120	6300760	Uh, we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot sit there. This is the grand hall
6300760	6304760	This is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it
6304840	6311480	But uh, I've done it quite a lot. So the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game
6314920	6316920	Um
6317160	6323320	I always mess this bit up as well. You need to look for this one in order to get inside
6325880	6327880	This section
6328280	6329480	um
6329480	6333800	Now assassins creed was made long before the yellow paint
6334360	6341560	So they use candlelight and fixtures. I'll show you one section that really highlights the the old candle fixtures
6342280	6345320	Um, we're about to break this so don't be shocked
6346680	6348680	I'm quite loud at the breaking
6348760	6350760	Bit loud, isn't it night?
6351080	6355080	Yes, so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been
6355720	6361080	They know they've made it awkward. So you saw those treasure boxes. You see that flag there again
6361160	6363960	We're just gonna ignore it. We're here for the speed run and we're not
6364440	6369160	I actually don't know what the speed run of this game would be. I assume it's probably like under three hours
6369560	6374200	The first time I played this it took me so long to figure out where I had to go. You have to go on the chair
6375160	6380600	Literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam. Do you know how long it took me to find this beam as a child?
6380920	6383880	Like I started asking my mum for help because my mum plays tomb raider
6384360	6385240	and
6385240	6388200	And she was like then you look at me straw day and I'm like mum
6389240	6392680	You're small like I'm a child. You can you must be able to see
6394040	6398760	You must also grab a lot and to to like save yourself
6399000	6405400	See, this doesn't look like you should be able to grab it. But if you hold b you can get it. Sorry. I play xbox controller
6405800	6408280	Uh, I don't know what it is for like ps
6408840	6410680	uh four
6410680	6413240	Is it triangle? No triangles. Why?
6414840	6416840	um
6419240	6423480	And we're almost there. We're doing good for time. We've not actually made any mistakes yet
6423560	6429160	Like such as falling off falling off is the oh man. Is she fell off? Okay. Okay, dude. You're done. Um
6429640	6432440	It's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences
6432760	6434520	uh
6434520	6439320	Don't worry the game does try to resurrect you. So this is the freaking jump that I've
6440040	6444920	It's freaking humongous and it's so no you cannot make that in real life
6446200	6448200	But we are perfect for times
6448200	6453480	Um, and when you pick up the objective the timer stops
6453720	6457320	So you couldn't theory go back and get all the stuff you missed
6458200	6462280	However, I am much more happier to continue on with the campaign
6462360	6466520	But this is a tutorial section that's part of the main quest line
6467160	6469160	um for the layer of
6469960	6473000	Romulus which there are six total
6473880	6478360	And it unlocks you special armor. Uh, I personally don't actually go
6479240	6481240	Right, we're gonna pick it up. We're gonna pick it up
6482200	6487480	So we're picking it up now. So the timer has now officially stopped. We are no longer under the eight minute timer
6489160	6495320	So I leave my family's armor here one of the finest sets ever made may you who finds it
6495480	6498520	Receive strength and battle change of handwriting
6499000	6505960	We have taken it and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers
6506280	6511160	It shall be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it
6511800	6515800	And we have a picture of the armor that we may unlock at a later time
6516840	6522200	Again, I don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough. It's not necessary. It's a bit time consuming as well
6522280	6523960	It's probably like an extra hour
6523960	6528440	So the timer is paused if I pause the game time remaining 133
6528600	6532600	So yeah, we can pick up all these treasure boxes because we're gonna need it
6533480	6535480	you get florins in this game and
6536360	6541000	The campaign actually requires you to have 3,500 florins at one section
6541960	6547000	Um, and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond because we cannot invest in like
6547640	6550920	Properties for example that part comes very soon
6552280	6554280	um
6554520	6561320	How kind of them to write in clear, uh, yeah detail for us to read their, uh, evil plans basically, but there we go
6562440	6564440	Ancient roman tomowers. Mmm
6565480	6568600	Would you like to taste my ancient roman tomow?
6570280	6576840	Tomato at golden boy achievement unlock. So we've done one as one layer of Romulus
6577400	6585480	I'm gonna head off. Thank you for hanging. Please don't worry. I believe she be is coming up in an hour
6586840	6589400	No in 10 minutes. Who's coming up next?
6593480	6595480	I'm going to take a drink
6596680	6600600	Is that where the ketchup? No, you're done. You're done. Ben. You're not bad
6601560	6607560	In nine minutes. Yes. Okay, when she be goes live, please do tell me I will always recommend you guys go watch my gen mates
6611400	6615720	Because because I'm an endurance streamer. I'd rather you support them
6619800	6621800	Are you also an older?
6626520	6628520	Okay, this is a beautiful quest
6630600	6634280	It's a beautiful quest. It has include revelation. Yes, you play a much older etio
6634280	6638200	I think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and it's like
6640760	6644040	They really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this
6644680	6646680	um
6646920	6650600	See you tonight when mercy rates into you. Honestly though
6652440	6654440	Guelph etio
6655400	6664600	Brotherhood is etio in his prime for you for it. He's like 42 or 41. I believe in this game a bit of an old man, but hey
6668520	6670520	Other bombs
6672600	6675800	Okay, we're about to unlock the next sequence. It's so good
6677720	6681320	So the map of roma is massive, but there's guards everywhere
6681880	6685720	So he's telling us if you use the aqueducts, you can move about real quick
6685880	6689960	So we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to island tebarina
6690920	6695320	And this is where the assassins are based on on the map in roma
6698920	6702440	When mercy airdonstream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story
6702920	6707480	Honestly, oh my god, azurid. It's so well on her 2.0
6708440	6715800	She's fantastic with all her yapping. I think someone said yeah procorn and I was like, well, that's pretty smart. I like that
6720040	6722040	He's not really in this at all
6723400	6730360	Fabio, I feel like he might have been dlc content or something. He has two seeds in this game. And yeah
6732200	6734200	I don't know what
6737640	6739640	I'd rather confuse
6742920	6744920	Her voice is sick
6745560	6750440	Gee willikers. I wonder why I picked azura. I think we are ready for such an effect for the model
6751320	6755080	Do you know for instance where the borja troops took katharina's forza?
6755800	6760120	What are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple of Eden?
6761160	6763160	How could you have lost the apple?
6763160	6765400	So you do not know what goes on with our enemies
6766120	6770440	Do we at least have an underground here to work with no underground network found
6771080	6774760	Our mercenaries are ensnared in illusory love. He doesn't even talk to me
6775480	6781000	We have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals. Oh my god. It's she be you're in my game
6781320	6785800	But the madam there is a lot rather attend parties than further of cause
6786760	6788760	What about the city steves?
6788760	6792120	Do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us?
6792440	6794440	I do not know why
6795640	6798760	What are you going to do to make some friends make some friends?
6799480	6801480	such a good line
6801560	6805800	Because we're about to make three different allies of different districts. We're about to make friends with the thieves
6805880	6810120	We're about to make friends with the hoes. We're about to make friends with the mercenaries. Let's go
6811400	6813400	It's very good
6814200	6817000	We also unlock notoriety in this as well
6818440	6820040	um
6820040	6825160	And we also unlock having little uh things achievement unlock from in ruins
6828040	6830680	Make friends with the hoes to the window
6831400	6838280	The fighter the lover and the thief to the sweat drop off my boss. Oh skeet skeet mother
6839240	6842360	Oh skeet skeet god. You want a scottish cover of that song?
6845080	6847080	Right we are going to do the eagle point
6847640	6851000	Right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around island tibirina
6853480	6855480	Please
6858040	6862840	Right, so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason
6863320	6869960	For the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety. So guards are going to start harassing us a bit more
6870600	6873960	Um heralds are going to start talking about the devious
6874200	6881640	Uh acts that xio has committed and we're also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies
6883560	6886440	You didn't falsify your testimony to me
6887720	6891080	We've also been introduced to the bank. Um
6892760	6894760	Where we can
6894920	6899480	Get money for investing in the city every 20 minutes
6899560	6904840	We will get our little twint or cup from investing in these places
6905720	6907480	um
6907480	6912360	And we have withdrawn four to eight florins. We are rich. We're rich. We're rich
6913080	6914920	Any you played that game?
6914920	6918760	Have you heard about that game that that one game about the the guys that dig in the mines? Right?
6919080	6925000	We're going to go to sorry. I didn't want to learn the lore of the bridge. Sorry bridge. Not interested
6925160	6927400	We're going to go to the hose first
6928280	6930280	Cause there's thousands of liars
6931640	6938680	Um and do this quest line. This is the campaign quest that requires florins in order to progress
6938760	6947160	However, you can get a very I think you get roughly 2000 florins for doing this quest if you loot the bodies of
6948360	6950040	the
6950040	6955240	What the heck this place is bourgeois. Should we just destroy rest ever just going to go kill the captain?
6955960	6958760	I hope he's not a coward because cowards run
6959560	6961800	Oh, he's not a coward. Okay. We're gonna

6982840	6985080	We're going to heal and we're going to loot this guy
6985480	6992520	We're going to unlock this area because see how the the map is red. That's because the bourgeois one is
6993160	6995160	Joined by this guy. Okay
6995880	7000920	This looks bad with how much red is on screen. I will get hit. There's absolutely no doubt in my head
7001000	7003160	We're going to get hit but it's fine. We're going to deal with it
7003880	7007400	We get the big guys first because these you want to kill the big guys in sequence
7007800	7014120	Okay, no, we just attracted the attention of that guard over there, which is such a shame. No, we attracted more attention

7077080	7079080	Oh in the best of kids
7079400	7084200	Uh, there might be an archer on the other side, but it's not a big deal at this point because we have
7085320	7088360	Got the thing uh, right. How do I get up here?
7088840	7092600	Um, we are going to unlock what's called a leaping glove
7093000	7098680	Um, which means we can do very very big jumps. Uh, unfortunately we can't do it at this section of the tower
7098680	7102520	So we're gonna have to drop down and reclaim it at a different area
7103720	7108680	We unlock that in sequence four. I think at the end of sequence four. I can't remember
7109720	7111720	Um, but it means we can jump things
7112440	7117320	Very easily and it makes claiming much faster because right now it's a wee bit slow, but it's fine

7208760	7211560	Uh, uh, oh, this is dead end. I always forget the section
7212040	7217960	Uh, normally recruitment's actually spawning those sections and they're so annoying to try and get them do a barrel roll literally
7219720	7225400	Yes, oh, I'm getting I'm getting shanked. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm getting picked up by thieves. Right. This wasn't supposed to this
7225640	7227400	This isn't a part of the
7227400	7229160	Leave me like, wha
7229160	7232680	For these skinny agile guys, you must take out your small weapon drapes
7233240	7235560	Swords as well work, but um, yes
7235560	7239800	He had so you have to wait until they attack you basically because they're so agile it's such a
7240680	7242680	And then you can do that
7244280	7248520	Oh my god, oh, I don't want the guards to see me with this body. We're just going to go straight into the memory
7249080	7251240	Don't want the guards to make the bodies on me
7254200	7256200	It was fun hanging
7257400	7259400	Have fun with sheepster
7262040	7264040	Bye bye. Thanks for hanging
7266360	7271000	Molly stream drift. Ayuto. That means help in attack. Ayuto. Ayuto
7274600	7280520	Oh my god, she got her look at her nose. She got a nose job. Look at that peak on that nose. That's beautiful
7282680	7284680	I will get her back
7285080	7287720	Beautiful beautiful. Oh, I really need to pee. Not gonna lie
7288600	7290600	kind of need to pee
7290600	7291640	um
7291640	7294360	Maybe after I finish this act we can go pee
7295560	7299800	If you see top left it says like I've got 5 000 florins, but I need 2.5
7300280	7304920	It must be 3k for the banker uh sequence, but that's not yet the banker comes later
7305480	7307480	Um banker is a later act
7308360	7311800	We are currently doing the lover the thief in the fighter
7312840	7314200	um
7314280	7318440	Okay, now that I've noticed I need to pee. I really need to pee. Um
7319560	7323640	Uh brain psychology. Have you heard of this? Uh, do you want to maybe not?
7324200	7329720	I'm a bit rude. We are just going to run. Normally you can just take a horse over this section, but I find
7330840	7332840	They've spawned a wee bit too much
7333640	7337320	People to like walk around and the horse really struggles to go in between
7337800	7342920	Like the streets, especially if there's narrow sections, whereas xio can just straight up jump over
7343320	7345320	Uh, so we will be just doing that
7347640	7349640	Self-fulfilling prophecy
7349640	7351640	I need to pee
7352520	7358520	Oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time, but we like affect the water like flush system
7358760	7361160	Why did you take out the sword xio? I
7361880	7366760	He just poked him in that eye xio. That was that was a lot. Oh
7367480	7373320	Whoopsies. I actually didn't mean to do that. I literally just smacked my mouth. I didn't mean to kill him
7373400	7380600	I'm sorry. You're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and I've just like literally made made her a widow
7382680	7384040	Oh
7384040	7387160	Don't really feel good about that one. Uh, so this is a bourgeois on
7389000	7391640	It's actually really annoying
7393560	7396200	Do we do the bourgeois on before we do this?
7396760	7402120	Oh, no, we won't I can't be arsed. We'll come back to this zone. It's a lot easier when you have recruits
7402680	7404680	Have you come for the whore?
7405320	7407320	close enough
7410600	7413480	It's what happens at football halftime. Oh, I heard that
7415160	7417160	What? Oh my god
7417160	7423880	I don't remember this part right again. No way. Did you see the four things behind me? Soldiers are about to board this boat as well
7424600	7429480	Okay, you must loot the bodies. Oh, I forgot to loot the bodies. Oh, that's fine. Oh
7431320	7433320	Why are the freaking
7437400	7439400	Energy pro, okay
7440120	7445080	So we're gonna look at the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique items like elephant ivory
7445960	7448440	Uh, 200 coins. I thought it was a bit more than that
7449160	7454200	Yeah, vlad then paler coins. Um, these items can be traded at shops for special items
7455400	7457640	Who goes there identify yourself? Um
7460600	7466920	And after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards
7468040	7473480	They are very vital to a later campy a later sequence
7474280	7480120	Uh, actually the banker sequence, uh, which I previously mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay
7480600	7484920	You can also get favors done by them. I don't mean like that because they're courtesans
7485240	7487240	I mean like
7487240	7492600	So the base price to hire a group is 150 florins, but if you wow them
7493080	7500760	Uh, you can get a discount rate of 75 florins. I've made that sound so weird. I know but it's the gameplay
7501720	7509160	Um, the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves will pickpocket naturally as you walk through clouds
7509880	7516520	But it's a little bit more. It's not awkward to get the thieves favor. They just have a few more unique. Um
7518760	7520840	A few more unique things you have to do
7520920	7525640	I will explain it when we once we unlock it. We're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more sense
7526360	7532040	Um, but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood
7532520	7536200	Allies which are assassin allies and they will help your gameplay
7536280	7540920	if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just not there with it with time in and
7541640	7545400	Like things if the games are going too fast and you're like, I can't keep up
7545640	7550680	This is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls
7551000	7553080	because once you unlock assassin recruits
7553560	7559160	Your life is so much easier from there. It's it's bliss. It's a dream
7559240	7566040	It's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress and that these are my kena games
7566120	7572680	Okay, I don't want to feel stressed out. Uh, if I don't hit that you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here
7574600	7579480	Uh, 75 for a whole group of them. Damn. No wonder strongy only was 100 for the ASMR
7579720	7583000	Booth, could you imagine if a con would let us do that though?
7583800	7585800	I think we'd get kicked out
7587240	7589240	I'm not gonna lie
7589880	7596280	Not that I'm insinuating anything would occur in the booth, but I feel like
7598280	7601720	Things may go hand quickly
7602760	7604760	Uh
7605720	7608520	Oh, is there sister and her mom they're in roma now
7612520	7614520	You cannot close I need your help
7616040	7623320	Good morning. Good. Good morning. Good afternoon and good evening. Oh, yes. Good morning. Good afternoon. No, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. There we go
7623480	7625480	That's
7625480	7628520	This is different. What alternative do you have?
7628600	7633160	So claudia is currently she be cotton bum because she's about to run a brothela
7633640	7635640	I've been on the blooming rose
7637000	7642360	Why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research
7642680	7644680	These are the hairstyles
7645000	7646200	at the time
7646200	7648680	Good morning. Good evening. Good night. Did I say the wrong way?
7649560	7651560	far
7652760	7654600	I'm a wee bit slow
7654600	7658280	So we are now about to renovate this lovely location
7658840	7664840	And our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans
7665960	7670760	Uh, the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that. Um
7671640	7675800	There's a flag at the top. You can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly
7676840	7678840	Um, but we're about to go inside
7679240	7680520	but
7680520	7682520	Jen too called the blooming rose
7683080	7685080	honestly
7685800	7688600	There are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd
7690440	7693880	We were talking about like actually coming to physical cons
7696280	7698280	Rosa infior
7698520	7700520	Um
7703400	7705400	Okay, this
7708600	7711720	The border make it difficult for claudia's girls
7712040	7715320	There are several things you could do that would aid them
7717000	7723880	You can do side quests for the brotella with your mom or whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
7725320	7726760	No
7726760	7729480	No, she assigns you a quest
7731320	7736520	You do not do a quest with your mom and they get okay
7737480	7739480	Ah
7740040	7741160	Apologies
7741160	7746600	Right. Okay. So as I was talking about you can kind of level them up. You can be given assignments
7746840	7750840	So right now it costs 150 florins to highlight to hire a group of girls
7751160	7752600	um
7752600	7756200	Send 10 guards distracted hide bodies
7757000	7758440	poison
7758440	7764040	Assassinate from blind spots assassinate from behind smoke bomb with not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later
7764280	7770280	But you can do these and gain favor with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier
7771400	7773080	um
7773080	7775480	Right next we are going to
7776680	7783000	Actually factually do the mercenaries, which is this one. I'm just highlighting it on the map. So I don't get confused
7783400	7785400	Yes, it is very far away
7786200	7788200	Um, however
7789160	7790920	Well, we can just
7790920	7792040	Run there
7792040	7796360	I think I can't take a horse and I cannot take the aqueduct because
7797000	7801320	As soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map
7801320	7807400	Which is fine because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing things
7807400	7810520	So yeah, horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through
7811000	7815880	Though this is a lost memory of the girl that got away, but we're not going to do it right now
7815880	7819640	We're going to do it at the end. I do apologize if you're really interested in the story
7820360	7822360	uh, what's her name?
7822920	7824920	Christina is her name
7825240	7827480	Um, but that sad part comes in later
7828360	7835240	Uh, it is a very unfavorable and sad memory. So I like leaving it to the end. I'd rather just focus on the happy times
7837160	7839320	Hey, only 500 more meters to go
7840920	7842920	Uh, Christina, I knew it was Christina
7843880	7850440	Yeah, this game as much as I'll meme about the render distance like as soon as you get closer to someone
7850600	7851880	I've just
7851880	7853880	Added so much time going this way, whatever. Um
7855400	7859880	I'm like, I'm trying to find the main freaking road, but I can't find it. It's really annoying
7860360	7862840	Okay, I found the main road and I'm about to go off it. Yippee
7863640	7868920	Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I swapped him out a sword. Oh, this entire zone's red and I'm not strong enough to kill him
7870120	7872120	We are
7873880	7877320	Then we just run through the area to save us time to be honest
7879800	7883400	No, no, I'm not stopping. You can't make me go away. You stink
7884280	7885960	Stinky stinky guard
7885960	7890760	We'll come back once we unlock recruits. Um, I can't get over your accident. Thanks. I spawned in with it
7890920	7897480	Uh, if you'd like to visit Glasgow, please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles in the UK
7899240	7900840	Um
7900840	7904840	Maybe I should do that. Maybe I should like plan a trip if you ever came to Scotland
7904920	7907880	And I'll be like you should go here and you should go here because I've been here and I've been there
7908520	7909560	um
7909560	7911560	That'd be cute
7912120	7913560	um
7913560	7915560	The order is an acquired taste. Oh, yeah
7917400	7921320	Stinky, uh-oh stinky. Okay. These are the French
7922200	7928280	What do we think of the French? What do we think of the French? We think they're fish. They smell. Sorry
7929000	7933480	There's like a football chant. That's like, what do we think of the French? I can't remember it
7933480	7935480	But it's like, what do we think of the French?
7935800	7937800	What do we think of the French?
7938840	7942120	And Glasgow is nice while you visit it glad you didn't get stabbed
7943240	7949640	The one of the highest rate places to get stabbed. However, rate is one of the friendliest as well in Europe
7950040	7952040	Of all of Europe. I don't know
7952280	7954280	But
7955080	7959240	Okay, we made it. We made it. We are about to meet Bartolomeo
7959960	7961880	the
7961880	7964200	owner, I guess of the mercenary guild
7972840	7974840	Water check
7975080	7976600	Bartolomeo
7976600	7981400	You have to meet my wife Bianca. Oh, no, fantasy. Yeah, Bianca's a sword. Sorry
7982360	7984360	His sword of his name is Bianca
7984680	7989400	Did you check behind the table? Okay, that's a reference to Assassin's Creed one. Just so you know
7993640	7998920	Pantasy day. Ah, don't mind the bad dude on Chantay
8000440	8004360	I still haven't harassed Amy with my French, uh, Scottish French accent
8006760	8011960	I should force her to make an ASMR French collab with me, but I like purposely put my accent
8012040	8014280	On and she's just cringing in the corner
8016840	8021400	Don't forget to stretch. Yes, uh, I will need to educate you guys
8022680	8026840	On why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit who veins
8030200	8032200	Our position is weak
8032200	8035000	Then we can concentrate our forces on the French round
8036920	8041560	Thank you for disclosing this to me Madonna Dalviano. It is the least that I can do to help her
8043640	8047160	So I will educate you right now my lovely jubblies
8048520	8052040	Did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from
8052760	8056680	Hemorrhoids, which is a failure of a vein in your booty hole
8057240	8061880	As office workers because they sit down for long periods of time. So I always recommend
8062520	8068840	Stretching often or standing up. We are all about to go for a pee break and I recommend you all get up with me
8069560	8075960	Um, sorry that I never explained that mission there if you kill only the captain you get 100 percent super simple easy
8075960	8077960	And you can also pick up a flag on the way
8079000	8083640	Uh, so yes, uh, we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes
8083880	8087240	So I will recommend we stretch roughly every two hours
8087960	8091560	Um, I have no idea how long I've been streaming for but we should probably do it soon
8091720	8097880	Um, the guards will not harass you at this area. It's super easy and you can pick up this a lot of treasure box. It's full
8101480	8107080	Yes, um, uh, it's quite interesting like the knee this sounds absolutely bizarre
8107880	8110520	But the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting
8110920	8114760	Because it's literally just what side am I supposed to climb up? I can't get up there
8115080	8121160	Um, it's literally just a vein in your booty hole. That's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it
8121240	8126840	It's just like adios I'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and
8127400	8129160	You know put it on your butt and then it goes away
8129240	8134280	It's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame. I've like heard stories like people who suffer
8134760	8137400	Uh, you need to like get on operation on your butt
8138120	8139000	but
8139000	8140440	um
8140680	8142440	Yeah
8142440	8143960	I don't know. I just
8143960	8147960	Sorry, I'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and stuff. So, yeah
8152600	8158280	I am not expecting these topics of conversation and sorry, I do apologize. Do we go left or right here? I actually
8158840	8160840	I think yeah, we were supposed to go left
8160840	8162840	Okay
8163800	8167320	The butthole Lord. Yes, you you will have the healthiest booty hole
8168040	8170040	Uh, enjoying my streams
8170360	8171960	because
8171960	8173960	We will have healthy butts together
8174920	8175880	Uh
8175880	8179480	Okay, first synchronize the viewpoint and then ignite the board of tower
8179800	8183640	Do not ignite the board of tower first because the viewpoint will
8184120	8189080	Not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again. Once you have done a tower
8189160	8191160	You never have to go back up it. There is no
8192200	8196760	Treasure chests added on top of the tower. There are no flags added on top of the tower
8198120	8199480	um
8199480	8201480	yes
8202280	8207480	Don't worry. I love every second of your conversation. Yeah, I do like my conversational topic
8208120	8214520	Uh, the game will always give you a way up fast if uh, they've kind of put you in a thingy
8214520	8218840	Because they literally leave you in the water after that sequence and I was like, okay, then I guess
8220120	8224040	We will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse, but a
8224680	8228200	A really strange developmental fact is
8228840	8233320	Um, depending on the horse's color depends on its speed in the game
8234040	8237960	The lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is
8238440	8244280	And then obviously it goes up to all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game
8244680	8250280	I don't know why the developers did it like that. Um, but I noticed it as soon as I like started playing the game
8250360	8253880	I was like, huh, why did they do this? It seems like such a random thing
8254520	8255640	um
8255640	8258440	But we're on a dark brown horse, which is the second fastest
8258440	8264280	So we got here lickety split, but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one
8264760	8267640	Uh, yeah, it'll be so slow in comparison
8268280	8272200	Now that the popes dogs have fled we're talking about horses still, right? Yeah
8274200	8279320	It's dread play the game. I will show you literally. I don't know why the devs don't know
8279320	8282600	Well, that's a true fact. Oh, I don't that's group
8286840	8290840	Oh, yeah, I'm all I can got restricted and I had to pass like a 10
8291560	8295960	Second like 10 captures and I can't be bothered doing it. So my account's just restricted right now
8295960	8297320	I'm so freaking lazy
8297320	8299320	It like makes me do like these 10
8299800	8305160	Things over and over and I failed it the first time and I'm like go ahead and stop playing
8306120	8313160	Like, you know, Phil will I'm a human all I did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it blocked my account again
8313240	8315880	I've done it like three times now. I keep getting it like
8319160	8322120	Horses are like cars red cargo first
8327880	8332440	Again, uh, same thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper
8332520	8338440	I don't know if they get more effective cannot prove that. I don't know if they get more aggressive and successful
8342120	8344120	Bit silly in it. Yes, it's silly
8345160	8348360	BRB got walk home. Please do not get snatched on your way home
8356200	8358200	The red ones go faster
8358520	8360520	So
8364680	8369800	Oh, we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well you get some florns on the side super easy super quick
8369800	8373800	If you unlock your assassin signals and do these really fast, not problem
8379880	8383160	Uh, we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time
8384120	8384920	Okay
8384920	8391320	Now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because if you see the meters
8391400	8397720	It says we're 1000 meters away. We go to the island Tiberina. That's the closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment
8400040	8402040	Yeah, it wasn't kind of the market
8403720	8405240	Is that that might be true
8405240	8411640	I actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you under your the higher like tier you are with them
8412600	8414600	We
8414920	8416680	If
8416680	8422520	Jesus almost just killed myself from that board there. You're goodness. All right. They came out near we have
8423160	8427960	We do have to run for this but again, unless I take this guy's horse. You don't want mine now
8429480	8431480	Thank you very much
8433240	8434760	Please okay, my way
8434760	8439400	So this is the problem if the if you gallop through crowds the horse will fall over
8439480	8442600	But if you just sprint through crowds the horse won't fall over
8443640	8446200	Um, literally we committed grand theft horse
8446760	8448120	Say
8448120	8453800	Apologies to that guy. He probably spent thousands of florns on the horse and I've just ran away with it
8454360	8456360	And you get to keep the horse
8457480	8462120	Uh, I've still not unlocked targets. So we're not gonna do that. We're just gonna swim across the water really quick
8463560	8468280	We the pirate ship always stays after you have done that. I don't know why
8469720	8475560	But the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission. So it's not like a massive waste
8475800	8481960	So we are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we call on it
8481960	8486840	It's gonna try and okay. There we go. We're out of range. So we can spawn in the horse at any point
8487000	8491400	But uh, it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't
8491880	8496760	So you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side
8497640	8501320	Fuckin hell this horse is zooming. My god. What kind of hay did we give it?
8503480	8508040	It's so fat. Why are we going so fat? I need to help it. Oh my god
8509080	8514840	That was dangerous. Oh, that was dangerous. Like didn't even got a helmet on. He's not even got any crash pads on
8515640	8519000	I'm surprised to see you. This is Laval pay the owner of the tea skilled
8520360	8522360	Horse doping honestly
8522360	8527000	The answer you always do you want to put my spies to work
8528040	8530040	Sippy check
8531400	8535640	No, thank you. The horse be like gotta go fast. Should have made it blue like sannic
8536440	8538440	a serious allegation
8540120	8542120	Bang bang
8542280	8544280	Give a wee baggie to the horse
8544520	8546520	Wee baggie is slang for
8547480	8549800	I also know he abandoned you right before the
8549800	8554600	Yeah, I think you can you can get the rest from there. He is an assassin
8555240	8557240	Not a traitor
8557240	8561400	I am not convinced. What a wee baggie means
8566280	8568200	Care to accompany me
8568200	8574360	So Laval pay thinks that marquia velly is a traitor to the assassin's guild
8574600	8580680	Which is the reason why Laval pay refuses to communicate with marquia velly
8581560	8585800	Can I get a horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get
8587560	8589560	Let's go
8589560	8593400	Right, let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way
8594760	8596440	um
8596440	8601880	After this we gain notoriety unfortunately, which means they're going to be
8602840	8608920	Posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too a bit too much and they're always like above
8611160	8612840	Money
8612840	8616440	How we are we're at six thousand that's not honestly, that's not bad
8617560	8620280	Um, we are going to try and get a crossbow ball
8620440	8622840	You can unlock a crossbow ball just like the archers
8623240	8630120	But you need to pay for it and I think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings
8630680	8637080	Like boot. I keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example. Um, it does like
8637720	8642760	It adds up over time, but it kind of is a bit difficult
8643000	8648120	It's better to like save your money for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after
8651240	8654280	Oh, you like my twitter picture. Yeah. Yeah, I totally made it myself
8656280	8658280	I did not
8658280	8660840	I didn't make it at all. I yanked it
8662040	8663560	Okay, okay
8663560	8665560	This pay attention
8665560	8668680	Look at his body and look at him holding his arm
8669160	8673080	Please make note of this as his and what sounds crazy
8673400	8677720	But i'm going to talk about reusing assets and how genius it is in video game development
8678840	8685000	Okay, so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm. Please keep this in your mind. Okay. Let's see if I can shoot everyone
8685240	8687240	You first
8687800	8689800	Right you next
8690040	8691720	Right you next
8691720	8693720	Okay, you know
8694040	8696040	How about you? Okay. Oh
8697800	8699000	Oh
8699000	8701000	Hey, let's go, baby
8704040	8709640	Do you guys see the behind of the scenes and lord of the rings where gimley's like right you first right you next you'll come to me
8709640	8713080	I'll beat you up right you next right you next. That's basically what we just did
8713560	8717320	Okay, now this section is actually super easy. It was really hard at first
8717560	8721560	We might get caught because i'm it's he gets lost so quickly
8722280	8728440	But basically you have to hide here and then we're going to wait for a group to walk up
8729240	8732120	And then they will see that group there
8732760	8735560	That's coming towards us. We hide in that group and then that's it
8735640	8739160	We've done this section of the game, but please make a note of his body
8739720	8742040	How he's holding his arm and he's kind of hunched over
8742600	8745480	Because i'm going to show you a reused asset you might not know about
8745960	8750920	Wait, why why is that group highlighted? Hold on a minute. Am I supposed to be with the other? There's too many groups
8751480	8752600	Please
8752600	8754600	Please okay you
8755400	8761640	Okay, I hate this bit because the tree gets in the way. Yes, you heard me right the tree gets in the way and breaks up the group often
8762600	8764600	But we're just gonna blend in
8765560	8769720	Don't look at us guards. We're just citizens. I'm a monk
8770600	8774040	Amen, amen. I don't know what monks say
8775560	8777400	And then
8777400	8779400	Oh, excuse me
8779480	8781480	You are right there and he's like
8782200	8785880	That could have desynchronized because he got caught on those people. I'm not even kidding
8791400	8793400	Analysing asset analizing
8794360	8797080	Will this asset be reused later? Yes, it will
8801240	8803240	You know how to disappear
8813320	8817800	Okay, we are going to take a pee break right after we've done this bit because I need to pee
8818040	8820040	He he he
8820360	8823560	And i'm gonna get more water because i'm out of water already
8824280	8826280	So these are witnesses
8826520	8830040	We lose 75 percent notoriety if we do that
8830520	8832840	And we are also going to complete a thieves challenge
8833320	8840760	Which is drum roll, please is to pickpocket 500 florins and a really quick way to do it is by this
8841560	8843560	You pick bribe him 500
8844280	8845720	And then yank
8845800	8847800	Easy come easy go, baby
8849240	8856600	Uh and then oh, I still have notoriety. Um, that's not supposed to happen. It's supposed to disappear at this point
8857000	8863400	Excuse me whilst I kill this other witness. Oh, no, there's guards. You know what? I can deal with the guards. Yank
8868040	8870040	Ah
8870120	8874840	I'm a good citizen. I promise. I'm just a scary scary monk
8875800	8877800	You've got the wrong man
8878680	8883080	Everyone else wears hoodies. Okay, it's not just me. Oh, I'm like running into more enemies
8884120	8892200	Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold the phone. Hold pause. Pause. Pause. Oh pause pause pause
8892760	8897080	We did it. We did it. We snuck on him. Oh my god, we snuck up on him
8897560	8902520	Oh my god, it's normally so hard to do talk about opportunistic killing my goodness
8902600	8905640	Okay, we've just secured her like a third board to tower
8906680	8909960	Oh my goodness. I can't believe the timing just happened
8911800	8917400	Oh, that was perfect timing. I could not have asked for better. Oh my god, I could not have asked for better
8917480	8919800	Is he still trying to oh he just drowned. Okay
8920600	8923000	Oh, that was amazing. I'm so happy with that
8924600	8930280	Okay, we're gonna burn this tower. There are a few archers on the roof, but uh, they're not too much of a bother
8930600	8932600	All right, you can just kind of you know
8933320	8936440	Unfortunately, you do have this one's a bit more awkward. You have to like
8938040	8941320	You have to like kill him and then you have to go up there and kill this guy too
8941400	8946360	And it's a bit annoying to navigate. Whoopsie. Oh, wow. I made that jump
8947880	8950440	There's a guard down there, but you don't have to kill him if you don't
8951800	8953800	Get down. No
8954680	8957320	I will take your get down get down. Oh my god
8960360	8962360	Oh
8962600	8967320	You know that song that Japanese one you heard of this you heard of that thing
8969880	8973880	Oh, maybe if we get 3d models, we can all do that trend get down
8979000	8983800	Right, we need to find the synchronization point for the map boom synchronization
8985400	8987240	Yeah
8987240	8991000	I used to watch a lot of hadsunimiki MMDs
8991800	8995160	Like dance and stuff and that was the first ever exposure
8999400	9001400	Pretty much I got
9004040	9006040	So I have another sipping tin of cola
9010840	9013240	Oh, my ankle just cracked. I don't know if you heard that
9014200	9016760	If I got picked up in the make my ankle just cracked
9018040	9020040	Because I'm sitting on my 15th
9020600	9026200	I'm wiggling my toes right now. That's right. What are you going to do? You're going to try and stop me? Exactly. You can't
9027000	9029000	I'm just a little toe wiggler
9032120	9037960	Okay, uh, we'll get a horse. We'll complete this next but I think we have to defend the thieves guild and upgrade it
9037960	9043080	And then that was I was done with DNA sequence three question marks
9043560	9045560	Ah
9047000	9049640	There are nine dna sequences in this game
9050280	9056200	And they're all perfectly leveled out, but we are getting very close to being out of the tutorial section very very close
9057560	9059400	I believe
9059400	9061240	after act
9061240	9063240	five
9063240	9065960	We are officially a tutorial and his own

9159480	9164280	Especially, but we gamble all the money before I go for a pee just for the heck of it

9251960	9254200	Oh, well
9254200	9260520	Okay, is this the end of the sequence? No, okay, we're gonna unlock the place
9261080	9268440	Roma is doomed literally can't play landlord simulator in assassin's creed brotherhood. I am doomed
9270280	9272680	The house always wins do not gamble
9273720	9278040	Did I tell you that one time I got offered a lot of money to do a gamble at
9280520	9285160	True story, uh, it was one of the biggest sponsorship offers I've ever received
9285800	9291000	And I saw they offered the money first like in the email. They were like, this is how much we'll pay you
9291560	9293560	um, and I was like
9293800	9299800	Oh my god, I've never never been paid that much money before and then it was a gamble ad and I'm like, oh, that's that is why
9300280	9301720	uh, so yeah
9301720	9311960	How much money uh four thousand us dollars for a one minute advertising segment of a gamble advert a site
9312920	9314920	The biggest offer I've ever had
9315480	9319480	Uh, which was pretty insane. Uh, so we're just gonna finish the sequence and then we're all gonna be
9320760	9322280	Yes
9322280	9323720	and
9323720	9326760	But will it pay for all the fallout? Yeah, literally, uh
9327800	9329800	I was I'm like
9330680	9332680	Obviously some people are
9335400	9337400	You got it from a guard good guess
9342280	9344280	To terrorize roma
9344600	9348200	How do I find them? I can give you a general location
9348840	9355080	I suggest looking for signs of distress nearby. Oh, perhaps you will uncover citizens. This isn't the end of the sequence
9356600	9360600	I'm gonna wet myself. I'm not gonna lie. I've had like three glasses now
9364600	9367480	Okay, I think I just need to hire two more recruits and then we can all go pee

9428280	9430280	Okay
9432520	9435480	It absolutely does not come across like that, but my brain
9438600	9447320	Okay, it's this act almost done. Yes, we're gonna fix the aqueducts in roma as well. The briefings are right here
9452360	9454360	Can I say something really bad

9464120	9466120	homemade slime
9468840	9470840	I don't know if that's terrible or not
9471720	9477240	But like I thought it would be funny if it was like you can have apple juice or homemade slime
9477320	9479480	What would you like from this the cuttlefish?
9480040	9482040	Um
9483640	9488600	Because and it would be extra funny because I actually have really smelly apple juice
9489960	9491960	So someone can inhale it and be like
9495320	9500520	Okay, we did it fix her upper act four is when we get the brotherhood together officially
9500680	9505320	I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll actually generate us income a den of thieves
9505320	9507320	I have apps. I can't even remember what's in them
9510280	9513800	Oh, no, is this when we go to the castello? I think this is a castello mission
9514280	9518840	Right, I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll generate me some money in the background
9519160	9524920	Please everyone, uh, get yourself new drinks if you need water or fizzy juice or whatever you may drink at the moment
9525240	9530840	Um, please get up and stretch. I am with your peep. I will be roughly three minutes. I'm gonna maybe get a snack
9530920	9537160	I actually boil this I boiled some eggs in preparation of this stream so I can grab a boiled egg and eat
9537320	9539320	There's a snack
9539560	9543880	Because I don't have time to like make fit fit so I have boiled eggs. Okay, right
9543880	9546360	I'm gonna let the game run in the background, but I'll meet my mic and all that jazz
9547000	9551800	I'll open it like I'll open the game back up. So it's not just like pause pause, but I go pee

9952840	9958120	Actually can't remember what happens in this sequence. My brain is blanking
9962680	9968920	Well, it looks like I certainly should have taken the aqueduct because all right, we're going into the castello. Okay
9969640	9971640	we're about to go

10006200	10008200	I
10008440	10010440	That's what I didn't want to happen
10010840	10012840	because I'm literally just trying to get into
10013480	10015480	a memory right now
10015560	10019800	Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything. Right. Well, that was your fault. You could have ignored me, but no no
10020040	10022040	Oh, are they still looking for me?
10022840	10028600	So that indicator means they're still looking but they've not been coded to come down the stairs or something because yeah
10028600	10030600	They should have came down there, but they didn't
10031400	10033240	Well, I ain't complaining. I never got in trouble. He
10034200	10036200	Fuck you now. Do you see that flashbang?
10037800	10040680	How does Haggis taste? I actually really like it. Um
10041880	10043880	She whore of fourly
10050440	10052440	I drinking lots of water to stop the neon
10063560	10065560	Don't speak ill of the border
10067320	10069640	It was Haggis. Haggis is a meat dish
10074360	10076360	Keep your eyes on her eyes
10081800	10083800	Girl spitting fire
10085240	10088680	Haggis is a meat dish a native national
10090840	10092840	It's not a national dish, I don't think
10092840	10094600	Um
10094600	10096840	Who goes there? Um by the pope, um
10098680	10103000	Sorry, I ain't and I had a bit of water. So that didn't work. Um
10104600	10105880	It is
10105880	10108840	I believe sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up
10109400	10114840	Uh, and it's quite peppery and quite a peppery dish. Um, it's really nice
10115480	10121880	Uh, you might have heard the phrase neeps and tatties. That means potatoes and turnip and it's just like a nice mash together
10121960	10127320	It's really nice. I like it. Okay. So this one's like don't get caught but I couldn't be
10127880	10133800	What will do the do not the don't get detected later because I actually don't even know how to do it
10133800	10138360	So we're going to do it for the first time together. I've never done this section without being caught. So
10139720	10143240	I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply
10144360	10148360	Isn't Haggis a wee rodent? Oh, I is a wee animal. Um
10152440	10155480	She cannot waver Haggis is mainly pork, is it?
10158680	10164200	I don't think it's easily accessible like outside of the united kingdom
10165320	10171880	Um, it is referred to as blood pudding. Oh, no, that's black. Uh, black pudding is different. Um
10173000	10175320	For breakfast we do like, um
10176680	10181400	It's a discus. So on the way I just a discus of um
10182200	10186040	It's called black pudding, but Americans refer to as blood pudding
10186120	10191800	But it is made of blood. So I do understand why they call it that. It's just we call it. It just sounds a bit barbaric
10192360	10194440	But at the same time it's like, well, we are eating
10196120	10198120	You know, I mean
10198120	10200120	No one cares
10201480	10205320	Greetings greetings. You really say greens?
10205640	10207640	Uh
10208440	10214440	Right, let's kill him from above. Thank you very much. We are gonna have to come back on this
10216760	10220120	Haggis is a savory pudding containing sheep's
10221640	10224600	Sheep's pluck minced with chopped onion oatmeal
10225240	10228360	Spices and salt mixed with stock and cooked with traditional
10229480	10232680	I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go
10233560	10237240	I actually played this game so many times. I'm like completely sequenced out the weather
10239080	10244120	But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section without being caught without a crossbow
10244200	10246760	I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory
10248440	10253160	Oh, no, go away. See that's the oh my god. No, no, no
10255000	10257880	By the skin of our teeth
10258680	10260680	Did that man not shoot?
10261320	10264120	Oh my gosh
10265640	10267640	By this skill
10268120	10272280	By the skin of our teeth by our gamer skills as well. Yes, I give it to my gamers
10274280	10278040	Oh my gosh, must have been the wind literally
10279640	10281640	Their brother and sister by the way
10282600	10284600	Oh
10290280	10292440	How it looks so
10292440	10294440	I'd rather like it open myself
10297480	10300360	Have you talked to the pope about the funds requested by my banker
10301160	10305560	He is away from the castello. I do need some convincing when he returns
10306440	10308440	That shouldn't be a problem
10309400	10311400	I wish that was me for real for real
10315560	10317560	It's a little time together
10319160	10321160	Other conquests
10329880	10332760	We'll be a thing of the past. I shout baby

10352920	10354920	Imagine if I went the wrong way
10355560	10360280	Right now, right. So hold B and then yeah, you just grab on to everything you can kind of speak things of it
10361240	10363240	And

10384840	10386840	What do we need to go up
10387480	10391560	Square sausage. I miss square sausage if you didn't know
10392120	10397560	In cheeky scotland for breakfast you do square sausage and it's literally a square of sausage meat
10398680	10404360	And it's that wish it I have it on a roll way onion. How is the journey to roma?
10406200	10413160	I can't remember your pathetic lucrezia. What did he talk about his plans for napoli? Did you like it?
10413160	10416040	I can't remember. Perhaps you will remember this
10417720	10419720	That's what you in your place
10419720	10421720	Whamming on whamming violence
10423560	10425560	It can't be

10445400	10447960	Please that actually really hurt. Please don't do that again
10448520	10450520	Lucrezia Borgia
10450760	10456920	Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right you can be like not detected by the guards somehow
10457080	10459720	Yeah, like literally he doesn't yeah
10460280	10465240	So at least we know that for when we do play the 100 not detection segment
10466040	10468440	And then there should be a guard to our left
10470920	10474200	Well, we we don't need to not be detected right now. So it's fine
10476040	10478040	The safe word is more
10478280	10481080	What do you think is still it was being the safe word for
10482200	10484200	a sheep's skate
10485880	10491800	Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him and then that'll be how we won't get detected surely
10493960	10495960	Yay castello crash
10499880	10503000	Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce
10503800	10507000	Is a bit of harry polter sauce with hp
10507960	10509960	It's that sauce or ketchup
10511160	10513160	I'm gonna say something really dumb
10513560	10515560	I don't know the difference between
10516120	10519080	Tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup
10519800	10522040	Ain't they the sale? Aren't they the same?
10523000	10525000	Aren't they the same?
10525800	10529960	Phil's sink failed. Yes, we will be coming back to fully sink at later thing right now
10530280	10535080	Um, oh my god that per guy. I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here
10536280	10538040	um
10538040	10540840	Brand one has sugar one doesn't
10542360	10544680	I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then
10546440	10550280	Uh, this is this section can be a little bit finicky. Uh
10553160	10555160	I want to sing it from the heavens
10560360	10563480	Who knows what he would do these holes in loyal
10568680	10570680	He killed my my husband. Oh
10572040	10574040	For real for real
10575960	10579000	Nope ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients. Oh my god, not kidding
10579800	10585960	She got a point ketchup has a ton of sugar. Okay, whatever the sugary one was. I like it. Okay, brain says yum
10590120	10592120	Yes, oh
10592200	10594200	She playing she said
10594760	10597880	Guess what? I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here
10601720	10607640	He loves me. No, I don't think he loves you him. Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff
10610280	10612280	Hello
10612680	10614680	Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes
10615320	10617320	Wow
10618920	10620920	Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack
10626120	10628120	He would have enjoyed this guards
10630280	10635800	Jump on you and say, oh, that's what happens in the ASMR booth. Well stays in the boost. Well happens with boost stays in the booth
10637560	10642840	I see that premium pass around your neck. Yank. I'm jumping on you. Okay. Thanks for supporting me
10643000	10646840	All right, we're just gonna have to wait for these guys to attack because they are such a nightmare
10648760	10652280	Literally it's just so much faster to let them attack and then
10656440	10658440	Right, oh
10658520	10660520	I think I just next
10662040	10664040	The jump scare
10665080	10667080	Foxy jump scare
10668360	10670360	Princesses from castles now
10671320	10673720	All right, all right, right
10673880	10678920	So this is really awkward if Lucretia gets away like back to that starting station
10679560	10683400	She will spawn out of bounds and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it
10683400	10686680	And you have to restart this section again. It's so annoying
10687560	10692040	Uh, thankfully, uh, the last few times I've played this game. It's not happened
10692360	10694360	But when it does happen is so annoying
10695240	10697560	Oh my god, it's so annoying Lucretia
10698360	10706440	Um, if you can get excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down and you just whacked me with that freaking weapon. Stop it
10707720	10709720	You're upsetting me
10709960	10717160	Don't upset me. Oh my god. Please do not do a finishing move if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move to look
10717240	10719240	Really good
10719720	10721720	The passing was your hand was finished
10723080	10725080	And their memories are raced
10725320	10727320	Oh no, the tombstones are raced
10732840	10737160	Uh, see she does that see if she jumps out you have to go grab her
10737800	10744200	However, if the people are attacking you then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them
10745000	10749720	Oh my god, is she actually getting away? I'm getting nervous. Stop. I'm getting nervous. Okay. No, she's she's saying so
10749960	10751960	Stop it. Lucretia. Lucretia

10773320	10775320	Didn't I? I don't face it
10775320	10777320	But I'm willing to see them
10779080	10781960	Okay, that's right. That's right. Just accept that
10784760	10786760	This is so weird. I'm sorry

10826520	10829240	Hey smart camera bin. Yes, we are going out the front
10830200	10832200	Okay
10832200	10837480	Do not be detected again another do not be detected, but there's two guards literally dead ahead
10837480	10840680	How am I not to be detected by them when we play this for real?
10841560	10843560	Did they come in here?
10843880	10846840	No, this cannot be. Did they actually come in here?
10849640	10851640	Okay one
10852120	10854120	Is
10855720	10861720	No, okay, how am I supposed to deal with two of them at once when we do it for real?
10864040	10871320	Uh, you better calm down hen. I'm rescuing you Christina. Didn't get on at me about taking so long. Where are you going?
10873320	10875320	Catarina
10876680	10880600	I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams. Oh, it's just absolute word vomit. I promise you
10881000	10883000	Absolutely, nothing makes sense
10883000	10888520	Uh, my accent gets a little off the wee bit when I like whisper, but it's not really a big deal. Like I can make it like I can
10889160	10891160	enhance
10894200	10896200	All about that
10897320	10901320	Yes, yes, yes, I know you gave me your hole so I'd protect you. It's oh
10902360	10905560	Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye
10905720	10907720	Bye
10907960	10909960	I do be a really skilled assassin
10911640	10913640	Ready
10915800	10917800	Don't you dare
10922120	10924760	He's just like me for real for real. He literally went
10928280	10930440	We're actually it's an auditory confirmed
10933160	10935160	Never do that to me again
10936120	10940600	Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff. It's all torn at the bottom
10941240	10943240	Oh, also you can walk on barrels
10943800	10947000	If you wanted to know that you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people
10949640	10952360	It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it
10953880	10960360	Okay, we pop you down there pet the eagle and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle all for you, mate
10960920	10962920	and we just pick up the lady again
10963720	10965720	And then basically
10966120	10970440	If you pop her down in the middle, I think you can access both gates without losing
10971080	10972280	distance
10972280	10975640	It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her
10976280	10978280	But
10979480	10980760	Um
10980760	10985800	No, I was gonna walk away. I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life
10986440	10993160	How could you be such a silly you know, I think we actually might have to move her over. Whoa
10993960	10995960	Did you guys see what I just saw?
10996840	11002920	Oh, leave me alone. No, no, you don't see me. I'm just going up the stairs. I'm just a tourist. I'm a fissure. Okay. I'm a fissure of the
11005000	11009240	I thought I was gonna desync there. I got scared. I thought I was gonna
11011400	11013960	I saw her her panties
11015800	11019560	And I didn't even have to pay anything. I saw them for free
11022120	11027960	Wait, can that guy see me again? Oh, uh, I think we're gonna have to do the old uh ear assassination
11029800	11035080	All right, can we hey, uh, excuse me sir sir. I just moved over to do an ear assassination. Thank you
11036200	11038200	Okay, there we go
11038280	11041400	The audio is strange again. It better not be
11041720	11043720	Why
11047480	11050680	Why I literally nothing has changed
11053080	11060360	I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times. Okay, so it's gonna like pause and then open back up and pause and open back up
11065400	11067880	There's a steak noise sound like a steak review
11068760	11073160	If I have to close the game again, I will
11076440	11083000	A decent warning like it sounds perfectly fine for me still there
11091720	11095160	Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now it's still buzzing
11095960	11098200	Do you know what buzzing means in scott's it means you're really
11101080	11108360	A feature I know has this you can just restart the audio capture. I mean right hold on controversial move. I know
11111640	11115800	How does that sound does that sound normal?
11118600	11121480	I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game
11122440	11129720	Okay, I I can know you're literally gonna hear if one of the girls DM me on discord. That's the only thing
11132280	11135640	Okay, let's get across rich risky. I know you're all gonna know that I'm
11136360	11139320	I've I've arranged another ASMR collab
11139960	11143640	Uh, like literally 30 minutes before the stream started
11144200	11149400	I like burst into someone's DMs on twitter and I was like, hey girls. Do you want to add me?
11150360	11154360	I thought I was talking to her about ASMR collab and I've already planned it
11155160	11158520	It's not a big ASMR it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah
11159800	11163080	Okay, uh, we have a timer. We basically just have to survive
11163720	11169160	So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again, but it gets a bit iffy
11170680	11172680	It's not the best. I will mess up
11173640	11178040	And we're the enemies go away citizen. I don't want to kill anymore
11180360	11185640	Uh, I'm going to try and kill the wee guys first because they grab me like that and ruin my streak
11189000	11191000	Okay, sorry, I'm focusing
11191000	11195400	See when they grab you it takes you out of your kill streak advantage and there's lancers as well
11195400	11198040	I can see that lancer. I'm going to try and take him out in the kill streak
11198920	11200680	okay
11200680	11204120	I'm trying to get the lancer and it keeps all into the other guys
11205800	11207080	Come on
11207080	11208840	wee guy next
11209560	11215320	Armor guy next I guess he's probably the best, but okay. I can't break his armor. So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy
11217560	11219000	Okay
11219000	11224440	We're getting there. We're getting there 30 more seconds. Do not grab me. I hate when they grab me. Oh
11225000	11227800	No, no, no, not the horse. Not the horse. Not the horse
11230040	11232280	I said I'm hiding from the horse get me in the hay bale
11233880	11238440	I'm scared of the horses. I actually don't know how to take down horse guys
11239720	11244680	Ah, ouch. Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy. We've got seven seconds
11244840	11248680	We just need to not get hit because we can run away in two seconds
11249720	11252040	Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
11257080	11259080	Oh my god
11259320	11265400	Okay, so in this sequence you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map if you come on the roof
11266360	11269800	Uh, you can basically run along it as much as you need
11270360	11277000	Or if you don't like rooftop scaling there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range
11280840	11284760	Bruh, bruh get off my roof. No
11285480	11291640	Uh, and then if we disappear in the water, maybe I think we can hide in the water
11292440	11294440	You can like literally hide in the water
11295880	11297880	I'm a call fish. Let's go
11298840	11300840	Can they see me?
11300840	11302360	I'm
11302360	11311400	Physically, yes, they can see me, but uh game development wise. No, they can't so uh, I enjoyed that do that again more game, please
11313560	11317480	Okay, we're gonna kill this guy. Sorry. I'm sorry mate. Your time is up
11317480	11319480	Oh
11319640	11322200	I forget. Okay. If you scare away
11322920	11327800	You won't be able to right. We're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site
11328280	11334840	Um, if you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you. Um, and it is very oh the poster is down here
11334920	11339400	I have been I've been fooled. The egg is on my face. Uh
11340280	11342280	right
11342600	11344600	We need to now go back to
11345560	11347560	The island tied out
11348120	11349880	because
11349880	11351880	Catarina's forces
11352520	11353560	and
11353560	11359400	Then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it
11359960	11363080	And everything is so cool. Everything's so awesome
11365080	11367320	Uh, we're just gonna all right. Here we go yank
11368600	11371080	He said enough a young come on for her enough
11372360	11374040	enough
11374120	11376040	Is it enough?
11376040	11378040	Don't you not want to give more?
11382440	11386360	Okay, this is the only problem when navigating what a horse you have to can
11386920	11391240	You're like stuck to using whatever roads have passed out and it gets really um
11392440	11394040	finicky
11394040	11396040	It's a bit
11397080	11399080	You know what I mean? Is this a bank? Have I unlocked it?
11404200	11407080	How would you bother you just gone down to it folks?
11408600	11410600	If you come on the roof should you click?
11411960	11414440	I never even said that that was you that said that
11415240	11422120	Normally, I'm the one coming out with the outrageous. Uh, I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank
11425320	11429800	Hey horse, can you come out here? Thanks appreciate it like oh, okay
11434120	11437720	Oh, we made 1.5 Florence
11438280	11440280	That's pretty good
11440280	11444200	I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that i'm hoping to get it by
11444760	11450600	Uh, I don't know why we lost all our money. Don't know how it happened something something don't gamble at home people. Uh
11452040	11454040	But may have lost all our money in that
11454280	11456760	Uh, right where is the bridge?
11457800	11459800	Bridge is over here. Okay
11461080	11463080	Got a stile in them peasants
11464040	11466760	Horse is the first customer of the store for real for real
11467480	11469480	Munching on that. Hey
11472760	11474760	Okay, we have made it to the island
11477160	11481640	Never gamble with your own money gamble with someone else's that's terrible. Don't gamble all
11483080	11485080	Save that mula
11486680	11491000	Get yourself a weave as ages from the corner shop. Maybe are we bakery? Are we scorn?
11494360	11497640	Looking for it in the bank. What's the cesarean rodrigo?
11498440	11503320	Cesarei rode out before I could get close to him and rodrigo was somewhere else entirely
11504280	11505880	That is odd
11505880	11507880	rodrigo is normally at the castle
11508760	11510760	Very odd indeed
11511000	11513640	What a waste so levopey thinks
11514600	11518360	That marky velly tipped off cesarean to leave the castle
11519240	11521240	So we're all suspicious right now
11522200	11528840	Impossible cesarei commands a massive army in romagna. You would never reach. Thank you. I say we work here
11529400	11530520	What?
11530520	11533240	They rode the borja's influence while restoring our own
11533880	11538840	And in fact, I want to make it right now. Yes. We're doing it
11540440	11542440	Machiavelli, meet me outside
11543320	11545320	Take care of her
11546040	11551000	We're doing it. We're about to get the brotherhood. Come on reeflings. I want to turn you guys into assassins
11552200	11554200	I'm gonna turn you to deadly weapons
11555080	11558040	The borja rob everything from the people to maintain power
11559160	11561160	What do you intend to do?
11561160	11566120	We will recruit him to our cause. You cannot be serious to win this war machiavelli
11566200	11570600	Win the loyal soldiers. Come on reeflings. You'd let me draft you right?
11572760	11574760	All right, let's get drafted
11576040	11580520	I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield. Okay. I'm healing you guys on the battlefield
11581320	11583320	with my
11583880	11588040	Oh my god, the cutscene took so long that wait
11589160	11596040	Whoa, I've never seen this happen for two recruits spawned and the cutscene took so long. They both died in the instance
11596600	11598440	Oh my god
11598440	11601560	All right, she's still alive. Let's save her. Oh my god
11602520	11608840	It's shrek and no, no, no, no. We've just attracted more guards. This is terrible. She has incredibly low health
11609080	11610280	Oh
11610280	11613080	Goodness me. Oh goodness me. Oh goodness gravy
11614120	11618680	Please don't perish. I hope she doesn't perish because we're actually gonna have to okay. We she didn't perish like goodness
11620200	11622200	Already sold my life
11622680	11624680	What did you sell your life to?
11626280	11628280	Sin
11629800	11633800	It's a lady assassin. You'll never guess what I do to the lady
11634280	11639560	Okay, we're gonna open up the map and the map will tell us where the next recruit is so we can go recruit this person
11641720	11644760	And now we are about to unlock
11645480	11651000	Assassin recruit signals, which means in the middle of a fight we can literally ask the game to help us
11651640	11653800	And there's also a really fun minigame
11654280	11658440	Where you can level them up and make them even stronger to the point where they can fight
11658600	11661960	Incredibly strong enemies and it is so satisfying
11662600	11668120	Watching their health bars go up. Oh, look, I have it already actually. I'm gonna use it for
11668680	11672600	This citizen if I can get to them in time before they perish
11673560	11675560	and
11675880	11680120	Uh, here we go. Oh, it's another lady. Oh my god. We're like doing all ladies in this
11680840	11683320	Assassin group. Oh, oops my bad
11684040	11686040	You can't really oh
11686520	11691800	Oh, okay. Oh, hold on. Let me go. Let me get up. Okay. We're oh my gosh
11692280	11695160	This has increased brotherhood more like the sisterhood
11696120	11698120	Am I right? Ha ha
11701320	11704680	Hopefully we can get a few guys in here. We need to repopulate roma. You know what I'm saying?
11706520	11710680	Uh, let's unlock the doctors because we can get more money in general
11711640	11716520	The strong door calls for aid. Oh, me on Christmas like
11718280	11720280	Okay, I have a new lead base cure for syphilis
11721320	11723320	What did he say?
11725480	11729960	I don't think I've ever heard that. I've got a new lead base cure for syphilis
11730760	11732760	I didn't know that was in the game
11733640	11735640	That's outrageous
11735720	11740840	Right, we're going to go pick up this other assassin recruit because they're like a hundred meters away
11741720	11749080	Uh, that's absolutely hilarious. Um, and we're also going to send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission
11749880	11756360	Which is how you level up the assassins and you get a stupendous amount of money for it. Um
11757400	11765560	So I get 650 florns for six minutes. I send this person away for so this is your biggest money maker is sending your assassin recruits away
11766120	11771320	Um, so we may be able to get the crossbow ball if I dilly dally and do a few safe place things
11771960	11775400	Uh, or we can just brush through the it's not really brushing because
11776200	11778440	It's just playing the campaign. But yeah
11779960	11782920	I'll have to say nothing is true. Everything is permitted for real
11784520	11790040	I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction. Where's the citizen?
11791000	11795080	Oh, they're already fighting. Oh the citizen might die
11796360	11804360	Oh, why is this building so tall? Oh, can I get them? Can I save you? I'm coming. I'm coming
11805320	11811720	I'm helping I'm helping okay. We got it. We got it. We got it. Okay. Good. Oh, no, there's more guards that come in
11811880	11813880	Oh, I don't know how low his hp is
11814440	11819400	The recruits. Oh the recruits. The recruits are so bad at the game as well. I'm so bad at the game
11820440	11823080	Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. No
11823080	11824960	Oh, oh, oh, come on, you can do it.
11824960	11828160	Okay, oh, oh, we did it.
11828160	11830240	I instantly, you want to pick up the recruit
11830240	11833160	because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.
11833160	11836000	Mirigracia, Mirigracia, Mirigracia.
11836000	11837920	And for the right reasons, it seems.
11837920	11840760	Could you use another blade by your side?
11840760	11842880	Weapon of instruction.
11842880	11844280	Achievements, brotherhood.
11847580	11848720	If we had gamer score,
11848720	11851160	we'd probably have like 200 venerals.
11851160	11853680	Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.
11853680	11855040	We've done three places,
11855040	11857440	so we're allowed to have three recruits.
11857440	11859520	We've done four places, excuse me,
11859520	11861600	so we're allowed to have four recruits.
11862560	11864120	I literally just remembered.
11865760	11870040	We can go to the main quest, which is down here.
11870040	11874080	There's actually someone we can recruit over here.
11874080	11875680	Nah, we'll go to the main quest
11875680	11877000	and we'll pick up recruits on the way.
11877000	11878600	We've got a fill bar of recruits.
11878600	11880280	Unfortunately, they're very weak,
11880320	11881680	so it's not very good.
11881680	11883360	I'm chasing after you, my recruits.
11885520	11888960	It's not very good to send them to battle
11888960	11891080	without kind of leveling them up first,
11891080	11893560	because your recruits can perish in a fight,
11893560	11894640	unironically.
11897600	11899720	Yeah, your assassins can die.
11899720	11901160	It's very dangerous.
11905320	11907060	Across the bridges are our first mission.
11907060	11908800	These missions are all based around calling
11908840	11911200	your assassin recruits in,
11911200	11914240	but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds
11914240	11916760	to refresh from when they disappear,
11916760	11917920	not from when you call them in,
11917920	11919760	from when they disappear off the map.
11920760	11925760	And some of the missions, they take a hot second.
11925840	11929040	It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,
11929040	11930760	so the more Borgia towers you destroy,
11930760	11932520	the more recruits you're allowed,
11932520	11936560	and you've got a maximum of three bars,
11936600	11940200	so six Borgia towers.
11940200	11942160	Where the heck am I going?
11942160	11944520	Oh, this one, I remember.
11944520	11947800	Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.
11947800	11950320	Oh, my fatal.
11950320	11953000	This is another multiplayer character that we kill.
11954000	11957280	We must follow the hose.
11958480	11961200	So they will point to where we need to go,
11961200	11963680	but I have played this game many a time now,
11963680	11966480	so you can't just keep running in general.
11967320	11969880	Running, running, running, running, running,
11969880	11972800	running, running, running, running.
11972800	11975640	Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,
11975640	11978960	and we should get a taity sum of money for doing so.
11979800	11983160	So running, running, running, running.
11983160	11985320	I've actually never tried to break this sequence
11985320	11987920	and go outside of what the girls point you to.
11988840	11990840	Um, yeah.
11990840	11994080	So I've called my recruit.
11994080	11995400	I don't know where she is.
11995400	11996720	She's taking her sweet time, right?
11996720	11997720	There you go.
11997720	11999240	Get him!
11999240	12001800	And then we've 100% of that already.
12001800	12002640	I'm going to shower.
12002640	12005040	Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.
12005040	12006040	I'm teasing.
12006040	12007160	Enjoy your shower.
12007160	12008600	Don't forget to do your belly button
12008600	12009760	and behind your ears.
12009760	12011600	A lot of people forget.
12011600	12013680	And make sure you soap all over,
12013680	12016400	even on your booty hole, soap cleans itself
12016400	12018480	due to the nature of it.
12021000	12024320	Not that you're expecting a visitor any time soon, are you?
12024320	12025040	Eh?
12025040	12026360	What?
12026360	12027680	Ehehe.
12027680	12030600	Um, do you get a lot of money if you loot?
12030600	12033200	No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.
12033200	12034800	Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.
12036880	12038800	Oh, oh, oh.
12038800	12039840	No, they're fighting.
12039840	12041840	Stop fighting before I even get there.
12041840	12043480	My goodness.
12043480	12044240	Stop it!
12044240	12045280	Stop it!
12046280	12047520	I'm coming to hell.
12047520	12048360	Give me a second.
12048360	12049600	Let me cook.
12049600	12052840	Oh my god, I've just invited even more guards to come over.
12052840	12053960	Oh, please don't.
12053960	12056520	I don't know how damaged it is.
12056520	12059000	Please don't do a cutscene.
12059000	12063800	There's too many enemies around right now for this.
12063800	12066360	Oh, oops.
12066360	12068520	I am actually going to pick up these bodies
12068520	12069920	and put them in the hay bale.
12069920	12071920	Because if you put five in a hay bale,
12071920	12074000	you do a cortisol challenge.
12074000	12075120	I'm just going to do this now.
12075120	12076480	So I'm not going to talk to them.
12076480	12078680	I'm literally going to save his life and then just be like,
12078680	12080520	excuse me, I'm just trying to hide the evidence of what
12080520	12081840	we've just committed together.
12088840	12090800	Mother Mary.
12090800	12092920	No, not the sword, the body.
12092920	12094840	No, the body.
12094840	12096520	Thank you.
12096520	12097760	No requiesce de parte.
12101560	12103880	And one more body should do it.
12103880	12107000	No, not the weapon, the body.
12107000	12109000	Taking up the trench.
12109000	12112000	Taking up the trench.
12112000	12114240	OK, there we go.
12114240	12115400	You know what always bothered me?
12115400	12117000	When you kill some evil bloke and then
12117000	12121720	Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe, he has.
12121720	12122960	Whoa, what was that?
12122960	12124960	Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?
12124960	12126240	Can you help me?
12126240	12127440	I would gladly fight for it.
12127440	12129160	The camera is so good in this game.
12129160	12132680	Like it's so busy.
12132680	12137320	Do you guys remember the asset repeating?
12137320	12141240	I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated right
12141240	12143080	in this next quest.
12143080	12147720	So remember how he was holding his arm and he was injured?
12147720	12149320	Well, guess what?
12149320	12153680	This is where they reuse the asset on this little crying kid.
12153680	12156360	Don't worry, there's not a random kid crying in your headset.
12156360	12159240	It's part of the game.
12159240	12164400	This is a shrunken down version of that guy that got injured.
12164400	12166880	Not at this stage, but it's the same cause and all that.
12166880	12169760	And when he walks away, you can see it.
12169760	12172560	OK, so stare at him.
12172560	12174640	We know you use reused assets.
12174640	12175560	You be soft.
12175560	12176040	We know.
12180880	12183560	Sleepless.
12183560	12187480	You are scary, but you look very brave.
12188480	12190800	Can you bring my mama back?
12190800	12192240	Right, now watch him walk away.
12195560	12197640	You think you can distract me, video game?
12197640	12201040	I'm on to your secrets.
12201040	12202920	You might as well have me on the dev team.
12202920	12204960	Look at this walk.
12204960	12206200	He's injured.
12206200	12208000	I can see it.
12208000	12209560	You can't hide that from me.
12209560	12211520	I've played this game far too many times.
12211520	12215880	That is the injured thief asset reused.
12215880	12219560	You can't get away from me.
12219560	12222160	Honestly, I wonder if there is behind the scenes development
12222160	12223800	of Brotherhood, because I actually
12223800	12225200	haven't consumed any of that.
12225200	12230320	And if there is, I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.
12230320	12233600	Among other things, after looking at Marshmallow.
12236600	12239960	OK, we do have two assassin signals, which is really good.
12239960	12243840	But I should probably send the recruits away just to get
12243840	12244840	stronger.
12244880	12247200	But not right now, because we're in the middle of a secret.
12247200	12249600	I'm just going to start upgrading stuff as I find them.
12253760	12255640	Injured thief number 312.
12260640	12261920	OK, camera angle, please.
12261920	12264080	Ow, I just bumped into those guards.
12264080	12266400	They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that.
12266400	12267760	But I guess not.
12267760	12270640	Right, we have two assassin signals, which is good.
12270640	12272400	Actually, I'm going to send them a fight
12272400	12278840	to get some experience, because I need to get them strong.
12278840	12282040	So we're just going to watch them do their thing.
12282040	12286320	Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.
12286320	12289640	Yep, take your time.
12289640	12292640	They get XP every time you call them into a battle or send them
12292640	12293320	on missions.
12293320	12294840	It's not a problem.
12294840	12296600	There we go, and the respawn.
12296600	12297960	It's all good.
12297960	12301000	We will keep another signal to do this mission, though,
12301000	12304440	because to get 100%, you have to send your signal
12304440	12305280	to kill the person.
12305280	12306920	Again, another multiplayer character,
12306920	12308760	which is why they're so designed.
12308760	12313600	Out my way, you moth head.
12313600	12314920	I can't really remember.
12314920	12318840	He looks behind you on the bridge a lot.
12318840	12320280	And I like to write on corners.
12320280	12321360	It's quite funny, actually.
12325320	12327120	You don't ever use the recruits.
12327120	12327760	Are you joking?
12327760	12329480	That's the best part about this game.
12329480	12331680	If you suck at video gaming, you can literally just
12331680	12335200	call in the recruits to do everything for you.
12335200	12338920	He should start running in a second.
12338920	12340920	No, around the corner, he runs, because we're
12340920	12341880	to go over there.
12348120	12351080	He's like, yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge
12351080	12353800	that looks threatening to me whatsoever.
12353800	12357760	Me just standing, not even hiding in the crowd or anything,
12357760	12359880	and stops.
12359880	12361440	Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.
12361440	12363000	That's the biggest thing about tailing.
12363000	12365000	If that NPC bumps them, they can turn around
12365000	12366080	and look you right in the eyes.
12366080	12369800	And you're like, oops, you're not really supposed to do that.
12369800	12371920	He literally has a knife out.
12371920	12374680	And we're going to, I think he looks back here.
12374680	12377640	And then, yeah, I remembered.
12377640	12378680	He looks back here.
12378680	12380920	And then he looks back after he does a sprint
12380920	12382920	on top of the stairs.
12382920	12383920	You're getting all the strats.
12383920	12385840	So he doesn't look back anymore unless he gets
12385840	12388720	bumped, which he shouldn't.
12388720	12389640	No, he didn't.
12389640	12390040	He didn't.
12390040	12393000	That's good.
12393000	12395720	And then he's about to break out in a sprint.
12395720	12398320	Hey, that's right.
12398320	12400360	And then you follow him.
12400360	12402620	And then the game wants you to say,
12402620	12407360	ooh, I don't think he should have turned around at that point.
12407360	12408400	No, he shouldn't have.
12408400	12409640	I don't know why he did.
12409640	12412160	He's not coded to turn around at that section.
12412160	12416040	He's coded to turn around at the top of these stairs
12416040	12419880	unless the sequence broke.
12419880	12421640	OK, the sequence broke because he's
12421640	12423520	supposed to do it at the top of those stairs.
12423520	12424200	My goodness.
12424200	12427360	I thought we were about to desync there.
12427360	12428640	Not a game.
12428640	12429640	Not a game.
12429640	12431200	You gave me a heart attack.
12431200	12435280	We must ensure the kidnappings continue.
12435280	12438360	No, there will be no kidnapping.
12438360	12440840	He, he, he.
12440840	12444240	Requies, got the badge.
12444240	12447800	Requies, got the badge.
12447800	12449720	And look at his hook arm.
12449720	12451440	Yawing, using that for a design.
12455440	12457240	I've got two sets of recruits.
12457240	12460640	Can they hurt these guys without dying?
12460640	12465080	I want them to get XP for fighting.
12465080	12466680	Can they do it without Persian?
12466680	12467720	I think they can.
12467720	12469600	But no one leveled up.
12469640	12471680	Not one person leveled up doing that.
12471680	12473040	Nah, you're done.
12473040	12473680	You're naughty.
12473680	12474840	Users supposed to level up.
12478200	12479400	Did I get into the multiplayer?
12479400	12482920	No, I didn't actually.
12482920	12484120	I can't quite remember.
12484120	12485880	I think it was like you hid among the, oh, someone
12485880	12486640	did level up.
12486640	12489400	We'll give her a weapon.
12489400	12491240	Look, we've got so many assassins.
12491240	12495320	I'm going to send them on missions.
12495320	12498360	Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.
12498360	12500600	It's just I've done it so many times.
12500600	12503160	You need to look for difficulty level one missions
12503160	12504520	and then send the recruit on it.
12504520	12506480	And it will automatically make them level two
12506480	12512720	so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.
12512720	12515520	The pigeon's eyes.
12515520	12520480	They're a bit, look, the game's from 2010.
12520480	12523720	OK, it's an older game.
12523720	12524960	I'm not going to steal a horse.
12524960	12526040	That's not nice.
12526080	12528320	Committing Grand Horse, uh-oh.
12528320	12530160	But we'll do this.
12530160	12531000	Have you played Unity?
12531000	12531800	I haven't.
12531800	12535320	I played Assassin's Creed, Ezio's storyline.
12535320	12536640	And then I played three.
12536640	12539120	And I didn't really enjoy it so much.
12539120	12544040	And then I played Black Flag.
12544040	12549560	But I suck at it because they changed the controls.
12549560	12551120	And I'm absolutely awful at it.
12551120	12552960	And I've never actually successfully completed it.
12552960	12555920	I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.
12555960	12558880	I think I'm going to go on to the Tiberina Island.
12562480	12563640	I'll just use that bridge there.
12563640	12564320	That looks right.
12567240	12568000	You enjoyed your night?
12568000	12569600	I know Odyssey came out.
12569600	12570600	I never played that.
12570600	12573160	The newer Assassin's Creed, I'm absolutely not familiar with.
12573160	12574560	At all, I do apologize.
12574560	12577000	I mean, maybe we can play it for the first time together.
12580280	12583440	I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.
12583440	12585160	I know there's that Japanese.
12585160	12586680	Where the heck am I trying to go?
12586680	12589000	Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.
12589000	12590720	Talking and playing at the same time.
12590720	12592720	I'm sorry.
12592720	12595120	Guess who we're about to meet?
12595120	12596000	Are you ready?
12598880	12601880	Ezio.
12601880	12603360	Who are we about to meet?
12604360	12605360	Ezio.
12605360	12606360	Come here.
12612360	12613360	Ta-da!
12613360	12614360	Ezio.
12614360	12615360	Leonardo.
12615360	12617360	Leonardo da Vinci himself.
12617360	12618360	Ta-da!
12618360	12620360	It is good to see you, friend.
12620360	12621360	Come here.
12621360	12622360	Pat, pat, pat, pat.
12622360	12624360	Hello, Leonardo.
12624360	12625360	Long time no see, buddy.
12625360	12627360	The Gorge have commandeered my services.
12627360	12629360	Actually, they would have killed me,
12629360	12631360	had I refused.
12631360	12633360	So remember when Cesare said
12633360	12635360	the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?
12635360	12638360	It was crafted by Leonardo.
12638360	12640360	Because he's my friend.
12640360	12643360	Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.
12643360	12645360	You're also...
12648360	12651360	He wanted to chop that thing off.
12651360	12654360	I don't think any of the modern Aces...
12654360	12656360	They don't have charm.
12656360	12657360	Yeah.
12657360	12659360	That apple.
12659360	12661360	Um...
12664360	12665360	Don't say that.
12665360	12667360	What's 100% thing for the tank mission?
12667360	12669360	You're making me scared now.
12670360	12673360	What's 100% thing for the tank mission?
12674360	12676360	Is it hard?
12676360	12679360	I thought this game was pretty gamer-friendly.
12683360	12684360	You're making me...
12684360	12686360	I'm starting to break out in a sweat.
12686360	12688360	We ain't even played the tank mission yet.
12689360	12691360	Stop!
12691360	12693360	Is it bad?
12693360	12695360	360 hours for this stream?
12700360	12701360	I'm sweating.
12701360	12703360	Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.
12705360	12708360	Did you know Leonardo would eventually like Twilly?
12708360	12710360	That's a true fact.
12711360	12714360	You're getting educated with me.
12715360	12716360	The tank mission?
12716360	12718360	Oh, you're making me nervous.
12720360	12722360	I'm getting scared.
12724360	12728360	Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?
12730360	12731360	I like to get the thing.
12731360	12733360	Okay, we have a long double blade.
12733360	12735360	We can now do double assassinations, which is one of...
12735360	12739360	That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.
12739360	12741360	I already know what I'm doing.
12741360	12743360	Fart and Donovan?
12744360	12746360	We're just unlocking new weaponry.
12746360	12749360	The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove, which is fantastic,
12749360	12755360	to make jump-climbing much easier.
12758360	12760360	I can't remember the tank mission.
12760360	12762360	I'm getting fucking nervous.
12762360	12765360	I'm making me scared for when we do it.
12765360	12767360	I was going to leave the missions all to the end,
12767360	12768360	so we're doing story mode,
12768360	12771360	and then all the side quests, stuff tomorrow, and then 100% sync.
12774360	12776360	Right, I don't know where we're heading next.
12776360	12777360	Oh, okay.
12777360	12779360	800 meters!
12779360	12780360	That's so far away.
12780360	12782360	I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.
12786360	12790360	We can take an aqueduct to...
12790360	12792360	Where the heck are the aqueducts?
12792360	12793360	Okay, behind me.
12793360	12796360	We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,
12796360	12799360	and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.
12804360	12807360	I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.
12807360	12810360	It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.
12810360	12811360	I'm getting nervous.
12811360	12812360	I'm getting shaking.
12812360	12814360	Okay, I'm getting a bit funny.
12816360	12817360	Where am I trying to?
12817360	12818360	I'm trying to teleport.
12818360	12820360	Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,
12821360	12825360	and then I need to go to the mercenaries
12825360	12828360	on the map, and then we're going to do
12828360	12832360	the first of the Leonardo missions.
12832360	12833360	Where the heck...
12833360	12834360	Oh, there.
12834360	12836360	I'm literally right here.
12836360	12837360	Here, right here.
12840360	12842360	Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...
12842360	12844360	First Leonardo mission.
12844360	12846360	I will do the others at the end,
12846360	12848360	because I think it takes far too long to do them,
12848360	12851360	in my humble opinion, although I can't remember them.
12851360	12856360	The layer of Romulus are pretty good for climbing,
12856360	12859360	for those interested in clan.
12859360	12860360	Where's my horse?
12860360	12861360	I have summoned my horse.
12861360	12862360	Come here.
12862360	12864360	You're teasing me.
12864360	12866360	Okay, right.
12866360	12869360	We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.
12869360	12873360	We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.
12873360	12878360	You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.
12878360	12879360	Act 7.
12880360	12882360	So we might hit a boundary wall.
12882360	12884360	I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.
12884360	12887360	There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,
12887360	12890360	but I think I've done it right.
12890360	12892360	Yes, the boundary wall right there.
12892360	12896360	So we are doing it right in quotation marks.
12896360	12898360	Is it up or down?
12898360	12901360	Why are you sitting on the horse like that?
12901360	12903360	Explain yourself.
12907360	12908360	Okay, we did it.
12908360	12909360	We did it.
12909360	12910360	We're here.
12910360	12912360	I think we just have a really basic mercenary hire,
12912360	12915360	and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,
12915360	12918360	which I hate because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,
12918360	12921360	which makes it so much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt.
12921360	12922360	But it's fine.
12922360	12926360	Right, the mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.
12926360	12927360	Three, two, one.
12927360	12929360	Hey, that's right.
12929360	12931360	Come with me.
12931360	12932360	Come with me.
12932360	12934360	You're going to beat these people up for me.
12934360	12937360	Thank you.
12937360	12939360	And you just tell them to fight like that.
12939360	12941360	And that's how you utilize the mercenary recruit.
12941360	12943360	Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.
12943360	12947360	I have a rogue eyelash again.
12947360	12950360	Okay, and then basically you just do all the work.
12950360	12952360	I can call my assassins and...
12952360	12954360	You know what? I'll do it for the XP.
12954360	12957360	Oh, I just unlocked an assassin.
12957360	12958360	I'll take it.
12958360	12960360	No, I can't do that.
12960360	12962360	Uh...
12962360	12965360	Oh, okay, done.
12965360	12968360	Yippee!
12968360	12973360	Okay, we now are going on a mission in a different location.
12973360	12975360	Map Retrieve from the Overseer.
12975360	12980360	I cannot read that fast, but thank you, Game, for having faith in me that I can read that fast.
12980360	12984360	But the truth of the matter is, I can't.
12984360	12985360	Don't do that.
12985360	12987360	Don't let that happen again.
12987360	12989360	Have a little drink of water again.
12989360	12991360	My voice is dying.
12991360	12993360	I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is,
12993360	12997360	or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.
12997360	12999360	All right.
12999360	13002360	I'll get with the machine gun.
13002360	13006360	So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.
13006360	13008360	I have never done that before.
13008360	13011360	I always kill people.
13011360	13013360	And it's like really...
13013360	13016360	It's so much easier if you have the crossbow ball,
13016360	13018360	because, like...
13018360	13024360	For goodness sake, it...
13024360	13028360	Because the crossbow ball doesn't give your location away,
13028360	13032360	but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.
13032360	13034360	I'm actually not wanting to move yet.
13034360	13037360	That's why, because they turn around.
13037360	13041360	I'm gonna yank him.
13041360	13044360	I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy,
13044360	13048360	if I'm being honest.
13048360	13054360	Maybe don't have to, question mark.
13054360	13057360	There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't need.
13057360	13058360	Oh, he's coming!
13058360	13059360	Are you joking me?
13059360	13061360	I've just missed him.
13061360	13062360	Just missed him.
13062360	13070360	We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.
13070360	13073360	There's two bullets.
13073360	13079360	Whenever there's a pigeon light, that means you can do a leap of faith.
13079360	13081360	Your enthusiasm, the game's cute.
13081360	13085360	It's just such a good game.
13085360	13087360	So, as long as he doesn't turn around.
13087360	13090360	If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.
13090360	13093360	So don't run when you do these kind of things.
13093360	13095360	Or else the guards just...
13095360	13098360	The AIs basically gonna be like, I have found you.
13098360	13100360	And then you're like, please don't do that.
13100360	13102360	I would like to be uncaught,
13102360	13105360	because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.
13105360	13107360	Right, so...
13107360	13109360	What is he running for?
13109360	13113360	Okay, this is a bit of an issue.
13113360	13116360	There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,
13116360	13117360	and that one up there.
13117360	13119360	I need to shoot both of them, basically.
13119360	13121360	But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.
13121360	13123360	Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?
13123360	13125360	For real!
13125360	13127360	But they can't see me from this distance.
13127360	13129360	I'm potent, but I'm not that potent.
13129360	13131360	Right, so we can do that, at least.
13131360	13133360	And then...
13133360	13134360	Maybe...
13134360	13136360	Wait, there's a guy there.
13136360	13138360	Oh, I don't like that.
13146360	13147360	Sorry.
13147360	13149360	This part, you can fuck up so easily.
13149360	13151360	Okay.
13151360	13153360	Okay, we didn't fuck it up.
13153360	13155360	Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.
13155360	13157360	Okay.
13157360	13158360	Ta-da!
13158360	13160360	We have achieved the checkpoint.
13160360	13162360	We no longer have to sneak around.
13162360	13164360	We can just do our thing.
13164360	13165360	Phew!
13165360	13167360	I don't ever want to do that again.
13167360	13170360	She says as she has to do it again.
13170360	13172360	You can just drop down.
13172360	13174360	It doesn't cause any damage to you.
13174360	13179360	But the music creators for the speed-up song,
13179360	13183360	like, that is so terrifying.
13183360	13185360	It strikes blood into the hearts.
13185360	13188360	It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.
13188360	13190360	I mean, that's what hearts do.
13190360	13193360	They pump blood around and stuff.
13193360	13196360	Get all oxygenated again.
13196360	13199360	Okay, this is the part I freaking hate,
13199360	13202360	because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.
13202360	13205360	You can literally go side-to-side and evade,
13205360	13206360	and you will still get...
13206360	13208360	Why are there people there?
13208360	13212360	Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably gonna get hit on, like...
13212360	13215360	I don't know how to not get hit.
13215360	13219360	I've played this so many times.
13219360	13221360	Although I did evade all of those,
13221360	13225360	so maybe my swirling is doing much better.
13225360	13227360	Evasive maneuvers!
13227360	13229360	Evasive maneuvers!
13229360	13231360	Ah! See? I don't get it.
13231360	13232360	I'm literally going side-to-side.
13232360	13235360	I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.
13235360	13237360	Like, if I get too close, the game's like,
13237360	13239360	you're not allowed to get that close,
13239360	13242360	and, well, sorry, you didn't really explain.
13242360	13245360	Like, pardon my French,
13245360	13250360	but je ne sais quoi, on what's going on, mate.
13250360	13253360	Okay, there we go. Next sequence.
13253360	13256360	This is actually pretty badass.
13256360	13260360	I can't seem to have to admit.
13260360	13262360	Blech!
13265360	13268360	Stabbed and throw SFX. Blech!
13270360	13272360	We will use the tactical camera,
13272360	13275360	because it's literally, like, if you're down in here,
13275360	13277360	it's, like, so close.
13277360	13280360	And you can use the map to see who's coming up,
13280360	13282360	so I can see there's one on the right,
13282360	13284360	and then we're gonna swing back left,
13284360	13286360	and then we're gonna swing back right.
13286360	13289360	You don't need to worry about the archers at all
13289360	13292360	in this part of the mission.
13292360	13295360	They don't hurt you. I've never been hurt in...
13295360	13298360	But you can see left side again on the red dot map,
13298360	13300360	which I'm covering up! Lovely!
13300360	13304360	I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,
13304360	13308360	so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.
13308360	13310360	I do apologise.
13312360	13314360	Again, the horses always get up.
13314360	13317360	Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.
13317360	13321360	You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.
13321360	13323360	You can get to it.
13323360	13326360	And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up.
13326360	13328360	God, that's really loud.
13328360	13331360	Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.
13331360	13334360	Um, yeah.
13334360	13336360	The horses are fine. Please don't worry.
13336360	13339360	All horses get back up in the game.
13342360	13345360	Ooh, if they aim a bit too close, they're gonna get me.
13348360	13351360	Ooh, am I gonna get away with that?
13351360	13354360	Shoot them down!
13355360	13356360	That wasn't bad either.
13356360	13359360	Wait, he got back up on the horse.
13359360	13361360	You better stop!
13361360	13363360	Stop!
13363360	13366360	Boom, boom, boom!
13366360	13369360	This is, like, sniper-similar, honestly.
13369360	13370360	Oops!
13370360	13373360	Oh, no, I'm gonna get shot. I messed up.
13373360	13375360	Ah, wait!
13375360	13377360	Hello? Rote? Esio?
13381360	13383360	Ugh.
13385360	13387360	Esio actually wanted to perish there.
13387360	13389360	He said, I like feeling pain.
13391360	13393360	Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.
13393360	13395360	I don't have the best aim on analogue.
13395360	13398360	So, I'll try it.
13398360	13401360	But, yeah, this is the first mission.
13401360	13403360	It's the easiest out of them all.
13403360	13405360	This is still tutorial section stuff,
13405360	13408360	because the Leonardo missions are main game.
13408360	13411360	So, this is technical tutorial.
13411360	13414360	We still go in there.
13417360	13419360	I'm trying to remember the axe.
13419360	13420360	Maybe axe.
13420360	13423360	This is the order.
13428360	13429360	Oh, can I hit the barrel?
13429360	13432360	Yeah, I can hit the barrel.
13432360	13434360	How many are there?
13434360	13436360	Okay, we've almost done the sequence,
13436360	13439360	and then we're back into the main game.
13440360	13443360	I might get another cola, actually.
13446360	13448360	My voice is feeling it.
13450360	13455360	I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.
13455360	13457360	I'm not really sure.
13457360	13459360	Other than, like, be quiet five heads,
13459360	13462360	but, like, I want to stream.
13462360	13464360	I want to have a good time.
13464360	13466360	I have so much lost time to make up for it.
13466360	13468360	Like, you have no idea.
13468360	13470360	I saw you spawning.
13470360	13472360	I saw that.
13473360	13475360	I saw you spawning.
13477360	13479360	Hydration and practice.
13479360	13482360	I've been using my voice for years now.
13483360	13485360	Just speak smaller words.
13485360	13487360	Okay.
13487360	13489360	I work as a co-center agent.
13489360	13491360	Water helps.
13492360	13494360	Bang.
13495360	13497360	Oh, actually.
13497360	13499360	Hopefully none of the girls are in here.
13499360	13501360	I want to do a short with them,
13501360	13505360	so apparently girls can't make, like, good weapon sounds.
13505360	13507360	Like, I'll make the sound of a gun,
13507360	13509360	so I'm going to ask all the girls to record
13509360	13511360	an audio of them making the sound of a gun,
13511360	13513360	and then we're going to put it in a short.
13513360	13515360	It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.
13515360	13517360	It's nothing serious.
13517360	13520360	800 yards from the location
13520360	13522360	of where I'm supposed to go, are you kidding me?
13524360	13526360	So I was going to do a shotgun
13526360	13528360	and see if they come up with, like, pistols,
13528360	13530360	or maybe an AK.
13530360	13532360	Right, we've got quite a few levels up.
13532360	13534360	We've got a level three, which is fantastic.
13534360	13537360	We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.
13537360	13540360	They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.
13540360	13544360	I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.
13546360	13549360	I'm going to take the level three to go level up
13550360	13552360	Can I send them on level twos?
13555360	13557360	But the level two missions are quite long.
13561360	13563360	Wonder who's going to be the best?
13563360	13570360	I'm going with the classic shotgun, like the
13570360	13585240	this time over. Wow. Okay. I guess I will go back to the the mercenaries to use the aqueduct
13585240	13592440	there other than aqueduct there as well. Is that closer? I think so. You can rule your

14298480	14300480	Like with the letters and stuff.
14303480	14306480	The French aren't real, it's a line made up by the English.

14326480	14328480	No, double assassinate.
14328480	14330480	Oh, don't be detected.
14330480	14332480	Don't be detected with the mission.
14332480	14336480	And the first thing I do is go up and kill some guys.
14336480	14338480	I'm not very smart, am I?
14338480	14340480	Oh well.
14340480	14342480	Eep.
14342480	14345480	A little over say, but hey.
14345480	14347480	It's fine.
14347480	14349480	Morning.
14350480	14353480	Good morning.
14353480	14356480	Good evening.
14356480	14361480	I really don't want to send my assassins on, like, the Lancers,
14361480	14365480	but as long as they kill the right guy first, this should be fine.
14367480	14371480	Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining about his money issues
14371480	14373480	and how he hates the Borgia.
14373480	14375480	I'm talking right over at him.
14376480	14378480	Oops.
14378480	14382480	Well, thank goodness they came in then.
14389480	14391480	Uh, hello.
14391480	14392480	Whoa.
14392480	14395480	Yeah, see this, the citizens become assassins.
14395480	14396480	They get scared.
14396480	14398480	Why do you not do double blade?
14398480	14399480	I have a double blade.
14399480	14403480	I'm pretty sure there's, like, busted to double blade stuff as well.
14403480	14405480	I really appreciate it.
14405480	14409480	A few different skills to do.
14409480	14413480	We should probably get rid of some of our noray.
14413480	14415480	This is where we start now.
14415480	14416480	We're doing 100% tomorrow.
14416480	14420480	We're just doing campaign mode right now.
14420480	14423480	Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.
14423480	14427480	Good time zone, everyone.
14427480	14429480	That's awful.
14434480	14438480	Uh, we may be able to get ignored.
14438480	14439480	Yes.
14439480	14441480	No.
14441480	14444480	I was gonna sneak by them.
14444480	14448480	I like how he's continuing to talk whilst being beaten up by a sword.
14450480	14453480	Are they not attacking him?
14453480	14457480	Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?
14457480	14458480	Can you attack him?
14458480	14459480	What's going on?
14459480	14460480	Oh my god.
14460480	14463480	Oh, they've attracted more guards.
14466480	14467480	What?
14467480	14469480	And now someone's grabbing the guard?
14469480	14470480	Hello?
14470480	14471480	Right, no.
14471480	14472480	This isn't my problem.
14472480	14473480	Sorry.
14475480	14478480	I don't know what is going on over there, but...
14480480	14483480	I don't think they will attack us.
14483480	14485480	They're so far away.
14485480	14488480	Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.
14488480	14492480	I think the AI was like, no idea who to target first,
14492480	14494480	so it was just going for like everyone.
14497480	14500480	As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.
14500480	14502480	I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.
14508480	14510480	That's the best I got for Spanish.
14510480	14512480	Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.
14513480	14514480	Hmm...
14515480	14517480	I'm trying to think of a better name.
14519480	14520480	Puta Matvee!
14520480	14521480	Oh wait, no, I did it wrong.
14521480	14523480	Puta Matvee!
14525480	14527480	That's my Espanol.
14529480	14530480	We're going...
14531480	14533480	Guards, guards, guards.
14537480	14538480	No, a horse.
14538480	14539480	Anything but a horse.
14540480	14542480	I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.
14542480	14544480	I don't want any horse problems.
14546480	14547480	Oh, the senator's under attack?
14547480	14549480	No, they should be attacking me.
14550480	14551480	How much health has he got?
14551480	14554480	Oh no, he's still like not even lost a square health.
14554480	14556480	Oh no, oh no, oh no.
14556480	14558480	Assassins help now.
14559480	14560480	Okay, we're good.
14560480	14561480	We're good, we're good.
14561480	14562480	And someone got promoted.
14564480	14566480	Smells like promotion, boys.
14567480	14568480	Can I...?
14568480	14570480	I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...
14571480	14573480	We're just gonna go for it, we're just gonna send it.
14574480	14577480	My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...
14578480	14579480	I'm dumb, so...
14584480	14585480	Time to get some sleep.
14585480	14586480	Please rest well.
14587480	14588480	Sleep well.
14588480	14589480	Sweet dreams.
14591480	14592480	Do you know other Italian words?
14593480	14594480	No.
14594480	14597480	Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.
14598480	14600480	Katso, to swear.
14601480	14603480	It's Emmy at piano.
14606480	14608480	Aw, is that me doing piano?
14609480	14611480	She tickling them ivories.
14611480	14613480	Thank goodness I have ivory skin,
14613480	14615480	because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.
14617480	14619480	They're attacking me anyway.
14619480	14621480	Then his friends take me to him.
14622480	14623480	I will bring you all the money you want.
14623480	14624480	I've not played this game.
14624480	14626480	I've played the game in Dutch once.
14627480	14629480	Just so to say, follow me in Dutch.
14629480	14630480	You say, volg me.
14633480	14635480	But yeah, not really.
14635480	14637480	It was just subtitles and stuff.
14639480	14641480	I knew it.
14647480	14648480	Why in Dutch?
14648480	14650480	I wanted to learn Dutch at one point,
14650480	14651480	but I gave up.
14653480	14655480	I only know Scots in English.
14658480	14659480	Family.
14661480	14662480	I will follow you to the banker.
14663480	14665480	Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages
14665480	14667480	to learn if you're English speaking.
14668480	14670480	It only takes apparently 40 hours
14670480	14674480	to get the basics in all that jazz.
14675480	14678480	20 Florence.
14678480	14679480	That was it.
14679480	14680480	In that chest.
14682480	14684480	It is a very goofy language,
14684480	14687480	but it's so easy to speak and learn.
14688480	14690480	If you're ever bored and you're like,
14690480	14691480	I want to do something,
14692480	14693480	just learn some Dutch.
14693480	14694480	Learn the animals.
14694480	14696480	The animals are quite funny,
14696480	14699480	because you can see how literal it is with animals.
14700480	14702480	The title is Shield Poddin,
14702480	14704480	which literally shielded,
14704480	14706480	and then padded.
14706480	14708480	Shield Poddin.
14712480	14715480	Got to learn German since my sister moved there.
14715480	14717480	Hallo, Leute, ha, was, geht?
14717480	14719480	To be good, ja.
14719480	14720480	Is das Gras road?
14720480	14722480	Nein, das Gras is groin.
14723480	14725480	There's some German for you.
14726480	14728480	Right, if we don't touch the floor,
14728480	14729480	we get 100%,
14729480	14731480	but it's a bit finicky, honestly.
14731480	14734480	So it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.
14736480	14738480	Ja, das Gras groin.
14738480	14739480	Ja.
14740480	14742480	Dein en maht ha.
14742480	14745480	Is a lovely lady, ja.
14748480	14750480	Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.
14750480	14752480	I'm not even explaining the game anymore.
14752480	14754480	I'm just having a good time.
14757480	14760480	Most English people have difficulty with the ch.
14760480	14762480	I assume that's what you wanted me to say.
14762480	14766480	Ja, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,
14766480	14768480	you say a loch.
14768480	14769480	Loch.
14769480	14771480	So, kinda, ja.
14771480	14773480	And then we also roll our r's,
14773480	14775480	like it's not girl,
14775480	14776480	it's girl,
14776480	14777480	girl,
14777480	14780480	so Scots kinda naturally have a buff
14780480	14782480	for other languages,
14782480	14784480	which is pretty handy
14784480	14786480	when you're trying to impress someone.
14787480	14792480	I think to say all day every day in...
14794480	14795480	All day, took one Taiwan,
14795480	14797480	all day every day in Vietnamese.
14797480	14799480	Nah, I don't think that's right.
14799480	14800480	Please perish.
14800480	14802480	Give me a clap, Papa.
14802480	14803480	What?
14804480	14806480	I'm gonna like clap them cheese.
14806480	14807480	Sorry.
14810480	14812480	Ja, this is just a classic tailing mission.
14812480	14815480	You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.
14816480	14817480	We are tailing the banker.
14817480	14819480	He currently has our juicy, juicy money,
14819480	14822480	which we do get back at the end of this mission.
14822480	14826480	I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,
14826480	14829480	and I was about to inhale a big inhale.
14831480	14834480	Khef me in clap, Papa.
14834480	14835480	Me spank me daddy.
14835480	14836480	Oh!
14837480	14839480	Khef me in clap, Papa.
14839480	14840480	There you go.
14841480	14844480	To the one Dutch person listening in right now,
14844480	14846480	he's having the time of his life.
14846480	14849480	He is absolutely on it.
14849480	14851480	He's like, I'll see your belief.
14851480	14853480	Oh, no, that's please.
14853480	14854480	How do you say thank you?
14854480	14855480	How do you say thank you?
14855480	14856480	Thank you, Bill.
14856480	14857480	He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.
14857480	14858480	Strawberry.
14858480	14859480	Thank you, Bill.
14859480	14860480	And his reactant.
14862480	14863480	It's me.
14866480	14868480	Like, I know like the other stuff,
14868480	14870480	like Iquil is like I won,
14870480	14871480	like Iquiline.
14874480	14877480	If you are a human, you say Iquiline.
14878480	14882480	If you are ainvral, Iquil...
14885480	14887480	Is he gonna get me in trouble?
14887480	14888480	I don't...
14888480	14892480	I think I can like kill this guy from the box.
14892480	14894480	What's inside the box?
14894480	14895480	Nothing.
14895480	14896480	I'm stuck.
14896480	14897480	Please get out.
14897480	14900480	Okay, that was funny and unique.
14900480	14902480	Please don't do that again.
14902480	14904480	I always forget how to navigate this part.
14906480	14907480	Are you a fish?
14907480	14909480	I'm a cuttlefish.
14909480	14911480	I'm a little piece of paper.
14911480	14913480	Because I do hypnosis.
14914480	14917480	But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.
14917480	14919480	Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out,
14919480	14922480	but like an actual free to view one,
14922480	14923480	like ASMR stuff.
14923480	14925480	Oh, can I need to get on that?
14925480	14927480	We got called again,
14927480	14929480	but it sounds terrible.
14929480	14931480	I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much
14931480	14932480	more stuff I need to edit.
14932480	14936480	And basically I need to wake up
14936480	14938480	and then work before stream,
14938480	14941480	because after stream I can't do anything.
14942480	14943480	I don't want to kill the...
14946480	14948480	Someone's up there.
14953480	14954480	I really don't want to kill
14954480	14956480	because if you put the bodies on the floor,
14956480	14960480	sometimes the bodies desync this...
14961480	14962480	Please stop.
14963480	14965480	Are you kidding me?
14965480	14967480	This thing was don't be detected.
14967480	14968480	I messed that up.
14968480	14969480	My goodness.
14969480	14970480	No, don't fall.
14970480	14971480	Okay, it's fine.
14971480	14972480	The senator's right there.
14972480	14974480	The banker's over there.
14974480	14975480	Well, failed anyway.
14975480	14977480	It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.
14984480	14986480	I know on Twitter on YouTube,
14986480	14988480	but I've got three ASMR videos I need to come out
14988480	14991480	and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.
14991480	14992480	Subscribblers.
14994480	14996480	Yeah, basically,
14996480	14999480	my stats say that I've been subscribed to
14999480	15002480	over 5,000 subscribers.
15002480	15004480	But obviously,
15004480	15006480	because we've been getting called,
15006480	15008480	it keeps going down again.
15008480	15010480	And I was like, oh, okay, I guess.
15010480	15012480	But, oh no, I can't leave.
15012480	15013480	Oh, I don't have to leave.
15013480	15014480	How do I get up here?
15018480	15020480	How do I get up here again?
15023480	15025480	Well, if you're the only streamer on YouTube,
15025480	15026480	it would be Twitch streams.
15028480	15030480	Not really interested in Twitch,
15030480	15032480	because of the arbitrary,
15032480	15034480	like, you're fine,
15034480	15036480	but you're not fine.
15036480	15038480	And, yeah,
15038480	15040480	whereas, like, YouTube, at least,
15040480	15042480	it's kind of like, there's definitely an open status quo
15042480	15044480	with YouTube.
15044480	15046480	And that's much easier to, like,
15047480	15049480	it's, you know,
15049480	15050480	darling,
15050480	15051480	hen,
15051480	15052480	you're stressing me out.
15052480	15053480	Get up.
15053480	15055480	Get it up.
15055480	15056480	Don't be nervous.
15056480	15058480	One in three men, get it up.
15058480	15060480	What do you mean I'm putting more pressure on you
15060480	15062480	to perform?
15062480	15064480	Get it up.
15064480	15066480	Maybe that would be a really funny audio.
15068480	15070480	Like, I'm absolutely desperate,
15070480	15072480	and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.
15072480	15074480	But I'm feeling that would be really unner-
15074480	15076480	Maybe for a meme audio, I can do that.
15076480	15078480	I don't think that would be a really funny audio.
15082480	15084480	I get, like, really aggressive,
15084480	15086480	like, come on!
15088480	15090480	I've never been auto-insub before.
15090480	15092480	A lot of people have been.
15092480	15093480	Yeah.
15093480	15094480	It's okay.
15094480	15096480	The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.
15096480	15098480	So, once I've finished the stream,
15098480	15100480	YouTube is gonna have to admit to itself
15100480	15102480	that I have 8,000-
15102480	15104480	8,000 hours.
15104480	15106480	No, I have 8 hours in Assassin's Creed,
15106480	15108480	and, yeah, people were, like,
15108480	15110480	actually interacting stuff on stream.
15110480	15112480	So, yeah, YouTube.
15112480	15114480	Strongly won.
15114480	15115480	YouTube zero.
15115480	15117480	And the girls have been absolutely fantastic
15117480	15119480	about the culling as well.
15119480	15121480	Like, they have been...
15121480	15123480	I asked them,
15123480	15125480	like, I do not expect the girls
15125480	15127480	to stream every single day.
15127480	15129480	I've told them countless times, the only reason I can do it
15129480	15131480	is because I have rotism, your honor.
15132480	15134480	But I did ask them, like,
15134480	15136480	hey, for the first week,
15136480	15138480	you're most likely gonna have the most views,
15138480	15140480	like, you'll kind of, like,
15140480	15142480	the deba...no, buff from debut.
15145480	15147480	And, like, all of them were like,
15147480	15149480	yeah, I'll give it my all, like,
15149480	15151480	I'll stream as much as I can in the first week,
15151480	15153480	and I'm, like, so freaking thankful and grateful,
15153480	15155480	and, like, I really think it will, like,
15155480	15157480	completely help with the culling
15157480	15159480	and all that jazz.
15159480	15162480	So this mission is bizarre.
15162480	15164480	You basically have to guess
15164480	15166480	the path of where you need to go,
15166480	15168480	and, of course, I haven't unlocked the map,
15168480	15170480	so I've freaking done it wrong already.
15170480	15172480	Is it this way?
15172480	15174480	But you're also timed as well.
15174480	15176480	Um...
15176480	15178480	Aw, and I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.
15178480	15180480	I think I have to go up the stairs.
15183480	15186480	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
15186480	15188480	No, right, I'm going the wrong way.
15189480	15191480	Yeah, so they get, like, suspicious of you
15191480	15193480	if you go the wrong way, and it's, like, um...
15193480	15195480	I'm sorry.
15197480	15199480	Oh, I know, like, the general idea,
15199480	15201480	but I don't know the right way, 100%.
15201480	15205480	I don't even remember going past these portons, honestly.
15207480	15210480	Um, I think we go right of the church.
15212480	15215480	And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.
15215480	15217480	My brain is telling me.
15218480	15220480	Goodness.
15221480	15223480	Yes, and then take a left under here,
15223480	15225480	and then the bridge that's up ahead.
15225480	15227480	Okay, I think we've already nailed it.
15227480	15229480	That is literally how much I've played this game.
15229480	15231480	Um...
15231480	15233480	The noise keeps putting me off,
15233480	15235480	but, like, I know where I'm going, okay?
15235480	15237480	Jeez.
15237480	15239480	Literally, this is the correct way,
15239480	15241480	in the games, like, I was suspicious.
15241480	15243480	No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.
15243480	15245480	I've played it enough to know this is the right way.
15245480	15247480	This is the way.
15247480	15249480	Anyone watch Mandalorian?
15249480	15251480	Grogu's adorable.
15251480	15253480	Grogu. See? There we go.
15253480	15255480	We did it.
15255480	15257480	Uh, yeah.
15257480	15259480	That's all we have to do.
15259480	15261480	And we have completed this section.
15261480	15263480	None...
15263480	15265480	More than an angry squirt.
15265480	15267480	Oh, yeah.
15267480	15269480	PayPal...
15271480	15273480	I don't know what's going on with the PayPal
15273480	15275480	and the business, because we literally submitted...
15275480	15277480	It has been established
15277480	15279480	for months.
15279480	15281480	Like, all the stuff we've established for months.
15281480	15283480	I think, unironically,
15283480	15285480	you guys were supporting, like, AC
15285480	15287480	and me so much
15287480	15289480	that PayPal's like,
15289480	15291480	this is suspicious!
15291480	15293480	And then the PayPal's now blocked.
15293480	15295480	So thank you for all the support you've shown
15295480	15297480	the girls already.
15297480	15299480	You literally got the account
15299480	15301480	suspended.
15301480	15303480	You've literally, like, so much support.
15303480	15305480	You've suspended being
15305480	15307480	able to support the girls' monetary.
15307480	15309480	Like...
15309480	15311480	Which is hilarious if you think about it.
15311480	15313480	Um, okay. We're just
15313480	15315480	tailing the guards.
15315480	15317480	This is the court's on mission I was talking about,
15317480	15319480	which is necessary to have them.
15319480	15321480	Um, if you avoid the guards as much as possible
15321480	15323480	to hold on to the group for as long as possible
15323480	15325480	because you have two sets
15325480	15327480	of girls
15327480	15329480	that will go out to distract guards.
15329480	15331480	But if you get too close to guards
15331480	15333480	and you didn't want to distract,
15333480	15335480	they essentially get wasted.
15335480	15337480	And it's about me
15337480	15339480	literally suffering from success.
15339480	15341480	Um...
15341480	15343480	I think
15343480	15345480	management managed to pay everyone
15345480	15347480	for the watch-alongs
15347480	15349480	in time before that happened.
15349480	15351480	Uh...
15351480	15353480	But I hope so, because there is a lot of money.
15353480	15355480	I think, like, the total for sponsors...
15355480	15357480	No! We lost a group to that.
15357480	15359480	To the hay bale.
15359480	15361480	Um...
15361480	15363480	I think the total of, like,
15363480	15365480	sponsorships was, like...
15365480	15367480	I don't mind talking about this.
15367480	15369480	It was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US
15369480	15371480	dollars mark for everyone, like, compiled.
15371480	15373480	Um...
15373480	15375480	The original budget
15375480	15377480	was, like, 20,000.
15377480	15379480	But hardly anyone
15379480	15381480	was replying
15381480	15383480	to the agency.
15383480	15385480	So shout out to Umi Plus
15385480	15387480	and shout out to
15387480	15389480	VNU agency.
15389480	15391480	Don't be surprised if you see us
15391480	15393480	collaborating with them.
15393480	15395480	They were fantastic
15395480	15397480	and lovely, and actually
15397480	15399480	gave us the time of day.
15399480	15401480	Um...
15401480	15403480	Yeah.
15405480	15407480	So don't be surprised if you see us
15407480	15409480	working with those girls, because their agency
15409480	15411480	was kind enough to give us the time of day.
15411480	15413480	Whereas, pretty much, everyone
15413480	15415480	else ignored us, so...
15415480	15417480	Yeah.
15421480	15423480	Happy it went well, yes.
15423480	15425480	The watch-alongs were a complete success.
15425480	15427480	Special thank you to everyone
15427480	15429480	who did them
15429480	15431480	and all of that jazz.
15431480	15433480	Uh...
15433480	15435480	I'm currently listening to
15435480	15437480	flirting in my ear, because I just heard
15437480	15439480	you say, Priest of Confession
15439480	15441480	or something like that.
15441480	15443480	Oh my god.
15443480	15445480	What happens
15445480	15447480	if we had a nun
15447480	15449480	design, okay?
15449480	15451480	But then, she had
15451480	15453480	a real design under it, but we
15453480	15455480	promote her as a genuine, completely
15455480	15457480	covered up nun.
15457480	15459480	And the promo artwork, her
15459480	15461480	voice lines are super conservative
15461480	15463480	and everything. And then on debut
15463480	15465480	she reveals her real design.
15465480	15467480	That'd be so cool.
15467480	15469480	I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud,
15469480	15471480	but I don't control the design, so
15471480	15473480	I'm allowed to say this stuff.
15473480	15475480	Um...
15475480	15477480	I've got none to do with it.
15477480	15479480	I love having no more responsibilities.
15479480	15481480	There's not going to be a Fond de la Buse
15481480	15483480	because I don't have that responsibility anymore.
15483480	15485480	Yay!
15485480	15487480	But admit it,
15487480	15489480	you love Fond de la Buse.
15489480	15491480	I'm allowed to do it.
15505480	15507480	Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.
15507480	15509480	Did you like seeing the behind the scenes
15509480	15511480	of how we all looked?
15511480	15513480	I am very
15513480	15515480	interested in getting a Celtic design.
15515480	15517480	I'm going to say something
15517480	15519480	controversial, Karen.
15519480	15521480	I actually don't like having
15521480	15523480	booba out on Vichubama Do.
15523480	15525480	And not my thing.
15525480	15527480	And like the cleavage
15527480	15529480	and all that. No, not my thing.
15529480	15531480	No!
15531480	15533480	He got yo-inged by two of the
15533480	15535480	freaking girls. Are you so dumb?
15535480	15537480	Why would you do that?
15537480	15539480	Grrr.
15539480	15541480	Vee sucky,
15541480	15543480	my fave ages.
15543480	15545480	Bruv, it was
15545480	15547480	rough.
15547480	15549480	Development was rough.
15549480	15551480	I'm very happy I never have to develop
15551480	15553480	anything ever again.
15553480	15555480	Like it's completely off-handed.
15555480	15557480	I no longer have to do anything.
15557480	15559480	And it's such a good feeling.
15559480	15561480	Right, we're just going to hire
15561480	15563480	these courtesans to make sure
15563480	15565480	all is good.
15565480	15567480	But I think we're pretty
15567480	15569480	safe.
15569480	15571480	Make yourself flat.
15571480	15573480	Honestly, I might.
15573480	15575480	I might have costume or something.
15575480	15577480	Design.
15577480	15579480	Alternative outfit, that's how you say it.
15579480	15581480	Target is on the move.
15581480	15583480	I repeat.
15583480	15585480	Tango is on the move.
15585480	15587480	Alpha. Bravo. Charlie.
15587480	15589480	Delta. Echo. Foxtrot.
15589480	15591480	Gamma. Indigo.
15591480	15593480	I don't know if that's alphabet.
15593480	15595480	Right, right, right.
15595480	15597480	Girls, girls, put your arm down.
15597480	15599480	Put your arm down.
15599480	15601480	Into the hei bail we go.
15601480	15603480	The hei bail of shame.
15603480	15605480	A big plus for you.
15605480	15607480	Behind the scenes and the info.
15613480	15615480	Yeah, like, I really
15615480	15617480	not really bothered for secrets.
15617480	15619480	It's like, how do you do this?
15619480	15621480	Put a lot of money behind it.
15621480	15623480	Okay, how do you do that?
15623480	15625480	Put a lot of money behind it.
15625480	15627480	If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,
15627480	15629480	I'm going to say this to you.
15629480	15631480	Whatever you think it's going to cost.
15631480	15633480	Double it.
15633480	15635480	I then give it some more.
15635480	15637480	Whatever time you think it's going to take.
15637480	15639480	Double it.
15639480	15641480	And give it some more.
15641480	15643480	I had a lot of
15643480	15645480	issues with
15645480	15647480	like,
15647480	15649480	artists going
15649480	15651480	past deadlines.
15651480	15653480	So everything
15653480	15655480	slid back into me
15655480	15657480	and it was horrific for me.
15657480	15659480	Which is why
15659480	15661480	I don't have a lot of things done.
15661480	15663480	My ASMR audios are recorded,
15663480	15665480	but they aren't edited for you
15665480	15667480	that go on YouTube.
15667480	15669480	And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done.
15669480	15671480	But, you know, things happened and stuff happens.
15671480	15673480	But everything's been fantastic.
15673480	15675480	The reception the girls
15675480	15677480	received, I'm just so glad people are
15677480	15679480	loving on them and just so happy
15679480	15681480	with them.
15681480	15683480	Like,
15683480	15685480	it was not easy
15685480	15687480	because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.
15687480	15689480	It was not easy
15689480	15691480	to
15691480	15693480	assign people
15693480	15695480	a pre-made model.
15695480	15697480	I saw some people ask,
15697480	15699480	why don't they just create the models themselves
15699480	15701480	that they like?
15701480	15703480	I understand that I don't
15703480	15705480	do that. You have no idea
15705480	15707480	how freaking hard it is to coordinate
15707480	15709480	X amount of
15709480	15711480	modelers to come together, to come make a concept,
15711480	15713480	come to this, come to that.
15713480	15715480	I am not doing that approach.
15715480	15717480	Please do not think the viewer is going to end up doing that approach.
15717480	15719480	However, the girls are more than
15719480	15721480	welcome to... Hello? Hello?
15721480	15723480	No, we missed a...
15723480	15725480	We missed the opportunity
15725480	15727480	to assassinate them.
15727480	15729480	Bruh. Come back here right now.
15729480	15731480	My goodness. Come back here.
15731480	15733480	Oh, right. Well, just do it later.
15733480	15735480	Pfft.
15735480	15737480	Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?
15737480	15739480	I think the court is on its path and maybe
15739480	15741480	messed them up. Bruh, get right back here.
15741480	15743480	But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls
15743480	15745480	to tell me what they want for alternative
15745480	15747480	outfits and stuff. That's not a problem
15747480	15749480	at all.
15749480	15751480	But
15751480	15753480	to do a debut
15753480	15755480	that has input from the start
15755480	15757480	that's
15757480	15759480	being signed on in
15759480	15761480	development is like six months
15761480	15763480	in the making. No one wants to be
15763480	15765480	hanging about six months
15765480	15767480	waiting for their new job
15767480	15769480	to start. Yeno?
15769480	15771480	Oh, Mero. Hi, Mero.
15771480	15773480	How are you doing?
15773480	15775480	He has a gun.
15775480	15777480	Emi's gone live.
15777480	15779480	Okay. Emi... Oh!
15779480	15781480	Oops, I wasn't paying attention. Hold on.
15781480	15783480	I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.
15783480	15785480	Oh, no! The hay bale!
15785480	15787480	Oh!
15787480	15789480	My ankles!
15789480	15791480	The hay bale!
15791480	15793480	I missed... Oh, that's more guards!
15793480	15795480	I'm... I'm hiding in the corner.
15795480	15797480	There's so many guards around me.
15797480	15799480	I can carry it!
15803480	15805480	Oh, my God!
15805480	15807480	How did they all follow me here?
15807480	15809480	All right, I'm calling in the assassins.
15809480	15811480	You're stuck.
15811480	15813480	Oh, my God!
15813480	15815480	There is so many!
15819480	15821480	It ripped the ankles.
15821480	15823480	I know.
15824480	15826480	Oh.
15826480	15828480	Funny you come in here, Mero.
15828480	15830480	I was just talking about your agency.
15832480	15834480	I was seeing how Yumi Plus
15834480	15836480	is one of the very few
15836480	15838480	agencies that responded
15838480	15840480	to the watch-along offers
15840480	15842480	that VLR made.
15842480	15845480	Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.
15845480	15848480	We love Yumi Plus out here.
15850480	15852480	They found us in two seconds.
15852480	15854480	I was like pinned against that wall.
15854480	15857480	Like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.
15857480	15859480	Oh, what? Yeah.
15859480	15861480	Hardly.
15861480	15864480	We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.
15864480	15867480	And your agency and VNU
15867480	15869480	were the only two agencies
15869480	15871480	that were kind enough to respond to us.
15871480	15873480	Where are Claudia and Maria?
15873480	15875480	We can talk with the money.
15875480	15877480	They followed us all.
15877480	15879480	Sorry, I was trying to go to Amy's room.
15879480	15881480	I have good news for you.
15881480	15883480	I want you to go to Amy's stream.
15884480	15887480	If any mods, you get one
15887480	15889480	speaking permission.
15889480	15891480	Amy's stream link.
15891480	15893480	That's your only time you're allowed to talk.
15895480	15897480	Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?
15897480	15899480	I don't know, I've seen that before.
15899480	15901480	All those numbers.
15903480	15904480	No more talking mods.
15904480	15905480	Silence!
15905480	15906480	Silence.
15906480	15907480	Thank you.
15907480	15909480	But yes, please enjoy
15909480	15911480	watching Amy Bizzou.
15911480	15913480	I recommend you watch any of my gen mates
15913480	15915480	when they go live because I myself
15915480	15918480	am an endurance streamer.
15918480	15921480	And I will be here for many, many an hour.
15921480	15923480	I will be trying to finish the
15923480	15925480	campaign mode of this game.
15925480	15927480	So please, do not feel any type of way
15927480	15930480	if you go to watch any of my gen mates.
15930480	15932480	I absolutely appreciate it and love it.
15932480	15933480	Please always consider
15933480	15935480	liking and scrub-scribing
15935480	15937480	to their channels.
15937480	15939480	I would love to see them
15939480	15941480	get ahead of me sub-wise
15941480	15943480	because the girls
15943480	15945480	are fantastic and they have
15945480	15947480	so much potential
15947480	15949480	that I see in them
15949480	15951480	and I just want them to...
15951480	15953480	I did not want to take your horse.
15953480	15955480	Please get back on your horse
15955480	15957480	and leave me alone. I apologize.
15959480	15961480	We're still short of the crossbow.
15963480	15965480	Maybe we can make enough money
15965480	15967480	if we send the recruits.
15967480	15969480	We kind of need the crossbow
15969480	15971480	for this mission that's coming up.
15971480	15973480	If you do not have the crossbow,
15973480	15975480	it is a heck on earth.
15975480	15977480	It's not a fun thing.
15977480	15979480	Mercy's laugh is so good.
15979480	15981480	You're running the content. You didn't say content too.
15981480	15983480	Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.
15983480	15985480	Today we do campaign mode
15985480	15987480	and like go back to like 100% stuff.
15987480	15989480	Yes, see look at that money.
15989480	15991480	A thousand florins,
15991480	15993480	thousand, thousand...
15993480	15995480	Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.
15995480	15997480	Sometimes you can drop the T-H
15997480	15999480	and make it an E.
15999480	16001480	So the number 30
16001480	16003480	becomes the number 30.
16003480	16005480	I don't know if you can even hear the difference
16005480	16007480	but yeah, with an F. Very.
16009480	16011480	Whoa, we have 15,000?
16011480	16013480	That's like so much money.
16013480	16015480	I didn't expect that much actually.
16015480	16017480	I'm going to send the assassins
16017480	16019480	on another contract just to get them
16019480	16021480	more XP
16021480	16023480	because obviously the higher
16023480	16025480	they are, the more
16025480	16027480	likely they are
16027480	16029480	not to fall in battle.
16029480	16031480	I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.
16031480	16033480	We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.
16033480	16035480	Right. Someone say gambling time?
16035480	16037480	Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream
16037480	16039480	for you to say gambling time?
16039480	16041480	Is she being a naughty?
16041480	16043480	Oh, there's a thief down there.
16043480	16045480	Oh, I did gamble
16045480	16047480	with all the money. No, we're not gambling
16047480	16049480	with the florins. I need it for
16049480	16051480	crossbow ball.
16051480	16053480	And then we're going to go and travel
16053480	16055480	to the barracks.
16057480	16059480	Come.
16059480	16061480	Crossbow ball.
16061480	16063480	Best in slot
16063480	16065480	which is BIS.
16065480	16067480	Best in slot or biz for short.
16067480	16069480	Any biz.
16071480	16073480	She's doing ASMR.
16075480	16077480	Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking
16077480	16079480	for that. Okay.
16079480	16081480	Yeah, it makes sense now.
16081480	16083480	You may enjoy Amy's ASMR
16083480	16085480	for no
16085480	16087480	particular
16087480	16089480	reason.
16091480	16093480	We gamble.
16093480	16095480	It's supposed to be ASMR.
16095480	16097480	Yeah, I wonder if she
16097480	16099480	did that ASMR.
16099480	16101480	She DM'd me.
16101480	16103480	She's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?
16103480	16105480	I'm like, you know what? Just go for it.
16105480	16107480	I said, I told her, don't breathe
16107480	16109480	while you do the licking.
16113480	16115480	What does she mean by this?
16121480	16123480	Miam, miam, miam. Hydration check.
16127480	16129480	But still no.
16129480	16131480	Gamble to impress
16131480	16133480	or discuss the course.
16135480	16137480	We have them in a retreat.
16137480	16139480	They seem to be getting closer.
16139480	16141480	What does that mean?
16141480	16143480	Ear licking.
16147480	16149480	Yeah.
16149480	16151480	Don't take any down close.
16151480	16153480	Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.
16155480	16157480	This is bizarre.
16157480	16159480	They spawned in so many enemies
16159480	16161480	for this section.
16161480	16163480	I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun
16163480	16165480	but, my goodness.
16165480	16167480	Hold on.
16171480	16173480	You can disengage from fights
16173480	16175480	by just running away and jumping.
16175480	16177480	For some reason, jumping makes the AI
16177480	16179480	cry. The AI will not swing for you
16179480	16181480	if you jump.
16185480	16187480	The other entrance.
16187480	16189480	Wait a minute.
16189480	16191480	That can...
16191480	16193480	It has a double meaning.
16195480	16197480	No, no, refling the other entrance.
16197480	16199480	The other one.
16203480	16205480	Now we destroy all
16205480	16207480	of the baddies.
16211480	16213480	I do love going on a kill street
16213480	16215480	because it's really satisfying
16215480	16217480	that everyone...
16217480	16219480	The baddies are running
16219480	16221480	signals from the field.
16221480	16223480	Oh, bonjour.
16225480	16227480	Come closer and say that.
16227480	16229480	Soon all of
16229480	16231480	Italia will be speaking to you.
16231480	16233480	Valic sensibilities.
16239480	16241480	It's so nice of them to wait
16241480	16243480	one by one to attack you.
16243480	16245480	I know they have such good manners, honestly.
16247480	16249480	Mommy,
16249480	16251480	want to explore that?
16251480	16253480	I read the funniest
16253480	16255480	thing ever
16255480	16257480	and
16257480	16259480	if you know, you know.
16259480	16261480	It was like,
16261480	16263480	what happens if you take my boy cherry
16263480	16275480	and it was like,
16275480	16277480	I'm playing Brotherhood.
16277480	16279480	I'm going to watch the stream later
16279480	16281480	until all of you
16281480	16283480	have fun watching.
16291480	16293480	Look at the speed of this horse.
16293480	16295480	These horses
16295480	16297480	are so much slower.
16297480	16299480	What did you mean by that?
16299480	16301480	Development team of Brotherhood
16301480	16303480	by making the white horse
16303480	16305480	the slowest
16305480	16307480	in the black horse the fastest.
16307480	16309480	What did you mean by that?
16309480	16311480	Do you want to elaborate? No?
16311480	16313480	No, okay.
16313480	16315480	Something rather odd.
16315480	16317480	Rather odd about that.
16317480	16319480	But then again, it could just be coincidence.
16319480	16321480	But then
16321480	16323480	is it coincidence
16323480	16325480	if you go up
16325480	16327480	to like,
16327480	16329480	the tan horse is faster than the brown horse
16329480	16331480	is faster than the black ones the fastest?
16331480	16333480	Hmm.
16333480	16335480	Hmm.
16337480	16339480	Should we be offended
16339480	16341480	by a game that was made 14 years
16341480	16343480	ago?
16353480	16355480	Don't let the game journalists
16355480	16357480	hear we are now.
16357480	16359480	It's candle to be.
16361480	16363480	I
16367480	16369480	I miss when they can gallop.
16369480	16371480	You can still gallop, you have to hold A
16371480	16373480	but the problem with galloping is if there's like
16373480	16375480	people in the way your horse can fall over.
16379480	16381480	Canceled on first game stream.
16381480	16383480	Wait, why would I get cancelled
16383480	16385480	if I point out what the development did?
16385480	16387480	Why am I getting, hold on a minute.
16387480	16389480	No, no, no, you can't cancel me.
16389480	16391480	You just do not reflect to failure agency.
16393480	16395480	I just scream that.
16395480	16397480	Right, this is my only gripe.
16397480	16399480	This is my only gripe
16399480	16401480	with this mission.
16401480	16403480	You get left at the gate here
16403480	16405480	only, I repeat, you get left
16405480	16407480	at the gate here only
16407480	16409480	to have to horsey your way
16409480	16411480	back to the villa when the last
16411480	16413480	mission just got you from
16413480	16415480	the barracks
16415480	16417480	to there.
16417480	16419480	I'm just going back to like what you just did.
16419480	16421480	That's my only gripe.
16421480	16423480	That's right with that.
16423480	16425480	On the end.
16425480	16427480	Oh, I should do ASMR
16427480	16429480	like just me going
16429480	16431480	for like 30 minutes ear to ear.
16431480	16433480	What was that noise?
16433480	16435480	Is that a door?
16435480	16437480	It sounded like, ooh.
16439480	16441480	Once inside, your men can overpower
16441480	16443480	the camp patrols, correct?
16443480	16445480	Yes, but especially if the patrols
16445480	16447480	are taken completely by surprise.
16447480	16449480	Yes.
16449480	16451480	My ankle.
16451480	16453480	I'm sitting on it funny. I can't believe it.
16453480	16455480	That person grunting?
16455480	16457480	Literally, man.
16457480	16459480	Cody, you're truly a man.
16459480	16461480	I'm going to burp. I'm so sorry.
16463480	16465480	Oh, that was a little maybe burp.
16467480	16469480	Should have been a frog feature burp.
16469480	16471480	It would have been very good.
16471480	16473480	Oh, it could have been a hypno frog.
16473480	16475480	Honestly.
16475480	16477480	Do you ever sit normally?
16477480	16479480	No.
16479480	16481480	I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.
16481480	16483480	Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.
16483480	16485480	And it's just me showing you
16485480	16487480	how badly I sit like the entire time.
16487480	16489480	I thought a foot cam stream during a
16489480	16491480	horror game would be funny because you can
16491480	16493480	watch me shake my ankles.
16493480	16495480	And I also have a thing where I
16495480	16497480	press my toes into the ground.
16497480	16499480	Like I literally have like little
16499480	16501480	indents on my toes
16501480	16503480	from where I press them into the ground
16503480	16505480	because of the way my toes like
16505480	16507480	form over on it.
16507480	16509480	I know it's interesting, but
16509480	16511480	you know.
16511480	16513480	Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.
16513480	16515480	And the rotism picks you.
16519480	16521480	We've got three so far.
16523480	16525480	That would actually be funny.
16525480	16527480	Okay, I'm down for it.
16527480	16529480	Okay, my guy's already gone.
16529480	16531480	How about if I send people on you?
16533480	16535480	I don't want to get caught because we can easily
16535480	16537480	100% this.
16537480	16539480	But the assassin recruits take so long.
16539480	16541480	Okay, thankfully they got caught in the
16541480	16543480	whoa.
16543480	16545480	We're getting action shots, like the horse.
16545480	16547480	Okay.
16547480	16549480	They're a new recruit.
16549480	16551480	Let them get up.
16551480	16553480	Is the other assassin going to try and
16553480	16555480	help or?
16555480	16557480	No.
16557480	16559480	Let them get absolutely lanced.
16559480	16561480	Right, I'll help them out.
16561480	16563480	Oh, she's losing health.
16563480	16565480	I don't like that.
16565480	16567480	Right, go kill the other guy now.
16567480	16569480	No, I got these.
16569480	16571480	I got discovered because of that.
16571480	16573480	Okay, whoa, we need to help.
16573480	16575480	We need to help. They're too strong.
16575480	16577480	This guy's too strong.
16577480	16579480	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not the horse.
16579480	16581480	Not the horse. Not the horse.
16581480	16583480	In the boss. In the boss. Get him in the boss.
16583480	16585480	Hit him in the boss. Hit him in the boss.
16585480	16587480	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
16587480	16589480	It's fine. I don't know how to go against the horse.
16589480	16591480	Please leave me alone.
16591480	16593480	I don't know how to deal with horses.
16593480	16595480	Okay, there we go.
16595480	16597480	Okay, we're dealing with the crossbow ball.
16597480	16599480	Jeez.
16599480	16601480	Rank 10 assassins are so good,
16601480	16603480	honestly.
16603480	16605480	We are very slowly
16605480	16607480	leveling them up.
16607480	16609480	I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.
16609480	16611480	Can I pick a fight?
16611480	16613480	Ooh, feather.
16613480	16615480	Look how daintily I jumped over that.
16615480	16617480	That was beautiful.
16617480	16619480	Are you okay?
16619480	16621480	Have you heard about this? Have you heard about this jump?
16621480	16623480	Hey, there we go.
16623480	16625480	We're going to upset these guys.
16625480	16627480	Wait, that's a barrier?
16629480	16631480	That's a barrier.
16631480	16633480	Can you jump over them?
16633480	16635480	I've never seen that before.
16635480	16637480	We're going to upset these guards on purpose.
16637480	16639480	So we can... Ouch!
16639480	16641480	I didn't expect that.
16641480	16643480	Oh, geez!
16643480	16645480	Oh, my goodness.
16645480	16647480	I just got double whammy right off the bat.
16647480	16649480	Oh, my...
16649480	16651480	Okay, I need to take the big guy.
16651480	16653480	Thank you, big guy,
16653480	16655480	for perishing.
16655480	16657480	Can't handle you.
16657480	16659480	Okay, how about that?
16659480	16661480	Yeah, big...
16661480	16663480	Oh, we need one more.
16663480	16665480	Who's going to perish? You are going to perish.
16667480	16669480	See, the horses are getting stuck here.
16671480	16673480	I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.
16675480	16677480	I predict a riot.
16677480	16679480	Ooh, do you not want to go down there?
16679480	16681480	Because it's such a nightmare getting out there.
16681480	16683480	How many steps is that?
16687480	16689480	I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.
16689480	16691480	I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.
16691480	16693480	I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.
16693480	16695480	I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.
16697480	16699480	Oh, I'll most likely do
16699480	16701480	like a full playthrough of Itu's
16701480	16703480	storyline.
16703480	16705480	Where am I going?
16705480	16707480	Have you seen this?
16711480	16713480	Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.
16713480	16715480	Ooh!
16715480	16717480	Right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.
16725480	16727480	That's a lot of guards.
16729480	16731480	Hmm.
16731480	16733480	Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?
16735480	16737480	Wait, we're going to get you.
16741480	16743480	And then we're going to just
16743480	16745480	sneak up here and kill you.
16747480	16749480	Okay, I'll take that.
16749480	16751480	Do you guys need help?
16751480	16753480	I'll give you a second recruitment beam
16755480	16757480	and let you guys fight it out
16757480	16759480	and I'm going to climb up here
16759480	16761480	and do this.
16761480	16763480	Do we skip up here?
16763480	16765480	I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.
16765480	16767480	I absolutely suck at it.
16767480	16769480	I am so sorry.
16769480	16771480	I cannot do it.
16771480	16773480	I've tried Beyond Belief.
16773480	16775480	I ended up watching someone else play it
16775480	16777480	just so I know the storyline.
16777480	16779480	Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.
16783480	16785480	I probably...
16785480	16787480	No, I'm doing variety,
16787480	16789480	but what I'll probably do running up to October 10
16789480	16791480	is
16791480	16793480	I'll play
16793480	16795480	Assassin's Creed 2
16795480	16797480	before it, then October 10
16797480	16799480	play Brotherhood again
16799480	16801480	and then after play Revelations
16801480	16803480	and then we'll get the full Ezio story.
16807480	16809480	Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode
16809480	16811480	and then the enemies get like a free hit on you
16811480	16813480	because there's nothing you can do.
16815480	16817480	I mean, I know why it does it
16817480	16819480	because stuff and things, but...
16823480	16825480	We're level 4,
16825480	16827480	we're kind of getting a little bit decent.
16827480	16829480	It's not the best.
16829480	16831480	We're really not that strong.
16831480	16833480	I'm just plumping it all into armor
16833480	16835480	because I get so nervous for them.
16837480	16839480	I don't want to do a level 4.
16839480	16841480	Maybe a 3?
16841480	16843480	Send 2 on a level 3
16843480	16845480	XP, which is like 100 each.
16845480	16847480	Yeah...
16847480	16849480	Oh, a second one? Okay, we'll do that.
16851480	16853480	That's some old saying to get...
16853480	16855480	Oh, my tummy rumbled.
16855480	16857480	My tummy rumbled.
16857480	16859480	Make me to get some...
16859480	16861480	Oh, my tummy rumbled again.
16861480	16863480	I don't know if that's getting picked up in the make,
16863480	16865480	but I think I'm getting a bit peckish
16865480	16867480	for actual things.
16867480	16869480	You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.
16869480	16871480	Sometimes you need more.
16873480	16875480	But...
16875480	16877480	There's so many jokes I can make,
16877480	16879480	but they're too easy. I'm just going to leave it.
16879480	16881480	Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.
16883480	16885480	It's 9000 Florence!
16885480	16887480	Who has 9000 Florence?
16889480	16891480	Unreal.
16891480	16893480	Unreal Engine.
16893480	16895480	Who has 9000 Florence?
16895480	16897480	Not me.
16897480	16899480	Yeah, to me, say.
16899480	16901480	You know what they say?
16901480	16903480	I'm in the pink.
16903480	16905480	All in the stink.
16907480	16909480	Who has 9000?
16909480	16911480	Okay, we're going to get smoke bomb.
16911480	16913480	Excuse me, excuse me.
16913480	16915480	I want a smoke bomb pouch.
16915480	16917480	Smoke bomb pouch?
16917480	16919480	Smoke bomb pouch, yes.
16919480	16921480	No, not the knife bell.
16921480	16923480	Okay, we have smoke bombs almost.
16923480	16925480	We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.
16925480	16927480	Okay.
16929480	16931480	I can't believe...
16931480	16933480	I actually don't get enough of a cut
16933480	16935480	or a split that I can't even afford to...
16935480	16937480	Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.
16939480	16941480	Yes, I will help you.
16941480	16943480	No, let me help you.
16943480	16945480	Oh, it's a lady. Oh, my lady.
16945480	16947480	We actually need to
16947480	16949480	smoke bomb.
16949480	16951480	Because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.
16951480	16953480	For...
16953480	16955480	Why?
16955480	16957480	What?
16957480	16959480	Why do they just get aggressive on us?
16961480	16963480	Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.
16963480	16965480	Ace Marbuth.
16965480	16967480	Who said that?
16967480	16969480	Who said that?
16969480	16971480	Just put them on a warning.
16971480	16973480	Whoever insinuates that the Ace Marbuth
16973480	16975480	is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.
16975480	16977480	Put them on a warning.
16977480	16979480	Don't.
16979480	16981480	Teasing.
16983480	16985480	I'm teasing.
16985480	16987480	I actually think I might need to get...
16987480	16989480	I like, I never notice that I'm like hungry
16989480	16991480	or NTP and then as soon as I notice it,
16991480	16993480	I'm like, ah!
16993480	16995480	I'm perishing, I'm perishing.
16995480	16997480	Mods.
16997480	16999480	File this man's tax return.
16999480	17001480	Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...
17001480	17003480	I have a funny short coming out about
17003480	17005480	like what you can get taxed back
17005480	17007480	in a beach of our agency.
17007480	17009480	You know my Donut-Thon rewards?
17009480	17011480	One of them is going to be
17011480	17013480	a length chart.
17013480	17015480	I get to submit that
17015480	17017480	for tax back
17017480	17019480	because it's
17019480	17021480	what I needed to do
17021480	17023480	in order to operate.
17023480	17025480	Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.
17025480	17027480	Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get
17027480	17029480	the full price of it back in taxes.
17029480	17031480	No, it just means like...
17031480	17033480	It's like, okay,
17033480	17035480	you can get like two dollars back
17035480	17037480	on your tax return.
17037480	17039480	I appreciate it.
17039480	17041480	But like, yeah, you can get taxed back on models,
17041480	17043480	get taxed back on equipment,
17043480	17045480	get taxed back on internet,
17045480	17047480	get taxed back on...
17047480	17049480	rent as well, I get taxed back on.
17049480	17051480	Paying your tax
17051480	17053480	the stream.
17053480	17055480	Oh, I don't even want to think about
17055480	17057480	taxes, honestly.
17057480	17059480	Although it was pretty...
17059480	17061480	pretty...
17061480	17063480	Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to like
17063480	17065480	get the full thing back.
17065480	17067480	Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax
17067480	17069480	back,
17069480	17071480	it sounds like they mean
17071480	17073480	you get the full thing back, which is not the case at all.
17075480	17077480	Everything is a business, right?
17077480	17079480	If you can justify it
17079480	17081480	100%
17081480	17083480	because I can imagine a vealer
17083480	17085480	got audited and I have to go like,
17085480	17087480	oh yeah, you know this special artwork
17087480	17089480	that was part of the business
17089480	17091480	because we're an entertainment business.
17091480	17093480	It would be hilarious.
17093480	17095480	ASMR girl Iris
17095480	17097480	Agent
17097480	17099480	interrogates you.
17099480	17101480	Wait, what am I doing?
17101480	17103480	Oh, right in the balls.
17103480	17105480	Wait, why did...
17105480	17107480	Oh, did I just
17107480	17109480	freak? Oh my god.
17109480	17111480	I'm sorry, I really just
17111480	17113480	like the last men.
17113480	17115480	Small
17115480	17117480	poles only, please, my goodness.
17117480	17119480	They're so hard to defeat.
17119480	17121480	The company
17121480	17123480	has an account and does everything legally.
17123480	17125480	Okay, dude.
17127480	17129480	Management. Actually, there's an account
17129480	17131480	and that's true.
17133480	17135480	Small poles only, so ogre.
17137480	17139480	Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.
17139480	17141480	That's for our later stream.
17143480	17145480	You tell it in like raw 4k detail
17145480	17147480	about the walkers.
17155480	17157480	Right, what am I supposed to do?
17157480	17159480	Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.
17159480	17161480	Okay, he's about to activate this next
17161480	17163480	thing.
17163480	17165480	I am now to perish the guards
17165480	17167480	of my own deck guild.
17167480	17169480	So this guy
17169480	17171480	can go first
17171480	17173480	and
17173480	17175480	then I can do
17175480	17177480	you.
17177480	17179480	And then, last but not least,
17179480	17181480	I can do you.
17181480	17183480	No.
17183480	17185480	Don't be silly,
17185480	17187480	it's your
17187480	17189480	aim on the guard, my goodness.
17189480	17191480	By the way, this came
17191480	17193480	deaf. What?
17193480	17195480	Hello?
17197480	17199480	Hello?
17199480	17201480	I got desynchronized, but I did
17201480	17203480	what you asked.
17203480	17205480	I did everything right
17205480	17207480	and I still lost.
17207480	17209480	Wait.
17209480	17211480	This isn't the original checkpoint.
17211480	17213480	We still, wait, we hit the checkpoint
17213480	17215480	and it let us go through.
17219480	17221480	Okay, okay, I'll take it.
17225480	17227480	Okay, next
17227480	17229480	guard checkpoint.
17229480	17231480	One to our left.
17231480	17233480	I might go kill him the new.
17233480	17235480	Good day to you.
17235480	17237480	Please stop walking.
17237480	17239480	Thank you.
17239480	17241480	Okay, there's a second guard
17241480	17243480	there.
17243480	17245480	I really want to get
17247480	17249480	I need them to
17249480	17251480	split up.
17251480	17253480	Focus, focus, there's a pizza on your
17253480	17255480	focus.
17255480	17257480	I
17257480	17259480	was too
17259480	17261480	in range. If I can time this right,
17261480	17263480	I'm not going to desync.
17263480	17265480	I did it.
17265480	17267480	Did you see that though? The AI
17267480	17269480	looked at me. Oh my goodness, right?
17269480	17271480	What way are you going Bartolomeo?
17271480	17273480	You're going this way.
17273480	17275480	That was the way.
17279480	17281480	I'm French.
17281480	17283480	I'm French.
17283480	17285480	I'm French.
17285480	17287480	I'm French.
17287480	17289480	I'm French.
17289480	17291480	I'm French.
17291480	17293480	I'm not Italian or an assassin.
17297480	17299480	I don't know how.
17299480	17301480	We didn't get desync to do in that
17301480	17303480	but we made it.
17303480	17305480	Right, we've got a guard on the
17305480	17307480	outside here.
17307480	17309480	I actually don't remember this part a lot.
17309480	17311480	You,
17311480	17313480	I've got two guards next to each other.
17313480	17315480	I don't like
17315480	17317480	Oh, he's coming this way.
17317480	17319480	Oh, there's a dead body.
17323480	17325480	It's fine.
17325480	17327480	Oh no, he's gone for the dead body.
17327480	17329480	I didn't think that through.
17329480	17331480	That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.
17331480	17333480	Phew, we did it.
17333480	17335480	The hard part is over.
17335480	17337480	Now it's for the easy part.
17337480	17339480	So we just walk up to this gate
17339480	17341480	and then we get to learn how French
17341480	17343480	people say Italian dog
17343480	17345480	which is
17345480	17347480	Italian.
17347480	17349480	Are you going to have any European
17349480	17351480	friendly streams?
17353480	17355480	Like, you mean
17355480	17357480	starting earlier than the time I stream
17357480	17359480	right now?
17361480	17363480	This is probably going to be
17363480	17365480	my stream start time until
17365480	17367480	Daylight savings
17367480	17369480	kicks in for some places.
17371480	17373480	Which part of France
17373480	17375480	are you from?
17391480	17393480	It's EU friendly.
17393480	17395480	It's 8pm.
17395480	17397480	It's a bit late if you're like
17397480	17399480	German ahead one.
17403480	17405480	Is this a European friendly stream?
17405480	17407480	Do we not like them?
17407480	17409480	No, we do. It's just time zones.
17409480	17411480	It's 4am when I start streaming.
17411480	17413480	So,
17413480	17415480	I'm trying my best.
17415480	17417480	But I'm an endurance streamer so
17417480	17419480	I do hit a lot of time zones.
17419480	17421480	And it's unlikely
17421480	17423480	that reeflings have
17423480	17425480	8 hours to set through
17425480	17427480	an entire stream.
17427480	17429480	Maybe if you work from home
17429480	17431480	or you're listening at work
17431480	17433480	but it's a bit dangerous listening at work
17433480	17435480	because sometimes I tease a lot.
17435480	17437480	Especially in ASMR streams
17437480	17439480	I tease quite a lot.
17439480	17441480	This is me just having
17441480	17443480	a really good time.
17443480	17445480	So, I'm pretty tame right now from Brotherhood.
17445480	17447480	Yeah.
17447480	17449480	If you live in Turkaya
17451480	17453480	Arcadijim
17453480	17455480	means friend
17455480	17457480	and
17457480	17459480	Turkay.
17459480	17461480	I think.
17465480	17467480	Arcadij.
17471480	17473480	I work from home
17473480	17475480	and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.
17475480	17477480	So,
17477480	17479480	I'm definitely going to be...
17479480	17481480	How can you focus on work and listening at the same time though?
17481480	17483480	I feel like I could...
17483480	17485480	Unless it's like background noise.
17485480	17487480	Arcadijim.
17487480	17489480	I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations
17489480	17491480	because it's set in Turkey.
17491480	17493480	Never learn.
17493480	17495480	Pfft.
17501480	17503480	These guys are like the hardest enemies you can kind of get.
17503480	17505480	But if you just jump at them
17505480	17507480	you can get away with it.
17507480	17509480	Oh yeah, you just got to break their stance
17509480	17511480	and just look that down.
17511480	17513480	That's back to me.
17513480	17515480	The trick is, I don't really work.
17515480	17517480	So, this cutscene
17517480	17519480	is a glitch that was never patched out.
17519480	17521480	This is a full edited cutscene
17521480	17523480	where he like, go get my wife.
17523480	17525480	It never loads.
17525480	17527480	It will never load in time.
17527480	17529480	I have no idea what it looks like.
17529480	17531480	Well, I assume it looks like him
17531480	17533480	screaming at you
17533480	17535480	and then he gets his sword and goes off screen.
17535480	17537480	It will never load.
17537480	17539480	It doesn't matter what you do, it never loads.
17539480	17541480	Unless like maybe someone went into the game data
17541480	17543480	and like I went into free camera
17543480	17545480	possibly
17545480	17547480	and then you could definitely do it.
17547480	17549480	I said small poles only!
17551480	17553480	We don't want them being...
17553480	17555480	No! You've ruined my screen!
17557480	17559480	Okay, we did it though.
17559480	17561480	It's fine.
17561480	17563480	Can I open the gate please?
17563480	17565480	Become anonymous to open the gate.
17565480	17567480	There's no one attacking me.
17569480	17571480	There's no one attacking me.
17571480	17573480	Right, that's what I thought.
17573480	17575480	I was going to say, there's literally no one attacking me.
17577480	17579480	You underwaste my lack of shame.
17579480	17581480	I'm pretty sick of stuff that worked before.
17583480	17585480	Honestly, whatever helps pass the time
17585480	17587480	like I'm sorry but work can be so mundane.
17587480	17589480	Like the best work days
17589480	17591480	are the times where you're super busy
17591480	17593480	because you blink and it's the end of the day
17593480	17595480	but you are shattered, that's the only problem
17595480	17597480	like you're absolutely exhausted
17597480	17599480	and it's really...
17599480	17601480	So you're actually
17601480	17603480	on a timer in this section
17603480	17605480	and I only have six crossbow bolts
17605480	17607480	which I do not like at all right now.
17607480	17609480	Um...
17609480	17611480	You can.
17611480	17613480	I might mess up the sequence.
17613480	17615480	I do it quite a lot.
17615480	17617480	Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back!
17623480	17625480	Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it.
17625480	17627480	You need to air assassinate him for 100%.
17629480	17631480	Hold on.
17633480	17635480	You have no clue how many arrows I need to kill in the day.
17637480	17639480	I'm respected.
17641480	17643480	Yeah, I'm straight respected and not purchased.
17651480	17653480	Oh, you should probably go to sleep
17653480	17655480	if you need to be up in six hours.
17655480	17657480	It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.
17657480	17659480	Digi, no!
17659480	17661480	Men need eight hours of sleep
17661480	17663480	where women typically need ten hours of sleep.
17663480	17665480	But yeah,
17665480	17667480	actually, don't risk your health.
17669480	17671480	Sir Shameless, they call me.
17673480	17675480	I'll be honest, all your girls
17675480	17677480	make my work day go by real quick.
17677480	17679480	It's lovely.
17679480	17681480	That's amazing to hear.
17681480	17683480	A.P. Gall confirmed the Lord.
17685480	17687480	What is sleep?
17687480	17689480	Baby, don't stream more.
17689480	17691480	Don't stream more.
17691480	17693480	No more.
17693480	17695480	What is sleep?
17695480	17697480	Streamer.
17697480	17699480	Oh my god, a VTuber streamer parody of that song.
17699480	17701480	Let's go.
17703480	17705480	Okay.
17705480	17707480	Then you can collect both of these chests
17707480	17709480	if you're fast enough
17709480	17711480	whilst it's telling you this act is over.
17711480	17713480	I swear they purposely did this
17713480	17715480	because no other act takes so long
17715480	17717480	to complete the sequence six.
17717480	17719480	Like the ending bit to tell you it's over.
17719480	17721480	I decided a long time to destroy
17721480	17723480	my sleep schedule.
17723480	17725480	Practically, gal.
17727480	17729480	Excuse me.
17729480	17731480	Forget Pali.
17737480	17739480	Worth it, feels good.
17741480	17743480	Sleep, what is that?
17743480	17745480	Oh, she caught me.
17745480	17747480	If I can remember this sequence,
17747480	17749480	we might have to
17749480	17751480	do...
17751480	17753480	Oh, that reminds me.
17753480	17755480	There's actually a thieves challenge
17755480	17757480	which is to dive
17757480	17759480	200 meters, which you can do
17759480	17761480	off the top of this building.
17761480	17763480	So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.
17763480	17765480	Ready, steady,
17765480	17767480	whee!
17767480	17769480	There we go.
17769480	17771480	That's a thieves challenge done right there.
17771480	17773480	Dive complete.
17773480	17775480	Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves.
17775480	17777480	Fantastic.
17777480	17779480	I enjoy that.
17779480	17781480	I need to level them up a bit more before they pick pocket
17781480	17783480	but we're getting close to the point where we don't
17783480	17785480	like
17785480	17787480	mula like that. Where'd any go on the map?
17787480	17789480	Where are we?
17789480	17791480	What's our heading?
17791480	17793480	Okay, we've liberated
17793480	17795480	that Borgia zone which is fantastic.
17795480	17797480	Where's the mission?
17797480	17799480	Is it south?
17799480	17801480	The mission's in the thieves guild
17801480	17803480	which doesn't have a Borgia place
17803480	17805480	on the way but we'll start
17805480	17807480	trying to get all the Borgia towers.
17807480	17809480	I'm just going to use the old
17809480	17811480	teleport feature.
17813480	17815480	Yeah, yeah.
17815480	17817480	And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way
17817480	17819480	to get leveled up a bit more.
17819480	17821480	Watching your streams of high level.
17821480	17823480	Can you stop that?
17823480	17825480	Try and make me blush.
17825480	17827480	I literally just memed my bot off
17827480	17829480	playing a really good game.
17829480	17831480	Okay, we've got level 5
17831480	17833480	so we're starting to get a bit...
17833480	17835480	weapons now just so they have a few
17835480	17837480	more things.
17837480	17839480	We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third
17839480	17841480	signal.
17841480	17843480	Can I send you guys?
17847480	17849480	I'm going to send everyone
17849480	17851480	for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.
17853480	17855480	Like to get them really levelled up from the start.
17855480	17857480	So if they do end up in a fight
17857480	17859480	it's not a problem.
17859480	17861480	Is it working?
17861480	17863480	Yes.
17863480	17865480	Have you been killing people
17865480	17867480	with your horse?
17867480	17869480	Maybe they do.
17869480	17871480	No.
17871480	17873480	No.
17873480	17875480	They're not buying it.
17875480	17877480	He's like...
17877480	17879480	He's out there.
17879480	17881480	He looks like the...
17881480	17883480	Oh no, the words aren't working
17883480	17885480	in my head.
17885480	17887480	Please don't shoot me.
17887480	17889480	He looks up and
17889480	17891480	he remembers.
17891480	17893480	Ooh, I love birds.
17893480	17895480	Not at the bird and
17895480	17897480	people die everywhere.
17897480	17899480	People die.
17901480	17903480	I don't know the words.
17903480	17905480	But like I know the tune and everything.
17905480	17907480	Mmm.
17909480	17911480	What's Johnny means?
17911480	17913480	The most important meal of the day.
17917480	17919480	Mmm.
17919480	17921480	Mmm.
17921480	17923480	We're going to not grab that thief
17923480	17925480	because he's already claimed the wall.
17925480	17927480	I never chase thieves.
17927480	17929480	If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.
17929480	17931480	I absolutely cannot be bothered.
17931480	17933480	That's probably the only thing in this game
17933480	17935480	that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.
17935480	17937480	It's just like if you wanted to pocket the money
17937480	17939480	and whatever item is on their persons.
17941480	17943480	What am I doing?
17943480	17945480	What?
17945480	17947480	You guys want to do kegels together?
17947480	17949480	Are you ready?
17949480	17951480	Hold for three seconds.
17951480	17953480	One, two, three, release.
17953480	17955480	You know what?
17955480	17957480	You know what I learned about guys?
17957480	17959480	I learned this a while ago.
17959480	17961480	If a guy wants to jump start
17961480	17963480	his Eiffel Tower, he has to close
17963480	17965480	his end.
17965480	17967480	Which is crazy.
17967480	17969480	A little twitch there.
17969480	17971480	A little twitch there.
17971480	17973480	A little twitch there I guess.
17973480	17975480	Crazy lore for guys.
17975480	17977480	Absolutely crazy lore.
17977480	17979480	I don't know
17979480	17981480	if I was too generic with that.
17981480	17983480	In order to
17983480	17985480	achieve sword art.
17987480	17989480	Oh, and also
17989480	17991480	when you go to the toilet,
17991480	17993480	you're a poor little...
17997480	17999480	What do we call them?
17999480	18001480	You're a poor little...
18001480	18003480	I don't know
18003480	18005480	double eyeballs can touch
18005480	18007480	the toilet and it's super cold
18007480	18009480	and uncomfortable.
18009480	18011480	I only learned that super recently
18011480	18013480	because I saw a meme about it and I was like
18013480	18015480	wait what?
18015480	18017480	You're a poor little guy.
18017480	18019480	They're going to retract
18019480	18021480	and save you. They get too cold.
18021480	18023480	They're going to go straight back
18023480	18025480	up to your belly button. No!
18027480	18029480	Kill all the attackers.
18029480	18031480	Sure, sure, sure.
18037480	18039480	Wait, why are we in this? Oh, it's a fight.
18039480	18041480	It's a fight. And I just sent
18041480	18043480	all my assassins away.
18043480	18045480	Wait, who's the...
18047480	18049480	Wrong guy.
18049480	18051480	Wrong guy. You're hurting the wrong guy.
18053480	18055480	Where are the enemies?
18055480	18057480	Got an enemy.
18057480	18059480	Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
18059480	18061480	Enema, give them an enema.
18063480	18065480	Do not give them an enema.
18065480	18067480	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
18067480	18069480	Whoa! That was so cool
18069480	18071480	that attack. The double splash over.
18071480	18073480	I really enjoyed that.
18079480	18081480	What? What? Where did that come from?
18081480	18083480	Eh, eh.
18085480	18087480	Go away.
18087480	18089480	They scare me. That's a renise.
18089480	18091480	Bad boy, bad boy.
18091480	18093480	Bad boy, bad boy.
18093480	18095480	Bad boy.
18095480	18097480	Oh, it missed.
18101480	18103480	Okay, let's get this big guard.
18103480	18105480	Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.
18105480	18107480	I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.
18107480	18109480	I think I'm going to have to get food and refill
18109480	18111480	in a second because I'm starting to
18111480	18113480	get a little bit delirious.
18113480	18115480	I'm going to get some egg
18115480	18117480	and I think I'll go ravioli.
18117480	18119480	Yeah.
18119480	18121480	Maybe a wee bit longer.
18121480	18123480	Maybe a three minute break.
18123480	18125480	Three whole minutes away from stream. I cannot believe it.
18125480	18127480	I cannot believe it. Absolutely unprofessional.
18127480	18129480	Unacceptable.
18131480	18133480	Oh, that makes sense.
18135480	18137480	Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed
18137480	18139480	and Brotherhood does really
18139480	18141480	quite work for the timing of the song.
18141480	18143480	She hates us now.
18145480	18147480	Hello.
18147480	18149480	How many hours?
18149480	18151480	Five hours? Oh, it's been five hours already.
18151480	18153480	I've been gushing about this game.
18153480	18155480	You know what, Reeflings?
18155480	18157480	Life's good.
18157480	18159480	Full stop. Life is good.
18161480	18163480	Got to do my thing.
18163480	18165480	We having a good time mimin' along.
18165480	18167480	I'm rambling away about any old shite
18167480	18169480	that passes my brain.
18169480	18171480	Life is good.
18173480	18175480	We're about to go get some juice.
18175480	18177480	I think I'll make a tea.
18177480	18179480	Yeah, I'll make a tea.
18179480	18181480	You'll get some food.
18181480	18183480	Maybe some snacky too.
18183480	18185480	I don't think I need to pee.
18185480	18187480	No pee yet.
18189480	18191480	Actually, I should probably get up so I'm not that far behind him
18191480	18193480	because he is like so far ahead of me.
18195480	18197480	Oh no!
18197480	18199480	I think he has perished.
18199480	18201480	But thieves are ours.
18201480	18203480	Yunkers, you're mine now.
18205480	18207480	They are...
18207480	18209480	I...
18209480	18211480	I don't really want to kick him to death.
18211480	18213480	Make it quick. See, don't make him suffer.
18213480	18215480	My goodness.
18215480	18217480	It's a bit morbid.
18217480	18219480	I think I'd rather make it quick
18219480	18221480	and painless, not drag it out.
18221480	18223480	Oh, he got the horse! How did he do that?
18223480	18225480	I don't know how he did that,
18225480	18227480	but do it again.
18227480	18229480	It looked like he did it with sort of.
18233480	18235480	Well, it's 1am, so I'll take my leave.
18235480	18237480	Please, rest well. Anyone who does have to rest
18237480	18239480	or to sleepie bye bye.
18239480	18241480	Please don't worry.
18241480	18243480	Odds are. I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.
18243480	18245480	I said it.
18245480	18247480	Yeah, it's true.
18247480	18249480	It's true. I might finish the campaign
18249480	18251480	and I might want to do some more. It's true.
18251480	18253480	It's true. The accusations are true.
18253480	18255480	So don't worry if you have to go to bed.
18255480	18257480	I might see you when you wake up.
18257480	18259480	So sweet dreams.
18259480	18261480	See you in the morning.
18263480	18265480	Jump off wall. Get kicked into wall.
18267480	18269480	The accusations are true.
18269480	18271480	I'm addicted.
18271480	18273480	But not as much as I'm addicted to you.
18273480	18275480	You guys might have the nicotine patch
18275480	18277480	on your head, but the truth is
18277480	18279480	under these bangs
18279480	18281480	or fringe,
18281480	18283480	I've got a nicotine patch too
18283480	18285480	and it's covering my entire forehead.
18289480	18291480	I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.
18291480	18293480	Whoa.
18293480	18295480	Okay, there we go.
18295480	18297480	This is the Roman bath house.
18297480	18299480	This is based on reveal, please.
18299480	18301480	They are public bath houses.
18303480	18305480	Okay, there's a lot going on. Hold on.
18305480	18307480	There's a lot going on. Hold on.
18307480	18309480	Big armor guy.
18311480	18313480	My notoriety is going
18313480	18315480	up.
18315480	18317480	I like how he just swings that air.
18317480	18319480	Can we get him while he's on the floor?
18319480	18321480	Get him on the floor!
18321480	18323480	Ow!
18323480	18325480	Get him on the floor!
18325480	18327480	Lavolpi!
18327480	18329480	Old man.
18329480	18331480	Put your Glex on.
18331480	18333480	Put your Glex on.
18333480	18335480	It's me!
18337480	18339480	He plays in the first danote.
18339480	18341480	He plays in the first danote.
18341480	18343480	That was definitely a VA.
18343480	18345480	They had used the law and they were like,
18345480	18347480	please just use any other voice.
18347480	18349480	It's going to be so obvious it's you.
18349480	18351480	So he had to go,
18351480	18353480	and play tonight.
18353480	18355480	Or a V sucking.
18355480	18357480	I don't have nicotine.
18357480	18359480	I have B.L.R.
18359480	18361480	That's so good.
18361480	18363480	Sleep is for the weak. I don't know.
18363480	18365480	Sleep is very healthy and apparently
18365480	18367480	you sleep regularly.
18367480	18369480	Then it's bad for your longevity.
18369480	18371480	And you might expire.
18371480	18373480	We don't really want...
18373480	18375480	I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.
18375480	18377480	I'm going to tell you the truth.
18377480	18379480	I'd rather you didn't expire.
18379480	18381480	So, please don't.
18383480	18385480	We're getting some strawny time though.
18385480	18387480	You're getting strawny time
18387480	18389480	for a very long time every day.
18389480	18391480	You're going to be sick of me.
18391480	18393480	Yeah.
18395480	18397480	Benenene.
18397480	18399480	Benenene.
18399480	18401480	The music's so good.
18401480	18403480	There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum
18403480	18405480	but we can get that at a later time.
18405480	18407480	Mananana.
18407480	18409480	Mananana.
18409480	18411480	Mananana.
18411480	18413480	We are...
18413480	18415480	We expire.
18415480	18417480	Survive for a moment.
18417480	18419480	Not only am I putting you at war,
18419480	18421480	I'm now expiring you manually.
18421480	18423480	You have been expired.
18423480	18425480	I literally glanced away
18425480	18427480	and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.
18427480	18429480	And I was like, oh, where is he?
18429480	18431480	Enemies. Enemies.
18431480	18433480	Enemies. Enemies.
18433480	18435480	Give them an animal.
18435480	18437480	Give the enemies an animal
18437480	18439480	for how much?
18439480	18441480	What the fuck?
18441480	18443480	I don't know.
18443480	18445480	I'm definitely using a quick
18445480	18447480	a quick five minute break for you guys.
18447480	18449480	I'll maybe read some Marshmallows
18449480	18451480	and we'll take a five minute break.
18451480	18453480	I'll eat and restore my
18453480	18455480	hydration levels and stuff.
18455480	18457480	Getting a wee bit delirious.
18457480	18459480	Just a wee bit.
18459480	18461480	Why is there so many guards this time?
18461480	18463480	I don't really recall this game.
18463480	18465480	Like this part having so many guards.
18465480	18467480	Look at this guy on the edge
18467480	18469480	over there.
18469480	18471480	Oh, what?
18471480	18473480	Are we all going?
18473480	18475480	Okay, he's stuck.
18475480	18477480	There. Okay, there we go.
18477480	18479480	All good. All good in the head.
18479480	18481480	She's got enemies on the brain.
18481480	18483480	Freudian slip.
18483480	18485480	Enemies. Enemies.
18485480	18487480	Sorry, I stuck them out.
18487480	18489480	It's like a really dumb...
18489480	18491480	Can I summon Leonardo?
18491480	18493480	I can. So on these benches
18493480	18495480	is where you can buy more of Leonardo's
18495480	18497480	inventions.
18497480	18499480	Um...
18499480	18501480	Is there a thing up there?
18501480	18503480	No, it's on the other side.
18503480	18505480	Leave me alone.
18505480	18507480	Leave me alone.
18507480	18509480	Never.
18509480	18511480	Never.
18511480	18513480	Leave me alone.
18513480	18515480	Leave me alone.
18515480	18517480	What did you ask the scrawny animal
18517480	18519480	marriage when?
18519480	18521480	You expect me to come in the middle
18521480	18523480	of the night? Do you think I would?
18527480	18529480	I drank a good stretch.
18529480	18531480	Right, we'll finish this sequence
18531480	18533480	because
18533480	18535480	I think this is a quick sequence.
18535480	18537480	I think we're already, like, pretty much getting through it.
18537480	18539480	We're about to claim the costumes
18539480	18541480	off of enemies.
18541480	18543480	Do you think my assassin recruits
18543480	18545480	have finished the mission?
18551480	18553480	So, Lavalpe is now convinced
18553480	18555480	Marquiovelli is a thief.
18555480	18557480	It is a traitor
18557480	18559480	because the events
18559480	18561480	are synchronizing up too much.
18561480	18563480	Cesare leaves the castle
18563480	18565480	when
18565480	18567480	he could have got tipped off.
18567480	18569480	Marquiovelli uses guards
18569480	18571480	to tell him secrets of the Borgia
18571480	18573480	and
18573480	18575480	Lavalpe finds it
18575480	18577480	just far too suspicious
18577480	18579480	and he's basically
18579480	18581480	telling us
18581480	18583480	if you do not put an end
18583480	18585480	to Lavalpe
18585480	18587480	to Marquiovelli
18587480	18589480	I'll do it myself.
18589480	18591480	Which is
18591480	18593480	scary biscuits and scary bean.
18593480	18595480	I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.
18595480	18597480	Oh my god, did you hear my voice there?
18597480	18599480	For you.
18599480	18601480	For you.
18601480	18603480	Would you still love me if I send it?
18603480	18605480	Like, oh.
18605480	18607480	I'm
18607480	18609480	wrecking and decking.
18609480	18611480	We're on sequence six.
18611480	18613480	Act six and
18613480	18615480	there's nine acts again.
18617480	18619480	Yes, I write you would.
18621480	18623480	Which was an accident.
18633480	18635480	Italy lore, Italy lore.
18643480	18645480	Can't believe it.
18645480	18647480	He said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.
18651480	18653480	I
18655480	18657480	have friends that try to tell me that
18657480	18659480	Assassin's Creed
18659480	18661480	this Assassin's Creed brotherhood isn't a good game.
18661480	18663480	There's so many kill mechanics
18663480	18665480	in brotherhood. Wish they didn't
18665480	18667480	steal the DLC though.
18667480	18669480	Yeah.
18669480	18671480	It's a shame.
18671480	18673480	DLC was really the height.
18675480	18677480	Oh.
18677480	18679480	He said no one else is allowed
18679480	18681480	I obey.
18681480	18683480	Oh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.
18683480	18685480	We obey.
18685480	18687480	We obey.
18687480	18689480	We obey Sheebie please.
18691480	18693480	Okay, now this horse
18693480	18695480	constantly gets turned around
18695480	18697480	so you really can't be too close to him like at all.
18697480	18699480	We obey Sheebie, we obey.
18699480	18701480	We do not question, we obey.
18705480	18707480	Just taking
18707480	18709480	our time with this guy because
18709480	18711480	he's so,
18711480	18713480	he spins around so easily
18713480	18715480	and you can desync so quick.
18719480	18721480	Taking our time.
18721480	18723480	Easy.
18723480	18725480	Use it.
18729480	18731480	This might be the longest hailing mission
18731480	18733480	they've actually put in the game.
18733480	18735480	Ah.
18735480	18737480	The entire act is just
18737480	18739480	hailing missions.
18739480	18741480	Now don't get me wrong,
18741480	18743480	I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.
18743480	18745480	If I complain about
18745480	18747480	gameplay I would rather suggest
18747480	18749480	something else that's supposed to happen
18749480	18751480	but if you consider all the different
18751480	18753480	types of mechanics
18753480	18755480	or subjects
18755480	18757480	that's put in the game, for example
18757480	18759480	like the lair
18759480	18761480	of Romulis
18761480	18763480	or Leonardo's missions
18763480	18765480	these are completely alternative.
18765480	18767480	If you're gonna be like
18767480	18769480	I don't really enjoy the hailing missions, I completely understand that.
18769480	18771480	I'm not dogging on your comment by the way
18771480	18773480	I'm just discussing it from
18773480	18775480	if you ever wanted to
18775480	18777480	review it. Oh by the way these guards
18777480	18779480	useless. Absolutely useless.
18781480	18783480	You can just walk straight in.
18785480	18787480	I think you can also walk past these two
18787480	18789480	if you get
18789480	18791480	into that hay bale, they just forget you exist.
18791480	18793480	They like think you're a far...
18793480	18795480	OOOH!
18795480	18797480	Woopsies! Woopsies! Woopsies!
18797480	18799480	Woopsies! Woopsies!
18799480	18801480	So it doesn't matter if the guards
18801480	18803480	spot me, it's not a problem.
18803480	18805480	Although if I run it does fulfill the
18805480	18807480	can you go in the hay bale?
18807480	18809480	Jeez, my goodness gravy.
18809480	18811480	It's evil. Are you okay?
18811480	18813480	I'm a little nervous now, honestly.
18815480	18817480	You can, if they stop looking at me
18817480	18819480	yep, okay, yeah.
18819480	18821480	You hardly have to kill anyone
18821480	18823480	in these kind of things.
18823480	18825480	The game is so forgiving, that's why I absolutely
18825480	18827480	adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
18827480	18829480	It is so forgiving.
18829480	18831480	Now don't get me wrong, you'll still get a few
18831480	18833480	things where they're like, that shouldn't have got me, but
18833480	18835480	yeah.
18835480	18837480	It's so forgiving. So if you hide in the hay bale
18837480	18839480	wait for this guy to come up and then
18839480	18841480	send in a... oh he doesn't come up.
18841480	18843480	Well wait for the guy to go
18843480	18845480	away and then... yep, there you go.
18845480	18847480	Boom! Cluster McCord.
18849480	18851480	Boom!
18853480	18855480	So...
18855480	18857480	he gets on a horse
18857480	18859480	you're actually supposed to go over here
18859480	18861480	to get on a horse
18861480	18863480	to continue to follow him.
18865480	18867480	But it's not really obvious
18867480	18869480	like most people would just chase on foot
18869480	18871480	which is completely doable
18871480	18873480	but for some reason they put the horses
18873480	18875480	a wee bit to the left and
18875480	18877480	uh, yeah.
18878480	18880480	It's a bit harder to
18880480	18882480	recognise, but yeah definitely this game
18882480	18884480	if you've never played Assassin's Creed before
18884480	18886480	I would actually...
18886480	18888480	you'd miss out on the plot of 2
18888480	18890480	which is the start of Itsu's story
18890480	18893480	but mechanic and forgiveness wise
18893480	18895480	if you're not really a strong gamer
18895480	18897480	Brotherhood definitely is one for you.
18899480	18901480	Ah my tummy's wumbling if you heard that
18901480	18903480	You probably can't over the gameplay actually.
18903480	18905480	The fact that you're passionate about the game
18905480	18907480	it's just...
18907480	18909480	you latch onto something, you can play a game
18909480	18911480	and you have absolutely no idea what to expect
18911480	18913480	and then you just adore it like a binding
18913480	18915480	of Isaac is another game
18915480	18917480	I didn't know what to expect
18917480	18919480	and like the first time I played it
18919480	18921480	I think I played it for like 5 hours and can't...
18921480	18923480	He did the turnaround thing
18923480	18925480	he's now supposed to do
18925480	18927480	and now he's chasing me!
18927480	18929480	Leave me alone!
18929480	18931480	Oh my god...
18931480	18933480	that was... that was gonna
18933480	18935480	he sinks so hard all because he freaking
18935480	18937480	turned around!
18937480	18939480	I knew you were gonna do that
18939480	18941480	I warned you guys
18941480	18943480	he always turns around in this tailing mission
18943480	18945480	he gets caught on NPCs
18945480	18947480	and spins around
18947480	18949480	and it scares me
18949480	18951480	every time I never expect that
18953480	18955480	he was chasing me though
18955480	18957480	I don't normally expect them to like turn around
18957480	18959480	and chase but I guess
18959480	18961480	if you're close enough they will
18963480	18965480	I'm also visiting your mom
18967480	18969480	Have a nice visit
18969480	18971480	sorry I was gonna say something really mean
18971480	18973480	but I refrained
18973480	18975480	I was gonna say
18975480	18977480	I saw her earlier the day
18977480	18979480	Oh he's done it again!
18979480	18981480	No way I'm reading chat! Don't do that again!
18981480	18983480	Don't do that again!
18983480	18985480	You're giving me a heart attack
18985480	18987480	Goodness me
18987480	18989480	This Johnny's off to visit his mom
18989480	18991480	Doing your mom!
18991480	18993480	You know he's strictly doing your mom!
18997480	18999480	So
18999480	19001480	Oh!
19001480	19003480	Please don't attack me
19005480	19007480	Let the recruits deal with the
19007480	19009480	Oh this isn't the right way!
19009480	19011480	This isn't the way to victory
19011480	19013480	to victory to victory
19013480	19015480	This ain't the way to victory
19015480	19017480	My assassins are now fighting it out
19017480	19019480	I hope they're leveled up enough
19019480	19021480	to deal with them
19021480	19023480	to deal with them to deal with them
19023480	19025480	I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them
19025480	19027480	because I don't have any more recruits
19029480	19031480	Oh no I needed recruits to
19031480	19033480	100% this mission
19033480	19035480	Can I just stand about
19035480	19037480	and wait for them to reappear
19037480	19039480	because I am patient enough
19039480	19041480	to do that
19043480	19045480	Destruction! Destruction!
19045480	19047480	Hmm
19047480	19049480	Oh I want to play GTA 4 actually
19051480	19053480	I need to go
19053480	19055480	I want to go bowling
19055480	19057480	Oh they didn't come
19057480	19059480	They
19059480	19061480	One more minute
19061480	19063480	Oh look they've lost the health bar
19063480	19065480	See that's why I always put it into health
19065480	19067480	because they can make as many mistakes as they need to
19067480	19069480	Wait why
19069480	19071480	am I getting yellowed
19071480	19073480	Why am I getting yellowed
19073480	19075480	My assassin recruits are going ham
19075480	19077480	Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not
19077480	19079480	Right that's fine
19079480	19081480	I can be detected
19081480	19083480	Who is shooting?
19083480	19085480	What is going on over there?
19085480	19087480	Do you not need to reload?
19087480	19089480	Hello?
19091480	19093480	They just despawned
19093480	19095480	Okay well as long as they're not dead
19095480	19097480	I guess jeez
19099480	19101480	Strudy!
19101480	19103480	Why not name your
19103480	19105480	Bro
19105480	19107480	Someone in chat has named himself
19107480	19109480	Fondle of bosom
19109480	19111480	Frickin
19111480	19113480	I can't see it anymore
19113480	19115480	Did mods time you ever for that?
19115480	19117480	That's hilarious
19117480	19119480	I read that
19119480	19121480	Fondle of bosom
19121480	19123480	Gen 0 be sucky
19123480	19125480	I don't see it anymore
19125480	19127480	Mods timed out it was funny
19127480	19129480	Unless you were spamming then get bonked
19129480	19131480	I have to admit
19133480	19135480	I almost ran out of time there
19135480	19137480	I'm too busy reading chat
19137480	19139480	I literally sounded like a monkey there
19139480	19141480	I'm not even pretending
19141480	19143480	I almost ran out of time
19145480	19147480	Alright do not turn around again
19147480	19149480	I'm going to be so upset
19149480	19151480	I don't think he does it too much in this sequence part
19151480	19153480	I don't know
19153480	19155480	It's the ghost of Christmas pass
19159480	19161480	Oh my
19161480	19163480	Oh my
19163480	19165480	My voice
19165480	19167480	My voice
19167480	19169480	Literally can't right now
19171480	19173480	Oh he's getting really far head actually
19173480	19175480	Hold on sorry I'm just really enjoying
19175480	19177480	Reading chat with you
19177480	19179480	I apologize
19179480	19181480	Because I remember that people enjoy
19181480	19183480	When they get their stuff read out
19183480	19185480	I never did my high
19185480	19187480	thing
19187480	19189480	Could I do the high thing?
19189480	19191480	Like so sometimes
19191480	19193480	When I started upstream I would actually
19193480	19195480	Read everyone's name out just to try
19195480	19197480	To be super thankful
19197480	19199480	Maybe for the ASMR stream
19199480	19201480	We could try it
19201480	19203480	Because I understand
19203480	19205480	People want to hear their
19205480	19207480	Name be said by me
19207480	19209480	Because it's nice to be acknowledged
19209480	19211480	Let's not pretend
19211480	19213480	It's not nice to have
19213480	19215480	Strummer reply directly type thing
19215480	19217480	Orally generally discuss it
19217480	19219480	So maybe in the ASMR stream
19219480	19221480	As a one off I will try my best
19221480	19223480	To say hi to everyone
19223480	19225480	You there
19225480	19227480	Perish
19227480	19229480	That's a lot of enemies
19229480	19231480	I got enemies
19231480	19233480	I'm calling in my recruits
19233480	19235480	Okay let's get to the fight
19237480	19239480	Take this
19239480	19241480	And this
19241480	19243480	And that
19243480	19245480	And
19247480	19249480	I actually
19249480	19251480	I'm gonna heal up
19251480	19253480	And try and pick up a medicine vial
19255480	19257480	Real names or username
19257480	19259480	I would never encourage anyone
19259480	19261480	To use their real name
19261480	19263480	On the internet
19263480	19265480	I name yourself
19265480	19267480	Something funny
19267480	19269480	Or a meme or after
19269480	19271480	A video game for example
19273480	19275480	There's no way I'm getting
19275480	19277480	Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him
19277480	19279480	I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer
19283480	19285480	It's you you're aimbot
19285480	19287480	Your armor is not that good sir
19287480	19289480	I know for a fact your armor is not that good
19291480	19293480	Give me my crossbow bolt back
19293480	19295480	Right now I know you have some on your persons
19295480	19297480	Not the knife
19297480	19299480	It's not a knife
19299480	19301480	That's a sword
19301480	19303480	You gave me my crossbow bolt back
19303480	19305480	That's exactly what I thought
19305480	19307480	You're not that guy
19307480	19309480	I started doing a marathon
19309480	19311480	Imagine if you did Arkham Knight
19311480	19313480	I do play Batman and go play the Batman
19313480	19315480	Please don't stop
19315480	19317480	And look at me
19317480	19319480	Please don't stop
19323480	19325480	The assassin should kill that third guy
19325480	19327480	What is going on
19327480	19329480	Why is it so loud when you guys
19329480	19331480	Kill people
19331480	19333480	Okay now the whole
19333480	19335480	Of like
19335480	19337480	Roma knows that you're like shooting
19337480	19339480	Guns over there
19343480	19345480	Oh my god it's Fond de la Buzum
19345480	19347480	I can't believe it are you gonna like roleplay
19347480	19349480	Zero in chat
19353480	19355480	Damn hope to see it
19355480	19357480	Long as please
19357480	19359480	I am much in your debt
19361480	19363480	He acts on stage
19363480	19365480	One of my men will
19365480	19367480	I guess you would go through the live chat participants
19367480	19369480	Wait I can see a list of everyone watching
19369480	19371480	No that's only on Twitch
19373480	19375480	Like maybe at the start
19375480	19377480	Of this ASMR
19377480	19379480	As a one off cause like it's just not plausible to like keep up
19379480	19381480	But just as a thank you for like showing up
19381480	19383480	Still being here still meaming around
19383480	19385480	Um
19385480	19387480	I haven't played Assassin's Creed
19387480	19389480	But it seems similar to Arkham Knights
19389480	19391480	I
19391480	19393480	Wouldn't entirely disagree
19393480	19395480	Very agile
19395480	19397480	Um
19397480	19399480	Very agility based
19399480	19401480	Definitely
19401480	19403480	Um
19403480	19405480	You know hunting around
19405480	19407480	This 100% is just don't kill anyone
19407480	19409480	If you scoot your bot all the way
19409480	19411480	Along the coliseum
19411480	19413480	Absolutely no issues
19413480	19415480	You shouldn't run into any guards if you do
19415480	19417480	You can literally just hang off the ledge
19417480	19419480	I wish I had the climbing glove though
19419480	19421480	That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch
19421480	19423480	For this part of the
19423480	19425480	Section
19425480	19427480	But unfortunately
19427480	19429480	I don't have that where am I supposed to go
19429480	19431480	Uh
19431480	19433480	So the watch point is all the way
19433480	19435480	Oh my god that stance
19435480	19437480	It actually looks pretty funny
19441480	19443480	Okay
19443480	19445480	We're gonna go for this
19445480	19447480	What
19447480	19449480	Whoa I didn't even realize that guard could see me
19449480	19451480	What? How could he even see me
19451480	19453480	We'll go for the viewpoint
19453480	19455480	And then we will
19455480	19457480	Continue with this mission this act is getting
19457480	19459480	Very close to being finished
19459480	19461480	And then we will have a five minute break
19461480	19463480	I will read any marshmallows
19463480	19465480	So if you want to ask any questions
19465480	19467480	Or more than can
19467480	19469480	I did miss some like during
19469480	19471480	The 2.0 and
19471480	19473480	The exposing
19473480	19475480	Just because
19475480	19477480	Not that it wasn't good enough
19477480	19479480	But maybe it wasn't like on subject
19479480	19481480	Or didn't quite necessarily relate to me
19481480	19483480	Like for the 2.0
19483480	19485480	So I just sent it
19485480	19487480	I might give that a good week
19487480	19489480	But you're welcome to ask any questions
19489480	19491480	We will rehydrate
19491480	19493480	I'm getting a T
19493480	19495480	My voice is perishing
19495480	19497480	Where am I supposed to go
19497480	19499480	Over there
19499480	19501480	There is a feather on top
19501480	19503480	Of the Colosseum but I'm actually happy
19503480	19505480	To just climb up again okay that's where we're supposed
19505480	19507480	To go
19507480	19509480	Couldn't see it because of the
19509480	19511480	Render distance but that's okay
19511480	19513480	Because this is an older game
19515480	19517480	If you look at the three dots
19517480	19519480	Where it has time stamp and reactions
19519480	19521480	And option to pop out chat
19521480	19523480	It says participants I think it's just chatters
19523480	19525480	That have typed in chat
19525480	19527480	I was just going to get you all to be like hi
19527480	19529480	And then start reading your name
19529480	19531480	Ear to ear
19533480	19535480	Senor
19535480	19537480	I've been going away for the last hour
19537480	19539480	No you haven't missed a thing
19539480	19541480	I'm giving away we are on
19541480	19543480	A sequence
19543480	19545480	Six
19545480	19547480	Which is
19547480	19549480	My god
19549480	19551480	Why has thou forsaken
19551480	19553480	Mhmm
19553480	19555480	Mhmm
19555480	19557480	Right heading out
19557480	19559480	Thank you for hanging again
19559480	19561480	Anyone who is watching you've done so far
19561480	19563480	You've done well so far
19563480	19565480	It's five and a half hours
19565480	19567480	I don't want to expect you to be here for the film
19567480	19569480	Please rest when you can
19569480	19571480	And also
19571480	19573480	Emi is streaming ASMR live if you'd like to check that out
19573480	19575480	Emi Bezo she has linked below
19575480	19577480	In my description
19577480	19579480	Thank you so much
19581480	19583480	Uh
19583480	19585480	So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs
19585480	19587480	We are about to finish up the sequence
19587480	19589480	We just need to eliminate
19589480	19591480	These three guards that come up
19591480	19593480	And then deal with the poison sequence
19593480	19595480	And then I believe
19597480	19599480	That the sequence is over
19599480	19601480	We are getting
19601480	19603480	Very close to finishing
19603480	19605480	The campaign
19605480	19607480	Very very close
19607480	19609480	Just run all the way around the call
19609480	19611480	Until you get up to the hay bale
19611480	19613480	There is a treasure chest I always ignore
19613480	19615480	We can always come back for it later
19615480	19617480	There you go
19617480	19619480	You can instantly assassinate the hay bale
19619480	19621480	And oh it's four targets
19621480	19623480	Excuse me
19623480	19625480	Such a fakey gamer
19625480	19627480	Again crossbow bolts are
19627480	19629480	Completely silent
19629480	19631480	They will not
19631480	19633480	Allure anyone to what has happened
19633480	19635480	In the area
19635480	19637480	Which is very nice
19637480	19639480	Unfortunately I'm running
19639480	19641480	Rather low on crossbow bolts
19641480	19643480	We are going to wait for this last guy
19643480	19645480	To come out on his own
19645480	19647480	Because if you actually go in there
19647480	19649480	There is a high chance of him just like straight up
19649480	19651480	Turning around and looking at you
19651480	19653480	And then you have to replay this little section again
19653480	19655480	Don't recommend it up to you
19655480	19657480	But he will notice the body
19657480	19659480	And then you get the perfect kill
19659480	19661480	I'm going to loot his body
19661480	19663480	Just because again we are a bit low on crossbow bolts
19663480	19665480	What the fuck is
19665480	19667480	And then you just need to jump down
19667480	19669480	On this little
19669480	19671480	How do you call it
19671480	19673480	Hanging
19673480	19675480	Okay
19675480	19677480	Or just don't touch
19677480	19679480	Any of it and land on your ankles
19679480	19681480	Perfectly fine, don't need them
19681480	19683480	Just completely ignore everything
19683480	19685480	My goodness
19685480	19687480	You saw me reach my armor
19691480	19693480	Just fall to the floor
19693480	19695480	Literally splat
19695480	19697480	You may notice that our health bar
19697480	19699480	Is increasing even though I'm not
19699480	19701480	Buying any new armor or anything
19701480	19703480	That's because after every act
19703480	19705480	You unlock a new health bar
19705480	19707480	So it's not necessary to use your
19707480	19709480	Florence on
19709480	19711480	Armor but
19711480	19713480	If you definitely are new to the
19713480	19715480	Assassin's Creed it helps out so much
19715480	19717480	It's fantastic and please
19717480	19719480	Utilize the tailor's
19719480	19721480	Shops because tailor's shops
19721480	19723480	Have pouches that increase
19723480	19725480	How much medicine you can hold
19725480	19727480	How much throwing
19727480	19729480	Knives, how many crossbow bolts for example
19733480	19735480	I cannot recommend this game
19735480	19737480	Seriously
19737480	19739480	It's about 8 hours total
19739480	19741480	For campaign if you just ignore everything
19741480	19743480	If you want to have a good time and explore
19743480	19745480	You could easily pump
19745480	19747480	Maybe 16 hours
19747480	19749480	It's good
19749480	19751480	Good game
19751480	19753480	My knees could never do that
19753480	19755480	No, I don't think anyone's knees
19755480	19757480	Could have accomplished such a feat
19757480	19759480	Although I could have sworn
19759480	19761480	I saw some videos
19761480	19763480	Of like
19763480	19765480	You know in Portal 2
19765480	19767480	The apparatus that's on the legs
19767480	19769480	To stop any fall damage from occurring
19769480	19771480	I'm sure someone was developing that tech
19771480	19773480	At one point
19773480	19775480	Like maybe for super soldier
19775480	19777480	But yeah
19779480	19781480	Are you on steam?
19781480	19783480	Yeah, I'm playing on steam right now
19783480	19785480	I was gonna try
19785480	19787480	And do
19787480	19789480	Do an Xbox Game Pass
19789480	19791480	But it's not currently on it right now
19791480	19793480	So
19793480	19795480	We don't get the gamer score
19795480	19797480	You cannot say Pietro
19797480	19799480	Yeah
19799480	19801480	The wine he drank was poison
19801480	19803480	As I promised Cesare
19803480	19805480	Poison stinky
19805480	19807480	Can anyone look up
19807480	19809480	If Cuttlefish have poison
19809480	19811480	I don't know my lore
19811480	19813480	I did not come here to kill you
19813480	19815480	Maybe my poison can...
19815480	19817480	Oh, well I do ink, but is ink poisonous?
19817480	19819480	No, it's a deterrent
19819480	19821480	Cause I can be preyed upon
19821480	19823480	So ink is to hate me
19823480	19825480	I can be
19825480	19827480	Heck yeah I can
19827480	19829480	You know see my teeth
19829480	19831480	This was not in rehearsal
19831480	19833480	I wish I had aim like that
19833480	19835480	That's cool
19835480	19837480	Actually that's a really
19837480	19839480	I would
19839480	19841480	No
19841480	19843480	Maybe
19843480	19845480	Do you think we could set up axe throwing
19845480	19847480	At a VTuber convention?
19847480	19849480	I feel like that would be so fun
19849480	19851480	Legend of people
19851480	19853480	Like can hit the spot or not
19853480	19855480	I feel like it's so specific
19855480	19857480	Whoa, whoa, whoa Jesus
19857480	19859480	Pick him up, pick him up
19859480	19861480	Quite literally Jesus
19861480	19863480	Oh his health is going down
19863480	19865480	Cause of the poison
19865480	19867480	I've never noticed that before
19869480	19871480	Other way
19871480	19873480	Sorry assassin recruits
19873480	19875480	I'm gonna need you to like hurry up and perish
19875480	19877480	These people like right now Pietro is
19877480	19879480	Oh
19881480	19883480	That's a reefling
19883480	19885480	After I'm done with him in the ASMR booth
19893480	19895480	If you team up a company that does axe throwing
19897480	19899480	Me next
19899480	19901480	Me next
19905480	19907480	This is me giving you cola
19907480	19909480	To make you feel better
19909480	19911480	Give me the keys
19913480	19915480	The castello
19915480	19917480	Oh did I tell you that
19917480	19919480	After
19935480	19937480	It's the real traitor
19937480	19939480	It's not Marquia Valley at all
19941480	19943480	It's you
19943480	19945480	Random thief from cutscene
19945480	19947480	Oh no
19947480	19949480	No, no, no, no
19949480	19951480	Horse, please
19951480	19953480	Please
19953480	19955480	I can't chase my horse right now
19955480	19957480	I don't know
19957480	19959480	I think if I fail this section
19959480	19961480	If you jump you can jump past the guards
19961480	19963480	In the AI no longer targets you
19963480	19965480	I don't know why
19965480	19967480	I'm scared
19967480	19969480	I can hear the horse going
19969480	19971480	Please
19971480	19973480	Please
19973480	19975480	Please leave me alone
19975480	19977480	Leave me alone
19977480	19979480	Leave me alone
19979480	19981480	Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse
19981480	19983480	At least
19983480	19985480	Come here
19985480	19987480	Come Heather
19987480	19989480	Move on
19995480	19997480	Oh
19999480	20001480	That's awful
20007480	20009480	Where'd I go?
20009480	20011480	The green on the map
20011480	20013480	I can't remember the section very well
20015480	20017480	I think I can run
20019480	20021480	If we do not stop
20021480	20023480	Lavofi
20023480	20025480	No
20025480	20027480	To 100%
20027480	20029480	You're not to swim
20029480	20031480	No, don't pick
20031480	20033480	Jesus
20033480	20035480	Goodness
20035480	20037480	Gravy
20037480	20039480	Oh my god, I'm taking the long way
20039480	20041480	Around
20041480	20043480	Panic
20045480	20047480	What are you doing
20047480	20049480	Why would you randomly grab
20049480	20051480	That poor man's horse
20051480	20053480	Climb the wall
20053480	20055480	And steal
20055480	20057480	Please, that's a tamed machine
20057480	20059480	They stress me out so much
20059480	20061480	Please, I just want 100%
20061480	20063480	So I never have to do it again
20063480	20065480	Please, please, please
20065480	20067480	Why would you randomly take that poor man's horse
20071480	20073480	I get too stressed
20073480	20075480	I hate them
20075480	20077480	I hate them
20077480	20079480	Oh my god
20079480	20081480	This is good news
20081480	20083480	More than you know
20083480	20085480	I am once again in your debt, Ezio
20085480	20087480	What debt is that amongst friends
20087480	20089480	Trust one another
20089480	20091480	Yes
20091480	20093480	Thank you for relaying the message to me
20093480	20095480	That poor man's horse
20095480	20097480	Okay
20097480	20099480	Lavofi and Markioville
20101480	20103480	Now trust each other
20103480	20105480	It seems Jezu Cristo was
20105480	20107480	That is erected three days ago
20109480	20111480	Ta-da
20111480	20113480	Checkpoint reach
20113480	20115480	That's not the end
20115480	20117480	It is the end of that
20117480	20119480	We're just being teased
20119480	20121480	Crazy man's
20121480	20123480	Steal's horse jumps off and runs up wall
20123480	20125480	Literally if you hit
20125480	20127480	Like a graphic thing
20127480	20129480	Like this at an angle
20129480	20131480	Ezio refuses to climb
20131480	20133480	In the wall and it gives me a heart attack
20133480	20135480	Every time
20137480	20139480	Look, our thieves are in the
20139480	20141480	Our recruits are in the background
20141480	20143480	Look, it's you in the background
20143480	20145480	It's you in the cutscene
20145480	20147480	Not right now
20147480	20149480	I can't see them
20153480	20155480	It is pain
20155480	20157480	Claudia is going to become an assassin
20161480	20163480	We work in the dark
20163480	20165480	To serve the light
20165480	20167480	Yeah, absolutely
20167480	20169480	Cannot say any of those words
20169480	20171480	Do not ask me to recite that
20171480	20173480	I can say that part
20173480	20175480	We're in our training
20175480	20177480	Oh my god, look at you all reflames
20177480	20179480	There's so many of you
20179480	20181480	Like, reflames is my system
20183480	20185480	I'm reciting it right now
20191480	20193480	I offer the choice to you
20193480	20195480	Join us
20195480	20197480	Oh my god, they're going to hold hands
20197480	20199480	Yay
20199480	20201480	She's an assassin
20201480	20203480	If you get an assassin, you have to be branded
20203480	20205480	On your wedding ringer
20205480	20207480	Wedding finger
20207480	20209480	Where the ring goes
20211480	20213480	Is your sister single?
20213480	20215480	Hi, Claudia
20215480	20219480	You and I have not seen eye to eye on many issues
20219480	20223480	But you are exactly what the order means
20223480	20225480	We cannot promote it
20225480	20227480	You have led the charge against the Templars
20227480	20229480	And rebuilt this brother
20229480	20231480	Now we must put Ezio where he belongs
20231480	20233480	A refling
20233480	20235480	Oh my god, his reflames crowning me
20235480	20237480	As their Ushides
20237480	20239480	Ezio Auditore da Fivenze
20239480	20241480	You will now be known as Il Mentore
20241480	20243480	The guardian of our order
20243480	20245480	And our secrets
20247480	20249480	No, I can't be Kama Oshi
20249480	20251480	I don't mind Oshi, but Kama Oshi is impossible
20251480	20253480	To live up to, that's not possible
20253480	20255480	Remember, nothing is true
20255480	20257480	Everything is permanent
20257480	20261480	Where other men are limited by morality and law
20261480	20263480	Remember, everything is permitted
20263480	20265480	Everything is permitted
20267480	20269480	It's Ezio before or after, he is after
20269480	20271480	Altair is like
20271480	20273480	I don't even know what century Altair is
20273480	20275480	Why this sudden change of heart?
20275480	20277480	I'm a cameo assassin
20277480	20279480	I always should buy
20279480	20281480	I was the one who brought you to Roma
20281480	20283480	And the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello
20283480	20285480	What?
20285480	20289480	The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well
20289480	20291480	You just did not know it
20291480	20295480	Maestro Mattiavelli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone
20295480	20297480	He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo
20297480	20299480	Thank you
20299480	20303480	The decision is yours, not mine
20303480	20307480	Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think
20307480	20311480	Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?
20311480	20313480	Go kill them, Mentore
20313480	20315480	Finish what you start
20315480	20317480	Good advice
20319480	20321480	I'll tell you right about the book about you one day
20321480	20323480	If you do
20323480	20325480	You might wish you since day one just accept it
20325480	20327480	I don't get how
20329480	20333480	You tell me you consumed all of these content creators
20333480	20335480	And you're like
20335480	20337480	Yeah, that one
20337480	20339480	Out of them all
20339480	20341480	We have finished sequence seven
20341480	20343480	There are two more sequences
20343480	20347480	And then we've done the campaign
20347480	20349480	It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought
20349480	20351480	I've still got a couple more hours in me
20351480	20353480	Okay
20353480	20355480	When it clicks it clicks
20355480	20359480	You don't pick the Oshi, the Oshi does pick you
20359480	20361480	When you know you know
20361480	20363480	Wait, the game is really that short
20363480	20367480	If you ignore everything and do campaign only
20367480	20369480	Send it on the campaign then
20369480	20371480	On it's way
20371480	20375480	Pretty, you can wrap up
20375480	20377480	Real quick
20377480	20381480	I am going to destroy another tower
20381480	20385480	Because I want to unlock this third signal
20385480	20387480	And then we will
20387480	20389480	Actually, you know what
20389480	20393480	I'm going to send my assassins on a mission
20393480	20395480	I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea
20395480	20397480	And get some food
20397480	20399480	And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves
20399480	20401480	A little tea break
20401480	20405480	Let's send some of the wee
20405480	20407480	Like everyone for that one mission
20407480	20411480	No ideal, but it's fine
20411480	20413480	Can you 100% not?
20413480	20415480	You can, so that will be a level up
20415480	20418480	Right, everyone
20418480	20420480	I don't want to be too close to the pigeons
20420480	20422480	Because they literally go
20422480	20424480	In your ear
20424480	20426480	Hopefully that's not too bad
20426480	20428480	For ambience
20428480	20431480	Everyone, please do consider standing up
20431480	20434480	And getting your legs and blood flow going
20434480	20435480	Or wiggle your toes
20435480	20436480	If you're that lazy
20436480	20438480	Stretch your feet and pull them back and forth
20438480	20441480	So your muscles and your calves
20441480	20443480	Like come back and forth
20443480	20445480	Go for a peep, get some water
20445480	20447480	Some snacks, some juicy juice
20447480	20449480	Hypotenuse
20449480	20453480	And I will be back in roughly
20453480	20455480	Three minutes
20455480	20457480	I'm going to try and heat up ravioli
20457480	20460480	Like fast as anything
20460480	20462480	So I will be a moment
20462480	20464480	I would like to watch Emi while she does ASMR live
20464480	20466480	Her link is in my description
20466480	20468480	You can do that right now, okay?
20468480	20470480	I will do the old pretending to sleep
20470480	20473480	And then I'll open up the game again, okay?
20473480	20475480	So don't worry
20475480	20477480	Don't worry about it

20936480	20938480	It caused my eyes
20956480	20962480	I had no idea I alive eight aid
20962480	20965480	Oh we already had endocrine come back as well
20965480	20975160	back as well. I've got me, I've got all my food. I have a bowl and it has rice
20975160	20985880	pea snacks. It has two stick meat and one egg and two eggs. I'm just gonna send this
20985880	20992120	assassin away to get like even more stronger and because we're caned again
20993040	21007680	Jesus is there any level 3's? I'm like absolutely feasting. I've got fruit juice
21007680	21013600	with me. I've got a bottle of water. I've got cup of tea with honey in it.
21013680	21021800	Like, ah, um, oh, not again, would you stop doing that? You're embarrassing me.
21021800	21030000	We're driving this controller. Yes, eh, so I'm gonna like munch and play but I
21030000	21034040	didn't bring any napkins so I might have to suck the egg out of the bowl which
21034040	21045080	sounds bizarre but can you say the second drink again? The fruit juice? It's like, it's
21045080	21055640	got mango in it. It's like super healthy juice. And a cup of tea. Wait, you can't, what?
21055640	21062680	Bottle of water. Oh, bottle of water. I didn't say it like the British say it. Well, I consider
21062720	21067360	the British, English, and the memes like kind of about the English say the bottle of water.
21067360	21072560	I don't know if I need to slurp this egg because I really can't be bothered getting,
21072560	21080880	where am I supposed to be going? How far away is this location? Oh, it's the castle,
21080880	21089760	right. I'm gonna try, I'm gonna get rid of this. Oh, says he's a coward though. It's really annoying
21089800	21097760	trying to get keywords because they actually run away. Actually, give me one second, my room is
21097760	21117400	on fire because of this PC. Oh, it's been robbed! I look away for five seconds and it's been robbed!
21117920	21123160	Oh, right, I don't need the money that much. It's fine, it's fine, great. Let me put my head
21123160	21127320	down because I actually can't hear the game right now. Did he just run up to me and like,
21127320	21141520	rob me? Right. Not seeing my room's hope, but too hope it's just came in through a ring in it.
21141520	21147120	Honestly, I'm sweltering. I don't know if that's the Scottish word, sweltering. Do you see that?
21147120	21156760	I'm sweltering. Sweating my beats off. Although I feel like sweating my beats off probably comes
21156760	21165680	from like, is it Mardi Gras? Like that party that Americans have where you unveil yourself and you
21165680	21170160	get beats as a reward? Like, I think that's where that saying might have came from because that just
21170160	21175440	makes sense. Like, oh, I'm sweating my beats off because I'm like showing the goods so much and so
21175520	21186880	often. Right, where on earth has this captain? I really don't want to mess it up because if you
21186880	21195280	mess it up and he runs away in time, you have to wait until the following day. Oh, I think I know
21195280	21201120	who this one is. I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. No, see, oh, you know the guy
21201200	21207680	that can see you right now? I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him, but he can lock onto me.
21207680	21219760	See you stinky AI. Perish. Oh, beats of sweat that come off your head. Oh, you know what? Yeah,
21219760	21225840	now that you've said that, that makes more sense. Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is. Okay,
21226560	21230720	where's, yes, I knew it was this one.
21233520	21243040	Do we assassinate him from above is my question? I don't know. I normally have three signals at
21243040	21248560	this point, which means I can do a raining down effect. Did he really say where did I go?
21249280	21258080	Great. Right, if I can ear assassinate him, this isn't a problem. If I can lock onto him,
21258080	21268960	I am very tall up to lock onto him though. No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him. Yeah? Uh-huh.
21269920	21281120	No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, that was so good. Oh, and none of the guards want to defend. That's
21281120	21289840	hilarious. All the guards are like, that, that man just came out of the sky. We are not, we are
21289920	21297920	retreating right now. Does your room have per ventilation? That's horrendous ventilation.
21300880	21307840	Unfortunately, I'm renting. So I have like absolutely no input or like anything I could
21307840	21320400	really do about it. Rip in pepperoni. He craves the drop. Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted
21320400	21328880	because my tea's gonna get too cold and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm. I am going to ignite
21328880	21340480	the, gonna light this place up and then we're gone. Oh, you're edging me and not the good kind.
21344160	21347280	Are the windows open? No, the window's freaking broken.
21350080	21354720	Like the landlord has been really nice to me and he's like left me alone. It's not like one of
21354720	21360560	them annoying landlords that are like trying to like trail through your place all the time. But
21361760	21368240	obviously whenever you visit somewhere to rent and you like inspect it, you don't actually know
21368240	21375120	what's wrong with the place until you move in and like they're obviously, I discovered like
21375120	21383680	windows are broken, the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is, is not like ideal.
21383680	21389520	Are you guys okay if I hide in this table whilst I drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.
21389520	21395360	Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice. I might just drink it real quick. I apologize.
21403680	21413280	Oh, that shit's so good. It's apple banana, lychee mango juice smoothing. So I'm getting all my
21413280	21419280	fruit in one drink because I don't really, I don't really eat fruit that often. I like
21419280	21423760	waste fruit, so I feel bad. Oh my god, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.
21432800	21436320	Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged an ace marco club with this morning.
21437040	21439040	They've just showed up in chat.
21444640	21452640	It's very likely. That'll be my first official club with a VTuber. I've got DEMP on the list.
21453360	21459840	I'm hunting down everyone with 3DS. I'm serious about that goal. I'm arranging them all. We'll
21459840	21465200	make it nice and easy. Gonna be doing my best. So hopefully you guys eat good and you can sleep
21465200	21474400	to my soothing Scottish accent. That's right, wee laddie. Time to go to sleep. Are you tingling,
21474400	21482480	tingle, tingle, tingle. Oh my god, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.
21482800	21491120	I should actually do like 4 Scots accent on an ace marco club. That would be hilarious.
21494000	21496240	I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.
21499600	21502080	What should I eat first? Should I eat an egg? I think so.
21504160	21506640	I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.
21507600	21516400	To say something was delicious in Scots, you say it was braw and that was braw. That drink was
21516400	21524720	delicious. You keep mocking your accent. Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent
21524720	21531520	hot. I would say like hot accents like unironically like French Italian or normally like rated quite
21531520	21537200	highly. I have taken a bite of a meat stick. I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.
21538240	21546640	I need to eat. I want you to read Go The F to sleep in your accent. That'd be good.
21546800	21552160	Is Valley Girl scrawny real?
21553120	21564400	Hi guys. I'm so totally excited to be here. Yeah, I'm Valley Girl. I laugh at everything.
21565920	21572400	Yeah, that's the best you can. Yeah, you like that? Is that what you want? I'm scared.
21572400	21582080	I want to perish. Valley Girl scrawny. Say in it, brav. Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?
21586000	21587520	No, I don't think so.
21590720	21598400	No, I don't think so. I didn't think so. No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do in
21598400	21608560	order to keep the accent, but make it different. Brain kind of. You're not hypnotizing us. Scottish
21608560	21615600	accents are hot. I'm eating the meat. I'm now baiting the egg. I'm just going to touch it.
21615600	21628720	I just said fucking delicious. I have earned, oh my god, a bite of the egg and the meat at the same
21628720	21640800	time. I have earned this, okay? I have earned this. As I almost choke on it, hey ho, there's a first
21640800	21648640	time for everything. It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British. I don't know what the equivalent
21648640	21656080	is in America or it's a twizy stick in Australia. Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest. I've
21656080	21668080	been at this for hours. He's sleeping in the hay. Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth...
21671040	21672800	Ah, that's cool.
21676800	21683600	Like my mouth is closed right now, but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.
21690000	21692080	A slim gym, probably.
21701520	21710080	Would you like some sweet chili pea snack that's been baked?
21726160	21728080	Okay, open up.
21731040	21740160	Mm-hmm. I hope you guys stretched, because if you haven't stretched, that's you sat for six hours
21740160	21746080	and you're supposed to stretch. If anyone's in a wheelchair, you're exempt from these instructions.
21746880	21751360	Mm-hmm.
21757200	21759360	I stretched and all my limbs dislocated.
21762400	21766080	You're not going to fall for that one stare? Well, you're going to split, aren't you?
21766400	21767520	Ah, the stare.
21769920	21772880	Oh, my God. I don't know if I can read that out.
21775440	21776960	When is booty inspection day?
21781280	21784320	A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.
21784480	21796720	I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked. Two meat sticks and two eggs,
21796720	21800080	and I've got one meat and egg left, and I'm just munching on the peas.
21805520	21810880	Oh, my God. So for years, I had no idea what Charlie horse meant.
21815200	21822560	It's just called the pulled muscle, and I was like, what on earth is a Charlie horse?
21823280	21828960	Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie? Why is it happening to people? That's not possible.
21829760	21834880	I was like, it's crazy. And then I finally figured it out because I watched like a meme,
21834880	21839600	and the guy like fell over, and he was like, oh, oh, Charlie horse.
21840400	21844320	And like, because of his body language, my brain was like, oh, my God,
21844320	21849360	he's having a muscle spasm. That's what it means. Like,
21851440	21856240	oh, I need a burp. I'm so sorry. I'm eating, so it means I burp a lot. I'm jammy, if you don't like it.
21861040	21867920	I don't think a zero or mercy burp. I think they have manners and weren't raised in a barn like me.
21869760	21878400	I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.
21881680	21884960	Ooh, money. We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.
21887280	21889840	Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.
21890880	21896560	Was that a meme on Family Guy? I don't know what it was. No, those ones are the different ones.
21896560	21900800	I learned from Mercy the other day that saying be there, be square is because you won't be around.
21902960	21908800	Wait, what? Be there or be square is because you won't be around.
21911760	21922560	Oh, that's so smart. Like around in a circle. Yeah. And like, you won't be around in the area
21922560	21929440	if you're not there because you're a square. Yeah. Oh, I just got that too. That's good. I like that.
21929440	21935200	Mercy smart. Shawnee, it's not manners. It's your cuttlebone. You're just into buoyancy. Yes,
21935200	21938480	this is my first time on land. Sometimes.
21938480	21950720	I'm careful. You don't want to make me too smart. I'll start coming up with new names.
21950720	21955200	Fond de la Bism. I'm never going to live down Fond de la Bism and be sucky.
21958480	21962880	What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony specific? Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.
21962880	21966640	Well, we do it at the end of stream because we're actually really close to finishing the game.
21966640	21969760	Like, we're really close to finishing the game.
21976720	21979760	Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.
21997120	22003920	I'm sorry, but I'm going to suck my fingers. I know some people don't like it
22003920	22019760	matter-wise, but I don't have a napkin. That remains me. I need to make the audio.
22019760	22024480	Okay. I inhaled the meat and the egg and then I finished my tea and then we're going to get
22024480	22040400	straight back and finish the stuff. I need like more charcuterie snack stuff for longer streams
22041280	22043120	because I don't have time to actually make food.
22043280	22054720	Maybe a cold pasta dish? I can pre-make.
22056640	22060640	The crunchy thing is the meat stick. It's got like a skin on it.
22064000	22064640	That's the meat.
22073280	22080320	I've got protein from the egg and protein from the meat and fats.
22081600	22084160	And the pea snacks are carbohydrates.
22092320	22094880	Yum yum yum. I'm going to get tons of hydration.
22097280	22102640	That's way too crunchy to be. It is meat. It is meat. I promise you it's meat.
22102640	22105040	It's like an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.
22110640	22115840	Okay, all the food is finished. I'm now for the tea.
22121200	22128400	Honestly, depending on how fast we go, we might actually finish the campaign in less than two
22129200	22132640	hours, but I'm quite happy to like fart about and do the Borgia Towers after.
22132640	22137920	Maybe like so we can like streamline tomorrow for doing the DNA sequence run.
22147680	22149440	I'm gonna let a big burp. I'm sorry.
22152560	22157200	That was good. Such good food. I really needed that and I hit the spot.
22159360	22164000	Mmm, a battered Mars four hand counts room. It's a honey tea.
22165840	22173600	Sorry, it all comes back up. I was going to record is tomorrow like your girlfriend for like
22173600	22177360	forgets to turn off the make. So it's just me munching and crunching because some people
22177360	22184000	like really enjoy like other people's like munching sounds. I'm like, if you are telling me that I can
22184080	22191680	order McDonald's and eat it on the mic and people would like be happy with that.
22191680	22193920	Like, uh, you don't got to tell me twice.
22196640	22199360	Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack that's easy to prepare, great.
22200400	22207360	I can't believe it. I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy and look after myself.
22208000	22220320	Oh, cruel. Honey tea. You boil those per beat. No, I love to be. I get to buy my honey from like,
22221840	22224880	I like smaller shop and I like supporting them on their own.
22226640	22233840	I sip my tea. Oh, yeah. That's roasting. It's still quite warm. Not gonna lie. I thought it was
22233840	22242720	gonna cool. Be a bit cooler. I'm okay. I'm okay though. Right, we're gonna go and get our
22242720	22254800	wanted taken off of us. Put that on the Herald. Thank you very much. You're about to stand in
22254800	22265920	some serious matter. Chicken nuggies ASMR. There's eating 100 chicken nuggets. Still a challenge.
22267520	22272560	I feel like you starve me and I could probably do that like in one go.
22276240	22281920	Have I bought this bank over here? I haven't. Investments, people. Investments.
22282000	22289840	That reminds me several years ago back when Tumblr was an important platform that some vegans
22289840	22298640	actually thought bees were physical harm for their honey. Oh, vegans just doing their thing.
22298640	22309680	They're nice, I guess. I just, yeah, vegans are vegans. I completely understand like the stands
22310000	22314960	no one actually wants any animals to be hurt or all that jazz. I just, you know,
22316240	22321840	I ask have you ever seen a healthy looking vegan when they're like I've been vegan for five years?
22322480	22329280	They look ill. I had a close family member that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years
22330000	22337440	and when they finally started to eat meat again, they were like healthy overnight. I'm so sorry.
22337440	22340880	I apologize if anyone is a vegan here but please seriously take your supplements,
22341600	22347360	look at what you need to in order to get what you need because please be careful. It's very
22347360	22353760	dangerous. I don't, I'm actually being serious for like for one millisecond. It is incredibly
22353760	22358880	dangerous to genuinely choose to be a vegan and a lot of people don't realize until it's too late
22359120	22370960	that like you are, like if you really want to get into it, like there's the caveman times before
22370960	22376560	we discovered what cooking, what cooked meat could do for us and like it's like, you know,
22376560	22382640	once humans had access to cooked meat, the brain power of humans like went up. I can't
22382640	22386640	remember what all like the details and what it's called and all that but like this is what I've
22386640	22390400	been taught and like I genuinely believe it. I'm sorry but if you've ever looked at a vegan,
22390400	22396080	they just look like a husk of a human and I'm so sorry if it's offensive but like it's just my
22396080	22399440	opinion but I never said I was smart and my opinions don't reflect the agency. I'm sorry,
22399440	22406400	love you, bye. I'll stop talking. I'll stop talking. Okay, this border district, you have
22406400	22413760	to scale it from the rooftops. It is impossible. You have to do it via arrow storm. If you do not
22413760	22420880	do it via arrow storm, you're just like hurting yourself like it's so bad and you can get a
22420880	22427920	flag on the way so so literally drop down arrow storm instantly and just like that done.
22429280	22434240	Easiest, literally you don't even annoy any other guards that are in the vicinity. There is no one
22434240	22442960	on the rooftops as long as you have arrow storm unlocked which is what the um which is what the
22442960	22447600	three recruits so you need six previous Borja towers destroyed in order to get that but once
22447600	22456240	you've got it then you are you're smooth sailing through the game. If only Leafs had protein. Yes,
22456240	22463600	I know deeper green coloured vegetaibals are like really really good in general um what way
22463600	22469280	am I to go? That looks too big for me to yeah I don't have a glove yet. Okay this looks like the
22469280	22480240	way I need to go. Did anyone get their what is it what's that organ that blows up that was used
22480240	22485760	for grass eating? Like it literally kills you. I'll always forget the name of it. An appendix?
22485760	22493360	Did anyone get their appendixes removed? Did you get wrecked with your appendix?
22493360	22502960	Okay tea time. Rice and beans. I can cover you for the most. Yeah.
22507280	22515680	Yours burst? Oh you must have been deathly ill. If it bursts it can result in death
22516480	22522160	because it's just straight poison to your organs. Holy crap someone said my tonsils
22522720	22534000	they stole your tonsils. Give them back. I thought appendixes were for built. I thought appendix was
22534000	22539680	for when we used to eat like grass grass like back in the old day. I'm taking a sip of tea I'm gonna
22539680	22548320	try and finish out my my apologies. I hear gallbladder I'm scared my mum had a gallbladder issue
22548320	22555040	and so did my gran genetically I am predispositioned. Like one day on stream I'm just gonna start like
22555040	22563520	screaming and being like gallbladder gallbladder but uh hopefully that doesn't actually happen
22563520	22565680	but I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.
22568800	22572720	You can die of death did I say that? Yeah you can die of death.
22573040	22584000	I don't wish that pain. Wait you know how you know how you guys are guys? Um have you guys
22584880	22591520	ever passed the kidney stone? For anyone who drinks an energy drink have you passed the kidney
22591520	22600080	stone yes or no? I'm very interested in that I wanna know. Never maybe? Did you ever really
22600080	22606160	sort of pee pee at one time? We are not 100% what it is used for. These range from filtration
22606160	22612240	to breaking down fiber to appendix to a mystery organ. That's so cool. Like how do we not know?
22612240	22619280	We've got so much history. No. I hope I don't yeah it sucks. Oh.
22623360	22628240	I've heard stories from women that are like I've had a kidney stone and I've had a baby I'd rather
22628240	22635120	you know do the baby again and I'm like I see that's biology in play. Did you know
22636080	22643120	the brain actually tells women that their birth of their... Wait where the heck am I going?
22644080	22648720	Can I climb up here without the glove? I don't think I can climb up here without the
22648800	22654400	glove. Playing? No? Okay I can. I can. Jesus. I was like oh I've just missed out.
22655520	22661760	I love stronticolors and I heard her kidney stone perils. Oh my god. I do have peril. I have a
22661760	22667840	peril in a very special location. Hmm are you doing mersey? Are you streaming later?
22668480	22675360	Are you streaming and one hour, two hour, three hour mersey stream? Question mark.
22678160	22679920	I'm finishing my tea please pardon me.
22687040	22688720	I need a burp it's like stuck in my throat.
22694480	22695680	I have finished my tea.
22698800	22702880	Requiem. Requiem is the debate. Okay.
22710160	22715440	Is Azura... Is Mama Azu streaming the day? Wait where the heck am I to go?
22717040	22720560	Sounds like I need to go up here. Oh that's because I do need to go up here.
22720640	22735680	Only energy drink I've had is Calcius. Calessus? What? C-E-L. Calcius. Oh I got there in the end.
22736640	22742000	I got there in the end. You just gotta let me cook on some words okay? Some words are like huh?
22742960	22750480	Huh? And then you just gotta phonetically spell them out. Everyone is streaming right now aren't
22750480	22757360	oh my god overlapping corp I can't believe it. I literally tell everyone like go watch everyone
22757360	22761200	else's stream because I'm literally just sitting doing like an endurance eight hour stream type
22761200	22767840	thing. I'm just having a blast. But don't worry when you go live in Mersey I always recommend to
22767840	22777040	the girls please to go... No I always recommend to the brief links to give you a chance and check
22777040	22783200	you out. See we work because odds are I'm still gonna be streaming by the time you... Oh I wasn't
22783200	22790960	supposed to be discovered. Oh well so we over... It's fine we're doing it to... Look at that. Look at
22790960	22799840	that combat cam. Is that Azura live right now with that link? Or is that Imi? Or is that just
22799840	22805360	everyone's link all together? Silence discord mode. Oh you're not discord mode at all. YouTube mode.
22805360	22809200	I'm just kidding thank you for moderating for free I really appreciate it. Actually all the girls
22809200	22815440	really do appreciate it because it's kind of like one of those like jobs you know like the
22815440	22820480	silent unrecognized work but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone who like applied to be
22820480	22825040	a mod and like thank you for everyone just being like cool at the mods and all that shiz.
22827040	22834000	Really appreciate that. But then again, silence mutual. With all that said and all due respect.
22836160	22842080	Oh I'm just getting spotted by everyone right Azura. We're just in a big fight. Oh no they have guns.
22844080	22849360	Calling the assassins. Calling the assassins. Okay I'm not dealing with them all you can kill them all.
22851440	22858480	I'm not dealing with them. Whoa they literally... Is he going to see me enter in the castle? I think
22858480	22864160	he might. I simply have all say you tell the girls to watch the girls. No I said it wrong.
22864160	22871680	I said it wrong. They do it for free. I mean literally Azura and Imi are Azura's online as well.
22871680	22879280	Oh if there are any Azura delay she is officially online as well if you're an Azura delay watcher.
22879280	22884240	I ordered a fresh batch of la cadore la last night. I'm just going to go and get you out of here.
22884240	22890880	But the pope has taken it all. Where is the pope? He meets with Cesare. Strange. He did not tell me Cesare
22890880	22900240	had returned. Imagine being a Mortarator. Imagine... Okay now what? Sorry I'm starting to lose that
22900240	22906160	little bit. I was like imagine being a Mortarator. Okay now what happens? Danny did anything else.
22906240	22909520	I'm imagining. With my mind only I'm imagining.
22912320	22914640	Okay I'm getting a bit delirious. I think it's like...
22916240	22920720	Bro I know I said this like yesterday. We were so delirious during that group collab.
22920720	22926640	But I'm so excited for our official like group game collab together. I hope you guys like the intro.
22926640	22934640	I'm gonna script it when we start up the streams. And literally everyone's gonna be streaming it.
22936560	22939120	So you can see all six POVs at once.
22942640	22949040	Oh I'm burping away. You've been at this for six hours? Honestly.
22953840	22960080	You come here so I can assassinate you. That's right come closer. I can sense thine penis.
22960640	22962800	Okay sorry I shouldn't have said that. I like that.
22965280	22970000	I ain't gonna actually do this. I'm starting to lose a little bit. But hey hope. Such a sleep.
22971600	22979440	Let's go. Oh I don't know why I said that. I'm remembering just like. Oh I'm notorious.
22980800	22989120	I didn't lure my notarite. Oh it sucks. I almost got caught. Well actually it doesn't matter if I
22989120	22996480	get caught by him. He doesn't come. How do you not see me? I'm literally on a bookcase.
22998960	23004480	Okay so. God he's so armored out the woods.
23006880	23011200	I have something on my mind. Like all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good
23011280	23016240	time on the marshmallows. Oh whoops I wasn't supposed to jump down here.
23023760	23027680	Oh I'm getting in trouble. I don't remember all these enemies being here. I'm gonna have
23027680	23034160	to remember like when I'm doing the like do not be detected. Like you put that away.
23034400	23038320	I literally did lead and I shot first get wrecked.
23040160	23044560	There's Tony big enough for the both of us. Cowboy. Oh I got 6000.
23046080	23051360	We're getting so near the end of the game. What has happened here? I do not know what you mean.
23051360	23057360	I want to take. I take. If I want you to die.
23075360	23076160	That's his dad.
23081840	23088240	What reason could I possibly have to kill him? Was he plotting against me with my brilliant
23088240	23095280	treacherous captain general? I do not have to stand for this. The assassins murdered him.
23095280	23102000	Why did you not stop them? As if I could. It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.
23102000	23109520	It was yours. It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.
23109520	23115440	My accomplishments. Despite the constant interference of failures like you.
23117360	23122320	You are not going anywhere. I have the peace. Out of my way old man.
23124000	23131840	Get out of my way old man. I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.
23131920	23134160	Chesere the intent to poison you.
23140880	23150880	You will not listen to reason. Father do you not see. I can kill all of this.
23151840	23165840	If I want to leave. I live. If I want to take. I take. And if I want you to die. You die.
23166880	23173840	I'm so good. It's so good. Where is the peace of Eden? Stop. I know where it is.
23174400	23180320	And you did not tell me he had taken it. Chesere. It's me. It's me. Your queen.
23182320	23189680	You are my sister. None more. Where is it? You never loved me. You never loved me.
23190640	23196640	Where is the apple? Tell me. Tell me.
23197440	23203680	Oh. Voice acting so good. Tell me. Tell me.
23207520	23214880	Oh. It's just so good. It's just so good. Thank you for letting me freaking share this game with you.
23214880	23222080	Fun fact. You actually don't need to like hurt any. Oh no. No. Go over it. Oh. It's it. Oh you're
23222080	23230800	giving me a heart attack. It's the oh. It's the oh. Little sister. I owe. I owe. I owe.
23232080	23237440	Fucking all of us have no heart. It's like. Do you see that? They're related. Yeah. It's based on
23237440	23247040	history. I could see. I know where that bastard is going. I know where that bastard is going.
23248000	23256000	San Pietro. The pavilion in the courtyard. The pavilion in the courtyard. Hmm.
23260320	23265680	Exit through the front gate. Wait. Am I still going to get attacked by guards? Oh. Oh. Wrong way.
23265680	23275040	Oopsies. You've just got such a big palace. I'll come back for you later. See you later.
23275200	23277040	I like this.
23279360	23280160	Asasino.
23284800	23291040	I will come for you. Later. Later. Come for you later.
23295280	23296400	I just like doing that.
23296400	23307280	I'll come back for you later. Later. I'll come back for you later. Yes, I will.
23307840	23313440	Who's a good refling? Have you been a good boy? Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?
23317520	23324480	Oopsies. Oopsies. Oopsies. Wait. He was in my way. Am I supposed to just ignore him? I think I am.
23324480	23331680	I will remember that for when we redo the mission. Spiral scape. Right. So that you can grab this box
23331680	23340160	because the timer don't start until now. You have to leg it for this entire next section. Okay.
23341440	23348560	You have to do it for the entire next day. Fucking let's go. Well, you're stuck in the cut scene.
23348640	23352640	Give it a second. Let it cook. Let it cook. Let's go.
23360320	23363040	Don't worry. Leave a faith. Leave a faith. Don't worry. Don't worry. Leave a faith.
23363040	23367360	Promise. Promise. Ta-da. See? It's right there. And then if you go in the street of the pavilion,
23367360	23372400	it's the easiest way to navigate to the place. Okay. And then you need to do the jump thing. Jump.
23372400	23377520	And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion and just jump every time you
23377520	23383280	see an agility at the bottom of your screen. You just jump and they can't get you. Jump. See?
23383920	23395760	The AI unclogs you. Jump. Jump. Jump. And then you'll be perfectly fine. Jump. Now you might
23395760	23401200	have to fight them at the end. I honestly don't understand what the development team actually
23401200	23407760	wanted from you at this point. Please leave me alone. But oh, he almost touched me. He touched
23407760	23414960	my ankle. Oh, he's touching me. He's touching me. Okay. And then they opened up. And then we just go
23414960	23420560	inside. And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay. It's okay.
23421520	23431200	Okay. So we were... That's a lot of bad guys. Okay. We got one.
23434560	23441920	Oh, I'm getting ganged on. I'm getting ganged up. I don't like it. Take this. And this. And this.
23442720	23451760	And this. And this. Okay. Unfortunately, we are in range because of that yellow on the map,
23451760	23460080	but we might be able to stand here. It should time out because they're not supposed to actually
23460080	23468560	see us. There we go. There we go. Now, did you guys remember the pineapple? Did you remember the
23468560	23475360	pineapple? We did a little eagle vision. The pineapple is glowing.
23482480	23488560	I was right there. What? I was there all along. Excuse me.
23498560	23502560	Hydration.
23505760	23508480	That... Those armor clinking sounds. Good sound effect.
23510000	23521760	Gods! Gods! Oh, Chesery. Your time can't last. Not while I come in with the apple. Okay. So,
23521760	23529280	basically, just run. Wait, hold on. Let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy. I need
23529280	23533680	to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in. So I need to keep
23533680	23547120	going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay, let's go. It is just a waste of time trying to stop and
23548080	23554400	get rid of all these enemies. There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water
23554400	23562560	and swim like your life depends on it. They keep... They're jumping me. Get off. Get off.
23563760	23571360	Away. Naughty. No. If you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water.
23571680	23576880	Oh, I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong.
23586000	23593920	When the moon hits your high like a big pizza pie, that's a mooring.
23593920	23611920	And that's how you get away from that sequence. Jump on that boat and get out of there. You
23611920	23618000	do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies. Jump in that boat and you
23618000	23624000	are safe. Over and thank you.
23636240	23638000	When the moon hits your eye, that's a straw knee.
23638720	23643040	My men were to throw the zithi, but we might be the naughty. We am one.
23645440	23650960	It's blinding. Oh, my model's not reactive to what happens on screen. I need to put that back on.
23650960	23653040	I love that. That was like the funniest thing.
23653200	23664080	And my eyes. We do have no variety. A sight to see us known.
23668880	23669520	Flashbang.
23672800	23676080	I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without heart and I know you just
23676080	23680960	pop a smoke bomb and get in a crowded bench. I wonder that may be the solution.
23683040	23693040	At once. I do not care how. We cannot on our own, you must help us. I am here. Idiot. Idiot.
23695840	23699440	And then you will see how quickly the asasini fall.
23699600	23717120	Oh, right. So the apple is a bit funny. Do you see that white one? That white line means imminent death.
23717920	23720000	The yellow means under my control.
23721680	23727840	And so we want to basically the apple will take your health. So I have to wait until it restores
23728640	23734000	and then wait. And then it kills the people who we want to kill. And then the others are either
23734000	23738480	under my control or will fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it, you get it.
23742240	23745280	We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming
23746880	23753520	rose. Yes. Under stress.
23754080	23760720	Any anyone else under stress? Anyone feeling about A.K. needing a bit of a
23762880	23764400	I'm not gonna say it's too easy. Too easy.
23769760	23774800	So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden. However,
23775760	23783200	Ezio is a good, good boy and his DNA communes with the apple. So his bloodline
23784000	23789040	kind of has been chosen. I'm pretty sure the guy's around this corner, actually,
23789040	23791280	and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is.
23795040	23801200	Fail at the cardinal. I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it. You do not have
23801280	23805040	our access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the
23805040	23810960	apple of Eden. I will say one thing. The more, oh no, actually, it doesn't affect with the more
23810960	23817120	armor you have. Also, on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden.
23817120	23818320	I won't even let you take it out.
23822800	23823440	Take anything.
23823680	23828320	So we just need to follow him into the Colosseum.
23830000	23838160	Fuck it. No, no, I'm not here. No, no, you didn't see me. No, you're actually a liar.
23839520	23846320	And I, oh, you guards just spawned in. Don't lie. You just spawned in right in front of me.
23847280	23848320	Is it safe?
23869520	23874720	My bikini affairs have been mentioned enough. I've unbinded everything,
23875360	23878800	so there's no chance of accident or bikini show. I apologize.
23882800	23885760	Borgia? Mind Control Apple?
23893360	23899440	Okay, again, same thing. Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits,
23900240	23904160	but it's not very good at all. I'm trying. Okay, this isn't working.
23904720	23909920	Wait, he attacked me and he died? Did you see that? Right, I'm just calling in my recruits.
23909920	23915840	They're not very strong, but we'll try. We'll try. I don't normally like doing it because
23915840	23921760	recruits can definitely die at this section because of the overwhelming amount of enemies
23923840	23929200	that come in. But again, white mark around who you would wish to eliminate right off the bat,
23929200	23935840	and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around. So he's coming straight for me,
23935840	23941200	so once I've healed up again, you just need to do the white. You can also see the white line
23941200	23946640	on their, the horse knocked him out of range, so we'll need to try that one again.
23947840	23955200	So they're now fighting each other actually. But again, white line, I got him. Yeah,
23955200	23959520	I see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health. I really do not enjoy calling them
23959520	23964800	in on this mission. It is dangerous. You can lose recruits here. If they're not leveled up enough,
23964800	23973280	I really did not spend much. Where's the apple? Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me. Okay, we've got
23973280	23979600	two more to go, two more to go. Let him get up, let him get up. We'll go for him first because you
23979600	23985280	actually, no, we won't because my assassin recruit just did that. Oh, someone's low, not good, not
23985280	23995840	good. This is why I really don't want anyone to perish. Did he survive? I didn't get a notification
23995840	24001520	saying that one passed away. I think we don't know. I know very much of an ASMR enjoyer, but
24001520	24008320	Amy changed your mind. That's fantastic. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they
24008320	24016640	can interest you into something new. Johnny, Miss Ma, how are you doing? Have you been good?
24021440	24028720	We played assassin's recruit up in this house. We're literally about to finish the game after an
24028720	24035120	amazing gaming session. You can ignore the guards here. The campaign should take over once you approach
24035120	24041920	these guards here. So very good. Another time here. Did you stream today? Or have you streamed yet?
24044400	24045520	Or are you taking break today?
24048080	24050640	At least ASMR was great at Dozed off. That's fun to have.
24050960	24062400	So now we get our cool Avengers moment where everyone's with us helping us.
24064240	24075840	You can actually successfully kill all everyone in the sequence. Oh, I can't use my blades. I'm so
24076160	24081760	used to using them. You're still playing? Absolutely. We're just about to finish the campaign. I'm so
24081760	24088720	excited. Oh no, that recruit is so low. Oh, I feel like I need to help him. Oh no. Okay, okay, good
24088720	24095200	catch, good catch. Oh no, that. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
24096240	24103760	I'm dead. I only have one HP. Oh, I needed to regen. No, I don't want any assassins to fall.
24104560	24108640	Stop attacking her. Stop. I don't have health to freaking use the apple.
24109280	24120240	Please gang up on him. Thank you. My goodness. Oh, no. Oh, please. Okay, yellow. Oh, someone's
24120240	24130960	going to pass away. I don't want anyone to pass away. Okay, so we've just finished that. Oh, no one
24130960	24138080	perished. Oh, wait, that was so lucky. So we've now finished the sequence and we're all waiting.
24139680	24141360	All five of us avenger style.
24141360	24149520	On your arm, Cezare Borgia, the Coletus troops must behind me. We will take back my city once and for
24149520	24158560	all. This is not your city anymore. By order of Pope Julius II, I arrested Cezare Borgia for the crimes
24158560	24169600	of murder, betrayal, and incest. No, no, no, no, this is not how it ends. James will not hold me.
24170160	24172720	I will not die by the hands of man.
24179520	24183680	Was the manner in which he said it. James will not hold me.
24184400	24193040	Didn't know that was a crime back then. Honestly, true question marks because all we hear about blood
24193040	24200480	lines is, uh, you know, about royals and that. So was it like royals are allowed to do it, but
24200480	24203760	the common people aren't allowed to do it, you know, as peasants?
24203760	24213840	I must go.
24218640	24219840	I need to leave. My people need me.
24219840	24225760	I built this brotherhood to last with or without me. What do you intend to do? Plant a seed.
24228960	24235120	This is goodbye. Then keep your money. I do not want it. We will see each other again. You have my
24235120	24245600	good luck. Take the money. Your meager salary. You will need it.
24246320	24258960	My patron has been arrested after all. You've got a lot for tuna. Oops.
24259200	24269280	There was a limit. Cousins and relatives seemed, okay, direct bloodline off.
24270960	24280800	Yeah. Oh, why is my tracking, is my, why is my tracking stopped? Hello?
24281040	24288160	Uh, uh, uh, is my PC dead or is it just my tracking has gave up?
24289520	24291040	Hey, you want to recalibrate real quick?
24296400	24307280	Uh, uh, uh, I need to play, but my thing is not working. Woo. Hello? No, it's not. I have my
24307280	24314000	iPhone on fire. Oh, my iPhone is burning. Uh, let me just pause that real quick. Oh,
24314720	24326000	did you see all of them? Uh, oh, okay, hold on. Uh, that, am I back up to sync? Okay. Uh,
24326720	24338560	just yeah. It's like in so fast there. Oh, oh, then a cannonball should appear. Yeah,
24338560	24345200	there you go. Cannonball and it got me as well. My iPhone's on fire.
24350160	24354720	Hidden blade only. Let's go. I'm a hidden blade. Some people enjoy the source. Some people
24354720	24362640	enjoy the heavy weaponry. Uh, a double assassin blade for me. I died there. I better not have died.
24364960	24370800	The phone's about to explode honestly. I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged,
24370800	24378480	like I've charged it, um, this entire time. Like it's got charger input, so.
24378480	24389600	Oh, the iPhone better get used to it. Uh, you better not be, uh, better raise the stamina levels for me.
24392720	24401040	Mm. The cinematic, uh, like when it does, like, the cinematic kill, it looks so nice on, like,
24401040	24406240	all the different weaponry. I have to admit. So, like, obviously not mad if someone prepares
24406240	24415920	something else. Not the whole. Oh, wait, no, I lied. I lied. I thought all the horsies got. No!
24419360	24424960	I completely forgot. I thought all the horsies got back up. Why would they do that at the end of the
24424960	24431920	game? Assume I'm allowed to be spotted. Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of the
24431920	24442000	ones where I shouldn't be spotted? No, I can be spotted. That's absolutely fine with me.
24442960	24449440	Ooh, but they're heavy. Heavy infantry. I'm trying to say they're heavy infantry. Right,
24449440	24453840	doesn't matter if I get spotted, so I'm just going to send it. Oh, I can't believe I forgot
24453840	24461040	about that horsey-warcy. I do apologize. I don't like when they do that. He's just taken an app.
24461120	24466160	He's just taken an app. I mean, I'd take one too. You know, he needs to sleep it off. He needs to sleep
24466160	24473120	off what happened. No, you've not seen me before, unless you know it's the only time.
24483600	24488800	The battery swelled up? Who are you doing? I left my Android phone on charge for a year and the
24488800	24496480	battery swelled, like, like, popped like a balloon-type swell? It's as dangerous.
24507440	24509120	Honestly, pretty brutal scene.
24509120	24516480	Huh. Leave me alone.
24522960	24527680	Unfortunately for this section, both factions will target you.
24531680	24537760	So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you.
24539760	24545120	Um, they will always sign, but you can't progress until they leave you alone. So
24545120	24551440	just, I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you. Okay, there you go. You just need to
24551440	24557440	wait for them to leave you alone. You need to water my battery. Make sure it's not too cool.
24561760	24568400	Yes, so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning siege tower. You're so smart. The
24568400	24576480	wooden flammable siege tower. I'm not sure about that one, Enzo. I like your accent. Thanks, Spondyn with it.
24579360	24582480	Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm.
24584560	24586560	Do we need to take the rooftops? I actually...
24587840	24594000	Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen. This section is the same,
24594000	24602800	where both factions will target you. You need to become anonymous. Can I hide behind this and
24604560	24607840	be left alone? Oh, is he gonna attack me?
24612480	24619120	Okay, okay. I was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like, why would they both
24619120	24625840	randomly target me? I have no fight with them? But I don't even know who they're. They're fighting
24625840	24631920	each other and they're the same. They have the same uniform on. They found the traitor.
24635520	24640160	I know what's wrong when I'm going to guess. Leave me alone.
24640480	24647360	Right, let's try again. This time, it's not on fire.
24649760	24652080	My world's on fire. How about yours?
24657520	24662800	The water's getting warm, so you might as well swim. I don't know the words. I can never remember
24663360	24672000	words. I can never remember words in order of actual songs. And then the best I can do is go,
24674880	24681280	the back streets. Hey, never go on. What you gonna say? What you gonna do? That's not the word.
24682240	24690000	Hey now, you're an assassin. Get your game on. Go play Caesar's gonna. His name's not Caesar.
24690000	24703200	Chasery's gonna die. Kicking in the balls. Oh, dear. Hey. That's right, baby.
24707840	24712720	So much to kill, so much to do, so much assassinating. On the spreadsheets,
24713680	24720800	never know when I'm gonna strike. Hey, don't know if it's good advice. Hey, so much to
24720800	24728400	pew, so much to do. Gotta disarm the guard. I can't do that, so that's fine. I'm taking out the double
24728400	24740480	knife. Trying to pistol whip. Try again with the tip. It's actually much easier just to shoot
24740560	24744240	Chasery. There, if you shoot him, you take a health bar.
24746720	24754240	And removing his armor. He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first.
24756880	24763920	You can't spam it. No, run at a time. He broke the armor. Oh, that's not good. Oh, that's not good.
24764640	24766720	Okay, I actually don't want that. I'm taking out my double blades.
24771280	24780880	Take this. Take that. And this. And take my knee to your boss. My knee to your boss.
24782000	24788240	Denny, wanna put my boss on your jaws. It's my knee. Oh, shit. Right. I'm actually
24788240	24792960	kind of messing this up. I may need to try hard. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get rid of these guards
24792960	24798320	first and then go for Chasery. But then, whoa, wait, wait, wait. You can't keep spawning new guards.
24800240	24807680	I mean, maybe you can, but like, you shouldn't. You should give me a chance to kill. Oh,
24807680	24812480	we're getting a bit crowded. We're getting a bit crowded in here. There aren't too many of yous.
24812480	24822640	This is starting to get a bit, he's gonna, can I do this? Okay, Chasery is, that's fine.
24822640	24829760	I expected that. Okay, Chasery's like one. Seriously, he's like one. Okay.
24831440	24834320	One more. Reload faster. Okay, there we go.
24838640	24840400	Actually, how much Nick armor do you have?
24840400	24844880	The throne was mine. Wanting something does not make it your right.
24844880	24850240	I love your mother, babe. That the true leader empowers the people he rules.
24850240	24852880	I will lead mankind into a new world.
24861120	24866160	No man can murder me. Then I leave you in the hands of fate.
24880240	24885200	The throne was mine.
24887520	24889520	What do you know? What do you know?
24892960	24896240	Get dunked on. I will lead mankind into a new world.
24897040	24898880	We take it literally in these parts.
24902640	24906800	You cannot kill me. No man can murder me.
24910640	24915840	The apple.
24921920	24927440	The vault. Oh my god, we're playing Borderlands 2. It's the vault.
24927680	24939760	So Ezio has put the apple of Eden away and the vault left behind by the gods.
24940640	24942240	So it's not in the hands of man.
24949440	24952160	We've got it. We're about to go to present day.
24952240	24957360	Gravity cleaves another victim. Full damage buff.
24971040	24971920	Perfect recall.
24977920	24980400	Oh my god. It's gold.
24981360	24985360	It's kind of why I'm saying it out now. I'll be quiet. I'm sorry.
24985360	24986240	I'm sorry. I'm getting too excited.
24992160	24999440	Like that European power grid. Ah yes, Italy. The only country in Europe you've got.
25000720	25002000	Problem is he's dead.
25002000	25004480	I can't believe we're stuck here.
25009360	25012160	A few cutscenes up ahead so I'll try and be quiet. I'm just getting so excited.
25012160	25015040	So I do apologize for talking over like so.
25016400	25018080	I'm just a bit of a silly belly.
25019360	25021120	Hey, maybe it has something to do with this.
25021120	25032720	A symbol matches the one on the door to the vault.
25034080	25039280	1419, 1420, 1421. What if they aren't dates?
25039280	25046160	1419, 1420. Oh my god. What?
25046880	25050320	God. Tell us already.
25050320	25056320	I am. I am. The tetragrammaton. The 72 names of God. You see?
25056320	25060640	They're all contained within three verses. Exodus 19 through 21.
25060640	25064800	And to get this your likeness, if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within
25064800	25071440	an equilateral triangle, their numerical values add up to the same number. 72.
25071440	25073200	Are you absolutely sure about this?
25073840	25076240	That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud, Rebecca. Yeah.
25076240	25078000	But I haven't lost the kicker yet.
25078720	25083680	Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72.
25084800	25087680	I think we have our password. Sean, go get the van.
25093840	25100400	We now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden.
25101280	25104400	I'm a Calibri again. Hold on.
25108800	25111760	Okay. I calibrated. No, my my friend.
25113600	25117200	You know everything. I really like this game.
25119680	25120720	That's right. I've seen your car.
25131120	25136320	Base the Assassin's Creed said women bad driver.
25142320	25147360	That's terrible. Dev team, you know exactly what you're doing for nothing.
25151600	25153840	There's a lot of dialogue up ahead, so try and be quiet.
25155920	25157680	Lucy, I'm making my way toward the entrance.
25158640	25159280	Okay, good.
25160240	25163440	Can you see any gladiators? My advice would be like it.
25165040	25166080	I'll keep that in mind.
25178640	25180720	I can't believe I'm actually going to hold the apple.
25181760	25184240	It's been a long time coming. You've earned it.
25185200	25189040	I wonder if it'll change things, whether it can tip the scales in our favor.
25189920	25193360	Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember.
25194960	25198240	I was going to say tip the scales. I don't know if they might pick that up, but it's a little bit.
25202000	25202960	What do you think we'll find?
25204000	25205440	Hopefully a map of a temple.
25206480	25210720	The apple's just going to give it to us. Is it? Yeah? Who's Elvis over there?
25211680	25213440	Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky.
25218880	25222240	On my first playthrough, I never found this for ages.
25223360	25224720	It's so slight and cheeky.
25228720	25231440	So much construction. This place is like a maze.
25232320	25237760	The hypergeum house, the cages of the gladiators, and the machines which raised them for the service.
25237840	25241280	The whole area you're in right now was originally covered by the arena.
25242640	25243280	Good to know.
25245840	25251280	So at the end of this, there's a quote from the gods.
25254480	25256160	And I said a message.
25257920	25258560	Oh wait, hold on.
25259760	25263040	My birthday! So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday.
25264000	25267600	Because it's October 10th in the present day!
25284320	25289920	Um, okay. If I don't move, the cutscene's not going to begin.
25290560	25294560	But I just want to say there's a quote from the god at the end of this.
25294560	25295840	And she says go forth.
25297360	25302560	And I may or may not have said be embraced by the six because of that quote.
25303280	25305200	And I hope you understand it when you hear it.
25307280	25308720	So be embraced by the six.
25309680	25311520	It's because it's all my love.
25314240	25315760	And the allure is the six.
25317520	25319040	Just wait for it, okay? Just wait for it.
25319040	25320080	I tell you, I tell you.
25320080	25321040	I show you, I show you.
25322400	25325040	But I hope the six have embraced you dearly.
25327040	25328320	Embrace those by the...
25328320	25330560	No! Set six! Number six!
25330560	25334160	Numero en dos tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.
25334720	25336240	I know it's kind of hard just...
25349280	25350880	...to keep his path forward.
25350880	25353440	I'd save the world we leave behind.
25354240	25354880	Who are you?
25359440	25359920	Jino.
25361040	25361440	Nothing.
25367760	25370000	We're getting close boys to the end.
25370000	25371440	I don't want it to end, but...
25374640	25377600	That's been a fan past the cleanest campaign.
25377600	25378560	Sorry, I went the wrong way.
25378560	25380400	Daphne, I know what we'd go through.
25384960	25387200	I'm getting really close to getting chills
25387200	25388640	because I know what's up ahead.
25398720	25401920	In the beginning, we set our truths to parchment.
25402640	25403280	To stone.
25404000	25405360	To the memory of men.
25406320	25408080	These proved impermanent things.
25408080	25409200	Oh, sorry, my mouth's open.
25409200	25414640	Lens by fire. Lens by famine. Lens by blood.
25415600	25418240	All the world is in this and all the more.
25418240	25420960	Innocent and ignorant.
25423840	25425840	Oh, cleansed by fire.
25426400	25427600	Cleansed by famine.
25429280	25431200	Such like, good dialogue.
25432160	25434800	Just to show that history cannot last on parchment.
25434800	25437120	Like, it's just such a genius.
25452640	25454880	Yeah, you think you found an entrance after the, like,
25454880	25457200	the freaking floor the pavilion opens up?
25457200	25458640	Okay, yeah, entrance, okay.
25465760	25466240	Mm-hmm.
25468400	25469360	Oh, I'm getting chills.
25481920	25482560	Let me in.
25484160	25484720	I'm coming.
25490320	25491440	But on what can it last?
25491440	25492160	Took you long enough.
25493520	25494160	What is this place?
25494400	25495840	What happens if it didn't have to last?
25497840	25500400	What if we just enjoyed every moment we could get?
25507840	25508720	I like the ceiling.
25509520	25510480	Dude, you like the ceiling?
25511280	25513520	You are a fascinating traveling companion.
25513840	25514320	Mm.
25524000	25526400	Look how detailed this is.
25529280	25532800	Like, 2010.
25535120	25537440	Like, look how accurate it is.
25537440	25539440	Please, can we do history games?
25540080	25542160	Where we can all just nerd about history
25542160	25543600	and, like, the things...
25543600	25546080	Like, they even bother to do the text and stuff,
25546080	25547360	like, under the paintings to be like,
25547360	25547920	this is from...
25549760	25551200	Like, ah!
25552880	25554560	Ah, it's such a good game!
25558960	25560560	Just appreciate everything.
25560560	25562160	It's so good, it's so good.
25562160	25563840	I'm so glad I get to share the game with you.
25564480	25566720	And hopefully you maybe play on your own sometime.
25568160	25569520	You have to experience all...
25572240	25573760	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
25578320	25579600	That guy is sassy.
25579600	25581360	Sean is a very sassy character.
25582720	25585120	A very British, uh, deadpan.
25588160	25588560	Wow.
25590480	25592000	Ready to speak to the gods?
25598480	25598800	Wow.
25602160	25605200	And now they are our final, vaulted hope.
25606240	25607520	You are they.
25612160	25613360	Hey, actually, I'm a he-him?
25614400	25614800	Sorry.
25614800	25615920	You have the best understanding.
25616560	25620480	But you broke our tools, or turned them against one another.
25621360	25622880	We have destroyed what we could.
25623440	25625280	Sealed away what we could not.
25629120	25629600	This is...
25630480	25631600	Destroyed what we could.
25631600	25632720	Sealed away if not.
25638720	25639220	What?
25640720	25641220	Oh shit.
25659680	25660400	The time...
25661520	25662560	Time he roads us.
25666000	25667040	We can distract him.
25667680	25669280	We can see past him.
25669280	25671200	He ain't left when he strikes right.
25671840	25673840	But his reach is so very long.
25674480	25676560	He's stamina unending.
25677440	25678880	We cannot evade his grasp.
25679440	25680240	Not forever.
25682400	25682880	Wow.
25683760	25684640	Here goes.
25684640	25687360	So she's telling us why the gods perished.
25687680	25691920	Because something constantly is getting them.
25693200	25694800	Just like Stony Stamina.
25696000	25697600	Yeah, I'm refling you like that.
25697600	25699120	My stamina's unending.
25700640	25702640	It's a shame you have a refractory period.
25708640	25713680	It must come in with the blood of me.
25718160	25730160	I'm... I'm shone in this one.
25733600	25735520	I'm holding onto the little knob in the middle.
25741120	25742080	Oh, we're doing it.
25743040	25745440	If you want to kill us, mate,
25745440	25747280	you're going to have to try a little harder than that.
25749360	25749840	Wow.
25750880	25751280	We're here.
25753120	25753840	Music.
25755520	25757760	And just the beautiful scenery.
25757760	25758560	The details.
25764800	25765600	Statues.
25766640	25767760	Sean's right, that is.
25767760	25768640	I'm always right.
25769520	25770640	About that dead end.
25771520	25772320	That never happened.
25772320	25772880	I was misquoted.
25772880	25775760	Music picks up and you can hear the voices.
25777360	25780960	Oh, just ethereal sounding voices.
25783040	25786000	Just in awe and just awe.
25787280	25788240	This not the door.
25788240	25788640	Is it?
25788640	25789440	Am I being pranked?
25789440	25790560	Why does this look like the door?
25792080	25792800	I'm being pranked.
25793840	25795440	There's really a secret behind that.
25795440	25796720	That kind of looks like there may be a secret,
25796720	25798080	but maybe it's just a reused asset.
25798640	25800480	But all the music.
25802800	25804240	You think it speaks English?
25804880	25805520	Just say it.
25806240	25806560	Okay.
25808480	25809200	72.
25811360	25811680	Wow.
25824640	25826240	After you, I think.
25828080	25828800	Music.
25832800	25834160	Now you guys have to see this.
25839360	25840160	There's ethereal.
25848240	25849680	The apple seems to be in the center.
25853600	25855200	Time to find out where those temples are.
25855600	25859200	Okay, no.
25859200	25860800	This is where the sad part comes in,
25860800	25862240	because I always mess up the sequence.
25864000	25864560	I'm really.
25872400	25873520	Always mess up the sequence.
25875600	25876080	The orb.
25885600	25888720	Big lady.
25891840	25892320	Knowledge.
25898480	25899360	Oh, no, wisdom.
25899360	25900000	No, knowledge.
25900000	25900240	Sorry.
25900240	25901120	Wisdom, wisdom.
25904320	25904800	Oh, no.
25907040	25907520	Close enough.
25907520	25908000	Fake gamer.
25915680	25918800	You hear the words, but you do not know.
25920560	25922400	I have played this game so many times.
25922400	25924240	I always end up failing the levers.
25924240	25927920	I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever.
25929600	25933200	I just literally, my brain said maybe one's highlighted
25933200	25934000	and the other isn't.
25935040	25936400	How many times have I played this game
25936400	25937440	and never done that before?
25938320	25940000	I always mess up on the levers.
25940000	25941760	It is hard to stay contained.
25941760	25942480	Right, I'll be quiet.
25942480	25945920	Knowing as we do, we wait for you, Desmond.
25946480	25947520	You will come here.
25948160	25949280	You will activate it.
25950160	25952640	You will not be late.
25954080	25955120	Did you hear any of that?
25960800	25964640	I sure do love all my friends equally.
25964640	25966560	I love Rebecca.
25966560	25968320	I love Sean.
25968320	25970480	And I love Lucy.
25970560	25973520	And I'm sure all will be fine.
25973520	25974320	Wait, where did I go?
25974320	25974820	Oh.
25974820	26000900	So where are the temples?
26001860	26002820	You want me to ask it?
26003700	26004900	Or think it or something.
26012660	26014420	You sure you asked it the right thing?
26015460	26016020	I know this.
26016020	26017060	I know that symbol.
26017060	26018660	That, that's a Phrygian camp.
26019220	26021140	It stands for freedom.
26021140	26022740	And that, that's a Masonic eye.
26023380	26025620	Now those two come together in only one place.
26026260	26026820	What's happening?
26028020	26029140	I can't move.
26029140	26031300	Your DNA communes with the apple.
26031860	26033220	You have activated it.
26034420	26034980	Let me go.
26035700	26038900	On the 72nd day before the moment of awakening,
26039700	26043860	you, birth from our loins and the loins of our enemies.
26043860	26047620	The end and the beginning, who we abhor and honor.
26048420	26050420	The final journey commences.
26051300	26054260	There is one who would accompany you through the gate.
26054260	26055860	She lies not within our sight.
26056740	26059060	The cross darkens the horizon.
26061620	26062100	Shhh.
26063940	26064340	What are you doing?
26065620	26067140	The path must be opened.
26068980	26071220	You cannot escape or part in this.
26071220	26072980	The scales shall be balanced.
26076260	26076980	Name the map.
26076980	26077700	Stop.
26077700	26078100	Please.
26079220	26081060	You know very little.
26081060	26082260	We must guide you.
26087060	26087700	Oh.
26087700	26089140	The Mason or struggle.
26091620	26095620	No.
26108660	26109460	It is done.
26110420	26112340	The way lies all before you.
26113140	26115540	Only she remains to be found.
26116420	26117700	Awaken the six.
26118660	26119620	Go.
26119620	26120100	Alone.
26121300	26131300	No.
26140180	26141380	Really don't like that.
26143940	26144980	Really don't like that.
26146180	26150020	For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers.
26151300	26154260	We were in Abstergo's headquarters.
26154980	26159460	And she broke us out because she was pretending to be a Templar.
26159460	26160900	She's actually an assassin.
26162100	26164660	And then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
26165460	26167780	Which is the sequel.
26169540	26174740	And she got identified as a double crossing agent twice over.
26175780	26176980	Which made no sense.
26177860	26179300	Because why would she break us out?
26179540	26186820	And if you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in Exio's story.
26186820	26187460	Oh yeah sorry.
26187460	26188740	In Desmond's storyline.
26188740	26189220	Shit.
26189220	26190340	He's gone into shock.
26190340	26191540	Put him back in the machine.
26191540	26192740	It's the only way to fix this.
26192740	26194180	But the Animus did this to me.
26194180	26195140	Am I the expert or not?
26196260	26196660	Do it.
26200740	26204660	The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because
26204740	26210420	she asked for like the revenue.
26212180	26214420	Not for like a payout for her voice.
26214420	26216660	But for the revenue split thing that they do.
26218340	26219780	I can never remember the word.
26220980	26223780	Like where you get like payouts constantly.
26224500	26225460	Like for your voice.
26226820	26228660	And royalties.
26228660	26230100	Yes royalties.
26230100	26233140	She knew she was onto something.
26233140	26234900	She was an Assassin's Creed 2.
26234900	26236180	Then she's in a second game.
26236180	26237380	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
26237940	26239700	And she said royalties.
26240260	26242980	And that end sequence was then created.
26243620	26247300	Because at no point do the gods speak of present day issues.
26247940	26250020	And if you listen to the gods words.
26250660	26252420	It was like you don't understand.
26252420	26253460	We need to teach you.
26254020	26257540	The gods should not interact with Desmond on that level.
26257540	26258260	Lore wise.
26258900	26262660	And because she wanted royalties killed her.
26262660	26263140	In plot.
26263140	26265300	And they said yeah well we don't need you anymore.
26266340	26267940	So thanks Ubisoft.
26267940	26270340	Absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline.
26272740	26275860	And yeah I hope your shareholders are happy.
26275860	26277300	Because you ruin it for the people.
26279140	26280260	But other than that.
26280980	26282980	Other than that really annoying fact.
26285300	26287220	Otherwise incredibly good game.
26288740	26289860	Incredibly good game.
26290820	26293860	I elect to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive.
26293860	26296740	And acting as an Assassin.
26296740	26297540	And all of that.
26297540	26298020	So yeah.
26308100	26310660	Oh and the VA for Rosa passed away.
26310660	26311540	I didn't know that.
26319860	26323860	But yes.
26323860	26326660	That is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
26326660	26330100	It's absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience.
26330900	26338180	If you ignore the very ending dialogue and occurrences.
26339380	26341540	But that was amazing game.
26341540	26343220	And I absolutely love Nerd and Abode.
26344100	26345860	I'm probably going to do the Borgia towers.
26345860	26347940	I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet.
26348900	26351540	So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now.
26351540	26353460	And their eyes are bulging out of their skull.
26353460	26356100	Because of how much they need to sleep right now.
26356100	26357540	I'm very sorry.
26357540	26359860	I'm really enjoying this game.
26359860	26361220	And yeah.
26362100	26363780	Are you still doing the second stream?
26363780	26364180	Yes.
26364180	26366980	So today I was to finish the campaign mode.
26366980	26369780	And tomorrow we're going to 100% this game.
26369780	26372980	Because I have never 100%ed this game before.
26372980	26374340	Always wanted to try.
26374340	26375300	Never did it.
26375300	26378900	I believe I may have 100%ed Assassin's Creed 2.
26378900	26379860	Achievement wise.
26381380	26384660	Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers.
26384660	26388020	But we can talk about that when we play it.
26388020	26389220	On June.
26389940	26390420	June.
26390420	26391780	On October 8th.
26397780	26398580	I'll keep going.
26398580	26400020	I've got a couple more hours in me.
26400020	26400420	Oh yeah.
26400420	26400740	Damn.
26400740	26401780	You got the stamina in it.
26406260	26406740	Hmmmm.
26407540	26408100	Yes.
26410260	26412180	All the feathers took so long.
26414580	26416100	Schedule set for October.
26416100	26418820	So my birthday is October 10th.
26419460	26421620	Which is when I will do my donathon.
26421620	26425780	And for my birthday I would like to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood all over again.
26426340	26428660	But I'm gonna play it utmost line.
26428660	26434420	So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2 campaign.
26434420	26441700	then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then Brotherhood on the 10th and the 11th
26441700	26451540	and then on the 12th and the 13th would be Revelations and we will complete its use storyline.
26452740	26457380	I'm not very well versed in Revelations, I have played it a couple of times but I'm not as well
26457460	26463700	versed so I probably can't Japanese about the best strategies for the game.
26466180	26472100	Are you doing the strong new passive and you present it? I don't know, I've been looking at
26472100	26478180	some ASMR challenges like the 8 hour ASMR stream challenge, maybe I might consider that although
26478180	26484500	my voice breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do.
26487460	26490260	You should watch Embers after Revelations.
26494500	26500340	I would make a reminder for those days. I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule
26500340	26508100	for this week um after the needy streamer overload I think it's like a two hour game
26508100	26516260	question mark um I actually need to go and buy the American candy um and those European
26516580	26522500	sweets because I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff uh because I'm
26522500	26533860	doing a hand cam stream. Um Strani, if mummy goat is our mum are you the granny? Don't look into
26533860	26540180	the lore too much of how velour came to be. Technically there are five children birthed from
26540180	26548260	my loins. Whispering's bad for your voice but yes I may or may not need a really big pee now that I
26548260	26555860	have just been aware of my bladder. I just sat on my foot uh like against well you know against what
26555860	26560900	and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation I'm like ah yes yes I believe I need to pee.
26561540	26572420	Oh mother mary virgin birth uh no sorry it was the reeflings doing oopsies.
26573700	26578820	That is the marabout going wild that's all I'm saying. I don't know how we got it we didn't get
26578820	26587460	kicked out of that convention. So I am taking drinkies of water which flows this track and
26587460	26595380	then puts my hypnosis on. But yes we'll take a very quick pee break. Um I might make a second
26595380	26601060	cup uh well be my third cup of tea but my second that I'll drink on stream with you. Uh I just need
26601060	26606580	water and drink I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me. I have been
26606580	26616100	satiated I thank you for letting me eat on stream. Stream elements is how we pitch child support.
26616100	26621540	Yeah I don't know what's going on. I unironically think you guys were given like so much money
26621540	26628180	collectively to the girls once the tip page was up that uh you guys broke the paypal uh
26629860	26635780	yeah. So thanks for giving us so much money that uh paypal is now investigating the account or
26635780	26641380	something I don't know. Uh but yeah if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch
26641380	26647300	they get 100% of the earnings. None of it goes to the other and all the girls will uh say that they
26647300	26653140	own the ubu market uh accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff we did not
26653140	26660660	touch it nothing to do with us. So yeah uh hopefully monetization on youtube stats
26660660	26667540	statistics uh update because my statistics were like yeah you have 80 watch hours and I'm like
26667540	26674180	are you sure about that? Are you sure youtube? Because I don't think so. All the merch is so
26674180	26679540	cute. I'm so excited for the keychain to arrive and I'll do tap tap tap play some more.
26686500	26695380	So dramatic. Unfortunately the credits go for a bit and they're unskippable but I do want to
26696020	26705060	special shout out to uh uh Alex Tremblay for the data manager. Shout out to Robert Mullen the
26705060	26712180	technical writer fantastic job. Thank you fire team lead uh Jocelyn Villix Nolan as if I can
26712180	26717380	say these names be real for real. This software contains adobe flash player software under
26717380	26722100	license from adobe systems incorporated corporation adobe adobe adobe adobe okay we get it.
26722420	26732820	Thank you Francis Page for your gear programming. Thank you Alexander Prich for your Oasis team.
26732820	26739540	Thank you Fabian Noel for your Oasis concert. Is it Oasis? Oasis? Is that team name? I must
26739540	26748580	be team name Oasis because I don't remember any Oasis in uh Roma. Thanks adobe. Don't worry
26749540	26753940	you'll reach the watchers someday. I literally already reached them and YouTube's like yeah
26753940	26759620	give me like seven to eight business days to update your stats because I can apply for
26759620	26766260	partnership uh monetization like right now. Well I should be able to but the stats don't say I have
26766260	26773780	the watch time but I do have the watch time so uh but hopefully we can get our monetization streams
26773860	26777940	and then you know all that. I have no idea how long this PayPal issue is gonna last but
26779780	26783300	you guys gave literally and ironically gave so much money that they can't burst.
26785700	26794980	I have like 10 watchers alone. I miss adobe flash player. Binding up Isaac started on it but I never
26794980	26798980	actually played it at that stage. I only played it like a couple moves back.
26811060	26817780	I like the enemies in this game as well. Have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like
26817780	26819780	uh
26823460	26832820	I like as well uh the plot line that love Volpe is so like I know it's you Nicolo I know it's you
26832820	26837140	and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time. I like stories like that
26837140	26844420	because it's like no no you're wrong please but thank goodness we did the no swim part that was
26844420	26850500	awful grabbed a poor man's horse ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like
26850500	26857540	dived across this like bean of rope. Would you consider playing Binding of Isaac on stream?
26857540	26865540	Oh boy you're in for a treat. In November the uh official multiplayer for a Binding of Isaac
26865540	26872580	goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys. Um we will be streaming that game often
26872580	26879700	I am uh addicted to it. I've not before anyone asks have you done Dead God? No I've not done Dead
26879700	26887940	God. I currently am at like uh I think it's like 1,000 of 1% and it's stop that's where I'm at on
26887940	26893540	one fail. I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files but uh it definitely is going to be a
26893540	26900020	consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer
26900020	26905620	game of that week and then like we'll pick a different multiplayer game type thing um would you
26905620	26918660	be fantastic? Ooh Binding of Isaac is hardly it is a randomized kind of dungeon crawler but there's
26918660	26925700	a lot of interesting story in the background of it um I really enjoy it I actually want to make a
26925700	26932980	review on this game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and as well as Binding of Isaac and Call of the
26932980	26939060	Lamb basically I want to make like real game reviews but only on games that I think are 10
26939060	26946180	out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bringing up like how flawless the uh in
26946180	26952180	rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just
26952180	26958420	really stood out like I just really like anything would be so nice to try it like um as much as we
26958420	26964340	all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely uh thank you
26966340	26972260	please keep yapping I enjoy it if you like the Binding of Isaac I highly recommend Noeta I have
26972260	26978980	never heard of Noeta uh is it like Pixley like Isaac as well
26981220	26987860	from how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews uh I've got it as a
26987860	26994980	donathon like reward it would take a lot of effort though like I definitely think after my
26994980	27000420	donathon is finished I'll probably have a few shorter games back to back and the reason for
27000420	27007620	that is because I'll be like working on rewards um I I literally want to like fire the rewards as
27007620	27017380	soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that um Noeta runs can go for hours oh Isaac
27017380	27024660	runs are like one hour sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30
27024740	27033380	minutes with Isaac um yeah start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn
27033380	27037860	your your hypnosis you will like this game that's so good you will like this game you will like this
27037860	27046900	game you will like this game have you considered collab of girls playing battle ground three
27047380	27054980	what's bg oh no what's bg battleground why do I think battleground
27056820	27060660	boulder wait the boulders gate is multiplayer I've never played it
27062180	27066180	what did I've never played it I didn't realize it was multiplayer
27067300	27076500	big bouldies gate right so we have just done it we are officially goodness gravy we have a lot
27076500	27082580	money on our persons this is a bit more money than uh I think you actually need it so it's
27082580	27088020	given capitalism it's so it's given capitalism so put it back and invest in properties and stuff
27088020	27093380	I am going to send the birds away sorry I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit
27094420	27098660	I'm going to do a peep I'm going to make a cup of tea so a three-minute break please

27106580	27118100	as well um and we are going to do the borja towers next and then maybe possibly um
27120660	27128260	maybe some other miscellaneous stuff that's too strong I'm trying to find something that both of
27128260	27134900	those last two recruits can go on I mean I've got a oh you're not strong enough so I'll send you
27134900	27140340	on a mission on your own and then for level two I will send you on a level one mission because I
27140340	27145540	really don't want anyone to perish he I know you could go up on boulders gate that's so cool
27146820	27152180	um yes I will definitely look into boulders gate collab I would need to research the game before
27152180	27158340	I play because I really don't know what it's all about um okay I am going to go pee pee because
27158340	27162660	my bladder feels like it's about to burst I will tell you if it's neon or not don't worry before
