00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,520
oh take this take this take this

285
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:25,600
i may actually come in a high position i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying

286
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,960
I'm trying. I'm trying. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

287
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Big jump.

288
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,080
I'm doing it. Oh my god, all of them just came in there. Did you see that? No!

289
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
You ruined it for me.

290
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,960
Oh, it's not the last lap. Hold on. Right. Sorry. Right. Bring the tension back. Bring the tension back.

291
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,760
But you did ruin it for me. I don't know who did that, but you actually ruined it for me.

292
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,140
Oh my god, you ruined my whole day. How dare you. Okay. Okay. Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring the tension.

293
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,720
Raise the tension. Raise the tension. Any tension. How you just literally took my little boost thing.

294
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,920
That could have been make or break. And what do you, how do I get repeat?

295
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Up my arse. Honestly.

296
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,240
Honestly. This is strong. What are you, oh my god.

297
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,800
Okay, this is why I need to copy the reflins because you guys have actually played this game before.

298
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,080
What? We're literally sidewall drifting. Can I get the, the, the, the, no!

299
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
You took my eye arm!

300
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Refling! Whoever did the lightning bolt, I'm actually sleep paralysis and I'm 12th place! No!

301
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,960
At Fanun Mama. Shame I can't join the race myself since I don't have Mario Kart.

302
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320
I didn't. But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track.

303
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,040
You've got this. Tear up the track? Are you kidding me? This is so bad.

304
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,560
Why did I pick this game for a street sniping purpose? This is so bad.

305
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Right, let's do ace, ace outpost. Thank you, K-Dawn. K-Dawn, I'm saying it wrong.

306
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,480
After you mommy, shame you can't join because of the Mario Kart.

307
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,760
Don't buy it is my advice. It's fucking shite. It's so hard to play. It's not shite. It's just I'm shite.

308
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,560
But I'm wholly content watching you tear up the track. Why are you hyping me up over lie?

309
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,480
Why are you telling fibbers? You know, for a factory fling, I'm not tear it. The only thing I'm tearing

310
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,280
is your freaking back door trying to get to that bros day. I'm sucking it. It's so bad like.

311
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,400
Brov. How the a- Like, I'm not being funny. How is this not just like Mario Kart from DS?

312
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,280
Why is this something else? What do you mean they have to keep evolving games in order to

313
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:06,720
make them worthy of freaking selling? Like, Brov. I'm losing it. I think she needs the auto-steering.

314
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,960
I do too. I'm not being funny, but I actually do. Like, I'm forgetting to steer.

315
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,840
Okay. Right. I'm going to try hard, even though I've never played this freaking track before and

316
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:29,280
I have no idea what's up ahead. Okay. Okay. Right. I've got a speedboot. Who's picked this map?

317
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,360
Oh my god. Someone just went off the map. Oh no. That's a bit dangerous for me. I'm going to be

318
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,680
honest. I didn't know I had to turn. I didn't know I had to turn. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

319
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,600
Have I gone somewhere? I shouldn't be. I mean, would they code it in? Okay. Okay. Okay. Him with

320
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:57,440
him with him. Hey. I'm trying hard. And I suck, even when I try hard. How is this possible? Be

321
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,360
honest. Have you guys all played this game? Is this like a super popular game? I know that sounds

322
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:12,720
so weird. Like, I'm sure it sounds weird to say it loud, but like, I just, I just, I fucking suck.

323
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,280
I suck so badly. Like, I don't, I don't remember ever sucking so badly in a game before.

324
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,640
Like normally like, oh, I get the hang of it. I comprehend what I'm supposed to do.

325
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
This is just annihilation.

326
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
Oh my god. That's funny. Sorry. That's actually funny.

327
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,080
You've cheered me up because you're letting me in your prostate. I love you here.

328
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,360
I might be the one getting annihilated, but no, it's time for you to bend over.

329
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
I'm literally not mad anymore because I'm getting prostate.

330
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:59,280
I suck. That is foul. Stop it. You shouldn't encourage me. Thank you, Kai, down to the super chat.

331
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,440
That is terrible. Right. Oh, I'm going to let all steer. I'm literally, how can you do that if I'm

332
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,360
spamming down the track? Sauce, but yous are cheating. Stop. I'm doing so well. And you keep

333
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,240
putting your banana on the track. How am I 12th place again? I was literally 8th place like a

334
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,880
moment ago. Oh my god. I don't even know if I'm going to make it. I need like a special, I literally

335
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:40,880
did not finish. I know that. Fucking all I'm getting is one freaking point. This isn't even possible.

336
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,560
When will you fricks learn? When you fricking fricks learn? Your ex is just complicated.

337
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:54,160
Skill issue. It literally is a skill issue. It needs to lock back in, bro. The only lock

338
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,120
I'm doing is putting one on your pee pee because I'm getting the disrespect I'm experiencing.

339
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm just picking maps at random. I thought you were a gamer. Oh, that comment always comes up.

340
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,240
You're first to be R worded. That comment always comes up. I know you try to wind me up and it's

341
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,640
working. That comment always comes up. Oh, you've played games before. So you're not MLG in every

342
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:27,280
single game you ever play. You're first. Do you hear me? You are first. Oh, I hate this. I hate it.

343
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,200
Right, let's go. Yoshi Valley. Oh, fuck you. I'm done.

344
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,160
Right. This is impossible. I need, literally, I need to steer assist on because I'm so bad.

345
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,280
And then everyone's gonna hate. Maybe I'll have, right, go. Now that's when I put on.

346
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,560
Bro, so I put on a saying too late and then I'm too late and then I put on a saying too early

347
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,000
and I'm saying too early. Why is everyone going this way? Wait, what kind of track is this?

348
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,600
You can go multiple ways. Okay, hold on. Sorry, but the developer's kind of cool.

349
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,600
That actually doesn't seem like that bad of an idea. Like it seems really fun and different.

350
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,640
I'm kind of here for it. Hold on. Right, go. Oh no, everything's bendy though. I don't have

351
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,600
like a straight. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Let me try hard. Like for

352
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,880
one map, let me try. Why is there a random egg in the middle of the map? Stop flamethrowering.

353
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,400
That's it. No fire v-tubers. Fire v-tubers banned for Gen 2. I'm not having it.

354
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,720
What do you mean? Emmy technically can control fire. Yes, but that's because of the book. Okay,

355
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,680
it's all about the book. Wait, Emmy, be nice to her. Okay, she tries her best.

356
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,520
Right, fuck it. I'm going the right side. So I was, I'm going the right side. All right.

357
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,280
Okay, OOM said go underneath. What? This is actually really creative. Sorry, but they

358
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,520
actually did really well. Yeah, that's right. That's what you get with your green freaking thing.

359
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,280
It's my way, ya bobag, honestly. Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

360
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:23,520
Oh my God. Oh my God. Right, sorry, I can't. I need OOM to just kick in. Please, OOM. I can't

361
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,080
believe I need a freaking child's game to OOM me in the right direction. Get out. No way,

362
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:39,600
that just happened. Yeah, like, oh my God. Stop. There's ink and I'm getting tipped over. I literally

363
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:49,120
can't even drive. Did you just do that for, I swear that was targeted. I swear that was targeted

364
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,600
and that rifling legit was like, like, oh, there's mummy, I'm going for it. I swear that was, am I

365
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:03,040
going crazy? That was targeted. What was the name? I'm actually coming to your house right now and

366
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,440
getting your address. I'm writing it down. That is outrageous behaviour. I stream every single day.

367
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,640
I have so much fun. I do all these free audios and this is what I freaking get. This is what I get.

368
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,080
I fart in the wind. No, out my way right now. Out my way right now. No. Hey, it's dropping bombs!

369
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:32,800
I was fourth place. Oh, I'm tenth again. Whoever dropped that bomb, fucking, your mom's a hoe.

370
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
So as she actually was like, she can't even close them. Oh my God, I'm ninth place. I'll take it,

371
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,040
right? That was a good attempt. I'm ninth place. I got eight points. I got nine, I got four points

372
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:49,600
for that. So now I'm still second place. Oh yeah. After all that hard working effort, I'm still

373
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:58,480
second place. Yippee. You whipped wrong type of ink on my bed. Thank you, Kaidon. Anonymous. How

374
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,640
cute. Even mummy can have AC levels of brightness. When she's being a sore loser, head pass for trying.

375
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:11,600
Fucking the thing's like, yeah, nice try. You are second place. Please, you suck. Take your frustrations

376
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,480
out on me. Oh, it's already happening. Didn't you think I was snow? Right, we'll need to refresh the lobby

377
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,200
and pray that we have some empathetic refunds that'll let me go ahead. You know you're out there.

378
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,600
Are you squidding me right now?

379
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,040
Lord of storms. Angry Scottish caught fish noises all the bit. Am I actually getting that angry?

380
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,120
I don't remember. I don't really recall. Maybe I just like black it. Right,

381
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,560
right. We need someone. Can I make a green toad?

382
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
Why can't I make you green? Go green right now.

383
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Why are you blue? Wait, you aren't as fast as the other one?

384
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,920
Watching you mold is the best thing ever. I'm actually, I don't know, that your next felt personal.

385
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,000
Oops, sorry. Sorry if I scared anyone. I promise I'm having a good time for the most part.

386
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,280
It's like, I'm enjoying myself. I get to play with you. Thank you, Jax and y'all, and thank

387
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,800
Anonymous says, I can't wait for all that Scottish rage to go off real, real, real. Right, Roy.

388
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,360
Right, Roy, surely you'll gain. Whoa, why are you so fast?

389
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,360
Oh my God, we're almost max speed. Wait, who's max speed combo? Someone must have it. Oh my gosh.

390
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,800
Right, ID. Kilo to

391
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:52,320
Foxtrot for November. The fats are fast. Oh, that's a little bit of a,

392
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,320
is that actually true? Is that the meta in the game that the bigger the person, the

393
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,360
bigger they are, like the faster they are? Are you sweating right now?

394
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,480
Gamer smack talk is when you know you're having fun. Just your mom's a whole. That's it. That's

395
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,200
all I've got going for me. Tydon, I'll offer up myself. If you win this race, I can't win anything.

396
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:27,920
I suck. Kilo to F alpha November. Oh, look at all my replays. Hi replays. One, two, three, four.

397
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,000
Is that Shaggy? That third one from the right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

398
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:42,880
nine, 10, 11. There's one more. And there's Hatsune Miku. Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku,

399
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,720
I'm thinking you. I'm coming in to take the 12th place. Are you going to switch?

400
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,280
Are you going to switch soon? You're actually, wait, is there 12? One, two, three, four, five,

401
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,200
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Okay, there's one person. I've seen what's coming.

402
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,440
Yeah, I've got the game. Oh my God. I didn't know you had the game. Right. Put in,

403
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:16,880
right. Sin sisters getting the last spot. Kilo to Foxtrot for November. I wonder now,

404
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,680
are we about to find out if Sin sisters as bad at this game as me or is she MLG pro? Hmm.

405
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,800
Heavier classes are faster than harder to move when rammed, but have slow acceleration.

406
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:44,480
Oh, I should go for acceleration and both shine. Oh, no. It's not going to go well for us. Is that

407
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,880
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Is she correct? We'll see. They are

408
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,800
going to fight for that 12th place. Stop. I think we may actually be this entire next map is me

409
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,800
going to be going, send, send, leave me alone, send, send, go the right, go away.

410
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,560
This is a members only thing. Yeah. Anyone can join, but since coming in, you're not sin.

411
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:18,560
What the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? That's not sin. Is that you and your, that can't

412
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:25,280
be your sin. That's not sin. There's no way. That's, is that your dad or something? What the

413
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:37,200
fuck? Is that your dad's me? Right. Well, wait for her to type, but if someone's, no, I'm no,

414
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:43,200
in your cheeky. Right. Is anyone, does anyone feel like sacrificing themselves so Sin can come

415
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,600
into this lobby? We flings and shows all we, but can I kindly request that?

416
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
Is anyone willing to sacrifice? There's, I need, I'll join next round. It's okay. Oh,

417
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,680
no, no, no, there, there, there, look, look, look, look, look. The reflins are popping off. Come on,

418
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,960
send, come on, come on, get in this fucking game. So at least I'm not last place. Surely you'll be

419
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:14,400
last place. If I was in there, thank you reflings. Right, let's see Sin come in. Do you look like

420
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
Is that you? Oh my God. Why are you so pretty? Is that you?

421
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,560
Sin's gonna whopper. Why is your freaking thing so pretty?

422
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:38,880
Okay. If that is you, she's greener. I'm not in. Oh, that's not you. All right. Okay, okay, okay.

423
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,160
Oh, wait, wait, is your freaking thing booted up yet?

424
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,920
I'm excited. Hold on. How'd that talk again? Let's wait for more players. What a shame.

425
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,920
I'm using tilt control. Oh, I'm already tilted. So you don't need to tell me.

426
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,520
I'll get you next time. Literally need to all the reflings unanimously.

427
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. Yeah, so Sin can get in. Sin's charging her switch.

428
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,400
I got asked because I only saw the end of the Ring Fit stream, but you're all good now. Yeah,

429
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:30,080
yeah, no, I passed out. And then that's how my body recovered. Next round, give Sin the code first.

430
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,120
What is going on?

431
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,680
And before you message me on, I'm in? Who are-

432
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,760
I'm in last? Wait, who are you?

433
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,040
One. That's you?

434
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,320
Are you the red? I don't know. I picked Bowser. Are you the freaking red guy in the suit?

435
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,880
On the right? Oh, did you just pick a random? Wait, press X and talk. Like, go like, goodnight.

436
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:15,120
That must be you. Sin for strong! Okay, that's so cute. Right, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

437
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,920
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. Okay, we're ready. We're ready. Right, we know who to beat.

438
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,840
We know who to go for. We know who to go for. Let's see if me and the thing is,

439
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,240
I'll tell you the story when we play Elden Ring together, but you wouldn't believe it. But me and

440
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Sin used to be very, very good gamers on a very specific game. Right, let's say the airport. Speaking

441
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,680
of modern warfare, Pop is on the airport terminal map.

442
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,280
Why am I Boris Johnson? I didn't even know I'm the one who switched. Honestly.

443
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,080
I don't know how VTubers play this game. This game is so hard for no reason.

444
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,400
Okay, who's getting the pick? Who's getting the pick?

445
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,560
Pinball map? It looks like pinball.

446
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,440
Monka. Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka, Monka.

447
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,000
Mumu Meadow is best map? Is that your opinion or is that fact right? Right, so my what? My acceleration

448
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,040
is do-do, but my speed is good? I think I've completely messed up this choice. Right, let's connect.

449
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,240
I got burned. What? No, you better not.

450
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,920
Wait, I thought you said my speed was, like, tall. Are you serious?

451
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,200
I thought you said my speed was good.

452
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:10,800
Bro, as if I'm not already debuffed enough. I thought you said my speed was good.

453
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:21,840
I am never picking a heavy again. Oh my god. I love yours, but I don't features any time,

454
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:30,320
but for driving in Mario Kart, this is terrible. Acceleration does not equal speed.

455
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:37,920
So then what with the fricking speed? Oh my god, there's random pinballs bumping in the map as well?

456
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,760
No, not now. Stop throwing your flamethrower at me. Go, baby. Right, okay, we're doing the AC

457
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,400
method. We're babying it the fuck up. Right, we're doing baby next round, and we're going to get

458
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,200
fricking, right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh my god, that's messing with my eyes, holy crap.

459
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,200
Yeah, I'm so big and clunky.

460
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:12,800
I mean, I'm not dead last, then again, send a disconnect. So I think there's only 11 people

461
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,400
in this map right now. Oh, this one's tricky.

462
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,040
I like how everyone makes a noise as well in game. Like,

463
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:39,200
like, I'm going to like all the way and do it saying all the way, all the way, all the way,

464
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,240
all the way, all the way. I love that all the way. So it's the best thing created in this game.

465
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:54,320
Oh, I love all these wee sounds. I wonder if I could do toad.

466
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,640
Oh my god, it's because I put flight mode on by accident. How do you,

467
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,800
how does one put on flight mode by accident? I don't even know how to access those panels.

468
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,040
Are you serious? I don't know how, oh my god, that slowed me down so much.

469
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,760
Oh my god, I've got like a little gear stick thing going on. Hi Wario.

470
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,960
That was on purpose. You had plenty of room for the both of us and you chose to do that, Wario.

471
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,000
Please don't think I'm not aware of. Right, fuck first place. Whoever, there's a blue shell coming

472
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,520
for whoever's in first place and it was Wario. Don't rub it in my face that you got the golden

473
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:52,000
freaking thing. Oh my gosh, Wario, you're so rude. Oh my god, this is so dangerous, this map.

474
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,720
As if you get that and I don't get that. Come on, who deserves it more, be honest.

475
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,720
Oh, that was rubbish. Somehow I held a button and it popped on. I'm going to great, right? Take

476
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,320
this as a warm up because you're all done, so Winston is in the lobby. Oh yeah.

477
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,400
Honestly. Wait, was that last place? Wait, did two reeflings just connect? I mean,

478
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,200
Sin obviously counts as a reefling. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Wait, let's do Sherbert land.

479
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:30,160
That looks quite easy. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

480
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,760
Yeah, you were like, wait, why do you have a golden crown on you? Wait, did you win two in a row

481
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,480
and now you've got a golden crown to flaunt it? No way. No way, the game is rubbing it in her

482
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,920
face. Oh, Cryoniku's most points. Okay, we all spit on him. Got it. I know what to do.

483
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,040
Okay, I picked, I already forgot what I picked. Oh, there's the Roman Coliseum.

484
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,400
What is this? This course has been, I don't know what it is. What it is.

485
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,160
There's a missing person. I wonder who is supposed to be then.

486
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:23,680
Okay, second race. I am never picking a heavy again. Excite, bake. Excite, bake. Excitobico desu.

487
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:32,800
That was terrible. Are we like rally racers? Oh, we can jump off in the air.

488
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,400
Okay, I like that.

489
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,280
Yeah. Whoa. Oh, there's mud on the track. Oh, we need to be careful not to touch the mud.

490
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,840
Don't want my tires to get all sticky now, do I?

491
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,040
Okay, well, I just took myself for that. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.

492
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:08,480
I'm eighth place. I'll take it. Oh, there's like, nah, you took my, wait. No. Oh my God.

493
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,240
Wait, how did you just drift over the mud? I'm sorry, but how did he just drift over the mud?

494
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,760
Is that for real? Like for real? For real? How did he do that? Did he cheat? Or am I going crazy?

495
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,840
Shake your controller when you do, when you jump to, sorry, I'm not even reading,

496
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,080
airplane. Shake your controller when you jump to do a trick and get a mini boost.

497
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,960
How did that refling go through the mud? But when I go through the mud,

498
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,520
it's like literally a bog. And it's, as if it's not like a two foot puzzle.

499
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,440
A two foot puzzle. What the fuck? A two foot puzzle.

500
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,200
When you go off a ramp, wait, shake my controller.

501
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:59,520
Oh, wait, how does it know I'm doing that? Oh my God, I'm starting on that. How does it know

502
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:07,840
I'm doing that? That's so cool. Oh, that's so cool. Oh my God, it knows when I shake.

503
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,680
Feel the noise. Okay, that didn't work. Oh my God, it knows when I'm shaking.

504
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,480
Shake and bake. Oh, oh, it didn't do it that time. That's okay. I forgive it. Shake, shake, shake,

505
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,840
shake, shake, shake, shake. Oh, I'm jerking off this controller right now. Oh, that's so fun.

506
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,960
Thank you for telling me. I didn't even know you could do that. Oh my God, I ignored the mud.

507
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,080
It is chaos. It is chaos back here. It's absolutely chaos.

508
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:54,000
Right, I got eighth or something. I don't know. Oh my God. Shake your controller or press Z.

509
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,360
There's no Z. There's no Z. Is it triggers? Be honest. There's a bumper in triggers. You'll have

510
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:08,720
to tell me in Xbox terms. Wish I was Johnny's controller right now. Improvement, eighth place.

511
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:16,320
All I had to do was start doing... Let's do tick tock clock because I have tick tock brain rot.

512
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,320
The triggers are ZR. Why on earth would they call them that?

513
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,880
I don't think I could have been hit by any more Ioms.

514
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,400
Honestly, me every time I go around the map, I'm getting ruled.

515
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:40,960
All you had to do was literally... Lutuber figures out how to win Mario Kart. All she has to do is like

516
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,960
fucking... I just spilled cola down myself if you heard me get a napkin. Sorry.

517
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,360
Give me coconut mole or give me death. I'll pick coconut mole. Where was it? What are my points?

518
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,400
Oh my God, I have seven and I'm still last.

519
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,880
This game is far too difficult. I said what I said.

520
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,280
Okay, third race. We've got one more and then in comes... I'll have... I don't even have freaking

521
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:20,240
discord open. Right. You guys will let us in and so I don't need to... Oh. Oh, how beautiful.

522
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:27,120
Oh my God, it reminds me of Christmas. Oh wait, can I do tricks in the air? No, I can't. Okay, sorry.

523
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,720
Sorry if you hear me like violently shaking in the background. It's because I'm trying to get it working.

524
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:41,040
Please stop bumping into me. Oh, he almost went off the road. I think he may have went off... Oh, it's spin.

525
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:51,520
Whoa, what? How am I not dead? Take that. See, if I use that against someone, it's funny,

526
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:58,160
but if someone uses it against me, I'm not laughing anymore. Okay, this is like really going for my

527
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:05,040
eyes. I have to admit this is a lot of color scheme going on. It's a chomp chomp not to be confused

528
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:14,320
with womp womp. Any chompers? Oh my God, I'm actually... Sorry, I'm actually not doing that bad. Hold on.

529
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,000
If I can get lucky and not have items used against me, that'd be grand.

530
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,680
I might actually have a decent position unless the reeflings are... Okay, they're plotting. I'm

531
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,880
back to sixth place. I'm getting put in my... Sorry, I'm getting put back in my spot again. Sorry,

532
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,600
I got a bit over... I got a bit overconfident. I thought maybe there was hope. Uh, I spoke far too

533
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:51,600
soon. I had hope. Okay, I had hope. Stop! That's what you get for being a doodoo haze. Oh no, I missed it.

534
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:59,600
Jump jump jump! It's starting on them. What does that even mean?

535
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:08,800
Who was I fourth and I'm ninth? Are you serious? Oh, I'm still dead luck. Oh, well at least I'm

536
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,560
locked on with another reefling. Get wrecked. Both of us suck. What are you gonna do about it?

537
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:20,400
Are you gonna kiss me? Team Slug is getting off target. Start, stop! She's kind of getting

538
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,720
the hang of it, not really. Is this where we find out mommy is more sensitive? Jumping,

539
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,120
not quite, but showing on your butt. Oh yeah. Right, one more map. I want to pick Hyrule because

540
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:41,040
we saved it the other week. Link, you came to town. You came to save the princess Zelda.

541
01:03:42,560 --> 01:04:10,480
I didn't 100% the game. No, about 100% at the figurines, which I've never done before. That was

542
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:21,840
actually pretty crazy. That was crazy. Okay, last lap. Ready. Oh, we got coconut. This doesn't

543
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:28,160
look like coconut mole. Is this like coconut mole version like 3.0 because of how many times

544
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,000
they've got it? You just got coconut mold. Wait, is that a thing? Is this a Mario meme I don't know

545
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:48,800
about? Stormy, I will become a chomp chomp. Wait. I'm not even mad that I suck. This is actually

546
01:04:48,800 --> 01:05:02,720
a really good song and map. Okay, I don't really want to go in the fountains. I don't think that's

547
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:10,960
going to speed me up at all. Oh my goodness. I just realized there's a mini map to the right

548
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,720
that I can see what's kind of up ahead. This is not like Nintendo DS coconut mole. I don't remember

549
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:27,600
any of this. Who is doing burnouts in the middle of the track? Who is doing burnouts in the middle

550
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:34,480
of the freaking track? That's outrageous. Get on my ticket right now. This is? Oh my god, I don't

551
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:59,520
remember it at all. I'm trying. I'm trying so hard right now. Is it going to peel? We'll find

552
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:06,000
out in a minute. We'll find out in a minute. Sorry, sorry replaying that was me. No, I'm sorry.

553
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:15,280
I said the S word. Yeah, I'll take that. I'll show you. No, I said I'm sorry. You're supposed to...

554
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Wait, he's got boomerang in his hand. Is that for me? Right, okay. I was getting worried that boomerang

555
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:28,400
was for me. I had to put on the brakes a little there. If you go to the fountain and jump, you can

556
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:34,400
do this trick again. Why is it putting me up the wrong one? There is the other thing.

557
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:41,440
What a few... Okay, trick. Again, I got another bullet. Oh my god, I have a chance to actually be

558
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,600
in a decent rank. Not the only time I have a chance to win is when I get given the bullet.

559
01:06:47,600 --> 01:07:00,480
Okay, please cars, please, please, please, please. My best score yet. A fifth place. Oh my god,

560
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:07,920
not the only time I literally have a chance to get any score is when I'm five. And that puts me

561
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:16,480
third place. My best ranking. My best ranking third place. Oh my god. Oh my god, record breaking

562
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:24,640
on Team Slag. I got third place. Last third last. Sorry, not third place. Third last. Third last.

563
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:31,280
I did it. And it probably would have been less if Sen was playing because she would have beaten me.

564
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:37,600
I'm not gonna lie. Not gonna lie. Sen would have beaten me. The only way that worked is because

565
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:44,000
I got given a bullet on ninth place. Right, I will reset the lobby and we'll make sure Sen gets in.

566
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:57,040
That was fun. You're ready. Yes. Right, let's do a baby. Oh my god. You know, she looks so determined.

567
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:05,520
I actually ain't seen. Fifth place. The deal is a deal. Time to offer myself up. Reflings. I'm going

568
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:13,920
on the head. No, wait, what? I thought I had to win. You had to win. Right, so what do I want?

569
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:21,760
Acceleration? Acceleration. And then we need a bit of speed or not, I guess.

570
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,760
Okay, max acceleration, but that takes in so much speed. I've got no idea. I'm just going for it.

571
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:41,040
Sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing. Look, I'm here for a good time. I don't know anything.

572
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,640
Don't be surprised if we don't stream Snape on this game again in the future. That's all I'm saying.

573
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:53,360
She's doing an acceleration build. Oh, that's the MLG. Okay, the lobby code is...

574
01:08:53,360 --> 01:09:04,480
I'm stretching, sorry. I need to stretch first before I can even think. Right,

575
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:15,760
a Jai, a T, a 4, a P, and a 2. I have no idea. No, you won fifth or third place.

576
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,760
No, you won fifth or third place, lol. I'm offering my body to you.

577
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:30,480
Reefling? I don't know how to tell you this. When I said I was third place, I meant I was third last,

578
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,720
which is an improvement on being second and last last. I'm so sorry.

579
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:45,040
Thank you, Kai no one for this purchase. When I said third place, I meant third last because

580
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:53,840
I don't have a chance. Are you strawdier? Are you in? Is she the one with the pink hair?

581
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:02,720
L plus ratio, let's go. Is that? I'll give it my best shot. Is that her? Go easy on me.

582
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Okay, we have room for two more

583
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:15,360
if that's Sen over there in the pink. I don't know if that's Sen or not. Go easy on me.

584
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,960
They're crying. It says I'm currently spectating. Check in my head, the lobby isn't full. Why would

585
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:31,920
you say that? I'm looking ass in the game. How dare you? Show yourself. Literally, the lobby's not

586
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:38,000
full. It says one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Wait, Sen, have you

587
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:49,760
bought like the online pass from Nintendo servers? Surely you have them. Yeah, they want you to buy

588
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,400
like, it's like Xbox Game Pass but for Switch. Do you have the online servers?

589
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,720
Yes, okay, you do have it unfortunately.

590
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,400
She was in the lobby last time. Oh yeah, you were. What a dumb ass.

591
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,560
Wait, it says there's a missing spot so I don't know how you're spectating.

592
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Yeah, there's room for one more.

593
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,200
Restart and hide the code with your body and then send it to Sen. Oh no, the refillings are

594
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,040
polite enough that they'll back out. I'm seeing twelve. Wait, can I not count? One, two, three,

595
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:32,320
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Where's the twelve? One, two, three, four, five,

596
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,880
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. No, you're trolling me. You're making me double think numbers

597
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:46,480
and stuff. Did she press flight mode again? We will never know. How are you spectating?

598
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:54,480
Now I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not Sen. Okay, now there's twelve.

599
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,560
Wait, so why are you spectating and not in the lobby?

600
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,400
That's bizarre. Why would it make you spectate? I'm not making you spectate.

601
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:13,840
If there's any reflings that have had a shot to play with me today, is it okay if I kindly request

602
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:24,400
you lead to try and get Sen in? Thank you, reflings. Oh, there she is. There she is. Boris Johnson.

603
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,200
Thanks for showing up, Boris. We missed you. We missed you, Boris. Then you come. Okay, I don't

604
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,560
know why that didn't work at first, but that's definitely her. There's Boris. Hooray. I'm using

605
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,400
tilt controls. Wait, are you guys like rubbing it in my face that I have to use evens? Wait,

606
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:46,480
why am I in but I can't see that I'm in? Wait, your switch doesn't even display it? I don't

607
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,920
want you to time out again. Are you guys like rubbish connection? It says I'm currently... Well,

608
01:12:51,920 --> 01:13:01,120
you're in my lobby. I'm not sure about that. I'm using tilt controls as a... Oh, we missed you, Boris.

609
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,800
Why is it so hard to try and team up with the freaking VTuber? I don't know why. Like,

610
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,560
anytime two people try and collide that are VTubers, the thing just doesn't work. I think it's

611
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:22,880
on your end, Sen. Yeah. Oh, no, this can't be. Can't a moment. Well, just go for it. VTuber scoff.

612
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,480
Literally, like, Minazur were like talking and voice chat for like two hours before the collab,

613
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,200
and then like 15 minutes before, everyone needs to clear the lobby and let me be far.

614
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:39,920
Do you want to try that? I need to... Right, okay, hold on. I'm going to reset the lobby.

615
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,520
If everyone could kindly let Sen come in first, okay?

616
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,320
I trust you guys to show the code, but you're not all going to come flying in, okay?

617
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:01,920
I have no idea what I selected. Right, the code, Sen. Would you kindly...

618
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:12,720
Sen, the code is 042 Charlie Gamma. Sen, getting special treatment.

619
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,680
Favouritism by my VTuber? More likely than you think.

620
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:24,240
Shocking behaviour. Shocking. Okay, let's see if she can come in.

621
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,520
Anyone else who comes in is getting nuked off the stratosphere.

622
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:41,840
Well, you didn't hesitate, did you? Right, can you see that, Sen? Because we can see you and

623
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:48,560
Big Boris Johnson. Ah, you guys didn't he? Oh, she talked. She talked in game.

624
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,520
She talked in game.

625
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,520
One, two, three, four. Ew, what is that?

626
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:05,040
You look like a... Oh, okay, five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

627
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,640
ten, eleven, twelve. Oh my god, we did it. We did it. It only took us like five whole minutes.

628
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:16,800
Smile. Why is my name Boris now? It was Sinfors Johnny and now I'm Boris?

629
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:27,040
Stop, that's funny. No themes, normal items. Sands from Undertale? How is that Sands from Undertale?

630
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,600
Who have we not played? We've not played Grumble Volcano, as far as I'm aware.

631
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:46,560
It was meant to be a part. We're doing it. We're playing together.

632
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:54,560
One race only. Wait, did I mess up? Was it not four races? I've been leaving it on default.

633
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:00,560
Did I mess up? It took us so long to come together and I'm going to ruin it.

634
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:09,120
Hi, thanks for joining. You're welcome to stream snipe. This course has been selected.

635
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,320
In chat, your character said four races. Damn straight it is. Okay, here we go.

636
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:23,920
Okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're ready, baby Rosalina. Come on, baby Rosalina. I

637
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:32,480
believe in you. Are you squidding me right now? Zion! It's a miracle I could still watch you at 720p

638
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:37,680
out here in the boonies. I believe in you, strongy. Are you putting your face in the wrong

639
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:44,080
streamer? You should put your stonks in as Sin. I'm not even kidding. Right, where is she? We need to

640
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:52,560
try and enable Sin. Either we'll enable Sin or we'll just go for it. Thank you for the tips,

641
01:16:52,640 --> 01:17:02,480
Zion. Okay, I don't know where she is. I can't see her. Is she behind me?

642
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,880
No, Sin are officially boosting me. Stop, could you imagine? Right, I'm going to keep the green on

643
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,840
me so if anyone touches me they get walloped. I said what I said. Right, we're going up the stairs.

644
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,720
I'm literally copying the reeflings. I'm keeping the green on me.

645
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:26,320
I'm getting inked on. I'm getting inked on. But it's not that time. I don't know. Give me like

646
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:33,920
less than a week. It's less than a week. Let's do this. As much as I like holding on to that.

647
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,440
I like the maps that change. Like they have changing elements. Like the trainers in the way

648
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:50,960
and stuff. I like that. Oops. Oh, the game all steered me away from that. You're so stinky,

649
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:57,520
Mr. Video Game. I don't know. I think Sin might be behind me. I have no idea what character she is.

650
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,040
Oopsie. Oh, well that worked.

651
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,120
Where is she? Is she ahead? Oh my god. And before she's like first place right now.

652
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:16,400
And she's like I've never played this game before. And she's just absolutely annihilating me.

653
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:29,280
Oh, there's a car. Oh no, I'm in the gravel. Get off the gravel. Off the gravel. Off the gravel.

654
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,600
We're almost there. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can destroy the subway car if you have

655
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:46,400
the dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee on. Come on. Come on. I can make it.

656
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:52,160
I can make it. No, I can't make it if you guys are doing maneuvers like that. Don't be so red.

657
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:59,600
Where is she? Oh god. Damn, she just won't be when I train on one. Literally, the person is so far

658
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:07,440
behind. Is she actually? So you're telling me the secret to winning against the Reeflands

659
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,760
is to call in my friends that I've never played Mario Kart. Billets should be banned.

660
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:18,960
You should be getting them. You should be getting the billets because you're last. The game should

661
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:26,400
have a higher rate of getting the billets. That's hilarious. Wait, are you on your desktop?

662
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:33,040
Can I get you in a Discord call? If you're at your desktop, I can literally open up Discord right

663
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,440
now and get your voice on stream. I don't know if you're on your desktop though or if you're just

664
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:44,880
chilling. How does that help you beat the Reeflings? Well, it'll make me higher up in general.

665
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Baby Park? Is that the worst map in the game? Baby Park?

666
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:17,040
Yeah, that's unfortunately how it is when you're left.

667
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,360
So you need to use the triggers to like tilt and then a boost you or something, but I don't really

668
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:32,640
understand it. So yeah, I just kind of ignore the whole mechanic. I'm sure the mechanic is

669
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,320
literally the reason why I'm losing, but oh no, I'm on the sand. Don't go on the sand.

670
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,160
Don't go on the sand. How is there sand and snow?

671
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:50,720
Oh, it's clouds. We're in the clouds. Oh, it's Jack and the Beanstalk. That's so cute.

672
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,000
Okay, I like this map. Wait, I like this map. It's very cute.

673
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:04,160
You go around a circle seven times? Not in this map. I only did it. I did everything like four

674
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:12,240
rounds of three, four rounds of three. That's not even a sentence. Do you want to try again?

675
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:21,040
There's four races in a circuit. Come on, oh wait. Honestly, I'm like, should I just

676
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:28,720
shove myself into walls? That may work. You know, I read his pen bananas on the track.

677
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:36,640
Literally, you know how like, there's always a music tag and they're like, oh, on the beat.

678
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:43,440
His pen bananas on the track is going to be my one. Okay. Oh no. I've just checked the HUD on the

679
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:51,920
right side. Sin person. She's like on her own all the way back there. I feel really bad.

680
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,120
Should I drive next to her? You know what? I'll wait up. I'll wait up. Oh,

681
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:05,360
she's got a bullet. She's got a bullet. She's coming. Okay, she's coming. There she goes.

682
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:12,960
Look at Sin. Right, let's spectate her gameplay. Let's, ow, let's spectate that gameplay.

683
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:19,120
Okay, she's cat. She's going around. She's picked up an item. Oh, she's picked up a bullet,

684
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,880
bro. If I can, you keep up. Not me last place because I was trying to freaking hang out with Sin.

685
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:30,240
Bro, she got a bullet. Why am I sideways? Okay, that's fine. I'll love it. Okay.

686
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,880
I got kicked. Why am I hacked by a random boy? Wait, how did you get kicked? You were literally

687
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:43,600
right in front of me. Wait, you were. I came in before you. Why? How do you get timed out?

688
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,880
Oh, Shrani got her hair putts and she can't hear us. Goose trying to go. 78% on town, mom.

689
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,240
I'm going to do Wailed Woods. This is where I'm going to live with the Weeflings.

690
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,960
How do you keep getting kicked? You have like other rubbish connection or something.

691
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:12,480
Shrani, love. We feel a love. I just caught that in the last tip.

692
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,240
Band items are for with these. Sin just can't win. You might be able to rejoin me.

693
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm not sure. Are you squiddin' me right now? Piney, spiny.

694
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:29,280
Tell Sin that so far she has earned more points as Boris in this Mario Kart Tournament

695
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,520
than he did in his last popularity poll. Bruh. I ain't seein' that. Bruh.

696
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,040
Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny. Bruh. Bruh. Two. No.

697
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:53,600
Oh, finally. I did it. Where the hell are we? We're in France! You know how you can tell?

698
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,920
Because that's that one monument. They want to shut down the traffic at it because it's so bad.

699
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,880
Oh, wait. Isn't the Olympics on? Or isn't the Olympics about to be on in France?

700
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,160
I don't know how to say it in any other language. V gets Lou Olympics.

701
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,640
Lou Olympics are awful.

702
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:32,640
Okay, everyone's getting bananas. To say a banana- Oh, who just bummed me? To say banana in French?

703
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:39,360
Or say unne-banane? That's right. Bananas are feminine in French. Why? I don't know.

704
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:45,360
No. Wait, are they? Did I just make that up? Be honest. I think I just made that up. In banana.

705
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:54,080
It just means one banana. A banana. New banana? La banana? What the heck am I supposed to do with

706
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:59,680
all these? I have no idea. That was so much for no- I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those.

707
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:07,200
They are feminine- Why would a banana be feminine in any language? Be honest right now. We all know

708
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:13,760
what a banana is. I'm not sure. It makes no sense. I literally make no sense.

709
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:24,160
And it's like, I'm pretty sure Bos and French are feminine as well, but a man's winky in French is-

710
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:32,320
Are you kidding me? You took my thing. You took my golden thing. You're so stinky.

711
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,200
I'm actually so stinky. Whoever did the thunderbolt? One, you aren't Zeus. You aren't him. And two,

712
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:46,400
you stink. I can smell you and how hard you're sweating to ruin my game. That's right.

713
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,720
You're not pheromone maxing. You're pheromone

714
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:59,680
bogan. Oh, that's right. Take that insult. Take that insult. Take it. What are you going to do? Yeah,

715
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,760
yeah, yeah. Where am I going? Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Oh, him just came in right now because

716
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:16,240
I did not do that. That was- Oh, it says unironically. Okay, I got it. Oh, this is what I need. So I don't

717
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,760
have to aim. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay, I made

718
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,400
it 8th. I literally cheated and made it to 8th place because of that.

719
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:36,240
Die Banane in German is female. Spanish is word un banana. She hates us all, girl. He can't recover

720
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:44,480
from that emotional damage. Yeah, please don't be surprised if I don't play this game on stream

721
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,880
tonight for no particular reason at all. It's because I'm a share of the game. Yeah, for no reason,

722
01:26:49,760 --> 01:27:00,240
I don't really think we're going to be- Royal Raceway, King Candy, D.K. Donkey Kong, D.K.

723
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:11,120
Donkey Kong is here. I'm finally back to kick something. The banana in Turkey is a must.

724
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:22,320
I don't know why she's breaking out, but that was fun that she joined in anyway.

725
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,920
She's probably got prepared for streamers. I don't know if she's streaming the day.

726
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,560
She does Elden Ring and she actually plays it properly if you want to watch her Elden Ring streams.

727
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:37,920
If you want to actually watch someone play Elden Ring,

728
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,960
send sister on Twitch at 8pm GMT. I actually don't know what time she's streaming.

729
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,240
I can't remember what time she's streaming that. It's a bit later. I think it's a bit later.

730
01:27:53,760 --> 01:28:00,400
Are you- Luigi, you just bumped me like three times. You know that cost money after the second

731
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:05,920
throw to the second bump. Oh my god, we're bouncing though.

732
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,640
Received it. No, no, don't start guessing my freaking name. That's naughty replaying.

733
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:24,240
That's naughty and you know it's naughty. Oh my god, I think I just sniked Rosalina. I'm so sorry.

734
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:34,560
I'm sorry. More like Pozalina, who's all she cares about. I'm just- I don't know what I'm even talking.

735
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:41,600
I saw that. Whoever's in that freaking red car, I literally saw you just try and green me.

736
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:49,040
What's your name? Mar? More like Shitebag McGee. Don't ever do that again. I literally saw you

737
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,640
attempt that in Four Cave. I was shocking. I was shocking, honestly. Streams every day.

738
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:05,120
You know, I'm actually speechless at that attempt on my life that you just made.

739
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:11,440
Oh, I can do a flip. No, I can't. I'm too late. I'm actually speaking- Oh! Who just pinged that

740
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,800
Oh my god, he went halfway across the map. Okay, last lap.

741
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:28,160
Okay, I can do it. I can do it. Yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta. I'm doing all the gambas,

742
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:32,400
but nothing's working out. Okay, nothing's working. I'm just here for a good time, not for a long time.

743
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Okay, please. Please understand. Okay, yeah, fuck you. I'm so sorry to that reflin. I'm so sorry.

744
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:46,560
No, I'm so sorry. It's not me. It's not me. It's the game. It's the game.

745
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,880
The game. Oh, I almost messed up so badly. I'm third place. I'm third place.

746
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:06,160
I'm sprouted. Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, I got 11 points. Oh my god. I'm still second place though. Oh.

747
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:26,640
Oh. Oh, I'm still second place though. Oh no. Oh no. I thought I did so well there.

748
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,760
I'm sorry. I got so excited. I thought I did it.

749
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:41,600
No, literally say, wait, was that last place? I'm not last though. I'm not last. That was fun.

750
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:50,160
Yatta, good game. Okay, we do one more. Maybe two more. We have time for two more. One more two more.

751
01:30:50,400 --> 01:31:01,680
Wow. You're not last though. Broke him third place for nothing. Stop. I'm trying. Right.

752
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:11,680
Why are we like male? Shirley peaches the Barbie to use. Wait, hold on. I need to do the plus thing.

753
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,840
Right. You want me to go all out on acceleration? Okay, the burger mobile is acceleration. The wheels

754
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:30,320
are acceleration. Why? Will on airs does any of this mean? Right. Let's just fucking go all out

755
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:38,560
on acceleration in the burger mobile. Okay. I swear. I don't know why your switch is missing.

756
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:47,440
Congrats on 15k, by the way. I have so much ASMR debt. I'm actually 15,000. That's insane. Hold on a

757
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:56,720
minute. I ain't laughing. Hold on a minute. Am I actually 15,000? What? I am. I'm 15,000. What the

758
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:10,080
heck? Reflins, where are you all coming from? What the heck? So one, that is some more video

759
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,000
kind of blew up. The real thigh cupping and the please let me hold it like blew up twice.

760
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:28,000
Yeah, I looked up and there was a fix. So let's find it. Congrats. Make it 20k before the bathroom.

761
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,280
Well, the 15k ASMR celebration stream is a thigh cam ASMR. Like you're literally going to see my thighs

762
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,800
and it's going to be pointed down on the ASMR making. We do thigh ASMR

763
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:50,640
and like you can see me like do the the making. So I don't know what to do for 20k in all honesty.

764
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,880
I ain't thought that far ahead. I've not even got my freaking ASMR collapse up and all that stuff.

765
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:07,600
I'm going to aim back. What? Why are you gifting me 50 memberships for sucking at this video game?

766
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:17,760
El Jeff. Thank you. What the heck? Thank you. El Jeff. That's amazing. Oh my gosh. That's so

767
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,520
what? Why are you giving me gifted memberships for sucking so badly at a game? That's huge.

768
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:29,040
Thank you. I think I've just unlocked a new emotes slot for that as well. What the heck?

769
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:34,880
Thank you. Congrats to those who caught it with your face and enjoy the emotes. We have more emotes

770
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,360
on the way and by more emotes on the way, I mean I need to ask you guys what more emotes you'd like

771
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:47,520
to be on the way. Thank you so much. For those of you who don't talk in like the actual chat,

772
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,000
I think there might be a prompt to say to accept gifted memberships. I'm not sure,

773
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,320
but you might see it now. I don't know how it works. But yes, anyone's welcome to join the lobby

774
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:06,160
because I think Sin can't get in at all. But thank you so much. El Jeff. More like El Chad.

775
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:16,800
Waps down 50 gifted memberships. Walks away doesn't say anything. Chad behavior. Shocking Chad behavior.

776
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,920
I'm a little nervous. I'm a little nervous. Gulp. I'm you. Hooray.

777
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,680
Isn't that a deal? How do I join in? There's a room ID code to the right of my head.

778
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:42,880
I'm pointing to it with my tongue. And then you use that code to join. As long as you have the game

779
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,760
and stuff though. If you don't have the game, unfortunately, I can't help you pass that.

780
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,040
El Jeff doesn't look at explosions. He just walks away like a badass.

781
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:08,000
Reefling Delilah. How many is that? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's us. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

782
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:19,920
8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Let's go. Oh wait. No. You guys are being forced to carry me. Do you understand

783
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:29,360
Reeflings are in this lobby? Okay. Wait, you got in? Okay. You're being forced to carry me.

784
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:38,080
You're being forced to carry me. Do you understand? This is online so I can't join.

785
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,680
Strowny moment. I literally do not know how to play. Well, you're still carrying me anyway.

786
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:50,560
I'm going to vote Sherbert Land. Oh wait. Melody Motorway? Oh my god. Melody. That hit

787
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:59,760
VTuber Melody. Project Melody. Strowny carry at the end. Team Strowny versus Team Sin. I got the

788
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,160
game. I just need to know how to hop in. There's like four of them. I should be like multiplayer

789
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:10,080
and then a code. Oh yes. Because I'm last. I'm kicked out of Team Slag. I see you. Wait. It didn't

790
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,840
let me pick. I just picked two teams. Am I going crazy? Don't forget to hit that like and subscribe

791
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:23,200
button. Oh, I'm such a real VTuber honestly. Do you enjoy playing games with me, Reeflings?

792
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,920
Don't forget to like the stream to let me know you want more stream sniping. I say that as if

793
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:34,000
we're not playing chess next week. Literally brush up on your chess. Okay. The red team versus the blue

794
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:43,040
team. Let's see what happens. Sauce to my team in advance, bro. Sauce to my team in advance.

795
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:50,240
That's right. Let's see. Go.

796
01:36:55,120 --> 01:37:05,840
Okay. Now this is curious. This is very curious indeed. Because now that it's teamed,

797
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:17,520
I am actually sorry. I'm going to try hard for this one. I don't want to let my team down.

798
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:26,160
I don't want to let my team down, mom. I have to try my hardest in Mario Kart. I really don't want

799
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:34,960
to upset anybody. I can't let them down. They try so hard for me. Literally every enemy ever.

800
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:44,000
No, mom. You can't forbid me from doing the tournament. I need to try everything in my power.

801
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:51,520
That sounds like every enemy protagonist. Please. I tried my best. Fuck it. I just destroyed a train.

802
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:03,200
No, I can't give in yet. I have to try my hardest. My team, they're relying on me.

803
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:12,320
Oh, I need to do everything in my power. Maybe stop with the bombs. Oh, but I can't let the bombs

804
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:21,360
stop me. Even if I'm not first place, I have to give it my all. Come on, team. Wish the best for me.

805
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:29,280
Oh, shit. The short cut for a minute. Sorry. I'm too busy. It is an enemy European right now.

806
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:40,160
Oh, no. I've been struck by lightning, but I can't let that get me down. Oh, my gosh.

807
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:48,640
I'm almost there. I'm trying so hard. But in the end, maybe it didn't even matter for my team.

808
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:54,640
I'm on the last lap. Oh, no. A bomb stopped me in my track.

809
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:02,880
Okay. Oh, wait. Just help me. I'm going to squid everywhere. Come on, me. Come on.

810
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,920
So is anyone to let them down on Ironically? I need to try hard right now.

811
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,320
Donkey Kong, you might have ruined this map for me, but that's not going to stop me.

812
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:22,080
Oh, my gosh. I'm blasting ahead of the enemies. I can do it. I'm almost there. Please. No. Please.

813
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:27,120
I'm actually trying hard and so much. Don't be rid. Don't be rid. I'm trying hard and so much.

814
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:37,600
I don't even know what color team I am. I'm about to come. I'm about to buzz. Okay. Hold on. I'm

815
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:44,080
just going to let all of you take over. I'm trying my best, please. Believe in me, team. I might not

816
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:49,600
be the first place, but I tried my best. Come on, buddy. Team mate. Come on, buddy.

817
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:57,360
Strony. Strony was a fanboy. Is that what you're saying? Your father, the villain,

818
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,720
and he sent all your enemies. Wait, what was the result? I didn't pay attention. Did we win?

819
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:10,080
I actually did worse than Strony and I'm on our team. No, you're supposed to carry me. Carry me.

820
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,360
And then we'll play this game again if you carry me.

821
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:21,840
Anyway, I'm in now. Hydration check.

822
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:32,320
Okay, I seem to have the inability to not be able to drink properly. I have spilled cola on me three

823
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,280
times a stream. I don't know what you're doing to me, reflings, but I'm getting nervous. I'm getting

824
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:42,480
shaky, okay? I've spilled cola three times on myself. I don't know what's going on.

825
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:49,120
Your comments made me laugh so hard I messed up. What are you talking about? I'm just a regular

826
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:56,960
anime protagonist. I just have to try my best for my team, even if I don't come first. As long as

827
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:05,680
I try my best, everything will work out in the end, right? Thanks, math, for the 20 gifted memberships.

828
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:13,120
Congrats to those who caught it with your face. That's right. Even if you're not the protagonist,

829
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:20,960
you can try your best to be the main person in your story. It's okay if you're an NPC.

830
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,800
I'm so sorry. This is so first. Okay, let me try hard. I don't want to let my teammates down. Hold

831
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:34,880
on. Unironically, I don't want to let them down. Even when I try my best, I'm such a baka. They're

832
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:40,640
going to know that I'm not good at this game. Maybe they'll figure out that I actually haven't

833
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:48,960
played it in a whole year, and the only experience I have with Mario Kart is actually in my childhood.

834
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:56,320
Oh no, I can't let them know. I'll just pretend I'll fake it until I make it.

835
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:06,880
This is absolutely tearing up my voice. Okay, okay, we cleared that banana off the tracks.

836
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:16,000
That's my DJ signature. Banana off the tracks. Bananas and pajamas. They're coming in the stairs.

837
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:23,360
Bananas. Oh, red. Right, I must be team blue. There's no way I'm not team blue.

838
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:30,800
Due to the data that I have collected, i.e. on the right side, bottom right of the screen is blue,

839
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:36,640
I assume that is me. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's focus up. God, this track is tiny.

840
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,600
Every is so tiny. Okay, hold on. I need you to kick in, please.

841
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,240
Right, get flamethrowered. There's nothing you can do about it.

842
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:56,800
Oh, did I do it? Did we win? Your team blue. Okay, where's the ASMR? I think you just

843
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,240
liked someone on your team. Oh, is that even possible? Thank you so much again,

844
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:04,320
Math for the gifted membership and LGF. That's insane. I'm pretty sure you guys have just

845
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:14,400
collectively unlocked an emoteslot. Oh no, we're losing. I just, oops, I think we're losing.

846
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:23,680
Ah, I'll do the electro dome. I don't know what. Oh, we're losing. Red is carrying.

847
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:29,760
Who hit me with the shell? We're on the same damn team. Press L on the card screen or something.

848
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:38,320
So close to the 96-69. Team Sen is pulling ahead. I can't believe it.

849
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,840
Reflames, you're supposed to like, I don't know, carry me.

850
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:51,600
And before you guys are like, you're uncariable. How do I pause? There's no pause.

851
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,080
You would have to do it mid-game, I think. I don't know, maybe you could do it like right now.

852
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:03,840
No one is allowed to say I'm uncariable. Okay, only my butt. You're allowed to insult my butt

853
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:08,640
and say my butt's uncariable. So sit on your face. As it, if you don't carry me, everyone's

854
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,640
getting a 30-second face sit. I don't care if you can't breathe, it's over for you.

855
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:20,640
Oh, we're playing the Legend of Zelda map. Okay, let's go. Hyrule. Third race. Two remaining.

856
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,560
Well, one remaining technically after this.

857
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:31,840
Uh, two, wow. It's always really that much of a negative. I feel like it helps me.

858
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:37,280
Oh my god, the coins are runes in this. Oh, I love it. Or rupees, sorry.

859
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:48,240
Oh, I love it. I'm like way behind again. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

860
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:58,560
Wow. Oh no, I never shook it in time. Oh my god, the soundtrack is Legend of Zelda as well.

861
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:07,520
This is so cute. I can hear it. I can hear it. Oh my god, that was a Hyruleian sword. Oh my god.

862
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,400
I love this one, sorry. Oh my god. References that I actually know for once when it comes to

863
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:18,080
Nintendo. Thank you, Minish Cap. We love you. We love you, Minish Cap.

864
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,560
Please owe him, so I don't have to freaking steer.

865
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:34,640
Thank you, Zarya. Anything for you, Refling. Anytime, it's a pleasure. I think my next ASMR

866
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,520
upload is me sitting on the make. I don't think I'm going to get in trouble for it,

867
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,560
because it's literally me just... Oh wait, no, I'm out of breath on it.

868
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,840
I don't think I can do it.

869
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,640
Oh, the wee baby's laughing. She's like,

870
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:52,400
honestly, I'd be laughing too. Okay. Wait, let me focus up. Let me focus up.

871
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,400
I'm just fucking throwing everything.

872
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:10,400
Oh my god, it's so long-inspired. I love Legend of Long.

873
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:19,680
Any Legend of Long fans? Sorry. I'm trying to make the best of the situation, but I'm so bad at the

874
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:25,440
game. As if you just streamstepped my box. I hope you're at least on my team.

875
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,200
Oh my god, someone's going to head with a freaking bullet.

876
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,280
But not to be confused with the hit band, Bullet for My Valentine,

877
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,040
which I can't even remember one single song from them.

878
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,280
Oh, that's like so fast.

879
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:51,840
Oh, I love... I'm sorry. Best map, sorry. I'm biased right now. I'm actually biased.

880
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:58,480
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm so tiny. There's nothing wrong with being tiny, okay.

881
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:06,960
SPH Bulls, rise up. Seriously. Wait, go, go, go. Okay, I got seventh place.

882
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:13,680
Is that what that means? Did I get seventh place? Oh, I did actually get seventh place.

883
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,800
Oh my god, that's actually not... Oh my god, I'm like legit seventh place. Hold on a minute.

884
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:24,480
Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Oh, can we bring it back though? Kiki9 is trying

885
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:30,640
as hard as to carry all of us. Sit on top, lad. Seventh place, you got one position higher.

886
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,400
I'll be so positioned high on you. I tried, I tried. I can't do it off the top of my head.

887
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:42,560
I tried so... No, no, stop showing me the DLC, honestly. Get away. Hold on. Let's pick.

888
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,680
Did we end up? Have we played the cheese? Let's do animal crossing.

889
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:56,960
Send best team, send red top on top. Thank you again, Zarian, for the tip. I will suffocate you.

890
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:09,760
Can blue make the comeback, unless all of us collectively like five head this?

891
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:17,040
I don't think so. There's only so much carrying the top blue person can do.

892
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,240
I'm always last, but Team Sin winnin'. Bravo, literally.

893
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,520
Like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

894
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:33,520
Send it on top of strongy. If anything, I'd be dominating Sin. Thank you, I'll be here all week.

895
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:41,040
Okay, final race. This is it. This is it. Let's make or break.

896
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:51,840
Let's go. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute, Luigi. We're on the same team now. You just can't

897
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,560
win. You just can't win, Luigi. Why am I drifting that way? Please don't do that again.

898
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,360
Wow.

899
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:10,880
Oh my god, that's actually so creative. That's so good. Thank you, Sleepy Phoenix.

900
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,240
That's so creative. I'm sorry, I'm bumping everyone. Call me Mario because I'm going to carry.

901
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:21,520
What? Call me Mario because I'm going to princess carry that peach. Hey, smooth with it.

902
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:28,240
I'm so slow. I can't believe there's unironically a Mario meta. This is insane.

903
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,160
This game's too difficult for brainless like me. Sometimes we just want to

904
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:41,120
be dumb. Is that too much to ask for? To be left alone in my dumbassery?

905
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,240
Oh, there's a ch- What?

906
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,560
What?

907
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:57,040
Literally, what were we supposed to do? A freaking train? Wait, that was my teammate. I'm sorry.

908
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:02,080
I didn't realize you had to be tactical with items. I thought they all did it. Like, oh, that's my teammate.

909
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:09,840
Oh my god, I'm 11th now. Oh, there was a train. I wasn't looking. This is why you shouldn't

910
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:15,040
drive whilst on your phone because you will not see what you have to do unironically.

911
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:22,320
Oh my gosh. Last lap. We're on like a whole different map.

912
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:35,040
Stop. You're being bully. Okay. Hold on. Oh no, no, no, no, no. You're not supposed to do that.

913
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:42,880
I'm 7th again. I mean, it's something. I'll take it. Can I get something that'll speed me up? No,

914
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:48,080
not really what I want to do. I'm just going to have to- Oh, I just walked into my own green

915
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,000
shell. No one saw that. That's embarrassing. I actually just went into my own green shell.

916
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,360
Bruh, I suck so bad at it. I'm 10.

917
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:07,040
I think sin won. I think sin won.

918
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we lost, but that's okay.

919
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:23,280
Yatta. Go Red Team. You did it. No way. We don't even get a participation trophy. You guys get like

920
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:29,600
a nice shiny trophy. And what did we get? Nothing. We don't even get a little medallion.

921
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:37,600
Like, oh, congrats. You did it. Bruh. So rude. Oh no, now we have to get sound. Exactly. This is

922
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:46,640
your punishment for not carrying me. That is shong. GG. Do you want one more or will we call it

923
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:52,800
there and redirect into someone? It's up to you guys. Do you want one more or 16 points?

924
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:59,280
Blue caught up from 30 points. That's huge though. You get a moist handshake and you will love it.

925
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,560
One more? One more? Okay, like, I'll restart the lobby just to give

926
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,280
other reflings a chance to streamstamp, okay? And then we'll do one more team game,

927
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:14,480
and then I might be able to win. I might be able to win if reflings carry me.

928
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:21,200
Don't be surprised if you slip on my banana. That is actually really good.

929
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,920
Does that have my soundboard up? No, I don't have my soundboard up. Dram.

930
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,240
Drat. I don't have my soundboard up. Okay, I just, I'll just pick we...

931
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:35,280
Eepee. Okay, we're called Daisy now. Daisy, Duke, Spiky. Wait, is that not Madame?

932
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:42,240
No, I've not played Daisy. Okay, sorry, sorry. I'm being dumb. Give me a second.

933
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,880
Right, what do I want to do? Speed. Maybe let's do a bit more speed.

934
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:51,680
Well, that wasn't exactly what I wanted to do, but hey, oh, well I did it anyway.

935
01:52:52,640 --> 01:53:03,680
One Sierra. Eight Sierra. Zero. I got kicked again from the final race, but your team's still one?

936
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:09,680
Bruv. Just say you're lucky, Sin. You weren't even participating in the last race and still win.

937
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:14,240
I dare you. These accusations are shopping.

938
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,480
Hey.

939
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:22,960
Ah, hold on.

940
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:36,320
Is Sin in? Are you one back in? The game just hates me. Do you want back in, Sin, or are you just back in?

941
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,040
That's right, I'm forcing you to watch my stream. What are you going to do about it, Sin?

942
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:48,800
Only if you streamed on YouTube, I could redirect into you. Oh my god, I let a reflin last one. Oh

943
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,400
my god, Sin is so selfless. Like, look how nice that she is. Right, one, two, three, four, five,

944
01:53:54,400 --> 01:54:01,520
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. We're all here. Right, carry me. Do you understand? Do you

945
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:09,200
understand me, reflings? Oh my, I realize I'm dumb. I'm too embarrassed to confess. Wait,

946
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,560
have you been disconnecting yourself manually? I'm not going to switch the teams. I'm just going

947
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:23,200
to leave them as is. So, I'll let the teams randomize. Sin, have you been doing something?

948
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,520
What have you been doing? Did we play the Animal Crossing? I don't think I did.

949
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:39,600
Yeah, last game. So, you guys better not let me lose.

950
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:48,800
Call everyone who is in my team. I am summoning you to possess yourself with the most gaming

951
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:54,240
spirit you could possibly have. Gaming kitsune. Strony, I need you to stop my face more than

952
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:59,920
I need to breathe. So, please, smother me. Repeat. I'm going to end up killing you guys by accident.

953
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:08,560
So, basically, so, basically, I realized I was in the full game. I looked back on my phone at the

954
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,320
screen and was further back in the stream. So, I thought we had another game, but it was just,

955
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:22,000
I wasn't watching you live. Was that English? Good luck. What? What are you talking about?

956
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:31,360
No. She was behind on stream. So, you thought it was, right. So, I was behind on stream. Right.

957
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:39,040
Okay. On the last race. Right. And what, and you ditched? Right. I'm on the red team now.

958
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:49,920
Okay. Oops. I'm on the sand, but that kind of works.

959
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:58,800
Okay. Come on, red team. Do it. I'll beat the blue ones up back here. Don't worry. I'll handle these

960
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:08,160
reeflings. They're all getting smothered one by one. It's so ugly. No, not sin being gone.

961
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,320
Now I'm last place all over again, bro.

962
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:18,960
Diabolical. Diabolical. What are these wheels as well?

963
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,360
Oh my god. I'm trying so hard. You have no idea.

964
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:39,840
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think you're a teammate. I just sandbagged myself.

965
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:47,440
Why is it when I do so good? I like completely mess it up. Whoa. You almost touched me, Luigi.

966
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:53,360
That felt personal. That felt personal. I'm not the one. That felt personal.

967
01:56:53,520 --> 01:57:00,720
Mm-hmm. I'm aware. I'm aware of what you've done. I like that noise.

968
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:09,600
Okay. Okay. I'm not last. I'm not last. I'm not letting my team down. Hold on.

969
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:17,680
Okay. I'm gonna, yeah, fuck you for one. You're next if you touch me. Do you understand?

970
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:26,400
Take, yes, if you understand how fucked you are. Shit. Right. No one touch me. No one touch me.

971
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:31,600
You're gonna regret it. Yeah, fuck you. You're done. Yeah, but you're done for.

972
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:37,600
That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is.

973
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:44,080
Tell them how it is. Tell them how it is. Yep. Yep. Tell them how it is. Wait, how did you?

974
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:51,120
Okay. I actually am not letting my team down. I'm actually not letting my team down.

975
01:57:53,680 --> 01:58:00,240
Nine points? I'll take it. Right. I was in the fourth on the last race, so excuse me. Get on my

976
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:07,600
level. Oh, right. Okay. So the game didn't have a fit. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, my God. They need to start

977
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:12,480
giving me bullets right before the finish in line, like, all the time, because it's actually

978
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:18,800
meaning I'm not last. What have we not played? Have we played Wario's Stadium?

979
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:26,560
Well, we'll find out in a minute. Fourth place? That's crazy. Stroni has learned how to cart

980
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:33,520
the Mario in one stream. Any Mario of carters? Any cart to Mario's? Right. She literally did

981
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:40,800
just get on my level. Why, everyone keep bumping into, who driving these carts? Honestly.

982
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:42,640
Shocking behavior.

983
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:55,360
Question for those that say mommy is carried by the bullet and not our team. How heavy is

984
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:01,280
mommy's cheek? I have no idea. I've not weighed myself in months. I have no idea what my weight is.

985
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:07,680
Want to find out? Want to find out, huh? You want to find out in person, Franklin?

986
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:15,920
Don't think I won't do it. When other streamers shyly, I push further and further

987
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:21,760
to the inappropriate level. Oh, no, I messed up the start, right? Bruh, I'm too busy,

988
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:28,320
six and to fucking focus on the game. Hold on. Okay, okay, focus up, focus up. Come on.

989
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,840
I would do the, I would do the anime voice again, but I'm not gonna lie. That really hurt my throat.

990
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:37,680
Not the mud, not the mud, but someone please think of the mud.

991
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:48,320
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. The ring of fire and it.

992
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:59,760
Keep going, teammates. I believe in you. Go on without me. I'll be fine.

993
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:06,080
I am messing up so badly. Don't tell the red team. I am absolutely

994
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:13,120
just decimating any semblance of success for them. Don't tell them though. They don't need to know.

995
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,680
They don't need to know, okay? They don't need to know. It's fine. They don't need to know.

996
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:24,560
Oh my god, right, okay. I'm safe for a little bit in case anyone wants to use anything against me.

997
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,520
Oh my god, we did a flip though. Oh, we did a flip though.

998
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:37,360
Okay, I'm still a living place, so it's not looking that good. I'm gonna be honest.

999
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:44,800
It could look better. It could look a lot better right now. Okay, let's not, okay.

1000
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,840
Oh, look, I was fourth place last time. It's fine. I was fourth place last time.

1001
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:56,240
It truly is fine. Hold on. Let me grab these and then Priya get a bullet.

1002
02:00:56,240 --> 02:01:00,640
Give me two bullets in a row if you love me. Thank you. Thank you. The game loves me.

1003
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,200
I love you too, game. Right, ruin. I'm literally coming for you. I am literally going in front

1004
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:13,760
of your ruin. You are literally my opposition. What is this? I don't want to attack my teammates.

1005
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,080
Oh, fuck it.

1006
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,720
Well, it worked. I'm ninth place now. Look, it was tactical sabotage. It was tactical sabotage,

1007
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:35,440
okay? It was tactical. It was tactical. There was a point. Speaking of sabotage,

1008
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:40,000
by the Beastie Boys. No way he got in front of me.

1009
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:47,040
No, I messed that up so badly. I think I could have done a lot better.

1010
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:54,560
Come on. Oh, my God, it sounded like one of those chickens that you're squeaking and out.

1011
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:02,320
You know those chickens that dogs play with? Those like plastic things? Do you know what I mean?

1012
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:14,880
Are we winning? Oh, we're winning. The rubber chickens. Yeah, literally. Should I do rubber

1013
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:24,800
chicken ASMR? I don't know. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. I went strolling

1014
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:33,840
to make the noises too. It's so accurate. You're going to lift me. Have we done sweet canyon? You

1015
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:38,880
don't need the rubber chicken. You are the rubber chicken. Girlfriend, rubber chicken ASMR should

1016
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:54,960
sleep. I've just discovered I can kind of make that noise. Oh, my God. Hydration check.

1017
02:02:55,680 --> 02:03:04,160
We're doing it. This is how she distracts the other team. Yes, close your ears, my teammates.

1018
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:09,680
I'm going to distract them. Are you going to be a good boy for me? Are you going to let me go

1019
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:18,960
in front? Don't you not want to see the view from behind, little wreathling? Don't you want to see

1020
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:29,280
it all? If you're in front of me, how can you see me? Come on, wreathling, for me. Just for me.

1021
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:43,520
Let mommy be first. Did I work? Did I work? Come on, red team. Filter in, please. Oh,

1022
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:59,920
no, I messed up. What is this map? There's a lot of bumping. I see a lot of bumping. Not going

1023
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:07,520
to lie. I'm getting bumped to smithereens right now. Maybe that should be my tactic all along.

1024
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:14,480
Maybe I should just do that. Oh, this is so cool. I like this map. Are we going back in the war?

1025
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:27,600
Are we going out of the war? I'm sideways. What's a piranha do? Wait, what? I've never had a piranha

1026
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:43,840
before. How strange. How strange. That was an interesting item, a piranha. They must be super

1027
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:56,240
rare. Okay, okay. Back to being 12th place. Hold on. I need the bullet, please. Give me a bullet for

1028
02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:07,680
my Valentine's at the Mario Kart battle pass. I just shit on my ass and I bootied up my PC

1029
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:17,520
because I need mood to get that Fortnite battle pass. Again, I messed. What am I doing so wrong?

1030
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:25,920
I tried so hard, but in the end, it probably isn't going to matter, but I'm trying. I'm 9th

1031
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:31,280
place. I'll take it. I'm 9th place. This is the best I've done and however long. Right, okay,

1032
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:39,760
it's fine. I just don't want to be last. Oh my god, there's a bullet. Stop it. You're such

1033
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:45,760
bullies, reflinges. You're supposed to let me win. What do you mean my voice isn't safe? Say what

1034
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:53,520
I'm fucking angry. Reflings, let me win. Fuck take. Let me win. Let me win. Let me win. Sorry,

1035
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:58,080
but let me win. It's actually, it's literally by a ball here. Right, I'm passing. I passed the blue,

1036
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:04,400
so I'm winning. Stop putting bananas on the track. The bananas go in marshmallow. I'm not on the track.

1037
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:11,120
Oh my god. I actually want to win so badly. No, I don't want to hurt my teammate.

1038
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:20,320
I'm literally 12th place. Bro, I'm literally an anchor. I'm literally an anchor. I'm getting

1039
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:28,240
did not finish. I'm that. Oh, I'm an anchor. Are we winning? Oh my god, I'm such an anchor.

1040
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:36,800
What is it? Oh my god, we're still somehow doing it. I don't know, but we're still somehow doing it.

1041
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:43,840
Oh my god, clutched three. I did not clutch. I was third and got hit by a hundred items,

1042
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:49,760
so now I'm 7th. You literally kept me from starting that right. Oh my god, I'm getting annihilated.

1043
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:56,800
I've been Mario circuit. Oh, shaggle falls. That's cute.

1044
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:03,200
The red carry is crazy. Literally the only way I'm going to win this game

1045
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:08,720
is by one, sorting into teams, and then two, getting carried by those team members.

1046
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:14,240
A fun idea. Make it a challenge. Whoever are the third, three people that finish behind

1047
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:19,920
Strony are considered first, second, and third. No, it's not going to work like that. There's no way.

1048
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:31,440
KK9's back must be hurting a lot by now. We are winning, at least I'm faster than a fish woman.

1049
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:36,400
How dare you? I'm literally so good at swimming. I'm not being funny. You put me in a water game

1050
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:42,960
with you right now. Is there a multiplayer shark game where one team is like the sharks and the

1051
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:48,080
others are the divers? I'm going to need to look into it. Maybe we can play that as a streamstank

1052
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:59,040
game. I'm a really good swimmer. I want to take up swimming again, actually. Okay, well, I messed

1053
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:08,400
up already. It's fine. I didn't want to be first place anyway. No, no, I'm not taking it personally.

1054
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:14,720
Oh, you can fall off the map in this road. Okay, I'm going to be a Sunday driver

1055
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:23,360
because I didn't... Are we on a space station? You know, the maps are getting a bit extreme,

1056
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:30,480
map that I've met. A bit extreme for my liking, you know. Oh, we did a little stun pose. Yeah,

1057
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:39,040
this map is crazy. Yeah, fuck you. I'm going for a knee. Sorry, your team blue. Get right team

1058
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:46,720
blue. No, no, no. Yes. No, not the red though. Not the red though. So much for auto turning.

1059
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:51,680
The game said, no, you're not getting it. Okay, that was so lucky that little bump pad thing was

1060
02:08:51,680 --> 02:09:00,400
there or I was a goner. I'm not going to lie. My steering is terrible. I got saved by bumping into

1061
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:14,480
that. What is he holding? I'm so scared to go past him. Okay, can I even... I can? Oh, right. Oh,

1062
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:19,120
right. Hold on a minute. Oh my god, both me and Roon are actually trashed. Sorry, Roon, to pick on

1063
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,640
you, but literally both me and you are doing the exact same mistake. Right, hold on. All right, okay,

1064
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:29,120
okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

1065
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:34,560
Oh my god, right. As long as I'm in front of Roon and sauce, but you're actually my competitor.

1066
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:42,000
No, no, he got a bullet. He got a bullet. Why did I not get a bullet? Oh my god, this map is so hard

1067
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:52,080
for no reason. I'm stuck. Okay, right. No, it's fine. I didn't want to be... I don't want to rank

1068
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:57,280
anyway. I didn't even want to finish this map. Of course I want to do not finish. Did not finish,

1069
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:05,120
bro. Bro, please give me another bullet. I need all the help I can get. Are you serious?

1070
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:12,480
No, I can't use this one on this map. Breastrokes with Strony.

1071
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:23,680
Sorry, this map. I'm so sorry, teammates. I hope you're carrying. This map is impossible. I can't

1072
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:32,400
do it. I honestly can't do it. My freaking baby mobile is just... Bro, it's no happening.

1073
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:35,520
Yeah, I need two bullets, please.

1074
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:45,520
I've got one, and then I'm going to lightening everyone. Sorry if I just got you, but you're

1075
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:51,040
getting annihilated. Wait, I've got another bullet. Maybe I can become 11. Maybe I can do 11th

1076
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:59,120
place. That's right, bro. Suck it. Suck it, bro. Take it. Take it like a giveaway fun. I'm not

1077
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:04,320
Did we win? Oh my god, it's so close. Did we win?

1078
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:08,480
Did we win?

1079
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,280
Did we win? Is there one more?

1080
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:26,000
Oh my god, we won! We won! Yay! Thank you, teammates. Thank you, KK9Grey, Dreal, Yoshi, Feathers,

1081
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:29,040
Diablo. We did it! We actually won!

1082
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,600
This game, I was getting more mushrooms than the Navali or Maros.

1083
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:43,280
Are you okay, Brian? Oh my god, Brian. Are you okay? He really struggled. Oh my god, the only time

1084
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:54,320
I win is by cheating. Thank you, Reeflings. Thank you, Anonymous. Wait, I'm going to get Brian to

1085
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:58,080
replay that because I don't know why he said it like that. He was really not feeling it.

1086
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:04,960
Are you squiddling right now? Are you trying again, Brian? This damn game, I was getting more

1087
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:11,200
mushrooms than the Navali or Maros. The Navali or Maros? Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Anonymous,

1088
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:17,520
for the tip. True, real 4K. I'm really literally greeting right now. I'll literally beat you up.

1089
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:23,120
I'm so sorry. I got the least amount of points, but at least Momay is happy. Yeah, I'll get you

1090
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:29,200
next time. Wait, how did you do that animation? How did I do that? I'll get you next time.

1091
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:37,120
I'll get you next time. That's so unfair. I'll get you next time. I'll get you next time. I'll

1092
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:43,200
like that. Never happier to be being also the game you ask is the one called Truck Versus Divers

1093
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:49,840
and the game is called Depps. Oh, we might look into that. Velo Marios. Honestly, my first

1094
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:55,520
time playing, I don't care if I win or lose. That was so good. That was literally so good.

1095
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:00,000
I'm so happy with that ending. Literally, I lose the entire time, but right at the end,

1096
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:06,320
refling, clutch it up for me feels good, Mom. Don't mean to fudge you. Don't mean to fudge you.

1097
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:15,600
Right, where's my customization? Who's streaming? Is Emmy? Oh, AC's live still? Okay, we're going

1098
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:22,000
to redirect into AC. I never get this opportunity. Okay, we're redirecting into AC. Get ready for a

1099
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,840
party because she's doing karaoke. Thank you again so much, Reflings, for hanging out with me. You

1100
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:40,240
get one big wet water kiss, okay? You like that, didn't you? I did my best. Good refling. Okay,

1101
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:44,640
I see you, Giffy Gibbers, tomorrow for crying stream. Apparently, we're just crying tomorrow,

1102
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:48,560
so yay, we have fun at that. Okay, bye-bye, Reflings, kiss, kiss,

1103
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:57,920
