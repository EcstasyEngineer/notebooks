05:21.320 --> 05:29.080
um uh like childhood talk stream she she hasn't done one thing she actually only showed a part of

05:29.080 --> 05:33.640
her childhood at the start of streaming that's it make her look like she eats an i-hop six pack

05:33.640 --> 05:38.920

05:52.360 --> 05:59.800
no clue why you think this would be azura at all like it it's actually kind of i don't know i feel

05:59.800 --> 06:08.840
like you're being stereotypical here what are you talking about ruthlyn see it's not azura at all

06:08.840 --> 06:22.040

06:53.240 --> 06:59.480

07:03.320 --> 07:07.480

07:07.480 --> 07:14.680
like okay i'm gonna sip my tea but good morning hope you guys are having fun i've tried to upload

07:14.680 --> 07:19.960
all of my streams for this week youtube is having a hissy fit so they're all at the wrong time and

07:19.960 --> 07:28.200
stuff but i have picked my um little i have picked what i'm gonna do this week how long does it take

07:28.200 --> 07:34.360
to draw well considering i have absolutely no um hours behind drawing i don't know how long this

07:34.360 --> 07:38.920
is gonna take i have no idea what i'm doing i'm just here for a good time but i've got goth eye hop

07:38.920 --> 07:48.200
right here right what have you decided pick draw pick draw pick draw all right okay you guys have

07:48.200 --> 07:55.560
decided guys have decided right let me slurp my tea okay so the first things first you need to pick

07:55.560 --> 08:03.720
the three colors that go behind the design okay so you guys have said goth eye hop is eye hop's

08:03.720 --> 08:10.760
logo red yeah is eye hop's logo red my brain wants to say it's red yes or no be be honest

08:14.200 --> 08:19.240
good afternoon hope your day's going great my day hasn't even ended yet i have not slept

08:21.640 --> 08:26.520
there's a new development behind the scenes and i can't even leak it i of course the eye hop is

08:27.000 --> 08:32.200
it's like blue and white it's blue and white a blue and white goth so blue

08:33.480 --> 08:39.240
white and black for the goth okay so this is our little color palette that we get to pull from

08:40.040 --> 08:44.760
it's blue with red accents okay and then obviously because it's goth we have to do black

08:44.760 --> 08:54.440
so this is our color scheme developed now for a cheeky goth um okay there's a little red uh

08:54.440 --> 08:59.240
maybe maybe i'll do a red god i'm returning into france over here steady on

09:02.280 --> 09:10.280
okay so for our totally not she be design um for our pupil let's start with the pupil

09:11.160 --> 09:19.480
she is a goth goths are known for how dark they are what's a dark pupil that we could make i have

09:19.560 --> 09:24.440
no idea so first let's do the pupil that's the most important part of a veal or design because

09:24.440 --> 09:30.920
we do not have like a default pupil oh god that's so squiggly let's give her eyelashes oh you're

09:30.920 --> 09:42.040
so kawaii ooh lovely oh my god you're such a beautiful girl uh an american god did you at least

09:42.040 --> 09:48.680
get a good nap no i got like 30 minutes why no slime girls i think we're probably going to be

09:48.680 --> 09:56.840
designing a slime girl i think we're probably going to be designing a slime girl red red white

09:56.840 --> 10:05.240
and blue goths are known for their love of kenny from south park vampire bat shape i think a goth

10:05.240 --> 10:16.840
would be cross an upside down cross maybe now your pupils really cannot be black well actually

10:16.840 --> 10:23.640
no that's exactly what color the pupils are they are normally black but for a vtuber it's not like

10:23.640 --> 10:30.200
how you're supposed to do it oh strani what do you know about development fuck all i don't draw i just

10:30.200 --> 10:36.520
like you just can what looks good so we're just gonna do a darker hue on the outer side of her

10:36.520 --> 10:44.360
eyes like that and then for the cross should we do it black i mean we could get away with it being

10:44.360 --> 10:50.840
black a little upside down cross like this for the oh that's that looks like a plus sign try again

10:51.560 --> 10:56.520
he won't strong it there we go upside down cross for the pupils and then it would have like the

10:56.520 --> 11:07.320
accent of um oh maybe no that looks too silly okay it would just have like a little white

11:07.320 --> 11:13.400
highlight around it i'm covering up the black note you know what i'm trying to do right you guys can

11:14.120 --> 11:20.760
do this right yes for the slime girl you have to pick what body type you can have milk you can

11:20.760 --> 11:24.840
have regular or you can have a lollipop on the slime but you guys can we'll do that after we've

11:24.840 --> 11:32.840
designed our little une san okay so we've got our pupil type already fantastic um if she is her big

11:32.840 --> 11:42.120
sister i don't normally see um how the fuck do i zoom in oh hold on hold on i'll pause this

11:42.120 --> 11:49.160
stuff there we go boom zoom in like this um oh that looks even worse zoomed in who thought of

11:49.160 --> 11:55.720
this stream i mean it was me but it's even worse than i imagined okay so now we need to transplant

11:55.720 --> 12:02.520
her eyes on right so when it comes to anime the eyes are like down here okay so don't be

12:02.520 --> 12:12.360
fooled the eyes need to start like all the way down here it looks weird right okay why did it wiggle

12:13.080 --> 12:19.800
don't wiggle please don't wiggle no right don't do it that way don't do the actual circle so this

12:19.880 --> 12:27.640
is une san is she a smoker if she's a goth she would smoke right we'll do a little ciggy hanging

12:27.640 --> 12:33.560
out of her mouth at least cigarette cigarette was it is it brown at the bottom yeah brown at the

12:33.560 --> 12:39.160
bottom where the filter is and then she's got like a little a little smoke thing you want red lipstick

12:39.160 --> 12:45.960
oh i guess for the accent yeah oh maybe she has like she always has like little kissed cigarettes

12:45.960 --> 12:55.720
around her this looks awful now you see why i literally do not design these girls

12:57.320 --> 13:02.600
this is awful okay so that's sorry i'm completely like messing this up as well

13:03.480 --> 13:10.680
you never saw a cigarette before i don't i have seen them but i don't smoke so it makes it harder

13:10.680 --> 13:17.480
to imagine what i'm supposed to do at this stage okay then upside down cross oh my god she's gonna

13:17.480 --> 13:24.120
look like a muppet do i look like a muppet to you i mean a little bit oh god i need to zoom in even

13:24.120 --> 13:29.320
more oh my god this is like i don't want to zoom i'm getting scared to zoom in it looks scarier

13:30.200 --> 13:33.880
she's oh she's looking like a clown you know that oh this is

13:34.840 --> 13:40.840
are you squinting me right now oh his idea was this black lipstick also requesting to redest

13:40.840 --> 13:46.440
her and ender on the dare types fandom wiki really wish we could have both at the same time or if

13:46.440 --> 13:52.360
she could alternate between the two so you want her to have multiple personality disorder coming

13:52.360 --> 13:57.880
right up i'm sure i can find a feature over that no problem okay we're gonna give her a little wee

13:57.880 --> 14:08.120
white eyeliner thing okay and then for the hair now if you are emo real one of being emo or anything

14:08.120 --> 14:16.040
you you require bangs of some kind it doesn't matter what they are you require bangs of some kind

14:16.040 --> 14:23.560
so we have four points to her eyes so i'm going to give her so i've got three bangs like if you if

14:23.560 --> 14:29.080
you count above my eyeballs there's three oh thank you for this strong if you want to find the person

14:29.080 --> 14:34.760
who keeps making you do all these bad ideas just look in the mirror tell us how the fight went

14:34.760 --> 14:41.800
afterwards oh my god that's just thank you thank you raven for the tip again and then thank you tiny

14:41.800 --> 14:48.600
spiny for insulting me to my face rude you know i'll actually say one thing i submitted for

14:48.600 --> 14:54.840
something like this i didn't get it back but i submitted so she needs four say that's three that

14:54.840 --> 15:04.120
i'm just drawing myself god damn it wait hold on four how'd i get four that's five what but that's

15:04.120 --> 15:13.080
three so how did i get four five one two three four oh that's four hold on a minute hold on a

15:13.080 --> 15:20.200
minute i can't can't right she would have bangs no it can't go over her eyes because that's like

15:20.200 --> 15:29.480
real number one of each of her so one bang two three four god i am special okay well right if she's

15:29.480 --> 15:37.880
emo i hop so she would serve so she would have a cap on right like one of them those caps how do

15:37.880 --> 15:46.040
you draw a cap i don't know i don't know how to draw a cap okay we take off her top of their head

15:47.080 --> 15:52.520
i'm so sorry bowl haircut no hold on let it develop right so she'd be wearing a cap right

15:52.520 --> 16:01.560
those like those hats that like come like this right and it would say i hop but because it's

16:01.560 --> 16:12.680
your inappropriate onesans she was i hop on yo don't worry the algorithm can't read that okay and

16:12.680 --> 16:20.840
then for the back of her hair what would we do some kind of i don't know let's get rid of the

16:20.840 --> 16:27.320
cigarette smoke mr. cigarette you're in her way i will remove you at once thank you okay but for

16:27.320 --> 16:33.720
her hair if she's got she needs like intricate like multiple things like coming out but what maybe

16:34.520 --> 16:41.640
first do like the little no tell you what tell you what no hold on this went from chat giving strong

16:41.640 --> 16:48.120
ideas to roasting the process give her twin tails but i'm biased towards twin tails i love i love

16:48.120 --> 16:56.280
symmetrical hair like that i'm gonna make her asymmetrical on purpose okay so one side is gonna

16:56.280 --> 17:02.920
be a bunch that come oh my god this is awful that comes out right and it's super duper long

17:02.920 --> 17:12.360
because she's so edgy like that yeah she's just such an edgy onesan okay and then it's gonna be black

17:12.360 --> 17:19.560
i'm so sorry she'd be here it's gonna be black but she's gonna have like the classic like oh this is

17:19.560 --> 17:25.640
an asian in a in a video game let's give her a random purple streak and then for her bangs

17:27.000 --> 17:40.200
she's gonna have purple blue on the outside only yeah yeah okay but then on the other side this is

17:40.200 --> 17:47.080
the hideous most disgusting ugliest character design i've ever seen okay so one side is that

17:47.080 --> 17:54.440
and then the other side oh no please see jim leader sabrina from pokemon find inspiration

17:54.440 --> 17:59.960
jam leader sabrina okay i'm unironically looking the operate now i don't know how to do here

17:59.960 --> 18:07.080
is she got asymmetrical here no that's not eight well it's kind of well no it's just long

18:07.880 --> 18:15.560
so what should wait so if one side is a pom pom what the others

18:18.280 --> 18:25.240
how did people design stuff oh my god i'm not being funny but how do you design stuff

18:25.880 --> 18:28.120
this is hit this is awful

18:28.600 --> 18:33.800
no wonder this shit costs like hundreds of thousands

18:35.320 --> 18:42.120
how do you come out how do you envision what the freaking process is well hang it on the fridge

18:42.120 --> 18:46.840
i like to think that these are references that stony said no i absolutely did not send us

18:47.880 --> 18:56.040
normally with the research right let me finish my tea the hands right you know what

18:56.040 --> 19:00.120
she's just gonna have one ponytail because i can't even figure it out i'll give her like

19:01.240 --> 19:08.040
i don't know that like those bangs that come at the side though i don't know do we give her

19:08.040 --> 19:15.240
like a little wing right no no we'll just give her bangs at the side so every artist can skip

19:15.240 --> 19:22.040
drawn the ears because if you have ears the artist doesn't like it right and then we'll just connect

19:22.440 --> 19:28.200
her neck again so she can breathe but she is smoking okay right and then for the outfit so

19:28.200 --> 19:36.600

22:17.720 --> 22:23.640
and it hangs above her uniform and she doesn't take it off because you secretly gave her it

22:23.640 --> 22:28.280
that's would you do a slime girl for gen 2 if i sent you three cans of Pringles

22:30.200 --> 22:35.960
no you couldn't even pay me for a slime girl i'm not even kidding someone could like

22:35.960 --> 22:43.400
fucking wallop their cock on the desk right now with like a fat 1000 us dollars you will not convince

22:43.400 --> 22:49.960
me to have a slime girl i am not debuffing someone so harshly okay it is paramount that

22:49.960 --> 22:59.240
her left eyebrow has a piercing it must be visually it her right but visually our left okay

23:00.680 --> 23:07.480
visually our left but it's her right because she's always right we kneel for our big sister

23:08.360 --> 23:14.760
it's can of Pringles thank you anonymous can of fucking Pringles fucking shovel can of Pringles

23:14.760 --> 23:24.360
up your arse right Raven thank you for your tip and what you want to call her Hicks marina

23:25.960 --> 23:35.400
what about four cans of Pringles anonymous stop it young man so the price is how much no there's

23:35.400 --> 23:42.440
no i i'm not giving someone a slime girl debuff at least if i like someone wants an alternative

23:42.440 --> 23:49.640
sure but i'm not giving someone a slime debuff the the gimmick of a slime disappears after about

23:49.640 --> 23:54.040
20 seconds okay i don't care what you say we're about to draw a slime girl together and i'm going

23:54.040 --> 24:02.280
to prove to you that the debuff is like so quick right i want it to be like really like this is

24:02.280 --> 24:06.840
this button is ready to pop i don't know if you guys have seen sin sister's very unique toggle

24:07.480 --> 24:18.040
but this shirt is ready to pop okay do i make myself clear okay and then we just need to connect

24:18.040 --> 24:28.840
the shirt because that's how shirts work okay beautiful stunning now now what okay pan i mean

24:28.920 --> 24:37.320
it's really rare for v-tubers to have a shorts in general so honestly i am down for shorts like

24:37.320 --> 24:46.520
emmy has we shorts i don't know i actually wouldn't mind the kind of like covered up thingy and then

24:47.480 --> 24:55.000
we do the fishnets what's that i'm going to manually draw fishnets oh you bet your you

24:55.000 --> 25:02.040
bet your ass i am that's right because we're using ms paint that if you think this stream is painful

25:02.040 --> 25:08.440
now you just wait until we start drawing the slime girl i am drawing directly on top of these bases

25:08.440 --> 25:17.000
and there's nothing you can do about it manually pop that like behind me hi mommy sorry i'm late

25:17.000 --> 25:27.000
ah i don't be silly not late right oh wait hold on no we're doing full body fishnets like i um sorry

25:27.000 --> 25:35.320
we're doing full bottom fishnets so the fishnets are viewable up here above her thing hold on let me

25:35.320 --> 25:42.760
just let me just swing my cock around because the fishnets would go above the shorts as well

25:42.760 --> 25:50.040
just to really solidify that she's emo and it's not it's not it's not a phase mom okay

25:52.120 --> 25:59.320
and then we do it this way and just like that we have created new fishnets

26:00.200 --> 26:05.880
what's that this is the cringiest design you've ever seen and it's the most basic one yeah what

26:06.040 --> 26:12.280
you're gonna do for it yeah you're gonna love it aren't you and then when gen two does actually get

26:12.280 --> 26:17.320
revealed you guys are gonna laugh even harder looking at these because i already know what gen

26:17.320 --> 26:28.440
two look like and you do not there we go and then if you didn't know at the end of a taste there's

26:28.440 --> 26:35.640
like a woman is racist you she hates slime girls oh i didn't know where you were going with that and

26:35.640 --> 26:45.080
i was like excuse me refling i thought you were actually calling i was like excuse me right okay

26:45.080 --> 26:53.000
it's fine thank you for the tip anonymous i'm drawing i'm drawing a slime okay you you have

26:53.000 --> 27:00.760
bullied me into submission i am drawing a slime after this one so the slime accusations can disappear

27:01.720 --> 27:10.520
okay and then no one can call me slay mist again okay i believe in non osmosis supremacy okay if

27:10.520 --> 27:15.960
you didn't know osmosis is a high concentration gradient to a low low concentration gradient

27:17.000 --> 27:22.520
high concentration there concentration i can't remember what was mean yours okay and then we

27:22.520 --> 27:25.320
did a little tool thing there's a little tool thing at the end of the fishnet

27:26.280 --> 27:35.080
okay fishnets are almost done we're almost there

27:36.600 --> 27:40.840
um we need to do the buttons on the shorts i love when the shorts have the buttons

27:41.400 --> 27:45.480
i know she sits on her shorts funny because that button hits her button real good

27:46.680 --> 27:52.520
stop it it's like first thing in the morning i have not slept so i'm extra delirious honestly

27:52.520 --> 27:59.480
right i love when the shorts do that thing where it's like this and then it has a button here and

27:59.480 --> 28:05.960
then it goes along and then like that oh well i guess that's the top of the shorts

28:08.600 --> 28:14.920
no okay are you squiddin me right now are you squiddin me right now suggestions black thong strings

28:14.920 --> 28:22.680
on her hips fishnet cell book gloves black handcuffs and ankle restraints black lipstick

28:22.680 --> 28:29.320
one tiny black heart under just one eye black heart shaped pupils no i'm sticking with my

28:29.320 --> 28:38.120
shitty pupils i've already decided right i'll take the heart piercing heart it's very clear

28:38.120 --> 28:44.360
that she's also pierced in a few other regions for no particular reason i'm just making sure i've

28:44.440 --> 28:51.800
got the shirt detail correct yep um how the fuck are belly piercings how do belly buttons

28:51.800 --> 28:56.840
piercings work i actually don't know like is that a line no it's not a line it goes in the skin

28:57.480 --> 29:04.440
okay she's also pierced in another region because you know she kind of freaky like that but uh you

29:04.440 --> 29:13.480
can't get a toe piercing so that doesn't count um i actually controversially like the short

29:13.480 --> 29:20.600
fishnet gloves i think because of the contrast that would play with the long leg fishnets

29:20.600 --> 29:26.360
and then the glove very it's very short glove variation almost as if she's

29:28.040 --> 29:35.080
like willing to touch you and you crave what you can get through the fishnet because if it was like

29:35.080 --> 29:43.480
full length it's like oh the touch isn't as you know deep but it's deep uh i think maybe we'll

29:43.480 --> 29:48.840
give her long black nails as well like classic long black nails i think that would do quite well

29:52.600 --> 29:57.560
because like i mean come on be honest oh look at that come on don't you oh wait no hold on we'll

29:57.560 --> 30:04.040
make her nails the same colors her eyeballs oh my god this is we're doing it i love piercings

30:04.040 --> 30:11.720
because they taste like coins and i'm all about the money why why that's hilarious okay but she has

30:11.720 --> 30:16.680
like longer fingernails like coffin shape if any of you guys know what coffin shape nails are you're

30:16.680 --> 30:24.360
a real one she got oh who i keep disappearing off to someone else what do you mean drawing on ms

30:24.360 --> 30:30.200
paint isn't a valid way to create an entire feature remote what are you talking about honestly right

30:30.200 --> 30:40.680
for the the shorts there's not really much detail to it beyond what meets the eye should they be

30:40.680 --> 30:47.640
short or um maybe they should be shorter in the fishnet raised up

30:47.640 --> 30:55.160
uh okay okay i think they should be raised up let's raise them up

31:08.600 --> 31:13.400
what what do you mean i'm delirious because i've not had enough sleep i have no idea what you're

31:13.400 --> 31:20.120
talking about you are crazy whoa that's not how to erase something i guess we have to color in her

31:20.120 --> 31:28.200
legs honestly i mean i'll take it it's fine i was gonna suggest that but i don't know coffin nails

31:28.200 --> 31:38.360
are the best oh yeah we shadow wizard money game we love coffin okay our little and then

31:39.240 --> 31:47.880
and then her model oh my god then her catchphrase is gonna be um her catchphrase if i can get it out

31:47.880 --> 32:01.880
is gonna be why does it her catchphrase is gonna be let me serve you okay but obviously it's like

32:01.880 --> 32:08.760
the winky face kind like excellent excellent let me serve you yeah like that kind of thing

32:10.040 --> 32:16.760
what country do you come from a country called scotland forever okay this is the

32:16.760 --> 32:23.560
shitest design ever okay well there she is so oh god is that really it is that oh i've got to offer

32:23.560 --> 32:30.040
this world oh it's awful right her name's hex could you get any more stereotypical

32:32.040 --> 32:37.720
there's nothing to the design i'll take it though i'll i think that's okay i would give this design

32:37.720 --> 32:48.200
i would rate it great out of basic did you know ms paint has layers oh does it actually

32:48.200 --> 32:53.080
that probably would have anyway uh i'm just gonna bring her to life because you know wait can i

32:53.080 --> 33:00.520
can i oh i don't know how i did it but i managed to close the gap on the eyeballs okay right

33:02.600 --> 33:05.640
yes i mean that's all we can do

33:07.480 --> 33:13.080
because i don't have anything else to add to her we have done goth i hop employee of the month

33:13.800 --> 33:21.880
ero dere goth nisan and then uh her name's hex her pupil is an upside down cross with

33:21.880 --> 33:29.080
white outlines to it um she wears an infinity collar but it's actually secretly your infinity

33:29.080 --> 33:34.680
collar that you gave her and then she says let me serve you winky face xoxo and she has a smoke

33:34.680 --> 33:44.600
and addiction and she's got piercings out the wazo um aren't we being a little extra she can't be

33:44.600 --> 33:54.360
barefoot i mean uh in the house she can because you know you share a house i mean i wouldn't put

33:54.360 --> 34:00.360
her in heels servers don't wear heel heels servers wear trainers because it's too sore

34:01.720 --> 34:06.120
literally i have formed this dick what you want me to put in james i'll put in james right now don't

34:06.120 --> 34:12.360
think i want shorter nails because she works in the food industry and only son needs to be able

34:12.360 --> 34:20.440
to properly take care of her darling brother's prostate health daily you said you said that part

34:20.440 --> 34:27.640
i'll load again raven you said that part thank you for the tip now i'll let you in on a little

34:27.640 --> 34:35.320
secret about the service industry if you are just a waitress and all you have to do is hold the little

34:35.320 --> 34:44.760
tree of food and drinks i have fantastic news you can have long nails if however you prepare things

34:44.760 --> 34:54.680
as a waitress you cannot have long nails because you're preparing food but if you're only doing

34:54.680 --> 35:05.480
the serving and the gathering like that and dempo is a genia can you make a really sexy

35:05.480 --> 35:13.640
sweaty mean chubby mum i mean i think that's all i can do with our beloved hex so we'll move on to

35:13.640 --> 35:20.360
the next right you guys pick a body type for the slime you have three body types pick and it's totally

35:20.360 --> 35:28.200
not between azura strongy or a super body type we'd long here nails mix up no depends if you're

35:28.200 --> 35:36.600
using a server tree they could just be press-ons real real and true wrist and ankle cuffs like a

35:36.600 --> 35:47.160
bracelet as you can tell i'm not very good at imagining and she's got one shoe because i gave

35:47.160 --> 35:52.520
up halfway through making this shoe azura strongy do a poll oh yes of course we can do a poll don't

35:52.520 --> 36:04.200
be so silly hold on let me do a poll start poll slain is what body type azuras strong wild card

36:04.200 --> 36:11.640
sorry i see let's go leave azura alone we can think of something better you don't want slime

36:13.320 --> 36:13.960
azura

36:17.320 --> 36:23.240
um right i'm getting the slime out of the way and then after that anymore slain mentions oh my god

36:23.240 --> 36:32.760
that's awful that's awful yeah this is why i literally do not create uh virtual models

36:33.560 --> 36:40.200
oh wow you want a milf slime what the heck i didn't expect that i thought you would want a lollipop

36:40.200 --> 36:49.400
slime oh i forgot god make the slain girl as close to strongy's but what just to upset me even more

36:50.120 --> 36:56.360
you want to upset me reeflings how dare you can we get a methodic did body type got you covered

36:56.360 --> 37:07.080
already and add that's exactly for azura's body type for the architect southern cow pork

37:07.080 --> 37:10.840
chubby pig girl oh no i wouldn't put a pig on a big body type that's not nice

37:13.240 --> 37:19.800
slain girl you can drown in i mean i guess uh it looks like azura is still winning so yeah

37:19.800 --> 37:31.160
slain girl being thick to drown in her yeah a urethra slice if wait right i'll tell you what

37:31.160 --> 37:39.480
if i ever develop a slain girl the first audio i'll make her a record is a slain girl claims

37:39.480 --> 37:46.120
into your urethra and tickles your pickle from the inside out that'll be my deal you asked for

37:46.120 --> 37:57.080
slain girl she's she's crawling inside upset slain mummy well slain mummy is i'm satisfied

37:57.880 --> 38:02.600
stop the count i'm satisfied right what claw is the slain

38:02.600 --> 38:10.440
and okay what color is the slime is the question

38:12.760 --> 38:21.160
no deal promise slain girl digest you she has a deal that sounds very uncomfortable is there a

38:21.160 --> 38:28.200
downside to stop uh you don't have to sell her anymore jokes on you i'm into that

38:28.200 --> 38:33.720
have her climb into me and pilot my meat so i would be down for that i like the main control

38:33.720 --> 38:46.280
thing you want a brown slime no okay so here we go uh done okay there's your slime girl right can we

38:46.280 --> 38:55.080
move on teasing i'll actually put some effort okay so we've got we've got milf oh hold on the

38:55.960 --> 39:01.640
well milf slime why wait i told it to make the text black oh it doesn't matter

39:03.080 --> 39:07.720
okay first pick the color scheme oh wait hold on that's like gonna be in her hair right milf

39:07.720 --> 39:14.200
slime one two and three we need to pick a color scheme green white a brown slime just sounds like

39:14.200 --> 39:20.680
diarrhea jello okay that's kind of mildly true red would be a unique slime claw

39:20.680 --> 39:31.640
base i'm a sucker for blue i mean she you yeah hex was originally supposed to be blue but kind of

39:31.640 --> 39:41.400
messed up between what so like blue for one claw of the slime and then the accent color will be like

39:41.400 --> 39:50.120
a neon pink i think this is the accent claw have like little hints of it in between maybe

39:50.200 --> 39:57.480
maybe like green as well like just make her like really just off of rgb slightly and make her like

39:57.480 --> 40:03.720
a jelly thing polka dot slime would be cute two tone white green or white purple

40:07.160 --> 40:11.320
okay maybe not green then i don't think you guys are fuss for the green right how about accent

40:11.880 --> 40:20.680
white and blue main and then accent is pink okay let's see what we can come up with now so

40:22.920 --> 40:34.120
i can do right oh and just just for now imagine so that's the body okay now you can put clothes on

40:34.120 --> 40:39.400
a slime girl it looks terrible i know it looks terrible but you can put clothes on a slime girl

40:40.360 --> 40:46.280
see it oh no she's she's she's on hello sherbert's slime

40:47.640 --> 40:53.560
paint bucket artis what can i say i really i do myself now i like when the slime girl

40:53.560 --> 41:00.200
is dripping i and because you guys wanted the milk i wouldn't mind some sort of

41:00.200 --> 41:07.560
like implications of dripping here oh that's awful that's like nothing like a drip holy crap

41:09.400 --> 41:16.760
Oh my god, that's- how the frick do you make a drip? Like dripping from the belly button and stuff. How do you do that?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.920
Why is this so much harder?

41:23.160 --> 41:24.600
Oh my god.

41:24.600 --> 41:28.040
Haven't you found respect for concept artists? I can't believe it.

41:28.040 --> 41:35.040
All that took was one attempt at doing something and then I understand why it's not as- she got that drip rain jacket body

41:35.040 --> 41:42.240
So white droplets. Oh, it probably should actually be white. Very oopsies. Let me just add a little white onto it real quick. Oh

41:43.520 --> 41:45.280
little

41:45.280 --> 41:47.280
Whiteness in there

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
I'm dripping from the belly button

41:51.360 --> 41:53.840
You can't really drip from a toe. So we'll drip from that ankle

41:54.320 --> 41:59.120
Is your drip? You just need to draw sweat honestly. Okay. Now you can draw an outfit

41:59.920 --> 42:06.960
So sue is currently the most popular slime, and I will not be taking any aligunkies that she's not

42:11.520 --> 42:20.080
If she's blue like if she's actually blue, I think I might have to give her what yellow jacket like actual rain jacket style

42:21.600 --> 42:24.960
Oh god, she looks like a genie. You know that? Oh my god

42:25.600 --> 42:30.880
I don't think this is working the way I wanted it to. She's like princess leah like add some red in there

42:30.880 --> 42:33.120
And then you've just got princess leah going on

42:36.640 --> 42:40.400
She's blue. How buddy? How would I you want a swimsuit?

42:41.760 --> 42:45.920
I like that. Keep cooking a swimsuit milk

42:48.880 --> 42:50.880
That I do not mind

42:51.120 --> 42:57.040
Healy is what profile picture. Thank you for coming to member. I appreciate it membership streams start up next week

42:57.920 --> 42:59.920
Not this week next week

42:59.920 --> 43:03.040
There's going to be ton of membership streams bombed right at the end of this month

43:03.520 --> 43:08.880
Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right. I want a swimsuit. How do you draw a swimsuit? Hold on

43:10.160 --> 43:12.720
I'm going to look up women's wet and

43:14.160 --> 43:20.720
Because I don't know what it looks like because I wear a very funny swimsuit that covers me up completely

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
Mm-hmm

43:23.200 --> 43:30.320
Um, I guess it would honestly just what we'll go for like the classic like the it would be like up here

43:30.480 --> 43:33.120
It oh my god, that's quite a high. It's a hard to be

43:36.080 --> 43:40.960
Oh, sorry, I've got that freaking spot. Well, I her thing went sideways

43:43.440 --> 43:45.440
And then

43:45.760 --> 43:47.760
I

43:49.360 --> 43:53.120
Can you do hold on a minute. Can you do a swimsuit that looks like this?

43:53.680 --> 43:57.280
Whoa, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me cook. Let me cook. Let me cook. This is awful

43:57.280 --> 44:01.280
Don't let me cook by the way, but can I do a swimsuit

44:02.080 --> 44:06.560
That's held up by straps. I'm just drawing a zero then if it's held up by straps

44:07.280 --> 44:09.040
gosh darn it

44:09.040 --> 44:12.800
Azura get out of my head. Oh, I'm like the kitten

44:16.160 --> 44:19.120
Come here. Okay, so it's like this

44:21.040 --> 44:24.240
Let's get rid of that. He's just getting a bit confused and that's in the way

44:25.040 --> 44:31.760
Uh, and then what uh, what was the slimes name be slime mix slime McGee?

44:32.960 --> 44:34.960
I don't know

44:35.440 --> 44:40.880
She can't have a naked model in each of the slime needs clothes jeweler the fake delete you

44:41.840 --> 44:49.440
Uh, she has a skeleton. I don't know. Slimes are like osmosis. I feel like she'd accidentally pick stuff up though

44:50.160 --> 44:54.640
So I wouldn't mind putting some jewelry on her. Fuck it. You can get like a wee anklet thing going on

44:54.800 --> 44:59.280
This is just Azura. God damn. Why is it so hard right? What would be inside a slime?

44:59.600 --> 45:03.600
What a slime would accidentally pick up juice. Whoa, where's my thing?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.880
Right, let's let's put some juice

45:07.440 --> 45:12.480
Slimes love juice. So we're going to give her a can of cola in her thigh. Okay. This is cola

45:16.240 --> 45:19.360
There we go, so she actually got cola in her

45:20.800 --> 45:22.240
Um

45:22.240 --> 45:30.000
White button down dress through she be office. Maybe there is no she be. This is gen two. We've got hex

45:30.720 --> 45:36.800
We've got milf slime that doesn't even have a name yet. I'm unironically ever just going to call her slime McGee right now

45:37.840 --> 45:39.840
Slimey

45:41.600 --> 45:43.600
Slimey

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
Slime McGee

45:47.120 --> 45:49.120
Here we go

45:49.120 --> 45:55.600
Beautiful stunning gorgeous for her eyeball. You'll never guess what's going to be in her eyeball

45:57.920 --> 46:03.280
So she's gonna have that and then her eyeball is going to be a droplet. Okay

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
But the actual

46:06.960 --> 46:12.400
pupil hold on let me let me close this off so I can do the old copy and paste method

46:14.560 --> 46:16.560
A chris diet

46:16.560 --> 46:23.120
Diet cook, diet cook. Don't let strongy pick names again. Still I'm so sad that I'm not allowed to name after admit

46:23.120 --> 46:27.840
The names up and picked her way better than anything I could have come up with. Oh, hey

46:28.480 --> 46:30.480
Um, right drop

46:30.960 --> 46:35.680
A little droplet like would be her pupil and it like wiggles around

46:37.600 --> 46:40.880
And then we're gonna do that boom just like that

46:42.720 --> 46:46.240
And then obviously we'll just add like a bit of weight to do the

46:47.040 --> 46:50.960
Um, like highly saying that I anime eyes always have

46:51.920 --> 46:59.280
So now we will draw on the slimes. Oh, you have lovely anime at big anime eyes gorgeous stunning, right do the half

46:59.520 --> 47:00.560
Whoa

47:00.560 --> 47:04.800
I made this oh, I actually made it bigger. Okay. Do the half face. It's like down here

47:05.520 --> 47:12.240
Okay, do the eye do the eye do the eye do the eye and then she's like looking at you with her gliby eyes

47:12.320 --> 47:14.320
Oh god, she's gonna be alien

47:14.640 --> 47:16.640
She's got very big eyes

47:17.200 --> 47:19.200
Very big anime eyes

47:20.240 --> 47:22.240
Anime anime give them an anime

47:23.760 --> 47:27.040
And then we do the accent color which is this

47:27.600 --> 47:31.200
Pink which I've literally not put anywhere else on the design

47:32.000 --> 47:34.800
I don't know who designed her but you've done a terrible job

47:35.600 --> 47:37.840
Because you've not done any of that accent color. Okay

47:42.800 --> 47:46.480
I'm like jewelry, but I'm like Azura has jewelry. I'm just recreating Azura

47:47.680 --> 47:50.000
Pondela Buzum. No

47:50.000 --> 47:53.040
Fondela slime are you slimy curls?

47:53.840 --> 47:55.840
Jelsica

47:56.640 --> 47:58.480
Jelsica

47:58.480 --> 48:05.360
Like the silicone gel pot, you know someone said she has a pet fish in there her mascot could be swimming around inside her

48:06.000 --> 48:08.720
Maybe she got like a little fishy in her tummy

48:09.600 --> 48:15.520
And then she then whenever she cancels stream and she's like I've got a sore tummy is because there's a fish in her

48:16.240 --> 48:17.440
Yeah

48:17.440 --> 48:19.440
Come on. That's like so smart

48:20.320 --> 48:27.440
There and then she I was so her her shtick is like she cancels streams and she go she go tummy hurt

48:29.040 --> 48:31.040
Tummy hurt

48:31.440 --> 48:33.440
Stream cancelled

48:34.720 --> 48:37.360
Stream can't sit a little

48:39.040 --> 48:41.040
Cuz fish

48:41.360 --> 48:43.360
Yeah, there we go

48:44.320 --> 48:48.320
Boom right there a little arrow pointing to the fish come on me

48:48.960 --> 48:52.320
That's beautiful. Of course the first thing I see is my oh

48:52.800 --> 48:56.000
Because everyone would shut the fuck up about a goddamn slime girl

48:56.480 --> 49:00.160
So I give I give him so whenever someone was in the slime girl

49:00.160 --> 49:05.520
I can be like there there she is looking all ugly and shittly designed in the corner

49:05.600 --> 49:12.240
At least like hex had something going for her, but slimy slime magie. It just looks awful

49:14.320 --> 49:17.760
Jella pronounced Jella. Why is it got a

49:18.640 --> 49:23.440
Good in front of it then because that's a good. That's a good letter. Okay, you see good

49:24.560 --> 49:31.200
Slime girls were it should be a baby shark. Oh should we give her a slime tail while we're at it might as well

49:31.440 --> 49:34.960
Just just fucking farmer out the wazoo there

49:34.960 --> 49:40.640
She's got a big slimy tail and she sucks you in with it and everything gets stuck to there

49:41.360 --> 49:46.240
Can you make her more drippy and wet she's like a round wavetail

49:48.720 --> 49:51.200
What if each item inside is related to the members of the

49:54.080 --> 49:56.560
Wait, am I gonna do that? I am an idiot

49:57.200 --> 49:59.600
But I'm a happy idiot. That's the main thing there

49:59.600 --> 50:05.760
She's got a big ugly tail as well just to really emphasize. She's a slime right now. We need to deal with her freaking hair

50:06.080 --> 50:12.640
Right slimes are always droplet shaped. So what she's got like droplet bangs

50:13.120 --> 50:18.480
No, that's awful. Right. No bangs. You are getting big ugly forehead because I hate you so much

50:20.080 --> 50:22.640
Right. No do what

50:23.840 --> 50:29.920
Right, so the side bangs have to be a tear shape like that. That's that's unavoidable

50:30.480 --> 50:32.480
Oh

50:32.800 --> 50:34.800
Can she have

50:34.800 --> 50:40.720
A droplet ahayio or whatever the it's not ahayio. That's the uh thing

50:41.360 --> 50:45.200
Most of the deeper it comes in the shine of the drops looks more shiny

50:45.920 --> 50:49.280
So you admit it dempa you two understand that I hate sleep

50:50.160 --> 50:52.720
Just adding shine to the skin and the shadows will do a lot

50:53.200 --> 50:56.080
If she has the soccer mom personality, you can call her ghillie

50:56.640 --> 51:00.160
Cuz screaming jello huge drops on the side of her head

51:01.520 --> 51:02.640
Like I

51:02.640 --> 51:06.720
This is oh my god. Just give her a bowl cut. That's how much I hate her. Go away

51:08.000 --> 51:13.040
I don't like you don't ever cook again. Right. What does she have though?

51:14.320 --> 51:16.880
Would you have like a spout hair style? No

51:17.680 --> 51:23.200
A fucking shower head look right and then what her hair would just be long and flowing. I think

51:24.080 --> 51:30.480
There's no way it wouldn't be. Oh my god. This is she looks like jar jar bangs. No

51:31.920 --> 51:37.360
This is even worse. How about this? Oh, right just just

51:38.080 --> 51:40.080
Ah

51:42.160 --> 51:48.160
This looks like jar jar fucking bangs misa slime girl misa gonna hug you

51:49.760 --> 51:53.440
Ah, this is awful awful awful

51:55.680 --> 52:03.600
At least hexa has something going for her like seriously look at hexa compared to slimy slime McGee. This is awful

52:04.560 --> 52:06.560
Hair would be ocean frost

52:08.160 --> 52:12.720
Yeah, it's not just coffee a cat a slime girl from monster misumi

52:21.120 --> 52:23.120
I like

52:23.920 --> 52:25.920
I got on dvd

52:26.000 --> 52:28.800
Misa joining the via sucky. No

52:29.440 --> 52:35.280
Right, that'll be our catchphrase and then it's over with I never have to think of a slime girl again

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Was it me me?

52:39.520 --> 52:41.520
Join

52:41.760 --> 52:43.760
Did you say misa joiner?

52:44.720 --> 52:46.720
V sucky

52:46.960 --> 52:53.840
That's the catchphrase. Well, that's not catchphrase. I don't give a shit. I do not I couldn't give less of a shite

52:54.160 --> 52:56.960
Hold on. This is a bit too close to the head of the next one

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
Oh

53:01.840 --> 53:07.280
Her slime covers half of her face hiding the fact that she has a single eye swimming in her head

53:08.720 --> 53:12.560
How does this happen? How do you create jar jar banks by accident? I don't know

53:14.880 --> 53:18.720
Okay, so she's got cola in her thigh absolutely no detail

53:18.800 --> 53:24.720
What's so ever going on other than a cola in the thigh a few droplets a tail that I don't it makes no sense

53:25.120 --> 53:30.080
And for some reason when she's got fish in her stomach. So when she cancels streams

53:30.800 --> 53:32.800
Her tummy hurts because of the fish

53:33.520 --> 53:39.040
Another slime girl. No, you're done. And then she's fucking jar jar banks. Okay

53:39.680 --> 53:41.680
Now that we've got that out of our system

53:42.480 --> 53:44.160
We have

53:44.160 --> 53:50.320
three body types remaining. We've got two lollipops and a regular schmigular joe

53:50.960 --> 53:53.760
Why do you hate them so much? I don't hate them

53:55.280 --> 53:57.280
I cannot

53:57.760 --> 54:00.960
I cannot in good consciousness give a slime girl

54:01.600 --> 54:06.160
to someone if we were to expand the team at velour

54:07.040 --> 54:08.160
because

54:08.160 --> 54:09.680
It's such

54:09.680 --> 54:14.640
It's the gimmick is funny for five seconds and then no one's laughing

54:16.800 --> 54:21.280
Give her to me all yours all yours, baby take jar jar banks

54:21.840 --> 54:29.200
Slime slime McGee me so join a visa key. Shawnee hate manifested and the only creature she hates enough to depict that

54:30.880 --> 54:35.280
Shawnee aren't we missing one? There's not there is no totally not mercy present

54:35.680 --> 54:39.120
We need six girls for Jen. No, no, we just need the five because

54:43.440 --> 54:49.120
So we've got two lollipops a regular to go so what do you need a butterfly girl

54:49.920 --> 54:51.920
A butterfly girl

54:54.400 --> 54:56.560
I'm indifferent to slimes and v-tubers

54:56.880 --> 55:03.520
The only thing if an indie become slime on their own another and need to cast someone in another role jar jar gips

55:03.680 --> 55:05.680
Oh, that's actually such a good name

55:06.160 --> 55:08.160
jar jar

55:09.040 --> 55:11.040
get

55:13.360 --> 55:17.760
There's a big niche for it, but it's very specific. I just think they're cute by gay

55:18.480 --> 55:21.760
I say here is my most goofy suggestion that I could think of

55:22.160 --> 55:28.080
Claudia scientists that perform ethically questionable research on chat involving electrical devices

55:28.720 --> 55:31.040
lowly white slash green slash

55:34.800 --> 55:36.800
Wait in green

55:37.280 --> 55:42.320
Oh, you didn't see what kind of green be you said I'm mad scientist. So I kind of feel like neon

55:43.520 --> 55:45.360
green

55:45.360 --> 55:46.800
what's

55:46.880 --> 55:48.880
Kuderi, I think I know what kuderi is

55:49.440 --> 55:52.160
But I'm just gonna look up just in case look we're in the information age

55:52.160 --> 55:55.760
You're allowed to look up a Japanese time for a character appears to not have emotions

55:56.720 --> 56:00.240
Oh, she's gonna have very creepy eyes if that's the case

56:00.720 --> 56:07.120
Wait, what was it? I think I'll thank you math for the kuderi scientists

56:08.240 --> 56:10.400
A science I'm with the science team

56:11.200 --> 56:12.960
Okay, let's do her eye

56:12.960 --> 56:14.960
if she's a scientist

56:15.920 --> 56:22.720
Oh god, what's that? Oh god science symbols. I don't want the radiation one. I want like the poison one

56:25.760 --> 56:30.400
Mmm, I'm looking online and we could do a proton technically

56:32.080 --> 56:37.040
We could do DNA if she what can if you're saying she does unethical testing

56:37.600 --> 56:42.800
I it's giving DNA and if you didn't know deoxyribonucleic acid

56:45.040 --> 56:49.360
Based off the blue ghost firefly which is smaller than a grain of rice

56:50.240 --> 56:52.880
I'll show you my grain of rice. What does that mean?

56:53.440 --> 56:57.360
You didn't give me any iPhone. I would give the DNA sequence

56:59.520 --> 57:01.280
Um

57:01.280 --> 57:04.800
We could what would her accent color be red?

57:06.160 --> 57:08.160
Like minish style

57:08.480 --> 57:12.080
I turned myself into an animated tube a girl morty

57:12.640 --> 57:14.640
No, don't don't

57:15.520 --> 57:20.080
Miss morgan four armed firefly lollipop based off of the blue ghost firefly, which is small

57:23.360 --> 57:26.080
A firefly like a red angry thing

57:27.040 --> 57:29.040
I mean, we don't really have red

57:29.760 --> 57:32.160
Maybe possibly plausible. Thank you for

57:32.720 --> 57:39.520
Eating it Raven I turn myself into an anime girl. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no, right accent color

57:41.520 --> 57:43.520
Green and purple

57:44.880 --> 57:47.760
Question mark green and purple and white

57:50.080 --> 57:52.080
Yeah, yeah

57:52.800 --> 58:00.720
Big lab coat should we do like when the arms go over I like when that when it's a lollipop and the arms like completely go over

58:02.320 --> 58:03.520
I've not

58:03.520 --> 58:07.600
Hmm might hold on hold on if purple is going to be the other color. We're going to connect the

58:08.480 --> 58:15.360
DNA via the lines like that now it would probably be a bit smaller in her eyeball, but I mean, we've got it

58:16.160 --> 58:18.160
We've got it right. Okay

58:18.240 --> 58:21.520
Now ignoring hexa right there. Um

58:25.120 --> 58:27.840
Lab coat that's too big

58:28.320 --> 58:36.960
She's 19 bus 10 PhDs because she's so smart honestly, she was setting calculus at nine. What were you doing at nine years old?

58:36.960 --> 58:38.960
That's right playing Beyblades

58:39.920 --> 58:43.040
That's right. Green purple white familiar colors game

58:44.720 --> 58:46.720
Strangling

58:46.720 --> 58:49.760
I'm not purple if you were asking the new purple

58:50.720 --> 58:54.320
Green and purple. Yes. Okay. Uh a lab coat

58:54.640 --> 58:55.840
Oh

58:55.840 --> 59:00.480
How the heck is it? Yeah, okay, and it's too big for her

59:02.000 --> 59:04.800
So she'd have like sleeves that come all the way out like

59:10.160 --> 59:15.840
Scientists oh wait, why didn't Brian you didn't read that out. How the frick do you draw a lab coat? Oh my god

59:16.560 --> 59:21.920
I don't uh, so do you know that thing where you can imagine stuff in your head? I can't see stuff in my head

59:21.920 --> 59:25.600
I have to like look at stuff. Thank you lorda storms for the extended membership

59:25.680 --> 59:31.280
Scientist girl must glow like neon from experimenting on herself. She's actually a government

59:31.920 --> 59:33.200
well

59:33.200 --> 59:38.000
Right, so a lab coat can be open. I am tempted to do an open lab coat

59:38.960 --> 59:40.480
and

59:40.480 --> 59:43.840
Um, she's like really inappropriate in her conduct

59:44.720 --> 59:46.880
I think I quite like that

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
So that's what you're getting

59:50.400 --> 59:52.400
and then

59:53.440 --> 59:59.200
She doesn't wear anything in this area, but she will wear like purple panty loons

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:06.000
Okay, let's let's extend that there and then we'll just go up the body

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.960
and then

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.080
You will copy this say yeah, that's right. We're getting there. Yeah, that's right. Mm-hmm. You're gonna do a bit of

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:21.360
Right and then we're gonna erase all of this because I visually can't see it unless like this is gone

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.080
Okay, there we go. I can start I'm starting to see a little bit

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.360
Just a wee bit though

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.600
There's gonna be there's gonna have to be a lot of details on our lab coat for it to kind of

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.520
form a

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.240
Some sort of coherent design. Gonna be honest. It's not looking good already

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:56.720
But that's not gonna stop us when is when is being shit at anything ever stopped us reeflings. Hey, come on

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.840
Okay, there we have

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.720
something

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:12.160
But why are hips so big? You know what? It's fine. It's fine. Okay. And then first things first. She doesn't wear anything on

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.840
This area so we need to remove this

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.520
Like so

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.680
Is she petan? I think she's petan

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.920
I know emi's petan and I'm using emi's base, but like come on

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.200
Okay, there we go

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.800
Okay, we've got the lab coat sorted

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.880
She's awesome already

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.040
And then she wears purple

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Tongs

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320
I'm just kind of

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.600
Wait, is there a sim? Wait, hold on. Let me look at the symbols of science again. I could maybe do a symbol

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.520
Oh

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.120
I've just got an idea. How about she wears something like this, right? Okay

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.920
but secretly

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.600
This is like

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.800
It goes to the side like that and it secretly like goes all the way up here like in some crazy kind of scheme design

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.960
I don't know if I'm making any sense and then it has the um

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240
It has the neon green

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.160
And this time the scent we need to really zoom in for this one. Gotta get it accurate or else there's no point in doing it all

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.800
It's the atomic symbol like the radiation one. It's like the circle in the middle as well

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.160
Ah, yes, she has a triangle. Why yes, of course

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:49.280
And then obviously she has a pocket and then and and you know like instead of putting pens in it

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.000
She has like, I don't know a radioactive test tube that is literally glowing on her damn chest

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.440
because uh, you know

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.120
What when did a bit of radiation ever stop her? Let's be honest

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:09.920
A one-piece micro sling bikini the radio is say exactly she remember at the home. Yeah

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.480
Because and then like the string perfectly covers up her

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.960
You know

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.840
That's the biohazard. Okay. Well, she's got a biohazard. She's see then

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.840
um

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.720
Because she's a scientist she unironically wears like the steel tap steel toe cap to boots

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120
So she wears like the nice big boots

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.920
that are uh approved. Um

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.360
I don't how do how do you draw steel?

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.720
What steel?

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.800
Steel toe capped boots. Jeez go to sleep already. My goodness

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.520
like the these ones

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.760
Oh my god, it looks like roman sandals, but it's because I don't know how to just draw them

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.480
But like she wears like big chunky boots. Okay

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:05.520
And she's got a little lab coat. She's got a little radioactive thing going on. I'm here for it. Honestly, uh

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.920
But

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.420
Because she's an inappropriate scientist

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:19.200
She has like decorations and stickers and stuff on her outfit that really shouldn't be on it

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280
But that's pretty much it

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.760
Uh biohazard icon over the yeast infections

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.880
Uh, right your eyeballs. Let's draw your dna sequence eyeballs

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240
Okay, wait, that's a bit too high up

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.800
Okay, now she is freaky and has like no emotions. So she's got like extra weirdness going on

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.280
So it's green

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.680
And then purple dna to connect green

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.440
The oxyl deoxyribonucleic acid

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.760
Oh well

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.840
And then the purple I got purple. Nope that is purple

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.680
I thought that

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.560
I thought I caught that and then it's like goes over like this like in the dna sequence

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.080
I do love my dna. It's a double helix, which is extra cool

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:20.240
It means you can store even more genetic information on it. It's really cool. I mean I think that's an end right for her hair

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.880
I

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.640
Would love for her fringe to be pinned back

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.640
The question is what color should her hair be? Should it be black?

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400
I don't think it should be purple

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.480
I think it actually should be black with like an accent of purple

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.800
So I actually want her fringe to be pinned back

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.720
So I don't know how you draw that though, but basically oh god

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.440
No, not the freaking baby like like it's pinned back

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.840
Because she needs to keep her hair out of her face, but she you know what I mean, right?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.080
Right, you know, I mean like her thing and her little fringe is back

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.040
um

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.280
And then because she's in science she has to like have her hair in like little adorable bunches at the side

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.840
Um because you need to tie your hair back or it'll explode

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.360
Oh my god, what does it look like? Oh, she looks awful

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.720
Oh

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720
Green with purple highlights

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.920
But yeah, she got like a little fringe back. I don't know how to draw it anime style, but her fringe is back. Okay

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.760
And then she's got purple highlights in her hair not green purple

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.200
Oh wait the freaking everyone has like some sort of highlight in her hair

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.480
Or should we pardon me? Sorry. Should we do block color?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Once

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.320
Say

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.800
No, well because her eyes are mixed her hair should actually be mixed. You know that

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.080
If I think because it would it would like a

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.920
Um

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.080
Complement her wee eyes more. Oh wait. No, she's supposed to be emotionless

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.320
There she's so emotionless and she's tired because you know

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.760
No

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760
Okay, I think we did it

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.160
She should have braces like a nerd. Okay, let's add the braces. Let's see. Let's get a little teeth shot from our little nerd

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:29.120
And just to really show the acts the colors like constantly switching back and forth

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.080
This one then this one then this one then this one then this one

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.600
And then we're going to yank this color right here

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.400
And then do this this this this and this is her teeth

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.920
And the braces just connect to one another like that

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.560
Yeah, that's how braces work right surely. I wouldn't know I'm brish

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.960
Okay, let me cook a lollipop armadillo girl who maybe has jewels on her armor

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.960
A contortionist girl since they can roll into balls

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.720
Gray as a primary color with perhaps orange and red

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.000
Loose clothes for aerodynamics a little shy, but not while performing

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.640
I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip tiny tiny

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I've seen armadillo. I don't know

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.880
Or a madillo and madillo and madillo. Let me just give her a neck again. Hold on a minute

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.600
It's timmy from south pot. No, right we need to give her a name

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720
What's her name going to be?

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.760
She does science, but it's unethical

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.760
So call her unni. Oh, and she's we as well. So we'd call her unni

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.000
because you know

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
she got the

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.280
For no particular reason at all her name tag is going to be right here

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.040
She's called unni because she's unethical

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.360
Oh, ne ne e like that unni and then

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.280
Some sort of science name

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:16.080
Uh another word for science, please internet. What do you see synonyms for science?

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.320
yep

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.960
art discipline education information learning skill system technique branch

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.520
Erudition lore

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.320
unni lore

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.360
Unni ology unni ology. Yeah

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.360
ology is the study of whatever the subject that comes before it. So like bi ology is the study of life

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.880
Chem ology. I'm just kidding. But that that's actually true. That's actually true what I said there, but chem ology doesn't work

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.840
So unni ology welcome in unni ology. I actually am not that mad at the design. I think that's really funny

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.720
You know, I'm sure someone else could cook a lot better with that, but yeah, come on unni ology

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:06.080
Her name is use lingo. Ah, yes. It means cousin unni one studied dark magic other studied medicine

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200
She specializes in sista

Hypothesis

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.200
She like loves coming up with them

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.200
She wants all the hypothesis and she wants to prove them there and then when they come into her jar jar banks

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840
Yeah

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.920
Mesa join and be sucky

Also, she needs to have large ears sharp teeth and thick thighs

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.160
Also for personality. She would be very mischievous

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.000
An orc a tribal orc that wants you. Okay. Let's let's check out the color palette

Color palette first, you know the drill. Oh wait, hold on. I need it. I need it big, right? Okay. Lollipop skinny Maliki

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.640
Thank you gaming kitsune for the suggestion

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.080
We're gonna do we're gonna have to change the skin right off the bat boom boom

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.640
And the ears start coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and I'm coming

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.360
And I'm coming and I can't stop coming. I'm addicted. Please. Please upload another audio, please

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.840
Okay. Um, no, I still needs to be a lighter. Oh my god. I can't believe I'm being

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.600
Come on. There we go. She's like, uh, the reason she's so tiny is because

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360
Because she's tiny, okay

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:40.960
If the girls were born to pander to you, what would she be? Um, I already picked what I wanted for gen two

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.680
I did not get what I wanted for gen two

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.720
um

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.240
Back and discuss it more at a later date right now

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.760
What I what I can't see my discoveries. Okay. Let's join her neck up. Okay, so

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.080
So lollipop goblino with big boobs

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.240
Okay

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:17.360
Oh that one was now. Don't worry. It's perfectly natural if one's bigger than the other but maybe not to that degree

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.440
Okay, it's kind of like oh why oh my god

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.720
I'm a real artist now because all I'm doing is controls Ian

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.520
Okay, but what

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.400
What should we uh, you know what I like I like when the design comes over like this

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.800
Can I put her in rags? Oh my god, please can I put her in rags? I love rags

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560
How do you draw rags?

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.800
I didn't think I would get this far. Hold on a minute

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.280
I want to know what's true anyone soon soon. No one would be revealed

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.560
uh

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.800
I'll show I'll show what I asked for and I'll show what I got basically what is going on in here

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.840
We're putting boobs on a lollipop

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.360
And I suck at it

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:13.200
But we're got we've got hicks and bacon. We've got uneology, which actually really like the idea of

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.680
unironically getting her developed

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.440
Uh, we've got jar jar binks the milk milk slime. Um, and then we're currently working on

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.840
A little tiny orc that loves to our word

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.200
There's no two ways about it. Did you give her a name? She likes to hunt. Okay, so she's into prey

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.640
Okay, she's into the prey. Was it prey play? Is that what you guys taught me like literally yesterday?

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.280
She's into prey play. Okay, not the amen. Okay, not the hot amen

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.400
That's supposed to be two hands together is not working

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.320
Pitcher plant lollipop that attracts pdf files and eats them

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.280
Oh

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:06.800
Gen two idea a hypnotic cuttlefish, but she loves slime girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No no miss. I see how it is. I see how it is

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.080
Uh, grembo. Thank you for the tip rags that barely cover

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.320
Okay, I like that hold on. I guess I do like a sideways thing so it covers like this

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.760
But then like that bit skin

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560
And it's all kind of like being pulled

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.040
Uh, no, I do like a picture plant idea. It's not the worst

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.200
But uh, maybe the attraction on is a bit of a oh, not sure we can really do that one chief

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:46.880
Uh, thank you for the suggestion on the left. Right. So this this is how it works, right? Surely this is how it works, right?

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.680
So in order to

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.360
What are you drawing? I don't know

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.040
I would have to go like that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.200
And then what I don't know. Well, just keep trying. Okay

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.920
Then that would have to be your skin

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:17.200
So then you need to you need a smaller line to symbolize that it's skin here. Oh

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.480
Sorry, I'm having to like talk myself through this process. Oh god, right

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.920
So if it's a single line, it shows that it's like a wee bit of skin, right? Okay. Yeah, that's fine

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.920
And then in order to compliment the green

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.800
Yes, we're actually going to do a paler brown

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.720
For the rags that should do it venus venus more like a penis fly trap

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.280
All right. Well, you as violers don't fucking V say so so

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240
Shit, what do you want?

01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.480
God, you guys are hard to impress even when I entertain you with a slain girl. It's still not enough for you. Is it?

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360
Shopping baby, okay

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.040
This is how it works truly, right? So this is clearly rags, right?

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.720
Clearly and then

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.240
God, I like how it extends over her freaking elbow. That's how big it is

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.000
And we'll do we'll leave in the under boob as well. That's a loop

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.000
Okay, and then you just kind of draw like that

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.920
How does that look from afar? Whoa, wait that actually looks kind of good

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:42.880
Am I I'm I just am I being delusional or does that actually look kind of good? I think I'm being delusional

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560
I think I need a good bed

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.880
I can't tell if I'm being delusional or if that kind of looks like a bit thingy

01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:01.840
Uh, strongy slain girls and goblins are top tier. Yeah, I'm like, is this delusion or is this actually kind of good? I don't know

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.080
That's probably just pure delusion. Right. Let's first get rid of these

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.440
Why?

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.120
Right first, it's a lot easier to just do this first instead of the backwards way that I just did it, but yeah

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.240
The boobs are a bit how dare you

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.120
How dare you this isn't you're watching

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.080
Uh top tier rated vtubers be be born

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.040
Birth from my loins. I'm just down it. Okay. So first thing you do this

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:37.280
What strongy? That's just your design. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know just give me a second to freaking catch up

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.160
If she's wearing rags, okay

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.560
It has to be like really sporadic because she's like tried her best to cover up

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.960
But she's not the smartest. Okay, so she's just kind of got things that are like pulling against her skin

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.520
in order to do this

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.920
um

01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.840
And

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.960
Oh, you know what fuck it. Why not?

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:06.320
We'll do have like a random knot in the middle because she had to like knot it in order to like hold them together

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.480
Because because that's how it works. Okay. She's trying her best. Be nice to her

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880
You've not even given her a name yet

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.160
Right, that's it reeflings name that are word goblin right now

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.920

I don't know what her name would be jumps a lot jumps

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.040
Jumps a cop jump

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.640
Okay, was it hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get up. Let me get up

jumps uh

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.600
cox

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.600
There that's her name jumps a cox

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.000
See this is why I should name because she would never get that you'd never get that jumps a cox. Okay

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:55.760
She's a noblin. Oh, yeah, you like that. We're gonna call her a noblin because she's a wee little

01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.560
Little bit lit in noblin there. Her nickname is noblin and her her her full legal name is jumps a cox

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.200
Nob goblin literally

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.600
Goblin my noblin

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:13.840
Right stop. I'm getting excited. I'm getting excited. Calm down. Calm down. Okay. There boom

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.920
Okay, so her rags are like tied up like that. She's tried her best

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.400
But she doesn't really care at the end of the day right

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.440
She would have dark markings to like compliment

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.160
Her thingy and they start lighting up them. We're excited she gets

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:38.960
And like all her symbols are like off like I don't know fertility or stuff. I don't know how this works. She'll have like loads of symbols

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.240
Maybe it's just be her veins. Honestly. It's probably just like her veins and stuff

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.360
So the more you see like her heart and stuff that's the more wait hearts on the left side a little bit

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.160
If that her left then it's the heart should kind of be on the side a bit more

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.680
There we go. That's the heart beautiful stunning gorgeous. Um

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.000
Can you like tribal tattoos? I don't I mean I get I just

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.400
And they just show up a bit more

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.120
Oh my tiny squid mirror

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.640
Get out of the kitchen. You might

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.920
No, what's wrong with the design

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:23.520
Oh garden rams. He says get out of the kitchen. What do you mean? You don't like my tribal design. Come on

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.640
You know how to draw tight. I don't even know what tribal freaking tattoos look like

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.720
There and she has like markings all over and got like one big one on her leg

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.600
And then this is the conception

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360
Hey

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.720
Um, and then we've got uh the wiggly

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440
The wiggly meets the egg

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.320
This is the ovum

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400
That's the ovum over

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.520
And that's the swimmer

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.480
And she's all about the uh, oh that's

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.320
I

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.680
I'm supposed to have to you know, just put one up there in the shop in there

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.240
She's keltic war paint. She's war paint on her face. Okay. Okay. I'll give her war paint

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:20.400
She's always ready to raid, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's like a war thing and she's like, um, always

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.240
Oh, shit. I'm covering this up. I'm always ready

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.040
to

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.040
And then in in big bold

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.720
That's her that's her little her mole

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840
I'm always ready to ride

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.680
Uh pray play. Yes. Yes. Yes jumps on you

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:48.240
She's really into breeding. She has to have a womb tattoo. Right. Okay fine. Ah little laughs

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.440
How does one

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:59.360
So in the oh, that's very large actually in the middle of her tattoo is the egg that you have to go for. Okay

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.520
um, but it's not going to be a love heart because

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:10.960
It's going to be an upside down love heart because it's not being conceived from love. It's been conceived from the

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:18.160
Alternative so that's these are clearly her little egg holders. They're her ovaries

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.400
um

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.560
and then she's got like a little pipe going on

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.200
and then

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.080
Just a few like little things that they should be creating vtuber freaking

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.080
Hmm

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.080
Uh, how you call them again, we'll do the little circle inside. That's the ovum. That's the egg waiting to be fertilized

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.000
Got all of science. It's so cool. Honestly. I mean, I think it's cool

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.080
Okay, there she's got a little womb tattoo as well

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.200
And then she's got like little swirls down here just because she can

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.800
Wait a minute. Mercy did swirls on my leg. I'm copying mercy. Uh

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.400
I'm really bad for that. My brain's just like, um, you've seen this once before so do it again. I was like, no

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.320
It's a little random markings. Why not? Oh, maybe she has scars

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.480
Oh my god, she would have like scars because people would try and fight her off

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.080
But she always wins in that end anyway, so there's no point in fighting her. Hold on

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600
She has like a teeth mark here

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.880
Yeah, there's like no point in fighting her like good luck. I honestly look like a smiley face

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:35.200
The the head and uh, thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate the support and she got like a big scar

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.160
That used to be an open cut up here, but it's not anymore

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.480
and then

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.600
uh, maybe a shoulder bite like uh coffin of andy and lele style

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.560
and then

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.320
Maybe on her finger because like someone like she went for someone and they weren't having it

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.680
But she managed to like not hurt herself

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.520
anywhere

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.680
Scars or tally marks does she have colored nails?

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.200
Sure

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840
Yeah

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.880
Okay, we need to give her her eyeballs. Oh my god, how do you translate her?

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.160
Design into an eyeball

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.160
Um

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:32.480
She would have teeth she would have like orc. Oh, sorry. She would have orc teeth, right? Surely surely she would have orc teeth

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.520
So she would have like the big teeth that come out here. I love them and orcs have the underbite teeth

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640
And then she like smiley. She's all happy

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.840
Okay, open your eyes, please so we can take a look at your eyeballs

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.400
Come

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.720
Okay, so what would your eyeballs actually be did I draw your eyeballs? No, I didn't

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.600
Yeah, let's draw it up here

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
Come. Oh, no, your hair is gonna be in the way

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.560
Okay, one big eyeball

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200
What would your design

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360
be

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.920
I feel like we've got what is an accent color to green and like tan

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.360
Brown, I mean she could have brown eyes

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.480
And maybe I put wee sandals on her so she can run after you and her wee flip flops

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.840
So as you're trying to run away from her all you hear is like

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:29.600
Over server freaking sandals honestly, that's hilarious. Like you can't get away. It doesn't matter how far

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.120
She's literally the like you can't it doesn't matter how far you run. She's like right behind you

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.080
Okay, she's gonna wear sandals. So it's got a little bit in between the tool here

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.720
How do sandals look when you're wearing them?

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.280
Ah, yes, I remember. Oh my gosh. I'm like a five-eyed

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.920
There so like and just just like behind you

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.000
Doesn't matter how far you run. She's she's right behind you

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.440
Little flip-flops little flip-flop gang flip

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.480
flop

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.560
Approaching sounds apperate. Oh arching

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.760
sounds

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.480
Mm-hmm

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
There we go flip-flop approaching sounds

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.480
Uh, I think she would actually maybe have brown eyes

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.280
Do we give her the old hex method where it's like brown in the middle and then tan on the outside

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.280
And then a darker brown

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.280
For the actual people what would the symbol be it has to be has to be an egg in an ovum

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.160
Thank you mama for the big asset lollipop. It's glorious

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.200
Big asset lollipop. Oh the thing

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:53.520
So this I'm wondering if we could secretly draw a little swimmer and her pupil

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.360
I think we could which is a little like from afar though

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.120
A bit shit, but honestly

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.200
Honestly, you went up high lolly. Is that what you want? Oh, no lollipop lollipop lollipop

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160
What did you do

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.520
I can't remember do you like

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.600
Okay, and then we're gonna draw

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.040
The egg in the ovum not the best pupils, but you know why we've done it

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.720
She looks like a freaking alien at this point. Okay

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.080
It's that's the egg and the little one thing going on and the we spare me wearing me

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280
Oh, this is awful. This is cursed

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.160
But vealer already has an r-word in goblin her name is joining as terrible

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.880
Refling journal supposed to say that I like right here

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.320
We are gonna have lovely luscious wavy brown hair like I'm talking hair down to the floor

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.480
I love when hair goes down to the floor

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.400
So we've got luscious bang. So let's do the bang

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.160
And then she has like this gorgeous

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.800
hair that

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.520
Oh, maybe it should like rest on the bosom a little bit on her fondle of bosoms

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.760
But then it keeps oh, no, that doesn't work

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.960
Well, the back of the hair can definitely go like all the way of the back. That's fine with me

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.840
Maybe it just comes to us like uh in the middle

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.400
Like predator style like it just all comes down

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.200
Leave her bald don't say such things we put so much love into her

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.720
Okay, we definitely need to deal with her mouth though. I don't I don't want to be rude

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.120
But your mouth is starting to worry me a little bit

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.600
Okay, and then we'll just kind of have a little accent pieces here

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.800
And then we can remove this part because this is where it looks really weird

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And then can we

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.640
Maybe do this close enough. Uh, right. Let's try that again. We'll see what is the

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
Impeding ours

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.520
Uh color wise

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.520
What is

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.320
Ah, this bit here we go. I got it. Are you squid me right now?

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:39.200
Something every girl has a straight bangs. I sense some of my house leave my straight bangs out of this

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.920
I'll love my straight bangs. Okay. Hmm. Oh wait. Do they actually all have straight bangs? No

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.160
frickin

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.600
uneology

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
Hazard things pinned back get wreck

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.720
Anonymous, how do you say such things to me anonymous? I'm gonna fart on your eyelashes

01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:01.280
Stony you gave her hair, but you just let it flow down. Are you confirming that you're no

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:08.720
I I don't I don't it's not me. I promise. I'm designing something here. It's not me

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.840
It's me

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.840
Me

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:21.200
Why did you space out that here? Let's just close all the gap. Don't mind us close gap. Boom. No, let's try again

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440
What is open here?

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.800
This

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:29.440
Is it that be honest? Was it that? Is that the reason why it's not closed? Boom. Are you?

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.720
Am I being squitted on I'm being squitted on by ms pain. Are you what are you doing ms pain everything else is blocked off

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.960
I can see everything else is blocked off

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:46.880
Come on. Oh, there is sorry. That was really obvious

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.160
There we go, she's got two different. Yeah. Yeah, fuck it right here. How's a gradient? Why not get darker at the bottom?

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.440
He he he I guide it. Okay, and then

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:04.160
for the mouse let's maybe relax a bit on it and

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.760
We will make it a slightly less intimidating

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:12.000
Uh, maybe just one odd tooth. Why not?

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.280
And then she's all smiley and sweet, but it's because she's secretly about to do something very bad

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.640
Uh, and she's all she's like a little sweetheart and you're like, oh this orc

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:30.080
I don't know why orcs have such a bad reputation. Seriously. Why do people hate them so much?

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.920
And then little do you know what's about to come next?

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.880
Oh, yeah, we did it. We did the design. So now

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.000
We have one more design and then we're done. So

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.080
Hmm what we think and not gonna let her go feral

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.000
Oh, they have long ears. How could I forget? She needs her long side late ears. Hold on. Hold on. Let me add the ears real quick

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.080
And this is jumps on. Yeah

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.480
Oh

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:04.400
Why am I born like this? Okay. She has adorable little ears that come out from this side

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.880
Like this like these kind of ears

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.080
Ta-da, all done

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.960
You what orc or goblin? I don't know one or the other. Are you squid me? Noblin if you if you prefer

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.480
Red black gold color scheme discord kitten girl. Red black and gold. Why not?

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.200
We don't have a red

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.200
We have avoided red for some reason

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:36.480
Right red black and gold black and gold wasn't that song when a fish swims out of the ocean

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.800
And the legs they start as walking

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.760
Oh

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.600
Red black and gold discord kitten

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.720
Ray

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:12.720
We've just made belgium. So she's belgium for one 10 out of 10 would let the gobby. Oh my god, her nickname would so be gobby

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.200
Gobby

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.640
Oh, yeah

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.880
I think what is she singing you know how it's like when the fish swim out in the ocean

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:33.360
And legs they started when the fish swam out of the ocean

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.240
What is you what does google say?

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:41.920
Oh, it's called the song is called black and gold. Yeah, no wonder. Okay. Are you ready for the lyrics?

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.920
I'm gonna sing it because I don't want to copyright

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.720
Oh, wait, hold on. I need to mute the background music just to really not confuse you

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.920
When if the fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they started walking

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:03.040
And the apes climbed down from the trees and grew a tail and they started talking

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.320
And the stars fell out of the sky

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.920
And the tears rolled into the ocean

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:17.040
And now i'm looking for a reason why you even set my world in emotion

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Ka-mmm

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.320
Because if you're not really here, I don't remember this though. Where's the black and gold part? Here we go

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.880
I want to be next to you

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.680
black and gold

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.520
black and gold

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.280
black and gold

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.320
That's it

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.000
But there was a song it goes like that just tape it and i'm gonna no copyright

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.480
I'm gonna have the most delirious sleep of my life. I'm gonna wake up tomorrow not remember. I did any of this

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040
Because I haven't slept in like how long?

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.720
quite well

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.080
I'm gonna have any recollection that I designed any of these so it'll be a nice surprise to wake up to

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.080
Do you have a backstory idea? Wait, what was it? I don't even remember what the question was

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.960
Discord kitten someone said discord kitten. Okay, right this this

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.240
P Y R D K

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.640
Y K I N

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.720
There we go. Spell it like that just i'm feeling feeling quirky

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:25.360
So i'm gonna spell it like that no stroney the goblin is singing this no matter how fast no matter how far you can always hear

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.640
The squeaking behind the lollipop goblin is coming to town

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.200
lollipop

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:32.400
goblin

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.400
Are you squiddling me around?

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.720
I've left goblin a gob on my knob with all without permission

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.680
Gob on my knob schlob on my cob

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.840
Norn on the cob and she give me hay right on the bay

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.520
Check in with me and do your job right you what are you you're a discord kitten?

01:37:53.680 --> 01:38:00.240
Obviously you need the headset or else it's not complete. How can you be the stereotype and you need braces?

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.640
Get braces right automatically. She's disqualified from being british. So unfortunately it is what it is

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.200
We will give her red and gold braces because we can't

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.440
Oh

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.440
That's what

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:26.240
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Get braces get braced on get braced on i'm getting braced getting braced. That's right

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.440
And then she's got a big old she's got a big old smile

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.040
Because she likes to show off. She's got braces. She's so mature for her age

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.560
Why am I grooming her? She's not even real

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:44.400
There just just smile and there i'm just gonna put erratic dots in your teeth. Okay

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.720
It looks like you've got like red chili peppers stuck or something

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.960
okay

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.480
Yo, is that the flag of belgium unironically though, but how will she?

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.600
with braces

01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.400
Because she can right if she's a discord kitten. What eyeball are we giving you?

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.040
Come on. Let's get that pupil design. Let's milk that pupil design for everything move go

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Right if you're a discord kitten

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.520
What's the discord symbol look like? Hold on let me look it up. What does discord symbol look like?

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.280
Image

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:28.720
Okay, the discord symbol right so first do a circle because we need it to be in the circle

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.720
Okay, the circle is gonna wear the headset but in say the circle is the discord

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.120
Who goes there?

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:44.720
Big black cat ears and tail actual cat girl not just headphones gimmick make her very desperate for love and attention

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880
But a real gamer girl veteran

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.760
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There we go. So that's her pupil

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.640
uh

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.800
I would have to be red though

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.400
Right, you want a real neko real neko. So let's get rid of this

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.440
Mmm, and you want a real tail. I can definitely do that. Let's give her black

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
um

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.560
Thingy so she's got a lovely tail

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:18.480
No, that looks like a dinosaur or something

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.920
No, don't get skinny

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.080
Oh, it's your boy

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.800
Yeah, we go she's got a little tail and has a little Brenda then she's so happy to see you

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:37.440
Dollar signs from all the sugar daddies cat girls speaking of a cat girl. You'll never guess what Fu is

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.280
Fu is sometimes gets referred to as not a neko

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
This is not fun for Fu

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.560
But she is a nekodese

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.840
What color though red red eye seems like really intense, but

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.080
I think it's gonna have to be

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:01.760
Unless we do like something really weird like that. That's the weirdest pupils. I think we're drawing. It looks like a pig's nose

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640
I understand now why you said pig

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.800
I didn't understand. She's gonna need a you blue shirt, honestly

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.400
I'm gonna have to redesign that pupil a little bit or it's just gonna have to be like one shade of red

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.880
Well, not one shade like I'll make it later

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.680
Oh

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.160
That's even more like a pig. Who's thought right? How have I done a 3d pig? That's honestly such a good like pig

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.240
Right, it's not working

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.640
The pupil is just gonna have to have neko ears. There's no other way about it

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.800
The pupil is having neko ears. Did I make myself clear?

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.080
Okay, so pupil

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.760
Neko ears. Oh, this looks even worse

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.760
Oh brother, it's probably the best I've got

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:58.400
It's not very good up next the pig girl. No, no pig. Go right. Okay. She's got a tail

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.160
Next we need to do her hair

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.080
um

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.640
If she's a neat do we cover up her feet like her eyes

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880
Oh

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.440
She looks like

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.840
Or something like one of the characters from there

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.680
Oh, right. I need to get rid of the teeth. I'm so sorry. They're completely throwing me off

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.760
They need to go. You got to go buddy. What do you mean? You have to go

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.640
I can't handle you

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.960
Wow

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.200
Right you do you you you you

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.560
And then draw a circle

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.480
Circle and then draw the cat ears and then and so that's just it looks like a freaking bunny rabbit head. Do you know that?

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.840
Only once I discovered I think sometimes her love for stylistic pupils make cause issues

01:42:54.880 --> 01:43:00.080
Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it? And she's like, uh, she's like, uh, wait, how do you draw a hegeo face?

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.080
I hate you

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:08.400
Okay, and she's got her mouth open and it's like her tongue is it? What the fuck? How do you know this?

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.280
Someone stick their tongue out right now so I can use it as a reference

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.560
Oh, this is awful

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.400
Why is a hegeo so hard to draw? Who did this?

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.360
Why is it sideways? Right straightforward tongue, please. Thank you. And then

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.320
What why hello? Why is it so hard to draw? I literally have a reference right in front of me

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.800
right

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.800
First stick the tongue out

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.960
Okay

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.560
I'm literally right that's supposed to be the tongue wait. I've not done the mouth yet

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.240
And then the mouth is like a dark opening above it. Okay

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.320
Do that

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.640
And then color in the tongue. Okay there now you can tell that I'm trying to go for it

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.200
Jeez that was like way harder than it had to be

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.080
Okay, we did it we've done the face out of all the faces. There's a

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.920
Okay, go away jar jar slime

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:17.680
We've had enough of your shenanigans right here next a discord kitten always has long hair. Okay

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.800
But because she's doing a hegeo her little ears would be down so first

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.480
Long hair would we do like

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.400
Something I feel like she has to have something

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.200
I mean we'll put a bow in her hair just to make her slightly different. What's that bangs again?

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:43.760
Absolutely. No, let's give her a side swoop. Why not? A little emo cat thing going on

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.640
Wow

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.160
Okay, there we go

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.120
And then we'll put a little bow in her hair right here

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.640
A little jingle bell because you know how cats like those little bell things always get sold to them

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:01.120
My tongue is ready for you strongy. Thank you. I will draw it right now briefly

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.840
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.360
Uh her hair is not going to be her hair is going to be long, but it's not going to be that long

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360
And it's actually going to be a blunt cut

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.080
um

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.440
Because we don't want it to be

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:25.120
Not a blunt cut. Yep. Okay. I mean that's explanation enough and all honestly

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:31.440
You don't really have to go further than that and then we do a little hair thing here to mesh it a bit better

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.600
And then we introduce her ears which are pressed

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.400
Our ears up here and a cat. Yeah, okay

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.760
If the ears are up there the ears like bunch out like up here

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.560
And they're kind of like downwards because she's doing a hegeo. So it's supposed to be like

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.360
You know, I mean like this ear is getting completely hidden by this accessory

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:59.120
Who put the accessory right there? I don't know. It wasn't me, but someone did put it there and they should be embarrassed

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.440
If she's a big weeb maybe mess up the hair

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320
Like this

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:12.880
There she's a still got a blunt cut, but it's only blunt because

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:18.080
She just doesn't go get it cut at all and doesn't maintain it whatsoever

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.800
Okay, and then if we copy that and we can paste it on the neck and we can do that

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:31.440
Well, maybe let's not color in her eyeballs. That would look rather odd. I oh are you squiddin me right now?

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.440
By the pope identify yourself

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:39.760
Suggestions tongue piercing bondage restraint on her tail that matches her choker on her neck

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.480
Short nails painted gold or black side swept short black hair

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:51.280
Gold jewelry to compliment her black slash red lounge wear outfit. Give her a giant fish plushie

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320
Fish plushie. Fish plushie

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.920
Thank you for the

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.800
tip

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.360
Again Raven. Thank you

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.160
I I'm gonna be honest. My brain's starting to shut down. I'm I am now working against the clock before my brain stops talking

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.960
Um, uh, we are under the clock. I repeat rooflings. We are under the motherfucker clock

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:20.880
I don't want to fall asleep, but I think I might fall asleep, but I don't want to fall asleep on stream

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.520
That's not a nice

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.920
Black please. Thank you. She's got black ears

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:33.520
Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Just give her black ears because she's a nickel

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.440
And she's from belgium and and her catchphrase is

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.720
I can't remember how to spell dutch

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.240
I've completely forgotten how to spell in dutch

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.240
But she's fucking belgium

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.160
Um, I'm trying. I'm trying. Oh my god. We're against the clock. Okay

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:06.960
We need a light pink for the inner colors of her ear holes because we don't want her to not have light pink because

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.280
That's like humanizing her

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.560
You and I need to I'm trying to sleep somewhere. Congrats on 12k. I'm not at 12k. I just hit 11k. I know that for a fact

01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.320
I'm not at 12k. Okay. Her hair is going to be a light brown

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.320
Can I do it? No. Okay. Well, I tried. Uh, let's try that again

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.040
Let's close off the gaps so we can get a nice light brown going on close

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.000
Closing the gaps closing the gaps

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:36.880
Looking for gaps looking for gaps. We're gonna do a light brown

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.680
I yet

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.720
Okay, there we go. There we go. There we go. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.520
Okay, okay. Let's let's put her together put her together put her together right

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.560
She has a tail. The tail is black

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.760
Um

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.840
But on the end of the tail she has the same bail. Oh, that looks like a pokemon. What's that pokemon's name?

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.040
It's not chingling. It's the other one

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.520
Oh, there's a pokemon that looks like it's that and it's not got that name

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.760
But it looks like what i've just drawn. I think i'm drawing pokemon from memory. I'm so sorry

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:21.360
Actually, I should do an msp drawn pokemon from memory. That would be insane. That's right

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
And then the elastic band

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.200
It would technically be black, but i'm gonna have to use red because I don't have anything else

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.880
And then the choker has the exact same

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.400
Like vibe

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.560
What's the pokemon chain chero? I think it's chain chero

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.440
There we go

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:50.720
I mean, yeah, like technically that band would be black and then this would be black. How do you symbolize it?

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.720
I guess gray symbolize it. We're gray

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.400
um

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400
For the actual outfit

01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:00.240
Body restraints on her tail that match her choker short nails

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040
That are gold. I can do that

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.760
Boop boop

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.920
Um

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:17.280
Jewelry, I don't know cats like shiny things. No cats aren't man. Give her a giant fish

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.360
She likes she's got a little fish plushie. I know you said giant

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.800
But I actually like the idea that she's always got a fish stuffy on her because she's scared to go alone

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:31.120
Because her lore is that she was abandoned

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:39.040
And then she always wants a fishy to hold close because fishy were her only companions. No, she's not vegetarian

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.920
Just really gotta get in that real quick. No, she's not vegetarian. What would you wear though?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.880
If you're a discord kitten you wear like next to nothing

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.680
I feel like you'd be in a spaghetti strap like crop top thing going on

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.080
Or maybe it would be like super stylized and she's got like

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.400
Bulging out the side, but she wouldn't have anything shown. You know, I mean

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:11.200
But I'd be like how does that shirt even work? Oh, I mean, I guess it would work if it went around the side like that

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.160
So technically this is her skin

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:19.760
Hold on. Let me zoom in. Let me enolize that's right. Hold on

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.840
If I want to pull off what I want to pull off first. I must color it all in

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.800
Okay, first color it in

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.280
color color color color color color

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.040
And then we redraw it with a thin black line. That's how art works. Okay, it just works

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.160
Not now Todd Howard. I need to go to bed

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:47.760
But it just works. No, Todd Howard. Stop it. Please change. Okay, so this is technically

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.600
You know what right

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.720
And then the actual shirt

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.560
Oh god, I forgot what the Belgian flag looks like. Hold on. It'll bell gian flag. Oh god, I cannot spell all

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:09.120
I'm falling asleep on stream and I don't want to please brain. Give me like give me five more minutes

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.080
Just give me one more chance

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:21.760
Thank you, that is my rendition of that one Japanese song that I have absolutely no idea what it's about

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.640
It just goes nowhere. The song has an English line and it just goes

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.200
Just give me one more chance

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.040
You know what song I'm on a bit, right?

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.600
You know what song I'm on a bit?

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.600
Surely surely copium

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.720
Okay, does that make sense what we're looking at here if I zoom out does it make more sense?

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:53.120
Yeah, yeah, it makes sense. Okay next shorts

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:59.360
No shorts, uh, all right you you

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:03.680
Can't put window or you want a window

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880
I don't do that do skin color

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240
And then draw

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.120
The shape

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.600
Go Belgium forever

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.360
Why else do I know about Belgium? Oh, that's her catchphrase

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:22.720
She wants she wants mayonnaise

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.120
Belgians and she wants your mail. Okay, because Belgians put mail on fries or chips

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.880
Or deep-fried potato. I don't know what you want to call it

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.800
But that's what they do and but the mail is her version of ink

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:44.320
Wait, is she Belgian? Yeah, we made her Belgian as fuck

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.360
She's a whole hat with the all you know

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:52.480
And she wants to watch new kids turbo with you. She's like so out the wazoo

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.040
New kids turbo

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.200
New kids

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.760
Turbo

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:15.120

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.960
You're welcome

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560
That's okay

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:26.720
Come on brain

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:30.880

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.960
You're fine. The design is there. Just get it out. Just get it out

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.840
Just get it out

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.840
Come on

You know what to do brain. You know what to do with a

bird

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.640
wiggle wiggle wiggle

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:56.400
P. O. V. I am a pigeon that wants to meet with you

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:04.400
Right, what do we want to do? I've already forgotten what I was gonna do. Um

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:08.400
Let's give her a make cruel

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.120
Tongue

And let's do a little bit of red

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:30.160
And then oh, that's not even the spread though. It needs to be even or else. It doesn't look good right black

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.440
yellow

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.840

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.320
Okay, there we go

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.160

High snowberries and daddas alike. I hope you guys are doing well. We're currently designing gen 2

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:32.960
We are doing the last design

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:36.160
Believe it or not. I've actually smoked this

01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:43.520
But why not I take you through memory lane of what we've done just to recap really quickly

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.960

Thank you fargon miss for the tip. Um, I'm glad you'd go for it. Um, she's on the booger sugar

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:32.000
She's following Freud's footsteps. Um, and she does unethical unethical testing on you and her pupil is a

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.120
DNA deoxy ribonucleic acid little helix double helix

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.800

And then we have our beloved

Which is an egg an ovum and a little swimmer going inside. Um, her color scheme is

Uh, brown tan and green. I'm actually just gonna steal her hair right now and pop it in that box

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.800
Um, her nickname is gobby. Um, but her actual legal name on a piece of paper

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.920
I'm a spell Freud wrong. Uh, her legal name on a piece of paper is jumps a cox

Um, or noblin. Um, and her catchphrase is i'm always ready to ride

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.040
She's a little r wordy. So not very, uh, not very

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.040
Good to go, but she does have a womb tattoo. Um, it's an upside down heart

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.040
There's no actual heart in her womb tattoo because it's not always

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.680
Uh, you didn't always want that

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.040
um

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:55.280
Ignore the fact that aces hair is hiding right on top of her. She's got one tooth and she looks very

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Um, nice

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.360
She looks very friendly and approachable, but uh, unfortunately that is not the reality once you actually get to know her because it's over for you

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.720
Um, her markings on her body again

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.280
She has markings that glow the more excited she get the more noticeable the markings are

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:16.800
Um, she has an ovum on her leg and she has a little swimmer

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:23.040
Um, and then she has the egg egg and then a very unique symbol that has never been done in history before very true very true

02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:25.520
and she has sandals

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.120
Um, and uh, even though you may try and get away from her

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:35.040
You will always hear the sound of flip-flops approaching you doesn't really matter. Uh, what uh, necessary

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.680
stage we're at. Um

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.840
But her hair is a lighter brown on top and a gradient to a darker brown

02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.240
And her clothing is rags that she put together because she doesn't really see the need for clothes. So there you go

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.280
um

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.520
And then we are working on the last design, which is our

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.200
discord kitten. Uh, she's belgian

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.760
Um, her pupils are like a head with nickel ears and then a pupil like an actual pupil

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.880
She has braces, but I had to remove it because she's doing the hegeo face

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:12.880
um

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.160
And she's got like a little side thing going on

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.600
And a little window that you can see actually I've not drawn the line. Oh, how could I forget the line?

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.400
Let's zoom right back in there. What do I think I'm doing?

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.280
Oh

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:29.280
six just like that

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:31.280
um

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:33.360
And then she's holding a fishy

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.960
Oh, sorry. Um, her tails. Oh, sorry and her tails got like the little

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:45.680
Um, pokemon on it. The pokemon's in her hair and we are just finishing off her legs and then we're done really

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.560
I think she be actually might be alive

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.280
Um, perfect timing

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:54.320
Perfect timing if you ask me

02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.560
We're just gonna finish off her

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.120
Leggies because she's wearing she's really repping belgium. She she just loves her home country

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:06.080
Her catchphrase is male if you didn't know belgian people eat mayonnaise with chips

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:12.640
Um, and she wants your mayonnaise for her chips wink wink, uh, and that is her that's her story

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:18.160
Uh, she's sticking to it. She's not changing it, but she has a discord e can a discord

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.200
E girl at the end of the day. So, uh

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Do with that information what you will

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.000
Sheepers is later tonight. Oh, no, I don't have anyone to read all right into

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.640
And then we go yellow

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.760
And then red and yellow

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.360
Unfortunately, I didn't get much sleep. So I don't my brain's actually shutting down right now

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.680
I can feel it. Um, I am gonna have a big sleep after stream, which I'm very happy about

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.000
Because I've been needing it. Um, I do have an update for bleeding hearts. Your audio will come out

02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:01.840
When I wake up. It's already there. I just need to upload it. Um, it got edited

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:08.800
Thankfully not by me. I didn't have to do it, but I do have to edit my reef link one. Why is one leg?

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:12.800
Stalking getting longer than the other. What have I done here?

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:19.120
Um, yes, so for any bleeding hearts when I wake up, I need to sleep. I know. Oh, it's so quick and

Um

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.640
Yeah, you should redirect to strong here. She's doing a sleep stream

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.080
Bruh, if I didn't fart, I'd be doing so many sleep streams. You'd be sick of me

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.960
You'd honestly be sick of me

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.800
I'd be snoring away

02:05:53.440 --> 02:06:00.400
Oh, no, she's like a bumblebee now sweet little bumblebee. Oh math. Thank you for why is your picture the

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:07.280
Venn diagram thing. Thank you math for the again tiff the mem. Wow. Why 10 gifted members?

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:11.280
I really struggle with it that those word combinations

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.880
Thank you math for the 10 gifted sub script

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:19.520
Memberships congrats to those who caught it with your face. Um

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.880
Why is your thing the Fibonacci sequence?

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.080
I'm so curious

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:28.320
No, we let do it braffin up his thorn

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:34.480
That'd be real funny. Nice. Yes. We haven't heard. Oh my emotions are about to come

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:40.160
I'm just waiting for them to actually send me the files now. Her toes are sadly going to be covered up

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:42.400
It's a sacrifice. I'm willing to make okay

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360
Are you squinting me right now?

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:48.720
Do do them. We don't mind the two. I am not

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:54.560
I say that as if Amy didn't send me clips of her farting so we can turn them into shorts

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:58.720
Honestly, it may is such a good sport. I was like explaining to the girls

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:03.040
I was like if you have her fart on stream, please let me know so I can turn it into shorts

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.320
Because it always gets popular for like no reason

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:09.440
I get super popular

02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:16.560
So I'm literally sent away a highlight clip of me forcing out a fart. She was trying so hard. I was like, yeah, dang

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.240
And then the toes are going to be red. Oh

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:23.280
We did it

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:26.000
Jane too has been confirmed

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:33.040
Look at our little belgian discord kitten thing. Yay

02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:40.560
Fart a little golden ratio. Vendai, aren't true socks that show toes and the ball with the foot. That's just a zura

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.760
Yui did it. Yeah, I suppose people find it even

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.400
Fart is when you melt

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.160
honestly

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.320
Thank you again for the game. Diff the member

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:59.840
Why can I not say 10 gifted memberships? Thank you math 16 18 for that again. That's where it kind of you

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.960
Uh

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.440

We've got jumpsacock

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:22.160
Oh, we did we give kids discord kitten a name?

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.440
Maybe we'll just call her kitten like spell it like that kitten kitten

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.880
And then we've got slimy slimy ghee

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:33.440

I think I mean she's shutting down. I'm shutting down

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:41.840
I mean, it's all right. Uh, I would probably be

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.640
If I had to pick my favorite

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.360
I actually like

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:49.760
Who'd I like the most?

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.080
Lower wise. I like the goblin

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.360
Um

02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.280
Design wise the most potentials probably uniology

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.320
kitten kaboot

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:10.240
Call the gen pintus because it was in gen two and chase honestly

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:15.760
Suicide freak score gen one a lure implies you have a choice

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:20.400
Let's name a gen two oblige because you don't have a choice gen two freaky

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.120
Personally attacked by the thumbnail

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:25.200
Stop

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.480
I'm freaking

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:33.680
Look, I had to draw a slime girl and it accidentally makes jar jar binks as a freaking slime girl was terrible

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.600
but this is

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600
This is gen two

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:43.920
It's quite an interesting lineup. We've got going on after admit you would like the goblin. Yeah

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:46.720
Maybe I would I made her myself

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:50.960
The goblin's actually just me for real for real. Maybe remove the chest

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.600
Everything else. Yeah, sure. I'll take it

02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:01.520
Wait if on the Belgian girl get her stockings warmer toes in their feet shape toes and have toes on

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.800
Why are you I'm too tired to even translate what you've just tried to communicate to me gen two

02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:13.440
I'm sorry. She will never be slimed didn't the thumbnail say no slim girl jar jar slime basically

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.800
Yes, the thumbnail said no slime girls. I was gonna get harassed. So we made one

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.840
I made the ugliest slime girl imaginable. So you'll stop asking for a slime girl. We're not getting a slime girl

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.600
The goblin is really good. Yeah, you like the concept of the goblin. Yeah

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.360
