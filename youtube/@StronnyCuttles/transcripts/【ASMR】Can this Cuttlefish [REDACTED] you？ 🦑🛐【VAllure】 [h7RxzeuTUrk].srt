1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello, are you there?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Can you hear this little goldfish?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm cooking, cooking.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So professional, so professional.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My cats are currently play-fighting.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wait, have I spelled permanent wrong?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not dead.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if you hear bumpin' about, my cats are going absolutely wild.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now today is a very short stream.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I should really sound like this for you.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Good evening.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And good afternoon.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have lots of fun things to try.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I need to make myself louder or lower the background sound.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So don't worry, you're in good condition.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hi.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Have I spelled permanent but irrelevant?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now you all know.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Make it permanent.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Have to miss this stream, it's okay.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're going nice and slow.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't normally use these eyes, but I can't help it.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It was always permanent.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can never hear my cats run behind my couch.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, there she goes.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, and she's...

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But take your time to relax.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Of course, she's been so good.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Literally, she's beaten up V-core right now, but it's okay.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And that's okay.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just like that feeling, come over here.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No reflex, don't let go.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh no, is this ear broken?

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Is this ear broken?

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hello?

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh my gosh.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Both ears work.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I just said right into your ear.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The ear works, but as less equal, I would not be of anything equal.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's such a professional stream there.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, I should say correct.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay if it's weaker.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I like them weak.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's the best part?

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hello?

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's the best part?

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's the best part?

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry, I did it twice, I have to make twice.

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm just going to brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security.

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
As I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Not one single thing.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And we get to go down into the depths together.

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just me and you and my voice and you listening in.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, gently brushing over your ears.

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And some cats.

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, maybe the cats do.

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wow.

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Gentle, gentle movements.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have some good news for my reflinks.

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, the heat just came on.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm so professional, let's go.

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come on, it was me, I won't get a loss being professional, it's me.

79
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When can I start being myself?

80
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Or do I need to keep being professional?

81
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The cat turned the heat on because it wants attention.

82
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, give me five more minutes and I'll be serious, okay?

83
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The noise is encapsulating you.

84
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And you feel may have a sense of belonging.

85
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

86
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I gave up control, control to one particular girl.

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And it wouldn't be so bad.

88
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The worst that could happen from this little gullfish.

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is there a cat in my room?

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No.

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:11,000
As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be under?

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or could be done in 24 little hours?

95
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No much harm at all.

96
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So slowly your mate wonders, what would this gullfish ask me to do?

97
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Only a few things, my dear refling.

98
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Some things can't be said, only guessed.

99
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You have to go into deeper parts of your mind to know and realize what this gullfish wants.

100
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.

101
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Would that be so bad?

102
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No.

103
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So maybe that 24 hours becomes 48 and then 48 becomes 72.

104
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.

105
00:13:34,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish mate breaks you.

106
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's just my things that I want.

107
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But you have to earn the things you want.

108
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I need to bathe, don't I?

109
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I need to do the right things.

110
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?

111
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.

112
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.

113
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?

114
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

115
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's see how much we can bathe together.

116
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's be on our best behavior then.

117
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.

118
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll allow you, refling, to take sentences you want me to say in chat right now.

119
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.

120
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Does that sound like a plan?

121
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I'd love to do that for you.

122
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Gain your favor, huh?

123
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Say bye, means couple fish in Italian.

124
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hi, honey.

125
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All lay on the reef.

126
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're such a believable little thing, aren't ya?

127
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?

128
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I love you, refling.

129
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm proud of you.

130
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm proud of us.

131
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.

132
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?

133
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're not gonna lose to me.

134
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.

135
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You have to make me work for it, refling.

136
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You do less work really, really hard.

137
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Here we go.

138
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You can look in my eyes.

139
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Just done the spiral.

140
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you like looking into my eyes?

141
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I think they're rather dandelizing, don't ya?

142
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can make my eyes open wide like this.

143
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Staring right at you.

144
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I see you.

145
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you see me.

146
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And you see everything I'm doing to you.

147
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right at this very second.

148
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's okay.

149
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can blink.

150
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But don't look away for too long.

151
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Remember, we have to behave for one another.

152
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Do you like that?

153
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently.

154
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're more welcome.

155
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're more than welcome to blink and sink.

156
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I quite like that phrase, blink and sink.

157
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.

158
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And if your mind starts to wander, that's okay.

159
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You may even see little reeflings.

160
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's by design.

161
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

162
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know.

163
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.

164
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Maybe you don't want to fade back.

165
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Not like you could by the time I'm done with you.

166
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
My little reefling, why don't you come a little bit closer?

167
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I promise I won't pay, no.

168
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In fact, you may like what you faint as you go deeper and deeper with me.

169
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Deeper and deeper your thoughts are turning to confusion.

170
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What did you say?

171
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With only my voice remaining in your head,

172
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this luring cuttlefish is saying.

173
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There, there.

174
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just look at me and forget.

175
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
All you need to know, reefling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.

176
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And by the time I'm finished with you, you'll already want to be going under again.

177
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Your little reefling.

178
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll give you a tingle break, okay?

179
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll say more phrases shortly, but have a little break, break, break, break.

180
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We need to take things slow.

181
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Think of it as an introduction to your induction.

182
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But please don't worry.

183
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There will be no permanent effects in this dream.

184
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.

185
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

186
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.

187
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

188
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you for the deep little reefling.

189
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?

190
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly make you.

191
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This is one of many, okay?

192
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.

193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because I'm coming for you.

194
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you understand?

195
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I will get you.

196
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That is my goal.

197
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And have I failed any of my goals so far?

198
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No little reefling.

199
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So heed my warning.

200
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I am coming.

201
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Relax.

202
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If you think my words are waking you up,

203
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they should be slowly bringing you down.

204
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Down, down, down, okay?

205
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's why we need a little tamer.

206
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Where we just listen in.

207
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And whatever our brain and body decides will do.

208
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.

209
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah.

210
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Just let whatever happens happen.

211
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I won't be bidding you purposefully in a trance, okay?

212
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But if you just happen to be so well-drained,

213
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I welcome it entirely.

214
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I welcome my voice and encapsulating your mind.

215
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I welcome your full attention.

216
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So be good, little reefling.

217
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And don't keep me waiting.

218
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You might feel it starting from your head.

219
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And slowly a sensation radiates downwards.

220
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Down to your neck, then your shoulders.

221
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And that sensation splits off.

222
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.

223
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.

224
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Turn your stomach.

225
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Down, down, down.

226
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And past your hips.

227
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.

228
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.

229
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Until that sensation is all over.

230
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.

231
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because the sensation is pleasant.

232
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's warm.

233
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It feels comforting.

234
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.

235
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I will do the talking for the both of us.

236
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.

237
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's nice when I'm in control.

238
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's nice when you let me in control.

239
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Enjoy the feeling, okay?

240
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Enjoy the sensation.

241
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We're both doing it together, aren't we?

242
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

243
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, good.

244
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For you.

245
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Are your limbs feeling heavy?

246
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's okay, little reef-like, that's just a side effect.

247
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But over time, you'll may enjoy it.

248
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.

249
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
As in control.

250
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?

251
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, little reef-like.

252
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
For you.

253
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Very you, little reef-like.

254
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is all by your choice.

255
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?

256
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Or are you strong enough to give me some braces you want to hear?

257
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you think you could do that for me, little reef-like?

258
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.

259
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I'm ready to obey you.

260
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're doing such a good job.

261
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef-like.

262
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Back and forth.

263
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ear to ear.

264
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah.

265
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You did good today, and I can see how hard you're working.

266
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well done, little reef-like.

267
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well done.

268
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.

269
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Together we'll have lots of fun.

270
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just surrender and let me take control.

271
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
My little reef-like.

272
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

273
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You always do, don't you?

274
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

275
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You always do, don't you?

276
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And I'll be there on the other side, cheering you on.

277
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh, my little reef-like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?

278
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, you're so heavy and so deep, and so happy to give yourself to me.

279
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Resistance is futile at this point.

280
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Just give in, give up.

281
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.

282
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
One way or another, you are main.

283
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Got it?

284
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay, let's relax, relax, relax, relax.

285
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There we go.

286
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll bring you back up a little.

287
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't want you guys to get so deep now.

288
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.

289
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll do some more little tingles.

290
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, my reef-links.

291
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't know if I should bring you back up, or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one.

292
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You want to go a little deeper?

293
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I need to be gentle with you, though.

294
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't you see?

295
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've had so much time to think of how hard I was gonna...

296
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What's the word, eh?

297
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How hard I was gonna go on you, and I need to be able to not break you.

298
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't want to break you, no more.

299
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want to make you break you, but that takes time.

300
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We just need to spend a little more time together, and my stomach is making nice as I root.

301
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back done even better.

302
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Please, oh, bring you guys.

303
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, just relax and let loose all of those burdens.

304
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.

305
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And I'll caress all over you, look after you.

306
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I can only say the right stuff.

307
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Over reef-links.

308
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.

309
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And just take your time, slowly.

310
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You can feel yourself come up.

311
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That heavy feeling that's all over your body is lifting slowly.

312
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Reversing from the bad that once took, from your feet to your calves and thighs.

313
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Your thoughts are becoming their own again.

314
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.

315
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Past your hips, your stomach, your chest, your fingertips, your hands, to your elbows,

316
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
your shoulders, slowly up, up, up.

317
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Until that sensation goes back to your collar, your neck, your head.

318
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Until you're you again, little reef-links.

319
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Wow, welcome back to the land of the living.

320
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Hi, Replay. Did you have fun?

321
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, good morning. Good morning, little Replay.

322
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What's my tracking every such a sweet day? Hold on, need to calibrate.

323
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Wow, calibration complete.

324
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Johnny returns, the mean lord herself.

325
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
My cup of tea got cold. I go really into that. I'm sorry, I really go into that.

326
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But my cup of tea is cold, so I can have my cup of tea.

327
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Good morning, little Replay, or afternoon, or evening, or good day soon.

328
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh, let me, this is more me, I think. Yeah, yeah, this is more me.

329
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Microwave the tea, Replay, don't be so sad.

330
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.

331
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Anonymous said, holy moly, this ace of art stream is so good. Thank you very much.

332
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah, that was me trying hard in, but now you've got the mean lord me.

333
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah, get rigged.

334
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's very unlikely I will pull that off again in this stream, because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, what's the word, serious.

335
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, I should probably, maybe we just calm it down.

336
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background, it's quite soothing, but it's me again. Hi.

337
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Hi, Replay.

338
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That cramp lunch box, that's right, get ducked on. Yeah.

339
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you enjoying Aces? Oh, Anonymous. I can't say Brian.

340
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Ah, thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Anonymous says, trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in here.

341
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Gremlin's back, little baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.

342
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Right, if you're here, if you're here for that section we just did, sorry.

343
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The memer, the memer is back, okay? My voice is right from Runescape yesterday.

344
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please like and subscribe for more.

345
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The fantastic news, my little leaflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,

346
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.

347
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm already at 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.

348
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's right, this streamer owes you content.

349
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.

350
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're going to really like that.

351
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
James Cameron's avatar stream, yeah, when I absolutely raged.

352
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But yeah, the memelord's back, don't be expecting anything, but how good is this ASMR sound?

353
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So how good is this?

354
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, I should maybe take off the abnormal background.

355
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Now you get to hear my stomach even more.

356
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Thank you for the tip.

357
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, Irfan Biscotti, thank you for the tips, sis.

358
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Thank you, mommette, very nice and relaxing.

359
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm glad you like felt that.

360
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah, that's more like me.

361
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Best of luck on monetization.

362
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Thank you for the tip, and yes, for that kind of thing, I'm most likely going to be doing free content on Twitter.

363
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Thank you for the tip.

364
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That was amazing.

365
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Please, for the love of all, that is strong.

366
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Keep an eye out for all of this posted.

367
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I never did anything wrong in this stream.

368
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I have done everything correct, but this is a sensory toy, and it's my favorite ASMR trigger right now.

369
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Listen to it.

370
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Isn't that amazing?

371
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Thank you so much for that tip, real good catmuss.

372
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.

373
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.

374
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,

375
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
definitely check her out.

376
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
M.A.

377
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Shabby

378
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
and Azura.

379
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I believe we're all going live as well.

380
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
This is the shortest stream for me.

381
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We will be redirecting into Shabby Cottonbomb.

382
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.

383
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Hey, hey, hey.

384
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Hey, yeah, I was a good girl this stream.

385
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I did everything correct, yeah.

386
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.

387
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

388
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah.

389
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name, right?

390
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't even know what I said.

391
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I forgot your hypercore.

392
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Wait, you're going already?

393
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No.

394
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm going to do, Jen, I'm going to do gremlin ASMR.

395
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm going to do ASMR like me.

396
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look, I even have this to put on your ears.

397
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Are you ready?

398
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Look, look, look, look, look.

399
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm going to put this on your ears.

400
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Ready?

401
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Look.

402
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You're almost home.

403
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
You get my gremlin ASMR.

404
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah.

405
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
This is so nice.

406
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm rubbing them all against your ears.

407
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I put winter earmuffs on your ears.

408
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
What?

409
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Wow, then I did stream with absolutely no ears.

410
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?

411
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They're not going to leave a like, and then don't leave my sound.

412
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, you're so fluffy.

413
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

414
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You're so fluffy.

415
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
First time moving into ASMR, I'm going to come back for more.

416
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Glad I could take it.

417
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.

418
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
My voice is really broken, but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.

419
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Some people like chugging ASMR.

420
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I have lots of chugging water.

421
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay.

422
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Have I been a good girl for you?

423
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wait, wait, wait.

424
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, I forgot my tea.

425
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I've got a cold cup of tea over here.

426
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But I was having a lot of fun doing that ASMR, and really...

427
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Sorry, my throat is making throat noises.

428
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah, but this is just going to be an easier stream, because I don't want to break my voice.

429
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
This is the closest I've ever been to me.

430
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Filly turns to me.

431
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.

432
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
See?

433
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But I think because I didn't plan any of what I was saying, because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.

434
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You know?

435
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's probably why.

436
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Be a good girl and swallow what you...

437
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Reflings were trying to leave this up.

438
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Will you ever do a full hypno video?

439
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah, definitely.

440
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I need to make sure I make it safe though.

441
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I need to educate myself a bit more, because I need it all to be safe.

442
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream, because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,

443
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.

444
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But I really like the permanent effects stuff.

445
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in, and I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.

446
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's not going to be bad or anything.

447
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?

448
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Just a wee bit.

449
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Not a big bit.

450
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.

451
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And it's filbert.

452
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Break me, mommie.

453
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
To keep up the buns, I just have to say, you and your eyes were astonishing.

454
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Thank you.

455
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I love it.

456
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
70% break, take or leave it, and before we commit work, right?

457
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Hey, yeah.

458
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Effects like what?

459
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno, and so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you,

460
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:15,000
like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me, or to do something, or react in a certain way.

461
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And I need to make sure it's super safe, and I need if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore.

462
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It tells your subconscious to throw everything that you learned out the window, and then it's all safe.

463
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Welcome to Stronikato's YouTube, where safety number one priority.

464
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Thoughts already doomed.

465
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Stroni and her permanent effect will be like you will only donate your ink to me.

466
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Basically, kind of.

467
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's the plan.

468
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.

469
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I can't wait.

470
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.

471
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Will there be lullabies for the replay?

472
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.

473
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You are my sunshine.

474
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
My only sunshine.

475
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You make me happy.

476
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
When skies are grey, you'll never know, dear, much I love you.

477
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So please don't take my feet laying away.

478
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Lullabies!

479
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I don't know many other lullabies.

480
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.

481
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, well, next stream I'll have a tracker, so it follows my head around.

482
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So you can't escape my eyes, but I wanted to go very easy.

483
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Very easy on the first one.

484
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Please don't take my sunshine away.

485
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Ta-da!

486
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
There is that cradle one.

487
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The cradle you will fall.

488
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Rock, bye, baby, on the tree top.

489
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

490
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I don't know the rest.

491
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What were your inspirations for being a no-themed career?

492
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I've always, always loved it.

493
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I've always loved it, but I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.

494
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I've touched on surface level, but I was like, I want to go rabbit hole.

495
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.

496
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I want to go all in, baby, all in.

497
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So, well, the table at the top will be fixed.

498
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I can fix it now if you tell me how to spell the word.

499
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What's the word?

500
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Be-er-meh.

501
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Was it ah?

502
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Be-er-meh-ne-ed.

503
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Be-er-meh-ne-ed.

504
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay, there you go.

505
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Just like that, see, I can do it.

506
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Okay, I can even add to bring Kremlin.

507
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Kremlin.

508
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Kremlin.

509
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Wow, look at that.

510
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Super professional.

511
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sorry.

512
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We're going down the heaven of the world.

513
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it until it was time.

514
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And now it's time.

515
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Well, tippy-tippy.

516
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm Kremlin-ized, yeah.

517
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Don't be expecting anything serious from me.

518
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh, did you like my- I've loathe- obnoxiously loathe my keyboardist.

519
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh, yeah.

520
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's so good.

521
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So, I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.

522
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I like finger-clicking.

523
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly-

524
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I want to do me-haps, because I say me-haps all the time.

525
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Me-haps-ree-fling.

526
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You want to go deeper.

527
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Would you kindly-ree-fling go deeper with me?

528
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.

529
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But, yeah.

530
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Is Johnny's susceptible to hypnosis?

531
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes!

532
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My biggest enemy are mirrors.

533
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis, but it only lasts 24 hours.

534
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's fain, it's fain.

535
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Would you kindly- would be hilarious?

536
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.

537
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Look, look, we're gamers out here, okay?

538
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We're gamers.

539
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We're here for the memes as well, but it doesn't mean we can't incorporate our favorite games into our other activities.

540
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Johnny drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.

541
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Stop!

542
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I want to order so much artwork about all these, like, different plots.

543
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm like, oh no, the reeflings have found me.

544
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm just gonna beat you into a mirror.

545
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We didn't- oh no.

546
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But we are doing hypnosis in general, but I've already done the segment because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now.

547
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Because it's me, I can't help it.

548
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm just a freaking meme lord, it's hard to be serious, okay?

549
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our- you didn't finish that segment.

550
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Why are you not finishing?

551
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We're out here gaming.

552
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We're only big gamers here, you tons of games.

553
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Remember that a man-

554
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
a man bleeds a slave obeys and reeflings feel brave.

555
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
For the orders coming from the queue, he put on a suit for your serious stream.

556
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Oh, a man chooses- oops, sorry.

557
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
A man chooses a reefling obeys.

558
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.

559
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

560
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.

561
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A man chooses a reefling obeys.

562
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration? I was looking at the pollin'.

563
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you, we're in gremlin hours, okay?

564
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave, I hope your voice is okay.

565
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I was watching you in the bath again.

566
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream.

567
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,000
In A.C.'s live, so I was watching her and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy drew her.

568
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
If you guys didn't see Mercy drew her, turn it off, it was amazing.

569
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do maybe serious mode, okay?

570
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm actually gonna make sure I'm breathing into Sheebie.

571
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.

572
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But yeah, let's just, hold on, customization redirect.

573
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We partied now, all the snowberries are tired, little babies.

574
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Sheebie's playing call of the lamb.

575
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh my god, I think me and Sheebie might be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.

576
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Is it Sheebie first and then Azura and then Mercy?

577
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?

578
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Eh, Azura or Sheebie?

579
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
She had a big Mercy.

580
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Ujisan party?

581
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Ah, it's tall, that's terrible.

582
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Did the Ujisans have a good time or are you all ready for a nap after that?

583
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hold on, I'll just check who comes online first.

584
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Is Azura or Azura?

585
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Wait, where's, I just don't know.

586
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm sure the girl's on my screen.

587
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But yeah, it's first Azura live and have a long Azura's live all the way in 5, 10.

588
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Okay, no, it's definitely Sheebie that comes up next.

589
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Sorry, it was amazing.

590
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, Ujisans, time to put you to sleep.

591
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Come here, old man.

592
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You're done fainting.

593
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You party so hard with Azura.

594
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And she showed you how much energy she has, yeah.

595
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, and you've used up all your energy, Ujisan.

596
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,000
They may be asleep, but I can't let you sleep.

597
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'm ready to jump up on you.

598
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah, I made a little induction at the end of the stream,

599
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
but right now we're crammin' mode, okay?

600
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can't be serious.

601
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I laughed, I cried, I ooooh, I'm supposed to even pronounce that.

602
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Even in our ASMR stream, she speaks fast.

603
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh yeah, you think that's speakin' fast?

604
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Can you be serious, not for long?

605
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Crammin' mode activated, yeah.

606
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Shhh, we're real ASMRs out here.

607
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm speakin' an enchanted main craft table.

608
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's pronounced U-O-U-O.

609
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Surely you can be serious, but what was that?

610
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It's called Ace Globes.

611
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Because A.C. finished their stream, I'm using Ace Globes.

612
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Ujisan puffing.

613
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh shit, and this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR's streams.

614
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What is that? It's the unknown.

615
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
A.C. should introduce you to Igar, his Igar.

616
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.

617
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR, and Emmy got Scamaste on Ace Globes.

618
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.

619
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I feel better already.

620
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You and Igar will get along well.

621
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I feel better already, yay.

622
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?

623
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So some hypnosis ASMRists like to mark you and leave you with a present,

624
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and I'm not doing that because we are slowly working our way.

625
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You have to take things slow and take your time,

626
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and I'm gonna take my time with you briefly,

627
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and get you all tired.

628
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.

629
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?

630
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.

631
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.

632
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Slow indoctrination.

633
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Would you kindly rethink?

634
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Let me do what I want to you.

635
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Shh, it's time to come down from the party snow berries.

636
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

637
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You're under the sea, don't need hypnosis for that.

638
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Always.

639
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fun, I'm glad.

640
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.

641
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah, my back hurts, okay, true OG suns for it.

642
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But yes, I will do ASMR every week.

643
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Some more intense than the others, some plots as well,

644
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
like fill probably plots, make them live.

645
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,

646
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I do apologize if you type for me to say something.

647
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,

648
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,

649
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.

650
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Big Willy Wallace is moribbly wet.

651
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
My back's gone after that DJ stream.

652
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's so good.

653
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I break from my own mind every week, yeah.

654
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oh yeah, some good plots, oh yeah.

655
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Some real deep thought-provoking plots.

656
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Okay, let me see if there's freaking tracking.

657
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I think, because I'm not sure.

658
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Okay.

659
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Okay, I think this better.

660
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
My mouse tracking just kind of stops working after all.

661
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.

662
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You like the background things.

663
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I made it myself.

664
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I did it.

665
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I'm not like you did an Adobe After Effects.

666
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Past streamer and vealer.

667
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
All my girls were past streamer and vealer.

668
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
They're all the best.

669
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, no.

670
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You do you, Strani, we still love you.

671
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah.

672
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That background is amazing, yes.

673
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I can also go faster or slower,

674
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
but I'll do that another time.

675
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?

676
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Like, I, this, this sound you hear,

677
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
this, I can also make it faster and more intense.

678
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So please don't think I haven't thought this through.

679
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Wait, wait, wait.

680
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It's over for you.

681
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Don't resist.

682
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There's no point in resisting.

683
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Okay, love, rethink.

684
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You are main.

685
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Just give me some time.

686
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Just let me kick.

687
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Me kick.

688
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There.

689
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And then what?

690
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.

691
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That's terrible, rethink.

692
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

693
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That sound doesn't have any side effects.

694
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
No, none of them have secret.

695
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I have no secret agenda.

696
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.

697
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That window cracked like three times during my segments.

698
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I was like, really, you're getting rude.

699
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,

700
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but I really like it.

701
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh, if you don't like that noise,

702
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
don't worry, I'll train you to like it.

703
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Just stop resisting.

704
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Your efforts are futile.

705
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You will not win against me.

706
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I have unending stamina.

707
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Are my streams not proof enough?

708
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Wah, thank you for the tip.

709
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

710
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yes, let's give all money to feel it.

711
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Thank you for the tip, Irwin.

712
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Support my babies.

713
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Support my babies so they can move out.

714
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And I can buy them a better internet connection.

715
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Thank you so much for the tip, though.

716
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I appreciate it greatly.

717
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I need some hydration.

718
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You can hear some ASMR gulps.

719
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
All gone.

720
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
None left.

721
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Thank you.

722
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Wow.

723
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Strani does the cuttlefish throw perfect.

724
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Only at one speed.

725
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yes, only one speed.

726
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.

727
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'll fate mommy's unending stamina with my own.

728
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Let's see her come set one top.

729
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Me.

730
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Oh, the cuttlefish is going to give.

731
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I can't read that out.

732
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, my money's going to skew.

733
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
For those of you who did train in a little late,

734
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:34,000
my YouTube channel has been spent for monetization.

735
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today

736
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
in preparation for my monetization stream.

737
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So there's your hint.

738
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Hopefully it comes through quickly.

739
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And I'm very excited.

740
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Zeroed in audible.

741
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, I did it into my...

742
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

743
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

744
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.

745
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I have no idea what...

746
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I think they like massage your legs as well.

747
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So I'm going to like get nice and smooth and like shave my legs.

748
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like stubbly legs.

749
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But yeah, I will be interesting.

750
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Maybe I should like live tweet my experience and being like,

751
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Oh, the person's doing this now.

752
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
They're doing this to my foot.

753
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Because I've never had like a pedicure is when it's your feet.

754
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because pediatry is feet care.

755
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And then manicure, man-manjitables are your hands.

756
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And while the rest of the fee allergen begin monetization too,

757
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
yes, they are being submitted today.

758
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update

759
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
because they're taking their sweet time.

760
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It took a week for the statistics to update.

761
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And then everyone is doing their monetization celebration streams.

762
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And ooh, everyone's eating good.

763
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That's all I'm going to say.

764
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It may as well be...

765
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.

766
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
What the fuck?

767
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
My tech...

768
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
What?

769
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
What the fuck?

770
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
My phone?

771
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
My phone?

772
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
My tech talk?

773
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I was so scared.

774
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Oh my God.

775
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I was so scared.

776
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
My phone...

777
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
My tech talk just opened up on its own.

778
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Bruh, China's listening in.

779
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
What the fuck?

780
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I...what the fuck?

781
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
My phone just opened up on its own

782
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
to play a freaking advertisement to me.

783
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
What was that?

784
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I thought someone was outside in the garden.

785
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I was like, oh my God, there's someone outside my house.

786
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I need to end stream right now.

787
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That was scary.

788
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh my God.

789
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I was so scared there.

790
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I was like, what?

791
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
China, I'll prove to you, sir.

792
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
My Chinese grade just went up by 100K.

793
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That was horrifying.

794
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I thought that was...

795
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I was like, what?

796
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I should be the only thing making noise

797
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
because what was that?

798
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
What?

799
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
My heart rate is exhilarated.

800
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Literally my social credit just went up.

801
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What on earth?

802
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I think that was an ad because I opened tech talk

803
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and then it loaded a video or something.

804
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
We can hire her.

805
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
She said, I'm not doing hypnosis.

806
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm gremlin mode.

807
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Read the top.

808
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's what you get for having TikTok.

809
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That's what I get for brain run.

810
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
That was scary.

811
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Jeez.

812
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay, what was I saying before that?

813
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Oh, monetization.

814
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Wait, is monetization a trigger word

815
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
for the TikTok spice?

816
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
They want the money too.

817
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What is it?

818
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Do you want heart beat ASMR?

819
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I don't think I have a ceiling on it.

820
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A member ceiling.

821
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The numbers may send, honestly.

822
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Because I was talking about monetization in the hand.

823
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
TikTok loves monetization.

824
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I said, yeah, give me some of that.

825
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Jeez.

826
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Okay.

827
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Let's drag you back into ASMR.

828
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That freaked me out.

829
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That was scary because I was like, hello?

830
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Hello, who's there?

831
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Refill yourself.

832
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Refill, yes I do.

833
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Okay.

834
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Just save money.

835
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Shhh.

836
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I accidentally woke up.

837
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What happened?

838
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
My freaking phone started playing ads.

839
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.

840
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't like, I'm not bringing.

841
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't like that.

842
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
That was scary.

843
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
We're in your walls.

844
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh my gosh.

845
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Okay, let's see if we can do heart beat ASMR.

846
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I need to put you over my hoodie, okay?

847
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
But maybe a little loud.

848
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But this is my heart.

849
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I'll do this side because it's easier.

850
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You have one.

851
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Thank you.

852
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Can you hear it?

853
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Can you hear my heart at all?

854
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah.

855
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's my heart beat.

856
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Is it fast or slow?

857
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It might be fast because I'm talking.

858
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That's why at the doctor's office,

859
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
they tell you not to talk

860
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.

861
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?

862
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
We're going to mess around, okay?

863
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm going to turn the volume down.

864
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Okay.

865
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And that's just my heart.

866
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm hearing mummies.

867
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You hear my stomach sound?

868
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Stop.

869
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That's how fast my heart can really go.

870
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?

871
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Because it's my content,

872
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?

873
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
The stomach was louder than the heart now.

874
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm going to do an ASMR video,

875
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
like a role play,

876
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
where you are pregnant

877
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and you're in my tummy

878
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and I'm talking to you about how proud I am

879
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and how excited I am

880
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
for everything you're going to achieve in your life.

881
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And I can't wait for you to experience the world

882
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
and it's going to have my actual heart beat

883
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and stomach sounds in it.

884
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And I'm going to tell you

885
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
all that you deserve,

886
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
all the good things in life that happen.

887
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And I'm going to be your cheerleader.

888
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And yeah, I need to get the artwork commissioned though,

889
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.

890
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.

891
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So yeah, and I'm going to tell you

892
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
how excited I am for you to get to know you

893
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and I get to see what your personality is like

894
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and you're going to be perfect in every way.

895
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Because there's no way that my little refling can do any wrong.

896
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
That's strangely, yeah,

897
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and you're going to hear my tummy sounds and my heart beat

898
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and my voice is going to be muffled.

899
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
It's going to be like this, okay.

900
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
This is what my voice is going to sound like.

901
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And I'm so proud of you.

902
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Now my voice is so broken.

903
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm sorry I broke my voice,

904
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
so this doesn't sound very pleasant.

905
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
But I'm so proud of you

906
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and I can't wait to meet you

907
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and I can't wait to watch you grow up

908
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and do all the things you love

909
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
and see what hobbies you fall in love with.

910
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.

911
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah.

912
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Your broken voice sounds like sadness.

913
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Oh no, I know it's sad.

914
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm even sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,

915
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.

916
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Who's the daddy?

917
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Are you, again, refling?

918
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Don't you not know the failure or the lore?

919
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
The reason why I have five dollars

920
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
is all because of the reflings.

921
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
See, in order to make sure that no one refling

922
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
can claim that they're the daddy,

923
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
all of us got together,

924
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
turned the lights out and just went for it.

925
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Okay, we just went for it.

926
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That's how we have five dollars.

927
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Okay.

928
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
We should do that again sometime.

929
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Oh yeah.

930
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You want to find out what book it is?

931
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
We're both hired out.

932
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
We've actually been confirmed

933
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that we are showing up to a convention

934
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
but it's in 2025.

935
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
But I think it's in California.

936
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah.

937
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I'm all the reflings on the daddy.

938
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
No, I won't take my meds.

939
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But yeah, very excited.

940
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet

941
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
up at a convention,

942
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but I don't know how the girls feel about her.

943
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And I have absolutely horrific traveling anxiety.

944
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So I'm going to be so high.

945
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm going to be high on medications.

946
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm paying for that bag storage box.

947
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Honestly, I'm the father.

948
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Oh, I'm the father, does a back flip.

949
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Can the VIP treatment?

950
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Oh yeah.

951
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I wish I could go to the con.

952
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I don't know if I can go to the con.

953
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So please do not book any conventions.

954
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
For this whole purpose, in case I show up,

955
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
that's not how it works.

956
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Mummies do weaknesses, traveling, mirrors.

957
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I mean, I'll fill it in another stream.

958
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah, it's a very unfunny story.

959
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's a friend in the toilet.

960
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
My backyard would love to go next.

961
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That would be really cute, yeah.

962
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up.

963
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Oh my gosh, but then,

964
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer

965
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and you basically get all the feel.

966
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
If we basically boomed you with five dollars,

967
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
shall we do it again with another five?

968
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
No.

969
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
With another six.

970
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Come on, mommy needs to cook.

971
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Like 41 hours away from California.

972
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I think it's in California.

973
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't actually know where it is.

974
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Six, yeah.

975
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Every gen and veiler.

976
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
In theory, has six girls.

977
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And there should be one design

978
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
of each that you gravitate towards.

979
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
That's right.

980
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I may not be the smartest,

981
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
but I know what to do sometimes.

982
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But I like being dumb.

983
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.

984
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What if you gravitate towards all the designs?

985
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I don't know.

986
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I feel like one has to speak to you.

987
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
So you are the oven.

988
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm just an oven.

989
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I just need you to fill it.

990
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Let's be dumb together.

991
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Let's be dumb together.

992
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Let's be dumb together.

993
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You're great except for the naming part, exactly.

994
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
What do you mean, strawnee 365?

995
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I wonder if I called myself strawnee 365

996
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
because my secret goal was to stream

997
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
every single day for a year.

998
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water

999
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
unless I'm gravely ill.

1000
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Smooth out the brain wrinkles.

1001
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
This is something I can get by it.

1002
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?

1003
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
They know so go in me.

1004
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I, you like this accent.

1005
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
That's what tickles your pickle.

1006
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Or then you make me,

1007
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I'll tickle that pickle any day I will.

1008
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
What do you mean?

1009
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You'll always be my arsy.

1010
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Arsy, thank you.

1011
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
See, I'm here because Fiche,

1012
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
who doesn't like Fiche,

1013
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
also impressive Xbox Game Collection.

1014
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What's that?

1015
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah, he's been Xbox good.

1016
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Oh, so cool.

1017
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments

1018
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
that were like,

1019
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.

1020
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yeah, and PlayStation sucks, yeah.

1021
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yeah.

1022
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That accent is good.

1023
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's above.

1024
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That accent's funny.

1025
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It can be sexy when I put it on.

1026
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I feel like if I want to do like a voice that commands you,

1027
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I need to go deeper.

1028
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm a console warfare, and yeah.

1029
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
See, I was bursted,

1030
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and I had to be a stud from a car boot sale for a five-hour playstation.

1031
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yeah, PlayStation drills.

1032
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.

1033
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
No beating that.

1034
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Count me or she get location.

1035
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The Scottish accent is sexy.

1036
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I didn't know how.

1037
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.

1038
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I'm like, oh, who's it going, lads?

1039
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yep, this is so as I'm laced.

1040
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We better have some backpapes at the convention.

1041
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
No, that's awful.

1042
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.

1043
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Nintendo was so expensive.

1044
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
My dad got me a Nintendo DS,

1045
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,000
but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand

1046
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Xbox 360 games over Nintendo's secondhand,

1047
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
because it was so expensive.

1048
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
We used to have this game shop in the UK called GameStop or Game.

1049
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I think they both went past, I can't remember.

1050
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And basically,

1051
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
wait, what?

1052
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
They went past, but they used to sell secondhand games,

1053
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
and that's how I got all my games.

1054
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
They used to do what was called trade-ins,

1055
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and I would have to trade in my games to get new ones.

1056
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I think Game Stations Buster, yeah.

1057
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Wasn't it called EP Games?

1058
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
No, not in the UK, not that I know of.

1059
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
You aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.

1060
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Yes, and they just shut down the eNintendo store.

1061
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I think GameStop is still a thing.

1062
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Did you ever go to CEX?

1063
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I don't think so.

1064
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.

1065
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, that's how I got my games.

1066
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It's been Game Stations.

1067
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Oh, maybe it's Game Stations that at GameStop.

1068
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Maybe Game Station.

1069
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Just remember, I was a weebap,

1070
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I just looked at the covers of the games and went,

1071
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Dad, I want that one.

1072
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
EP is...

1073
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Wait, what?

1074
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
EP Games was in the UK?

1075
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Oh, yeah, no, I...

1076
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Yeah.

1077
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
If it went past in 2002, yeah, no.

1078
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I never experienced EP Games.

1079
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I was Xbox for a long time then Switch

1080
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
because the Japanese make some fire games.

1081
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Yeah.

1082
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Game is still a thing in the UK.

1083
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
GameStop is still a thing in the US.

1084
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I'll go.

1085
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
EP Games.

1086
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
We're just EP sleepy gamers.

1087
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I miss choosing games by the cover now I Google them.

1088
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Things endlessly.

1089
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yeah.

1090
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
If you're ever one in a new game to completely time sync

1091
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and you play PC for mods,

1092
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I recommend the painting of Isaac

1093
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and I'm not recommending it

1094
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.

1095
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
It's a very big game.

1096
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Big game, big game.

1097
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah.

1098
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
In the UK, this game now, GameStation,

1099
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
go buy a buy-up.

1100
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Oh, go, go, go.

1101
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
EP Games was absorbed by GameStop.

1102
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Oh my god, we're getting the lore.

1103
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
We're getting the capitalism lore.

1104
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Yeah, painting of Isaac.

1105
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah.

1106
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
The painting of Isaac.

1107
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah.

1108
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The painting of Isaac.

1109
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Yeah.

1110
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
The painting of Isaac.

1111
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Yeah.

1112
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
The painting of Isaac.

1113
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah.

1114
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah.

1115
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore in your PC, huh?

1116
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yeah.

1117
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.

1118
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, the Xbox original.

1119
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I wanted to get my 360,

1120
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but I think it's messed up.

1121
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It's the largest console I own by a country male.

1122
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Here's a war handstone based story.

1123
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I'm sure I've just misread that,

1124
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
but you actually made cameo.

1125
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah, it's like fantasy game.

1126
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It's really nice.

1127
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,

1128
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if you're talking about overall,

1129
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

1130
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
yeah, sorry, you've just miss,

1131
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed as fine as it.

1132
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You spell it as, as in, Creed.

1133
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Yeah.

1134
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
No, it's fine.

1135
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You've just misspelled.

1136
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Don't worry about it.

1137
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I can read through what you're missing.

1138
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers?

1139
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,

1140
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
but no, I don't think.

1141
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I would love to do Army of Two.

1142
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?

1143
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.

1144
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
My dad, so if my dad bought the console,

1145
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
he would let me play it basically,

1146
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
and he bought a Game Boy,

1147
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.

1148
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
And I played Pokemon Ribby.

1149
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

1150
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And one more game that I,

1151
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.

1152
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I forgot.

1153
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.

1154
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Oh, my voice is breaking.

1155
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

1156
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Oh, sorry.

1157
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Oh, no.

1158
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Wait, no, sorry.

1159
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Tapping ASMR.

1160
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Little, little tappies.

1161
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It doesn't actually sound that nice.

1162
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't know what 33 Immortals is.

1163
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I haven't heard about it, have we?

1164
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
What's your favorite Pokemon?

1165
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And why is it Shandler?

1166
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I actually didn't mean lightweight.

1167
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Lightweight is so cute.

1168
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
But see, Pokemon have this thing

1169
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokemon,

1170
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and then its evolution is Auckland.

1171
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I didn't want ugly, ugly evolutions.

1172
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Lightweight is adorable.

1173
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's an MMO.

1174
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Oh, no, we're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.

1175
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I took the console with me everywhere.

1176
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It'd be the crap out of the paints worn out,

1177
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
but it still works.

1178
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
All old-school games, I don't see.

1179
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Literally think of, what is it?

1180
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Joystick Drift?

1181
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
No, that's not a gender name.

1182
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Is it Joy-Con Drift?

1183
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch.

1184
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But Game Boy Advance is that we're made.

1185
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
How many years back still work?

1186
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'm catching up on old-school RuneScape vision now.

1187
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Did y'all know there was a Pokemon card game on Game Boy?

1188
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
No.

1189
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's in the up-gaming.

1190
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Sorry, my voice is cracking.

1191
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Hello, I've got 25 minutes,

1192
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and then I'm going for an official vocal rest

1193
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
and we are reading into Shibi playing.

1194
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.

1195
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I rate it very highly.

1196
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I had a Game Boy card game.

1197
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It was so fun.

1198
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Courtney was so hot as Courtney.

1199
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The Game Boy card game was actually really good.

1200
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Sorry, can't go back to sleep.

1201
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
May as well cook something.

1202
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Oh, very good.

1203
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And Jack and Kenabiana.

1204
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Ah!

1205
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Hey, yo.

1206
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.

1207
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,

1208
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
so I'm going to force Shibi to play it with me.

1209
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I still have my Pokemon card game on Game Boy.

1210
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yeah.

1211
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Gonna go at work, see you next dream.

1212
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Yeah, I'm ending.

1213
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
We're gonna redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?

1214
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
You should play with us as cultists

1215
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
then starting kiki-kiki.

1216
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't know how the multiplayer works,

1217
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
but we'll see.

1218
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.

1219
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.

1220
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Damn, it feels like the stream just started.

1221
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.

1222
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Have you ever played War Thunder?

1223
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Yeah, I saw it.

1224
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
It's local co-op.

1225
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I could have sworn.

1226
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Horn, as all they said, had multiplayer.

1227
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Am I going crazy?

1228
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
What are you doing after stream?

1229
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm gonna make a cup of tea to soothe my throat.

1230
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And then I'm going to message clippers

1231
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
or check any clips that the girls might have had.

1232
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And then I'm gonna get a manicure and a pedicure.

1233
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I can't believe I'm saying that,

1234
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
but yes, I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

1235
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs in preparation of getting monetised

1236
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
so I can upload those 1K special videos

1237
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and I will probably write the script for the pregnant with you ASMR that I want to make

1238
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
and I'll most likely contact an artist as well about it.

1239
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
But yeah.

1240
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Quite a few things I need to catch up on.

1241
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Especially with the Endurance Streams.

1242
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background as she plays.

1243
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So whoever said War Thunder, you only play that game if you hate yourself.

1244
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But yes, I have a big day, big day.

1245
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet and hands afterwards

1246
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,000
because some people don't like streamers that do like hand cam or whatever.

1247
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I'm very sorry if, you know, get vellard, get vellard, get vellard, but yeah.

1248
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.

1249
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Wow.

1250
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Whilst I eat the American candy.

1251
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Wow.

1252
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I get to try A&W visages.

1253
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's like a cream and soda, I said, but I don't normally drink cream and soda.

1254
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And what other?

1255
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I think there is Twizzlers.

1256
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
There is like Spacey Hall, Cheetos or something.

1257
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Or Takis.

1258
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I get to try Takis.

1259
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
There's 20 grippers.

1260
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?

1261
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I mean, I can do it.

1262
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I can put my feet in the stream if you want.

1263
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Okay.

1264
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
You wish is my command.

1265
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Look, you guys don't understand.

1266
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Like, you may be used to streamers out here that don't do what you want.

1267
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You do not understand.

1268
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I will do what you want.

1269
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Send me what you want.

1270
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Let me know.

1271
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Look, as much as I am in command of you, you are in command of me.

1272
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I will think of a humorous way to incorporate my feet into more stream, okay?

1273
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Call us kid names.

1274
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
My little baby replay.

1275
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
We need the scrawny thighs.

1276
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Can I put thighs?

1277
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't know.

1278
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I've not decided on my outfit.

1279
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I think I'm just wearing fishnets.

1280
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I'm sorry.

1281
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on for a vacant stream.

1282
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
You guys are terrible.

1283
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Please don't put on my smell.

1284
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.

1285
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.

1286
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.

1287
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Oh my.

1288
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That was a lot more than yesterday.

1289
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Yeah.

1290
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
What's mommy going to do?

1291
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants.

1292
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to.

1293
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Oh, sorry.

1294
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I love your hypnosis.

1295
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.

1296
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I'm so glad that it's so well during that section.

1297
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1298
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Yeah, sorry, I'm reading Marshmallows,

1299
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.

1300
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Yippee!

1301
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.

1302
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I'm supposed to be like,

1303
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
oh, but what does my ghost do it?

1304
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Are you a bit of an emmy?

1305
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again,

1306
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
but it's probably not going to be that good.

1307
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I need to be in the zone to corrupt you,

1308
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
but because I've been allowed to me, I feel like myself.

1309
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And I'm just some goofy dork, like, honestly.

1310
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.

1311
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I wear so many hats.

1312
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Why is animus showing us a strange coat of false thoughts?

1313
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Why is animus showing us a strange coat of false thoughts?

1314
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Not enough time.

1315
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Your error, goofy dork.

1316
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yay, communist hole.

1317
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I've already prayed in obedience.

1318
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Jokes on you, how many of them?

1319
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Uh...

1320
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Hey strongy, after a year of waiting,

1321
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
you've really surprised me.

1322
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Well, I'm just...

1323
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I have been afraid to die for a while

1324
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,

1325
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
but the girls are great and the content is stellar.

1326
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I'm glad.

1327
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I usually just work at lurk and watch streams,

1328
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
but I felt like I had to tell you,

1329
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I love mommy and I love when she's...

1330
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
and I love what she's done with the place.

1331
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I love you too, little refling.

1332
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I'm so glad you love the girls as well.

1333
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I was really worried that,

1334
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
like, you guys would think,

1335
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
like, go support them, you know?

1336
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Cause I'm like that.

1337
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
She said she wasn't in a hidden program

1338
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
and I hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are

1339
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and in any case, thank you.

1340
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Oh, I'm having a good time.

1341
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The only reason I ain't doing insurance...

1342
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's my voice and this is how I'm talking.

1343
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I'm a little broken,

1344
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.

1345
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.

1346
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But don't worry, you can fix me.

1347
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I just need some of your ink, okay?

1348
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.

1349
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.

1350
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Let me read it.

1351
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Airwind player, thank you for the tip.

1352
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
That's the way today. Thank you so much for the hypnosis.

1353
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Look forward to what's to come.

1354
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1355
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Really amazed at how good this is going.

1356
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Much love, thank you.

1357
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.

1358
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's really weird because I broke...

1359
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
So my voice has broken and whispering breaks your voice further,

1360
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.

1361
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It's crazy. I don't know how it works.

1362
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We whisper.

1363
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yes.

1364
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Very inkable.

1365
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,

1366
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
but I shan't.

1367
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I won't refrain from such sins.

1368
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I won't refrain, okay?

1369
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Getting it, getting it, getting it. Incredible.

1370
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today

1371
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
because I don't have to record anything

1372
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
and I need to send collab partner scripts.

1373
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Wow!

1374
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Sly Saber, thank you for the tip.

1375
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It says, thanks for the ASMR. Here's your inking.

1376
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
My voice is so broken.

1377
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Dainy, spainy, thank you for the tip.

1378
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I just got some iron bread delivered shop.

1379
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So I'll try scotch soda for the first time tomorrow on stream

1380
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
when you try porn stuff.

1381
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yay, let's go.

1382
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I have iron bread too.

1383
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Actually, I'll drink iron bread with you.

1384
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Oh, you made me ink.

1385
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?

1386
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm so professional, okay?

1387
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look

1388
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
at Marshmallows shortly.

1389
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
A lot of them cannot be said.

1390
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Mayhaps in membership streams.

1391
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
You never know.

1392
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Nine out of ten doctors recommend,

1393
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
oh yeah, our refling's doctors.

1394
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Good for the throat, sure.

1395
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I mean, want to find her?

1396
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
This is terrible.

1397
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Don't you want to help me?

1398
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Help me feel better?

1399
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Come on.

1400
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
If you can do something to help me,

1401
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I'll be good, okay?

1402
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
But you need to be good in return.

1403
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Be good for me.

1404
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Give me what I need.

1405
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
That's terrible.

1406
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Okay, no going under.

1407
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
No going under, stop.

1408
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's just me.

1409
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm still memeing, okay?

1410
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm still memeing.

1411
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.

1412
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
If mummy asks refling's answer,

1413
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
what, another tip?

1414
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

1415
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Yeah, it helps Johnny.

1416
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I don't know why sometimes the message displays

1417
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
and then it doesn't display.

1418
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It's been so silly.

1419
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Can you make your back wrinkle a bit faster?

1420
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Right now, I don't think so.

1421
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But I do have alternative

1422
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
dingy mobobbers.

1423
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh wait, here we go. Are you ready?

1424
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Wait.

1425
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Yeah.

1426
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I can do like this.

1427
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's going so fast.

1428
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?

1429
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's terrible.

1430
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Isn't it?

1431
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Just terrible.

1432
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But that's as fast as I can make it.

1433
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Okay?

1434
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So hopefully that's faster now.

1435
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Speed up or slow down?

1436
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Yeah.

1437
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1438
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Okay.

1439
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
That should be the correct settings.

1440
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I think.

1441
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Trucks on you are always under.

1442
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah, I get to set the pace.

1443
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Just don't make it too fast.

1444
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Don't want anyone out here.

1445
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Let's see.

1446
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Ta-da!

1447
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Tip.

1448
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Nero, thank you for the tip.

1449
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
He says all my ink belongs to you, Johnny.

1450
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You just need to ask,

1451
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
have I broken you already?

1452
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Yeah?

1453
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Am I allowed to break you?

1454
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Have I still got the effect on my voice

1455
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
or is it normal again?

1456
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Wait, what?

1457
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
What?

1458
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
What?

1459
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
My pupils are broken.

1460
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
It's normal.

1461
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Okay, you broke us a long time ago.

1462
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Can't break what's already broken.

1463
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Dang.

1464
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I see a few of you are already broken in for me.

1465
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
You broke me at a low.

1466
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.

1467
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I forgot its name.

1468
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I don't know what it is.

1469
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
My seashells or my hair.

1470
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I'm going to be honest,

1471
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I wouldn't take much.

1472
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It's over.

1473
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
That's cheating, Johnny.

1474
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Look, I will get my way.

1475
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I said an ending stamina.

1476
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I meant it.

1477
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
He broke me at a low.

1478
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
It's true.

1479
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Your voice is so entrancing.

1480
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Your voice is so entrancing.

1481
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah.

1482
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
When it's not broken, hopefully I will do better soon.

1483
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I can have much more ASMR.

1484
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I am folding like a towel.

1485
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
No, it's not. It's brain milled.

1486
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
An ending stamina gives me every time.

1487
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Yeah, it does.

1488
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
It should.

1489
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Should I do vocal requests for the rest of the stream?

1490
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And you guys type what you want me to say.

1491
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It's the sofa format.

1492
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I did that under a serious ASMR.

1493
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
There's only so much banner I can draw.

1494
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I'm just scuttlebreed, okay?

1495
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I'm just a bit scuttlebreed.

1496
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I'm already folded on top of the linen closet ready for use.

1497
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You're asking for all you want me 10 to 0.

1498
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,000
We've only got 8 minutes left.

1499
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
8 minutes.

1500
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I don't even know if I'm allowed to do your kissing.

1501
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
My tummy's making a noise.

1502
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Can you hypnotize us to make your dogs for a shabby stream?

1503
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I would love to do that.

1504
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Can we do that?

1505
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Can we do that?

1506
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Can we please do that?

1507
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Please, let me hypnotize you to be a dog for a shabby stream.

1508
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Let me set up for this.

1509
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I'm so serious.

1510
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I need to set up for this.

1511
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Hold on, let me drink some water as well.

1512
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I'm so serious.

1513
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I am so serious.

1514
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Let me just de-grammify myself because we're in serious mode.

1515
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Hold on, one last calibration.

1516
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Because this iPhone is killing me.

1517
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Let's get to work.

1518
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Oh no, that's not it.

1519
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
There, there.

1520
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm not the only one that can look after you this way.

1521
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:57,000
In fact, I have five more that I refer to as my daughters.

1522
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
There is one who will join you soon.

1523
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
She will look after you.

1524
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But there's a cat with a leafling.

1525
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:22,000
You need to be well behaved, okay?

1526
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Almost like a dog.

1527
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
You know how to be a good dog, don't you?

1528
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
You need to be malleable, follow commands.

1529
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Be told what to do, what to say, what to think.

1530
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You are nothing but a pup for her amusement.

1531
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And in her, you will amuse me.

1532
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So be good.

1533
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Don't worry, it'll wear off soon.

1534
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
After her stream.

1535
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
But for now, good pup speak.

1536
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And they go park, don't they?

1537
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Yeah.

1538
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And then, they wait on the command of their owner.

1539
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
You are owned, do you understand?

1540
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
You do not have free will.

1541
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You're a mutt.

1542
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Ready to do the bidding of your owner.

1543
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
So let her have fun, okay?

1544
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And in turn, I will have fun, and you will have fun.

1545
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:33,000
So don't think, no until you're told otherwise.

1546
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Because in three minutes, I'm going to hand the imaginary leash over to your new owner.

1547
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Don't worry, it's temporary.

1548
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
But you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1549
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Get to play with a new owner for a while.

1550
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Good pup, you deserve some head pads, don't you?

1551
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Oh, you're a good boy.

1552
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Such a good boy.

1553
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And it feels so rewarding to hear praise, doesn't it?

1554
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:32,000
In two minutes, you get your new owner, just temporary, for a little while.

1555
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And she'll give you all the attention you need, all the love.

1556
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
And I'll reward you extra when you come back to me, okay?

1557
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So you'll be good, won't you, little pup?

1558
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I've taught you well, you know how to behave.

1559
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So be good, in one minute, your new owner will take your leash and build you along with her.

1560
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Okay?

1561
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Good little pup, such a good, good boy.

1562
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Oh, I hear her, she's coming.

1563
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I hope you're ready.

1564
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Zero.

1565
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Good dog.
