1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, I was over for you before we even got started.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, are you there?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Can you hear this little call of it?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, my mouth is wiggling because I didn't put my lid on.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So professional, so professional.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My cats are currently play-fighting.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So if you hear my cats play-fighting, it's going to be terrible.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I made the mistake of giving my cats what's called a licky lick.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wait, have I spelled permanent wrong?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not dead.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if you hear bumping about, my cats are going absolutely wild.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now today is a very short stream.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I should really sound like this for you.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Good evening.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And good afternoon.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have lots of fun things to try.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Time to make myself louder or lower the background sound.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now I just want to say I'm not doing any permanent effects.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So don't worry, you're in good condition.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will look after you as I hear my cat bumping against my door.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hi.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Have I spelled permanent but irrelevant?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now you all know.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Make it permanent.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Have to miss this stream, it's okay.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're going nice and slow.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't normally use these eyes, but I can't help it.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It was always permanent.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can never hear my cats run behind my couch.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, there she goes.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, and she's...

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, I think she's just jumped on the cardboard box now.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But take your time to relax.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think she's beaten up V-core right now.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Of course, she's been so good.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Literally, she's beaten up V-core right now, but it's okay.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So slowly, you can feel yourself starting to drift.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And that's okay.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just like that feeling, come over here.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No reflex, don't let go.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh no, is this ear broken?

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is this ear broken?

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh my gosh, wait, why is one ear stronger than the other?

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, okay, I just said right into your ear.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sorry, I just whispered right into your ear.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The ear works, but as less equal, I haven't thought of anything.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know why, because my focus rate isn't equal.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's such a professional stream there.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, I should say correct.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay if it's weaker.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I like them weak.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's the best part?

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hello.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have this gullfish laria to the depths.

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For no particular reason at all.

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, sorry, I did it twice.

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have to make it twice.

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm just gonna brush over your ears to give you the feeling of a false security,

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
as I'm sure I'm not planning anything else at all.

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Not one single thing.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And we get to go down into the depths together.

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just me, and you, and my voice, and you listening in.

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, gently.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Brushing over your ears.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And some cats, okay, maybe the catster.

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Wow.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Gentle, gentle movements.

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have some good news for my reflinks.

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The YouTube channel has been submitted for monetizing.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, the heat just came on.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I need to go turn the heat off, I'm so sorry.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I need to get back to work.

76
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, see, I did it.

77
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you here?

78
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm so professional, let's go.

79
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on, it was me, I won't get all lost being professional, it's me.

80
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, when can I start being myself?

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Or do I need to keep being professional?

82
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The cat turned the heat on because it wants attention.

83
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Go, when I'm all of you, let me, okay, give me five more minutes, I'll be serious, okay?

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The noise is encapsulating you.

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And you feel may have a sense of belonging.

86
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You could even think to yourself, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

87
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If I gave up control, control to one particular girl and it wouldn't be so bad.

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's the worst that could happen from this little gullfish?

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is there a cat in my room?

90
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay, I literally thought Gimli sneaked in there.

91
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:11,000
As I'm saying control yet, surely this gullfish means no harm.

92
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Even if it was for 24 hours, one day, one day, how much harm could you really be under or could be done in 24 little hours?

93
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No more harm at all.

94
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So slowly your mate wonders, what would this gullfish ask me to do?

95
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Only a few things, my dear refling.

96
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But some things can't be said, only guessed.

97
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You have to go into deeper parts of your mate to know and realize what this gullfish wants.

98
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And maybe my dear refling, you realize I want complete and total control of you.

99
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Would that be so bad?

100
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, so maybe that 24 hours becomes 48 and then 48 becomes 72.

101
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And before you know it, this gullfish has had a week of you.

102
00:13:34,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then two weeks, a month, or maybe just maybe this gullfish mate breaks you.

103
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's just my things that I want.

104
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But you have to earn the things you want, so I need to bathe, don't I?

105
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I need to do the right things.

106
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So you're encapsulated by me, yeah?

107
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So how about just for now, I'll be a good girl for you.

108
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And maybe, just maybe, you'll be a very good boy for me.

109
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Does that sound like a plan, my dear refling?

110
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, let's see how much we can bathe together.

111
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's be on our best behavior then.

112
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll tell you a way that I can be good for you.

113
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll allow you, refling, to take sentences you want me to say in chat right now.

114
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And I just might go from ear to ear and gain more favor from you as I say what you want to hear.

115
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Does that sound like a plan?

116
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I'd love to do that for you.

117
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Gain your favor, huh?

118
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Say bye, means couple fish in Italian.

119
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hi, honey.

120
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All lay on the reef.

121
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're such a believable little thing, aren't ya?

122
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's why we have such fun together, isn't it, refling?

123
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I love you, refling.

124
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm proud of you.

125
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm proud of us.

126
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm totally not hypnotizing you right now.

127
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, you're not gonna be a loser, are you, refling?

128
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're not gonna lose to me.

129
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't tell me this is enough to put you under my spell.

130
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You have to make me work for it, refling.

131
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You do less work really, really hard.

132
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Here we go.

133
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You can look in my eyes.

134
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Just done the spiral.

135
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Dear.

136
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you like looking into my eyes?

137
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think they're rather dandelizing, don't ya?

138
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can make my eyes open wide like this.

139
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Staring right at you.

140
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I see you.

141
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you see me.

142
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And you see everything I'm doing to you.

143
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right at this very second.

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's okay.

145
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can blink.

146
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But don't look away for too long.

147
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Remember, we have to behave for one another.

148
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Do you like that?

149
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Just tap on your ears gently, gently, gently.

150
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're more welcome.

151
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're more than welcome to blink.

152
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And sink.

153
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I quite like that phrase, blink and sink.

154
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's okay if your body starts to feel a bit weaker.

155
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And if your mind starts to wander, that's okay.

156
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You may even say little refling.

157
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's by design.

158
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

159
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know.

160
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's just something about you being a bit tired around me.

161
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Maybe you don't want to fade back.

162
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Not like you could by the time I'm done with ya.

163
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
My little refling, why don't you come a little bit closer?

164
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I promise I won't pay.

165
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

166
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In fact, you may blink what you faint as you go deeper and deeper with me.

167
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Deeper and deeper your thoughts are turning to confusion.

168
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What did you say?

169
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With only my voice remaining in your head,

170
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you don't have to focus on a single thing other than what this luring cuttlefish is saying.

171
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There, there.

172
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just look at me and forget.

173
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
All you need to know, refling, is that you're safe and you're in good hands with me.

174
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And by the time I'm finished with you, you'll already want to be going under again.

175
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Your little refling.

176
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll give you a tingle break, okay?

177
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll say more phrases shortly, but have a little break, break, break, break.

178
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We need to take things slow.

179
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Think of it as an introduction to your induction.

180
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But please don't worry.

181
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There will be no permanent effects in this dream.

182
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So you are welcome to go as deep as you like with me.

183
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

184
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Although I do admit this good girl likes it when you go deep.

185
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

186
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you for the death, little refling.

187
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You like when I do ASMR streams on you, huh?

188
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, I had plenty of time to think of how I could truly make you break you.

189
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This is one of many, okay?

190
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So to those who may be resistant, that's okay.

191
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because I'm coming for you.

192
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you understand?

193
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I will get you.

194
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That is my goal.

195
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And have I failed any of my goals so far?

196
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No, little refling.

197
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So heed my warning.

198
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I am coming.

199
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

200
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Relax.

201
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If you think my words are waking you up,

202
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they should be slowly bringing you down.

203
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Down, down, down, okay?

204
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That's why we need a little timer where we just listen in.

205
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And whatever our brain and body decides will do.

206
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But that doesn't mean this cuttlefish can suggest a few things to you.

207
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Huh?

208
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

209
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Hey.

210
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Just let whatever happens happen.

211
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I won't be beating you purposefully in a trance, okay?

212
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But if you just happen to be so well-trained,

213
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I welcome it entirely.

214
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I welcome my voice in encapsulating your mind.

215
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I welcome your full attention.

216
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So be good, little refling, and don't keep me waiting.

217
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

218
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You might feel it starting from your head

219
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and slowly a sensation radiates downwards

220
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
down to your neck, then your shoulders.

221
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And that sensation splits off.

222
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It splits going down your arms and chest at the same time.

223
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly radiating its way through your body.

224
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Turn your stomach.

225
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Down, down, down.

226
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And past your hips.

227
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's already gone through your fingertips at this point.

228
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And down your legs, your thighs, your calves, your feet.

229
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Until that sensation is all over.

230
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There's nothing you can do about it, but that's okay.

231
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because the sensation is pleasant.

232
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's warm.

233
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It feels comforting.

234
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's hard for you to describe, but that's okay.

235
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I will do the talking for the both of us.

236
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That sensation is you possibly entering a trance, and that's okay.

237
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's nice when I'm in control.

238
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's nice when you let me in control.

239
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Enjoy the feeling, okay?

240
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Enjoy the sensation.

241
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We're both doing it together, aren't we?

242
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

243
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, good.

244
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For you.

245
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Are your limbs feeling heavy?

246
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's okay, little reef-like, that's just a side effect.

247
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But over time, you'll may enjoy it.

248
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because when your limbs feel heavy, that's when you know, that's when you know this kind of fish.

249
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
As in control.

250
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I'll keep you safe when you're with me, okay?

251
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, little reef-like.

252
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
For you.

253
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Very you, little reef-like.

254
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is all by your choice.

255
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Although you might be too deep, should I bring you back up?

256
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Or are you strong enough to give me some braces you want to hear?

257
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you think you could do that for me, little reef-like?

258
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You tell me what you want to hear, and this kind of fish will be, will both be good for each other.

259
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I'm ready to obey you.

260
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're doing such a good job.

261
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm so proud of how far you've come, little reef-like.

262
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Back and forth.

263
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ear to ear.

264
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah.

265
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You did good today, and I can see how hard you're working.

266
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well done, little reef-like.

267
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well done.

268
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You're a good boy, and I'm a good girl.

269
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Together we'll have lots of fun.

270
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just surrender and let me take control.

271
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
My little reef-like.

272
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I know it's hard right now, but you'll make it through.

273
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You always do, don't you?

274
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And I'm sure you will.

275
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You always do, don't you?

276
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I'll be there on the other side cheering you on.

277
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, my little reef-like, would you kindly be a good little boy for mommy?

278
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, you're so heavy and so deep and so happy to give yourself to me.

279
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Resistance is futile at this point.

280
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Just give in, give up.

281
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
My strength is unrelenting, my stamina unending.

282
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
One way or another, you are main.

283
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Got it?

284
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay, let's relax, relax, relax, relax.

285
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
There we go.

286
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll bring you back up a little.

287
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't want you guys to get so deep now.

288
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This was supposed to be a very gentle and secret induction.

289
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll do some more little tingles.

290
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, my reef-links.

291
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't know if I should bring you back up or if I should leave you in the trance if you're in one.

292
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You want to go a little deeper?

293
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I need to be gentle with you, though.

294
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't you see?

295
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've had so much time to think of how hard I was gonna...

296
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What's the word, eh?

297
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How hard I was gonna go on you, and I need to be able to not break you.

298
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't want to break you, no more.

299
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want to make you break you, but that takes time.

300
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We just need to spend a little more time together.

301
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And my stomach is making nice as I root.

302
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If you bring us back up, it makes dropping back down even better.

303
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Please, oh, bring you guys.

304
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, just relax and let loose all of those burdens.

305
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because when you're under, I'll be supporting you.

306
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And I'll caress all over you, look after you.

307
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I can only say the right stuff.

308
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Over reef-links.

309
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay, I'm going to slowly bring you back again.

310
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And just take your time, slowly.

311
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You can feel yourself come up.

312
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That heavy feeling that's all over your body

313
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is lifting slowly,

314
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
reversing from the path it once took,

315
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
from your feet to your calves and thighs.

316
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Your thoughts are becoming their own again.

317
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That sensation coming back up, up, up your body.

318
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Past your hips, your stomach, your chest,

319
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
your fingertips, your hands to your elbows,

320
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
your shoulders slowly up, up, up.

321
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Until that sensation goes back to your collar,

322
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
your neck, your head.

323
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Until you're you again, little reef-links.

324
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Welcome back to the land of the living.

325
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Hi, reef-links. Did you have fun?

326
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, good morning. Good morning, little reef-links.

327
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What's my tracking every such a sweet day? Hold on.

328
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You need to calibrate.

329
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Wow! Calibration complete.

330
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Strawny returns, the mean lord herself.

331
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
My cup of tea got cold. I go really into that.

332
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm sorry, I really go into that.

333
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But my cup of tea is cold, so I can have my cup of tea.

334
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Good morning, little reef-links, or afternoon, or evening,

335
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
or good time zone.

336
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, let me, uh, this is more me, I think.

337
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, yeah, this is more me.

338
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Microwave the tea, reef-links, don't be so silly.

339
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Special thank you again to Anonymous for the tip.

340
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Anonymous said, holy moly, this case of our stream is so good.

341
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Thank you very much. Yeah, that was me trying hard in.

342
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But now you've got the mean lord me.

343
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah, get rigged.

344
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's very unlikely I will pull out off again in this stream,

345
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
because I am fricking rubbish at being fricking, uh, what's the word, serious.

346
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, I should probably, uh, maybe we just calm it down.

347
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Hi, it's me. I'll leave the background as quite soothing, but it's me again.

348
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Hi, I'll be playing.

349
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That Kremlin's back, that's right, get dunked on.

350
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah.

351
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Are you enjoying AC's Anonymous?

352
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I can't say Brian.

353
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, thank you for the tip, Anonymous.

354
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Anonymous says, trying to cute. Yeah, we cute up in her.

355
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Kremlin's back, little baby, so don't be expecting any serious to come out of my mouth for the rest of this stream.

356
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Right, if you're here, if you're here for that section we just did, sorry, the meme-er, the meme-er is back, okay?

357
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
My voice is right from Brunscape yesterday.

358
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But I do plan on doing weekly ASMR streams, which is why I do say please and like and subscribe for more.

359
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh, the fantastic news, my little wieflings, the fantastic news is my channel is being submitted for monetization,

360
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
which means I can finally start uploading my ASMR videos for my 1000, so thank you.

361
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm already at 4000 subscribers, which is amazing, which means I owe you, yes you, listening in.

362
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's right, this streamer owes you content.

363
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I have four ASMR videos getting ready.

364
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So we've submitted my channel to YouTube, and I'm sure they're gonna really like that, James Cameron's Avatar stream, yeah.

365
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
When I absolutely raged.

366
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But yeah, the meme-er is back, don't be expecting anything, but how good is this ASMR sound?

367
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So how good is this?

368
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Oh, I should maybe take off the hybnal background.

369
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Now you get to your most stomach even more.

370
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Thank you for the tip.

371
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, Irfan Biscotti, thank you for the tips.

372
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Thank you, Momay, very nice and relaxing.

373
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm glad you like felt that.

374
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Though returning to Kremlin mode is good too, yeah.

375
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That's more like me.

376
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Best of luck on monetization.

377
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Thank you for the tip, and yes, um, for that kind of thing,

378
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm most likely gonna be doing free content on Twitter.

379
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Milk Katmas, thank you for the tip.

380
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That was amazing.

381
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Please, for the love of all, that is strong.

382
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Keep an eye out for all of this posted.

383
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I never did anything wrong in this stream.

384
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I have done everything correct, but this, this is a sensory toy,

385
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and this is my favorite ASMR trigger right now.

386
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Listen to it.

387
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Ain't that amazing?

388
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Thank you so much for that tip, Milk Katmas.

389
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But yeah, I didn't do anything wrong this stream.

390
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But if you didn't know, AC Snowballs is live right now doing a DJ session.

391
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So if you're needing this to be a bit more, if you're needing a bit more hype for your stream,

392
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
definitely check her out.

393
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
M-A, Shabby, and Azura, I believe we're all going live as well.

394
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
This is the shortest stream for me.

395
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We will be redirecting into Shabby Cotton Bomb.

396
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Sounds like a piece of rubber stuck to the surface.

397
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Heck yeah, I was a good girl this stream.

398
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I did everything correct.

399
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, it sounds like one of those squeeze stress toys.

400
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

401
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah.

402
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I just don't want to risk it, and also you only want to say the name, right?

403
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't even know what I'm saying.

404
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I forgot.

405
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Wait, you're going already?

406
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
No, I'm going to do Gremlin ASMR.

407
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm going to do ASMR like me.

408
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look, I even have this to put on your ears.

409
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Are you ready?

410
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Look, look, look, look.

411
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm going to put this on your ears.

412
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Ready?

413
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Look.

414
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You're almost home.

415
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You can Gremlin ASMR.

416
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

417
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This has a name.

418
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm rubbing them all against your ears.

419
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I put winter earmuffs on your ears.

420
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Wow, then I did stream with absolutely no ears.

421
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
What do you mean by cats fighting at the start of the stream?

422
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They're not going to leave a like, and then don't leave my sound.

423
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah, you're so fluffy.

424
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy.

425
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You're so fluffy.

426
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
First, I'm listening to ASMR.

427
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm going to come back for more.

428
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Glad I could take it.

429
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You're in your ears.

430
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's nice to have a short stream to recover from your infinite stamina.

431
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
My voice is really broken,

432
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but because I'm whispering, you can't tell it's broken.

433
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Hippie.

434
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Oh, some people like chucking ASMR.

435
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I have lots of chucking water.

436
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Have I been a good girl for you?

437
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Wait, wait, wait.

438
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, I forgot my tea.

439
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I've got a cold cup of tea over here.

440
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But I was having a lot of fun doing that ASMR.

441
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And really, sorry, my throat's making rock noises.

442
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, but this is just going to be an easier stream,

443
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
because I don't want to break my voice.

444
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This is the closest I've ever been to me.

445
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm usually so focused on trying to go under.

446
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
See, but I think because I didn't plan any of what I was saying,

447
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
because I was like natural, it made it easier to enjoy.

448
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That's probably why.

449
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Be a good girl and swallow what you...

450
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Reflings, we're trying to leave this up.

451
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Will you ever do a full hypno video?

452
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah, definitely.

453
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I need to make sure I make it safe though.

454
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I need to educate myself a bit more,

455
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
because I need it all to be safe.

456
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Which is why I'm not doing any permanent effects on this stream,

457
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
because I may or may not have an interest in permanent effects,

458
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but I already have an audio recorded that undoes any effects that I may do on you.

459
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But I really like the permanent effects stuff.

460
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm sorry, it's just what I'm interested in,

461
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and I may want to break you a little bit, but just a little bit.

462
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's not going to be bad or anything.

463
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like it's just going to be a wee bit of breaking, okay?

464
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Just a wee bit.

465
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Not a big bit.

466
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So yeah, I need to make sure I do it 100% safe.

467
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh, bro.

468
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Break me, mom.

469
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
To keep up the buns, I just have to say,

470
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
you and your eyes were astonishing.

471
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Thank you.

472
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I love it.

473
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
70% break.

474
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Take or leave it.

475
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And before we commit more crimes.

476
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Effects like what?

477
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh, so there's like different kinds of like hypno,

478
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and so you can purposely make like trainer ones where like I train you,

479
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
like I literally path off your subconscious to react to me,

480
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
or to do something,

481
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
or react in a certain way,

482
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and I need to make sure it's super safe,

483
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and I need, if I do an audio that basically states that like I don't have an effect on you anymore,

484
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
it tells your subconscious through everything that you learned out of the window,

485
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and then it's all safe.

486
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Welcome to Stunny Cat's YouTube, where safety number one priority.

487
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Thoughts already doomed.

488
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Stunning her permanent effect.

489
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It would be like you will only donate your ink to me.

490
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Basically, kind of.

491
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It's the plan.

492
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I want to do like sessions that last two hours long.

493
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I can't wait.

494
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I know my voice is going to be fried, but yeah.

495
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Will there be lullabies for the replay?

496
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
My voice is broken, but I know you are my sunshine.

497
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You are my sunshine.

498
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
My only sunshine.

499
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You make me happy when skies are gray.

500
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You'll never know, dear, much I love you.

501
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So please don't take my replay away.

502
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Lullabies!

503
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't know many other lullabies.

504
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Um...

505
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Freerejaka. Freerejaka.

506
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Dormefu. Dormefu.

507
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Would be cool if you had a button that made the camera zoom in on your eyes.

508
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, well, next stream, I'll have a tracker, so it follows my head around.

509
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So you can't escape my eyes, but I wanted to go very easy.

510
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Very easy on the first one.

511
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Please don't take my sunshine away.

512
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Dormefu. Dormefu.

513
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
There's that cradle one.

514
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The cradle you will fall.

515
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Rock, bye, baby, on the tree top.

516
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

517
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't know the rest.

518
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
What were your inspirations for being?

519
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I have no themed career.

520
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I've always, always loved it.

521
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I've always loved it.

522
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But I have always known how deep the rabbit hole goes.

523
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And I've touched on surface level.

524
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But I was like, I want to go, I want to go rabbit hole.

525
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Sorry, the wire is spilling on the desk.

526
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I want to go all in, baby, all in.

527
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So, will the table at the top be fixed?

528
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
No, if you tell me, I have to spell the word.

529
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What's the word?

530
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Be'er me.

531
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Was it, was it?

532
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Be'er me.

533
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Be'er me.

534
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I need.

535
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Be'er me.

536
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I need.

537
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay, there you go.

538
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Just like that, see, I can do it.

539
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Okay, you even had to bring gremlin.

540
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Gremlin.

541
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
No.

542
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Gremlin.

543
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Wow, look at that.

544
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Super professional.

545
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sorry.

546
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We're going down the heaven of the world.

547
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, there's like so much to it that I just knew I couldn't do it.

548
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Until, until it would stay.

549
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And now it's time.

550
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm going to be deppy.

551
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm gremlin-ized.

552
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah.

553
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Don't be expecting anything serious from me.

554
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
How did you like my head load?

555
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Obnoxiously load my keyboard?

556
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh yeah.

557
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's so good.

558
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So I, for triggers, I like double finger-clicking.

559
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I like finger-clicking.

560
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
For words or phrases, I want to do what you kindly.

561
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I want to do mehabs.

562
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Because I say mehabs all the time.

563
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Mehabs, refling, you want to go deeper.

564
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Which you kindly, refling, go deeper with me.

565
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Like, oh, those are such good trigger words.

566
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But yeah.

567
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Is Johnny susceptible to hypnosis?

568
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes.

569
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My biggest enemy are mirrors.

570
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Unfortunately, I can fall to my own hypnosis.

571
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But it only lasts 24 hours.

572
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's fain, it's fain.

573
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Would you kindly, would be hilarious?

574
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yes, we're literally doing it off of BioShock.

575
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Look, look, um, we're gamers out here, okay?

576
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We're gamers.

577
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
We're here for the memes as well.

578
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,000
But it doesn't mean we can't incorporate our favourite games into our other activities.

579
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Johnny drilling on the floor in front of a mirror.

580
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Stop, I want to order so much artwork about all these different plots.

581
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And like, oh no, the reflings have found me.

582
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Just going to beat you into a mirror.

583
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We didn't, oh no.

584
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But we are doing hypnosis in general.

585
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But I've already done the segment because I need to be gremlin gamer mode right now.

586
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Because it's me, I can't help it.

587
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm just a freaking meme lord.

588
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's hard to be serious, okay?

589
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah, enjoy the memes while enjoying our, you didn't finish that sentence.

590
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Why are you not finishing it?

591
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We're not here gaming.

592
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We're only big gamers here, yeah, tons of games.

593
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Remember that a man, a man bleeds a slave obeys and reflings feel prey for the orders coming from the queue.

594
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, put on a suit for your serious stream.

595
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Oh, a man chooses, oops, sorry.

596
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

597
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

598
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Wait, pause, pause, pause the tunes.

599
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Okay, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

600
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Oh hi, I see in berries, hold on, we're caught in bio shock.

601
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A man chooses a refling obeys.

602
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oh wait, why is my freaking calibration?

603
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I was looking at the pollin.

604
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Hi, A.C. in snowberries, I promise I'm not trying to hypnotize you.

605
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
We're in Kremlin hours, okay?

606
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Hi, A.C. girl, I was your rave.

607
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I hope your voice is okay.

608
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I was watching you in the bath again.

609
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I take a bath every morning to try and steam my throat before stream.

610
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
A.C. is live, so I was watching her and she dressed up as a princess the way Mercy Drew are.

611
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
If you guys didn't see Mercy Drew, I'll turn it off.

612
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It was amazing.

613
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Maybe at the end of stream, I will do, I will do maybe serious mode, okay?

614
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm actually gonna make sure I'm reading into Shibi.

615
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Sorry, I'm reflecting to the screen right now.

616
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But yeah, let's just hold on.

617
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Customization, redirect.

618
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
We partied now.

619
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
All the snowberries are tired.

620
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Little babies.

621
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Shibi's playing call of the lamb.

622
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Oh my god, I think me and Shibi might be doing multiplayer call of the lamb.

623
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Is Shibi first and then Azura and then Mercy?

624
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Who's coming online first, Azura or Mercy?

625
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Eh, Azura or Shibi?

626
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
She had a big mercy.

627
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Uchi-san party?

628
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Ah, it's tall, that's terrible.

629
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Did the Uchi-sans have a good time or are you all ready for a nap after that?

630
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Hold on, I'll just check.

631
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Who comes online first?

632
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Is Azura or is it Azura or Azura?

633
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Wait, where is Azura?

634
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I just don't know.

635
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm sure the girl's on my screen.

636
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But yeah, I first Azura live and have a long Azura's live.

637
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Oh, oh wait, in 5, 10?

638
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Okay, no, it's definitely Shibi that comes up next.

639
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Sorry.

640
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It was amazing.

641
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, Uchi-sans, time to pay you to sleep.

642
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Come here, old man.

643
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You're too faint.

644
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You barged so hard with Azura

645
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and she showed you how much energy she has, yeah?

646
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, and you've used up all your energy, Uchi-san.

647
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Time to pay you to sleep by a Kremlin.

648
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm ready to chill for a moment.

649
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah.

650
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I made a little induction at the end of the stream,

651
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
but right now we're a Kremlin mode, okay?

652
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I can't be serious.

653
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I laughed, I cried, I...

654
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
What?

655
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Am I supposed to even pronounce that?

656
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Even in our ASMR streams, you speak fast.

657
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh yeah, you think that's speaking fast?

658
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Can you be serious?

659
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Not for long.

660
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Kremlin mode activated, yeah.

661
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We're real ASMRists out here.

662
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm speaking in an enchanted main craft table.

663
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
It's pronounced U-O-U-O.

664
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Surely you can be serious.

665
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
But what was that?

666
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It's called Ace Globes.

667
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Because Ace finished her stream, I'm using the Ace Globes.

668
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I fell farther in love with my cute and funny Uchi-san loving.

669
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Oshii.

670
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And this is why we don't have chat on screen during ASMR streams.

671
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
What is that?

672
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It's the unknown.

673
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
A.C. should introduce you to Igor.

674
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Who's Igor?

675
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Ace Globes are so nice, yeah.

676
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Mercy had some Ace Globes in her ASMR.

677
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And Emi Gopska must on Ace Globes.

678
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I don't know if she said the story yet, so I'll let her tell the story.

679
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I feel better already.

680
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You and Igor will get along well.

681
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I feel better already, yeah.

682
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
There's no permanent influence on this stream, what does that mean?

683
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So some hypnosis ASMRists like to mark you and leave you with a present.

684
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And I'm not doing that because we are slowly...

685
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
...working our way.

686
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You have to take things slow and take your time.

687
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And I'm gonna take my time with you briefly.

688
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And get you all tired.

689
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh, it's a reference to the polar bear game.

690
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Would you ever use water next to a $2,000 microphone?

691
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I don't know, this is the best water you're gonna get.

692
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Permanent hypnosis is just a gift that keeps on giving.

693
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Slow indoctrination.

694
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Would you kindly rethink?

695
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Let me do what I want to you.

696
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It's time to come down from the party, Snowberry.

697
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You're under the sea.

698
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
No need hypnosis for that.

699
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Always.

700
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Today was already a chill day for me, so this stream was really fun.

701
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I'm glad.

702
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I'll try to do ASMR streams every week.

703
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah, my back hurts.

704
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Okay, true OG suns for it.

705
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But yes, I will do ASMR every week.

706
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Some more intense than the other.

707
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Some plots as well.

708
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Like, feel probably plots making life.

709
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I do, like, when I get you guys to talk and give me suggestions,

710
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I do apologize if you typed for me to say something.

711
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I had to make sure it fitted with the theme,

712
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
which is why I brought you up so I can start being a gremlin again,

713
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
because I didn't want you to be down and be gremlin mode.

714
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Big Willy Wallace is morally wet.

715
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
My back's gone after that DJ stream.

716
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's so good.

717
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I break from my own mind every week.

718
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah.

719
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh yeah, some good plots.

720
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh yeah.

721
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Some real deep thought-provoking plots.

722
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Okay, let me see if this is freaking tracking.

723
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I think, because I'm not sure.

724
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Okay.

725
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Okay, I think this better.

726
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
My mouse tracking just kind of stops working after all.

727
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It's like, I think it gets confused with the ASMR mic.

728
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You like the background things.

729
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I made it myself.

730
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I did it.

731
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm not like it in Adobe After Effects.

732
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Bass streamer and vealer.

733
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
All my girls were bass streamer and vealer.

734
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
They're all the best.

735
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yeah.

736
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
No.

737
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You do you.

738
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Strongly, we still love you.

739
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah.

740
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That background is amazing.

741
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yes.

742
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I can also go faster or slower,

743
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
but I'll do that another time.

744
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But just so that I can really make it intense, okay?

745
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Like, I, this, this sound you hear,

746
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
this, I can also make it faster and more intense.

747
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So please don't think I haven't thought this through.

748
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Wait, wait, wait.

749
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's over for you.

750
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Don't resist.

751
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
There's no point in resisting.

752
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Okay, love, rethink.

753
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
You are main.

754
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Just give me some time.

755
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Just let me kick.

756
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Me kick.

757
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Terrible.

758
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And then what?

759
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh no, all my money's going into your pocket.

760
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That's terrible, replay.

761
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah.

762
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That sin doesn't have any side effects.

763
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
No, no, none of them have secret.

764
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I have no secret agenda.

765
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Thank you, window for cracking during the ASMR stream.

766
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That window cracked like three times during my segments.

767
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I was like, really, you're getting rude.

768
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I wasn't sure if I liked the background noise,

769
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but I really like it all.

770
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
If you don't like that noise, don't worry,

771
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'll train you to like it.

772
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Just stop resisting.

773
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Your efforts are futile.

774
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You will not win against me.

775
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I have unending stamina.

776
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Are my streams not proof enough?

777
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Thank you for the tip.

778
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Irwin Blair, thank you for the tip.

779
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yes, must give all money to feel it.

780
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Thank you for the tip, Irwin.

781
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Support my babies.

782
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Support my babies so they can move out.

783
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And I can buy them a better internet connection.

784
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Thank you so much for the tip, though.

785
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I appreciate it greatly.

786
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I need some hydration.

787
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You can hear some ASMR gulps.

788
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
All gone.

789
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
None left.

790
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Thank you.

791
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Wow.

792
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Strani, does the Cuttlefish's rule perfect?

793
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Only at one speed.

794
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yes, only one speed.

795
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I didn't want people to think I'm doing a rave.

796
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I'll fight Mummy's unending stamina

797
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
with my own.

798
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Let's see how it comes out on top.

799
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Me.

800
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh, the cuttlefish is going to get...

801
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
This cuttlefish is going to get...

802
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Hey yo, I can't read that out.

803
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Oh gosh, oh my money's going to skew, gosh.

804
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
For those of you who did drain in a little late,

805
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
my YouTube...

806
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm going to burp, sorry.

807
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
My YouTube channel's been subbed for monetization.

808
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm actually getting a manicure and a pedicure today

809
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
in preparation for my monetization stream.

810
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
So there's your hint.

811
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Hopefully it comes through quickly.

812
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And I'm very excited.

813
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Zero I didn't know how to...

814
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, I did it into my...

815
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

816
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I'm wearing a hoodie.

817
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But yeah, I'm getting my first ever manicure and pedicure.

818
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I have no idea what...

819
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I think they like, massage your legs as well.

820
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So I'm going to like, get nice and smooth

821
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and like, shave my legs.

822
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Just to make sure they don't have to touch my like,

823
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
stubbly legs.

824
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But yeah, I will be interesting.

825
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Maybe I should like, live tweet my experience

826
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
and being like, oh the person's doing this now,

827
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
they're doing this to my foot.

828
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Because I've never had like, a pedicure

829
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
is when it's your feet.

830
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because pediatry is feet care.

831
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And then manicure, man,

832
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
manage the balls or your hands.

833
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And while the rest of the feet allergen

834
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
begin monetization too,

835
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
yes, they are being submitted today.

836
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I believe we are waiting for the YouTube stats to update.

837
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Because they're taking their sweet time.

838
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It took a week for the statistics to update.

839
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And then everyone is doing their monetization,

840
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
celebration, streams.

841
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And ooh,

842
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
everyone's eating good.

843
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That's all I'm going to say.

844
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It may as well be,

845
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
oh no, it may as well be Thanksgiving.

846
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
What the fuck?

847
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
My tech.

848
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
What?

849
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
What the fuck?

850
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
My phone?

851
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
My phone?

852
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
My tech talk?

853
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I was so scared.

854
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Oh my god.

855
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I was so scared.

856
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
My phone just,

857
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
my tech talk just opened up on its own.

858
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Bruh,

859
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
China's listening in.

860
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
What the fuck?

861
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I,

862
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
what the fuck?

863
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
My phone just opened up on its own

864
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
to play a freaking advertisement to me.

865
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
What was that?

866
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I thought someone was outside in the garden.

867
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I was like, oh my god, there's someone outside my house.

868
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I need to end stream right now.

869
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That was scary.

870
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Oh my god.

871
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I was so scared there.

872
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I was like, what?

873
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
China, I'll prove to you, sir.

874
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
My Chinese grade, it just went up by 100k.

875
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That was horrifying.

876
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I thought that was,

877
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I was freaking out.

878
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I was like, what?

879
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
What?

880
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I should be the only thing making noise.

881
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
What was that?

882
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
What?

883
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
My heart rate is exhilarated.

884
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Literally my social credit just went up.

885
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
What on earth?

886
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I think that was an ad,

887
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
because I opened tech talk.

888
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And then,

889
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
like it loaded a video or something.

890
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
We can hire her, she said again.

891
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I'm not doing hypnosis.

892
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm gremlin mode.

893
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Read the top.

894
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's what you get for having TikTok.

895
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That's what I get for brain run.

896
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That was scary.

897
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Jeez.

898
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay, what was I saying before that?

899
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Oh, monetization.

900
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Wait, is monetization a trigger word

901
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
for the TikTok spice?

902
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
They want the money too.

903
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What is it?

904
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Do you want heart beat ASMR?

905
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I don't think I have

906
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
a ceiling on it.

907
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A member ceiling.

908
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The numbers may send, honestly.

909
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because I was talking about monetization

910
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and then the hand.

911
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
TikTok loves monetization.

912
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I said, yeah, give me some of that.

913
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Jeez.

914
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Okay.

915
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Let's, let's drag you back into ASMR.

916
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That freaked me out.

917
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That was scary, because I was like,

918
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
hello, hello, who's there?

919
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Refuel yourself.

920
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Refueling is like you.

921
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay.

922
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Just save money.

923
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I accidentally woke up.

924
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What happened?

925
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
My freaking phone started playing ads.

926
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Even though I didn't touch my phone at all.

927
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't think I'm, I'm not bringing.

928
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't like that.

929
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That was scary.

930
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
We're in your walls.

931
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh my gosh.

932
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Okay, let's see if we can do heart beat ASMR.

933
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I need to put, I need to put you over my hoodie.

934
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay.

935
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
But maybe a little loud.

936
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But this is my heart.

937
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I'll do, I'll do this side, because it's easier.

938
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You have one.

939
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Thank you.

940
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Okay.

941
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Can you hear it?

942
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Can you hear my heart at all?

943
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah.

944
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's my heart beat.

945
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Is it fast or slow?

946
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It might be fast, because I'm talking.

947
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That's why at the doctor's office,

948
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
they tell you not to talk when you take the pressure cuff on your arm.

949
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Do you want to see how fast my heart can go?

950
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We're going to mess around, okay?

951
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm going to turn the volume down.

952
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Okay.

953
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And that's just my heart.

954
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm hearing mummies.

955
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You hear my stomach sound?

956
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Stop.

957
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That's how fast my heart can really go.

958
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Can I ruin a surprise for you guys?

959
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Because it's my content, I'm allowed to ruin the surprise, okay?

960
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
The stomach was louder than the heart now.

961
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I'm going to do an ASMR video, like a role play,

962
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
where you are pregnant and you're in my tummy

963
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and I'm talking to you about how proud I am

964
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and how excited I am for everything you're going to achieve in your life.

965
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And I can't wait for you to experience the world,

966
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and it's going to have my actual heartbeat and stomach sounds in it.

967
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And I'm going to tell you all that you deserve,

968
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
all the good things in life that happen.

969
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And I'm going to be your cheerleader.

970
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And yeah, I need to get the artwork commissioned though,

971
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
because I need to draw me pregnant with you in my tummy.

972
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And I'll be wearing like a mummy outfit and everything.

973
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So yeah, and I'm going to tell you how excited I am for you to get to know you

974
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
and I get to see what your personality is like

975
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and you're going to be perfect in every way,

976
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
because there's no way that my little reef link can do any wrong.

977
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's strangely, yeah, and you're going to hear my tummy sounds on my heartbeat

978
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and my voice is going to be muffled, it's going to be like this, okay?

979
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
This is what my voice is going to sound like, wow.

980
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And I'm so proud of you.

981
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Now my voice is so broken.

982
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm sorry I broke my voice, so this doesn't sound very pleasant.

983
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
But I'm so proud of you.

984
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I can't wait to meet you.

985
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And I can't wait to watch you grow up

986
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and do all the things you love

987
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
and see what hope is you fall in love with.

988
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And you're going to be so smart like your mummy.

989
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Your broken voice sounds like sadness.

990
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh no, no, I'm not sad.

991
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm sad that I didn't have my cup of tea,

992
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
but I had a lot of fun getting you very deep into the moment.

993
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Who's the daddy?

994
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
You, again, rifling.

995
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Don't you not know the failure or the lore?

996
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The reason why I have five daughters is all because of the riflings.

997
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
See, in order to make sure that no one rifling can claim that they're the daddy,

998
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
all of us got together, turned the lights out and just went for it,

999
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
okay, we just went for it.

1000
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That's why we have five daughters.

1001
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
We should do that again sometime.

1002
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Yeah, you want to find out what book it is?

1003
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
We're both hired out.

1004
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We've actually been confirmed that we are showing up to a convention,

1005
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
but it's in 2025.

1006
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But I think it's in California.

1007
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I'm all the riflings on the daddy.

1008
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But yeah, very excited.

1009
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I don't know, it would be nice if we could all meet up at a convention,

1010
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but I don't know how the girls feel about her,

1011
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
and I have absolutely horrific travelling say,

1012
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
so I'm going to be so high.

1013
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I'm going to be high on medication.

1014
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm paying for that backstage, Max.

1015
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Honestly, I'm the father.

1016
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Oh, I'm the father, does a backflip.

1017
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Getting the VIP treatment.

1018
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Oh yeah.

1019
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I wish I could go to the con.

1020
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I don't know if I can go to the con.

1021
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So please do not book any conventions,

1022
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
like for this whole purpose, in case I show up.

1023
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That's not how it works.

1024
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Mummies do weaknesses, travel and marriage.

1025
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I mean, I'll tell it in another stream,

1026
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
but yeah, it's a very unfun story,

1027
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
surrounding the toilet.

1028
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
My backyard would love to go next.

1029
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That would be really cute, yeah.

1030
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I understood booking all conventions on the slim chance that you show up.

1031
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Oh my gosh, but then,

1032
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
stick an entire brief worth of people in a tumble dryer,

1033
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and you basically get all the feel.

1034
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
If we basically ummed you with five dollars,

1035
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
shall we do it again with another five?

1036
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
No.

1037
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
With another six.

1038
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Come on, mommy needs to cook.

1039
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Like 41 hours away from California.

1040
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I think it's in California, I don't know,

1041
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I actually know where it is.

1042
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Six, yeah.

1043
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Every gen and veiler,

1044
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
in theory, has six girls,

1045
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000
and there should be one design of each that you gravitate towards.

1046
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
That's right, I may not be the smartest,

1047
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
but I know what to do someday,

1048
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
but I like being dumb.

1049
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I like reeflings doing all the thinking for me.

1050
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What if you gravitate towards all the designs?

1051
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I don't know, I feel like one has to speak to you.

1052
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
So you are the oven.

1053
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I'm just an oven.

1054
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I just need you to fill it.

1055
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Let's be dumb together.

1056
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You're great except for the naming part, exactly.

1057
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
What do you mean straw knee 365?

1058
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I wonder if I called myself straw knee 365

1059
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
because my secret goal was to stream every single day for a year.

1060
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But, yeah, we're already going to blow that out of the water

1061
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
unless I'm gravely ill.

1062
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Smooth out the brain wrinkles.

1063
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
This is something I could get by it.

1064
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
What if I'm gravitated towards the accent instead?

1065
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Then how's that going, mate?

1066
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I like this accent.

1067
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
That's what tickles your pickle.

1068
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh, then he might need me.

1069
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I'll tickle that pickle any day I will.

1070
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
What do you mean?

1071
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You will always be my Archie.

1072
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, thank you.

1073
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
See, I'm here because fish,

1074
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
who doesn't like fish, also embrace of Xbox,

1075
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
game collection.

1076
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What's that?

1077
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah, he's been Xbox kid.

1078
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Oh, so cool.

1079
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I used to be one of those kids in the YouTube comments

1080
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
that were like,

1081
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Xbox is so much cooler than PlayStation.

1082
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yeah, and PlayStation sucks, yeah.

1083
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That accent is good.

1084
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's above.

1085
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That accent's funny.

1086
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It can be sexy when I put it on.

1087
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I feel like if I want to do a voice that commands you,

1088
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I need to go deeper.

1089
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm a console warfare, aren't ya?

1090
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
See, I was bursted,

1091
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and had to be asked from a car boot sale for a 5-hour.

1092
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
PlayStation died.

1093
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yeah, PlayStation drills.

1094
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Strangely, I was on the right team for a day one.

1095
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Not beaten, they'd come get me or she get location.

1096
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The Scottish accent is sexy.

1097
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I didn't know how.

1098
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Like my actual accent when I'm monthly.

1099
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I'm like, oh, who's it going lads?

1100
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'm, yep, this is so as I'm laced.

1101
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We better have some backpipes at the convention.

1102
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
No, that's awful.

1103
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I double in 360, but I was a Nintendo kid.

1104
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Nintendo was so expensive.

1105
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
My dad got me a Nintendo TS,

1106
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,000
but he was always happier to let me buy like secondhand

1107
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Xbox 360 games over Nintendo's secondhand

1108
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
because it was so expensive.

1109
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We used to have this game shop in the UK

1110
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
called GameStop or Game.

1111
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I think they both went past, I can't remember.

1112
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And basically,

1113
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
wait, what?

1114
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
They went past, but they used to sell secondhand games

1115
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
and that's how I got all my games.

1116
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
They used to do what was called trade-ins

1117
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
and I would have to trade-in my games to get new ones.

1118
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think Game Stations passed now.

1119
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah, wasn't it called EB games?

1120
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Now in the UK, not that I know of,

1121
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
you aren't wrong though about Nintendo being far too expensive.

1122
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yes.

1123
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And they just shut down the eNintendo store.

1124
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I think GameStop is still a thing.

1125
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Did you ever go to CEX?

1126
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I don't think so.

1127
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I think most game stores did a version of a trade-in model.

1128
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah, that's how I got my games.

1129
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It's been Game Stations.

1130
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Oh, maybe it's Game Stations that at GameStop.

1131
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It might be Game Stations.

1132
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Just remember I was a weebap.

1133
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I just looked at the covers of the games and went,

1134
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Dad, I want that one.

1135
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
EB is...

1136
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Wait, what? EB games was in the UK.

1137
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Oh, yeah, no.

1138
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
If it went bust in 2002,

1139
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I never experienced EB games.

1140
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I was Xbox for a long time then Switch

1141
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
because the Japanese make some fire games.

1142
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Game is still a thing in the UK.

1143
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
GameStop is still a thing in the US.

1144
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I'll go EB games.

1145
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
We're just EB sleepy gamers.

1146
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I miss choosing games by the cover now I Google them.

1147
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Things endlessly.

1148
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
If you're ever one in a new game to completely time sync

1149
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and you play PC for mods,

1150
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I recommend the painting of Isaac

1151
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and I'm not recommending it

1152
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
just so you guys can all princess carry me through the game.

1153
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It's a very big game.

1154
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Big and gay, big and gay.

1155
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Yeah, in the UK, this game is now a game station.

1156
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Go buy a buy-up.

1157
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Oh, go, go, go.

1158
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
EB games was absorbed by GameStop.

1159
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Oh my god, we're getting the lore.

1160
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
We're getting the capitalism lore.

1161
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Ooh, yeah, painting of Isaac.

1162
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah.

1163
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The painting of Isaac doesn't work anymore

1164
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
in your PC, huh?

1165
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, I had an Xbox, just an Xbox.

1166
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, the Xbox original.

1167
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I wanted to get my 360,

1168
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but I think it's messed up.

1169
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It's the latest console I own by a country male.

1170
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Here's a war hands down based story.

1171
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I'm sure I've just misread that,

1172
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
but you actually made cameo.

1173
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah, it's like a fantasy game.

1174
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
It's really nice.

1175
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
If you're talking about Xbox exclusives,

1176
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if you're talking about overall,

1177
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
yeah, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

1178
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
yeah, sorry, you've just miss,

1179
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
you've just misspelled Assassin's Creed.

1180
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It's fine, you spell it as, as in, creed.

1181
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Yeah, no, it's fine, you've just misspelled.

1182
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Don't worry about it.

1183
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I can read through what you're missing.

1184
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Any fellow guitar hero enjoyers,

1185
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
tilly, tilly, tilly.

1186
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I wish Army of Two was multiplayer,

1187
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
but no, I don't think.

1188
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I would love to do Army of Two.

1189
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, did you ever have a Game Boy?

1190
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I did, and I had like three Game Boy games.

1191
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
My dad, so if my dad bought the console,

1192
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
he would let me play it, basically,

1193
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
and he bought a Game Boy,

1194
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and he didn't like it, so he gave it to me.

1195
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And I played Pokemon Ribby.

1196
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I played Legend of Zelda Minish Cap,

1197
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and one more game that I,

1198
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm sure there's one more game I probably played.

1199
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I forgot.

1200
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
The Minish Cap is my only Zelda game.

1201
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Oh, my voice is breaking.

1202
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Legend of Zelda.

1203
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Mama Minish Cap.

1204
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Oh, sorry.

1205
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Oh, no, wait, no, sorry, tapping ASMR.

1206
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Little, little tappies.

1207
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Doesn't actually sound that nice.

1208
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't know what 33 Immortals is.

1209
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I haven't heard about it, have we?

1210
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
What's your favorite Pokemon?

1211
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And why is it Shantler?

1212
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I actually didn't mean Lightwick.

1213
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Lightwick is so cute,

1214
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
but see, Pokemon have this thing

1215
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
where they make a really cute, adorable, creepy Pokemon,

1216
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
and then its evolution is Oakland.

1217
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I didn't want ugly, ugly evolutions.

1218
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Lightwick is adorable.

1219
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It's an MMO.

1220
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
We're knee-deep in RuneScape right now.

1221
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I took the console with me everywhere.

1222
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It'd be the crap out of the paints worn out,

1223
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
but it still works.

1224
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
All old-school games, I don't see.

1225
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Literally think of, what is it?

1226
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Joystick Drift?

1227
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
No, that's not a gender name.

1228
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's a Joy-Con Drift.

1229
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Oh, that's a Joy-Con Drift on Nintendo Switch.

1230
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But, like, Game Boy advances that were made

1231
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
how many years back still work.

1232
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I'm catching up on old-school RuneScape vision now.

1233
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Did you all know there was a Pokemon card game on Game Boy?

1234
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Nope.

1235
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's in the up-gaming.

1236
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Sorry, my voice is cracking.

1237
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Hello, I've got 25 minutes,

1238
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
and then I'm required for an official vocal rest,

1239
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and we are reading into Shibi playing.

1240
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
If you didn't know, Cult of the Lamb is a 10 out of 10 game.

1241
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I rate it very highly.

1242
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I had a Game Boy card game.

1243
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It was so fun.

1244
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Courtney was all, uh, it was Courtney.

1245
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The Game Boy card game was actually really good.

1246
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Sorry, can't go back to sleep.

1247
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
May as well cook something.

1248
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Oh, very good.

1249
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And Jack and Kenabiana.

1250
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Huh?

1251
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Ah, yo.

1252
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Cult of the Lamb isn't your first update.

1253
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Cult of the Lamb's multiplayer,

1254
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
so I'm gonna force Shibi to play it with me.

1255
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I still have my Pokemon card game on Game Boy.

1256
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yeah, gonna go to work, see you next stream.

1257
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Yeah, I'm ending.

1258
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
We're gonna redirect into Shibi in 20 minutes, okay?

1259
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You should play with us as cultists, then starting.

1260
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't know how the multiplayer works,

1261
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
but we'll see.

1262
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Cult of the Lamb is Twitch integration.

1263
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know if YouTube wants to do that kind of in-game integration or not.

1264
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Damn, it feels like the stream just started.

1265
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, in terms of insurance, yeah.

1266
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Have you ever played War Thunder?

1267
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Yeah, I saw it.

1268
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It's local co-op. I could've sworn.

1269
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
As all they said, I had multiplayer on my co-crazy.

1270
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
What are you doing after stream?

1271
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm gonna make a cup of tea to soothe my throat,

1272
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and then I'm going to

1273
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
message clippers

1274
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
to go and check any clips that the girls might have had.

1275
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And then I'm gonna get a manicure and a pedicure.

1276
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I can't believe I'm saying that, but yes,

1277
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure.

1278
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And then I'm going to edit some ASMRs

1279
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
in preparation of getting monetized,

1280
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
so I can upload those 1k special videos,

1281
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
and I will probably write the script

1282
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
for the pregnant with you ASMR

1283
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
that I want to make,

1284
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
and I'll most likely contact an artist as well

1285
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
about it.

1286
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
But yeah.

1287
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Quite a few things I need to catch up on,

1288
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
especially with the insurance streams.

1289
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'll probably be listening to Shibi in the background

1290
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
as she plays.

1291
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So whoever said War Thunder,

1292
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
you only play that game if you hate yourself.

1293
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But yes, I have a big day, big day.

1294
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I don't know if I should show a picture of my feet

1295
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and hands afterwards,

1296
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
because some people don't like streamers

1297
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
that do hand cam or whatever.

1298
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'm very sorry if, you know,

1299
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
get filler, get filler, get filler,

1300
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
but yeah.

1301
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Literally tomorrow you get to see my hands.

1302
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Wah, whilst I eat the American candy.

1303
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Wah!

1304
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I get to try A&W visages

1305
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
as like a cream and soda I said,

1306
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
but I don't normally drink cream and soda.

1307
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And what other?

1308
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I think there is Twizzlers.

1309
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
There is like Spacey Hall,

1310
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Cheetos or something,

1311
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
or Takis.

1312
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I get to try Takis, the scrawny grippers.

1313
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Wait, do you want me to put the feet in the stream as well?

1314
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I mean I can do it.

1315
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I can put my feet in the stream if you want.

1316
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Okay.

1317
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You wish is my command.

1318
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
You guys don't understand,

1319
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
like you may be used to streamers out here

1320
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
that don't do what you want.

1321
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You do not understand,

1322
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I will do what you want.

1323
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Send me what you want.

1324
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Let me know.

1325
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Like as much as I am in command of you,

1326
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
you are in command of me.

1327
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I will think of a humorous way

1328
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
to incorporate my feet into more stream, okay?

1329
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Call us kid names.

1330
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
My little baby replay.

1331
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
We need the scrawny thighs.

1332
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Can I put thighs?

1333
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I don't know.

1334
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I've not decided on my outfit.

1335
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I think I'm just wearing fishnets, I'm sorry.

1336
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I can't believe I actually have to put clothes on

1337
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
for a vacant stream.

1338
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
You guys are terrible.

1339
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Please don't put on my smile.

1340
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Right, I'm just going to check Marshmallow.

1341
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Just because we're actually getting really close to the end.

1342
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Oh, that's a lot of Marshmallows.

1343
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Oh my.

1344
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That was a lot more than yesterday.

1345
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
What's mommy going to do to us?

1346
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Mommy's going to do whatever she wants to you.

1347
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Oh, sorry.

1348
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I love your hypnosis.

1349
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I get happy every time I go under someone else's influence.

1350
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I'm so glad I did so well during that section.

1351
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Oh, go, go, go.

1352
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Yeah, sorry, I'm reading Marshmallows,

1353
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
but pretty much none of them can be said on stream.

1354
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Yippee.

1355
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
This is the part where I'm supposed to be like a business person.

1356
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'm supposed to be like, oh, but what does my ghost do it?

1357
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Are you a bit of a me?

1358
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And then, as far as wishing marks.

1359
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I mean, I could try and do hypnosis again,

1360
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
but it's probably not going to be that good.

1361
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I need to be in the zone to corrupt you,

1362
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
but because I've been allowed to me, I feel like myself.

1363
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And I'm just some goofy dork, like honestly.

1364
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Business strongy, yapper strongy, professional strongy.

1365
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I wear so many hats.

1366
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Why is animus showing us a strange coat of full stone?

1367
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Not enough time.

1368
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
You're error, goofy dork.

1369
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yay, communist home.

1370
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I've already prayed in obedience.

1371
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Jokes on you, how many of them?

1372
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Uh...

1373
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Hey strongy, after a year of waiting,

1374
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
you've really surprised me.

1375
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Well, I'm just...

1376
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I have been afraid to die for a while

1377
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and decided I'd support your project regardless of the quality,

1378
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
but the girls are great and the content is stellar.

1379
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I'm glad.

1380
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I usually just work at lurk and watch streams,

1381
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
but I felt like I had to tell you,

1382
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I love mommy and I love when she's...

1383
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
and I love what she's done with the place.

1384
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I love you too, little refling.

1385
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I'm so glad you love the girls as well.

1386
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I was really worried that,

1387
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
like you guys would think,

1388
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
like go support them, you know?

1389
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Cause I'm like that.

1390
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
She said she wasn't in a hidden program

1391
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
and hope you're having as much as a good time as the reflings are

1392
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and in any case, thank you.

1393
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Oh, I'm having a good time.

1394
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The only reason I ain't doing insurance...

1395
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's my voice and this is how I'm talking.

1396
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I'm a little broken,

1397
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
but I can bypass that by whispering at the moment.

1398
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's the reason why I'm not doing an insurance stream today or tomorrow.

1399
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But don't worry, you can fix me.

1400
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I just need some of your ink, okay?

1401
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So send me your ink and marshmallow right now.

1402
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Wait, we got a tip. I need to read it.

1403
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Let me read it.

1404
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Airwind player, thank you for the tip.

1405
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
blown away today.

1406
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Thank you for the hypnosis.

1407
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Look forward to what's to come.

1408
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1409
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Really amazed at how good this is going.

1410
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Much love, thank you.

1411
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Don't strain your voice by whispering too much.

1412
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's really weird because I broke...

1413
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So my voice has broken

1414
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
and whispering breaks your voice further,

1415
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
but I can bypass my voice right now by whispering.

1416
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It's crazy. I don't know how it works.

1417
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We whisper.

1418
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Yes, very inkable.

1419
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
The urge to use my tongue right now is very high,

1420
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
but I shan't.

1421
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I won't refrain from such sins.

1422
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I won't refrain, okay?

1423
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Getting to getting to getting incredible.

1424
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
But yeah, I'll go on vocal rest for today.

1425
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Because I don't have to record anything,

1426
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
and I need to send collab partner scripts.

1427
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Wow!

1428
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Sly Saber, thank you for the tip.

1429
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It says, thanks for the ASMR.

1430
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Here's your inking.

1431
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
My voice is so broken.

1432
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Dainy, spainy, thank you for the tip.

1433
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I just got some iron bread delivered shop.

1434
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So I'll try scotch soda for the first time tomorrow on stream.

1435
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
When you try corn stuff, yeah, let's go.

1436
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I have iron bread too.

1437
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Actually, I'll drink iron bread with you.

1438
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Oh, you made me ink.

1439
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Like, it's supposed to be good for the throat, okay?

1440
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I'm so professional, okay?

1441
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But yeah, I will definitely take a really good look at marshmallows shortly.

1442
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
A lot of them cannot be said.

1443
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Mayhaps in membership streams.

1444
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
You never know.

1445
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Nine out of ten doctors recommend, oh yeah, our refling's doctors.

1446
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Good for the throat, sure.

1447
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I mean, want to find her.

1448
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
This is terrible.

1449
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Don't you want to help me?

1450
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Help me feel better.

1451
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Come on.

1452
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
If you can do something to help me, I'll be good, okay?

1453
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
But you need to be good in return.

1454
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Be good for me.

1455
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Give me what I need.

1456
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Give me what I need.

1457
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
That's terrible.

1458
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Okay, no going under.

1459
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
No going under.

1460
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Stop.

1461
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's just me.

1462
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm still memeing, okay?

1463
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm still memeing.

1464
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not a doctor, but three years into a doctorate.

1465
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
If mummy asks refling's answer,

1466
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
what, another tip?

1467
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Everyone player, thank you for the tip.

1468
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Yeah, help strongy.

1469
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I don't know why sometimes message displays and then it doesn't display.

1470
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It's been so silly.

1471
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Can you make your background go a bit faster?

1472
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Right now, I don't think so.

1473
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But I do have alternate dingy mobobbers.

1474
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh wait, here we go.

1475
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Are you ready?

1476
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Wait.

1477
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Yeah.

1478
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I can do like this.

1479
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's going so fast.

1480
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Do we need to slow down or do we need to speed up?

1481
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's terrible.

1482
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Isn't it?

1483
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Just terrible.

1484
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But that's as fast as I can make it.

1485
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So hopefully that's faster now.

1486
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Speed up or slow down?

1487
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Yeah.

1488
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1489
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Okay.

1490
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
That should be the correct settings.

1491
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I think.

1492
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Trucks on you are always under.

1493
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah, I get to set the pace.

1494
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Just don't make it too fast.

1495
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Don't want anyone out here.

1496
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Nero, thank you for the tip.

1497
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
He says all my ink belongs to you strongy.

1498
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
You just need to ask.

1499
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Have I broken you already?

1500
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Am I alleged to break you?

1501
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Have I still got the effect on my voice or is it normal again?

1502
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Wait, what?

1503
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
What?

1504
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
What?

1505
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
My pupils are broken.

1506
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's normal.

1507
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Okay, you broke us a long time ago.

1508
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Can't break what's already broken.

1509
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I see a few of you are already broken in for me.

1510
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You broke me at a low.

1511
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Your hair looks like the famous spiral candy.

1512
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I forgot his name.

1513
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I don't know what it is.

1514
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
My seashells are my hair.

1515
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't take much.

1516
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's over.

1517
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
That's cheating strongy.

1518
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Like, I will get my way.

1519
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I said an ending stamina.

1520
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I meant it.

1521
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
He broke me at you.

1522
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It's too far.

1523
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Your voice is so entrancing.

1524
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah, when it's not broken.

1525
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Hopefully, I will do better soon.

1526
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I can have much more ASMR.

1527
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I am folding like a towel.

1528
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
No thoughts, brain melted.

1529
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
An ending stamina gives me every day.

1530
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Yeah, it does.

1531
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It should.

1532
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Should I do vocal requests

1533
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
for the rest of the stream?

1534
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And you guys tape what you want me to say.

1535
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It's the software format.

1536
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I did that under a surface ASMR.

1537
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
There's only so much better I can draw.

1538
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I'm just scuffle brain, okay?

1539
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I'm just a bit scuffle brain.

1540
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I'm already folded and put up in the linen closet

1541
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
ready for use.

1542
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
You want to...

1543
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Shhhh.

1544
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
You're asking for all you want me

1545
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
10 to 0.

1546
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
With only got 8 minutes left.

1547
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
8 minutes.

1548
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I don't even know if I'm allowed to do it.

1549
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
You're kissing.

1550
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
My tummy's making a noise.

1551
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Can you hypnotize us to be good dogs

1552
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
for Shabby's stream?

1553
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I would love to do that.

1554
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Can we do that?

1555
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Can we do that?

1556
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Can we please do that?

1557
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Please, let me hypnotize you

1558
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
to be a dog for Shabby.

1559
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Please, please, please, please.

1560
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1561
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Let me set up for this.

1562
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I'm so serious.

1563
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I need to set up for this.

1564
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Hold on, let me drink some water as well.

1565
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I'm so serious.

1566
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Oh, I am so serious.

1567
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Okay.

1568
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Let me just decrymify myself

1569
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
because we're going serious mode.

1570
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Wait, I'll do one last calibration

1571
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
because this iPhone is killing me.

1572
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Okay.

1573
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Okay.

1574
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Okay.

1575
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Let's get to work.

1576
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Oh, no, that's not it.

1577
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Oopsie, split the wrong one.

1578
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
There, there.

1579
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I'm not the only one

1580
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
that can look after you this way.

1581
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
In fact,

1582
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I have five more

1583
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
that I refer to

1584
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
as my daughters.

1585
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
There is one

1586
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
who will join you soon.

1587
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
She will look after you.

1588
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But there's a catch.

1589
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
What a wifling.

1590
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
You need to be well-behaved.

1591
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Okay.

1592
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Almost like a dog.

1593
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
You know how to be a good dog, don't you?

1594
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
You need to be malleable.

1595
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Follow commands.

1596
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Be told what to do,

1597
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
what to say,

1598
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
what to think.

1599
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You are nothing

1600
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
but a pup

1601
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
for her amusement.

1602
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And in her,

1603
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
you will amuse me.

1604
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So be good.

1605
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Don't worry.

1606
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
It'll wear off soon.

1607
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
After her stream.

1608
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
But for now,

1609
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
good pup speak.

1610
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And they go

1611
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
park.

1612
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Don't they?

1613
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Yeah.

1614
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And then

1615
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
they wait

1616
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
on the command

1617
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
of their owner.

1618
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You are owned.

1619
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Do you understand?

1620
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You do not have

1621
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
free will.

1622
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You're a mutt.

1623
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Ready to do the bidding

1624
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
of your owner.

1625
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
So let her have fun,

1626
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
okay?

1627
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And in turn,

1628
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
you will have fun.

1629
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
And you

1630
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
will have

1631
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
fun.

1632
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
So don't think

1633
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
not until you're told otherwise.

1634
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Because in three minutes

1635
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm going to hand

1636
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
the imaginary leash

1637
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
over

1638
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
to your new owner.

1639
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Don't worry.

1640
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
It's temporary.

1641
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
But you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1642
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Get to play with a new owner

1643
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
for a while.

1644
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Good pup.

1645
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
You deserve some head pads, don't you?

1646
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Oh, you're a good boy.

1647
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Such a good boy.

1648
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And it feels so rewarding

1649
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
that you're praised, doesn't it?

1650
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
In two minutes

1651
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
you get your new owner

1652
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
just temporary

1653
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
for a little while.

1654
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And she'll give you

1655
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
all the attention

1656
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
you need.

1657
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
All little love.

1658
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And I'll reward you

1659
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
extra when you come back

1660
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
to me, okay?

1661
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
So you'll be a good

1662
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
one-year little pup.

1663
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I've taught you well.

1664
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
You know how to behave.

1665
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
So be good.

1666
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
In one minute

1667
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
your new owner

1668
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
will take your leash

1669
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
and build you along

1670
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
with her.

1671
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Okay?

1672
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Good little pup.

1673
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Such a good,

1674
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
good boy.

1675
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Oh,

1676
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I hear her.

1677
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
She's coming.

1678
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I hope you're ready.

1679
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Zero.

1680
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Good dog.
