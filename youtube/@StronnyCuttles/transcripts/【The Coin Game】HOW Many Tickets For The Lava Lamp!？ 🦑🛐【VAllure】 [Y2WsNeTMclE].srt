00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:50,540
fans I make the fans stop this is get this is too much sometimes that will go

261
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,860
back after pregnancy but not always some women may experience permanent changes

262
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,380
to their after pregnancy such as an increase in size or a change in color

263
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,100
additionally genetics can play a role to the extent of the changes after

264
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:15,500
pregnancy what a strange thing what a strange element and thank you stash

265
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,180

might be able to hold on let me finish my tea I need to come up with the song

269
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,380
haters and commentators I've got that covered hey I know who would come into

270
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:59,500
I don't know how to commentate we see them some fans we need a few million at least

271
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:07,420
I'll get it done look I know you've got two tentacles okay that can be used for

272
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:15,820
that explicit reason no no my whim can't take anymore it's too much it's too

273
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,740
much it's too much thank you tiny spainy and thank you stash power you've got

274
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,420
two tentacles but it's too much it's too much honest question mom if you were

275
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,460
regent in three becomes more successful could you imagine you go further okay I'm

276
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,300
gonna say something that is very truthful and very honest and you're not

277
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:50,140
gonna like it so fj into and three are successful and the consensus is we'd

278
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:57,020
like more the truth is I would probably not be streaming to focus on their

279
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,860
success I would be pulling strings in the background and doing that kind of

280
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:08,420
thing and I would still continue to make audios and community audios in

281
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:19,300
particular look like a worn leather tote bag after we are done the way I told

282
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:29,300
a worn leather tote bag we need multiple stadiums filled no anti-gen for well so

283
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,980
there is a bit of a little asterisk on that one dredgen karma thank you as well

284
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,580
fucking millions there isn't our asterisk I miss you already no refund

285
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:51,460
don't puke and there isn't asterisk to this if I can find people that know what

286
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:59,260
to do that that get what I need them to do that changes everything okay so

287
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:06,940
there is another vtuber that's a manager what the biggest problem I have right

288
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:14,780
now is I have so few little people that I can give access to the accounts to

289
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,500
that's the major thing so we've got an audio manager that's actually should

290
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,180
have came in yesterday but I've been lazy and not written up the the script

291
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,620
that they're supposed to follow basically and so there's someone that now

292
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,700
deals with the patreon audios and no longer deal with us during spring and

293
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:40,740
summer producing about 100 to 300 eggs oh come on we have to make an audio about

294
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:49,900
that and pregnant all 300 of my eggs thank you cartoffel of doom and no gen

295
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,940
for we need strong streams just like vtubers and famous companies again

296
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,940
whole stadiums all the world needs to be a fan seven billion minimum I'm not

297
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,020
replacing the fucking population rate sauce but it should come down I'm not

298
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,420
replacing the birth rate thank you mom alone only to the egg leave first and

299
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,620
but yes the what I'm facing so I have someone trustworthy that I can give the

300
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,820
patreon accounts to because and you know they have history experience I've already

301
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,020
worked in the field all that jazz so now I no longer have to deal with the

302
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,740
patreon stuff when it comes to managers this is different the managers are still

303
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,340
gonna have to go to management but I'm like slowly getting out of it so I still

304
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,540
deal with some stuff like and you know Mercy's got a project on the way I'm

305
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:46,860
kind of dealing with the artwork in that that's not a big thing to deal with like

306
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,500
ordering artwork isn't a big thing to deal with do you know what I mean

307
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,020
whereas when the manager comes in the manager can give advice can give on the

308
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,820
spot like do you need help or something but the manager doesn't have access to

309
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,500
accounts because they're a manager they're not supposed to have access to

310
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:16,300
that stuff and I don't have people that I can have on the team and have access to

311
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,460
their accounts does that make sense because there needs to be a safety net

312
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,100
yet the like managers have to go through management okay and it's very

313
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,580
difficult because if the girls need something but then that's when you can

314
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,500
start arguing well because the girls are so independent they do what they want

315
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,780
on their schedule they get handed the thumbnails the schedules the shorts they

316
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,700
just have to give us the shorts like the clips like you know when we say thank

317
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,020
you for clipping the girls that's because they take your clip and then that

318
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,380
link goes to an editor and that's it do you still use Marshmallow yes I do I've

319
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,460
always used Marshmallow and I took a break just because I was getting shit

320
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:01,380
but it's completely completely back to my my own stuff so Jen what 2034 and

321
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,820
Jen to debut in 2024 Jen what 20 more yet what you want me to stagger the

322
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:13,540
fucking a debut by fucking decades would be we would be it we wouldn't even be

323
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:20,700
relevant but we'd be gone sorry I don't want to have you to stop streaming now

324
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,620
you're fine you heard it she's single-handedly fixing the decline in

325
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:31,740
birth rate real yes because infinite strongy gone reduced to arms yeah you're

326
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:40,500
fine and it's very hard so I do have enough editors but I'm gonna need I think

327
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,660
two more reading the humans and well you've changed my mind I don't want to

328
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,860
kill all of humanity I just want to kill the high table thank you the very Lord

329
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:59,140
you two will be gone before we get Jen three brah better hope not fucking

330
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,300
cheeky bombs let's go gambling oh dang it is there something that keeps you from

331
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,540
being accepted from the clipper program and we don't know I've spoken to

332
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:15,940
management about what the yield is on the clipper program I actually don't

333
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,300
know if it's gonna get paused and just because I'll need to speak to management

334
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:29,940
about it there is something going on that was like and I can't remember what

335
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,820
the note was sorry I'm not and like I'm not in the clipper program discord or

336
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:45,740
anything like that it's management a yeah I can't so I'm trying to see if I can

337
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,140
find a note about it I don't know if it's gonna get paused temporarily it just

338
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,820
because we thought there was gonna be a bit more yield from it and obviously we

339
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:04,300
had like a base fee and the $2 per 1000 view thing and obviously the purpose of

340
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,140
it is like obviously it's to be very thankful towards the clippers but at

341
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,020
the end of the day the bottom line if we want to cut past all is to get the

342
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:19,460

we're your parents type of thing and obviously you little brother would rebellion but no big

502
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:27,140
brother were rebellious so you kind of like acted out in a sense that you knew they wouldn't be happy

503
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:34,180
with and Emmy loved you for that she loved that you were you know like in her eyes like her rose

504
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:40,980
tinted eyes you were the embodiment of the strength and determination and the resistance

505
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,580
that she wanted you say we're the father the son in the holy spirit honestly many correct

517
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:08,180
hello strunnion chat hello little hyena apple so emmy kills big bro no the book killed the

518
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:16,900
book belonged to big brother he rebelled against um his parents via the book of witchcraft wizardry

519
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,100
wherever you want to call it the dark side any of that pitch the book is what killed him the book

520
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:30,660
is what has him stuck in um purgatory if you will being tortured and emmy has vouched that she will

521
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:39,060
become a strong enough entity to destroy what holds him back and then they get their happy ending so

522
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:43,460
if you didn't know i have said this before but don't worry if you didn't know everyone has a

523
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:51,780
happy ending at the allure so if um for whatever reason you know i'll respect that decision anyone

524
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:58,820
wants to leave i will ask the girls to close their lore so emmy has a happy ending and gets her

525
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:05,380
brother no they do not biologically have any children however they do have happy days at the end um

526
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:14,420
azura finds her place in human uh no sorry aces happy ending only happy endings that this

527
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:22,180
felt real that's really sweet tragic why not why are they not gonna have children go look up that

528
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,980
spanish king and tell me why they're no having wings okay they love each other they don't need

00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:45,460
uncle and grandpa good morning good morning glad to give you that lore basically with

531
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,180
wait more velour leaves um actually the herdsworth are different no what i'm saying is there's gonna

532
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,740
be an ending to the stories if anyone leaves they're gonna be seeing mama's happy ending soon

533
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:02,980
that's a bad ending for us what not right you guys are off on you're gonna actually give each other

534
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:13,140
brain worms manually we are gonna do it manually so like mersey's ending was so when she first got

535
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:19,620
attacked her her pupils split into that broken heart because mersey can't have appropriate love

536
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:26,020
right now because of the state her brain is in so in order to fix that broken heart when she

537
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:32,900
she wraps up it's gonna the pupil is gonna become whole again i don't know how to make it whole

538
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:39,140
again i thought it would be really funny if mersey got like hit on the head or something

539
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:44,100
in combat and then like it all clicks together and then she can like love appropriately again

540
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:54,180
um like uh she be she be just wants to run the hotel um you know she does best running the hotel

541
01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:01,540

593
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:02,980
that having three or more children has negative effects on late life cognition

594

in terms of hey why did why did gen one look like gen one oh it's all based after my personal interests

630
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:32,180

01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:48,660
in office lady hr fits her she was but she was a jet i think it's called a desk jockey where you

633
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:55,300
just work at the desk all the time all the time a small loan of 60k how daring already made the

634
01:11:55,300 --> 01:12:03,380
investment back but you didn't hear that from me oh my god vealer more like the failure investment

635
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:14,100

636
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:21,780

637
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:29,940
schedule but it was there somewhere that information's mine she be the desk jockey as opposed to strongy

638
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:38,580
yes i don't know if i'll make a short about being like things people said about the chibber agency

639
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:45,380
i don't want it to be like a boohoo negative short i wanted it to be like people said this

640
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:50,260
about the agency they said it was gonna fail and it's like surprise after three months we already

641
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:59,700
made the return on investment um because i really yeah people were pretty fucking nasty when we

642
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:07,780
booted off i'm not gonna lie uh a lot of like uh gonna be unsuccessful gonna be this gonna be that

643
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:13,220
the one of the things was management was gonna run away with the money which i was like you

644
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:17,300
did not have a fucking clue who's behind the scenes do you then if that's your fucking take away from

645
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:22,900
80 20 split and all that jazz i'm like fucking hell fucking hell they're like you know what they

646
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:27,060
sound like you know those managers that post there is like this meme post that went viral and

647
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:34,340
as a manager and he was like i just can't get my workers to be motivated and everyone all like he

648
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,420
got bombarded and was like are you paying the minimum wage do you only pay the minimum wage so

649
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,740
you only did it i was like you give people minimum wage and a little tiny slither of how much they

650
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:48,260
earn yeah damn right they're not fucking motivated to work damn fucking right you could have you

651
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:53,860
could enable them as much as you want if they're making fucking pennies on the dollar yeah damn

652
01:13:53,940 --> 01:14:02,500
fucking straight they do not give a random fucking shite so okay okay they do not care

653
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:14,580
right i've got a bit more of uh now this schedule isn't uh let me be clear this schedule isn't

654
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:20,580
complete because it's not finished can i do that i can't see it right put it in the bin then put it

655
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:26,420
in the bin put it in the bin you didn't see that it's me being lazy i'm just trying to drag files

656
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:34,180
into a thingy so i don't have to import it oh let me be transparent this there we go okay

657
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:44,340
there that's a bit better it's not complete but the elden ring endurance back to back starts up

658
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:49,860
i started on the weekend to give weekend but it also goes into monday so if you're a weekend worker

659
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:57,860
please don't worry minimum wage minimum effort boss makes a dollar i make a day man that's why

660
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:03,060
your shit on company time sorry i'm slapping my whole war ball if you can hear that um

661
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:10,500

662
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:26,100
anime um i'm also gonna do possibly if ac isn't streaming i might do a member stream at ac's time

663
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:35,460
slot does that make sense maybe i might do the ace more members at ac's time slot and then swap

664
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,500
something it just depends vivi has pretty crying moments oh god am i gonna need a box of tissues

665
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:52,820
for that stream um but yes castle cashers collab i've got baby pink peaches don't sing the peaches

666
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:58,500
song that per girl gets it enough and then sins is through so if you aren't sick of sin yet she's

667
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:04,420
showing up on my channel um ace more stream is going to be the

668
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:14,260
workout one i'm going to be working out day and night uh the lonely stoner seems to do his mind

669
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:20,340
at night shone makes a dollar i make a day and that's why i piss on sweat twit is a lot honestly

670
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,900
tropic thunder though good um sweet sweat asmr honestly it should be called sweat asmr but yes

671
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:34,660
the asmr milestone stream is going to be taken to there and i don't know what to do for a needs

672
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:43,620
game though i kind of need a shorter day shorter game when i do like asmr swams

673
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:48,500
uh so the titanfall 2 campaign six hours

674
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:58,420
need a game two hours maybe uh i'll actually play coin master properly on that day because

675
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:06,340
i think the storm would have passed by then um anime watch along is six hours because it's a

676
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:13,460
12 episode anime so you got six hours of me then castle crashers and then it's that's a four-hour

677
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:22,500
day ace more stream um members watch along tropic thunder yeah someone recommended tropic thunder

678
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:28,340
i've never seen it before so i hope you're ready for me to be surprised the only meme i know is

679
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:33,300
never go full r please don't stream titanfall 2 for as long as she did i gave up on clip in that

680
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:39,860
stream because it was eight hours i have played titanfall 2 so um she be you have to remember

681
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:45,460
she be playing sure it's for the very first time she she said herself she doesn't normally play

682
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:51,380
categorized games like that it's the first time she does that and she probably played medium mode

683
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:55,780
or something whereas i play easy mode and just blast the campaign because i like the stories and so

684
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:03,140
um has any riefling brought up the elden ring seamless co-op mod 500 rieflings can join at a time

685
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:12,180
i think that shows ip unfortunately whereas elden ring servers and i think it's actually kind of a

686
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:17,860
bit i don't know if this is wrong of me to assume i actually think it's nicer to have a smaller team

687
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,980
of rieflings when we do a challenge or explore do you know what i mean

688
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:33,540
um you didn't we have to watch it you are um i think you guys might like the more intimate

689
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:39,380
like team aspect to elden ring yeah i know i know oh my god the eldering devs didn't

690
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:44,740
want it to be that way yeah guess what guess what guess what you know what you know what sound

691
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,260
effect you're getting to that

692
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,540
yeah that's right you're getting feral's cursed have you heard of a game called click holding

693
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:06,420
i saw it and it's really weird crazy jesse thank you for the super chat it's really weird i saw it

694
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:11,540
so a few v-tubers played i was like so it's a guy sitting in a chair and you have a clicky like

695
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:16,420
click click click and you're to click on it and then that's it that's the game

696
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,460
it's rather scary

697
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:27,060
made to the dev of that game is that shifting sand land yeah titanfall 2

698
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:35,620
i don't think more than 100 rieflings have elden ring today 500 rieflings would also probably

699
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:46,100
crash your game turn the slab um but yeah it's a pretty strange game yeah i saw um

700
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:52,100
thinking my barber from idol n planned to play it i don't know if she did play or not but i saw

701
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:58,420
the name of it and i looked up the game because i was like what the fuck is this uh my yazaki

702
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:04,500
actually like seamless co-op and is considered in co-op in the future for elden ring

703
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:13,380
i just like i just want to hang out and play game okay controversial but yes we're going to play

705
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:27,620

718
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:56,180

719
01:21:56,180 --> 01:22:01,060
that says don't listen at asmr volumes obviously when i'd like to do it's gonna be loud like

720
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:08,500

724
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,380
shower and then we'll probably talk for like 30 minutes and then i'm gonna take a break and then

835
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:26,100
a little bit of a point to my ears um the girls are gonna get new ref sheets soon actually which

836
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:31,780

837
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:38,420
for the artists as well because we already kind of have established looks in that i just need them

838
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:48,180
slightly more detailed slightly more detailed yeah that's why i saw those got the reeflands

839
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:53,460
pitch and tentacle yeah we're being wholesome this stream this is like the most tame and relaxed

840
01:35:53,460 --> 01:36:04,420
we've ever been we're just yapping um but yeah nice and calm and all is calm all is quiet i've

841
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:11,780
sent back the notes about the velour video game so it's going to take around two weeks to put in

842
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:29,140
my notes because there was a few things missing um there's even a hidden reefland the one that

843
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:36,580
went spelunking i'm not being funny i'm so tempted to commission the alternative like outfit where i

844
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:41,380
have your tentacles wrapped around me i'm like what do i commission first because i'm getting

845
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:48,260
mummies getting h word over the concept like oh i can just see it now like the tentacles wrapping

846
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:57,620

849
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:18,100
i'm a bad influence and say commission them all no i want it i want if we do have alternative

850
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:24,100
outfits that come out i would want everyone to have it at the same time because i don't think it's fair

851
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:30,340
to like now it's different when the girls want to you know like after a year the gloves came to

852
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:35,940

860
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,580
you don't have to use this reefland just wanted to share it while you're looking i'm currently

861
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:33,140
looking at all on another one from a movie that's safe though what are you sending me

862
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:36,980
and why is it not a picture of your pinterest

863
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:45,620
oh my god reefland

864
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,180
i guess i would need to put you on my shoulder whoa why am i lagging

865
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:59,140
don't i keep thinking my internet is about to go out you have you belong on my chest because

866
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:07,060
you're calling me that's quite a few reeflands oh my god i'm ready to commission another one

867
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:10,420
hold on a minute i'm ready to commission this and this and this and this

868
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:22,580
so do we all have sucking caps under our tentacles that don't ink oh yeah you you can

869
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:26,420
you have passive so you have passive ink that comes from you like

870
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:31,540
that makes time easy for me because

871
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:38,580
tight and you also have suckers if you want to use them but you're able to like flatten them

872
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:47,060
to stop the suction and you can grow at your arms they so just because you're small you can

873
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:53,780
actually grow your arms to like extend if you need to reach something or just something with them

874
01:39:53,780 --> 01:40:04,580
for no particular reason um yeah this is amazing fast all those funds are getting used oh yeah

875
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:11,300
she's having ideas i love how it's so much you've thought about the lore oh the lore runs

876
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:18,100
deep i needed i need the tent oh i mean i need the reeflings to have to enjoy their lore

877
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,020
yes

878
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:29,460
scraping those hard to reach places honestly reefling lore update so then we could suction cup

much for the redirect that was very kind uh unfortunately i'm not appropriate for younger

893
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:18,980
audiences so if you find yourself to be younger you need to skew yourself away somewhere else

894
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:23,780
because i don't really talk about things that are appropriate oh i hope i can be it can be

908
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:09,380
as i said cuttlefish can lay 300 eggs in a clutch so you know you pop me on some of these medications

909
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:17,780
it's over it's over i like that meme 10 out of 10 i should i should do a meme review oh my gosh

910
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:23,540
because you guys are so creative with the stuff you come up with like that one that one meme where

911
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,820
we're in a classroom and i'm thinking about marrying you and you're thinking about something else

912
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,060
now what happens if you take a pill each time that's not a meme what's that

913
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:38,980
someone sent me a picture of a tentacle and they put a cute refling

914
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,460
you're done it's got a suction cup to it though

915
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:46,980
um

916
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,780
uh right let me see hi mummy i know you've already talked about your donathon

917
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:01,700
but um as you're a donathon had a hundred dollar and fifty dollar rewards are there

918
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:10,260
similar rewards also what are the rewards for those top three um i am going to go over my

919
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:19,220
donathon rewards again because i wrote those before um velar even popped up because i was

920
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:25,220
guessing what i needed so it's getting completely thrown out the window and redone um i will warn

921
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:32,900
you uh it will be posted in advance and we kind of messed up with azura's post a little bit

922
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,740
um and didn't give much warning to what the rewards might have been

923
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:42,740
um but what we'll do it differently like sheebie's is coming up um sheebie's gonna like

924
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:48,100
warn in advance and i'm gonna do it as well um and you'll see what the rewards are um

925
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:56,100
um the the membership stream i did do talking about donathon rewards a lot of them are so outdated

926
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:00,980
like i've already done them so don't worry too much they're getting changed up we'll do another

927
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:06,580
donathon membership to try and iron out the kinks um you don't need to read this out loud

928
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:15,780
aw you look so cute with all the reflings me cuddling yeah yeah you like when we're all together

929
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:25,460
you swinging off my hair swinging off my um i think you might get even more support than azura

930
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:30,420
i'm just glad that she can start preparing to move out obviously it's quite a big thing

931
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:35,540
as far as i'm aware azura hasn't moved out before on her own so it's the first time

932
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:40,180
she's ever doing something so it's obviously it's going to take a while um but she's like slowly

933
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:44,500
already working on her rewards like i'm working alongside her to make sure the rewards get done

934
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:53,540
in a timely manner um we were so obviously she's taking a bit of a break right now um but when

935
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:58,660
she comes back she's basically walloping the absolute living daylights out of the donathon

936
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:05,220
like every stream's gonna be like yeah get wrecked donathon plop plop plop plop plop um we if you

937
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:12,100
donated on azura's donathon to the sum of $50 or above please check your emails uh management

938
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:17,540
is messaged you we need we need information from you to to get your rewards adequately

939
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:24,260
give 50k donathon reward life extension medicine for the reflings you guys look so nice

940
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:31,140
is there a moving out as hey that is yeah azura was talking about what uh what she had to do

941
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:35,620
quite a few things before she moved yeah like to prepare to move out for the first time as a nightmare

942
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:41,620
like i remember when i first moved out oh my god i could freaking beat my dad up so badly um

943
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:49,860
huh he was like just i think what he he never said he didn't want me to move out but he was

944
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:55,140
being so awkward trying to let me move out but i think what it was is he didn't want me to move out

945
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:01,140
um so i was like i was legit crying having to carry like my own pc into this flat when i was

946
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:06,820
like so weak like i smashed my pc against the wall basically because i was so weak trying to move it

947
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:12,580
in because my dad refused to help me get out the car um oh there you go management we're

948
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:19,220
waiting on 12 people to respond regarding azura's donathon yeah um we're gonna have a cutoff date

949
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:25,700
if you don't reply after a date azura is just gonna move on ahead because basically we can't

950
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:33,380
progress with the azura's um audio rewards until people respond so we're gonna have to have a

951
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,500
cutoff date because azura is gonna have to start getting to work so please check your emails if you

952
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:44,580
were uh did there's been a tweet from the twitter account azura mentioned it on her stream uh we'll

953
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:50,660
get her to mention it on her next stream as well because um we're trying to get this wrapped up

954
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:57,300
in two months i'm gonna ask the girls to really we don't want any donathon reward issues put it

955
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,980
that way um i want to learn from the mistakes of others our history is bound to repeat itself

956
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:09,140
you know come on you 12 bleeding hearts hi scrawny hi mithlyn when my parents threw me out i was

957
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:16,820

958
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:26,020

963
01:49:54,500 --> 01:50:02,020
stop opening my bedroom door it wakes me up when you do it and every day every fucking morning

964
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:07,940
she'd wake me up opening the door um i don't know what it was i don't know about some control

965
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:16,660
thing some weird thing i pleaded with her i work at night i have a waitress job i am exhausted

966
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:22,660

uncommon to have locked doors in the uk the sandal can't hurt you anymore it's okay scrawny the

plead with my mum to not open the door i just remembered that and i'm like yeah i'm moving

983
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:22,500
out was the best choice of my life um my sister had a habit of opening my door without warning so

984
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:27,220
in the uk there's not really a knock on the door policy like you know how like knock knock come in

985
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:39,060
is all shown on like american tv shows that's not really what um that's not really what what's the

986
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:49,060
word what happens in the uk like that's not commonplace um but i remember i just remember pleading

987
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:54,180
and she used to always look at me like strani i don't know what the big deal is i don't know what

988
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:59,140
you're talking about and i used to be like like she used to play dumb and obviously i would raise

989
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:04,180
my voice because i'd get really angry i'd be like you know what the you're waking me up in the middle

990
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:10,660
of my sleep cycle like she just didn't care or she just used to play and then oh my god one time i

991
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:14,660
remember i really raised my voice because i had enough i was like i don't want to be here i don't

992
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:19,700
want to live here anymore um like i'm fucking moving out because my mum was so resistant to

993
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:24,020
i was like i need to move out like fucking now i was desperate i was desperate to move out and

994
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:29,300
one time i raised my voice because i was like because you fucking wake me up all the time um

995
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:34,740
and she like acted all shocked like i could see in her body language she like pretended to act so

996
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:41,220
shocked when i shouted and raised my voice because i don't normally do it i never do it um but like

997
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:47,060
she was me fucking listening to me i was like you interrupt my sleep i never get sleep

998
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:50,340
because you can't you lock your doors no there's no locked doors

999
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:57,940
and then when i moved out obviously our relationship got like fucking 10 times better

1000
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:07,300
because surprise surprise it was on my own terms no accountability no like as i said i love my mum

1020
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:51,140
face it with cheeks like tears are drawn elsewhere spelunking yes spelunking means to go in a cave

1021
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:57,060

down in the ocean where the coral shanes break a little fish named strongy that's full of light

1037
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:14,500
big old behind and a plant in her mind a new reefland's happy one ink at a time

1038
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:23,780
um we got a factory with sun to the sea where the reeflands come to ink and they do it with glee

1039
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:30,660
and they do it over the handsway and she's straight and some cheer sun is making magic and the reeflands

1040
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:44,420
draw near it's so cute and swim and all excited and proud pay the ink up in the factory

1041
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:52,020
going to guide swim through with a wink and a grin and they leave her factory with a mile within

1042
01:59:52,740 --> 02:00:00,500
the strong got a factory under the under the sea when the inklings come to ink and they do it with

1043
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:08,660
glee he's in swing and he's spreading some cheer shaw and he's making magic when the reeflands draw

1044
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:19,140
near it's so cute with the colors run true strongies factories place where dreams come true

1045
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:25,940
we got a vast of ink and every shade in you and the reeflands know that you'll take care of them too

1046
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:33,540
strongies got a factory of best under the sea where the inks just come to ink and they do it with glee

1047
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:40,420
and the big swim swaying and spreading some cheer shaw and he's making magic and the reeflands

1048
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:51,300
draw near the river you're driving with an ocean so wide and the brownies factory pride inside

1049
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:58,260
with a babe behind shaking the fert so free shaw and he's making joy in the inky sea

1050
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:06,100
I want to make it a real song though but am I gonna get obliterated because it was technically AI

1051
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:14,420
is it I don't know I want to make it a real song though like it's so good

1052
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:23,540
like literally way down in the ocean where the coral shines bright lives a cuttlefish named

1053
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:30,340
she's got a big old behind and a plan in her mind AI has no copyright you don't get I mean

1054
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:35,620
the AI can't go no like I would get this song like custom produced and all that like I'm not

1055
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:40,660
gonna get in trouble for that because that can be like well a reefland made a plausible deniability

1056
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:47,380
lyrics by reefling though it was written by a human just composed by a machine yeah like that's

1057
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:51,860
what I was saying I don't understand how the machine knew my name and like that I have a button

1058
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:58,740
so if you cover it yeah like I was gonna get a different like temple made for it

1059
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:05,780
and like I wouldn't make it country I would change it from country to like maybe like pop or something

1060
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:13,060
way down in the ocean where the coral shines bright lives a cuttlefish called scrawny and

1061
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:24,820
we're inking today like I would get it changed to paul I am yeah heavy male version way down in

1062
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:31,620
the ocean where the coral shines bright scrawny gates them through with the wink and a grin and

1063
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:39,220
they leave her factory with a smile within I like the lane about how I have different shades of ink

1064
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:46,820
where is it uh a heart so free was really cute that was a good one as well where is it

1065
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:52,740
it was like different shade I've got other she's got vats of ink in every shade and hue was such a

1066
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:59,620
good one do it it's literally AI you can do what you want no but what I mean like I want I'm gonna

1067
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:05,540
get it turned into like a me a song I think that was so good the only problem is I need to tell the

1068
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:09,700
producer hey I have no vocal range can you make it like how I'm supposed to say it that'd be great

1069
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:20,020
I have zero vocal range I have zero vocal range all the day all the day all the day

1070
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:25,460
whether it's AI art that's cringe no like I would make it human does that make sense

1071
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:33,540
so it's not like someone's job got yoinked um like I only like AI art for the memes like put me

1072
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:41,860
in a wheelchair wait no that that sounds horrible out of context that sounds awful out of context

1073
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:50,980
there was a AI artwork of me in a wheelchair a very long time ago okay under the sea um that

1074
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:56,420
sounded terrible out of context don't actually put me in a wheelchair it was to do with my health

1075
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:02,340
because I was having health issues I mean like you know you know how it is um this meme is from a

1076
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:08,100
member stream but you might not want to show it I don't know oh my god wait but what happens if the

1077
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:17,300
memes via member streams is how we is how we show our thingy I don't know yeah fuck it we joke about

1078
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:30,420

1079
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:40,500
how is that miss input miss input it's going in the bin it's going going oh my god

1080
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:48,900
why is it so dramatically flashing it's not real that never actually happened in a membership stream

1081
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:55,940
I haven't in a more of me in the water I haven't how do I display this meme

1082
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:58,660

1083
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,780
right get off the screen what the fuck

1084
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:19,460
I forgot about the ending oh that was from my audio where uh

1085
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:25,540
clap my hands in the ASMR I'm so sorry I forgot I saved that meme

1086
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:33,460
sorry I forgot I can say sorry for trauma dumping in your mirrors no it's fine

1087
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:38,900
don't be silly I didn't read it out loud because I didn't know if you wanted me to read it out

1088
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:44,740
loud so I was just like I'll leave that between us I asked this clip of things of hands yes I get

1089
02:05:44,740 --> 02:06:00,340
to reupload it and on the 19th on the 19th I get to um sorry I don't I don't know why I did that

1090
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:04,020
please forgive me I didn't mean it that way

1091
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:06,340

1092
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:16,500
I totally forgot about that clapping stream are you sure you want to wish me

1093
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:22,660
well so I got done for the breathing I never actually got done for because if you listen to the

1094
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:27,460
audio it does just sound like I'm running around like a maniac and just breathe in and it's like

1095
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:32,820
well I can't really get done for that can I I've been flashbinding the best way are you gonna teach

1096
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:42,180
the other cake top jimmies to clap with no hands um I don't know how I would go about that I just

1097
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:48,340
kind of discovered I could do it so the way I discovered that I could do it is I would I would

1098
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:54,100
take a shower and then before um I got out the shower I would kind of like jump up and down a

1099
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:59,620
little bit like I wouldn't lift off the ground and then like obviously you can imagine my surprise

1100
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:03,380
where I was like oh yeah what the fuck was that when it clapped for the first time and then I was

1101
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:10,820
like oh my god I can clap my cheeks um because that's how I used to get the water to like jump

1102
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:18,180
off of me and so yeah uh the heart attack I got when it echoed in the shower for the first time

1103
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:23,940
I literally I was like who goes there identify yourself and I was like literally my own butt cheeks

1104
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:25,140
um

1105
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:32,980
so yeah that that's the story of how I discovered I can clap my

1106
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:40,900
I can give myself a round of applause um domain expansion malevolent backshot

1107

1123
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:44,100
streams have been so short this week obviously it doesn't help that um a tomato ketchup packet you

1124
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:48,980
know but they've been so short literally look at my streams this week

1125
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:58,820

1127
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:11,380
two remember asmar then it jumps to nine hours on over a gee I wonder why I was so motivated to

1128
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:18,020
play that game for such a long time hmm and then it was four hours yapping on tcg and then two hours

1129
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:23,060
again this is such a short you streamed overwatch for eight hours yeah but I like it's different

1130
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:30,900
because I got to play with the reef it's so different um like it I just like it's such a

1131
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:38,020
short week from me it feels almost strange but I do know that it's gonna change like next week

1138
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:23,540

1238
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:53,300

1242
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:29,380
a voice thing from Azura and Emmy is cooking in the background as always

1243
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:39,780
that's my that's my my handshake that's my handshake okay in exchange for a shorter stream week this

1244
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:49,780
week but ASMR another ASMR another ASMR I'm also gonna get management to make up the schedule so

1245
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:56,500
you know what the themes are as I said there's now no longer any collaboration role plays

1246
02:23:57,300 --> 02:24:04,500
um that are gonna be on patreon because that flopped harder than something flopping really no

1247
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:08,900
yeah that flopped harder than what you guys don't have any uh you guys don't have phones or whatever

1248
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:14,900
it flop pretty hard yes Emmy the chef literally Emmy the chef uh do what you gotta do thank you

1249
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:19,300
rare mercy stream on a time I'm not sleeping let's go yeah you're gonna get a chance to watch

1250
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:27,060
mercy should I watched mercy should I watched any kind of yellow remember wait it flopped

1251
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:37,460
people did not like the collaboration audios and that's partly my fault because in the VA world

1252
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:42,820
it's like really good if people collab it's so exciting it's amazing but in the VTuber side of

1253
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:48,580
things it's not so good so that was a clash of my knowledge I was like oh yeah this is gonna hit

1254
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:53,060
and then a lot of feedback came back and it's like oh I completely missed a mark my apologies

1255
02:24:54,020 --> 02:25:03,060
my apologies have a good day uh love we shan't be doing that again um so uh Azura does have audio

1256
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:08,420
collab public releases but because it's public release it's your option to consume it and it's

1257
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:15,380
free if that makes sense so yeah um there's one-on-one collabs with everyone actually so

1258
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:22,500
I'll figure out what plots and we need to do which one the baby pink no no no no

1259
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:31,380
the patreon collabs won't I am like I did a collab with mersey I mean icicle were together

1260
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:37,700
and chibi and Azura were together for an audio but people didn't like it and I was like oh

1261
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,780
I may have missed the mark um

1262
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:46,820
oh is this one of those things where the happy people are quiet

1263
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:58,340
uh did it get um there was a few website emails a few on Marshmallow but none of them were rude

1264
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:06,660
about on Marshmallow I never got any rude ones um but people made a fair point where it was like

1265
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:13,220
I only paid to hear one girl so I guess that makes sense um it's part of the learning process yeah

1266
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:18,180
as I said it wasn't nasty or anything like I never got any nastiness I just got this wasn't

1267
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:24,900
what I was looking for and it was like okay now I know better so the collaboration audios will now

1268
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:29,620
be like public access stuff or milestone stuff um because I kind of missed the mark without

1269
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:40,500
but yeah some people are really loyal I guess yeah so in the VA side of things if two people

1270
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:46,660
collab like people go ape shit it's the fucking most best thing ever and in the VA oh my god you

1271
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:52,980
can tell that I've not got hands oh my god make that be fun bigger right now okay no wait go down

1272
02:26:56,980 --> 02:27:02,260
there we go I was like oh you can tell I don't have arms um I love the nurse one oh I'm good

1273
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:07,060
to like it they complained about getting more girls well I can now just like it well as I said um

1274
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:11,060
it's gonna be it it's not that there's never gonna be collabs again it's just gonna be public

1275
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:17,780
access and what you pay on patreon you get only your girl from now on my immersion yeah I like the
