105800	106300	Hello.
106300	107300	Are you squidding me right now?
107300	108300	I've got my daily counter.
108300	109300	I am burning rage.
109300	111300	Gonna try writing this in your accent.
111300	116300	Hopefully, Brian, I'm nor being funny when I say I love your voice so much.
116300	122800	Whether ageing, sleepily mumbling, yapping, or sensually whispering are just wanna hear
122800	125800	it all the time, nay exceptions.
125800	129800	Wait, that Brian actually kinda spoke a bit of Scots there.
129800	134800	Now, oh no, no men there, Brian.
134800	137800	You got a bit twang to your accent there.
137800	138800	Thank you, Brian.
138800	139800	Kindly.
139800	141800	Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip.
141800	142800	Hi, strongy.
142800	143800	Hi, Riefling.
143800	145800	Thanks for babysitting me while she's being gone.
145800	146800	Hi, harem.
146800	147800	Hi, harem.
147800	148800	I'm in a car.
148800	149800	Hi, y'all.
149800	150800	Hi, harem.
150800	151800	Shebe's coming back soon.
151800	152800	Don't worry.
152800	155800	And then she's gonna milk you.
155800	158800	Did you get some sleep, mommie?
158800	161800	I got drumroll, please.
161800	169800	Seven hours, and I had a dream, and I've already forgotten the dream, but I do have an update.
169800	176800	I did the dad, I did my dad name's VTubers, and you're not ready, okay?
176800	179800	You're not ready for the stuff my dad came out with.
179800	182800	Oh my god, I did not expect it.
182800	185800	Is YouTube messing with your title or is it German?
185800	189800	No, it is a German meme where a guy goes, is it over for me?
189800	194800	But because of the way it looks in German, it's quite readable in English, so the sentence
194800	198800	is over for me, because apparently I'm gonna cry a lot in this game, so yeah.
199800	202800	Not the fully hours, but something, yes.
202800	205800	I did it with my dad.
205800	209800	Do you want to know what my dad's first comment about Azura's model was?
209800	212800	Because obviously I got him to react to my gen mates.
212800	218800	Just as a bit of a spoiler, my dad called Azura two fried eggs.
218800	227800	Now, we all know what he's referring to, because she has gold shielded plates on her front, right?
228800	231800	So he went, he went, her name's two fried eggs.
231800	240800	I was like, I did not fucking conceptualize Fondle of fucking Bism for two fried eggs.
240800	245800	I think I can't, off the top of my head, he called my model.
245800	252800	He obviously didn't recognize me, even though I've shown my, like I'm sure we've sat and watched me stream together.
252800	255800	And like we watched the Microsoft stuff and all that.
255800	262800	And he called me like a pink, pink knickers knee pants, and I was like, alright.
262800	264800	And then, and I was like, alright.
264800	268800	And she's also named after her dad's gamer tag anyway, Shonium.
268800	271800	And I'm like, yeah, I'll take it, Shonium, Shonium, yep.
272800	275800	I think, and then Mercy was the second one.
275800	280800	And he was like, he was like, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.
280800	283800	Well, he never said Mercy, because he doesn't know anyone's name.
284800	290800	And he was like, oh my God, she's not got any knickers as well.
290800	291800	What's going on here?
291800	296800	And I was like, uh, I was like, no one's got a scar, no one's got knickers.
296800	297800	But you know what?
297800	299800	I was surprised about it.
299800	301800	He called Amy cute.
301800	305800	I was like, are you, are you fucking, are you nailed her design?
305800	308800	She's the most adored, knee knickers, literally knee knickers McGee.
309800	312800	And he went, oh, Amy's really cute.
312800	314800	And I went, damn straight, Amy's cute.
314800	317800	So, dad's a cunny Vtuber confirmed.
319800	322800	That's my little sister, yeah.
324800	325800	So cute.
325800	327800	And she's funny too.
327800	330800	It literally sounds like you're saying the M bomb.
330800	331800	Oh shit.
331800	338800	In Britain to say, uh, uh, under where we say that word.
338800	342800	And it probably sounds a bit funny in my accent.
342800	345800	I promise I ain't saying none of them.
345800	346800	That shit.
346800	350800	We don't tolerate that shit for around these partners.
350800	354800	Uh, is this a, is this a controller game?
354800	355800	What is this?
355800	356800	Right.
356800	357800	Right.
357800	358800	Before we get into the game.
358800	359800	Boom.
359800	360800	Tell me what you think.
360800	361800	Let me know.
361800	362800	Right.
362800	363800	No.
363800	365800	Are you squidding me right now?
365800	366800	Anonymous.
366800	370800	Anonymous says papa cuttles is becoming an Oni-chan.
370800	371800	Honestly.
371800	374800	He absolutely nailed AC.
374800	375800	Oh my God.
375800	376800	He went, she looks cold.
376800	378800	And I was like, yes.
378800	380800	And then he went, she looks like ace.
380800	382800	And I was like, yeah.
382800	384800	Like I was going, I was flipped.
384800	385800	I was doing backflips.
385800	389800	Cause there's no way that my dad would actually physically, you know, come up with the actual
389800	390800	names of the characters.
390800	391800	It's not possible.
391800	394800	But I got him to react to some other people as well.
394800	397800	I got him to react to project melody.
397800	399800	And oh my God.
399800	403800	So I showed them their reference sheets that has their names on them.
403800	405800	But my dad didn't know that that was their name.
405800	406800	So they didn't count.
406800	409800	And on her reference sheet, it said 69.
409800	412800	And he went, he went futuristic 69 girls.
412800	413800	For project melody.
413800	415800	And I was like, oh my God.
415800	416800	Yes.
416800	417800	Like, oh my God.
417800	420800	He like, we looked at Poseidon.
420800	423800	So if he didn't know Poseidon from Mythos just got a new model.
423800	424800	And I showed that off.
424800	426800	And I was a bit of a twat.
426800	427800	I actually said her name.
427800	431800	I was like, oh, she's based after the mythological God Poseidon.
431800	434800	And then he went, oh, X rated Poseidon.
434800	436800	And I was like, yeah, yeah.
436800	437800	I'll take that.
437800	438800	I'll let her name slip.
438800	441800	But I literally futuristic 69.
441800	446800	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get mock logos for whatever he said.
446800	451800	The girls finalized names are like, miss me from being you.
451800	453800	Oh, sorry.
453800	454800	Anonymous.
454800	455800	Thank you for the tip.
455800	456800	Hi, strong.
456800	459800	Have you been keeping up with work since you passed out?
459800	462800	Um, not quite.
462800	463800	But so right.
463800	465800	Let's go over the.
465800	468800	Let's go over the schedule.
468800	469800	Okay.
469800	474800	So again, there's three short streams, a little to the left, two hours, roller coaster, tycoon,
474800	477800	two hours, little kitty, big city, two hours.
477800	478800	And then hold on a minute.
478800	480800	What's going on on the 25th?
480800	482800	ASMR is back.
482800	484800	Memberships are back.
484800	487800	ASMR streams back on the 26th.
487800	492800	Then we've got a watch along of a mysterious video.
492800	495800	I'm going to say it as a friend.
495800	498800	We are going to watch a friend that is debuting.
498800	501800	And I said to do it for free.
501800	503800	So we're going to support a friend.
503800	505800	And if you like her, please.
505800	508800	You're more than welcome to give her a cheeky subscribe.
508800	509800	Don't be surprised.
509800	514800	I might, I might see an exchange for me watching you live on stream, my friend.
514800	516800	You have to do ASMR with me.
516800	518800	No, ifs ands or buts.
518800	519800	Okay.
519800	521800	When is the debut?
521800	524800	On the 26th at 10 p.m.
524800	525800	E.D.T.
525800	526800	Nope.
526800	527800	That's life of Brian Watchlong.
527800	528800	Sorry.
528800	529800	Try again.
529800	531800	On the 26th of Friday at 8 p.m.
531800	532800	E.D.T.
532800	533800	Mystery Watchlong.
533800	534800	And you don't get to know who it is.
534800	535800	No.
535800	536800	No, you don't.
536800	537800	Why do you?
537800	539800	And then next is who wants to be a millionaire.
539800	540800	But hey ho.
540800	541800	What's up?
541800	542800	What's up?
542800	543800	What's up?
543800	544800	What's up?
544800	545800	Who wants to be a millionaire?
545800	546800	But hey ho.
546800	547800	What?
547800	548800	Wait, wait, wait.
548800	549800	What's the catch?
549800	553800	You get to see my heart rate monitor and I'm wearing my shock collar.
553800	559800	So every time I lose a round on who wants to be a millionaire, I get to shock myself.
559800	560800	Okay.
560800	566800	And then that gets followed into a member's ASMR where you see my heart rate and I shock
566800	570800	myself in the ASMR member's room as well.
570800	573800	And then old school RuneScape 99 Cooking.
573800	579800	Potentially we might be able to do it in one big 12 hour robot, okay?
579800	581800	Is it a little tight around the thigh area?
581800	586800	What do you mean you don't like my big fat lips?
586800	588800	Oh, the perfect.
588800	592800	We might be able to finish 99 Cooking, okay?
592800	598800	I am going to watch my gen mates in the background because I don't have time to watch them live.
598800	603800	So I'm going to pick two hour streams from each girl.
603800	608800	I'm going to do a little marshmallow thingy and that is our endurance beginning.
608800	609800	It is.
609800	612800	And what happens when we hit 99 Cooking?
612800	614800	We'll probably do some...
614800	619800	We'll give it a little break and then we'll come back and we'll actually just do some
619800	624800	questing because I've never actually properly done questing.
624800	629800	I did it with you guys for the first time properly and I want to do it again.
629800	633800	It was so fun questing and making sure like, come on, you know what it feels like?
633800	637800	It feels like I'm a teacher on a school trip with like a high vis vest on and like, come
637800	638800	on everyone.
638800	639800	No one gets left behind.
639800	640800	Make sure you've got your buddy.
640800	643800	Come together right next step.
643800	644800	I really enjoyed that.
644800	648800	So I'd like to do that again for the multiplayer game.
648800	653800	That is what's going to be considered the multiplayer game this week.
653800	657800	But yes, I'll have a bit of an update tomorrow.
657800	659800	About a few things behind the scenes.
659800	661800	We do love a few updates behind the scenes.
661800	663800	A few spoilers of the agency.
663800	666800	What do you mean agencies should hold freaking secrets?
666800	668800	I can't believe it.
668800	670800	You'll never get me.
670800	673800	You'll never take me alive.
673800	674800	Okay.
674800	675800	Right.
675800	678800	One thumbnail to show you.
678800	683800	Just one.
683800	685800	This is one thumbnail.
685800	687800	Spoilers from scrawny.
687800	688800	No way.
688800	691800	We're all open here.
691800	695800	When we get in her quick, her quest.
695800	697800	You know the answer to this one.
697800	699800	Are you sure?
699800	703800	What was as original and I've got phone a friend.
703800	704800	Let me see.
704800	705800	She be M.A. Marisa.
705800	709800	I could phone a friend for this question.
709800	711800	What was as original name?
711800	714800	Whole lot cleavage.
714800	719800	Grab them by the daddy.
719800	720800	We'll find out.
720800	721800	I love the news so much.
721800	725800	Answer Z.
725800	728800	I thought you guys would get a little giggle over that thumbnail.
728800	730800	Let me slurp my tea.
730800	732800	Has everything been going good?
732800	736800	I was quiet on the eastern front from my POV.
736800	742800	You guys haven't blown anything up while I've been away.
742800	746800	Someone says favorite game series you played on steam.
746800	754800	And are there any games you want to play but can't?
754800	758800	Any games I want to play but can't?
758800	760800	If you mean like from lack of skill?
760800	761800	Yes.
761800	766800	There's an insane amount of games that I want to stealing sea from my future YouTube career.
766800	768800	Do not call that.
768800	769800	That's terrible.
769800	770800	Fondalovism.
770800	772800	I'm such a good fucking name.
772800	774800	Everyone's rippin' into me for it.
774800	779800	Someone sent me a nexus mod for Skyrim but I'm too scared to open it.
779800	780800	Hey strongy.
780800	781800	I perceive this.
781800	784800	I hope that I don't have to explain why I'm showing this mod to you.
784800	785800	You want me to mod my Skyrim?
785800	786800	How dare you.
786800	789800	You don't want me to play vanilla Skyrim?
789800	790800	Okay.
790800	791800	Hi strongy.
791800	792800	Hi rippling.
792800	796800	Wanted to let you know your streams give me something to look forward to every day.
796800	801800	I feel like there's no amount of support that I can give that would adequately reflect a happy.
801800	804800	You do not have to give me anything.
804800	808800	Streaming isn't an exchange of goods and services okay.
808800	814800	I get to play my goofy games and then you get to be tormented by my goofy games.
814800	818800	And then everything is awesome.
818800	823800	We really are on the best timeline to have you look back after all that's happened.
823800	824800	I love you unironically.
824800	826800	I love you unironically too.
826800	829800	I'm glad you can enjoy what I put out.
829800	837800	I know I know I'm a bit special but my mummy caused me special too so it's fine.
837800	841800	Can't wait for the fangfully degenerate Skyrim theme.
841800	845800	I've been pondering the best way to say this so it's not too stupid.
845800	847800	This is the best I got.
847800	852800	I am not doing that short after the feedback I got.
852800	853800	So please don't worry.
853800	855800	I'm not going to do the short.
855800	858800	I didn't explain myself very well but long and short of it was basically.
858800	859800	Get tipped.
859800	860800	Get tipped.
860800	861800	Get tipped.
861800	863800	Thank you Spidey.
863800	864800	Not tiny Spidey.
864800	866800	You took infusion me.
866800	869800	What do you need to kiss because you both have the same name.
869800	870800	Well hold on a minute.
870800	871800	We ain't pin pals out here.
871800	872800	Hold on a minute.
872800	873800	Hold on a minute.
873800	874800	Thank you Spidey for the tip.
874800	875800	I appreciate it.
875800	876800	What a short.
876800	877800	Okay.
877800	881800	I will explain it in a bit more detail because my thoughts weren't very straightforward.
881800	882800	Okay.
882800	883800	Now here's the facts.
883800	892800	The Vealour announcement trailer has 100k thousand views on the Vealour YouTube channel.
892800	893800	Okay.
893800	895800	Now originally it was trending.
895800	896800	It was doing quite well.
896800	900800	I put some advertisement money into it but then we didn't actually need to have that much.
900800	910800	We had to, we could cancel them because a VTuber news covered us and then the video went trending
910800	912800	up to 100k views.
912800	919800	I was going to discuss a short about why the VTuber you watch might go absolute apeshit
919800	924800	if they make it on the VTuber news and it's because there's a correlation between new
924800	927800	eyes on you, new subscribers, new views, etc.
927800	928800	Okay.
928800	935800	I didn't explain it very well because my worry is that the channel you know is ran by a guy
935800	941800	and we follow idol culture but the focus wasn't about the guy.
941800	943800	The focus was like this is insider knowledge.
943800	947800	Like I was going to show you the graph from we got mentioned on this date and then you
947800	950800	see the graph and it just jumps right up type thing.
950800	951800	You know.
951800	953800	I've got nothing to have.
953800	956800	Oh I thought you were talking about making a short.
956800	959800	Yeah so that was what the short was about right?
959800	965800	And then I said please use Marshmallow for anonymous feedback because I know that not everyone,
965800	969800	you know you can't all reflect the shumer in one go type thing okay.
969800	974800	Hold on let me, let me slurp my teeth it's getting cold hold on.
974800	979800	But I've decided against doing it because I don't want to upset anyone and I know some
979800	983800	of you might be like oh that's perfectly fine because the focus isn't on that.
983800	987800	I don't want to alienate or upset anyone so I'm not going to.
987800	990800	So please don't worry okay.
990800	994800	Less than 20 minutes in and don't regret staying up for strong eight.
994800	996800	Oh that's so kind of you.
996800	1000800	I'm gradually, me who's literally just rambling about Q&A stuff.
1000800	1002800	I'm not even freaking played the game.
1002800	1004800	I'm not even started.
1004800	1006800	Yeah.
1006800	1011800	Someone says I have an unexplainable desire to hear your voice through a phone mic maybe
1011800	1013800	a Twitter space or something.
1013800	1014800	Is that weird?
1014800	1018800	Maybe there's just something endearing about unprofessional quality.
1018800	1022800	I'm going to put an iPhone headphone up my butt.
1022800	1028800	Does that count for your unprofessional quality in the audio?
1028800	1030800	I mean it may.
1030800	1034800	It may.
1034800	1037800	Wait I thought you guys were seriously about wanting that.
1037800	1039800	I was going to do it.
1039800	1043800	I mean what did she say?
1043800	1046800	Can't get more unprofessional than that.
1046800	1050800	Turns into an iPhone mic.
1050800	1055800	Hold on let me slow it with you.
1055800	1057800	That 360 mic that you could use.
1057800	1058800	Do it for science.
1058800	1059800	I'm with the science team.
1059800	1061800	You mean an AirPod?
1061800	1067800	No like it would be on the strings because I don't want to get lost up there you know.
1067800	1068800	Are you squidding me right now?
1068800	1070800	I would like talk to you while sitting inside you.
1070800	1074800	To be fair you could just ramble and I'd still love the stream.
1074800	1078800	I'm not like a Zatsun streamer.
1078800	1080800	I need like a mission objective.
1080800	1083800	Thank you Broly Legends for the super chat.
1083800	1086800	I need like a mission objective or else I can't do that.
1086800	1092800	When I was playing the Watamelin game this week or however you say it.
1092800	1095800	Why is the title German?
1095800	1097800	Hello, what's up?
1097800	1100800	Or did you not know I am German VTuber?
1100800	1103800	I love the schnitzel.
1103800	1109800	I like game spelling.
1109800	1110800	What's that?
1110800	1113800	You're just saying Dutch in front of German words.
1113800	1115800	I'm substituent.
1115800	1117800	Oh my god yes.
1117800	1120800	How did you not know that with my accent I am German?

2832360	2843320	i'm not sure if i believed all of that but i'm sure edie would have
2844280	2849240	uh
2854520	2859480	how bizarre this would be obvious later but my mom never told me any of these stories
2861000	2863560	edie would have but mom didn't like bringing up the past
2865240	2869960	though when we adopted a stray kitten uh-huh she was the one who named it molly
2870760	2881000	but okay let's go in the window i spent a lot of time in great grandma edie's room
2884680	2885960	her room was like a museum

3148120	3159080	would look it isn't in the cupboard it's hidden in this book okay how curious i'm still not sure

3170520	3174040	he developed photos red light
3177480	3180520	no i'm not doing exactly what you think i'm doing

3189240	3194360	explore the universe
3198680	3202280	it's just a story we feel visuals don't you agree is there anything over here that's
3202280	3205160	supposed to do is this like i do not cross does he pop his bogs
3210440	3214440	oh i was gonna jump down on it but i guess not uh right there's something i knew grandpa sam had a twin
3214520	3219800	and that he never talked about him so the command center
3221880	3224760	i guess my grandpa didn't like history anymore than my mom did
3232840	3239560	how i want to remember my brother by sanfinch the thing i remember is that one he made up his
3239560	3245000	mind that was it i broke his we foot
3249800	3253720	my brother said he'd die before you another mushroom and he did
3256600	3261960	at barbara's funeral we swore he'd never be afraid again and he wasn't
3262520	3266440	i think calvin always wanted to fly
3276920	3280360	that day he finally made up his mind to do it
3282840	3284840	i told him going around was impossible
3288680	3290040	maybe if i hadn't said that
3292920	3294840	forget are we going to do a circle let's go
3296680	3298200	maybe it's the one time i'm picked up
3300440	3302920	tell the one i can do the circle and maybe
3305960	3309960	oh shit i'm about to kill him wait a moment he's already made up his mind
3313880	3315800	that's why i remember about my brother
3317240	3320600	i think i'm about to pop his bogs if he does a circle hold on
3322520	3326520	this
3326520	3328520	hey
3339080	3340280	did he know learn to swim
3346120	3346440	what
3346440	3350440	it calvin's story felt strangely familiar
3350440	3353400	when i was younger i remember trying to do the exact same thing
3355800	3361640	a stony there's rocks below okay okay sorry okay i'm too slow for this game i think
3364680	3368520	okay right okay i may have just perished that child but you can't prove it
3369240	3372680	okay oh he's got to be plaque thing in here like that wife draws
3372680	3378600	after the funeral oh eddie roped off calvin's house the room
3379480	3384840	oh roped off okay i understand the company mom said grab a sam enlisted at 18 and
3384840	3388600	never set foot in the room again oh i went into the army
3395160	3398840	the hungry caterpillar or something
3399640	3404840	oh what is that i looked a bit too
3409800	3410040	made
3416040	3421000	wait all the finches have popped their clogs but me the passages were a pretty tight fit
3422280	3424840	they'd obviously been built for smaller hands and bellies
3429240	3435320	okay that's the hallway right that's fine you're the last finch alive i believe it
3440120	3443400	growing up i always thought of barbara as a child star
3445240	3449560	okay i never thought about how hard it must have been for her afterwards
3450200	3459160	i hear that some people get a very unique complex after stardom is over
3461560	3467320	the thing moldy do not eat that she can't even eat yeah like stardom can cause like
3467320	3469720	you some you know very strange
3473720	3478040	of all the stories people wrote about barbara's death i'm surprised eddie saved this one
3479000	3479960	why is it real
3485400	3494040	old jack here with another ghastly tale inspired by america's most unfortunate family
3494840	3500840	i'm calling it the surprise ending of barbara rich
3501320	3508360	as a child star barbara was famous for her screen
3511320	3515800	now at 16 she was all washed up her has been
3517400	3524120	but in a lucky break she'd been asked to perform her signature scream at a local convention for
3524120	3527720	monster movie fans it was just the boost
3530680	3534840	unfortunately her scream hadn't aged where
3538520	3543800	me i think you just need the right motivation her biggest fan
3546280	3549560	either or was about to demonstrate when
3549560	3560440	now that is that will help it was barbara's father saying he'd slipped into a table saw
3560440	3567400	and had to be rushed to the emergency room so barbara that stuck babysitting her youngest
3567400	3572120	brother walter a convention comeback was cancelled
3572840	3581640	okay i'm hearing frustration but i'm not hearing terror what if i tried a gang of hoodlums
3581640	3585480	in halloween mass have been terrorizing orca's island tonight police are urging residents
3587480	3592440	that came from the basement you're right i came for the basement i loved your delivery on that
3593000	3598040	why is your basement door locked because my dad likes making puzzles and secret passages
3598760	3605080	there's a key hidden in the music box the secret is to keep winding and winding
3605960	3610360	until finally the key pops out thanks babe i'll be back in a sec

3904680	3910680	what
3910680	3914680	what
3921880	3927480	she saw what kind of monsters they were and she realized what was about to happen
3934680	3940680	i know brandy Barbara Finch gave the performance of her life
3946680	3954040	i wasn't there myself but i hear Barbara was magnificent
3955080	3963800	poor girl she had a taste for stardom but unfortunately so did her fans
3964600	3970680	of course the police blamed it all on poor rick who disappeared the same night
3971560	3979480	and little walter hiding under his bed the whole time he took it all pretty hard
3980040	3988520	but that's another story as for Barbara tucked inside the music box is all they ever found of her
3989480	3990520	her
3991880	3997640	oh now that's what i call a real fear retail
4005240	4007160	oh that was good
4011880	4016440	that was very unique that one he told me all Barbara wanted was to be remembered
4016520	4021240	as absurd as that comic was maybe what edie saw was a happy ending
4024120	4024440	how
4027080	4029880	okay so we know we need to go to the music box
4031640	4036920	but we can't unlock these doors we need to go back in the ear on the back the end
4036920	4040840	boo that joke sucks i guess now i know my mom doesn't like me playing with the music box
4041560	4044120	what oh what rub an eerie tale
4047720	4054520	there we go we got them in 40 i've already forgotten what the box unlocks uh oh the basement
4054520	4060440	the basement the basement i remember it's all about reading between the lines of this game
4060440	4068600	what is your guess and how she died um i need to read oh god i have to think wait a minute i
4068600	4076520	thought i didn't have to think in this game keep going keep going keep going keep going hey big
4076520	4083000	hey we uh she died a ligma you know what that's funny but you're not allowed to say that
4084600	4093080	okay we're in the boss mints any basement dwellers i dwell the basement in fact i am the biggest
4093080	4098920	basement dweller of law i was like a bit the idea of a basement but they're not a thing
4100680	4105160	mom said the basement was off limits unless i wanted another tetanus shot
4105160	4113000	sudden not living disease the shift oh these are the bases of where we put our dead family
4113000	4119400	members faces on hmm what were you making you were making a dragon concept of the sleigh they guess
4120360	4124760	that's where he messed up his hand i saw eddie sneak down to the basement once
4125560	4130360	carrying packages what kind of packages right let's see what's in the fridge she was hiding
4130360	4139160	presents what's in the fridge oh turned out she was hiding a lot more than that can i go in please
4140920	4145000	i can hardly see nothing don't worry if you can't see nothing i can't see nothing either
4145000	4149400	we're in the same boat here because my name i remember asking mom once about where walter had
4149400	4155400	gone we have a main shaft under the house he got as far away as he could
4157720	4164840	we got folly bunker oh this is kind of cool stories down here wait one
4166680	4172040	anonymous careful i think mercy's hating the dead senpai's down here you leave mercy out of
4172040	4179000	she made i think it's that none of us has gotten very far wait this is so cool though sorry this
4179000	4190440	is cool yes walter walter white i like everyone just have a goodbye everyone oh i can't believe i've
4190440	4199160	been down here for 30 years he just rolled on that first day after the shaking started i didn't
4199160	4202280	think i survived
4206280	4212760	oh i lived as a hermit but after a few days i settled into a routine that's what kept me sane
4216760	4218920	having a stable living for today
4221720	4224280	mm mango they always expected to be dead tomorrow
4224840	4229000	January 1976
4234840	4240040	here i was rumbling they're tumbling but let me adjust on my chair and putting my feet up
4241400	4245000	even a monster on the other side of the door starts to feel normal
4245560	4251960	almost friendly did he have agriphobia and you couldn't go outside
4255960	4258040	and then one day everything just
4261240	4270440	2005 yes whatever that thing was it was gone maybe you got tired of waiting
4271400	4274600	he thought maybe i just got tired of being afraid
4277160	4283320	ate too much peaches and died of confusion got botchers and via cans it's been a week now
4283880	4295960	the longest in 30 years uh-huh i'm done waiting i have to leave well i still can okay okay let's
4295960	4299320	this let's do it let's do it
4303400	4307640	play easily easy we're an old man i don't call much exercise in this
4313640	4315400	i know it's out there somewhere
4319800	4321000	whatever killed barbra
4321240	4327160	murder the cat
4339320	4344840	any break the wall maybe this is all a mistake with sleigh time or no shovel
4345000	4351880	but i need to stop living the same day even if it kills me
4358120	4362280	whatever's out there i want you to know i'm ready for it
4362280	4367880	this is a train track so that explains the shaking i'm going to appreciate all of it especially the food
4367880	4376120	i don't mind if i only have a year left why have we got a timer for a month
4377720	4379320	maybe we should get up a train track
4385000	4387320	yeah i can already imagine the sun
4387320	4395240	i mean
4400040	4400360	yeah
4402360	4407880	walter died when i was six i can't believe my mom never told me he was down here
4412520	4414760	a truly a cursed family honestly
4417880	4422200	i'm sure my mom was trying to protect me
4423960	4429400	is this like a window yeah i was actually really smart sorry that's really smart
4430360	4435560	little plywood behind there you could say he followed his train of thought
4440120	4445160	oh okay i mean look i'm just trying to bring light to the game like relaxed
4445160	4452440	do we use the letters dolti
4454120	4456120	maybe she was afraid i'd end up like walter
4459160	4461320	he went a little off the rails
4463160	4466120	but if she might call me about an uncle under the house
4468200	4470680	i can only imagine what else she was hiding
4470680	4473800	it's like all his supplies just been showing me i guess
4473880	4476120	i don't want to make the same mistakes she made
4478360	4480360	trying to bury something that's still alive
4484600	4490840	i think that i have the only one of us left or maybe two i think i have the emotional
4490840	4497720	intelligence of like a jellyfish because am i supposed to be crying no i wonder i think if
4497720	4500680	you because you told me i would be sad
4503640	4508120	yeah i found out what happened to everyone else i think you just told me it was sad my
4508120	4511880	brain's like proper prepared but now i'm worried the stories themselves might be the problem
4513000	4519880	i know my brain is over prepared maybe we believed so much in a family curse we made it real
4520760	4523560	oh it's just me memorial
4524920	4526440	kind of like later or anything
4529880	4534920	just experience but okay okay okay i i know over i don't know if i should even be writing this
4536600	4537560	you can write what you look
4540600	4541160	light head
4543640	4545800	maybe it'd be better if all this just died with me
4546440	4553080	me a bit more bits a bit more of a silent a bit more bits but i thought you should know about
4553080	4565000	your family who i'm a finch and the history you're a part of the monka family curse the
4565000	4568200	monka one to be honest i feel as lost as you probably do right now
4569080	4581080	i think the people in these stories believed them for what that's worth
4581400	4591960	me
4596760	4603880	okay i can look at the house yeah that history of imagination and stubbornness and madness
4605640	4607160	any of it seems possible
4607160	4615080	i was gonna say that game keeping anything out it's for accessory
4620760	4625080	i think we've been surrounded by death for so long we've just gotten used to it
4626200	4631320	i am going to do one thing what kind of family finishes building a cemetery before starting the
4631320	4640040	house no is that real oh that's rough it's embarrassing for me to admit this but
4642440	4646120	that's rough the cemetery may be more uncomfortable than the human one
4647960	4651160	three of the gerbils are mine and two had been my fault
4651160	4660360	zui's derpy lurpy furpy chirpy burpy derpy derpy junior lucid easy charlie tucker co-co-rip
4661160	4665480	and bailey of course oh wait is bailey a person i think bailey may be a person
4666520	4670920	oh there's another one bob shadow oliver christopher
4671400	4675320	what
4678840	4682200	spend up the house but it was edie who designed the cemetery
4691480	4694120	oh i get you i was a look in the past the cat was a past
4694680	4705480	oh that's adorable wait did they all have that no they don't hey you be
4707720	4715160	ah i'm not smart enough oh right she got her own star i'm sure odin's monument had been edie's idea
4716200	4720440	my mom was always trying to move on but three the past never went away
4721320	4723480	she's thinking how
4726600	4729480	she could see it poking out of the water at low tide
4733960	4735960	that's the previous house
4740280	4744440	magalek's one edie said she dreamed about the old house every night
4745400	4749880	oh it's got a caution boy that goes in the water
4751800	4752600	did anything else
4757240	4759000	was this supposed to be anything hope not
4762360	4764040	the old house and all that was wrong
4767000	4769320	edie's side was always easier for me to understand
4770280	4771000	yeah
4772920	4776600	but the older i get the more i can see where my mom was coming from
4779800	4783320	her dad had been pretty strict but it wasn't enough to save her brothers
4783320	4785240	she was just trying to do better
4789160	4794200	she lost two of her brothers just like i did i get why she tried so hard to protect us
4794840	4801720	got so far we never found melton's body so my mom insisted we were putting up a monument
4801720	4810600	not a tombstone we never found a body aren't we about to come across the skeleton
4811800	4817880	there's so many things i wish i could ask my mom now part of me thinks this is what she wanted
4817880	4824360	all along for me to come back someday and find everything out for myself
4828040	4832360	this wood is fantastic they don't make wood like this anymore
4834200	4839640	this has been years in the making and it's still stable and all but looking back on it now
4843080	4845400	if she told me there was going to be so much climbing
4845640	4849400	i never would have come when i was 22 weeks pregnant
4850280	4856040	oh is she your prego you're 17 and 22 weeks pregnant hold on a minute i thought you were 17

4869240	4875400	wane and her bailey i never met her as him but i think he and my mom had a lot in common
4877240	4880120	well it chilled up for a very short lifespan
4883160	4884600	they were both pretty intense
4887000	4893880	whoa my oh she caught me was she so smart so they aren't cursed they're just stupid honestly i

6020920	6027080	we're looking the people melton there's no death the only thing he left behind was a room full of
6027080	6031560	paintings there's no death notice that there's no death number

6053000	6067560	i do not have that kind of strength i'mma tell you that right now i do not have that kind of strength
6067560	6074840	okay
6074840	6076120	it's a story

6107160	6109960	the door opens and he says adieu

6135720	6140600	let's go down mom spent months searching for my brother and she sealed the doors
6145240	6147800	is there anything there's nothing special about it
6159960	6165800	i mean whatever melton had found in the house mom didn't want it getting out
6166200	6170920	they're rather strange
6175400	6181800	these are just to be in my way classic it's a metaphor in it oh don't i need that i
6181800	6184600	honestly need logic to understand how to stuff in the game
6188440	6193160	it's fine we'll just lift you up you don't need playing okay thank you because i have no upper body
6193160	6200200	strength any lake challenge give me a lake to be blamed eddie but i think louis blamed himself
6201240	6207240	after he graduated he just spent more and more time in his room until mom got him a job at the cannery
6209720	6215720	i mean some jobs can give you purpose everyone always told me to stay out of louis's room
6216520	6217400	except louis
6218120	6224120	i'm curious oh we cannot go that way don't don't think we can go that way
6227400	6230920	oh we're in a boat they used to live in a boat
6237320	6239080	it's heavy but we're doing it
6239960	6243960	he used to get high in a boat honestly
6245480	6253000	louis's room smelled very very familiar that part of him lived on past the weed past the liquor
6254760	6259000	louis spent a lot of time doing zaza i can't remember but he was surprisingly bad at them
6259720	6260520	he died a lot
6262680	6267800	you got high school diploma oh wait do you actually get that do you guys get an actual certificate
6267800	6270120	when you finish high school like this
6273480	6274360	uh we don't have this
6276120	6282120	he was so proud of being indian i think for him it was a way to oh you do all this fantastic
6282120	6286600	just a pinch oh that's cute how cute adorable i love it
6288840	6289720	oh here we go
6289800	6291800	uh
6297240	6299000	psycho institute psychology
6299000	6304920	as louis's psychiatrist i can understand your desire for an explanation as i see it the trouble
6304920	6309960	began in january shortly after we convinced your son to seek treatment for substance abuse
6310840	6315080	newly sober i believe louis first noticed the monotony of his daily life
6321080	6322440	he kept working at the canon
6324600	6329320	but he withdrew part of himself in our sessions i saw the same behavior
6331240	6332520	his mind began to
6333480	6336600	do substance abuse
6338520	6339320	i can't reach it
6342520	6348760	can't reach i shoved my hand in this oh yeah no you can touch it it's fine i'm telling you wonder
6351000	6351320	oh
6355480	6356920	i asked him to describe it
6357240	6364200	he said he started small imagining a labyrinth
6365960	6367160	he'd feel his way about
6371320	6373480	then something moved that's
6375880	6376520	and turns
6376520	6377080	it's
6382920	6384680	we've got a cape like magic to gathering
6386840	6388600	and things that have not names
6391480	6392920	he knew it was all in his head
6399560	6404040	but he took it very seriously i had hoped he'd find himself
6405000	6407160	a cheeky bit of psychosis
6408360	6410920	i can't believe playing winscape mid-game sorry guys
6410920	6412120	but he found something more
6413720	6414200	the drugs
6416760	6417960	i worried about him then
6419640	6420920	they were dreaming at the canary
6423000	6424200	i spoke with his boss
6426440	6428760	but he said louis had become a model employee
6430040	6432200	methodical tires focused
6432600	6437160	but he secretly daydream in like all the time a whole new louis
6441640	6442760	so i let him go on
6444520	6445880	is that our first mistake
6449800	6451160	i even encouraged him
6453480	6455240	it seemed very promising at first
6458040	6460600	psychosis means we can't he told me he'd made a new friend
6462760	6469240	on the edge of a city he named louis topia
6471160	6473480	he built city up slowly brick by brick
6476200	6477400	then he made musicians
6486600	6487880	and songs for them to play
6492200	6493720	he talked about starting a band
6497800	6498920	and he was always humming
6502760	6505000	every day his imagination grew stronger
6510440	6512120	he no longer spoke at the canary
6515000	6516200	everything was in his head
6516200	6517480	his chopping was as reliable as ever
6519400	6520680	then one day it struck him
6523080	6523720	it struck him
6523720	6525320	at all the cheering crowds
6526040	6527560	even the stones under his feet
6529560	6531640	more desirable than reality
6533480	6535080	so he could do whatever he wished
6537400	6538440	and he became king
6540440	6542040	he held an election for me
6545640	6546280	and he won
6549160	6549960	mario reference
6550520	6551880	they begged him to stay
6551880	6553640	but his mind was already wandering
6555800	6557320	it became a game for him
6563480	6564680	now you can see a life of the
6564680	6566760	conquer city then immediately push on
6571320	6571960	new louis
6574760	6577080	notice how the chopin's choir as well
6577080	6577800	saint louis
6580920	6583400	he started drifting away from our reality
6588440	6589800	a little bit of a crash but it's okay
6591240	6592600	no i didn't expect the wind
6593080	6595560	until one day he forgot to go home from the canary
6597880	6599640	even as his mother pleaded with him
6600440	6602040	part of louis kept sailing on
6609960	6619080	in louisburg he heard rumors of her
6625480	6626920	handsome queen wait hold on a minute
6629240	6630920	hold on a minute a pretty queen
6631400	6634200	no i'm a messed up did i do the wrong choice
6636280	6638360	the queen was on her own quest for
6639960	6641880	radiant rainbows
6650440	6651960	sorry let's try that again
6653320	6656440	sorry i ain't got that kind of action you know
6658440	6659720	he followed the sound of her
6660680	6661640	silver heart
6665320	6666200	silver heart
6666200	6668360	we are literally just doing middle
6668360	6670040	earth right now sorry i said it
6679160	6680280	i'm coming my queen
6682360	6686520	his chase led him to a golden palace east of the sun and west of the moon
6686520	6690120	yeah what's inside the palace
6690120	6692360	even then his logic remained sound
6692920	6694280	we can't see nothing now
6694520	6696520	oh
6698040	6700520	there's my world was all in his imagination
6707480	6711960	i'm trying i'm trying to get rid of the difficulties on screen
6711960	6713400	proud of having created it
6717000	6720280	in his own eyes he becomes something greater than a king
6724600	6728520	that's a lot of servants or warriors
6729080	6733240	for someone who'd never known success in the real world i think it was overwhelming
6736680	6741000	and then it struck him that the real louis was not the one chopping salmon
6741720	6744200	but the one climbing the steps of the golden palace
6744760	6745880	i'm marrying his queen
6745960	6747960	hmm
6752040	6754680	my imagination is as real as my body
6754680	6757960	he told me it was hard to argue with him
6765800	6767160	so what happened
6769560	6771240	do you wonder which walker is his
6776760	6780360	why he took too much ellis
6780360	6781960	began to forget the world we know
6789400	6792600	i think it pained him to remember louis the cannery worker
6796760	6801960	did he self end the game question mark
6802440	6808040	he began to despise the man with a royal contempt
6814040	6818040	did what happens if i interact i don't know
6821480	6822200	does he sell
6825080	6826680	i still thought i could save him
6827720	6829640	oh he ends the game
6829640	6833160	even after he said he was being crowned king over all the lands of wonder
6835080	6840120	uh oh maybe the palace would be packed with his companions
6845720	6846600	maybe he doesn't
6849720	6853320	i don't i don't know how likely he doesn't but
6854040	6857000	including the wise calico and his sister don't advise him
6861000	6867000	molly
6867960	6870680	i'm enjoying the wind
6879160	6881320	his queen waited holding his crown
6885320	6886280	that guillotine
6889080	6890680	that's a guillotine

6982440	6994680	i wish we'd stayed but i understand why we left
7000920	7003080	my mom ended up leaving everything behind
7004040	7005400	she didn't care for it
7013720	7019640	is that our father oh okay no what happened that night had been coming for a long time
7021560	7025640	what happened that maybe it should have come sooner did she hang herself
7028040	7029320	did she hang herself
7029560	7033240	i'm a little bit nervous
7035720	7037880	but it had to end one way or another
7039560	7042840	what did you do all that's left now is to tell you about that last night
7046360	7048680	wait those are the statues that come in for me
7052360	7053320	i'm scared i don't
7053320	7058360	i don't want to see my prego belly
7068040	7072200	that whole last day edie just watched his pack and didn't say a word
7073800	7076200	until supper when she raised her glass and said
7077160	7086120	to our final night together and all our final nights apart grandma you know what i said about alcohol
7086120	7093000	some of your medications are very specific i left a present for you in the hallway why don't you go open it
7093560	7100920	the grown-ups have to argue now i'm sorry you're right we're all leaving tomorrow let's just enjoy our laps
7100920	7104040	i'm not leaving edith you're excused
7106760	7113160	are you squidding me right now
7118120	7122280	the power had been shut off that morning but edie always had plenty of candles
7123400	7126920	when my mom said the library i don't think she knew about the other entrance
7128040	7129720	or that edie had a key to it
7131960	7134040	i don't think i'm gonna like what i'm saying
7136680	7138040	i'm nervous
7140520	7144680	i think you're afraid of isn't going to end when you leave the house
7150280	7156040	edith has a right to know these stories my children are dead because of your stories
7156680	7159400	i think it's best if edith and i leave tonight
7159640	7166600	we'll have the nursing home spend a van for you in the morning okay
7175800	7183080	dear edith there's so many stories i wish i could tell you but there's only time for one
7183640	7186840	this is about what happened on the night you were born
7187800	7192680	hmm that night the tide went way way out
7195240	7201000	it was the first and last time i ever saw the old house aground
7202840	7206200	there'd been an earthquake out in the middle of the ocean
7208040	7212280	they called it the lowest tide in a thousand years
7213000	7221800	god it smelled awful you know i've seen that house every day of my life
7227320	7229800	but i never thought i'd go back to it
7233800	7237480	when the fog rolled in i lost my way
7242360	7247480	i got turned around
7258040	7260200	for a while i wondered
7263960	7269480	i started seeing things
7272680	7278840	things i'd forgotten had ever existed
7284200	7292360	but when i saw them they felt like old friends that night a lot of things came back to me
7293960	7296360	or maybe i came back to them
7297160	7303960	i like the detail that is settled on the house because of the water
7307240	7313480	things i can't explain but that i need you to try and edith what are you doing in here
7314440	7317720	it's mine edith mom you're gonna rip it let go
7318680	7325000	i kicked in screen but mom's driving a car
7327000	7331080	so we're about to finish it i never saw a great grandma edie again
7334040	7339320	me the next morning the van came to pick her up but she was already gone
7341880	7344440	gone is in after that we moved around a lot
7347960	7358440	we both tried to make the best of it
7363320	7364440	a few years went by
7378600	7380040	my mom didn't like to talk about it
7383240	7385160	but she started getting sick a lot
7388120	7389640	the rest happened pretty quickly
7392760	7395720	yeah shit she got better for a while
7399080	7399640	she didn't
7404280	7405240	and then i was alone
7407960	7411960	the last inch left alive
7417320	7418520	until i found out about you
7420200	7424520	her egg was prego i'm still not sure what to tell you about all this
7427560	7431160	if we lived forever maybe we'd have time to understand things
7432520	7436520	but as it is i think the best we can do is try to open our eyes
7438520	7442920	well your family appreciate how strange and brief all of this is
7446280	7447720	is that her cervix
7452520	7454200	this journal was supposed to be for you
7456360	7457560	are we in utero
7457560	7466440	it's better not be the birth canal
7471800	7473640	it's the pregnancy is more for real
7475960	7480440	i just want to meet you and tell you all these stories myself
7482200	7483800	but i guess if you're reading this now
7484520	7488360	things didn't work out that way
7496840	7501320	she died this is where your story begins i'm sorry i won't be there to see it
7502040	7508600	it's a lot to ask but i don't want you to be sad that i'm gone i want you to be amazed
7508600	7512360	that any of us ever had a chance to be here at all good luck
7514280	7514780	you
7519160	7520360	oh my boy
7544120	7544520	you
7557640	7558120	that's it
7560840	7563160	i guess he really is what remains of edith's finch
7563160	7574920	um i'm sorry
7577240	7585400	right i think i think for future reference if i'm ever gonna play a sad game don't tell
7585400	7592280	me it's a sad game because i mentally shielded myself from like greeting my eyes out
7594120	7599240	and i think i over shielded myself to the point where i was like yeah i guess
7603640	7605640	is there a disgust about you
7609160	7616280	that was curious i'm not sure what i think because i have the emotional intelligence
7616280	7621720	of a camel that it didn't really hit i'm not the demographic like
7623880	7629080	but is it objectively bad no not at all not at all
7631320	7633800	and the achievement says thanks johan
7638840	7643720	yeah you cried only for seeing john wick marrying a girl without a name dying after this yeah
7644840	7649800	wait you just got here and started the game the stream and it's over uh i have terrible news yeah
7650360	7659240	um my dad is still here so i can only detour streams for a wee bit but it is over here
7661720	7669080	question i often hear you're autistic are you really yes i am does that make you love me even more
7669080	7679160	and actually you want my sweaty hands and feet on your face that was very creative very curious
7679880	7687400	um you couldn't tell literally listen to the brotherhood stream and tell me what you
7687400	7691800	tell me what you think after that okay what did anonymous say anonymous said i can understand
7691800	7696440	wanting to escape the real world and live in a fantasy where you're the hero your own story
7696440	7700280	psychedelic or not everyone wants to be seen as special yes and then just think of it
7701800	7709000	uh yes uh psychosis is such a dangerous thing to even like comprehend because what you see is
7709000	7714680	reality that other person has absolutely no perception of it is it's fascinating if you get
7714680	7722680	into it but it's actually really hard to deal with um like if you at least based on why is the
7722680	7730200	child got shot hey what's going on here oh my god it's us playing chess next week 1v1 me and chess
7730200	7738760	right now uh this room made me feel some things i need to wipe my eyes okay it is very clear the

7770600	7773080	um
7776680	7786920	the edith finch team took him five years to spawn that the end yeah i mean that was i did not
7786920	7795480	expect the graphics at all that was like pretty insane honestly i did not expect any of that
7796360	7803720	and that was such a unique narrative storyline um all of that kind of thing going on as well
7804920	7811800	yeah i don't think i've cried at a piece of media in years oh god yours really are

8466440	8470680	you only share with us the timestamp the same way i would greatly appreciate not seeing the

8481240	8492280	okay i think i can do that i yeah yeah i think i can do that okay good thing you asked because
8492280	8499080	i was going to just straight up put it on my stream in the corner um it would give the girls
8499080	8504600	more views as usual yes okay mod's put the reefling in the timer box wait what did you do
8506120	8511400	Scottish and then you pronounce the t inkling language wow you do something like

8518280	8525640	i'm confused by the request oh i think it just means like it doesn't go in front of the
8525640	8530760	gameplay and stuff because i would have to layer it on top of the gameplay and then i can like
8530760	8534520	pin what the vodas were watching and like you can see the timestamp so anyone who comes in can
