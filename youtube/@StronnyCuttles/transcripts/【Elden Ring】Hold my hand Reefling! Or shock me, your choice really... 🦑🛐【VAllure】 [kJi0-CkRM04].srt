1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,880
I think I'll go in the corner today as if there's some sort of exiled beach over here.

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,680
It doesn't really matter if I'm in the corner or not.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,200
I think I'll accidentally hide my runes in the bottom right widget if I go onto the

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,200
that side so we're not going to go right in the corner for once.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,640
A Christmas mirror, honestly, I don't know.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,920
Right, I've just been prompted that I can put YouTube ads on, which I think means

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,920
a stream's up, first of all.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Hello, America, hiya, hello.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,520
You know the funniest thing about being a little bit late to streamers?

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Is that no one goes, oh no, she's cancelled because it's not even conceivable that I'm

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
not streaming.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,000
That's my favourite concept, instead of like, oh, she's late, she must be sick, she has

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,560
to cancel type thing.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,720
It's like, nah, she gambled away the house.

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,520
She hates us, she does, like, it's actually rather entertaining.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,480
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon, do we have some good fucking use of yellow

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,800
headquarters a day?

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,120
If I'm not mistaken, and I don't want to spoil it, so I need to go look for it to make sure

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:50,320
it's there, and T, yes, it's there, and T minus four hours.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:02:01,680
None other than Azura Dooley has been successfully monetised on YouTube, bips out in awe, round

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,920
of applause for Azura's milky titties, she's been monetised, and now I'm allowed to talk

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,520
about what the fuck happened with Azura's monetisation, she got denied monetisation,

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,280
and I had to make poor Azura read a script, and she, in the script, she was like, hi YouTube,

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,840
well, in her voice, hi YouTube, I am Azura Dooley, a creator from America, I am a YouTuber,

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,880
so I did not show my body, I can't do her voice, but poor Azura had to like, do this

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:49,440
super serious freaking video for me, and I had to like, screenshot her channel, and she

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,640
had to be like, and I play video games, and it was so annoying, because obviously you

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,520
had to use normie terms, so poor Azura had to be like, and my fans are so excited to

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,920
enjoy my membership stream, and support me via super chat, because we were trying to go

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,800
for like, if you monetise her, you'll be in the money, because you had money, money, money

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,680
at the end of the day, so Azura did that, and we had to send in the appeal all behind

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,760
the scenes, because obviously I didn't want to be like, one of the talents who'd been

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,360
freaking denied monetisation, that's awful, an entire month for her to get monetised,

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,240
no, bad, however, I do have a slight announcement about that Azura stream, you read it right,

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,160
it is handcam, and she's also taking doodle requests, that money is gonna help her move

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,880
out, don't I make myself clear, that money that she makes, yeah, is gonna help her move

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,400
out, okay, so I don't want to see one fucking gritty day comment, I don't want to see it,

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,320
it's gonna help her move out, and what happens if mummy Azura moves out, mummy Azura is free

39
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,960
to make even more content, okay, so anyone that, oh Azura, you don't do ASMR, no plays

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,720
on your channel, oh, so you don't, you don't, I'm doing enough ASMR, guess what, if she

41
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,720
moves out, what do you think happens, hmm, hmm, right, put two and two together, what

42
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
do you think happens when she moves out, she makes more content, put your money where your

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,440
move is, hmm, hmm, that's what I thought, that's what I thought, that's terrible, my voice

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,200
is broken beyond repair, unfortunately it is cracking, the original plan was none other

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,560
than 12 hours of Elden Ring, I can't believe I'm so sorry to announce this refling, she

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,960
moves out, my cock goes up, honestly all the bleeding hearts agree with that, is that a new

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,320
mantra for the bleeding hearts, she moves out, my cock goes up, that's terrible, I'm

48
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,640
hilarious, hmm, are you getting a roommate, funny you mentioned that, I actually said

49
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:19,080
Azura, she can come with me if she wants, and, and she was like down for it and I'm

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,560
like, well there is a problem of migration, you know that tiny little problem of like

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,240
packing up your whole life and moving country, she can live with me, oh live with me if you

52
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,080
want to come, Streamer House is real, we, I've not been funny, it was discussed at Vail or

53
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,600
Headquarters, the possibility, however, the money you need and able to run a Streamer

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,160
House, you basically have to accept there's a deficit debt already on top of how to run

55
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
the company, now very thankfully the way that this company's structured, there's really

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,320
not much overhead at all, again, it's free to produce thumbnails, the girls can stream

57
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,280
what you want, it doesn't cost me $5 for Azura to put up an ASMR stream, you know what I

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,200
mean, obviously the models cost a lot of money but that deficit gets paid over time,

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,320
like I'm going to have ASMR role play come out and a lot of them are going to pay off

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,320
some of the things, imagine all the months from now, literally could you imagine us banging

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,160
on each other's door like, I'm trying to record ASMR, stop, well I was going to say something

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,160
highly inappropriate there, stop banger-basting yourself for Twitter audio, I'm trying to

63
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:40,680
record ASMR right now, yes, imagine if she moves it, well she actually did message me,

64
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,280
but you didn't hear this from me okay but this is Inside Our Secrets, she messaged me

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,520
and she said I'm really looking forward to doing YouTube role plays, which I'm really

66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,720
glad about because I'm worried about overworking them but she's on the same page, she's got

67
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,840
her July audios to record first, which she should hopefully, well she's fucking getting

68
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,720
steaming the night, I see steaming right now, she's getting steaming on box shot roulette,

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
you guys are going to, I don't know if she's played it before but whoa that game's kind

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,760
of hard to wrap your head around a little bit, but would I say that to them honestly,

71
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,600
I don't think you understand that being under the umbrella of a slang makes you really comfortable

72
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,040
with people, like it just does, like I feel really comfortable around the girls, I feel

73
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,640
like I could show a picture of my floof and be like just something to look right here

74
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,960
and the girls would be like mmm I ain't you need to get that checked out, like I think

75
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,360
that's the degree of comfort, like if I had the wee hang on my wee bit and I'd be like

76
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,120
ahhh, so yeah, for me anyway, yes I am not comfortable, how does it, how does it freaked

77
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:58,840
out please with you, oh no, oh no, this can't be, oh no, we're at 8000.2 subscribers, oh

78
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:18,400
no, this can't be, you can't do this to me, oh no, right, one pound free food, right,

79
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,000
all looks good in the neighbourhood so I think we can get started, is there anything

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,400
that I missed whilst I was passed out asleep, anything, oh I need to be able to see, now

81
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:39,160
I know brightness 10 bad but so if it was barely visible, I can actually still see that

82
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,840
at the one but I feel like the stream can't you see it so obviously for stream reasons,

83
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,720
no don't discard that, I like it, I just say hi, I don't wanna spoil a good game here,

84
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:02,840
so we have played the base game before and we've just never played the DLC, actually

85
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:15,040
don't know how it gets activated, oh no, I think we did Samurai last time, why is Wretch

86
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:23,240
need to, I confess there uses, see I need a two handed heavy hitter, a warrior is a two

87
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,800
handed heavy hitter I think, you have to defeat this character to IS, I'm going to totally

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,920
remember, I think warrior, I want to do two handed like wha bam, slow down, are you squidding

89
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,760
me right now, no you're not, just tuning in, are we actually shocking strongy, I thank

90
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,840
you for the five delay lover, I feel you'll be fucking ecstatic cos there was monetising

91
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:59,920
during our celebration stream today, I bought this fricking shocker and in order to connect

92
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:09,320
the bluetooth, it wants my phone number, not gonna be nasty but it's, I mean I know things

93
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,720
already have my phone number, blah blah blah blah blah, I like tick tocks in a container

94
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
on my phone, blah blah blah blah, but it's like no you're not allowed to progress without

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,440
giving us your actual number cos we're gonna send you a verification code, I'm like a verification

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:34,680
code to shock myself, I don't trust it, I don't, I don't think it's right, and it's

97
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:42,360
actually really fucking weird cos that's not how technology should work, yeah I already

98
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,960
bought the software, oh sorry I already bought the hardware, but the software is behind a

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,920
verification code, why do I need to verify with my personal phone number in order to

100
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,520
shock myself, so sitting on my desk fully charged to the left, literally shock caller

101
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,800
wants to know your location, I'm like why the fuck do you need to know my location for

102
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:14,000
me to go like, I'm sorry to anyone that's severely disappointed, I might buy a burner

103
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,640
phone unironically just to fucking use it, right we're gonna go warrior, I like it a

104
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:29,440
bit, what body type bravo is a waman, yeah I'm a waman, wait why is she two-handed, wait

105
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:39,080
her dexterity, her intelligence is ten, wait I want like a warrior beast, do I want a warrior

106
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,800
is a dual wheel dexterity built, didn't that samurai, wait so is that vagabond, strength

107
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:57,840
fourteen, but dexterity's not really high, I just want a tank, vagabond is heavy armour,

108
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,400
I came from that let me hold the ASMR, you're in for a rough ride mate but thank you for

109
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,760
watching I do appreciate it, I do appreciate it, buying a cheap burner phone is it, yeah

110
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:16,600
literally, hero, I want a hero, I can be a hero, oh there we go, I don't want a shield

111
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,400
though, I want dual wheels, we'll change it later type, what is her name, oh is my controller

112
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:32,720
dies already please don't do that, my name is, if I'm a two-handed warrior it sounds

113
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:52,000
like I'm really good at giving, guys I'm a two-handed warrior, fondle abyssum, do you

114
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,760
guys actually want fondle abyssum, fondle these two-handed, yeah we'll do fondle, we'll

115
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,760
make sure you rip and piss, it was a good name, I don't care why I know it's fondle abyssum,

116
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:18,000
right that was a good name, that's what I thought, I have terrible news, whoa, you close

117
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:29,760
it, keeps it, oh that's correct you can get a wee extra cheeky thing, the golden seed

118
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:39,000
enhance sacred flas, imps to do thy bidding, a cracked pot that somehow mends themselves

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,440
a container for thrown items, wait you can have infinite items, what did he say, someone

120
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,960
said get the seed, you would want me to get the seed wouldn't you, I see how you do, I

121
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:00,400
am inclined to believe that gold seed is actually the best thing, five sacred branches charged

122
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:10,880
with the euling power said to originate from the demigod maquela, that's right, not the

123
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,160
seed you brought in girl, wait is it not, see, yeah the golden seed, no see, see, he said

124
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,840
golden seed, right, base template and appearance, are we even bothered about this stuff, what's

125
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,360
that, honestly that's like the color of me, just make the hair black, that's actually me

126
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:39,400
like right now, cause I don't know, let me sip my tea to see if it's cold enough here, okay,

127
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:48,520
oh actually me, a reef lander, a face from a far away isolated land of reefs, wink wink,

128
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,480
I know it says reeds but I'm just gonna say reefs, where blood is a familiar say, reef

129
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,640
flings, I think that's uh, check it out, whoa, we need to make it a bit bigger, we need to make

130
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,040
sure it claps, it was destiny, pale women jump here, how dare you, right, we'll do it, we'll be a

131
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,720
reef lander, it'll literally be for real girl, right, and then detail the appearance, what's my

132
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:30,720
voice, are we really bothered about any of this, some folk are bothered, I'm not really that

133
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,000
bothered, cause literally the first thing we do is slap some armor on us, so yeah, Fondula has

134
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,480
been created even though she's in my image, but look, this goes out to Fondula, you were a fantastic

135
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,520
name choice, I'm sorry I couldn't make it happen, okay, sorry Fondula, couldn't make it happen,

136
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,320
no, before anyone else, yeah, anyone in Gen2 have a funny name like that, no, no, I didn't, oh can you

137
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,280
hear, the fallen leaves tell a story, so crying

138
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
the great Elden Ring was shattered

139
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:27,840
in our home, across the fog, the lands between

140
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:41,920
rise ye tarnished, I still remember that, rise ye tarnished, now queen marica the eternal

141
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
is nowhere to be found

142
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:58,720
and in the night of the black knife, god win the gold, who's first to perish, I just start swinging

143
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:10,400
violently, run, soon marica's offspring, demigods all, Stacey Milken, I thought Stacey Milken was funnier

144
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:18,400
than Fondula bosom to be honest, I mean, I guess it is Fondula bosom, I hardly even know her

145
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,840
the mad taint of their newfound strength, sorry we're dropping the lore, triggered the shattering

146
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,960
oh Keran beat is so good if I had a cs go player, all the names are reserved so, if I get a cs go player

147
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm calling her Keran beat, I already have all the assets

148
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,320
oh maybe I should get a mercy to post a thing about that in the timeline, it's like time traveller

149
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,080
goes back and kicks a rock and then like alternative universe and then I'll show you what Keran's assets

150
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
uh mercy's assets

151
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,160
rise now, you tarnished, rise now, you dead, who yet live

152
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,920
the call of long lost rich speaks to us all

153
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,440
oh why the games insist on white freaking screen

154
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
or a loom, chieftain of the badlands

155
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,680
the ever brilliant gold mask

156
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
fear the deathbed companion

157
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,520
a lonesome dung eater

158
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,520
boom we don't like it

159
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,160
gold mask is literally me, we're autistic, oh this gold mask got the tism

160
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,720

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
follow the call would have been better

163
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,920
if it doesn't present it, no there's no feeling, sorry

164
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,040
if it goes on an attachment they can get it

165
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
I have been breathed to lay

166
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,840
cross the fog to the lands between

167
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:37,840
to stand before the Elden Ring

168
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,000
and become the Elden Lord

169
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280

190
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
yeah game sound is very loud

191

even the ambience, right we're just getting selfs, don't worry, don't worry, we're just getting

192
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,800
master volume but it's too loud so shove it down to a sub, is there anything in particular

193
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,560
that would be good, music is good but S effect's way too high, right put that down by five

194
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,720
I don't know, this is a whack

195
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
this is my voice whilst I'm whacking and doing combat

196
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,680
wow much better, we want to hear more of your voice, okay there we go, we tested it,

did I miss anything, well there is no voice, oh well from the

199
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,080
the people, listen it's just X swing, exactly that's the S effect you're getting, nothing else

200
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,000
because I'm not out to start there, you need to get a multiplayer password as well, yes I cannot

201
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,160
call you in yet until I unlock a site of grace, would anyone like to site of grace, wow look at that

202
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:25,120
the pretty firefly, I know it's not fireflies and it's from that but you will not believe your eyes

203
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:33,520
lit up like a firefly, bit up the world as I fell asleep, what will the password be, probably

204
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,920
Reef, R-E-E-F, if you hold Y and press right bumper you can two hand the axe, why right bumper,

205
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,440

206
00:23:52,160 --> 00:24:05,840
wow, yo, okay let's see, hold on let's unequipped, no sorry wrong thing, let's unequipped my shield

207
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:14,560
for the purpose that I wanted just two hand with the axe, how does one take off a shield, unequipped

208
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,200
well, oh I forgot how this shape works, equipment, equipment, obviously there's equipment and not

209
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,920
anything works, why would you, right I'm un-equipped it and then take the axe, what was it, you can throw

210
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:39,600
punches in this game, oh my god imagine him waltz by a punch, um zero death shield bash run, I think

211
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,800
I bet you there's, I used to watch Elden Ring content and it used to be like one,

212
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,320
one mage versus like three Rannas, like that kind of thing, it was like three Rannas versus like

213
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,120
18 Elden thingies and like you know like I don't know if you've seen those videos, I just used to

214
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,720
watch them and be like huh I'm so entertained right now, it was complete brain rot, Elden Ring brain rot

215
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,360
what was your cheat code, hold y and then press the right bumper

216
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:21,600
oh there we go, I was holding the left bumper, wow, oh my god I'm actually a one-handed, well

217
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,840
two-handed warrior, oh my god right I've almost finished my tea

218
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,120
and then the weathlands, oh I need to get a piece of paper to make sure I make it as fair as possible

219
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:40,000
now before I'm going to start fighting with the accusations in my head, before someone goes

220
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,080
favoritism would you rather a streamer that doesn't interact with you,

221
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,440
does they play video games with you and does they make an effort to have you on stream,

222
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,800
yes or no, no you don't want that, so if I accidentally let someone in when that someone

223
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:09,760
else hasn't even been in, has anyone any fucking accusations, right and I even got a piece of paper

224
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm actually gonna have to go get a piece of paper, do excuse me for a moment little

225
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
everything, I don't have the paper

226
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
well I don't even know

227
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:54,400
so

228
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:06,480
and actually the piece of paper has uh it's actually an old piece of paper that I used to use to track

229
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,400
the girl's scripts, do you want me to leak some content because I'll do it right now

230
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
I'll do it right now

231
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,400
oh there's like I could only leak Azur's apparently I only wrote Azur's on this for some reason

232
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,400
uh oh hell oh I don't need to

233
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,360
okay I gotta live strong anyway she yells please stop shouting I'm getting all hot and bothered

234
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,040
yeah it depends on the leakage I've got a plot theme when

235
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,600
in August Azur has a giant test audio apparently I don't know if I wrote it or not yet

236
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,280
um September she has a reach around for

237
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:02,480

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,800
me first time okay maybe two-handed warriors literally always for me because why was that so easy

309
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,760
okay I should have been two-handed from the start is the game a bit loud

310
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,280
sorry maybe in the fights it gets loud let's let's have a little invest immigration of the

311

audio said that put it is quite loud okay it's now five

312
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,920
this is the talking whilst combat and things are being enabled

313
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,520
strutting wants to hold it two-handed can I I mean I already shrug it my hands and you know

generic length strength oh how do I do gestures again I can't remember is it off on the d-pack no

315
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
it can't be the d-pack that has to be something else

316
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,800
wait I can hold that oh that's how I look I don't have enough for two-handed no refling are you sure

317
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,560
my hands are actually pretty small I'm not gonna win in start menu on the right

318
00:37:45,120 --> 00:38:02,400
oh is this just oh my god oh my god our journey begins all over again it's amazing isn't it

319
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,280

320
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
let me put my headset off of it because I think my headset's quite low actually

321
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,160

325
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,840

335
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,560
oh yes tarnished are we come to the lands between for the Elden Ring

336
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:17,680
hmm of course you have no shame in it unfortunately for you however you are made of

337
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,880
um no I got my reef lens and I'm gonna run a train on them

338
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,960

to die yeah yeah sorry your words mean nothing to me funny man right where's

340
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
can I right we're going to go to the church

341
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,080
uh but we need to avoid the horse guy

342
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,920
because I look all the dead blood as opposed to live blood but I guess blood's only live if it's

343
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,720
inside the user that created the blood no actually that's a lie because you can

344
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,600
you can put blood in other people that's your blood as long as you're all negative or you're

345
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,240
sure the same blood type do you know if you're all negative yeah you have the most valuable

346

blood type and oh wait I forgot wait hold on hold B to run yeah hold B to run yes yes

448
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,600
maiden replays the veteran protecting your queen no I got over zealous I was like in the middle of

453
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,520
but they're aggressive to us so I don't really feel too bad I don't know why they have such a

454
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:28,720
problem with the tarnish like shot color there's no shock color because um for some reason I need

455
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:36,160
to hand over and get a code in order to use the hardware that I bought and I don't really understand

456
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,760
why I would need to do that um so I don't really trust it I am going to try and get a burner phone I

457
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:54,480
think uh just to be able to shock myself or I'll look into another caller because yeah I don't know

458
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,920
why a company needs my actual phone number just so I can shock myself in an app like I don't know

459
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,760
I don't know if you guys know whoa what was that oh I saw you charge that up

460
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,120

461
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,160
burner phone seems smart yeah please insert your social security number to literally it feels like

500
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,080
mechanic adding skills with a waystone knife you can use ashes of war that grants a new skill

501
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:38,080
add affinity with the knife you can use ashes of war to grant affinity to your

502
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:47,600
armor this way you can alter interest curious I'm not smart enough to understand half of the

503
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:53,360
things going on but it doesn't matter because I get to play with the replay and we get to experience

504
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,440
when you see her she'd be so in a brothel sorry I said that greetings

have you heard of the finger maidens

509
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:59,680
they serve the two fingers offering guidance and aid to the tarnished

510
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:09,840
hmm but you I am afraid are maidenless no I've got my weapons they're literally all around you

511
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:20,320
women look behind you turning rooms into strength to aid you in your search for the elton ring

512
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:29,200

513
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:39,840
I accept then it settled summon me by grace to turn rooms into strength

514
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:49,360
ah another matter yes madam I bequeath to use this ring yes

515
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,360
I

516
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:02,640
use it to traverse great distances it will summon a spectral steed named torrent

517
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,160
torrent has chosen you

518
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:16,240
treat him with respect yeah I see as I accidentally fall off glass all the time so now I turn my

519
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,720
rooms to strength oh my god we're gonna touch

520
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:24,960
my hand rest upon I got my feet and everything for this for a better moment share them with me

521
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:32,400
okay your thoughts your ambitions so what happens if I do strength the principles you would follow

522
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,160
strength is just straight up attack and that

523
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,040
so what I want to put it in strength we bit of vinegar

524
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,400
and a wee bit of day that's pretty little with arcane that's magic

525
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:58,800
faith is low endurance and I need 10 dexterity if I want to upgrade the weapon okay I can do that

526
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:04,640
I mean I can do quite a lot considering how much runes the refunds gave me you need 10

527
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:05,860
and

528
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,720
fit it all into strength I don't mind getting my xp bar a bit bigger the reason for higher xp

529
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:21,040
so I don't fuck it up and then keep de-sinking and then we have to keep calling in more refunds for

530
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:30,080
more reinforcement and bigger bigger yeah strength and dexterity are both attacked just on different

531
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:35,680
weapons okay so I'm strength because of the way I'm handling that yeah okay yes please

532
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:44,720

536
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:10,880

548
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:38,160

is that she means cat yeah she's cat do you think vulgar perhaps where I come from

715
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,120
it is a secret you can have friends like this in Elden Ring where you guys carry me through the game

716
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,880
that'll let her hold me that I get much of a debuff if she hugs me

717
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,120
I think the debuff goes away if I perish right

718
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:47,440
uh I can't remember yeah hug her okay hello my thanks great she quite literally steals life force

of brick and mortar that's what I like to see right

828
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:17,280
playing the game for the first time right now it is kicking my ass any reef leaves to carry me to

829
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:23,520
sad face oh thank you for the tip boy um I'm actually sure there'll probably be reeflings that

830
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,920
are willing to help you out I think wait no I've already been here no I need to climb up the ladder

831
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,560
again oops I was supposed to go left not right I'm sure reeflings will help you

832
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,160
just make sure you make sure your coat is reefed

833
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:49,520
quite possible sun suppression did it stop I'll check again where I did it but you that was

834
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:58,560
scary don't do that again you might myself clear that was scary and I like 100% sure it was audible

835
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,720
but we maybe because like my room creeps all this oh that's an enemy that no one heard it or just tell

01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,680
he's always make a reefling multiplayer quick yeah yeah yeah we have reef reef is it r e e f reef

837
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:21,360
like me uh no there's nothing on the edge because I've explored the edge before I think there's a

838
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:32,000
knight in arm my thought you were an enemy reefling you have to be careful I knew there was this bad

839
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:40,880
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa ouch he's beating my ass I need to hit him there we go get

840
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:48,640
staggered uh is there anything down here nope just imminent death let's not uh fight gravity today

841
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,480
multiplayer passcode is weak yes that is the pinned message for anyone who is lurking and you're

842
01:43:54,480 --> 01:44:02,640
like huh whatever however we stream sniping this game um the password is reef and in multiplayer

843
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:08,720
um and oh there's a bow and arrow man how'd I get across

844
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:11,360
this

845
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,440
I don't know I actually don't trust that how'd I get close

846
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,960
this I mean if someone put down a marker there

847
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,200
one more ow kick me

848
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:36,640
and there's your chance of your big show yes if you're lurking and you don't understand how Elden

849
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:44,880
Ring is technically a stream sniping game we have a multiplayer passcode here um that's not at all

850
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:52,400
yeah it is top right the it's reef and fill capital letters and every sign or mark of grace

851
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:58,240
you're pointing go down you want me to go down oh reefling's showing you something

what are you showing me oh mark of grace yes this is how uh you can stream snake mean by

854
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:15,600
mark of grace but the problem is oh you give me tons of flowers so I can make more the only

855
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,880
problem is I can only have two good reeflings at a time and then one naughty reefling at a time

856
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,560
but that naughty reefling means that we don't ever get in trouble wait that I despawn

857
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:33,440
hey how can I get uh did other reefling perish

858

Oh, we all need to get on this

01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,360
Let's go

01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:12,480
Oh, sorry. I need to activate it. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't realize you couldn't

937
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,360
That's not nice

938
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,360
Oh, I see in school berries. How was your rave session?

939
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,040
You guys have a little rave together wait

940
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,920
I know this place. We've been here before do we go up the stairs now?

941
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:35,680
Where's purple refling? He's already going high snow berries. Did you enjoy getting steam in what I see?

942
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:41,840
I see nobody read. Hopefully I see gets enough hydration. I don't know. I guess like we go up here

943
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,280
Hello

944
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:52,080
Welcome on and I'm currently doing a stream sniping game which is elden ring. Oh surprise surprise

945
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,760
um

946
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:59,920
The reflings have already overpowered me an astronomical amount. We're just exploring the first castle

947
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,720
Unfortunately, I'm a bit all turned around and not sure where to go. But you know what?

948
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,640
It's about the exploring we made along the way. Wait, is this a dead end?

949
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:14,880
Have I just taken us to a dead end? That would be very thin, but I'm glad the snowberries enjoyed your rave. Oh, yeah

950
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,080
Steaman is one way to put it. Is she blackout?

951
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,640
Does that need a message her?

952
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,040
Does that need a message her?

953
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,680
Hmm, you're making me nervous. Does that need a message?

954
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:35,680
Yes or no? Hi radius welcome. We're running a train on this castle. I'm to jump, but this is so dangerous

955
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:43,280
Oh, no, I'm not a fan of heights, but I'll do it for you refling. Oh, no, she is okay. No, she's fine. Okay. Okay. I won't message her

956
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:55,200
Okay. Okay. Follow the purple. Follow the purple. Easy. Easy. Follow the purple. Gentle. Gentle. Gently. Gently. Follow the purple

957
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,440
Refling, no

958
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,320
Refling, no

959
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:11,520
We've lost our first refling. This cannot be. Wait, do I have an emotional gesture?

960
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,480
To say goodbye to

961
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,600
I'm so sorry. No, no, not like that

962
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:25,920
We lost our first refling to gravity rip rip refling. Okay. We'll we'll we'll keep going. We'll push onwards

963
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,800
I don't clap at him. That's not nice

964
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:36,720
Fill the dexterity check. Oh, right. We'll follow and we'll get to the next location

965
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,680
What? What? I'll I'll be in the corner so you can go ahead purple refling

966
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
What?

967
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,840
A

968
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,840
What we're currently

969
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,560
Are you squinting me right now? No, there's no shock. How's the shock collar being used?

970
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,800
So we flying

971
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,280
No shock collar

972
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,880
because

973
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,840
Something very strange. What? How did you do that?

974
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,800
I need to get good at the game with you guys, honestly

975
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:11,760
The shock collar is requiring me to give me its phone number to use the software and

976
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,920
I'm going to have to buy a burner phone to get it operational

977
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:22,240
Um, or I'm actually probably just going to buy a new brand of shock collar because there is actually no reason why

978
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:29,760
I should have to give personal information to click that on a freaking button of our shock collar

979
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:32,240
Um, are these birds aggressive?

980
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,960
No

981
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,560
Uh

982
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,560
Are we going the wrong way?

983
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:43,040
Honestly. Oh wait. Oh wait. Pick up the thing. Pick up the thing. Sorry. There's a thing there that you pick up

984
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:48,080
That's like, but thank you bro. The legend a claw talisman

985
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,200
How do I click talisman?

986
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,920
Oh

987
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,520
Wait, no, it's an equipment

988
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,040
Uh

989
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:06,160
Enhances jump attacks. Okay. That's pretty perfect considering all I do is go. Oh, yeah every time I get an enemy. I mean

990
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:09,200
Give it all her info

991
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:11,520
Yeah

992
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:16,080
What is the password for it's how you stream snipe me and elden ring

993
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:19,920
So I can have two good reeflings and one bad reefling at a time

994
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,200
Okay

995
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,880
But you need to put down your mark at a certain location

996
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:30,960
So unfortunately, you do have to have already played the game. That is a big jump big jump

997
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,560
Uh, thankfully it goes to stamina damage. Um

998
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,160
I

999
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:40,160
Top down here. Okay

1000
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,920
Uh

1001
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,320
Oh wow

1002
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,080
Wow, we are getting deep in these catacombs

1003
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:59,360
Oh, we need to do this one. Okay. Well, I did buy uh like four stone dying level 75 already

1004
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:06,560
I may or may not have been gifted just a little tiny just a wee amount of runes just to get started. Okay

1005
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,560
Like it's um

1006
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,840
What?

1007
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,280
It was just to get me started, you know, like I didn't really oh

1008
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,720
I actually dodged that. Okay, but I didn't well

1009
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,160
I mean that worked out fantastically all things considered and it was I just needed a wee bit, you know

1010
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,720
And the refunds were very kind and gave me some some very happy to see

1011
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:33,600
Whoa, is the enemy right right there? I don't want to get pushed off the map

1012
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,200
Okay, follow purple reefling

1013
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:41,040
Are we is there something out there or is it just that guy that stands on the shelf?

1014
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,760
I'm looking nothing. Okay. Just checking just checking

1015
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:53,200
A small it was just a small loon of a million runes. Okay for a level one player. It was a small

1016
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:58,080
Small runes. Oh, we did like a big basic get back to the bus. Okay

1017
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,120
at the

1018
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,600
And maybe we can get a new wishlist

1019
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,440
Something's going on back there. I don't know what

1020
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,800
Uh, this is like an entire battlefield

1021
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:17,920
Oh, no, I ain't good like that. Oh, I'm not good at this game like that

1022
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:23,200
I'm not good at this game like that. Okay. Okay. Hold on. I actually gonna have to use my brain

1023
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,600
We're gonna keep doing jump attacks. Okay

1024
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,400
I need to restore my stamina bar. That's fine

1025
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,360
You're next. Goodbye

1026
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,080

I was healing stop it. I was healing. Wait. I just whacked that freaking pillar. Stop it. I'm healing

1029
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:53,600

1030
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,920
I don't know. I need I can't tell yet. Whoa. That's the baddie

1031
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,200
Oh my god

1032
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:07,360
The game I would not have gotten very far with that. I have one more class

1033
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:14,000
Be careful about a cheeky HP, but it's okay. It's okay

1034
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:19,920
Protect refill and mummy. Oh, there's a portrait. Hello

1035
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:28,560
The prophecy painting. Oh, I do love a good prophecy. I have been that prophecy V tripper. I do love a good

1036
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,400
Uh, I would 100% entertain a prophecy V tripper

1037
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:41,200
Don't care. I love it. It's good. I love prophecies. I find them absolutely fascinating when did you guys see June?

1038
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,680
Wait, is there gonna be a reference here if I touch this?

1039
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,280
Is there any reference here?

1040
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:53,520
I was gonna see I'm wondering. I think you guys might be at the next grace site. Okay. We'll do the next grace site

1041
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:58,960
I see your future. I predict you will in three two one

1042
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:05,840
Are you spewing on me? What is why does it not hurt me?

1043
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,080
It puts me asleep

1044
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,960
Sleep wait, but sleep didn't even put me asleep. It just like did explain

1045
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:23,440
Uh, I'm gonna have to sit down because I need to replenish all my class

1046
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:29,920
V tripper that's really into divination. Yes. I'm definitely open for that. That's stuff like

1047
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,920
Right level up wait

1048
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,840
Wait, did I crack all those rooms?

1049
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:48,240
I uh, I did not crack all those rooms. This is gonna be ridiculous. I did not crack

1050
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,360
Are we ready?

1051
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:58,160
You can't get banned for this stuff. It's not that kind of game where they're like, we're gonna ban you, right? Surely not

1052
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:10,640
Surely it's not that kind of game that gets you banned for this silly stuff. Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh, no

1053
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,280
A million a million of pop

1054
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,880
No, we're gonna be so

1055
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,240
But it's perfect because that's exactly what I want

1056
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:32,640
Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, no, sorry. I didn't mean to use a singular one

1057
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:36,320
I don't think it's gonna make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. All right, let's try that again

1058
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,040
Use an event

1059
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,840
Forms so severely deals with hackers in their full game

1060
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,920
Hmm

1061
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:53,200
I guess if you're really into like the multiplayer aspect of like, uh, 1v1 in someone I can see how it might be annoying

1062
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,920
Are we about to hit 10 million?

1063
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,280
I think we are

1064
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:07,680
Wait, is that 11 million? Hold on, let me do the

1065
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,280
Wait, am I being Papaga?

1066
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:17,440
Uh 11? Oh my god, 11 million runs on our person

1067
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,040
Bruh

1068
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,680
Bruh

1069
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,760
Oh my god, that's like that's insane

1070
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,680
That is insane. Thank you so much

1071
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,720
Um, yeah, I think we can go up a few more levels

1072
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:47,520
Right, so what did someone say 60 vigor and then strength and then what a few in dexterity, maybe

1073
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:56,240
Endurance, I wouldn't mind because I like swinging my sword. This is fucking ridiculous. We're still going

1074
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,960
80 strength

1075
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:04,880
Oh, we can get 82 strength 40 endurance get that 60

1076
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:09,040
Endurance faith and mind

1077
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:13,760
Faith isn't too handed. Am I mistaken?

1078
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,200
Are you trolling did I read it trolling?

1079
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,160
And the rest on whatever you plan on the put all the points into faith. I'm lying. Please don't do this

1080
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:27,360
Okay, one hit Malena. Hopefully I I think we're gonna one hit her but if strength is

1081
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,120
Right stamina is gonna go up quite a bit, which is good because I'm kind of like oh my god. Wait

1082
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,840
I

1083
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,640
How much can I it keeps going?

1084
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:50,320
It keeps going we can max out

1085
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:59,600
40 endurance is a soft cat, okay, so just do that

1086
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,160
A

1087
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,480
More endurance

1088
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,720
Don't get 40 on that

1089
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:12,080
Vigor soft calf is 60. Is it?

1090
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:20,080
80 is a hard cut for things. This is the highest level. I've seen someone have

1091
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:23,200
Brov literally now didn't even earn any of it

1092
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:31,360
You have 15 million you can max out everything. Okay, I giggled it. Yeah soft cat on 60

1093
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,440
Okay

1094
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:38,480
So we'll do that and then what put in endurance. Oh, no, you said endurance is also got soft cat when I'm like, sorry

1095
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,520
someone said um

1096
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,640
60 and 80 strength

1097
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,880
So there's not really I have 106 hours on my character in your higher level than it already

1098
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:53,920
What can I say the reeflings love support in me?

1099
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,960
Ryan

1100
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,600
You are now a higher level than I am. I've been playing for 130 hours

1101
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:05,920
Get rekt origan. Thank you for the five get rekt

1102
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:11,360
So when you say soft cap, do you just mean like it hardly improves anything?

1103
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,800
basically

1104
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,640
I seen that's what you mean. She already beat the game

1105
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,680
Okay, so it hardly improves it

1106
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:28,640
They didn't change anything. Oh, this changes my max equipment load though. I kind of want that because I'm doing heavy rule

1107
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,360
Okay

1108
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:34,720
Well, why do you have a thing on it? Why does it have a ring around it?

1109
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,480
What

1110
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:42,560
Is that a president of the united states in my video game right now?

1111
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,640
And you come mr. Richard

1112
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:50,160
Nixon the president of the united states

1113
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:52,560
um

1114
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,560
I do

1115
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:01,120
I was absolutely mortified. I thought that said something else there. Oh my god. I need my glasses on now

1116
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:05,200
Let's not do that. Oh have a red. I need a red

1117
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:08,080
just a fella and

1118
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,520
And

1119
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,560
Who came in first? Oh shit everything's out of order

1120
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:17,600
Right you came you came

1121
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,440
Why are you naked mr. President?

1122
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,360
Oh my god, can you actually fight

1123
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:30,240
Are you doing is it don't dog Zori or something? I can't remember the name

1124
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:35,120
My beloved all we need to get the coconuts so we can talk to each other

1125
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:40,320
That's basically have diminishing returns to hire the stat the fewer benefits for more of the stats

1126
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,440
Get them into rent to six there 80

1127
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:51,040
Dogeza, dogeza, dogeza. I'm trying to imagine how you say it dogeza

1128
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,840

Why is my pc screaming?

1132
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:15,840
Okay, I'm still streaming okay

1133
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,040
Oh no

1134
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:26,720
My my pc couldn't handle the ink of the uh reeflings injecting into my bloodstream

1135
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:35,040
We still here and see you girl you just got banned stop imagine if I was the first freaking runescape player to get banned

1136
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:39,440
For like mass levelling up and form soft is like you're not allowed on our game anymore

1137
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,480
Could you imagine?

1138
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:45,120
Could you imagine?

1139
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:51,600
That would be ridiculous runescape player

1140
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,240
You're still streaming wait runescape

1141
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,840
Wait, what did I say? Wait, what did I say? Did I say jagged?

1142
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:09,600
Yeah, I hope I didn't ruin that wrong game you said runescape. Oh, sorry

1143
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,880
Elden ring. I don't know what I think. I don't know what I said

1144
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,840
Sorry

1145
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:20,880
Maybe I need to get a cup of tea what how long it's already been two hours. It feels like an hour

1146
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,880
Okay, wait, sorry

1147
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:27,600
I need to scrub out everyone's name that I just wrote down there because you didn't actually get a chance to play

1148
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:31,200
So I'm taking your names out of the paper. Okay

1149
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,360
And then I'm starting a new list at the side, but because

1150
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:40,480
Right

1151
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:47,280
Right, I'll summon. Okay, actually that's kind of lucky that you're there. I'll see if I can find president

1152
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,400
Uh

1153
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,960
Oh

1154
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,960
You can roleplay as Milena

1155
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,960
Oh

1156
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,960
I unfortunately can't find president nixon

1157
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,760
Uh, I've got yeesh

1158
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:11,920
And then see if we can get Milena. I don't know why my piece my game crashed

1159
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:22,480
My beloved I'm gonna get everyone in and then I'm gonna very well at least you didn't get banned. Are your stats still good? Oh

1160
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:30,160
Uh considering how long my hp bar is on my stamina. I think I'm actually gonna do a bit. Um

1161
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,440
Wait, why can't I see other refunds?

1162
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,560
I've only got one refund right now

1163
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,160
Sorry one good refund pardon my friend

1164
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:52,480
Is the game trying to connect why can't why can't I only summon one refund?

1165
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,400
Huh what's going on here

1166
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:06,080
Need to redo it again summoning the bad refling ends effect. Oh, I comprehend. Are you kneel before me?

1167
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,200
Uh, you

02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,720

02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,720
Hey, what was that a

1172
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,960
you have such a

1173
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:30,400
Funny and long name, right? I'm gonna very quickly make a copy see I will literally be like four minutes

1174
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,960
The reason I always say four minutes four minutes one

1175
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,640
The kettle takes forever to boil

1176
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:42,800
It takes forever. Okay, please everyone. I highly recommend get up. Have a little stretch

1177
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:48,080
Get yourself some snacks and some juice if you like if you do need to go to sleep

1178
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:53,440
Please don't worry. I will be here when you wake up unironically. This is an endurance stream

1179
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:57,120
You know damn it's not connecting. Oh no

1180
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,880
I'm wondering if something's bugging out fire grief

1181
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:07,440
You try and grease me up be honest. You try and grease me up. Huh? You try and grease me up in 4k in 4k

1182
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,200
I held up strong. He cut open 4k. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah

1183
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,840
Okay, I think this area is a bit funky

1184
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:20,560
You're the only one that shows off as well

1185
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:27,040
That's so strange. I think this that's wait. I'm getting a I'm getting a vision

1186
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:32,720
I am like 99% sure I've had issues with this summoning area before in another life

1187
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:39,760
I'm going to very quickly make a cup of tea. Please do get up. Get a wee thingy. Um, is this an endurance stream? No, it's just eight hours

1188
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,280
Let's be honest here. We already know it's not gonna be eight hours

1189
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,720
Right, I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea. I'll be right back. Okay. Please get a snack

I

1197
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,040
I

1198
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,040
I

1199
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,040
I

1200
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,040
I

1201
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:59,040
I

1202
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,040
I

1203
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:31,040
I

1204
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,040
I

1205
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:54,240
The music no, it's crazy

1206
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:58,000
Um, right, you couldn't make it

1207

Two zeros in a row. Why would that be?

1212
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:26,160
Why would that be blanked out? That's so confusing

1213
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Sometimes

1214
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:35,600

02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,440

1246
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:08,160
Like genuinely don't know how you do it like

1247
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,760
Like how the fuck do you do that? I am in the moment. I do not have time to be like

1248
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:21,680
Oh, right. This button is how I activate the the question mark thingy. Like I don't know how to do it

1249
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,200
Pain a smiley on the hotkeys for the toggle

1250
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:32,720
No, I have oh, I don't have to smell it have the names like this is called love because it makes my heart's love heart

1251
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:35,040
Makes my heart's makes me

1252
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:37,200
Unlike I've got

1253
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:40,720
You said what

02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,920
Yeah

1258
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I'm such a fake

1259
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:02,400
Actually, you can't call me a fake vtuber. How much have you fucking spent on the vtuber community?

1260
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:04,400
I will not tolerate any slander such as this

1261
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,000
Actually, that's where I draw the line at the slander. You can call me a bad vtuber

1262
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,520
But you can't call me a fake one uh with the amount of money I'm fucking putting to the

1263
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,880
I'm down for it

1264
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:23,120
Toggles are useless because uh, we know what face mummy is making already. Well, just teasing

1265
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:26,240
I'm just teasing through this entire stream

1266
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:33,120
But yes, uh, my daughter should be going live soon tm question mark. I don't know what's happening, but

1267
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,400
I can't even figure it out, but please do watch them. I'm doing endurance. I'm going to be here all week

1268
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:44,480
Okay, we are stuck on this game for the next few days and when I say stuck

1269
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:47,680
I mean you're stuck in the wall and I've just come across your stuff

1270
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,800
Yeah, I'll make myself clear

1271
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:58,160
You thought some people do have like so I can like

1272
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:04,720
Puff my cheeks automatically like I'm puffing my cheek. I'm sick of my tongue. That's automatic

1273
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:08,640
I can also go angry. That's automatic. I can also go sad

1274
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,920
All right, open my like this is all automatic

1275
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:17,840
Anything beyond that is what is called a face toggle. This is a toggle

1276
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:21,280
This isn't going to come on if I like look a certain way in the tracker, you know

1277
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,520
um

1278
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,080
Like again with a blush. This isn't going to come on so

1279
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:33,040
That would you be playing shadow of urchie? Is that the name of the dlc? Because if so, yes, we are playing the game

1280
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:36,560
The base game

1281
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:43,920
But well, I say we play and you guys are carrying me through the base game so we can do the dlc part

1282
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:48,480
But yes, okay, we're playing switch ways at that door

1283
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:51,440
It may be this door

1284
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,160
Oh, look it isn't this door

1285
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:56,880
Don't be filled with flings

1286
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:59,760
Oh, we got sonic the hedgehog up in here

1287
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:04,320
Do you guys actually see the sonic the hedgehog movie? I didn't

1288
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,320
Don't tell it. Don't tell Amy from my yumi plus that I didn't see the sonic

1289
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:11,920

1291
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:22,000
I thought you know, I thought I was like pretty deep in it doing the like sonic heroes

1292
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:28,000
I don't know what we're doing. I'm just following you guys. Sorry. I'm going on a ramble. You guys are gonna have to actually

1293
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:36,800
I'm getting distracted like oh, that's an enemy. I thought that was the reason

1294
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:42,080
Okay, it turns out you can't actually break the big killer things were oh

1295
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:46,480
I need to stop doing that. Okay. You're glowing blue. I need to remember

1296
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:51,280
Glowing blue. He's a friend to you. Oh, you're a fine warrior

1297
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,080
Oh, you're a warrior too

1298
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,640
Me I'm a warrior

1299
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:01,280
Even though I I get

1300
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:07,040
I get reeflings to kill everything. Is the dlc any good? I don't know. Oh, no, sorry. You said the dlc is good stuff

1301
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:12,720
How utterly repellent this is I think the girl who haven't served her she was giving the shunt tails

1302
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:16,480
They're gonna play you know, I think they're swapping because there's issues with Ubisoft

1303
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,520
Wait, was that supposed to do something? Sorry? I don't know

She gives you a charm too. Did I need to come back after I've done a godric

02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,520

1353
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:47,840

1354
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:52,240
Oh, does he if I stand on the scorch maybe

1355
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:58,480
Leave him alone

1356
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:06,560

1357
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:13,200

02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:28,320
For the ghost fight. Wait, you guys don't disappear

1362
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,080

I was like, wait many guys done the great rune by

1364
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:41,840
The great runes you receive by the by defeating shard bearers have lost their

1365
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:48,720
Beneficial power however their power can be restored at divine towers through the lands between sea

1366
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:52,400
Oh, that's if you want to learn more spells and stuff. I think

1367
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:55,760
Is this another one where I can't see you guys here?

1368
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:00,800
Go to the round table and collect your rewards

1369
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,160
Can't level up yet. Okay round table

1370
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:10,480
Then I'll do it from there. Yes. No, okay round table. Wait. So I don't go back and talk to her

1371
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:16,560
Is she not going to be there anymore? Is she going to be at the round table? Oh

1372
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:24,160
Well, I'm gonna go to the round table. I didn't realize you guys even cleared that out for me. You guys did so much work

1373
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:28,720
I didn't even realize you clean cleared that out for me. Uh lady

1374
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:34,960
Warrior lady. Oh getting in. Hello. Oh, this is a rare occasion. Hi

1375
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:40,240
I can't remember the last time a new tarnished made their way to the round table. Yeah

1376
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:43,360
I'm new here as your senior

1377
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:48,720
Oh, no, we ain't doing that. Cool. Hi shit. No, we're on the same level. Sorry

1378
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:55,600
I believe in communicating as peers and nothing more. Please don't don't give me that shit. Allow me a word of advice

1379
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:00,560
As your senior you are a mere visitor to the round table

1380
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:08,480
Okay, this is why we do peer and peer talking not like adult on child or like this like you're older than me

1381
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:10,480
I must respect your type. No

1382
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:13,120
Don't ever speak to me again

1383
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:15,360
Uh, oh, we can see the fingers

1384
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,080
Hello

1385
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,800
The 43 levels from the logic

1386
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:37,520
We're so doing that first. What's Johnny's current level? It's like what? Only four more levels?

1387
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:42,960
Look there the fingers

1388
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:52,480
To welcome you shard bear let their wisdom wash over you

1389
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,600
Great Elden Ring

1390
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:58,800
Root of the golden order

1391
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:01,360
Anchor of all lands

1392
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,600
Giver of grace

1393
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:06,560
Wellspring of all joy

1394
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:09,360
Until it was shattered

1395
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:14,000
The tragic corruption of the order has taken its toll

1396
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,880
Across the realm

1397
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,880
Life lies in ruin

1398
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,680
Fallen two pieces

1399
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,560
foul curses

1400
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,720
And misery spread

1401
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:29,600
Unabating just so thank you

1402
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:32,560
What about this

1403
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,800
The tentacles trembles Johnny

1404
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,840
Wait my mouse was closed it again

1405
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:50,080
Oh

1406
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:56,480
Wait does the DLC get affected if you do the madness route or does the DLC kind of just override whatever choice?

1407
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:58,480
Of its kind

1408
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:06,320
Is DLC new game plus? Okay. That's my question. Is the DLC new game plus or are you supposed to do it alongside the main quest?

1409
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,880
DLC is separate entirely

1410
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,480
This is one thing curious. Hello

1411
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:20,720

No way they gave the fingers a seat no one feel well. This is what the damn thing size is

Did you know they have a bank called central bank of texas my soul left my body when I abbreviated that

1417
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:53,520
Wait, what's wrong with the little you don't want central bank of texas texas?

1418
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:59,040
You don't want me a central bank of texas here. Just a little bit. I won't make it hurt too much

1419

1421
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:11,600
Does anyone interested in some central bank of texas?

1422
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:14,480

The warrior lady. Where the heck is the warrior lady? You're not the warrior lady

It's not new game plus. Okay, where's the warrior lady? I cannot for the life of me remember that's fia's bedroom

1425
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:32,560
Towards the merchant. Okay merchant merchant. I do know where the merchant is

1426
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,960
Is she the quiet one that never spoke to me? No

1427
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:44,240
Do you really not talk at all? Wow you you really don't okay curious. Um

1428
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:48,400

1458
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:10,080
I'll very slowly walk out. Don't want to destroy any more of the uh perpetual stir. That's right. It's like a thing that keeps on going

1469
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:07,760
I think a lot of stuff got scrapped for ironwork for the world war. So lost a lot of history to that stuff

02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,880
Why is there blood?

1515
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:52,480

1516
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:57,120
Okay, but why was there blood back there?

1517
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:00,720

1518
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:07,440
Why is there blood did someone just perish there for the fun of it? I should buy a grape

1519
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:13,360
Maiden dear maiden, where are you? Please take my grapes

1520
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:17,360

1523
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,600
Uh, okay next grace day

1524
02:47:30,880 --> 02:47:36,240

Oh, it's just a few reflins waiting on me over here just a few

1527
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:52,800
May chaos take the world. No, I wouldn't do madness, right? I'll get no TV fling in first because I don't want to get attacked

1528
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:54,960
I hate getting attacked

1529
02:47:55,120 --> 02:47:57,120
Um, did you disconnect?

1533
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:14,240
I've not had you in before

1534
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:18,800
I don't know what that meant. What did your name mean?

1535
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,440

No, no

1542
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:50,480
I wonder

1543
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,440

Oh, there's a church down here. I wait. Can we even reach that? We can't

1550
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,880
Normally, there's something good at the churches that are pretty OP

1551
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:37,680
I think we discover the church and then we'll follow the grace site. It's telling us to go along that bridge there

1552
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:41,440
Ooh, we have a purple bear

1553
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000

Wow, I have an offering land octopus

1559

I don't need to believe in magic

1569
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:48,720
If uh, if my two-handed sword has anything to say about it, I don't think I need to learn magic

1570
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:51,680
Um

1571
02:50:52,480 --> 02:50:54,480
Is this the wrong way?

1572
02:50:58,160 --> 02:51:01,680
Well, I follow the reeflings. I trust them with my heart. So

1573
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,320

Unplayable

1585
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:01,280
Careful of the reefling. I don't want to whack you with my meaty swag

1586

Oh my tea. Sorry. I forgot I had a cup of tea. Okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna walk around a little bit

1588
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:14,640
Sorry if the camera's a bit funny

1589
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:19,920
It's already getting cold

1590
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:26,480
Well, I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying. I'm so sorry. I don't have the fucking accuracy

1595
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:55,280
He's making himself calamari

1596
02:52:56,720 --> 02:53:00,240
He's thought that reefling. No, there's two calamari now

Oh, wait. No, I do want this. I want that for when we go into scary places

1602
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:23,040
Hmm

1603
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:26,960
Okay, if I press start and then I press this one

1609
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:55,600
Okay

1610
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:56,720
I'm almost finished

1611
02:53:56,720 --> 02:54:02,240
Do you guys want to like go ahead a little bit just to get a feel for the enemies because I'm still trying to drink my tea

1612
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:04,800
Oh

1613
02:54:06,480 --> 02:54:10,080
My god, I'm like, oh, it's like so hard to turn the camera and move

1614
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:14,800
I need to like make sure I'm behind the steps of the reefling though. So I don't get work

1615
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:18,000
Oh, that was a tiny bird. That was an eight out of ten

1616
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:22,560
That's not eight out of ten. That's like a four. That was a little a little

1617
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:27,600
Okay, okay, the reeflings are protected. I can do this

1618
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:36,640
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm following the reeflings with one hand. This is getting a bit tricky now

1619
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:40,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1620
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:49,760

Oh my god, my game just froze there. Did you see that it literally just was

1623
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:09,120
I literally when things have too many bills. I cannot do it

1624
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,920

Lie or Nia. Okay, that makes more sense. Sorry. I have to break everything down or else it doesn't work

1627
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:21,760

02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:35,840
I'm ready for a fight

1631
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:39,600
Whoa, what did these do here? I don't like

1632
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:46,320
Whoa, help that reefling help that reefling right now. Oh, whoa

1633
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,400
Oh

1634
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:53,520
That reefling didn't need any help at all actually in fact if anything I'm the one that needs help

1635
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:58,320
Why he's late now for fireworks?

1636
02:55:59,440 --> 02:56:01,440
Baby

1637
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:07,120
Lie, you're Nia. Lie, you're Nia. Lie, you're Nia

1638
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:09,840
Yeah

1639
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:14,160
Making the reefling sell the dirty work. Well, the princess sits her tea honestly

1640
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:18,160
Shocking because he's like, wait, is that reefling fine? Yeah, that's reefling fine

1641
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:25,760
We're going on an adventure adventure adventure

1642
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:31,920
We're going on an adventure and the place of the map I can't pronounce

1643
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:35,920
So we're just gonna call it the lake but jeez you're so fast

1644
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:39,120
We're following the lake

1645
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:48,240
I got uh

1646
02:56:48,800 --> 02:56:52,800
Flowers and I got uh smithing thingy my boba

1647
02:56:54,400 --> 02:57:01,920
I like her friendly fires and on for friendly reeflings because I would be in a world of trouble swinging this sword around if you guys were getting physical

1648
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:04,560
Uh

1649
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:07,520
I don't know where we go

1650
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:19,440
Is there an enemy we're getting a bit too open world here

1651
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:26,640
I think there's some sort of boss battle in the water. Is it a boat? Is it the boat guy a mariner?

1652
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:34,240
Hmm my memory is failing me. Okay. This looks like a boss fight. Whatever this is. Okay, maybe not

1653
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:37,440
Maybe it's just the render distance

1654
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:45,840
So do you actually do the emboss in the dlc? Yeah, we've not played the dlc. I've never played it before I only came out two days ago

1655
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:48,640
Or are they?

1656
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:50,640
Whoa, I hear noises. Wow

1657
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:52,880
It's a baboon

1658
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:56,640
Cheeky thing. What do you drop? Do you drop string?

1659
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
What?

1660
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:02,080
Here for replay

1661
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,440
Where are they coming from? They're coming out nowhere

1662
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:12,560
Oh my god, I love how long my sword is as well because it means I can actually hit things with it. What?

1663
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:17,040
Dragonfly. Oh no, not dragonfly. I'm mad at myself

1664
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:21,600
What do we do? I'm gonna follow you. Okay. Let's say we're all agree we're going this way

1665
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:27,040
What? Is it beating me up? I'm so confused. Is this thing trying to suck me off or something?

1666
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:32,320
I don't know. It keeps flapping about my head. I can't get it

1667
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,560
I'm gonna beat this shit with that mosquito. Did you get it?

1668
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:40,240
No, it's being us

1669
02:58:41,360 --> 02:58:47,200
We can't kill a mosquito. Okay. We did it. Okay. Let's god that thing is massive. That's a big

1670
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:54,320
Yeah, are you celebrating? Oh, I see it. I see it. Oh, it's gone

1671
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:59,040
I thought that was the boss. Can he be the boss?

1672
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:04,720
Oh, I missed. You didn't see that. You didn't see that. I missed just a little bit. Okay

1673
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:10,240
Oh, I got more of my ovaries back. Yeah, give me my ovaries back. Give me the book

1674
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,680
I need them

1675
02:59:14,240 --> 02:59:16,240
I need them for when uh

1676
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:19,200
Gentle

1677
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:27,120
Wow, okay, we're going up here. Oh, there's a great site and there's also a crystal bug

1678
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
I love collecting all the flowers in this game

1679
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,880
Little mushrooms and all that. It's so cute

1680
02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:38,160
Uh, right um

1681
02:59:38,960 --> 02:59:40,960
Where are we to go?

1682
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:43,040
Look how freaking fast

1683
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
It's so big

1684
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:51,520
Okay, I follow the reeflings. Where are they?

1685
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:57,760
Oh my god, they're gone. Oh, right. They're there. I was like, uh, did I just despawn them? Uh, uh reeflings help help help

1686
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:01,440
Okay

1687
03:00:03,760 --> 03:00:05,760
I've heard the mosquito

1688
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:10,880
It's like, hmm, doesn't that seem a little overpowered just for that? Okay

1689
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:15,680
Anything

1690
03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:19,920
Right, let's get ready to rumble

1691
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:22,960
Ladies and gentlemen

1692
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:30,160
Aren't my feet getting cold in the water the lake? I feel like that'd be a bit chilly. Oh, there's a shack here. There's a house

1693
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:35,840
Reeflings, it's the farm. Oh no, our farm got flooded. We're gonna have to restore the farm together

1694
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:42,880
Oh, no, we're gonna have to put our love and joy into something and then and then when it's all finished

1695
03:00:42,880 --> 03:00:46,000
And we're all happy and we'll be happy. Oh, no

1696
03:00:46,880 --> 03:00:49,600
Oh, no, my ancestors the love

1697
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:58,480
I know I don't want to start anything. I'm sorry. I just thought I was curious that you were kicking so much food

1698
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:01,840
I hear boss music. I assume that's

1699
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
the reason

1700
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:06,480
I can never as always

1701
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:10,720
Actually, it kind of sounds like the harry pot. Wait

1702
03:01:11,440 --> 03:01:13,440
Is it harry pot or is it avenger?

1703
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:28,320
What one's that?

1704
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:31,840
Is that marvel? I think that's marvel

1705
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:36,800
Oh the avenger scene. Oh, that's what it is

1706
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:44,000
We're making the game thinks we're trying to hunt in this perfect one. I'm like, no, look at the third one

1707
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:50,400
We look one. Oh, there's a wee building to the left, Reeflings. There's a little thing to the left

1708
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:56,160
Oh, that's a busty crust station or a crusty bust station. Okay

1709
03:01:57,440 --> 03:02:03,520
What's the difference between uh, lobster with the boot job or something?

1710
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:05,920
I can't remember

1711
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:18,800
Thank you for the five

1712
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:20,080
uh, lunar sky wolf

1713
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:26,160
Brian says like there's actually a Brian tester if you do like if you take on Google like take speech

1714
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:29,040
um

1715
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:30,640
Twitter

1716
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:32,720
Twitter maybe like uh, don't know

1717
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:39,200
There's like a program that already has Brian and you can type in what you want to say to make sure he says it right

1718
03:02:40,080 --> 03:02:45,360
Um, like sometimes you have to spell words a bit differently because Brian gets a little bit confused

1719
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:49,760
I'm I'm sure there's a joke and I've already forgotten it and I used to tell all the time

1720
03:02:51,280 --> 03:02:54,640
And my dad's fucking sick of hearing it. It's like what's the difference between

1721
03:02:55,600 --> 03:03:01,920
Oh, what's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with a boot job

1722
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:06,560
And then the answer is one

1723
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:09,440
A crusty

1724
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:14,320
Bus station and one's a busty crust station. Very good

1725
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:21,520
Ta-da, I don't know if my accent made that like 10 times harder than it needed to be to understand it. But yeah

1726
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:29,440
Yeah, what's the difference between old bus stop and a lobster with implants when it is a yeah, I said wait wait hold on hold on

1727
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:35,440
What's the difference between a dirty old bus station and a lobster with breast implants?

1728
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:39,120
One is a crusty bus station and the other is a busty crust station

1729
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:44,800
Oh, thank you. Thank you. It's a good joke. I love it

1730
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:47,760
Mmm

1731
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:55,120
Um, I made some clips yesterday after stream the youtube clip until but it's only a minute

1732
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:58,160
Uh, yes, it's still

1733
03:03:58,720 --> 03:03:59,600
useful

1734
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:02,800
We are going to there's actually an anonymous person

1735
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:07,760
Who's been dropping us files on the girls like highlight files with the girls

1736
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:12,160
They made one for mercy and from not mistaken. They made one for

1737
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:15,120
Oh, it's the maidenless guy

1738
03:04:15,920 --> 03:04:17,920
Uh, a highlight rule for Emmy

1739
03:04:18,880 --> 03:04:24,800
But we're going to test of putting up like short three minute videos of a stream highlight and seeing how that gets received

1740
03:04:25,360 --> 03:04:30,960
And if it does well or not, if not, then kind of clips that are for shorts only might be the best way

1741
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:36,880
Uh, what am I supposed to answer? Wait, hold on. Hold on

1742
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:42,800
Ah, there you are the great rune and had your audience with the two fingers. Yes, I did

1743
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:47,600
They didn't seem right

1744
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:50,160
I mean

1745
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:52,160
Fingers are the fingers

1746
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:56,160
You may go that made the wisdom of the two

1747
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:59,840
Oh, he's not happy

1748
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:02,960
Do his quest line it helps for DLC. Oh, sorry

1749
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:05,920
The two fingers seem off

1750
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:09,520
Your intuition serves you well

1751
03:05:10,400 --> 03:05:13,920
My doubts had been piling up. You see

1752
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:21,520
The words of the two fingers cannot be trusted. What's the difference between a light bulb and the pregnant woman?

1753
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:23,920
You cannot screw light bulb

1754
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:30,880
Oh, brian will stand up comedian you are. Thank you tk for the five

1755
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:34,960
I appreciate it. Thanks for the needle

1756
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:42,560
Harbour no love. So this is how we do the dlc. That's the part that irks the most the fingers have no love

1757
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:45,840
Oh, I have a

1758
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:48,560
Festering bloody thing

1759
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:52,560
a means for circumventing the draw of the two fingers

1760
03:05:53,440 --> 03:06:00,240
Give it a try. Won't you and if it please you may we meet again? You also need to do kaolin

1761
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:02,240
Hope's for you

1762
03:06:02,400 --> 03:06:04,400
My mannequin

1763
03:06:07,120 --> 03:06:13,360
That's what I had to do. Yeah, did I do it right? I need to go see him in kaolin

1764
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:26,480
What are you doing? Are you mottin gotta use the fingers a couple of times now

1765
03:06:26,480 --> 03:06:28,480
I would do

1766
03:06:29,840 --> 03:06:32,960
Look for bloody feral thing gods

1767
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:41,680
Well, can't agree to the go under my skin costume. I'm looking this one

1768
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:47,680
Uh

1769
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:54,400
Am I going crazy? Oh, it's right there at 10. Wait, I have to invade

1770
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:58,640
I

1771
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,040
Have to actually hurt people

1772
03:07:02,720 --> 03:07:06,960
But I use the fingers and then talk to him again. Oh no

1773
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:13,840
You can just invade. Oh, I have so much points on me though. I don't want to lose my points

1774
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:16,640
That's my next level up

1775
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:19,680
The heck is this

1776
03:07:20,560 --> 03:07:23,440
The ruse church and a little like a ruse church to me

1777
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:26,400
Where is the

1778
03:07:28,240 --> 03:07:29,680
Question

1779
03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:34,240
The strongy have a mean tag on play though. Yeah, I felt safe all up all wrong

1780
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,720
It's with an eight

1781
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:38,880
Right, we're just gonna do it

1782
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:43,280
I'm just gonna do it. So what you or can't use it. Why not?

1783
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:46,800
Right. Are you guys ready to watch me go attack some people?

1784
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:52,160
Or you can just do what the creepy maid almost did tell you

1785
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:56,400
You can kill magnus the beast thought and

1786
03:07:57,040 --> 03:08:02,000
Wait and ride blood ruin instead. Don't have to do the same game. Wait. Who's that then?

1787
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:07,840
Magnus the beast claw that guy way at the end of the main games

1788
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:14,640
She does indeed yeah, I felt cephalopog wrong

1789
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:22,720
It's supposed to be cephalopog, but then I realized because I spelt it wrong. That's even more on par for me

1790
03:08:24,400 --> 03:08:26,400
I

1791
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:30,960
It's an mpc in bed. Okay. Okay, right replays

1792
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:37,920
If you guys the spawn wait if I kill you right now replaying does that count?

1793
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:41,680
Are you want to sacrifice your flesh to mummy?

1794
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:49,680
I'm not gonna take your flesh. It's fine. I don't think it counts if I hurt you someone says it's an mpc in bed

1795
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:51,760
So I'm not gonna hurt you right

1796
03:08:52,720 --> 03:08:57,600
Mmm, is that you offering yourself or is that you say no?

1797
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:03,600
Wait, I thought right so that kick the reef ones out and then use that for a finger

1798
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:08,480
You have to invade him can I invade you guys?

1799
03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:19,320
Okay, right, okay get replays, please leave and then we're gonna skip to this next part go to the next grace

1800
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,160
Uh

1801
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:25,240
Yes, the next grace I know where that is. Yes. Uh the next grace. Yes

1802
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:28,520
Grace grace grace where follow the purple reef

1803
03:09:30,440 --> 03:09:32,440
You know the finger is player

1804
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:35,400
Well

1805
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:38,760
Why don't we just give it a roll either? We'll win or lose. It's not really a big deal

1806
03:09:39,400 --> 03:09:42,040
Considering how many runes you guys are feeding me

1807
03:09:49,480 --> 03:09:51,480
I

1808
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:55,240
Losing still counts for the quick. Okay. Thank goodness. I was nervous

1809
03:09:55,320 --> 03:10:02,200
It was one of those things where like you have to win against people who play this game and have a major interest in being

1810
03:10:02,920 --> 03:10:04,920
Only

1811
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:08,120
Oh, there's a chair. Hello

1812
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:14,200
Ace rained atcha

1813
03:10:14,920 --> 03:10:19,880
Is an hatch a hatch it would be better than what I have

1814
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:24,840
No, it's a different category. It's like a magic type thing

1815
03:10:25,880 --> 03:10:30,600
It causes frost build up though. Oh, I do like to get past them a bit

1816
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:33,640
What's wrong?

1817
03:10:33,800 --> 03:10:37,560
Oh, it's just terrible and everything though. I just get worse

1818
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,520
um

1819
03:10:40,520 --> 03:10:46,040
Okay, we're we're doing something. I don't know where the next three players follow the purple reef going

1820
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:54,600
Magnificent later on when you go up an elevator out. Oh, we're getting a little lean

1821
03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:04,040
I see it. Okay. So claim this and then go to pvp and then

1822
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
Wait, how come?

1823
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:17,080
Okay, so now I click on the finger

1824
03:11:21,160 --> 03:11:23,160
Oh, no, this can't be

1825
03:11:25,080 --> 03:11:27,080
Invasion

1826
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:29,160
Bose

1827
03:11:29,720 --> 03:11:31,720
Uh, wait for old finger use

1828
03:11:33,080 --> 03:11:37,880
Uh, attempting to evade another word select the bones both near and far

1829
03:11:38,840 --> 03:11:40,840
Yes

1830
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:49,880
Uh

1831
03:11:54,760 --> 03:11:59,880
It might take forever my internet crash trip

1832
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:01,960
Oh

1833
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:08,360
No, wait, I I debuff myself because I

1834
03:12:11,240 --> 03:12:13,240
How do I undo it

1835
03:12:15,400 --> 03:12:17,400
How do I undo that?

1836
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:23,400
Here you are

1837
03:12:23,400 --> 03:12:28,280
Oh, no, it's only going to put me against swiss because it's like, oh you're level kabillion

1838
03:12:29,880 --> 03:12:34,040
You're so high level. You're not going to get any matches. So how high level am I? Oh, no

1839
03:12:35,800 --> 03:12:37,800
Okay

1840
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:41,080
If that's the case, we might as well just enjoy the

1841
03:12:42,520 --> 03:12:44,520
I don't know how to reset it

1842
03:12:50,120 --> 03:12:52,520
Do you think if someone's gonna think I'm a swear

1843
03:12:53,800 --> 03:12:55,800
What did that do

1844
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
Do anything

1845
03:12:59,080 --> 03:13:02,440
Severed finger or rest of the grace. Okay rest of the grace

1846
03:13:08,200 --> 03:13:11,320
Okay, so the npc's in game count however

1847
03:13:17,080 --> 03:13:24,120
Uh, I don't know what thing takes me out of it though. Um, um, um, I don't know where the furrow finger is

1848
03:13:26,600 --> 03:13:28,600
Hopefully it's a replay

1849
03:13:29,720 --> 03:13:31,720
Oh, no

1850
03:13:33,640 --> 03:13:35,640
I'm in limb grave

1851
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:42,440
Things don't hurt me

1852
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:45,480
Wait refling

1853
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:49,720
Hi, I don't I don't want to hurt you

1854
03:13:51,560 --> 03:13:53,560
Refling

1855
03:13:54,520 --> 03:13:56,520
No

1856
03:13:56,600 --> 03:13:58,600
No, I'm not fighting

1857
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:06,600
No, I don't want to fight. Holy stinking. Let me leave. That's it use can't use

1858
03:14:11,400 --> 03:14:14,440
Uh, I don't know what I am. Let's me read

1859
03:14:16,600 --> 03:14:18,600
I just honestly know a big deal. I'm not paying

1860
03:14:19,160 --> 03:14:21,160
Uh

1861
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:28,680
Use the finger

1862
03:14:30,200 --> 03:14:32,200
I genuinely

1863
03:14:32,200 --> 03:14:36,520
Not the famous Ion use the finger

1864
03:14:45,320 --> 03:14:47,320
Under monitor menu

1865
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:51,160
This

1866
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:57,080
Oh, whoa, what are you doing, bro? Let me go. Let me go. What the fuck?

1867
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:02,360
Man, don't be a bunch of pussies. Just let me read

1868
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:16,520
Uh, I don't actually want to fight. Okay, that took me so long. I do apologize for that. Holy, they're so weak

1869
03:15:17,480 --> 03:15:23,000
I'm so overpowered. Why would the game put me in with them? I feel bad. Right. So that counts as one

1870
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:31,400
So do it all over again. You need to do it two more times, right both near and far. Okay

1871
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:35,480
Do it three times

1872
03:15:36,920 --> 03:15:39,240
I I love that due to your huge, uh

1873
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:41,880
Vigor they couldn't kill you

1874
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:44,680
They aren't used to have people having that much xp

1875
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:51,080
Yeah, so even though I'm like mega leveled off, I guess they didn't really hear that much

1876
03:15:54,360 --> 03:15:58,760
I thought yeah, because I thought the servers were going to be like, no, wait a minute

1877
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:06,200
No way those flowers are nasturtiums

1878
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:13,160
I recognize the lily pad leaves and flower color from anywhere. We're literally on nasturtiums. Look at the lily pad leaf

1879
03:16:15,320 --> 03:16:20,600
No way we're on nasturtiums. That's so cute. I didn't even know they had them in this game

1880
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:29,080
Okay, I press star I press multi player. I press the finger. Whoa, that was a bit too quick

1881
03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:33,320
I press star and then I get the heck out of here. Bye

1882
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:35,720
Hi

1883
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:44,600
So level 200 and like zero plus weapon you're matching people with similar levels and weapons

1884
03:16:48,440 --> 03:16:52,200
So that counted one more time one more time

1885
03:16:53,960 --> 03:16:54,760
You know what it is

1886
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:59,000
I think they're matching you with people with the game weapons current upgrades

1887
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:03,400
So they basically can't even hurt you with their stats. Okay, that's funny

1888
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:06,520
I'll take that. I'll take that

1889
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:10,280
Are the girls streaming? Did they manage to do that club?

1890
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:19,560
Who knew my underpowered weaponry was all like that

1891
03:17:21,800 --> 03:17:25,880
Oh, that's a block with this honestly

1892
03:17:29,480 --> 03:17:32,200
That holds down. No that holds down

1893
03:17:33,560 --> 03:17:36,040
No, it just looks like a weird power stance thing

1894
03:17:37,880 --> 03:17:43,240
How is that an ulti? Is it boosted? Oh, it's boosting me. It's giving me a boost. I can see the gold on me

1895
03:17:49,080 --> 03:17:51,720
I think you can only have a 20 plus or below

1896
03:17:51,720 --> 03:17:53,720
Okay

1897
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:07,080
Okay, we only need one more I boost your poise too, which is why it stopped you getting staggered. Oh

1898
03:18:09,560 --> 03:18:12,060
Stomped then heavy attack it does a follow-up

1899
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:15,020
Oh

1900
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:24,460
That's so sad. It's fine. Let's try it out. I'm feeling confident after those those two people tried to beat me up

1901
03:18:25,980 --> 03:18:27,980
Right, so give them a stomp

1902
03:18:31,340 --> 03:18:33,340
Oh

1903
03:18:34,300 --> 03:18:36,300
Oh

1904
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:43,260
No, I don't want to fight you now you got too much HP

1905
03:18:44,780 --> 03:18:48,380
Oh wait, am I going to stop searching for enemies if I mock it up

1906
03:18:49,100 --> 03:18:53,100
If I start up face if I start beating people up, I might even go have any

1907
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:56,700
Why is there always

1908
03:18:57,340 --> 03:18:59,340
He doesn't like it

1909
03:18:59,900 --> 03:19:01,900
Necessary eight on my head

1910
03:19:02,860 --> 03:19:05,420
Necessary out my head, but be wary of strong four

1911
03:19:10,620 --> 03:19:13,260
You can just do a light attack near the critical area

1912
03:19:15,020 --> 03:19:17,020
Yeah, I'm still searching it better be

1913
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:20,460
What is it coming over?

1914
03:19:21,900 --> 03:19:23,900
I don't know like it looks like it's giving up

1915
03:19:24,620 --> 03:19:28,700
Come on. We need one more world to invade right. Let's admire the nasturtians

1916
03:19:28,940 --> 03:19:33,260
The reason my nasturtiums are so awesome is they can actually grow in really poor soil quality

1917
03:19:33,580 --> 03:19:39,340
Something so beautiful can start from uh, even without the best conditions just like a weekend

1918
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:46,540
As no one is perfect and you don't have to be

1919
03:19:47,660 --> 03:19:49,660
You get nasturtiums are like that too

1920
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:53,900
And they have lots of big green leaves to get all the nutrition for their pollen

1921
03:19:54,140 --> 03:19:58,620
Their seeds are actually really interesting. They have very round bulbous seeds like in a circular

1922
03:19:59,100 --> 03:20:02,460
Seed it's actually really pretty to watch seeds of an nasturtium form

1923
03:20:03,660 --> 03:20:04,940
Um

1924
03:20:04,940 --> 03:20:08,780
I'm gonna go try and sleep. I'll try and join when I wake up, which will be the next stream

1925
03:20:09,180 --> 03:20:13,740
Considering we're only uh, what the three of our mark. I'll see you when you wake up. Okay

1926
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:18,860
If anyone goes to sleep probably after the what

1927
03:20:20,140 --> 03:20:23,740
Five hour mark, then maybe I might not be able to see you

1928
03:20:24,460 --> 03:20:27,500
But after that I should

1929
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:34,060
Um, I will get some uh actual food. I have been

1930
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:40,460
So clogged up. I'm starting to get annoying the reason why I'm meme about animals so much

1931
03:20:41,020 --> 03:20:44,540
It's because I'm like two steps away from giving myself a freaking animal

1932
03:20:46,140 --> 03:20:51,180
And because I'm getting sick good night. Sorry. That's probably the last thing you want to hear before you're about to go to sleep

1933
03:20:51,180 --> 03:20:53,180
We're gonna have dreams about you

1934
03:20:54,460 --> 03:20:55,420
Sorry

1935
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:59,980
The plan is to skip sleeping. No, you don't need to skip. We're literally doing this back to back to back to back

1936
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:02,300
I have told the girls

1937
03:21:02,380 --> 03:21:07,420
Well, I've actually not told them. I probably should put a message in the discord and just be like

1938
03:21:07,900 --> 03:21:12,540
But once Amy goes away on holiday, this is her last stream. So I'm gonna I'm gonna send her a nice dm

1939
03:21:13,100 --> 03:21:18,300
I'm just gonna thank her for all her hard work. She uh earns. She has rightfully earned her vacation

1940
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:23,020
Um, she's done a few things in the background to make sure the pinpals are well fed

1941
03:21:23,420 --> 03:21:26,460
And then after that, I'm just gonna put a message in the discord and just say

1942
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:27,820
Hi

1943
03:21:27,820 --> 03:21:29,260
strongy here

1944
03:21:29,260 --> 03:21:33,180
I'm playing with the reef links for the next foreseeable day week

1945
03:21:33,580 --> 03:21:39,100
Uh, do not interrupt me. I couldn't care less if you get yourself in trouble. You're an adult deal with the consequences

1946
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:41,020
sent

1947
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:46,620
That's what they're getting from me. That's literally all they're getting from me. You will deal with the consequences of your actions

1948
03:21:47,420 --> 03:21:53,740
By yourself. Bye. I'm not your I am not your mom. Do not come to be for an answer. I am with the reef links. Bye

1949
03:21:55,420 --> 03:21:57,420
That's it. That's all they're getting

1950
03:21:59,260 --> 03:22:01,580
Yeah, this has been a long time coming

1951
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:09,740
To do elven main and get the dlc together, which is so fantastic. So quick we get to do the dlc as well

1952
03:22:11,740 --> 03:22:13,660
Um

1953
03:22:13,660 --> 03:22:16,220
Yeah, I actually need to put up my screen for tomorrow

1954
03:22:17,580 --> 03:22:22,700
What is going on with that? There's like some weird mirage effect going on with my

1955
03:22:23,820 --> 03:22:27,020
Oh, come on. Just invade one more person one more

1956
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:31,180
It's turning into a bout rule run one more. Please read things one more

1957
03:22:33,020 --> 03:22:35,020
Sorry, I'm gonna make some emotions like

1958
03:22:36,700 --> 03:22:39,740
I did the melena cosplay you saw the castello

1959
03:22:40,140 --> 03:22:41,100
Oh

1960
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:44,140
Sorry, I missed you. I do apologize to anyone who

1961
03:22:44,860 --> 03:22:48,620
I can't grab but please don't worry. I'm playing for the next like literally five days or something

1962
03:22:50,220 --> 03:22:52,220
Uh

1963
03:22:52,700 --> 03:22:57,260
Let's going up staying up all night with mommy only if it's healthy and you don't have work or something

1964
03:22:57,420 --> 03:23:01,420
Is that a weekend? I don't know to get to the dlc. You have to finish this quest

1965
03:23:02,380 --> 03:23:03,580
Mog

1966
03:23:03,580 --> 03:23:05,580
We need to mog mohoog

1967
03:23:06,060 --> 03:23:12,060
And then go to kaolin and kill radahan. Yes, we can absolutely do that. Oh, I do not like that radahan

1968
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:22,140
I have kayaking with my dad at seven from you would be sharp

1969
03:23:24,540 --> 03:23:32,140

Try it again

1972
03:23:49,580 --> 03:23:51,580
Come on, I want to play with my reef lens

1973
03:23:53,420 --> 03:23:56,620
Get them servers up right no

1974

And put me in someone's

1975
03:24:00,140 --> 03:24:07,580
Silly we game so I can immediately leave and meet the requirements of the silly maidless twat bag

1976
03:24:19,020 --> 03:24:25,420
If you ever get upgraded you should try to upgrade your weapon. Yes, uh, we will come across one naturally through the lens

1977
03:24:26,060 --> 03:24:31,580
Through the lens in between. Oh my god. I'm talking like a real elden ring player as if I'm gonna get my handheld

1978
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:33,820
Look sometimes I deserve to get my handheld

1979
03:24:34,540 --> 03:24:41,340
Maybe after the oh my god after the series I should make an audio for twitter doing something nefarious

03:24:41,420 --> 03:24:43,420
But I should call you the tarnished one

1981
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:45,980

Oh, no, I deactivated the

03:25:24,780 --> 03:25:26,780

2076
03:31:59,260 --> 03:32:02,620
Don't fly off. No, don't target me. That's even worse

2077
03:32:05,100 --> 03:32:07,600
The camera isn't picking on his leg

I knew dragon power

2085
03:32:41,580 --> 03:32:43,980
I remember there's a key behind the dragon

2086
03:32:45,740 --> 03:32:51,180
What tear drops scarabs there are both crimson and cruelly crue

2087
03:32:52,060 --> 03:32:53,580
Cerulean

2088
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:59,180
Peer drops scarabs defeat them to replenish blood. Ah, that is quite valuable. Actually, I quite like that

2089
03:33:00,060 --> 03:33:03,660
Rather fond of that. Hello. I'm sorry you can

2090
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:07,500
But thank you for the key. It's of great importance

2091
03:33:08,300 --> 03:33:10,300

2092
03:33:10,460 --> 03:33:13,980
Go back to the church the original church in limb group

2093
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:15,500
refling

2094
03:33:15,500 --> 03:33:17,020
Hello

2095
03:33:17,020 --> 03:33:19,020

2096
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:24,540
Hello, am I alone again? I'm scared. I'm scared teleport me out

2097
03:33:25,980 --> 03:33:31,020
Uh, no they go to the bad church this one. No, that was a shack

2098
03:33:34,700 --> 03:33:38,220
Uh, I guess we're gonna be riding torrent

2099
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:43,980
They killed the boys. No, don't make me alone

2100
03:33:44,220 --> 03:33:46,220
Oh

2101
03:33:46,620 --> 03:33:52,860
Wait, maybe it would actually be easier to travel downwards to the the temple. I think it might be easier to do that

2102
03:33:54,300 --> 03:33:58,620
Scared mom is a thing. Yeah. Okay, let's get on torrent

2103
03:34:00,220 --> 03:34:03,900
Let's get our headings. We need to go a teeny bit like this

2104
03:34:06,380 --> 03:34:10,700
We'll just be line it. There's no such thing as enemies. They're not real

2105
03:34:11,180 --> 03:34:14,780
And it's not just because I'm scared that I don't have my briefings with me

2106
03:34:16,700 --> 03:34:18,700
Um

2107
03:34:18,700 --> 03:34:21,900
Church question mark. No a little to the left

2108
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:26,700
I'm trying to see it through the through the trees

2109
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:30,620
This is a building

2110
03:34:31,180 --> 03:34:33,180
A little to the left again

2111
03:34:33,180 --> 03:34:35,180
We're drifting course a little bit

2112
03:34:35,980 --> 03:34:38,380
That's okay because it's not always linear

2113
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:43,100
That's like life life isn't linear either. Ah

2114
03:34:46,380 --> 03:34:49,180
But we are here with you good, that's what I like to see

2115
03:34:49,900 --> 03:34:53,980
Because I'm just terrified to play games on my own that aren't made for children

2116
03:34:55,180 --> 03:35:00,300
If the game isn't made for children, I don't stand a chance. Uh, how do I get off work?

2117
03:35:01,180 --> 03:35:03,340

03:37:47,980 --> 03:37:49,980

2164
03:37:57,900 --> 03:37:59,900
First church of

2165
03:38:07,340 --> 03:38:10,860

Soon his quest line will trigger some PTSD. Oh, no

2174
03:38:50,140 --> 03:38:56,060
Clipping while live is a pain in the butt. Is it actually the beginning of the game is the destination, but

We need to do that. We have to go to the four bell for you to be finsely. They're your best Ronnie. I always do

03:42:35,340 --> 03:42:37,340

Oh, I can't only

2234
03:43:14,460 --> 03:43:16,460
I can't only the

03:43:56,540 --> 03:44:00,780
Don't do that. I'm scared. How do I even have that item that can do that?

2245
03:44:06,700 --> 03:44:11,580
Look I have a belly does anyone know how to teach me belly flop yet. I don't think so

2246

2288
03:47:47,900 --> 03:47:49,900
I can't wait to play jelly bean

2289
03:47:52,300 --> 03:47:54,060
um

2290
03:47:54,060 --> 03:47:56,220
I managed to talk to oh

2291
03:47:57,180 --> 03:47:59,820
Oh dear i'm doing big role, but you can get a good look

2292
03:48:02,300 --> 03:48:08,860
Well something's making noise. Oh, it's just you guys absolutely blasting this guy. How could I be so silly?

2293
03:48:11,500 --> 03:48:16,220
Are you ready for the two-handed? Oh something's happening. Is he gone?

2294
03:48:17,020 --> 03:48:19,020
Oh

2295
03:48:20,620 --> 03:48:22,620
You're so strong

2296
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:27,660
Please don't stop roll. Literally. I'm almost there. Look you can get such a good slam

2297
03:48:30,540 --> 03:48:36,780
Wait, no, sorry. I can't ruin it yet. Sorry. I can't spoil it yet. Ah, this is the problem I have

2298
03:48:38,220 --> 03:48:40,780
Here air to trees favor

2299
03:48:41,500 --> 03:48:42,780
I

2300
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:51,020
Can't spoil it, but it's happening today. I believe raises maximum HP and equipment look wait a minute. Oh a fast roll now. No, we want

2301
03:48:52,380 --> 03:48:57,740
Thank you for the talisman. You guys are so selfless like you guys are so good to me

2302
03:48:57,740 --> 03:49:03,900
You're like, oh this one item I can only get by playing the game once. Oh here you have it strongy and it's like, oh you're so

2303
03:49:05,980 --> 03:49:07,980
Selfless is the description

2304
03:49:08,780 --> 03:49:15,980
If english isn't your first language, it kind of sounds like the word selfish, but it's opposite. It's selfless

2305
03:49:18,140 --> 03:49:20,140
So don't worry if you get a bit confused

2306
03:49:20,300 --> 03:49:25,980
The english language is a little bit like that where it sounds so a rolling girl for gen 2

2307
03:49:26,140 --> 03:49:29,340
I'll just have a boulder for gen 2. Just a rock

2308
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:33,020
Um

2309
03:49:33,020 --> 03:49:35,500
Yeah, I got a third concept back. I quite like it

2310
03:49:36,460 --> 03:49:38,460
A few tweaks

2311
03:49:40,860 --> 03:49:42,860
And the things are heating up

2312
03:49:44,060 --> 03:49:46,300
And by that I just mean it's just concept art

2313
03:49:47,580 --> 03:49:49,580
You don't have to get too scared

2314
03:49:50,620 --> 03:49:52,620
Uh

2315
03:49:53,340 --> 03:49:57,100
This girl, what's a siphoth a rock, but not a slime

2316
03:49:57,900 --> 03:50:03,660
How dare you okay? I open the tip. I open the tip. I have an imbecile

2317
03:50:03,980 --> 03:50:05,980
So ward key

2318
03:50:05,980 --> 03:50:12,940
I am struggling with english today. Thank you for not making fun of me when I pronounce stuff wrong by accident

2319
03:50:13,580 --> 03:50:19,100
And like sometimes I'll be funny with a word, but I have to admit sometimes it just comes out all wrong

2320
03:50:19,180 --> 03:50:23,100
But like you guys don't make fun of me and I actually I'm quite pleased to put it in this one

2321
03:50:25,180 --> 03:50:27,340
Take it take my imbecile key

03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:13,500
You don't have to do it like that

Just use the multiplayer finger press star and go multiplayer and use this that's how you leave

You don't have to do that. Don't do that. Make me upset ease again

2343
03:52:08,140 --> 03:52:12,700

2344
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:15,500
Well, I don't seem to have it

2345
03:52:15,900 --> 03:52:17,900

2349
03:52:33,420 --> 03:52:39,740
He's gonna walk into my swing because I'm such a big girl. I'm such a big girl. I'm gonna die of blood loss

2350
03:52:40,380 --> 03:52:42,380
Okay, okay. I'm gonna heal

03:53:11,020 --> 03:53:15,980
Okay, swing swing. I'm trying to figure out what the attack bar it is

2359
03:53:17,340 --> 03:53:19,340
I didn't know you could do that move

2360
03:53:21,500 --> 03:53:23,500
Oh my god, you're almost on the center

2361
03:53:25,260 --> 03:53:30,540
Your hp in my bar is all I have. I didn't know he could thrust like that

2362
03:53:33,100 --> 03:53:35,100
Fuck

2363
03:53:36,060 --> 03:53:38,620
We're both swinging for fucking lanes here

2364
03:53:39,660 --> 03:53:41,660
I'm out of stamina shit

2365
03:53:41,820 --> 03:53:46,540
Oh, no, what is that? What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? He's used an incantation

2366
03:53:47,500 --> 03:53:49,500
But I don't know what it means

2367
03:53:49,660 --> 03:53:51,660
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

2368
03:53:51,660 --> 03:53:53,660
Right, right, right, right, right

2372
03:54:09,820 --> 03:54:11,820
Oh my gosh

2373
03:54:13,180 --> 03:54:15,180
Wait, wait, that's where it came from

2374
03:54:16,300 --> 03:54:18,300
Wait, what?

2375
03:54:20,220 --> 03:54:22,220
What do I do? Wait, is this all?

2376
03:54:23,100 --> 03:54:28,540
And only a hundred levels higher than the recommended. No, that's where you go and go there. You got this. Okay. Okay. Thank you

2377
03:54:29,500 --> 03:54:33,340
Ah revenge. I did get my revenge fellow tarnish

2378
03:54:34,300 --> 03:54:37,180
So I guess if you kill him

2379
03:54:37,740 --> 03:54:39,740
Before he does the scream or whatever

2380
03:54:40,140 --> 03:54:44,300
You softlock yourself and you have to jump off the map anyway. Ooh, what's up here?

2381
03:54:45,820 --> 03:54:47,820
I love exploring

2382
03:54:48,060 --> 03:54:49,900
The storm hawk

2383
03:54:49,900 --> 03:54:50,780

2385
03:54:52,780 --> 03:54:54,780
Is that an ash?

2386
03:54:54,940 --> 03:54:56,940
Even more curious. Hello

2387
03:54:57,580 --> 03:54:59,580
What are you?

2388
03:54:59,820 --> 03:55:01,820

2389
03:55:01,820 --> 03:55:03,820

2390
03:55:04,620 --> 03:55:06,220

2391
03:55:06,220 --> 03:55:08,220
Dean

2392
03:55:08,380 --> 03:55:10,860
Doesn't sound like a very bird friendly name, but sure

2393
03:55:11,820 --> 03:55:13,820
Jump the ledge

2394
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:15,980
Wee

2395
03:55:15,980 --> 03:55:17,980
Angle back into the

2396
03:55:20,540 --> 03:55:22,540
Her

2397
03:55:23,900 --> 03:55:25,900
Die clothed with maiden's blood

2398
03:55:26,860 --> 03:55:28,860
Oh

2399
03:55:29,500 --> 03:55:33,180
Yeah, you don't look too whole. Are you feeling okay? Who perished you?

2400
03:55:34,140 --> 03:55:36,140
Did that guy perish right?

2401
03:55:36,140 --> 03:55:37,580
Yes

2402
03:55:37,580 --> 03:55:39,580
Wait, how are people dying?

2403
03:55:42,620 --> 03:55:46,620
Hmm back to very

2404
03:55:48,940 --> 03:55:52,460
Which is here, so I need to keep doing the horse stuff, but that's okay

2405
03:55:52,940 --> 03:55:59,580
That's your original maiden? Not millennia

2406
03:56:03,820 --> 03:56:05,820
Now we do a meme marker

2407
03:56:08,620 --> 03:56:10,620
Oh, I forgot I can swing on horse

2408
03:56:16,140 --> 03:56:18,620
Do it slowly you need to pick up an item on teleport

2409
03:56:19,180 --> 03:56:27,340
She was your original maiden, but she died before you awoke so millennia adopted me

2410
03:56:31,020 --> 03:56:33,020
Ah

2411
03:56:33,980 --> 03:56:40,380
Well, I have a blood soaked brag so I go talk to mr. Barry or bear. Sorry

2412
03:56:40,620 --> 03:56:42,620
Oh

2413
03:56:44,140 --> 03:56:50,380
My god, my first sword is spanking the horse of torrent. That's not very nice before see he's just trying his best

2414
03:56:53,100 --> 03:56:57,980
Oh, I heard that I hear that something's lurking in the shadows. I hear it

2415
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:04,780
A dead maiden I heard a torrent link it's torrent a reef link

2416
03:57:05,420 --> 03:57:07,420
Oh

2417
03:57:09,020 --> 03:57:11,020
Dead maiden on

2418
03:57:13,180 --> 03:57:15,820
Okay, let's uh go off

2419
03:57:17,420 --> 03:57:21,900
And then speak to the mr. Hello, ah my lambkin

2420
03:57:23,260 --> 03:57:30,460
You've completed your final trial. Uh-huh and with this you are a formal inductee

2421
03:57:31,420 --> 03:57:39,020
A knight who will assist luminary mog the lord of blood in the establishment of a new dynasty

2422
03:57:39,740 --> 03:57:41,180
now

2423
03:57:41,180 --> 03:57:43,180
Give me your finger

2424
03:57:43,180 --> 03:57:48,780
This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor once it settles

2425
03:57:49,740 --> 03:57:51,740
Inside of you

2426
03:57:54,060 --> 03:57:56,060
I guess I give him my finger

2427
03:58:00,620 --> 03:58:04,700
Um, this is kind of scary. What does the blood do to me though?

2428
03:58:06,300 --> 03:58:10,220
Thank goodness. This is a video game and not real life. It sounds like he's giving me a STD

2429
03:58:11,820 --> 03:58:14,940
The toenail moment is wait. He's taking it off

2430
03:58:25,020 --> 03:58:27,020
He's taking my fingernail

2431
03:58:27,260 --> 03:58:31,020
Good heavens clench your teeth or something

2432
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:36,460
He took my fingernail

2433
03:58:38,540 --> 03:58:46,380
Never forget that feeling of agony for it is what binds you to luminary mog to all of us

2434
03:58:50,300 --> 03:58:54,780
You have the sweetest scream my lambkin

2435
03:58:55,500 --> 03:59:00,860
Is that the only oh another thing you should have this

2436
03:59:05,580 --> 03:59:09,100
A medal granted by the new mogwin dynasty

2437
03:59:09,820 --> 03:59:13,260
With the power to grant audience with luminary mog

2438
03:59:13,980 --> 03:59:17,100
I've gone out of my way to provide one to you

2439
03:59:17,820 --> 03:59:19,820
But you mustn't use it just yet

2440
03:59:20,780 --> 03:59:24,620
The meeting must wait until the mogwin dynasty commences

2441
03:59:25,500 --> 03:59:29,180
Luminary mog yet slumbers beside the divinity

2442
03:59:29,980 --> 03:59:33,100
We must endure a little longer

2443
03:59:34,860 --> 03:59:36,860
Uh

2444
03:59:37,740 --> 03:59:40,380
Use it use the inventory

2445
03:59:42,060 --> 03:59:45,100
You go to the audience grounds

2446
03:59:46,540 --> 03:59:48,540
Okay

2447
03:59:48,540 --> 03:59:50,540
Use it

2448
03:59:51,580 --> 03:59:54,540
I have no idea. This is no stuff. I don't know

2449
03:59:56,140 --> 03:59:58,780
Is there a safe site so I can call in the reeflings like right now?

2450
04:00:02,620 --> 04:00:10,300
I'm scared there's noises and I don't recognize it and I'm all alone. Oh no, I'm so scared

2451
04:00:10,300 --> 04:00:12,300
Oh

2452
04:00:16,540 --> 04:00:18,540
My god

2453
04:00:20,380 --> 04:00:22,380
It's all new

2454
04:00:23,900 --> 04:00:28,540
Oh, please don't attack me anything. I'm too scared. I'm just a baby

2455
04:00:29,980 --> 04:00:35,260
Please tell me the reeflings can spawn in here. Oh, I don't like this not one bit. I'm sorry

2456
04:00:36,620 --> 04:00:38,860
I don't recognize it. Can I live a lot maybe?

2457
04:00:40,860 --> 04:00:42,860
No, I can't live a lot

2458
04:00:43,820 --> 04:00:51,180
Okay last increase the replenish rate do it again. No, I only had one

2459
04:00:53,580 --> 04:00:57,820
Okay, so I'm in time. Thanks the makers. I don't have I've been here before

2460
04:01:00,300 --> 04:01:02,300

2461
04:01:03,900 --> 04:01:06,780
Is that you president Nixon? Okay, we'll try you again

2462
04:01:07,260 --> 04:01:10,940
I wrote your name twice now and I have to keep like scoring it out

2463
04:01:12,220 --> 04:01:14,220
Because you're not able to

2464
04:01:18,060 --> 04:01:20,060
Uh

2465
04:01:20,700 --> 04:01:23,260
Were you I think you're actually an invader

2466
04:01:24,780 --> 04:01:27,980
Does an enemy reefling want to come in and witness bear? Okay?

2467
04:01:28,380 --> 04:01:35,100
You actually made it in your pc didn't shit the bed so I can write your name down mr. President Nixon of the united states

2468
04:01:35,740 --> 04:01:37,740
number president

2469
04:01:37,740 --> 04:01:38,940
90

2470
04:01:38,940 --> 04:01:40,940
60

2471
04:01:41,660 --> 04:01:44,780
No, wait, there's only been wait. How many precedences are being?

2472
04:01:47,260 --> 04:01:52,540
I don't know how many presents I need an enemy reefling or because we're about to do a boss fight. We should be fine

2473
04:01:55,020 --> 04:01:58,780
46 ish. Yeah, let's see like 65 but that's not correct

2474
04:02:00,060 --> 04:02:03,100

Are you the one that had reefling is your name and I've just been debated

2481
04:02:24,300 --> 04:02:28,700
There are still a ways before the boss fight my thought is he looks like a

2482
04:02:29,900 --> 04:02:32,140
A newbie from anime

2488
04:03:08,300 --> 04:03:10,300
Oh my god, they have so much hp

2489
04:03:10,620 --> 04:03:16,140
Okay, not attacking not attacking do not engage. I repeat reeflings. Do not engage do not engage

2490
04:03:16,620 --> 04:03:18,620
They have insane hp amounts

2491
04:03:19,180 --> 04:03:22,060
I maybe need to think about upgrading my weapons to be honest

2492
04:03:22,860 --> 04:03:26,380
Do not engage uh, uh, maybe engage in this

2493
04:03:27,340 --> 04:03:29,340
So

2494
04:03:30,460 --> 04:03:32,460
Uh, I think we're gonna have to help

2495
04:03:34,380 --> 04:03:36,380
Ah

2501
04:03:57,420 --> 04:04:01,660
Servers are probably going nuts for how many players are on right now. Not gonna lie

2502
04:04:04,540 --> 04:04:10,540
Have you made it to the dlc? I think that's what's happening right now little reefling

Oh, we all Lord's ruin for doing nothing

2519
04:05:48,860 --> 04:05:50,860
That's what I like to see

2520
04:05:51,340 --> 04:05:53,340
Oh, there's an item

2521
04:05:55,420 --> 04:05:57,420

Sanguine nobles I hate them

2556
04:09:09,900 --> 04:09:15,180
I committed myself to you. You don't need to attack me. Good sir. Oh dear fucking lord. I'm scared

2562
04:09:38,940 --> 04:09:40,940
I have completely forgotten the strip

2563
04:09:45,980 --> 04:09:47,980
Right

2564
04:10:03,180 --> 04:10:06,140
Did he just call it a jewel it's a jewel

04:10:08,220 --> 04:10:10,540
Well, we wear a trio and then you ruined it

2566
04:10:11,260 --> 04:10:15,420
Fuckin hell president Nixon you're actually teaming troops. I'm not gonna lie

2567
04:10:26,540 --> 04:10:29,020
Oh my god, he hit me in two

2568
04:10:30,540 --> 04:10:32,540
He's counting

2569
04:10:32,540 --> 04:10:35,980
We're getting a free countdown. Don't you have to pay for that kind of content?

2570
04:10:41,260 --> 04:10:43,260
I

2571
04:10:45,020 --> 04:10:48,860
May need a potion did you upgrade your sword?

2572
04:10:50,540 --> 04:10:53,340
Why have a chat bring her here because they're gonna carry me

2573
04:10:55,500 --> 04:11:00,860
Are you guys up here or are you back at that grace site? Can I summon you out here? Is anyone here?

2574
04:11:03,500 --> 04:11:05,500
Oh, there are leaflings up here

2575
04:11:06,140 --> 04:11:12,460
You don't have any items for damage reduction here. I got a crab leg

2576
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:22,620
Okay, this is gonna take a few attempts. Please don't worry. Please remain seated for the rest of this ride. Um

2577
04:11:24,140 --> 04:11:26,140
Wait, did I not come you in? Yeah, I did

2578
04:11:27,500 --> 04:11:31,020
Uh, there's a flask tier that counters that one move

2579
04:11:31,820 --> 04:11:37,980
Should I just like hold back and let president nixon do it because I'm gonna be honest president nixon didn't even get hit

2580
04:11:39,100 --> 04:11:44,860
Hi lord, you've not done a boss battle. Milena. You've definitely not fought with us

2581
04:11:46,060 --> 04:11:51,100
Okay, I might just hold back and see if the leaflings can do it once we're all in

2582
04:11:53,020 --> 04:11:55,180
Definitely my a little crap leg though

2583
04:11:56,540 --> 04:12:00,700
Yeah, president nixon. I'm not gonna lie. I don't think I see him got hit one

2584
04:12:01,900 --> 04:12:03,020
I

2585
04:12:03,020 --> 04:12:07,820
Know ironically there was a point on the stream where I got distracted and stood suddenly strong

2586
04:12:07,820 --> 04:12:10,860
He says we fling and I responded out loud if that was my name. No, I'm

2587
04:12:11,580 --> 04:12:17,660
Stop that's the cutest thing ever. I love that kind of corruption. Holy crap. It's not even corruption. That's just like straight up love

2588
04:12:17,660 --> 04:12:21,580
Stop. I love that. Hi. Are you doing a little parallel thing? Right? Are you guys ready?

2589
04:12:22,460 --> 04:12:27,420
Um, I might hold back. Maybe I should invest in like long range weapon do

2590
04:12:27,900 --> 04:12:34,300
You still get hit even if you run away. Stop. It's an aoe across the whole pitch

2591
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:41,020
Oh my my runes. Uh, sorry mr. Bloodman. I know this is really important fight, but wow

2592
04:12:43,340 --> 04:12:45,340
Oh, I don't recall

2593
04:12:45,980 --> 04:12:49,420
I don't want to be a little pussy though. I'm put my poor leaflings to the pair

2594
04:12:52,300 --> 04:12:54,300
He makes it rain down with mud

2595
04:12:55,260 --> 04:12:57,260
And he's like throwing it everywhere

2596
04:13:07,900 --> 04:13:13,100
It was fun being someone embarrassing to immediately die a moment. Oh, is that you?

2597
04:13:15,820 --> 04:13:18,220
That's funny you say anything though. Thank you for the

2598
04:13:18,940 --> 04:13:20,940
Oh

2599
04:13:26,140 --> 04:13:34,060
No, no president Nixon the 46th president of the united states. Where are you when we need you?

2600
04:13:34,620 --> 04:13:36,620
Is it just me?

2601
04:13:37,660 --> 04:13:39,660
Is it just me?

2602
04:13:39,980 --> 04:13:41,980
Okay, no

2603
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:48,140
Okay, okay. Okay. This is gonna take a few attempts. I don't really think I'm gonna break them people's names

2604
04:13:48,220 --> 04:13:56,380
When it comes to a boss fight. Thank you so much maths one six one eight to be so specific for the super chat. Don't be embarrassed

2605
04:13:57,100 --> 04:13:58,620

04:13:58,620 --> 04:14:01,500
This is a tricky one come to the top of the elevator

out of morgues fight and we're just gonna try our best

2608
04:14:07,020 --> 04:14:13,020
Literally do not be embarrassed about failing because um, I'm literally so over leveled for this

2609
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:14,860
I'll try and

2610
04:14:14,860 --> 04:14:21,500
Do uh different things, but I won't count your name against a boss fight just because it's

2611
04:14:22,300 --> 04:14:27,180
I have no idea like how many times this is gonna take should be honest

2612
04:14:27,740 --> 04:14:30,860
Is this the dlc or not? We're trying to access the dlc

2613
04:14:31,260 --> 04:14:37,900
We are outside of mark wins dynasty mausoleum, but we need to kill him in order to access the dlc section

2614
04:14:37,980 --> 04:14:39,980

04:17:48,700 --> 04:17:53,300
Like you need. Oh my god. Look at that killer worm. Did you see the worm? I

2650
04:17:55,860 --> 04:18:03,260
Just like it. Okay. I'm gonna hold back as much as it pains me to watch you guys do all the heavy lifting like all the time

2651
04:18:04,620 --> 04:18:07,500
I'm gonna see if there's anyone I don't recognize

2652
04:18:08,740 --> 04:18:13,540
You have been in but you were very early. Oh just straight up rear

2653
04:18:14,620 --> 04:18:16,620
Not had you

2654
04:18:17,620 --> 04:18:19,620
Hey, what a funny name

2655
04:18:20,380 --> 04:18:24,500
Please again, don't worry. I'm not gonna like hold this against you

2656
04:18:24,500 --> 04:18:27,340
I have like a separate list and it's called boss fight

2657
04:18:27,740 --> 04:18:29,740
So I have your name

2658
04:18:30,620 --> 04:18:38,140
So I know not to be like what worm there was like a loading screen blue neon worm. Are you guys ready to carry me?

2659
04:18:38,860 --> 04:18:41,460
Oh, you want this one too? You want this one too?

2660
04:18:42,340 --> 04:18:49,020
This is our pre-war ritual if you didn't know most there was like some sort of rituals normally for like back in the day

2661
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:52,100
Where you go a war it would be like a send-off party

2662
04:18:52,100 --> 04:18:58,740
It would be everyone getting drunk and plastered it'd be this it'd be that I guess this is our equivalent of a pre-war party

2663
04:19:00,060 --> 04:19:05,100
You get clams land. This is there. We do a good luck. Bye. Oh take it

2664
04:19:06,420 --> 04:19:10,660
This is our pre-war celebration. Okay, are you guys ready to carry me?

2665
04:19:11,460 --> 04:19:14,660
I don't even know if there's a point of me eating the crab leg

2666
04:19:16,180 --> 04:19:19,900
Oh, did you say thank you? I think you did. Okay, let's get busy

2667
04:19:20,660 --> 04:19:26,480
I'm gonna let you guys do it again about slams worth even if we can carry it. Don't worry if I perish. I

2668
04:19:27,060 --> 04:19:29,060
suck

2669
04:19:29,060 --> 04:19:31,060
I can't destroy these

2670
04:19:31,220 --> 04:19:35,300
Okay, let's commentate over the reeflings. I'm just gonna crouch in the corner

2671
04:19:36,260 --> 04:19:40,900
Reefling goes in for a quick slam. We see some magical effects going into play

2672
04:19:42,420 --> 04:19:47,580
We we've got rain on blood taking out almost half of the health of the reefling. Oh

2673
04:19:48,580 --> 04:19:54,900
Three-fourths of the reefling help. He does heal up successfully recovering almost 50% of that HP up to 75%

2674
04:19:55,460 --> 04:19:57,460
for his full max HP capacity

2675
04:19:57,780 --> 04:20:03,500
We get a swing. We're now down to 50. We're back up to full health almost just a few

2676
04:20:05,540 --> 04:20:10,660
We're going in for hits. We're doing melee against the enemy. The enemy's name I've forgotten

2677
04:20:12,980 --> 04:20:14,980
The blood caster guy

2678
04:20:15,780 --> 04:20:23,220
We do have our poor reefling getting picked on taking all the HP damage second reefling comes in for the clutch to take

2679
04:20:23,300 --> 04:20:25,300
The aggro off of the boss

2680
04:20:26,020 --> 04:20:31,140
Possibly to allow some heals. We do have rain on blood effect on screen

2681
04:20:31,380 --> 04:20:39,700
Okay, we're now 50% on our second reefling in command. However, we do seem to have some sort of blood steal effect possibly

2682
04:20:40,180 --> 04:20:42,180
for health restoration

2683
04:20:42,740 --> 04:20:44,740
Hopefully we do have

2684
04:20:46,340 --> 04:20:48,340
Oh, we're getting picked on

2685
04:20:48,820 --> 04:20:54,980
Commentator comes in to take the aggro off of the reeflings. She runs away again and sheer panic and scaredness

2686
04:20:55,380 --> 04:20:57,380
Oh, I need to stand up to get a faster run

2687
04:20:58,180 --> 04:21:04,740
Okay commentator does come in for a swing to take the the aggro off of the reeflings very aggressive aggro on the reeflings

2688
04:21:05,860 --> 04:21:07,860
Okay, this is why I can't get involved. I'm sorry

2689
04:21:09,780 --> 04:21:15,700
Commentator does heal up. We've got a moon attack from Rena herself the moon lordness

2690
04:21:17,700 --> 04:21:22,740
We do have a countdown on the blood attack. We've got three rings around us

2691
04:21:24,420 --> 04:21:26,420
Get ready to heal

2692
04:21:27,540 --> 04:21:29,540
I don't think I have enough

2693
04:21:38,820 --> 04:21:43,780
Do we need to go get more flasks for me or a sacred tear possibly

2694
04:21:45,700 --> 04:21:50,740
Oh, you guys are so close Ronnie needs a quick tour for the stuff. She can't be handled like the flask

2695
04:21:50,980 --> 04:21:54,020
I think we might need to do flask tears

2696
04:21:54,740 --> 04:22:01,300
Nah, just don't get hit. Okay. Okay. I will fully stand back and watch you guys get annihilated

2697
04:22:02,020 --> 04:22:08,660
Okay, I'm gonna fully stand back. All my motherly instinct is being paused on hold because I don't want you guys to get hurt

2698
04:22:09,460 --> 04:22:11,460
It let punish boost

2699
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:19,780
Uh, what wait, is that that actor who's seen me?

2700
04:22:19,780 --> 04:22:21,780
Who's seen me

2701
04:22:22,180 --> 04:22:24,180
Have we got

2702
04:22:26,580 --> 04:22:30,020
You've not done a boss fight yet. I do have a separate boss list, okay

2703
04:22:30,820 --> 04:22:35,540
Nah, do healer to sit on her. It's all when he does his siphon

2704
04:22:36,420 --> 04:22:40,980
NIHIL can be avoided using a specific visit

2705
04:22:41,620 --> 04:22:46,020
I don't have it. Wait, are you president nixon on and all it can be honest

2706
04:22:46,100 --> 04:22:48,100
Be honest

2707
04:22:49,300 --> 04:22:54,900
Crouch if you're president nixon be honest, you know, no, well, well, no, you're just doing that because I did that

2708
04:22:55,700 --> 04:23:02,900
Uh, are we doing the pre-retual of the clam slam or what's you want pre-retual clam slam or are you guys ready to go for the fight?

2709
04:23:03,540 --> 04:23:08,500
It's up to you as refland you can pick. Oh, is that cowering for the slam? Do you not have lie down?

2710
04:23:09,060 --> 04:23:11,060
Oh, it does make you lie down. Okay

2711
04:23:11,620 --> 04:23:13,620
Clam slam

2712
04:23:16,980 --> 04:23:19,460
Boom. Do you have clam slam? Do you want clam slam time?

2713
04:23:20,660 --> 04:23:24,020
No clam slam for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're covered take it off

2714
04:23:24,980 --> 04:23:29,300
Let's go. Okay. We're ready for battle. We have done our pre battle battling

2715
04:23:31,300 --> 04:23:34,500
You do not need to visit. Holy shit. Is that male gear reference?

2716
04:23:36,260 --> 04:23:40,900
Okay, ready steady. I'm gonna commentate again

2717
04:23:41,060 --> 04:23:43,060
And

2718
04:23:43,620 --> 04:23:46,820
The two reflinks enter the battle dome

2719
04:23:47,700 --> 04:23:52,980
To defeat the boss something we have none other than the famous actor

2720
04:23:53,700 --> 04:24:00,180
Bersy me and Kagoro hits with the fucking moonbeam for over

2721
04:24:01,460 --> 04:24:03,140
Whoa

2722
04:24:03,140 --> 04:24:10,260
For over half damage 50% on lord of blood mog already. We are mogging him off

2723
04:24:10,980 --> 04:24:17,220
These two reflinks complementing each other one for magic on the debuffs the second for the meleys

2724
04:24:17,620 --> 04:24:19,940
Hit him down to almost

2725
04:24:20,740 --> 04:24:22,740
one four

2726
04:24:22,740 --> 04:24:24,740
Prepare yourselves reflings

2727
04:24:26,100 --> 04:24:29,700
Prepare for heels reflings prepare for heels

2728
04:24:31,220 --> 04:24:35,940
Prepare for heels the heels have been prepared the guards have been rang

2729
04:24:36,420 --> 04:24:42,740
I am out of freaking heels. So I hope he doesn't do that again. Uh, or I'm in trouble even though I'm not even fighting

2730
04:24:44,340 --> 04:24:48,260
Okay, he's got his wings out. He's in his second phase. I assume

2731
04:24:49,380 --> 04:24:51,860
We've got a few more moon attacks from Ranny

2732
04:24:52,900 --> 04:24:55,780
Magic refling did go down a wee bit

2733
04:24:56,660 --> 04:25:02,500
But he's okay. Melee refling going in for some of the kill. Unfortunately does get hit a little bit on the side

2734
04:25:03,380 --> 04:25:08,980
Uh, oh melee refling getting cornered not good for the aggro has been taken by magic refling

2735
04:25:10,820 --> 04:25:15,780
But uh magic refling now taking the aggro meleys getting in position again

2736
04:25:17,620 --> 04:25:21,220
Melee refling is down. I repeat melee refling is down

2737
04:25:21,860 --> 04:25:27,300
Magic refling his own one hp. I want to interfere. I want to interfere. I must interfere

2738
04:25:27,700 --> 04:25:34,580
Magic refling probabilities. I'm a heels and cannot do anything. Oh shits on me. I surely I can do it. Surely I have to get enough

2739
04:25:35,300 --> 04:25:37,300
Now he's like walking away

2740
04:25:41,220 --> 04:25:44,820
He's like slowly walking away out of my tank

2741
04:25:46,180 --> 04:25:49,780
Grab your runes. It's okay. It's okay. We have plenty

2742
04:25:51,460 --> 04:25:57,140
It's okay. Literally he slowly walked to the side and I couldn't help

2743
04:25:58,260 --> 04:26:01,780
I'm nothing but air. Look how long my sword is

2744
04:26:02,660 --> 04:26:06,820
I'm gonna go get a quick can of cola. Okay reflings. I'll be just a millisecond

2745
04:26:28,260 --> 04:26:30,660
This is my little foot feeling dry

2746
04:26:31,780 --> 04:26:35,300
Okay refling. Let's see who's ready to take the test

2747
04:26:35,940 --> 04:26:40,100
You have not gone against the ultimate enemy and you come

2748
04:26:41,220 --> 04:26:42,340
Uh

2749
04:26:42,340 --> 04:26:50,340
Slade you did actually take a whack at him. Just a fella has not taken a whack at our beloved god lord of blood

2750
04:26:51,380 --> 04:26:53,380
You have not taken a whack at him

2751
04:26:54,100 --> 04:26:55,700
Okay

2752
04:26:55,700 --> 04:26:59,700
I like it mog is mid difficulty people just have reduced damage

2753
04:27:00,020 --> 04:27:04,900
Yes, if you didn't know when you joined me as a refling as an aide if you will

2754
04:27:05,460 --> 04:27:13,140
Um, your stats are reduced and so is your damage because it's so you don't make me the game too easy for me

2755
04:27:14,820 --> 04:27:18,260
Oh, are we doing clam slam ritual? Okay. Okay. Let's get it out. Let's get it out

2756
04:27:18,820 --> 04:27:22,900
Actually, I could probably just keep the sword out. Do you both want to line up before we do two and one?

2757
04:27:23,540 --> 04:27:25,540
Or do you want separate you're allowed to get separate?

2758
04:27:28,420 --> 04:27:30,420
I'll see you have the pose

2759
04:27:33,220 --> 04:27:36,100
Okay pre ritual done. Let me get my weapon tree out

2760
04:27:37,780 --> 04:27:43,620
Okay, ladies and gentlemen can our reflings do it. We appear to have two

2761
04:27:44,260 --> 04:27:51,060
Maly reflings ready to take on mog the lord of blood as they both enter the arena

2762
04:27:51,380 --> 04:27:58,980
Using stamina to get closer. Who's going to take the aggro first? Oh, we've got oh, we have a magical sway

2763
04:28:00,180 --> 04:28:01,860
looks can be

2764
04:28:01,860 --> 04:28:03,860
this evening because

2765
04:28:04,420 --> 04:28:06,020
I were mainly

2766
04:28:06,020 --> 04:28:12,260
Refling as no one said I can't join in for this because I beat him for dlc yesterday

2767
04:28:12,260 --> 04:28:14,660
And I killed him before he could do his meal

2768
04:28:15,380 --> 04:28:16,580
Neat

2769
04:28:16,580 --> 04:28:19,540
Thank you so much for the five. Oh, we're gone

2770
04:28:20,580 --> 04:28:22,980
Yes, unfortunately, it is pc only both

2771
04:28:23,700 --> 04:28:25,220
melee

2772
04:28:25,220 --> 04:28:30,740
Very close combat. Oh, it's magical melee. That's it. This refling's participating in

2773
04:28:31,300 --> 04:28:34,020
If I can see correctly from the corner of my eye

2774
04:28:35,540 --> 04:28:37,540
We do oh, okay

2775
04:28:37,940 --> 04:28:41,700
Stone male stone refling is getting a little bit hit, but that's okay

2776
04:28:42,100 --> 04:28:46,340
His shield is helping him armored out the wazoo we hope

2777
04:28:46,900 --> 04:28:54,500
We are already on 60 health on more the lord of blood. These reflings are definitely making a

2778
04:28:55,140 --> 04:28:57,140
short work of this lord

2779
04:28:57,940 --> 04:28:59,460
maybe

2780
04:28:59,460 --> 04:29:06,500
Short range melee is the way, but we do have a physics level up there if I if I'm not a physics class usage

2781
04:29:07,460 --> 04:29:11,460
It prepared to heal prepared to heal you can do it

2782
04:29:19,220 --> 04:29:23,140
Okay, we do have a moon room moon long uh being used

2783
04:29:24,980 --> 04:29:27,860
We're looking good. We're both all of us are high health

2784
04:29:27,940 --> 04:29:35,620
Oh, we took out a beating on his health bar 17 took a bit of tick damage as we're for 44 is able to heal up

2785
04:29:36,180 --> 04:29:39,700
But worry not he is going straight back into the fight again

2786
04:29:39,700 --> 04:29:43,700
I am actually out of range for the second refling that is how far back I am hiding

2787
04:29:44,500 --> 04:29:46,500
They are fighting him at the stairs

2788
04:29:47,780 --> 04:29:56,180
Thai lord receiving over 90 percent damage. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. We are able to heal. We might be at max heals

2789
04:29:56,740 --> 04:29:58,740
We're not sure

2790
04:29:59,540 --> 04:30:01,300
Oh dear

2791
04:30:01,300 --> 04:30:03,300
Oh dear

2792
04:30:03,780 --> 04:30:06,740
Oh dear, is it all falling apart me friends?

2793
04:30:07,860 --> 04:30:09,860
Doesn't matter

2794
04:30:12,020 --> 04:30:17,860
I don't have heels. I don't have heels. I don't have heels. He's he tricked me. He tricked me

2795
04:30:18,420 --> 04:30:23,220
I don't have heels. I don't have any more heels. He tricked me. I'm empty

2796
04:30:24,180 --> 04:30:28,900
He freaking came for me. Okay. I'm hiding up at the egg. Don't bring him to the egg. Okay

2797
04:30:29,620 --> 04:30:31,620
Stay down there

2798
04:30:31,780 --> 04:30:33,780
Stay down here

2799
04:30:34,180 --> 04:30:37,940
Oh, no, Thai lord is kind of low. I think he's out of heels

2800
04:30:38,260 --> 04:30:43,780
One refling is there and it's now rests on the shoulders of melee magic refling

2801
04:30:44,020 --> 04:30:48,500
Where it looks can be this evening. He takes 50 percent damage from the boss

2802
04:30:49,780 --> 04:30:56,820
He does manage to heal up. Oh, but he takes another 60 percent damage of phil health bar. It rains blood and it captures

2803
04:30:56,820 --> 04:30:58,820
No

2804
04:30:59,460 --> 04:31:05,780
I can do it. I can do it. I'm so brave. I'm so brave and magical

2805
04:31:06,900 --> 04:31:08,900
I am not afraid

2806
04:31:09,780 --> 04:31:15,700
I know the boss's mechanics. I do not he's gonna do it. It's like, okay. I'm not even getting a bit

2807
04:31:16,100 --> 04:31:21,060
I'm burning alive. I literally I'm not gonna get okay. I got a hit. I got 127 damage

2808
04:31:22,740 --> 04:31:24,740
127 damage

2809
04:31:24,980 --> 04:31:26,020
Yay

2810
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:28,020
I tried my best

2811
04:31:28,020 --> 04:31:31,780
I have absolutely no idea what his freaking hit registration is or anything

2812
04:31:33,380 --> 04:31:37,620
I tried to scarlet rot cheese but it didn't do enough. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're gonna keep at it

2813
04:31:38,180 --> 04:31:41,060
I'll give it a couple of more attempts and if it really is too much

2814
04:31:41,220 --> 04:31:47,300
What we'll do is get some flasks for me and some golden seat because we are kind of skipping

2815
04:31:47,700 --> 04:31:51,300
Salad you did have you had a shot at this?

2816
04:31:51,940 --> 04:31:57,060
Weeb hasn't had a shot at this. Sorry. I'm like literally just renaming you guys

2817
04:31:58,100 --> 04:32:00,100
Uh, do I recognize

2818
04:32:02,100 --> 04:32:05,300
You have two you have a clobber and a long

2819
04:32:07,620 --> 04:32:11,860
Why won't it let me interact with your sign and won't let me interact with you

2820
04:32:12,820 --> 04:32:20,500
I'm teabagging you. It's not doing anything. I have buckham salad. I'm so sorry. My brain registers you as salad

2821
04:32:20,500 --> 04:32:27,700
Also smithing so and strong his weapon needs upgraded should be hitting way more than a hundred. Okay

2822
04:32:28,260 --> 04:32:35,300
Okay, we're gonna clap mogs cheeks and then we'll maybe do a bit of cheeky. Wow. I cannot interact with anyone right now

2823
04:32:38,020 --> 04:32:40,020
Weep weep your internet is

2824
04:32:40,660 --> 04:32:44,260
Is having a hard time connecting. I think you're about to time out not gonna lie

2825
04:32:44,500 --> 04:32:50,900
All right, hold on everyone take a sip of water, please or a sip of some sort of liquid. Oh, no, you couldn't connect

2826
04:32:52,340 --> 04:32:55,220
Right, who was it? Oh, no, you've moved wait

2827
04:32:57,140 --> 04:32:59,140
Drag you've not had a wallet

2828
04:32:59,700 --> 04:33:01,700
At this king at this king at the sword

2829
04:33:02,660 --> 04:33:04,660
Can you come in?

2830
04:33:04,900 --> 04:33:06,900
Good everyone's like not coming in

2831
04:33:07,940 --> 04:33:09,940
Have you had a work at the boss?

2832
04:33:10,500 --> 04:33:14,740
You haven't you actually haven't had a work at the boss

2833
04:33:16,180 --> 04:33:20,900
Okay, our two reeflings have got they've been decided. We've got some sort of long

2834
04:33:21,700 --> 04:33:23,700
two-handed spear

2835
04:33:24,100 --> 04:33:26,820
Hi, are you ready to kill the boss?

2836
04:33:28,740 --> 04:33:30,740
Oh, thank you

2837
04:33:31,300 --> 04:33:36,660
Little reeflings risen me. Oh, he's giving me compliments before I take his boy cherry

2838
04:33:37,380 --> 04:33:42,580
Are you are you okay? Are you ready for me to take your boy cherry?

2839
04:33:45,060 --> 04:33:48,740
There we go already for war. That's what we like to see

2840
04:33:49,780 --> 04:33:52,900
Ready for battle. So we have uh melee

2841
04:33:54,340 --> 04:33:59,220
Let's get to it. This reeflings ready to go. He does not care. He does not care about the well

2842
04:33:59,220 --> 04:34:01,220
He does care because he did get pre-ritual

2843
04:34:01,780 --> 04:34:05,620
We do appear to have two melee reeflings again, which is perfectly fine

2844
04:34:05,620 --> 04:34:11,140
We're gonna see how they complement one another and their strategies against none other than the lord of blood

2845
04:34:11,220 --> 04:34:13,460
I'm gonna hydrate because keep saying I'm gonna hydrate and then I don't

2846
04:34:15,540 --> 04:34:17,540
Okay, here we go

2847
04:34:19,860 --> 04:34:26,180
Okay a bit rusty a bit rusty we have received a 30 percent health damage on one reefling a bit rusty stone reefling

2848
04:34:26,180 --> 04:34:27,940
Let's see because you got stone shield

2849
04:34:27,940 --> 04:34:33,780
Oh, we have a bit of sorcery a bit of sorcery looks can be this evening

2850
04:34:35,060 --> 04:34:40,260
Again magic being used not fill melee classes. Perhaps mistaken

2851
04:34:41,700 --> 04:34:45,300
Perhaps mistaken again close range reeflings

2852
04:34:46,580 --> 04:34:50,340
Taking on one another. We do have a 50 percent hit on drake

2853
04:34:51,060 --> 04:34:55,300
But we don't want him going down. He does have a physics class get active. I'm not sure what the boon

2854
04:34:55,860 --> 04:35:00,820
The bonus is but he does have it active because he looks like a little bubble right now. Oh, no

2855
04:35:01,780 --> 04:35:03,780
Ambron goes down to

2856
04:35:03,860 --> 04:35:07,940
10% does manage to heal up with two health flasks. However

2857
04:35:09,460 --> 04:35:15,140
Unaware we will need to prepare for healing at the blood loss section

2858
04:35:17,700 --> 04:35:23,220
We'll need to prepare oh again lower than 50% on our

2859
04:35:24,180 --> 04:35:26,180
On that

2860
04:35:26,180 --> 04:35:29,540
Oh, you're a stone reefling. I got I got a few years. I got a mess up

2861
04:35:31,140 --> 04:35:33,140
Maybe we need a magic in it

2862
04:35:35,140 --> 04:35:37,140
We're gonna do this

2863
04:35:37,140 --> 04:35:42,420
We're getting a few wax in here in there. We're doing tick damage. We've got 2000 4000

2864
04:35:43,140 --> 04:35:45,140
5.4

2865
04:35:46,100 --> 04:35:50,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa reeflings working overtime with their magic

2866
04:35:50,260 --> 04:35:52,900
Do you love reeflings don't die on me now?

2867
04:35:55,060 --> 04:35:57,860
Okay, we did manage to avoid the annihilation

2868
04:35:58,580 --> 04:36:00,420
attack

2869
04:36:00,420 --> 04:36:07,380
We are back to 50 health on the main boss. We are getting a few tallywax in but we are taking tick damage from the

2870
04:36:07,780 --> 04:36:08,900
floor

2871
04:36:08,900 --> 04:36:15,780
We are at 20 on one reefling. He does manage to dodge until he gets taken. It is now up to drake

2872
04:36:16,340 --> 04:36:22,100
Can he one man this boss is the question we do not know

2873
04:36:22,980 --> 04:36:26,180
How many restorative potions there may be

2874
04:36:28,180 --> 04:36:30,180
We are doing

2875
04:36:32,500 --> 04:36:38,980
Don't worry reeflings. I'll come in clutch. I'll come in clutch. I'm surely I'll come in clutch

2876
04:36:39,300 --> 04:36:41,300
Wow

2877
04:36:41,860 --> 04:36:46,340
199 damage. That's the most damage I've done against some. Yay

2878
04:36:47,780 --> 04:36:51,380
I beat my record. My damage is the 350

2879
04:36:51,940 --> 04:36:55,300
nine damage total against the boss. Let's go

2880
04:36:58,420 --> 04:37:01,140
In strontis army no reefling dies a virgin

2881
04:37:03,060 --> 04:37:07,860
Honestly, I mean I can like I'll take one for the team

2882
04:37:07,940 --> 04:37:10,740
Is it even taken one for the team if everyone enjoys it?

2883
04:37:12,100 --> 04:37:18,020
Hmm, can't send you off on your own like that. Uh gaav is not taking a cheeky stab

2884
04:37:19,620 --> 04:37:21,620
At this boss

2885
04:37:22,260 --> 04:37:24,260
Uh and who else? Uh

2886
04:37:26,820 --> 04:37:32,340
Sean has not taken a stab at this boss. My boss list is getting very full

2887
04:37:32,340 --> 04:37:34,340
I don't know

2888
04:37:35,860 --> 04:37:39,700
Look we got it. Oh, we've got a blood build samurai blood build

2889
04:37:40,660 --> 04:37:46,900
Oh, we're doing the pre ritual of coming of I cannot send a reefling into war without uh, no weapon leveling

2890
04:37:47,140 --> 04:37:49,140
Uh, we will soon tm

2891
04:37:49,140 --> 04:37:53,940
Oh, we we have fisticuffs. You're gonna defeat the the blood of

04:37:54,740 --> 04:37:58,260
With fisticuffs. No, you can okay ready

2893
04:37:59,220 --> 04:38:03,940
Close your close your eyes reefling. You're gonna enjoy what comes next

2894
04:38:08,020 --> 04:38:10,020
You did it

2895
04:38:11,300 --> 04:38:13,300
Ariya's ready

2896
04:38:13,300 --> 04:38:14,820
Ariya's

2897
04:38:14,820 --> 04:38:16,820
What is this?

2898
04:38:17,060 --> 04:38:22,580
You're gonna beat them up with your gloves. I don't think I've ever seen gloves used before

2899
04:38:23,540 --> 04:38:24,980
Okay

2900
04:38:24,980 --> 04:38:27,140
Okay, let's see what happens reeflin

2901
04:38:29,220 --> 04:38:31,220
Okay, they're coming in

2902
04:38:31,780 --> 04:38:38,420
We do have magical boxing gloves in play. Um, not sure how that's gonna go

2903
04:38:39,940 --> 04:38:46,580
We are both melee again close combat with the reeflings. We do have a physics class active on gaav reeflings

2904
04:38:46,980 --> 04:38:53,460
Oh, no, we have two both of them have physics activated. We're down to 50 health on a big old swing

2905
04:38:53,620 --> 04:38:58,580
We are full health again. Thankfully, uh commentator is gonna run to the egg. So don't worry

2906
04:38:59,140 --> 04:39:03,380
Don't worry commentator is running to the egg. I repeat commentator to the egg

2907
04:39:04,900 --> 04:39:07,060
Okay, we are getting walloped a bit

2908
04:39:07,220 --> 04:39:10,260
We are getting very close gaav is cutting it close with the health

2909
04:39:10,260 --> 04:39:14,180
But art is able to restore health overall. Do you need to make sure we have physics?

2910
04:39:14,900 --> 04:39:22,100
health flasks in preparation for our uno dose trace blood n i l i h annihilation

2911
04:39:23,460 --> 04:39:25,460
On the second we do need to prepare

2912
04:39:26,500 --> 04:39:28,500
But the reeflings are getting some swings in

2913
04:39:29,460 --> 04:39:35,940
The damage is down to 60 on the boss health. I think a little hydration

2914
04:39:38,500 --> 04:39:40,500
We do have a dose

2915
04:39:41,140 --> 04:39:48,580
We are mailing it the out the wazoo. Oh, we are getting pummeled though, but we do we do seem to heal

2916
04:39:50,180 --> 04:39:52,180
We're making it rain blood

2917
04:39:52,420 --> 04:39:56,660
Um, but it is not ketchup season for this streamer

2918
04:39:58,580 --> 04:40:04,980
We do have full health on both reeflings. They are taking tick damage. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Get ready

2919
04:40:06,580 --> 04:40:08,820
Oh wait, we have three rings. Is that the one he does it?

2920
04:40:09,620 --> 04:40:14,820
Okay. Okay. We're ready. We're prepared. We know how to drink. We're good boys and girls out here

2921
04:40:14,820 --> 04:40:20,580
We know how to drink drink drink drink chug chug chug, but don't get steaming because I don't think it's a weekend yet

2922
04:40:20,820 --> 04:40:26,500
We we are full health for both reeflings. We are in phase two with full health

2923
04:40:26,660 --> 04:40:32,020
Scab does take a cheeky 50. However, can recover possibly unless out of flasks

2924
04:40:32,340 --> 04:40:37,220
Yeah, wow, both reeflings melee second phase full damage physics up

2925
04:40:37,940 --> 04:40:45,220
Hold on. Is this the run is? Oh, I spoke too soon. I spoke too soon. No, don't leave me with a boss

2926
04:40:46,180 --> 04:40:48,180
Don't leave me with a boss

2927
04:40:48,420 --> 04:40:53,140
We are down a reef like oh, we're down a second reef like

2928
04:40:53,860 --> 04:40:59,300
No, okay. It's okay. It's okay. Right. He's gonna do one big old thrust at me

2929
04:41:00,260 --> 04:41:04,740
Or well, I'm not gonna be able to do it. But it's fine. It's fine

2930
04:41:05,380 --> 04:41:09,700
So, can you know scarlet brought cheese this man cheat reeflings cheese man right now?

2931
04:41:10,420 --> 04:41:15,300
Oh, I hit for 407. I hit for 500. Let's go

2932
04:41:15,940 --> 04:41:20,180
I'll take it. I'll take it. That was a new record. That was like 600 plus

2933
04:41:20,980 --> 04:41:23,540
Oh my god, I have a new high score against him

2934
04:41:24,980 --> 04:41:28,820
You cursed it. You cursed it. Okay. I won't I won't say anything then I made just

2935
04:41:29,540 --> 04:41:32,740
Uh, you can scarlet wrote cheese him. I just did it badly. Oh

2936
04:41:33,620 --> 04:41:35,700
That's okay. We have a few more attempts. Do we know?

2937
04:41:37,860 --> 04:41:41,460
I process like three frostbites. Yeah

2938
04:41:41,940 --> 04:41:43,780
It's 20. It's sundae

2939
04:41:43,780 --> 04:41:48,100
Wait, are you allowed to get junk on sundae if you have work on monday? I thought friday

2940
04:41:48,820 --> 04:41:52,900
Um, we have aqua the wise and you come we have a mage

2941
04:41:54,180 --> 04:41:56,180
Interesting interesting interesting

2942
04:41:58,020 --> 04:42:03,140
Um, and then we have throngler. Have you had a chance at this lovely boss?

2943
04:42:03,140 --> 04:42:06,660
You have not had a chance at the boss boss yet and you come for rongler

2944
04:42:06,660 --> 04:42:13,220
We have a clear we have jewel wield mage runny

2945
04:42:14,580 --> 04:42:20,580
And oh, we've got a little pirouette. Oh nice to meet you. How elegant are you?

2946
04:42:22,660 --> 04:42:25,060
And then we have second refling that's loading in right now

2947
04:42:26,020 --> 04:42:28,180
Oh, we have even a polite little bow

2948
04:42:28,980 --> 04:42:34,660
And then we have throngler the jewel wield melee. Okay. We're gonna see how magic and melee complement each other

2949
04:42:34,900 --> 04:42:39,380
Oh, you don't need to pray to me. I assure you I will bless you with everything you need in a second

2950
04:42:47,700 --> 04:42:54,900
Okay, let's see if our reflings can complement one another with two different strategies one with magic

2951
04:42:55,300 --> 04:43:01,700
One with jewel wield melee. Let's see how it goes. I've got 13 minutes left of saturday. That'll do that'll do

2952
04:43:02,420 --> 04:43:04,420
Okay

2953
04:43:04,660 --> 04:43:08,500
Reflings have entered the battle dome magic is taking

2954
04:43:09,460 --> 04:43:14,020
Some elements. We're doing the moon beam runny approach

2955
04:43:14,900 --> 04:43:16,900
melee

2956
04:43:17,140 --> 04:43:23,620
Oh, we are getting sprayed down for a nasty hit. We are locked on to mage until melee refling takes

2957
04:43:24,500 --> 04:43:26,340
The aggro sort

2958
04:43:26,340 --> 04:43:28,020
I'm gonna move to the egg

2959
04:43:28,020 --> 04:43:31,220
But just keep fighting you guys are doing great. Just keep it up speed. You're doing great

2960
04:43:32,420 --> 04:43:34,420
Uh, we do have

2961
04:43:34,500 --> 04:43:38,100
Okay, okay. Well, there's not gonna give me anything is it? No, I didn't have anything. Okay

2962
04:43:39,300 --> 04:43:42,420
We do have are they complementing each other?

2963
04:43:42,740 --> 04:43:46,020
Can the melee refling keep aggro so the mage

2964
04:43:46,580 --> 04:43:52,100
Refling can keep it up and just keep blasting and doing that tick damage is the question

2965
04:43:52,420 --> 04:43:57,220
We are on the second ring of the aoe n i l m n o p attack

2966
04:43:57,940 --> 04:43:59,780
um

2967
04:43:59,780 --> 04:44:04,740
So we do have to mentally prepare for what comes next. We are doing tick damage over time

2968
04:44:04,820 --> 04:44:08,180
We are already close to 50 damage of the boss

2969
04:44:09,300 --> 04:44:15,700
Is melee magic the way to complement one another? Reflings? We will find out that strategy live

2970
04:44:16,260 --> 04:44:18,260
We do have a

2971
04:44:21,460 --> 04:44:26,260
I may have just killed us, but don't worry. I may have just killed us

2972
04:44:26,500 --> 04:44:29,700
I may have just killed us because I don't have enough class

2973
04:44:31,300 --> 04:44:38,980
Okay, no, it's fine. It's fine. Oh our mage refling is down is up to melee refling that has all of the aggro at the moment

2974
04:44:38,980 --> 04:44:46,020
He is debuffed because he is helping me in my game. He does take a dodge for the aoe

2975
04:44:46,980 --> 04:44:51,220
Oh the area of effect of these flames that are left over is just

2976
04:44:51,380 --> 04:44:59,140
Overwhelming the power the power of the lord of blood is a bit too much, but that's okay. We're trying our best

2977
04:44:59,860 --> 04:45:01,860
Take it

2978
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:04,340
Okay, I'm out stamina. Well, I tried

2979
04:45:06,180 --> 04:45:08,180
Completely out of stamina. There we go

2980
04:45:11,060 --> 04:45:14,660
Okay, not bad not bad it was interesting

2981
04:45:16,180 --> 04:45:20,500
This is gonna hurt very that was interesting. I think maybe

2982
04:45:21,220 --> 04:45:27,140
A magic and a melee might be most complementary because if the melee takes the fill aggro

2983
04:45:28,180 --> 04:45:31,780
In theory should I be doing magic right now?

2984
04:45:33,060 --> 04:45:35,220
Oops, sorry wrong one. Okay, let's go again

2985
04:45:41,060 --> 04:45:47,460
Okay, who have we got um, I don't recognize you Ezra income

2986
04:45:49,140 --> 04:45:51,140
Ezra income

2987
04:45:51,860 --> 04:45:54,820
And we did just how are you already in there?

2988
04:45:55,780 --> 04:46:02,820
Uh thigh lord, we did have you have an attempt. I'm just gonna check. There's no one here that hasn't had an attempt yet

2989
04:46:03,780 --> 04:46:05,780
a

2990
04:46:06,260 --> 04:46:11,940
Rivers you've not had an attempt just far as that my eye can see no and you come

2991
04:46:13,940 --> 04:46:16,180
Wait, yeah, no I haven't I haven't actually

2992
04:46:17,140 --> 04:46:23,700
Hello, wait, we must do our pre ritual. Maybe I should just keep this out to be honest. Maybe I just keep it out

2993
04:46:27,220 --> 04:46:33,940
Okay, are you ready get blessed get blessed get blessed and then now it's your turn for the blessing

2994
04:46:36,020 --> 04:46:39,860
That's right. You better say you're getting blessed get blessed get blessed get blessed

2995
04:46:41,300 --> 04:46:43,300
Okay pre-war ritual complete

2996
04:46:43,940 --> 04:46:45,940
let's go

2997
04:46:45,940 --> 04:46:49,060
I'll just leave I'll leave the sword on there's no way I'm finishing the boss off

2998
04:46:49,860 --> 04:46:51,860
we appear to have

2999
04:46:51,860 --> 04:46:53,620
a

3000
04:46:53,620 --> 04:46:57,460
Shield and sword reefling and then a two-handed reefling

3001
04:46:58,100 --> 04:47:01,140
No, we I see some magic stuff going on hold on

3002
04:47:02,500 --> 04:47:07,700
Uh my small brain cannot comprehend that if you look like melee

3003
04:47:08,740 --> 04:47:13,700
That they might have some magic spells up. Uh, there is a gray bar on the H

3004
04:47:16,180 --> 04:47:21,300
Uh, there is a gray bar on the enemy already not sure what that means

3005
04:47:21,700 --> 04:47:24,820
But is that going to stop the reeflings? Absolutely not

3006
04:47:25,700 --> 04:47:27,700
Uh, we do have a pressure

3007
04:47:28,100 --> 04:47:32,980
Downfall magic that holds an enemy in place momentarily

3008
04:47:33,780 --> 04:47:39,300
Curious we are at 50 hell max hp reduction. Wow

3009
04:47:40,980 --> 04:47:45,220
That must come at a pretty price a pretty price of mana indeed

3010
04:47:46,900 --> 04:47:49,700
Well, the reeflings are going for it. We're raining blood

3011
04:47:49,780 --> 04:47:54,180
But it's not enough to hurt the reeflings extra careful extra cautious

3012
04:47:54,500 --> 04:48:00,660
Hardly any damage done to the reeflings at all and yet lord of blood is down on his luck

3013
04:48:00,740 --> 04:48:03,940
He is below 50. He is doing now

3014
04:48:04,660 --> 04:48:08,500
To try his best to get any smidgen back

3015
04:48:09,060 --> 04:48:12,340
But he does not understand as just as

3016
04:48:12,900 --> 04:48:19,060
Strongies stamina is unending. So is the reeflings for they have the fortitude

3017
04:48:19,380 --> 04:48:21,940
They have the insight one reefling does go down

3018
04:48:22,660 --> 04:48:25,700
We are remaining on our two-handed reefling

3019
04:48:26,740 --> 04:48:27,940
shit

3020
04:48:27,940 --> 04:48:29,140
Not good

3021
04:48:29,140 --> 04:48:31,140
Maybe joining the fight

3022
04:48:31,780 --> 04:48:33,780
I can't i'm out of hp

3023
04:48:34,260 --> 04:48:40,580
Can it's on your reeflings. He does get a few blood strikes in the enemy is very low. I'm tempted

3024
04:48:41,140 --> 04:48:47,060
I'm very tempted to swap to the the second grace or just in case all I have to do all I have to do is the tiddly wing

3025
04:48:47,380 --> 04:48:50,020
Don't fuck it up. Just a tiddly wing

3026
04:48:51,460 --> 04:48:56,740
Just a tiddly wing just a tiddly wing just a tiddly wing come here come here right now

3027
04:48:56,980 --> 04:49:02,580
It's I literally have to tickle his ballsack. Please. Please. Please. Let me just run and jump

3028
04:49:03,380 --> 04:49:08,740
Please the reeflings the reeflings have turned so hard. Please. Please. Please

3029
04:49:09,060 --> 04:49:11,060
Oh

3030
04:49:11,300 --> 04:49:17,060
Please. Please. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. She throws

3031
04:49:23,380 --> 04:49:26,420
She throws one hp

3032
04:49:27,780 --> 04:49:29,780
One hp

3033
04:49:30,340 --> 04:49:32,340
One hp she throws

3034
04:49:33,540 --> 04:49:35,540
Oh my god

3035
04:49:36,020 --> 04:49:42,660
Oh my god, what what a duel those two reeflings were truly complemented one another

3036
04:49:44,020 --> 04:49:51,780
Uh, if we've not had you coming into the boss reeflings outstanding effort. I'm just going to check uh high

3037
04:49:53,140 --> 04:49:55,620
Pre-stess you have not had a whack at the boss

3038
04:49:56,660 --> 04:49:59,300
He uh, if an high pre-stess and you come

3039
04:50:00,260 --> 04:50:05,620
Fantastic effort. It was a tiddly wing. I do apologize for messing that up

3040
04:50:06,020 --> 04:50:11,460
But at the end of the day, we're here for a fantastic time. That was very well played

3041
04:50:11,780 --> 04:50:18,660
All reeflings very well played against this boss just as a reminder when someone comes into your world to help you out

3042
04:50:19,220 --> 04:50:22,980
One little ceremony done. What about your ceremony? Hmm?

3043
04:50:24,020 --> 04:50:28,500
Did you think I forgot to ceremony you do you not have lie down? You don't want it?

3044
04:50:30,100 --> 04:50:33,060
I'm afraid it's not optional. You will take what you get

3045
04:50:35,620 --> 04:50:37,620
You have been ceremony eyes

3046
04:50:39,380 --> 04:50:44,580
Uh, yes, all reeflings are helping. Please don't ever feel bad if you mess up or have a little mistake

3047
04:50:45,220 --> 04:50:48,020
You should use a blessing to get your hp back

3048
04:50:49,060 --> 04:50:51,060
Maybe maybe I should

3049
04:50:52,020 --> 04:50:57,940
Now let's see we have a magic sword and play by another and high pre-stess which makes exact sense

3050
04:50:58,020 --> 04:51:02,740
Considering the name oof is going for the close combat already picks up the aggro from

3051
04:51:03,460 --> 04:51:04,820
Mog

3052
04:51:04,820 --> 04:51:08,900
But are is this reefling joe enough to mug mug himself?

3053
04:51:09,780 --> 04:51:14,820
We are taking some serious magic damage on one of the builds of the reeflings

3054
04:51:16,420 --> 04:51:17,780
Oh

3055
04:51:17,780 --> 04:51:23,620
Riffling already down. Uh, it appears oof is timing out question mark

3056
04:51:24,580 --> 04:51:30,580
Uh, reeflings connection has timed out

3057
04:51:31,540 --> 04:51:33,540
Um

3058
04:51:33,940 --> 04:51:35,940
Uh, sure

3059
04:51:36,100 --> 04:51:42,500
Sure, why not? Sure. Why not? Okay. We tried our best with what we had in church. It's fine

3060
04:51:44,100 --> 04:51:46,100
It's fine. We tried what we could

3061
04:51:47,060 --> 04:51:50,020
It's joining after nil you can use the blessing

3062
04:51:56,260 --> 04:52:02,580
Okay, maybe one of the weakest attempts, but it was an attempt nonetheless as long as you get up and keep trying

3063
04:52:02,900 --> 04:52:06,020
What's how does that song go you get knocked down?

3064
04:52:06,340 --> 04:52:08,340
But I get up again

3065
04:52:09,220 --> 04:52:12,260
The per DC let's just like is that reeflings standing on the floor?

3066
04:52:12,820 --> 04:52:15,780
Uh, we do have someone called okay, and you come okay

3067
04:52:17,060 --> 04:52:18,900
We haven't had okay

3068
04:52:18,900 --> 04:52:20,900
Who have we got?

3069
04:52:21,140 --> 04:52:23,860
I think you're patiently waiting to see if there's no one new

3070
04:52:24,580 --> 04:52:25,860
You

3071
04:52:25,860 --> 04:52:27,860
We've got a joe weild on the hip

3072
04:52:28,420 --> 04:52:30,420
No, we've got joe weild in the hands

3073
04:52:32,020 --> 04:52:34,420
HMRC make sure you pay your taxes

3074
04:52:34,500 --> 04:52:41,700
Please hold back 30 of your income to pay taxes to any at any point and please remember to reclaim

3075
04:52:42,660 --> 04:52:45,620
Um anything you can on your taxes do not be embarrassed

3076
04:52:46,180 --> 04:52:50,020
Reminder that billionaire companies do not pay a single penny of tax while you

3077
04:52:50,820 --> 04:52:51,940
do

3078
04:52:51,940 --> 04:52:58,260
So please do not ever feel bad if you want to claim for example if you are a car mechanic you can

3079
04:52:59,140 --> 04:53:04,260
Claim back washing up liquid on your clothes because you need to be presentable for work

3080
04:53:04,820 --> 04:53:10,820
As long as you can justify the cost of your daily living me. Uh, are you guys not lying down? Hello?

3081
04:53:11,700 --> 04:53:14,660
If you don't lie down, I'll make sure it's our word, okay?

3082
04:53:15,620 --> 04:53:17,620
Yeah, that's what I thought you better put. Yeah

3083
04:53:21,940 --> 04:53:23,940
Right you your next

3084
04:53:27,220 --> 04:53:29,220
I fit you just fine

3085
04:53:29,220 --> 04:53:34,500
Yeah, I have to admit it's going to start whistling at the rate. I'm uh doing these rituals, but we're trying our best

3086
04:53:35,220 --> 04:53:37,780
Right. Are you ready reeflings? You have been

3087
04:53:38,820 --> 04:53:40,820
What am I looking? Oh, okay. Sorry

3088
04:53:41,540 --> 04:53:44,340
Right, we have a bleed

3089
04:53:44,900 --> 04:53:48,900
It looks like a bleed build on one reefling and it appears to be

3090
04:53:49,460 --> 04:53:52,580
Okay, we're chugging a lot of flasks. We do have a

3091
04:53:53,780 --> 04:53:58,900
Something going on. I don't this is a lot of stuff going on with that reefland. I have no idea what magic is filling

3092
04:54:00,180 --> 04:54:02,180
A bit strong that's so unfair

3093
04:54:04,740 --> 04:54:08,020
Come on reeflings show mommy what you're worth

3094
04:54:08,980 --> 04:54:14,500
Nah, you you're worth isn't based on the price to be a boss for me in a video game. Please don't worry

3095
04:54:18,020 --> 04:54:20,020
Wow

3096
04:54:20,340 --> 04:54:22,340
Okay

3097
04:54:22,900 --> 04:54:27,300
Okay, sorry my throat's getting a bit sore and I'm like, I need to try and

3098
04:54:28,180 --> 04:54:35,140
Say um, okay raining down on blood. We do have a meaty swack of 50% on hmrc to pay your taxes

3099
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:37,860
Uh, okay standing

3100
04:54:38,340 --> 04:54:41,060
No close close combat melee again

3101
04:54:42,100 --> 04:54:44,820
Hmc struggling with the dodgers a little bit

3102
04:54:45,220 --> 04:54:51,780
Okay gets caught up in an attack that wasn't even targeted on him. Hmc is backing off

3103
04:54:52,260 --> 04:54:54,260
He's trying his best

3104
04:54:55,060 --> 04:54:59,220
Uh, please don't worry about the enemy coming over to me. I do have the health to

3105
04:54:59,780 --> 04:55:06,500
Not get whacked. We are low health. Are we out of healing is the question are we out of healing is the question

3106
04:55:07,300 --> 04:55:11,780
For hmrc. I know you don't have an r in your name for hmc. You are down

3107
04:55:13,780 --> 04:55:21,380
Single reefling called okay left up on the map. We are experiencing blood loss together, but that's okay

3108
04:55:21,860 --> 04:55:23,860
What I pressed x

3109
04:55:25,220 --> 04:55:28,980
I was pressing x sorry. I'm flopped at that

3110
04:55:29,540 --> 04:55:35,780
I was pressing x you can literally hear my finger on the button. I have audio evidence of me hitting x

3111
04:55:36,580 --> 04:55:37,700
brah

3112
04:55:37,700 --> 04:55:38,500
brah

3113
04:55:38,500 --> 04:55:40,500
That's just sabotage the reef looms

3114
04:55:41,540 --> 04:55:44,260
Is that right outrageous my goodness, outrageous

3115
04:55:47,620 --> 04:55:53,700
Wow, okay, uh country pumpkin you've not had to show pumpkin

3116
04:55:55,140 --> 04:55:57,140
um

3117
04:55:57,300 --> 04:55:59,300
Barrette

3118
04:55:59,300 --> 04:56:06,580
Don't recognize you barrette. You've not been in either is country pumpkin and barrette gonna compliment each other

3119
04:56:06,660 --> 04:56:09,860
Let's check out the build. We have heavy armor

3120
04:56:10,580 --> 04:56:12,580
weaponry

3121
04:56:12,660 --> 04:56:14,660
I don't know what these weapons are

3122
04:56:16,420 --> 04:56:18,420
What are you doing?

3123
04:56:18,900 --> 04:56:24,740
You get a parent you and uh, so this this pose is face-sitting if you want face-sitting. Okay

3124
04:56:25,380 --> 04:56:26,740
Hi

3125
04:56:26,740 --> 04:56:28,340
And you are

3126
04:56:28,340 --> 04:56:34,020
Schematar joe wheel. So this is face-sitting if you kneel and if you go in the floor

3127
04:56:34,660 --> 04:56:38,980
It's it's clam slam. And then if you want the butt, it's something else

3128
04:56:39,060 --> 04:56:46,340
But I don't know what it is. You have both been blessed simultaneously due to the a massive circumference that my budget you provide

3129
04:56:46,820 --> 04:56:49,220
Uh, we'll need to think of a pose if you want, uh,

3130
04:56:49,860 --> 04:56:51,860
Veno

3131
04:56:51,940 --> 04:56:55,540
Are the reeflings ready on your mark? I'm gonna see

3132
04:56:56,340 --> 04:57:00,420
Another grip of heroes has fallen messed. Well for your watches in

3133
04:57:04,820 --> 04:57:10,420
Okay, we're good. We're good. Well, we have magic coming out from country pumpkin did not actually

3134
04:57:11,940 --> 04:57:13,140
um

3135
04:57:13,140 --> 04:57:16,420
Both again trying to get nice and close for one another

3136
04:57:17,460 --> 04:57:20,580
Uh having the agile constantly swapping

3137
04:57:22,340 --> 04:57:30,180
Which might be a good thing to give one reefling a break from the other pumpkin does cast we have lower hp on the boss total

3138
04:57:30,820 --> 04:57:34,500
Raining blood not quite getting it but rest down to 50 percent

3139
04:57:34,500 --> 04:57:37,620
However, he is going to be able to get out of the area

3140
04:57:38,020 --> 04:57:44,580
He is rolling around as if he was on fire. Remember folks at home to stop drop roll

3141
04:57:45,860 --> 04:57:50,740
That's the best way to deal with your issues but rest taking on very close combat damage

3142
04:57:51,620 --> 04:57:57,060
Does manage to heal up. We're gonna heal heal. I'm I'm spamming eggs. You can hear it spam

3143
04:57:58,020 --> 04:58:01,780
Here it gets banned in the microphone. I have the controller right up. There we go. Feeling healed

3144
04:58:02,420 --> 04:58:04,420
For the best I can do

3145
04:58:04,820 --> 04:58:11,380
We are doing magic damage. Don't worry about bringing the boss over to me. I can't evade so don't panic

3146
04:58:12,260 --> 04:58:15,300
It's very unlikely the boss will target me at any point

3147
04:58:16,580 --> 04:58:18,580
Words spoken like a true

3148
04:58:19,060 --> 04:58:21,060
Main character

3149
04:58:21,060 --> 04:58:24,500
Pumpkin and bereft going in it again. We are on phase two

3150
04:58:25,860 --> 04:58:30,180
We're looking quite strong face to his very aggressive very hard to

3151
04:58:30,740 --> 04:58:34,020
Harry with the perfect timing of your attacks

3152
04:58:34,980 --> 04:58:41,940
Most common dodges to roll into the enemies. However, due to his aoe fire left over

3153
04:58:42,500 --> 04:58:44,500
This is almost like committing

3154
04:58:44,820 --> 04:58:46,820
slower slide

3155
04:58:47,060 --> 04:58:49,700
So to dodge this enemy it is not easy

3156
04:58:49,780 --> 04:58:57,780
We are down to less than 20 health on the both bereft on the five percent taking tick damage from the aoe fire

3157
04:58:58,180 --> 04:59:00,180
bereft seems to be out of potions

3158
04:59:00,180 --> 04:59:03,780
He is giving it his all no health no health

3159
04:59:04,340 --> 04:59:05,460
pumpkin

3160
04:59:05,460 --> 04:59:12,820
Can he do it can pumpkin finish off the last less than 10 percent health of the lord

3161
04:59:13,700 --> 04:59:15,700
of blood himself

3162
04:59:16,660 --> 04:59:18,660
Pumpkin goes in for a big hit

3163
04:59:19,460 --> 04:59:24,020
Does 500 just shy of 500 again doing some tick damage

3164
04:59:24,340 --> 04:59:31,140
We are less than five percent boss health. Can country bumpkin make it happen less than one percent health?

3165
04:59:32,980 --> 04:59:35,860
Yes, he did it fantastic

3166
04:59:36,820 --> 04:59:41,460
Oh, he flicks it on them. He flicks it on the fantastic jewel

3167
04:59:42,180 --> 04:59:46,420
The reth and pumpkin managed to do it together fantastic

3168
04:59:47,460 --> 04:59:49,460
cooperation between the reeflings

3169
04:59:49,860 --> 04:59:51,060

05:01:28,260 --> 05:01:34,820
Question mark rain is under the weather. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Am I just making up lore for rain? That's not true

3197
05:01:35,460 --> 05:01:39,540

3201

Humbly apologize. Right. We now need to go to Kaleid

3202
05:01:58,100 --> 05:02:01,860
So we actually need to go like all the way to the star

3203
05:02:02,180 --> 05:02:06,020
Honestly take us to the church of ele

3204
05:02:06,820 --> 05:02:08,820
Get the grease did I not get it?

3205
05:02:08,980 --> 05:02:10,980
I didn't get it. Yeah, rest up

3206
05:02:14,900 --> 05:02:19,540
Oh, wow, I can actually level up for once because of how big my leveling up is

3207
05:02:21,620 --> 05:02:25,300
Uh, right strength is already 99 what would I put it in?

3208
05:02:26,740 --> 05:02:31,060
Endurance just to level up my stamina and equipment load I guess

3209
05:02:32,820 --> 05:02:37,620
Uh, I'm actually not sure apparently vigors

3210
05:02:41,940 --> 05:02:46,740
Max is 60 before it starts to like heavily nerf yet. Yes six extra

3211
05:02:47,540 --> 05:02:50,820
HP imagine if that would have made the difference though, you know

3212
05:02:51,780 --> 05:02:55,460
Go to the church and head towards the wonder visit

3213
05:02:57,540 --> 05:03:00,260
Endurance and vigour are both good picks at this point

3214
05:03:00,500 --> 05:03:03,620
And I'll just put it in endurance. Why not?

3215
05:03:04,740 --> 05:03:06,740
Cheeky bit of endurance here

3216
05:03:06,900 --> 05:03:12,500
Okay, go to the church and head towards the wonders physics. Oh, yes. I know exactly what you're talking about refund

3222
05:03:40,900 --> 05:03:46,180
I've played this game once fully before and that was a year ago. Look a few things are not in my head

3223
05:03:47,860 --> 05:03:51,140
Go to the church. What church this church?

Is that crackpot you want me to summon will lead you? Okay. Okay. Okay

3230
05:04:18,820 --> 05:04:27,220
Time to summon the reeflings to help me navigate this game because there's so much content

3231
05:04:27,940 --> 05:04:29,940
Kind of just crazy

3232
05:04:30,580 --> 05:04:34,100
I always see this animal name. I don't reckon. Oh, no. No. No. No. No

But I already know what I want my alternative outfit to be

3262
05:06:57,220 --> 05:06:59,220
Um, however

3263
05:06:59,220 --> 05:07:01,220
Depending on the donor song

3264
05:07:01,620 --> 05:07:07,700
I actually don't mind if you guys want to vote on an all-out that you want to see me and it would come with like complete

um

3266
05:07:08,900 --> 05:07:15,300
I'd probably keep the shape of my hairstyle, but my shells can be exchanged for something of a theme

3267
05:07:16,180 --> 05:07:18,180
um

3268

Right, let's go. Let's welcome boys. Why don't do that?

3272
05:07:47,540 --> 05:07:52,340
Okay, I forgot I need to level up these a little bit, but that's okay. We can do that in the end

3273
05:07:53,060 --> 05:07:56,100
Did we just run past or we just perish on everyone?

3274
05:07:59,540 --> 05:08:03,140
What if it's what the masses well if you guys vote for it then I ain't gonna say no

3275
05:08:04,100 --> 05:08:08,740
I've got plenty of tails, but I can plug in with the uh be uh streaming out here

3276
05:08:11,780 --> 05:08:13,140
Um

3277
05:08:13,140 --> 05:08:15,140
Yeah, if you guys want, I ain't gonna

3278
05:08:15,140 --> 05:08:19,140
Uh, but I would like vote. Why are you just hating in the bushes?

3279
05:08:20,100 --> 05:08:22,100
Is that the boost to do that part?

3280
05:08:24,260 --> 05:08:29,300
Yeah, I'm very open to like an alternative costume that you guys pick just like, you know what you want to see

3281
05:08:29,940 --> 05:08:31,940
Wait, I need to hold this

3282
05:08:35,060 --> 05:08:37,060
Wait

3283
05:08:37,220 --> 05:08:39,220
So then what's that one?

3284
05:08:39,700 --> 05:08:41,700
Okay, and what's that?

3285
05:08:43,060 --> 05:08:45,060
Ah, right combination. Sorry

3286
05:08:45,300 --> 05:08:47,300
Sorry

3287
05:08:47,620 --> 05:08:49,620
Gamer girl outfit

3288
05:08:49,940 --> 05:08:54,580
I mean, I've not got it concepted. Uh, maybe only talk about it if I got a concept

3289
05:08:55,620 --> 05:08:58,420
But I'm definitely gonna stick to like my main

3290
05:08:59,220 --> 05:09:03,140
Like for a lot. I really like the yukata. I'm sorry if anyone

3291
05:09:04,740 --> 05:09:08,340
Uh, I'm sorry if anyone's like, you can't, that's weird. I'm like, plus

3292
05:09:09,300 --> 05:09:15,780
No, no, no. Niveichuber would be here without a little homage to Japan. So I think a yukata makes perfect sense

3293
05:09:17,780 --> 05:09:19,140
Um

3294
05:09:19,140 --> 05:09:20,420
but

3295
05:09:20,420 --> 05:09:25,380
Didn't like it I have to have a bikini only toggle if that's what you're wanting. I mean, yeah

3296
05:09:28,180 --> 05:09:31,860
Are you and all it uh, that's a very alternative outfit indeed

3297
05:09:32,580 --> 05:09:38,040
Wait, if you don't come near. Oh, no, they they always attack. I was gonna say he unsheathed his sword

3298
05:09:38,340 --> 05:09:41,340
I was like, oh, does he not attack if they, like, they hit you?

3299
05:09:42,340 --> 05:09:46,340
You can't, if it's a great though. Yeah, like, I just thought it was a really good thing.

3300
05:09:46,340 --> 05:09:51,340
I definitely gonna develop some of my concept art because there's a few...

3301
05:09:51,340 --> 05:09:56,340
There's a hidden design in one of the con... It's not hidden, but it looked really good

3302
05:09:56,340 --> 05:09:59,340
and I want to see it develop just slightly further.

3303
05:09:59,340 --> 05:10:02,340
I think it's very complementary to the hip-hop theme.

3304
05:10:02,340 --> 05:10:03,340
Um...

3305
05:10:05,340 --> 05:10:07,340
As well.

3306
05:10:07,340 --> 05:10:09,340
So I'd like to see that.

3307
05:10:12,340 --> 05:10:17,340
We are traversing limbry for this. This is getting pretty...

3308
05:10:17,340 --> 05:10:19,340
We adventuring.

3309
05:10:21,340 --> 05:10:23,340
I thought you couldn't draw. I can't.

3310
05:10:23,340 --> 05:10:26,340
We're getting... I get concept art.

3311
05:10:26,340 --> 05:10:28,340
Concept.

3312
05:10:28,340 --> 05:10:30,340
Just a hidden...

3313
05:10:30,340 --> 05:10:32,340
Again?

3314
05:10:33,340 --> 05:10:38,340
Worldwinds, wolves from the sky? I have to admit are probably the weirdest thing.

3315
05:10:39,340 --> 05:10:41,340
Wait, what? Is that an enemy?

3316
05:10:41,340 --> 05:10:43,340
Whoa.

3317
05:10:43,340 --> 05:10:46,340
Is that an NPC?

3318
05:10:46,340 --> 05:10:49,340
Oh my god, I thought that was a rifling dressed up.

3319
05:10:49,340 --> 05:10:52,340
I was like, oh, careful honey, you're hurting me.

3320
05:10:52,340 --> 05:10:55,340
Careful, darling, you didn't mean to swing on me.

3321
05:10:55,340 --> 05:10:58,340
Hypno from Pokemon Sun?

3322
05:10:58,340 --> 05:11:00,340
Okay.

3323
05:11:00,340 --> 05:11:03,340
Ooh, we're at a new place.

3324
05:11:05,340 --> 05:11:07,340
Is this where I'm supposed to be going?

3325
05:11:07,340 --> 05:11:10,340
Whoa, there's literally a growing granada.

3326
05:11:10,340 --> 05:11:12,340
Whoa, there's a rat!

3327
05:11:12,340 --> 05:11:15,340
Is that a rat? No, it's a dog.

3328
05:11:15,340 --> 05:11:19,340
That dog has main cheese with that bit right now.

3329
05:11:20,340 --> 05:11:22,340
Serious?

3330
05:11:22,340 --> 05:11:26,340
I got a short sword. I was supposed to have a long sword.

3331
05:11:28,340 --> 05:11:31,340
Oh jeez, you guys are glittering.

3332
05:11:32,340 --> 05:11:34,340
Fin beast.

3333
05:11:34,340 --> 05:11:37,340
Sorry, but you got two heads in.

3334
05:11:37,340 --> 05:11:41,340
I'm really sorry to say it's because a lot of people put a lot of effort into it,

3335
05:11:41,340 --> 05:11:44,340
but the clothes are almost useless for now.

3336
05:11:44,340 --> 05:11:46,340
Oh yeah, no, definitely.

3337
05:11:46,340 --> 05:11:49,340
I do agree with that sentiment as well.

3338
05:11:49,340 --> 05:11:53,340
You literally only get to see my face and my hair.

3339
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:57,340
Pretty much like 100% of the time.

3340
05:11:57,340 --> 05:11:59,340
I went reeflings.

3341
05:11:59,340 --> 05:12:03,340
When v-tubers do just chanting streams and stuff,

3342
05:12:03,340 --> 05:12:05,340
and they show half their body there,

3343
05:12:05,340 --> 05:12:07,340
I'm like, yeah, no, that makes sense.

3344
05:12:07,340 --> 05:12:09,340
Isn't Alexander up there?

3345
05:12:10,340 --> 05:12:12,340
I know he's up a cliff to the right.

3346
05:12:12,340 --> 05:12:13,340
Up a cliff.

3347
05:12:13,340 --> 05:12:15,340
Did I just say what I think I said?

3348
05:12:15,340 --> 05:12:17,340
Sorry.

3349
05:12:17,340 --> 05:12:19,340
There's so many of you, it's got me overwhelmed.

3350
05:12:19,340 --> 05:12:22,340
Oh, I'm to come up here? Wait, let me clean.

3351
05:12:22,340 --> 05:12:24,340
Are you fighting a dragon or something?

3352
05:12:24,340 --> 05:12:26,340
Why are you fighting on the bridge?

3353
05:12:30,340 --> 05:12:32,340
If you think those doggos are bad,

3354
05:12:32,340 --> 05:12:34,340
you should have seen the Dark Souls one.

3355
05:12:34,340 --> 05:12:36,340
Wait, Pumpkin wants us to go up here?

3356
05:12:36,340 --> 05:12:38,340
Am I going crazy?

3357
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:40,340
No.

3358
05:12:44,340 --> 05:12:46,340
Oh, Hypno from Pokemon Cosplay soon.

3359
05:12:46,340 --> 05:12:49,340
Sorry, I thought you were asking for a roleplay.

3360
05:12:49,340 --> 05:12:51,340
I was like, why would I roleplay a Pokemon?

3361
05:12:51,340 --> 05:12:53,340
Are you giving up Pumpkin now, Matt?

3362
05:12:53,340 --> 05:12:55,340
Do I really want to be a pumpkin?

3363
05:12:55,340 --> 05:12:57,340
I like my little tentacles.

3364
05:12:57,340 --> 05:12:59,340
I think that was on the head.

3365
05:12:59,340 --> 05:13:01,340
Alexander was up that cliff, I thought so.

3366
05:13:01,340 --> 05:13:03,340
Congrats if your name's Alex, by the way.

3367
05:13:03,340 --> 05:13:05,340
I just said your name.

3368
05:13:05,340 --> 05:13:09,340
God, Alexander the NPC.

3369
05:13:09,340 --> 05:13:11,340
It's kind of a trade-off between copper

3370
05:13:11,340 --> 05:13:13,340
and shrink and more in the game.

3371
05:13:13,340 --> 05:13:15,340
Nah, I'm teasing.

3372
05:13:15,340 --> 05:13:17,340
You're teasing, I'm but-

3373
05:13:17,340 --> 05:13:19,340
Oh, no.

3374
05:13:19,340 --> 05:13:21,340
These are the ones where you have to whack the bones.

3375
05:13:21,340 --> 05:13:23,340
I'm getting out of here.

3376
05:13:23,340 --> 05:13:25,340
I hate the ones where you're like,

3377
05:13:25,340 --> 05:13:27,340
there's one and done.

3378
05:13:27,340 --> 05:13:29,340
I think that's why, even though it's probably more

3379
05:13:29,340 --> 05:13:31,340
expensive, each of Models

3380
05:13:31,340 --> 05:13:33,340
and sitting and reclining poses look great.

3381
05:13:33,340 --> 05:13:35,340
Hmm.

3382
05:13:35,340 --> 05:13:37,340
We actually,

3383
05:13:37,340 --> 05:13:39,340
in development, I did entertain that

3384
05:13:39,340 --> 05:13:41,340
and I would,

3385
05:13:41,340 --> 05:13:43,340
like, have a, is it dynamic pose?

3386
05:13:43,340 --> 05:13:45,340
Each of us at one point.

3387
05:13:45,340 --> 05:13:47,340
Each of us at one point.

3388
05:13:47,340 --> 05:13:49,340
But then I realized,

3389
05:13:49,340 --> 05:13:51,340
like,

3390
05:13:51,340 --> 05:13:53,340
the appeal is,

3391
05:13:53,340 --> 05:13:55,340
you know,

3392
05:13:55,340 --> 05:13:57,340
the girls are going to be streaming on YouTube.

3393
05:13:57,340 --> 05:13:59,340
And

3394
05:13:59,340 --> 05:14:01,340
depending on what they wanted to do,

3395
05:14:01,340 --> 05:14:03,340
I didn't know if there was going to be someone

3396
05:14:03,340 --> 05:14:05,340
who wanted to exclusively just do ASMR streams,

3397
05:14:05,340 --> 05:14:07,340
because I know some creators are like that.

3398
05:14:07,340 --> 05:14:09,340
And it was like

3399
05:14:09,340 --> 05:14:11,340
to get, like, to spend even more

3400
05:14:11,340 --> 05:14:13,340
on top of what the base price of the Models

3401
05:14:13,340 --> 05:14:15,340
is for, like, some sort of dynamic pose.

3402
05:14:15,340 --> 05:14:17,340
I definitely am open to the idea

3403
05:14:17,340 --> 05:14:19,340
of it, but, like, for me, for example,

3404
05:14:19,340 --> 05:14:21,340
I probably wouldn't use it

3405
05:14:21,340 --> 05:14:23,340
because I'm like, I'm a shit

3406
05:14:23,340 --> 05:14:25,340
VTuber in terms of, like, not using toggles,

3407
05:14:25,340 --> 05:14:27,340
not doing this, not doing that.

3408
05:14:27,340 --> 05:14:29,340
So I really would

3409
05:14:29,340 --> 05:14:31,340
only invest in, like,

3410
05:14:31,340 --> 05:14:33,340
an all-outfit, maybe.

3411
05:14:33,340 --> 05:14:35,340
Like, um,

3412
05:14:35,340 --> 05:14:37,340
Emmy's interested in, like, a straight-up

3413
05:14:37,340 --> 05:14:39,340
2.0, which is fine.

3414
05:14:39,340 --> 05:14:41,340
Um, but, like, for me,

3415
05:14:41,340 --> 05:14:43,340
I personally had it. Like, I really

3416
05:14:43,340 --> 05:14:45,340
like my model. Nari

3417
05:14:45,340 --> 05:14:47,340
made me so expressive as well,

3418
05:14:47,340 --> 05:14:49,340
like, seriously. I feel like

3419
05:14:49,340 --> 05:14:51,340
I'm not, like, stiff

3420
05:14:51,340 --> 05:14:53,340
or anything. I love how, like, I do

3421
05:14:53,340 --> 05:14:55,340
think, sorry, my hands are starting to sweat.

3422
05:14:55,340 --> 05:14:57,340
I need to wipe my hands on my hoodie.

3423
05:14:57,340 --> 05:14:59,340
Ta-da!

3424
05:14:59,340 --> 05:15:01,340
I'm a sweaty boy.

3425
05:15:03,340 --> 05:15:05,340
We're going to Radan next

3426
05:15:05,340 --> 05:15:07,340
to get

3427
05:15:07,340 --> 05:15:09,340
DLC stuff. Sorry, I'm doing one-handed.

3428
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:11,340
I'm trying to hydrate because I didn't realize how much I'm sweating

3429
05:15:11,340 --> 05:15:13,340
and I'm getting a bit worried that I'm going to be

3430
05:15:13,340 --> 05:15:15,340
dehydrated. Well, what are you doing?

3431
05:15:15,340 --> 05:15:17,340
Oh, sorry, my trigger got caught

3432
05:15:17,340 --> 05:15:19,340
on the table.

3433
05:15:19,340 --> 05:15:21,340
Wipe your hands

3434
05:15:21,340 --> 05:15:23,340
on me.

3435
05:15:23,340 --> 05:15:25,340
Oh, you're pointing.

3436
05:15:25,340 --> 05:15:27,340
Oh, no!

3437
05:15:27,340 --> 05:15:29,340
Wait, huh?

3438
05:15:31,340 --> 05:15:33,340
Am I about to do a boss fight?

3439
05:15:33,340 --> 05:15:35,340
Why can't I progress?

3440
05:15:35,340 --> 05:15:37,340
No!

3441
05:15:37,340 --> 05:15:39,340
Boss fight, because the reeflings can't be with me!

3442
05:15:43,340 --> 05:15:45,340
Sugar.

3443
05:15:45,340 --> 05:15:47,340
Oh, no.

3444
05:15:47,340 --> 05:15:49,340
I don't want to use any stamina.

3445
05:15:53,340 --> 05:15:55,340
Oh, no, this can't be.

3446
05:15:55,340 --> 05:15:57,340
I've not leveled up my weapons or anything.

3447
05:15:57,340 --> 05:15:59,340
Or got more flasks. Or got more seeds.

3448
05:16:01,340 --> 05:16:03,340
I don't want to upset anyone.

3449
05:16:07,340 --> 05:16:09,340
Is it in here?

3450
05:16:09,340 --> 05:16:11,340
Where? Where are they?

3451
05:16:11,340 --> 05:16:13,340
Oh!

3452
05:16:13,340 --> 05:16:15,340
Come here, you bum.

3453
05:16:15,340 --> 05:16:17,340
Come here, you bum. Just because I've not got my reeflings

3454
05:16:17,340 --> 05:16:19,340
doesn't mean

3455
05:16:19,340 --> 05:16:21,340
I'm not going to fucking give you everything I got.

3456
05:16:27,340 --> 05:16:29,340
I'm out of stamina!

3457
05:16:29,340 --> 05:16:31,340
Both of us are fucking

3458
05:16:31,340 --> 05:16:33,340
stamina handy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

3459
05:16:33,340 --> 05:16:35,340
hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get the...

3460
05:16:35,340 --> 05:16:37,340
Hold on, let me cheat. Hold on, let me cheat!

3461
05:16:37,340 --> 05:16:39,340
Hold on, let me cheat. Let me cheat.

3462
05:16:39,340 --> 05:16:41,340
I see that fucking thing.

3463
05:16:41,340 --> 05:16:43,340
I see it. Let me cheat right now.

3464
05:16:43,340 --> 05:16:45,340
GAN!

3465
05:16:45,340 --> 05:16:47,340
GAN and save me!

3466
05:16:47,340 --> 05:16:49,340
Unable to summon.

3467
05:16:49,340 --> 05:16:51,340
Oh, mother...

3468
05:16:53,340 --> 05:16:55,340
I need heal.

3469
05:17:01,340 --> 05:17:03,340
We are both Wacken,

3470
05:17:03,340 --> 05:17:05,340
but not staggering each other.

3471
05:17:05,340 --> 05:17:07,340
That's quite funny.

3472
05:17:07,340 --> 05:17:09,340
Speaking of staggers, take this.

3473
05:17:09,340 --> 05:17:11,340
Oh, I'm missing.

3474
05:17:11,340 --> 05:17:13,340
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

3475
05:17:21,340 --> 05:17:23,340
Thank you.

3476
05:17:25,340 --> 05:17:27,340
Thank you.

3477
05:17:29,340 --> 05:17:31,340
Don't ever come around these parts again.

3478
05:17:31,340 --> 05:17:33,340
Me and the Reeflings rule this neighborhood.

3479
05:17:33,340 --> 05:17:35,340
That make myself clear.

3480
05:17:35,340 --> 05:17:37,340
Woman.

3481
05:17:37,340 --> 05:17:39,340
Cookbook. Of course you got Cookbook flying around.

3482
05:17:39,340 --> 05:17:41,340
We've beaten them.

3483
05:17:43,340 --> 05:17:45,340
What is your name?

3484
05:17:47,340 --> 05:17:49,340
Well, in you come.

3485
05:17:49,340 --> 05:17:51,340
Jeez, what a name.

3486
05:17:53,340 --> 05:17:55,340
Is there anyone here who hasn't been in before?

3487
05:17:55,340 --> 05:17:57,340
I did grab you.

3488
05:18:01,340 --> 05:18:03,340
You look like an Edgelord McGee.

3489
05:18:03,340 --> 05:18:05,340
Okay.

3490
05:18:05,340 --> 05:18:07,340
And you come, Edgelord McGee.

3491
05:18:09,340 --> 05:18:11,340
See, that's what I shouldn't have named.

3492
05:18:11,340 --> 05:18:13,340
If I had a Scottish VTuber that I applied,

3493
05:18:13,340 --> 05:18:15,340
I'll name him McGee something.

3494
05:18:15,340 --> 05:18:17,340
Or something McGee, sorry.

3495
05:18:17,340 --> 05:18:19,340
Is there any invaders?

3496
05:18:19,340 --> 05:18:21,340
Anyone...

3497
05:18:21,340 --> 05:18:23,340
Interesting in invading?

3498
05:18:27,340 --> 05:18:29,340
I strongly say for you to get to the DLC station.

3499
05:18:29,340 --> 05:18:31,340
I hope you're ready for some hard bosses.

3500
05:18:31,340 --> 05:18:33,340
They have been wiping my ass.

3501
05:18:33,340 --> 05:18:35,340
Oh, yeah, no.

3502
05:18:35,340 --> 05:18:39,340
I have been doing very well.

3503
05:18:39,340 --> 05:18:41,340
If you don't know, I'm actually a very skilled Elden Ring player.

3504
05:18:41,340 --> 05:18:43,340
I'm actually really happy to announce

3505
05:18:43,340 --> 05:18:45,340
I did a speed run of it one time.

3506
05:18:45,340 --> 05:18:47,340
And I placed top 80.

3507
05:18:47,340 --> 05:18:49,340
It wasn't the best speed run,

3508
05:18:49,340 --> 05:18:51,340
but I'm actually pretty strong at the game.

3509
05:18:51,340 --> 05:18:55,340
And I actually do not use the Reeflings at all

3510
05:18:55,340 --> 05:18:57,340
in order to help me

3511
05:18:57,340 --> 05:18:59,340
progress the storyline.

3512
05:19:01,340 --> 05:19:03,340
Salad.

3513
05:19:03,340 --> 05:19:05,340
I've actually been kind of abusing you a bit, Salad.

3514
05:19:07,340 --> 05:19:09,340
I want strongy to invade my mind.

3515
05:19:11,340 --> 05:19:13,340
Okay.

3516
05:19:13,340 --> 05:19:15,340
Let me bless all three Reeflings

3517
05:19:15,340 --> 05:19:17,340
that once the Invader Summer comes in.

3518
05:19:19,340 --> 05:19:21,340
Oh my god, my notes are getting so scribbly.

3519
05:19:21,340 --> 05:19:23,340
I can't even like...

3520
05:19:23,340 --> 05:19:25,340
I'm trying to put tabs on

3521
05:19:25,340 --> 05:19:27,340
like who's been coming in on that.

3522
05:19:27,340 --> 05:19:29,340
But I have to admit, I've been fucking up really badly.

3523
05:19:33,340 --> 05:19:35,340
Okay.

3524
05:19:35,340 --> 05:19:37,340
All three Reeflings are ready.

3525
05:19:37,340 --> 05:19:39,340
It's...

3526
05:19:39,340 --> 05:19:41,340
I don't know what hole you're going to get.

3527
05:19:41,340 --> 05:19:43,340
It's going to be over before you know it.

3528
05:19:43,340 --> 05:19:45,340
That's all you need to know.

3529
05:19:45,340 --> 05:19:47,340
Okay.

3530
05:19:49,340 --> 05:19:51,340
Ready?

3531
05:19:51,340 --> 05:19:53,340
He went first.

3532
05:19:53,340 --> 05:19:55,340
He went first.

3533
05:19:55,340 --> 05:19:57,340
Okay.

3534
05:19:57,340 --> 05:19:59,340
Let's go.

3535
05:19:59,340 --> 05:20:01,340
Yahoo.

3536
05:20:01,340 --> 05:20:03,340
We will now follow.

3537
05:20:13,340 --> 05:20:15,340
Wait, isn't there a dragon up here?

3538
05:20:15,340 --> 05:20:17,340
Whoa.

3539
05:20:17,340 --> 05:20:19,340
I didn't even see them.

3540
05:20:19,340 --> 05:20:21,340
I'm so blind.

3541
05:20:23,340 --> 05:20:25,340
Drawstring.

3542
05:20:25,340 --> 05:20:27,340
Lightning greets.

3543
05:20:27,340 --> 05:20:29,340
But not to be confused with grease and lightness.

3544
05:20:31,340 --> 05:20:33,340
Keyleth.

3545
05:20:33,340 --> 05:20:35,340
Any Keyleth enjoyers?

3546
05:20:37,340 --> 05:20:39,340
What?

3547
05:20:39,340 --> 05:20:41,340
Whoa, you look kind of scary.

3548
05:20:41,340 --> 05:20:43,340
You're not going to lie with your weapons.

3549
05:20:43,340 --> 05:20:45,340
Look at the freaking distance he has on his.

3550
05:20:45,340 --> 05:20:47,340
Jeez, I don't want to go in a fight against you.

3551
05:20:47,340 --> 05:20:49,340
Are you going to whip?

3552
05:20:49,340 --> 05:20:51,340
Is that a whip?

3553
05:20:51,340 --> 05:20:53,340
Wait, I need to whip.

3554
05:20:53,340 --> 05:20:55,340
I can whip you guys.

3555
05:20:55,340 --> 05:20:57,340
Sheevee sends her regards.

3556
05:20:57,340 --> 05:20:59,340
Basically.

3557
05:20:59,340 --> 05:21:01,340
Okay, we're going.

3558
05:21:01,340 --> 05:21:03,340
Following the Reeflings.

3559
05:21:03,340 --> 05:21:05,340
Reeflings are following the Reeflings.

3560
05:21:05,340 --> 05:21:07,340
So we complete the DLC.

3561
05:21:07,340 --> 05:21:09,340
It costs an extra $60.

3562
05:21:09,340 --> 05:21:11,340
$60.

3563
05:21:11,340 --> 05:21:13,340
It costs an extra $60.

3564
05:21:13,340 --> 05:21:15,340
But apparently it's really good.

3565
05:21:15,340 --> 05:21:17,340
The Reeflings are kind of splitting a bit.

3566
05:21:17,340 --> 05:21:19,340
Oh no, we're avoiding that little army there.

3567
05:21:21,340 --> 05:21:23,340
Who enjoys Keyleth?

3568
05:21:23,340 --> 05:21:25,340
Question 1.

3569
05:21:27,340 --> 05:21:29,340
More if you're feeling

3570
05:21:29,340 --> 05:21:31,340
especially daring.

3571
05:21:33,340 --> 05:21:35,340
Five?

3572
05:21:41,340 --> 05:21:43,340
I mean, if you want to get

3573
05:21:43,340 --> 05:21:45,340
technical

3574
05:21:45,340 --> 05:21:47,340
six

3575
05:21:47,340 --> 05:21:49,340
on a Waman.

3576
05:21:49,340 --> 05:21:51,340
For maximum

3577
05:21:51,340 --> 05:21:53,340
maximum

3578
05:21:53,340 --> 05:21:55,340
maximum

3579
05:21:55,340 --> 05:21:57,340
uh

3580
05:21:57,340 --> 05:21:59,340
Holy

3581
05:21:59,340 --> 05:22:01,340
I can't believe I'm saying that.

3582
05:22:01,340 --> 05:22:03,340
Yeah.

3583
05:22:03,340 --> 05:22:05,340
For max efficiency is six.

3584
05:22:07,340 --> 05:22:09,340
If you want to min max a woman

3585
05:22:09,340 --> 05:22:11,340
six.

3586
05:22:11,340 --> 05:22:13,340
Okay.

3587
05:22:13,340 --> 05:22:15,340
I'm just letting magic deal

3588
05:22:15,340 --> 05:22:17,340
with these dogs. They're terrifying, honestly.

3589
05:22:17,340 --> 05:22:19,340
They do look like T-Rex people.

3590
05:22:19,340 --> 05:22:21,340
I do have to give

3591
05:22:21,340 --> 05:22:23,340
off my hat to the game design.

3592
05:22:23,340 --> 05:22:25,340
Seriously, like all these different aspects.

3593
05:22:25,340 --> 05:22:27,340
This game development

3594
05:22:27,340 --> 05:22:29,340
must have been

3595
05:22:29,340 --> 05:22:31,340
very long.

3596
05:22:31,340 --> 05:22:33,340
Six. Yeah, but I feel a difference in quality

3597
05:22:33,340 --> 05:22:35,340
between the best and worst

3598
05:22:35,340 --> 05:22:37,340
through astronomical. What about pit?

3599
05:22:37,340 --> 05:22:39,340
It's not a hole though.

3600
05:22:39,340 --> 05:22:41,340
It would be nose

3601
05:22:41,340 --> 05:22:43,340
ears, mouse

3602
05:22:43,340 --> 05:22:45,340
babina

3603
05:22:45,340 --> 05:22:47,340
booty

3604
05:22:47,340 --> 05:22:49,340
and then

3605
05:22:49,340 --> 05:22:51,340
that's what

3606
05:22:55,340 --> 05:22:57,340
nose and ears

3607
05:22:57,340 --> 05:22:59,340
will take another

3608
05:22:59,340 --> 05:23:01,340
anything.

3609
05:23:01,340 --> 05:23:03,340
She

3610
05:23:03,340 --> 05:23:05,340
Oh, they blew up.

3611
05:23:05,340 --> 05:23:07,340
I thought it was one of you guys doing magic on

3612
05:23:07,340 --> 05:23:09,340
me.

3613
05:23:09,340 --> 05:23:11,340
Sorry, the reeflings like

3614
05:23:11,340 --> 05:23:13,340
leading me on this quest or something like

3615
05:23:13,340 --> 05:23:15,340
contemplating the uh

3616
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:17,340
the true ultimate number

3617
05:23:19,340 --> 05:23:21,340
was a hole again.

3618
05:23:21,340 --> 05:23:23,340
Yeah, but the pits aren't

3619
05:23:23,340 --> 05:23:25,340
uh and it's like a

3620
05:23:25,340 --> 05:23:27,340
it doesn't have an end to it if you will.

3621
05:23:27,340 --> 05:23:29,340
I actually

3622
05:23:29,340 --> 05:23:31,340
thought when AC was actually

3623
05:23:31,340 --> 05:23:33,340
getting concepts with

3624
05:23:33,340 --> 05:23:35,340
I'm so sorry to bring this upon you.

3625
05:23:35,340 --> 05:23:37,340
Um

3626
05:23:37,340 --> 05:23:39,340
I actually thought about commissioning

3627
05:23:39,340 --> 05:23:41,340
the ear artwork for her

3628
05:23:41,340 --> 05:23:43,340
like of her

3629
05:23:43,340 --> 05:23:45,340
but I was like I don't want to do that

3630
05:23:45,340 --> 05:23:47,340
if that would make her uncomfortable because I didn't know at the time

3631
05:23:47,340 --> 05:23:49,340
like what the comfort level of the girls are

3632
05:23:49,340 --> 05:23:51,340
as far as I'm aware

3633
05:23:51,340 --> 05:23:53,340
everything fucking goes.

3634
05:23:53,340 --> 05:23:55,340
Everyone's like on the same page of like

3635
05:23:55,340 --> 05:23:57,340
if I don't like it, I just won't interact

3636
05:23:57,340 --> 05:23:59,340
so don't be surprised if I don't interact

3637
05:23:59,340 --> 05:24:01,340
type thing and then that's it.

3638
05:24:01,340 --> 05:24:03,340
Ear artwork

3639
05:24:03,340 --> 05:24:05,340

3640
05:24:05,340 --> 05:24:07,340

3641
05:24:07,340 --> 05:24:09,340
are we about to show a reefling

3642
05:24:09,340 --> 05:24:11,340
one of the most cursed things ever?

3643
05:24:13,340 --> 05:24:15,340
So there's this

3644
05:24:15,340 --> 05:24:17,340
really famous

3645
05:24:17,340 --> 05:24:19,340
Neco animation

3646
05:24:19,340 --> 05:24:21,340
and it's like a Neco girl

3647
05:24:21,340 --> 05:24:23,340
which has got Neco ears

3648
05:24:25,340 --> 05:24:27,340
and

3649
05:24:27,340 --> 05:24:29,340
how am I getting ashes of war?

3650
05:24:29,340 --> 05:24:31,340
I'm done it. Life steal fits

3651
05:24:31,340 --> 05:24:33,340

3654
05:24:37,340 --> 05:24:39,340
oh are you talking about ear smashing?

3655
05:24:39,340 --> 05:24:41,340
yeah

3656
05:24:41,340 --> 05:24:43,340
I think that's what it's called I guess

3657
05:24:43,340 --> 05:24:45,340
oh wait, mumbling

3658
05:24:45,340 --> 05:24:47,340
hold on, hold on I have to take my glycol

3659
05:24:49,340 --> 05:24:51,340
the ears aren't designed for that

3660
05:24:51,340 --> 05:24:53,340
no I know but I thought I would beat someone

3661
05:24:53,340 --> 05:24:55,340
to the chase and do it for icing

3662
05:24:55,340 --> 05:24:57,340
and if she found it funny she can post it

3663
05:24:57,340 --> 05:24:59,340
if she didn't she didn't have to

3664
05:24:59,340 --> 05:25:01,340
do the artwork

3665
05:25:01,340 --> 05:25:03,340
the concert artists of me and AC together

3666
05:25:03,340 --> 05:25:05,340
it's not like a major thing

3667
05:25:05,340 --> 05:25:07,340
it's just like AC is

3668
05:25:11,340 --> 05:25:13,340
but you guys just think it funny

3669
05:25:13,340 --> 05:25:15,340
I won't post it yet cause

3670
05:25:17,340 --> 05:25:19,340
I guess I need to ask her

3671
05:25:19,340 --> 05:25:21,340
although she's already seen it and she laughed at it

3672
05:25:21,340 --> 05:25:23,340
she found it funny

3673
05:25:23,340 --> 05:25:25,340

3674
05:25:25,340 --> 05:25:27,340

3675
05:25:27,340 --> 05:25:29,340

3676
05:25:29,340 --> 05:25:31,340

3677
05:25:31,340 --> 05:25:33,340

3678
05:25:33,340 --> 05:25:35,340

I'm gonna have to get some food in my tum tum

3686
05:25:49,340 --> 05:25:51,340

3688
05:25:53,340 --> 05:25:55,340
like I ordered them yesterday

3689
05:25:55,340 --> 05:25:57,340
so I can eat them today like a 5 head

3690
05:25:57,340 --> 05:25:59,340
so I didn't have to make any food

3691
05:26:03,340 --> 05:26:05,340
I assume it's this way

3692
05:26:05,340 --> 05:26:07,340
oh no we're splitting off

3693
05:26:07,340 --> 05:26:09,340
hold on a minute

3694
05:26:09,340 --> 05:26:11,340
we've got conflict of interest conflict of interest

3695
05:26:11,340 --> 05:26:13,340

3696
05:26:13,340 --> 05:26:15,340

3697
05:26:15,340 --> 05:26:17,340
I'm not real

3698
05:26:17,340 --> 05:26:19,340
you can't see me

3699
05:26:19,340 --> 05:26:21,340

3700
05:26:21,340 --> 05:26:23,340
oh you're taking me to the church

3701
05:26:23,340 --> 05:26:25,340
we activated the dragon

3702
05:26:25,340 --> 05:26:27,340
just a little bit

3703
05:26:27,340 --> 05:26:29,340
it's okay though

3704
05:26:29,340 --> 05:26:31,340
it's okay

3705
05:26:31,340 --> 05:26:33,340
everything is cool

3706
05:26:33,340 --> 05:26:35,340
it's okay

3707
05:26:35,340 --> 05:26:37,340

3708
05:26:37,340 --> 05:26:39,340

3709
05:26:41,340 --> 05:26:43,340
what does he do

3710
05:26:43,340 --> 05:26:45,340
I'll get my bone out of the way

3711
05:26:45,340 --> 05:26:47,340

3712
05:26:47,340 --> 05:26:49,340

3713
05:26:49,340 --> 05:26:51,340

3715
05:26:53,340 --> 05:26:55,340

3716
05:26:55,340 --> 05:26:57,340

3717
05:26:57,340 --> 05:26:59,340

3718
05:26:59,340 --> 05:27:01,340
he takes 60%

3719
05:27:01,340 --> 05:27:03,340
it does manage to heal up

3720
05:27:03,340 --> 05:27:05,340
it's not a problem for him

3721
05:27:05,340 --> 05:27:07,340
the dragon already experiencing

3722
05:27:07,340 --> 05:27:09,340
roughly 8% max health

3723
05:27:09,340 --> 05:27:11,340
it's going down

3724
05:27:11,340 --> 05:27:13,340
the second refling coming in to help

3725
05:27:13,340 --> 05:27:15,340

05:31:19,340 --> 05:31:21,340
I actually don't know the words

3818
05:31:21,340 --> 05:31:23,340
they're doing beatle just

3819
05:31:29,340 --> 05:31:31,340
I

3820
05:31:33,340 --> 05:31:35,340
I could

3821
05:31:35,340 --> 05:31:37,340
be very quiet

3822
05:31:37,340 --> 05:31:39,340
be very very quiet

3823
05:31:39,340 --> 05:31:41,340
refling

3824
05:31:41,340 --> 05:31:43,340
there's an enemy right over there

3825
05:31:45,340 --> 05:31:47,340
why is there no others

3826
05:31:47,340 --> 05:31:49,340
I said be quiet

3827
05:31:49,340 --> 05:31:51,340
no don't

3828
05:31:51,340 --> 05:31:53,340
wait where can I assign

3829
05:31:53,340 --> 05:31:55,340
a second refling

3830
05:31:55,340 --> 05:31:57,340
okay take me where we need to go

3831
05:31:57,340 --> 05:31:59,340
I'm so sorry to any refling

3832
05:31:59,340 --> 05:32:01,340
put their mark down there I think that's glitched cause

3833
05:32:01,340 --> 05:32:03,340
the area goes downwards on the map

3834
05:32:05,340 --> 05:32:07,340
we don't have to be quiet anymore

3835
05:32:07,340 --> 05:32:09,340
like a weeping

3836
05:32:09,340 --> 05:32:11,340
I'm not actually sure how to hit enemies

3837
05:32:11,340 --> 05:32:13,340
as a summon jola

3838
05:32:13,340 --> 05:32:15,340
enemy

3839
05:32:15,340 --> 05:32:17,340
I don't think it's a bad refling

3840
05:32:17,340 --> 05:32:19,340
I don't know why

3841
05:32:19,340 --> 05:32:21,340
there really isn't any mark that spawned in

3842
05:32:21,340 --> 05:32:23,340
it must be glitched we'll go to the next one

3843
05:32:23,340 --> 05:32:25,340
I have one refling to protect me

3844
05:32:25,340 --> 05:32:27,340
it'll be fine

3845
05:32:27,340 --> 05:32:29,340
wait where the heck did you guys go

3846
05:32:29,340 --> 05:32:31,340

3847
05:32:31,340 --> 05:32:33,340

3848
05:32:33,340 --> 05:32:35,340
look at that tree

3849
05:32:35,340 --> 05:32:37,340
oh it looks like a skull

3850
05:32:37,340 --> 05:32:39,340
do you see it

3851
05:32:39,340 --> 05:32:41,340
oh it must be a skull

3852
05:32:41,340 --> 05:32:43,340
that's not a coincidence

3853
05:32:43,340 --> 05:32:45,340
that's clearly been altered

3854
05:32:45,340 --> 05:32:47,340

3855
05:32:47,340 --> 05:32:49,340

3858
05:32:53,340 --> 05:32:55,340

3861
05:32:59,340 --> 05:33:01,340

3868
05:33:13,340 --> 05:33:15,340
oh

3869
05:33:17,340 --> 05:33:19,340
just a heads up for upgrades

3870
05:33:19,340 --> 05:33:21,340
while the guts sword is based

3871
05:33:21,340 --> 05:33:23,340
it's a pain to upgrade

3872
05:33:23,340 --> 05:33:25,340
it'll take 110 upgrade items

3873
05:33:25,340 --> 05:33:27,340
to reach max level

3874
05:33:27,340 --> 05:33:29,340
if you use a unique

3875
05:33:29,340 --> 05:33:31,340
somber weapon

3876
05:33:31,340 --> 05:33:33,340
it only takes 10 items

3877
05:33:33,340 --> 05:33:35,340
okay

3878
05:33:35,340 --> 05:33:37,340
I've not heard of that guts weapon

3879
05:33:37,340 --> 05:33:39,340
thank you Oregon for the 10

3880
05:33:41,340 --> 05:33:43,340
the guts weapon

3881
05:33:43,340 --> 05:33:45,340
I'm not holding the guts I'm holding

3882
05:33:45,340 --> 05:33:47,340
joe wheel like big old broadswords

3883
05:33:47,340 --> 05:33:49,340

3892
05:34:07,340 --> 05:34:09,340

05:34:09,340 --> 05:34:11,340

ouch

3902
05:34:33,340 --> 05:34:35,340
refling is a free man

3903
05:34:35,340 --> 05:34:37,340
and he can do it as he pleases

3904
05:34:39,340 --> 05:34:41,340
and it doesn't please him

3905
05:34:41,340 --> 05:34:43,340
and it doesn't please me

3906
05:34:43,340 --> 05:34:45,340

3907
05:34:45,340 --> 05:34:47,340

joe is not enemy aggro

3910
05:34:51,340 --> 05:34:53,340

3911
05:34:53,340 --> 05:34:55,340

3912
05:34:55,340 --> 05:34:57,340

3922
05:35:15,340 --> 05:35:17,340

05:36:41,340 --> 05:36:43,340
he thinks he's a

3958
05:36:43,340 --> 05:36:45,340
what are they called a philosopher

3959
05:36:45,340 --> 05:36:47,340
he's not the thinker

3960
05:36:47,340 --> 05:36:49,340
map then Radan

3961
05:36:49,340 --> 05:36:51,340

05:36:59,340 --> 05:37:01,340
we need to go back a little bit okay

3967
05:37:01,340 --> 05:37:03,340
cause I'm gonna get the map of Kaleid

3968
05:37:03,340 --> 05:37:05,340
we might get attacked by those birds though

3969
05:37:05,340 --> 05:37:07,340
maybe if we

3970
05:37:07,340 --> 05:37:09,340
if we like stealth

3971
05:37:11,340 --> 05:37:13,340
that would be okay

3972
05:37:13,340 --> 05:37:15,340
I think we can do it

3973
05:37:15,340 --> 05:37:17,340

3974
05:37:17,340 --> 05:37:19,340

cause you have anything of interest

3988
05:37:55,340 --> 05:37:57,340
gravity's advantage

3989
05:37:57,340 --> 05:37:59,340
note imparting knowledge and brief

3990
05:37:59,340 --> 05:38:01,340

I'll buy it I guess

3993
05:38:05,340 --> 05:38:07,340
cause we might need it for crafting something

3994
05:38:07,340 --> 05:38:09,340

3995
05:38:09,340 --> 05:38:11,340

3998
05:38:15,340 --> 05:38:17,340
the wind forgets me every time

3999
05:38:17,340 --> 05:38:19,340
I was like who goes there

4000
05:38:19,340 --> 05:38:21,340

05:38:27,340 --> 05:38:29,340
self impaled on my

4005
05:38:29,340 --> 05:38:31,340
cookbooks or the

4006
05:38:31,340 --> 05:38:33,340
I'm like I'm crafted an item

4007
05:38:33,340 --> 05:38:35,340
this entire run so far

4008
05:38:35,340 --> 05:38:37,340
then again I haven't had to do

4009
05:38:37,340 --> 05:38:39,340
thank god

4010
05:38:39,340 --> 05:38:41,340
and I wouldn't have it any other way

4011
05:38:41,340 --> 05:38:43,340
but yes

4012
05:38:43,340 --> 05:38:45,340
there is delay

4013
05:38:45,340 --> 05:38:47,340
is doing doodles

4014
05:38:47,340 --> 05:38:49,340
question mark

4015
05:38:49,340 --> 05:38:51,340
and our membership is open

4016
05:38:51,340 --> 05:38:53,340
show your literal mother some love

4017
05:38:53,340 --> 05:38:55,340
that's right

4018
05:38:55,340 --> 05:38:57,340
she's your mommy

4019
05:38:57,340 --> 05:38:59,340
you crafted the things

4020
05:38:59,340 --> 05:39:01,340
that show you everyone's mark

4021
05:39:01,340 --> 05:39:03,340
I am a crafter

4022
05:39:03,340 --> 05:39:05,340
oh I'm so good

4023
05:39:07,340 --> 05:39:09,340
I'm so smart

4024
05:39:09,340 --> 05:39:11,340
throw money at Azura

4025
05:39:11,340 --> 05:39:13,340
I got it

4026
05:39:13,340 --> 05:39:15,340
I'm trying to help her move out

4027
05:39:15,340 --> 05:39:17,340
she's got a little bit work to do

4028
05:39:17,340 --> 05:39:19,340
with the audios

4029
05:39:19,340 --> 05:39:21,340
I can help her with the youtube audios

4030
05:39:21,340 --> 05:39:23,340
which means

4031
05:39:23,340 --> 05:39:25,340
everyone gets access

4032
05:39:25,340 --> 05:39:27,340
and then hopefully

4033
05:39:27,340 --> 05:39:29,340
she might be able to move out after one month

4034
05:39:29,340 --> 05:39:31,340
but I am going

4035
05:39:31,340 --> 05:39:33,340
to tell her to make sure you have like

4036
05:39:33,340 --> 05:39:35,340
triple

4037
05:39:35,340 --> 05:39:37,340
the rent

4038
05:39:37,340 --> 05:39:39,340
and your savings

4039
05:39:39,340 --> 05:39:41,340
because I don't want

4040
05:39:41,340 --> 05:39:43,340
any issues I don't know how renting in America works

4041
05:39:43,340 --> 05:39:45,340
but I've heard some weird horror stories

4042
05:39:45,340 --> 05:39:47,340
so I need to make sure

4043
05:39:47,340 --> 05:39:49,340
she's like stacked out the wazoo

4044
05:39:49,340 --> 05:39:51,340
so there is no problem

4045
05:39:51,340 --> 05:39:53,340
in that

4046
05:39:53,340 --> 05:39:55,340
she's so mummy

4047
05:39:55,340 --> 05:39:57,340
but you're mome

4048
05:39:57,340 --> 05:39:59,340
yes I'm mome

4049
05:39:59,340 --> 05:40:01,340
but she's your literal mum

4050
05:40:01,340 --> 05:40:03,340
I need to take this portal

4051
05:40:03,340 --> 05:40:05,340
I think this is the clearest indication

4052
05:40:05,340 --> 05:40:07,340
I need to take this particular portal

4053
05:40:07,340 --> 05:40:09,340
I believe I understand your communication

4054
05:40:09,340 --> 05:40:11,340
flap flap flap

4055
05:40:11,340 --> 05:40:13,340
yes

4056
05:40:13,340 --> 05:40:15,340
yeah depending on her credit

4057
05:40:15,340 --> 05:40:17,340
we might ask her about your portal

4058
05:40:19,340 --> 05:40:21,340
I don't know how

4059
05:40:21,340 --> 05:40:23,340
wait

4060
05:40:27,340 --> 05:40:29,340
I suppose

4061
05:40:29,340 --> 05:40:31,340
when I had to rent

4062
05:40:31,340 --> 05:40:33,340
because I said I was self employed

4063
05:40:33,340 --> 05:40:35,340
they were like

4064
05:40:35,340 --> 05:40:37,340
prove you have money and I'm like

4065
05:40:37,340 --> 05:40:39,340
okay

4066
05:40:39,340 --> 05:40:41,340
wait

4067
05:40:41,340 --> 05:40:43,340
yeah I don't have it

4068
05:40:43,340 --> 05:40:45,340
and so I have to like show them

4069
05:40:45,340 --> 05:40:47,340
like hey I make this much money

4070
05:40:47,340 --> 05:40:49,340
please let me have somewhere to live

4071
05:40:49,340 --> 05:40:51,340
that'd be great

4072
05:40:51,340 --> 05:40:53,340
wait you're not open

4073
05:40:53,340 --> 05:40:55,340
cannot be you

4074
05:40:55,340 --> 05:40:57,340
oh no

4075
05:40:57,340 --> 05:40:59,340
oh no this can't be

4076
05:41:01,340 --> 05:41:03,340
do we need to defeat more main bosses

4077
05:41:03,340 --> 05:41:05,340
I think

4078
05:41:05,340 --> 05:41:07,340
yeah it depends

4079
05:41:07,340 --> 05:41:09,340
wait she needs to get to

4080
05:41:09,340 --> 05:41:11,340
Altus

4081
05:41:11,340 --> 05:41:13,340
is that other way

4082
05:41:13,340 --> 05:41:15,340
is this Altus

4083
05:41:15,340 --> 05:41:17,340
like across

4084
05:41:17,340 --> 05:41:19,340
across the bridge

4085
05:41:19,340 --> 05:41:21,340
go to Altus Plateau

4086
05:41:21,340 --> 05:41:23,340
it's

4087
05:41:25,340 --> 05:41:27,340
oh my stomach

4088
05:41:27,340 --> 05:41:29,340
just farted internally

4089
05:41:29,340 --> 05:41:31,340
if you heard that

4090
05:41:31,340 --> 05:41:33,340
I've not taken the lift no

4091
05:41:33,340 --> 05:41:35,340
I've defeated two bosses and I'm getting

4092
05:41:35,340 --> 05:41:37,340
my hand carried

4093
05:41:37,340 --> 05:41:39,340
can you just walk in via the gate

4094
05:41:39,340 --> 05:41:41,340
Alice is about the huge lift

4095
05:41:41,340 --> 05:41:43,340

4096
05:41:43,340 --> 05:41:45,340

oh my tummy

4099
05:41:49,340 --> 05:41:51,340
it's an internal digestion

4100
05:41:51,340 --> 05:41:53,340
right what did I do

4101
05:41:53,340 --> 05:41:55,340
the temple quarter

4102
05:41:55,340 --> 05:41:57,340
great

4103
05:41:57,340 --> 05:41:59,340
go back to Linaria

4104
05:41:59,340 --> 05:42:01,340
why is it

4105
05:42:01,340 --> 05:42:03,340
the four bell freeze

4106
05:42:03,340 --> 05:42:05,340
Linaria or like

4107
05:42:05,340 --> 05:42:07,340
the

4108
05:42:07,340 --> 05:42:09,340
someone's appeared to lead the way

4109
05:42:09,340 --> 05:42:11,340
internal fart

4110
05:42:11,340 --> 05:42:13,340
yeah when your stomach makes like internal

4111
05:42:13,340 --> 05:42:15,340
digestion you can hear like

4112
05:42:15,340 --> 05:42:17,340
the gasses on that river

4113
05:42:17,340 --> 05:42:19,340
you either have to start the round request lane which will activate it

4114
05:42:19,340 --> 05:42:21,340
or scale

4115
05:42:21,340 --> 05:42:23,340
to Altaville

4116
05:42:23,340 --> 05:42:25,340
lift or main

4117
05:42:25,340 --> 05:42:27,340
below the bell free

4118
05:42:31,340 --> 05:42:33,340
oh the round request

4119
05:42:33,340 --> 05:42:35,340
that must have been how I triggered it

4120
05:42:35,340 --> 05:42:37,340
I have no idea where I'm going

4121
05:42:37,340 --> 05:42:39,340

4125
05:42:51,340 --> 05:42:53,340

4135
05:43:15,340 --> 05:43:17,340

4138
05:43:27,340 --> 05:43:29,340
why is the game not spawning

4139
05:43:29,340 --> 05:43:31,340
in the middle of this thing

4140
05:43:31,340 --> 05:43:33,340

4141
05:43:33,340 --> 05:43:35,340

let me get off first right invader first

4145
05:43:43,340 --> 05:43:45,340
oh wait no I can't do invader first

4146
05:43:45,340 --> 05:43:47,340
because it can't deserve the other one

4147
05:43:49,340 --> 05:43:51,340
and you're too insane

4148
05:43:51,340 --> 05:43:53,340
fine

4149
05:43:57,340 --> 05:43:59,340

okay

4166
05:44:33,340 --> 05:44:35,340
okay

4167
05:44:35,340 --> 05:44:37,340
is that my connection

4168
05:44:37,340 --> 05:44:39,340
it's taking so long

4169
05:44:43,340 --> 05:44:45,340
her back door

4170
05:44:45,340 --> 05:44:47,340
Alice we go yes

4171
05:44:47,340 --> 05:44:49,340
people haven't arrived to put down the marks yet

4172
05:44:49,340 --> 05:44:51,340
they were just putting them down at the other spot

4173
05:44:51,340 --> 05:44:53,340
oh when they thought I was runescape never ends

4174
05:44:53,340 --> 05:44:55,340
no someone said

4175
05:44:55,340 --> 05:44:57,340
statistically if I do two 12 hour

4176
05:44:57,340 --> 05:44:59,340
endurance streams I'll have 99

4177
05:44:59,340 --> 05:45:01,340
cookies

4178
05:45:01,340 --> 05:45:03,340
unable to summon

4179
05:45:03,340 --> 05:45:05,340
no

4180
05:45:07,340 --> 05:45:09,340
must be my connection

4181
05:45:09,340 --> 05:45:11,340
who didn't get in there was that

4182
05:45:13,340 --> 05:45:15,340
that was zero of sanity

4183
05:45:17,340 --> 05:45:19,340
my connection is wavering

4184
05:45:19,340 --> 05:45:21,340
it's not having a

4185
05:45:21,340 --> 05:45:23,340
let me check what it says

4186
05:45:23,340 --> 05:45:25,340
multiplayer group

4187
05:45:25,340 --> 05:45:27,340
multiplayer of settings

4188
05:45:27,340 --> 05:45:29,340
reef

4189
05:45:29,340 --> 05:45:31,340
there's nothing else to it

4190
05:45:35,340 --> 05:45:37,340
if no one can connect

4191
05:45:37,340 --> 05:45:39,340
there's definitely me having a moment

4192
05:45:39,340 --> 05:45:41,340
runescape grinding in the background

4193
05:45:41,340 --> 05:45:43,340
for tinfoil yuffin

4194
05:45:43,340 --> 05:45:45,340
could that be their server

4195
05:45:45,340 --> 05:45:47,340
yes actually before I start accusations

4196
05:45:47,340 --> 05:45:49,340
against Australian internet

4197
05:45:49,340 --> 05:45:51,340
it's very plausible their servers

4198
05:45:51,340 --> 05:45:53,340
are overriding right now

4199
05:45:53,340 --> 05:45:55,340
they're going ham

4200
05:45:55,340 --> 05:45:57,340
they're going full time because everyone's having to read each other

4201
05:45:57,340 --> 05:45:59,340
and all that

4202
05:46:01,340 --> 05:46:03,340
unable of god are the servers

4203
05:46:03,340 --> 05:46:05,340
down

4204
05:46:07,340 --> 05:46:09,340
you think the servers might be down for connecting

4205
05:46:09,340 --> 05:46:11,340
and I'm actually going to have to do something on my own

4206
05:46:11,340 --> 05:46:13,340
hello

4207
05:46:13,340 --> 05:46:15,340

4256
05:48:29,340 --> 05:48:31,340

how

4269
05:49:03,340 --> 05:49:05,340
I like the immediate kewerding stuff

4270
05:49:05,340 --> 05:49:07,340
kewerding

4271
05:49:07,340 --> 05:49:09,340
kewerding

4272
05:49:09,340 --> 05:49:11,340
kewerding

4273
05:49:11,340 --> 05:49:13,340
kewerding after

4274
05:49:13,340 --> 05:49:15,340
English parts

4275
05:49:15,340 --> 05:49:17,340

05:49:17,340 --> 05:49:19,340
secret cavern

4277
05:49:19,340 --> 05:49:21,340
secret cavern

4278
05:49:21,340 --> 05:49:23,340
to reefling

4279
05:49:23,340 --> 05:49:25,340
technically I'm a reefling

4280
05:49:25,340 --> 05:49:27,340
cause I'm a fan of mine

4281
05:49:27,340 --> 05:49:29,340
I hate that word fan

4282
05:49:29,340 --> 05:49:31,340
not fan

4283
05:49:31,340 --> 05:49:33,340
not fan it doesn't make sense

4284
05:49:35,340 --> 05:49:37,340
how are this

4285
05:49:37,340 --> 05:49:39,340

05:49:39,340 --> 05:49:41,340
you're a howard is

4287
05:49:41,340 --> 05:49:43,340
howard is

4288
05:49:43,340 --> 05:49:45,340
how are this

4289
05:49:45,340 --> 05:49:47,340
and I hate on this

4290
05:49:47,340 --> 05:49:49,340
oh it's wee lily

4291
05:49:49,340 --> 05:49:51,340
mecuelas lily

4292
05:49:53,340 --> 05:49:55,340
mods cage that man

4293
05:49:55,340 --> 05:49:57,340
that's exactly what I was trying to see

4294
05:49:57,340 --> 05:49:59,340
cage that reeflings technical

4295
05:49:59,340 --> 05:50:01,340
whoa you're the bug

4296
05:50:01,340 --> 05:50:03,340
a bug

4297
05:50:03,340 --> 05:50:05,340
a flag

4298
05:50:05,340 --> 05:50:07,340
someone killed something

4299
05:50:07,340 --> 05:50:09,340
and I got the flag

4300
05:50:09,340 --> 05:50:11,340
for it

4301
05:50:11,340 --> 05:50:13,340
the only betrayal we would do

4302
05:50:13,340 --> 05:50:15,340
is a reverse of the usual

4303
05:50:15,340 --> 05:50:17,340
and out of nowhere using the front door

4304
05:50:17,340 --> 05:50:19,340
yeah how dare you

4305
05:50:19,340 --> 05:50:21,340
I do like the idea of

4306
05:50:21,340 --> 05:50:23,340
the old bandage

4307
05:50:23,340 --> 05:50:25,340
the old bandage

4308
05:50:25,340 --> 05:50:27,340
I like those

4309
05:50:27,340 --> 05:50:29,340
underwear as well

4310
05:50:29,340 --> 05:50:31,340
that cover up that section

4311
05:50:31,340 --> 05:50:33,340
but don't have a section

4312
05:50:33,340 --> 05:50:35,340
for the back door

4313
05:50:35,340 --> 05:50:37,340
of the house

4314
05:50:37,340 --> 05:50:39,340
those underwear

4315
05:50:39,340 --> 05:50:41,340
are really good

4316
05:50:45,340 --> 05:50:47,340
one's a crusty bus station

4317
05:50:47,340 --> 05:50:49,340
something like that

4318
05:50:49,340 --> 05:50:51,340
there's a good mark of grace over here

4319
05:50:51,340 --> 05:50:53,340
hold on I'm going to grab it

4320
05:50:55,340 --> 05:50:57,340
everyone asks howardens

4321
05:50:57,340 --> 05:50:59,340
but never whyardens

4322
05:51:03,340 --> 05:51:05,340
oh so when the reefling

4323
05:51:05,340 --> 05:51:07,340
tapes it's funny but if I see it

4324
05:51:07,340 --> 05:51:09,340
out loud it's not funny

4325
05:51:11,340 --> 05:51:13,340
you guys have some attitude on you tonight

4326
05:51:13,340 --> 05:51:15,340
you know that

4327
05:51:15,340 --> 05:51:17,340
I'd like to perish

4328
05:51:19,340 --> 05:51:21,340
okay

4329
05:51:21,340 --> 05:51:23,340
okay let's go again

4330
05:51:23,340 --> 05:51:25,340
what are you doing

4331
05:51:25,340 --> 05:51:27,340
what are you doing to that tree

4332
05:51:27,340 --> 05:51:29,340
a bandage

4333
05:51:29,340 --> 05:51:31,340
yes

4334
05:51:31,340 --> 05:51:33,340
so there's this act

4335
05:51:33,340 --> 05:51:35,340
of

4336
05:51:35,340 --> 05:51:37,340
hooting

4337
05:51:41,340 --> 05:51:43,340
and an empty apple

4338
05:51:43,340 --> 05:51:45,340
and the apple like you take the guts out of the apple

4339
05:51:45,340 --> 05:51:47,340
and then you fill it with

4340
05:51:47,340 --> 05:51:49,340
this toffee

4341
05:51:49,340 --> 05:51:51,340
sticky toffee

4342
05:51:51,340 --> 05:51:53,340
like a candied apple

4343
05:51:53,340 --> 05:51:55,340
and then you put

4344
05:51:55,340 --> 05:51:57,340
the lid back on

4345
05:51:57,340 --> 05:51:59,340
or the lid could be a plaster

4346
05:51:59,340 --> 05:52:01,340
of the sticky apple

4347
05:52:01,340 --> 05:52:03,340
what

4348
05:52:03,340 --> 05:52:05,340
thunderbolts and lightning

4349
05:52:05,340 --> 05:52:07,340
very very frightening

4350
05:52:07,340 --> 05:52:09,340
oh wait these are the thunderbol

4351
05:52:09,340 --> 05:52:11,340
flowers

4352
05:52:11,340 --> 05:52:13,340
oh they attract thunder

4353
05:52:13,340 --> 05:52:15,340
thunder

4354
05:52:15,340 --> 05:52:17,340
thunder

4355
05:52:23,340 --> 05:52:25,340
sorry

4356
05:52:25,340 --> 05:52:27,340
I was probably terrible

4357
05:52:27,340 --> 05:52:29,340
I tried

4358
05:52:33,340 --> 05:52:35,340
oh my god the way

4359
05:52:35,340 --> 05:52:37,340
Brian said ponzu

4360
05:52:37,340 --> 05:52:39,340
bit of ponzu

4361
05:52:39,340 --> 05:52:41,340
thank you broly legend

4362
05:52:41,340 --> 05:52:43,340
a bit of ponzu

4363
05:52:43,340 --> 05:52:45,340
I mean I wonder if I could get away

4364
05:52:45,340 --> 05:52:47,340
with doing a donut thunder word with it

4365
05:52:47,340 --> 05:52:49,340
see

4366
05:52:49,340 --> 05:52:51,340
oh this thing's terrible

4367
05:52:51,340 --> 05:52:53,340
I don't mean a brag or anything

4368
05:52:53,340 --> 05:52:55,340
but

4369
05:52:55,340 --> 05:52:57,340
um

4370
05:52:57,340 --> 05:52:59,340
the cake is so big

4371
05:52:59,340 --> 05:53:01,340
that you actually

4372
05:53:01,340 --> 05:53:03,340
even if I were to

4373
05:53:03,340 --> 05:53:05,340
put on

4374
05:53:05,340 --> 05:53:07,340
those kind of underwear

4375
05:53:07,340 --> 05:53:09,340
you actually couldn't see anything

4376
05:53:09,340 --> 05:53:11,340
because the cake is so big

4377
05:53:11,340 --> 05:53:13,340
does that make sense

4378
05:53:13,340 --> 05:53:15,340
I think that makes sense

4379
05:53:17,340 --> 05:53:19,340
whimpering this way

4380
05:53:21,340 --> 05:53:23,340
bandaid

4381
05:53:23,340 --> 05:53:25,340
lingerie, lots of good options

4382
05:53:25,340 --> 05:53:27,340
the bandaid after

4383
05:53:27,340 --> 05:53:29,340
yeah

4384
05:53:29,340 --> 05:53:31,340
it's not a well guarded secret

4385
05:53:33,340 --> 05:53:35,340
what gave it away the clapping ASMR

4386
05:53:37,340 --> 05:53:39,340
oh yes

4387
05:53:39,340 --> 05:53:41,340
I will sit

4388
05:53:41,340 --> 05:53:43,340
are you telling me to sit

4389
05:53:43,340 --> 05:53:45,340
I will touch it

4390
05:53:47,340 --> 05:53:49,340
I think we need the evidence

4391
05:53:49,340 --> 05:53:51,340
is this where I'm like donut thunder

4392
05:53:51,340 --> 05:53:53,340
I know like people in a vtuber

4393
05:53:53,340 --> 05:53:55,340
shouldn't show flesh or what

4394
05:53:55,340 --> 05:53:57,340
vtuber having fun, everyone having fun

4395
05:53:57,340 --> 05:53:59,340
vtuber not having fun, no one having fun

4396
05:53:59,340 --> 05:54:01,340
my heart is beating so fast

4397
05:54:01,340 --> 05:54:03,340
I'm gonna pass it

4398
05:54:03,340 --> 05:54:05,340
maybe

4399
05:54:05,340 --> 05:54:07,340
dragon

4400
05:54:07,340 --> 05:54:09,340
dragon

4401
05:54:09,340 --> 05:54:11,340
dragon

4402
05:54:11,340 --> 05:54:13,340
is this poison source

4403
05:54:13,340 --> 05:54:15,340
that goes away

4404
05:54:15,340 --> 05:54:17,340
or

4405
05:54:17,340 --> 05:54:19,340
going away

4406
05:54:19,340 --> 05:54:21,340
infinite plumage

4407
05:54:21,340 --> 05:54:23,340
honestly

4408
05:54:23,340 --> 05:54:25,340
we need the evidence

4409
05:54:25,340 --> 05:54:27,340
oh you guys are comfortable with it

4410
05:54:27,340 --> 05:54:29,340
I'm uncomfortable with it

4411
05:54:29,340 --> 05:54:31,340
yeah it doesn't make sense

4412
05:54:31,340 --> 05:54:33,340
can you show us

4413
05:54:33,340 --> 05:54:35,340
well I wanted to do

4414
05:54:35,340 --> 05:54:37,340
a slow clap

4415
05:54:37,340 --> 05:54:39,340
like slow motion clapping

4416
05:54:39,340 --> 05:54:41,340
so people can comprehend

4417
05:54:41,340 --> 05:54:43,340
how I made that ASMR

4418
05:54:43,340 --> 05:54:45,340
did we just run past

4419
05:54:45,340 --> 05:54:47,340
I think we may have to run past, you know that

4420
05:54:47,340 --> 05:54:49,340
okay I'm just gonna run past, I'm brave

4421
05:54:49,340 --> 05:54:51,340
I'm so brave I'm running fast

4422
05:54:53,340 --> 05:54:55,340
I might need to sleep but I need to

4423
05:54:55,340 --> 05:54:57,340
do more, oh you need to be careful though

4424
05:54:57,340 --> 05:54:59,340
neutralizing

4425
05:54:59,340 --> 05:55:01,340
bulbouses

4426
05:55:01,340 --> 05:55:03,340
did you just give me your bulbouses

4427
05:55:05,340 --> 05:55:07,340
okay we're just gonna run past

4428
05:55:07,340 --> 05:55:09,340
holy crap look how many there is

4429
05:55:09,340 --> 05:55:11,340
that's so much

4430
05:55:15,340 --> 05:55:17,340
actually speaking of dolls

4431
05:55:17,340 --> 05:55:19,340
because Ranny's a doll

4432
05:55:19,340 --> 05:55:21,340
you know how I cannae get away from like

4433
05:55:21,340 --> 05:55:23,340
creepy doll vtuber's and that

4434
05:55:23,340 --> 05:55:25,340
you know why I also like them

4435
05:55:25,340 --> 05:55:27,340
do you know what the appeal could be

4436
05:55:27,340 --> 05:55:29,340
the appeal could be

4437
05:55:29,340 --> 05:55:31,340
free use

4438
05:55:33,340 --> 05:55:35,340
like in theory they could be inactive

4439
05:55:35,340 --> 05:55:37,340
in like a plot

4440
05:55:37,340 --> 05:55:39,340
I don't know how to

4441
05:55:39,340 --> 05:55:41,340
like in my head I've not thought it out it just came on my mind right now

4442
05:55:41,340 --> 05:55:43,340
but like you can like play with your doll type thing

4443
05:55:43,340 --> 05:55:45,340
like free use

4444
05:55:45,340 --> 05:55:47,340
like that's another thing

4445
05:55:47,340 --> 05:55:49,340
anyway that's just me

4446
05:55:51,340 --> 05:55:53,340
I got it I got it

4447
05:55:53,340 --> 05:55:55,340
wow we need to keep moving this forza

4448
05:55:55,340 --> 05:55:57,340
everywhere they're taking over

4449
05:55:57,340 --> 05:55:59,340
they gave you a poison cure

4450
05:55:59,340 --> 05:56:01,340
oh in case you get poisoned

4451
05:56:01,340 --> 05:56:03,340
show gimley

4452
05:56:03,340 --> 05:56:05,340
what about Vigo

4453
05:56:05,340 --> 05:56:07,340
you don't like the appeal of Vigo

4454
05:56:07,340 --> 05:56:09,340
baby boy is a

4455
05:56:09,340 --> 05:56:11,340
he's been a very

4456
05:56:11,340 --> 05:56:13,340
interesting boy

4457
05:56:13,340 --> 05:56:15,340
recently

4458
05:56:15,340 --> 05:56:17,340
so when my hair

4459
05:56:17,340 --> 05:56:19,340
is wet

4460
05:56:19,340 --> 05:56:21,340
he goes crazy

4461
05:56:21,340 --> 05:56:23,340
pushing into my head

4462
05:56:23,340 --> 05:56:25,340
and it's really sore

4463
05:56:25,340 --> 05:56:27,340
oh I got barbaric roar

4464
05:56:27,340 --> 05:56:29,340
my flanks

4465
05:56:31,340 --> 05:56:33,340
Vigo is quiet he is a quiet boy

4466
05:56:33,340 --> 05:56:35,340
he's not very gimley

4467
05:56:35,340 --> 05:56:37,340
I don't know if it's because he's part munchkin

4468
05:56:37,340 --> 05:56:39,340
like I don't know how healthy munchkin cats are

4469
05:56:41,340 --> 05:56:43,340
I should actually probably do my research a bit more

4470
05:56:43,340 --> 05:56:45,340
he seems to be

4471
05:56:45,340 --> 05:56:47,340
are we oh yeah you flake

4472
05:56:47,340 --> 05:56:49,340
I was here 10

4473
05:56:49,340 --> 05:56:51,340
hours ago you're so slow

4474
05:56:51,340 --> 05:56:53,340
slow folks yeah yeah

4475
05:56:53,340 --> 05:56:55,340
um

4476
05:56:57,340 --> 05:56:59,340
I think the tag is something

4477
05:56:59,340 --> 05:57:01,340
emotionless yes yes

4478
05:57:01,340 --> 05:57:03,340
that could also be another angle of adult

4479
05:57:03,340 --> 05:57:05,340
each of her

4480
05:57:05,340 --> 05:57:07,340
oh can you not progress

4481
05:57:07,340 --> 05:57:09,340
oh no none of us

4482
05:57:09,340 --> 05:57:11,340
can progress

4483
05:57:11,340 --> 05:57:13,340
oh no this can't be

4484
05:57:13,340 --> 05:57:15,340

05:57:15,340 --> 05:57:17,340

I can't go in we can't progress

4487
05:57:19,340 --> 05:57:21,340
the helmet has jiggle

4488
05:57:21,340 --> 05:57:23,340
jiggle jiggle jiggle

4489
05:57:25,340 --> 05:57:27,340
yeah thankfully

4490
05:57:27,340 --> 05:57:29,340
he's a half breed munchkin

4491
05:57:29,340 --> 05:57:31,340
I'm very happy to say that

4492
05:57:31,340 --> 05:57:33,340
so he's not a full munchkin at all

4493
05:57:33,340 --> 05:57:35,340
he has tabby gene tabby cat gene

4494
05:57:35,340 --> 05:57:37,340
domination which I'm very freaking happy

4495
05:57:37,340 --> 05:57:39,340
about

4496
05:57:39,340 --> 05:57:41,340
his legs are just slightly smaller

4497
05:57:41,340 --> 05:57:43,340
but he looks healthy

4498
05:57:43,340 --> 05:57:45,340
I don't know if he just seems more tired

4499
05:57:45,340 --> 05:57:47,340
and

4500
05:57:47,340 --> 05:57:49,340
you flake

4501
05:57:49,340 --> 05:57:51,340
I have to

4502
05:57:51,340 --> 05:57:53,340
I have to go on my own

4503
05:57:53,340 --> 05:57:55,340
but it's okay

4504
05:57:59,340 --> 05:58:01,340
what they don't know

4505
05:58:03,340 --> 05:58:05,340
this is now a stealth mission

4506
05:58:05,340 --> 05:58:07,340
when I can't call you in

4507
05:58:07,340 --> 05:58:09,340
okay it's a stealth mission

4508
05:58:09,340 --> 05:58:11,340
we do not want to get caught

4509
05:58:11,340 --> 05:58:13,340
we do not want to enter any unnecessary

4510
05:58:13,340 --> 05:58:15,340
fight

4511
05:58:15,340 --> 05:58:17,340
we just need the mark of grave

4512
05:58:19,340 --> 05:58:21,340
oh my god no

4513
05:58:21,340 --> 05:58:23,340

4515
05:58:25,340 --> 05:58:27,340

silent I was like there's too many enemies

4566
06:00:55,340 --> 06:00:57,340

that guy was chasing me the entire time

4599
06:02:17,340 --> 06:02:19,340

4600
06:02:19,340 --> 06:02:21,340

4601
06:02:21,340 --> 06:02:23,340

you see that I almost perished off the side of the map

4626
06:03:29,340 --> 06:03:31,340

4634
06:03:45,340 --> 06:03:47,340

4635
06:03:47,340 --> 06:03:49,340
I had a heart attack

4636
06:03:51,340 --> 06:03:53,340

4637
06:03:53,340 --> 06:03:55,340

4638
06:03:55,340 --> 06:03:57,340

4643
06:04:05,340 --> 06:04:07,340
when I made my cup of tea I gave them a wee licky lick

4644
06:04:07,340 --> 06:04:09,340
cause they are we precious

4645
06:04:09,340 --> 06:04:11,340

ooh a smithing stone

4648
06:04:15,340 --> 06:04:17,340
ooh a smithing stone

4649
06:04:17,340 --> 06:04:19,340
ooh another one

4650
06:04:19,340 --> 06:04:21,340
holy crap

4651
06:04:21,340 --> 06:04:23,340
I am killing it with the magic

4652
06:04:25,340 --> 06:04:27,340
and by killing it I mean

4653
06:04:27,340 --> 06:04:29,340
absolutely why am I taking poison damage

4654
06:04:31,340 --> 06:04:33,340
huh

4655
06:04:33,340 --> 06:04:35,340
those bats do poison damage

4656
06:04:35,340 --> 06:04:37,340
how strange

4657
06:04:37,340 --> 06:04:39,340
I would not have put them for that

4658
06:04:41,340 --> 06:04:43,340
it's called having over 500 arrows in the game

4659
06:04:43,340 --> 06:04:45,340
at the point you just know where everything is

4660
06:04:45,340 --> 06:04:47,340
aww I am glad you can find a game

4661
06:04:47,340 --> 06:04:49,340
that you enjoy so much like that

4662
06:04:49,340 --> 06:04:51,340
I am kind of like that with Isaac

4663
06:04:51,340 --> 06:04:53,340
but I have to admit

4664
06:04:53,340 --> 06:04:55,340
Beltro stole my heart yesterday

4665
06:04:55,340 --> 06:04:57,340
I am

4666
06:04:57,340 --> 06:04:59,340
careful careful

4667
06:05:01,340 --> 06:05:03,340
I am very interested to play Beltro again

4668
06:05:03,340 --> 06:05:05,340
it won't be until July

4669
06:05:05,340 --> 06:05:07,340
my dad

4670
06:05:07,340 --> 06:05:09,340
he told me what

4671
06:05:09,340 --> 06:05:11,340
when he is coming over and when he is going

4672
06:05:11,340 --> 06:05:13,340
it is actually a lot longer

4673
06:05:13,340 --> 06:05:15,340
it is like just shy of me

4674
06:05:19,340 --> 06:05:21,340
behold precious item

4675
06:05:21,340 --> 06:05:23,340
oh you are right sorry

4676
06:05:23,340 --> 06:05:25,340
you are singing sorry I am going to distract you by the singing

4677
06:05:29,340 --> 06:05:31,340
I am actually open to Zura

4678
06:05:31,340 --> 06:05:33,340
I might entertain some more song covers

4679
06:05:33,340 --> 06:05:35,340
her voice is very unique

4680
06:05:35,340 --> 06:05:37,340
it sounds bloody good

4681
06:05:37,340 --> 06:05:39,340
obviously I made everyone do a meme song

4682
06:05:39,340 --> 06:05:41,340
but I would like to see her try

4683
06:05:41,340 --> 06:05:43,340
something of a different category

4684
06:05:43,340 --> 06:05:45,340
that I really need

4685
06:05:47,340 --> 06:05:49,340
yeah

4686
06:05:49,340 --> 06:05:51,340
she definitely has a thing for it

4687
06:05:51,340 --> 06:05:53,340
I think she just

4688
06:05:53,340 --> 06:05:55,340
I don't know what I should ask her to sing

4689
06:05:55,340 --> 06:05:57,340
is my only question

4690
06:05:57,340 --> 06:05:59,340
I am not sure she knows

4691
06:05:59,340 --> 06:06:01,340
either because she is new to it

4692
06:06:01,340 --> 06:06:03,340
as far as I am aware she didn't do song covers

4693
06:06:03,340 --> 06:06:05,340
or anything like that

4694
06:06:05,340 --> 06:06:07,340
that first song is boobs in the thumbnail

4695
06:06:07,340 --> 06:06:09,340
was her first ever song cover

4696
06:06:09,340 --> 06:06:11,340
I am just trying to think what kind of songs

4697
06:06:11,340 --> 06:06:13,340
would either get popular

4698
06:06:13,340 --> 06:06:15,340
like Emmie

4699
06:06:15,340 --> 06:06:17,340
has been

4700
06:06:17,340 --> 06:06:19,340
I am so sorry

4701
06:06:19,340 --> 06:06:21,340
Radio Refling

4702
06:06:21,340 --> 06:06:23,340
Emmie has been really receptive

4703
06:06:23,340 --> 06:06:25,340
I wanted to try a few things with her

4704
06:06:25,340 --> 06:06:27,340
as far as I am aware

4705
06:06:27,340 --> 06:06:29,340
the other

4706
06:06:29,340 --> 06:06:31,340
Mercy might want to do a song cover

4707
06:06:33,340 --> 06:06:35,340
again

4708
06:06:35,340 --> 06:06:37,340
I am doing that

4709
06:06:37,340 --> 06:06:39,340
we are going to do a little meme

4710
06:06:39,340 --> 06:06:41,340
I am going to ask them

4711
06:06:41,340 --> 06:06:43,340
hey what do you want to do

4712
06:06:43,340 --> 06:06:45,340
oh no

4713
06:06:45,340 --> 06:06:47,340
I think I am going to have to start upgrading my weapons

4714
06:06:47,340 --> 06:06:49,340
I am going to be honest

4715
06:06:49,340 --> 06:06:51,340
oh no

4716
06:06:51,340 --> 06:06:53,340
this is a dragon

4717
06:06:53,340 --> 06:06:55,340
I thought it was going to be the crystal guys

4718
06:06:55,340 --> 06:06:57,340
because we were just in a mine

4719
06:06:57,340 --> 06:06:59,340
I don't know if this is going to be easy

4720
06:06:59,340 --> 06:07:01,340
or hard

4721
06:07:01,340 --> 06:07:03,340
Joel clapping with no heart

4722
06:07:03,340 --> 06:07:05,340
seriously

4723
06:07:05,340 --> 06:07:07,340
I am going to ask them

4724
06:07:07,340 --> 06:07:09,340
what do you want to achieve

4725
06:07:09,340 --> 06:07:11,340

4726
06:07:11,340 --> 06:07:13,340

4730
06:07:19,340 --> 06:07:21,340

oh I got an achievement for that

4739
06:07:37,340 --> 06:07:39,340
I didn't even do anything

4740
06:07:39,340 --> 06:07:41,340
and I got an achievement

4741

5023
06:19:49,340 --> 06:19:51,340
we don't have access to force

5024
06:19:51,340 --> 06:19:53,340

we do have a magic wifling

5029
06:20:01,340 --> 06:20:03,340
it looks like a melee wifling working in tangent

5030
06:20:03,340 --> 06:20:05,340
although the arrow swapped to the magic wifling

5031
06:20:05,340 --> 06:20:07,340
we are rolling in to get killed

5032
06:20:07,340 --> 06:20:09,340

5035
06:20:13,340 --> 06:20:15,340

10% health can he heal

5037
06:20:17,340 --> 06:20:19,340

5038
06:20:19,340 --> 06:20:21,340
magic wifling

5039
06:20:21,340 --> 06:20:23,340

5071
06:21:35,340 --> 06:21:37,340

I see them making their way

5092
06:22:17,340 --> 06:22:19,340
there's five players on the battlefield

5093
06:22:19,340 --> 06:22:21,340

5094
06:22:21,340 --> 06:22:23,340
randomly target me

5095
06:22:23,340 --> 06:22:25,340

5096
06:22:29,340 --> 06:22:31,340
surely not targeting me

5097
06:22:31,340 --> 06:22:33,340
the one with no heals

5098
06:22:33,340 --> 06:22:35,340
I don't know why he randomly

5099
06:22:35,340 --> 06:22:37,340
targeted me

5100
06:22:39,340 --> 06:22:41,340

5101
06:22:43,340 --> 06:22:45,340
killer

5102
06:22:45,340 --> 06:22:47,340
everyone else playing an action

5103
06:22:49,340 --> 06:22:51,340
oh that was such a hard fight

5104
06:22:51,340 --> 06:22:53,340
I'm so glad I managed to clutch that up

5105
06:22:53,340 --> 06:22:55,340
I got a bit nerve wracking

5106
06:22:55,340 --> 06:22:57,340
there I got a bit nerve wracking

5107
06:22:57,340 --> 06:22:59,340
but I managed to clutch up and get the last hit

5108
06:22:59,340 --> 06:23:01,340
and thank goodness

5109
06:23:01,340 --> 06:23:03,340

5110
06:23:03,340 --> 06:23:05,340

5111
06:23:09,340 --> 06:23:11,340
oh life is good

5112
06:23:15,340 --> 06:23:17,340
we changed something in the stars anyway

5113
06:23:17,340 --> 06:23:19,340
by doing that

5114
06:23:19,340 --> 06:23:21,340
is that Rani doing that

5115
06:23:25,340 --> 06:23:27,340
I don't remember them

5116
06:23:31,340 --> 06:23:33,340
he was holding

5117
06:23:33,340 --> 06:23:35,340
all the stars in place

5118
06:23:35,340 --> 06:23:37,340
at a sheer force of will

5119
06:23:45,340 --> 06:23:47,340
he was holding the stars in place

5120
06:23:47,340 --> 06:23:49,340
so now that he's dead the stars can move

5121
06:23:49,340 --> 06:23:51,340
oh he like paused

5122
06:23:51,340 --> 06:23:53,340

5132
06:24:25,340 --> 06:24:27,340

5133
06:24:27,340 --> 06:24:29,340

5137
06:24:45,340 --> 06:24:47,340
is it back over here

5138
06:24:47,340 --> 06:24:49,340
where's the fucking log

5139
06:24:49,340 --> 06:24:51,340
yeah it's like back this way

5140
06:24:51,340 --> 06:24:53,340
so underground on the map

5141
06:24:55,340 --> 06:24:57,340
I need to get out of this area

5142
06:24:57,340 --> 06:24:59,340
because it's not like

5143
06:24:59,340 --> 06:25:01,340
the telepore out

5144
06:25:01,340 --> 06:25:03,340
I don't know

5145
06:25:03,340 --> 06:25:05,340
the wee telepore thing here

5146
06:25:05,340 --> 06:25:07,340
right

5147
06:25:07,340 --> 06:25:09,340
the telepore thing I thought it was right there

5148
06:25:09,340 --> 06:25:11,340
it is right here

5149
06:25:11,340 --> 06:25:13,340
huh

5150
06:25:13,340 --> 06:25:15,340

5151
06:25:15,340 --> 06:25:17,340
they didn't just say I can't

5152
06:25:17,340 --> 06:25:19,340
can't travel to a great site

5153
06:25:21,340 --> 06:25:23,340
can I get that

5154
06:25:25,340 --> 06:25:27,340

5155
06:25:27,340 --> 06:25:29,340
oops sorry

5157
06:25:31,340 --> 06:25:33,340
blamed like a diamond

5158
06:25:33,340 --> 06:25:35,340
because we didn't have eyes

5159
06:25:35,340 --> 06:25:37,340
is that all there

5160
06:25:37,340 --> 06:25:39,340
hey tauren

5161
06:25:39,340 --> 06:25:41,340

5162
06:25:41,340 --> 06:25:43,340
and that isn't from the sky

5163
06:25:43,340 --> 06:25:45,340
tell me okay

5164
06:25:45,340 --> 06:25:47,340

5166
06:25:49,340 --> 06:25:51,340

5167
06:25:53,340 --> 06:25:55,340

5170
06:25:59,340 --> 06:26:01,340
huh

5171
06:26:01,340 --> 06:26:03,340
what a sick way to fight

5172
06:26:03,340 --> 06:26:05,340
a mate the glory of the class is shared

5173
06:26:05,340 --> 06:26:07,340
by radhan

5174
06:26:07,340 --> 06:26:09,340
and you

5175
06:26:09,340 --> 06:26:11,340
and then a falling star

5176
06:26:11,340 --> 06:26:13,340
right before her eyes

5177
06:26:13,340 --> 06:26:15,340
I can't fathom how radhan was holding back

5178
06:26:15,340 --> 06:26:17,340
something of that scale

5179
06:26:17,340 --> 06:26:19,340
if ever I saw one

5180
06:26:21,340 --> 06:26:23,340
he has admiration in his voice

5181
06:26:23,340 --> 06:26:25,340
for radhan

5182
06:26:25,340 --> 06:26:27,340
what's that

5183
06:26:27,340 --> 06:26:29,340
hello

5184
06:26:29,340 --> 06:26:31,340

5185
06:26:31,340 --> 06:26:33,340
oh there's like a fathom

5186
06:26:39,340 --> 06:26:41,340
okay and then now

5187
06:26:41,340 --> 06:26:43,340
we can telepore

5188
06:26:43,340 --> 06:26:45,340
underneath the map

5189
06:26:45,340 --> 06:26:47,340
to the cocoon

5190
06:26:51,340 --> 06:26:53,340

5191
06:26:53,340 --> 06:26:55,340

should I level up before

5205
06:27:49,340 --> 06:27:51,340

5206
06:27:51,340 --> 06:27:53,340
I don't know would I need a generic

5207
06:27:53,340 --> 06:27:55,340

5208
06:27:55,340 --> 06:27:57,340

5209
06:27:57,340 --> 06:27:59,340

tier or just pay attention to that

5217
06:28:15,340 --> 06:28:17,340
what I said each

5218
06:28:17,340 --> 06:28:19,340
that's um do you have too much dialogue

5219
06:28:19,340 --> 06:28:21,340
to players they'll just skip over

5220
06:28:21,340 --> 06:28:23,340

5221
06:28:23,340 --> 06:28:25,340

06:28:45,340 --> 06:28:47,340
an arsenal charm

5226
06:28:47,340 --> 06:28:49,340
what do you do

5227
06:28:53,340 --> 06:28:55,340
raises maximum equipment while that

5228
06:28:55,340 --> 06:28:57,340

5229
06:28:57,340 --> 06:28:59,340
go fast roll still

5230
06:28:59,340 --> 06:29:01,340
there's getting ready to be mean to me

5231
06:29:01,340 --> 06:29:03,340
upgrade your weapons and fluff

5232
06:29:05,340 --> 06:29:07,340
normal smithing stones are 1 to 8

5233
06:29:07,340 --> 06:29:09,340
you need 12 for each

5234
06:29:09,340 --> 06:29:11,340
pair of weapons

5235
06:29:13,340 --> 06:29:15,340

06:29:33,340 --> 06:29:35,340
no

5241
06:29:35,340 --> 06:29:37,340
do I level them up equally

5242
06:29:37,340 --> 06:29:39,340
or just try and do one big

5243
06:29:43,340 --> 06:29:45,340
just focus on one at a time

5244
06:29:45,340 --> 06:29:47,340
okay

5245
06:29:51,340 --> 06:29:53,340
okay additional items required

5246
06:29:53,340 --> 06:29:55,340
I need smithing stones here

5247
06:29:55,340 --> 06:29:57,340
uh I don't know who

5248
06:29:57,340 --> 06:29:59,340
does any of that

5249
06:29:59,340 --> 06:30:01,340
uh

5250
06:30:01,340 --> 06:30:03,340
right

5251
06:30:03,340 --> 06:30:05,340
someone said focus on getting

5252
06:30:05,340 --> 06:30:07,340
seeds

5253
06:30:07,340 --> 06:30:09,340
um

5254
06:30:09,340 --> 06:30:11,340
if we want to get seeds

5255
06:30:13,340 --> 06:30:15,340
I'm gonna pretend

5256
06:30:15,340 --> 06:30:17,340
I don't know where to go

5257
06:30:17,340 --> 06:30:19,340
there is a main

5258
06:30:19,340 --> 06:30:21,340
and

5259
06:30:21,340 --> 06:30:23,340
maybe we went to that main

5260
06:30:23,340 --> 06:30:25,340
oh fuck it let's just go into the dlc

5261
06:30:25,340 --> 06:30:27,340
if we get rolled

5262
06:30:27,340 --> 06:30:29,340
we can always come back and like genuinely

5263
06:30:29,340 --> 06:30:31,340
get stuff

5264
06:30:33,340 --> 06:30:35,340
I assume we can come back

5265
06:30:35,340 --> 06:30:37,340
the dlc isn't like a weird instance

5266
06:30:37,340 --> 06:30:39,340
like you can never return to this area

5267
06:30:39,340 --> 06:30:41,340
again type thing surely

5268
06:30:43,340 --> 06:30:45,340
surely that's how it works

5269
06:30:45,340 --> 06:30:47,340
yeah you can come back up there

5270
06:30:49,340 --> 06:30:51,340
let's go let's see what happens

5271
06:30:51,340 --> 06:30:53,340
touch head to the realm of shadows

5272
06:31:13,340 --> 06:31:15,340
oh

5273
06:31:23,340 --> 06:31:25,340
grave site clean

5274
06:31:33,340 --> 06:31:35,340
the tree is dripping madness

5275
06:31:39,340 --> 06:31:41,340
well well well reeflands

5276
06:31:43,340 --> 06:31:45,340
well well well indeed

5277
06:31:45,340 --> 06:31:47,340
just

5278
06:31:47,340 --> 06:31:49,340
okay far we've gotten already

5279
06:31:51,340 --> 06:31:53,340
okay we get invader in

5280
06:31:53,340 --> 06:31:55,340
does that count invaders

5281
06:31:55,340 --> 06:31:57,340
I don't know if I should have done that

5282
06:32:01,340 --> 06:32:03,340
here we go

5283
06:32:03,340 --> 06:32:05,340
uh

5284
06:32:11,340 --> 06:32:13,340
where did the other creeps

5285
06:32:13,340 --> 06:32:15,340
the game is so buggy

5286
06:32:17,340 --> 06:32:19,340
gorgeous view incoming

5287
06:32:21,340 --> 06:32:23,340
look what have we even got a man

5288
06:32:23,340 --> 06:32:25,340
I don't know if you can go on that man

5289
06:32:25,340 --> 06:32:27,340
but still looks good

5290
06:32:27,340 --> 06:32:29,340
the tree looks good

5291
06:32:29,340 --> 06:32:31,340
good

5292
06:32:31,340 --> 06:32:33,340
oh there's like a few kind of temple

5293
06:32:33,340 --> 06:32:35,340
things over there

5294
06:32:35,340 --> 06:32:37,340
hi

5295
06:32:37,340 --> 06:32:39,340
oh no

5296
06:32:39,340 --> 06:32:41,340
because I did the invader

5297
06:32:41,340 --> 06:32:43,340
it got rid of the freaking things

5298
06:32:43,340 --> 06:32:45,340
I don't know why the game does all this stuff

5299
06:32:45,340 --> 06:32:47,340
are you praying

5300
06:32:47,340 --> 06:32:49,340
you want to

5301
06:32:49,340 --> 06:32:51,340
oh your butt cheeks are heavy madame

5302
06:32:51,340 --> 06:32:53,340
would you like us to hold them

5303
06:32:53,340 --> 06:32:55,340
yes you may

5304
06:32:55,340 --> 06:32:57,340
sorry

5305
06:32:57,340 --> 06:32:59,340
for that

5306
06:33:03,340 --> 06:33:05,340
wait why is it

5307
06:33:11,340 --> 06:33:13,340
wait why is there another second weeping

5308
06:33:13,340 --> 06:33:15,340
coming in

5309
06:33:15,340 --> 06:33:17,340
I think it's like bugging out

5310
06:33:17,340 --> 06:33:19,340
yes don't use a gorgeous movie

5311
06:33:19,340 --> 06:33:21,340
oh shit

5312
06:33:21,340 --> 06:33:23,340
he's still buff

5313
06:33:23,340 --> 06:33:25,340
I think it may

5314
06:33:25,340 --> 06:33:27,340
I'm not sure

5315
06:33:27,340 --> 06:33:29,340
but

5316
06:33:29,340 --> 06:33:31,340
we certainly seem to be having summoning issues

5317
06:33:31,340 --> 06:33:33,340
but

5318
06:33:33,340 --> 06:33:35,340
it's all we can do

5319
06:33:35,340 --> 06:33:37,340
is it worth jewel wielding them by the way

5320
06:33:37,340 --> 06:33:39,340
I don't know

5321
06:33:39,340 --> 06:33:41,340
is it

5322
06:33:41,340 --> 06:33:43,340
wow

5323
06:33:43,340 --> 06:33:45,340
I mean I wouldn't want to

5324
06:33:45,340 --> 06:33:47,340
be in the wrath of me

5325
06:33:47,340 --> 06:33:49,340
do something like that

5326
06:33:55,340 --> 06:33:57,340
with 99 strength

5327
06:33:57,340 --> 06:33:59,340

5372
06:35:49,340 --> 06:35:51,340

5374
06:35:57,340 --> 06:35:59,340
are we all just guessing here

5375
06:35:59,340 --> 06:36:01,340
oh there's the map

5376
06:36:01,340 --> 06:36:03,340
oh there's like an actual town

5377
06:36:03,340 --> 06:36:05,340
you never see that

5378
06:36:07,340 --> 06:36:09,340
wow

5379
06:36:11,340 --> 06:36:13,340
imagine if we had a refling village

5380
06:36:13,340 --> 06:36:15,340
shit

5381
06:36:17,340 --> 06:36:19,340
what would we do in a refling village

5382
06:36:19,340 --> 06:36:21,340
we'd have a tavern

5383
06:36:21,340 --> 06:36:23,340
go this way

5384
06:36:23,340 --> 06:36:25,340
hello mister

5385
06:36:25,340 --> 06:36:27,340
are you okay

5386
06:36:27,340 --> 06:36:29,340
everyone burnt a cinders

5387
06:36:29,340 --> 06:36:31,340
burned away

5388
06:36:31,340 --> 06:36:33,340
put to the touch

5389
06:36:33,340 --> 06:36:35,340
put to the torch by mesmer and his lot

5390
06:36:35,340 --> 06:36:37,340
what did we do to deserve such a fate

5391
06:36:37,340 --> 06:36:39,340
we merely lived our lives

5392
06:36:39,340 --> 06:36:41,340
we lived in peace

5393
06:36:41,340 --> 06:36:43,340
oh no this whole place burned

5394
06:36:43,340 --> 06:36:45,340
are these enemies

5395
06:36:45,340 --> 06:36:47,340
oh they are

5396
06:36:47,340 --> 06:36:49,340
what did they do

5397
06:36:49,340 --> 06:36:51,340
did they just fight

5398
06:36:53,340 --> 06:36:55,340
why are you aggressive

5399
06:36:55,340 --> 06:36:57,340
don't be aggressive

5400
06:36:59,340 --> 06:37:01,340
fun fact a big theme in this DLC

5401
06:37:01,340 --> 06:37:03,340
is rebirth and that

5402
06:37:03,340 --> 06:37:05,340
and that enemy you killed and it's perfect

5403
06:37:05,340 --> 06:37:07,340
some weapon when you view it from the front

5404
06:37:07,340 --> 06:37:09,340
looks like it's the structure of a woman

5405
06:37:09,340 --> 06:37:11,340
oh

5406
06:37:11,340 --> 06:37:13,340
I love a bit of fanny

5407
06:37:13,340 --> 06:37:15,340
inspiration as well

5408
06:37:15,340 --> 06:37:17,340
not bad

5409
06:37:19,340 --> 06:37:21,340
I'm sorry I don't know why

5410
06:37:21,340 --> 06:37:23,340
I thought that was going to be funnier

5411
06:37:23,340 --> 06:37:25,340
if I said that out loud but that wasn't funny

5412
06:37:25,340 --> 06:37:27,340
that was just weird

5413
06:37:27,340 --> 06:37:29,340
I'm sorry I delivered that really bizarrely

5414
06:37:29,340 --> 06:37:31,340
it was supposed to be a joke

5415
06:37:31,340 --> 06:37:33,340
but I think my voice was a bit

5416
06:37:33,340 --> 06:37:35,340
too monotone to explain

5417
06:37:35,340 --> 06:37:37,340
that I was joking during that

5418
06:37:37,340 --> 06:37:39,340
I'm sorry

5419
06:37:47,340 --> 06:37:49,340
that was good

5420
06:37:49,340 --> 06:37:51,340
where do we

5421
06:37:51,340 --> 06:37:53,340
no one knows where it goes

5422
06:37:57,340 --> 06:37:59,340
something's supposed to happen

5423
06:37:59,340 --> 06:38:01,340
if we're all literally exploring

5424
06:38:01,340 --> 06:38:03,340
oh no you're going over here

5425
06:38:03,340 --> 06:38:05,340
right we have a torch

5426
06:38:05,340 --> 06:38:07,340
that means you actually know where you're going

5427
06:38:07,340 --> 06:38:09,340
we'll do that

5428
06:38:11,340 --> 06:38:13,340
I'm fricking too short

5429
06:38:15,340 --> 06:38:17,340
I'm too small I can't reach

5430
06:38:21,340 --> 06:38:23,340
wow

5431
06:38:23,340 --> 06:38:25,340
like robes

5432
06:38:25,340 --> 06:38:27,340
can I climb the robes

5433
06:38:29,340 --> 06:38:31,340
kind of

5434
06:38:31,340 --> 06:38:33,340
I'm not going the wrong way

5435
06:38:33,340 --> 06:38:35,340
I'm getting distracted

5436
06:38:35,340 --> 06:38:37,340
I've just never been here before

5437
06:38:39,340 --> 06:38:41,340
okay follow the rea

5438
06:38:41,340 --> 06:38:43,340
follow the torch if you have a torch

5439
06:38:43,340 --> 06:38:45,340
I know it means you know where to go

5440
06:38:45,340 --> 06:38:47,340
if none of us have a torch

5441
06:38:47,340 --> 06:38:49,340
then it means we're just sending it

5442
06:38:49,340 --> 06:38:51,340
okay

5443
06:38:51,340 --> 06:38:53,340
I vote for the clueless squid to leave

5444
06:38:53,340 --> 06:38:55,340
well the first time I played this game

5445
06:38:55,340 --> 06:38:57,340
I ended up wandering in a kaolin

5446
06:38:57,340 --> 06:38:59,340
it felt like part of the section

5447
06:38:59,340 --> 06:39:01,340
you're fricking mad

5448
06:39:01,340 --> 06:39:03,340
time

5449
06:39:03,340 --> 06:39:05,340
I got not resist

5450
06:39:15,340 --> 06:39:17,340
okay a little bit of parkour in the town

5451
06:39:17,340 --> 06:39:19,340
don't mind

5452
06:39:19,340 --> 06:39:21,340
I love what you've done with this place

5453
06:39:21,340 --> 06:39:23,340
honestly none of you has told me you were stone masons

5454
06:39:23,340 --> 06:39:25,340
but look at this architecture

5455
06:39:25,340 --> 06:39:27,340
I mean look at the

5456
06:39:27,340 --> 06:39:29,340
love and the detail that's been put into this

5457
06:39:29,340 --> 06:39:31,340
what's happening

5458
06:39:31,340 --> 06:39:33,340
you guys really don't give yourself enough credit

5459
06:39:33,340 --> 06:39:35,340
for how much you do

5460
06:39:35,340 --> 06:39:37,340
I mean look at all the detail

5461
06:39:37,340 --> 06:39:39,340
the words

5462
06:39:41,340 --> 06:39:43,340
go inside

5463
06:39:43,340 --> 06:39:45,340

5464
06:39:47,340 --> 06:39:49,340

5467
06:39:55,340 --> 06:39:57,340
a blade of mercy

5468
06:39:57,340 --> 06:39:59,340
I didn't realize she was in the video game

5469
06:40:01,340 --> 06:40:03,340
let's just check it out just because we can

5470
06:40:03,340 --> 06:40:05,340

5475
06:40:17,340 --> 06:40:19,340
I just wanted to check it out

5476
06:40:19,340 --> 06:40:21,340
oh it's a talisman my pardon

5477
06:40:23,340 --> 06:40:25,340
raises attack power

5478
06:40:25,340 --> 06:40:27,340
after each critical hit

5479
06:40:27,340 --> 06:40:29,340
but it would put me on heavy load

5480
06:40:29,340 --> 06:40:31,340
I need this talisman

06:40:31,340 --> 06:40:33,340

a critical hit

5484
06:40:37,340 --> 06:40:39,340
I don't really hit criticals

5486
06:40:41,340 --> 06:40:43,340

5488
06:40:45,340 --> 06:40:47,340

another replay

5499
06:41:19,340 --> 06:41:21,340

I'm looking at you

5502
06:41:25,340 --> 06:41:27,340
I've got red flesh mushroom

5503
06:41:27,340 --> 06:41:29,340
if you have the torch

5504
06:41:29,340 --> 06:41:31,340
you're leading the way

5505
06:41:31,340 --> 06:41:33,340
because I don't know where the heck I'm going

5506
06:41:35,340 --> 06:41:37,340
mercy's whole thing is

5507
06:41:37,340 --> 06:41:39,340
bleak

5508
06:41:39,340 --> 06:41:41,340
if she was karam

5509
06:41:41,340 --> 06:41:43,340
you know actually

5510
06:41:43,340 --> 06:41:45,340

5511
06:41:45,340 --> 06:41:47,340
her custom

5512
06:41:47,340 --> 06:41:49,340
toggle

5513
06:41:49,340 --> 06:41:51,340
her unique thing

5514
06:41:51,340 --> 06:41:53,340
like she can put her hands on her face

5515
06:41:53,340 --> 06:41:55,340
oh look at that

5516
06:41:55,340 --> 06:41:57,340
I don't want to go against it

5517
06:41:57,340 --> 06:41:59,340
but look at it though

5518
06:42:03,340 --> 06:42:05,340
oh my god

5519
06:42:13,340 --> 06:42:15,340
hope it doesn't have a big aoe

5520
06:42:15,340 --> 06:42:17,340
excuse me mr. sheep

5521
06:42:17,340 --> 06:42:19,340
face it

5522
06:42:19,340 --> 06:42:21,340
no I'm just scared

5523
06:42:21,340 --> 06:42:23,340
oh my

5524
06:42:23,340 --> 06:42:25,340
okay

5525
06:42:27,340 --> 06:42:29,340
we're learning the new enemies

5526
06:42:29,340 --> 06:42:31,340
we're getting familiar

5527
06:42:31,340 --> 06:42:33,340
got a lot of enemies

5528
06:42:35,340 --> 06:42:37,340
I might need to drop a loaf of bread

5529
06:42:37,340 --> 06:42:39,340
I'm not joking

5530
06:42:39,340 --> 06:42:41,340
my tummy

5531
06:42:41,340 --> 06:42:43,340
I should have started stealing

5532
06:42:43,340 --> 06:42:45,340
a bit of loaf of bread

5533
06:42:45,340 --> 06:42:47,340
I'm feeling heavy

5534
06:42:47,340 --> 06:42:49,340
it's up to being killed by the witch

5535
06:42:51,340 --> 06:42:53,340
the thing is all aoe

5536
06:42:53,340 --> 06:42:55,340
honestly

5537
06:42:59,340 --> 06:43:01,340
oh these are where the wiggly worms are

5538
06:43:01,340 --> 06:43:03,340
that's on the menu

5539
06:43:05,340 --> 06:43:07,340
okay

5540
06:43:11,340 --> 06:43:13,340
bite it anyway

5541
06:43:13,340 --> 06:43:15,340
even if it's friendly

5542
06:43:15,340 --> 06:43:17,340
nothing is friendly in this game

5543
06:43:17,340 --> 06:43:19,340
are you praying to the wiggly worm

5544
06:43:19,340 --> 06:43:21,340
oh wiggly worm

5545
06:43:21,340 --> 06:43:23,340
oh my god look at it

5546
06:43:23,340 --> 06:43:25,340
oh no

5547
06:43:25,340 --> 06:43:27,340
it's face

5548
06:43:27,340 --> 06:43:29,340
oh

5549
06:43:29,340 --> 06:43:31,340
it was going so well

5550
06:43:31,340 --> 06:43:33,340
for your design

5551
06:43:33,340 --> 06:43:35,340
that's unfortunate

5552
06:43:35,340 --> 06:43:37,340
that face is unfortunate

5553
06:43:37,340 --> 06:43:39,340
the cuteness factor

5554
06:43:39,340 --> 06:43:41,340
may not have gone down after that

5555
06:43:41,340 --> 06:43:43,340
aoe

5556
06:43:43,340 --> 06:43:45,340
a little thingy

5557
06:43:45,340 --> 06:43:47,340
sorry I'm getting distracted

5558
06:43:49,340 --> 06:43:51,340
looks like a fight would occur here

5559
06:43:51,340 --> 06:43:53,340
yep there's definitely a fight

5560
06:43:53,340 --> 06:43:55,340
because look at this

5561
06:43:55,340 --> 06:43:57,340
statues and stuff

5562
06:43:57,340 --> 06:43:59,340
well

5563
06:44:01,340 --> 06:44:03,340
oh we're getting blessed up

5564
06:44:03,340 --> 06:44:05,340
okay

5565
06:44:05,340 --> 06:44:07,340
okay

5566
06:44:07,340 --> 06:44:09,340
it's a fight in the DLC

5567
06:44:09,340 --> 06:44:11,340
our first proper fight

5568
06:44:11,340 --> 06:44:13,340
let's see what happens

5569
06:44:13,340 --> 06:44:15,340
it's a crypt

5570
06:44:15,340 --> 06:44:17,340
it's a crypt

5571
06:44:17,340 --> 06:44:19,340
we've done crypts before

5572
06:44:19,340 --> 06:44:21,340
it's just a knight

5573
06:44:23,340 --> 06:44:25,340
I'm pretty sure crossbow bolts

5574
06:44:25,340 --> 06:44:27,340
are only supposed to have one

5575
06:44:27,340 --> 06:44:29,340
thing on them

5576
06:44:29,340 --> 06:44:31,340
oh my god for a knight

5577
06:44:31,340 --> 06:44:33,340
he is so quick

5578
06:44:37,340 --> 06:44:39,340
he

5579
06:44:43,340 --> 06:44:45,340
I don't even get stuck

5580
06:44:53,340 --> 06:44:55,340
oh my god

5581
06:44:55,340 --> 06:44:57,340
did you see that

5582
06:45:01,340 --> 06:45:03,340
I need to

5583
06:45:03,340 --> 06:45:05,340
no no no

5584
06:45:07,340 --> 06:45:09,340
no don't do it

5585
06:45:17,340 --> 06:45:19,340
fuck you

5586
06:45:19,340 --> 06:45:21,340
I can kill him on reekland

5587
06:45:21,340 --> 06:45:23,340
and you get out of the way

5588
06:45:23,340 --> 06:45:25,340
sorry I'm out of stamina

5589
06:45:25,340 --> 06:45:27,340
I'm trying to manage my stamina

5590
06:45:27,340 --> 06:45:29,340
but I'm not that smart

5591
06:45:29,340 --> 06:45:31,340
stop it

5592
06:45:31,340 --> 06:45:33,340
oh my god

5593
06:45:33,340 --> 06:45:35,340
I'm out of stamina again

5594
06:45:35,340 --> 06:45:37,340
sorry

5595
06:45:37,340 --> 06:45:39,340
no leave him alone

5596
06:45:49,340 --> 06:45:51,340
ah

5597
06:45:51,340 --> 06:45:53,340
he is so much health strong

5598
06:45:53,340 --> 06:45:55,340
I only upgraded them a little bit

5599
06:45:55,340 --> 06:45:57,340
I think we might have to upgrade them

5600
06:45:59,340 --> 06:46:01,340
how about I let you guys finish him

5601
06:46:01,340 --> 06:46:03,340
off and then I'll go drop a loaf of bread

5602
06:46:03,340 --> 06:46:05,340
and get some snacks

5603
06:46:05,340 --> 06:46:07,340
does that sound like a plan?

5604
06:46:09,340 --> 06:46:11,340
I'll let the reekland finish him

5605
06:46:11,340 --> 06:46:13,340
off and then I'll go drop a loaf of bread

5606
06:46:13,340 --> 06:46:15,340
ok

5607
06:46:15,340 --> 06:46:17,340
surely this is gonna work

5608
06:46:17,340 --> 06:46:19,340
surely

5609
06:46:19,340 --> 06:46:21,340
I don't even know if I need to put you guys under boss fights

5610
06:46:21,340 --> 06:46:23,340
wait who we got

5611
06:46:23,340 --> 06:46:25,340
I could hear that

5612
06:46:25,340 --> 06:46:27,340
I knew I heard that

5613
06:46:27,340 --> 06:46:29,340
boss fights don't count

5614
06:46:31,340 --> 06:46:33,340
uh

5615
06:46:33,340 --> 06:46:35,340
what are you are you melee

5616
06:46:35,340 --> 06:46:37,340
you're big melee

5617
06:46:37,340 --> 06:46:39,340
I don't know

5618
06:46:39,340 --> 06:46:41,340
hmm

5619
06:46:41,340 --> 06:46:43,340
hmm

5620
06:46:43,340 --> 06:46:45,340
the gear diff is pretty hard the DLC is not

5621
06:46:45,340 --> 06:46:47,340
on top of the fact your weapons need upgrades

5622
06:46:47,340 --> 06:46:49,340
there's even more upgrade nonsense which is

5623
06:46:49,340 --> 06:46:51,340
unique to this DLC alone

5624
06:46:51,340 --> 06:46:53,340
oh see another one

5625
06:46:53,340 --> 06:46:55,340
in come in come

5626
06:46:55,340 --> 06:46:57,340
boss fighters in come

5627
06:46:57,340 --> 06:46:59,340
I will be holding back

5628
06:46:59,340 --> 06:47:01,340
because I am

5629
06:47:01,340 --> 06:47:03,340
shy so

5630
06:47:03,340 --> 06:47:05,340
as much as this outfit is absolutely

5631
06:47:05,340 --> 06:47:07,340
stunning and I actually have to put on some armor

5632
06:47:07,340 --> 06:47:09,340
don't worry mommy

5633
06:47:09,340 --> 06:47:11,340
take some sleep

5634
06:47:11,340 --> 06:47:13,340
hmm

5635
06:47:15,340 --> 06:47:17,340
ok not to

5636
06:47:17,340 --> 06:47:19,340
not to make the situation

5637
06:47:19,340 --> 06:47:21,340
critical or anything

5638
06:47:21,340 --> 06:47:23,340
if we fail this one I still

5639
06:47:23,340 --> 06:47:25,340
might have to go drop a loaf of bread

5640
06:47:25,340 --> 06:47:27,340
I'm not saying the situation is critical

5641
06:47:27,340 --> 06:47:29,340
but it's not good right now it's not good

5642
06:47:29,340 --> 06:47:31,340
it's not good

5643
06:47:31,340 --> 06:47:33,340
King Kong's fingers pushing ok

5644
06:47:33,340 --> 06:47:35,340
right let's go let's go let's get this

5645
06:47:35,340 --> 06:47:37,340
done

5646
06:47:37,340 --> 06:47:39,340
oh my my my

5647
06:47:39,340 --> 06:47:41,340
I'm just gonna hide in the corner

5648
06:47:41,340 --> 06:47:43,340
and he can shoot at me

5649
06:47:49,340 --> 06:47:51,340
ok come on refling

5650
06:47:51,340 --> 06:47:53,340
we got two melee he has so much

5651
06:47:53,340 --> 06:47:55,340
like

5652
06:47:55,340 --> 06:47:57,340
oh ok ok we have a crit

5653
06:47:57,340 --> 06:47:59,340
we have a crit fantastic

5654
06:47:59,340 --> 06:48:01,340
oh we have like sword art

5655
06:48:01,340 --> 06:48:03,340
blood dancing

5656
06:48:03,340 --> 06:48:05,340
sword blood dancing

5657
06:48:05,340 --> 06:48:07,340
but magic being cast

5658
06:48:07,340 --> 06:48:09,340
sometimes missing

5659
06:48:09,340 --> 06:48:11,340
it's not possible to always hit the

5660
06:48:11,340 --> 06:48:13,340
avocado

5661
06:48:13,340 --> 06:48:15,340
abracadabra

5662
06:48:19,340 --> 06:48:21,340
oh no one refling might be down

5663
06:48:21,340 --> 06:48:23,340
possibly the aggro swaps

5664
06:48:23,340 --> 06:48:25,340
the refling can heal up the aggro was

5665
06:48:25,340 --> 06:48:27,340
swapped

5666
06:48:27,340 --> 06:48:29,340
successfully

5667
06:48:29,340 --> 06:48:31,340
we are down to

5668
06:48:31,340 --> 06:48:33,340
just shy of 50% boss health

5669
06:48:33,340 --> 06:48:35,340
does this boss have a face to it

5670
06:48:35,340 --> 06:48:37,340
unlikely due to the fact

5671
06:48:37,340 --> 06:48:39,340
he's in a crypt

5672
06:48:39,340 --> 06:48:41,340
I might have to do it

5673
06:48:41,340 --> 06:48:43,340
I think I might need to help

5674
06:48:43,340 --> 06:48:45,340
oh my god he's still low

5675
06:48:45,340 --> 06:48:47,340
wait

5676
06:48:47,340 --> 06:48:49,340
what's going on

5677
06:48:49,340 --> 06:48:51,340
wait he healed up

5678
06:48:51,340 --> 06:48:53,340
only we're allowed to heal up

5679
06:48:53,340 --> 06:48:55,340
you don't know the rules around these parts

5680
06:48:55,340 --> 06:48:57,340
stinky

5681
06:48:57,340 --> 06:48:59,340
smelly

5682
06:48:59,340 --> 06:49:01,340
and you don't have a tongue scraper

5683
06:49:05,340 --> 06:49:07,340
ok

5684
06:49:07,340 --> 06:49:09,340
I'm gonna go take a cheeky fat loa for bread

5685
06:49:09,340 --> 06:49:11,340
we will be back

5686
06:49:11,340 --> 06:49:13,340
and we will defeat this boss

5687
06:49:13,340 --> 06:49:15,340
I have faith in the refling so I know you guys can do it

5688
06:49:15,340 --> 06:49:17,340
I did

5689
06:49:17,340 --> 06:49:19,340
sorry

5690
06:49:19,340 --> 06:49:21,340
I will be back in a couple of minutes

5691
06:49:21,340 --> 06:49:23,340
give me a few minutes and then I'll

5692
06:49:23,340 --> 06:49:25,340
heat up my food and then we'll do a little

5693
06:49:25,340 --> 06:49:27,340
eating whilst the refling

5694
06:49:27,340 --> 06:49:29,340
absolutely wallop this man's

5695
06:49:29,340 --> 06:49:31,340
booty hole for me

5696
06:49:31,340 --> 06:49:33,340
yes I'm dropping every toothbrush has a tongue

5697
06:49:33,340 --> 06:49:35,340
scraper on the back side

5698
06:49:35,340 --> 06:49:37,340
not electrical

5699
06:49:37,340 --> 06:49:39,340
toothbrushes

5700
06:49:39,340 --> 06:49:41,340
I'm gonna crouch surely I'm not gonna be in

5701
06:49:41,340 --> 06:49:43,340
trouble if I just afk

5702
06:49:43,340 --> 06:49:45,340

07:08:13,340 --> 07:08:15,340
So he has a flash that heals about

07:08:54,060 --> 07:08:56,060

07:08:59,340 --> 07:09:01,340
My dead body's gonna be

5888
07:09:01,340 --> 07:09:03,340
Oh

5889
07:09:13,180 --> 07:09:15,180

07:09:15,180 --> 07:09:18,220
Hold on I'm out of stamina hold on any heel if I was domino

5891
07:09:20,940 --> 07:09:22,940
Okay, wait is it even for you

5892
07:09:30,060 --> 07:09:32,060
Fuck a mom

5893
07:09:32,540 --> 07:09:37,020
Oh, shit. I'm hitting the wall. Sorry. I'm hitting the wall. Oh my god. I'm already hit the wall. I can't believe it

5894
07:09:38,060 --> 07:09:40,060
I'm only walk three week old

5895
07:09:41,020 --> 07:09:45,820
Oh sugar, I just took damage for that. Oh my god. I'm out of heels. Oh

5896
07:09:46,700 --> 07:09:48,860
Oh, no, I'm overzealous in my actions. Uh

5897
07:09:49,340 --> 07:09:52,780
Refling you might have to take this away. Refling you might have to do the rest

5898
07:09:54,300 --> 07:09:56,300
Unless I go for it. Fuck you

5899
07:09:56,620 --> 07:10:02,700
Okay, we did a bit of damage. We did a bit of damage. Okay. I've taken aggro. This is terrible. I yee. Oh, how did I dodge that?

5900
07:10:02,700 --> 07:10:04,700
How did I dodge that? I don't know

5901
07:10:05,500 --> 07:10:07,500
Uh, I wasn't really wanting to take aggro

5902
07:10:08,060 --> 07:10:10,060
But I'll take it

5903
07:10:11,420 --> 07:10:14,620
Oh, this is for refling. If I can take some of the aggro

5904
07:10:15,500 --> 07:10:16,940
Oh

5905
07:10:16,940 --> 07:10:20,460
Oh, he's so close. Fucking gangfiles. Yes

5906
07:10:22,060 --> 07:10:28,220
I mean, thanks. You did it. You did amazing. Thank you so much. You did it. We did it. We did it

5907
07:10:29,100 --> 07:10:34,940
See if I wasn't a pussy. Whoo great sort of solitude not to be confused with

5908
07:10:35,740 --> 07:10:38,380
Oh, wait, should I take all of this and put it on?

5909
07:10:40,860 --> 07:10:42,860
Should I put all that stuff on?

5910
07:10:43,820 --> 07:10:49,820
What was it? Is it like way better? Oh, no, this can't be. It's like way better

5911
07:10:51,260 --> 07:10:53,100
Oh

5912
07:10:53,100 --> 07:10:55,900
It's too heavy. I have an amulet

5913
07:10:59,500 --> 07:11:01,500
I have an amulet that like

5914
07:11:05,660 --> 07:11:07,660
Oh, no, I'm a heavy ruler

5915
07:11:16,780 --> 07:11:18,780
Take off one of the great swords

5916
07:11:22,780 --> 07:11:24,780
No, no, I'm still a heavy boy

5917
07:11:26,140 --> 07:11:28,140
Uh

5918
07:11:28,220 --> 07:11:33,660
I mean in the nicest way when I have you guys to help me doesn't matter if I'm heavy

5919
07:11:35,180 --> 07:11:37,580
What level is your crimson class? Uh zero

5920
07:11:39,340 --> 07:11:41,340
The heavy rule kind of epic though

5921
07:11:43,580 --> 07:11:47,180
If I have the reforms to protect me, ooh, what do you use? It's a crypt

5922
07:11:47,900 --> 07:11:50,620
First off. Well done. By the way, praise the message

5923
07:11:51,260 --> 07:11:54,700
Fine. I'll praise it. Are you applaud? Yeah, fine

5924
07:11:55,500 --> 07:11:57,500
Wait, it's good. Sure

5925
07:11:58,860 --> 07:12:02,780
Heavy mummy the big cake roll. Yeah, we're in big cake territory

5926
07:12:03,660 --> 07:12:09,500
The rule is important for you to dodge that. Oh, no, you're kind of spitting the truth. They're not going

5927
07:12:11,420 --> 07:12:16,460
Oh, everything's such a downgrade on defense like I know why it's a downgrade on defense

5928
07:12:17,180 --> 07:12:19,500
Right if we start tell you what if we struggle

5929
07:12:20,700 --> 07:12:25,660
Um one adversary. Oh wait, I'm an idiot. Sorry adversary takes a week

5930
07:12:28,220 --> 07:12:30,220
Um and you come

5931
07:12:30,220 --> 07:12:32,220
Um

5932
07:12:35,740 --> 07:12:37,660
And then

5933
07:12:37,660 --> 07:12:39,660
Have you explored with me?

5934
07:12:39,740 --> 07:12:43,580
You I know you've explored with me, but I don't think you got a chance to explore with me

5935
07:12:45,660 --> 07:12:47,260
I do

5936
07:12:47,260 --> 07:12:52,460
Only a downgrade if you get hit five heads five heads, right? I should actually eat and get distracted

5937
07:13:00,940 --> 07:13:02,940
Yeah

5938
07:13:04,460 --> 07:13:06,460
Wow, yummy

5939
07:13:09,740 --> 07:13:11,740
I don't know who's gonna come in

5940
07:13:12,700 --> 07:13:14,700
Look outside

5941
07:13:15,980 --> 07:13:17,980
He didn't work

5942
07:13:20,460 --> 07:13:26,060
What do you mean the servers are overloaded because they just they're loaded they just they're not uh, they just

5943
07:13:27,260 --> 07:13:29,260
Publish removed

5944
07:13:30,940 --> 07:13:32,940
Hmm

5945
07:13:36,460 --> 07:13:38,460
You're praising them

5946
07:13:40,860 --> 07:13:44,300
Personal as to just trying that guy's sorry. Oh, you may change the story

5947
07:13:49,900 --> 07:13:51,900
Oh

5948
07:14:00,220 --> 07:14:02,220
You

5949
07:14:08,540 --> 07:14:10,540
Don't be like by my dumpy

5950
07:14:12,060 --> 07:14:14,060
I couldn't do that

5951
07:14:14,220 --> 07:14:16,220
I don't go down

5952
07:14:17,260 --> 07:14:20,060
You'll go down and I do it. I do the animation

5953
07:14:24,700 --> 07:14:26,700
Oh shit, sorry. Oh, let's forget that

5954
07:14:31,180 --> 07:14:34,300
I may be easier for me to upgrade this new item

5955
07:14:37,180 --> 07:14:39,180
Um

5956
07:14:45,260 --> 07:14:47,820
Oh, no, it's actually better. Oh no, this can't be

5957
07:14:54,700 --> 07:14:57,900
Oh as a faster swing, I think or am I just making the off

5958
07:14:58,860 --> 07:15:00,860
I might have a faster swing

5959
07:15:02,140 --> 07:15:07,500
Okay, I follow you guys whilst I munch, okay? There's so many beans in one section

5960
07:15:20,460 --> 07:15:22,460
Easier to upgrade at this stage, yes

5961
07:15:23,420 --> 07:15:25,420
Now that I'm doing oh, sorry, sorry

5962
07:15:38,460 --> 07:15:40,460
Oh, no, I didn't get my class back

5963
07:15:43,740 --> 07:15:45,740
Oh, I've got our class back

5964
07:15:45,740 --> 07:15:47,740
Oh

5965
07:15:51,020 --> 07:15:53,020
It's hard to eat

5966
07:15:58,540 --> 07:16:01,340
It's yummy food, so I hope you guys have eaten and hydrated

5967
07:16:02,220 --> 07:16:04,220
Is

5968
07:16:18,940 --> 07:16:20,940
Oh, you can't use it, okay

5969
07:16:23,020 --> 07:16:25,020
I'll go in a second

5970
07:16:25,740 --> 07:16:27,740
Sorry

5971
07:16:28,140 --> 07:16:30,140
If I could eat in one bite I would

5972
07:16:31,340 --> 07:16:33,340
But

5973
07:16:46,300 --> 07:16:48,300
Yeah

5974
07:16:55,260 --> 07:16:57,260
Drop your other side to the tree today

5975
07:16:58,220 --> 07:17:00,220
Oh

5976
07:17:06,620 --> 07:17:11,900
No, that was a refland in the game. He's clapping. It's not me. I swear

5977
07:17:13,900 --> 07:17:15,900
I'm too busy trying to eat

5978
07:17:17,500 --> 07:17:22,540
I can't eat that fat. Well, I can't eat fast, but I can't like talk and eat fast

5979
07:17:28,220 --> 07:17:35,340
People who hate eating sounds hate this one beat you go find out why about clicking this video

5980
07:17:42,540 --> 07:17:46,220
And you've actually walked around the rocks because I can't jump right now

5981
07:17:49,180 --> 07:17:56,060
Are you fighting in the ooh, what are you? Hello? Oh, I need a jump up hold on. Uh, I need to do this with one hand

5982
07:17:56,860 --> 07:17:58,700
Pick up item

5983
07:17:58,700 --> 07:18:00,700
reverend stirrash

5984
07:18:01,980 --> 07:18:03,980
Hmm

5985
07:18:06,780 --> 07:18:08,780
Light in the way

5986
07:18:10,140 --> 07:18:12,140
I don't know how I'm able to do this right now

5987
07:18:26,780 --> 07:18:28,780
Oh

5988
07:18:31,740 --> 07:18:39,900
I can only I only like your sense. Can you not tolerate it anywhere else? You can only handle the happy cuttlefish munching sounds

5989
07:18:46,380 --> 07:18:49,100
Hmm it's funny because

5990
07:18:49,660 --> 07:18:56,780
My mouth is closed, but if my jaw goes low enough like when I like I'm chewing food when my jaw goes low enough

5991
07:18:56,860 --> 07:19:00,700
My mouth opens on my model. There we go. I've washed it already

5992
07:19:00,700 --> 07:19:02,700
Already

5993
07:19:18,140 --> 07:19:20,140
Hmm

5994
07:19:20,620 --> 07:19:24,620
I don't know if smacking food is uh, are you okay?

5995
07:19:26,300 --> 07:19:28,300
He doesn't do anything

5996
07:19:28,620 --> 07:19:30,620
He is an enemy

5997
07:19:32,220 --> 07:19:34,220
But he doesn't respond to anything

5998
07:19:36,060 --> 07:19:39,180
I think um smacking food is a learned behavior

5999
07:19:40,380 --> 07:19:42,380
I suppose others we mushroom here

6000
07:19:51,580 --> 07:19:54,140
God this graveyard is it you never end them

6001
07:19:54,860 --> 07:19:57,740
You'll lighten up around here. She should probably

6002
07:20:14,780 --> 07:20:16,780
There is more food hiding under my natural

6003
07:20:19,340 --> 07:20:22,140
I don't want to waste the food because this is all the food I got right now

6004
07:20:25,020 --> 07:20:27,020
Oh

6005
07:20:32,940 --> 07:20:35,820
No, can you guys get him for me?

6006
07:20:42,700 --> 07:20:46,220
I'll be out here you two just go on ahead and have fun, okay

6007
07:20:47,580 --> 07:20:49,580
Me and the rival

6008
07:20:51,580 --> 07:20:53,580
Just be checking it out

6009
07:20:54,380 --> 07:20:56,380
All right. No, he's getting there

6010
07:21:04,540 --> 07:21:06,540
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

6011
07:21:11,660 --> 07:21:16,140
Uh sat sat do tree fragment

6012
07:21:16,220 --> 07:21:23,020
Uh, okay, I'm to the next I've almost finished eating. I'm so sorry

6013
07:21:33,180 --> 07:21:35,180
We love chicken salad

6014
07:21:35,420 --> 07:21:37,420
Yeah

6015
07:21:44,860 --> 07:21:46,860
That refunds a war crime pride

6016
07:21:50,460 --> 07:21:52,460
Hmm

6017
07:21:52,460 --> 07:21:54,460
Oh

6018
07:22:10,140 --> 07:22:13,340
So violent I follow the torch

6019
07:22:15,500 --> 07:22:18,140
I am a simple woman. I see instructions

6020
07:22:22,780 --> 07:22:30,460
Grumble some chips on top of the salad to have makeshift crouton. I've never enjoyed crouton. I thought they were just dried stale bread or something

6021
07:22:32,780 --> 07:22:34,780
That was my impression of the man

6022
07:22:35,980 --> 07:22:38,620
She says she eats stale naturals, but I don't mean

6023
07:22:47,340 --> 07:22:49,340
Um

6024
07:22:49,660 --> 07:22:53,740
And I keep saying that but we'll play if you were basically

6025
07:22:56,220 --> 07:22:59,980
I'll hurry up. I'll catch up. I'll catch up. I'll run. I'll run

6026
07:23:02,620 --> 07:23:07,100
I just need like what five more nachos and I'm actually done through for real this time

6027
07:23:10,220 --> 07:23:13,740
I'm coming. Just give me a second. I'm coming. I'm coming

6028
07:23:15,020 --> 07:23:17,020
Just a few more nachos

6029
07:23:17,020 --> 07:23:23,020
And this will feel me for the rest of the stream. I honestly thought I was probably only gonna do eight hours

6030
07:23:24,140 --> 07:23:25,500
today

6031
07:23:25,500 --> 07:23:29,340
This will be like, uh, I'm gonna really feel it. I didn't get a good sleep or whatever and then

6032
07:23:30,140 --> 07:23:32,140
classic me since I get on

6033
07:23:34,540 --> 07:23:36,540
I can't have enough

6034
07:23:40,940 --> 07:23:45,100
Oh, Jim's day done. Thank you for the super chat. I just saw that there in the notification

6035
07:23:45,820 --> 07:23:47,820
I missed it

6036
07:23:49,020 --> 07:23:54,780
Only eight hours like I know it's a unique concept, but

6037
07:23:56,140 --> 07:23:58,140
I love it, man

6038
07:23:58,940 --> 07:24:04,220
Like we're literally getting princess house through Elden Ring DLC. I have no idea what's going on. I'm happy. I'm smiling

6039
07:24:04,300 --> 07:24:11,740
I'm eating. Hopefully you guys have eaten and hydrated like you guys are literally coming in and I'm like celebrating cheering for you when you

6040
07:24:12,620 --> 07:24:16,860
Oh my god, are they gone? Reeflings? Hello? Hello?

6041
07:24:19,180 --> 07:24:21,180
Over here

6042
07:24:21,820 --> 07:24:24,540
Where the fuck did they go? Oh, all right. Okay. Oh, there we go. Sorry

6043
07:24:29,180 --> 07:24:31,180
Just eight

6044
07:24:31,900 --> 07:24:35,740
As I choke because I'm trying to talk and eat. Sorry. I'm gonna shut up. I'm gonna choke

6045
07:24:42,700 --> 07:24:44,700
I

6046
07:25:00,540 --> 07:25:04,220
The food doesn't disappear it's like more keeps appearing on my bowl

6047
07:25:12,060 --> 07:25:14,060
Hmm

6048
07:25:22,140 --> 07:25:28,060
Do you think when game studios plan something so large they already plan the DLC in mind

6049
07:25:29,260 --> 07:25:34,380
Like this was already in production. Just like it will be like a different that comes out a different timing

6050
07:25:35,980 --> 07:25:39,100
So this is massive like absolutely massive

6051
07:25:42,380 --> 07:25:44,380
Never end them

6052
07:25:50,700 --> 07:25:53,260
I'm getting free souls for every time you guys whack someone

6053
07:25:57,340 --> 07:25:59,340
You got it

6054
07:26:12,700 --> 07:26:17,420
Okay, I'm okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'm I'm getting through it

6055
07:26:29,500 --> 07:26:31,580
I'm swinging. I don't know if I'm hitting anything

6056
07:26:33,900 --> 07:26:37,980
Oh, yeah, we have necronomic effect or something

6057
07:26:42,700 --> 07:26:46,220
I'm fucking swinging. Oh, I've only got one shoulder

6058
07:27:07,100 --> 07:27:09,100
I think we're okay

6059
07:27:10,060 --> 07:27:17,020
I think we're okay. Okay. No, I'm potting. I'm potting. Okay. I'll buy him. What'd I get? I bet

6060
07:27:18,220 --> 07:27:20,940
Okay, I have two more baitfuls. I think um

6061
07:27:21,820 --> 07:27:23,980
And I'm done. I ate

6062
07:27:25,180 --> 07:27:27,180
I hydrated questionable

6063
07:27:28,220 --> 07:27:30,220
Um

6064
07:27:30,220 --> 07:27:32,220
Oh

6065
07:27:45,580 --> 07:27:48,780
And then I I wipe my greasy fingers

6066
07:27:49,500 --> 07:27:53,420
And I we nap him and then I wipe my mouth on the napkin as well

6067
07:27:54,140 --> 07:27:56,140
Hmm

6068
07:27:57,740 --> 07:28:03,420
And then I'm all clean. It's prissy. I think I drink a cola

6069
07:28:06,300 --> 07:28:08,300
I think I drink a warm

6070
07:28:13,900 --> 07:28:15,900
Oh

6071
07:28:17,180 --> 07:28:21,020
I've been DLC on the lunch DLC that you buy layers

6072
07:28:21,100 --> 07:28:25,740
Um, okay, we're ready. I'm like properly in. I'm locked in. Are we ready refunds?

6073
07:28:26,540 --> 07:28:29,580
Let's get a move on. Come on refund. You're gonna get left behind you goober

6074
07:28:29,980 --> 07:28:31,820
Gotta get a move on

6075
07:28:31,820 --> 07:28:33,420
as I say

6076
07:28:33,420 --> 07:28:36,060
As I do a heavy roll follow the light

6077
07:28:37,260 --> 07:28:39,260
Oh, there's like a thing here

6078
07:28:39,420 --> 07:28:41,420
Uh black pry fly

6079
07:28:44,860 --> 07:28:47,100
I have very quiet rupees today

6080
07:28:48,780 --> 07:28:50,780
Oh

6081
07:28:51,100 --> 07:28:53,100
Okay, a little shortcut

6082
07:28:57,180 --> 07:28:59,180
This is an endurance freedom

6083
07:29:01,020 --> 07:29:06,460
It was always gonna be 12 hours. Let's be honest. Let's let's not kid ourselves unless my voice

6084
07:29:07,260 --> 07:29:10,780
quite literally breaks where I cannot speak

6085
07:29:12,220 --> 07:29:14,220
I probably can't stream

6086
07:29:14,380 --> 07:29:19,340
But even then you already know that I'm autistic enough to do hand cam ASMR

6087
07:29:19,980 --> 07:29:25,500
And all you hear is my breathing because I'm just like giggling that everything you guys are saying. Ooh new enemies

6088
07:29:27,580 --> 07:29:29,580
Like

6089
07:29:29,580 --> 07:29:31,580
You know, I can't so

6090
07:29:32,460 --> 07:29:34,780
I'm addicted and I can't get enough

6091
07:29:35,900 --> 07:29:42,060
I've so much lost time to make up for and like it's just like such a good thing and like I'm serious when I say like

6092
07:29:42,620 --> 07:29:48,620
I never feel it's when I click go live live. I don't feel stressed. I don't feel like oh my god

6093
07:29:48,620 --> 07:29:50,620
I need to do xyz like right now

6094
07:29:51,260 --> 07:29:53,260
When I finish this endurance stream

6095
07:29:53,820 --> 07:29:58,060
I need to go edit the audio. That's for patreon and upload it

6096
07:29:58,780 --> 07:30:02,940
And I know that's going to take me over an hour and I know I'm going to be tired but right now

6097
07:30:03,740 --> 07:30:05,500
I feel relaxed

6098
07:30:05,500 --> 07:30:07,500
I'm happy

6099
07:30:07,660 --> 07:30:10,140
I'm chilling someone just got stabbed over there

6100
07:30:11,020 --> 07:30:13,020
Are we beating up birds now?

6101
07:30:13,340 --> 07:30:15,340
We are

6102
07:30:15,580 --> 07:30:17,580
The most friendly bird in Australia

6103
07:30:19,260 --> 07:30:22,460
Right, what am I supposed to do with these swords? I'm supposed to take something all

6104
07:30:23,420 --> 07:30:25,420
Right, oh god by the time

6105
07:30:25,420 --> 07:30:26,300
I'm supposed to do what?

6106
07:30:26,300 --> 07:30:28,300
I'm supposed to take this off

6107
07:30:28,460 --> 07:30:33,260
Have this boy out and then hold y right from 4 to 200

6108
07:30:34,620 --> 07:30:36,620
And then one okay

6109
07:30:36,860 --> 07:30:40,300
I ain't gonna tell you what I was supposed to do. New shot card it mutes Ronnie every time

6110
07:30:41,100 --> 07:30:45,820
She can't tell if she says she gets zapped. Honestly, that would actually be content because I can't even

6111
07:30:49,020 --> 07:30:51,020
I got to do the first thing

6112
07:30:51,900 --> 07:30:53,900
Well, we're going into this cavern

6113
07:30:54,700 --> 07:30:58,620
It's got quite a magnificent entrance. I must say whoever architect this

6114
07:30:59,420 --> 07:31:01,420
I hope you're paying them well because uh

6115
07:31:01,660 --> 07:31:05,740
That is a tourist attraction in a half if that was in real life, you know

6116
07:31:11,020 --> 07:31:13,020
It's

6117
07:31:13,420 --> 07:31:15,420
Oh, there's something glowing

6118
07:31:18,220 --> 07:31:20,220
Wow

6119
07:31:22,780 --> 07:31:28,940
Is it a site of grace, but it's just highlighted more. I'm gonna go crazy. What are you?

6120
07:31:30,380 --> 07:31:32,380
Touch the cross

6121
07:31:32,540 --> 07:31:36,860
Carved words conceal I abandon here the first of the flesh of my body

6122
07:31:41,100 --> 07:31:45,100
Fragment is this mackayla or mackoella?

6123
07:31:47,660 --> 07:31:54,220
Also, don't forget your blue flash so you can do your weapon or or you can change them into more health. Yeah, I think I'm

6124
07:31:55,020 --> 07:31:57,020
Definitely more health

6125
07:31:57,260 --> 07:31:59,980
Wait, why are you clapping because I just oh I need to talk to him

6126
07:32:00,780 --> 07:32:02,780
Lady led a spoke of you

6127
07:32:02,780 --> 07:32:04,540
You're that tarnished

6128
07:32:04,540 --> 07:32:08,940
Guided here by kindly michella. Bloody or be driver question mark. I am freya

6129
07:32:09,820 --> 07:32:11,820
I once fought alongside general redan

6130
07:32:13,420 --> 07:32:15,420
You can be sure I'll hold my own

6131
07:32:21,500 --> 07:32:23,500
One if you've yet to do so

6132
07:32:23,580 --> 07:32:26,140
Have him give you a map of the crosses whereabouts

6133
07:32:26,700 --> 07:32:28,860
You'll find more of them dotted about these lands

6134
07:32:29,500 --> 07:32:31,660
They are michella the kinds footprints

6135
07:32:33,740 --> 07:32:35,740
Um

6136
07:32:35,980 --> 07:32:37,980
Why are you on the floor? Are you okay?

6137
07:32:38,460 --> 07:32:40,460
He's hired

6138
07:32:40,940 --> 07:32:42,460
Micoleta

6139
07:32:42,460 --> 07:32:45,500
Nicholas cage. Yeah, uh, we're doing the Nicholas cage deal fee

6140
07:32:46,140 --> 07:32:49,900
As much as I've had to spend all the time in the world with you. I don't want you to be the cost of your health

6141
07:32:50,140 --> 07:32:53,740
I don't I'm not unhealthy when I suppose

6142
07:32:56,060 --> 07:32:58,060
Right what I want to do am I to follow?

6143
07:32:59,420 --> 07:33:01,420
Oh my god, I might need to fart on her on a clip

6144
07:33:01,980 --> 07:33:03,980
I

6145
07:33:04,540 --> 07:33:07,420
Let out the world's tiniest it wasn't even audible

6146
07:33:09,420 --> 07:33:12,460
I felt my my cheeks just part just a little

6147
07:33:16,540 --> 07:33:18,540
Foot prints sniff

6148
07:33:20,220 --> 07:33:22,700
Zero out of ten no, you know right in my tooth

6149
07:33:25,660 --> 07:33:27,660
You can rate the burps but not the toots

6150
07:33:28,460 --> 07:33:32,460
Part to burrs part to burrs. No brat burrs and shambles

6151
07:33:38,380 --> 07:33:40,380
Hold on a minute. Wait. Oh my god, what's going on?

6152
07:33:43,980 --> 07:33:47,500
Oh, they're like silent. I'm just gonna leave the mic on. Sorry. I'm

6153
07:33:48,140 --> 07:33:53,340
Sorry to be so gross and but like they're silent. You're not gonna hear them. I'll just leave the mic on

6154
07:33:54,620 --> 07:33:56,620
And you just have to guess

6155
07:33:58,620 --> 07:34:00,620
When I let one rip

6156
07:34:02,300 --> 07:34:09,260
Bit bruising shambles they are over me. She's not unhealthy. She's just seen junk food. She's just like us

6157
07:34:11,340 --> 07:34:15,580
Oh, there's another cross. Okay, let's carry out this

6158
07:34:19,980 --> 07:34:21,660
Uh, hello

6159
07:34:21,660 --> 07:34:23,660
Hello there together

6160
07:34:24,060 --> 07:34:28,860
We work together for michela the kind. Yes many things

6161
07:34:29,740 --> 07:34:31,740
We have found

6162
07:34:33,260 --> 07:34:37,580
What have you found dear traveler? Um

6163
07:34:38,380 --> 07:34:44,060
Pickled lever template grants boosts and stuff. Do you give me anything I should know about?

6164
07:34:46,780 --> 07:34:48,780
No

6165
07:34:49,180 --> 07:34:52,700
Well pickle turtle neck pamphlet grants a large boost of stamina

6166
07:34:53,900 --> 07:34:55,900
Everything that is

6167
07:34:59,820 --> 07:35:01,820
Touch the cross

6168
07:35:02,540 --> 07:35:07,500
And then speak to you. Where's your face? Are you this way? Oh, you're this way?

6169
07:35:09,180 --> 07:35:12,540
You must be the tarnished. Yes. I am ansma. Hello

6170
07:35:13,420 --> 07:35:19,820
Formerly in service to lord. I may or may not perish now like you another soul guided by kindly michela

6171
07:35:20,380 --> 07:35:22,620
I'm hardly the steady hand. I once was

6172
07:35:23,980 --> 07:35:25,980
My fighting days are far behind me

6173
07:35:26,700 --> 07:35:30,300
Which is why I have chosen to dedicate myself to investigation

6174
07:35:30,940 --> 07:35:33,580
To discern tender michela's ultimate purpose

6175
07:35:34,220 --> 07:35:39,580
I'd rather not volunteer service to a new master unless I know that I can be of use

6176
07:35:39,900 --> 07:35:41,900
Yeah

6177
07:35:42,940 --> 07:35:48,300
I created a new character this morning unaware of the power level my fellow reeflings to carry you

6178
07:35:48,300 --> 07:35:50,300
I've already caught up to my other

6179
07:35:50,780 --> 07:35:53,260
Characters and levels. So I'm gonna keep going. Yeah

6180
07:35:54,700 --> 07:35:58,300
Like I would it's quite possible. We'll go back to like lemgraves and stuff

6181
07:35:58,380 --> 07:36:04,140
I think I'm gonna hit a power wall where you guys it's like too impossible for you guys to carry me

6182
07:36:04,940 --> 07:36:06,940
quite possibly so

6183
07:36:07,900 --> 07:36:14,780
We may go back to like lemgraves and like do the actual stuff because like I do need weapon dream stuff, but

6184
07:36:15,740 --> 07:36:21,660
Yes, it is kind of like god. I'd be exhausted going up like forced it. So I'm like, okay. I think I'm done by now

6185
07:36:25,980 --> 07:36:30,140
As soon as more editors in cooperation release in her job, he's filled that no

6186
07:36:31,900 --> 07:36:33,900
That's so funny

6187
07:36:34,300 --> 07:36:38,700
Uh, I open manually this door is too big for me to be pushing again

6188
07:36:40,380 --> 07:36:42,380
Oh, no reeflings wait

6189
07:36:44,300 --> 07:36:47,980
Reeflings did we do something we weren't supposed to

6190
07:36:51,500 --> 07:36:52,620
Oh

6191
07:36:52,620 --> 07:36:59,740
You're retired. You're out of bounds of the playable area. I'm afraid refilling your service of guiding me ends here because we need to go and save

6192
07:37:01,100 --> 07:37:03,100
Thank you very much

6193
07:37:04,860 --> 07:37:07,260
Uh, I'm only at level

6194
07:37:08,540 --> 07:37:10,380
What level?

6195
07:37:10,380 --> 07:37:12,860
I mean, I spoofed my level 191

6196
07:37:14,140 --> 07:37:16,460
What are you making? What are you doing?

6197
07:37:17,500 --> 07:37:19,500
What was that?

6198
07:37:20,460 --> 07:37:23,100
Are you imagining yourself to pass away?

6199
07:37:27,100 --> 07:37:29,660
One more reefing and then I go through and then

6200
07:37:30,620 --> 07:37:34,140
We see what's on the other side. Thank you reeflings for understanding

6201
07:37:38,700 --> 07:37:40,700
How's that oh gimme on

6202
07:37:46,540 --> 07:37:52,620
Hold on I need to check on fucking gimme. You can't pause this game. Can you hold on? Sorry

6203
07:38:00,620 --> 07:38:02,620
It's cold

6204
07:38:03,660 --> 07:38:05,660
Why are you doing this to me?

6205
07:38:11,900 --> 07:38:13,900
Oh

6206
07:38:14,860 --> 07:38:19,100
She's so silly. She doesn't cry and it's basically a cat's cry

6207
07:38:19,740 --> 07:38:23,180
For I need help and it freaks me out of everything she does it

6208
07:38:24,460 --> 07:38:26,460
It's a high-pitched cry

6209
07:38:26,620 --> 07:38:29,340
Um, which is what they do to get their mom

6210
07:38:31,500 --> 07:38:33,500
If you want to be

6211
07:38:45,820 --> 07:38:47,820
She literally

6212
07:38:47,980 --> 07:38:53,500
And then as soon as she sees me she's like, oh, you're still alive and then walks away again go outside and play game

6213
07:38:53,820 --> 07:38:55,820
go outside

6214
07:38:56,060 --> 07:39:00,060
Literally, right. Did that scorpion thing leave me alone? I'm still alive. Sorry

6215
07:39:00,620 --> 07:39:07,660
It freaks me out when she does the creedisha. It's what kittens do to get their mom and I'm like, oh my god. What's wrong? What's wrong? Um

6216
07:39:08,620 --> 07:39:12,300
Nothing's wrong. Right. What the fuck is going on here. There's like a scorpion

6217
07:39:14,140 --> 07:39:16,140
How many just one

6218
07:39:16,620 --> 07:39:18,460
Am I good? Am I

6219
07:39:18,460 --> 07:39:20,460
Can I run

6220
07:39:21,100 --> 07:39:25,100
There's no way I have any power to do anything against that

6221
07:39:26,300 --> 07:39:28,300
Oh

6222
07:39:28,540 --> 07:39:30,540
Hey, at least you're not level 40 right now

6223
07:39:32,620 --> 07:39:34,620
That just go for it

6224
07:39:36,620 --> 07:39:39,740
Oh, just go for it. Just go for it. There'll be a save station

6225
07:39:41,900 --> 07:39:45,340
I'm safe the reeflings have me they just need to

6226
07:39:47,900 --> 07:39:51,900
I don't need that right now. I need the reeflings to be able to

6227
07:39:52,780 --> 07:39:53,900
I

6228
07:39:53,900 --> 07:39:55,900
There has to be a save station

6229
07:39:57,260 --> 07:39:59,260
I refuse to believe there's not

6230
07:40:01,740 --> 07:40:03,580
Oh, I'm

6231
07:40:03,580 --> 07:40:10,700
My heavy roll heavy roll heavy roll that reefling you're allowed to say you told me so you're so allowed to say you told me so right now

6232
07:40:11,260 --> 07:40:14,140
Oh my god, you're so allowed to say you told me so

6233
07:40:16,300 --> 07:40:18,860
You are allowed to say it until I perish

6234
07:40:19,660 --> 07:40:21,660
You are allowed to say I told you so

6235
07:40:25,820 --> 07:40:26,860
Okay

6236
07:40:26,860 --> 07:40:33,020
Betrayed by the armor upgrade getting this shite off me stripped me down. I'm no having it get that back on

6237
07:40:33,980 --> 07:40:35,260
get

6238
07:40:35,260 --> 07:40:41,260
These back on what are they weight is like nothing honestly. I'm now medium load so

6239
07:40:42,380 --> 07:40:45,500
Is my my roll could be faster if I'm not mistaken

6240
07:40:45,820 --> 07:40:49,580
Does this put me on late loads

6241
07:40:57,820 --> 07:40:59,820
Being very dumb

6242
07:41:00,300 --> 07:41:02,300
I don't know how this works

6243
07:41:02,380 --> 07:41:05,660
I assume that doesn't do anything. Oh that is actually fair

6244
07:41:07,660 --> 07:41:09,660
Okay, well I can do this now

6245
07:41:09,740 --> 07:41:16,460
Light load is 30 percent medium is what people typically have light is very hard to do without just straight up being

6246
07:41:18,300 --> 07:41:21,820
I have no idea what your name is but sure and you come

6247
07:41:23,580 --> 07:41:26,940
What on earth is your name to get it all censored?

6248
07:41:28,780 --> 07:41:30,780
What is your name?

6249
07:41:31,020 --> 07:41:33,020
You

6250
07:41:37,260 --> 07:41:39,260
Heard her strip down last

6251
07:41:39,500 --> 07:41:44,700
Literally, oh, I'm so sorry if I seem out of sorts. Give me doing that me. I'll freak me out

6252
07:41:45,180 --> 07:41:46,620
Fuck out

6253
07:41:46,620 --> 07:41:51,340
It literally is the cry of a kitten for its mom and I'm like what is wrong

6254
07:41:52,860 --> 07:41:57,580
Oh, can I be doing that to my hand? Oh, no. Is there no reefing here?

6255
07:41:57,740 --> 07:42:04,780
Is it just us I see some enemy for the same

6256
07:42:06,540 --> 07:42:08,540
Oh, are you tipping me?

6257
07:42:09,180 --> 07:42:14,300
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Right. We've got enemy and a friendly right do the friendly first and then do the enemy

6258
07:42:16,060 --> 07:42:18,060
Enemy enemy I got up an enemy

6259
07:42:19,500 --> 07:42:21,500
She and needy

6260
07:42:21,820 --> 07:42:23,020
a

6261
07:42:23,020 --> 07:42:24,700
unable to summon

6262
07:42:24,700 --> 07:42:26,700
adversary, huh

6263
07:42:26,940 --> 07:42:30,620
Are we being invaded? We've literally had like two seconds to freaking

6264
07:42:31,820 --> 07:42:35,580
Get in here. Are you tipping me glowstone for you?

6265
07:42:37,820 --> 07:42:42,780
Okay, why can I not have an adversary and he didn't have an adversary. Okay, and you come

6266
07:42:45,420 --> 07:42:47,420
He's healing me. Oh

6267
07:42:49,740 --> 07:42:51,740
Oh, it does

6268
07:42:52,300 --> 07:42:54,300
Oh

6269
07:42:55,900 --> 07:43:01,500
I didn't really heal. Oh, I'm pretty sure I have I'll have enough left. Thank you for your heel

6270
07:43:03,260 --> 07:43:05,260
The adversary making it in

6271
07:43:09,820 --> 07:43:13,820
Because you didn't say the grace look I was just so happy that I can get the reef on the back

6272
07:43:13,820 --> 07:43:19,980
Okay, that was scary. I missed something at the bottom of that statue. I don't know if I need to do that for the lore

6273
07:43:20,700 --> 07:43:27,260
There was a statue a walk past when all the wee baby scorpions came out. Oh, I've not blessed us. Okay. I need to bless our journey

6274
07:43:29,100 --> 07:43:32,300
If you would like to lie down and I will bless you all for this journey

6275
07:43:36,300 --> 07:43:39,500
No, you just want to lead the way you're like, you're like nah, come on

6276
07:43:40,940 --> 07:43:42,060
Oh

6277
07:43:42,060 --> 07:43:43,660
Okay

6278
07:43:43,660 --> 07:43:45,660
rival reefing and you just want to

6279
07:43:47,020 --> 07:43:49,020
Oh, you changed clore

6280
07:43:49,980 --> 07:43:51,980
Oh makes it you look friendly

6281
07:43:52,700 --> 07:43:56,540
You know the rules it doesn't it doesn't matter. There's enough holes for everyone

6282
07:43:59,660 --> 07:44:01,660
I'm sorry. I heard the rival

6283
07:44:04,540 --> 07:44:12,300
Okay, let's head off on our adventure. I am going to put my nightlight on that keeps me safe from the enemies

6284
07:44:12,460 --> 07:44:14,460
That's how it works clearly

6285
07:44:16,060 --> 07:44:19,260
Few enemies few enemies got a lot of enemies

6286
07:44:23,420 --> 07:44:25,420
Uh-huh, that was a bit silly

6287
07:44:29,100 --> 07:44:34,700
Oh wait, I need to hand it press y and rate bumper to two hands away. Yeah, I'm too smart. I remember

6288
07:44:35,820 --> 07:44:38,620
Wait, what was that? I saw that

6289
07:44:39,820 --> 07:44:41,500
I have more not

6290
07:44:41,500 --> 07:44:43,500
originally

6291
07:44:46,460 --> 07:44:50,700
The blazing is why I'm trying to speed through my levels right now. I mean

6292
07:44:51,660 --> 07:44:54,780
Oh wait, I was going to be like, oh you can catch up

6293
07:44:56,140 --> 07:44:58,940
I'm doing 12 hour endurance of those

6294
07:45:00,700 --> 07:45:02,700
Can you catch up?

6295
07:45:03,260 --> 07:45:08,300
I don't mean it as in a dower way, but I'm like you would have to like what is what is that?

6296
07:45:12,220 --> 07:45:14,220
Attacking

6297
07:45:14,620 --> 07:45:16,620
Silver horn tender

6298
07:45:20,060 --> 07:45:22,060
Hey

6299
07:45:26,460 --> 07:45:30,620
Oh, it's our pantry look we have sage hanging and we have the onion

6300
07:45:30,940 --> 07:45:33,420
If you didn't know this is actually how you saw onions

6301
07:45:33,420 --> 07:45:36,940
You need to dry them out before storage and then they can last the whole year

6302
07:45:37,500 --> 07:45:44,140
It's pretty cool, honestly to think that something so simple is removing the water like makes food last longer

6303
07:45:44,140 --> 07:45:47,740
But that's also what a dehydrator thingy my barber does

6304
07:45:48,700 --> 07:45:50,460
and

6305
07:45:50,460 --> 07:45:52,460
I will try my best to catch up

6306
07:45:58,140 --> 07:46:04,940
It is possible we might have to go back at some point. Um, not all the streams are gonna be

6307
07:46:07,900 --> 07:46:11,500
See even get I was gonna say does this guy even get staggered?

6308
07:46:12,140 --> 07:46:15,980
Um, it is possible some days. I might only have eight hours

6309
07:46:16,620 --> 07:46:17,660
um

6310
07:46:17,660 --> 07:46:24,300
But today and tomorrow is like a hundred percent twelve hours. Um, it's one of the give myself an animal

6311
07:46:26,860 --> 07:46:31,020
Um, then I am completely fine if

6312
07:46:31,740 --> 07:46:35,020
There's anything there that I don't want to activate that man. Um

6313
07:46:37,020 --> 07:46:41,500
The third day I might need a cheeky eight hours and to get

6314
07:46:42,940 --> 07:46:44,940
Oh, no

6315
07:46:50,940 --> 07:46:52,940
What are they

6316
07:46:53,820 --> 07:46:55,820
Like dragonfly

6317
07:46:57,900 --> 07:46:59,900
Or drop something

6318
07:46:59,900 --> 07:47:02,460
Oh silver horn tender. I guess those are what those are

6319
07:47:03,260 --> 07:47:07,740
I'm getting smithing stones everywhere. Is that is that river gonna blow me down?

6320
07:47:09,340 --> 07:47:12,140
I don't I'm I'm scared. Is that gonna push me down?

6321
07:47:13,100 --> 07:47:15,740
I was just on me there. Sorry. I wasn't paying attention

6322
07:47:18,780 --> 07:47:20,780
There's no waiting for strong anything

6323
07:47:21,820 --> 07:47:28,700
No, I don't give up. I'm gonna go back to limb graving like level up and do like the actual main quest and stuff

6324
07:47:32,860 --> 07:47:35,260
Good night we flings. Good night. Rest well

6325
07:47:38,380 --> 07:47:40,380
Store room key

6326
07:47:42,860 --> 07:47:44,860
Why yes the store room key

6327
07:47:47,980 --> 07:47:52,700
Okay, now that way we're jumping over here. Oh, there's a weak thing here. Hold on

6328
07:47:54,620 --> 07:47:57,820
Throwing dagger tangles free

6329
07:47:58,540 --> 07:48:00,540
I

6330
07:48:02,140 --> 07:48:03,980
That new armor that is only like old

6331
07:48:05,820 --> 07:48:07,820
Who or what oh a bird

6332
07:48:09,980 --> 07:48:12,700
Beat that bird up show nature what we think about it

6333
07:48:13,820 --> 07:48:15,580
those

6334
07:48:15,580 --> 07:48:17,580
Huh

6335
07:48:19,580 --> 07:48:22,940
Is that a wee bit buggy just a wee bit buggy

6336
07:48:23,660 --> 07:48:29,260
Okay, I think that was just like a wee bug. Bird stuck. Bird stuck

6337
07:48:35,500 --> 07:48:41,020
We're just beating up everything in our path. I thought rival reef and right right ball replaying

6338
07:48:41,820 --> 07:48:44,700
Say rival refling 10 times fast

6339
07:48:45,820 --> 07:48:50,060
rival reefing rival reef. Oh, are you gonna stop on the first one rival replaying?

6340
07:48:53,740 --> 07:48:55,740
Yeah

6341
07:48:55,980 --> 07:49:00,460
I'm healing by the fire and I'm healing by the fire

6342
07:49:00,860 --> 07:49:05,580
And the fire is healing me and it makes sure I have lots of flasks

6343
07:49:06,220 --> 07:49:13,100
Because I'm so under level over level, but I don't have the upgrade. Wait, don't do that

6344
07:49:14,540 --> 07:49:16,540
It says he goes it says go forth

6345
07:49:17,100 --> 07:49:18,700
Oh

6346
07:49:18,700 --> 07:49:22,700
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Hold on. What do you do? What do you do big slam big slam?

6347
07:49:23,020 --> 07:49:25,020
No, I'm here

6348
07:49:25,180 --> 07:49:29,180
Now you will handle my club. Oh, how did I dodge? I don't even know

6349
07:49:32,620 --> 07:49:37,820
Fifty five damage while everyone literally came in close. Oh, I'm out of stamina

6350
07:49:38,780 --> 07:49:40,780
Summon stamina. I'm out of stamina

6351
07:49:48,940 --> 07:49:50,940
No, the reefing didn't fail

6352
07:49:53,740 --> 07:49:55,740
I

6353
07:49:59,980 --> 07:50:01,980
No, I'm so weak

6354
07:50:06,620 --> 07:50:12,300
Wait, he wasn't was he even that bad? Okay, this is why I think we're going back to limb grave

6355
07:50:16,460 --> 07:50:20,140
This is why I think we might be slightly going back to limb grave

6356
07:50:23,740 --> 07:50:25,740
Just the wee bit

6357
07:50:26,060 --> 07:50:30,860
Just the wee bit back to limb grave a new map has been found. Wow

6358
07:50:32,860 --> 07:50:34,860
Wow

6359
07:50:37,900 --> 07:50:39,900
In the realm of shadow

6360
07:50:42,460 --> 07:50:45,100
Okay, we are in small private altar

6361
07:50:46,860 --> 07:50:48,860
Gee

6362
07:50:49,100 --> 07:50:53,340
Look at that it's all being decimated at the back of the cast all those seems like a green area

6363
07:50:53,340 --> 07:50:58,060
Oh my god, are we actually going to have a nature area that doesn't look like completely decimated?

6364
07:50:59,740 --> 07:51:01,740
This is where all the people the month

6365
07:51:03,740 --> 07:51:05,740
In the shadow realm

6366
07:51:06,060 --> 07:51:10,300
Have we got all the wrong that was absolutely not your name by the way

6367
07:51:12,860 --> 07:51:14,860
Um

6368
07:51:15,100 --> 07:51:17,100
All right

6369
07:51:21,820 --> 07:51:23,820
An area that doesn't look this

6370
07:51:24,300 --> 07:51:27,420
Decimated in Elden ring for a chance

6371
07:51:27,580 --> 07:51:32,700
I mean, it would be nice to see like the game dev team have a nice non broken area

6372
07:51:32,700 --> 07:51:35,660
Like the closest you get is what the roundhouse table

6373
07:51:37,660 --> 07:51:40,780
Um, um wait because it's such a new rule

6374
07:51:42,700 --> 07:51:44,700
And then a rival

6375
07:51:45,340 --> 07:51:47,340
What is your name that's gonna bother you

6376
07:51:51,020 --> 07:51:53,020
Real one of souls that everything has to stop

6377
07:51:54,140 --> 07:51:56,940
Oh, we need to do the blessings so we don't get ruled again

6378
07:51:58,700 --> 07:52:01,340
If everyone wants to lie down next to each other one friend

6379
07:52:03,020 --> 07:52:05,500
If you have the lie down one, I don't even think I'll have

6380
07:52:06,380 --> 07:52:08,380
Confirm remove switch

6381
07:52:09,660 --> 07:52:13,180
Oh lie down isn't a default. I wonder where you get lie down

6382
07:52:14,060 --> 07:52:17,580
Oh, you guys all seem to have it. So you must be playing the game. Well

6383
07:52:22,460 --> 07:52:24,620
Only one of you will take HP that one

6384
07:52:26,380 --> 07:52:28,380
But it is a sacrifice

6385
07:52:32,380 --> 07:52:34,380
Just don't pronounce the H

6386
07:52:36,940 --> 07:52:39,660
Ah learning never

6387
07:52:39,820 --> 07:52:41,820
We're

6388
07:52:42,140 --> 07:52:44,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

6389
07:52:45,420 --> 07:52:47,420
Name wonder he's wiping his way

6390
07:52:47,740 --> 07:52:50,140
Why did I start leaving a message there?

6391
07:52:52,060 --> 07:52:54,060
Oh my god

6392
07:52:54,140 --> 07:52:56,140
Okay, now we're getting back

6393
07:52:56,540 --> 07:52:58,540
absolute

6394
07:52:58,540 --> 07:53:00,540
absolutely

6395
07:53:02,700 --> 07:53:04,700
I don't know where my souls are

6396
07:53:04,700 --> 07:53:06,700
Oh

6397
07:53:08,620 --> 07:53:10,620
Are we are we crowded around the healing stone?

6398
07:53:12,300 --> 07:53:14,300
Thank you for the healing stone

6399
07:53:14,700 --> 07:53:19,020
My full health. I'm full health. I don't know where I've lost my souls, but it's fine

6400
07:53:19,660 --> 07:53:22,220
I'm sure someone will kindly drop me

6401
07:53:25,340 --> 07:53:26,540
Um

6402
07:53:26,540 --> 07:53:31,660
Like a billion dragon souls again, and then I just although I've levelled up

6403
07:53:31,740 --> 07:53:35,820
I just need decent armor and stuff and not to be bad at the game really

6404
07:53:36,700 --> 07:53:42,060
Really, it's kind of the classic case of don't be bad. I hate to admit it, but

6405
07:53:42,860 --> 07:53:45,260
As soon as I get decent weapon

6406
07:53:46,300 --> 07:53:48,300
I'm literally getting rolled by

6407
07:53:48,460 --> 07:53:50,460
No

6408
07:54:05,660 --> 07:54:07,900
We're fine. I'm out of stamina, but we're fine

6409
07:54:10,620 --> 07:54:17,340
Unlocking your flask upgrade would probably be most important right now drop 99 armor refling can't do that

6410
07:54:18,380 --> 07:54:25,420
It's a shame, but we can't do it. I was saying that you guys like dropped me so many weapons and armor like I don't even question. I'm just like, oh

6411
07:54:26,620 --> 07:54:28,380
Refling first

6412
07:54:28,380 --> 07:54:30,380
What does that mean?

6413
07:54:31,100 --> 07:54:34,300
Is that unfriendly? I have a feeling that might have been unfriendly

6414
07:54:35,580 --> 07:54:42,060
Uh, something's attacking me. I don't know what but uh, we'll just keep going forward. That's the main thing

6415
07:54:43,820 --> 07:54:45,820
Wasn't the bird was it?

6416
07:54:46,780 --> 07:54:48,780
What did you admire this man?

6417
07:54:49,980 --> 07:54:57,180
Okay. Oh, okay. You were literally turned into kfc chicken wings within what two seconds. Yeah

6418
07:54:58,460 --> 07:55:00,460
Don't mess with me or the beefling

6419
07:55:06,540 --> 07:55:08,540
Are you sat down there

6420
07:55:09,740 --> 07:55:11,420
A bit of working out

6421
07:55:11,420 --> 07:55:12,940
Oh

6422
07:55:12,940 --> 07:55:16,220
I just smashed a pole on his head pita will be in contact

6423
07:55:20,460 --> 07:55:22,460
Oh, did we I am here

6424
07:55:24,220 --> 07:55:28,380
Uh, oh, this is where my souls are I found them

6425
07:55:33,180 --> 07:55:37,740
Wow if you can okay now take the aggro off of them

6426
07:55:37,740 --> 07:55:39,740
Oh

6427
07:55:41,260 --> 07:55:43,260
Okay, yeah

6428
07:55:43,900 --> 07:55:46,780
Okay, if we like switch the aggro we're fine

6429
07:55:47,740 --> 07:55:52,380
Yeah, genuinely absolutely fine if we uh five head up. Is that my healing stone?

6430
07:55:52,620 --> 07:55:55,340
Is that my healing stone here if you don't want to use the flag?

6431
07:55:59,660 --> 07:56:01,660
I only did it a little bit but that's

6432
07:56:03,180 --> 07:56:05,180
Uh

6433
07:56:05,820 --> 07:56:07,820
This way

6434
07:56:13,900 --> 07:56:15,900
Whoa

6435
07:56:18,540 --> 07:56:20,540
I have like a billion eggs, hey

6436
07:56:24,460 --> 07:56:26,460
More of those ingredients

6437
07:56:30,780 --> 07:56:32,780
Oh

6438
07:56:33,420 --> 07:56:39,420
Yeah, see I missed one of these back there. So whatever this is, I hope it's not too important

6439
07:56:40,860 --> 07:56:48,060
Oh, I was a reverent spirit ash. I might might need to go back for that. It seems rather important. I don't want to

6440
07:56:49,980 --> 07:56:52,540
I don't want to tell you on how it should be, but he's rather

6441
07:56:52,940 --> 07:56:54,940
I

6442
07:56:59,340 --> 07:57:01,340
Love

6443
07:57:06,300 --> 07:57:08,300
Sorry the heat

6444
07:57:22,940 --> 07:57:24,940
Oh

6445
07:57:37,100 --> 07:57:40,140
What's happening why is one of my rooflings down? Where did you go?

6446
07:57:42,860 --> 07:57:44,860
What the heck is this?

6447
07:57:45,820 --> 07:57:50,940
Oh my god, oh, no, that's a freaking refland. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm so

6448
07:57:54,860 --> 07:57:58,700
Doing a bit of acrobatics. Yeah, acrobatics, mate

6449
07:57:59,980 --> 07:58:02,780
Oh, I meant I just hit the wall. I'm punishing the wall

6450
07:58:05,340 --> 07:58:07,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay

6451
07:58:07,740 --> 07:58:09,740
Okay

6452
07:58:11,260 --> 07:58:13,260
Oh

6453
07:58:13,340 --> 07:58:16,380
What's her refland one didn't make it

6454
07:58:18,780 --> 07:58:21,980
I'm trying to find out my room for being too hot and this is what happens

6455
07:58:24,620 --> 07:58:26,380
Okay

6456
07:58:26,380 --> 07:58:28,380
Oh, we've failed him

6457
07:58:28,860 --> 07:58:30,860
We may he rip in this

6458
07:58:31,580 --> 07:58:33,580
He did what you could where you could

6459
07:58:34,540 --> 07:58:36,540
No, we can't win them all we can't win

6460
07:58:37,100 --> 07:58:39,100
It is not possible

6461
07:58:39,820 --> 07:58:41,820
I

6462
07:58:42,380 --> 07:58:47,820
Should someone say my message they're like I fall asleep to your streams more than your ASMR streams and I'm like how

6463
07:58:48,860 --> 07:58:51,500
How do you not completely perish?

6464
07:58:52,380 --> 07:58:54,380
Did I have you?

6465
07:58:55,260 --> 07:58:57,740
Is there any other reflings here? Um

6466
07:58:58,540 --> 07:59:00,540
Wait, this isn't a grave site. I've

6467
07:59:00,700 --> 07:59:02,700
No, it is a grave site

6468
07:59:03,260 --> 07:59:05,580
I think I had you in recently did I not

6469
07:59:06,540 --> 07:59:11,180
Is who are you red mean for you sure

6470
07:59:14,380 --> 07:59:16,380
Uh

6471
07:59:17,020 --> 07:59:20,780
There is as I said, there is probably a possibility we're going back boss time

6472
07:59:22,060 --> 07:59:26,300
Have you already as there are reflings who've already finished all of the deal? I almost dropped off

6473
07:59:27,580 --> 07:59:29,900
Um, have you guys already finished like the DLC?

6474
07:59:30,060 --> 07:59:35,340
Is that no friend that's friendly

6475
07:59:37,180 --> 07:59:39,580
Reflink refling that's another replay

6476
07:59:40,300 --> 07:59:42,300
Reflink that's another replay

6477
07:59:43,180 --> 07:59:46,620
Stop it. That's another replay. Are you not a refling?

6478
07:59:50,620 --> 07:59:57,660
Am I missing something or did I just fall in from that's not a refling? It's an NPC who?

6479
08:00:00,620 --> 08:00:07,660
Oh, no, I wondered why your name was so funny. I was like that's such a specific name refling

6480
08:00:07,740 --> 08:00:12,460
Why you wrote I'm so sorry refling wait. So how did I get rid of her?

6481
08:00:13,660 --> 08:00:14,940
I don't

6482
08:00:14,940 --> 08:00:18,700
Oh my god. Sorry. I'm going to go ahead so you despawn refling. I'm so sorry

6483
08:00:20,540 --> 08:00:24,060
I was so freaking confused at the name. I was like that's such a specific name

6484
08:00:24,140 --> 08:00:26,620
All right. I shouldn't do a cutscene so you don't get pummeled

6485
08:00:27,340 --> 08:00:34,140
Freya hates refling. Oh my god. This bosses effect can well destroy you

6486
08:00:35,740 --> 08:00:39,820
Oh horned beast from higher sphere delivered

6487
08:00:41,340 --> 08:00:45,420
Take root inside the tower sculptor keepers

6488
08:00:46,700 --> 08:00:51,820
And perched within we beg of thee rise

6489
08:00:56,620 --> 08:00:58,620
Oh

6490
08:01:15,020 --> 08:01:17,020
And those who plague the tower

6491
08:01:19,260 --> 08:01:21,740
Lends away the trumpets

6492
08:01:26,620 --> 08:01:28,620
Oh

6493
08:01:40,060 --> 08:01:42,060
Uh

6494
08:01:43,740 --> 08:01:45,740
Where's the first

6495
08:01:48,940 --> 08:01:50,940
Eh

6496
08:01:52,540 --> 08:01:54,540
He has this

6497
08:01:55,500 --> 08:01:57,500
Oh my god

6498
08:02:06,380 --> 08:02:10,620
I have no flash I'm absolutely no help right now

6499
08:02:12,780 --> 08:02:18,060
Uh, you're on your own holy moley

6500
08:02:20,700 --> 08:02:22,700
Uh

6501
08:02:23,660 --> 08:02:25,660
Yeah, um

6502
08:02:28,300 --> 08:02:33,660
I think we need to go back to limb grave. I said it. I don't I don't know what I'm supposed to do

6503
08:02:37,100 --> 08:02:40,540
Isn't there that death plumage thing going on?

6504
08:02:44,460 --> 08:02:48,700
I'm probably gonna perish like in there because of an accident

6505
08:02:53,100 --> 08:02:55,100
Oh

6506
08:02:56,940 --> 08:03:00,860
Wait, why are you locking on to me? I haven't done any damage to you

6507
08:03:03,500 --> 08:03:05,980
I'm trying to look at his attack patterns, but

6508
08:03:07,980 --> 08:03:09,980
Wow

6509
08:03:18,540 --> 08:03:20,540
Oh my god, sorry

6510
08:03:23,100 --> 08:03:25,100
No, there's no way holy

6511
08:03:26,780 --> 08:03:28,780
Holy moley

6512
08:03:29,500 --> 08:03:31,500
Just wait as in

6513
08:03:32,700 --> 08:03:34,700
Implication of

6514
08:03:34,700 --> 08:03:39,020
He filtered so many people. I would not be surprised

6515
08:03:40,140 --> 08:03:43,980
And ignoring the impending doom that's actually pretty decent. He gets harder

6516
08:03:47,260 --> 08:03:49,260
Oh my god

6517
08:03:50,220 --> 08:03:53,500
Okay, we have a real situation on our hands

6518
08:03:54,300 --> 08:03:57,820
I'm too weak to do anything because of my weapon drain stuff

6519
08:03:59,020 --> 08:04:01,020
Do you want

6520
08:04:01,820 --> 08:04:04,620
Reflings do you want to have a whack at it?

6521
08:04:05,420 --> 08:04:09,900
I don't mind you guys have it if you want a whack at it. I do not mind at all

6522
08:04:11,900 --> 08:04:13,900
Or we can go back

6523
08:04:13,980 --> 08:04:21,020
Go get some flasks. Okay, we're going to go back to limb grave and just chill out for a little bit

6524
08:04:21,340 --> 08:04:25,580
Because like this area is definitely getting a bit too much for me

6525
08:04:27,340 --> 08:04:31,180
As for seats and stuff

6526
08:04:32,140 --> 08:04:36,220
Unfortunately, my memory failed me of what ones I've gotten

6527
08:04:37,420 --> 08:04:39,420
For the sake of

6528
08:04:39,500 --> 08:04:41,500
Oh

6529
08:04:45,660 --> 08:04:47,900
Okay, we're just going to take a little chill pill

6530
08:04:48,460 --> 08:04:53,260
We're just going to uh, I want to explore and get like all the maps and stuff if that's okay

6531
08:04:54,060 --> 08:04:56,060
We'll just take it nice and easy

6532
08:04:56,620 --> 08:04:59,100
Nice and easy. Okay. Nice and easy

6533
08:04:59,820 --> 08:05:04,460
Uh, we'll go unlock the map. Um, if you want to come with me, I'm in

6534
08:05:05,180 --> 08:05:10,620
K-Lum ruins and north of K-Lid. Yeah

6535
08:05:15,020 --> 08:05:20,300
Uh, and then I get my little reasons in and we'll just do some explore and get a few flasks and seeds

6536
08:05:21,260 --> 08:05:24,620
Um, not really sure what else to do

6537
08:05:25,980 --> 08:05:27,980
Can't do that from here

6538
08:05:28,940 --> 08:05:30,940
From this one freaking marker

6539
08:05:31,900 --> 08:05:38,940
I've got the game actually going to make me go travel on my own. Does it not know that I'm a streamer princess?

6540
08:05:44,220 --> 08:05:47,820
That map is a separate map. Well, I'm going to go discover the map of this

6541
08:05:50,140 --> 08:05:53,420
Go to summon water village outskirts. I will go there

6542
08:05:54,940 --> 08:05:56,940
Please do not attack

6543
08:05:57,500 --> 08:05:59,500
I do

6544
08:05:59,980 --> 08:06:02,480
Good luck attacking me. No, I'm on the other side of the lake

6545
08:06:04,140 --> 08:06:08,140
Why does it say dragon spiral? I'm gonna get jumped by a dragon

6546
08:06:09,980 --> 08:06:12,700
Please I just want the map of the area. That's all I have

6547
08:06:13,900 --> 08:06:16,780
I'm a simple streamer. There's not much more to it

6548
08:06:18,140 --> 08:06:21,740
Just want the map of the area. I wasn't too far off it

6549
08:06:23,100 --> 08:06:25,820
Nice to be at pin the oh, I found the dragon

6550
08:06:26,540 --> 08:06:28,540
I'll never guess where the dragon is

6551
08:06:30,460 --> 08:06:34,940
Uh, right, okay, we'll discover this map. I actually don't see the map on the close here here

6552
08:06:35,580 --> 08:06:40,540
Okay, um, I am too cool to summon water village, which I

6553
08:06:47,820 --> 08:06:49,820
And the other map

6554
08:06:49,820 --> 08:06:51,820
So

6555
08:06:53,820 --> 08:06:55,820
It's on the other map

6556
08:07:11,020 --> 08:07:13,020
It's in the middle of Lynn grief

6557
08:07:13,820 --> 08:07:15,820
I

6558
08:07:20,380 --> 08:07:22,940
Didn't that took me a whole second. Sorry

6559
08:07:23,660 --> 08:07:29,660
We are going such a girl boss girl princess streamer and she's the basically girl. Oh god

08:07:38,460 --> 08:07:40,460

6563
08:07:52,620 --> 08:07:59,020
Oh, I keep doing that. I'm not to bring in the adversary first. Ah, we'll show you. We'll show you. Okay

6564
08:07:59,020 --> 08:08:01,020
Oh

6565
08:08:22,700 --> 08:08:25,420
That's what you're wearing that boss's face

6566
08:08:26,620 --> 08:08:28,620
You're wearing that boss's face

6567
08:08:29,020 --> 08:08:31,740
That we just got absolutely kablamo'd by

6568
08:08:32,700 --> 08:08:37,180
There's a church and a grave and a sacred tear just south-east of here. Okay

6569
08:08:38,540 --> 08:08:41,180
Oh, no, what's wrong little refund. Do you need a nap?

6570
08:08:42,220 --> 08:08:44,220
Are you scared of the enemy?

6571
08:08:44,940 --> 08:08:47,900
What's wrong? Are you caring for a blessing me?

6572
08:08:49,900 --> 08:08:58,140
Uh, is there any other refling and the summon water village outskirts at the north west of kaolin or limb grief?

6573
08:08:59,100 --> 08:09:01,100
What are you holding?

6574
08:09:12,300 --> 08:09:14,300
No, not that one this one

6575
08:09:14,620 --> 08:09:19,900
For some reason there's no other symbol showing up. So there's only one logical thing to do one slam

6576
08:09:20,060 --> 08:09:22,060
Um

6577
08:09:23,580 --> 08:09:24,620
Okay

6578
08:09:24,620 --> 08:09:31,180
Ray let's get into it. I don't know why there's not any more symbols showing up the game's a bit finicky

6579
08:09:31,340 --> 08:09:36,060
But let's see if we can hold our own and limb grave flash kaolin

6580
08:09:50,300 --> 08:09:52,300
Calling the reef

6581
08:09:59,820 --> 08:10:03,820

We did it a jelly. Did you make it? Yeah, see look who's really MLG pro out here

6585
08:10:22,460 --> 08:10:24,940
Can you watch over a certain goddess if she's demon?

08:10:48,300 --> 08:10:50,540
Okay, I can't reach that. I'm too small. That's okay

6590
08:10:51,980 --> 08:10:53,980
I'm used to being small so

6591
08:10:55,180 --> 08:10:57,180
Take it where you're hidden

6592
08:10:57,740 --> 08:11:03,260
Oh, I have to get those flakes and on you. How do you do that?

6593
08:11:12,540 --> 08:11:15,500
My tummy's no digesting the noises are

6594
08:11:18,940 --> 08:11:23,660
Weaver someone who might be interested in rescuing the great kenneth height

6595
08:11:24,540 --> 08:11:28,780
Servant to the to order he gives me a thing or no, the false

08:11:52,860 --> 08:11:54,860
I almost feel sorry

6601
08:11:55,580 --> 08:12:00,940
What are you waiting my fort lies to the south beyond the south beyond mist would take it back

6602

08:12:05,020 --> 08:12:08,860
A shot for every failure. She's fine. Just a bit plush. Okay as long as she's fine

6604
08:12:08,860 --> 08:12:11,260
But you'll you'll tell me if I need a message or and be like

6605
08:12:12,140 --> 08:12:14,140
Temp you to tuck yourself into bed

Okay, I trust you guys and your judgment. I don't know ha ha funny streamer. It was but health first

08:12:33,340 --> 08:12:35,340
Oh that boar's charging you

6608
08:12:37,100 --> 08:12:39,100
Me and the boar are charging me

6609
08:12:39,660 --> 08:12:46,220
I have funny streamer. That's basically the only way I can do it is like so, you know, it's like a streamer does a drunk stream

6610
08:12:47,340 --> 08:12:50,140
And it's like the cute drunk and like oh, they're having a good time

6611
08:12:50,140 --> 08:12:56,460
They're giggling they're laughing they're singing or whatever and then there's like the other drunk time when you're like, oh my god

6612
08:12:57,500 --> 08:13:01,740
I this doesn't feel good like watching this I feel nervous, you know

6613
08:13:02,700 --> 08:13:04,700
I

6614
08:13:06,460 --> 08:13:17,180
Crystal tear and a wondrous physics. Oh, I never even had that on mall. I understand now why I was getting asked about the physics

6615
08:13:19,340 --> 08:13:26,300
Okay, is it like a sad drunk streamer like yeah, I only got two beers and about eight ounces the camera has it done

6616
08:13:27,580 --> 08:13:29,580
Don't overdo it

6617
08:13:29,660 --> 08:13:32,380
Oh, wow and a sacred tear

6618
08:13:35,340 --> 08:13:37,340
Oh wait, but here's a leafling here

6619
08:13:38,460 --> 08:13:40,460
The perfume alone

6620
08:13:42,620 --> 08:13:44,620
I swear if I just brought in

6621
08:13:45,180 --> 08:13:47,980
An mpc again because I'm so dumb and I can't tell the difference

6622
08:13:49,980 --> 08:13:54,860
If you kill Kenneth, he gives a golden key. Do I want to kill whoever this Kenneth is?

6623
08:13:54,860 --> 08:14:04,220
Or should I be worried did I just call in an mpc again? I was gonna say the name looks so formal and specific

6624
08:14:04,780 --> 08:14:06,780
uh

6625
08:14:07,420 --> 08:14:09,420
Oh, no

6626
08:14:09,500 --> 08:14:15,980
You're not an mpc at all. No, definitely not an mpc with this uh with this arrangement

6627
08:14:17,340 --> 08:14:19,900
Oh, do you want do you want it to rival leaflin?

6628
08:14:20,540 --> 08:14:22,540
You want to join in

6629
08:14:22,540 --> 08:14:24,540
Are you good nah you joining

6630
08:14:25,100 --> 08:14:27,100
No, that's definitely blue. Yeah

6631
08:14:28,060 --> 08:14:30,060
You're cowering

6632
08:14:31,180 --> 08:14:35,260
Oh, why did that all walk on you that actually like went for you

6633
08:14:37,660 --> 08:14:39,660
Okay, let's go again

6634
08:14:42,220 --> 08:14:44,220
He's just good at blending in true

6635
08:14:48,460 --> 08:14:54,220
Wow, I'm using up a stamina bar because the game thinks I'm fighting you the invader

6636
08:14:55,580 --> 08:14:57,580
She's shocking behavior

6637
08:15:08,140 --> 08:15:15,660
Forget Lumbridge we adventuring through a limb break. Okay, that did not work at all. I thought that rhymed a bit better in my head

6638
08:15:15,660 --> 08:15:17,660
I

6639
08:15:23,580 --> 08:15:26,380
May have to make a cup of tea for my wee voice shortly

6640
08:15:28,460 --> 08:15:30,460
Even though I just ate

6641
08:15:31,180 --> 08:15:35,260
My voice is starting to feel it. Okay. I've been rambling your ears off for how long

6642
08:15:36,140 --> 08:15:38,140
Eight hours already. Wow

6643
08:15:39,580 --> 08:15:41,900
I'm sorry, but you guys make the same part with one

6644
08:15:42,700 --> 08:15:44,700
I say, oh, what do you think of elder drink?

6645
08:15:46,220 --> 08:15:50,460
Oh, it's really good if you play it with friends and play with friends. What do you mean?

6646
08:15:51,580 --> 08:15:58,700
I'm like, oh, I got carried through the entire game carry. What do you what do you mean characters intact? Oh, um

6647
08:16:00,060 --> 08:16:02,060
Yeah, I kind of just

6648
08:16:03,420 --> 08:16:04,380
Yeah

6649
08:16:04,380 --> 08:16:06,060
10 out of 10 game wait

6650
08:16:06,060 --> 08:16:10,380
So if you played it solo, what's your rate and oh I can still appreciate the game and all that

6651
08:16:10,540 --> 08:16:12,540
But I'm too scared as a player

6652
08:16:12,780 --> 08:16:18,940
But the actual game itself is still 10 out of 10. There's fantastic art and direction and narrative and everything

6653
08:16:20,300 --> 08:16:24,780
Just found my xp form spot need to take a detail my weapon is not strong enough

6654
08:16:25,340 --> 08:16:32,460
I can relate to that my weapon is although it's a dlc weapon. So maybe I'm like overpowered for limb grave now

6655
08:16:35,340 --> 08:16:37,340
Caleb and all that

6656
08:16:38,220 --> 08:16:43,260
The fact you guys can remember where like these sacred flasks and tears are

6657
08:16:45,100 --> 08:16:47,900
Look at fast from running. I like speedy gonzales

6658
08:16:52,780 --> 08:16:58,140
I never played it you've never played it before wait, why are you tolerating me playing at this?

6659
08:17:00,380 --> 08:17:04,860
I guess soul's game doesn't for everyone like I have to be honest. I've never played any other soul's game

6660
08:17:05,740 --> 08:17:07,260
um

6661
08:17:07,900 --> 08:17:13,660
And I actually don't think I could even play this game on stream if it wasn't for the fact that you guys can come help me

6662
08:17:14,300 --> 08:17:19,500
Like it is not possible. It's not possible. I cannot do this on my own and get too scared

6663
08:17:20,140 --> 08:17:24,460
Too scared. I want I want uh friendly. I want help. I want everything

6664
08:17:26,460 --> 08:17:28,460
Because I like you

6665
08:17:28,700 --> 08:17:32,060
But like to tolerate like such an endurance stream of a game

6666
08:17:32,620 --> 08:17:34,620
I feel like

6667
08:17:34,780 --> 08:17:37,740
Right there one dead here. Wow

6668
08:17:39,260 --> 08:17:45,660
Oh, I remember what we're doing. There's a piece of a half up here. Are we going inside the castello?

6669
08:17:47,420 --> 08:17:49,420
Sorry, mate. I won this time

6670
08:17:51,100 --> 08:17:55,100
Elden ring is just the backdrop for the yap stream

6671
08:17:57,100 --> 08:17:59,100
How does she do it leaving jump?

6672
08:18:00,060 --> 08:18:06,780
Oh, I'm getting sleepy because I've eaten. I'm not sorry. I'm doing an endurance stream

6673
08:18:08,220 --> 08:18:10,220
I'm not gonna bed

6674
08:18:10,860 --> 08:18:12,860
I need to get endurance

6675
08:18:12,860 --> 08:18:14,860
because

6676
08:18:15,420 --> 08:18:18,940
If I don't then I'm in big trouble big trouble

6677
08:18:21,260 --> 08:18:23,260
What's going on in here?

6678
08:18:24,140 --> 08:18:32,460
We things together strong. It's not normal to watch someone when you play the game

6679
08:18:33,660 --> 08:18:37,180
You love play a game you don't like. I don't know. I just feel like

6680
08:18:38,060 --> 08:18:41,420
Oh, that game doesn't interest me. I won't watch it type thing

6681
08:18:42,300 --> 08:18:47,020
I'm like, I'm not that entertaining. Oh my god. You just did that for me. Thank you

6682
08:18:47,100 --> 08:18:51,820
I just got that ash reward even though I didn't do anything so

6683
08:18:53,260 --> 08:18:55,260
I'm getting a lot of blood roses around here

6684
08:18:56,060 --> 08:18:58,940
But we watch for you know, you're gonna stop. Oh my god

6685
08:19:00,620 --> 08:19:02,620
Can't say such things to me

6686
08:19:03,260 --> 08:19:06,380
You can't be so nice to me. You'll make me too happy

6687
08:19:07,260 --> 08:19:11,420
What happens if I get an ego because of how um kind you guys are?

6688
08:19:13,660 --> 08:19:16,940
Okay, I'm picking up this half is this for the all

6689
08:19:19,340 --> 08:19:22,620
That I've already gone fast the elevator it is

6690
08:19:23,820 --> 08:19:25,420
Oops

6691
08:19:25,420 --> 08:19:27,420
Hello

6692
08:19:28,620 --> 08:19:34,140
Okay, that was lucky. I don't I thought that was a lot closer than it was

6693
08:19:42,060 --> 08:19:44,460
Sorry, I was doing where are we going?

6694
08:19:44,460 --> 08:19:46,460
I

6695
08:19:47,660 --> 08:19:51,420
When you're eager to be so flustered get an ego use it to crush ours

6696
08:19:51,900 --> 08:19:55,180
I don't want to crush your ego. I want to crush your pelvis. Yeah

6697
08:19:55,660 --> 08:19:57,820
I don't want to crush your ego though

6698
08:19:57,820 --> 08:20:02,460
Like sometimes it's good to be selfish and like confident and all that is um

6699
08:20:03,580 --> 08:20:05,580
Isn't it so bad to be confident in yourself?

6700
08:20:09,500 --> 08:20:12,780
My lord talk about in dream stream after I went to work and came back and you're still here

6701
08:20:13,180 --> 08:20:15,180
Did you have a good day at work?

6702
08:20:16,220 --> 08:20:19,900
Did you remember to hydrate did you remember to do your

6703
08:20:20,460 --> 08:20:21,820
After work

6704
08:20:21,820 --> 08:20:26,860
Jobby for 45 minutes in the toilet like that's all I see about on tiktok

6705
08:20:27,900 --> 08:20:29,900
Is all these chicks are like

6706
08:20:30,060 --> 08:20:34,940
Oh my man comes back to work and he takes a 45 minute in the toilet

6707
08:20:35,660 --> 08:20:37,660
and everyone's like

6708
08:20:38,540 --> 08:20:41,900
I don't know if you've ever been on the the female side of tiktok

6709
08:20:42,060 --> 08:20:48,620
It is the most bizarre experience of your life because without fail the comments are leave him

6710
08:20:50,140 --> 08:20:54,380
It's bizarre. It doesn't matter what the context of the video might be

6711
08:20:54,700 --> 08:20:58,220
There's always one chick in the comments that goes leave them

6712
08:20:59,740 --> 08:21:02,700
And it was like what where did they even come from?

6713
08:21:03,180 --> 08:21:09,020
So, yeah, stay if you if your brain was on tiktok the chick side of it is bizarre. I'm sorry

6714
08:21:10,380 --> 08:21:17,100
You've never thought I you I used entirely the wrong phrase. I meant get an eagle use it to crush our minds bad typing

6715
08:21:17,340 --> 08:21:19,340
I mean either way we got something's getting crushed

6716
08:21:22,220 --> 08:21:26,060
And it's not the can the central bank of

6717
08:21:27,580 --> 08:21:29,580
Texas

6718
08:21:33,420 --> 08:21:34,940
Oh

6719
08:21:34,940 --> 08:21:40,300
Did you guys forget the joke already someone said central bank of texas and

6720
08:21:40,940 --> 08:21:47,340
The acronym reminded them of something. Oh, it happened a couple of hours ago now. Like sorry that you guys don't remember. Okay

6721
08:21:48,460 --> 08:21:50,460
sorry

6722
08:21:51,260 --> 08:21:54,380
Only people have been here from the very start understood any of that

6723
08:21:55,980 --> 08:21:57,980
I take a

6724
08:21:58,620 --> 08:22:07,180
Boss makes a dollar. I make a dime. That's why I take job beyond company time. Exactly as intended. So I'm gonna pay exactly

6725
08:22:09,580 --> 08:22:14,540
CBO too. What's the acronym central bank texas?

6726
08:22:15,980 --> 08:22:17,980
um

6727
08:22:18,620 --> 08:22:20,620
Oh, there's a bear

6728
08:22:21,260 --> 08:22:23,260
I

6729
08:22:25,020 --> 08:22:28,620
Mean as long as the bears. Oh my god, it's a ojisan in the wild

6730
08:22:30,220 --> 08:22:34,380
Okay, we got the map. That's fantastic. We're the heck Harvey. Okay, we're right down here

6731
08:22:36,220 --> 08:22:38,220
I'm following the reason

6732
08:22:39,340 --> 08:22:43,260
How many times would you be depositing them with drawing will at the

6733
08:22:44,300 --> 08:22:49,020
central bank of texas? I don't even know what we're trying to do with the euphemism

6734
08:22:51,180 --> 08:22:54,060
Okay, but I don't get it. English isn't my first one. Um

6735
08:22:56,060 --> 08:22:58,060
CBT

6736
08:22:59,980 --> 08:23:03,660
Is uh acronym for

6737
08:23:07,820 --> 08:23:12,060
Hold on, let me pick up these flowers like when a woman

6738
08:23:13,580 --> 08:23:15,580
And a man get together

6739
08:23:16,620 --> 08:23:19,420
And the man has two boiled eggs on them

6740
08:23:20,940 --> 08:23:23,740
And then she will she like steps on her

6741
08:23:24,300 --> 08:23:27,660
On the eggs and he goes hey, those are my eggs

6742
08:23:28,060 --> 08:23:31,740
But instead of feeling sad about her stepping on his eggs

6743
08:23:33,020 --> 08:23:36,780
His he he he's like he he enjoys it

6744
08:23:39,820 --> 08:23:43,340
Rock and ball torture. Oh my god, then most of you're gonna have to forgive me

6745
08:23:44,300 --> 08:23:46,700
I swear but most of every time you see me alive

6746
08:23:46,700 --> 08:23:52,300
You must your eyes must rule out of your skull being like she said she's gonna do this goddamn

6747
08:23:52,780 --> 08:23:56,380
ASMR collab and then you see me sitting streaming for 12 hours

6748
08:23:58,060 --> 08:24:03,180
Honestly, I'd be fed up of myself. So don't worry if you ever feel fed up towards me

6749
08:24:10,700 --> 08:24:12,300
Uh

6750
08:24:12,300 --> 08:24:16,300
I will never forgive you stony bad girl bad girl honestly

6751
08:24:16,860 --> 08:24:18,860
Jiki jiki

6752
08:24:19,820 --> 08:24:22,140
She's just sitting in the villa streaming literally

6753
08:24:23,180 --> 08:24:25,180
Mamosa refland

6754
08:24:25,260 --> 08:24:29,100
Don't you guys forget that one of us one of us one of us

6755
08:24:31,260 --> 08:24:33,260
Are we about to the beat of the game?

6756
08:24:34,220 --> 08:24:35,900
I don't know

6757
08:24:35,900 --> 08:24:41,180
There is a limited amount of flasks in the world. I have no idea what they're going

6758
08:24:41,740 --> 08:24:47,740
Ooh the rocks are floating. Whose connection is that? Is that my connection or his connection?

6759
08:24:50,540 --> 08:24:52,540
Must be

6760
08:24:52,860 --> 08:24:56,220
Okay, it's your connection because you're a stan moment

6761
08:24:58,540 --> 08:25:01,420
She has a membership too. That's when you know that's when you know

6762
08:25:03,100 --> 08:25:05,100
Me who doesn't have a membership to Mamosa

6763
08:25:07,260 --> 08:25:08,860
Smile

6764
08:25:08,860 --> 08:25:10,860
Ah these sheep

6765
08:25:10,860 --> 08:25:13,820
Stony you can step on my egg. Am I allowed?

6766
08:25:15,180 --> 08:25:17,500
Are you going for it? Oh, he's going for it

6767
08:25:21,660 --> 08:25:23,660
Is he gonna let me do it?

6768
08:25:25,900 --> 08:25:29,980
Oh my god, wait, why do you guys do such a whack and I don't

6769
08:25:30,700 --> 08:25:34,780
Oh wait, hold on two-handed hold y right bumper to two-handed. Okay

6770
08:25:35,980 --> 08:25:37,980

6771
08:25:38,220 --> 08:25:40,220
Oh, I know you've blown a horn. Whoa

6772
08:25:42,940 --> 08:25:47,740
Okay, there's something in here. I'll let you guys fight. We'll start discover what is in the back of this carriage

6773
08:25:48,300 --> 08:25:51,340
It's a great axe. Okay, we'll be honest. Don't think we need a great axe

6774
08:25:52,140 --> 08:25:55,100
Not monetized queen soon though. Soon TM

6775
08:25:56,380 --> 08:25:58,380
Soon TM

6776
08:25:58,540 --> 08:26:00,540
You'll get there

6777
08:26:01,500 --> 08:26:03,500
Oh

6778
08:26:07,820 --> 08:26:09,820
Okay, we follow the torch

6779
08:26:10,380 --> 08:26:13,740
We use our eyeballs and follow the torch. Why yes, of course

6780
08:26:14,460 --> 08:26:17,740
It's really just an okay axe and my axe

6781
08:26:19,020 --> 08:26:21,020
You have my bear

6782
08:26:21,100 --> 08:26:23,100
under my axe

6783
08:26:23,820 --> 08:26:25,820
Thank you

6784
08:26:26,620 --> 08:26:30,140
Wait a minute. I think you're not my friend

6785
08:26:36,060 --> 08:26:44,460
I'm muted and I and the OBS studio shows you if you're making a sound or not while muted

6786
08:26:45,980 --> 08:26:48,860
I in the microphone heard it. It would have been over

6787
08:26:49,740 --> 08:26:56,220
I've mained and my tentacle. That's the same you guys are have mained in

6788
08:26:57,500 --> 08:27:01,340
How you doing it? Honestly, I have to admit this is gonna sound really weird

6789
08:27:01,420 --> 08:27:06,700
It's actually really funny and like a dog errands. I don't have to think or do anything. I'm just happy to be here

6790
08:27:07,820 --> 08:27:13,980
Like this is so fun. I'm just like talking away. Blip. Blip. Blip. Blip. Blip. And I was like, oh, and you raise it. Oh, and you

6791
08:27:14,620 --> 08:27:16,620
Flask, oh, oh this, oh that

6792
08:27:17,580 --> 08:27:21,980
Stony season's ended like her full name in a trance. What does that mean?

6793
08:27:26,220 --> 08:27:28,220
We've done a momo shirt to bring this

6794
08:27:30,220 --> 08:27:32,220
Uh

6795
08:27:32,460 --> 08:27:38,620
What castle and flowers. Sorry. I got distracted by the pretty flowers. Tee hee. Honest to say

6796
08:27:39,980 --> 08:27:42,540
Is this where the last piece is?

6797
08:27:43,500 --> 08:27:46,620
The bench between asleep people

6798
08:27:47,900 --> 08:27:50,780
Handholding is the most fun and best way literally

6799
08:27:51,820 --> 08:27:54,460
You said it was a noise that you wouldn't want us to hear. No

6800
08:27:55,740 --> 08:27:57,740
You're not allowed

6801
08:27:59,020 --> 08:28:04,220
Because once you do it, you can never go back once you brap you can never unbrap

6802
08:28:08,540 --> 08:28:11,660
Honestly for me, it's not that serious that really

6803
08:28:12,940 --> 08:28:14,940
What

6804
08:28:17,180 --> 08:28:19,180
Wait

6805
08:28:20,140 --> 08:28:22,140
Why can't I progress?

6806
08:28:25,180 --> 08:28:31,500
They're going for it. I can't progress. Why would I need you guys not to be here? I'm about to do another boss fight

6807
08:28:32,460 --> 08:28:34,460
I bet or not

6808
08:28:37,100 --> 08:28:41,180
It's the wall again, I can't believe it three year old be sure to hit the wall at three year old

6809
08:28:42,140 --> 08:28:44,140
What no refling you can

6810
08:28:55,980 --> 08:28:57,980
Because you're crossing a boom boundary

6811
08:28:59,340 --> 08:29:01,340
Uh

6812
08:29:03,900 --> 08:29:08,780
Uh, I'm gonna get on torrent. I don't trust this at all

6813
08:29:11,580 --> 08:29:13,580
There's a thing right

6814
08:29:15,180 --> 08:29:18,060
Can I wait can I just summon you guys like right here?

6815
08:29:19,580 --> 08:29:25,980
I can so why did it even make you this with the because it's like a new loaded area? That's

6816
08:29:26,540 --> 08:29:28,700
Pretty plausible explanation

6817
08:29:29,420 --> 08:29:31,420
That it's a new load in area

6818
08:29:32,700 --> 08:29:36,380
Grass ahead no enemies. He was just a wee fellow

6819
08:29:37,100 --> 08:29:38,940
Oh

6820
08:29:38,940 --> 08:29:42,700
Yeah, background load in shenanigans. Okay. I understand that then that makes sense

6821
08:29:43,580 --> 08:29:49,340
Because if it wasn't then I'm angry because I want maybe something but if not, then fame

6822
08:29:49,900 --> 08:29:54,380
I'll allow it to get there. I'm gonna do a little cheeky little cheeky head and load in the screen

6823
08:29:55,500 --> 08:29:57,500
Um

6824
08:29:59,020 --> 08:30:01,020
I love

6825
08:30:01,740 --> 08:30:05,340
Yeah, it's just new can any other leaflings come in

6826
08:30:08,460 --> 08:30:10,460
Or is it because of something too far so doesn't

6827
08:30:11,980 --> 08:30:15,580
I don't mean to be an adversary, but I'm gonna need some help. Okay. I'm gonna need some backup

6828
08:30:17,740 --> 08:30:20,380
I'm wondering I think I'm gonna be honest

6829
08:30:20,460 --> 08:30:23,580
I think a lot of people might just sleep or they can't stream

6830
08:30:24,860 --> 08:30:27,580
Because the before the pool was massive

6831
08:30:28,300 --> 08:30:35,820
But you guys are allowed to break okay, he's don't ever feel bad if you like can't join me or can't get in or anything like that

6832
08:30:39,900 --> 08:30:41,900
Hmm

6833
08:30:42,860 --> 08:30:48,060
You can stream snake. I keep putting my sign down, but does that show up? Hmm

6834
08:30:50,140 --> 08:30:55,020
Sorry, I'm addicted to playing the dlc. Honestly, maybe if there's leaflings that are playing the dlc

6835
08:30:55,180 --> 08:30:58,460
Maybe that's wiser for when we go back to the dlc

6836
08:30:59,100 --> 08:31:05,580
I actually don't mind that concept. So maybe keep going ahead for me if that's possible

6837
08:31:08,300 --> 08:31:11,500
Yeah, the further you go because the difficulty gap is getting massive

6838
08:31:11,740 --> 08:31:18,380
Okay, no, don't worry about joining. Please don't worry like we just been chilling. Don't you want being chilling?

6839
08:31:19,340 --> 08:31:27,580
Are you all red so I can spot you? Okay, let's go

6840
08:31:31,020 --> 08:31:35,260
Oh, I need the blessing. I forget every time that I need to bless you guys when you come in

6841
08:31:37,660 --> 08:31:39,660
Do you have to lie down?

6842
08:31:40,700 --> 08:31:42,700
Okay ready steady

6843
08:31:45,260 --> 08:31:47,260
And I've led you into temptation

6844
08:31:49,340 --> 08:31:54,540
Wow hold y bumper 200

6845
08:31:56,300 --> 08:31:59,580
Pretty sure I just beat the main part of the dlc. So we'll be good. Okay

6846
08:32:01,100 --> 08:32:03,100
Yeah, we didn't some exploring

6847
08:32:03,340 --> 08:32:09,900
Is level 42 anywhere enough to help you um in where I am? Yes, actually. Hello

6848
08:32:11,660 --> 08:32:13,340
Hello

6849
08:32:13,340 --> 08:32:15,340
Is somebody there? Yes me?

6850
08:32:16,620 --> 08:32:18,620
Yeah, of course. My name is arena

6851
08:32:19,180 --> 08:32:21,580
I've escaped from castle mooring to the south

6852
08:32:22,380 --> 08:32:24,380
Servants there have rebelled

6853
08:32:24,540 --> 08:32:25,740
I

6854
08:32:25,740 --> 08:32:27,740
I can't be sure what it is

6855
08:32:27,820 --> 08:32:33,580
My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see, but I swear I heard frightful howling from all over

6856
08:32:34,140 --> 08:32:38,540
My good father secreted me at the castle, but decided himself to stay

6857
08:32:39,740 --> 08:32:41,740
He says it's his duty

6858
08:32:42,220 --> 08:32:44,220
As commander

6859
08:32:44,860 --> 08:32:47,740
The accent sounds familiar. Is that a ba we know?

6860
08:32:48,940 --> 08:32:50,220
I

6861
08:32:50,220 --> 08:32:52,220
I fear for father's life

6862
08:32:52,300 --> 08:32:54,300
The servants are full wrath

6863
08:32:54,780 --> 08:32:59,980
Filled with hatred for every one of us. They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with

6864
08:33:00,700 --> 08:33:05,340
They haven't spared a soul. I fear it's no different at castle mooring. Please

6865
08:33:06,060 --> 08:33:07,420
I implore you

6866
08:33:07,420 --> 08:33:09,420
Would you mind taking a letter to my father

6867
08:33:10,140 --> 08:33:12,860
At the castle and my soul wishes that he escaped

6868
08:33:13,740 --> 08:33:16,300
Even if his honor should be the price, please

6869
08:33:17,660 --> 08:33:19,660
I just want him to be safe

6870
08:33:20,620 --> 08:33:23,020
Of the region I'll deliver the layer

6871
08:33:24,300 --> 08:33:26,300
Dearly then please

6872
08:33:26,940 --> 08:33:30,220
Take this. Yeah, we'll deliver a letter. Come on. Let's go. Okay

6873
08:33:30,300 --> 08:33:36,060
Deliver it to my father who remains in the castle if you please. Yeah, sure Ray. Let's go find your dad

6874
08:33:37,020 --> 08:33:39,180
The castle's done here. What are you?

6875
08:33:40,780 --> 08:33:44,060
Are you spelling out a word or is this just a pose in particular?

6876
08:33:45,100 --> 08:33:51,100
She needs some yummy grapes. Don't think so. I mean like the regional accent, but I can't put my finger on it

6877
08:33:51,980 --> 08:33:54,540
Um, a lot of the voices are actually Welsh

6878
08:33:55,420 --> 08:33:58,700
Um, I'm hearing Welsh voices a lot in this game

6879
08:33:59,900 --> 08:34:04,300
Um, which is nice. You don't really get to hear the Welsh accent at all

6880
08:34:04,380 --> 08:34:07,980
It's kind of like one of those forgotten accents. It's very strong

6881
08:34:10,300 --> 08:34:12,300
Very very strong

6882
08:34:13,020 --> 08:34:15,020
Wait, does he not even attack?

6883
08:34:15,180 --> 08:34:17,180
I'm gonna have to get that pose

6884
08:34:19,900 --> 08:34:21,900
Uh, this should be re-grapes

6885
08:34:23,660 --> 08:34:25,660
Are they nutrition?

6886
08:34:25,820 --> 08:34:27,820
They're looking for me here

6887
08:34:28,460 --> 08:34:31,660
A morning star and it's literally, uh

6888
08:34:32,620 --> 08:34:34,620
Jack is me

6889
08:34:42,220 --> 08:34:44,220
I think I

6890
08:34:44,860 --> 08:34:47,740
Yeah, believe it's a Welsh pronunciation. Oh blaz

6891
08:34:52,540 --> 08:34:54,860
Am I beating this up fucking come here

6892
08:34:56,060 --> 08:34:57,340
Take this

6893
08:34:57,340 --> 08:34:59,340
No, you're gonna win

6894
08:34:59,340 --> 08:35:04,860
I've got matey shot. I don't think I've ever seen a crossbow run of this game. I'm gonna be honest

6895
08:35:07,500 --> 08:35:12,940
It's an I've never seen it if you read the description of weapons and gear these things have a wee hidden buff as well

6896
08:35:13,580 --> 08:35:15,580
Honestly, don't mind buzz

6897
08:35:17,100 --> 08:35:19,260
Let me grab this little phone ring here

6898
08:35:20,060 --> 08:35:24,540
The morning star can get you after every hit. It can heal you after every hit

6899
08:35:24,700 --> 08:35:32,060
Uh, if my memory serves me correct, there's a horse guy that's ready to attack behind this

6900
08:35:33,020 --> 08:35:36,860
Uh, bang. Do you have any stone? You do. I'm sorry to see

6901
08:35:38,540 --> 08:35:40,540
Do you have anything else that we use?

6902
08:35:43,820 --> 08:35:45,820
I guess if you want to do like a hundred percent

6903
08:35:46,620 --> 08:35:48,620
Collection, uh being interesting

6904
08:35:49,740 --> 08:35:52,460
I mean, I have so many souls I can just buy out the shot

6905
08:35:54,940 --> 08:35:56,940
I

6906
08:35:57,660 --> 08:36:00,460
Only at night they're called night riders. Okay, we're safe for now

6907
08:36:03,420 --> 08:36:05,420
I do love a good hidden status

6908
08:36:06,220 --> 08:36:07,500
It's kind of like

6909
08:36:07,500 --> 08:36:14,140
Um, I don't know if you guys have ever played this game called darkest dungeon. I've never managed to finish it always gets stuck

6910
08:36:14,860 --> 08:36:21,020
But I've always thoroughly enjoyed the game when I've played it for like my two hours before getting absolutely gridlocked

6911
08:36:21,500 --> 08:36:23,500
I'm just stuck at it

6912
08:36:23,980 --> 08:36:29,980
The game's like, oh your characters are supposed to die. Don't worry about it. And I'm like

6913
08:36:31,100 --> 08:36:33,580
But if they die, how am I supposed to progress?

6914
08:36:34,860 --> 08:36:37,500
Because like they're my strongest character type thing

6915
08:36:38,380 --> 08:36:41,500
And I just find it really hard and like, I know

6916
08:36:42,220 --> 08:36:46,860
I don't know if I should like mod it or get or if you guys want to vulture it

6917
08:36:46,860 --> 08:36:51,500
You guys tell me like the best thing to do. I'd probably need to watch a YouTube tutorial though

6918
08:36:52,460 --> 08:36:59,820
On it because I wouldn't want to play a stream game that I completely mess up like I kind of learned my lesson not to be silly

6919
08:37:00,220 --> 08:37:01,420
and

6920
08:37:01,420 --> 08:37:06,940
I was like picking a game that like I have my doubts that I'd enjoy and then play it anyway like

6921
08:37:07,420 --> 08:37:09,900
Boutro was interesting because I could hear a shot

6922
08:37:10,460 --> 08:37:15,260
And like it just went amazing like I genuinely cannot wait to play Boutro with you guys again

6923
08:37:15,740 --> 08:37:19,420
Um, and it was like so nice being able to be like, is this the right move?

6924
08:37:19,500 --> 08:37:24,140
Yeah, no, that's the right move. Like don't don't worry about it. You're doing great. Like that was so lovely

6925
08:37:24,780 --> 08:37:26,780
I'll really enjoy that

6926
08:37:27,020 --> 08:37:32,460
And like I love how you guys are like so non-judgmental about how dumb I can be. Is that a church back there?

6927
08:37:35,420 --> 08:37:41,340
I think I'll need to oh these things won't happen here. Have I been here? No, I haven't been here

6928
08:37:45,500 --> 08:37:48,620
Have you thought any more of them? No, we backed off

6929
08:37:49,500 --> 08:37:53,180
Unfortunately, I've come back because I need to upgrade my my

6930
08:37:54,060 --> 08:38:00,060
flasks and pouches and stuff because I'm just at a terrible just truly in wholeheartedly terrible

6931
08:38:01,820 --> 08:38:03,180
Um

6932
08:38:03,180 --> 08:38:08,620
So we're now back in the limb group area. We're just hunting for sacred tears for seeds

6933
08:38:09,260 --> 08:38:11,260
Just so I can get a few more pouches

6934
08:38:12,220 --> 08:38:19,340
Because I am basically getting completely princess carried. I have not done one proper thing

6935
08:38:20,300 --> 08:38:27,740
Like on my own. I genuinely haven't. We've been here since the moment in and I wouldn't have it any other way

6936
08:38:27,900 --> 08:38:32,300
I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm literally going. I feel like a dog on a walk

6937
08:38:32,780 --> 08:38:37,580
That just gets to have all the excitement of showing up at the destination like oh, what are we doing now?

6938
08:38:37,980 --> 08:38:39,980
Oh, that's lovely. Okay, let's go

6939
08:38:40,860 --> 08:38:42,860
That is exactly what you want

6940
08:38:44,300 --> 08:38:46,300
You sold a guy in the belfry

6941
08:38:47,340 --> 08:38:48,620
well

6942
08:38:48,620 --> 08:38:54,380
That's debatable considering how many levels I got shoved up to thanks to rieflings

6943
08:38:55,020 --> 08:38:58,540
putting all their stonk. There's there's soul stonks into me

6944
08:38:59,980 --> 08:39:01,980
and

6945
08:39:02,220 --> 08:39:05,740
Donna Donna has some darkest dungeon mechanic and it's a colorful

6946
08:39:06,700 --> 08:39:08,380
alternative version

6947
08:39:08,460 --> 08:39:10,460
and the streamer mode has

6948
08:39:11,820 --> 08:39:13,820
That survived on youtube

6949
08:39:14,860 --> 08:39:18,300
It's very strange what things will fly and not fly

6950
08:39:19,020 --> 08:39:23,980
Like one game would do it with a different art style and it's fine. But another game is like not as to work

6951
08:39:25,500 --> 08:39:31,580
Um, it really is this massive great area at the moment, which is a shame because like I'm sure

6952
08:39:32,300 --> 08:39:36,220
Now obviously company wants to make money, but that show people behind it

6953
08:39:36,780 --> 08:39:42,300
I'm sure like they never want their the people that create content to ever be unsure

6954
08:39:43,180 --> 08:39:44,940
of what the rules are

6955
08:39:44,940 --> 08:39:46,940
like the people behind the scenes that actually

6956
08:39:47,420 --> 08:39:52,620
care about like creators and like I understand like hey, this is your income source. This is serious like

6957
08:39:53,340 --> 08:39:55,660
um, obviously as there is just on her

6958
08:39:57,100 --> 08:40:01,820
Monetization celebration stream. Hopefully it went well actually. I had no idea how it went because you know

6959
08:40:02,780 --> 08:40:07,260
I've been going crazy over here for a little bit. Um, but like

6960
08:40:08,620 --> 08:40:11,740
Basically azura got rejected for monetization

6961
08:40:12,620 --> 08:40:17,660
But youtube now has an appeal system in place and we appealed it and to my surprise

6962
08:40:18,300 --> 08:40:21,980
They monetize her and now she has an like an income source now. She

6963
08:40:22,620 --> 08:40:28,140
Is like genuinely like a full content creator now. She has an income source. She has these avenues like

6964
08:40:28,860 --> 08:40:35,900
But if youtube denied it then like azura can't even like plan to move out at all like she just has the

6965
08:40:36,700 --> 08:40:41,980
She would have had to wait a whole other month like type thing. So I have to admit there are doing changes in that

6966
08:40:42,460 --> 08:40:44,460
Like I don't hate

6967
08:40:44,940 --> 08:40:47,980
YouTube as a whole because it is a good platform

6968
08:40:48,860 --> 08:40:51,740
It discover abilities really good as well

6969
08:40:52,140 --> 08:40:56,060
Not for a live stream discover ability of the live streamer isn't good

6970
08:40:56,300 --> 08:41:03,020
But if you produce alternative content like asmr short for example that discover ability is so valuable

6971
08:41:03,100 --> 08:41:08,940
Whereas if you want to compare it to like switch for example, it's just no the same like it's just not hanging

6972
08:41:09,980 --> 08:41:17,340
Very uh uncharacteristic of youtube too much alleviation. Well, actually I was like, um

6973
08:41:18,300 --> 08:41:24,140
Uh azura's goobies are like what stopped her but the problem was her appeal rejection

6974
08:41:24,700 --> 08:41:26,700
actually didn't mention

6975
08:41:27,100 --> 08:41:29,100
actually gratifying content

6976
08:41:29,900 --> 08:41:31,500
um

6977
08:41:31,500 --> 08:41:37,340
So I was like wait, this must be a mistake then because when youtube don't actually give a reason

6978
08:41:39,580 --> 08:41:41,580
I don't know if it's possible

6979
08:41:41,660 --> 08:41:45,980
We got reviewed like her channel got reviewed by someone that doesn't like anime

6980
08:41:46,940 --> 08:41:49,740
Look, I wouldn't be surprised it's plausible

6981
08:41:50,220 --> 08:41:57,260
And but the appeal went through that's the main thing azura now has a another income source on top of patreon on top of uwu market

6982
08:41:57,740 --> 08:41:59,260
and

6983
08:41:59,260 --> 08:42:06,220
And hopefully there'll be something else. How do you guys remember where the churches are literally straight led me straight to a church

6984
08:42:06,220 --> 08:42:08,220
I don't know how you do that

6985
08:42:09,660 --> 08:42:15,420
Is this like when I'm like here's all the strats in viva finata you guys like here's all the strats in elden ring

6986
08:42:15,980 --> 08:42:17,980
I don't know how you do that

6987
08:42:18,300 --> 08:42:20,300
Oh, they're on the map. Oh

6988
08:42:21,980 --> 08:42:23,980
Another sacred tear

6989
08:42:25,340 --> 08:42:32,700
Everyone should be monetized. Yes, everyone is monetized officially on youtube. Um, I think uh

6990
08:42:34,060 --> 08:42:36,060
Management are gonna do like

6991
08:42:37,740 --> 08:42:40,620
About it at some point, but I'll definitely like

6992
08:42:41,580 --> 08:42:44,700
Oh my god, congrats girls like pat them all on the back like

6993
08:42:45,660 --> 08:42:47,660
Yeah, they did it. They did it

6994
08:42:48,060 --> 08:42:50,060
There's steps to being a content creator

6995
08:42:50,940 --> 08:42:53,900
Sorry, I feel time content creator. Oh that yellow fish

6996
08:42:54,940 --> 08:42:56,940
Wait, where we going?

6997
08:42:57,180 --> 08:42:59,180
Do we know

6998
08:42:59,660 --> 08:43:01,660
Follow the light

6999
08:43:02,620 --> 08:43:04,940
It's just like you in Assassin's Creed brotherhood really impressive

7000
08:43:04,940 --> 08:43:06,860
So you just shoot off all that info about the game

7001
08:43:06,860 --> 08:43:10,940
Okay, I'll take it that way then because I'm like there's no way on earth

7002
08:43:11,020 --> 08:43:16,140
I could remember where the locations or churches are that have sacred tears inside

7003
08:43:17,420 --> 08:43:20,140
Her voice is so good. They thought it wasn't real

7004
08:43:20,620 --> 08:43:24,780
Literally, I had to write the cringiest script for her. Maybe she'll find it funny

7005
08:43:25,260 --> 08:43:30,060
Um, and we could like show it on twitter or something because uh, zura is such a good sport

7006
08:43:30,140 --> 08:43:34,940
Like she's so down for anything. I'll like suggest something to her and she's like, yeah. Yeah

7007
08:43:35,580 --> 08:43:39,180
I like she's so that is such a good sport. Fantastic. Um

7008
08:43:39,740 --> 08:43:46,060
She might find it funny if I show her the wee video that we had to appeal the monetization with

7009
08:43:46,060 --> 08:43:48,620
Oh, I can put up Azura's meme ASMR now

7010
08:43:50,540 --> 08:43:56,220
Oh my god, then all of her meme ASMR's are up. Oh, thank the heavens. Right. I'll need to keep that in the back of my mind

7011
08:43:57,820 --> 08:44:00,220
Oh, jeez. Sorry. I was both listening to her

7012
08:44:02,140 --> 08:44:04,140
Um

7013
08:44:04,860 --> 08:44:06,860
Yeah, I can put up her

7014
08:44:07,740 --> 08:44:09,740
Oh

7015
08:44:13,340 --> 08:44:20,140
Sorry, I'm getting yawning because I had something a winged size. Oh, that's what that crazy weapon is. You guys are so coming with

7016
08:44:20,940 --> 08:44:22,940
um

7017
08:44:25,500 --> 08:44:29,580
Only need to remember 12 churches and forget how many seats along the way

7018
08:44:30,620 --> 08:44:33,420
I mean, we're definitely freaking getting are you joking?

7019
08:44:34,300 --> 08:44:36,300
I

7020
08:44:37,100 --> 08:44:46,300
Wondering why Azura didn't have any ASMR uphills that were in line. Yes. So those meme ASMR's those originally were actually supposed to go up

7021
08:44:47,180 --> 08:44:49,180
in order to get the

7022
08:44:50,940 --> 08:44:52,940
Watch time for monetization

7023
08:44:53,020 --> 08:44:58,380
However, the debut went so well that everyone reached the watch time after debut

7024
08:44:58,860 --> 08:45:01,900
YouTube just took an entire week to update the stats

7025
08:45:02,700 --> 08:45:05,980
And then like one after one we did our celebration

7026
08:45:06,620 --> 08:45:12,940
But Azura behind the scenes actually got denied and we're having to make this like silly appeal of video. She's like

7027
08:45:14,460 --> 08:45:18,140
It's so cringe. They're like explain how you make content

7028
08:45:18,700 --> 08:45:22,780
And I had to like type of sense for her to say I am a live streamer

7029
08:45:23,020 --> 08:45:27,020
I make my content live you can see via the evidence of all my live streams

7030
08:45:27,100 --> 08:45:30,780
I play video games live like it just got really silly and arbitrary

7031
08:45:31,420 --> 08:45:34,460
But the silly and arbitrary work. So I'm not even mad

7032
08:45:35,420 --> 08:45:36,780
um

7033
08:45:36,780 --> 08:45:41,100
Like I'm just glad they genuinely that appeal process actually works

7034
08:45:41,580 --> 08:45:47,900
Like as much as youtube bad warning for kind of meme stuff or whatever a great area on ASMR now

7035
08:45:48,620 --> 08:45:56,220
I'll I have to I have to put my hands up. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. Um, I have to put my hands up and say, you know what?

7036
08:45:57,660 --> 08:45:59,660
We're

7037
08:45:59,740 --> 08:46:01,740
What's that? Oh

7038
08:46:01,900 --> 08:46:03,900
Where are we going? I don't think

7039
08:46:04,220 --> 08:46:07,100
Anyone knows where we're going. Oh, he's okay. He's down there. He's down there

7040
08:46:08,380 --> 08:46:10,380
Go down go down

7041
08:46:10,860 --> 08:46:12,060
um

7042
08:46:12,060 --> 08:46:15,900
I have to put my hands up and say, you know what youtube put this appeal system in place

7043
08:46:16,460 --> 08:46:20,140
for things that happen and it actually did help us out

7044
08:46:20,380 --> 08:46:24,540
Whereas old youtube didn't have an appeal system. So Azura would have had to have waited

7045
08:46:25,260 --> 08:46:27,260
30 days on top of

7046
08:46:27,900 --> 08:46:31,420
Uh, what she had already streamed at that point

7047
08:46:32,380 --> 08:46:34,380
um

7048
08:46:34,460 --> 08:46:38,300
So yeah, sorry. I have to admit youtube definitely won there. Um

7049
08:46:39,820 --> 08:46:44,060
With that one, I do appreciate the appeal process actually working

7050
08:46:46,940 --> 08:46:49,260
The bell tolls for the a better not

7051
08:46:50,540 --> 08:46:52,540
I need to keep my voice

7052
08:46:52,620 --> 08:46:56,700
I'm actually a bit worried about my voice breaking a little bit. Where are we at? Oh, no

7053
08:46:58,220 --> 08:47:03,180
We're almost at nine hours and I'm like, is my voice gonna break before then

7054
08:47:05,420 --> 08:47:07,260
Oh, no

7055
08:47:07,260 --> 08:47:09,740
I can feel it breaking though, which is not only

7056
08:47:11,100 --> 08:47:13,260
Slight problem. I need to maybe not

7057
08:47:14,380 --> 08:47:17,260
The thing is I don't want to stream like completely monotone

7058
08:47:17,900 --> 08:47:22,940
But the completely monotone is what helped me not break my voice

7059
08:47:23,500 --> 08:47:26,460
Hydrate how about I make a cup of tea in 10 minutes?

7060
08:47:27,100 --> 08:47:29,100
That sounds like a deal

7061
08:47:30,780 --> 08:47:32,780
Um

7062
08:47:33,260 --> 08:47:35,260
And we'll get some water bottle and all that

7063
08:47:36,860 --> 08:47:42,460
Whole ass family, but me's got COVID can I get a good look like it? Yeah, you're gonna catch this shit. I'm sorry

7064
08:47:43,020 --> 08:47:46,940
Unless you're like unless you have like a separate bathroom

7065
08:47:47,740 --> 08:47:54,300
And you can just grab like take away food without them like being in the kitchen or interacting. Sorry, you're getting COVID

7066
08:47:57,420 --> 08:47:59,100

Oh, no enemy you

Why are you pointing into it? You're the one who's to go get them

7071
08:48:12,780 --> 08:48:16,220
It's you two that needs to go get them. Not me. I'm too scared

7072
08:48:18,060 --> 08:48:20,060
Okay, let's see if we can do it

7073
08:48:21,740 --> 08:48:23,900

But all is good

7143
08:54:47,660 --> 08:54:51,500
As they say in the Netherlands they go they say all is good

7144
08:54:52,540 --> 08:54:54,540
That's how they say. How are you?

7145
08:54:55,260 --> 08:54:59,660
In the Netherlands they say all is good. Nothing. That's a good sentence. Like all is good. Yeah, I'm really yeah

7146

All is good now. I can't believe all is good

08:55:44,220 --> 08:55:48,540
If she only was a grass. Hey, we'd be leaflings. Oh, that's so cute

7154
08:55:50,700 --> 08:55:55,340
My little leaflings. What if I was a firetape? What would you be high?

7155
08:55:56,620 --> 08:56:00,140

We're getting bunched up. No

7164
08:56:50,140 --> 08:56:52,140
Oh, that is a creepy design

7165
08:56:53,980 --> 08:57:00,940
I see this every time my hat goes off to the development team for making some creepy that frost bait

7166
08:57:01,900 --> 08:57:07,740
And it looks like frost bait by yeah. Oh, no

7167
08:57:09,500 --> 08:57:16,140
Oh, no, this can't be my riffling zone. Oh, no, it's up to the other

7168
08:57:22,860 --> 08:57:24,860
Wow

08:57:31,980 --> 08:57:35,980
I'm helping I did I did 60 down a 600 damage

7171
08:57:40,060 --> 08:57:42,060
What is frost bait doing?

7172
08:57:47,180 --> 08:57:52,300
200 damage. That's great. Oh, how did I miss I didn't even

7173
08:57:55,020 --> 08:57:57,020
Oh

7174
08:58:11,580 --> 08:58:13,580

7180
08:58:35,740 --> 08:58:42,140
Surely I will make it once the frost bait mirrors felt effect is triggered dealing damage and for a 30 second duration

7181
08:58:42,620 --> 08:58:44,620
Increases damage for 20%

7182
08:58:46,540 --> 08:58:50,380
I ate huge damage and then immediately got frostbitten. Oh

7183
08:58:53,020 --> 08:58:57,980
It was infamilar with the boss didn't know I was gonna eat all that yum yum yum that yummy damage you didn't know

7184
08:59:02,940 --> 08:59:04,940
But you did amazing though we won

7185
08:59:07,100 --> 08:59:12,780
I'll teleport back to that loading site, but I do want to be able to see the map just so

7186
08:59:13,260 --> 08:59:21,260
So I can see I know cartographers anyone any any cartographers any map appreciators

7187
08:59:22,700 --> 08:59:28,300
And if you're a map, I think if you're a map maker, you're a cartographer

7188
08:59:30,300 --> 08:59:32,300
Yeah

7189
08:59:33,260 --> 08:59:38,780
Oh, there's a site here as well reflames. These are too smart. How do you know I'm gonna be here?

7190
08:59:40,700 --> 08:59:42,700
Actually

7191
08:59:43,340 --> 08:59:45,340
Actually, oh

7192
08:59:47,260 --> 08:59:49,260
I've got the map

7193
08:59:51,900 --> 08:59:54,220
I don't know if there's anyone else that's trying to get in

7194
08:59:56,300 --> 08:59:58,300
Right academy gate town

7195
08:59:58,620 --> 09:00:04,460

7196
09:00:04,780 --> 09:00:06,780
I'm glad you can find a game that you can enjoy

7197
09:00:07,020 --> 09:00:09,980
Seriously, it's so nice when you can find a game that you like

7198
09:00:10,540 --> 09:00:14,700
Um, and then you can just have a fun time with like it is really good

7199
09:00:15,100 --> 09:00:18,540
Right give me four minutes. I'm gonna make a cup of tea and make sure the cats are okay

7200
09:00:18,620 --> 09:00:24,700
Because I think I just scared the living daylights out of gimley. I basically flew out of that door and then

7201
09:00:26,380 --> 09:00:29,100
Like burst out and like there you go

7202
09:00:29,740 --> 09:00:31,740
But no all is good

7203
09:00:31,740 --> 09:00:34,540
Yeah, I'll be four minutes roughly. I'll get a cup of tea. I'm gonna get another

7204
09:00:35,180 --> 09:00:37,180

09:00:52,620 --> 09:00:54,140
Are you there?

09:14:06,740 --> 09:14:16,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7259
09:14:16,740 --> 09:14:26,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7260
09:14:26,740 --> 09:14:34,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7261
09:14:34,740 --> 09:14:44,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7262
09:14:44,740 --> 09:14:54,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7263
09:14:54,740 --> 09:15:02,740

09:15:22,740 --> 09:15:30,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7267
09:15:30,740 --> 09:15:40,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7268
09:15:40,740 --> 09:15:50,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7269
09:15:50,740 --> 09:15:58,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7270
09:15:58,740 --> 09:16:08,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7271
09:16:08,740 --> 09:16:18,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7272
09:16:18,740 --> 09:16:26,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7273
09:16:26,740 --> 09:16:36,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7274
09:16:36,740 --> 09:16:46,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7275
09:16:46,740 --> 09:16:56,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7276
09:16:56,740 --> 09:17:06,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7277
09:17:06,740 --> 09:17:14,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7278
09:17:14,740 --> 09:17:24,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7279
09:17:24,740 --> 09:17:34,740
Are you squinting me right now?

7280
09:17:34,740 --> 09:17:38,740
Is this a portal?

7281
09:17:38,740 --> 09:17:52,740
Examine the seal.

7282
09:17:52,740 --> 09:17:54,740
To the left, there's a save.

7283
09:17:54,740 --> 09:17:57,740
Yes! I remember!

7284
09:17:57,740 --> 09:17:59,740
Ah, I remember the person.

7285
09:17:59,740 --> 09:18:01,740
My hair was crazy.

7286
09:18:01,740 --> 09:18:03,740
Oh no, my scars on my legs are gone.

7287
09:18:03,740 --> 09:18:06,740
I thought it looked pretty cool.

7288
09:18:06,740 --> 09:18:09,740
I like that AC has scars.

7289
09:18:09,740 --> 09:18:13,740
Oh, there's two enemy reflexes.

7290
09:18:13,740 --> 09:18:15,740
Who's not being around me?

7291
09:18:15,740 --> 09:18:20,740
Oh man, I don't think I'm being around you.

7292
09:18:20,740 --> 09:18:26,740
Okay, we are now at East Raya Lucaria State.

7293
09:18:26,740 --> 09:18:36,740
Raya Lucaria.

7294
09:18:36,740 --> 09:18:41,740
I would skip for you to do it.

7295
09:18:41,740 --> 09:18:44,740
I love being like, come to the convention.

7296
09:18:44,740 --> 09:18:47,740
My A-Bone will prevent me.

7297
09:18:47,740 --> 09:18:53,740
There's only two that I've actually shown off.

7298
09:18:53,740 --> 09:18:57,740
I don't know if the loading symbols aren't working for everyone,

7299
09:18:57,740 --> 09:18:59,740
so I do apologize if you're trying,

7300
09:18:59,740 --> 09:19:01,740
but you don't keep displaying.

7301
09:19:01,740 --> 09:19:03,740
I'm not really sure what the deal is.

7302
09:19:03,740 --> 09:19:06,740
Although I have a slight inclination,

7303
09:19:06,740 --> 09:19:09,740
and I'm not saying that just because I'm a cuttlefish,

7304
09:19:09,740 --> 09:19:14,740
that the servers are probably overloaded like crazy right now

7305
09:19:14,740 --> 09:19:16,740
and are barely surviving.

7306
09:19:16,740 --> 09:19:20,740
So just bear with me.

7307
09:19:20,740 --> 09:19:27,740
As I said, I'm going to be playing this a lot until we're satisfied.

7308
09:19:27,740 --> 09:19:31,740
Would you like to all cower before me?

7309
09:19:31,740 --> 09:19:35,740
Time for your blessing!

7310
09:19:35,740 --> 09:19:37,740
All done!

7311
09:19:37,740 --> 09:19:39,740
You have been left.

7312
09:19:39,740 --> 09:19:40,740
Now I put the sword on.

7313
09:19:40,740 --> 09:19:41,740
Then right bumper.

7314
09:19:41,740 --> 09:19:42,740
No, sorry.

7315
09:19:42,740 --> 09:19:45,740
Why right bumper?

7316
09:19:45,740 --> 09:19:48,740
He's whimpering in response.

7317
09:19:48,740 --> 09:19:49,740
You have an inclination.

7318
09:19:49,740 --> 09:19:50,740
Literally, I'm like,

7319
09:19:50,740 --> 09:19:52,740
oh, inclination is such a good word.

7320
09:19:52,740 --> 09:19:56,740
I think it's a good ASMR as well.

7321
09:19:56,740 --> 09:19:58,740
Inclination.

7322
09:19:58,740 --> 09:20:00,740
Yeah.

7323
09:20:00,740 --> 09:20:02,740
I'm going to do some trigger words

7324
09:20:02,740 --> 09:20:06,740
that are all related to cuttlefish or whatever.

7325
09:20:06,740 --> 09:20:11,740
Inclination.

7326
09:20:11,740 --> 09:20:13,740
I like when ASMR sounds like they're beatboxes

7327
09:20:13,740 --> 09:20:16,740
and then they do trigger words.

7328
09:20:16,740 --> 09:20:18,740
It's really funny.

7329
09:20:18,740 --> 09:20:20,740
I'm not going to beatbox before anyone's like,

7330
09:20:20,740 --> 09:20:22,740
why would you beatbox?

7331
09:20:22,740 --> 09:20:24,740
Come this way.

7332
09:20:24,740 --> 09:20:27,740
Are we just going the same way anyway?

7333
09:20:27,740 --> 09:20:32,740
If that's your inclination.

7334
09:20:32,740 --> 09:20:37,740
Do you feel ever that we're so inclined?

7335
09:20:37,740 --> 09:20:40,740
Your car transaction has been inclined.

7336
09:20:40,740 --> 09:20:42,740
Wait, that's not even funny.

7337
09:20:42,740 --> 09:20:47,740
That doesn't even work in a sentence.

7338
09:20:47,740 --> 09:20:48,740
Pardon.

7339
09:20:48,740 --> 09:20:49,740
Are you guys in here?

7340
09:20:49,740 --> 09:20:54,740
Oh, you are in here.

7341
09:20:54,740 --> 09:20:57,740
Imagine a convention with 100 people in the floor

7342
09:20:57,740 --> 09:21:00,740
like a starfish waiting for a girl to stomp on them.

7343
09:21:00,740 --> 09:21:04,740
Sounds like a rifling convention of me or something.

7344
09:21:04,740 --> 09:21:06,740
I feel like it would be funny though.

7345
09:21:06,740 --> 09:21:10,740
But it's a wail day and appropriate.

7346
09:21:10,740 --> 09:21:12,740
I don't know.

7347
09:21:12,740 --> 09:21:14,740
Aren't you tired?

7348
09:21:14,740 --> 09:21:18,740
Aren't you tired of everything being the exact same?

7349
09:21:18,740 --> 09:21:20,740
Aren't you tired of never having the excitement

7350
09:21:20,740 --> 09:21:22,740
of something new?

7351
09:21:22,740 --> 09:21:24,740
Admit it.

7352
09:21:24,740 --> 09:21:26,740
What is this?

7353
09:21:26,740 --> 09:21:28,740
Why did the tree fall though?

7354
09:21:28,740 --> 09:21:31,740
Is the tree bad?

7355
09:21:31,740 --> 09:21:34,740
I would love it.

7356
09:21:34,740 --> 09:21:36,740
What is launching at us?

7357
09:21:36,740 --> 09:21:38,740
Something is going for us.

7358
09:21:38,740 --> 09:21:40,740
I don't know what.

7359
09:21:40,740 --> 09:21:42,740
Whoa.

7360
09:21:42,740 --> 09:21:44,740
Am I missing something?

7361
09:21:44,740 --> 09:21:45,740
Oh my god.

7362
09:21:45,740 --> 09:21:46,740
What are they called?

7363
09:21:46,740 --> 09:21:50,740
Trunchions or something.

7364
09:21:50,740 --> 09:21:53,740
I've completely forgotten what these freaking things are called.

7365
09:21:53,740 --> 09:21:58,740
But they're bad anyway.

7366
09:21:58,740 --> 09:21:59,740
A trebuchet.

7367
09:21:59,740 --> 09:22:00,740
Oh, a trebuchet.

7368
09:22:00,740 --> 09:22:01,740
It's trebuchet.

7369
09:22:01,740 --> 09:22:03,740
Not a truncheon.

7370
09:22:03,740 --> 09:22:07,740
Oh my god.

7371
09:22:07,740 --> 09:22:09,740
No, I can't hit him.

7372
09:22:09,740 --> 09:22:13,740
His butt is so exposed to me.

7373
09:22:13,740 --> 09:22:15,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7374
09:22:15,740 --> 09:22:18,740
I don't know how I'm perfectly avoiding you by accident.

7375
09:22:18,740 --> 09:22:20,740
Truly by accident.

7376
09:22:20,740 --> 09:22:23,740
I'm not even putting effort into trying to avoid him.

7377
09:22:23,740 --> 09:22:25,740
He's doing it all himself.

7378
09:22:25,740 --> 09:22:27,740
I don't want to spank the horror.

7379
09:22:27,740 --> 09:22:31,740
Something is wrong.

7380
09:22:31,740 --> 09:22:34,740
Oh, that's Gideon's magic.

7381
09:22:34,740 --> 09:22:37,740
Gideon does that in the Borscht.

7382
09:22:37,740 --> 09:22:42,740
Aw, I don't think having to compare the thing.

7383
09:22:42,740 --> 09:22:44,740
Oh my god.

7384
09:22:44,740 --> 09:22:46,740
You're gone.

7385
09:22:46,740 --> 09:22:47,740
I'm going to regret that.

7386
09:22:47,740 --> 09:22:50,740
I'm going to ruin you, buddy.

7387
09:22:50,740 --> 09:22:53,740
I'm trying to fade off the tiredness right now.

7388
09:22:53,740 --> 09:22:57,740
What do you mean streaming for nine hours makes people tired?

7389
09:22:57,740 --> 09:22:58,740
What are you talking about?

7390
09:22:58,740 --> 09:23:00,740
This isn't even possible.

7391
09:23:00,740 --> 09:23:05,740
In fact, the improbable occasion three.

7392
09:23:05,740 --> 09:23:06,740
We're going to the right.

7393
09:23:06,740 --> 09:23:07,740
Why are we going to the right?

7394
09:23:07,740 --> 09:23:09,740
Is there a thing here?

7395
09:23:09,740 --> 09:23:11,740
We're going to the right.

7396
09:23:11,740 --> 09:23:13,740
Spank the horse.

7397
09:23:13,740 --> 09:23:18,740
I've got reflexes by accident.

7398
09:23:18,740 --> 09:23:19,740
I don't know how.

7399
09:23:19,740 --> 09:23:20,740
I was like walking away from his attacks.

7400
09:23:20,740 --> 09:23:22,740
I wasn't even rolling out of them.

7401
09:23:22,740 --> 09:23:26,740
I'm just like, ooh, streamer luck.

7402
09:23:26,740 --> 09:23:28,740
It'd be funny to say the least seen thing

7403
09:23:28,740 --> 09:23:29,740
so many lean down.

7404
09:23:29,740 --> 09:23:30,740
I don't know.

7405
09:23:30,740 --> 09:23:34,740
I feel like that kind of like fun is like,

7406
09:23:34,740 --> 09:23:36,740
what are those like once in a lifetime,

7407
09:23:36,740 --> 09:23:37,740
like fun things?

7408
09:23:37,740 --> 09:23:39,740
Like, I don't know.

7409
09:23:39,740 --> 09:23:43,740
Like, I need to try and think of all the arguments

7410
09:23:43,740 --> 09:23:44,740
before I start arguing.

7411
09:23:44,740 --> 09:23:46,740
Like, what would someone say about it?

7412
09:23:46,740 --> 09:23:49,740
Oh, that's behaviors inappropriate.

7413
09:23:49,740 --> 09:23:50,740
We're all consenting adults.

7414
09:23:50,740 --> 09:23:51,740
So annihilated.

7415
09:23:51,740 --> 09:23:55,740
Wait, why am I getting madness?

7416
09:23:55,740 --> 09:23:56,740
Oh my god.

7417
09:23:56,740 --> 09:23:57,740
It's the Lord of the Rings tower.

7418
09:23:57,740 --> 09:23:58,740
How did I do this last time?

7419
09:23:58,740 --> 09:24:00,740
I'm pretty sure I did do this successfully

7420
09:24:00,740 --> 09:24:01,740
because I died.

7421
09:24:01,740 --> 09:24:02,740
And then like,

7422
09:24:02,740 --> 09:24:03,740
someone would be like, oh, that's so tacky.

7423
09:24:03,740 --> 09:24:05,740
Like, oh, she's just a Lutuber.

7424
09:24:05,740 --> 09:24:08,740
I never said I was going to fucking praise the Lord

7425
09:24:08,740 --> 09:24:09,740
in the middle of the stream.

7426
09:24:09,740 --> 09:24:11,740
I'm only going to praise him as a leaflin's tentacle.

7427
09:24:11,740 --> 09:24:13,740
So I don't know why you're getting cheeky.

7428
09:24:13,740 --> 09:24:15,740
How is this not seeing me?

7429
09:24:15,740 --> 09:24:17,740
It's so vague.

7430
09:24:17,740 --> 09:24:21,740
Well, their arguments could be made.

7431
09:24:21,740 --> 09:24:23,740
I can't think of anything.

7432
09:24:23,740 --> 09:24:24,740
Are we, okay.

7433
09:24:24,740 --> 09:24:25,740
We're just walking away.

7434
09:24:25,740 --> 09:24:30,740
The Eye of Sauron Tower.

7435
09:24:30,740 --> 09:24:31,740
Yeah.

7436
09:24:31,740 --> 09:24:33,740
I couldn't think.

7437
09:24:33,740 --> 09:24:35,740
I was like, where's that madness coming from?

7438
09:24:35,740 --> 09:24:39,740
Nothing's attacking me.

7439
09:24:39,740 --> 09:24:41,740
I am apparently getting life or something.

7440
09:24:41,740 --> 09:24:47,740
I don't know.

7441
09:24:47,740 --> 09:24:48,740
Reflexes.

7442
09:24:48,740 --> 09:24:51,740
Oh, I like that.

7443
09:24:51,740 --> 09:24:54,740
I need to look up all the words that go R-E.

7444
09:24:54,740 --> 09:24:59,740
And then, like, insert fling into it, basically.

7445
09:24:59,740 --> 09:25:02,740
Oh, me goes.

7446
09:25:02,740 --> 09:25:07,740
Well, I think there may be a painting in a shack here.

7447
09:25:07,740 --> 09:25:10,740
Maybe.

7448
09:25:10,740 --> 09:25:13,740
I could be a terrible mistaken.

7449
09:25:13,740 --> 09:25:17,740
I can't remember.

7450
09:25:17,740 --> 09:25:19,740
It may be some other thing.

7451
09:25:19,740 --> 09:25:21,740
Oh, this is the Madness Village.

7452
09:25:21,740 --> 09:25:28,740
I don't know.

7453
09:25:28,740 --> 09:25:30,740
And it's nothing fun.

7454
09:25:30,740 --> 09:25:32,740
I hate this section so much.

7455
09:25:32,740 --> 09:25:36,740
I mean, we don't have to hurt the eye.

7456
09:25:36,740 --> 09:25:41,740
We don't have to hurt the eye of Sauron, so we should be okay.

7457
09:25:41,740 --> 09:25:43,740
Where's the other replay?

7458
09:25:43,740 --> 09:25:48,740
Is he ahead?

7459
09:25:48,740 --> 09:25:51,740
Have we lost the other replay?

7460
09:25:51,740 --> 09:25:55,740
I don't see him.

7461
09:25:55,740 --> 09:25:57,740
I'm trying to wrangle my children.

7462
09:25:57,740 --> 09:26:00,740
Don't he put collars and leashes on you?

7463
09:26:00,740 --> 09:26:03,740
Where are you?

7464
09:26:03,740 --> 09:26:05,740
Are you lost?

7465
09:26:05,740 --> 09:26:10,740
Am I going crazy and he's there?

7466
09:26:10,740 --> 09:26:12,740
I'll give you just spread waiting.

7467
09:26:12,740 --> 09:26:13,740
Hold on.

7468
09:26:13,740 --> 09:26:15,740
I'll wait right here.

7469
09:26:15,740 --> 09:26:20,740
I don't know where the heck he is.

7470
09:26:20,740 --> 09:26:21,740
Oh, he's down there.

7471
09:26:21,740 --> 09:26:22,740
Oh, you made it.

7472
09:26:22,740 --> 09:26:23,740
Okay.

7473
09:26:23,740 --> 09:26:24,740
We found you.

7474
09:26:24,740 --> 09:26:25,740
What are you?

7475
09:26:25,740 --> 09:26:26,740
What even is that?

7476
09:26:26,740 --> 09:26:30,740
Is that that dragon spear that does that thing on the snake?

7477
09:26:30,740 --> 09:26:33,740
What is your fit?

7478
09:26:33,740 --> 09:26:37,740
How do you get giffy or looking every time we see you?

7479
09:26:37,740 --> 09:26:39,740
Oh, my goodness.

7480
09:26:39,740 --> 09:26:42,740
You look like an elf.

7481
09:26:42,740 --> 09:26:45,740
Okay, let's keep going.

7482
09:26:45,740 --> 09:26:50,740
Let's keep going.

7483
09:26:50,740 --> 09:26:52,740
Oh, you got more clothes.

7484
09:26:52,740 --> 09:26:57,740
How do you swap a pearl so quickly?

7485
09:26:57,740 --> 09:26:58,740
How do you know?

7486
09:26:58,740 --> 09:26:59,740
Maybe you've got it.

7487
09:26:59,740 --> 09:27:01,740
Or maybe you're just MLG at this game.

7488
09:27:01,740 --> 09:27:04,740
MLG inventory.

7489
09:27:04,740 --> 09:27:06,740
Church of inhibition.

7490
09:27:06,740 --> 09:27:10,740
We'll definitely go do none of that around here.

7491
09:27:10,740 --> 09:27:11,740
Touch.

7492
09:27:11,740 --> 09:27:12,740
Great.

7493
09:27:12,740 --> 09:27:13,740
Thank you.

7494
09:27:13,740 --> 09:27:14,740
Oh, no.

7495
09:27:14,740 --> 09:27:16,740
What's in the lady's arm?

7496
09:27:16,740 --> 09:27:17,740
She didn't make it.

7497
09:27:17,740 --> 09:27:18,740
Are you alive?

7498
09:27:18,740 --> 09:27:19,740
Thank you.

7499
09:27:19,740 --> 09:27:20,740
Oh.

7500
09:27:20,740 --> 09:27:22,740
Oh, it's my wedding cloak.

7501
09:27:22,740 --> 09:27:25,740
I think I used to marry Rihanna.

7502
09:27:25,740 --> 09:27:27,740
No, Rihanna.

7503
09:27:27,740 --> 09:27:32,740
I know it's another maiden, but the maidens are good, but we don't know this one.

7504
09:27:32,740 --> 09:27:36,740
Okay, let's go next.

7505
09:27:36,740 --> 09:27:41,740
The invader needs to leave real quick.

7506
09:27:41,740 --> 09:27:42,740
The Church of Innovations.

7507
09:27:42,740 --> 09:27:44,740
I thought we were going to do another prayer again.

7508
09:27:44,740 --> 09:27:49,740
Wait, is this a fight?

7509
09:27:49,740 --> 09:27:51,740
The Minish Cap NPV, honestly.

7510
09:27:51,740 --> 09:27:52,740
Oh, no.

7511
09:27:52,740 --> 09:27:56,740
I need to fight on my own.

7512
09:27:56,740 --> 09:27:59,740
I'm so brave.

7513
09:27:59,740 --> 09:28:00,740
I'm so brave.

7514
09:28:00,740 --> 09:28:01,740
I can do it.

7515
09:28:01,740 --> 09:28:02,740
I can do it.

7516
09:28:02,740 --> 09:28:05,740
I'm so brave.

7517
09:28:06,740 --> 09:28:12,740
I'm going to sit right here.

7518
09:28:12,740 --> 09:28:14,740
You should summon in now.

7519
09:28:14,740 --> 09:28:17,740
Even with reeflings with me?

7520
09:28:17,740 --> 09:28:21,740
Can reeflings do the honors on spit-roof- reeflings?

7521
09:28:21,740 --> 09:28:25,740
Spit-roost this man.

7522
09:28:25,740 --> 09:28:26,740
Reeflings?

7523
09:28:26,740 --> 09:28:32,740
Get out and spit-roost this man, won't you?

7524
09:28:32,740 --> 09:28:33,740
Where?

7525
09:28:33,740 --> 09:28:34,740
Here.

7526
09:28:34,740 --> 09:28:37,740
Did I walk back up to the church again?

7527
09:28:37,740 --> 09:28:38,740
Okay, yeah.

7528
09:28:38,740 --> 09:28:39,740
Here he is.

7529
09:28:39,740 --> 09:28:42,740
Reeflings destroy this man.

7530
09:28:42,740 --> 09:28:47,740
Unless I do it for you.

7531
09:28:47,740 --> 09:28:51,740
Yeah, yeah, nice fight.

7532
09:28:51,740 --> 09:28:53,740
Okay, that was perfect.

7533
09:28:53,740 --> 09:28:57,740
Couldn't have asked for a better thingy.

7534
09:28:57,740 --> 09:28:59,740
I've got a fingerprint.

7535
09:28:59,740 --> 09:29:00,740
Great.

7536
09:29:00,740 --> 09:29:02,740
Did you win for her?

7537
09:29:02,740 --> 09:29:06,740
All right, how do I get an evil reefling in again?

7538
09:29:06,740 --> 09:29:08,740
Is evil reefling at the church?

7539
09:29:08,740 --> 09:29:10,740
Wait, spit-roost that man, maybe.

7540
09:29:10,740 --> 09:29:14,740
Oh, sorry, spit-roost that woman.

7541
09:29:14,740 --> 09:29:16,740
Okay, let's see.

7542
09:29:16,740 --> 09:29:19,740
Sorry, but we chairs go again.

7543
09:29:19,740 --> 09:29:21,740
Whoa, you scared me doing that.

7544
09:29:21,740 --> 09:29:25,740
I thought we were reinvading that woman.

7545
09:29:25,740 --> 09:29:27,740
Do I need a tingling?

7546
09:29:27,740 --> 09:29:29,740
No, I don't need a tingling.

7547
09:29:30,740 --> 09:29:35,740
No enemy reefling?

7548
09:29:35,740 --> 09:29:37,740
Oh, where are we?

7549
09:29:37,740 --> 09:29:39,740
I don't even know where we are.

7550
09:29:39,740 --> 09:29:41,740
We're in the church of inhibition.

7551
09:29:41,740 --> 09:29:45,740
If an enemy reefling wants to be naughty, naughty.

7552
09:29:45,740 --> 09:29:46,740
Are you burying?

7553
09:29:46,740 --> 09:29:47,740
Or do you have to go?

7554
09:29:47,740 --> 09:29:49,740
Or are you just burying in general?

7555
09:29:49,740 --> 09:29:51,740
I have-hello?

7556
09:29:51,740 --> 09:29:52,740
Hey!

7557
09:29:52,740 --> 09:29:53,740
Hi!

7558
09:29:53,740 --> 09:29:58,740
I have-I have yippee!

7559
09:29:59,740 --> 09:30:04,740
That is a-did you even get any lift with that?

7560
09:30:04,740 --> 09:30:07,740
Yeah, I really did not get that high up their lap.

7561
09:30:07,740 --> 09:30:09,740
Oh, enemy reefling.

7562
09:30:09,740 --> 09:30:11,740
Okay, we're safe to get again.

7563
09:30:11,740 --> 09:30:15,740
We need not to worry for we are safe.

7564
09:30:15,740 --> 09:30:19,740
That had big colon ambulance, but not for me.

7565
09:30:19,740 --> 09:30:20,740
Okay.

7566
09:30:28,740 --> 09:30:30,740
Wait, you didn't come in?

7567
09:30:32,740 --> 09:30:33,740
Oh!

7568
09:30:33,740 --> 09:30:35,740
I'm unable to summon you.

7569
09:30:37,740 --> 09:30:38,740
Whoa!

7570
09:30:38,740 --> 09:30:39,740
Whoa!

7571
09:30:39,740 --> 09:30:41,740
Am I being-am I losing it?

7572
09:30:41,740 --> 09:30:43,740
This schizophrenia is kicking in.

7573
09:30:43,740 --> 09:30:46,740
It's not looking good.

7574
09:30:46,740 --> 09:30:48,740
Are we being invaded?

7575
09:30:48,740 --> 09:30:49,740
I think they both disappear.

7576
09:30:49,740 --> 09:30:50,740
It gave me an error.

7577
09:30:50,740 --> 09:30:52,740
I think you're invaded.

7578
09:30:52,740 --> 09:30:53,740
No, reeflings.

7579
09:30:53,740 --> 09:30:54,740
I need to kill her.

7580
09:30:54,740 --> 09:30:58,740
I need to pretend to be a piece of furniture.

7581
09:31:00,740 --> 09:31:02,740
I think I am being invaded.

7582
09:31:02,740 --> 09:31:04,740
I can't see anyone's thing.

7583
09:31:04,740 --> 09:31:06,740
Ah, same.

7584
09:31:06,740 --> 09:31:07,740
So...

7585
09:31:07,740 --> 09:31:08,740
Oh!

7586
09:31:08,740 --> 09:31:09,740
Oh!

7587
09:31:09,740 --> 09:31:10,740
I heard it!

7588
09:31:10,740 --> 09:31:11,740
I heard it!

7589
09:31:11,740 --> 09:31:12,740
I heard it!

7590
09:31:12,740 --> 09:31:13,740
I heard it!

7591
09:31:13,740 --> 09:31:14,740
Sorry, someone's getting-getting right now.

7592
09:31:14,740 --> 09:31:15,740
I do not want to be fricking dumb.

7593
09:31:15,740 --> 09:31:17,740
Wait, turn into furniture.

7594
09:31:17,740 --> 09:31:18,740
Chair.

7595
09:31:18,740 --> 09:31:19,740
Table.

7596
09:31:19,740 --> 09:31:22,740
Elden Ring knew my funny prank and said no.

7597
09:31:22,740 --> 09:31:25,740
Oh no, are you doing a prank?

7598
09:31:25,740 --> 09:31:26,740
Okay.

7599
09:31:26,740 --> 09:31:27,740
I'm going to test-

7600
09:31:27,740 --> 09:31:30,740
I'm going to test the tea.

7601
09:31:30,740 --> 09:31:31,740
Okay.

7602
09:31:32,740 --> 09:31:33,740
Are you doing this?

7603
09:31:33,740 --> 09:31:34,740
No.

7604
09:31:35,740 --> 09:31:37,740
Okay, I'm having some water first though.

7605
09:31:37,740 --> 09:31:38,740
Hydration check, please.

7606
09:31:38,740 --> 09:31:39,740
A reefling.

7607
09:31:45,740 --> 09:31:47,740
Wait, did I have that?

7608
09:31:49,740 --> 09:31:51,740
Did I even have that?

7609
09:31:52,740 --> 09:31:54,740
Or did I not pick it up?

7610
09:31:54,740 --> 09:31:56,740
I don't really know what it is.

7611
09:31:56,740 --> 09:31:57,740
This?

7612
09:32:00,740 --> 09:32:02,740
No, I didn't pick it up.

7613
09:32:04,740 --> 09:32:06,740
Oh, it's for you.

7614
09:32:06,740 --> 09:32:08,740
Good night, rest well, both of you.

7615
09:32:09,740 --> 09:32:10,740
Oh, I've not blessed you.

7616
09:32:10,740 --> 09:32:11,740
Okay, hold on.

7617
09:32:11,740 --> 09:32:12,740
Let me bless you.

7618
09:32:15,740 --> 09:32:18,740
Do you want to come over as well to be blessed?

7619
09:32:18,740 --> 09:32:20,740
I can't even roll out the statue.

7620
09:32:20,740 --> 09:32:22,740
Now I'm getting mad to do-

7621
09:32:22,740 --> 09:32:25,740
I was going to say, did you want me to do it on the crystals?

7622
09:32:25,740 --> 09:32:29,740
I think that might be out of my expertise range.

7623
09:32:32,740 --> 09:32:33,740
Perfect.

7624
09:32:34,740 --> 09:32:35,740
Perfect.

7625
09:32:35,740 --> 09:32:36,740
Where are we heading to next?

7626
09:32:36,740 --> 09:32:38,740
Do you know where you're taking me?

7627
09:32:40,740 --> 09:32:41,740
Does anyone know?

7628
09:32:41,740 --> 09:32:43,740
Oh, I just straight up killed this one.

7629
09:32:43,740 --> 09:32:45,740
Sorry, reefling.

7630
09:32:45,740 --> 09:32:47,740
It wasn't supposed to be like that.

7631
09:32:47,740 --> 09:32:50,740
But he went out doing what he wanted.

7632
09:32:50,740 --> 09:32:51,740
That'd be pretty painful.

7633
09:32:51,740 --> 09:32:52,740
Oh, yeah.

7634
09:32:52,740 --> 09:32:55,740
Did you not see the fake taxi?

7635
09:32:55,740 --> 09:32:59,740
I would take the guy, like, tried to jump on the car

7636
09:32:59,740 --> 09:33:02,740
and slide in,

7637
09:33:02,740 --> 09:33:04,740
but he, like, completely messed up

7638
09:33:04,740 --> 09:33:07,740
and, like, really hurt himself.

7639
09:33:09,740 --> 09:33:10,740
Crystals might be stretching it,

7640
09:33:10,740 --> 09:33:12,740
literally, and figuratively.

7641
09:33:12,740 --> 09:33:14,740
Just no one know where we're going.

7642
09:33:14,740 --> 09:33:15,740
Oh, hold on.

7643
09:33:15,740 --> 09:33:16,740
Let me open up the map.

7644
09:33:16,740 --> 09:33:19,740
Oh, I can't because the game thinks I'm fighting.

7645
09:33:19,740 --> 09:33:22,740
I'm not fighting reefling.

7646
09:33:22,740 --> 09:33:25,740
I can't even open up the map to see where we're going.

7647
09:33:29,740 --> 09:33:30,740
I'll let you go.

7648
09:33:30,740 --> 09:33:34,740
I don't think there is anywhere to go here.

7649
09:33:34,740 --> 09:33:36,740
You've got to move.

7650
09:33:37,740 --> 09:33:39,740
Hmm.

7651
09:33:39,740 --> 09:33:42,740
Is that everything I can pick up?

7652
09:33:43,740 --> 09:33:45,740
I've sold in, I guess.

7653
09:33:45,740 --> 09:33:47,740
We're going back to the DLC.

7654
09:33:47,740 --> 09:33:48,740
No.

7655
09:33:48,740 --> 09:33:50,740
I don't think I saw that one.

7656
09:33:50,740 --> 09:33:51,740
Oh.

7657
09:33:53,740 --> 09:33:54,740
Oh, no.

7658
09:33:54,740 --> 09:33:56,740
You didn't have to go, though.

7659
09:33:57,740 --> 09:33:59,740
Is that everything?

7660
09:34:00,740 --> 09:34:05,740
Um, we would have to do a campaign to get up on top.

7661
09:34:06,740 --> 09:34:08,740
I think.

7662
09:34:08,740 --> 09:34:11,740
And we did all of that down there.

7663
09:34:11,740 --> 09:34:13,740
Caleb has one or two.

7664
09:34:13,740 --> 09:34:14,740
Did we do Caleb?

7665
09:34:14,740 --> 09:34:17,740
Not the top part of Caleb, we haven't.

7666
09:34:17,740 --> 09:34:19,740
Do I have all four talisman slots?

7667
09:34:19,740 --> 09:34:21,740
No, I only have the two.

7668
09:34:21,740 --> 09:34:25,740
The crotch bone is the strongest bone on the body for a reason.

7669
09:34:25,740 --> 09:34:27,740
And that reason is strong, eh?

7670
09:34:27,740 --> 09:34:28,740
Stop.

7671
09:34:28,740 --> 09:34:29,740
That's so good.

7672
09:34:29,740 --> 09:34:31,740
I thought you were actually going to educate us there.

7673
09:34:31,740 --> 09:34:32,740
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

7674
09:34:32,740 --> 09:34:34,740
What is it?

7675
09:34:34,740 --> 09:34:35,740
I don't.

7676
09:34:35,740 --> 09:34:37,740
I only have two talisman.

7677
09:34:37,740 --> 09:34:40,740
I can't recall how to unlock more.

7678
09:34:40,740 --> 09:34:42,740
Go to the church where you find the physics.

7679
09:34:42,740 --> 09:34:44,740
There's a teleporter behind it.

7680
09:34:44,740 --> 09:34:50,740
Um, yeah, I know exactly what church you're talking about.

7681
09:34:55,740 --> 09:34:57,740
It takes you to the top of the Caleb.

7682
09:35:00,740 --> 09:35:01,740
Wait, that remains.

7683
09:35:01,740 --> 09:35:04,740
I don't know if I should go and then.

7684
09:35:04,740 --> 09:35:08,740
Talk to the finger lady at the round table and she gives you one.

7685
09:35:08,740 --> 09:35:09,740
Okay.

7686
09:35:09,740 --> 09:35:13,740
We go talk to the lady at the round table.

7687
09:35:13,740 --> 09:35:17,740
Am I listening to that instruction?

7688
09:35:17,740 --> 09:35:21,740
How does it feel being able to instruct me to do stuff?

7689
09:35:21,740 --> 09:35:22,740
Does it?

7690
09:35:22,740 --> 09:35:23,740
Oh, hello.

7691
09:35:23,740 --> 09:35:25,740
I don't believe we've met.

7692
09:35:25,740 --> 09:35:26,740
We haven't.

7693
09:35:26,740 --> 09:35:27,740
I don't know you.

7694
09:35:28,740 --> 09:35:31,740
I'm taking a sipping tin of pee.

7695
09:35:52,740 --> 09:35:53,740
What are you on about?

7696
09:35:53,740 --> 09:35:54,740
Honestly.

7697
09:35:54,740 --> 09:35:55,740
Oh, it's you.

7698
09:35:55,740 --> 09:35:56,740
Hello.

7699
09:35:56,740 --> 09:35:57,740
Oh, she levels up.

7700
09:35:57,740 --> 09:35:58,740
Spirations.

7701
09:35:58,740 --> 09:35:59,740
I recognize.

7702
09:35:59,740 --> 09:36:01,740
My name is Roderica.

7703
09:36:01,740 --> 09:36:04,740
I should have told you sooner.

7704
09:36:04,740 --> 09:36:06,740
Isn't this place impressive?

7705
09:36:06,740 --> 09:36:09,740
Where the domes for all the little in control.

7706
09:36:09,740 --> 09:36:12,740
Covert quarters of the two fingers.

7707
09:36:12,740 --> 09:36:13,740
Whip.

7708
09:36:13,740 --> 09:36:19,740
Did you know that women actually have 206 bones in their bodies?

7709
09:36:19,740 --> 09:36:21,740
Would they like another one?

7710
09:36:21,740 --> 09:36:25,740
Oh, wait.

7711
09:36:25,740 --> 09:36:27,740
Oh, what?

7712
09:36:27,740 --> 09:36:29,740
Snow flakes.

7713
09:36:29,740 --> 09:36:30,740
Relax.

7714
09:36:30,740 --> 09:36:31,740
Snow flakes.

7715
09:36:31,740 --> 09:36:33,740
It's called a joke.

7716
09:36:33,740 --> 09:36:34,740
Right.

7717
09:36:34,740 --> 09:36:35,740
What am I to do?

7718
09:36:35,740 --> 09:36:39,740
I'm still looking for my own purpose.

7719
09:36:39,740 --> 09:36:40,740
Okay.

7720
09:36:40,740 --> 09:36:43,740
What am I doing here?

7721
09:36:43,740 --> 09:36:45,740
I'm talking to the furled fingers.

7722
09:36:45,740 --> 09:36:47,740
I'm going to get your fingers.

7723
09:36:47,740 --> 09:36:48,740
Your fingers.

7724
09:36:48,740 --> 09:36:50,740
I just remembered that right now.

7725
09:36:50,740 --> 09:36:51,740
Wait.

7726
09:36:51,740 --> 09:36:52,740
No.

7727
09:36:52,740 --> 09:36:54,740
Wrong area.

7728
09:36:55,740 --> 09:36:57,740
Furled fingers up here.

7729
09:36:57,740 --> 09:36:59,740
The two fingers.

7730
09:36:59,740 --> 09:37:00,740
Hiya.

7731
09:37:00,740 --> 09:37:01,740
America.

7732
09:37:01,740 --> 09:37:02,740
Hiya.

7733
09:37:02,740 --> 09:37:05,740
Oh, you don't want to interact with my thing.

7734
09:37:05,740 --> 09:37:07,740
I had my doubts.

7735
09:37:07,740 --> 09:37:10,740
But my look at you.

7736
09:37:10,740 --> 09:37:12,740
Can you even see me?

7737
09:37:12,740 --> 09:37:18,740
I've only once before have I seen two great runes together.

7738
09:37:18,740 --> 09:37:20,740
Look there.

7739
09:37:20,740 --> 09:37:24,740
The fingers shudder with exuberance.

7740
09:37:24,740 --> 09:37:28,740
Fine work, brave tarnished.

7741
09:37:28,740 --> 09:37:31,740
The greater will is pleased.

7742
09:37:31,740 --> 09:37:35,740
You have earned the right to become Elden Lord.

7743
09:37:35,740 --> 09:37:36,740
Oh.

7744
09:37:36,740 --> 09:37:42,740
Now, seek the Earth Tree and an audience with Queen Marica

7745
09:37:42,740 --> 09:37:48,740
to become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.

7746
09:37:48,740 --> 09:37:50,740
We can do that.

7747
09:37:58,740 --> 09:37:59,740
Farewell.

7748
09:37:59,740 --> 09:38:00,740
Farewell.

7749
09:38:00,740 --> 09:38:01,740
Why?

7750
09:38:01,740 --> 09:38:04,740
Oh, thank you, darling.

7751
09:38:04,740 --> 09:38:06,740
Go forth.

7752
09:38:06,740 --> 09:38:07,740
Become Elden Lord.

7753
09:38:07,740 --> 09:38:09,740
I like Elden Ring the Bushkush.

7754
09:38:09,740 --> 09:38:11,740
She's very nice.

7755
09:38:11,740 --> 09:38:15,740
Thank you, Elden Ring the Bushkush.

7756
09:38:15,740 --> 09:38:17,740
Hmm.

7757
09:38:17,740 --> 09:38:20,740
Raise this equipment loads.

7758
09:38:20,740 --> 09:38:23,740
Raise this holy tack but Lord's Damage Mediation.

7759
09:38:23,740 --> 09:38:26,740
Raise this attack power after a critical hit.

7760
09:38:26,740 --> 09:38:28,740
I mean, where are you?

7761
09:38:28,740 --> 09:38:32,740
Constantly attract enemy aggression.

7762
09:38:32,740 --> 09:38:37,740
Why would you want that?

7763
09:38:38,740 --> 09:38:45,740
Or should I put that on so you guys can just go crazy on any boss?

7764
09:38:45,740 --> 09:38:48,740
Do you guys use that?

7765
09:38:48,740 --> 09:38:50,740
Is that why he's so...

7766
09:38:50,740 --> 09:38:55,740
Whenever we do a boss, it's like such a swampy boss.

7767
09:38:59,740 --> 09:39:01,740
With the power of remembrance menu,

7768
09:39:01,740 --> 09:39:03,740
you can draw out the power of remembrance magic.

7769
09:39:04,740 --> 09:39:07,740
Once that power is claimed, it will be lost.

7770
09:39:15,740 --> 09:39:17,740
I'll just leave it.

7771
09:39:17,740 --> 09:39:18,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

7772
09:39:18,740 --> 09:39:19,740
Teehee.

7773
09:39:19,740 --> 09:39:20,740
Teehee, sorry.

7774
09:39:20,740 --> 09:39:22,740
The reflings make all the decisions for me.

7775
09:39:22,740 --> 09:39:24,740
Teehee, thank you for the Talisman pouch.

7776
09:39:24,740 --> 09:39:26,740
So, yeah!

7777
09:39:26,740 --> 09:39:28,740

Uh, right.

7780
09:39:36,740 --> 09:39:38,740
Are you ok mate? Jees.

7781
09:39:38,740 --> 09:39:40,740

7843
09:47:28,900 --> 09:47:34,580
we're not to be confused with the hit anime monster misumi

7844
09:47:37,700 --> 09:47:40,660
that was the most ridiculous anime was gonna happen

7845
09:47:43,140 --> 09:47:47,780

pappy best girl oh the freaking episode that pappy lays an egg in is so frustrating

7861
09:49:38,180 --> 09:49:45,380
it was like so some guys like trying to exploit her for like being different type thing

7862
09:49:46,180 --> 09:49:52,420
and like the protagonist wouldn't just kick him out I'm like brav I remember being so freaking

7863
09:49:52,420 --> 09:49:56,740
frustrated being like just kick him out like I know it's an anime plot and there has to be like some

7864
09:49:57,300 --> 09:50:05,140
give or give or pull give or pull or whatever in the plot I just remember I'm on a PC you can

but yeah not monster misumi's was kind of like a goofy

7880
09:51:53,460 --> 09:52:00,980
although I could have sworn about the dvd collection and there's like a hidden scene with

7881
09:52:00,980 --> 09:52:07,220
pappy at the doctor or something and I remember being pretty shocked but it was because I had

7882
09:52:07,220 --> 09:52:12,660
never seen like that kind of stuff before I don't know anything

7883
09:52:17,140 --> 09:52:19,460
I can't remember if he showed her chest or not

7884
09:52:22,020 --> 09:52:27,940
are we missing raid reefing right he's coming he's just he needs a moment to catch up his

7885
09:52:27,940 --> 09:52:32,740

wait so it's not the anim an anime but uh I I think it's called itchy if it like

7888
09:52:44,740 --> 09:52:49,060

7889
09:52:49,300 --> 09:52:53,300

7892
09:53:14,100 --> 09:53:18,580
who said fight a dragon on a bridge I have to admit this feels very one-sided

7893
09:53:19,860 --> 09:53:24,420
I can't even get to the enemy and tame

7894
09:53:31,220 --> 09:53:35,860

7915
09:56:12,660 --> 09:56:18,500
wow why is magic so strong that magic felt like it was good is there anything that's even

7916
09:56:18,500 --> 09:56:27,060
resistant to magic at all? I still move around every day you were so brave in the fight you

7917
09:56:27,060 --> 09:56:33,860
don't need to move for it all okay let's go grab some refling now that we've done that

7918
09:56:34,900 --> 09:56:41,460
we don't need to worry about any d spawn you have 19 strength how come how does it come that you

7919
09:56:41,460 --> 09:56:53,300
don't do any damage I think my weapon's like next to useless is my guess I think I don't I'm

7920
09:56:53,300 --> 09:56:59,380
I'm I'm slightly unsure yeah after I've made a movie I'm sure yeah okay here we go

7921
09:57:02,900 --> 09:57:03,860
wait you can come in

7922
09:57:04,420 --> 09:57:11,220
I think it may be bedtime soon for us you know that we can or do you want me to go for the

7923
09:57:11,220 --> 09:57:19,140
10 the full 12 hours or 11 hours and 55 minutes since the vault literally explodes at that mark

7924
09:57:19,300 --> 09:57:23,300
10

7925
09:57:29,380 --> 09:57:36,340
range we have something to prove we do up to you I'm here for the rage

7926
09:57:36,340 --> 09:57:43,940
exhausted I'm listening in the same voice all day I think if you want to sleep you can't sleep

7927
09:57:44,820 --> 09:57:50,820
hmm I think I'm gonna have to change my sleeping time it's the only problem

7928
09:57:56,260 --> 09:58:03,940
what I'm needing to do is basically sleep as soon as I finish stream and then that means I'm awake

7929
09:58:03,940 --> 09:58:10,020
and I can record like ASMR and edit a couple of hours before I stream I think I'm gonna have to

7930
09:58:10,020 --> 09:58:19,780
do it like that because um because the current way I'm doing it is I wake up before stream but

7931
09:58:19,780 --> 09:58:24,820
I'm so tired after stream so I think I just need to do all my work before stream that's the best thing

7932
09:58:24,820 --> 09:58:31,940
you lying down got a second layer down here you are yawning maybe sleeping might be on my

7933
09:58:32,020 --> 09:58:39,140
person a tune hope make sure you're full mass because if you're semi I'm gonna do something

7934
09:58:39,140 --> 09:58:53,620
that's really gonna hurt we should all go get that whimper coconut

7935
09:58:54,020 --> 09:59:03,380
he was semi oh that's why he took some damage yeah did you know your pinches can actually

7936
09:59:03,380 --> 09:59:14,740
break that's just terrible I suppose yeah I don't even know how you fix that can you even put it

7937
09:59:14,740 --> 09:59:23,300
in a cast I don't think so no impress me then literally it's so funny that we cooked enough

7938
09:59:29,300 --> 09:59:35,620
why wait sorry I always forget to to have my weapon oh was that full mass

7939
09:59:36,420 --> 09:59:48,820
I'm even dead in it oh oh you sound like those those vain birdie

7940
09:59:49,220 --> 10:00:04,660
there's no bone it's just muscle potentially

7941
10:00:09,540 --> 10:00:16,820
I feel like you I don't even how do you manage that it's a muscle

7942
10:00:19,540 --> 10:00:26,580
can in theory could a reefing cling flap so hard he'd hurt himself

7943
10:00:29,300 --> 10:00:32,180
whoa whoa

7944
10:00:35,460 --> 10:00:37,620

10:00:46,100 --> 10:00:50,580
magic okay as I'm saying I was really interrupted

7947
10:00:52,180 --> 10:00:59,860
literally if we can keep like if we can keep the boss off of like the magic player I think that's

7948
10:00:59,940 --> 10:01:04,820
like the perfect job you have what I knew you can't whimper after you want to pay

7949
10:01:05,940 --> 10:01:19,300

7965
10:02:41,140 --> 10:02:43,700

7966
10:02:46,180 --> 10:02:51,300
okay I can't level up that's fine do I want anything new here

7967
10:02:52,740 --> 10:02:58,420
temporary boost or damage make attack more likely to break enemy's dance move

7968
10:02:59,300 --> 10:03:04,420
that honestly seems pretty good for my 200 build instead of the

7986
10:05:05,220 --> 10:05:12,340
meat of the DLC so I guess today was just a speed run of getting set up for it which I'm happy with

7987
10:05:12,420 --> 10:05:18,900
because I did want to do a fresh save I think tomorrow we actually do the DLC

7988
10:05:19,540 --> 10:05:24,500
but for now we're just going to try and level up and get ready I see a level up I'm already leveled

okay I see a church

8016
10:08:13,780 --> 10:08:19,620

8072
10:14:25,540 --> 10:14:31,380
the smithing guy

8073
10:14:35,140 --> 10:14:38,180
this game like hard air to play I mean

8074
10:14:40,580 --> 10:14:45,540
if you got refueling to carry you through the entirety of every single section of the game

8075
10:14:46,340 --> 10:14:47,220
it's all right

8076
10:14:49,220 --> 10:14:51,460
to EG and EG up here

8077
10:14:55,940 --> 10:14:58,980
this is a hostile jellyfish are they back let's play

8078
10:15:01,460 --> 10:15:04,340
is everything about the grace oh okay sorry my apologies

8079
10:15:06,020 --> 10:15:11,860

8080
10:15:11,860 --> 10:15:12,500

8081
10:15:15,060 --> 10:15:15,860

8082
10:15:17,940 --> 10:15:19,140

8083
10:15:19,140 --> 10:15:24,420
uh I'll have one good

8084
10:15:28,100 --> 10:15:29,060
wow look at the back

8085
10:15:37,060 --> 10:15:38,820

8086
10:15:38,820 --> 10:15:40,820
some

8087
10:15:47,620 --> 10:15:49,860
I think only one good refling or one bad refling

8088
10:15:52,980 --> 10:15:55,300
I think I tired everyone out with my dream

8089
10:15:56,740 --> 10:16:00,580
imagine if someone was threatening to me creep right now maybe get me people

8090
10:16:03,060 --> 10:16:07,780
oh it didn't work odd I think the servers might be freaking just an ankle bit

8091
10:16:09,140 --> 10:16:10,740
there's also different gimmicks that you can

8092
10:16:12,340 --> 10:16:15,540
speaking of things breaking I'm about to have a coughing fit if I don't hide

8093
10:16:30,500 --> 10:16:35,140
the movement is the camera it's the camera angle

8094
10:16:35,460 --> 10:16:38,900

8113
10:18:46,180 --> 10:18:53,300
I don't know how you guys are hanging literally I'm ready to pass out I already know I'm gonna

8114
10:18:53,300 --> 10:19:02,100
try and flip flip my sleeve so I sleep right after stream and then I can do work when I leave off

8115
10:19:12,820 --> 10:19:18,500
that night shift life helps and hurts me chat is the reflection of a streamer

8116
10:19:18,980 --> 10:19:24,020
that's my word that word I'm not allowed to say

8117
10:19:33,140 --> 10:19:37,380
oh that burn arc the reefing endurance finally passed

8118
10:19:38,420 --> 10:19:42,260
like I like being able to say that yeah I'm a cheeky endurance viewer

8119
10:19:42,420 --> 10:19:44,580
well it may I get fucking tired too

8120
10:19:47,220 --> 10:19:54,260
wow that's a lot of enemies up ahead does someone have like an eoe magic spell or fun

8121
10:19:55,940 --> 10:19:57,700
oh it's a chariot that's why

8122
10:19:59,620 --> 10:20:01,220
okay hold on why

8123
10:20:02,900 --> 10:20:03,780
oh let's forget that

8124
10:20:07,460 --> 10:20:08,260
not magic

8125
10:20:13,220 --> 10:20:16,660
oh you can't open it if the guys are still moving the carriage

8126
10:20:18,980 --> 10:20:22,820
interesting I think it would be funny if you could like rob them without them knowing

8127
10:20:23,700 --> 10:20:29,220
I feel like we're putting them out of their misery because we look at literally how they're

8128
10:20:29,780 --> 10:20:36,820
it goes through them sorry we're putting these guys out of their misery sometimes it's time to

8129
10:20:37,780 --> 10:20:38,260
move

8130
10:20:41,460 --> 10:20:48,500
so on and start working five words before you stream until you move to the phone when you

8131
10:20:48,500 --> 10:20:57,460
need to move around oh my gosh I mean it's going to be very weird when my dad comes over

8132
10:20:58,340 --> 10:21:03,300
because the streams are literally going to be like what I consider like a regular stream time

8133
10:21:04,260 --> 10:21:08,580
um are you good

8134
10:21:10,740 --> 10:21:17,700
just infinite horse you okay you give the horse a little kiss you make him feel better

8135
10:21:18,820 --> 10:21:22,660
shrodinger's horse he's neither dead or alive because he doesn't need to move

8136
10:21:24,900 --> 10:21:27,460
oh are you scared of the horse

8137
10:21:27,860 --> 10:21:37,620
he's just chillin yeah like it's going to be so weird being like a normal streamer like

8138
10:21:37,620 --> 10:21:42,660
two ever streams four ever streams what what am I supposed to do

8139
10:21:44,820 --> 10:21:49,940
so I need my background noise at work hopefully I make more tasks like on that one

8140
10:21:52,420 --> 10:21:54,740
and just like come out with like the most inappropriate thing

8141
10:21:55,460 --> 10:21:59,460
ever oh I'll completely miss that no one saw that

8142
10:22:02,260 --> 10:22:04,980
no one saw that I was so embarrassed for no reason

8143
10:22:09,380 --> 10:22:14,820
I'm gonna hear them horses doing mannequin challenge I remember that

8144
10:22:16,980 --> 10:22:21,220
ASMR streams during work you'll have more time to work on your ASMR collabs I suppose

8145
10:22:21,860 --> 10:22:30,020
yeah basically if I flip my sleep on purpose I can get so much stuff done before stream starts

8146
10:22:30,020 --> 10:22:35,700
and then also the fun part about that is I can start stream and be like I did this and this and

8147
10:22:35,700 --> 10:22:40,260
this and this and you've got this to look forward to whereas now it's like I've got all of this to do

8148
10:22:40,260 --> 10:22:46,740
after which is like causing a lot of yes not major issues like issues for me

8149
10:22:47,620 --> 10:22:57,460
because I'm supposed to do the ASMR audio like the audio upload today but I'm gonna be honest

8150
10:22:57,460 --> 10:23:04,260
I think it'll be tomorrow but I think reeflings are like super understanding if it's like a day late

8151
10:23:05,540 --> 10:23:12,580
all right well I think I think everyone like understand whereas if I flip my sleep now wow

8152
10:23:12,660 --> 10:23:23,060
if I flip stop if I flipped my sleep now I would be able to do it since I wake up and like guarantee

8153
10:23:23,060 --> 10:23:28,020
the fails like they're uploaded and I'll be like all the fail ups you know uploads at 9am my time

8154
10:23:28,020 --> 10:23:35,220
like it's there it's waiting to go I am getting tired but I can do it I can do it wait what about

8155
10:23:35,540 --> 10:23:42,020
what about the future in audio uh it's gonna be tomorrow I think instead of today is that okay

8156
10:23:43,860 --> 10:23:46,580
I'm not really like that I'm not allowed to do that

8157
10:23:50,980 --> 10:23:58,100
unacceptable unsubscribe unless you're reported honestly most inconsistent streamer streamer

8339
10:45:12,820 --> 10:45:15,300

8347
10:46:27,060 --> 10:46:32,020
there's no evidence or proof that I'm getting sleepy after almost 11 hours of streaming it's

8348
10:46:32,020 --> 10:46:38,820

8443
10:57:53,460 --> 10:57:57,940

8444
10:57:58,900 --> 10:58:04,500
uh because i i don't know about you guys i absolutely love doodle request streams i find

8447
10:58:17,860 --> 10:58:26,740
uh anyway i'm a simp for a little doodle stream oh i got lightning ram

8448
10:58:30,420 --> 10:58:32,100
did you beat a ram up with lightning

8449
10:58:47,380 --> 10:58:52,900
um

8450
10:58:56,100 --> 10:58:58,900
sorry my brain's shutting down only i'm gonna pretend otherwise

8451
10:59:00,500 --> 10:59:08,820
running diagnostic three issues found critical failure in the butthole critical failure in the brain

8452
10:59:08,820 --> 10:59:18,580
i'm enjoying being a bit free unless i have to admit wait where's my third critical failure

8453
10:59:19,620 --> 10:59:27,700
oh there's a yes hello oh you're oh i just oh look look look look apparently

8454
10:59:27,700 --> 10:59:29,700
i'm

8455
10:59:29,940 --> 10:59:38,020
for a reefling right now nightly a reefling well yours uh where are we heading to next

8456
10:59:40,180 --> 10:59:47,380
i might confess a little bit to the tiredness slowly coming into me i don't remember feeling

8457
10:59:47,380 --> 10:59:52,740
as tired on other stuff on this and just wait you've got a torch that means i follow you if you've

8458
10:59:52,740 --> 10:59:56,820
got a torch but you know where it goes you both know where it goes

8459
11:00:00,180 --> 11:00:04,260
where's the other reefing i'm missing a reef i found the other reefing

8460
11:00:06,500 --> 11:00:11,700
i think the last years are in the realm of the giants so you'd have to clear marg yet to get there

8461
11:00:11,700 --> 11:00:15,220
if only i had some mlg pro reeflings

8462
11:00:15,220 --> 11:00:20,420
uh if only

8463
11:00:26,260 --> 11:00:26,900
truly

8464
11:00:30,100 --> 11:00:37,620
okay so then once all my flaws are not our level dot we shall do the dlc

8465
11:00:39,700 --> 11:00:42,900
and we'll see if we can go back to that guy that's absolutely well within us

8466
11:00:43,620 --> 11:00:46,420
at least i can heal no that's probably the biggest thing

8467
11:00:50,580 --> 11:00:54,740
i was gonna be mean in clip i am insent out of my face but i didn't ask you

8468
11:00:56,580 --> 11:00:58,660
on me did i say that

8469
11:01:01,540 --> 11:01:09,540
was she in kaolin uh yes we did kaolin we're now moving on to the giants

8470
11:01:10,340 --> 11:01:11,380
realm maybe

8471
11:01:14,660 --> 11:01:17,460
true you seem a lot more set up now than i did a few years

8472
11:01:17,460 --> 11:01:24,900
yes so maybe we could quickly sneak into the dlc just to see what's ahead of us

8473
11:01:25,860 --> 11:01:31,060
i can't remember even what we got stuck on and we're just getting walloped in general

8474
11:01:31,620 --> 11:01:33,620
oh

8475
11:01:39,140 --> 11:01:40,420
i think i'll grab that on the way

8476
11:01:42,100 --> 11:01:43,620
oh he's so tired

8477
11:01:46,420 --> 11:01:53,300
we're claiming the mountain plain well we're in a fight apparently

8478
11:01:54,180 --> 11:01:56,900
oh what's this

8479
11:01:57,860 --> 11:02:03,300
who or what why are we fighting oh it's you and for the reefling

8480
11:02:04,260 --> 11:02:10,260
whoa no it's not oh we're not bothering you so don't bother us how about that

8481
11:02:16,260 --> 11:02:18,820
i wonder what the originals games were like

8482
11:02:21,140 --> 11:02:22,900
is it the same development team

8483
11:02:23,860 --> 11:02:30,340
i would be curious i don't know if any franchises ever lasted like that even have the same developers

8484
11:02:30,340 --> 11:02:35,860
like on multiple editions it's sorry multiple renditions or storylines of the game unless it's

8485
11:02:35,860 --> 11:02:44,180
like indie owned that's probably the only instance 11 hours did you know memory loss is one of the

8486
11:02:44,180 --> 11:02:50,420
signs of insomnia just saying not really into anything yeah i don't have insomnia okay there

8487
11:02:50,420 --> 11:02:56,340
we can't progress because we're looting into a new area but i can see uh site ahead of me

8488
11:02:59,540 --> 11:03:01,620
you're thinking why why must they go

8489
11:03:07,140 --> 11:03:10,260
something maybe hunting us then look at the longer sword

8490
11:03:11,620 --> 11:03:16,100
it's so pointy as well that's dangerous good it's jaggy too so as well

8491
11:03:20,660 --> 11:03:24,100
i see them just summoning you then some

8492
11:03:24,100 --> 11:03:26,100
summon them

8493
11:03:30,820 --> 11:03:34,740
let's discover this and maybe let's upgrade into another class

8494
11:03:36,260 --> 11:03:38,740
if someone wins some day i have no idea what you're talking about

8495
11:03:40,660 --> 11:03:44,180
no i don't have insomnia i just i have bad

8496
11:03:44,340 --> 11:03:47,300
rest asleep at the moment just a little hmm so many things

8497
11:03:49,380 --> 11:03:53,780
but it will come down to tm oh we can talk to millenials

8498
11:03:55,700 --> 11:04:02,100
my lady spoken echoes of queen marica linger here as well

8499
11:04:02,740 --> 11:04:09,940
shall i share them with you yes please and marica's own words hear me demigods

8500
11:04:10,900 --> 11:04:21,300
my children beloved make of themselves that which he desire be it a lord be it a god

8501
11:04:21,940 --> 11:04:31,540
but should he fail to become awed at all you will be forsaken amounting only to sacrifices

8502
11:04:32,340 --> 11:04:40,500
so basically if you don't become something big you're gonna be meat for the tarnished

8503
11:04:42,340 --> 11:04:47,700
um curious there's a difficult boss up ahead

8504
11:04:48,900 --> 11:04:59,060
oh yeah if only i had some backup but who have i not had them you weren't in last thing no

8505
11:05:01,780 --> 11:05:05,140
where's panini in last time you're getting called panini

8506
11:05:06,180 --> 11:05:12,340
hi i'm getting delirious but we're gonna do it we're gonna oh i'm not had you in a hot second

8507
11:05:12,340 --> 11:05:16,180
either oh no there was a new one here sugar i don't know if that was someone who's not

8508
11:05:16,180 --> 11:05:18,580
being in for a while but thank you for your patience

8509
11:05:22,260 --> 11:05:29,220
at east we are all getting incredibly delirious at this stage i think however we're leveling

8510
11:05:29,220 --> 11:05:36,420
up my flasks and stuff so we can actually do the dlc area because we may or may not have got

8511
11:05:36,420 --> 11:05:42,500
absolutely whacked uh oh hydration check actually so i don't break my voice

8512
11:05:43,380 --> 11:05:45,780
wow what i dropped my voice

8513
11:05:54,980 --> 11:05:59,060
don't overdo it i've literally got 50 minutes i got less than 50 minutes now

8514
11:06:00,420 --> 11:06:07,780
okay and first we do our righteous ceremony should it have i got a run up i do have a wee

8515
11:06:07,780 --> 11:06:14,020
bit of a run up just a little one though oh good

8516
11:06:16,420 --> 11:06:19,860
i wish i could turn that thing so cool it almost like the base and it's like

8517
11:06:23,780 --> 11:06:27,380
okay where are we heading follow the stuff like

8518
11:06:27,940 --> 11:06:29,460
like

8519
11:06:35,460 --> 11:06:39,460
time to take a new one oh oh i didn't realize there was enemies all over here

8520
11:06:40,740 --> 11:06:43,460
jeez there's so many lovely flowers though i love it

8521
11:06:43,460 --> 11:06:52,340
who's that

8522
11:06:56,580 --> 11:07:01,700
who are you and who do you think you're talking to by an attitude like that

8523
11:07:04,500 --> 11:07:07,620
honestly being scared of a tarnish are you

8524
11:07:07,940 --> 11:07:15,860
honestly then you then it even be disrespectful the guy from the braided

8525
11:07:17,460 --> 11:07:21,300
up here i want medallion

8526
11:07:25,300 --> 11:07:29,380
greatly raises maximum stamina but come on

8527
11:07:30,100 --> 11:07:36,500
game team one point look at our sacrifice

8528
11:07:39,700 --> 11:07:44,500
oh good good good no i'm not yawning it's it's actually just an audio

8529
11:07:45,140 --> 11:07:50,100
a sensory process and issues oh there's another thing oh there's two golden seats here

8530
11:07:51,140 --> 11:07:54,660
that's pretty cool uh we're heading over here

8531
11:08:00,020 --> 11:08:08,340
i'm following the flame they're truly yawning simulation yeah it's just like because of the

8532
11:08:08,340 --> 11:08:14,100
whole hypnosis thing it probably sounds like yawning but i'm actually just straight up rewiring

8533
11:08:14,100 --> 11:08:20,020
your brain to do my bidding at any point in time um and i'm actually getting so good

8534
11:08:21,060 --> 11:08:27,300
that you can't even tell when i'm tapping into your cerebral cortex like i'm already in there

8535
11:08:27,860 --> 11:08:31,460
the reason why i'm telling you this right now is because you're not even going to remember

8536
11:08:31,460 --> 11:08:38,900
me telling you so any emotions that you feel of shock of despair there's no point because you're

8537
11:08:38,900 --> 11:08:46,100
you're not going to remember or feel it again in about 15 minutes time it's a relaxed battle cry

8538
11:08:46,100 --> 11:08:53,220
that's actually really creative is that why i'm watching you all day every day recently

8539
11:08:53,220 --> 11:08:57,060
i'm already in we're even done the hypnosis for you well i've done a little

8540
11:08:58,100 --> 11:09:04,500
someone really complimented my like asmr hypnosis i did by accident when i wasn't like yawning on it

8541
11:09:04,500 --> 11:09:11,300
whoa two golden seats i guess the game's like yeah you gonna need this touch three

8542
11:09:16,900 --> 11:09:21,780
stony keeps saying she hasn't done any hypnosis yet but that's all we remember truth is

8543
11:09:21,780 --> 11:09:26,740
we were hypnotized before debut are you clicking your fingers for hypnosis

8544
11:09:28,820 --> 11:09:33,700
okay we're a little bit against the clock so i'm gonna have to be good and get going

8545
11:09:35,140 --> 11:09:40,180
i get going and be good i think this is around the point when you need like six

8546
11:09:40,260 --> 11:09:41,620
beats for a plaster song

8547
11:09:48,500 --> 11:09:54,020
i don't know what she's on my head why do you think you're so selfless towards me huh

8548
11:09:55,220 --> 11:09:58,580
how are we playing why do you think you're so selfless to carry me through the game

8549
11:09:59,380 --> 11:10:03,460
carry me through of the stuff i want to explore the other reason

8550
11:10:06,900 --> 11:10:07,700
it's like we got in

8551
11:10:10,660 --> 11:10:11,160
a

8552
11:10:19,460 --> 11:10:20,980
i just did three really good

8553
11:10:22,820 --> 11:10:24,020
what is going on

8554
11:10:26,420 --> 11:10:34,900
i braped for one second and oh sorry sorry what is you i don't remember going against this

8555
11:10:34,980 --> 11:10:37,220
did you guys carry me through him last time

8556
11:10:41,140 --> 11:10:42,100
oh my goodness

8557
11:10:44,740 --> 11:10:46,500
i do not remember going against that

8558
11:10:48,740 --> 11:10:50,900
and a golden seat from him too

8559
11:10:51,940 --> 11:10:54,420
to hike this entire area is a gold mine

8560
11:10:56,500 --> 11:10:58,820
a golden seat mine

8561
11:11:00,500 --> 11:11:04,500
there's a pun there somewhere but it's not gonna work in zen structure of english

8562
11:11:05,620 --> 11:11:08,180
we didn't kill any of these yeah i don't even remember him

8563
11:11:11,460 --> 11:11:12,660
can't wait for more hypnosis

8564
11:11:14,340 --> 11:11:20,500
i think on the writing stream we're gonna get a lot of work done on the writing stream

8565
11:11:20,500 --> 11:11:24,980
but like good work not like boring work like the work you want to hear

8566
11:11:26,180 --> 11:11:30,820
hopefully it's not boring if it is obviously i don't have to do a stream like that again

8567
11:11:30,820 --> 11:11:32,980
i don't want to like bore you

8568
11:11:38,340 --> 11:11:42,340
you don't need every golden seat to max out class you need 30 to get 14

8569
11:11:43,540 --> 11:11:46,900
okay that's fair oh you got a 14 flat

8570
11:11:49,940 --> 11:11:55,140
right however we pick up the next and then we'll go back in the dlc and see what we're looking at

8571
11:11:56,100 --> 11:11:58,260
what the situation in hand is

8572
11:12:00,260 --> 11:12:02,980
because i don't know if it's going to be as bad as i remember

8573
11:12:04,020 --> 11:12:11,940
but maybe we go for smithing stones next or if we just focus and behave and see what happens

8574
11:12:18,020 --> 11:12:18,900
i'm not going that way

8575
11:12:19,220 --> 11:12:24,420
i'm never born as always a good thing

8576
11:12:25,140 --> 11:12:29,060
i feel like when i get sleepy though i ain't i ain't doing my best you know i ain't beating

8577
11:12:29,060 --> 11:12:33,620
everything out the way i should or like being a gift ball and coming up with like all my

8578
11:12:33,620 --> 11:12:38,500
my little tangents like disappear because my brain's like i'm too tired to even connect one

8579
11:12:39,220 --> 11:12:43,620
one real reference or something similar to what you've just read good night

8580
11:12:49,140 --> 11:12:51,140
wow

8581
11:12:54,660 --> 11:12:59,300
who's that is he just contemplating like we'll leave him to contemplate

8582
11:12:59,300 --> 11:13:05,140
make you thinking about jumping don't do it it gets better

8583
11:13:05,700 --> 11:13:07,380
oh

8584
11:13:11,940 --> 11:13:15,060
the battlefield wait are we just on a massive u-turn

8585
11:13:16,980 --> 11:13:18,100
i think we might have

8586
11:13:21,060 --> 11:13:22,020
the press giant

8587
11:13:25,540 --> 11:13:27,940
i almost killed that boss but he's still beating me up

8588
11:13:30,340 --> 11:13:34,180
maybe i should raid into your guys's games and be the fighter

8589
11:13:35,140 --> 11:13:39,140
although that'd be really hard to stream but it no

8590
11:13:41,060 --> 11:13:43,380
it's a wagon i remember

8591
11:13:48,420 --> 11:13:49,220

uh right jeez you're going really far ahead when you're gonna go out of bed

8621
11:16:47,220 --> 11:16:55,060
i just run past them all honestly some sections are like that actually this is controversial

8622
11:16:55,060 --> 11:16:56,420
and no one's gonna like it

8623
11:17:01,300 --> 11:17:05,220
uh do we have to make sure we don't freaking congle line into an arrow

8624

it's hard to tell him to listen at all that's the only

8638
11:18:46,260 --> 11:18:50,180
thing we're all ganging off on an enemy

8654
11:20:48,340 --> 11:20:58,420

8670
11:22:40,500 --> 11:22:42,740
okay last we can have one more

8671
11:22:43,380 --> 11:22:50,900
two more flasks from i'm unstoppable i'm just a hp chugging machine

8672
11:22:54,740 --> 11:22:59,460
the soundboard audio is doubled oh it comes out of desktop and stream thick

8673
11:22:59,700 --> 11:23:00,180
thing

8674
11:23:08,500 --> 11:23:11,540
there's only one reefling that can able to do this at the location

8675
11:23:13,540 --> 11:23:16,740
did i miss the map i've i'm not discovered it yet

8676
11:23:18,900 --> 11:23:20,820
it must be up ahead wherever the heck i am

8677
11:23:21,220 --> 11:23:26,020
i can go i'm gonna just wait okay i wait

8678
11:23:26,020 --> 11:23:29,940
put away put away i don't have any interest in

8679
11:23:31,460 --> 11:23:37,060
i'm gonna change what do you want is it nice i like polite by both

8680
11:23:37,860 --> 11:23:42,580
to be my sin if you're at disadvantage anything the girls do it's all me it's all me

8681
11:23:43,380 --> 11:23:47,140
oh nothing oh

8682
11:23:52,900 --> 11:23:57,620
i guess people at the end game can't get some in here wait really

8683
11:23:59,940 --> 11:24:02,660
i just woke up and you're so going god you're so precious

8684
11:24:03,220 --> 11:24:05,940
stop it reefling you're precious do the reason why i have strength

8685
11:24:06,900 --> 11:24:07,940
oh sorry wrong one

8686
11:24:10,980 --> 11:24:14,980
i think you're the only there's only one more reefling that can make it

8687
11:24:16,260 --> 11:24:19,300
it's because the city changes after the realm of the giant

8688
11:24:24,820 --> 11:24:28,340
it's not looking good i put down a sign

8689
11:24:29,140 --> 11:24:31,380
is your password

8690
11:24:35,940 --> 11:24:39,540
every time look i gotta bless the reeflings before i send them in

8691
11:24:44,100 --> 11:24:50,420
oh no i think the game's really limited you're gonna have to carry everything

8692
11:24:50,420 --> 11:24:54,740
reefling like no pressure if you're the only one that can load in you have to carry this entire

8693
11:24:54,820 --> 11:25:00,660
section i guess if we burned the tree we would actually be in a different area

8694
11:25:01,220 --> 11:25:08,660
oh no okay we have a second reefling i don't know if any invaders can make it i don't think so

8695
11:25:08,660 --> 11:25:17,300
i think everyone's cooked so we need to try and get through this area as fast as possible

8696
11:25:17,380 --> 11:25:19,060
without being invaded somehow

8697
11:25:24,180 --> 11:25:27,060
i'll literally we need to do as fast as possible are we ready

8698
11:25:28,420 --> 11:25:33,540
oh wait no there is a reefling there's a reefling that can be the invader oh my god we don't have

8699
11:25:33,540 --> 11:25:35,460
to like panic thank god

8700
11:25:39,460 --> 11:25:41,140
i'm getting nervous i'm getting shaky

8701
11:25:42,100 --> 11:25:46,100
this is the east coast patrol rampart

8702
11:25:49,700 --> 11:25:53,140
look at my cloak honestly i need a quilt creature right now

8703
11:25:53,700 --> 11:26:00,580
i'm so down for our quilt oh we're safe we're safe we don't have to worry about people beating us up

8704
11:26:00,580 --> 11:26:06,420
right are we ready reefling i don't know where we're going or what we're doing but let's do it

8705
11:26:06,420 --> 11:26:10,420
let's do it a quick adventure try a minute adventure reefling

8706
11:26:20,420 --> 11:26:22,660
i'm guessing if we go this way open the door

8707
11:26:25,380 --> 11:26:27,380
it does not do a single thing like that

8708
11:26:29,540 --> 11:26:34,900
okay we're beating up snowmen we said global warming

8709
11:26:36,420 --> 11:26:41,940
rid of them snowmen right now i got 10 no i got one 10 i can't bring

8710
11:26:46,420 --> 11:26:47,380
which is easy

8711
11:26:51,780 --> 11:26:55,700
oh he's a chicken nuggy he's got knee arms knee legs and he looks in the castle

8712
11:26:57,460 --> 11:27:04,340
oh my gosh this room's gorgeous look at all the plants it's just like the farm food thing

8713
11:27:04,340 --> 11:27:10,420
i'm gonna have all these plants around and then when you come home tired from work i'm going to

8714
11:27:10,420 --> 11:27:16,660
tell you all about my plants and you're gonna be like god she's so dumb i want to fight her

8715
11:27:17,620 --> 11:27:18,900
and it's the good life for her

8716
11:27:27,140 --> 11:27:32,980
oh oh no reefling reefling quickly quickly so you don't take fall damage

8717
11:27:33,860 --> 11:27:35,300
okay that was good reefling

8718
11:27:37,460 --> 11:27:38,820
the sea collection grows

8719
11:27:40,340 --> 11:27:47,220
capital area so i think because it shows like mild civilization in between like all this death

8720
11:27:47,220 --> 11:27:58,660
and decay uh possible because i always wonder i'm always like how how do people travel in the

8721
11:27:59,140 --> 11:28:05,220
roof and stuff in this game because isn't it too dangerous for the average person because if

8722
11:28:05,220 --> 11:28:09,220
we're having to do all of this stuff or is it the average person like everyone has to learn

8723
11:28:09,220 --> 11:28:16,980
like some sort of skill or craft and in order to like go anywhere there's no cities

8724
11:28:17,380 --> 11:28:21,460
oh sorry sorry

8725
11:28:26,100 --> 11:28:36,740
but it's oh sorry am i gonna just wall try something oh i think i'm not very uh

8726
11:28:37,060 --> 11:28:39,060
this is magic unfortunately that's

8727
11:28:46,980 --> 11:28:50,660
happy being those games are always basically supposed to pull off everything's falling apart

8728
11:28:50,660 --> 11:28:57,220
not to stay for anymore um okay i'm gonna say like how do you people eat

8729
11:28:59,460 --> 11:29:05,860
like i don't see any farms the carrot is growing aren't you guys hungry

8730
11:29:07,460 --> 11:29:10,260
like who sits up the food does anyone even eat

8731
11:29:11,620 --> 11:29:16,020
does anyone even need to eat maybe it's like a car okay you guys have split one reefling

8732
11:29:16,020 --> 11:29:22,260
two reeflings are gone oh there's a fight hold on are we fighting or are we

8733
11:29:24,180 --> 11:29:26,020
okay we're fighting we need to help that reefling

8734
11:29:28,340 --> 11:29:30,100
don't wait you carefully dodge that

8735
11:29:30,900 --> 11:29:36,420
uh i will say i pressed b but i was already locked into the big boy animation okay

8736
11:29:39,940 --> 11:29:41,140
i'm sorry i just blocked you

8737
11:29:43,540 --> 11:29:45,700
okay when they're taking a critical you actually can't

8738
11:29:48,900 --> 11:29:54,020
there's a guy on the stairs as well over to him where are you going

8739
11:29:54,180 --> 11:30:03,380
oh this grace had a lot of problems i don't think i can summon you guys properly after that

8740
11:30:05,380 --> 11:30:08,900
i feel like run through this whole area on my own

8741
11:30:10,420 --> 11:30:14,500
it's not even in some big on my own i had to run through this whole area

8742
11:30:14,500 --> 11:30:19,620
i'm scared there's actually a lot of areas in the like later game

8743
11:30:20,180 --> 11:30:30,260
that you can't hit anything wait oh there's an enemy there oh no sorry they weren't even

8744
11:30:30,260 --> 11:30:32,180
attacking me oh i feel bad for them

8745
11:30:34,980 --> 11:30:38,260
hold on i need to get my stamina back stop it

8746
11:30:40,820 --> 11:30:44,980

8748
11:30:55,620 --> 11:30:58,020

8749
11:31:01,140 --> 11:31:05,060
we made it oh we're going up okay let me grab something

8750
11:31:06,580 --> 11:31:07,220
something here

8751
11:31:11,860 --> 11:31:13,060
the rag and wind

8752
11:31:15,620 --> 11:31:19,940
oh i remember oh my god how do i not even see that when we entered

8753
11:31:20,580 --> 11:31:25,780
did they like perfectly hate to view this i feel like when you look up you'd notice like a dragon's

8754
11:31:25,780 --> 11:31:29,700
empire like it's got the old scale you've already

8755
11:31:39,860 --> 11:31:42,580
rune art that helps me in fate

8756
11:31:49,700 --> 11:31:51,220
oh no we're running out of time

8757
11:31:51,380 --> 11:31:53,380
hmm

8758
11:31:54,900 --> 11:31:57,220
i've laced in 25 minutes when it seems like i'm going to be dead

8759
11:31:59,540 --> 11:32:00,740
please don't fall off the map

8760
11:32:05,460 --> 11:32:05,940
do you mind

8761
11:32:07,620 --> 11:32:11,380
don't hurt my wraithlings don't give them jump scares either that's not nice

8762
11:32:12,180 --> 11:32:20,980
i think we can keep going

8763
11:32:24,820 --> 11:32:26,020
okay there's a bit of a fate

8764
11:32:28,580 --> 11:32:29,540
do you not have kills

8765
11:32:31,700 --> 11:32:36,500
okay oh i see the seed i see the seed right let's go wait do i take the seed

8766
11:32:37,380 --> 11:32:40,180
i don't fuck let's go

8767
11:32:45,220 --> 11:32:45,620
flying

8768
11:32:48,340 --> 11:32:49,620
it's going for my bullsack

8769
11:32:54,020 --> 11:32:54,580
have you gone

8770
11:32:56,260 --> 11:32:58,900
no it's targeting me and i'm in a corner this is a terrible idea

8771
11:32:59,620 --> 11:33:00,900
i

8772
11:33:05,700 --> 11:33:07,220
i just healed the undead

8773
11:33:15,700 --> 11:33:18,980
i like welcome welcome welcome oh wait it's a week

8774
11:33:20,900 --> 11:33:24,660
i'm so happy here okay we go to seed

8775
11:33:26,660 --> 11:33:27,540
there we go

8776
11:33:29,860 --> 11:33:39,380
uh whatever do seamless co-op mod um i would have to do it with one of the girls because

8777
11:33:39,380 --> 11:33:45,620
i think there's ip issues if i did it like that whereas when doing it this way it is through

8778
11:33:47,300 --> 11:33:47,540
and

8779
11:33:50,260 --> 11:33:53,540
it's through the servers which keeps me safe as strummer

8780
11:33:54,260 --> 11:34:00,500
oh they can jump i was like haven't seen you over here they can jump

8781
11:34:01,620 --> 11:34:07,700
it's not i think it's not a crazy concept that any of you can jump but you did see here

8782
11:34:07,860 --> 11:34:09,860
it's

8783
11:34:24,260 --> 11:34:25,860
we are beating up these plant men

8784
11:34:27,860 --> 11:34:30,660
i suppose it's mushroom if it's the score it's not plant them

8785
11:34:31,620 --> 11:34:38,420
oh no is there not a save point no there's only a save point after the fight

8786
11:34:41,540 --> 11:34:42,820
is this a solo fight

8787
11:34:48,740 --> 11:34:50,980
seamless yeah i was going to do seamless with sin

8788
11:34:51,300 --> 11:34:58,980
oh no right i don't know if you guys can come in i hope you can

8789
11:35:02,020 --> 11:35:05,300
oh thank god i get so nervous

8790
11:35:20,980 --> 11:35:27,300
um

8791
11:35:38,740 --> 11:35:44,260
i actually like his attack pattern because i have enough brain power to like respond a little bit

8792
11:35:44,260 --> 11:35:46,900
now i know i'm getting walloped don't get me wrong but

8793
11:35:47,860 --> 11:35:52,020
do i need to bring him in the open i think we need to bring him in the open a bit

8794
11:35:56,180 --> 11:36:01,620
he's like really swinging weirdly in that way which i think they're like hitting us so well

8795
11:36:07,220 --> 11:36:08,180
okay it's rolling pit

8796
11:36:08,180 --> 11:36:12,020
okay hold on

8797
11:36:15,540 --> 11:36:17,300
oh he changes like the last second

8798
11:36:18,260 --> 11:36:24,980
oh wow i feel like that's going to when he's lost on the ground is pretty cool

8799
11:36:26,580 --> 11:36:30,020
play safe and heal again oh i said i'm gonna play a safe and heal again

8800
11:36:32,020 --> 11:36:38,020
oh my gosh okay god free has been banked there we got it i got

8801
11:36:38,740 --> 11:36:44,180
poachers thank you replays okay what can we put on we just put on

8802
11:36:45,540 --> 11:36:50,580
the critical hit one because it probably got gone right now are you coming out no the game's just

8803
11:36:50,580 --> 11:36:52,820
yeah i was gonna say the game's just slowly kicking you out

8823
11:38:45,300 --> 11:38:52,740
um for some reason after the 11 hour mark the thing 11 hours and 55 minutes the vod

8824
11:38:52,740 --> 11:38:58,900
becomes corrupted even though you can still stream appropriately i could keep streaming past it

8825
11:38:58,900 --> 11:39:05,060
and you guys would see it fine but if someone comes to watch it it doesn't like it like at all

8865
11:43:57,220 --> 11:44:04,500
safe station down touch the wall of thorns impenetrable thorns refuse all none may enter the urge tree

8866

hello again old friend allow me a moment to converse with you you are unable to enter the urge

8871
11:44:40,740 --> 11:44:49,700
tree no you're prevented by the mantle of bars the thorns are impenetrable a husk of the urge

8872
11:44:49,700 --> 11:44:57,140
trees being that spurns all that exists without the only way to stand before the elden ring

8873
11:44:57,780 --> 11:45:07,860
and become the elden lord is to pass the thorns my purpose serves to aid in that very act

8874
11:45:08,580 --> 11:45:17,940
so i'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of ruin far above the clouds

8875
11:45:18,740 --> 11:45:26,820
upon the snowy mountaintops of the giant so i can't remember i can set the urge tree a flame

8876
11:45:26,900 --> 11:45:32,980
she still stays with me after the burn to becoming elden or am i being dumb

8877

8917
11:50:08,340 --> 11:50:14,260
the reeflings and by me and the reeflings doing that i mean you guys do roughly 99% of the work

8918
11:50:14,260 --> 11:50:20,020
and i do the 1% and have an amazing time because i get to enjoy elden ring experience without being

11:50:20,020 --> 11:50:26,580
frustrated or upset because i'm a little baby thank you so so much my little reeflings i will
