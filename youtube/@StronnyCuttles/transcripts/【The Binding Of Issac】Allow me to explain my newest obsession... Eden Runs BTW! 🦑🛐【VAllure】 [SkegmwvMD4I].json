{"text": " Oh, so if I push for me, you read it, you read it, you read it, are you waiting until it registers? For some reason it doesn't register, really. I'll wait for YouTube to prompt me to put ads on, that's when I know I can start talking as soon as YouTube's like, do you want to put ads on? I'm like, no. No, I'm running started with a stream, why would I want to put ads on? Good morning, good evening, good afternoon. Is my fucking model crashed? Whoa! Excuse me, I saw that. OBS is currently eating 40% OBS, hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who or what? Nothing is open. OBS, relax! 40%? The Binding of Sheevee, honestly. I do not know why I'm lagging. Is there memory leak on the fucking main menu? Goddamn. Don't laugh that I'm not on a win streak. Me, thank you for becoming a member. Dear Asical, thank you for redirecting into my high snowberries, I don't know why OBS is melting. Whoa, you're breaking my model, OBS, what the fuck? Holy shit, I think it's not an Isaac Data leak, it literally says OBS bro, you need to calm down, who or what? I got the movie, I got the movie open for later, I might have to delete the answer. I'm sure maybe that much of a video. Right, looks good bro, I enter the news, I'll pretend that my model isn't lagging. So this game is called the Binding of Isaac, is that a biblical reference? Yes it is, this game is about a 5 year old boy called Isaac. Just close and reopen OBS, I don't know how to inform you, OBS is what I'm streaming to you on, you're asking me to reset the stream, no chance. You should reinstall it. So this is the Binding of Isaac and it is about a poor 5 year old boy who experienced severe religious trauma and this poor boy has to go, I don't know the quickest, basically long story short, he sees himself as a bad child, he sees himself as a part of the devil and he chooses to lock himself in a chest in his room, all while his poor mother and father are trying to find them, unfortunately his mother and father split, but these characters you see on this main menu, Isaac, Magdalene, Cain, Judas, Eve, Samson, sorry Blue Baby, Samson, Azazel, Lazarus, Eden, The Lost, Lilith, Keeper, Apollyon, The Forgotten, Bethany, Jacob and Isu, these are all Isaac, my poor little boy Isaac is currently inside a chest hallucinating due to the fact he is losing oxygen inside the chest. We are going to do what's called an Eden run, Eden tokens you might notice, what did I purposefully plan such an escapade on Eden tokens, no that's just how perfect the world is for us reeflings and snow bears are hanging out too, thanks snow bears, I do appreciate you, so poor little Isaac, we are going to do what's called an Eden run, Eden starts with two, statistically two items, although you can start with an active item, a passive item and a trinket, if you're really lucky, but it's completely random what you get, so we look at Lazarus in comparison, we see Lazarus has three hearts, two speed and two damage, Eden is randomized and it can produce quite a unique run, so we're going to try an Eden run, just normal, I've not played, the last time I played actually was when the girls had just been picked, okay so we have the pickaxe, our passive is the wafer, do you see that little tiny red circle under the minimap, look I'm kissing it, see this little circle, thank you June for becoming a member, I appreciate it, the wafer means that I take half health damage now, so this is an incredibly lucky run, and my active item is the pickaxe, which can actually let me get into secret rooms in this game, that circle will literally be, okay, so now I want you to notice this detail, I'm going to write a review on this game, this is a 10 out of 10 game experience for me, so if we look at our stats on the left side, Isaac's base stats are 1.0 for speed, that's a little boot with speak marks coming behind it, I always get fire rate and tier size mixed up, but it's below average, our range isn't awful, but everything is really not the best stat wise, we have a pretty decent tier rate honestly, not bad, not bad at all, unfortunately, unfortunately, it could be better, what have we got, so this is a passive unfortunately which will not give us anything other than money, now there are shops in this game, oh see this is a perfect example of why our starting item is such a good lucky pull, we normally would need a bomb in order to access this, so because we already have a soul heart on our persons, we are going to pick it up because we will take soul heart damage over red heart damage, I already missed the rock because our tinted rocks also wasn't paying attention, oh wait, am I going to, no, sorry, sorry, wait what do you mean I missed our rock, motherfucker, right, there's also a thing called tinted rocks in this game as well, whoa, right, we've got BFF, that's pretty decent, and the item room, oh for fuck's sake, right, hold on, hold on, embarrassing, embarrassing, here's me trying to be like, oh this is how this game works, and of course I missed something really obvious, oh for dear eye, I was like eh, there's no rock back here, oh that's so obvious, okay so there's also a thing called tinted rocks, when you destroy them you have the odds of getting one soul heart are pretty high, now you also can spawn trap doors, and depending on if they have a ladder or not, it would actually be kind of nice to get BFF in case we pick up a familiar, the odds of receiving a familiar in the game are pretty high, so these stone guys aren't real enemies, but I would like you to take a note, look at our body, and then look at the body of the enemies, okay, okay he may have just walked into the fire, all the enemies are poor little Isaac, and all the rooms are Isaac in the chest, look at the shape of this room, now I know you might be saying absolute schizophrenic gameplay, what do you mean the room, the room's rectangular, it's one of the most common shapes, and that doesn't make sense because look at the room you're going up ahead, look, they had to do some stuff, okay just relax, we're getting the pickaxe out, it's very safe to have the pickaxe, but everything relates to poor little Isaac being in a chest, now I knew the secret room was most likely there due to this long room especially spawning in on a flat floor, so this is called a bomb beggar, you can't, fantastic, fantastic, we are finding so many soul hearts, which I will tell you exactly why in the next level is very important to get these soul hearts, so this is a bomb beggar, an exchange of la bomba, he can potentially give us a payout of keys, of money, so if you wanted to do a cheeky exchange rate you most certainly can, but the original game, are you going devil, no, I am an angel player, now unfortunately me, thank goodness I was actually going to, that went really well, oh right, so sometimes rooms can spawn spiders that weren't originally there, if you don't want to, I have watched so many people play this game and I actually had no idea what's going on until now, allow me to explain, I started this game this year and it's just absolutely fantastic, so we're not going to carry this pill, but notice how it says question mark or unidentified pill, it could potentially be a good pill, it could potentially be a bad pill, I personally am not risking any stats down at the moment because we are needing a bit of health and this card, the two of hearts, not any tyrant cards, the two of hearts, doubles Isaac's red hearts, well that's actually pretty terrible, in all actuality that's pretty terrible, we might get a machine, so we've discovered those two secret rooms, so there's a secret room, a super secret room and there's actually an ultra secret room which we do not have access to, nor can I guess where it's located on the map, we could go inside, this is what's called the cursed room, so the reason why we're going to go in the cursed room, you notice those teeth marks around it, danger, danger, not good, however we have the wafer which means we will take half health, so for the sacrifice of one soul heart, we might be able to get something better, so we're going to risk it, we're going to risk it, we have received two black hearts, these have a necronomic effect, I'm an idiot there's a penny back in that room, we are going to bomb up my donation machine, you can see it's a bit low, so necro hearts are, we are going to pick up BFF, oh ok, we're not going to pick up BFF against the sadness of my heart because the likelihood of us doing it, we do have piggy banks, so we're going to get members access which opens up a, oh did I just freaking buy a pill, I might as well take it then right, what is it, what's the pill, ok it was actually a tears up, ok so that means we fire more tears, that was so lucky, we're not doing BFF, however we now have access to a secret shop, no it will be a ridiculous price and unfortunately it's very unlikely we'll be able to, again with the spiders, it's very likely, we're going to have to raise our economy, however thanks to the pickaxe, we can destroy, honestly we might as well just destroy, oh wait hold on we're not even done the boss fight yet, ok first boss fight, now you might notice those two symbols, bottom left on the statistics look I'm getting closer to them, see these, this is devil deal and angel deal chance, you do not spawn devil deal or angel on the first floor, doesn't matter, you can't get it, the exceptions are if you have a joker card, you spawn in with goat head for example, but for the first floor of the game, you ain't getting nothing, you ain't getting nothing, sit down ok, was the same colour of the pill the one you skipped, let's find it, no, so this is not a tears up or else it would identify itself as a tears up because we now know what type of pill that is, ok, so again we've discovered both rooms, we have actually purchased a secret member door, we do unfortunately have yet to receive the gurglings, right, three of them, this is terrible streamer luck, back off, stay back, on guard, on guard, ok so we just had a necronomic effect which is ok, that was terrible luck, ok we do receive a speed upgrade which is good, we are now above speed, the base game speed so we'll be able to kind of dodge more enemies, that was terrible luck three of them, but anyway we now have enough speed to get away from the most average enemy to make a bit of a room between us, ok, but we did it, we destroyed, oh poor Isaac, he got jumpscared on the toilet, Isaac is not, so you'll now notice on bottom left we now have 100% chance of a devil deal, if we were to receive any red heart damage we have two red hearts, a lot of souls and we necro as well on top, ok, sorry I'm going to drink my tea, before anyone that does know this game, no we're not doing boss rush, a kibiar's, unless we get Miss Bomba, I forget her name sometimes, I'm going to sit with my tea, but yes this game is absolutely fantastic, unfortunately for level 2 we got what's called the burning base mint, if you look on the walls you'll notice there's fire but what means is that there's also a few enemies on this floor, Mama Mega, there you go Miss Mega, I was close enough, Mama Mega is the exception that'll let you into the boss rush room, but no we're not going to do any alt pathing, we're not going to do any of that, I'm just going to show the basics, we're going to hopefully have a successful run, I would very much enjoy an item that does some, is that a cat hair in my tea, I swear Gimli, is that a cat hair in my tea, hold on a minute, no oh my god it's just schizophrenia, it's just schizophrenia I'm sorry, right hold on, no we're not doing hush either but yes this game is a 10 out of 10, it is absolute chaos the first time you play it and I kid you not it takes hours upon hours to even comprehend what you're doing, you might think oh Isaac, Binding of Isaac that we game, where that cute little pixel boy runs around, absolutely not, this game is horrific but I will point out we picked up the bell and look at our stomach, we have a bell on us now, as you pick up items Isaac will reflect those items, that's why we're currently glowing blue right now, that is because of the wafer, fantastic angel item that we spawned in, it's just schizophrenia, I relate to that on a personal level, don't you have to unlock the burned rooms too, yes I forgotten how I unlocked it but yeah, Binding of Isaac players be like I have 4000, I'm still a rookie, yes so this game, if it is a game for you or might be a game for you, it becomes multiplayer in November which obviously you know exactly what that means, we flings, we're all going to be playing it together, the lobby sizes can go up to 4, so basically we're going to have quite a few endurance marathons and multiplayer together, Strone is truly the Binding of Isaac Warmaster, I wish we could do an omega run, the likelihood of an omega run is absolutely minuscule unless our secret room, actually speaking of secret room, how cool would it have been if it was in there though, imagine if it was, sometimes the secret room spawns directly in the room you spawn in, well it is a lovely game and I can't wait to play with you in November if you are an Isaac player, I do not have all unlocks, I do not have, I don't even have a second file, you're supposed to have all unlocks on a file 2 and 3, I don't even have them on one, but the items you receive from the treasure room, from the shop etc will shape your run as well as the angel and devil deals will come in clutch, now originally I said I would do angel deals but I have to admit with our high HP right now I'm a bit tempted, I have so many arrows in the game I still don't know how to spawn the angel room, if you take, if you walk inside a devil deal, you are not allowed an angel room, if you walk inside it, if you ignore it and go down into the next level your angel room will take over your devil room percentage, you can also raise it by going on the sacrifice room, or I think it's called the sack shuffle to some people, don't give in to temptation, no I want to show you the power of angel deals, I also want to show you something critical you must do if you want to raise your angel deals, I will also do it in greed mode, I'm going to play one Eden run and then we're going to play one Lilith greed mode, just to talk through the mode, greed mode Lilith is the easiest character you can play by far due to her treasure blocks, I've almost finished my tea I promise, I promise, Lilith Seals so okay I'm going to get a wee drink of water as well, I can open it this time without my wrist cracking, you're allowed to visit but don't take anything, I haven't found that unless I'm being daft, I always find ignoring it is the way it goes, right this room is smaller on her little map, can you see her little map on the top right, so likely there's not too many enemies in here, so we are just going to go this way but yeah there we go, and now he shoots in a diagonal at diagonal, up at downy 4, these red poops cannot be destroyed and you do not get items from them, do not be fooled, do not be fooled they are not good, but you will get, you will encounter enemies that like you can't reach or you can't do anything with, okay no, no I'm not energy, if I could get a spoon spender, if I could get a spoon spender that would be great, so we only have one key right now, so I'm actually going to pass on the shop, we only have three coins so there's no point, I'm going to look for a tinted rock but there's no tinted rock in this room, well I have, Jesus, getting my hammer out for this one, get down, relax, I only just got in the room, there is a chance, there you go, I was going to say, there is a very high chance your secret room is actually right before the boss, it's so common, curious, I do not have, your luck percentage doesn't affect machines like that, apparently, but I don't know how much I believe that, peeking the first devil deal makes you next 50-50, but if you ignore then it locks in, okay that makes sense, okay we're gonna get the fucking pickaxe out again, geez, we keep getting rooms that are like really bad, right, again we only have one key so we're going all out on the item room, surely, surely it's a good item, it's an active item, yeah, okay, I don't need an active item, maybe we can get a black rune, don't want to, oh, yep, okay, sorry, I saw that come in halfway across the room, I was like, I do not have the speed for these guys, okay, one more, one more, one more, those Isaacs have a bomb in their head and they chase you down, which isn't very nice, but is that gonna stop them, no, so we actually are gonna bomb for this one, the reason because is we can actually get money from the pops, like that, so again, spider spawned, but we're just gonna leave the room, don't even have to deal with them, as for the secret room, okay it's here, sorry, I have a bit of sense through the classic Isaac gaming experience, but we've discovered both our rooms, again we don't actually have any keys to access the shop, nor do we have enough for the premium item, sometimes items can be for sale in the shop, but we don't have a key, so we can't go in, however, we could bomb this fortune teller machine up for a chance, for a chance of a coin or a soul heart, but hey, I'd rather not gamble like that, I have found, oh, Jukka flies very easy enemy, oh my god, it's a big fly though, relax, I don't have the damage for all of this, relax, okay it's fine, it's fine, Jukka is very weak to bombs actually, so I'm just gonna put one, Jukka is very weak to bombs, so I'm just gonna, there we go, there we go, there we go, I was gonna say something, I'm just gonna put one down, he's very weak to bombs, so again, the devil deal has spawned, but we say no, we have received a range upgrade, and was that tier size, I wasn't paying attention, is this after birth, this is all of them, I've completely forgotten, so again, we don't have a key, we're gonna have to say sorry shop, and the active item was a lobomba, again, apologies lobomba, but you do not do anything for us, there's no tinted rock in this room as far as I can see, well, time to go next, we're saying no thank you to El Diablo, you could visit the curse room, I could, but because I had necronomic hearts, I like them as a lifeline, yeah, not this time, right, let's get toot, oh, I'm getting so distracted, sorry I was gonna talk about this flat wall, hold on, hold on, are you trolling me right now, right, notice how flat this wall is here, there's nothing against, oh for fuck's sake, of course it's not even the secret room, I was gonna be like, if you ever enter a room and there's like a really flat wall, that was absolutely terrible, hold on, I need MLG this right now, okay boom, normally the, oh for fuck's sake, I hate these guys as well, yeah, it's even they do like a triple spray, like bro, you don't even have the, you don't even have three familiar transformation, I've forgotten what it's called, you can't hurt him unless he's shown his wee neck, thankfully, oh wait, hold on, this wall is flat, okay, there we go, this wall is flat, so I came to, leave me alone, Mr. Spider, I'm so bad against spiders, literally it's the only thing that freaking kills me in this game, now we have a bit of a gamble, whoa, what did you do, a sack, oh well, we have a bit of a gamble, right, so look at my angel percentage, it says 33.8%, we are going to bomb this corpse in here, and look, it went up by 2.5%, so when you bomb it, I guess previous Isaac bodies is really the only way to see it, we're going to come back, we're going to come back to that room, let him get up, let him get up, although actually you can get in golden chests, you actually can get a few items in a secret room from a gold chest, so we may, I don't know, I don't want to miss the shop, we have really good economy and we have a member's card, which means we have access to, oh right, there we go, boom, boom, boom, let's see what's in here, key, we got our money, we got a key back, there we go, we have a tier upgrade and range and three random hearts, and we get very lucky with an necronomic and a soul, because we have that soul heart, I am happy to go back into the curse room, I'm going to sacrifice the soul heart to see what's at curse, are you fucking kidding me, it's just more spiders, um, now unfortunately our damage is low, which means that we are having to lick these enemies for quite a few moments, unfortunately he splits into two spiders, which I'm not looking forward to, there you go, um, now we, this does count as an active reward, like an active item reward, doing a room like this, but that is a shame that we didn't get a payoff, but hey, what the heck, uh, what a strange room, right okay, we've got super sloth, which isn't ideal with our freaking terribly low damage, and all these, wow, these things are absolutely, oh dear, oh my god, oh I need to start out spiders, please, no please, please, no what the heck, he can, stop, stop, stop, this is awful, stop, this is truly awful, please, stop, stop, stop, or my damn right, you're giving me a pedestal item, that couldn't have gone any worse, that's actually not that bad, right, if, okay, okay, we've got a black rune, um, we've also picked up a trinket that lets us, that was the worst, I couldn't have made that any worse if I tried, um, this is, that's why I'm saying we are very low damage, things are able to punish us very harshly, I'm just gonna check there's no tinted rock in here, no, not as far as my elf eyes can see, that was awful, and of course, please, I want spoon bender, so I don't actually have to aim, that would be great, one spoon bender, or familiar spoon bender, I'll take it, okay, there we go, now we do have a chess, which we've got two hearts from, please, um, right, so because we picked up the trinket on this floor, we actually don't have the respawn box, which is a shame, we are gonna take ice baby, we might be able to get conjoined three, now if we end up getting conjoined, this is where we go, draft, the game could have, um, the game could have, it's icy, oh it's icy actually, hold on, let's see if we can pick up an item for everyone, oh okay, Miss Dolly's gonna be sheebie, because sheebie has nice blonde hair, and then the red bow will be the red at the bottom of her hair, Emi is something evil, we don't have anything evil for Emi yet, but we're gonna pick it up, we're gonna hopefully get conjoined, normally you get a few more, see, oh my gosh, right, we need to stop taking damage, I ain't joking the way for saving us, re-factor, thank you very much for coming to member, so once an enemy's frozen you can actually use them to attack, um, I don't know where the secret room is, other than that one we're at, lawyer, I really don't like long room spawning in because I, oh they're bombs, the, the spiders are bombs, wow, are you joking that tiny wee thing, ah we're actually losing, the raw embarrassment, whoa, birthright and steam sale, steam sale lowers everything by half, birthright gives us three items to choose from, uh we've got dead bird, we can put our health up and shot speed up over dead bird, I don't know, dead bird might help us though, if I'm completely messing up, I mean there's no point in doing duality, oh is there though, no because we're going for angel, I, I mean shot speed going up or a bird that comes in attacks every time I take damage, wait I get electric at both, spawns both in devil and angel room if either, entering one makes the other disappear, I don't know, I, dead bird's gonna fm up though for me which is kind of what I'm needing, not gonna lie, not gonna lie, I'm kind of needing a bit of dead bird, but I'm needing health as well, right, fuck it dead bird, Eve come on in, right let's see what's going on down here in the basement, hello, hello, this soul, grants an aura that repels the projectiles, I know there's red key, um this is such a good batch as well because this would give me conjoined part two of three, I'm going for repel, I'm going to see if we can come up with the money, right okay okay we can get conjoined part two, okay okay conjoined part two, oh my god look at it, oh he's got we nail, we, that red key is pretty special, I'm gonna see if we can get a money off this keeper as well, no didoms, he does a veep attack this fly so you can kind of ignore him, are we that, we got a dame, wait oh we don't have enough though, wait, okay there we go, I was going to say the odds, and another soul, wow, wowie we wow, we're actually doing very lucky, yeah how do you say lucky, lucky, lucky, even though I suck at the fates, but we're actually doing pretty decent, why are you spawning two enemies, this is so unfair and I got hit, that's right, no get him get me, get him get me, beat him up, hold it, go get me go, go get me go, wow, let's go get me, you did it, and we got PJs, now we're full health, wow that's actually pretty insane, right a special fact with the angel deals, health up and damage, okay this if you want to continually get angel deals you have to do this thing that makes no sense, you have to attack this angel and they will drop a key piece which which raises your chances of getting more angel deals, don't don't ask to make sense of it, it makes no sense, literally attack an angel and oh I do have a mod that lets me know when they're laser fire because I have a few mods, I have laser fire mod, I have mum stomp because I can never see when she's gonna stomp down on me, I'm absolutely rubbish at it, truly rubbish, so angels can actually, I forget his name, but he can actually hurt himself on the blue fires, blue fires or you have a chance to drop, okay this is what we don't want with him spawning loads of different little guys, because that is gonna add up to damage over time which we're not interested in, you might notice our little buddy is bringing in some big massive hand, that is called big brother or little brother, his hand comes up, right here we go, so key piece two, getting both parts opens a big golden door, don't worry about the golden door okay, I doubt we're gonna do it, 25% angel room chance and our chance for an eternal heart goes up just a smidge, an eternal heart if you take it to the next floor will give you a full red heart, but again our angel deal chance has now just gone up considerably, now we are full health so we don't need to bomb this fire for a chance of soul heart, we are good to go, so that was an incredibly good one, no we're not going down the alt path, I'm too scared and it's too late anyway, we're not going against mother, we're going against mum, we have discovered both of our lovely jubbly secret rooms, we do have 15 bucks which is not enough for the red key, although I'll be honest and say I have zero success finding the ultra secret room, I see that I am description mode, oh yes, the creator Ed McMuffin as he likes to go by, whoa we got a library, oh we have no keys, oh that's not good, okay libraries if there's three books inside gives a, whoa a transformation chance to get bookworm which means we will have a chance to throw out two tiers pair, like two tiers like this, we need, whoa, I am so bad at dodging anything, did you see those spiders come, oh sorry fuck them up Gamma, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma go, right we do have a key, I'm gonna risk it and hopefully we get rewarded with bookworm with three books inside close enough, right 40 damage to all in the room or a black heart however using the item before boss fight makes the reward a devil deal, purchasing it does cost does not affect item pedestals in the voice, now I am going to take this, the reason is because it is infinite health source, I, I have faith, unfortunately this key beggar, I'm sorry I have no keys, he will have a higher chance to drop a key which he does, thank you very much, we say thank you pickaxe for doing your duties, you've done us fantastic, we have discovered all the secret rooms so far, we are going to ultimate because we can basically take devil items and be rewarded without the penalty of not being a loud angel, I am absolutely messing this up, sorry the, the familiars hook attack is really messing up with my eyes right now, yeah that's right just blame the game, blaming the game on itself, yeah maybe I'm just a bad player, I don't know you'll never know, devil items statistically are very strong however angel items you can roll an absolute terrible angel room, you can absolutely terrible like I don't know I guess the urn thing that pot thing that I never bother with is just awful, a little mushroom guys they have a lot of HP, I don't know if I want to use a key on that, I'll use a key, two bombs in exchange of one key when our economy on bombs is pretty high is perfectly fine, it's a bit rough but it's fine, we could go for this, ah fuck it, let's just go for the chest, let's see what's inside, let's see what's inside, oh we, oh we have an extra soul heart, fuck it, okay guess I deserve that, you suck, okay, yeah soul heart, rubbish that's why I hardly ever do the curse room because it's so stinky honestly, okay that was really lucky that our guy has curved bullets, now because we have so much HP we could consider the sacrifice room rather dangerous but but I mean we're not doing, we're not doing bad, these guys aren't too rubbish, a little bit rubbish, they kind of suck, we could consider it because actually I'm feeling risky you know that I'm feeling riskier, I'm feeling a bit riskier, is this where the secret room is, yes, player instinct, so this is a mimic chest, do you notice the blood on the bottom right, this, you will have to sacrifice health in order to access this chest, now I am going to do it because we have the wafer, whoop, whoop, we got a bomb and some money again, not, not absolutely not, the chest cannot hurt you, once you've opened up the mimic chest cannot hurt you, so don't worry, the sac room will give us a lot of piggy bank money, you are absolutely correct little rifling, thank you for reminding me, I think we're gonna do it, I think we're gonna be a bit crazy into the sacrifice room, now I will talk through the sacrifice room and I will give you all the secret deets and all, but the reason we're gonna do it is because it's going to significantly raise our, or it should anyway, significantly raise our angel chance which means we don't have to skip a floor of no chance, it's very good to try and avoid having no kind of reward, now you'll always have a boss item, you'll always have a treasure room, don't get me wrong, again we have the bible, right, there should be a pay to win machine in here, ah, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, have satanic bible, right, those flies can't hurt you but they can take away charges on your active item, so for example satanic bible has six active charges, those little guys will come and bop you and all you'll hear is mew, mew, we are not gonna spend our money just yet because I want to see what the shop has to offer but we might purposely roll for conjoined, let's see what the shop has to say first before we make a decision, okay, now we are just gonna kind of run around, we are getting poison damage by our familiar, very happy with that, again free, there, no, okay unfortunately it's a, no, okay, the more money you hold in your hand the more likely you are to spawn a greed fight, this is called a greed fight, there are no items in the shop, we are very lucky to have the membership passive which means we do still have access to a shop down below, it's not restockable, I'm like 99% sure it's not restockable the way we, this shop would be, oh no, gammy, you're too late, I messed up, I lost some hearts for that, I suck, gammy, I've let you down but thank you for your service, gamgoo, we appreciate you, okay, let's see what we're looking at, we've got a necronomic, we can sacrifice, 50% chance for a treasure room, I think we're on floor three so there's like three more, no, no, we're better with restock, we have very good economy, look at A.C. just hiding behind the ladders, A.C. do you want to, oh well there you go, we are going to do the sacrifice room now because again we have the wafer which makes sacrifice rooms very worth its while and I'm feeling lucky, okay so because I have the item description it tells me exactly what's coming up next, 50% chance for a coin, do you feel, are you feeling lucky brief ones, are you, oh yeah right because we have piggy bank we got more, okay we didn't actually get a payout so look 67% chance for an increase, we didn't get it, of course we didn't, okay we've got a chest, let's go, bomb and a key, lovely, lovely, okay are, wow it only did 6% are you serious, okay okay yeah one more, right we got our heart back that's fine so this one you bop it, run out, run away, run inside, spawn the angel and go bombs, go fuck them up, fuck them up, go gammy, go gammy, go, right the reason why we're destroying this angel, yes I know there's a host in the corner I'm trying to avoid him, the reason we do this is because we now have two key pieces, look our angel it has increased again I shouldn't have picked that up yet, okay this is the last upgrade, it's 50-50, money or soul hearts, okay this is very good for us we're gonna keep the restock box, trinket, it means there'll be a restock machine that spawns in our lovely jubbly treasure room, item room and we are gonna focus on that, I am now going to use satanic bible because we're going to try and maximize our hearts now that we've done that so we're just gonna roll, I see you're right on top of the item so it's a bit hard to tell what we're looking at, no not very good, unfortunately we actually have too many soul hearts etc and we don't need to spawn Gabriel because we have a full key piece already so there's no need to spawn Gabriel, no need at all we've got full key it will not increase our angel chance or anything like that don't worry and so again candy to heart we can't even utilize well we have far too much soul and black hearts or neck hearts, it's not a bad item but it's not what I'm looking for I really prefer conjoined right now, I mean I mean it's all right it's not terrible but it's not quite what we're looking for, the d20, if only we were in greed mode I I don't care that was very unfortunate that we didn't get a conjoined for that and we cannot enter the battle dome because we're not 1 hp sometimes it will open up under other circumstances but that was very unlucky and that we didn't really get I should have taken that and was it not the cloak wheel now we have such high economy it's definitely worth it to go to this judgment he's not a beggar he's a judgment right so bombs are a two tile radius so one tile two tiles does that make sense there we go and then we're just gonna jam ourselves in the corner and then this judge two coin judgment streamer luck two coin judgment is insane two coin judgment gash galley okay I don't like him because he sprints halfway across the map that is insane streamer luck two coin judgment judgment normally asks for a pretty penny off of you I'm talking around um at least 15 like almost an exchange rate at the shop truly um that was insane we're just gonna check I think the secret room might be somewhere in here unfortunately I am very bad at finding obscure secret rooms yeah um we'll just press onwards and maybe it's outside the boss room um but a cheap day on oh well okay whoa that's so good as well come here please thank you now um do you notice how the water almost looks like an arrow pointed to here you know what I'm not gonna speak again for the evening um thank you for listening to me it's been fantastic uh I was going to say the game likes to hint where the secret room is to you normally it can be there so yeah unfortunately our super secret room is elsewhere please I am embarrassed do not acknowledge that now we're gonna keep the joker card on us in case of failure because this will take us to the angel no matter what okay we've got bumbo the poor lad just wants a bit of cash honestly um bumbo has a secret ah gammie please I'm doing so terrible please gammie um bumbo has a secret if he picks up I think seven to nine coins he will actually spot I am just not dodging anything at all thank goodness we have the wafer so we did fail but we have conjoined so conjoined means our damage goes down but what do you notice shot superiority gained oh yeah baby now we're gonna use the joker card to get us to our angel deal and it's absolute caca thanks for the waste of time mate uh see this is the problem that I have with Isaac you have angel and devil deals that don't give you anything so this is an example of you should have gone the devil and you shouldn't have wasted your joker card but we're gonna go back and pick up our little black room here because it's very op thank you thank you oh wait I am going to use the black room on the d20 and we will hopefully get some sort of stat upgrade that is useful and not to range because we already have 10 range is that tears right okay we got tears right up I'll take it tears right up we have quite efficient now I cannot guess where the secret room is I already popped the bomb there I'm sorry I'm just looking at the map for a possibility but unfortunately these kind of the bigger the map gets the weaker my guesses are did we do this am I being done I've already done the shop look I'm in no rush before and it's like eh you're taking so long to play the game relax chase chase we're just trying to enjoy ourselves I think it's right above you possibly all right we're gonna buy this car because we might as well right we've got the full card I'm gonna keep um I never played this game but I'm impressed with the amount of detail oh it's a very good game I thought here right we've only got three bombs so this is it one or done nah all right we're out we're already we're out of 5000 um but yes we if we pick up one more book we also get bookworm which means we'll spam even more shots for the price of no passive really um but we're just gonna go next I don't see any tinted rock in this room sometimes a boss fight has I don't know if it has a higher chance of a tinted rock but I seem to personally have a bias eh straight up fire rate yes sorry did I say the wrong thing fire rate yeah my tears come out faster so this is a different kind of battle dome room um we could full card it if we want however if we do this we get more uh active item entering a new floor that's it's not bad but because we have such high economy eh see we've just charged our active bar there and these enemies aren't oh my gosh why do I have such terrible damage I know I just took conjure at conjure conjoined as well which doesn't make this any easier oh I freaking hate these guys so much you can only hit them on the back of their head gammy why don't you come out like when I'm not perishing how about you come out like right now gammy and just deal with them please I'm so bad you can get I can't remember what the trinkets called it gives you a one in five chance of spawning a bird pair kill in the room uh I absolutely adore it whoa that was good that shatter right we're doing it we're doing it so for this room that's a yuck heart we actually don't want that it's worth not a full heart if that makes sense it's worth half a heart it does let you have a blue fly though that goes after enemies but it's not for me that's this niche for my um so that those two fires might indicate the secret room is also there the game likes to do double fires a lot can you stop pooping please um the game loves to do double fires like absolutely adores it I can't stop it normally again it's another indication that the secret room might be there no I don't I don't know if we're doing the curse oh okay so that was another hint no it wasn't I just suck at this game you know what you know what game you embarrass me anymore I'm taking it up with a pope or something are you drunk right we're not going in those rooms anymore we're actually not going in the cursed room anymore we've had absolutely nothing from it I've been they're making a mockery out of me they're making a mockery out of me right sorry any pop satanic bible um so we actually now have no angel deal chance what the heck am I mistaken because I pulled a joker card wait if I completely messed up this run I mean honestly we can go to the devil because of how much HP and the wafer in combination so honestly I'm not that mad I'm not mad I promise I'm not mad bro I'm not absolutely raging at the fact that uh we've just lost angel deals for some reason it must have been because I pulled the joker card um but this is the game that I learned tarot cards in I know we've been playing balutro recently or balutro as I call it um normally the wee secret room does spawn in this room in between these guys but I wasn't paying attention to where they spawned the enemies will also give you a hint if they're here but fuck it we'll try it I give it wait satanic bible raise took away my angel deal it's not fair give it back oh I hate these guys oh my god they like extend their neck if you get too close to you oh come on give me come on give me bend and spoon come on give me bend yeah boss oh for goodness sake right okay well I've kind of gone on a bit of a side quest that was useless poster oh my god please I'm not even hitting anything these guys in the middle are just getting a free wall upon me honestly right again we're now full health actually thanks to the satanic bible right there we go boom and we got a key which is good uh unfortunately yeah as the game gets larger and larger map wise I find it much so harder to find the secret rooms unless we can get blue treasure map in the shop potentially potentially blue treasure map allows you to see the secret and super secret room it does not reveal the ultra secret room but again we need red key to access that which we did pass on and I'm not familiar if there's any I see please um they're not too wow we've completely changed we don't have so many keys but hardly any bombs whoa scary guy we're just gonna spray them down in the middle how weak how weak is our attack holy crap we need like a damage anything please again we have another heart this is a unique room I don't recall ever being in it you can play this game for hours upon hours and enter a room layout you've never seen before in your life super secret rooms are usually close to the boss and connected to only one room okay they're not like this room okay okay uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh whoa it dropped a uh chest uh are these called globes or something whoa we have a guppy it's very unlikely we're gonna get guppy I don't hate infestation I feel like we can get something better though I hate it wait no I hate it stop giving me active I um huh right the reason I'm taking this is because it can phd it turns all bad pills to good and it can put your stats up I get yet instantly we've been gratified by our choice our speed is now up we can also take pills which is fantastic um I ran away from this pill what we got 48 hour energy which is not quite what we're looking for but that's okay but like again if there's no pills in the shop we can utilize okay so okay right get them gammy get them gammy that's right so if you're incredibly unlucky and you have a lot of money on hand your chance of getting super greeds goes up it's exponentially and we have been very unlucky to now miss out on two freaking shops but we did get an item pedestal I'm not gonna pick it up just yet in case there's some trickery you picked it up and dropped it again did I actually oh my god what are you lunch no what are you the livers what are you yera which duplicates whatever goodness I mean that's terrible yeah I have to admit this is probably the most frustrating mechanic I am playing normal mode the odds of us getting greed actually shouldn't be that high but if you play hardcore mode for unlocks you without fail yera I'm gonna hold on to yera yera duplicates so if we find something like a a pill maybe the um does is good so we are full money there's a room I didn't explore off to the side here my bed oh well I shouldn't have discovered it I take it all back but anyway we can take pills now and when we do blood donation machines we get even more money for it unfortunately we are having just terrible luck trying to get what we need um we don't need any of that the lean bags secret room is left of the treasure room do you solemnly swear wifling that is your final decision left of the treasure room okay if this if this secret room is not here you're being timed out whoa the bomb follow does ah we just wasted a bomb doing that no one move it okay you're not being timed out congrats unfortunately we are full we are very full of coins and we have nowhere to spend it and we destroyed the donation machine and we don't have an arcade machine uh arcade level I think arcade spawns every odd even four if you have five coins or more something like that um unfortunately we don't have enough bombs to try and find the super secret room what we got looky a bit of looky oh yeah a bit of looky yeah you like that yeah unfortunately he's a bam and uh yeah I'm gammie you know I meant that that was actually a tactical move to unlock gammie so gammie does all the work for us it was a tactical move it was a tactical move stop it stop calling me a new bin Isaac look I play it for fun okay too many sweats and Isaac too many sweats and Isaac this is what I just played for fun see gammie does all the work if there is ever a game where it was all about familiars I'll be in the development team because I like when the familiars do the work and I get to lay back and just enjoy the game I get to enjoy the music the aesthetics I get to enjoy the game design like come on come on go gammie go oh we get flay absolutely we are gonna take that and we're gonna pop satanic bible and we're gonna see what satan has to offer us we might actually get guppy the odds of getting guppy are like so rare we might actually do it holey moley well now that we have flight we're gonna take a little uh detour so when you have flight uh floor spikes can't stop you um I'm gonna grab that heart um but uh obviously you're not limited to the floor um crazy concept of the flight I know um I know I should probably take up through his head but uh due to the fact that satanic bible will help me out with health I oh but you have wafer you have wafer I know I know but I suck you can see I suck and to be honest we're actually not doing I should have taken the full card not that we're gonna be able so are you gonna point and do in this room because yeah I was gonna say if it's money then what's the point all right let's go oh flight is just so easy oh wait no there's gonna be a full card in this floor anyway um if I wanted to use it but it's not like we can get boss rush it's been an hour and we've not even perished mother dearest the most basic mother dearest mom's heart is it mom's heart no mom's heart it's the next one it's just man oh I should stop picking up coins oh the spider's coming at you no I'm hiding get away from me go away I'll let go away I'll let my familiars deal with you go away no I'm not taking any damage because you guys are ganging up on me so you notice that um black one over there how his pathing's given up because he's like I can't reach you it's actually quite humorous to do that in the game I like it um the game's just like I cannot reach you I give up um the game also has a soft lock feature um if you're in a room for too long uh the game will actually unlock it itself because it's like hold on a minute something isn't right you should be out of this room by now basically uh a treasure room for free sure sure okay mother's bra no we'll pass but thank you for the kind offer though uh an orbital no we don't really let enemies get that close to us a coin no no not on health either oh we're gonna say we no that's an act poggers poggers wait triple oh wait we okay we're gonna we're going up in damage but hold on let me cook hold on hold on let's see the damage let's see what happens whoo okay hold on wait I may have messed up a little bit but it's fine it's fine I actually don't mind this it's cute it's cute look at it look at it going everywhere we're just oh a Christmas miracle and we get f all of course we get f all right hopefully there's an item down here won the run with that literally now we could get midnight snack I don't want too many red hearts oh wait no the devil's gonna ask for that um automatically charges the first bar yeah if we could get that in greed mode that in the sprinkler that'd be great yeah that's all I need okay unfortunately the last shops have been yeah this is the last shop it's been uh rather disappointing I'll just buy stuff because I can really um justice uh justice yeah this is where I learned my tarot cards from justice gives you one of each pick up basically uh it does have a chance to give you a troll bomb that's on the town side um we are gonna just quickly kablamo these guys um have I used the bible this I'm gonna make sure to get an extra devil item because we are we're starting to not be now we do have flight the mobility that you get from flight is very important for like dodging enemies like for example this enemy I can I call me Duke can you come because I'm juking his ankles or something I don't know um maybe the secret room above here nope it's not uh that was why it's good to check rooms but like see how we're doing so much damage from across the room it's kind of splitting chat it's splitting um like oh fantastic again because of flight we don't have to spend a bomb and we can just see what's in this rubbish rubbish don't waste our time so again we can kind of hide behind items as well that obscure the enemy shots of us um the let's say the secret room might be here nope okay I will never speak again it looks like the secret room might be somewhere I don't know well we can pick this up now that's the name I haven't heard in a while what Duke you come that's a lot of words too bad I ain't reading them um no not here what the heck not there either the only problem with conjoined uh was it hetero chromium or whatever I've forgotten the name of the the shooty one um it gets very chaotic on the screen very messy on the screen I mean it could be to the left here one of our secret rooms I don't want to take any damage for this room though um and also notice how our tears we're kind of having to like guess okay thank goodness whoa no no no oh okay if this guy gets bombed he does not perish bomb beggar does not perish to bombs if you enrage him basically now I'm not gonna it's a shame he's not a general uh judgment or a bit oh well I don't know we might get we might get a rock out of this we did we got a small rock okay thankfully damage up again sorry my voice just cracked out of excitement uh we got damage up again oh holly molly sorry uh clearly uh playing uh fixed game if you wanted to play the uh seed with me it's tka1gv1y um if you want to play the seed don't you don't have to where the heck is the boss room oh I've walked past it sorry sorry I literally I was like there's a chance it could be small rock in here now notice this room and now if we don't kill her notice how you see mom's eyes coming through the door holes etc um and she's going Isaac Isaac okay keep that in mind keep in mind before I say what I'm gonna say next after the fight oh I didn't even know you were in here sorry oh we failed the devil deal which is a shame right did you notice how she was looking through the door almost as if she was peeping inside the chest and she finds Isaac and she's trying to desperately get inside we're still on time for boss rush one you're hilarious two oh my gosh I took me an hour to get to the mum fight the most basic level six mum fight um but yes uh when I talk about my uh when I do the review on this game which I'm very excited to do um I'm gonna talk about all my little theories because everyone's like got different theories about it but mine's like the reason why everything's rectangular is because it's you in the chest but um you heard your mum go Isaac we are gonna go down and we're picking up even more damage um the satanic bible doesn't work on that floor but that's fine no boss rush but maybe hush are you joking me you guys are having a Fibonacci sequence on me because you're you're having me on what was that range okay okay right I'm just gonna pop satanic bible now it doesn't really matter if we take damage because um range you'll notice the tears aren't actually hitting we're just having to guess the path of the tears it's not when you have this I've completely forgotten the name of that item when you have it you're not really actually aiming to hit directly with the tear you're even in front of them now our luck is gone up which means our drop rate on items uh is gone up which is nice and cool do appreciate um but we're just gonna walk around have a little uh have a peek into all the rooms we're not really we are not in trouble let's just say we're not in trouble I feel confident about this run I was a bit nervous uh he hemo claria hold on hold on hold on wait hold on need to stop swallowing what are you swallowing stop it someone is swallowing a hemo lacrea okay that's it hemo lacrea yeah you have to aim a bit funny we're hemo lacrea sorry let's do me a hold second now because what right if this isn't a guppy item you're not forgiving game close enough close enough uh what are you spawns a devil are you joking come on that's rubbish right we're gonna do it I was a terrible idea come on chaos card I mean I'll take it oh he gave us two hearts what the heck sure and what tablet have you given us luck up tears and damage and two black hearts and leviathan transformation right we're gonna pick this up hold on wait I'm gonna drop it real quick so I can read out what it does we've just picked up the chaos card using the card throws it in the direction Isaac is moving instantly kill any enemy except delirium and beasts so we can pretty much just instantly do this fight if we so desire um it's very good I'm gonna pick up the red hearts but we're not gonna go all the way back and we we got the pact which is fantastic absolutely fantastic is this a chance for the hidden room hey let's go whoa we got binge here temporarily two permanent startups depending on the food this is streamer luck because what on earth seriously binge eaters sitting in the secret room what is this luck well there's like an extra eye in here stop it literally 13 damage right now uh I'm tempted to do mega satan just for the hell of it we'll do the lamb and then we'll turn back for mega satan are you coming what are you doing okay okay we've got him we've got bomba I envy you give me your luck honestly this is like the best you didn't run I think I've ever had uh we do have a reroll if we wanted to redo this floor no rerolls all of Isaac's items no sorry this run is far too good to be mucking about with that if the run was bad and we were like struggling then yeah but no we're good okay luck our luck is now three after literally one floor it was like terrible no not gambas no this is you don't understand how good this run is like how good we've got it we've got infinite health we've got um opens all secret rooms okay we don't even have to think now there we go there we've got one secret room just like that oh we got pill room let's go opens all secrets up all secrets are you joking are those three those are three I can see forever's wow that was I know I've got the chaos card but hear me out I'd rather actually be able to see the next secret rooms as well on the next floor and be like I know it's a chaos card you can instantly kill wait we can instantly kill mega satan with that hold on hold on I'm being dumb we'll we'll do mega satan okay we'll do mega satan we'll do lamb and then we'll do mega satan and then we'll see if we can get a delirium portal and and send it in delirium all right we've already done the other secret room uh right okay okay okay we might be able to get the portal might I don't know but we're just gonna spam away we're gonna mind our own business over here keep spamming away uh blast assist splits into we are the ones um which is pretty nice um there's a lot of theme really re-apparent themes with the enemies I don't want false phd that's rubbish um a light snack um we'll take and again another example of a freaking devil deal not being a thing yeah and of course there's no guffy that would be too easy luck up sure tears up I'll actually take and range sure why not that was rubbish don't speak to me or my children ever again and real what about brimstone honestly curse of the blind how dare you okay we're gonna do him again because he was really good to us uh don't be shy now what what's this one sure don't be shy now for goodness sake I can't believe we're doing this but we're gonna sacrifice the health we're gonna drop the chaos card here go back inside and we're gonna turn everything into a fucking heart there jeez you're so needy mister beggar honestly you better give me something good that's all I'm saying hold holy moly please mister what is it damage up and fear shot okay so enemies are gonna back up off us which is uh range up as well sure sure enemies are gonna back up off our yaks um it's not really much point in this trinket anymore but we'll just carry it as a as a thank you to pay homage to it giving us absolutely nothing if i'm not mistaken and we actually didn't get anything from it um more damage good very good oh I didn't actually see that shot coming that was on me you know what else last night your mom thank you I'm sorry I'm sorry I just right it might be here the secret room no no get him I know I just completely gave up I was like trying to see it but I'm like no I just gave up whoa really too okay thank goodness we're all p because this room can be very dangerous but you should drop the monkey paw yeah I personally oh we're one away for guppy though right we're one away from guppy that we could get guppy from a chest we could get guppy from a chest I'm picking it up close enough close enough we can come back maybe there might be a sacrifice room yep well you're not guppy um right okay guppy guppy nope that's not guppy okay one more time guppy's tail guppy's tail I have bingier I have bingier that could have been that I have bingier are you kidding me okay okay right tick talk tick I could have been guppy twice that could have been guppy twice oh because we're on

hearts though that's my problem oh we can do the boss fight if we want though I need to pull satanic bible okay maybe maybe cursed I wasn't actually too bad holy moly this is insolent right at least I can see no that's actually we're kind of wrecking in deck and like I don't want to say it but maybe it wasn't the worst thing that could happen bro they can't even get close to us right we're gonna pop satanic bible to get an item I do want to reduce my red health because it's getting very big and I actually do last chance for guppy right now how are you we're doing good we're getting trolled a little bit but we definitely have streamer luck on our side but we're trying to get gupsters and it's just no quite happening the way we want it to which is fine wow we went completely guppy give us guppy guppy guppy guppy not sure what happened but this is gonna go well until the moment it suddenly doesn't oh no we can't lose I am I we literally cannot lose at this point in time we have the wafer we have so much going for us like that attack is just that shit insane it is why am I should I just go for the boss fight I don't really think we need to explore the room secret room looks like it's gonna be here actually I really need to stop doing that nope okay I tell the lie right we'll pop the bible so we can get a cheeky bit of it I forgot I forgot I forgot why I didn't realize we were

I think we're gonna have to use it on the lamp. I don't I don't think we're getting out here alive Right, I will drop the monkey paw Pick up the chaos card though Oh, we have gupsters. Okay, we have guppy here bowl I Percent chance for a rift. I'll take that and then we'll do health here Were you a backstabber hitting an enemy in the back? Yeah? Oh Okay, I need to I need to enter the room boss charged Okay, yeah me you do the rest Even though even though I didn't take damage get me you do the rest this is Democracy manifest Okay, okay, okay, that was lucky. Okay, that's a mimic chest and we're not interested Notice all the flies that's because we have guppies transformation. Wow that actually saved us I Worried We just need we just gonna take the snack We got guppy up by what cost honestly honestly though How could I be so foolish I'm gonna take the foot taking a damage chance I might actually take that on the basis of if gammy gets summoned out and he's our last lifeline Are she sorry Grants a random zodiac. Fuck it. What is it? What we getting? I Don't know what zodiac we got there Oh, yeah, I'm always pop the babel. Sorry We are sorry, I am having a try hard so much right now Right, what's that double shot wait, did that remove course I know Just make things worse for myself I it's very possible Don't charge don't charge go little flies go go guppy flies go. Oh that this orbital actually take the heat off of us I'm an idiot. It's not the one. I thought it was it was a freaking fly. I thought it was the fly that goes around the wall I am a dumb dumb Tears shoot slowing effect. I mean no, it's too late for any of these transformations It's too late guppy can carry you through the lamp save chaos for mega. Yeah, I Will try mega if we lose we lose at least we like literally had to which one though Contact them makes Isaac Isaac immune to damage and deals Nah, that's rubbish So I owe you. Well, thank goodness. There wasn't an enemy in there. I wasn't charged up Okay, and we're gonna go do the lamb. I have no idea. Oh, I keep forgetting Okay, oh I'll take it. I'll take it. We're where was it? Oh, it's below a Fart bean a little fart bean. Okay, we'll do a health. No, actually We'll do the fart bean because it's funny and I like it, okay If I just do that, it's just gonna okay. Okay. I see you see I don't really want to take Right, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do lamb and then we're gonna go back to mega Satan No damage no damage, okay, the rift is helping us out insanely right now because it's sucking him Okay, we're gonna go do mega Satan We're actually gonna go do mega Satan with freaking cursed I I am going to go into the other rooms I didn't realize how much of a speed down we had. Wow. How did I only just notice that? We're gonna hopefully get something Sure, why not? Let's get you root emick to you. I really can't take much more health. We are so slow. Oh Wait, there's a there is a a pill in here. Is it a speed pill? That would be great. Not gonna lie What are you? No, I Do we can someone look up do we need face to Satan with chaos card mega Satan face to magazine Oh, does more health slow you down? Yes, we have what's called binge eater and and every time we pick up a health We do get damage, etc. Sadly though Yeah, I can't see all right, sorry, I can't see what's going for me. That scared me I Probably better to kill Phase one with chaos at least yes two phases. Okay, what and then just don't mess up five heads Just don't mess up chaos car chaos card only kills one phase. I thought that Thought that Yes to be probably better to kill phase one because it's the longest phase okay Can we do it? Can we do it? No pressure. I Mean the good news is you can try phase one a billion times each failure only costs half of her Take the bad chest and use the book I Don't it's not gonna have an item only. Oh, it does have an item in it another charged attack. I'll pass right fuck it We'll take this No, let's go Your flies will melt through phase one if you get hit on phase two you'll tell you Let's try it come on what you got your fucking bam come on Come on Okay, we've got rift which will suck a lot of attack away, but we must be careful We must be careful We must be careful. I'm sweating. I'm sweating. Oh my god We have we have no way we have the zodiac over out. We're out take your time That was so dangerous, I'm not laughing Oh, it hit me cuz I touched it.

I repeat the rift is going to take the heat Come on face to face to come on point the card point the card point the card point the card Don't mess up point the card point the card pointing pointing card through Where the fuck is the card? Hello Where did the card go? How is it there? I? Wasn't on that side of the map How is it there? How is it there? I wasn't on that side of the map. I Wasn't even there am I going crazy help help help actually have to do the Satan fight with cursae I Wasn't on that side of the map though Please guppy's flies do it please Please Please guppy, please I got me baby boy. Come on guppy. Oh We did it delirium Delirium no, but we did it The rift sucked my card. Oh We did it yatta. Oh For goodness gravy Goodness gravy cursed I an exchange of guppy Oh Through Isaac he sees himself as a bad boy, but he's not a bad boy. We did it first try that was crazy I kept my card got sucked out of my hand It literally was like when something gets blown in the wind that you're hold on holding I Can't believe we did that. I was ready to go to delirium for the hell of it. Oh This is such a creepy credit Oh It's such a creepy credit, but oh my god, how did we do that? Flex missed the chaos card to prove that you didn't need it Honestly that run could not have gone any better Satanic Bible. I have to admit is fantastic You get unlimited health from it statistically when you find energies around the map you get unlimited health You get extra devil deal items on top of what you're doing. Anyway, I'm Satan and shambles literally Ed McMillan. I hope it's the next time And Ed McMuffin is currently working on a game called me eugenics Which I'm very excited for its release. Sadly. There was a bit of delay in development And due to a few issues and him adding on extra things and I will say that I've played Isaac I definitely feel and I have got my money's worth and From it yellow baby, wait, I'm not I actually unlocked something there Wait, did I not do mega Satan on? Who was it who's a plane on Eden? I didn't do mega. Wait, where the fuck is Eden Eden? There you are. Oh Wow, I never actually had the thing Is it over? Um, no, we're gonna do one very cheeky greed mode with Lilith and then yeah, we did it. We won though I've faith Isaac and super meat boy. We're both incredible. Yes, I believe you unlocked a court, baby Yeah, I can't believe we did that right. We're gonna do a little greed mode. I'm just gonna show you greed mode It's super simple to get the grass Bob. A lot of people don't seem to enjoy it. I for one enjoy it So I've got my little sookie bus, but look I have no eyeballs, so I can't cry if you didn't em know The attack in these games are about crying because poor Isaac is crying himself. Um, so this is a room It is a rectangular long rectangle. Um, they are going to be 10 phases You might notice that there that little 10 there that is saying what phase we're on There will be 10 fights in this room back to back to back to back There is a timer to tell you in the next comment. There's a locked door. There's an open room And we're going to get a range upgrade and a heart. We're going to hope Unfortunately, we did not get a soul or a necro heart. That's okay. 169 tokens exactly Now curious deep pockets, we're not probably gonna get anything like that. Oh anonymous Thank you so much for the tip. I'm glad you Enjoyed my victory royale literally flexing on them So in greed mode your only Opportunity to make money is via fights and that is the only way you can upgrade your stuff. Okay so Um, but there's a few hidden a few hidden differences. Okay a few hidden differences um, we can Bomb these Keepers here. These are passed away keepers Um, and we actually have a higher chance of getting things like keepers head for example or steam sail for example They have a high chance of dropping a cheeky quarter No, not quarter five cents um But yes, so we want to try and get a key which is five bucks to get into our room now Because we are lileth. We don't really want an active item at all. We like Look now we have two we have double the firepower because of that move So, uh, this can get out of hand very quickly. Thankfully lileth is the easiest to play In greed mode. I just kind of want to show you off. But as you see there's a timer um Those we enemies are doing their thing again. We are getting a active every time new enemies come in We're getting an active so now we have three firing power Um, we definitely want to clear enemies as fast as they come in because once you do not want overwhelmed on the map As soon as you get overwhelmed that's when your health takes a tank and it is very hard to try and Like it's expensive to try and roll for a soul heart for example Again, we now have four firing power. Please don't touch me. Please. Oh really don't want that really don't want that um Really don't want that but hey, oh it happened. We're gonna stay in we're gonna do what's called the boss fight Um, that was very unlucky though very unlucky. Um So these flies can shoot out. Sorry my fingers getting sore I actually should take a picture of my controller to show you how intensely I play Isaac So we have now completed Um phase eight. So there's like an optional kind of you know boss fight if you will Now the game. Oh, I shouldn't have popped that actually. That was very silly Because we needed it for the next floor, but that's on me making mistakes and it's okay. You're allowed to make mistakes in the game What is the enemy Oh, it's you guys you stinkers But yes, um, as you can see why it's easy on Lilith is you just Continually get more and more damage and as you get any sort of upgrade you get rewarded for it. Okay So Lilith is all about minions. Yeah, she is my favorite for greed mode because of The familiar help. I love games that have familiar help. So that purple guy is called lust I think if i'm remembering correctly, he will try to touch you. You need to try and juke him Yeah, you need to get rid of him quickly um But the good thing with uh, we're actually gonna try and get rid of the baby first because he runs around erratically Um, which is not good for us. Unfortunately. We have base speed I can't see the enemy. Okay, we're fine Now as much as I actually want to go for a devil deal I'm not interested in greed mode in a devil deal. Okay So unfortunately, we got absolutely nothing in here which sucks But hey, so we're gonna get a key And we're gonna see if we can get a bomb. Unfortunately, we don't have a bomb in this role So we are gonna get a key and see what's in our active room Our active room the purple guy Uh, we've actually got spawns a random pickup. So that's not bad at all And we're getting a lot of coins from the fires not bad at all indeed Um, I'm going to avoid the curse room because we do not have the goods now. I could do a tier rates up here It does seem a shame to miss out on it But i'm kind of needing a bomb for next round Oh Decisions decisions. This is the problem with greed mode All right. I'm against my my judgment. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna hope for a bomb Sadly no bomb Uh, I'm going to elect to keep my money for the next floor Um coat hanger pretty good. Yes. So now look how fast it is. Look at him go up here up here up here up here Yeah Yes, I always wait for a round with discounted item and try and do that. Yes. That is a very viable tactic Uh, sure Sure, why we don't even have eyes But sure now we can buy a key to instantly get access to that room to see what's going on Interesting another tears up Now we're gonna keep Hold on we're gonna use this key We're gonna buy two keys Okay, let me cook. Let me cook We're gonna unlock one of these to get a bomb because we need it for the angel fight. We're gonna do Uh, we're gonna bomb him Wow Wow Normally they almost always drop something we're gonna see what's in here I've got Bob's head using the iron and firing it throwing the head explodes where it lands Uh, we're gonna try and find the the secret. Oh no, I can't be in here. I can't be in here rubbish rubbish Well, we're just gonna eat it out of the wall. I guess I No, there you go Didn't get it didn't get it. Where'd the angel deal chance go? It only comes up after the boss fight So we're guaranteed an angel wait. I'm Lilith. Hold on Hold on a minute. I might not be guaranteed it like a dumbass. I'm Lilith. I'm evil I may have messed up slightly. I may have done a slight miscalculation Is it Lilith? Because I know Bethany gives you a higher angel So I Unfortunately used up the last Thing which I shouldn't have done. So we're actually down a little guy. Of course we have hosts Hosts can easily overrun your game easily. So we really want rid of them like ASAP. That's really bad for Whoa You couldn't have done that before we spent our monies Jeez, we got a golden key. That's such a shame At least we can get two bombs. Oh my god, our pickup is going wild Sorry, sorry. I'm getting too distracted Sorry What's going on down here? Definitely don't want them coming near us because we don't want any damage Oh my god. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh That's what I'm saying. You can get overwhelmed just like that. Whoa, wait our bag is multiplying I just noticed that like an idiot our bag is multiplying. What the heck? I didn't know the the pickup bag's multiplied. I was like, why are we getting so much good stuff? Whoa That's hilarious That is fun That oh dear Oh dear, we're now risky territory because if we go for the next ball. Oh, no. Oh, no Putta madre. Oh, it's widow What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you not coming over? Do you not jump? Whoa, what's going on? Creamy little spider you are aren't you? Spider girl confirmed for gin too absolutely No, um Okay, we are playing it very risky right now, but I do not want to leave the room So we're gonna we're gonna send it as the as the young one where the heck is the enemy It's worms. It's wiggly worms and I completely missed all the damage against them We got bombs though Okay We're really playing at risk Okay We're gonna bomb this angel. I don't think we can actually bomb it We've not got enough health. We actually can't bomb the angel to increase our angel deal It's okay A worm confirmed for gen two actually for real for real though A little wiggly worm that comes out of the ground and she has an obsession with your prostate She just wants to poke it. She's like, I just want to poke it Well, do it no ball. I I certainly do not have any balls. I assure you I shite bag if you didn't I actually I'm a shite bag right Now we have a golden key so we can take these bombs for free And we got penny back. We need to be very careful in between those spikes now Because we have treasure box conjoined is just insane The insanity of conjoined goes crazy. So I am going to buy this Because it gets out of hand so quickly. Oh my god. They look like little diamond Uh little diamond thingies um As much as getting a bone heart would be all right for going in and out the curse room We actually don't have the money No, we don't I mean we could Now they have a higher payout rate I mean we got five bombs for it. Sheesh I'll take it. Uh, right as for where this hidden room is it's either in the curse room or it's right here Yeah, the odds of it being here is pretty high Decrease spawn rate of all hearts to 20 percent all black all hearts turn into black hearts Increase the drop chance the keys. I even do anything. I think we'll just do lunch I doubt I don't think that does anything in greed mode. Uh greed mode does negate a lot of different things. Um But that's not here not there. Are all the beggars refillings. I'm seeing them really like in mummy I know they've been so kind in greed mode. The rate goes up exponentially now This is just a small thing you can do but you can actually bomb these It will reroll but you can also get money back. So we've actually just been given the chance for damage And we might spawn a Yara rune No, this sprinkler this sprinkler is so good Oh wait, but we're lily so we don't need the sprinkler. It's fine. Right. We have a shard rune We are going to use it on a gemmed tailstone for the chance to do uh What the fuck did that do What did that do? Oh, it made something cheaper in the shop. Oh, I should have saved it for the next floor I was hoping we were going to get a crawl space and it was going to have an item inside for us, but it's Okay, right. We have no money, but we have bombs and we have two Familiar well, we technically only have one for conjoined It would affect the drops of your mystery bag Okay, so we now have oh, no Oh, it hurts I Mean dumb dumb I forgot we had pain Pain damage multiplier full health pain Too measly pain Now we are actually gonna be It forced a bomb these to try and get a freaking hit And I bet you if I had money it wouldn't be that Exactly. Ah, that's right Unfortunately, we are kind of getting a bit uh needing A few things now. I'm going to hope my multiplied drops are going to do something Okay spawns a devil burger. Um One more for the gentleman in the back And nothing. Wow, we we're having it rough out here. Let's hope there's something of Um We now Do not have to aim. I repeat for those of you who do not know what homing spoon is. We do not have to aim Let's Go We just need to do a rooty mick tootie in any direction talk about streamer luck We do not need to aim the game will do it all for us. Oh, I love being a strummer I just took health damage. Why is there a blinking light bulb? What is that? What whoa, that's that's a lot of enemies. You're putting my money everywhere Oh my god, we got a dame as well, which is 10 cents. Are we going eternal heart? Oh, I don't I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet Holy moly. Look at all of this goodness Holy moly I'm gonna mow this one down because they're not very nice to go against And then again Here we go Whoa, we're getting like special attacks as well now. They do throw bombs. He does throw bombs. So don't don't be too Okay, one more one more don't take any oh he's it's a poop He's a wee poopy thing I don't know what's going on down there. It's chaos, but we're we're spraying and praying boys Okay, we're spraying and praying. Okay. We've got a devil deal and we have no health to take it So we are not taking it. We're gonna take the eternal heart, which is fantastic We're gonna explore and see if there's anything in the room below Other than enemies got a lot of enemies. So we don't even have to aim Um, we could bomba like this Are you joking me? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, that one's fucking cute. All right, what's going on in here? Uh, right, we have a card spawns dev. Well, I can't even utilize your bro Again, these items are Rubbage a chest and a chest class the guys like right fuck it I I want to hold money and okay. Okay. That's better App absolutely freaking pranked. I like come on Come on right Okay, we now have mother transformation. So we now have mom's homing knife. Wait, how does that even work? It's gonna like home to them when they come to me Now we are gonna try for secret room here Didn't get it, but that's okay Did get three coins now we can go to the angel I'm just gonna check I picked up the items in the treasure rooms because I forget to do it a lot It makes the knife powerful. We got mercy. Oh my god mercy for real for real. Okay, we have mercy Um, did we get a zero? Maybe immaculate conception is a zero technically Uh, right we go next wait, hold on We can bomb for a potential discounted item And get some coins. Oh a money back coins back. Holy crap. I'm so sorry. I stopped talking there and get some coins back Hold hold it mullet right. We're gonna pick this up because that's damage Um, oh god, that's damage again Some what I know I don't know how us if I go into the angel deal it's gonna charge me 30 for something good though Am I gonna be raging if right? No, I'm gonna be raging if I pass up on something Oh god, the discount's so good though Right Uh range nah, it's fine. Right. We don't need anything. Oh do we need the soul heart? No, we need 15 bucks for the angel to see what's inside Wasn't it only 15 it was discounted, but I don't know if it's 30 for the full Yeah, ah prism actually is fantastic with how much really make tooting and shooting we do Um Oh like it's long shield the trinity shield Oh, no, we just gave her money to the beggar I Wasn't paying attention. I was like, oh it's links feel Uh, I might beat this angel up actually to try and increase my angel Oh my gosh, did you see that though? Okay, sorry, I need to try hard. I really don't want to take any damage because we do not have much for for free Stop spawning in those guys, please. I can't deal with you all right there We have no increased angel chance when we do our boss fight Goodbye bean. We do not need you And okay damage again again seven damage We're getting there right what we got what we looking at What we looking at analizing the room that's looking good Good for the most part For the most part, but yeah that uh trapeze trapeze Uh the prism that we got that album from that one band. I completely forgot the name of it Again like the I don't want to pay money to roll these I'd rather just blow up the donation machine and spend it on angels honestly, right so we are going to pop Pop lock and drop it by uh Doing that so now we already have two prisms It oh god, I hate the eyes so much They like laser beam attack and you have like zero time to respond. It's so annoying But with how many Drops we might be getting I hate the ones on the wall as well. Oh and the ghosts as well. You know what? I just I just struggle with a lot of isic enemies. You know what? I'll admit my weak points I'm just bad at the game. I just get very lucky with my drops But yes as you oh my god, lunch it was a two percent drop for lunch No way it was a two percent drop for lunch. Can you can you come out already? Geez you are hiding bro You're quivering Is he for real? Is he the only enemy in the room? Ah, right? Okay Uh two percent Bro the streamer luck. Sorry. I've never had such good isic. I wonder I've not played the game in like over a month Is it possible the game like detects? Fuuuuck you know is it possible the game can detect have not played in a while and is like uh Game odds make this person addicted to isic again I don't know if that's a thing. I mean it could be if you wanted it to be Oh my god the homing Oh Not those homing bombs the other kind of hoping Ah just Do you see the bottom stat that says 66 Angel and we and we get devil grove. I'm not risking my health. Sorry. I'm not I'm not risking my health Right, we've got a golden key, which means we get a free pair Yeah If this drops yara rune it is over If this drops yara rune it is over yara duplicates all items that are on the floor I'm going to pop temperance as well. I'm going to use that on this floor It it is over I'm going to pop temperance uh on purpose. I'm going to pop it inside the shop. I'm right Right I'm gonna pick that up. I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna tap down to two No, no pay out. Are you not feeling it buddy? Come on I'm so mommy What is this flight for the room? Okay curious curious don't need it but curious nonetheless Oh What is going on? What is going on we now have counterfeit penny which every time we pick up one coin we have a chance to double it What is can the game detect I've not played in a while because what wait why What What are you got for me troll bombs? No, thank you Uh, maybe a crawl space We just broke something. I heard that Did we break something? Um, it's gonna be worth their money. I'm not gonna put it down any further There we go black. Yeah.

Um, but hey hope Right, we've got a maculic conception and now we will leave. Thank you Now we can go straight into here We may get conjoined Oh my god, just say you love me game Just say you personally love me. It's fine.

Uh, I'm getting extremely lucky to the point where my chair is wet This is just by far insane Streamer luck that you're seeing in 4k Um, it is beyond comprehension How insane I'm gonna purposely try not pick anything up because if we drop a yara rune I see skinny runes being dropped. I'm asking politely for a yara rune. I don't spot one I don't spot a yara I don't spot one Maybe next time maybe next time maybe next time Okay Okay, one more fight one more fight.

Well, I am Don't mind if I do Talk about streamer luck. Holy moly A bit of streamer luck don't mind if I do. Uh, I'm probably not actually oh my god. Oh My yeah We oh, we have so much we have so much we need to go spend Please right. We don't need range. We don't need that. Let's do what we're not going to do chaos We're not going to do that either. Jeez. Uh, I mean an orbital for defense really isn't that bad. We can swallow trinkets Is that no am I done I did I buy the wrong thing possibly We could buy a card pack and the chance that we get two Times two money on hand doubles my bombs Yes, please I will make sure I have 50 in my inventory. Thank you. Oh my god. What is going on? What is going on actually hacks right now? I'm not being funny, but actually hacks Uh Attracts coins. No, I don't need that range No, we don't need range We'll take any of this stuff More damage for me Oh, you shouldn't have game. You're so nice to me Do it again and keep doing it.

Oh my god Uh, I don't want black hole the one that let's try and I oh Oops, I can't get the angel angel deal now. Oh well The bells of heaven are ringing What the fuck is this dreamer look every time we now activate we double or we double on uh like on top like brov brov What is going on? Right, we have bombs. We're gonna bomb the machine. Hopefully we can get a fiverr back. Uh, I doubt it, but hey ho You never know We got our penny back Um, right. We're good to go. We've got counterfeit penny Life is good and we have freaking yara I'm making sure to avoid that with all my life And I definitely picked up the items from the room because I forget all the time to pick up the items But I'm just making double sure right, okay This is rng the greatest rng to ever rng. Yes again the room code for this greed is alpha hotel alpha alpha 3 juliet 2 tango Okay, we're taking yara to the night floor And before another yara, okay, this is now the last ah sugar I should have Oh, that would have actually been a bit juicy. I have to admit it's a damage up. Um, like it is what it is It is what it is Uh judgment.

Maybe bomb these guys see what's up And this was a What does 19 do Taking damage as a span chance to spawn something not really fuss for that. Uh, we will cycle to the next just to see what's up We might be able to get a spun duplicate two random pickups in the room Curious Uh, right yara. We do not want to pick up anything. Is this run even a challenge? No And that's the best part about isaac when you break the game Because the game wants you to suffer the game wants you to cry and give up So when you break the game because of how kind it's been. Oh, wow, we're unlocking super meat boy I didn't realize you do that that laughter meant there's a hand going to come down Yeah, like that. I'm trying not to pick up anything. I really am I'm trying got out something got me. I don't know what got me I'm Again with the hands. Hold on.

Wow Oh, wowie we wow Revelation right gently easy easy Okay, duplicate everything and then we're going to look to see if there's an extra era just for the Unlucky we've got full health on the sun. So let's pop that And then we're going to grab oh the sun again Of course, it was going to be the sun again because we uh did a thing called duplication. You dumb dumb Roon shard. What did that do? Roon shard Okay, we're gonna just do a little investigation on our our wares or trinkets Unlucky room full ago. I know I guess there is another era though Okay, let's go spend some of this goodness. We're gonna go to short speed We don't really need luck although that gives us a soul heart and Oh, no, I'm already full. Okay, let's spin. Wait, there might be a secret here No, it must be down Uh, we don't really need any of this Can we duplicate spider baby? That would be cute. Oh sure. Oh wait. No, that was silly. Okay taking damage of this goods Sponsor sack. I mean we're at the end of the game anyway. We don't really need it Yeah, let's see what else we've got. We've got fun guy I mean, what's underneath fun guy? We won. Oh, we got spun. We got spun feels good, man Okay, let's uh Wait, didn't I not bomb that or am I going crazy? This is why Lilith is so broken in greed mode honestly so Are you fucking serious right now, right? Anyway, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine I'm not mad I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Okay. I'm not mad. I'm not raging. I'm not absolutely raging I didn't even know the runes could do that to be honest. Oh home in tears as if I need it as if I need it Right, I'll pick it up already. I mean I can Yara this room room, I guess Yara Give me my pennies right What can we can buy four more items as long as the restock machine? We don't need health now As long as this doesn't blow up What? Okay, my only exception of going in here is for yeah, oh first wrong one. Oh, that's a bomb Oh, we got gupsters Oh, we got one gupsters Yeah And then we go pick up immaculate conception again Active item can be overcharged if only you showed up a bit earlier right we'll take halo. That's a massive upgrade. Um I mean, we've only got enough money for two more Range on tapeworm. Why would the tapeworm give you range? Honestly, and then just bomb it because we've not got enough for anything else Uh, oh, that's a shame. Uh, that's rubbish. Right. Uh, let's let's go Um full health. We'll take it just in case but I'm not really too worried and as we take damage We actually can spawn in more of the goodness So we got guppy a wee bit of guppy, but that's fine Now she finds sacred heart discounted to Oh, literally Oh, wait, there's another level to this Oh rubbish Wait, how did you predict that? I would get sacred heart spawned in again That the game literally said I'll be nice to you. That's funny though. It's okay though. Oh, there Are sure the judgment why not? Can't really do anything else with more money. So here you go buddy. All yours I only have 15 coins. Don't be greedy now I have the stars. Yeah, I'm not sure the Hey, I only I only have three coins judgment. You're supposed to have an increased drop rate. Yeah, okay Well, it is what it is Okay, now there's normally we enemy in here. I'm not gonna pop my active for this room. That's just not worthy at all Um Can bomb the I mean it doesn't really do anything at this point It's just the instant like Uh I don't know Now we can purposely hurt ourselves To get because we have nuns habit If we purposely hurt ourselves, we can get charged and then that's another Like batch of guys in to do damage. This is ridiculous But as you can see, um Lilith is a wee bit broken in greed mode. We literally aren't even fighting. He's not even near us And we're just mowing this poor guy down Like We're not even We no wild card necessary in this run Oh my god, and we're dropping charges. We might actually get another um Chart if someone drops the chart, uh, you we could get another go out. I mean, it's done for honestly It's done for He he he But yeah, that is greed mode And I'm just pop it again so we can have another duplicate of everyone look at my gang Look at my gang. My gang is amazing. This I've already done 99 20% jam rate as you can see I enjoy playing Lilith a lot in greed mode because you see the 20 percent jam rate That means that machine is all fed by her and no one else Um, that was a bad jam rate. But yes, that is greed mode. That is Isaac is a fantastic game I cannot praise it enough. Um You will lose so many hours in this. Why no phase two. We were not playing greedier mode Greedier mode is a lot different than greed mode. I am not that strong in Greedier mode Oh, you remember that um That was complete streamer Um rng complete streamer rng. That was insane. Um I cannot believe that. I truly cannot believe that. Well, you play Isaac more and I mean in other streams. Yes in november I'll be playing it with you Um But yes, this game has like an insane amount of items Like in com in combinations you can do and as you can see an elite gamer like myself Still hasn't unlocked everything yet. Look, I've still not unlocked everything and I have like hundreds of hours in this game Um, but yeah, there's like look see look tons of stuff. I haven't unlocked Eh, there's so all these items you unlock by playing the game I How fast it's doable to I'm not even fighting him absolute Chad menace But yeah, as you can see a lot on the the last stuff not unlocked Bloody guts Lusty blood Does he fuck? Fuck his ass But yeah, um Absolutely fantastic game. Uh, you know make or break your run come. It's it's Insanity the game started with, um Ignore the death counter Ignore the best street counter while you're at it as well um It's just I cannot praise the game enough. Um You know, there's tons of endings in the game Well, I'll show you the true ending That makes me very sad, but this is a true ending His mother mourning the loss He saw his father leaving them without turning to say goodbye He saw his mother sleeping and his father taking money from her purse He heard the late night fights they had that kept him up at night and the guilt He felt for what he believed he was causing He felt the pain in his stomach during those sleepless nights And saw his shadow in the closet waiting for him As he rose he felt his fears drop I cried so hard the first time as he became lighter his ascent became faster He saw his one true companion alive He saw his mother and father together again holding each other He felt his mother kissing him on the head after he had said his prayers And the comfort in knowing someone was watching over him He saw his own birth and the faces of his parents filled with joy and optimism And then He saw nothing Are you sure this is how you want this story to end Isaac? You're the one writing it. It doesn't have to end this way Here How about we tell it a different way? Maybe a happy ending Good Are you getting sleepy yet? Yeah Okay, so Isaac and his parents lived in a small house and that's the start of the that's the opening of the game So that ending a lot of people misinterpret it a certain way But Ed McMuffin has confirmed multiple times that yes, Isaac dies in the chest. He is a dead five-year-old in a chest The ending people couldn't make heads or tails of because that male voice Male on stream and that male voice you hear is his dad annunciate in the game. Okay But the reason I want to point it out to you is because Isaac has been You know, he's got religious trauma. So he's being told If i'm a good boy, I go to heaven all my fears go away So as he's in his final moments as he slips away In his head after defeating all these enemies these endless waves of bosses. He's done everything he possibly could he feels the fear and The guilt just melt off his body as he finally slips And passes away inside the chest. He can see that third perspective of his mum finding him He can see that third perspective of him watching over because um In the male in the dad's voice he goes Are you sure you want this story to end this way Isaac and Isaac says? Yes. I want it to be over I want it to be why did you show us this because people can't figure out what the ending means and i'm gonna mention it I'm gonna mention it in my little review and be like, why is this open to interpretation? It's very clear If if Ed McMuffin goes Isaac perishes Everyone's like oh, but the fight the fight. He's away in heaven. No Isaac perished. He's been taught about heaven This entire game is about being taught religion dogma all this stuff he Thinks he's going to heaven in his last moments He feels no guilt because he's done everything this entire thing is in his head. He is in a chest Adroni, Adroni explains the Bible Sorry, I'm like clapping me hands. I'm like, who do she wants this to be to breath right delirium ending is that ending 21? 19 is delirium No, this is the mother fight in 20 So Is this still this isn't delirium Are you sure these three are hand clapping Why are you just drawing the game for me close the game's been out for 10 years? It's the 10 year anniversary this year. Do don't come here being like you're running the game 10 years this game's been out for You're not coming to me being like no you've given me spoilers. No, I'm not having that 10 years you've had a you've had a deck aid A deck aid So this is what happens dies. This is his wee body He's no longer missing because we found him You haven't finished a single run in this game that's different I was five seconds from getting this ending now it's ruined. Yeah. Well, you know what else is ruined open your mouth I'm gonna fart in it Now your taste buds are ruined I Can't believe strong we just spoiled the game like that a game that's been out for a decade Yes, um, I am going to absolutely go ham reviewing this game.
