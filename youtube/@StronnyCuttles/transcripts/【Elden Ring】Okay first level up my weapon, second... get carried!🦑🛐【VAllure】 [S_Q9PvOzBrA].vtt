WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.760
I've done something, I've done something I shouldn't have done, okay, oh shit, I should

00:21.760 --> 00:28.480
have shot them, sorry, I'm going to be in a game, I'm going to hit the frat one thing

00:28.880 --> 00:32.240
and I've just gone off of it, like a dumb boom

00:35.600 --> 00:39.440
okay, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it

00:39.440 --> 00:47.600
good morning, good evening, good afternoon, my name is Dronecuddles and I'm here to try and

00:47.600 --> 00:54.240
entertain you to the best of my ability, all things considered, um, I may or may not have

00:54.560 --> 01:01.600
only had four hours of sleep because I have issues sleeping at the moment, okay, there's a bit

01:01.600 --> 01:14.560
of a swap today, um, I do not have an intention today of streaming 12 hours, oh what, it's not

01:14.560 --> 01:20.960
sustainable if you can't get sleep, oh well, now that I've learned that, yeah, actually you're kind

01:20.960 --> 01:29.120
of right, reeflings, oh no, uh, you actually need to unironically, apartment a bed, um,

01:30.800 --> 01:38.320
I did not get much sleep, so I have decided instead of doing endurance, kind of, you know, fly

01:38.320 --> 01:45.040
through the DLC, I would very much like to get the coconuts with you, so I've able to source

01:45.040 --> 01:50.560
where the, um, the coconuts, which is, hello, please help, thank you, wonderful, apologies,

01:50.560 --> 01:56.160
you're beautiful, let's go, and my beloved, I cannot source the location of the DLC Pratt,

01:56.160 --> 02:03.200
they're called Prattles, I believe, no, they're called a Prattling Patez, but we all know it's a

02:03.200 --> 02:11.680
coconut, let's be honest, why no sleep, uh, look on what's been uploaded, that's why no sleep,

02:11.680 --> 02:16.560
I started working on another audio, and I've an announcement, Patreon is getting fed the

02:16.560 --> 02:27.840
moment I go offline, uh, my plot is pit, job, my armpit, the plot is my armpit, okay, and then

02:27.840 --> 02:33.840
we're writing the fourth plot live so you guys can literally see how, like, the script, and then

02:33.840 --> 02:38.560
you'll hear the finished edit, like, result type thing, but, uh, yeah, for some reason, I picked

02:38.880 --> 02:45.840
armpit, I can't even remember what you even said in the script, but, um, you got to sleep and drop

02:45.840 --> 02:53.520
the bread for, I'm still a biohazard at the moment as well, um, all I produced was a singular little,

02:54.560 --> 03:03.600
you know, one could argue it was the size of a gold nugget, um, but I would very much like to do

03:03.680 --> 03:09.040
the crack, crack, the prattling coconut, sorry, my brain isn't here, I'm, I do apologize, let's

03:09.040 --> 03:14.160
have four hours, I was like, I'm doing stuff, I'm currently waiting on a fucking contract, um,

03:15.200 --> 03:22.000
from a bloody company, so I've got the girl's good news, and they're just, they're fucking

03:22.000 --> 03:27.120
being at all their sweet time, like, they're in no rush to seal the deal, whereas I'm like, this is

03:27.120 --> 03:34.880
an, wait, what, my mouse and my, oh, okay, my, uh, like, this is a big deal for the girls,

03:34.880 --> 03:40.480
because it's yet another revenue income, so, blah, blah, blah, I know, boring, boring, boring,

03:40.480 --> 03:44.800
business, business, business, that's what it's like behind the scenes, it's all boring, boring,

03:44.800 --> 03:55.520
boring, business, business, business, okay, located in Stormfoot Catacombs, which is in the cliff

03:55.520 --> 04:04.480
side, northwest of the church of Ella, why is my cursor, is the church down here, yeah, okay,

04:04.480 --> 04:08.720
the first coconut is to the left, of course you guys are more than welcome to stream snap, let's

04:08.720 --> 04:13.760
be honest, oh, maybe I should change the name of the stream, people are gonna be like, oh, I'm

04:13.760 --> 04:21.840
leveling up the L3, so I can play with her, okay, hold on, let me get my pizza, but yes, it's gonna

04:21.840 --> 04:30.240
be a two hour stream, I have a collab tomorrow as well with Yumi Plus, and hold on, I'm gonna do a

04:30.240 --> 04:38.320
coconut little, little coconut gathering, and I'm gonna like do it in green, because we are harvesting,

04:38.320 --> 04:55.200
like real farmers, I'm literally just gonna be doing nice and easy today, two hours, I'm redirected

04:55.200 --> 05:04.720
into Shibi, she's doing a drawing stream, because Shibi has some doodling art, I'm pretty sure,

05:04.720 --> 05:09.840
just show me her art, am I going first? No, I don't think she showed me her art in an interview,

05:09.840 --> 05:15.760
but she does, she's able to do stuff, can we have the three reflands on a beach with coconut trees,

05:21.760 --> 05:29.760
okay, the first, hello, prattling, no, we're gonna try and do that, if we've got enough time,

05:29.840 --> 05:35.200
obviously, I think we may or may not blast through these catacombs, but as long as we've all got the

05:35.200 --> 05:43.600
same coconut, that's amazing, I had something to tell you that was exciting, out of the ASMR

05:43.600 --> 05:49.920
collab, and I've already forgotten, hello, yes, that's the one we're going for, okay, we need to

05:50.560 --> 05:57.120
locate it at Stormford Catacombs, which is the closest just north west of the church, we are

05:57.120 --> 06:03.200
going to take that very literally, and just jump over here and look for a cavern this way, I can't

06:03.200 --> 06:07.680
jump, okay, sorry, okay, hold on, I need to go around, sorry, that's embarrassing, I can't make that

06:07.680 --> 06:18.000
jump, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, right, north west, oh, we have our head and we've got a beacon,

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
the ASMR collab was really good, I loved it, it's not putting much, it's so early, it's too strong,

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
bro, it's literally my favorite, oh, are these guys that tell you where the Prattland coconut's at?

06:33.440 --> 06:39.520
Can we get down here safely? I'm not sure about, wait, that was a bird, I thought it was a reefland

06:39.520 --> 06:42.640
that just launched themselves, I'm like, ain't not a bit early to be launching ourselves off a

06:42.640 --> 06:53.040
cliff first thing in the morning, and I believe AC had concluded an ASMR stream today, I love how

06:53.040 --> 06:57.360
you guys literally like the beacons that go on door, I'm just following, I'm like okay, I'm here

06:57.360 --> 07:11.200
for war, what's going on? I have good news and bad news, bad news, Emmy's away on holiday, good news

07:11.200 --> 07:18.160
is I can edit Emmy and AC's collab together, because I've got all the pieces of the Puzzlemer,

07:18.800 --> 07:22.960
wow, okay, we're here, we're here, oh no, I'm gonna have to resummon you all,

07:22.960 --> 07:27.440
wait, that doesn't count, wait, okay, maybe I need to be a big girl and travel on my own,

07:27.440 --> 07:31.760
and then summon inside the cavern, literally clapping like yeah, we have to go already,

07:31.760 --> 07:39.440
you literally just got in, Emmy gone for two, now there is content for Emmy, I've got plans

07:39.440 --> 07:44.000
that there's gonna be like something every three days, at least whether that's a short,

07:44.560 --> 07:50.480
look how dark inside it gets when my refunds leave, I hear it here, okay, so there's a

07:50.480 --> 08:03.920
prattling coconut in here, just summon a singular gate, oh is there a hit 5k, that's fantastic,

08:03.920 --> 08:10.480
I think AC's literally about to do it around the corner, oh no, this can't be, wait, can I not hire

08:10.480 --> 08:22.640
you guys, hire, I really hope this next game has seamless co-op, if only, that's asking for too

08:22.640 --> 08:28.480
much, hold on a minute, that's asking for a bit too much, you mean you want help to play your

08:28.480 --> 08:37.680
FromSoft game, hmm, no, unlikely, you're not allowed to, you will be given 20% less damage,

08:37.760 --> 08:40.960
boss gets 20% more, and you're freaking healing flasks to nothing,

08:44.320 --> 08:51.120
when do we expect the collab, so some, if you want to know the behind the scenes,

08:52.080 --> 08:56.240
oh fuck, that's what I need you guys for, holy shit, how could I forget,

08:57.040 --> 09:03.520
reeflings, all we need holders rise up, there's been a bit of an update

09:03.840 --> 09:11.040
that may or may not shape what happens with gen 2, but what happens in here stays in here,

09:11.040 --> 09:17.040
did I make myself clear, you guys have done fantastic, I'm pretty sure no one's done anything major,

09:20.800 --> 09:32.800
I need, I need influence, I need interest and I need descriptions, I need attributes of some

09:33.840 --> 09:40.400
milf body type and a lollipop body type, I need some sort of influence, there's been a bit of

09:40.400 --> 09:49.840
development, and two designs have been rejected in both categories, and I'm needing to start somewhere

09:49.840 --> 10:00.320
fresh, now I did think harpy, harpy with a knee hands and wings instead, which is a bit advanced

10:00.320 --> 10:04.240
for a modler to be honest, she'd probably end up being the most expensive to rejuice,

10:07.360 --> 10:14.560
I snapped her attention at reeflings, dragon, oh that's right, sorry, dragon and then the color scheme

10:14.560 --> 10:22.320
was based after the big dragon and avatar, she's definitely like possessive,

10:22.640 --> 10:33.760
and calls fan base her treasures possibly, that's a good one, I wrote that down, yeah remember

10:33.760 --> 10:40.320
that, okay, we're also consider a harpy, maybe she's egg obsessed, I'm actually kind of down with

10:40.560 --> 10:51.920
an egg obsessed lollipop harpy, maybe she would call her fan base like, oh what would you, egg,

10:51.920 --> 10:59.760
eggie, maybe call them, how about a female knight in armor, see the major thing about armor is the

10:59.760 --> 11:04.400
pride, is can no one, can I not summon in here, sorry, can I not summon in here, hold on a minute,

11:04.400 --> 11:10.000
I ain't laughing no more, no one's summonable, nestlings, hatchlings, yeah that kind of thing,

11:10.560 --> 11:19.760
maybe we can kind of go the eggbound route, hatchling, right so we've got dragon and harpy

11:19.760 --> 11:25.840
for a little bit more body type, so they don't have an interest in a lollipop cheerleader,

11:26.160 --> 11:35.520
number one, bimbo lollipop cheerleader or bimbo milk cheerleader,

11:43.280 --> 11:48.400
so bimbo cheerleader and then I'm going to put candy roll from kung fu keel,

11:49.120 --> 12:02.080
did you activate the summoning, oh did I nullify it, oh I nullified it, sorry,

12:02.080 --> 12:06.640
wait I heard that, oh no no no, okay there we go, right, oh no,

12:07.520 --> 12:11.200
um alamia milk,

12:14.080 --> 12:21.920
rushing under the gate, um alamia milk, come on, let me, we need pointed side ears,

12:21.920 --> 12:26.240
I'm going to put that there and line me up for a mouth, because I like the pointed side ears and

12:26.240 --> 12:33.680
I like the, you know the teeth and you know how it goes, like alamia milk, technical related,

12:33.680 --> 12:40.240
I think the odds are I may or may not be getting some sort of technical alternative of the future,

12:40.240 --> 12:44.080
if you want a bimbo cheerleader, um look at Nike,

12:47.200 --> 12:56.240
and a harpy milk, actually you're fucking right, everyone goes harpy we won, but no one goes harpy

12:56.240 --> 13:04.960
big yin, you're actually right, harpy milk, like and she would be clumsy, she'd be calling,

13:04.960 --> 13:14.080
she'd be clumsy, harpy milk, hmm and then maybe her stick can be, she's always egg burning,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.360
you need to help her lay eggs, like a freak, so then there's people on a birth, yeah you're

13:19.360 --> 13:24.640
fucking welcome, I even consider you, you're welcome, okay let's see what the deal is,

13:29.040 --> 13:30.880
whoa, okay we're going swinging,

13:34.240 --> 13:38.800
yeah yeah yeah, I'm here to entertain all, don't say, don't say I don't feed you well over here,

13:39.600 --> 13:45.280
when any other agency would reject you, they hated him, they hated her, because she spoke

13:45.280 --> 13:50.960
the truth about the value of it, having true diversity, when it comes to an array of um,

13:51.600 --> 13:57.920
alternative content, it's funny just because you're vanilla, or you shouldn't, wait,

13:57.920 --> 14:02.080
did you not watch the membership stream, oh crap hold on,

14:05.920 --> 14:07.280
okay thank god I'm one shotting,

14:07.280 --> 14:16.080
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, wow why is there so much fire,

14:19.840 --> 14:20.960
oh yeah I'm back here,

14:25.920 --> 14:30.960
oh we already did it, oh okay that one went by very quickly, right we'll finish the dungeon though,

14:30.960 --> 14:35.440
we'll finish the dungeon though, um okay that was a lot quicker than I thought, obviously because

14:35.440 --> 14:41.760
we're like mega overpowered here, and the reflins are doing it all for us, oh there's one more,

14:45.200 --> 14:52.400
uh strone, it's because if only you knew, oh no, oh no this can't be,

14:53.280 --> 14:56.320
uh right is anyone got any milf suggestions that I can work on,

14:57.520 --> 14:59.920
uh I think I'm gonna see if I can get that dragon,

15:00.880 --> 15:06.480
out of all, I'm feeling the dragon the most on the missing section,

15:07.760 --> 15:13.040
what you're completely leaking any development plans, nope that's not how it works, it's not how

15:13.040 --> 15:21.120

21:58.400 --> 22:05.840
have to be, oh I just spawned them in game, I just spawned them in, get me my reflings back,

22:05.840 --> 22:11.360
right now I'm too scared for one more, even though I'm like super level, like I'm, I think I'm

22:11.360 --> 22:18.800
exponentially leveled up right now, a southern bell milf, I see that, the problem with those

22:18.800 --> 22:23.600
kind of things is you'd need someone to fill the role and I have to admit we were playing it very

22:23.600 --> 22:32.800
risky having a zeroes design created, because someone has to fill a role and if you're looking for

22:32.800 --> 22:40.880
like a southern sweetheart actor, oh it's my cherry pie, oh my cherry pie, like and then you

22:40.880 --> 22:48.640
then you get a cherry pie that applies, it's like oh you're up shit for me, dark elf milf, I'd even

22:48.640 --> 23:06.240
fill the role for you, have I, I'd actually, I think this, dark elf milf, what's her angle,

23:08.320 --> 23:13.280
will you need me to give me more, what's the dark elf angle other, other than she looks fucking,

23:13.840 --> 23:16.480
I want to rub oil all over her and lick it off manually,

23:19.200 --> 23:24.000
okay do you know where to go, I actually don't know where to go, sorry let me check it out,

23:24.000 --> 23:29.200
located in the impaler's catacomb, right, impaler's catacomb, okay I've definitely not

23:29.200 --> 23:34.640
discovered what the heck it is then, do you know where to take me, do you have impaler's catacomb on

23:34.640 --> 23:45.680
your side, a self, what about a lollipop dragon, I am going to submit, no I just got you here,

23:45.680 --> 23:52.560
why is everything fucking hiding from me, I'm so sorry every fling, right okay I'll stop calling

23:52.560 --> 23:56.960
everyone in until I actually get to location, because I keep messing up, thank you, I keep

23:56.960 --> 24:07.040
messing up, excuse me, what did he say, okay I hope that's like a, how do you call it, right

24:07.040 --> 24:18.800
there's something up here, something up here, okay I'm super overleveled, I'm super overleveled,

24:18.800 --> 24:24.720
I don't need to be scared, I am super overleveled, I do not need to be scared,

24:24.720 --> 24:34.400
the reeflings are gonna help me and then I'll be prepared, oh Mr. Reefling, hold my hand,

24:34.400 --> 24:42.800
bum bum bum bum, I hope you don't mind my sweaty fucking hands, bum bum bum bum, they don't stop

24:42.800 --> 24:49.360
sweating, it's kinda embarrassing, you can actually get both hooks in your hands if it's a bed,

24:49.600 --> 25:00.000
bum bum bum bum, if you did an angler fish, literally hook, line and sinker on our forehead

25:00.000 --> 25:05.680
would be quite a funny moat, have I got you yet, hook, line and sinker,

25:08.480 --> 25:13.200
that's what the moat or the angler fish would be, where the fuck am I going,

25:14.160 --> 25:18.480
wait I think I've actually downly discovered it, hold on wait guys I'm getting on my memory,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.760
I'm getting on my memory, have I been here before, well I've not been here in this game,

25:24.800 --> 25:28.960
surely my rawtism your honor, oh my god I'm actually so smart, I'm actually so smart,

25:28.960 --> 25:34.720
I've been a whole freaking year, get me in here, okay if you technically make a, if you technically

25:34.720 --> 25:40.160
make a velar girl you can link your stories because also a hard piece thing to make fishermen think,

25:41.120 --> 25:47.920
no I do not like, I fucking, do not, hold on let me finish this,

25:51.520 --> 25:58.160
um I, wait why would it be nullified, there's someone here, well Jen too,

25:58.160 --> 26:03.520
have someone who's good at singing, actually some of the girls are looking to develop,

26:04.160 --> 26:13.680
they're, they're singing, geez reefland, um I, I'm not going to specifically hire someone just

26:13.680 --> 26:19.280
because they can sing because at the end of the day you gotta be a drummer and you gotta be able

26:19.280 --> 26:25.120
to give us the notes while you, oh you know when you have your little firework at the end of the day

26:25.120 --> 26:31.280
um that's where we need the, the pipes to come in, that's when we need the pipes to come in so

26:31.280 --> 26:34.720
you know just because you can sing it doesn't mean you're getting in, you know what I'm saying, like

26:35.360 --> 26:41.120
yeah, yeah I mean it's cool and all but like, now the, now what would be interesting is if you

26:41.120 --> 26:48.800
know how to do parody songs and shit, that is different, it's, wow, oh I missed, I missed that

26:48.800 --> 26:55.440
so embarrassed, okay we're super leveled up, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, we're super leveled up,

26:56.240 --> 27:03.040
um yes if someone applied then they're like hey I do like parodies, I know how to write them, I

27:03.040 --> 27:09.760
know how to edit them, then that is a very big asset um because not only could I help promote

27:09.760 --> 27:15.680
them like their own content, like I can put like money into their parodies, I can put money into

27:15.680 --> 27:19.680
like whatever they do type thing so it's really good like a different advertising type thing for

27:19.680 --> 27:24.560
them whereas like if you're like yeah I can sing but I actually don't know how to like

27:24.560 --> 27:28.080
make parodies in it or that kind of thing, that's like oh well you can do song covers,

27:28.080 --> 27:32.480
don't get me wrong, that's good and all but it's quite valuable being able to kind of

27:33.120 --> 27:40.640
have more of a skill set beyond I can sing, is that, I don't, oh no are we in trouble,

27:41.280 --> 27:53.520
we're playing, we're playing, I wasn't prepared, what do we do, we play wait we go underneath

27:58.640 --> 28:08.400
what, oh what are you doing, we go whoa whoa wait whoa what do we do, oh no

28:09.120 --> 28:18.800
is this the troll room, are we being trolled right now, down, down, down we go down me, oh no, okay hold on

28:23.840 --> 28:30.800
oh everything you're suspecting, no farmer's slave girl, are you joking me, I can't tell if

28:30.800 --> 28:38.400
you're trolling or not, what you want someone that is like a fucking, what, what part are you

28:38.400 --> 28:44.880
supposed to, to exactly, oh we got him, we got him, we got him, we got the coconut, uh but

28:44.880 --> 28:51.360
coconut, uh but coconut, okay we already got the second one, oh my god there's so many items here

28:51.360 --> 28:56.640
to scavenge, are you a fake wolf, no you're real,

29:02.880 --> 29:08.320
mommy's dying, no there's a lot more going in place, I'm, I think, uh

29:10.080 --> 29:17.200
there's a lot more coming up, um I'm gonna get feedback from the girls very soon TM if they

29:17.200 --> 29:23.520
think they'd benefit from like a manager type thing, obviously, oh my god people and there's

29:23.520 --> 29:30.240
so many, just climb, just climb, just climb, there's so many, they keep coming, um a pirate, no we're

29:30.240 --> 29:35.200
not doing pirate, I'm so out of it, fucking, Mercy got memed on at one point for being a pirate, I'm

29:35.200 --> 29:39.600
like oh my god, I think she's got both of her eyes relaxed, it's what she could be in the dark

29:40.320 --> 29:40.960
right

29:43.920 --> 29:47.840
yes I'm gonna see if the girls think they'll benefit from a manager, but the thing is because we're

29:47.840 --> 29:53.360
so hands off, it's like well what do you need to manage, you get to dictate all your games,

29:53.360 --> 29:57.600
you get to dictate all your streams, you get to dictate absolutely everything you do, the only,

29:57.600 --> 30:01.760
and hell you can even write scripts if you want, if you hate the scripts you're being provided with,

30:01.760 --> 30:08.640
like it's kind of that scenario where it's like a manager normally will like tell you what to do

30:09.440 --> 30:15.280
and it's kind of like well we've actually done the opposite of that on purpose, why is there baby

30:15.280 --> 30:23.120
gargoyles as well, that's cheating, oh that's so creepy, please don't do that again, you understand

30:23.120 --> 30:28.960
me, oh okay that's fine, it's fine, I'm a brave, I'm a brave soldier, mummy's bravest warrior,

30:28.960 --> 30:35.760
mummy's bravest warrior, okay okay we're good, we're good, okay thank you for your service,

30:35.760 --> 30:41.680
okay we've already got the second one, let's go, an ex Nazgul rider, okay now you've got my

30:41.680 --> 30:45.600
attention, now you speak in lord of the rings, no I'm not fucking getting she love commissioned,

30:45.600 --> 30:50.560
we can't do insects, I'm happy to tell you the insider and all the things but if you

30:50.560 --> 30:56.080
fucking become an insect like I'm sorry but you're just, you're kind of nerfing yourself because

30:56.080 --> 31:00.880
people genuinely have like insane arachnophobia and stuff and again like if you're a VTuber that

31:00.880 --> 31:07.360
only has one eye, like a mono eye or like like 18 billion eyes on your model, again people don't

31:07.360 --> 31:17.520
like that, I saw how brains work, right thank you, uh tomb ward catacomb, located in catacomb in the

31:17.520 --> 31:28.240
cliff south of the church of Pilgrimage in the Weepin Peninsula, did I? Church of Marica, church

31:28.320 --> 31:38.400
of Pilgrimage, located in which is the south, east, south east, Dullhands, no no Dullhands either,

31:39.840 --> 31:44.880
a gimmick lasts about five seconds and then that's like a jeek and literally never streamed,

31:45.840 --> 31:51.280
um more fish themed girl, leave math fishy to see out of this, right sorry what was in the

31:52.240 --> 32:01.440
uh in the cliff south of the church in south of the church

32:04.240 --> 32:09.360
bug lovers are like 0.1% yeah it's like I don't want to give someone something I think would

32:09.360 --> 32:15.520
actually severely nerf them or doesn't have like the cliff south of the church

32:15.600 --> 32:18.880

32:20.880 --> 32:26.800

32:28.560 --> 32:34.480
an extremely controlling AI moment um actually I'll let you on the inside your knowledge

32:34.480 --> 32:39.120
having AI or anything close to it design wise where you'd actually tag it as AI

32:39.200 --> 32:46.400
eh your content gets nerfed into the ground so don't we're there heck are you going behind that tree

32:49.200 --> 32:50.240
is it just dead ahead

32:51.760 --> 32:56.720

create and come up with a unique fantasy creature oh god no it's so it's one thing to commission

33:09.440 --> 33:16.000
inspiration is a whole other kind of fish to commission something that has not even been

33:16.000 --> 33:23.840
concepted before that is when you're like you are asking for like hell on earth development

33:24.560 --> 33:27.520

33:34.320 --> 33:39.280

39:03.520 --> 39:10.800
I would never actually want someone to sell me the IP because that is yours it should belong to you

39:10.800 --> 39:16.480
and I don't think and I know some people like well you can just do basic adoption IP you have to

39:16.560 --> 39:23.280
hand over so many rights because in theory if you come aboard but you still own your IP I then

39:23.280 --> 39:28.400
have to ask you to get promotional art of you like to do promotional things with your character

39:28.400 --> 39:34.720

correct yeah that's what I'm saying like ac is brave

42:42.320 --> 42:42.800
um

42:46.880 --> 42:49.200
would I say emmy was concepted to be

42:52.080 --> 42:53.040
her mother

42:55.520 --> 42:56.240
I would see

42:59.120 --> 43:03.520
I would actually say they're actually both of them concepted to be

43:04.080 --> 43:08.480
subbed with a few barriers in the way how about we say that so

43:09.680 --> 43:17.760
and emmy doesn't necessarily like anyone outside of her big brother and she's very subdued

43:19.040 --> 43:25.680
um when she gets access to you um I don't I don't know if I said this you know her banner on

43:25.680 --> 43:32.160
twitter the one where she's hugging the hoodie so that's your hoodie and her book is open she

43:32.160 --> 43:41.360
basically just communed with you and um whilst you're hoodie um because she still has the ability

43:41.360 --> 43:46.880
to talk to you even though you're dead through the book and through like her her powers that she's

43:46.880 --> 43:52.400
gaining over time like she's a she's you're still able to talk to one another like

43:52.800 --> 43:59.280
I don't know I'm only seeing six I mean if you

44:01.440 --> 44:07.520
that's how you feel she she and if that's how you feel I'm gonna argue thank you for getting me

44:10.080 --> 44:15.600
and her 2.0 it has her wear in the big brochure yes if you didn't know the hoodie that emmy wears

44:15.600 --> 44:21.280
and her fresh jays are actually your clothes because she wants to be closer to you at all times

44:21.920 --> 44:35.840
and um she had to stitch back whoa who's farting a storm up in here um she after your little incident

44:35.840 --> 44:42.480
with that went terribly wrong she stitched back your hoodie um okay both of us missed that was

44:42.480 --> 44:47.680
rather embarrassing um and that's why her hoodie has little stitch marks and stuff all over it

44:48.320 --> 44:55.760
and then those are your fresh jeans um yeah a dummy orc lady

44:58.400 --> 45:09.520
so I do like that I don't know if giving a green skin to someone is the wisest of ideas

45:10.720 --> 45:13.200
okay where are we going did they go the wrong way

45:13.280 --> 45:19.840
you that was an honest mistake oh no we're here we're here you did it we fling you did it you

45:19.840 --> 45:28.640
gated me okay inside is the wonderful coconut no don't whimper because you have to go it's fine

45:28.640 --> 45:37.040
wait how are you whimpering while you do that move away him dummy blue troll a muscle girl

45:37.360 --> 45:45.600
uh I did have her concept but her design got rejected by me I'm happy to talk about it um

45:46.800 --> 45:52.880
if the concept artist is happy I'm waiting on the other concept artist to give me a few things

45:52.880 --> 46:04.400
at the moment um but she's been a bit radio silent um and I'm not really sure what

46:06.720 --> 46:11.360
right I'll see if any of you guys can spawn in but I don't know like because I'm like

46:11.360 --> 46:16.960
insanely over leveled or something the game's just like uh yeah you don't need anyone in

46:16.960 --> 46:22.000
I'll see if anyone pops up maybe I'll just hire Shrek stop that's what I'm saying like I don't I

46:22.000 --> 46:27.440
wouldn't want to give someone a green skin like I think someone's like oh by a lollipop fucking

46:28.400 --> 46:35.600
goblino and I'm like you're I want to give models that will give people success I don't want to

46:35.600 --> 46:40.480
hand over models where I'm like oh my god I actually don't think you have a good angle here you know

46:42.480 --> 46:48.640
when you say a design is rejected what does that mean it means I've given a prompt to the concept

46:48.640 --> 46:56.800
artist the concept artist has given me something either I want to develop further but then as the

46:56.800 --> 47:05.280
renditions kept happening nothing was it didn't go the way it just wasn't working out so um that's

47:05.280 --> 47:10.560
a rejection when I when I say like okay do not develop any further this isn't working out that's

47:10.560 --> 47:18.320
a rejection I've also done a straight up rejection where um a concept has been given um and I didn't

47:18.320 --> 47:26.320
I was I wasn't interested in developing it at all because it just was not doing anything now this is

47:26.320 --> 47:34.000
where the two concept artists come together because one is male one is female and I actually think

47:34.000 --> 47:40.160
that's a really important development factor because oh male guys female guys blah blah blah

47:40.160 --> 47:46.800
but it's important to see how two people can take the same concept and end up with something different

47:46.800 --> 47:53.120
an ax a little girl I'm pretty sure there's an ax a little girl in another agency oh I heard that

47:54.960 --> 48:02.320
isn't it how only one oh sorry I just said then people do love goblin girls I know but

48:05.680 --> 48:09.840
I'm going to be honest if I signed up for an agency and they handed me a fucking green little

48:09.840 --> 48:15.920
goblin girl I have and then I got to see my other gen mates designs I have to admit I think I'd be

48:15.920 --> 48:25.040
pretty salty the Loch Ness monster you'd need a you'd need a scott wait finally they come through

48:25.680 --> 48:34.800
oh for goodness sorry I keep sitting down sorry sorry wait can I get you can I get you an eight

48:34.800 --> 48:38.160
about um

48:39.040 --> 48:44.720
yeah Lottie yeah sorry someone's already claimed the ax a little angle I have to admit

48:46.320 --> 48:50.080
oh yeah no her name's Lottie and stuff I think she's just left her agency

48:55.040 --> 49:00.320
goddess of destruction is there is kind of a part I'm not really wanting to feel opposite

49:01.360 --> 49:06.400
I don't want to give a design where it's like all these girls are intertwined because of

49:06.400 --> 49:11.840
some hams you know some hams and I don't want like the girls to be intertwined like lower-wise

49:11.840 --> 49:22.720
or anything like that okay we're gonna get wonderful I believe this one how are you invisible

50:05.520 --> 50:11.120
agencies and faces but there is someone who came out recently that has goggles on their head um

50:13.280 --> 50:18.080

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.540
He's got apologies, let's hear it then, let's hear it then.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.540
What about you?

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.540
What about, thank you!

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.540
Okay, and how about, oh no!

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.540
Oh, he's so smushed down!

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.540
Oh, amazing!

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.540
Feel very good.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.540
And then Haya!

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.540
Oh, plant girl, yeah, sorry, plant girl, yeah.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540
I'm not bad.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.540
So you need to spell stuff out for me, for where to click.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.540
You're beautiful!

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.540
Located in the southwest side of the hermit village.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:11.540
Hermit village, any hermit villagers?

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.540
Uh, it's hermit village.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.540
Hold on, hold on.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.540
Don't write me off yet.

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.540
So, hermit village.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.540
Hermit village?

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.540
Hold on.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.540
Uh, hermit village, northeast of the craft.

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.540
Man's shack?

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.540
Is this the wrong one?

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.540
Southeast of Volcano Manor.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.540
Southeast of Volcano Manor.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:51.540
Hermit village is in the swamp.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.540
It's in Mill, Gilmore, west of the map.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.540
Where I've not explored yet.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.540
Like this?

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.540
Is it where I've not explored?

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.540
What about an angel lollipop?

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.540
Kind of defeats the purpose.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.540
Defeats the purpose of wee bit.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.540
Yeah, you didn't reach it yet.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.540
Okay, okay, okay.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:18.540
There's only one thing for it then, lads.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:23.540
You guys are going to be walking me where we need to go.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.540
What have I got so far?

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.540
I've got a lamia, but I'm going to have to be honest.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.540
I think Dark Elf Milf has beaten her.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.540
A milf, hard-faced, since it's always done the opposite.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:44.540
But I don't know how that would play out.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.540
I've got a blacksmith muscle milf.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.540
I have a plant pheromone milf.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:57.540
And for lollipop, I have a possessive dragon.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
Then...

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.540
No, I had a harpy, but I think I'm getting that riddle.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:05.540
And then I've got a cheerleader opi, but...

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.540
I can't really see it.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.540
Sorry, my notes are down to the left here.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.540
The tracking went off.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.540
How did the fairy get rejected?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:22.540
I can't really see it.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.540
Why?

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.540
I think we just have to...

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:32.540
I'm happy to show the behind the scenes once everyone is out and shown and all of that.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.540
And the girls can probably talk about it.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.540
I look like this.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.540
But I could have looked like this.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.540
This is my original concept.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.540
My prompt got completely changed.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.540
AC's prompt got completely changed.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:51.540
She was actually supposed to be a neat gamer.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.540
And her name was going to be Joystick with an eye.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.540
I know, I don't know why, but...

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.540
What about a lollipop with a rat queen?

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.540
Wait a second, what? The blacksmith was half-orc.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.540
So she didn't really have green-green skin.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.540
But she still has muscle.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.540
I don't know, I'm going to submit the ideas to the concept art.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.540
See what it comes up with.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.540
And we'll see.

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.540
Stop you! Stop you!

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.540
Covering before me or whimpering.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540
Pick your poison, whimper or cower.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:27.540
Hopefully you guys know where we're going, but I'll just take your word.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540
Let's get to it, to it.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.540
Let's get this party started.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.540
Let's get them 40's popping.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540
Let's break their poison, miss them.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.540
Oh, they can't handle our damage.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.540
When we start swinging,

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.540
our swords do all the thinking.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.540
These enemies like to be with me.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.540
I suck on their...

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.540
Their...

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.540
Their souls.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.540
We buy crab sticks,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540
and we pay no rent.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.540
The world's gone on fire.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.540
The air-trees wait.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.540
I can't do it anymore, it's too hard.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.540
I'm trying to swing into it, but it's hard.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.540
No, MC Stoney in the house.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.540
Cotton bum used to look so chubby in her design.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.540
What was she supposed to see?

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.540
So she was always going to be a bunny rabbit.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:27.540
And we...

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.540
We knew we wanted our body type that was a considered alternative.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.540
Because every agency, you look, everyone's a stick.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:38.540
So we were like, right, we're going to have at least one design that ain't a stick.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.540
Like the default stick type thing.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:45.540
Which we did get.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.540
And if you didn't know, I see an Emmy.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.540
Emmy's Patan.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.540
But she's actually quite flat in the hips as well.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.540
That's on purpose.

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.540
Whereas AC, I mean, she's all hips.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.540
Like we wanted variant body type.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.540
Whoa!

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.540
Hold on.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.540
We got some spanking to do.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.540
We got some...

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540
Hello?

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.540
Has he targeted me? I don't know, can I spank him?

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.540
No, I don't know.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.540
Hold on.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:23.540
Are you aiming for the refling under the map right now?

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.540
Where the heck is he?

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:30.540
Whoa, yeah, where's the Tabarina guy?

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
I'm helping, I'm helping.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.540
I'm doing nothing, I'm doing nothing.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.540
But I'm helping.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.540
Where is he?

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.540
I don't know where the main boss is.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.540
Literally not even in the fight because I don't know where the boss is.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.540
As if he pulled me.

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:56.540
Oh, that's one of these.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.540
Oh, I did just buy that.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.540
Oh, yeah!

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.540
Jeez, I'm not dealing with him.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.540
Oh, there he is, there he is, I found him.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.540
What do you mean it's not this big glowing man?

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.540
Oh, that was freaking heal.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.540
Don't you blow that horn!

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.540
Don't you blow that horn!

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.540
Wait, it's done.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.540
Whoa, where did you guys come from?

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.540
Oh, we got a death root, I can feed it to the dog.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.540
I guess we'll just keep going because these guys just keep going.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't know where to go.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540
Was it that thing back there?

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.540
I'm pretty sure I saw it, hold on.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.540
Hold on, let me get on, let me get on Mio's.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.540
Let me get on Mio's.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.540
Ooh, something's making noise.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.540
This guy.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.540
Show me the way.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.540
A pixie would be cool.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:07.540
The collabs, she's like literally just a tiny thing in the corner

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.540
that would actually put comical.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.540
Up the hill?

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.540
Up the hill in between north and west, okay.

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.540
A pixie?

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.540
I can't say I've ever seen a pop lamio.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.540
Ah, he's going to put, maybe.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.540
And she'd have a wee, tiny tail.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.540
Honestly, that'd be pretty cute.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.540
I'm sorry, that'd be adorable.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540
Wait.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.540
Oh, there's a great sight.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.540
Hello.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.540
Oh, okay, okay.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.540
What was it like?

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.540
Oh, well, we're going to keep on, keep on moving up.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.540
Is this it?

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.540
Okay, this looks like I've ever seen one.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.540
Right, I think I've got some suggestions to work on.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:43.540
Eh, doing a little cringey prompt thing.

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.540
Wait, I don't need to do that.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.540
Nullified.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.540
Okay, I'm in wide-harm cackles.

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.540
Is that where I'm supposed to be?

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540
I hope I'm supposed to be.

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.540
A salamander girl?

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.540
You a salamander?

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.540
A salamander?

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.540
A big Sally?

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.540
Call her Sally the salamander.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.540
Everyone will remember her name real easy.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.540
In kind.

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.540
A cyclope for all?

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.540
No, absolutely not.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:26.540
Eh, real one of each of us have two fucking eyeballs.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.540
That's literally it.

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.540
It is very, like, if you do not just straight up have a face,

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.540
it, like, you know, you use some alternative type stuff.

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.540
Eh, but Mercy has two eyes.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.540
Shut the fuck up, Mercy has two eyes.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.540
Stop arguing with me.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.540
Where you got, what are you...

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.540
Wait, I'm in the wrong place?

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.540
Oopsies, I'm in the wrong place, sorry.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540
Okay, let's try that again.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.540
I'm in the wrong place.

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.540
I'm being sent away.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.540
I'm being excreted from these purses.

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.540
I'm in the wrong place.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.540
No, let's go up right here.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.540
I feel like I'm on my way.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.540
It's all the way to the left, I guess?

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:31.540
Sorry, I may be, uh, being a bit Papiga as I usually am.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:43.540
I think I've gone the complete wrong way.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:51.540
I've gone the complete wrong way or have I missed on this?

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.540
I'm being reassigned.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:59.540
Sorry, I think I need to go back if there's nothing here.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.540
Oh, I think I've gone the wrong way.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.540
Are you squiddling me right now?

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:08.540
You are just like my GF.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.540
She hides in the back while I do all the work.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.540
Then says, we did it after I'm done defeating the boss.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.540
Myself, hand over mouth, hand over mouth, hand over mouth.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.540
Hand over mouth.

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.540
What, you just let my girlfriend, she hides in the back while I do all the work.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.540
Oh, right, okay, I get it now.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.540
Look, princess carrying through games is universal experience, okay?

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.540
Thank you for the five kill more, combine.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:36.540
I get it now, I get it now, but it's fucking true though.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:39.540
Sorry, let me reread the location.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.540
Located, uh, in milk game more.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:50.540
Wait, did I not get a grace site?

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.540
Did I not get a grace site?

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:53.540
Is this the one?

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.540
Fuck it, we're going in deep.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:59.540
I'm going horseback, baby.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.540
Yeah, this is milk.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:07.540
So then we're going to keep going north and see what happens.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:12.540
There must be a shack ahead.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.540
Stinky poopies.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.540
Ow!

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:18.540
Oh, I'm so sorry, Viman.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.540
Sorry, Torren, I'm a terrible right.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.540
I actually don't have my license.

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.540
I'm sorry, I just ride a bike usually.

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:25.540
I'm not used to this.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:26.540
Ah!

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.540
See, is there only one?

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.540
Yeah, okay.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.540
Whoa, I hear something.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.540
What is it?

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:44.540
A bug!

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.540
What's up ahead?

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.540
I don't recall.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.540
I see enemies, I see a lot of enemies.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:56.540
I see enemies.

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.540
Save point.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.540
Castello.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.540
Is that you?

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:08.540
Can you please hurry?

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.540
Can you please hurry?

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.540
The void people are there?

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.540
Oh my God.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.540
Oh my God.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.540
Oh, there's another one.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.540
Get away.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.540
Get away, you bum.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.540
Get away, you bum.

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:17.540
Are we?

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.540
Are we with you?

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.540
Oh my God, I can't see.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:20.540
I can't see none.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:21.540
I actually can't see none.

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.540
I'm sitting down.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.540
I'm sitting down.

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.540
It's fine.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.540
Is it this one?

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
It's not this one.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:32.540
Johnny, you said the first thing you said you had to issue with your marshmallow.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.540
Has it been fixed?

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.540
Nah.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:35.540
Oh, sorry.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:36.540
Wait, wrong one.

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:41.540
I meant to put Mully on so I can actually see and get out of this cave.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.540
Nah.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540
See you.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.540
Yeah.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.540
Oh my God.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.540
Oh my God.

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540
Right.

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:59.540
If you need to tell me anything that's important, question mark.

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:08.540
Then fucking let me know via...

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.540
I shouldn't...

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:11.540
I shouldn't...

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.540
I shouldn't...

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.540
I shouldn't swear.

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.540
I mean, I can be swear, but...

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:20.540
Okay, now they drove from the sky.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.540
That cannot feel good.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:27.540
I regret to inform you that it does not feel good to drive from the sky.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.540
Okay.

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540
Volcanic stone.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:33.540
Hmm, I wonder if we're going to an area that has volcanic activity.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.540
Trillium mystery.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:40.540
I remember really liking volcanoes when I was younger.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.540
Well, I had to to in a minute, but I didn't have to.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.540
It went away.

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:44.540
It goes to the sun.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.540
Ooh, what are you?

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:50.540
Fireproof dried liver.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.540
Does that mean you can't receive marshmallows?

01:20:54.540 --> 01:21:04.540
No, no one has access to their marshmallows right now.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:16.540
Oh, there's a map here.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.540
I mean, that's not even going to help.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.540
I've still not came across this bloody village yet.

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.540
This bloody village.

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.540
Hold on.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.540
Hold on.

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.540
Let me just put a little more.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.540
Something's gone for me.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.540
He has triple sprain.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.540
Come on.

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:35.540
That's about OP.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.540
I don't have triple sprain.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.540
Oh, the jellyfish will lead me.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:43.540
The jellyfish are always at a cavern or is that a grief site?

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:44.540
Oh, no.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.540
Oh, no, this can't be.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.540
There's no gravestone here.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.540
Sugar.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.540
Wait, am I going the complete wrong way?

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:57.540
What am I?

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.540
Who or what is fighting?

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.540
Something's fighting over there.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.540
Just follow the path.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.540
Oh, sorry.

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.540
I thought it was one of the things.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.540
Who is fighting who?

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.540
Surely you guys are.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.540
Oh, no.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.540
Wait, there's actual fighting.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.540
I'm so used to everything just going for me.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:25.540
It's incomprehensible that there's actual fighting going on.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:35.540
It seems like we're on a battlefield.

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:41.540
I'm getting XP for doing nothing.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.540
What were you?

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.540
Reefling?

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.540
Reefling is coming here?

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.540
Oh, no.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:55.540
This means it's a boss fight.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:00.540
Are they coming for me?

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.540
Okay.

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:04.540
I think they forgot I existed, which is what I like to hear.

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.540
Is there a dragon ahead?

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.540
Is there any reeflings able to make it to this really random location at this part of the

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.540
map that I haven't unlocked yet?

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.540
Uh-huh.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.540
And Mt. Gililmower or whatever.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.540
So we can go wallop a dragon.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.540
Do you think I'll lose?

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.540
There is a high probability I'll lose.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:29.540
Very high probability.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.540
Okay.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.540
Do you think we can do it, Reefling?

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.540
Just me and you?

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.540
No pressure?

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.540
Do you think you can do it?

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.540
Oh well, we'll go back up.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.540
That's a good thing.

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.540
We'll go back up.

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.540
Okay, we'll go back up.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.540
Let's go.

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:49.540
Is there any no-nos?

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:53.540
Insects, mutants, ogres?

01:23:53.540 --> 01:24:03.540
So anything that would give the girl a debuff?

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:06.540
I don't want to hear it.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:12.540
Like, you have to remember that there, like, you can't give someone a...

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.540
Stop your whimpering!

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.540
We're going to defeat the dragon.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.540
Can we stand in the lake fire?

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.540
Or is this dragon going to be, like, in the ear of Wolverine

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:24.540
and just, like, annihilate us all in one go?

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.540
Oh, speaking of the dragon.

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.540
Uh, oops.

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.540
Hold on.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.540
Hold on.

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.540
Uh, that's not good.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.540
It's not actually supposed to put your health down.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540
Whoa.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.540
Whoa!

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:45.540
Okay, I think the lag is, like, terrible right now.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.540
Well, I'm helping.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:48.540
I'm helping.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:49.540
I'm getting rolled.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.540
I'm getting rolled.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.540
I'm rolling out of the way.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.540
I'm rolling out of the way.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.540
I don't know how.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.540
Please let me heal.

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.540
Oh, I got hurt by...

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.540
I got spanked by a spot.

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:08.540
And maybe you should have put a fire-resistant talisman on,

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:12.540
but that's not on me.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.540
Wait, you can't hurt him?

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:17.540
Or am I just getting really bad taimans?

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.540
Okay, we did it.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.540
We did it.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540
We did it.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.540
We did it.

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.540
Um...

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.540
Dragonheart.

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.540
Dragonheart.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.540
More like this dragon farted and boosted.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.540
Dun dun dun.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.540
A debuff.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.540
Wait, am I using the word the wrong way around?

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.540
A debuff is a negative, a buff is a good.

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.540
Can you walk on lava?

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:43.540
Whoa, whoa.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.540
Wait, what?

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:50.540
Can I walk on lava?

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:55.540
Wait, I'm taking damage.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.540
Is torrent taking damage?

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.540
Wait, no, this can't be.

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.540
Wait, no.

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.540
What?

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.540
What?

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.540
I'm going crazy.

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.540
Okay, it is hurting torrent.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.540
Is that a dead end over there?

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.540
Sorry, torrent.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.540
I'll keep your vetoes.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540
He's off.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540
There you go.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.540
Is this a dead end or not?

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.540
No, it's not a dead end.

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.540
Nothing?

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.540
Yeah, nothing off-putting.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.540
You can't eat someone a model and be like,

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.540
oh, sorry, we actually don't know if people will overall

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.540
enjoy your model.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.540
But good luck though.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.540
Good luck in your success.

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.540
We'll do everything, but then you're on your own.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.540
Smile.

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:45.540
If I hand over a shirt, that's a pillow.

01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:53.540
Someone in my group defeated the shard bear.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.540
Go, reeflings, go.

01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:58.540
I'm so proud of you.

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:02.540
You're doing it.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:07.540
That's the bear that AC literally defeated in our

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:08.540
lore video.

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:11.540
Feel old yet?

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.540
This is a piece of cheese.

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.540
You know those memes that are like, feel old yet?

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.540
This is this person you saw this many years ago.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:25.540
I like hate those memes so much.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:30.540
So the only version I enjoy is when it's like absolute

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.540
nonsense and it's like feel old yet?

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.540
This is a piece of day old salmon.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.540
Those are the only ones I can tolerate.

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.540
A debuff is a disadvantage.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:59.540
Can you like, let me be in your hand?

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.540
Maybe not in that context, in terms of like,

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.540
actual preference of the character.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.540
I've just been in terms of like,

01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.540
design and stuff, debuff.

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:13.540
But not how the, what?

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:17.540
No, I've unlocked these guys.

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.540
Oh, we made it to hermit village.

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.540
Okay, now what?

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:22.540
Now what?

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.540
Now what?

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.540
Oh, I don't like those guys at all.

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.540
I can't stand them.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.540
I can't stand them.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:31.540
Am I in trouble?

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.540
Oh my, oh my.

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:35.540
Oh my!

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.540
I'm actually going to perish.

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.540
I'm actually going to perish.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.540
I'm getting freaking annihilated.

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.540
Sit down.

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:43.540
Sit down.

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.540
Sit down.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.540
Touch it, touch it, touch it.

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:46.540
Oh my god it's charging up.

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.540
It's actually charging up to go for me.

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:51.540
Just charging up to go for me.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:29:10.540
are you okay oh there's more enemies than I need to go across this or I need to call

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:16.940
in a weeping calling in a weeping calling in reinforcements because I want to investigate

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:32.300
that chair but there's an enemy right there I grew in the entire area and literally I like

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:41.840

in and me broken and AC was a feral scars which are quite late and I kind of like the

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.600
idea of like you have to tame her but then eventually like it's you know she all good

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:35.400

01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:10.680
work it just works I'll get a vtuber is called Howard I'm kidding I don't understand how being

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:19.440
an insect or spider is a debuff and right I'm not gonna sound like an ass hat and I mean

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:30.840
absolutely nothing when I say this but name one bug vtuber right now I'm gonna be honest

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:50.400
and say I can't and I don't mean that in a nasty way but right so and all those names

01:32:50.400 --> 01:33:04.920
you've all just typed I recognize one yeah it's not like an endless list it's like you guys have

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:11.120
repeated two of the same names over and over like I don't mean it in a bad way and I'm sure it's

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:16.080
probably gonna frustrate people but you have to like is there no other reason that can come in

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.880
oh and like I'm sure it's gonna frustrate people like oh my god you didn't make the exact

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:29.960
design I wanted but like please be realistic like one like if I'm gonna get shit for like telling

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.240
like the behind the scenes stuff like I'm happy to shut up and just like quiet but like the fun

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.800
part is that we can do these discussions and I can be like look I'm gonna be honest bug vtuber

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:48.360
is a debuff it might be hard to imagine it is not like a good thing like the reason why you know

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:56.080
and the Visho Joe bug is because well fucking Visho Joe and also they came with like an absolutely

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:05.240
insane amount behind like if you mean I mean like actual insect and that's the only insect I

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.240
think someone was saying a moth or whatever but that's not like if you're talking like insect

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:17.120
like centipede arachnid type star oh it was like actually in the village

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:31.680
late when you consume content well so all of you can actually do this right now when you

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:37.320
consume content you can literally look into the success factors of what Lake has made someone

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:43.920
and like as you start to analize and kind of get past the point of you cute girl that's why she's

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:49.640
successful it's like no motherfucker look harder and it's like there's one bug girl that you guys can

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.320
all name off the top of your head hasn't said before I don't but like if you want to talk about

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:35.160
keeps you stronger it must be that keeps you stronger in magic

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.560
I just see you see well we grab these items even though I don't even craft anything

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.840

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:57.960

not an exit like little wait spindly uh really after what I can't believe it

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:38.040
the whimpering one is dlc I think I unlocked the area nearby if anyone's dlc section

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:40.520
um

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.200
did I come I came this way

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.920
there is something up here but I can't remember

01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.920
I don't know if it's just maybe an item

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.520
up here oh

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:21.320
oh my god I actually have to be brave and do this without my replays man I hate it

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.480
whoa uh I didn't do much damage I'm okay

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.600

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.840
oh and there's another one just do it just to top off

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.880
stop it what is this area

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.920
right seems to be some sort of reward under this

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.600
hold on a minute there's an enemy under here wash off the runny whoa

01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.960
it wouldn't let me attack there because of that notification okay I got talisman that was decent

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:09.080
talisman are like kind of worth the key is this still the dlc no we went back to get the prattling

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:17.560
a weak coconut because I am very not well and I just need to do a short spoon today and

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:30.920
however I seem I go up in order to get out oh I got ashes ashes of war

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:44.520
I'm not gonna get lost hold on wait I've been in this place before I have no recollection of this

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:51.240
place but I've been in this place before as long as I'm going up I think I'm going the right way

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.000
okay yeah because we killed those guys that is really early okay I think we're good

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:07.880
just teleport out oh you can teleport out okay okay okay okay okay right we're going dlc

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:11.480
and it's the some location in the dlc I think um

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.480
you should go to chadows hero grave oh god I've not learned the names of these places

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:24.040
chadows hero grave sure wait

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.000
wait why is it doing it like that

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:38.040
this is a dragon area oh chadows hidden grave

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.920
if you push too much we'll have to contact your cats to tie you up and put you in bed

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:52.760
honestly I don't know if any reeflings are at this section though well I heard I heard a noise

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:57.560
it sounds like one of them is it's about enemy reeflings got enemies got a lead enemy oh I saw

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:06.760
that one don't worry I'll get you back in we're just don't rely on reeflings for two minutes

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:11.720
challenge impossible damn straight it's impossible I don't want to be on what one I'm too scared

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:18.520
this game is it's literally a horror game when I can't spawn you guys in I can't remember what

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:25.080
section yesterday I couldn't have you guys in I was dying a day kidney handle it

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:34.120
kidney handle it at least I have a reefling to help me through the scary bit

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:39.800
no I don't rub it in my face we're trying to get it does that not work

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:45.480
wait hold on hold on I can talk a little bit now

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:54.280
let's get to it ah let me mark off the list and then we're gonna get the morning coconut

01:52:54.280 --> 01:53:02.280
instead beautiful right and then last but not last morning coconut that's literally what we're

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:14.680
calling it oh no it's not it's whimpering we're getting the whimpering one do you get

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:21.720
spooked easily in horror games I can hardly play them I don't actually play them like in my in my

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.880
in my free time I don't play horror games let's get to it uh is there no other reefling that can

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:36.520
join are we too high are we too high in the dlc yeah I think we are okay um okay gating light we

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:44.360
have a torch actually I think that playing you would have been saying because the bosses would

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.880
have a normal health but I can get to your point scary monsters yeah I don't like when it's all on

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.560
me like it's why I really enjoy Assassin's Creed brotherhood because like even if you're bad you

01:53:55.560 --> 01:54:01.080
have things to rely on you to help you like get through the game like you can use the crossbow

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.880
for stealth and all that and you can call on your assassin recruits like it's a nice oh my god there

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:11.880
might not be a spider on my foot I don't know why I feel sorry I literally felt something on my foot

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:21.880
and I was like oh spider uh no it's actually just a reason hitting hitting I'm having a stroke

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:23.880
literally my life that's it right now

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:33.000
I mean Elder Ring does have spirit ashes and but is it the same

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.960
I got jumped in you're not sitting on your feet no I'm sitting with my legs pressed against the

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:46.040
desk so my feet are on the chair right now I can't sit on them at the moment uh due to the

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:53.400
minor loss of a body part um there will not be any feet sitting on for quite a while

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.360
but I can sit with them up at least which I'm happy about

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.640
there's no reefing spirit ashes just not the same I'm not gonna make it

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:12.920
sheebie is going live in t-minus one minute uh I will be redirecting into her once we pick up this

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.240
frattle and coconut and then I'm gonna tuck myself nice and tidy into my bed oh the worms are angry

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.960
there's blue jean

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.920
oh no wouldn't want to be wrapped up in their tentacles oh no

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.140
oh

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:42.360
to recovery for I do not think so I think uh I think we're

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:52.120
the yeah I think it's um I think it's ogre it's truly ogre it's the it's the end of a oh it's in here

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:57.880
you stop that whimpering I'll whimper back in a minute once I get this coconut

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.600
hold on let me put my little light on let me make sure I'm illuminated the worms are really

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:12.040
confirmed my little tentacles why you're all in here hello uh is there anyone here that

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:17.080
haven't had a chance to join in yeah I wish you needed to get in made you feel like you've not

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:24.600
had a chance oh oops sorry how can we kiss you to better we can't see it you want to kiss my

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.640
mangled gory toes sure okay I think you too haven't had a chance to be in yet

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:37.000
uh but oh my god this is so weird this is like the last thing we're doing and then

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.520
we're literally going africate oh no wait who do you think coming

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.400
is it my connection or is it your connection be honest

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:55.080
it's probably the servers and overlord no I got inappropriate activity

01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.880
it's so weird

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:08.120
I'll get enemy reflux gaden like uh but yeah I'm like

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:16.360
the good thing is I think I'll be able to go to the shops and buy myself like actual food

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:22.760
because I've been having to rely on like takeaway for quite a while now and I think

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:29.800
that's also not helping with my four-day loaf of bread because that tiny little thing I produced

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:40.280
yesterday I'm probably on day five in all honesty um takeaway is good but I am not looking after

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:45.320
myself because I'm like having so much fun streaming like I said like as soon as I click go live I

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:51.320
don't feel stressed I feel excited I want to share the plans I want to share like the things

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:58.680
like Azura has just hit over 5 000 subscribers ac is like just shy of it if you're not subscribed

01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:04.680
to ac snowfalls her link is in my description and then literally in under a month all members

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:11.640
of VLR have hit 5 000 subscribers which is just insane for a new like we um

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:14.760
I'm

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:21.080
carful like that is it car is it carful is it really a corporation if they can do what they

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:27.560
want for the most of the part for the most part wait I can't see anyone else

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:39.640
I'm gonna try and I know I want to be selfish but I'm trying to beat this area you want me to come

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:46.360
yeah everyone's been monetized everyone's about to hit at least 5k there's like ASMR

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:51.480
collabs on the way like I'm just so excited for all these wee things to finally come out

01:58:51.480 --> 01:59:01.160
um I got to see the video game animation um there I'm gonna say it might still come out in July

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:09.480
near the end I'm not sure how fast this animators working but um like the games come in the games

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:14.360
free access and all that jazz so don't worry are you working him with that

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:27.400
the corporation ran by an anti-corporal it's enemy levels of funny honestly though

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:35.400
stop whimpering great come on let's go let's go let's go time to have 6k hours oh no the the maximum

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:41.160
if you want to unlock all the wee thingies and they're very small like if you're

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:48.280
you know if not everyone is your flavor and in the agency then you're probably only gonna play

01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:59.320
through it once um what's going on here not that way I guess um but if everyone is your flavor

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:09.160
or you just have a genuine curiosity then um you can probably you're the full unlock play

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:15.960
time would be an hour um but it would be mildly repetitive other than the new voice playing

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:22.040
here and there to take a different order of things um it's not it's not anything major

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.400
so this is a warrior door

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.440
and then I can spoil all the behind the scenes of what it's like to make a video game

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.520
are you ready

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.120
oh

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:53.160
wait why does it call it that oh he looks so sad he's blue

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:59.320
amidst a blissful lamentation what's lamentation

02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:12.760
what's lamentation I will be putting 100 hours into it you can it would be too repetitive

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.320
literally if you unlock everything then there's nothing else there's no like hidden secrets before

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:24.440
anyone's like oh my god strongy such an elite gamer that she would put in hidden secrets if you do

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.760
this in this order no there's none of that do not torture yourself thinking there's any hidden

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:33.080
secrets everything is there oh sorry replaying

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.640
uh we got a key okay

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:50.440
blissful lamentation is just a funny word for why would they put that in the game

02:01:50.840 --> 02:02:01.160
a way to hear strongy every day and some scenes gonna play an extra two no it's not that

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:09.080
like please like remember first of her attempt at like commission oh my god reflin are you okay

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.640
that looks like that hurt I'm not gonna lie um

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:14.840
um

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:20.280
oh wait they don't even have a name

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:25.400
who's screaming today

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:31.640
um is it gonna be on steam no it can't be

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:41.160
stop screaming okay I think I know why the coconut of screaming is in here

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:44.840
what are you

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.560
they're like straight up doing everything for me it's gonna be on it too

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.640

oh my god you got jumped no are we to go down oh can you cast magic in here

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.600
oh I have to admit the Billy it cast magic from afar yeah this is exactly why

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:31.080
oh reflin I don't need to

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:40.680
uh a completion bar no but it will be very apparent like what you can unlock and what

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.800
replaying would do so you're not wasting your time if you play it and you're like not sorry
