441440	448640	what did you why did you choose vealor instead of remaining independent Azura and Azura said
449200	460480	I saw a great opportunity and vealor entrusted in our vision the support a company can give its
460480	466880	talent is a great starting point oh thank you Azura really you're far too kind but how important
466880	474880	was the amount of freedom with content creation being open to discussing pls etc for you I don't
474880	482240	really want to discuss my pl but I'm happy that I get the freedom to talk about some aspects of
482240	489360	life even when wanting to create new memories and the future for myself oh sure that's so kind of you
490080	494960	I'm glad that you enjoyed that uh we're an agency that doesn't acknowledge your fucking brand new
494960	502720	out the out the out the package okay thank you Azura I appreciate that and what platform did you
502720	511200	want to make content on prior to being a part of vealor Azura since I originally streamed on Twitch
511200	520000	I wanted to make the move to youtube and continue making content there including shorts and I actually
520000	525280	speaking of shorts Azura sorry to interrupt you I've just ordered four shorts of you right now
525280	530160	okay I'm just waiting on an asset and there's four shorts coming they're quite humorous okay okay
530160	536240	strong thank you yes actually she calls me stroney as in minna stroney like she didn't go stroney

542400	548640	you love yeah yeah thanks Azura okay sorry to interrupt you back to the question uh as content
548640	555520	there doesn't entirely get removed after a few days like twitch box okay thank you Azura okay
557360	564640	but what inspired you to create content or content in general for that matter Azura
565440	572960	I've always had a feel for voice acting and always wanted to take part in some kind of way
573760	580800	the many voices that approached me were compliment towards my voice and how I should pursue it
581360	589680	which piqued my curiosity in the air however the many voices claimed my voice is extremely
589680	599920	erotic oh so when the opportunity appeared it felt like it was meant to be oh wow I agree with
599920	604960	that I am sure people did compliment you I have no doubts about that Azura I absolutely no doubts
604960	615920	at all um is there any content you're particularly interested in making well that would be the
616880	626720	awesome raw place oh Azura all right I also look forward to being in other opportunity oh is that a hint to the video game Azura
626720	634400	Azura is that a hint to the video game I don't know by the way before anyone's like oh new viewer
634400	640400	here I thought stroney was a mix of strong and funny oh um for anyone who's like uh did you
640480	645840	look over the girls answers and stuff uh I think I fixed one sentence and it was in mercies
646800	651040	that's it I've not changed any all these answers are what they actually said I fixed one sentence
651040	656320	in mercies which I actually didn't tell her about sorry mercy yeah fuck you stroney that's not what
656320	661520	you sound like anyway well double fuck you then right whoa whoa whoa sit down sit down whoa
661520	667840	I'm fighting myself here okay stop stop okay uh do you have any uh other content creators advice on
667840	673520	how to navigate uh creating uh alternative content on the internet especially when it comes
673520	681920	safely navigating it because I miss the word safely there if it's a view tubing related and you wish
681920	688560	to keep your identity private try not to share too much information that could put you at risk for
688960	694480	but it's perfectly okay to be honest and do things that make what
696960	702400	don't oh don't force your side I fucking can't read in my own interview yeah is there are you okay
702400	707600	do you need glasses you know you're the fucking I'm putting my glasses on okay hold on right glasses

717040	725760	me fucking neglects Azura I'll let her it this is the lore oh it steady on right uh don't force
725760	732320	yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable and the rather open up slowly okay I'll open you
732320	736800	up slowly Azura thank you uh right what was the next question uh what do you hope to bring or
736800	743360	change in the view tubing landscape Azura I don't think I can change much of anything but I would
743360	752960	hope that people can see more person of color talent in the image oh I like that thank you thank
752960	760320	you for fucking ego stroking the other I didn't even have to ask for that oh this cup of tea

810400	818640	it again with the snowberries truly a mystery hmm yes yes that's right dad as we did it again I knew

832080	840160	little feral polar bear is gonna go offline and do you know exactly what I know exactly what she's
840160	847280	doing right now I'm sorry but she fucking enjoys that too much someone clipped her and I saw it
847280	852080	and she's like burst out laugh and when you'll start jumping on her and I was like yeah die
853840	856320	okay innocent honestly
858880	863840	look she's my baby girl okay she my she my doll face she my doll face
865600	872160	mm-hmm okay we're currently reading Azur's interview from a acapella media look at them
872400	882720	I just revealed a bit of secret lore about um the uh design uh the promotional artwork this was
882720	888720	ordered before the designs were finalized because look Azur doesn't have her nails painted and one
888720	896160	of the biggest giveaways is her headband if it has floating jewellery that's actually uh that's
896160	904800	actually a massive giveaway on if uh the artwork was completed or not at that point um they forgot
904800	909520	about the jewellery on their toes oh yeah actually yeah that was another big thing so you can tell
909520	919280	what stage of panic in production we were at depending on what the thing was but now everything's
919280	927920	made correctly um oh oh my god the tea is steaming up my glasses I forget glasses steam up
931680	935840	okay I've had my tea right back to the questions uh Azur can I keep question yet of course
936400	943440	Stroney okay thank you Azur um right what's one thing you want people to remember about you
943440	950720	individually or as a generation I may not be the first but I started with almost nothing
951280	959280	I did the best I could and achieved very little I just want to show others that it's very possible
959280	966240	and you shouldn't give up I still have a long way to go yes um I I think me and Azura are completely
966240	974080	on the exact same page when I say this um I see a lot of potential in Azura which is why she's Azura
975120	984000	um you know I I see myself and the girls to different degrees and Azura was definitely
984000	989200	and I don't think this is an insult in any way I think she completely 100% gets what why I say this
989200	996000	I think Azura is the the version of me that I see that I needed a helping hand or a gating hand
996000	1000800	and once you know things settle down and everything I'm going to try and get her moved out with her
1000800	1005360	donathon that's coming up next month which is actually really exciting it comes up in August
1006320	1010960	I'm going to try and get her moved out and then things can kind of I think it's upwards and onwards
1010960	1018160	for Azura after that the underdog yes I I I'm a sucker for my underdog I always root for them
1018160	1024720	and I think Azura has insane potential she just needs a few things to occur
1025680	1030080	and then I I think she's got it she's absolutely she's got nothing to worry about
1030080	1036400	um but we just need to first get her moved out and then I can just nuke her brain on all the
1036400	1045200	secrets and behind the scenes stuff okay my little pad of one yes uh right um what do you want to
1045200	1057920	represent in the v-tube sphere Azura I'm not I just I know I'm just another voice but I want to do
1057920	1065680	so much more with that voice I always thought my voice was very no it's not I Azura I picked you
1065680	1071680	because you said I need more gold in your goddamn voice I was about to cross off your damn stream
1071680	1077200	you're a league player you but maybe I can find something that can truly represent in the beach
1077200	1085040	on the sphere yes um Azura humble max and literally I everyone knows why I picked them
1085040	1089600	I told them I said it on debut and I told them like one on one like hey this is why you got picked
1089600	1097040	or type thing um now you have to remember this is the first time Azura has ever been in any kind
1097040	1103200	of spotlight kind of had this attention so please don't be afraid if the girls may have said something
1103200	1108080	that wasn't the kindest to themselves they're not all confident you know they can't all be
1109280	1118160	just absolutely arrogant like myself um so if you see if you see a reply and you're like oh that's
1118160	1124800	a wee shame just remember these some of these girls have never achieved anything close to what
1124800	1130000	they've achieved in the very first month of the very first month at Vilaura they have not achieved
1130000	1136400	that and they're at their time as a content creator so very yes we will grow and blossom their
1136400	1143600	confidence just as the beautiful nasturtiums blossom you know stroney you're just being truthful
1143600	1150000	to yourself as an arrogant okay one more question for Azura and we have finalized Azura's interview
1150000	1157680	mm-hmm uh Azura is there any event in VTubing history that is incredibly significant to you
1158880	1165440	there isn't one that particularly stood out to me but I suppose seeing the rise of Vilaura
1166000	1173360	already coming out with the person of color talent right off the bat was incredibly nice
1174160	1181600	as well as management being open to more person of color designs behind the scenes
1181600	1190640	and developments was very reassuring it wasn't a publicity stunt now I have a oh boy do I have
1190640	1196320	some information about gen 2 to leak to you motherfuckers uh yeah you're not ready for what
1196320	1203440	occurred yesterday with the development team oh boy right that is uh beautiful Azura Dooley
1203440	1210080	please do uh find her youtube channel in the link in the description below you can subscribe
1210080	1215200	check out her shorts I will be getting her new short she's the next batch of shorts and then it
1215200	1221360	goes to Sheebie and then we're rotating all over again because a few of the shorts editors uh have
1221360	1227120	exams etc so I'm having to rotate gracefully between each girl to try and give them a fair
1227120	1231600	amount of shorts um but we're not quite there yet but thank you so much for that interview
1231600	1237440	Azura that was fantastic you may go and rest for your stream today which is probably League of

1287200	1292880	coming off of her little hips uh this was made again before the designs were like fully fleshed

1332640	1340720	okay interview vealor is the first agency of its kind why did you my little icicle choose it
1340720	1348880	instead of remaining independent um i already had a previously good experience with them
1350160	1358400	and from that day why does it sound like a zero i always for fuck hold on let me pull up ac right
1358400	1363280	now hold on let me pull up ac stream so i can fucking mimic tear her right now hold on pause
1363840	1368560	pause the interview you'd be quiet just for a week second ac okay my darling what the fuck

1375520	1382720	you hello i already have a pretty a previously good experience with the investor and from that day i
1382720	1390240	always had a good impression of her so when i heard of the plans she was making i wanted to take
1390240	1398560	part of it so much because i knew i'd feel safer under her wing and the concept of vealor i'm trying
1399360	1406880	just to appeal the last to me being an indie was also very lonely to be in a group of girls that
1406880	1413680	are degenerates like me i'm not right though like working all together to reach her dream sounded like
1413680	1421520	the perfect place for me oh that's so lovely ac i'm so glad that you feel comfortable around
1421520	1426640	us all being degenerates okay for the next question my little icicle how important was the
1426640	1433040	amount of freedom that content creation being open with your pl etc was for you it was pretty
1433040	1439600	important it was it make me nervous and overwhelmed if i had to rethink everything i say in fear of
1439600	1448000	getting in trouble for it okay i just like to be comfy and to talk about whatever without worrying
1448000	1453360	about that stuff oh i'm yeah no it honestly it's fine i'm not gonna pretend that you've never streamed
1453360	1458800	before ever in your life okay i'm losing it's almost like i'm losing my mind hearing all these
1458800	1467600	voices um okay uh what platforms did you want to make content on prior being on vealor my little
1467600	1475440	icicle pretty much all of them are the known ones like twitch and youtube and twitter and patreon
1475520	1483600	et cetera all right okay okay what inspired you to create content or just content in general
1483600	1492320	for that matter hold on i need to refresh oh my name is icicle i have always done things on the
1492320	1500720	creative side or have many ideas i wanted to bring to life seeing the things that people would create
1500720	1508320	or do puts a fire in me you know what else is in her today the fucking dad does
1510480	1519520	stop running a train oh my god thank you back to you ac that's far wait hold on what's your
1519520	1527200	voice again it's no pause that's far to want to try and create those things myself everything
1527200	1534320	expires me from music to art to poems to movies to animation god damn ac you pull from a love
1534320	1541600	inspiration um are we sure stroney is a cut official not apparent do you have any advice
1541600	1548960	for other content creators to navigate the field safety be careful with how much you share of your
1548960	1554880	identity it sometimes makes you feel off or uncomfortable oh if something makes you feel
1554880	1560480	off or comfortable don't engage with it and in general just don't do the 18 plus content
1560480	1566400	if you think you might regret it later uh she really said if you're born a slag be a slag
1568160	1576000	ac oh my god right okay uh you might regret later once it's on the internet it's there forever
1576000	1580640	i would only advise going into it if it's something you're very passionate about and should enjoy
1580640	1589280	want to do it long term oh my god ac you're hilarious oh my god right what do you hope to
1589280	1597760	bring or to change in the v-trip and landscape well we've all seen 3d concerts like the big ones
1597760	1604640	where people can watch in person it is my dream to achieve something similar but in a form of a
1604640	1612640	3d 3d dj party with all of the violor oh that's fucking adorable she actually did say this in her
1612640	1620640	application to us um i'd make for such a cool thing to experience with more interaction dancing
1620640	1626800	and lots of fun oh she's so cute she put this in her application i really made it stand out because
1627680	1632480	now if anyone's lurking that just happens to have applied you know there's a lot of reasons
1632480	1637360	obviously again it was like 64 candidates the one model so it wasn't easy but um
1638400	1646160	3d dj party madness no no no no no no no every strongy streamer's like i'll have a viola
1646160	1652480	reading it now um what was this one oh yeah um like some people didn't really have much goals
1652480	1655920	or aspirations etc they're just like i'm just happy to do my thing and i was like that's good
1655920	1660720	and all but it was good to have like a someone come in with like a really strong goal like this is
1660720	1666560	what i want to achieve like she's got something to work towards which is quite nice uh but i say
1666560	1670400	i'm not finished uh asking you the question so what do you want to represent in the v-tribe
1670400	1676080	sphere and just for those of us at home how does your voice go in? tarot polar bear from tarot polar bear
1676080	1681920	it's a bit tough for me to think of that because i don't think there's anything i really represent
1681920	1690080	besides myself oh you're so humble the closest thing i can think of is to represent is being
1690080	1698080	yourself the most authentic version of you is the ideal version the right people will see that
1698960	1705760	in you even if you take some years i had i'm losing it i had many nights where i cry oh
1705760	1711920	hey so what the fuck i had many nights where i cried or was worried that i'm not it's not going to

1730000	1734720	what's one thing you want people to remember about you individually or as a generation

1740640	1753680	whore all of the girls have a lot of personality they are talented they're sweet they're incredible
1753680	1760800	people that deserve to achieve their dream and i also think that it'd be sweet and a bit funny

2083200	2088080	of it was just reposting stuff from one platform to the other to reach a brighter audience okay thank
2088080	2094960	you emmy um but what inspired you to create that kind of content okay what is pl means previous life
2094960	2100960	so um other kind of personas you might have made content under etc like again when you join
2100960	2107280	veal or you get a whole new persona given to you eh what made you inspire inspire to make that kind
2107280	2115920	of content they listened to a lot of blue dot i mean did you actually put on an interview you did
2116640	2123280	well this is published okay i also consumed a lot of erotic literature so i had a lot of fun
2123440	2128000	creating my own scripts too okay that's actually the same i never thought i'd actually be creating it
2128000	2133680	because i naturally sound like the erm actually about t which is the least sexy thing imaginable
2133680	2138000	but that's where the voice acting comes into play i know i i didn't know you voice acted for
2138000	2144560	krema sonic heroes so i mean here we are um is there any content you're particularly interested
2144560	2151760	in making i want to make more art i just have to find the time and energy and some inspiration

2158080	2162720	scotch accent brought you here and this stream is all about not being scotch well i'm just reading

2172800	2177920	become close personal friends with the people that consume your content it just gets too dangerous
2177920	2182720	okay so keep yourself safe please wow you really do sound like krema i know how tempting it is to
2182720	2187840	get close but you're playing with fire what do you hope to change or bring in the v-tubing
2187840	2193360	landscape i mean okay i don't really hope to bring or change anything right out here with the goal

2444480	2450800	to get to know me better while the allure may be uh agency first of its kind in the end i auditioned
2450800	2458800	due to detail's dream resonating with me there are many factors at play as well i was reaching my
2458800	2464560	dreams with my friends those who made it into other corporations so that i could stamp aside them
2464560	2471360	i'm happy to be here oh mercy i'm glad you accepted you could have said no to me you could have said
2471360	2477120	no in the interview and you still said yes thank you mercy how important was the amount of freedom

2538320	2544880	they were and their old fans don't have to go to on hunt i'm a bit of a traditionalist so i still
2544880	2551520	want to keep it on the down low with veal or the freedom with content creation is more lenient
2551520	2558240	and i get to play the games i want and everything is more streamlined for more crucial things don't
2558240	2564480	get it twisted though i still get told no sometimes and that's a little good for me because sometimes
2564480	2571520	my ideas are bad or would be a brand risk oh wait no a bad risk that's why management is there oh
2571520	2576080	thank you mercy for answering that yes i can't believe it you actually got told no when did
2576080	2582160	he tell you no the fuck did we tell you no for i don't even know what platform did you want to

2599520	2608000	in general mercy i used to be an actor i actress whoops i've been unlucky for a lack of better
2608000	2614000	words for a while now i'm probably the most inexperienced of the group as this is my first
2614000	2620880	time really creating that kind of content to me it's a return to form while still exploring my
2620880	2630000	more sensual side haha it's been great fun also a roguet i play a roguet yeah oh wow mercy what the
2630000	2638400	heck is going on in your voice this is making me very gentle um while we're at it mercy do you

2651360	2657920	about how important it is to do your new diligence to keep yourself safe also if you do want to do
2657920	2665280	some if you don't want to do something say no yes that is very true please bring up any issues with
2665280	2671440	any things you might not want to do in an audio with us and make you finding his central side

2677680	2685360	that we are just like any other vtuber agency just with spicier content on the side that content is
2685360	2691680	by choice and if you want to interact with it i hope the taboo of being a not safe or vtuber goes
2691680	2698560	away because in the end like all other vtubers we just want to make you smile and entertain you
2699120	2703520	whoa steady on mercy steady on again you're really getting into the character there um
2704800	2711440	so can you read mario maros in mickey moise's voice as well you want that that's terrible is there
2711440	2717840	anything is there any alt content you're particularly interested in making in mercy mouse
2717840	2724640	mercy mouse i'm still discovering what i like and don't like so i'm exploring all facets of the
2724640	2731760	alternative content i'd like to try experimenting with the medium a little more but we're all we're
2731760	2740080	still in the beginning stages so taking it slow is okay okay but what do you want to represent
2740080	2746560	in the vtuber sphere mercy let us know let us know your thoughts this is a thought-provoking
2746560	2753840	question i suppose that i want to be at least someone who is seen as safe to work with even
2753840	2762000	though i make that kind of content as well i it doesn't define me and means i'm some what
2762720	2769040	it doesn't define me and means i'm some sort of rabid animal that cannot control my urges hot
2769040	2773840	i've losing it i'm actually going schizophrenic right now it was one thing that you want people
2773840	2780880	to remember about you mercy individually or as a generation my laughter and my personality but

2800160	2808320	vtuber history uh to you as a whole i suppose that the debut of hololive english really brought
2808400	2814000	out about the forefront of vtuber into an international audience as a whole it's no longer
2814000	2820160	a medium that is pretty niche it's becoming more and more acceptable i agree with that there was
2820160	2826720	very interesting discourse discord discourse around a year ago that was like vtuber's dying
2826720	2831120	i don't know if people still say that but i don't think people under oh my hands just farted if you
2831920	2838400	because they're sweaty um there was a bit of internet discord sorry mercy thank you so much

2968800	2973040	asked me asking it to her via lures the first agency of this kind she be why did you choose it
2973040	2980080	instead of being an independent as you twerk it's nice having the freedom of being an independent
2980080	2987280	reach over but i longed for a group of people that i could see as sisters and have a a consistent
2987360	2994240	collab partners with similar likes i'd also follow the roadmap of via lures for over a year
2994240	2999680	and shared a lot of the same aspirations as the creative mind behind it all strut stop you're
2999680	3006240	making me blush the fuck the fuck you're making me blush what the heck i also wanted to grow as a
3006240	3011920	creator and learn more about the industry and i couldn't do that without a little bit of help
3012560	3019520	now i have the resources amazing gen mates new knowledge and still manage to have talent freedom
3019520	3024000	i'll stop it you're blowing art you're blowing air up my arse like that i'm gonna get an eagle
3024000	3030240	stroke could these girls have stroke the agency anymore i didn't even direct them they did this
3030240	3038720	themselves okay how in she be was reading the question to herself because uh because good dogs
3038720	3043920	don't speak hey whoa i'm a dog what's going on here are you starting to insinuate so your
3043920	3049280	sponsor ash that's that's how that's how i do a prompt get into the voice okay how important
3049280	3057280	was the amount of freedom on content creation being open to pl etc for you i was ash who twerk i was
3057280	3064560	extremely attracted to the fact that feel lower broke a lot of standard reach over roles but pl
3064560	3071120	discussion wasn't a deal breaker for me also if i went in to sign the contract and felt like my
3071120	3079120	rights as a creator were being taken away um in any fashion i would never have signed on yeah
3079120	3085520	they all say that it's the most pathetic contract i've ever seen uh no matter the agency i do have
3085520	3092800	to say ash out of professionalism i still double checked with my management to ask permissions
3092800	3096480	because it's always good to make sure i mean that's pretty much melted away at this point that was
3096480	3100560	probably right at the start when the girls were unsure how much they're allowed to do
3100560	3106560	but i had to keep reminding the girls like hey you don't need permission go go don't need permission
3106560	3112560	go there can i tweet this go send it as long as it's on the right twitter account send it you
3112560	3117120	don't need permission but this was written a bit earlier so some of the stuff is about me
3118080	3122960	how can you not stroke the agency when instead of working for the agency the agency works for them
3123520	3130160	honestly sorry my glakes have got a fucking me mark on them right ash from pallet time come on
3130160	3135280	no no no ash uh jesse from pokemon come on i can do this i can do this okay and then no more accents
3135280	3143920	okay um ash would work it's really refreshing however to still feel like an indie you'd have
3143920	3149840	a team that has my back and supports me with whatever creative endeavor i've put my silly mind
3149840	3156720	to oh she be stop it my little sheepster's room oh sorry i'm covering up chat sorry sorry sorry chat
3156720	3164000	sorry i'm dumb oh hold on a bit uh what platforms did you want to make content prior to join
3164000	3169600	in v alert so when you were just doing your thing i was always the casual twitch streamer oh not
3169600	3176080	twitch andy and i hoped someday i could go full time adjusting to youtube has been interesting
3176080	3183440	but i don't mind it it's probably funny for me to say but i was never going to do anything
3183440	3193200	my pl like i'm doing now what's that corruption arc yeah you're welcome ash i wasn't going to
3193200	3200080	make a patreon or even consider fansly i see this reincarnation and my previous version of myself
3200080	3209360	as almost two sides of the same coin i can be your angel or your devil it's very cool to learn how
3209360	3215840	other platforms function and how you can develop and expand your audience alongside your main platform
3216720	3224480	oh wait did she see the angle oh my god is that why it was spelled weird i can be your angle or your
3224480	3229360	devil bro i thought i was like why the f*** did she spell it like that but everything else was
3229360	3236720	spelled correctly my dumb ass didn't read it right uh so she stares what inspired just make that kind
3236720	3241280	of content or that content in general just content in general okay it is the meme it's definitely the
3242000	3247680	i can be your angel or your devil uh i've always wanted to be a content creator since
3247680	3255200	watching youtubers like jenna marbles markiplier i'm not even saying that i wanted to have the same
3255200	3261680	positive effect on viewers that watching my favorite content creator had on me and still do
3262480	3269760	as for the erotic content i've always been indifferent about it i have dabbled extremely
3269760	3277760	briefly in the past in the raw and erotic content what it really got nowhere so i never
3277760	3283200	continued with it ash and now i have to learn and improve from the best of the best i'm not

3474880	3482640	talents if they have the profit v tubing is an ever-growing industry and towns deserve a bit more

3489600	3496720	i'll take them the high table with you any day okay what's one thing you want people to remember
3496720	3503600	about you sheepsters individually or as a generation of dealer as a company we're breaking the status
3503600	3511520	quo of what it means to be a corporate vtuber you can allow and manage alternative content
3511520	3518080	you can talk about your pl if you want and you can have a human relationship with your talents
3518080	3527600	instead of treating them like far oh oh tell her is she be like fodder and still be a successful
3527600	3548720	company as a generation a group of girls that just want to have a group of girls that just
3548720	3554720	want to have fun make you happy and we appeal to all if not many in some way shape or form
3554720	3564560	and then you can hire unknown oh that's so cute and and sorry and that you can hire unknown talent
3564560	3574240	there's a few gems out there oh my god i'm gonna agree a few of us were complete nobodies but
3574240	3583440	someone saw our potential no it gave us a chance what the fuck i'm saying no that's so sweet i'm
3583440	3593680	thankful for that as myself your favorite girl failure scuff dorky scuff dorky dog always root

3605840	3612400	oh blow and smoke up your butt is supposed to be our job literally let me repeat that last
3612400	3617840	bit uh you can hire unknown talent there's a few gems no there's lots of gems out there it just
3617840	3625440	ain't easy the problem it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy unhidden gem thinks
3625440	3630240	they're not good enough to apply to vtuber agency don't apply don't get shown off type thing
3631200	3637680	it really can be as simple as that there's like a lot of like i remember we got emailed on the
3637680	3645120	website after closing applications and someone was like i'm so sorry i've missed the window because
3645120	3650240	i didn't feel like worthy enough to apply and it was like bro you missed your deadline if we can't
3650240	3656800	we can't make exceptions but it's like don't hold yourself back seriously the talent pool is massive
3656880	3663200	it is like it's beyond comprehension how many little hidden gems are out there and they just
3663200	3668160	need a running start they just need like that exposure they need someone you know with the money
3668160	3671920	that can be like okay here's shorts right upload them right here's a bit of advertisement money
3671920	3677520	in this here's in that yeah it's a self-propagating issue where the lack of confidence is your work
3677520	3684400	yeah the imposter syndrome yeah and fear of rejection as well as absolutely humongous barrier
3684400	3689200	for some people it really is um you know i'm not gonna sit here and be like oh i don't experience
3689200	3696000	that so i'm not gonna you know be say xyz about it um it is this is a big thing anyway uh sorry

3708240	3714400	a confident dump but that you can still make 18 plus content and still be a normal streamer on
3714400	3721200	common part horrors some have the idea that lute tubers are coomed brain 24 7 and flick their
3721200	3728080	beads on stream and do nothing else haha wait wait would that be like a milk laugh i got uh
3728080	3735280	haha no that's not what the fuck is a milk laugh hold on hold on i'm gonna literally tape in milk
3735280	3741760	laugh on youtube and see if anything comes up uh nope nothing came up well i tried um
3741760	3750160	and what is a milk laugh oh i don't know something like that uh i still act like my dorky self play

3756480	3762400	i moan in your ear on patreon wink wink please support the girls on patreon we're undercutting
3762400	3768080	the fucking mark yet please i'm begging i'm on my knees but i'm begging begging you
3772400	3778800	okay as they're an event in v tripping history that is significant to you my dear sheepsters
3778800	3786400	yes or no the creation of project melody a melody was the catalyst in my opinion of the boom of
3786400	3792320	lute tubers she pushed the boundaries of 18 plus content but still displayed herself as a cute and
3792320	3799520	talented streamer a normal human being but also a friendly vtuber with a unique approach to 3d
3799520	3806960	i can safely say she is a pioneer in not only on say so content creation but audience interaction
3806960	3816160	and streaming and in general thanks thank you melody fantastic thank you so much sheebie
3817520	3826240	for your fantastic okay um right i'm gonna thank you i'm gonna let you go rest because you
3826240	3831600	don't have a stream today question mark i really need to download everyone's things all at once so i
3831600	3835840	can start pulling up and be like right who this is who's coming on the day thank you so much sheepsters
3836160	3837280	up next who we got
3846320	3851120	right i'm interviewing myself let's go right let's go let's go let's get hype hype man look at that
3851120	3858320	look at that design so my design was actually finalized at this stage um kind of as you can
3858320	3863120	see i've got pearlescent if you didn't know i shimmer i don't actually have white on my outfit
3863120	3869200	i'm pearlescent check out wait hold on check out this oh hold on that's my stream deck oh hold on
3869200	3879760	that's the wrong one see i'm all wiggly and pearly essencey okay that's what i look like
3882320	3887680	but i'm scrawny cut oh it's a hypnotic cut of fish that has been streaming for a month and has
3887680	3892160	yet to put out one piece of hypno content other than a live stream uh and i did it for like 40
3892160	3899120	minutes and never did it any longer so obviously the first question did not apply to me vealour is
3899120	3905920	the first agency why did you choose it nope man man's was pre-selected so that question does not
3905920	3912880	apply to me so i had to get creative and give myself an alternative question and i've already
3912880	3919040	lost the damn magazine hold on i have found the magazine okay how did you attract independent
3919040	3925920	v-tubers to vealour is the only question substituted for me okay so first getting our name out there
3925920	3933440	was a challenge but we got incredibly lucky on youtube and the algorithm tapped into the reveal
3933440	3942640	trailer the announcement of vealours all the way back at new years is just shy of 100 000 views on
3942640	3947440	youtube okay and i'm going to discuss that in a short because there's a reason why i got picked up
3947520	3956160	in the algorithm then the vealour website stated what we wanted i cooked on that website okay i set
3956160	3962000	it straight up i said this is the cut this is the expectations there was no oh i don't know what i'm
3962000	3968560	signing up for oh i don't know i don't know no we set it off the bat so the people that did apply
3968560	3973360	knew what they were getting into okay so there really wasn't a struggle like as i said the talent
3973360	3980160	pool was pretty big considering new vtuber agency founding members uh quite a few different rules
3980160	3986720	most vtuber agencies are like eh you didn't have to make content prior to applying yeah they shove
3986720	3992960	your shit in the bin if you don't have any evidence so okay and yet there's people still asking
3992960	4001680	questions honestly that's not i'm wearing marathon runners why yes of course you don't sound like strawny
4001680	4007760	how dare you what you want to make my accent harsher okay so how important was the amount of freedom
4007760	4016080	content discussing pls etc although i confess it's not traditional and may lead to a few people not
4016080	4021920	enjoying what vealour have to offer he'll offer probably i'm no here to pretend that gen one
4021920	4028720	indulges made up of people who have never streamed before is this what you want yeah actually all of
4028720	4034320	the girls had more streaming experience than me this is true so it was quite funny going through
4034320	4040240	applications in that sense it was rather humorous it was humorous okay uh thank you strawny for the
4040240	4047200	next question what platform did you want to make content prior to vealour right youtube has always
4047200	4054000	been a staple for many eyes and i have found overall that their rules are mostly fair bad the
4054000	4060800	bloody uh this this age terribly this age terribly we all have warnings for breathing in an ear
4061840	4069920	anyway twitch however seems to have issues with using rules to punish some but not others it is
4069920	4078560	more of a pick the lesser of two evil situation twitter or x is much more for an overall promotion
4078560	4086480	and connecting with other vtubers for collaborations i'm afraid personally i'm just no suited for
4086480	4093040	twitter outside of that and i'm just i'm shy on twitter what inspired you to create alternative
4093040	4102720	content or content in general i never personally okay had any issues where it's just another media
4102720	4109680	source you either wish to consume it and seek it out or you just deny at all i suppose in my case
4109680	4116480	due to how comfortable i am where i find it quite fascinating to learn about what people enjoy and
4116480	4122320	challenge myself to give them what they want and that's true i like i like when you guys tell me
4122320	4128480	something outrageous and i'm like bet all right let's do it let's do it let's do it we need a scotland
4128480	4133360	forever okay i'll make scrawny say scotland forever at the end of the interview okay um
4133360	4139680	is there any content you're particularly interested in making it in the all alternative version
4140560	4146720	i have always had a secret fascination about hypnosis but i am well aware of the safety concerns
4146720	4155040	that come first it is with this new breath of life that the allure has offered me that i can finally
4155040	4161840	go down this rabbit hole and see what happens this is actually true um i've always enjoyed hypnosis
4161840	4167440	but being absolutely terrified to make it do you have any advice for people who might want to come
4167440	4175760	into safely creating a content of an alternate variety delete everything related to your legal
4175760	4186560	name and social media under it that is rule one okay chase louise from there be on the side of caution
4187520	4193680	now sadly you are an adult and you are responsible for your actions no matter how foolish they may
4193680	4201040	have been in the moment please do not think however you will be the only numpty on planet earth
4201040	4208560	to make a mistake that is only natural so do not be harsh on yourself you will say and do stupid
4208560	4215840	things that is life okay relax no that's serious all right okay thank you started streaming 69 minutes
4215840	4225520	ago i am oh yeah what do you hope to bring to or change in the vtubing landscape on the surface
4226160	4232800	on the surface the answer would be that the western vtuber agencies are those agencies
4232800	4240560	that wish to appeal to these western agencies also understand that comes with culture changes
4241280	4248800	for example more freedoms of course the scottish person says more freedoms you can take my life

4441600	4445840	community i could have easily have been chewed up and spat back out but instead was welcomed with
4445840	4453600	open arms for my curiosity and wanting to learn more it has led to various uh humorous moments
4453600	4460400	such as tisker which is short for tisker it now is being called tisker in my community because
4460400	4464560	i didn't know what it meant and again i didn't know what that so meant and you guys were just so
4464560	4470480	nice and taught me everything um and i think it's because like you know you can uh yeah did you
4470480	4476960	take yeah and fucking okay you're done i still say tisker though literally tisker mentioned any
4476960	4487120	tisker yeah um we say instead of tisker or tskr tisker um is there any significant event in vtubing
4487120	4495120	that is incredibly important to you um the uprising of creator-owned vtuber agencies is upon us now
4495120	4501760	okay um socks agencies a fantastic example yumi plus i think is technically an example
4502560	4507200	um having someone at the helm that has had experience of what and knows what it's like
4507840	4515840	um to produce content and uh knows what to expect is very exciting i can't wait to see more agencies
4515840	4522480	come out that are like that and you never know viola might just collaborate with them i sure it is
4522480	4531760	i hope you're okay yes we are uh it should wink wink but yes um i think creator-owned vtuber
4531760	4537280	agencies are fantastic because they're realistic and like they know what's up they're like i've
4537280	4543280	made content before i know what like kind of strange you're under um kind of like is a split
4544080	4550400	hollow live collab no what i don't have you think i have contacts for hollow live the fuck
4551280	4556640	the fuck as if we as if they'd even let us collab they'd be like oh those are darties

4841920	4846880	marshmallows um i am going to be reading them off my monitor i'm not gonna have them displayed
4848560	4854400	what was the removed mercy line if you're at liberty to say um she said something about
4854400	4859680	self-deprecating and it was a bit it was a bit on the severe side so i rephrased the sentence
4860320	4865520	to be nicer to herself um she used a phrase that wasn't very friendly but uh i'm not gonna say the
4865520	4869920	exact phrase because that's not very nice but uh yeah i think she'll i'm i'm sure she'll be fine
4869920	4882400	with it um wait what top bottom switch views are bosoms bosoms female female male male male female
4883120	4888960	what the heck you've just blasted right into it uh wait is that what i am
4891920	4897760	i just blasted into it uh it was maybe we'll come you know we'll come back to come back to it okay
4897760	4903600	uh moment i love you replaying i love you did you like me doing all the impressions it's a very
4903600	4918560	deep question what are oh hold on right hold on hold on what are some ways companies can
4919600	4926400	companies set up right whoever sent this question one using spell check and two i can't read properly
4926400	4932800	what are some ways companies can set up stuff so the company itself can protect their talents
4932800	4941840	fun set aside for legal concerns taxes content eight screenshots platform liaisons
4941840	4948960	anti anti stuff teaching the ropes um i think just being realistic like if you have been a
4948960	4954320	content creator and then you're behind the scenes you know what the girls are up against like um
4954320	4959040	obviously we shut down the marshmallows for quite a bit because like a few of the talents
4959040	4967120	were having issues and like i guess that was like a measure to basically we took on we got the girls
4967120	4971760	feedback and we were like nah forget this you're done so um and we were like right everyone off
4971760	4975520	marshmallow right now don't reply don't do nothing we're fucked up we made a mistake
4978240	4981040	sure do love when the xbox servers are done have the servers down
4982240	4986960	okay if another idiot comes up with mirrors i'm gonna play doom in real nah
4986960	4991200	ah barely audible oh did i do a tiny little burp there i wasn't paying attention
4992560	4999040	um taxes again don't actually spend the money until you paid the tax you should always hold 30
4999040	5005920	percent back uh i guess if you want tax uh content aid so uh that's like collaborations with people
5005920	5013280	outside of the agency um that's like putting advertisement money in shorts for example so
5013280	5020320	we do something that i don't think any other agency really offers we pay for the shorts to be made
5020320	5026080	for the talents we make the thumbnails for them their schedules all that we try and give them at
5026080	5030640	least stuff possible they're obviously the only overwhelming problem is like i took a while to
5030640	5038320	find the editors and get settled with the editors like um a few of them couldn't do it a few of them
5039200	5044720	uh now currently have ongoing in real life obligations which caused a massive backlog
5044720	5052880	like that's why irisa is my personal clipper because um i was just having so many issues
5052880	5058640	and at the rate the shorts were being made it was like at one point one person was making all the
5058640	5066480	shorts and it was like no that's just not viable at all um but azura is next to get shorts and
5066480	5071200	then shebe's getting a batch and then i think by that point we will have four people who can make
5071200	5076160	clips on at the same time but a lot of in real life stuff happened in their lives which caused a
5076160	5080720	massive backlog and it's caused an issue because i would have wanted a lot more shorts out by now
5081680	5085360	i don't know for me it's a respect thing there are people at least try to treat them as proper
5085360	5092880	human beings and not circus freaks uh communication is key um what are you saying
5093680	5100640	stroney my muse my flame my 16th chapel my 5th sympathy symphony oh god you're making me say
5100640	5106720	big words my cute and adorable seaweed first happy one month happy one month even though it's
5106720	5115120	technically yesterday but happy one month hell yeah um it's been fun and i look forward to many
5115120	5122000	more oh yeah next i want to say i've already been mindbroken to where i can only ink to

5472400	5474080	easter egg in emi's interview
5478080	5484000	is there shut up hold on stop wait a minute is there actually where is it
5487360	5492240	there's an easter egg in emi's interview hold on a minute how do you spot the interview
5492240	5499200	and i don't spot it where's hold on hold on
5501360	5506640	easter egg in emi's interview she used the phrase keep yourself safe kiss your sister where
5507600	5508640	keep yourself safe
5524400	5525920	on the internet safety part
5528000	5531440	don't compare some friends of people consume quite a certain keep yourself safe please
5531840	5539280	i don't i don't actually think that's an easter egg i think that's actually just
5540000	5545520	uh what she meant like genuinely keep yourself safe i don't actually think that's an easter egg
5545520	5549040	because she said please if it was an easter egg it would be keep yourself safe
5551920	5555760	no i think she may or may not have actually actually i don't think that's an easter egg
5557280	5560880	this month was fantastic thank you for everything you did and that you're doing
5561680	5565840	seeing how excited and happy you are makes me feel so good and honestly inspires me oh yeah
5566800	5572720	can you say how can you keep up with everything i think i would die in two seconds um so
5574240	5577760	i basically don't experience what people explain burnout to be
5578640	5582720	and the reason i don't experience it is thanks to autism i don't know how i got lucky with that
5582720	5588400	kind of autism but i did um i basically now don't get me wrong i can get frustrated and fatigued
5589200	5594720	but when i go to bed and then when i wake up it's like a fresh new day like let's go again
5594720	5600720	and one of the best things that i am able to do is i say to myself as long as i do one thing a day
5601280	5605680	so after i finish stream i say to myself i'll do one thing a day if that's editing an audio
5605680	5611280	collab if that's you know writing a script collab or something like that um as long as i do that
5611280	5617280	then you know we're on the up and up that's all i need to do um just one thing a day um maybe i can

6534160	6540640	where would you like to time travel the past or the future unfortunately i'm a woman so the past
6540640	6544960	probably isn't that good but the future seems pretty gloom so i'll stick right here in this timeline
6545040	6552560	uh uh you know born too late to see something born too early to see the future born in the same
6552560	6561440	timeline the strony calls a hungry jacks or mackers uh i get the absolute a screaming
6562080	6567760	shite so if i get mackers for some reason so hungry jacks it is for some reason mcdonald's
6568320	6576240	uh breakfast i can eat but if i eat anything else off the menu it makes me have a lava flow
6576240	6577120	yeah rip

6597200	6604160	the west side bit um and then you get uh sausage and cheese and bean pastry and you get the apple
6604160	6609920	juice that's what i used to get from gregs i don't like any other their bakery stuff like the sweet
6609920	6615520	stuff it's always rubbish we die on this hill no i don't i don't like the grill i like the sausage
6615520	6623520	and beans i really like beans though beans what is the wildest fantasy you've ever had um so there's
6623520	6630320	this concept called the asmr booth and it's it's growing arms legs it has hair it's probably got
6630320	6638160	brain cells at this point um basically i get to tingle you in person and put a mask on you and
6638160	6644640	like uh the joke is like you buy the premium pass at like a convention and then like i put you in the
6644640	6651200	soundproof booth with me and then things get out of hand really quickly okay um i've already wrote

6774400	6781440	uh what is the most embarrassing moment in all your childhood a projectile vomited in public
6781440	6785680	but it actually humbled me to the point where like i don't feel embarrassed going in public
6786640	6793920	like about anything if you have ever been so humbled to projectile vomit right with no privacy
6793920	6801280	then uh yeah it turns out you don't really get scared of going outside have i ever been arrested
6801280	6807920	oh just because i'm scotish i and i didn't sound posh you think i've been arrested and in trouble
6807920	6815920	with the polis well i don't know i've never been arrested uh but the polis are right arseholes
6815920	6821440	honestly um hello what's going on we're doing what's called a q&a on marshmallow and you can
6821440	6827520	ask anonymous questions hitting the bed hitting a bit what hitting a bed yen is something like
6828560	6836000	that would be a yes no i've been arrested are you joking uh can you give chat a smooch a smooch
6836000	6844400	pack her up did you like that
6848320	6855120	have the talents discussed uh in uh alternative collab audios yes uh next month is when the
6855120	6861360	first alternative collabs come out um it is a tip please understand that some of the girls have
6861360	6867920	only just started doing solo audios so to already jump into a collab audio is quite a high stretch
6867920	6872160	so please don't be weird and like this is so disappointing you think that's gonna be the only
6872160	6881600	one they'll ever make please i'm gonna i'm gonna throw up an anger shadow box and over here okay
6881600	6889200	rip i'm on speakers i'm so sorry please lower your volume of me that was uncalled for i think my
6889200	6895040	heart beat went up all of a sudden why is it that round pizzas come in square boxes for transport
6895040	6902560	mains um if you have a square box sitting on a car seat for example um it is more likely to stay
6902560	6907440	put and stay steady so transport much easier yes yes but if it was a circle imagine that thing rolling
6907440	6912720	around in the back seat get in that thing would be trashed by the time it got delivered um or you
6912720	6918880	took it back home if you go and pick up your what the fuck is that noise oh it's my chair sorry my
6918880	6928960	chair sorry i'm fucking out of my heart attack there we need good boys we need good um sorry this
6928960	6936640	one's i need to read it first before i say it i'll go that's so specific i don't think i can answer
6936640	6940400	that because it's related to the girls tea did you guys ever decide whether you're gonna use
6940480	6946480	bansley or not uh the girls can stream on it this month uh if they want to smile um i'm not
6946480	6952480	stopping them i need to give them their login details uh but i have never i don't have any i
6952480	6956240	don't know i'll let them figure it out and then i'll call for what they do because i actually have
6956240	6964720	never used the streaming service uh vealer has made me think about getting into v-tube and what
6964880	6971040	advice would you give someone delete all that shit delete every lick of your legal name online
6971040	6976560	delete every lick of a photo that you are not putting out delete delete everything uh don't
6976560	6983360	tell your parents that you're earning money um or your family that you're earning money uh just in
6983360	6989520	case they turn on you i've had so many horror stories of um girls telling me they told their
6989520	6995280	family they earned money and now they're in a horror situation where like they're the breadwinner
6995280	7002480	the family type thing a it's different if you want to offer the money but get in delete yourself
7002480	7015280	you literally made a short um did i make a short what do you think your last words will be um
7016240	7023440	um to be honest i'm probably gonna be dementia shitting myself in a care home uh so i'm not
7023440	7028160	really gonna i'm probably a mumbling mess i'll probably be like ah back to scotland i go well
7028160	7035280	wait no i'll die in scotland so i'll already be on it uh it'd probably be like oh that was fun
7035840	7041200	if i if i was coherent it would be that was fun like do you know how ridiculous it is and how

7780960	7786480	all the girls hit 10 000 subscribers i'm going to contact a company and see if they will entertain
7786480	7796720	it the problem with trying to get uh a collaboration is they need we need to provide evidence of sales
7796720	7804240	for them to even bother with what we're gonna ask for so i'm gonna wait until we're all 10 000
7804240	7810240	subscribers i don't know if we're gonna get a shared one that might be the only way where all
7810240	7820560	our faces are on the same package um but if we do get it the girls will be releasing a free public
7821120	7828080	audio that would complement this unique merchandise we may or may not get
7828880	7837520	uh but you will be eating good either way okay a shared one for sharing well no really but yeah
7837520	7843280	they need to see a potential return yes so i think it's a bit too premature for lack of better words
