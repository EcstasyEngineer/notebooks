I didn't want Azura to know what

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
shaggagans were up to

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,280

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,840
thank you will this

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,720
poon will this poon

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
for the extended membership will this

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,040
poon

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm definitely not saying that right

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,040
okay so I have zero xp and my xp bar

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,040
for drawing so what we have to do in

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,680
order to get it to work right is

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,880
um show a picture which

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,520
uh yep that's not correct where the

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
fuck did the picture go

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
sorry I'm dumb

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,360
so I made oh no it's really big

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,520
um I don't know why it's really big

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,040
please relax uh so the problem is I

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,520
can't draw and that's okay I can

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
admit it it's not a big deal that I

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,840
can't draw so I had to make a reference

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
okay and a reference is really normal

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,960
to use but the problem is the reference

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,720
had to be me so you're getting a white

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,640
women jump scare okay you're getting a

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,520
white women jump scare but the artwork

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,400
that we're drawing is a zero as a giant

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,720
test

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,720
that's the artwork

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,880
I used myself as a reference so we're

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,200
drawing a zero as a giant test and this

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,280
is not going to come out ever once it's

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,960
to go but it's fine it's fine so I had

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,320
to basically set up my camera so it was

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
on the floor so I was like doing a step

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
in motion on it and then I had to set it

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,560
up so I was like oh no don't crush me oh

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,640
no so there you go that's that's totally

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,400
not me to use as a reference I'm just

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
gonna pull it up on my other screen as

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,920
well so I can look at it

64
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,400
I don't know how this is gonna go

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,920
don't don't think this is gonna be mlg pro

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,880

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,200

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,400

heads shoulders knees and toes knees oh

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,520

fuck right this is not tracing would be

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,080
so much easier should I just straight up

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,520
but if I I can't trace it because it's

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,880
gonna be like how do I send it to her

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,280
because this is ms paint doesn't have

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,520
layers unless you want me to raw dog

96
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,480
trace it from obs potentially yes hold

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880
on wait hold on this is not gonna work

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,120

work wait maybe I can do the stencil of

102
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,120

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,120
this will work or this will be the worst

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,640

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,280
the hand

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,640
okay and then we'll do the anime fingers

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,520
where they're like together but not okay

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,880
hold on ms paint has layers now shut up

113
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,720
the world's dumbest hackathon would it be

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,520
funnier if it was really scuffed though

115
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
wouldn't that be what everyone wants to

116
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,600
see

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,600

that okay right no we're not doing that

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,960

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,480
ms paint has layers let's do new no I

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,000

138
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,960
try so you're pretty much on your way

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,600
there

140
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,480
should I just go for it I think that's

141
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,880
what the charm of it would be is that

142
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,760
it's like yeah it's scuffed but it's me

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
I made it with love a hand drawing is

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,480
much more personal do it you can do it

145
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,120
okay I'm just gonna go for it so head

146
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,480
first

147
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,920
and then her horns I didn't realize how

148
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,200
much her horns and then don't worry

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,680
we'll go like over the other details

150
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,280
type thing that's not very symmetrical

151
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
is it

152
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,840
and then her wee ears would come out

153
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
and before anyone's like what do you mean

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,920
her ears yes those are her goat ears

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,120
for she is a goat got it

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,600
and that's really beautiful pin it on the

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
fridge thank you dad I appreciate that

158
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,320
uh right and then in the reference my

159
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
boobs are like coming up so wouldn't

160
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,720
as there's tits literally be like this

161
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,880
in the fucking shot how do you do

162
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,520
perspective

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
I have an idea I've got an eagle I'm just

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,280
going for it wing it and then she'd

165
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
have a big fucking massive knockers

166
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,480
right oh this is not gonna work

167
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
I don't know how perspective work and

168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
before anyone asked no I can't rotate

169
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
an apple in my head I can't do anything

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,760
in my head it doesn't work like that

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,080
right fucking shoulder would be here

172
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,800
and then it would come down and then it

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
would come over

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,080
oh my god

175
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,640
I was gonna send her this and talk to her

176
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,160
on stream after I was done oh my god

177
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,680
oh my god

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,320
oh my god if they're just hit 10k

179
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,280

180
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,680
but did she actually that's fantastic

181
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,240

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,360
heart said move the fuck out we want

184
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,320
that ASMR

185
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,440
oh my god

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,880
okay

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,160
who knew art could be so hard like

188
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,400
actually right she's got massive jibbly

189
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,200
okay so one jibbly-bibbly here and a

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,720
second jibbly-bibbly here and then she's

191
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
got fried eggs the way my dad describes

192
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,040
it and then it's like a strap all the way

193
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,320
up the worst part is there's an

194
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
artist she's gonna you recognize how

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,760
like scuff this is i'm sorry is there

196
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,080
i didn't mean to i've tried my best do

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,240
that do that and then it goes up onto

198
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
her shoulder strap right and then it's

199
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
like gold plated so it would have to

200
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,680
have like this extra bit here right and

201
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
then her ears have a little gold plate

202
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,560
on them because she's she's majestic

203
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,800
i'm so crazy okay and then

204
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,080
she'd have one i don't know how to draw

205
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,000
perspective like that i genuinely don't

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,920
fuck it let's just draw the foot

207
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
let's just draw the foot first okay so

208
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,440
that's my toe and that's my other toe

209
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,240
then that's a third toe this is another

210
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,840
one so ma wee pinky toe like it's stuck

211
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,480
to my ring toe does that make sense

212
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
it's not stuck like i can move it but i

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
would have to like flex it to move it

214
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,520
and then one more right and then the

215
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,440
foot the way the foot works it kind of

216
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
comes out but then it goes in to get

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
skinny and then it goes out and then gets

218
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,080
big again oh no it doesn't sugar it

219
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
doesn't work like that hold on go back

220
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
hold on reverse it right so the foot does

221
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,760
go around but at the toe it goes like out

222
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,280
and then it goes in oh my god hold on a

223
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,200
minute we might be able to save this if

224
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,040
we use the foot to cover up half of her

225
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
body

226
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,240
we might be able to save this we might be

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,840
able to save this okay and then we need

228
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,120
her her like leg slash knee

229
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
and then

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
oh no i do this sounds like they will

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,840
it shouldn't oh see if her leg was like

232
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
that i would have to like cut up like that

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,200
and you see her fanny

234
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,160
from my perspective i think i would have

235
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,240
to move her foot over her jibblies

236
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,960
or would it be funnier if i left the

237
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,200
anatomy absolutely terrible because i

238
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,320
don't know how to do the anatomy

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,800
ooh that might be funnier

240
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,120
if the anatomy is scuffed i think it

241
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,920
makes it even funnier

242
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,880
so in theory if her leg had to come up

243
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,760
it her crotch would be visible so that's

244
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,000
like her butt cheek yeah it would be like

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,560
her butt cheek and then up and but then

246
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,600
what does she wear on her abdomen again

247
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,920
you think i was me they're designer no

248
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,680
honestly i was there for the fucking

249
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,920

250
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,600

251
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,280
honestly you think i was me sitting being

252
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,200

253
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,360

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,280
is there a

362
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,200
splat

363
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,280
cartoon fatal maybe we can put in some

364
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,560
dialogue to make it an anime oh wait no

365
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,720
we might need to make them a bit can we

366
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,000
get much higher so right okay i'm not

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,360
mad at this base so what we're going to

368
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,960
do we're going to fix this hand because

369
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,720
i'm taking the pis s with that okay so

370
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
first let's fix the hand and then we'll

371
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,840
fix to the head area okay so let's get

372
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,320
rid of the shoulder being like that uh

373
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,680
she can keep her fried eggs that's fine

374
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,120
i think

375
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,840
her her arm would come down like this to

376
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,360
like stabilize herself maybe

377
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,520
let's let's see so no that's like a

378
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,600
sausage don't draw is there a sausage

379
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,600
okay one two three and then maybe she's

380
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,960
like kind of holding her head oh yes

381
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,960
that's very logical yeah okay maybe not

382
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,920
so big on that part okay not so big on

383
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,480
that part and then give it like a little

384
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,280
detail like a little bump to do a line

385
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
there it kind of shows that the the arm

386
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,880
is like coming out to make sense

387
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,600
okay do it given to the bootlegation

388
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,360
no she's not got a boot up it's got a big booty

389
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,400
you can see a booty big booty big booty

390
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
okay so yeah that's even better and then

391
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,520
this one it implies maybe she's like

392
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,440
holding her thigh from the top so you

393
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,040
can't see it right we definitely need

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,200
to fix the face though because that is

395
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,320
that's rough that's rough

396
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,880
right so let's remove the head

397
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,000
because we're gonna put the anime face

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,040
on her so that so as there is like okay

399
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,120
that already to me looks better i don't

400
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,480
know maybe i'm just going to get sprenic

401
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,160
because i'm like oh my god anything to do

402
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,800
is better than the original thing so she

403
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,320
got a very symmetrical face but you wouldn't

404
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,560
know unless you really looked her she has

405
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,600
a lot of hair that actually covers like

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,240
so much detail on her face but it's no

407
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,080
problem like it's just her design type

408
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,560
thing

409
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,800
and right eyes are always like halfway

410
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,800
down so her eyes should start like y'all

411
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,680
uh like anime at me give me oh no wait no

412
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,840
you're a goat

413
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,200
why is she like so feral

414
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:15,800
oh i just realized the reference is in the

415
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,200
way

416
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,440
maybe i move that over just a little bit

417
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,000
but she's like oh i'm about to kill you

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,800
oh

419
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,680
that's supposed to be the sound effect i

420
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,960
tried i tried

421
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,640

then you flip it oh yeah mm-hmm this

444
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,440

445
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,720
and then oh don't whatever that was

446
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480

450
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,160

454
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,120

please step on me mommy let's do that

461
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,400
and then we'll rotate it

462
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,720
okay we'll move we'll move them along

463
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,880
a bit once i'm finished making her

464
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,760
face a bit better

465
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,280
and one talented girl why did you have

466
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,240
to draw the feet she's a giant tess

467
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,840
come on giant tess is all about the feet

468
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,280
it's all about getting panzeried it's

469
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,520
all about just going cave diving you

470
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,320
know

471
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,200
are being squished

472
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,280
uh i'll make an indication that she's

473
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,480
like a billion centimeters tall as well

474
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,320
right okay her hair is kind of like it

475
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,280
goes quite big like here as well too

476
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,840
um but she also has like a front pump

477
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,800
like this and then she has her jewelry

478
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,240
but it also like comes over her face

479
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,960
and outwards in this direction as well

480
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,760
and over her horns like she's got a really

481
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,560
good fucking design sorry i'm biased but

482
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,040
i love my daughters i'm so fucking biased

483
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,480
i don't care what anyone's like i'm so

484
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,320
biased right actually we're gonna have to

485
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,600
extend the side bit a bit more to kind of

486
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,080
cover up the attachment of the ears to her

487
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,640
head i think if people realized how the

488
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,880
goat's ears were attached to her head

489
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,240
they'd be like oh but it's like she

490
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,600
doesn't have human ears she's a more

491
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,720
fucking goat right and then her hair

492
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,520
gets big it comes out as well like a

493
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,760
little bit and then a big bit and then a

494
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,200
wee bit again and then a wee bit and then

495
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,440
a wee bit a big bit a wee bit and then a

496
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,760
wee bit again and then her hair actually

497
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,920
a lot of people don't know this her hair

498
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,160
extends all the way down past her butt

499
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,080
and but you don't get to see it too much

500
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,760
just because obviously you'll never guess

501
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,920
what her feature remodels are all

502
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,040
uh you know because that's how long it is

503
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,160
but yeah she got super long hair super long

504
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,560
okay we'll start coloring in yeah right

505
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,800
i'm happy with that if you are we'll do

506
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
like the classic like anime shading

507
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,960
under the chin i think i think you know

508
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,120
for yeah it needs some you know it needs

509
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,360
improvement and stuff but you know what

510
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,920

mad at that let me get let me take out the

512
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,200

to close her mouth off sorry that was me

645
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,520
having oversight okay uh i'm pretty sure

646
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,880
when you draw anime modes you have to like

647
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,920
go a bit lighter and then purposely do a

648
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,880
bit darker at the back of the mouth

649
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,520
let's do that we're like artists out here

650
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
okay we aren't half ass and this shit

651
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,920
okay no not like that how about we zoom in

652
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,320
to really get this pixel perfect and then

653
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,800
the back of the mouth has like shade to it

654
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,360
see see okay and then as there's eyebrows

655
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,560
are a dark brown but not that dark hold on

656
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,920
me me me and a boom all right and then

657
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,040
her skin tone is much lighter

658
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,240
it's actually got a bit more vibrant color

659
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,440
in terms of orange in the skin tone

660
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,160
you accidentally colored the left ear how

661
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,720

662
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,160

663
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,000

664
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,640

665
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,960
right let's make her wait no that's not

666
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,600
what i said that's not what i said and

667
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,880
then fix that bit on the ear

668
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,360
actually we're just gonna manually take

669
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,400
away this line by doing that okay and

670
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,040

746
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,440
i want oh hold on it needs to be free

747
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
it needs to be pixel perfect thank you

748
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,320
math for the extended membership and

749
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,640

750
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,840
i appreciate it i hope you enjoy right

751
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,960
toe ring we're just going straight for it

752
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,320
i don't think there's anything in

753
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,360
particular that needs done for a toe

754
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,840
ring in my humble opinion not that i

755
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,440
know

756
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,160
let's see let's have a little zoom out oh

757
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,800
oh not bad oh we're missing something

758
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,960
here it looks like a skin tone i would

759
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,160
say that skin hold on hold on zoom in

760
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,440
so analize right you get filled in you

761
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,440
get filled in right now what we need to

762
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,800
do is do the shading what's drawing you

763
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,240
gonna do shading yes i'm going to do

764
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,000
shading what the fuck i said erase

765
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,600
why did you do that i don't know i'm

766
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,440
sure whatever uh right fill in that and

767
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,960
then to do shading literally just take

768
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,640
the color and then just do it a little

769
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,880
bit down that's it that's all you have to

770
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,800
do if you want and then we'll do the

771
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,760
we have to do it like pixel perfect though

772
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,840
because there's always shading like under

773
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,320
the neck and stuff and then we need to

774
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,960
shade her big mobility jubilee as well

775
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,640
mmm i bet you want to be that pixel

776
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,480
right there don't yeah you dirty i i

777
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,920
bet you do yeah i think i confused the

778
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,600
girls in my scots today i felt a bit

779
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,000
bad i was like that was having fun though

780
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,160
like that was such a hit in a hauler i

781
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,560
love when we get together

782
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,400
oh i missed i took out oh i took out another

783
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,760
pixel hold on i don't want to take it too

784
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,920
many pixels okay let's just shade this in

785
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,960
okay shaded that'll do and then like

786
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,760
we'll kind of take it here and then this

787
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,080
the light will get up no i guess the light

788
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,240
sources i don't know where the light

789
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,200
sources okay i don't know what we'll just

790
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,040
we'll just pretend the light source is

791
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,200
coming from over here okay so light

792
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,840
sources here so that means we have to

793
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,400
like put so much detail in her feet and

794
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,600
stuff okay boom and then like we would

795
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,720
shade like in between her toes and shit

796
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,840
no i mean yes but no

797
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,880
oh no having to shade in between the

798
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,240
toes how diabolical right let's really

799
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
get let's get in on them grippers okay

800
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,960
there we go we're like pixel perfect on

801
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,880
these grippers right now right so

802
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,800
everyone would technically have like a

803
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,920
little bit here okay if the source is

804
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,320
from over there oh no it'll be shadowed

805
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
really because she's about to stomp on

806
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,240
you like don't think into too much so

807
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,720
because this band is here it technically

808
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,200
would start at the band and then

809
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,320
then agree like come and agree over here

810
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
you know for someone who doesn't draw i

811
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,920
sure do come out with a lot of stuff off

812
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,520
the top of my head about it

813
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,280
like i'm pretty sure this is not how

814
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,760
shading works but i'm gonna do it anyway

815
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,920
when did i ever let my lack of knowledge

816
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,200
do anything

817
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,880
real and true real and motherfucking true

818
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,080
ah right don't do that

819
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,800
eh even shading stop i'm getting

820
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,480
bullied by this right no why do i keep

821
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,760
messing up look right enough one two

822
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,080
three i'm just drawing downwards now

823
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,480
right there we got her shading and i'll

824
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,040
do a little bit that way and then because

825
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,440
this is like the fold of the toe it

826
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,960
should technically have like shading

827
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,280
right uh surely one of you guys are

828
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,040

gullibles in the dictionary so we're in

846
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,600

we're doing it sorry but the shading is

854
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,080
helping it's like bringing it's making a

855
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,760
3d

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,440
her boobs are popping out the screen

859
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,640
right now right her arm

normal i would have sure she's in there

864
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,520
her ears would cast a slight shade

865
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,680
nothing major but her ears do cast the

866
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,800

they were like why are you saying it

872
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,560
penalized and i'm like because that's how

873
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,000
you do it apparently it's penalized

874
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,160
in the united states of america

875
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,560
we've been penalized by the system right

876
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,800
spell penis right now and then spell

877
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,480
penalized and then tell me what the

878
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,400
difference is okay tell me what the

879
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,000
difference is because you can it's

880
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,160
literally just penalized penis fantasize

881
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,320
okay her boobs would cast a shadow on her

882
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,360
arm as well okay hold on i need to get

883
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,840
rid of this line that shouldn't be there

884
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
there we go that's right open up that tit

885
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:56,920
revenue

886
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,400
it's revenue what a unique what a unique

887
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,680
vocabulary you possess thank you

888
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,480
thank you thank you yes yes why yes of

889
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,360
course okay shading they'd probably be

890
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,200
shading on oh sorry the prop no they'd

891
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,200
probably be shading here i don't mind if

892
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,040
i take some pixels out but if i start

893
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,960
taking out like the black outline of the

894
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
pixel that's when it's like becoming a

895
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,000
problem because you're taking away the

896
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,400
masterpiece it's okay the british way is

897
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,040
the only correct way thank you okay so

898
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,240
let's see what the skin looks like now

899
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,480
good good good we've got a little shade

900
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,000
different areas and stuff um her arse cheek

901
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,160
definitely let's zoom in real quick let's

902
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,960
zoom in our hair would cast a shadow

903
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,160
over her face and stuff

904
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,520
definitely like here oh my god no right

905
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,160
no see when i start getting inaccurate

906
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,880
and the pixels start ruining my masterpiece

907
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,120
that's it that's when i'm leaving remember

908
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,240
that time i won twice and go

909
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,000
remember that time i add a member

910
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,240
remember that time my ancestors heard my

911
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,920
plea don't make a fool did you add her

912
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,720
tattoo no thank you for reminding me

913
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,160
though

914
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,760
uh i guess the shadow would only tiny

915
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,400
tiny tiny up here there wouldn't be much

916
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,200
of a shadow cast at that point i don't

917
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,160
think you do maybe here shadow cast

918
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,800
because of this bit of hair yeah i can see

919
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,960
that and then it would kind of stop once

920
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,120
it gets really close to her face it

921
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,160
would pretty much look let's fix this

922
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,600
little bit yeah good

923
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,440
um right her markings are light purple on

924
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,480
her nails oh my god that's matt azura

925
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,520
that's my daughter right there i love you

926
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,200
i love you and you're gonna make everyone

927
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,480
so happy and so proud of you and you don't

928
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,560
know it yet you're just a little boy either

929
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,360
there we go that's my daughter and she

930
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,200
also has a mark on her thigh but you

931
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,320
wouldn't see it from this angle right

932
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,760
and then next we're gonna we're gonna

933
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,800
do ass shading how just how much shade

934
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,880
does this ass need okay so maybe it would

935
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,560
be like a line to really show how

936
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,520
down with the thickness she is and then

937
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,720
so i'm like trying to pretend i know how

938
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,760
light sourcing works i don't what if you

939
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,120
like a weird circle

940
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,920
i don't know maybe it would actually be like a you like

941
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,000
like because it obviously is underneath and we are ignoring the laws of gravity

942
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,280
and physics i don't know what one

943
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,280
shading is like what law is but since we're okay

944
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,200
okay let's i think this wouldn't be

945
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,840
entirely inaccurate it's a little like she

946
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,720
shot herself no no um yeah that's kind of how

947
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,840
shadows work that's kind of how shadows

948
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,960
work hold on let's see it looks yeah and

949
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,640
then it would maybe be a little bit here

950
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,840
hmm look i'm not hating it i don't care

951
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,040
when i was this i ain't hating i'm i'm here for a good time

952
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,520
if you don't look at the face it's actually not that bad

953
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,560
okay and then this would just kind of have a little

954
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:59,160
slithering section take it there do there and then just go around

955
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,480
oh wait no i can just fill it in once i've closed it hey there we go boom

956
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,480
see uh i do see a bit of that a little bit of this a little bit of that

957
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,040
how would you like some of this on your that yeah right next we are going to

958
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,880
still shade her skin oh my god artists no wonder you guys charge so much this

959
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:28,920
takes fucking forever this is a joke right her fingers are on top of the

960
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,120
her little hip here so they would go like this

961
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,360
oh my god i'm not putting nail polish on

962
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:45,880
so this is to show like yeah it's not it's not perfect but it doesn't have to

963
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,040
be yeah you don't have to judge yourself so harshly darling

964
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,400
and then her thumb is behind the thigh that's why you only see one of them

965
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,520
we'll just kind of pop that in there clear up a bit

966
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,920
the face still needs a nose nah you don't do a nose for anime

967
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,880
what you want this

968
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,200
like anime noses are like that and nothing more

969
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,480
um oh god i forgot her jewellery headband

970
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,840
look look she'll forgive me okay she'll forgive me right let's show that this

971
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:35,480
hair is behind so the hair that's behind kind of gets a shadow cast on it here

972
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,360
i don't know how shadows work on hair on anime here

973
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,160
i don't know how it works on anime here this is something out of my pay grade

974
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,400
um i don't know how it works on here maybe we just skip the hair part

975
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,800
if maybe we just focus on the face shadow how about that that's important but right

976
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,160
if only i had an artist to actually do this

977
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,480
um

978
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,480
but for certain what is the face that is on i should know you know what

979
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,520
how did they didn't work in here i don't know i'm just gonna throw it around the place where

980
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:43,000
i think it belongs i'm gonna get belong over here nope i might do this little thing over here why not

981
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,480
not yeah why not why not and then like it would have a big bit back here

982
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,920
that seems a bit right

983
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,960
that seems a bit right oh god it's stunning

984
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,560
uh sure it should have a little bit over here why not

985
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,480
oh i'm like completely destroying the outline

986
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,440
um

987
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:20,120
there you go and then a shadow would be cast here because of the hair and the lake source

988
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:28,760
not so much around these parts okay and then what next

989
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,720
i mean if we're gonna get really technical bing and boom oh nope bing and boom right

990
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:46,440
next shade the purple yes yes i shade the purple and then i think we're done

991
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,960
i have boobalicious my money

992
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,760
i wish i could help but my skill points are negative honestly need to

993
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,040
i'm just letting the wheel be taken i'm just gonna do like a big swoop up her foot

994
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,160
and do that and see what happens

995
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:11,960
all right so that kind of gives like the back of the heels like further away maybe if

996
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:20,440
maybe if i did that no that doesn't look right that's okay that's okay that's okay let's try again

997
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:27,400
try again right her suit definitely her big fucking honkers absolutely her absolutely just

998
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:39,160
thriving her honkers are casting a shadow and then we boop all right uh-huh and then her juicy

999
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:51,000
would also cast a shadow uh-huh uh-huh and then because of the

1000
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:00,040
a rotundness the rotundness of her milkers it would offer a you type shadow over on this side

1001
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,000
which would also be extended on the gold as well so we're gonna quickly just do that on the gold

1002
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,680
we'll offer the same you turn on the gold

1003
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:22,440
uh-huh and then a little kind of uh-huh uh-huh oh come on oh come on just higher menu

1004
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,960
maybe a little bit of cheeky boob on this but

1005
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:36,200
quite really feeling on the ears all right all right mm-hmm okay now what

1006
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,680
did we call it is it done

1007
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,760
did we do it

1008
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:54,440
please step on me mommy that's it i think maybe question mark i think we did it i'm not gonna

1009
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,560
lie i think we uh that took me an hour to do holy shit no wonder ours cost so much give the

1010
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:05,400
knee a little shade oh okay okay okay a little bit shade a little bit tea right let's grab the

1011
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:13,800
purple let's give this knee some definition even if it's just this because i don't know how knees

1012
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:27,720
work i'm just i'm just here okay i'm gonna sneeze okay i'm good all right i oh i forgot the right

1013
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,920
at least let me do the jewels on her head actually her jewels her jewels were like so freaking hard

1014
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,320
to get concert we got so much art back that was wrong but it was because of me that was the problem

1015
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,440
i'm just gonna manually do it like this i'm just gonna manually do it like this i know i know

1016
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,040
it's bad i know and i've missed all the like the her headband and stuff i'm so sorry

1017
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:01,080
oh my god genius i think i maybe need to give her horn some rungs as well

1018
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:08,120
i just need it to be a bit later and then we can kind of yeah

1019
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:19,560
okay all right all right oh we're i don't i don't want to say it but

1020
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,160
look all i'm saying you can hire me you can hire me okay if we're gonna put the blue

1021
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:34,920
blue jewels there we might as well put them on the end of her just a little bit oh fuck her necklace

1022
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:49,960
just when you think you're free okay and then her necklace is literally diamond diamond octagon

1023
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,800
square that's fine i'll do octagon

1024
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:05,720
okay and then the chain would be put together like maybe slightly lighter than that i was like

1025
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,400
yes as i said what i'll do i'm gonna end stream i'm gonna message her and see

1026
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,680
she's got time to for me to very quickly bring her on to be like surprise i drew this with the

1027
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,680
reeflings this is from me and the reeflings um and she'll be like oh my god that's the

1028
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,480
no she won't she'll be very thankful as her is truly lovely i'll hire you but no for

1029
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,400
when are you open up commissions i'll be your first customer honestly oh yeah

1030
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:57,000
it just looks like we got the team version of azura but i like it though like i put my love

1031
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,960
into it and i like it i like how one boob is like far bigger than the other as well really

1032
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:12,280
really goes for the realism um i like it right if you're satisfied on so we started with this as

1033
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:21,800
the reference right and we somehow so that was please step on me mommy and that was the original

1034
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:35,640
reference it's not bad it's not could be worse it's not bad it's trying smoothly

1035
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,640
oh her necklace is held together by purple i don't even realize that hold on analyze

1036
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,560
analyze enhance i'm in

1037
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,440
oh no i think it's a bit darker than that how about that oh maybe it's her horn color

1038
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,120
her neck looks like this

1039
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:12,600
okay let's hold on enhance again i can hardly see the color yellow it's absolute shite so

1040
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,920
there we go that's my baby girl that's my baby girl there she is right

1041
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,240
did i just do the headband

1042
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,440
i think i should do the headband

1043
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,400
right let's just manually do the headband okay so she has diamond

1044
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:51,800
and then she has her symbol because she was a founder of air and then a diamond right

1045
01:00:52,280 --> 01:01:02,920
right and she has this golden plated thing golden plated okay

1046
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:11,000
what's bad as you think it is it's okay if your mind complicates things sometimes as long as

1047
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,720
you're able to work through it that's the main thing there that looks more like my daughter

1048
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:21,480
there we go there we go there we go there we go maybe a little bit brighter maybe maybe a bit

1049
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,200
more of an orange but brighter maybe for for connecting the jewellery

1050
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,280
i'm not going to put detail on the chain though because it's such a small thing it

1051
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:40,680
might actually take away but that is my daughter okay let's let's see come on you know that scissors

1052
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:50,760
from my class right what i'm going to do my darling reeflings i understand today was rather short

1053
01:01:50,760 --> 01:02:00,520
and maybe not the most popular stream concepts however i'm going to redirect into azura

1054
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,720

1106
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,080
thing is i didn't do enough water because it ended up getting boiled down to like pure concentrated

1107
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:40,120
flavor which i don't mind but i think i only have like two servants max oh my god the soup is delicious

fucking cooking in that kitchen i will feed my daughters i am so proud of that chicken soup i

1110
01:08:54,280 --> 01:09:01,240
couldn't believe it i roasted the veggies and i like strained it and all that and i had to add

1111
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:08,200
extra water i think what i did by is technically bouillon it came out amazing i'm like so proud of

1112
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:13,400
myself so so proud of myself i made a fucking mess so that's the only thing um i've still not cleaned

1113
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:20,920
it up i'm sorry it's an absolute mess in my kitchen right now so a riparoni pepperoni but

1114
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:28,440
yes i will take that photo i promise i will um i just had a lot to prepare and tomorrow i'm like

01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:54,200
reefland same as usual there ain't none on me oh the traditional wayfork incoming yeah bouillon

1118
01:09:54,200 --> 01:10:00,280
these nuts also understandable the only reason i hate kicking is the mess literally i'm like i just

1119
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:08,440
kind of yours uh i will say one thing about ordering takeaway order no no stop naughty

1120
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:19,880
the one thing about paying for the exchange of a takeaway is that you can just shove it in the bin

1121
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:26,040
once you're done like there's need cleanup other than a fork or if they provide you a fork then

1122
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,560
literally you don't even have to do that part um but what i'm gonna do next time i get a chicken

1123
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,880
because i think that'll be my dinner for the next two nights i'm gonna get a chicken but i'm gonna

1124
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,520
like purposefully put in four liters because my soup pot has like a litre gauge i put in two liters

1125
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:50,600
um but i'm gonna do four liters this time um and like the vegetables the lentils i had red split

1126
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,960

1130
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,720
maybe minestrone soup i think it's got bacon in it bacon and pasta and tomato base soup and i'm

1131
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,520
like that sounds delicious as well but i might give the chicken soup a few goes until i'm like

1132
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:36,680
really satisfied with it like i didn't boil the potatoes i roasted them in the oven and then

1133
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:42,680
every all the roasted veg went in with the soup and like uh boiled and then brought to a boil and

1134
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,360
then simmered for like another hour and like oh my god all the flavors were like umami i fucking
