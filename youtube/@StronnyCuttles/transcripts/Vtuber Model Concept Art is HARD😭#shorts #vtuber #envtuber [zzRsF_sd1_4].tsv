9440	12640	attempts to become the cuttlefish you know and recognize today.
12640	16640	Yes you are allowed to laugh, this was literally my first draft.
16640	22320	I quickly was developed to be a cuttlefish early on but I took a very splatoonly
22320	25120	vape which wasn't quite what I wanted.
25120	29280	Then from this outline you can actually see my shape and pupils are already in place
29280	31280	which is amazing.
31280	36240	Then a big switch-up happened and I was drawn in a yukata with permanent swirl eyes
36240	39920	which was later changed into my classic cuttlefish pupil eyes.
39920	44480	Then finally we arrived at my pearlescent design and I am none other than
44480	46960	Strony Cuttles at your service.
