21000	26000	Is it time to feel sleepy?
26000	30000	Like how are you playing?
33000	37000	Are you sleepy, baby?
42000	47000	You're so cute when you're so sleepy
48000	52000	and you got your little morning voice on
53000	57000	but it's time to go back to sleep
58000	62000	Thank you Dominic for becoming a mempa
64000	70000	Good morning little reflin, but you must be so tired
71000	74000	You should go back to sleep
75000	78000	Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
78000	81000	Yes, you should go back to sleep
83000	87000	Cos you're my tired baby
95000	100000	What do you mean you've never seen my bedroom since debut?
100000	110000	You're such a sleepyhead, of course you've seen my bedrooms and staples.
110000	118000	You want me to tuck you in, in my little clam?
118000	124000	My little clam bed, behind me.
124000	134000	It's going to be not in my clam.
134000	142000	Do you like the way the water wiggles in my bedroom?
142000	152000	Do you find it tantalizing?
152000	158000	My little reflex.
158000	174000	Look, I have a little 3D on my desk and I have one in front of me too.
174000	180000	Do I need to turn up to make sense of the video?
180000	186000	Or have I been a good streamer?
186000	190000	Yeah, do you like my decorational wall?
190000	196000	I really have two things I can click.
196000	200000	Okay, you're on my table.
200000	216000	I'm applying your Risky.
216000	220000	Refling.
220000	224000	Why is it when I go on YouTube,
224000	234000	my most recent short of me clapping with no hands, is my most popular content?
234000	246000	What did you do?
246000	262000	What did you do?
262000	266000	Hey girls, it's my most popular content.
266000	272000	I think I even outpaced the video.
272000	280000	Yeah, I'm not apologizing.
280000	286000	Thank you to the doubter who made that clip possible.
286000	294000	Arissa is my editor and she's hilarious.
294000	298000	We haven't really spoken to each other at all
298000	302000	and I just sent her an audio of me clapping and she said,
302000	304000	yeah, I'll make it a short.
304000	314000	I'm like, yeah, Arissa is a homie for sure.
314000	326000	Oh, you look so sleepy.
326000	340000	You look so sleepy like this, I just want to eat you up all for myself.
340000	346000	And you get all cute and whiny when you're tired as well.
346000	350000	Little boy.
350000	358000	Is it hard to fight the temptation to fall asleep again?
358000	368000	Especially when I rub on your ears.
368000	380000	I made a little cup of tea.
380000	386000	Go by hands all over your ears.
386000	394000	And it's going ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
394000	396000	Wow.
396000	402000	Thank you, Dr. Milmi Naman.
402000	406000	Wanna swim more, please?
406000	410000	For becoming a member.
410000	418000	We have been strong and there's a brief stream after this one I need to be a week for.
418000	424000	Do you know what we're writing about in that naughty stream?
424000	430000	We're writing about making honey tea.
430000	434000	And by making honey tea, I mean honey and tea.
434000	440000	So you guys get to tell me what you want me to say.
440000	446000	So I think I'll be very interested in how am I feeling?
446000	450000	Ah, my sleepy baby.
450000	456000	The reason why I'm role-playing that you're a sleepy baby so successfully
456000	462000	is because I woke up seven minutes before stream.
462000	468000	But my little wreathling.
468000	472000	I did get some sleep, darling.
472000	478000	I got lots of progress behind the scenes done.
478000	482000	If I'm not mistaken.
482000	488000	If, hold on, I need to check if it's even up.
488000	492000	I got lots of background work done.
492000	494000	And I want the video to stop, yeah?
494000	496000	Okay, well that didn't work.
496000	498000	I think tomorrow?
498000	500000	I don't know.
500000	504000	There's going to be a seven man collab.
504000	508000	That comes out soon.
508000	512000	I edited a seven man collab.
512000	520000	I have secured a fourth highlight slash clipper.
520000	528000	There should be a new short out on AC and Azura.
528000	532000	There should be a highlight video out on Marisy.
532000	538000	Thanks to a shadowed or, I think there's a highlight clip of AC.
538000	544000	Thanks to shadowed or everyone's now at 5K.
544000	548000	Ah, my babies, they're growing up so fast.
548000	550000	I can't handle it.
550000	556000	I will post the celebration 5K artworks
556000	558000	and I need to find it.
558000	560000	I've lost it.
560000	562000	I commissioned it quite a while ago.
562000	566000	The Marisy highlight video was good.
566000	568000	Did you like it?
568000	572000	Where she was anky.
572000	578000	But Jess, I am very thankful you guys let me get some rest.
578000	584000	I fell back asleep for five hours
584000	592000	and then I woke up and then I worked all the way through until three hours ago
592000	598000	and then I lied down for a nap and my alarm got me up.
598000	606000	And I was basically a zombie making myself a cup of tea.
606000	610000	But it's okay.
610000	614000	There's a Yumi Plus collab today.
614000	620000	So I get to be the grumpy angry Scots in the collab.
620000	622000	And I'm so annoyed.
622000	626000	One of the girls is from Australia
626000	630000	and I joked that I was gonna go to her house
630000	634000	and she was like, oh no, you can actually come to my house.
634000	638000	And of course we don't live in the same zoo.
638000	642000	I hate it.
642000	644000	I could have had my first offline collab.
644000	646000	Like my first feature for offline collab.
646000	650000	Don't get me wrong, I'm bossy enough to show up at someone's door.
650000	652000	I'm looking funny.
652000	658000	Madden Vastroni, will the girls pre-recorded SFW ASMR on Tron like yours?
658000	662000	And will we see any collab on there as well from any other VA's?
662000	664000	I will hold on anonymous.
664000	666000	Let me reread that.
666000	668000	You crazy madman.
668000	670000	Why did you spell it?
670000	672000	Why did you spell it like that?
672000	678000	Will we see pre-recorded like me?
678000	680000	And will we see any collabs?
680000	684000	Yes, Shabby has a collab with a girl coming up.
684000	688000	That's not in VA lore.
688000	694000	AC and Emmy have their own collab that's going on YouTube on Emmy's channel.
694000	700000	Um, Azura might be doing a collab with someone.
700000	702000	I need to set it up.
702000	706000	Basically, if it's an ASMR collab, I have to go set it up.
706000	708000	The Shabby collab I didn't have to set up.
708000	714000	But I'm very thankful for the situation that unfolded.
714000	718000	Because it means Shabby gets some time to shine.
718000	724000	Your first girl night ruined by Australia, honestly.
724000	726000	Aren't Dono's supposed to be off?
726000	730000	I've put them super quiet.
730000	734000	Are they supposed to be off?
734000	738000	I think if I was like, dry-eyed and
738000	742000	dreams of Strony kicking down the Rieveland store
742000	746000	for an impromptu and concession,
746000	750000	I think they're asking me, are we on Patreon?
750000	754000	What's Madienne, Mahath?
754000	756000	Is it a green?
756000	758000	Hi, Strony.
758000	762000	Well, the girls is...
762000	764000	On Tron.
764000	766000	Not the movie.
766000	770000	See, there's this movie franchise called Tron.
770000	776000	And it's like about a bike that's blue.
776000	780000	I'm fucking delirious.
780000	782000	I'll wake up shortly, hold on.
782000	784000	I'll go drink my tea.
784000	788000	I can start uploading all the audios on their Patreon as well.
788000	791000	That will be a me job because I'm not making them to...
791000	794000	Well, they don't even have access to their Patreon, so...
794000	797000	That part's impossible anyway.
797000	802000	Thank you for your tip, and please give me some time to do that.
802000	806000	But yes, it will all be archived on the year.
806000	810000	Appropriate Patreon, so...
810000	812000	I'm just trying to think of what work I have to do,
812000	815000	and I bet it's just their meme audios at the minute.
815000	817000	Right?
817000	819000	Right?
821000	823000	Don't push too hard.
825000	827000	Tell me about it.
827000	829000	I finally got like...
829000	833000	I'm so angry, but not in a bad way.
833000	835000	But I'm just angry because...
835000	837000	I did a shorter stream,
837000	840000	and I got so much work done behind the scenes,
840000	842000	and I hate it.
842000	844000	I want to stream all the time.
845000	848000	And because I know July is coming up,
848000	851000	and my dad's coming over,
851000	855000	I'm still so tired, I'm exhausted.
855000	859000	I had bloodshot eyes yesterday,
859000	863000	or, yeah, yesterday, which kind of freaked me out a bit.
863000	865000	But because July's coming,
865000	869000	and then I truly am going to do like two or four of our streamers max,
869000	873000	I'm like, I want to make up for it now
873000	876000	with all the content to offer.
876000	879000	Because I don't even know...
879000	881000	I don't...
881000	883000	If my dad is asleep,
883000	887000	I don't think I can even do ASMR because he snores.
889000	891000	But he like, he like,
891000	894000	snores, like shakes the house, snore.
898000	901000	Speaking of Patreon, your last audio was good.
901000	903000	Did you like it?
904000	907000	Did you like my armpit?
909000	912000	Could you do a stream when you chat and work on stuff in the background?
912000	916000	You'll never guess what we're doing in two hours.
916000	920000	We're writing a script that's actually work.
920000	922000	And if you guys like it,
922000	924000	then we can do more.
925000	930000	Okay, I finished my cup of tea before it gets too cold.
930000	933000	I'm gonna put you down right here,
933000	936000	and see what I'm gonna bubble you.
936000	938000	I'm gonna bubble you.
951000	954000	I was Mercy's latest audio written by you.
954000	956000	Sadly, yes.
956000	962000	The girls' first two months of content is by me.
962000	964000	And also, please understand,
964000	967000	I didn't actually know or have the girls,
967000	971000	when I wrote them, I just had their characters.
971000	973000	So please don't be like,
973000	974000	oh, this doesn't fit.
974000	976000	Please be so realistic.
976000	978000	This is a, it's very big.
978000	981000	It's not something that can be done overnight.
985000	988000	Are you like, gulping ASMR?
992000	994000	Wow.
994000	998000	She said, wait, what was Mercy's recent?
998000	1000000	I can't remember.
1000000	1002000	You don't like Mercy's?
1002000	1006000	Why, was there a problem with Mercy's?
1006000	1009000	Shoulda picked Mercy.
1015000	1017000	All the audios I've written have been already.
1017000	1019000	Feels good, man.
1019000	1022000	I was really nervous about writing for Emi.
1022000	1025000	I was like, am I going too far here?
1025000	1028000	And I was like, now fuck it, we're already going far enough.
1028000	1031000	We created it, so we can just keep going.
1036000	1038000	Wow.
1040000	1042000	What's her name?
1042000	1044000	Mercy?
1045000	1048000	Put it in there.
1048000	1052000	Girlfriend gets crazier in ovulation.
1052000	1056000	Yeah, yeah, I definitely wrote that one, right?
1059000	1062000	You're trying to embarrass me with the scripts, aren't you?
1062000	1067000	Your girlfriend has been waiting so long for you to finally come home and pound her.
1069000	1073000	Whenever she ovulates, she just can't get enough of your tentacles.
1073000	1076000	Yeah, that's me that wrote that one, right?
1080000	1083000	Yes, that's very me that wrote that one.
1086000	1090000	The girls have done great for the start of their contents.
1092000	1095000	And please understand for a lot of girls,
1095000	1100000	this is actually the first time they've ever wrote anything of this ed roll.
1101000	1106000	They have recorded anything of this nature, okay?
1106000	1109000	So please don't be overly critical.
1109000	1112000	Don't be that one person that's like, what the heck?
1112000	1119000	Your very first audio doesn't sound like someone who has produced audios for 20 years.
1119000	1121000	Outrage it.
1121000	1124000	Now shut the fuck up.
1124000	1126000	Shut up.
1126000	1129000	You literally get four audios for five dollars.
1129000	1132000	Fucking name one other VA that does that.
1132000	1135000	On top of that, they're streaming for free.
1135000	1138000	On top of that, they're putting content around Twitter for free.
1138000	1142000	Like, sorry, I'm arguing with spirits again, but...
1148000	1151000	Wait, unfortunately, yes, I did write that.
1151000	1156000	The next month's stuff I wrote and then it starts to swap.
1156000	1162000	We did have two temporary batches made not by me.
1162000	1166000	I don't know how it's gonna go for the girls.
1166000	1169000	I specifically...
1169000	1173000	Sorry, this is just me going on behind the scenes round.
1173000	1178000	I specifically commissioned a format.
1178000	1183000	And I asked them to mimic the format because I said,
1183000	1188000	not only is this format the best, I will show you the format in the next stream, in the member stream.
1188000	1192000	I specifically said, do the format like this.
1192000	1196000	The girls can record it super easily and they won't lose their place
1196000	1201000	and the editors know what to do when they get to certain sections, okay?
1201000	1203000	And they didn't do it.
1203000	1207000	And now I have, I think, eight scripts that are not in the correct format
1207000	1210000	and the poor girl has to figure out what to do.
1210000	1213000	Because there's no format at them correctly.
1213000	1219000	And I'm like, I gave them the example, I explained the importance of the format, so, yeah.
1219000	1221000	Yeah.
1224000	1229000	I'm fighting the ghosts again, I honestly, um...
1229000	1232000	You're doing really well getting everything set up for the start.
1232000	1237000	Yes, that's what the...
1237000	1242000	That's what the situation was, was getting set up at the start.
1242000	1245000	But thankfully now, oh, my mother was gone.
1245000	1250000	Thankfully now everything is like set up.
1250000	1256000	So I don't have to do fucking anything, okay?
1259000	1265000	It is incredibly difficult and tiring to change someone else's format.
1267000	1273000	Don't let the shadow people in your head get you, who's mad at the girls?
1273000	1279000	Well, we got one fucking fanny, and whoever you are, I don't know if you're listening.
1279000	1284000	Eh, but we got one fanny, started criticizing the girls by sending a message on the website.
1284000	1287000	Didn't we eat an absolute fucking fanny?
1287000	1292000	And I'm not being funny, you know for a fact these girls I've never recorded before.
1292000	1295000	They're like, eh, no, the deals are this, all the deals are that.
1295000	1297000	Fucking come complaining on the website, aye.
1297000	1300000	So the development team can all fucking read this shit.
1300000	1304000	As if I fucking passed on the message to the girls, like, didn't be a fanny.
1304000	1308000	It's the first time they've ever recorded these types of audios before.
1308000	1311000	Like, I'm not having it, I'm not having it.
1311000	1313000	Mummy's not happy.
1313000	1316000	Like, I just can't be yours to folk like that.
1316000	1320000	So I'm kind of fighting ghosts and then I'm fighting one fucking mom.
1320000	1324000	I shouldn't say that, but I really can't be yours when someone's like,
1324000	1328000	what do you mean any girls aren't producing a 10 out of 10 audio
1328000	1332000	when they're very first day and fucking feel literally go get to fuck, man.
1332000	1336000	Get the fuck, go post your audio first and let us all dog pile it at once.
1336000	1338000	Like, go get to fuck.
1338000	1340000	Sorry, I'm like straight up fighting.
1340000	1345000	You would be surprised how unbelievably fucking rude some fannies are.
1346000	1350000	Anyway, who is it? Oh, someone who obviously was anonymous on the website
1350000	1354000	leaving their dog shit feedback, honestly.
1354000	1356000	And the girls didn't produce a 10 out of 10.
1356000	1359000	Oh, I can hear the girls breathing in one of the audios.
1359000	1362000	Yeah, because they have a pair of fucking lungs on them, maybe.
1365000	1369000	I'm so sorry, I hate to break it to you, but I've actually got two lungs.
1369000	1372000	Sorry that they didn't get an operation when they got one lung.
1372000	1376000	Or fucking speaking to a ventilator, like, go get a fucking grip, man.
1376000	1377000	Where's my pitchfork, honestly?
1377000	1380000	We need your mommy to reach through it, so why?
1380000	1383000	Is it weird when I get angry?
1383000	1387000	The only time I get angry and start fighting is when someone's talking about the girls,
1387000	1389000	I'm like, alright then.
1389000	1393000	I bet we'll all listen to you fucking knee-lungs McGee over there
1393000	1398000	bet you're on a fucking ventilator and a wheelchair, you little cripple bastard.
1398000	1401000	Because you can't even fucking form a thought.
1401000	1403000	That's a fucking abstract concept.
1403000	1406000	But we banned fucking Denny breathing the audios.
1406000	1408000	They're breathing in the audios.
1408000	1410000	I'll get a fucking fuck off, mate.
1413000	1416000	Did you imagine complaining about breathing?
1416000	1417000	Ugh, what is this?
1417000	1420000	I'm sorry, you have to deal with it, but the silver lining is
1420000	1424000	that your frustration, we learn worse colors.
1425000	1430000	We love keeping totally not to make our community worse, honestly.
1430000	1434000	Better to say most of them have been a bit dimples in their eyes.
1434000	1436000	I'll leave in a wee dislike.
1436000	1441000	Ugh, you're breathing to make a little too hard to stream be.
1443000	1445000	Strong and hot when she is a little...
1445000	1448000	No, let's just protect the mommy coming out.
1448000	1452000	Honestly, so I'm on the feedback, I'm like...
1452000	1453000	I'm not being funny.
1453000	1455000	I wish I could do this.
1455000	1461000	I wish I could bring the fannies on that say something negative, bring them on,
1461000	1465000	get them to say out loud their little criticism, and be like,
1465000	1468000	no, no, no, no, no, say exactly how you said it before.
1468000	1471000	And then I'll just fucking elate them on fire.
1471000	1475000	Not literally, I meant elate them on fire with being like,
1475000	1478000	it wouldn't actually be fucking realistic out here.
1478000	1484000	So first of all, like, one of the first assignments the girls got was
1484000	1486000	their microphones had to be delivered.
1486000	1490000	Half of these girls have been using these microphones for two seconds.
1490000	1492000	Okay, these girls have no experience with these microphones,
1492000	1493000	and that's perfectly okay.
1493000	1495000	Everyone has to start somewhere, okay?
1495000	1498000	I popped their little microphone cherries on half of this shit.
1498000	1501000	Anyway, like, oh, no, sorry, I'm starting to get fat.
1501000	1503000	I'm not even doing ASMR.
1503000	1504000	This happens every time.
1504000	1506000	Oh, and label it a fucking ASMR team.
1506000	1508000	And I just start getting fucking rigid in the middle of it.
1508000	1511000	Sorry, I'm actually one of them.
1511000	1514000	I like, when Strenny vints and anchors in around check,
1514000	1516000	constant check, and my monkey brain is like,
1516000	1518000	Scorch!
1518000	1520000	Light all of them on fire and maincraft.
1520000	1522000	Yes, maincraft.
1522000	1525000	Strenny makes fun of a hate comment stream.
1525000	1530000	I feel like the amount of swearing, if I even set up that stream,
1530000	1533000	like, if I was, I don't know, I don't think we're,
1533000	1535000	I don't know what's gonna happen with Marshmallow,
1535000	1539000	but it'd just be like, alright, haters, time for me to make content,
1539000	1543000	for you to pay my bills, leave a hate comment about anything,
1543000	1547000	about failure, and then it just turns into a skit,
1547000	1549000	it's a funny cramp.
1549000	1552000	Like, there's no way in heck I would get through that stream
1552000	1555000	without being, like, absolutely screaming down the mic
1555000	1558000	in five minutes, being like, don't be so fucking stupid.
1558000	1559000	How you fucking do it?
1559000	1561000	Do you honestly think this is how I worth finding things?
1561000	1562000	How you fucking do it?
1562000	1564000	That's so dead, like, no.
1564000	1566000	Like, I'd absolutely, like, everyone would be like,
1566000	1567000	what the fuck?
1567000	1570000	How does someone so small have so much rage inside of her?
1572000	1576000	Getting protective of her children is extremely hot.
1578000	1580000	You'd probably get targeted for harassment
1580000	1582000	if I did something like that.
1582000	1584000	I mean, shit, we're getting harassed.
1584000	1586000	We're fucking breathing in the mic.
1587000	1589000	Daileys get so post-it.
1590000	1593000	Nah, these aren't real strong, I take your words.
1595000	1596000	That would actually be fine.
1596000	1598000	We need art and all that sort of outfit.
1598000	1601000	A strong ghost hunting, which is punching us.
1603000	1607000	Someone said, hire a manager to screen marshmallows.
1607000	1613000	To spend money to get anonymous comments is pretty rough,
1613000	1615000	if I'm being honest.
1615000	1618000	Dr. King, thank you for the membership.
1619000	1621000	I appreciate it.
1624000	1626000	And then there's a few more.
1627000	1629000	I mean, you know the drill.
1629000	1631000	Clearly they've never seen a Chihuahua.
1631000	1633000	Oh, are you calling me a Chihuahua?
1633000	1635000	Because I'm we in region.
1637000	1640000	I would listen to the veiler through your mic.
1640000	1641000	I don't even see them.
1641000	1643000	I don't own the company.
1644000	1649000	Oh no, she's shadowboxing again.
1651000	1654000	Type of YouTube admin, not you though.
1654000	1656000	Small being read.
1656000	1659000	I'll cover that for a manager.
1662000	1665000	Man, I must get in my tributes.
1665000	1667000	I hate it here.
1668000	1672000	Just be spending money to protect the girl's mental health.
1673000	1680000	Well, so the upkeep of the company is like nothing next to nothing.
1680000	1687000	But if it's like, oh, we need to pay a whole other person to go through these marshmallows.
1687000	1694000	Like, I know it's very nice being able to give like anonymous comments and stuff and feedback on that.
1694000	1697000	And like, don't get rid of them for now.
1697000	1702000	But like, it's just another expense.
1702000	1708000	And the whole set up of the 820 split is like, the girls can do whatever extra they want with the money.
1708000	1715000	Because obviously the average agency is like 50 or less, I guess.
1715000	1717000	Not that kind of 50 or less.
1717000	1719000	I said the 50-50 or whatever.
1719000	1721000	You know what I mean?
1721000	1727000	They just transfer the cognate hazards to the person's people screen.
1727000	1731000	You can relax by using all your rage while you have fun.
1731000	1735000	Wonderful firecrackers, sirens.
1739000	1743000	The other has a very positive and tight-knit community, so far it's been good though.
1743000	1746000	You know, their mental fortune is better than we do.
1746000	1748000	Yeah.
1749000	1753000	It would lose a lot of charm, knowing that there's like a literally a third party.
1753000	1755000	Yeah, so that I would actually agree with that as well.
1755000	1759000	Like, imagine being like, oh, I've sent my tentacotta mummy.
1759000	1763000	And then it's like, it's some poor guy that we're paying.
1763000	1767000	We're paying has to like, rate your tentacle.
1767000	1769000	Like, this is high enough quality.
1769000	1772000	The man whimpered, here you go, Strani.
1772000	1777000	The reefling whimpered, here's the link.
1778000	1780000	Can you listen?
1787000	1790000	You can sit down, your mirrors are open.
1791000	1793000	Yes, yes, yes.
1793000	1796000	I just let things simmer first.
1800000	1806000	I mean, do you want VLR management for your pack or your little tentacle?
1806000	1813000	My morning voice, my woke up seven minutes before stream voice after the nap.
1813000	1815000	Yeah.
1815000	1822000	Or pay like, let me see if I can tap your ears a little.
1822000	1825000	Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
1827000	1829000	Anywhere.
1829000	1832000	Um, here in the afternoon.
1837000	1842000	My tentacle is a Strani exclusive.
1842000	1845000	Sounds good.
1847000	1854000	So I managed to get mech assault work in, so we're definitely on for a mech assault stream.
1854000	1861000	Um, I'm taking a pause for a week on Elden Ring.
1862000	1875000	Um, and just because we have two insurance streams over in Scape, to try and bash out these wines.
1877000	1880000	But I'm getting nervous, I don't know if I can do it.
1880000	1885000	I freaking saw Narissa from Hollow Live is doing prayer.
1885000	1897000	And I think she's doing the altar as well with dragon bones and getting, and getting, uh, it's not Jailbirds for Narissa.
1897000	1899000	Wait, is it Jail? No.
1901000	1905000	Um, to like, run her dragon bones.
1905000	1910000	Oh mommy, I saw the new thumbnails there, correct? I want to use them as a desk, huh?
1910000	1912000	Yeah.
1912000	1917000	I'd admit it, the real reasons, the reasons can help finish the DLC for you.
1917000	1920000	All right, mech assault one and two, my child.
1920000	1922000	They made a mech assault two.
1922000	1924000	I don't think they made a mech assault two.
1924000	1929000	Okay, well we approve comments together on YouTube.
1929000	1932000	RuneScape is, Strani is the RuneScape chance there.
1932000	1933000	Yeah, it's Jailbirds.
1933000	1936000	Ah, newest Jailbirds. That's right, I know my features.
1936000	1945000	I was a very brave girl yesterday on Twitter, and I applied myself for one of those trends,
1945000	1956000	where it's like, put your model, and we might do, it's by Frame and Ebay Shrimp,
1956000	1960000	and they're making Wim Tattoos, so I posted my full model view,
1960000	1962000	which a lot of people don't get to see.
1962000	1965000	It's on my Twitter, the link's in the description.
1965000	1969000	If you just check out my replies on Twitter, you'll see it,
1969000	1975000	because yeah, I do not show the full view of my, is this room dark enough?
1975000	1980000	Maybe the room is dark enough for me to get away with it, hold on.
1985000	1989000	Hi, I'm Strani, this is my room.
1991000	1998000	I don't show it often for reasons, but yeah, this is me.
2007000	2009000	How did I do that?
2009000	2012000	You're supposed, no, microphone.
2015000	2016000	Sorry.
2017000	2020000	The microphone's not supposed to go big.
2022000	2027000	But yeah, I don't normally show that, because, yeah.
2027000	2033000	That was a brave girl, and, oh, that was a brave girl,
2033000	2036000	and like, put myself under one of those posts,
2036000	2040000	because I'm like, oh, hi, I'm Strani, I'm a weirdo,
2040000	2044000	but thank you for the opportunity for the Wim Tattoos.
2044000	2049000	Wim Tattoos, it's just a Scottish flag, honestly, if they even knew that.
2049000	2053000	I'd be very surprised if they knew I was Scottish.
2053000	2061000	And then I sent a VTuber, a message, a DM request for an ASMR collab,
2061000	2067000	but I sent it to someone that doesn't follow me, but that has open DMs.
2067000	2070000	And they were like, oh, looking to make friends.
2070000	2072000	Oh, wait, I'm gonna do it.
2073000	2077000	They were looking to make friends, and I asked for an ASMR collab.
2077000	2079000	I'm a fucking twat.
2081000	2085000	She was asking to make pals, no fucking compatriots.
2086000	2092000	Wim Tattoos that says, no got a fucking clue what that means.
2096000	2098000	It's a microphone now.
2103000	2107000	I thought you were going to intentionally have them make cover of the area.
2108000	2112000	Ooh, I'm happy, I knew I was such a brave girl.
2113000	2117000	But yes, we have a member's script writing stream.
2118000	2121000	I'll see how it gets received.
2121000	2126000	If it gets received well, that'll help out a lot.
2127000	2131000	I'm not even pretending, that'll help out so much.
2131000	2135000	I have you guys script writing streams, because it looks so bad.
2136000	2145000	But I made so much progress yesterday, and then I get to do the next seven group collabs.
2146000	2155000	That may or may not be on a certain feature-proof ASMR account.
2155000	2159000	Peaches, it's peaches, I can't show up, it's peaches, I peaches.
2161000	2164000	I mean, you can make friends over ASMR.
2164000	2171000	I know that whenever I do a message for ASMR, I'm always super up front, and I'm just like,
2171000	2179000	Hi, I'll make the collab, and I'll write it, and I'll edit it, and everything else that we don't buy me.
2179000	2184000	I'm a professional relationship type thing.
2191000	2194000	Don't forget about the stream delay during member's stream?
2194000	2196000	Yeah, you guys can tell me what you want me to put.
2196000	2198000	I'll do the b-paul thing, if you want to.
2198000	2200000	Me, I see a certain sense.
2202000	2206000	Wait, the seven man collab line up?
2208000	2213000	Hold on, let me type in the name.
2213000	2215000	Oh, my stomach is-
2216000	2223000	It's up, it's breaking up, okay.
2223000	2227000	The girl's seven man collab is all those boo-boo-boo-boo.
2232000	2240000	If you want to hear seven ASMR girls together, you can open that up and then pause on the side if you want.
2246000	2250000	And leave it a like when you listen to it and stuff.
2250000	2256000	Okay, so that's the second of four seven man ASMR collabs.
2256000	2260000	The next one is peaches.
2261000	2264000	As in dream of peaches, yeah.
2266000	2268000	But you can open that up.
2268000	2270000	Yes, demon in me.
2270000	2278000	I think the girls might make a solo ASMR roleplay with the look or something.
2279000	2282000	Because the art came out pretty good.
2283000	2287000	Unfortunately, Jaffa Redwood's colour blind and he keeps fucking me up.
2293000	2296000	You can listen to that later, alligator.
2297000	2300000	Make sure to like and subscribe.
2301000	2304000	Yeah, if you like ASMR, you can subscribe to me by the way.
2304000	2306000	I have lots of ASMR coming.
2306000	2310000	Okay, I'm going to approve of comments on YouTube.
2310000	2312000	I will read them out to you.
2312000	2316000	Four minutes ago, someone commented H on my short.
2316000	2319000	That just came out, so I'll approve that.
2320000	2325000	Someone posted on the Mamusa collab a sleeping emoji.
2325000	2327000	We will approve.
2328000	2333000	Someone on my debut, but posted double of hearts.
2333000	2335000	Feels good man.
2336000	2339000	I have a treat for you all this Saturday.
2339000	2342000	I hope you're ready for Saturday.
2343000	2348000	There's a treat on everyone's channel on Saturday.
2351000	2353000	So look out for that.
2353000	2361000	It will be on everyone's channel and it will come out like 10 minutes apart.
2363000	2367000	So you have to watch as they get released totally.
2367000	2369000	That's how it works, right?
2372000	2374000	What is approving comments?
2374000	2381000	So when you comment on my channel, it disappears, but it doesn't really.
2381000	2387000	It shows up in my little approval section and I get to read all the comments and approve them.
2387000	2391000	So I quite literally read every single comment.
2391000	2397000	Someone says, Microsoft, that brings back memories on my schedule.
2398000	2401000	Someone's saluted the clapping without hands.
2401000	2404000	It's a more video because it got deleted.
2404000	2408000	Someone said, power claps are over 9000.
2409000	2416000	Someone says, you know you have a giant cake when you make this kind of noises down.
2416000	2418000	That broke the sudden barrier.
2421000	2423000	I got you and enjoyed it.
2424000	2426000	Oh my lord, the cake is not a lie.
2426000	2429000	Nope, we aren't doing portal out here.
2430000	2433000	It's all in the thighs safely.
2436000	2440000	And then someone said rip to the actual original clapping video.
2444000	2445000	Am I working on more?
2445000	2446000	I'm like, yes.
2446000	2450000	So I see an Emmy haven't been approved and they're being made.
2451000	2454000	I've sent away Shibi's request.
2454000	2462000	I need to get Azura to tell me what batch attend she wants and then I need to use my brain power.
2468000	2472000	If someone can tweet me what my emotes were in batch 2, that'd be great.
2472000	2477000	I don't have access to Marshmallow because someone did it on Marshmallow.
2480000	2481000	Let's see.
2484000	2487000	Why does listening to your talk make my head spin?
2488000	2490000	Is it because I'm Scottish?
2490000	2492000	Is it because it's weird here?
2492000	2494000	Words said a bit differently.
2498000	2503000	I'm excited for Among Us with Yume Plus.
2503000	2507000	Oh, you're gonna hear the wrath of the Scots real quick and that's true.
2508000	2512000	That's where one of them accuses me of being it when I'm not it.
2513000	2518000	When someone accuses me of being it when I'm not it, I'm like absolutely screaming region.
2518000	2522000	Me when I'm it but accusing someone else of it.
2526000	2529000	I've got my latex gloves on.
2530000	2533000	Can you tell I've got a latex glove on?
2537000	2538000	Yeah.
2552000	2555000	What's the tentacle on the wall for anyway?
2555000	2557000	It's totally decorational.
2557000	2560000	We're not wearing functional hair again.
2561000	2562000	Okay.
2565000	2569000	Today is Patra's day so you have three streams today
2569000	2573000	and you're already listening to one of them right now.
2576000	2577000	Good to me.
2577000	2580000	I promise I'm a certified nurse.
2580000	2586000	I'm just checking out your ears to make sure you've got good tail in your ears.
2587000	2590000	And what about this ear?
2593000	2597000	This ear clearly is deficient in tingles.
2599000	2602000	I know what I can do in order to fix this.
2603000	2610000	I will administer five cc's of tingles to hold your breath mister.
2610000	2612000	I'll save you.
2616000	2617000	Okay.
2629000	2630000	Wow.
2633000	2636000	What are you gonna do with them glues?
2636000	2645000	Nurse Ronnie's will the tingles result in a main break?
2645000	2646000	Yeah?
2646000	2647000	Yeah, main break.
2648000	2650000	Today's more script stream goes well.
2650000	2653000	Maybe we can write a main break together
2653000	2656000	and I'll show you our hypnosis stuff.
2660000	2665000	Okay, let me inspect your ear again for any tingles.
2667000	2668000	Wow.
2670000	2673000	Okay, you tingled a little bit.
2675000	2678000	Can you feel my breath on your ear?
2682000	2686000	We need to administer even more tingles.
2686000	2688000	What can we do?
2688000	2690000	I'm looking.
2691000	2692000	Why?
2692000	2694000	I can clean them.
2694000	2698000	I'd like me to pick up my handy-dandy tool
2698000	2703000	because you need to tingle or else you're gonna perish for some reason.
2704000	2712000	In the world's 26th day, if you do not tingle once a day, you fall into a coma.
2714000	2716000	Surely she wouldn't make the break.
2716000	2721000	If you were a nurse, I would always want to be sick.
2729000	2732000	Any chance the girls will play a game together?
2732000	2735000	Yes, we actually posted it in the discord.
2736000	2738000	So, quite possibly.
2741000	2742000	Okay.
2743000	2747000	I think you're tingling a little, so I'm returning to normal in this ear,
2747000	2748000	which is good news.
2748000	2749000	Very, very good news.
2749000	2750000	Yes.
2755000	2756000	Wow, wow, wow.
2764000	2765000	There we go.
2765000	2772000	Slow and steady went to tingle it.
2777000	2779000	Breathing a little.
2779000	2782000	Please make me gentle.
2785000	2788000	I have no idea how this among us collapse is gonna go.
2789000	2796000	I was like, so when, if you didn't know, I'm gonna teach you.
2796000	2797000	Okay?
2797000	2807000	I'm gonna teach you the insider knowledge, which is when you do group collabs or collabs of that nature,
2807000	2817000	you show up one hour before this stream time to sort out any connection problems of a discord DM.
2817000	2819000	Always makes me nervous.
2819000	2821000	I'm like, oh god, the girls okay?
2837000	2839000	Okay, the girls are not dying.
2839000	2841000	This is fantastic news.
2842000	2845000	I love it when the girls aren't dying.
2845000	2847000	It's my favorite thing.
2847000	2848000	I was getting so nervous.
2848000	2850000	I'm like, why have I been ahead?
2855000	2857000	Every day I come.
2857000	2859000	Oh, sorry.
2859000	2861000	I should have finished that sentence there.
2861000	2866000	Every day I come home and get stuck locked by VLR ASMR streams.
2868000	2869000	Yeah.
2871000	2875000	Bro, can I say that every collab is so unlucky?
2875000	2876000	It's like every...
2876000	2881000	Bro, I am still so mad at the pepper washer devs.
2881000	2886000	Not only do they lock free play mode multiplayer behind the campaign,
2886000	2888000	we can't even connect each other.
2890000	2892000	Am I made it safely?
2892000	2894000	Is she in the Bahamas or some shit?
2894000	2896000	I don't even know where she is.
2897000	2900000	She just put on the team-up schedule.
2900000	2902000	I'm away and I'm like, as long as you're safe,
2902000	2905000	that's all that's important to me as long as you have fun.
2905000	2908000	I actually don't know where she's looking like.
2911000	2913000	Amy's in heaven otherwise.
2913000	2915000	It's like I can still hear her.
2915000	2916000	What do you mean?
2916000	2919000	I'm right here, big brother.
2921000	2924000	Amy, are you not supposed to be on holiday?
2925000	2927000	Oh, yeah, sometimes.
2936000	2939000	Amy, go be on holiday and relax.
2942000	2944000	My main place would be...
2946000	2949000	Sometimes I can still hear her voice.
2950000	2954000	Amy, Amy, are you there?
2954000	2955000	Yeah.
2955000	2957000	Oh, who the fuck?
2957000	2960000	I'm communicating with her right now telepathically.
2961000	2964000	Amy, what do you want to say to the pentpals?
2966000	2968000	Thank you for denying me.
2969000	2973000	Amy, Amy, you can't say that out loud.
2973000	2976000	That's the quiet part out loud.
2977000	2979000	Maybe it's Jill.
2983000	2986000	Amy, I'm sure.
2990000	2992000	It's like she never left.
2992000	2994000	Amy, is that you?
2994000	2996000	Is it so cold out here?
2996000	2998000	Ah, fuck it, why not?
2999000	3002000	Right, Amy, what kind of tingle do you want to do?
3003000	3006000	I don't have a fucking clue.
3006000	3009000	Alright, Amy, that doesn't help this collab.
3009000	3011000	Fuck it, we'll do something, alright?
3011000	3014000	Have a boo, you kiss the pentpals.
3015000	3016000	You know?
3027000	3030000	Well, that collab went well, don't you think?
3031000	3034000	That was the quickest and easiest collab in my life.
3034000	3038000	Now I can clickbait this stream with Amy's shoulder on it real quick.
3041000	3043000	There's just Amy and the Beast.
3045000	3048000	There's just Amy and the Beast in the room with us.
3049000	3052000	Strongly, the accident was a year ago.
3052000	3054000	You have to let Amy go.
3054000	3056000	No, not my little sister.
3061000	3064000	I've pressed down on your ears a little bit.
3066000	3069000	I've pressed on your ears a little bit, okay?
3070000	3072000	Amy, see me?
3076000	3078000	Went into a power washer.
3078000	3082000	I think power washer would have to be a four-man collab.
3083000	3086000	As soon as we got more than four people in the game,
3086000	3089000	the game was like no avana.
3091000	3094000	No one can collab with me at this time, ever.
3094000	3096000	I'll do it myself.
3096000	3100000	I say, I say, come in for a minute.
3101000	3103000	No, what do you want?
3103000	3105000	Strongly, I'm tired.
3105000	3107000	I just finished streaming.
3107000	3110000	I see, I see, do you want to hear it again?
3110000	3112000	I'm going to do some more ASMR.
3112000	3115000	But Strongly, my voice is broken.
3115000	3117000	I can't.
3118000	3121000	Right, well, I tried.
3121000	3124000	I tried Snow Berries, but AC can't make it.
3126000	3129000	Strongly, you just went near all of these.
3129000	3132000	That's it, I'll get Azura, and hold on.
3132000	3134000	Azura?
3135000	3137000	Azura?
3137000	3139000	They're one, yeah.
3139000	3141000	To do more ASMR with me.
3148000	3152000	I look good when I'm pressing Azura, it's just a moment.
3153000	3156000	Oh wait, no, I said no.
3157000	3159000	Oh no.
3161000	3164000	Wait a minute, how am I typing in chat right now?
3164000	3166000	This isn't possible.
3167000	3169000	You're teasing us, are you?
3169000	3171000	What the fuck are you typing in chat?
3171000	3173000	I don't stream at the same time.
3173000	3174000	AC, how are you?
3174000	3176000	Do you got your phone out?
3176000	3177000	No.
3177000	3180000	Someone's pretending to be me on stream.
3185000	3189000	The whole ASMR is stopped here, and there's already so much of it.
3189000	3192000	AC is feeding the masses with ASMR.
3194000	3198000	Literally, my impression of Azura is just...
3199000	3201000	I can't.
3202000	3209000	My sweet, bleeding heart.
3212000	3214000	That's a bit of it, I know.
3215000	3217000	Strongly is joystick there too.
3217000	3219000	Yeah, they're long with one little bit of it.
3221000	3223000	As well as Karambit.
3225000	3227000	And Strongly365.
3228000	3230000	Oh, the terrible one.
3230000	3232000	Hold on, I'll chat to the latex.
3233000	3235000	Azura's too mummy for you.
3236000	3238000	Would you mean my deadpan accent?
3238000	3240000	Can you do our mouth voice?
3240000	3241000	Would you, I mean, no.
3241000	3243000	I just don't stream, what's going on?
3243000	3245000	I'm pretending to be all...
3245000	3248000	No, sorry, I'm proving that I'm all avirable right now.
3248000	3252000	Amy was on stream earlier, you just missed it by a ball here.
3252000	3254000	Actually, she's just gone away on holiday,
3254000	3257000	she's just jumped on the plane, but she was in my room as I had to go.
3257000	3260000	Oh, it's Stacy Milka, and how can you forget?
3262000	3264000	Wait, we'll see if I can get Amy again,
3264000	3266000	even though she's on a plane right now.
3267000	3268000	Amy.
3269000	3271000	What the fuck is Amy's voice again?
3271000	3272000	Hold on.
3273000	3274000	Big brother.
3278000	3281000	It's actually just called V strongy, this company's a veil.
3281000	3283000	It's not real.
3283000	3285000	Strongy can't hurt you.
3285000	3288000	Strongy with her 18 billion personas.
3289000	3292000	Azura's natural rasp is hard to nail.
3292000	3294000	Oh yeah, do you want me to fuck it?
3294000	3296000	I'm gonna go put on Azura right now.
3296000	3301000	Azura de ule de lu e.
3303000	3307000	Okay, so I've typed in Azura de lu e, so over for you fuckers.
3308000	3310000	Let's see, live.
3311000	3314000	Ah, Azura de ule de lu e.
3314000	3316000	That's a new short out, let's go.
3316000	3318000	Right, let's see what her ASMR was.
3325000	3328000	Don't be afraid to talk in this video, Azura.
3328000	3331000	Okay, Azura actually doesn't talk much in her fucking reals,
3331000	3333000	it's just a stray then.
3333000	3335000	So I can mimic her voice.
3336000	3338000	Azura shy, geez.
3338000	3340000	I'm gonna have to spank her.
3341000	3344000	Hey Azura, you need to start talking in your streams more
3344000	3347000	so I can mimic you during an ASMR section of mine.
3347000	3348000	Thanks, that'd be great.
3350000	3352000	You know what, I'm gonna put our trailer on,
3352000	3354000	because I know for a fact she speaks in her trailer.
3355000	3357000	Get route, videos.
3357000	3359000	Trailer, let's go.
3359000	3362000	I hope you still have room in your heart
3363000	3366000	for a coach goddess like me.
3368000	3371000	For I am Azura de ule,
3371000	3373000	and I hope you can join me soon
3373000	3377000	on some tantalizing discussions together.
3377000	3380000	I'm just drew a copy in her trailer.
3380000	3383000	I played it, I don't know, I mean,
3383000	3386000	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
3387000	3388000	I played it, I don't know.
3388000	3390000	Yeah, I know, I'm muted to death though.
3391000	3394000	Her late is short, should I give her her late is short ago?
3398000	3400000	Someone told me
3401000	3404000	my voice is so soothing
3405000	3408000	that I could read out a dictionary.
3409000	3412000	So we're going to try today.
3412000	3414000	Says Veeler here.
3415000	3417000	I'm all of Veeler.
3417000	3418000	Okay, there we go.
3418000	3419000	Oh, that's good.
3419000	3420000	What was that actually?
3420000	3422000	Are you guys just hyping me up?
3426000	3427000	Wait, are you guys being serious?
3427000	3431000	Are you hyping me up or can I actually mimic Azura as well?
3432000	3435000	No Veeler, it's just, she is veeler.
3435000	3438000	Holy goat, you're actually pretty good looking impressions.
3438000	3439000	Oh, wait until you do that.
3439000	3441000	I'm going to hear Marcia's lovely impression.
3441000	3443000	I'm going to shit you up with her.
3444000	3446000	It's funny, Azura sounds like someone else.
3446000	3450000	No, you're supposed to say I sounded like her.
3452000	3454000	Right today,
3455000	3457000	and that means
3458000	3460000	to make something better.
3461000	3462000	You actually sounded like her.
3463000	3466000	Hype me up, hype me up, give me more delusions,
3466000	3468000	give me more personas.
3469000	3472000	Veeler will decide your fate.
3472000	3474000	I am Veeler.
3474000	3476000	Boy, better than expected.
3476000	3478000	Now try Mercy Modest.
3478000	3480000	Sorry, I'll try Mercy Modest.
3483000	3484000	Mercy Modest.
3484000	3488000	I think Marcia's the only accent that doesn't compliment me.
3490000	3492000	Which is terrible.
3492000	3495000	Right, let's listen to a short from Marcia.
3495000	3496000	Okay.
3499000	3501000	Sorry, don't send that easily.
3501000	3502000	Don't worry.
3502000	3505000	Oh, but she's like, I'm trying on solar.
3508000	3510000	What's her trailer?
3510000	3512000	Debut and turn first?
3514000	3518000	What better story than that of a modest young student?
3518000	3520000	No, she's not like that.
3521000	3525000	Turn violent and dairy overnight.
3527000	3529000	Mercy's pretty unique, that's hard.
3533000	3535000	I didn't always look...
3535000	3536000	I've not gone up.
3536000	3538000	Mercy's too really difficult.
3538000	3540000	Mercy's really difficult.
3544000	3545000	She...
3545000	3547000	I can do Mercy's laugh like that.
3548000	3551000	Sorry, that was really loud.
3551000	3555000	So now you already have a mommy voice when you talk to yourself.
3555000	3557000	Someone was like, you're disappointed.
3557000	3560000	Mommy voice like, shit me up in your fucking...
3562000	3563000	On your...
3565000	3567000	Elden Ring stream.
3567000	3570000	They were like, scared of how disappointed I sounded.
3578000	3581000	Can we hear your best straw necks?
3583000	3584000	Fuckin' thing.
3584000	3586000	I'm Scottish.
3588000	3591000	Mercy's too yandere in my mic, unless you're also yandere.
3591000	3592000	Do your catchphrase.
3593000	3596000	I'm Mercy Modest, and on my ass you will feast.
3598000	3602000	That's not my kohei, just a manic laughter.
3607000	3609000	Gosh, Scottish girls make me melt.
3610000	3611000	Actually, too, will be.
3611000	3612000	Try Shavey.
3612000	3613000	Right, let's...
3613000	3615000	Oh, I need a fart.
3619000	3620000	Attuded.
3622000	3626000	I just want to report for any bread breakers.
3626000	3628000	I'm technically on day five.
3628000	3632000	Give up for day five of having constipation.
3633000	3635000	Right, Shavey.
3637000	3642000	Shavey, get out of there, out in the open.
3644000	3646000	Okay, let's listen to her debut.
3647000	3649000	Oh fuck, she's deep voiced as well.
3649000	3651000	Like, I knew that about...
3657000	3658000	Oh, hold on.
3660000	3663000	I'm Shavey Cottonbum, the madam of the sister...
3663000	3665000	Ah, fuck, I don't have that.
3668000	3671000	I hope I can take off a lot of boxes for you.
3672000	3676000	Such as ropes, milk, bunny.
3676000	3678000	Yeah, I know, I get that.
3682000	3684000	No shit dune challenge.
3686000	3690000	Starting at some point, it's gonna need to be scooped out.
3690000	3693000	Do you know why it's called the scooping room?
3693000	3696000	It's because you scoop shit in it, you dumbass.
3696000	3699000	Sister location for Netflix hilarious.
3699000	3702000	And I won't have any other...
3702000	3704000	...literations.
3708000	3711000	Get to day nine and you can pretend it's just straight up gender.
3711000	3714000	Bro, my stomach is so big right now.
3714000	3718000	Yeah, you need to really deep for Shavey.
3718000	3720000	You do a good mouth voice.
3720000	3723000	You want a Scottish mouth? How do I do a Scottish mouth?
3724000	3727000	Well, I know how to do a Scottish mum.
3727000	3730000	Away and fucking clean your room.
3730000	3733000	That's a Scottish mum, but not a Scottish mouth.
3735000	3740000	Oh, darling, have you been naughty?
3740000	3743000	Or do you need to clean your room?
3743000	3748000	Or are you needing a mouth like me to come in and help you?
3748000	3751000	I can do lots for you.
3752000	3757000	Pinned over the bed and pick up all the stuff that's on the rack.
3758000	3760000	For half a year some more, man.
3760000	3763000	Yeah, what do we do?
3763000	3767000	Join the animatronic family.
3767000	3769000	We open the rail soon.
3771000	3774000	Your tummy's big, sorry, my bad.
3781000	3783000	A circus baby.
3783000	3785000	Do you know why?
3785000	3787000	It's called the scooping room.
3787000	3789000	I just love the way she says it.
3789000	3792000	It's like, you fucking idiot.
3792000	3795000	Well, I wasn't ready for the mummy video.
3795000	3797000	I need to renew my passport.
3797000	3799000	Why do you need to renew your passport?
3799000	3804000	What triggered in your head to need to renew your passport in this monster?
3807000	3810000	How many days will you get before the doctor?
3810000	3812000	Oh, I just need to give my...
3812000	3814000	Not to be nasty.
3814000	3820000	But if you ever have trouble with your back door,
3820000	3823000	just get a little enema kit.
3823000	3825000	Enema, enema, give them an enema.
3825000	3828000	I'm really stuck.
3831000	3839000	Because if you like playing in the back door,
3841000	3846000	that's what you do.
3846000	3849000	Sorry, your mouth voice is too powerful.
3849000	3851000	That's hostile.
3851000	3854000	It's just the facts.
3854000	3858000	Sorry, you're getting educated against your will.
3858000	3860000	Okay.
3863000	3868000	Oh, the face tracking thinks the ace cube,
3869000	3872000	the ace globe is my face.
3872000	3875000	Hold on, it's missing up a little bit.
3878000	3881000	Circus baby, you had to ask the Scottish scooping room
3881000	3884000	because you had to have a thing scooping in it.
3884000	3887000	It's not that complicated.
3888000	3891000	Hey, Stroney, how's the stream don't...
3892000	3895000	Don't, just don't.
3899000	3902000	How's the stream don't...
3902000	3904000	Sorry.
3904000	3907000	Just don't do it, stop it.
3909000	3911000	24 hours fast though,
3911000	3914000	if you have a lot planned, learn that hard way.
3916000	3919000	No, you don't need to fast.
3920000	3922000	Minor spelling mistake.
3922000	3926000	Spotted everyone pointing that.
3926000	3930000	We're kidding, I'm teasing.
3935000	3938000	I think I might like the Scottish lady's voice,
3938000	3940000	because I'm Scots.
3943000	3945000	Minor spelling.
3945000	3947000	Teasing, I'm teasing.
3947000	3950000	My mouth is tracking to the ace globe.
3950000	3952000	You stop that.
3957000	3960000	Go to fuck, they sleep.
3964000	3967000	Go to fuck, they sleep.
3967000	3970000	Oh, I'm doing a song cover.
3970000	3972000	I might be able to do it
3972000	3976000	and record the raw vocals after.
3979000	3982000	The Yumi plus, if I don't go too crazy.
3982000	3985000	Although basically whenever I finish streaming
3985000	3988000	for the day I go to bed now.
3989000	3992000	Because I got so much work done.
3992000	3995000	So much work done yesterday.
3996000	4000000	It's recommended to fast if you go spelunkin'.
4002000	4004000	Have a mesmerizing time, everyone.
4004000	4006000	Wish I could stay for the script writing stream,
4006000	4008000	but I'm sure the time is fantastic.
4008000	4010000	It will be the stream will remain up,
4010000	4013000	because we'll use substitutes like tentacle and ink.
4014000	4017000	And we're just talking about honey tea.
4017000	4019000	That's all.
4019000	4022000	I just need to make a little bit of honey tea.
4024000	4027000	We'll have my sleep on.
4027000	4029000	Angry Scots talks you in a bed.
4029000	4031000	See you, you're another one.
4031000	4033000	You never sleep at night, what's going on with you?
4033000	4034000	Like a frickin' insomnia.
4034000	4036000	Don't be up on that male twin and gummies
4036000	4039000	that all them Americans are on about all the faking time.
4039000	4041000	No, let me talk you in real nice and tidy
4041000	4044000	and get your act up so you can faking go to sleep.
4044000	4046000	Because I've had enough of you been awake all day.
4046000	4047000	Faking clean the whole house.
4047000	4049000	Clean the whole bloody house and what do I get in the town?
4049000	4051000	Faking you coming over.
4051000	4053000	Cuttin' faking toast on the bunker.
4053000	4056000	On the bunker, as if there's any plates available.
4056000	4059000	As if you can't just use a wee bit of kitchen roll.
4059000	4061000	Do you know what the worst thing that really annoys me?
4061000	4062000	That you do.
4062000	4063000	See the fuckin' butter?
4063000	4064000	See the fuckin' butter?
4064000	4067000	When you make toast and then you use the knife
4067000	4070000	to spread the butter and then you put the knife back in the butter.
4070000	4073000	So now the butter has fuckin' toasty bread
4073000	4074000	comes all over it.
4074000	4076000	Like it actually does matter to me.
4078000	4079000	Anyway.
4079000	4082000	That's what Scottish Rage ASMR would sound like.
4087000	4088000	Ugh.
4088000	4092000	I'm frickin' struggling to find an artist as well.
4092000	4094000	To do all my crazy things.
4094000	4097000	I've still not ordered the pregnancy artwork.
4098000	4099000	And...
4100000	4103000	I want it to come out a really good way
4103000	4105000	but I don't have an artist to do it.
4109000	4110000	I want...
4111000	4113000	She's not acting anymore.
4113000	4114000	Strutting the record.
4115000	4117000	Twisted crumbs and butter are the worst.
4117000	4119000	I'm sorry about the butter.
4119000	4120000	She's not acting anymore.
4120000	4122000	You know I'm not acting because my dad's coming over
4122000	4124000	and that's exactly what he does.
4125000	4128000	My mum used to get on it all the time for it
4128000	4130000	and he used to be like,
4130000	4132000	oh but I'm making toast for my breakfast
4132000	4134000	before I go to work.
4134000	4137000	Like he didn't see the issue with having crumbly
4137000	4139000	butter.
4140000	4143000	Alert of the classic lure pack fam.
4144000	4146000	We love a bit of lure pack.
4146000	4148000	Pregnancy ASMR would be my best.
4148000	4150000	I know mum can cook literally tummy-sits
4150000	4152000	and I'm saying how proud I am of you
4152000	4154000	and I can't wait to see
4154000	4156000	everything you accomplish in the world
4156000	4158000	and how you navigate that
4158000	4161000	and how big and strong you're gonna be
4161000	4163000	and I'm gonna look forward to
4163000	4166000	the sleepless nights that you keep me awake
4166000	4168000	after you're born because
4168000	4171000	I know you're not always gonna be in the newborn stage
4171000	4173000	before I know it you'll be walking
4173000	4175000	you'll be babbling
4175000	4177000	you'll start having your own personality
4177000	4180000	and interest and it's gonna be so cute.
4181000	4183000	And then I'm gonna get all emotional
4183000	4185000	because I'll be like one day I'll hold you
4185000	4187000	and then I'll never hold you again
4187000	4189000	because you're all big and grown up
4189000	4191000	my little weifling, no.
4194000	4197000	But yes, I need to find an artist
4197000	4199000	that's willing to draw something like that.
4199000	4201000	If not I might have to go to Fiverr
4201000	4204000	but Fiverr is always such a gamble
4205000	4207000	and I don't want to gamble on the artwork
4207000	4209000	because it means so much.
4210000	4211000	To make it.
4211000	4213000	The one where we're the father and the child?
4213000	4214000	Yes.
4215000	4217000	I'm not supposed to cry.
4217000	4218000	Stop it.
4218000	4219000	No, don't cry.
4219000	4221000	It's supposed to be like a fun goofy day or something.
4223000	4225000	But yeah, if I get a good sleep
4225000	4227000	after the Yumi Plus collab
4227000	4230000	then I have a feeling
4230000	4232000	that the next 2000 days
4232000	4234000	some more collab's gonna be up.
4235000	4236000	There's no one available on Skib.
4236000	4238000	I have never used Skib
4238000	4240000	because apparently you can't even talk
4240000	4243000	to the person in the commission
4243000	4244000	and I'm like,
4244000	4246000	if I'm paying for something
4246000	4248000	and I'm not allowed any corrections
4249000	4251000	unless I'm paying like a literally
4251000	4253000	cheapest chips for it
4253000	4255000	I'm too scared to use Skib.
4257000	4258000	Like, per Emi
4258000	4260000	she wanted some artwork Skib
4261000	4264000	or something we're planning while she's away
4264000	4265000	and then she was like,
4265000	4267000	oh fuck it, I'll just draw it myself
4267000	4268000	because she was like,
4268000	4269000	it's gonna get too much of a headache
4269000	4270000	because she was like,
4270000	4272000	it's really unreliable
4272000	4273000	because she,
4273000	4274000	I think she's used it before
4274000	4276000	and it's unreliable or something.
4276000	4278000	There's also Vegen.
4279000	4281000	I fucking hate Vegen.
4282000	4284000	It's alright but I also hate it at the same time.
4286000	4289000	I really wanna take responsibility right now
4289000	4290000	what, forget me pregnant
4290000	4292000	and being in my tummy at the same time?
4292000	4298000	It's the reason that Skib's actually really cheap.
4298000	4300000	Oh, maybe,
4300000	4302000	maybe I should look at Skib.
4302000	4304000	I'd like to get the girls like artworks
4304000	4306000	just like here and there like,
4306000	4307000	I don't know if you saw,
4307000	4309000	I got Mercy this artwork.
4309000	4311000	It was just a doodle artwork
4311000	4313000	so it's quite cheap overall.
4314000	4318000	And it was her and Serenity together.
4319000	4321000	Why do you hate Vegen?
4321000	4325000	Because I thought so, since they were all,
4325000	4327000	whenever I commissioned someone on Vegen,
4327000	4329000	I fucking messaged them on Twitter
4329000	4331000	and asked for the commission
4331000	4333000	because it's such a fucking nightmare.
4333000	4335000	Trying to like send the request off.
4335000	4337000	I'd rather message on Twitter and be like,
4337000	4339000	are you gonna accept this request?
4339000	4340000	If yes, like please let me know
4340000	4342000	and I'll say like, here's my username
4342000	4345000	on Skib, on Vegen.
4345000	4347000	Because I kind of be arse filling out
4347000	4350000	the fucking, fucking mile long essay
4351000	4353000	just for them to reject it.
4353000	4355000	I get why it's set up like that
4355000	4358000	but I'm like, go and get to fuck honestly.
4362000	4363000	We just got here,
4363000	4364000	what are you people talking about?
4364000	4367000	We're talking about making an artist request
4367000	4370000	because I don't really have an artist
4370000	4373000	that I want to draw me pregnant with a refling.
4375000	4377000	There's no other way to say it.
4377000	4380000	I need to be drawn pregnant with a refling.
4381000	4383000	I'll always take responsibility
4383000	4385000	with a refling.
4387000	4389000	Why do you know all of my buttons?
4389000	4391000	I absolutely hate those.
4393000	4395000	It's terrible right now.
4398000	4400000	I'm cleaning your ear again.
4401000	4403000	Ah, because all the steps
4403000	4405000	I was thinking of trying to draw in Vegen.
4405000	4407000	This is good.
4407000	4409000	I think if you're a creator on it
4409000	4411000	it's very good.
4411000	4413000	Although there's been a lot of feedback
4413000	4417000	about how it's like next time
4417000	4419000	possible to get a refund.
4419000	4422000	So yeah, oh my voice just cracked.
4424000	4426000	All of the artists I've worked with
4426000	4427000	ended up adding me on Twitter
4427000	4429000	or Discord, it's just so much easier.
4429000	4432000	Honestly, the guy that made all our banners
4432000	4434000	he's called Waltz with me
4434000	4436000	I'm like, would he be crazy enough
4436000	4438000	to draw me pregnant with a refling?
4438000	4440000	I think he might.
4440000	4442000	If I give him a reference.
4444000	4446000	I think I might ask Waltz with me
4446000	4448000	to do the pregnant one.
4450000	4452000	I'm trying to be given that hot-tooth.
4456000	4459000	Why doesn't Jaferero want to draw pregnant with me?
4460000	4462000	I've been...
4462000	4464000	Jaferero has been
4466000	4468000	drawing me a bit manly
4468000	4470000	the last few commissions
4470000	4472000	and they came to keep having to correct
4472000	4474000	and be like, please stop drawing me
4474000	4476000	as a man.
4476000	4478000	Please stop drawing me if I was on Twitter.
4478000	4480000	And it's kind of got to the point where it's like...
4484000	4486000	Yeah.
4486000	4488000	So I'm kind of looking to spread my artist wings
4488000	4490000	at the moment.
4490000	4492000	Try giving a reference.
4492000	4494000	Mysteries called Fish Peppers, I guess.
4494000	4496000	Yeah.
4496000	4498000	Waltz is good to work with.
4504000	4506000	What?
4510000	4512000	No, Jaferero would do...
4512000	4514000	Oh no, he's like there for anything else.
4514000	4516000	And he's like, what do you want?
4516000	4518000	And I'm like this and he's like
4518000	4520000	okay, I guess.
4524000	4526000	But yeah, recently
4526000	4528000	I've been getting drawn as a man
4528000	4530000	like a big thick neck, a big massive chin
4530000	4532000	and I'm like
4532000	4534000	kind of corrected a few times
4534000	4536000	and it's
4536000	4538000	it's not really
4538000	4540000	being changing.
4540000	4542000	And I'm just like
4542000	4544000	yeah.
4544000	4546000	So yeah.
4546000	4548000	I'm going to try and spread my artist wings
4548000	4550000	a little bit.
4550000	4552000	Then
4552000	4554000	I'm sure there'll be a few more things
4554000	4556000	from Jaferero Pop.
4558000	4560000	They can all be winners, you know.
4564000	4566000	The style changed a bit.
4566000	4568000	Yeah, no, artist style changed all the time.
4568000	4570000	Which is not a problem
4570000	4572000	but
4572000	4574000	something that changes
4574000	4576000	outside of like
4576000	4578000	a barrel chest and huge arms
4578000	4580000	the princess carry.
4580000	4582000	I'm not sure
4582000	4584000	how many more to draw.
4584000	4586000	Yeah.
4586000	4588000	So I'll see if
4588000	4590000	Waltz, I think Waltz is
4590000	4592000	Japanese.
4592000	4594000	I don't know if you guys
4594000	4596000	know this but the Japanese
4596000	4598000	yen is crashing.
4598000	4600000	Like
4600000	4602000	absolutely crashing at the minute.
4602000	4604000	Maybe I should do skips
4606000	4608000	but
4608000	4610000	yeah, it's like completely crashing
4610000	4612000	at the minute.
4612000	4614000	So maybe yeah, skips would be
4614000	4616000	way cheaper than usual but I've never used the
4616000	4618000	website before.
4618000	4620000	I hate
4620000	4622000	having to learn how to use
4622000	4624000	new websites.
4626000	4628000	But
4630000	4632000	I'm playing with the
4632000	4634000	ball crusher.
4636000	4638000	Wait, the yen's crashing?
4638000	4640000	Yeah, like I think against the dollar
4640000	4642000	the yen just continues to go down.
4642000	4644000	Like it's something weird.
4644000	4646000	I don't know why.
4646000	4648000	It's a really good time to buy Japanese stuff.
4650000	4652000	Wow.
4652000	4654000	Good time to visit as well.
4654000	4656000	Up in
4656000	4658000	the Sakura Park
4660000	4662000	I feel like we'd be so disruptive though.
4662000	4664000	We need to be quiet. We need to whisper.
4666000	4668000	It's been down since Covid but it's currently
4668000	4670000	at as low as it's like 50 cent time.
4670000	4672000	The dollar.
4674000	4676000	The what crusher?
4676000	4678000	The ball crusher.
4678000	4680000	I have this like sensory toy
4680000	4682000	and I squish it and stuff
4682000	4684000	and it feels really nice to squish.
4686000	4688000	So it is being dubbed to the
4688000	4690000	ball crusher.
4690000	4692000	Japan economy
4692000	4694000	nothing great. I wonder if the birth rate
4694000	4696000	of Japan is? I assume it's down as well.
4698000	4700000	Is there any first world
4700000	4702000	country that doesn't
4702000	4704000	have
4704000	4706000	a declining birth rate?
4708000	4710000	I want to say no. Maybe?
4710000	4712000	No. America.
4712000	4714000	America as opposed to birth rate?
4714000	4716000	Maybe.
4716000	4718000	I'm not sure.
4718000	4720000	Anything above one is good.
4722000	4724000	It is insufficient.
4724000	4726000	Time to leave to Japan and we'll be right to there.
4726000	4728000	Will we all go to Japan?
4728000	4730000	I don't know. Can you farm?
4730000	4732000	Yeah, you can farm in Japan.
4732000	4734000	But I don't think they have castellos the way
4734000	4736000	Scotland has castellos.
4736000	4738000	Can you
4738000	4740000	choose a nicer name
4740000	4742000	than why I'm making you nervous?
4742000	4744000	Streamer has too much fun
4744000	4746000	playing with the ball crusher.
4746000	4748000	ASMR.
4752000	4754000	America is on the down
4754000	4756000	as well.
4756000	4758000	I can take care of that declining birth rate.
4758000	4760000	I remember there was a post
4760000	4762000	where it was like, I don't know if it was just
4762000	4764000	an onion headline. Probably was, let's be
4764000	4766000	honest. Of course that would fall for an onion
4766000	4768000	headline. It was like Japan's
4768000	4770000	declining birth rate
4772000	4774000	makes visas
4774000	4776000	for foreigners easier
4776000	4778000	and then someone was like, step aside.
4778000	4780000	This is a job for me.
4780000	4782000	I'll fix the birth rate.
4784000	4786000	But that's the thing about
4786000	4788000	being a sperm donor. If you didn't
4788000	4790000	know, you're actually not allowed to
4790000	4792000	have more, you're not
4792000	4794000	allowed to have more than
4794000	4796000	20
4796000	4798000	children, but someone
4798000	4800000	recently, well not recently,
4800000	4802000	it made the news like a year or so ago
4802000	4804000	in America, he'd use
4804000	4806000	different names at sperm banks, so he would have
4806000	4808000	like a massive lineage
4808000	4810000	and he got caught doing it. I don't know
4810000	4812000	if he got jail time for it, because you're not
4812000	4814000	supposed to pollute the pool like that
4814000	4816000	or else it would be like a Genghis Khan moment.
4816000	4818000	Everyone's like, huh, how strange.
4818000	4820000	We're all seem to be related to Genghis Khan, I wonder why.
4820000	4822000	And it was like, my guy, have you
4822000	4824000	even hair to half the stuff that man did?
4824000	4826000	Sorry, you clean
4826000	4828000	your ears after all the filth I just
4828000	4830000	spoke there, hold on.
4832000	4834000	Okay, there we go.
4834000	4836000	Much better.
4838000	4840000	Can't be speaking about
4840000	4842000	that stuff right now, that's what we're
4842000	4844000	revealing.
4844000	4846000	That one guy
4846000	4848000	that snuck around
4848000	4850000	dozens of places, yeah,
4850000	4852000	so you didn't know about it.
4854000	4856000	Japanese birth rate
4856000	4858000	is so low that the previous prime minister
4858000	4860000	became a meme
4860000	4862000	for trying to boost the
4864000	4866000	you would think
4866000	4868000	immigration would be easier to the birth rate.
4868000	4870000	I heard that Japan's racism
4870000	4872000	is pretty strong.
4872000	4874000	It's just
4874000	4876000	quite funny
4876000	4878000	since it's like, that kind of seems
4878000	4880000	like the solution.
4880000	4882000	America's birth rate is only
4882000	4884000	because of immigration.
4884000	4886000	One of our states, Alabama,
4886000	4888000	has had its first statewide population
4888000	4890000	decline in the sense of
4890000	4892000	speak more filth.
4892000	4894000	We enjoy it.
4894000	4896000	There's a reason his lineage
4896000	4898000	spread far and wide.
4898000	4900000	Exactly.
4900000	4902000	In a real article, Japan
4902000	4904000	released a dating app
4904000	4906000	for people who are looking for
4906000	4908000	committed relationships to get married
4908000	4910000	and have children.
4910000	4912000	So like, the opposite
4912000	4914000	of any other
4914000	4916000	Western countries
4916000	4918000	dating apps.
4920000	4922000	Imagine hundreds of years later
4922000	4924000	and there are historians wondering
4924000	4926000	who this singular man
4926000	4928000	who has a 20-way pattern formed
4928000	4930000	or Japan is almost
4930000	4932000	allergic to immigration.
4932000	4934000	I used to watch lots of videos
4934000	4936000	from Japanese YouTubers.
4938000	4940000	There's this girl called Shaila
4940000	4942000	in Japan, or Shadamander.
4944000	4946000	It's kind of like her nickname.
4948000	4950000	And she talks about Japan a lot.
4950000	4952000	She talks about running
4952000	4954000	a bed and breakfast series, which is
4954000	4956000	really cute. She renovated a house
4956000	4958000	into like a Neko
4958000	4960000	bed and breakfast and they were so
4960000	4962000	cute.
4962000	4964000	I find it quite sweet
4964000	4966000	and adorable.
4966000	4968000	Japan started using China to
4968000	4970000	increase the birth rate. That's sad.
4970000	4972000	Eh?
4972000	4974000	You mean modern day?
4974000	4976000	Or do you mean
4976000	4978000	the history we do not speak of?
4980000	4982000	Shinzo Abe
4982000	4984000	is no longer asking.
4984000	4986000	That reminds me, I made a meme for
4986000	4988000	Emi of that. I don't think she's ever posted it.
4988000	4990000	Before I met
4990000	4992000	the girls, I made like a few memes for them
4992000	4994000	each to post on Twitter if they wanted to
4994000	4996000	because I was like, I have no idea what they want to do
4996000	4998000	on Twitter. And one of the tweets
4998000	5000000	is a, one of the
5000000	5002000	meme pictures is Emi holding a gun
5002000	5004000	and she's like, I'm no longer asking her
5004000	5006000	things.
5008000	5010000	Japan has multiple dating apps for gamers
5010000	5012000	and mates that are all owned and run by the
5012000	5014000	government.
5016000	5018000	It's giving
5018000	5020000	date or you shouldn't have your hand
5020000	5022000	over it.
5022000	5024000	A declining birth rate is a good thing.
5024000	5026000	Our planet can't sustain all of us.
5026000	5028000	I, I thought
5028000	5030000	our planet could sustain us is because
5030000	5032000	of what we do to it. Like, we can't
5032000	5034000	sustain. Not that we want
5034000	5036000	infinite growth of humans, but
5036000	5038000	like,
5038000	5040000	I thought
5040000	5042000	someone
5042000	5044000	draws vtuber's prego.
5044000	5046000	Are they cheap for this?
5046000	5048000	Are they gonna draw me holding my belly
5048000	5050000	all happy
5050000	5052000	in smiling and then a little
5052000	5054000	rifling attached to me in like a
5054000	5056000	little insane shot with a rifling
5056000	5058000	in the umbilical
5058000	5060000	card?
5060000	5062000	Are they gonna do it?
5062000	5064000	You made memes for them?
5064000	5068520	memes for them. I made memes, I wrote their ASMR scripts, I wrote some of the shorts.
5068520	5075720	I think Amy's the only one that has shorts up that I didn't write like her story about
5075720	5080600	that haunted house and she got grabbed in the middle of her sleep as she slipped next
5080600	5087160	to her mum. She did some stuff that I didn't make. But everything else the girls have done
5087160	5091880	I made. And they're all kind of waiting on me, but I'm going to spank them and be like
5091880	5097760	ok, your debut period is over now, you need to start thinking about doing stuff for yourself
5097760	5103600	because I can't be doing it for everyone. But yes, I tried to set them up as best I
5103600	5108440	can and it certainly worked out. If we've all hit 5000 subscribers in our first month
5108440	5115560	that's fantastic. Pregnancy is kind of so wholesome, I don't know why it has a stigma.
5115560	5120160	Probably because the child is a parasite on the woman. Did you know that the reason why
5120160	5125440	women forget that childbirth is so painful is because that's an evolutionary trait to
5125440	5130760	trick you into wanting more children. Even though it's the most traumatic experience
5130760	5135840	and most dangerous thing you will ever go through in your entire life as a woman.
5135840	5143000	Eee-dee! Science Facts with Stormy. Would you like more science facts about pregnancy?
5143000	5149920	The child, the body diverts as much nutrition to the child first or parasite as I like to
5149920	5156360	call it. Which leaves some mothers who lose their teeth, lose their hair, lose some of
5156360	5165360	their sight. Yeah, it's pretty rough if you want to be pregnant out here.
5165360	5177240	Teach them how to fish. Biology 101. Yes, pregnancy is absolutely terrifying. If you
5177240	5184320	actually know what goes on behind, how easy it is to hemorrhage, die in childbirth. Even
5184320	5192200	C-sections, how it leaves you with a lifelong inability. Pregnancy also damages your bladder,
5192200	5197960	it also damages your back passage during the birth. You can quite literally create one
5197960	5208080	singular rip in between the panini and the baby. So yeah, don't, don't recommend pregnancy.
5208080	5213000	Congrats if you want to go through it. It will turn your nips brown. That's the only thing.
5213000	5222160	So if you're used to them being pink, don't be surprised. They change color. Life is just
5222320	5230440	suffrax and honestly, do not be a whammin' and do not get pregnant is my advice. I was
5230440	5234240	in the room when my youngest bro was being birthed. It's a horror for, oh, it is not
5234240	5240840	for the faint of heart. It is not. And like, if we're not memin' for a second, you know
5240840	5245360	how the meme's like, oh, would you rather get punched in the balls or birth a child?
5245360	5256040	And then like, oh, I'm a C-section baby. You're removed like a chipper. That's a fact
5256040	5262600	why I've never heard before. Oh, it's so dangerous. It's unbelievably dangerous. Wait,
5262600	5268880	what did I just come into? I'm currently ranting about how dangerous pregnancy is whilst trying
5268880	5277480	to harass an artist to draw me pregnant with you. So you're gonna be in my tummy and I'm
5277480	5282400	gonna make a weird ASMR where you hear my tummy sounds and I'm talking to you and saying
5282400	5291120	how much I love you and I can't wait till you should come out and achieve all these things.
5291120	5301240	My nips are already brown. Well, then you make me a different race than me, then. Unfortunately,
5301240	5307640	I'm as pale as they come. My nips practically blend in, honestly. Sorry, this isn't an ASMR.
5307640	5319640	I'm just fucking ranting about pregnancy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you guys get DM'd
5319680	5325800	by that feature that wants you to draw a pregnant tooth? Trying to get around Vore, but still
5325800	5333800	want to use the sense that it's pregnant, eh? There's a reason diet and childbirth is a
5333800	5342160	common trope. It is. You can also get a thing called coffin birth. If a mother who is, her
5342160	5348600	ego is pregnant when she passes away and so does the child, the buildup of guesses actually
5348640	5355480	expelled the child on that has been dubbed coffin birth. Just thought you should know.
5355480	5362040	Not very nice. Aye. What's that? I'm just like an endless source of repeating things I've
5362040	5374040	heard or learned. Sheesh. Okay, let me actually do this. I'm sorry for freaking you about
5374040	5379480	the facts about me being pregnant after you made me pregnant. Refling, okay? I'll stop
5379480	5383480	scaring you. Thank you for being brave, your mommy's bravest soldier.
5405000	5413480	ASMR. Let's learn each front name and I'm not ASMR, because let's be honest. Wow.
5413800	5415800	ASMR.
5429960	5431800	Where's the Vore ASMR?
5432360	5445240	I wanted to do giant test 4 with a zero. I didn't write the script yet. Well, I
5445240	5447480	don't think I'll be writing the script the whole of this, right?
5450120	5457320	I could definitely do a siren. Vore's you. Giant siren, because I'm a siren. But I'm
5457320	5463160	actually a cowfish. See, I'm a siren that can't sing, so I had to use something else.
5463160	5467800	And then I went for hypnotic abilities, so then I became a cowfish. I don't know.
5467800	5470280	Don't ask about the lore. I didn't, I didn't come up with it.
5472120	5474360	Is this what miski was here 24-7?
5476440	5481240	Creasy, I think I just found out what coffin birth was today. Get educated, get educated, get educated.
5487320	5489320	ASMR.
5503160	5508440	Millen right now forever. I would prefer wholesome siren to bad ending siren.
5508440	5515640	Where I just fucking hypnose you and tear a mouth and then keeps you in your stomach so you can't sleep.
5517400	5521640	All your bases are belong to us. Okay, you ready? I'm gonna, I'm gonna swallow you right now.
5535400	5537800	And then this says you're going down into my tummy, okay?
5537800	5551640	You're in my tummy now. Do you hear my tummy?
5551640	5567480	There's my tummy. It's making lots of noises.
5582280	5587480	So basically, that's what the pregnancy ASMR is going to sound like, but I'm just complimenting you on that side.
5591400	5595080	Oh, this is what it sounds like when I'm pregnant and you're safe in my tummy too.
5598440	5599960	Oh, my little reef egg.
5603000	5605480	Hot dog. This place is magnificent.
5605880	5611800	Okay, well, let's spit you back out of my tummy now.
5616520	5620200	I shouldn't have swallowed you. Okay, I'll bring you back up.
5623880	5628680	I'll bring you back up my tummy, but first, first what?
5628920	5632440	You get to listen to my heart, so I'm gonna do so.
5639400	5640920	How much is the rent in here?
5641000	5660280	Now, let's spit you out. You're already coming back up. You're back up in my heart now.
5660280	5661880	I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.
5669640	5672760	I don't want to go out the other way, exactly. Either I spit you out of my mouth,
5672760	5677400	or you come out the other way. Your choice. And I'm already on day five of being backed up,
5677400	5679640	so you'll be sitting for a while.
5679880	5689880	Wait, it's all cold. I don't even have any cold.
5694200	5697000	Okay, I think I'm ready to spit you out.
5710040	5714600	I'm replaying. There you go. See, it didn't swallow you for long.
5714600	5718280	That just reminded me. I need to order artwork of me eating you like a Calamari
5718280	5723720	squid that's still alive. You know those Japanese fucked up mukbangs?
5723720	5727080	Oh, wait, no, is it South Korean? I think it's South Korean. Or is it Chinese?
5728040	5733720	Shit. I think one of them was a South Korean girl, and she was eating stuff alive.
5734520	5737560	I just remembered I have to order an artwork like that as well.
5737560	5741080	Oops, because I'm going to bore you alive.
5742920	5746280	I've been on a mean way. I'm not going to chew, so I don't hurt you, okay?
5748360	5751960	Oh, you don't want to be back out here? You want to be back on my tummy again?
5756200	5757160	Oh, you should be.
5760200	5763720	That was a fun read. Did you enjoy it? You're all slimy now, though. Hold on.
5764680	5767480	I think I need to... I'm going to wait for you down, okay?
5768200	5770680	Because you're all covered in musk, but I just need to...
5780600	5787000	Did you hear my tummy? My tummy's asking for you to go back and say you're very king, but right now...
5787880	5796040	What am I listening to? I just swallowed you, and then I just un-swallowed you.
5796040	5798440	But now I'm cleaning the spit off of your ears.
5800280	5803400	I'm sorry if you're used to AC's really cute ASMR.
5804200	5806760	Here, we get a little freaky around these poles.
5811160	5812440	AC, how about you tell them?
5813400	5816680	Okay, so Strani's really fucking weird.
5817720	5825000	I don't know why, but she just tries to make everyone happy,
5825000	5828840	but it comes out with really inappropriate stuff.
5830440	5832840	Thanks, AC, for that recap. I'll do it.
5835400	5836120	You're welcome.
5838200	5840840	Yeah, I do come out, actually. Thank you, AC.
5841640	5842040	What?
5848920	5853240	I need to get more of the spit off of your insomnia. There's so much spit.
5871800	5879320	Okay, I think you're dry. Oh, that's pretty good. My wife is here.
5880600	5881720	That's good enough to do it for her.
5884440	5890360	I don't know, kind of. Actually, I get to find out in my RuneScape stream what kind of stuff the
5890360	5895960	girls have been up to because I get to watch the girls. For Azura's one, I'm going to watch her
5895960	5901880	monetization stream. I'm going to see if there's like two hours each girl has done,
5901880	5907000	because if I watch two of her streams from each girl, that's 10 hours of RuneScape wings.
5908360	5911160	And then I get to do a commentary on the girls.
5913400	5920840	Yeah, I gave you a little species too. Just a test. Sorry if you hear me tell me.
5920840	5925080	Just a test that it's a little dry. Yeah, you're dry.
5926280	5933080	Okay, wow.
5942280	5949080	When is Elden Ring the lore video watcher? There's lore videos on Elden Ring, aren't they?
5949480	5956440	I love that you've collabed with Yunya. Well, it was probably a given, to be honest. It was
5956440	5960920	probably a given. All things considered.
5964840	5974200	Shibi is coming online in 20 minutes, right? Oh no, it's going to be on my tummy.
5974680	5991320	Please tell me you're running the ASMR. You're running the experience.
5998840	6003400	Did we finish the Elden Ring DLC? No, we're taking a break on it, because
6004520	6011560	I've fucked my health up, so I can't do any more endurance for a few days.
6013000	6021640	She says, as she has, what's coming up? I've got mechisol, which is apparently eight hours,
6021640	6028760	but I don't believe it. And then I have membership ASMR, which is one tingle equals one clap.
6029480	6035720	I thought that was quite creative myself. So you guys tell me whenever you tingle in the stream,
6035720	6043640	and then I clap. In that way. There is a Mama Yunya collab. Yeah, you're allowed to watch it
6043640	6048040	after I finish streaming, but if I redirect into Shibi, then you have to watch Shibi.
6050920	6056120	Balthro, I don't know how long we're gonna go for, but I'm definitely gonna need to start being
6056120	6064760	a bit kinder to myself with the endurance streams until my health gets back, because I've been
6064760	6075080	very silly. I'm not looking after myself. She says that she does three streams in a day, but
6075080	6080920	it's not hard to do three streams because it's two hours at ASMR, which I'm literally just about to
6081000	6086840	finish off. And then we're gonna write a script. I'm gonna go offline, make a cup of tea, get a
6086840	6091880	cola, and then we're gonna write a script together, and then I'll gauge if you guys enjoyed it. Like,
6091880	6096280	I'll do a poll at the end of the stream, and either you say you enjoyed it or you didn't enjoy it.
6096840	6101480	And then I take a break, and then I put up with you, me plus, and I hope you're ready for the
6101480	6108120	scrunch break. It's only seven days while we talk about your period here. You aren't gonna
6108120	6113720	last clapping that much. I can do it by default. I don't have to do anything special to clap.
6115720	6121960	Like, do I need to- did you not see the new short? Hold on, I'm gonna link a short in chat.
6123160	6131800	Okay, I'm gonna link a short in chat. It is 20 seconds long. You are welcome to watch it right now.
6132760	6137480	Okay. You may watch this short. I give you permission to watch it.
6140360	6145400	I'll wait 20 seconds. I'll just do blooping ASMR for 20 seconds whilst you watch that short
6145400	6146520	that I've linked in chat.
6146840	6163720	Wait, no VLR members streaming? Oh, no, it's gonna be. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute,
6163720	6167000	I forgot. People don't normally stream multiple times, and there's a lot.
6169560	6173800	Once you're healthy again, keep looking after yourself. Challenge impossible. I want to play
6173800	6178520	Elden Ring. I want to get carried. Carry me, carry me, carry me, plop, plop, plop.
6180360	6181800	I could totally make that audio.
6184520	6187720	Oh, I'm so tempted to make a Twitter audio now that I've said that out loud.
6190600	6192840	Oh, I'm so tempted.
6196520	6202040	I'm so tempted to literally, plop, plop, plop, and say get carried, carry me, carry me,
6202840	6207000	until fireworks. Oh, I shouldn't have said that because I don't want to do it.
6211240	6216840	No hands clapping is a talent for sure. So now do you believe that in the membership ASMR
6216840	6222440	I can clap? Every time someone says I tingled when I do something, I tingle you, then yeah.
6224600	6228920	Please carry me audio. Yeah, literally. Please make that Twitter audio. I just might.
6229800	6236280	I just got what she meant by holding her jibblies. Yeah, my boobah. I need to hold them in place
6236280	6241720	because when I jump up and down, they jump with me. Surprise. We all are just one person.
6243160	6248040	Yes, please do it. Do it. You want no boss? No boss. That's how you say it in Scotland.
6248040	6252680	If you either say the plate way, which is a double donut to your year, or you say
6253480	6257400	shake bag if you didn't, or you say date new boss.
6270120	6274840	What if the plopping gives tingles, infinite tingles? No, I have to actually do something.
6275480	6279000	You can't just be like, I tingled because like I moved across the room.
6279480	6281160	No, it doesn't work like that.
6285560	6290760	My stomach is making some cringey. You have a very particular skill set, yeah.
6291640	6293240	I mean, I could do it right now if you want.
6297880	6302760	So this is a sample of what's going to be happening in the members ASMR. Hold on, let me just,
6303240	6306120	I'm not sure if I'm going to hear it if I don't know.
6308600	6313240	Infinite tingle exploit. It's a video game. Oh, should I make a video game, but it's all
6313240	6320840	about clapping? Okay, hold on, I need to do it. My headset, I was actually hearing what the heck is
6320840	6331160	going on. I don't know if I'm jumping to the left though because I have to like pretty much
6331160	6342200	the jump to the left. That one's on the house. Okay, I'm completely in the chair again.
6344760	6349160	How high can I jump? Not very. I don't have much of a vertical leap.
6349160	6354360	Let me put this back on.
6360920	6361640	What the heck?
6364360	6365880	I have a wet patch, what's it called?
6369720	6375000	She doesn't know, maybe if I had to move her in a video game, one would be like inking,
6375960	6381560	two would be clapping, three would be banshee screaming, and four would be
6385400	6391880	tea something. The tick damage on this glass. Okay, there's that back down again.
6392920	6395720	Sorry, add that, add that, go back on, it's quite cold.
6396520	6399080	That's a great talent man, I can do it.
6408120	6411800	I think we've just discovered a terrible oversight by myself. I don't think I can
6411800	6420600	redirect into a viewer member. Community, community? No, unity in shambles right now.
6421320	6427480	Analytics, no not analytics. Redirect, is there anyone who can redirect online?
6430600	6436360	There's no one at UMI Plus online either. That's it, VNU, I'm looking at you next.
6439720	6446440	Oh wait, Mero, Mero might be coming online. We Mero, listening to this while studying,
6446520	6450040	me studying hard, Tescare, small, grabbable.
6454600	6460680	What did you call me, a grabbable cuttlefish? I don't think I've ever been called a grabbable
6460680	6471720	cuttlefish, that's amazing. A grabbable cuttlefish. Okay, Mero's not coming online until a couple of
6472120	6482120	hours. Thank you so much for the five fabry mathy, fabry mathy. Enjoy your studying,
6482120	6488120	sorry if I made it hard. Honestly, it's me, what's going to happen? The most vital thing I heard
6488120	6494120	about someone with the large butt, look at the arsonat, look at the arsonat thing, you know she
6494120	6505720	can shake, that's fucking mean. Oh my god, squeeze the cuttlefish, hold the cuttlefish,
6506360	6511160	get mesmerized by the cuttlefish, get mained broken by the cuttlefish.
6511400	6524520	Okay, now there better be someone online at VNU headquarters, I'm gonna scream,
6526520	6535080	I'm going to subscribe to literally everyone right now, so it tells me who the heck is online.
6536040	6544360	Okay, I'm gonna close, I'm gonna refresh my page, damn girl, you're shooting it.
6549480	6557320	Oh, there's not one VNU girl online right now, what's going on at VNU headquarters, please?
6557880	6565480	I can't fucking handle it right now, so we're doing fucking that 4v maria that can never
6565480	6572840	spell right, 4v, 4v maria. So you can literally hear all that click, I'm like desperately trying
6572840	6578280	to find someone to redirect into because I don't want to like, it's not like I'm gonna waste,
6578280	6584840	wait maybe Rem's doing that ASMR thing. Oh come on Rem, okay I'm gonna refresh the page again,
6585400	6590920	surely there's someone we can redirect into, surely some of the other streamers online that
6590920	6597560	doesn't hate us as an agency, oh for fuck's sake not one of them's online, this has to be a joke.
6598360	6614040	VNU and 4v maria didn't have one person online, that's not possible.
6614760	6618040	And of course mythos don't stream on YouTube because that would be too easy.
6618600	6637640	No way, no fucking way, was it mythos, HQ really don't stream on you on this,
6638440	6647000	not the body don't. Oh no they do, question mark, wait hold on,
6647000	6650200	pause the phone, why do I not think, why do I think they stream on Twitch?
6655080	6656040	Why did it, oh,
6659000	6663080	VR, can't you see, oh sorry if you're gonna fucking call yourself sort of abstract,
6663160	6667320	didn't you expect dumbasses like me to understand what on earth is going on,
6669320	6674040	Rem, oh Rem comes online in nine minutes, okay I'm gonna ASMR the fuck out of you.
6676760	6681320	Okay we're gonna redirect into Rem, redirect to a surrounding couple, she's streaming right now I
6681320	6689000	think, literally, right, when I redirect into Rem, my little pumpkins please, don't be,
6689080	6700360	don't, don't, I'm comfortable with you because I love you, I don't know what other VTubers
6700360	6705720	comfortability levels are, like you know how we're complete djans out here, we're just saying,
6706520	6713320	we're allowed to be, but just, wait Rem isn't too, I don't say that,
6714120	6718120	no he's, Rem isn't, Rem isn't coming up, wait, what,
6721880	6727400	whoever that wiefling says that Rem is coming online in nine minutes,
6729480	6731560	no, no she's not, destroy that man,
6734520	6739480	doesn't Merrow stream in seven minutes, no Merrow doesn't, like you mean Merrow,
6739880	6744520	Merrow, it says Merrow's coming online at 12 p.m.
6749160	6752200	No, is it, can I read, is there anyone,
6754680	6759400	you could read strongly, she's live in seven, she is live in seven minutes on a member stream,
6761080	6765400	can't, can't redirect to our members, is there not one person, there has to be one
6765400	6770600	fucking streamer up right now, fucking, how desperate, wait, is it baked on,
6775640	6779240	mods, hang drawn for that wiefling, okay a bit dramatic, but no,
6781960	6790040	nope she's online at nine a.m, oh freaking the screw, mods smack that man silly,
6790760	6795400	you could read Maid Mint, is that not inappropriate of me to do that though,
6799160	6800760	she's playing out her words,
6803880	6807640	is that inappropriate to do, I don't know, I feel like it's inappropriate when it's like a big
6807640	6815800	Vtuber, they're just like, do you know Pillowdeer, oh Pillowdeer's an ASMR, hold on a minute, Pillowdeer's
6815880	6822120	an ASMRist, and she's playing Minecraft, why my darling, okay Pillowdeer's getting it because
6822120	6830840	she does ASMR, um, she does it, oh for fuck's sake she's playing Minecraft with that fucking
6830840	6835480	inappropriate server that I can't interact with, okay Mint Maid is, so Mint Maid is,
6835480	6839960	congrats Mint Maid, I'm going to interrupt your stream with a host of randy wieflings,
6840440	6848200	oh goodness gravy, I'm trying, okay please do be super respectful when I redirect into Mint Maid,
