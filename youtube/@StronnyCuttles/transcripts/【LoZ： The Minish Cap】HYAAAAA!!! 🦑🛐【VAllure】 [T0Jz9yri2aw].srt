1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow, there we go.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fall into your hand, I commend your spirit.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Testing, testing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I know it's kind of hard just to get off one, two, three.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He asked for a thirteen, yeah?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He drew a thirty-one, so he's trying to hard.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good morning, good evening, good after.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Below the name.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am none other than Shony Culls and I am playing...

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It took me a really long time to be able to screen capture

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
my legitimate Game Boy Advance that I own.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, it's fantastic.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Really, really fantastic technology.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
May or may not, I have just softlocked my PC

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and that is why I had such trouble getting on fucking line.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But lo and behold, we are here.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm just gonna make sure...

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so this...

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This thing.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, we're good.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This thing.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh my god, oh my god.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I should become an opera singer.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm that bloody good.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's that?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have smoke up my ass.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, my little reeflings.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Today on the agendination.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you doing okay?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, I'm farting up a storm, so alcohol definitely makes you fart more,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if you want to know.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Um...

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Uh, what's my sentence?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Um, in four hours time,

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we're gonna do a membership stream,

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
which isn't actually up right now.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Cause...

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I maybe didn't put it up yet.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Me?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been able to get something up?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Impossible, impossible.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Um...

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wait, what's our name in Zelda gonna be then?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, sorry.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The legend of long.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wait.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Was it AB?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uh, right.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ah.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh wait, the in-game character is gonna call us Anon.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, call us Link.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Link.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We came to town.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We came to save.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Uh, yes, we are doing the forbidden tier list ring.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I am gonna need a kind reefling to send me the Link

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and marshmallow, cause I actually don't even have the Link.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Uh, cartoffel of doom.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you very much for coming to member.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, everyone's need to go and show the number.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh!

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why would you never?

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Save file.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do not touch the completely legitimate Nintendo.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wow.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Damn plane.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The controls are a bit wrong, but...

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wah, I'll read it.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't worry if you can't read.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll read it for you.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A long, long time ago.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A tiny picori appeared from the sky, bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
With wisdom and courage, the hero drove out the darkness.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When peace had been restored, the people enshrined that blade with care.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You've never played Minish Cap?

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The funny thing is, Minish Cap is the only Zelda game I've actually played.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, it's Zelda!

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is what the entire series is named after.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This little pink pixel here.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The entire series is named after her.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because everyone...

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ah, made the mistake of thinking that Link is called Zelda as well.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Good morning, meh.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Good morning, meh, meh.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Good morning, Princess Zelda.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Did you sneak out of the castle and come all this way alone?

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The moon is so sure to be worried about you.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You know how he gets.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Where's Link?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The whole town is bustling for an annual picori festival.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I thought he and I might go together.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Would you mind? Terribly.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, is that what you're here for?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, Link was up late helping me last night and he's still asleep.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But I don't have an errand at the castle.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes. Oh, but I do have an errand at the castle.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, that should be fine.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ah, yes, Legend of Zelda.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Kinks of Weakening, Ike, Void Sword...

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Void Sword, sure.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you for the tip. I don't think I was going with Void Sword.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But yes, that should be fine, yes.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Link! Time to get up!

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Did I see Nintendo Direct today? No.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Link! Link, I said it's time to get up!

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Eh?

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Man, I was fapping.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Goddamn, got that morning wooden shit.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just love these pixel games.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh my god, did you know in the VTuber community, someone is making a Legend of Zelda inspired like little fucking Cedar game?

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like, you're at a cafe and shit? I'm gonna be all over that stuff.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hold on, funding it right now.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Huh?

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh shit, my freaking tea.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hey, Link!

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Princess, then it lies how I should like to know if you'd like to join her at the festival.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah Link, come on, let's go check out the festival together.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Master Sith already gave me permission to take you.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, handed off like a dog.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, after all, the festival only comes once a year. God, have fun.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And while you're there, you can do me a favor.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I just finished making the sword for the minister at Hyrule Castle.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'd like you to deliver it to him.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You, you accepted the sword.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Make sure you don't lose this extremely important delivery. I won't.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the blade that will be presented to the winner of the competition.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't lose it. And while the two of you may be childhood friends, remember...

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Are you?

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Remember, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You watch over her, don't let anything bad happen to her.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Master Smith, quit worrying. I'll be perfectly safe.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, Link, let's go. Check out the festival.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hold on, let me take a little flip.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Friends owned. Are you joking me?

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you remember that meme that went really viral?

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And it was like, a knight. It was like a princess and a knight

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and the princess was getting like booed by the crowd or something.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Now sell it. You can't sell a sword.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, you called me a sell sword, exactly. I got you. 4k.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Check out the festival under her skirt.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Rifle ends. You're feeling it the day you knocked in Ellie's.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, if I'm not mistaken, if you're a snowberry,

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
there should be a membership ASMR going on right now.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Question mark. I have no idea.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think that's from Aces schedule.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Mercy's off the day. I'm trying to use my autism.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Azura is also off today.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Emmy and Sheebie is on.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sheebie has a collab and Emmy has a collab

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and a day's time with people not in real life.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you, question mark. I can't remember what they're playing today.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right. She had to reschedule.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She pushed it to tomorrow. It's delayed.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, probably Aces' call. Alright, okay.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Je comprends, je comprends. Right, let me try and host this honey tea down.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Next week, we're going to write the honey tea plot together,

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
so I see exactly what you want me to say and I was so fucking excited.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wow, listen to that music.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is a Game Boy Advance game.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, listen to that harp, that harmonious.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wow.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's so good.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I saw it.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I was going to actually consider making the songs for Jin to be still for this game.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The rules are, if there's any more background music that gets produced,

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
it has to be a childhood game or a game that I really like.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But Zelda is very peaceful, but I'm not actually sure we have any peaceful concept.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And Jin too.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So far, I don't think anyone is peaceful.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't think we have one peaceful person at all.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Azura. Azura is peaceful. She's peaceful.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This would do Azura with a harp.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I maybe should have gone with a harp.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I would be real. I don't even remember all from yesterday.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Turns out chugging a ball. Oh my God, you did not have a football ball.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Strony, what's your opinion on the new Zelda game?

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Whatever your opinion is, because I've never played it.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the only Legend of Zelda game I have ever had access to and played.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What about Earthbound? I don't know what Earthbound is.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to the controls on my...

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not going to open this chest because it's got money in it,

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and I don't want to waste that opportunity to have that money.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But look how freaking adorable this pixel art is.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is this not freaking precious?

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going to give it to the princess like this.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, you take that.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wait, can I do it over the bed?

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on. Oh my God, there's two beds for me in the print.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, you like that. Oh look, I'm making my bed.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh look, I need to get all the sheets all smoothed out.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't want any creases.

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh yeah, you like that princess.

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I need to practice and I need to get my practice in

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
for what happens after the festival.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, teach you that better lesson.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yo, is that the master sword?

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Earthbound is a game...

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
is a game Ness is from.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Might have seen it in Smash Bros. It's an old Nintendo game.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, come with us.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Making the views.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Link, over here.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, sorry, sorry, Zelda was just pumping.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sorry, I was just having a cheeky pump.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right, how's the roll button? Oh, there it is.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Link, hurry, let's go.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You moan in like every sentence.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is that how you normally talk?

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Over here. Come on, hurry up.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Princess, what's going on here?

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, here we are.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm trying to play.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Princess, princess, it's first thing in the morning, hen.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Wah!

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Here we are, Link. Doesn't this look fun?

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Come on, let's look around.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wow, look all the free colors.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm getting stimulated.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Welcome to the PCORI Festival.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They say that every 100 years, the PCORI comma high rule.

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And this is the 100th year to the day

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
since the last time the PCORI were here.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wah, hello, princess.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Link, here's the storyteller here.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We should stop and listen to...

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I wonder what's over there.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Jeez, you got ADHD, princess.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't need a little stimulant.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can stimulate you.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So the PCORI are real.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
My father always told me they were.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, look at that.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
As long as she's happy, that's the main thing.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, wasn't there going to be

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
a sword fighting tournament at the castle?

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I wonder who won this year.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, wow, over here.

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, it is this.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, pardon me.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We have a winner.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh my.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh my, Princess Zelda.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You won the grand prize in her drawing.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wow, that's totally not rigged against everyone.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You get your choice of any of these wonderful prizes.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What will it be?

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
First, we have this lovely heart-shaped stone.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Next, we have...

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This magnificent gem.

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And finally, there's this tiny shield.

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So which one will you like?

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let me guess.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The jewel?

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, but this heart-stone is very cute, too.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Choose whichever one you like.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This shield is so adorable.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I heard that.

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
She likes a small tiny.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think I'll take it.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Following Strony around the convention

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
late to the school arts alley.

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What?

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm looking for Rebecca art.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What? Why?

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why would you want that ugly thing?

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What about the heart-stone?

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's cute.

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, or this giant gem. It's pretty.

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Honestly, they're both much nicer

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
than that nasty little shield thing.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Jeez.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can I put this in a script?

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Nope, I want the shield.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Can I have it?

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What a strange princess you are.

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, okay.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Here's your teeny tiny shield.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Here, I want to give you a present.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It'll match the size of your...

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Doesn't the shield suit you perfectly?

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Like...

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Give you a small shield.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hold the button to protect yourself.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It is a little embarrassing though.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's so tiny.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What the heck is going on here?

295
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, he's stutting on him.

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yep, just as I thought.

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You look great.

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Now, if anything happens,

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you can protect me with that shield.

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, I almost forgot.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We have to take Master Smith's sword to the castle.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's go, Link.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How do I do this?

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I will protect you, my lady.

306
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
My lady, come, come, my lady.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You must sugar fly.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
My bunny, my heady.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's not the words.

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, what the fuck?

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sorry.

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This game explains your first outing on Patreon.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Come on, Link.

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's hurry to the castle.

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Bonk.

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh!

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey!

319
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Ouch!

320
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Not to be the business scrub...

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Business scrub.

322
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's me.

323
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Business scrub.

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait, that is the same.

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It must be the business scrub.

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I heard the soldiers talking about it.

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They were just saying a dicky scrub

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
had been hassled in all the passages by...

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Link, do something about it.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Otherwise, we can't get to the castle.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If only we had some way to defend ourselves

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
against those nuts of his.

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Wait, what?

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's too early in the morning.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's too early.

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Please forgive me, sir.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I heard that was a festival

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I came to town helping my...

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to hawk my words.

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Unfortunately, we scrubs have a tendency

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to spit nuts as we speak.

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Everyone's got scared and ran away

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and no one would buy anything.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is a terrible place to do business.

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm going back to my cave.

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I actually feel a little sorry for that business scrub.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But that net hurt!

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh well, he won't be hassling anyone now.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We better hurry to the castle.

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wow.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm getting Australia overload.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's kind of the part of the plan, you know?

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You see, we've not executed the plan yet

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but there's many ways to main break them.

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm sorry, Link, but I'd better go.

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have to prepare for the ceremony.

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I had a good time at the festival.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Thanks for coming with me.

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Since you're here, Link,

360
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
why didn't you join us for the award ceremony?

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No point in going home, old chap.

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Just join us.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why not? You're here anyway.

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, look, it's me and the boy, Potho.

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I do know about that sword, Link.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It is called the PCORI BLADE

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and it looks much evil.

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What?

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And it locks much evil away in that chest.

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Sorry, it's a bit early in the morning

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to be talking about Gothic architecture.

372
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The PCORI BLADE is sacred among the people of Hyrule.

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The legend has it that, long ago,

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the PCORI gave us this blade.

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Whoever wins the competition

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
earns the honor of touching the sacred blade.

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Would you let me touch your sacred blade?

378
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Whoa, big daddy in the horse.

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Fuck's it, he's truly twice the size of his elder.

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let the award ceremony commence.

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Avati, champion of the competition,

382
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you may approach the blade.

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Was that Conqueror's Bad Ferdy?

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It absolutely was.

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
King Chonk of Hyrule.

386
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To think things would go this well,

387
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the PCORI BLADE and the bone chests

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
spoken of the Hyrllian Reborn.

389
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This chest must hold that which I seek.

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I relieve you of its contents now.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Do not interfere with that.

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Me?

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
As Victor, I earned this right to approach the PCORI BLADE.

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I've been waiting for this moment.

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know why Scottish people are evil, but...

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh wait, maybe they'd be British, like English.

397
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've been waiting for this moment.

398
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, okay, sorry.

399
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Protecta Zelda?

400
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Eh, yeah, no, let's do it.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wait, what's the British voice?

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Who are you?

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why are you doing this?

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh wait, that's Zelda.

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The princess with the mystic aura.

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The power that was gifted to the people of Hyrule

408
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
still flows within the veins of that lady.

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The veins of the ladies of its royal family.

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Interesting.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If I leave you now, you will only cause me trouble later.

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That will never do.

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
To stone with you!

414
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Run now!

415
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ah, Zelda now!

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
All who stand in my way shall share this fate.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now to find out what power awaits me in the chest.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Ete!

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There is nothing in there but a rabble of monsters.

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What's the meaning of this?

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, I know the force and I'm after it's somewhere out there.

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm in no hurry.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can take my time searching for it.

424
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Classic British stealing things.

425
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Exactly, yes.

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I thought Star Wars reference too, but I'm probably just...

427
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh my god, we're in a castello!

428
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh my god, this is the Borgia Castle, clearly.

429
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wake up, wake up.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Put on a little bit of makeup.

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, we need to make the bed for the maid.

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

433
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, you want to take over?

434
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, hold on.

435
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh shit, I interact with people when you do that.

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was gonna hump her, but I interact with people when you do that.

437
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Erlink, you're awake.

438
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Are you feeling alright?

439
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Stand at my side.

440
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The king of Hyrule is about to speak.

441
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It is as you have all heard.

442
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A sorcerer named Vati has cursed my fair Zelda and turned her to stone.

443
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If we had the sacred PCORI blade, we likely could have broken the curse.

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But Vati shattered the blade.

445
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
However, I have not given up hope.

446
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What do you know about the PCORI?

447
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Er, the PCORI, not much.

448
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Beyond what?

449
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh fuck, these both have the same voice.

450
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Beyond what the fairytales say, they're supposed to be very tiny if I remember correctly.

451
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It is the ones from the fairytales, but the PCORI are no mere legend.

452
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They are certain exists.

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No one outside of the royal family knows the truth about them.

454
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The PCORI who forged the sacred blade lived deeper than the Minish Wars.

455
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They should be able to repair the broken blade and reforge the sword.

456
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What?

457
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There must be dispatch the soldiers there at once.

458
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
No, soldiers will not do.

459
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The PCORI do not show themselves to anyone but children.

460
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Our soldiers could search for days and still fight no cycle.

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I see.

462
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That's the case, then why not send Link?

463
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If Link has recovered then yes, I would like to ask him of this.

464
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Please, turn my precious Zelda back to normal.

465
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The PCORI should know how to create a new sacred sword.

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It will be a dangerous journey, now that those monsters have been freed.

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Please, take the sword with you along with the broken PCORI blade.

468
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Broken PCORI blade!

469
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is part of the sword needed to be forged with sacred sword. Do not lose it.

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Smith sword!

471
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's a sharp blade made by your grandfather.

472
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Very well then.

473
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Very well then. Send the soldiers to search for that in the world.

474
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Deep within the Minish Woods you will find the place called Deepwood Shrine.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Once, humans and PCORI ship that shrine as a meeting place.

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I think it would be best if you started your search there.

477
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Take this map with you.

478
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If you get lost on your way to the forest then please check your map.

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Just press start and then this stuff.

480
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I've marked it on the location of the forest view.

481
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Gluck and be careful.

482
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You got the map of Hyrule!

483
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Now you'll never get lost.

484
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Bottom right.

485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You have to go bottom right, okay?

486
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The child will learn to kill. Send the child.

487
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The child and yearn for the mines.

488
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I am counting on you, Link.

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Only you can break Barty's curse of free princess.

490
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Okay, let's unprofessionally roll out of this castle.

491
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I like the game. What's the name of the country?

492
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is based in America? What?

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The Chales will become a man.

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Be a man.

495
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You must be slipped as the Corsing River.

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Man, you must just take off that dress.

497
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Fire through the mouth.

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Man, you must just take off that dress.

499
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Miss...

500
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You're in my way, you're in my way, you're in my way.

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's fine. I'll forgive you.

502
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, we got coins!

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You've got one rupee. It's green. Don't spend all in one place.

504
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You guys wouldn't spend me all in one place, would you?

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I've not accidentally left reverb on, have I?

506
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
One coin, let's go.

507
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You guys will have to remind me at the four-hour mark I'm to get off,

508
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
because we're playing the rest of the game tomorrow.

509
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm doing the Forbidden Tearless, and I already didn't forget.

510
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes, I have played this game in childhood a couple of times,

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
so I'm not too terrible.

512
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Watch me eat my words in about an hour's time, but...

513
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You can't do anything yet.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm not in one place, but I'm sure you can.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You're awesome.

516
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Multiple, but multiple, please.

517
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I know, I can't believe that I'm not finishing a game in one go.

518
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's absolutely crazy. It's terrible.

519
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Help! Help me!

520
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Ouch!

521
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Want somebody stop him?

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Ow! Ow! Help! Somebody!

523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Can't anyone hear me?

524
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't want boys to get these guys.

525
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No, it's definitely a guy-hat.

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
There are many hats in the world.

527
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But this is a guy-hat.

528
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hey, kid, you there!

529
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, don't just stand there, do something!

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Ow!

531
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What's wrong with you?

532
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Do you like watching me take this piss?

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

534
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well done, that was close.

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Now that I couldn't handle that myself.

536
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But that's beside the point.

537
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What in the world is a lone child doing so deep in the woods?

538
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I see.

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The PCORI, you say, in Vati?

540
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Vati's curse someone what?

541
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The Sacred Blade?

542
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Is that so? I see, I see.

543
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay, you know, you know, I have quite a lot in common.

544
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You see, I too am on a quest to break the curse of Vati's.

545
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And you say they reforged the Sacred Blade can break...

546
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That reforging the Sacred Blade can break his curse, eh?

547
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Well, then you have found yourself a companion, my boy.

548
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
My name's Ezlo.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

550
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Speak.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
What? Is there something on my face?

552
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Quit staring, it's rude.

553
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Wait, wait, wait, I said.

554
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You walk so quickly, too quick in fact.

555
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Can you go any slower?

556
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Certainly you've noticed that I have no legs.

557
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Boy, take a good look at me.

558
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Do you really think I can walk that fast?

559
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Eugh!

560
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If this isn't one thing, it's another.

561
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're a troublesome boy.

562
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There, now you can't possibly leave me behind.

563
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
My, it's actually quite comfortable up here.

564
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
More comfortable than it looks, surely?

565
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And much easier on me.

566
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Hey, quit your squirming, can't you sit still?

567
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
See, there, there, there you go.

568
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

569
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's it, much better.

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now, I suppose a boy like you still has much to learn about the world.

571
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
If ever you needed my insight, press select.

572
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'll be happy to help.

573
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Eh, such a hopeless child.

574
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Ta-da!

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We have hats.

576
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Look at the drip.

577
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Read the drip.

578
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Read it.

579
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Read the drip.

580
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Is it posing?

581
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Is it starting on the floor?

582
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Look at the drip.

583
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Look at that hat physics.

584
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Look at the physics.

585
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
When I go forward, the hat doesn't sing.

586
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Hold on for a moment.

587
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
My boy will stumble across something important.

588
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The world of the Minish is very small

589
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and you're far too big to meet them now.

590
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Eh?

591
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Where's the Minish?

592
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Ah, yes, silly me.

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Allow me to explain.

594
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You humans call them Bakori,

595
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but they refer to themselves as the Minish.

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Strange how, in the world of humans,

597
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
only this forest has kept the name.

598
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Anywho, deep in the forest, they built a tiny village.

599
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
They were many who...

600
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, a good woman.

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Live now.

602
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But if they're where to enter the village,

603
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
we'll have to make you a touch smaller first.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Look at that.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
At first glance, it appears to be a mere stump, yes?

606
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
No.

607
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That stump is the portal used by people long ago

608
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
to adjust their size.

609
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
With my help, you can use it to shrink down to Minish size.

610
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Just stand at the stump and press this button.

611
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
To return to normal, stand again and press the button.

612
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Get me up there and we'll give it a try.

613
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Humana, humana, humana, humana, humana, humana.

614
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh my god, we're in a tiny...

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh, look, we're doing butt bouncing on the wee mushrooms.

616
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Always so pretty cute.

617
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Welcome to the world through the eyes of the Minish.

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Now, aren't you glad you saved me?

619
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No need to thank me, though.

620
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Portals that reduce your size are all around

621
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
in different shapes and sizes.

622
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If you want to return to normal,

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
stand next to the portal and press N.

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But there is one thing you must know.

625
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Being Minish-sized is full of dangers.

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
With mere puddles at your normal size are bottomless pits.

627
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And as your companion, if anything bad happens to you,

628
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it happens to me, too.

629
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So proceed with caution, my lad.

630
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If not for your sake, then for my own,

631
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
why is the heck is he starting to scandinavian?

632
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Anus bibanus?

633
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What? Anus bibanus?

634
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Thank you for the tip.

635
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Wah! Oh, sorry, sorry.

636
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Neat timing, neat timing.

637
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Wah, wah, wah, wah!

638
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Red voice speedrun?

639
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh.

640
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Ah!

641
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Nando desu.

642
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I was there, I was there.

643
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

644
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Look, it's an acorn.

645
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Look, it's an acorn.

646
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Look, it's a leaf.

647
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Look, it's an acorn.

648
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Look, it's a leaf.

649
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Acorn.

650
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And there's clover.

651
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Minnish village.

652
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Wow.

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Hmm.

654
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It appears we have found the minnish village.

655
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We don't understand them yet,

656
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
so they're just gonna go...

657
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I gather it's been quite some time since they last saw a human.

658
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
What's that?

659
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You don't understand what they were saying just now?

660
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Ah, yes.

661
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That was the language of the minnish.

662
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That's a little different from the dialect I'm most familiar with.

663
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm afraid I didn't catch most of what they said myself.

664
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But perhaps there is someone here who understands your language.

665
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We should look around.

666
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So we need to find the village elder,

667
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
which he should be up here for now.

668
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh.

669
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You got a heart.

670
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They replenish your life a little bit.

671
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I never played this.

672
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's so pretty.

673
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's a cute little pixel thing.

674
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Good voice acting thing.

675
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fried my voice.

676
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Ah, Denpa.

677
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I finally recorded my side of the line,

678
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
so I need to edit it.

679
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Soon.

680
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Soon I will update you, Denpa.

681
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

682
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Pick up the heart here.

683
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You got a piece of heart.

684
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Select four to make a new heart container

685
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
for even more life energy.

686
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
One of the best pixel art games,

687
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
they put their whole penussy in this.

688
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's what we see.

689
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Right, we're now talking to the elder.

690
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I've never seen an outfit like that before.

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Are you a human?

692
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh my, it's been some quite some time

693
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
since any human has come here.

694
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
My name is Faustari.

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I watch the abbey as well as the shrine in the north.

696
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You seem to be having some trouble with our language, aren't you?

697
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

698
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You could use the jabbernut.

699
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It will allow you to understand our tongue.

700
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You should be able to find one in the barrel else,

701
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
just selfie.

702
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'll make them cockney.

703
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I need to start using the cockney accent

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
because I'm starting to blend all the guys' voices together.

705
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I think this is above or below?

706
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think it's below.

707
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, no. Don't climb that again.

708
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Check.

709
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Uh, like, this must be the jabbernut.

710
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't know what voice I gave him.

711
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This must be the jabbernut for Starry, told you about.

712
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Well, you'd be better eat it if you plan on making any progress at all.

713
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That's what I'm just making, I'm Scottish.

714
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You ate the jabbernut, now you can understand the language of the Minnish.

715
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I think I'm just going to have to make my hat Scottish

716
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because I can't for the life of my mix of these.

717
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Make sure it's all the...

718
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Wait, what do I need dinner?

719
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I can eat, do I go back to the abbey?

720
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So you've eaten the jabbernut,

721
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is you're eating the jabbernut yet?

722
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And now you can understand us.

723
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, sorry, but I know a little bit about the sewers.

724
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm just the elder.

725
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm sure the elder can help.

726
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, yeah, head over to the elder.

727
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah, you're not my problem anymore.

728
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Now you've got the jabbernut inside you.

729
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay, to the elder.

730
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Hello.

731
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Bro, I'm out of accents.

732
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, I'm making French.

733
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, you must...

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You speak our language?

735
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's been quite a while since we've heard of outsiders

736
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
speak our tongue.

737
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We have a little to offer you in these woods.

738
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But please enjoy your stay.

739
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Thank you for your...

740
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Thanks for your offer,

741
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but we have no time to relax.

742
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
My name is Ezlo.

743
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
This trial is link.

744
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We need to break a curse

745
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
that has been cast on the Princess of Hyrule.

746
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
To do so, we'll need to reforge the broken PCORI blade.

747
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes, you have come.

748
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You're now hoping to have the blade reforged.

749
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I will...

750
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
If that is what you are after,

751
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
you need firm mystic elements.

752
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We...

753
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wait, wait.

754
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
These elements are the chrysaline

755
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
firms of the energies of this world.

756
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Only by infusing the blade with these energies

757
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
can a new blade be forged.

758
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes, so here.

759
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Give me your map.

760
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I can mark out where these three elements are.

761
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Three elements can be found as three elements.

762
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh!

763
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, these elements, not three.

764
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I've not got my glasses on.

765
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The earth element can be found in the shrine

766
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
to the enough of Fastari's army.

767
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Speak with the Fastari.

768
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
He will show you the path to the shrine's entrance.

769
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Go without caution.

770
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Go with caution.

771
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Evil creatures have a little middle home in our shrine.

772
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes.

773
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Wait.

774
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Speak to me at once,

775
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
if you have found the earth element.

776
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay.

777
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
As a French, that makes sense.

778
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Perfect.

779
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Forget it.

780
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
French people cannot stop themselves from going...

781
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's the only...

782
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
If you ever want to assimilate as a French person,

783
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
just go...

784
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
In between your sentences

785
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and instantly you're French.

786
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You used to go to the shrine very well this way then.

787
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I will be settled in recently.

788
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Just be careful.

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's a bit dangerous.

790
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We need an Aussie accent somewhere.

791
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh!

792
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh, sugar.

793
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I forgot to pick this up.

794
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We'll pick it up.

795
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We'll pick it up on the way back.

796
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Don't let me forget this.

797
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Equals French.

798
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You can hug the upper right side of the tower for a heart.

799
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah.

800
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I was talking about there being monsters inside, didn't I?

801
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Hey, now.

802
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There's no reason to be afraid of anything.

803
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'll be waiting right here though.

804
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
No, wait.

805
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
What am I saying?

806
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm not letting you leave me alone out here.

807
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No, because you're not being myself.

808
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Right, I can't...

809
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't have the sucky pot yet.

810
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But there should...

811
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There is a heart piece in here.

812
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Can you guys see that fine?

813
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Does the brightness seem fine?

814
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Because I keep mentioning this.

815
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
My Crash Bandicoot stream.

816
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The display was correct for me, but wrong on stream.

817
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You've got a small key.

818
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Use it to open lock doors and blocks.

819
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You can use it only in this dungeon though.

820
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's all good.

821
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Good to go.

822
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay.

823
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
There's a lock door here.

824
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
See if you can find the key to...

825
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm a few steps ahead of you, but it's okay.

826
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Maybe just a little bit drop on you.

827
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Honestly, I thought that was really creative.

828
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Do you see that level?

829
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I think you should be able to pull it.

830
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Just stand in front of it and press and then grab it.

831
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Then use...

832
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Pull it.

833
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Look at this detail.

834
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If you keep pushing, the space turns red.

835
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Like, come on.

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I have to admit, Nintendo cooked a little bit for this one.

837
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Mug.

838
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Not today.

839
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Wait, is this...

840
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, if you want to do a little backtrack and just do that.

841
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Well, they'll have a grunk.

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Right, you cannot hurt these guys yet.

843
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Whoa, look at the size of that barrel.

844
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, how silly, but sorry.

845
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's not big, we're just small.

846
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Sorry, sorry.

847
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Forgot about that perspective and everything.

848
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know what I mean?

849
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I mean, you've got to respect him.

850
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Sorry about that.

851
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You cannot hurt these guys yet,

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but you have to like push them out of your way, basically.

853
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Is there anything up here?

854
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No.

855
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I love the Game Boy Zelda games.

856
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They're fire.

857
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What's the other Game Boy Zelda games?

858
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I might have to give it a try.

859
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So don't mind us.

860
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Just scoo...

861
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
scoozy me.

862
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
A little bit of scoochy cream.

863
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Push it in.

864
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
That's the budget.

865
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Push it real good.

866
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So we have now unlocked the barrel,

867
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
so it can now rotate when we're inside.

868
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So all we need to do is...

869
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, here, I think.

870
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I think.

871
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What?

872
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Hey, be careful.

873
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm allowed to barrel just moved.

874
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Wait, maybe?

875
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Is this one quick?

876
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Is it?

877
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
No, I'm getting rabied.

878
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Is this one first?

879
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Is this one first?

880
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Is it?

881
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
No.

882
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Wait.

883
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Ah, it was that one.

884
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I knew it was that one.

885
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm just thinking of you.

886
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The link to the path.

887
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I played the hiccup.

888
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Link's awake.

889
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Link's awake.

890
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Maybe we should give it a shot.

891
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Is it easy?

892
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
This is supposed to be a kids game,

893
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
but I have to admit,

894
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the boss fight at the end...

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
God, it's three hits now.

896
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The boss fight at the end?

897
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
No bueno.

898
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So we just want to do...

899
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I see the heart.

900
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So we're going to push that out

901
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
so we have access to what was here.

902
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't know.

903
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
No.

904
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Ah, don't destroy this paw.

905
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What we need now

906
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
is starting to hold down the switch.

907
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Wait, I'm on it.

908
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm on it.

909
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Then you worry.

910
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Just don't play Metroid Fusion.

911
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
10 out of 10.

912
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I hate it.

913
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What?

914
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh, 10 out of 10.

915
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You hate.

916
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Wait, is this a shortcut as well?

917
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah.

918
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm just going to make sure

919
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
we've unlocked all the way

920
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
shortcut things along the way,

921
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
because...

922
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Once you take hold of Sotun

923
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
with mm-mm-mm-mm,

924
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you can push a pill

925
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that should be extremely important.

926
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So I hope you take these pointers.

927
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
There you go.

928
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I will.

929
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm taking the pointers.

930
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
There we go.

931
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Sorry.

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm having a stroke there.

933
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Hold on a minute.

934
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Use it to unlock the doors.

935
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Absolutely.

936
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
2D Zelda game

937
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
didn't really change anything.

938
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I already...

939
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I pushed that, but it reset.

940
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
They announced a new 2D Zelda game

941
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
where you play as Zelda.

942
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Okay, wait.

943
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Maybe I will have to check out

944
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Nintendo Direct,

945
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
because if it's cute,

946
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but it's kawaii-nee,

947
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
they've got me in a choke hole.

948
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I can't believe the stereotype

949
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
of girls playing games

950
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
because they're cute is real.

951
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You found the dungeon map.

952
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Okay, let's go.

953
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Now what?

954
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh, we got...

955
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, did I just swap that around?

956
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'll survive.

957
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's Ogre, the new Zelda.

958
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Literally, these gender norms have hands.

959
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I can't believe it.

960
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What do you mean I'm only going to play a game

961
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
because it's cute?

962
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What do you mean that

963
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Viva Pina is the most adorable thing

964
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
and they should remaster it?

965
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
They're just the perfect little...

966
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Open...

967
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Open...

968
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Cuman.

969
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What's the plan?

970
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What's up here?

971
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Is there something up here?

972
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Is there something down there?

973
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Is there something for everyone?

974
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Right.

975
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Will we go that way first?

976
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We'll go down first since this...

977
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I like how they were like,

978
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
no, you're not going to lose any health

979
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
for not being able to judge the...

980
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the distance.

981
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Nice to see you play a classic.

982
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

983
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm like trying to do

984
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
one childhood game

985
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
so I can show you guys

986
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
like how I'm cultured.

987
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh!

988
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I actually lost some health for once.

989
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So you need to move this one out of me.

990
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes, I'm trying to do at least one

991
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
childhood game every week.

992
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Did I say a month?

993
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think I might have said a month.

994
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Every week type thing.

995
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
This is just exciting.

996
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You...

997
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The one thing I like about this game

998
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is you can spam the sword

999
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and nothing can hit you

1000
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
because they have to bounce back.

1001
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's actually a really good design.

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm sorry.

1003
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I said it.

1004
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's a really good design.

1005
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay, we've got Pina.

1006
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Any Halo players?

1007
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Absolutely.

1008
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So a Halo campaign

1009
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
can be played multiplayer,

1010
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
which I'm interested about

1011
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
possibly grabbing some worlds for.

1012
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know

1013
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
if I'll need to hunt for each of them.

1014
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That play Halo or maybe.

1015
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Azura really surprised me.

1016
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, there's a heart.

1017
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I got freaking jumped here.

1018
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
See you, you wee bam.

1019
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Oh, fuck I missed.

1020
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Sorry, hold on.

1021
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
See you, you wee bam.

1022
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
There.

1023
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Right, I'm pretty sure

1024
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
we get this weapon in here.

1025
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So I want to go in here.

1026
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's Black Ops to the childhood game.

1027
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'd say Black Ops one hour.

1028
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh my god, maybe.

1029
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So this wiggly worm,

1030
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
he becomes enraged,

1031
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
but don't worry.

1032
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You just need a boofy snoop.

1033
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I just got booped in.

1034
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Aha, you know that.

1035
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And you need to hit his butt.

1036
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Take this.

1037
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Take his spanking.

1038
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And he just runs around

1039
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
like a wiggly worm.

1040
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And he spank his nose.

1041
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And then you go get his boinkins.

1042
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Spank that boink.

1043
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And now

1044
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
we have the gust jar.

1045
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Hold the button to draw things in

1046
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and release to fire them out.

1047
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Set it to air B in the tail screen.

1048
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So the one thing that's a bit

1049
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
hard about this game

1050
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
is there should be a heart down here.

1051
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yes!

1052
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I got a piece of heart.

1053
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I only need two more.

1054
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And I think there's one more in here.

1055
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I mean, I guess we could open up this,

1056
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
but I just don't like doing anything.

1057
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Give him the souk jar.

1058
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Now

1059
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't know what one it is.

1060
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, there it is.

1061
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, you can like find hidden things.

1062
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Ten mysterious shells.

1063
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
We don't know what the shells are for yet.

1064
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh, I don't know.

1065
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So all those tiles that are like dusty

1066
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
basically

1067
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
we want to clean them up

1068
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
because I think they give like hidden

1069
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
rewarding stuff.

1070
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But we can just do it like that.

1071
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's up.

1072
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh, we've unlocked a portal to that heart.

1073
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's so good.

1074
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay, so when they have no dust on them,

1075
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
they're vulnerable.

1076
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
When they have no dust on them,

1077
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
they're vulnerable.

1078
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Did we get anything

1079
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
if we could perish them all in this room though?

1080
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
No, we didn't.

1081
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think there's a chest under this one

1082
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
because look at the fireplace.

1083
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, look at the fireplace, man.

1084
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The game like literally screaming in your face

1085
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
like there's something hidden here.

1086
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Please look for it.

1087
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Okay, I don't think we have to do them all.

1088
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I guess super suck.

1089
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Can I suck them?

1090
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, I can.

1091
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Man, push it.

1092
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Now there's a puzzler.

1093
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I suspect there's not much more we can do here right now.

1094
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Let's press on.

1095
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Perhaps we can work this from another angle later on.

1096
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So the game, right, I got a bit...

1097
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Can I touch that chest?

1099
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Sorry, let me touch that chest.

1100
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I never even tried.

1101
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The game is very nice.

1102
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, okay, we can touch it.

1103
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Listen here then.

1104
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I thought remember.

1105
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You got a compass.

1106
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Use it to find locations of hidden items.

1107
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't remember this in childhood.

1108
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh!

1109
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Wow, big.

1110
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Big, big, big, big.

1111
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay, head up back out.

1112
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay, just start again.

1113
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I almost certainly touched the chest.

1114
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
A new hand touches the chest.

1115
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Do you want to touch the chest?

1116
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Wow!

1117
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh, I will say one thing about these older games.

1118
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It hurts my soul when you, like,

1119
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
defeat the enemies, but they don't stay defeated.

1120
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That's the only thing that hurts me.

1121
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay, we've got our mysterious shells.

1122
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh, mysterious shells.

1123
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Wait, wait.

1124
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
No, we need to fall down in here.

1125
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Are you ready for Lily Padling?

1126
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Can I hurt you from here?

1127
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I can!

1128
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The game actually registers as a different height.

1129
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
No war.

1130
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Unless you find a way to travel by water,

1131
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
we want to be going much farther.

1132
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We are now going down Lily Pad Lover's Lane.

1133
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And then I just pop it.

1134
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm actually surprised the game registers height like that.

1135
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I thought I could kill that, but I don't know.

1136
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I can't believe it.

1137
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They actually made a quality game.

1138
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't know how close they need to be.

1139
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah, there we go.

1140
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Um, I think it's just a reward if we go this way.

1141
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh, no, it's not.

1142
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
There's a key.

1143
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We need a key, but we don't have it.

1144
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Lover's Boatwright Destroyer.

1145
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Literally, we're on Lily Pad Lover's Lane or something.

1146
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
All the raids are always called that Lover's Lane.

1147
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It comes to those romantical ones.

1148
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
A bit romantical.

1149
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Right, this one.

1150
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh, I could probably actually use that one.

1151
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh, Lover.

1152
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
We just need a classic pot on the switch.

1153
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Very good game.

1154
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah, like, see how I wasn't even facing that enemy,

1155
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
but the game was still like, yeah, you got him.

1156
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Have I got my blank?

1157
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Ah, my blank is not here.

1158
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm gonna have to come back.

1159
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm gonna have to go get him.

1160
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Because I'm hurting my leg.

1161
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm killing the circulation.

1162
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Oh, this is not looking good.

1163
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Got a small key.

1164
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, you don't have to specify it small

1165
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
every time you talk about it, okay?

1166
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm starting to feel personally attacked

1167
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and I don't even have any in there.

1168
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And the game cannot stop.

1169
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yay.

1170
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Set properly.

1171
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Literally, my legs are against the table

1172
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and it's caught in circulation.

1173
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I should take a picture of my legs

1174
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
to show you how severe it is.

1175
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I'll maybe do that.

1176
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh!

1177
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Link.

1178
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Buddy.

1179
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Buddy.

1180
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Small key to go with that

1181
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
embarrassingly small shield.

1182
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Literally, I was like, wait a minute.

1183
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This is the dialogue I was...

1184
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Oh!

1185
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I thought, I thought, I was just like,

1186
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
have I done that wrong?

1187
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
No, I can suck on this.

1188
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh, dude.

1189
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
What did we get?

1190
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You got the big key.

1191
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, thank you, game.

1192
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You're so nice.

1193
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Thank you for complimenting me.

1194
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I appreciate it.

1195
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Oh, we can get that other heart piece.

1196
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I think I got it.

1197
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Okay, let's grab that now.

1198
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
See, if I grabbed that one at the freaking start,

1199
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
we would have had a new heart container.

1200
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Link is the reason there's a main-the-gap scene.

1201
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I don't really remember if it's left or right.

1202
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, oh, it doesn't matter.

1203
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We got 20 rupees!

1204
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
We're rich!

1205
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We're rich!

1206
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Gold!

1207
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
We're rich.

1208
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Okay.

1209
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That's an impressive amount of suction.

1210
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Thanks!

1211
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm sure if I was more awake,

1212
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I could probably do something right now.

1213
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Was that a joke?

1214
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Oh, wait!

1215
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Something, something, suck.

1216
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Oh, wait!

1217
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, no, it didn't open up my little sound thing.

1218
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You guys can't hear it.

1219
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Hold on.

1220
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Hold on, hold on.

1221
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Let me open it up.

1222
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Sorry, sorry.

1223
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Something, something, suck.

1224
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, thank you.

1225
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Thank you.

1226
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Thank you.

1227
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You're far too kind.

1228
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Right, you ready for first boss fight?

1229
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Wow, that was really funny.

1230
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yes, exactly.

1231
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No, please laugh.

1232
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Wow!

1233
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's a little slamer.

1234
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Right, you ready for first boss fight?

1235
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Can we do it?

1236
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, no.

1237
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
He's coming through into the temple.

1238
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So you have to suck his bottom.

1239
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And then he'll get a wobbly head like that.

1240
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And he'll follow you and like collapse on you.

1241
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And then you just...

1242
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Okay, and then he gets back up again.

1243
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
That boss literally being...

1244
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Is that how I would defeat you?

1245
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Just give it a little cheeky.

1246
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And then he gets quite a bit strong...

1247
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Oops, sorry.

1248
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I pointed the wrong way there.

1249
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay, and then, yeah.

1250
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It's a really good boss fight.

1251
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I think it's really...

1252
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh!

1253
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I can't hit the button any faster.

1254
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I think he jumps for a bit now.

1255
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You don't want to...

1256
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Oh, wait, no.

1257
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I think he infinitely jumps.

1258
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Oh, no, he doesn't.

1259
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I lied.

1260
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
He doesn't infinitely jump.

1261
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know why I thought he did.

1262
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Oh, he's almost there.

1263
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
He's so skinny.

1264
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oh.

1265
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Now, if we have done it correctly,

1266
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
he should be down when he foxes we had done.

1267
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
There we go.

1268
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Spam, spam, spam!

1269
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Hey!

1270
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We did it!

1271
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yippee!

1272
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
First boss down.

1273
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
He'll send it to the music.

1274
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay.

1275
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Danny turned the game up.

1276
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We have gained the earth.

1277
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You got the earth element.

1278
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The power of the earth is the source of all living things.

1279
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
The earth element is the embodiment of that power.

1280
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Sounds like a lean acquire.

1281
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You got a heart container.

1282
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Your life energy has increased and has been replenished.

1283
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Pushybee, strongy shoots down the slime.

1284
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I just...

1285
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Right, I'm happy to discuss this.

1286
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
No, there is absolutely no slime in development for Gen 2 or Gen 3.

1287
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I have no interest in the slime.

1288
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Slimes are incredibly hard to design.

1289
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Like, if you think of Sue from Monster Musume and all of that,

1290
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
it's just...

1291
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
There's nothing to it.

1292
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There's nothing fun about it.

1293
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Just any...

1294
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Now, for a Halloween outfit, sure.

1295
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The girls can go nuts if they all want to slime variations.

1296
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Sure, knock yourself out because there's going to be nothing to it.

1297
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Ah, we've got the earth element.

1298
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
We've got the earth element.

1299
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You must go and tell the elder at once.

1300
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Unfortunately, I don't think we can come back and get this heart until later,

1301
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
which is fine.

1302
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's not actually a big deal.

1303
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But I know for a fact I'm going to forget it's there.

1304
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And then I'm going to be like,

1305
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Eh, where are all these hearts hiding?

1306
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That doesn't...

1307
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Okay, well, we'll have to do that then.

1308
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, so there's no slime in production.

1309
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So, you have found the earth element.

1310
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You are blessed with much courage and strength for once young.

1311
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
If you are...

1312
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
If you are conviction and strong,

1313
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
head to Mount Crennel.

1314
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
There, you will find a man named Meliari among all of the Minish.

1315
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
There is no one more able to repair your sword.

1316
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
If you ask him,

1317
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I am certain you will reforge your broken pecorri blade.

1318
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I shall send the world to him in advance.

1319
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Travel safely, you are brave,

1320
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
but there are so many evil in the world.

1321
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm so sorry if there's any French.

1322
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Désolé, Français.

1323
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
People.

1324
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
If you screw the door here,

1325
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
it will take you out of the forest.

1326
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Great Eldor, we are in your debt.

1327
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
We shall head for Mount Crennel at once.

1328
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Oh, excuse me.

1329
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Sorry, excuse me.

1330
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Oh my God!

1331
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh my God, we need to...

1332
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
We need to make our village like

1333
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
hobbit and Minish related and

1334
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
like this is so cute.

1335
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Imagine everyone had their own bedroom

1336
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
and then like one by one I come and wake you up

1337
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and maybe not wake you up

1338
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
but just in my room.

1339
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Alright, what's going on in this mushroom?

1340
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Hi!

1341
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Hello!

1342
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Green clothes

1343
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and a mystical eye.

1344
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Can we hear Brian?

1345
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm one of the reeflings you beat in Connect 4,

1346
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so I'm dumb,

1347
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
but I'll catch up tonight either way.

1348
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Enjoy it strongly.

1349
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The members stream is a tier list.

1350
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
It's not like any game player or anything.

1351
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Thank you, Tiny Spiny, for the tip.

1352
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I appreciate it.

1353
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Strongie is so anti-slim

1354
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
because she wants to turn herself into a slim cutfish.

1355
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Just feel like reeflings look so slim now.

1356
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Green clothes and a mystical hat.

1357
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Sir, would you have a chance to be linked,

1358
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
the one who found the earth element?

1359
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Surely you are.

1360
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I've heard so many tales about you.

1361
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I am Belary,

1362
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
researcher of antiques.

1363
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I am also, oh well, a bit of an inventor.

1364
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
You know, you won't be able to get back to your town

1365
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
due to all the debris.

1366
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Here, I have something that might come in handy.

1367
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Bomb bag!

1368
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And it has 10 bombs in it.

1369
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Now you can blow up lots of stuff.

1370
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
For free?

1371
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Let me know if you find it useful.

1372
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Sure, thank you so much.

1373
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That was so kind of you.

1374
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I appreciate that.

1375
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I now have Bomba.

1376
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The child now has access to C4.

1377
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We will check these.

1378
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Holder of the Sacred Powers.

1379
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We grant you the power of wind.

1380
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Well, it blew up.

1381
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Hey kid, look where that stone marker used to be.

1382
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There's some strange symbol on the ground.

1383
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes, of course, why this must be...

1384
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Well, I haven't the foggy, to be honest with you.

1385
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We will learn later what that does.

1386
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
If I go up, what's up?

1387
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Minish stuff.

1388
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Minish stuff, don't mind me.

1389
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
We are not ready.

1390
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So we're going to equip our Chicky Bomb.

1391
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Chicky Bomb de la.

1392
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
We cannot use our sword against that,

1393
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
so we're just going to have our freakin' C4 out.

1394
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Um...

1395
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Where did you come from?

1396
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I can't remember what's over here.

1397
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So let's go for it.

1398
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh, Bomba.

1399
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Okay, what's in here?

1400
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Thank you, Meat Man 53, for becoming a Mimble.

1401
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Hello.

1402
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Hey, look at this Kinstone piece.

1403
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Have you ever seen one like this?

1404
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
What?

1405
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You don't know what a Kinstone piece is?

1406
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Well, I'll tell you what.

1407
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Why don't you come back and see me when you get one, okay?

1408
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Okay, we need to go into town

1409
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and unlock Kinstone pieces next.

1410
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And then we'll come back to this nice little...

1411
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Oh, there's a Bomba.

1412
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
There's a lot of things that need bombs.

1413
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Holy crap.

1414
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They were like, yeah, you unlock bombs now?

1415
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Oh, there's bats!

1416
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't want it to hurt me.

1417
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I got 20.

1418
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Whoa.

1419
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Mysterious shells.

1420
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I don't want to fight those guys because they're stinky.

1421
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I will bomb this though, just so we have access to the path.

1422
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Oh, you know what?

1423
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Well, we're here.

1424
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
We're actually at the start of the forest.

1425
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm going to pick up that other heart

1426
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
because that will be our fifth heart container.

1427
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Sorry, sorry.

1428
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I know I'm backtracking better than I know.

1429
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I know, I'm sorry.

1430
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Hey, you forgive me?

1431
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Oh, I just made that fall off.

1432
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
What was up here again?

1433
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I already forgot.

1434
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Did I even check?

1435
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1436
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Can't swim yet.

1437
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Can't swim.

1438
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
That comes later.

1439
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
We'll very quickly grab the heart of...

1440
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Peter, Andre, Jumpscare.

1441
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Was that his song?

1442
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Like, Mysterious Girl.

1443
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I remember...

1444
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Right, this is just so British, yeah?

1445
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So if you have no idea who Peter, Andre, or Katie price is.

1446
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Ta-da!

1447
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
We now have five heart stones.

1448
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's magnificent.

1449
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Magnificent.

1450
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
This game only has four dungeons, right?

1451
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, we are technically one fourth of the way through the game.

1452
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Because once you pick up all the elements,

1453
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
things go very quickly after that.

1454
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Like, very, very quickly.

1455
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Okay, we are now going to hit the town, boys.

1456
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And now that we have a sword,

1457
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
we can clear out any stuff that's in the way.

1458
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
High rule town, so it's no longer in celebration mode.

1459
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Oh.

1460
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Come one, come all!

1461
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
See how many kingstone pieces you can collect.

1462
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You never know what fusing kingstones will do,

1463
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
but it's sure to be good.

1464
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Come on up and get your free kingstone bag

1465
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
for holding your kingstone pieces.

1466
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Don't miss out on this incredible

1467
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1468
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yes, yes, you're here for your free kingstone bag, aren't you?

1469
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's right, maybe you didn't hear me,

1470
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
but they're free for all kids right now.

1471
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
You got king, kingstone bag.

1472
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You can now carry kingstone pieces,

1473
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
so we're going to go back to that other one.

1474
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This guy looks like a scumbazer.

1475
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Fitting two kingstone pieces together

1476
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
is called kingstone fusion.

1477
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
If you get two pieces to fit perfectly,

1478
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
great happiness will come your way.

1479
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I'll put the kingstone pieces in your kingstone bag

1480
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
so you can give it...

1481
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
If I read kingstone one more time, you're done.

1482
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You're done.

1483
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Nah, I'm not reading that.

1484
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Anyone who's willing to fuse the stones

1485
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
would look like how I do.

1486
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
When you see that look in their eyes,

1487
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
that's when you press the left trigger.

1488
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Use to choose the kingstone pieces

1489
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and press this button.

1490
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Did you catch all of that?

1491
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yes, do not ever repeat that again.

1492
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yes.

1493
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Then stand in front of me and press E.

1494
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yes, yes, that's it. Press E.

1495
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What does it do?

1496
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The pieces fit together.

1497
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Maybe something good will happen.

1498
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Free kidney stones?

1499
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Wow, where's that?

1500
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I think that's bottom right of our house.

1501
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
So we'll give it a little check.

1502
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
We'll give it a check.

1503
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It is bottom right of our house.

1504
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I knew it. I knew it.

1505
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I recognise it.

1506
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
A perfect fit.

1507
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That means we're both dudes for happiness soon.

1508
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'll see you.

1509
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Okay.

1510
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Now, in order to acquire these pieces,

1511
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
you basically just get them naturally

1512
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
from cutting grass and stuff

1513
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and doing your chores.

1514
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
They appear out of the bushes.

1515
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And you can buy them in a shop as well.

1516
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But of course, none of them are spawning.

1517
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That would be far too easy.

1518
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Maybe in the grass?

1519
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Hello, is anyone hating the grass?

1520
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Nothing is spawning.

1521
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I wonder if we have to progress again a bit more.

1522
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Not one piece in the grass.

1523
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Oh, spider!

1524
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
We're fine, we're safe.

1525
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Bruh.

1526
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Nothing is spawning.

1527
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I mean, I'm not going to say no to the rupees

1528
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
because we're going to have to end up buying them.

1529
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
They're a rare drop.

1530
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Oh, we got a heart!

1531
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
You got a piece of a heart.

1532
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Collect four to make energy.

1533
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I didn't think they were that rare.

1534
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh!

1535
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
There we go.

1536
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
These mystic stones bring happiness.

1537
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yes.

1538
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I didn't think they were that rare.

1539
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I think they're relative.

1540
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Holder of the sacred powers,

1541
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
we grant you the power of the wind.

1542
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Hey!

1543
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, sorry.

1544
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You know what?

1545
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
No matter how many times I see that,

1546
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
it still rouses me

1547
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
because he doesn't know what the symbol is.

1548
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Right, we're going to go back to that little guy

1549
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
because he was really excited

1550
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
to tell us about Kin Stones or something.

1551
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Where was he?

1552
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
He was down here.

1553
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Hi, buddy!

1554
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We're back!

1555
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Just like you asked.

1556
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Right, what would you like to tell us

1557
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
about these magical Kin Stones pieces?

1558
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Hello!

1559
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I just planted a big old bean.

1560
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It hasn't sprouted yet

1561
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
but when it does, I'm going to be...

1562
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
If it hasn't sprouted,

1563
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but when it does,

1564
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
it's going to be a big sucker.

1565
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Don't say it.

1566
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Don't say it, chat.

1567
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Don't say it, refunds.

1568
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Okay, I guess he's telling us

1569
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that the bean stalks

1570
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
will grow

1571
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
via Kin Stones.

1572
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That's the only thing I can...

1573
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Shut up!

1574
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Wow, there's so many enemies in that area.

1575
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Right, I'm not bothering.

1576
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Oh!

1577
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That's what I get for not paying attention.

1578
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm just getting absolutely

1579
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
blasted at what it was.

1580
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Is there anything else in town we can do?

1581
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
We might be able to speak to the martial artists.

1582
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Do you know that?

1583
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Hello!

1584
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh my god, it's the wee chickadee!

1585
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh my god, he's so cute!

1586
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
He's a thing.

1587
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Hello?

1588
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Speak.

1589
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I am Swiftblade,

1590
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
finest swordman in all of Hyrule.

1591
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
If you train with me,

1592
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I guarantee that you will increase your skills dramatically.

1593
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So, would you like to train here?

1594
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes, please.

1595
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
We shall start with the most basic of all techniques.

1596
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I shall teach you

1597
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
the spin attack.

1598
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
First, press and hold your sword button.

1599
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Second, build up enough power.

1600
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Third, release your destructive might.

1601
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That's all, young swordsman.

1602
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Do you understand?

1603
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yes.

1604
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Ha ha ha!

1605
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Very good.

1606
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You are a very quick student.

1607
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
But you must feel the technique,

1608
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
not just hear about it.

1609
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
That's why I will now possess your body,

1610
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
so as you demonstrate the technique,

1611
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I call this the

1612
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Swiftblade Position Technique of Training.

1613
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Watch this!

1614
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Position!

1615
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah!

1616
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Phew!

1617
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Now you must try it yourself.

1618
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Press and hold your sword button.

1619
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Build up enough power.

1620
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Then release your destructive might.

1621
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That's all there is to it.

1622
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah!

1623
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yes, fine work.

1624
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You're a quick study.

1625
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I will now give you this Tiger Scroll.

1626
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
If you ever forget this technique,

1627
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
you can review it with the scroll.

1628
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You may view it at any time from the quest screen.

1629
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You learned the secret spin attack,

1630
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
baiting technique.

1631
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
This is the first sword technique

1632
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
you've learned from Master Swiftblade.

1633
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Right, we're going to leave and come back in

1634
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
because he might teach me something new

1635
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
because I unlocked the Earthstone.

1636
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
There are no more techniques I can teach you

1637
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
with your current sword.

1638
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Okay, okay, when we upgrade your sword.

1639
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
This guy is treating us like the kings

1640
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
under a prana.

1641
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Aw, that's so cute!

1642
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Oh, I just remembered.

1643
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
If you clear this up,

1644
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
there should be a new guy that comes in.

1645
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Aw, I think it's a kinsome guy, actually.

1646
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Oh my god, there's a bakery?

1647
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Oh my god, reeflings!

1648
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
What do you want to eat?

1649
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Sniffs it?

1650
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Mmm, doesn't that smell spectacular?

1651
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Perhaps they give you free samples.

1652
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I say, would you ask for me?

1653
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Do reeflings want sandwich,

1654
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
a pie,

1655
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
a croissant,

1656
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
or a bread?

1657
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Sand.

1658
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Oh, you want sand?

1659
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Okay, sand.

1660
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Sand.

1661
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Good morning.

1662
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Uh, Ichi-sando?

1663
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Please?

1664
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Welcome!

1665
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
You've come to the one and only

1666
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
bakery of Wheaton & Pitter!

1667
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
As in, Wheat & Pitterbread?

1668
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Wheat on Pitter!

1669
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Whoa, you don't need to jump on her in the bakery.

1670
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
This tasty slice of cake,

1671
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
which may or may not have something special inside,

1672
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
it's a moist and cream filled

1673
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
bargain. It's only 60!

1674
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I don't have 60 rupees on my...

1675
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'm a child!

1676
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Jeez, how much is this then?

1677
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
How much is the pie?

1678
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Welcome, you've come? Yeah, no, no.

1679
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
A slice of her fantastic fruit pie,

1680
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
which may or may not have something inside.

1681
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
40!

1682
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I'm a child, lady!

1683
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Jeez, Louise!

1684
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Right, you guys are getting a croissant and taking it, right?

1685
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1686
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Right, how much is a croissant?

1687
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Okay, it's there.

1688
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
You guys can eat the croissant,

1689
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
sit down, shut up, and eat it,

1690
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
because I know you didn't want it,

1691
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
but you can still get it.

1692
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Oh, you got a kid's stone face!

1693
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Thank you, refling!

1694
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Thank you for not swallowing it.

1695
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I didn't really want it if it came out long ago.

1696
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Hmm, hmm.

1697
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Must make deliciousness.

1698
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Aww, it's so cute.

1699
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Did you enjoy it?

1700
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I want its anger.

1701
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I'm too poor, okay?

1702
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Look,

1703
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
you gave me an entire generation.

1704
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I have five kids to look after.

1705
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I have reflings to look after.

1706
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And I might currently be pregnant

1707
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
with Gen 2.

1708
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I don't know yet what's happening.

1709
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Uh, right.

1710
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Is there anything else?

1711
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The dog's in the way, so that's locked off.

1712
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
We can give you more generations,

1713
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
but my pie!

1714
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I'm not money enough.

1715
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't have enough money.

1716
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
What do you think?

1717
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Speak.

1718
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Well, if it isn't Link,

1719
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
it is good to see you again.

1720
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The school is in session.

1721
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I'm afraid I can't let you in.

1722
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh my god, that's right.

1723
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
He's like a literal child

1724
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
going about the map health.

1725
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
What are you?

1726
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Buggy buggy boo.

1727
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Did I scare you?

1728
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
No.

1729
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Oh, there's like this silly chicken game.

1730
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Oh no, this is horrible.

1731
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
My cocoons have gotten out.

1732
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Can you help me catch them?

1733
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Try to catch two of them, please.

1734
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yoink!

1735
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Get back in the pen!

1736
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Okay, we only need two, so that's fine.

1737
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Is that making a weird noise?

1738
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It sounds like scratching.

1739
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Weird.

1740
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh, there's a golden one.

1741
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I got a golden ch-

1742
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Ah!

1743
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Get back here!

1744
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
No, you're going back in your pen.

1745
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Naughty chicken.

1746
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Okay, time's up, that's it.

1747
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Thanks, here's your reward.

1748
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Ten seers-

1749
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
What did I do with the shells?

1750
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh, she gave me 30 rupees.

1751
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Maybe I can get your sandwich.

1752
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
A literal child being sent to just kill a wizard.

1753
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I love those memes that are like,

1754
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
summarise the game in one sentence,

1755
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
like completely out of context.

1756
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Child sent to kill wizard is pretty accurate.

1757
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Alright, what do I even need to do?

1758
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Sorry.

1759
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I am having a fun time just giving off

1760
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and enjoying this game for what it's worth.

1761
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh!

1762
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Sorry, I got a little excited looking at the water there.

1763
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Oh!

1764
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Bees!

1765
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I don't want to take them yet

1766
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
because I don't have anything to put them in.

1767
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
There was an enemy up ahead.

1768
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Next time we go back to town,

1769
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I will get your cake.

1770
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Even though-

1771
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Oh!

1772
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Well, we can't go that way.

1773
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Hold on.

1774
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
We need to go up.

1775
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Every additional chicken gets you more money

1776
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
even if it's for going on.

1777
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Ah, okay, okay.

1778
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
So I should get going.

1779
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Oh!

1780
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
He wants to do that thing.

1781
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
You want to fuse Kinstone?

1782
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Yeah, but-

1783
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Ah, I don't have what you need.

1784
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
What about you?

1785
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I don't have what both of them needs?

1786
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
What are the odds of that?

1787
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Now we're getting there.

1788
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You fuse.

1789
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You fuse.

1790
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Come.

1791
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Ah, come.

1792
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But they aren't open yet.

1793
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Hmm.

1794
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Okay.

1795
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Hello, can I get that?

1796
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Ho, ho.

1797
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So you've learned to spin attack.

1798
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's still dangerous, but maybe you can handle it.

1799
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Oh, I didn't even know I needed that to progress.

1800
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah, that's the one.

1801
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
But there are monsters out there, kid.

1802
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Please just be careful.

1803
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think he blocks you from going anywhere.

1804
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Okay.

1805
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It's two hits.

1806
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That's fine.

1807
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What are these?

1808
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Can I break them?

1809
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I can!

1810
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, I'm not fucking picking them all up manually.

1811
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Just down here.

1812
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Oh, Bomba!

1813
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
They have got some timer on them.

1814
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Hello!

1815
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Oh, this is a merchant.

1816
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Hold on.

1817
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You need a dinkum.

1818
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Okay, you got me.

1819
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Let me make it up to you.

1820
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You can have this.

1821
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Do you have lots of bottles for 20?

1822
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Sure.

1823
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Give me up.

1824
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You got an empty bowl.

1825
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Thanks a lot.

1826
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yes, we needed the bowl for...

1827
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Actually, we need...

1828
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
This was...

1829
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I didn't even remember it was down here.

1830
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We needed the bowl for...

1831
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
If not, we'll just have to make do with your cake instead.

1832
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
How the frickin...

1833
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
How did you guys do that?

1834
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That's really coordinated.

1835
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

1836
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That's really coordinated doing that.

1837
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Here.

1838
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
No, literally.

1839
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
The only time you guys are like mega-coordinated is...

1840
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
What's that?

1841
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Which is actually really funny.

1842
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Okay, there's nothing up here that we can do yet.

1843
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Reefling?

1844
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Hive?

1845
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Main?

1846
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I can't believe it.

1847
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Main broken?

1848
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm not even spanked at the first one yet,

1849
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
where I get you to rename yourself for an hour or so.

1850
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Okay, this is why we need water.

1851
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Because it grows the beanstalk!

1852
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And then we'll grab more,

1853
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
because I'm like,

1854
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
God, we're really low on bombs.

1855
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I actually don't know how to get more.

1856
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Sure, grab.

1857
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Put this one out for now.

1858
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
We used our single brain cell for the forces to do.

1859
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, I need it.

1860
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Sorry, there is a lot of menus, like, speak.

1861
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Okay, you got me.

1862
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I'll make it up to you.

1863
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
A friend of mine in the cave just east of here in the Highlands

1864
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
has an item if you're planning to ongoing.

1865
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It won't let you get to the top,

1866
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
but it might just help you get started.

1867
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Okay, that's fine.

1868
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I need more Keith down peep heads.

1869
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
What?

1870
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Hmm.

1871
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Right, we're gonna grab this money up here.

1872
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I guess like 20.

1873
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Oh, we're at 40.

1874
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I still don't have enough for your signage though.

1875
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Look up here, nothing.

1876
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Luckily, I already did that, literally.

1877
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I'm doing everything in the right order by accident.

1878
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Right, we can't grip the walls yet.

1879
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I might just...

1880
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, wait, there's something hidden under these.

1881
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Whoa, they hardly get affected.

1882
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
There's a lot of enemies in this area.

1883
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Geez, whoa, wait!

1884
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Is there not a hidden thing around here?

1885
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Is it this?

1886
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Wow, there's a lot of enemies.

1887
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Is this just a secret bomb place?

1888
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It looks like we should do something here.

1889
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I'll just stay here.

1890
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, that looks so...

1891
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Like, there's totally not a hidden thing here.

1892
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh, jelly blobs.

1893
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
There's a question about the mysterious shells.

1894
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I can't remember what they're for.

1895
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Geez, I have one bomb left.

1896
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Why am I going here?

1897
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I think I might need to put it in the bottle.

1898
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I hope you're having a good time.

1899
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I'm in the middle of the hammer, I need to play childing again.

1900
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Oh, I don't think jumping on a gem would feel that good on your butt, but...

1901
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I guess the smaller you...

1902
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
So this perfectly normal looking...

1903
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So this perfectly normal looking stone was another portal of the Minish world.

1904
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
There may be other rock portals.

1905
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Keep your eyes peeled, boy.

1906
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Increase your chances when going for a figurine.

1907
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Oh, okay.

1908
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Okay, I can't.

1909
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
If the enemies aren't attacking me, there's no point in...

1910
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Okay, yeah, I definitely need this liquid.

1911
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Why is it...

1912
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You've got Mount Serial's mineral water in your bottle.

1913
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It's piping hot?

1914
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Hmm.

1915
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Right, I'm going to detach it because I don't want to accidentally use it

1916
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
because I definitely have to use it for something coming up.

1917
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Green mineral water.

1918
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You've got acid, literally.

1919
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
See you, Yibi.

1920
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I know you can.

1921
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I only have one bomb left.

1922
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I don't want to use it on...

1923
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Oh, I'm sick.

1924
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
There's a lot of merches nearby.

1925
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Hello.

1926
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Okay, you got me.

1927
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I'll make up to you by selling your bombs.

1928
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Wait, I've only got one bomb left?

1929
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Right, right.

1930
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Give me the freaking bombs over.

1931
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah.

1932
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Thanks a lot.

1933
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1934
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Oh, I'm confused.

1935
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I have it!

1936
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
The two pieces fit perfectly together.

1937
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yibi!

1938
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
A chest?

1939
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Okay, that's fine.

1940
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We do not have access to that area.

1941
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Unfortunately.

1942
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
That's okay.

1943
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I might have to start scraping by and trying to pick up coins

1944
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
because it's not looking good.

1945
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Okay, I see they purposely put that bomb there

1946
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
because...

1947
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Hey, that guy.

1948
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yeah, literally, they put a nice bomb cellar nearby

1949
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
in case you're out,

1950
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
and I'm like, yes, think of it.

1951
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's so smart.

1952
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Oh, I don't know how far this goes.

1953
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Either a lot of acid or that's plankton.

1954
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, I think...

1955
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Once you've pulled off their iron mask,

1956
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
those guys are no trouble whatsoever.

1957
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I think we'll just avoid them, to be honest.

1958
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We don't really need to fight everything.

1959
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Of course, I'm silly of me.

1960
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Hey, my boy.

1961
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Jump into that whirlwind over there for me.

1962
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I wonder, is this a great idea or a terrible one?

1963
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'll beat the crap out of this one.

1964
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Okay, now this becomes the fun part.

1965
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
We're really...

1966
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Oh, I can't go up.

1967
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Oh, there we go.

1968
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I can't go up.

1969
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
What's...

1970
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Ow!

1971
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
What's over here?

1972
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Where's some more?

1973
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Eh?

1974
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
There's a path.

1975
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Oh, well.

1976
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Tell me a bomb doesn't belong there.

1977
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You can't...

1978
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
What's in here?

1979
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Okay, I'm gonna bomb for that.

1980
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Wow!

1981
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It'll take us down to five bombs.

1982
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Getting this, but we're gonna do it.

1983
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
We're gonna send it.

1984
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Oh, a special Kingston piece.

1985
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It was blue, so I guess...

1986
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I'm 50!

1987
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I can buy your sandwich even though it's a cake!

1988
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But it looks like a sandwich,

1989
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
but it makes sense that it was a cake because it's a bakery.

1990
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Leave me be, fellow beast.

1991
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Okay, this one looks like a succumon.

1992
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh, that's where the deco's!

1993
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That's where the slain...

1994
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I knew something had to be sucked up over here.

1995
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Wow!

1996
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
150 rupees for a sanda.

1997
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Oh, hi!

1998
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
See that?

1999
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
See how we just sucked it up,

2000
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
but it's already spun back in?

2001
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I wish they didn't do that.

2002
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Oh, wait!

2003
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I can't do that yet.

2004
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I need to move it.

2005
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Oh!

2006
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Wait, do I need to go there then?

2007
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Into the hole!

2008
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Okay.

2009
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
We're gonna do it!

2010
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Oh!

2011
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Sorry, I got a bit excited there.

2012
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
My biggest downfall in video games is just gaps.

2013
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I can't do it.

2014
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Who is putting this kind of shit?

2015
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Wait!

2016
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Oh, no.

2017
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Oh, no, this can't be.

2018
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I think I have missed a very detrimental item question mark.

2019
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, I'm done again.

2020
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Sorry, sorry.

2021
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There was a gap.

2022
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
There was a gap.

2023
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I am 99.9% sure I need some sort of weight lifting thing here

2024
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
to move the plant over.

2025
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Oh, sorry, I'm getting caught.

2026
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
And I don't have a...

2027
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Where is it?

2028
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Lift!

2029
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Wait!

2030
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Link!

2031
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You can just straight up lift that?

2032
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I thought there was some sort of item.

2033
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Is that later in the game?

2034
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Fuck it now, he's at time!

2035
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Sorry.

2036
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Oh, well, I did what I needed to do,

2037
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
even if I sacrificed some of my health for it.

2038
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I did what needed to be done.

2039
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I don't even know how he's this strong.

2040
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I can't believe it.

2041
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Sorry, I'm wasting all my health.

2042
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Right, the reason why we need the green is this.

2043
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And now we are on Mount Creronell,

2044
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
not to be confused with Mount Serials.

2045
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I used to see as a child.

2046
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I'm so funny as a child.

2047
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Okay, this is definitely a bomb.

2048
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Sorry, my stomach's making funky noises.

2049
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Let's hear it.

2050
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Weakest wiefling.

2051
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, no way that dodged that.

2052
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
That was like really good timing.

2053
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I wasn't here.

2054
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Another piece.

2055
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Curious.

2056
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Curious?

2057
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Hmm, curious.

2058
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Another piece.

2059
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Is the game telling me I should probably trade?

2060
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Whoa!

2061
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
New enemy unlocked.

2062
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Okay, yes, I would like that heart very much, please.

2063
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I should have done that in the middle.

2064
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I just realized I wasted that.

2065
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Bomb bomb!

2066
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh, of course they have it in here.

2067
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Oh, wait, no!

2068
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I should have picked up.

2069
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Silly Billy.

2070
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Great.

2071
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I wonder if they always won.

2072
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm curious.

2073
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Well, I still have nightmares of the snake enemies that suck your money.

2074
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Give me your...

2075
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Aren't those just called women?

2076
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I'm sorry.

2077
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I tried so hard to make that joke really quickly.

2078
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
It didn't work.

2079
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I don't need the wool.

2080
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I tried so hard to do that quickly and it completely started over my words

2081
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
because my brain was like,

2082
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Yes, yes, the joke's there!

2083
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Say it, say it!

2084
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And, yeah.

2085
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Well, I tried, I tried, okay, I tried.

2086
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
L'Bomba!

2087
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Wah.

2088
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Is he gonna give me the ring?

2089
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Are you kidding me right now?

2090
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Okay, fine, no, my money's getting sucked.

2091
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Okay, you got me.

2092
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'll give you a fabulous grip ring.

2093
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It is perfect for a young mountaineer.

2094
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Climb 48.

2095
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Okay, lucky we got money on the way.

2096
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Thanks a lot.

2097
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Okay, now we can climb the wall.

2098
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Oh, we got five bombs again.

2099
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Oh, this is perfect.

2100
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Thank you.

2101
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
K.F.P. Spidey.

2102
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Right, what way?

2103
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Short cut to bomb.

2104
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
No, so what's up here?

2105
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh.

2106
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Oh.

2107
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
We can't do that.

2108
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So, this is not the right way to go.

2109
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Shawnee doesn't need the grip ring.

2110
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
She has that cover!

2111
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It's the...

2112
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Lip set.

2113
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It's the R slash lip set grip.

2114
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm so sorry.

2115
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Wait, what?

2116
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So, where am I supposed to go?

2117
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Okay.

2118
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Huh?

2119
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Am I supposed to go to the left?

2120
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I don't want to go...

2121
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Okay, there.

2122
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
This is it.

2123
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You know that subreddit?

2124
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, I'm featured on it right now.

2125
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I'm trolling before anyone fucking goes and knocks me in.

2126
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Like, oh my god!

2127
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
No, no, really.

2128
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Right, definitely.

2129
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Ahoy!

2130
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It's Emmy!

2131
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Any embers?

2132
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Any pen pals?

2133
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Me.

2134
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Please talk to me.

2135
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Talk to me.

2136
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Why don't you talk to me then?

2137
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Wait.

2138
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
No!

2139
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
You put water in your bottle,

2140
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
and then you give her water.

2141
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You take her water,

2142
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
then you give her water.

2143
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Oh!

2144
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Welcome to the Adventure Spring.

2145
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Did you throw the golden bomb

2146
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
into the spring or the silver bomb?

2147
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Neither?

2148
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
You are honest.

2149
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I must reward such an honest adventure

2150
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
with some of my power.

2151
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
You got a big bomb bag!

2152
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Now you can carry more bombah!

2153
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Thank you, mysterious lady.

2154
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
May light shine on your quest.

2155
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Oh, she's so ethereal.

2156
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I love her.

2157
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
This song sounds so familiar.

2158
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Yes, it is.

2159
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
It's like, pretty much the default, like...

2160
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Hey, Zelda.

2161
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Take her water, and give her water.

2162
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
She was just happy to get a bubble.

2163
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
They have a spring cone.

2164
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
She just wanted to do a spring cone.

2165
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Ah!

2166
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Ah!

2167
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I can't believe I suck.

2168
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Why is this...

2169
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I got a cavern.

2170
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I have a cavern.

2171
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
There's a cavern.

2172
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I have a cavern.

2173
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I have a cavern.

2174
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I have a cavern.

2175
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I have a cavern.

2176
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:40,640
I'm the Cranel, I'm the Cranel Hermit! I left the world to pursue a life of quiet reflection.

2177
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:46,400
You seem to be but a child and yet you climb this forbidden mountain alone. I must reward

2178
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:52,240
your courage with information. I have not seen a s- have you not seen strange patterned walls

2179
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:58,160
as you climb this mountain? No? Bombs, bombs are the- oh he's telling me to nuke the fricking walls.

2180
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,920
Yeah that's fine. The two kinstom pieces fit perfectly together, maybe something good will happen.

2181
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,360
I didn't know you could take the water from the fairy town.

2182
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,320
You learn something new every time you replay a childhood game.

2183
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,200
What? How is that good?

2184
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,280
How is that good? You've just- you've just created problems for me.

2185
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,160
Okay, those are aggressive.

2186
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,640
Ah! I don't know if I'll be able to- no I'm not gonna be able to in time, hold on.

2187
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,680
Okay, suck them off. Get in my P.O.B.

2188
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:48,000
Let's go. We are very high up if the- the fricking mountain top isn't even there.

2189
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,880
Oh my goodness. All right, we can't do anything, we have to go- man we gotta go small.

2190
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,440
Gotta take all off. Money? Oh is that what the golden snakes are?

2191
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,280
They got Mario and Marshmallow doing here.

2192
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,000
Oh, mushrooms-y owned by Nintendo.

2193
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,080
These raindrops are like folders of water tails kid.

2194
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,600
Watch out! If one of them hits us, it'll sting something fierce.

2195
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,120
I'm getting rolled! Another good kind, I literally need new hearts.

2196
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,320
I've only got three hearts. I'm drying them- wait can I push these? No I can't, I'm too small.

2197
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,920
I'm just a baby. I'm gonna do a marshmallow.

2198
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,760
Right, what do I need to do with this?

2199
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:54,240
All right, I definitely need to push it that way. Then up. Then up again. Then a cheeky.

2200
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:04,400
Left. Then up again. Then up again. Then a cheeky left. Then a left. Then a left.

2201
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:09,120
Then a left. Then a no- then a down. And then a straight ahead.

2202
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:19,120
Keep her going, keep her moving. Come on Link, you're so strong! You can do it! Link, you came to turn!

2203
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,120
You came to save the Princess Zelda!

2204
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:37,120
He's so strong. Oh, there's enemies at the bomb. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

2205
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,280
We'll go this way, I think.

2206
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:48,320
Uh, right, can I do this? No, let's do that one.

2207
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:57,440
Oh my god, I'm literally guessing the freaking designer there lay out before- I've even activated it.

2208
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:05,760
SHIT! I messed up. Oh, then he got all the way back because I messed up the last one I did.

2209
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:17,760
Unless? No. What? Wait, unless. Hold on, unless we're being misled. Unless we're being misled!

2210
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:26,400
It's your maiden smash force. I've never played it before. Should I play it before? Should I play it?

2211
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,480
Thank you for the five delay lovers. Don't think I don't know your bleeding heart.

2212
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:40,800
It's not a club, true name. I just think it's blood. Yes. I've never played it. I think Bayonetta.

2213
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,320
Hold on a minute. Yeah, I saw that. I saw the pots and I was like, hold on a minute.

2214
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:54,880
Is there pots on the other side? I think Bayonetta's in it, so I would probably play her when I play smash.

2215
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:02,480
Wait, why are you lip-biting to that? Is that a game? Is that a sexy game? I thought it was Nintendo.

2216
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:09,920
I was saying that Nintendo produced Bayonetta, which is like the most bomb shell. Is there something special in here?

2217
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:16,080
Why are you hiding these pots from me? Oh, there's like a bomb behind them. Okay, that's fine.

2218
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,440
I guess we need a bomb up ahead.

2219
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,120
You can manually throw bombs if you need to. Okay, I don't really want to fight because I'm

2220
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:43,520
pretty low health and not new health is spawning. Oh no, not another one of these, right? Okay.

2221
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,640
Down, two left, and then down.

2222
01:36:54,400 --> 01:37:01,840
Okay, okay, okay, we're getting there. We're doing it. Then one, then up one, then left,

2223
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,600
then north, then west, then push! We did it!

2224
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,400
A scrawny can use her brain? Something.

2225
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,280
Sugar, I might start up. Hold on, let me try that again. Wait, no.

2226
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,520
Yeah, I can do it though. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.

2227
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:39,440
Anagong, a special console piece. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. Easy as connect for my life,

2228
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:45,120
honestly. Oh, we did it! Look, look, look, this is a Minish camp. We're going to the Dwarven Minish.

2229
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,080
The Dwarves of Erebor. I may be a bleeding heart now, but after that carry on,

2230
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:59,520
oh, you can be. I'm not like one of those streamers that kind of get uncomfortable. As long as you're

2231
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,680
happy, I'm happy. You enjoy the content and enjoy the content, you know?

2232
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:12,080
But yeah, you guys, guys, did you know you have an infestation out there? Yeah?

2233
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:20,960
Thank you for the five again, Delay Lover. Hello! Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long,

2234
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,960
fer-eye. Wait, they're actually Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, fer-eye,

2235
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:33,360
and they're Scottish? Ting-a-long, tong-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long, dig-a-long,

2236
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:40,480
dig-a-long, fer-eye, and they're Scottish? In here? Oh my god, they have communal,

2237
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:47,520
they have communal bedding. Reflings, this is what I want. Oh my god, they're Scottish!

2238
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:54,080
Hi! Hello, everyone! Oh my god, it's the kitchen where I make all the fit for the

2239
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,760
reflings. What's that? We're having chicken again tonight? That's right, I'll let you use chicken.

2240
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:08,320
Are you Scottish? Wait, I think, wait, is it in here? No, this is just a smith's room.

2241
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,960
Okay, I think it might be down in here. Okay, definitely not there, that's how to progress.

2242
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,760
Hello! Hello, everyone!

2243
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:27,680
Green Clays, and an old hat! Sir, may you be young Link? I am Mellari, Master Smith. I hear you want

2244
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:33,840
me to reforge the sacred sword and help break a curse. I'll be needing that old sword, which holds

2245
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:41,040
the power of the elements first. Show me that broken PCORI blades. I love all this adventure,

2246
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:51,040
with what's with the rescuing of princesses and such. I'd be happy to reforge this thing into a

2247
01:39:51,040 --> 01:40:00,880
brand new sacred blade for you. It'll take me a while to rework that sword. In the meantime,

2248
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:05,920
you should try doing the missing elements. One of them should be in the mind of the human

2249
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:12,320
dog. It's not far from here. All right, let's get started. Bunk!

2250
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:18,080
Eh, there'll probably be a wee while, Link. Let's leave him to it and find the element.

2251
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,880
Oh my god, Scotland kind of mentioned, even though it's just in the dialogue,

2252
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,440
but I'll take it Scotland mentioned. What? You're going to the mine? If you talk to the

2253
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:34,320
boss, I'm no storm here, but just be careful, laddie. Who goes there? Samwise! What nice name!

2254
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:40,480
Well, welcome to the members, gang. I'm so sorry about, please forgive me.

2255
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,000
Okay, hopefully we can get a heart in the mine. Holder of the sacred powers.

2256
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:52,800
We grant you the power of the elements. Wow! Hey, that stone marker crumbled,

2257
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,880
and there's another one of those symbols! You know what? No matter how many times I see this

2258
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:02,480
happen, it still rattles me a bit. Who's the 10 out of 12? That's a bit of a hi.

2259
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:10,320
Whoa! It's hot in here. Come on, let's not stand around wasting time. Find that element so we can

2260
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,760
get the heck out here. I'm going to smash these for heart. Yeah, normally the game is very forgiving

2261
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:21,760
and gives you what you need before you go next. Bums! What happens?

2262
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,960
Okay, hit them! Oh!

2263
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,320
Oh, so they do blow themselves up.

2264
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,240
Whoa, the bomb bag is there, eh? Where are you?

2265
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,720
Your sword won't make a dent in their thorny. Flip them over before you strike.

2266
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:51,440
With a shield? With a shield? I'm remembering! I'm remembering!

2267
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,520
Oh, I need the money so I can get cake.

2268
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,840
Okay, after this one, I'll call a break and I'm going to make another honey tea to help my

2269
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:09,760
throat, okay? But we're about to get the second element, okay? That's right, we're just so MLG

2270
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:16,320
poor. I knew it! He's humping me! He's humping me!

2271
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,240
Jeez, Louise! That was sheebie and a half right there.

2272
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,000
How is sheebie and a half? That's like sheebie doing it.

2273
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:34,080
Dude, do I upset the bombs if I do? Oh, I don't even upset the bombs.

2274
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,760
Okay, I upset the bombs when I do that. Okay, okay. Wow, more bomb back.

2275
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,760
These snakes, I hate them, literally.

2276
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh! You know the Binding of Isaac, right? So Eddie McMuffin, the guy that made the game,

2277
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:07,360
Big Eddie McMuffin, he said that he was inspired by Legend of Zelda and he also mentioned...

2278
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:12,720
Oh! This might be where the humans who built the mines used to be around here,

2279
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,560
maybe we should hop in. Wait, what, after all this? There's nothing to be afraid of here,

2280
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,440
come on, let's go!

2281
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:32,800
Um, sweet jumpin' jellyfish! That was awful! Hey, kid, what are you smiling about? I knew it was

2282
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,320
madness to risk our lives in that rickety human contraption. From now on, let's just stick to

2283
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:48,480
our feet. Well, I mean, your feet. Um, yeah, he said that he was inspired. Isaac was inspired by

2284
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:56,400
Legend of Zelda and if you ever do the alt path and the mines and all that, this exactly reminds me

2285
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:05,280
of it. Uh, it's very... Ah, you can't go behind me, that's cheating! Let me equip my bomb buck.

2286
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:10,480
Just wanted to do it to get in here. I'll put my shield back on though, right, right over here.

2287
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,200
The snakes are called like, like, more like...

2288
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:26,960
Ooh! Wait, that bombies guys? I know I'm supposed to spank their butts, but they're kind of, they're

2289
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:36,240
kind of winning. Okay, hold on. Okay, two hits and they're gone. What? You're not supposed to actually

2290
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:43,040
charge me. I heard that roofie drop. Don't think I didn't hear that roofie drop.

2291
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:49,600
I'm interested. So there was a portal heading away in here. Hmm. Whenever you want me to shrink

2292
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,680
you down, just hop on there and press the button. You know the drill. Right, give me that. Oh, I

2293
01:44:53,680 --> 01:45:01,120
thought it was a roofie. It was a hot, it was a hot. You can suck their masks away. Oh, okay, okay.

2294
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:07,200
Will we get an Isaac stream anytime soon? Like an Eden run? Probably Eden run, maybe on a shorter

2295
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:16,320
day. My dad is coming to visit. I am so tiny right now. I can't go in that, can I? I think that

2296
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:24,080
kills me. Okay, I'm not going there. My dad's coming home, my dad's coming home. So July,

2297
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:34,400
first two weeks are going to be relatively, I say relatively short streams, depending on

2298
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:42,160
how cool my dad is because I'm pretty loud when I stream, let's be honest. Jump down there?

2299
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:53,120
That seems dangerous. I do see the thing though. Okay, no, it is done there. So yes, July is kind

2300
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:59,840
of maybe like two to four hour streams for the first two weeks and then we just get straight

2301
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:06,640
back into, again, straight back into Endurance. Don't mind me. We'll be careful at these fires.

2302
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:12,640
They do restore health, so I'm not going to, I'm going to beat around the bush. Got a dungeon map,

2303
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:18,640
so if I ever get a old discombobulated and where I need to go, right, these time out, oh,

2304
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,400
I'm terribly, these time out, but they do come back. Hold on, let me aim this a bit better.

2305
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,600
Probably keeping them with the blue ones. I think the blue ones must be a vent or something. Oh my,

2306
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:34,560
it looks really, really hot in that lava. Trust me, me who'd literally just perish two seconds

2307
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,160
in four. Trust me, falling into that would be a bad idea. I'm sure you'd agree.

2308
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,760
Yeah, you'll find you'll be able to watch other lives consistent. Well, because I stream like a

2309
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:50,400
normal streamer, like, okay, thank you. Thank you for the two hours. I'm all flying now.

2310
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:58,160
I am. It does mean, I will say one thing, it does mean a lot of like Ace Marble plays in that.

2311
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:11,280
It'll be easier to make. Wait, this crumbles? Well, I need to pick it up. Pick up the booze.

2312
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,840
Oh, sorry. Oh, well, that worked out really well actually. I need to get rid of the fire.

2313
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:24,880
Oh, I just spanked. I missed it perfectly. Oh my God, reflings, I can get your Sango.

2314
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:33,040
Go away. Go away. Oh, no, I need money for a sign, bitch. Okay, then.

2315
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Um.

2316
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:47,440
What did I do? I go all the way around? Oh, I must do. Okay, we use the worldwinds

2317
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:52,240
for all the way around on a big U-turn. Did you see the new Zelda trailer? Not yet, no.

2318
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:58,080
I would play it, but I'm pretty sure trailers get copyright. Like, I used to...

2319
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:08,320
Wait, did I? Oh, right, I push it all the way over. I used to think trailers and like anything

2320
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:14,240
gameplay related was like non-copyrightable because they like purposely make it not that way,

2321
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:22,000
but I've got two false copyright notifications on my Skyrim stream and on my Assassin's Creed

2322
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:31,200
Brotherhood stream. Oh. Um, but because it's a Skamas, I can't actually counteract it without

2323
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:38,320
putting like the channel at risk. So like I'm not counterclaimed or anything. Um, it just is just

2324
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:47,280
a bit sucky. Um, we are eating. Okay, we've changed the tracks' pathing now, so we're gonna get back

2325
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:55,680
in the mine cart and I'm gonna explore the mineshaft. Oh, I saw that horrible. Oh, sorry,

2326
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:02,000
I need shields for these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, take that muck. Triple... Well, double kill.

2327
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,680
Not triple, because there's not three enemies.

2328
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,400
Okay, definitely don't want to get pooped by the bats because the bats will shove you off that

2329
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:24,960
map. No hesitation. Aren't these kind of strikes automatic because someone sampled it? Yes, I just

2330
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,920
like, I looked it up like who claimed it because it looked like it looked like nothing from Bethesda

2331
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:35,120
or anything of that nature. I was like, this looks so unofficial and then I found this reddit and it

2332
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:39,520
was like filled with people saying that, oh god, we're hot. I didn't actually know it was down here.

2333
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:45,520
Can I just one more? Okay, good, good, good. Um, yeah, it was just filled with this reddit and

2334
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:51,280
everyone was taping the same thing. Like I was just casually playing this like game. Oh no, battle arena.

2335
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:59,680
Oh no, it's the spakey cane. Oh, I'm scared. Oh no, please leave me alone. Can I get the

2336
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:04,800
bill? Oh my god, I'm getting demolished. I'm just gonna spam. How about that? I'll just spam.

2337
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:11,600
I'll just spam. Okay, I win. I win, no. I win, I win.

2338
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:22,000
Okay, we did it. We did it, we did it. I didn't know I expected a freaking battle down there.

2339
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:30,160
You've got the cane of a, I am not gonna say that. This mystical rod has the power to flip

2340
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:36,320
things over. Use it to charge up energy and walls and fill it out. I don't, actually wait, I think I,

2341
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:46,320
I think it's Passy, like pacifist and not the other word. If you are British, you know exactly.

2342
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:52,320
Hey kid, why don't you take the cane of Passy and fire it at the hole? I mean,

2343
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,080
you never know what'll happen until you try it, right?

2344
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,880
These people living, why are you giving me a blue portal here?

2345
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:06,480
Ah, we can flip this over. Let's go!

2346
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,200
Oh, poor Link. He's so stressed.

2347
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:17,840
Strony has found the rod. Everyone run. It's too late. It's too late.

2348
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,680
I want to make sure I hit it from the right angle though.

2349
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,080
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, let's just go straight back then. Super easy,

2350
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:33,200
peasy, lemon, squeezy. Oh, I tell you what we could do. We're gonna go back to the start to

2351
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:39,120
pick up hearts and then come right back again. There should be, hearts always regenerate like

2352
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:45,120
these. Yeah, let's play it nice and safe. I actually can't remember the boss fight in this one, you know that.

2353
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,960
I always remember the slime one because I used to get stuck as a child all the time.

2354
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:04,480
Am I supposed to flip this? No, there's no main shaft, crap. Okay, I'm to do this.

2355
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:18,080
Okay, okay, it's fine. It's fine, relax. Well, on earth with those spiders though, I have no idea.

2356
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:25,440
Or am I too small to activate them? I think I'm too small to activate the spiders, which is good.

2357
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:31,360
We don't want to do that because I think they take some health. Time to get flipped with some

2358
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:36,480
What? Oh my god.

2359
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,680
Aye, those aren't spiders anyway. I can tell you that much. Let's get out of here.

2360
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,760
Okay, and then flip the track and then let's go.

2361
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:58,880
I love his little... Oh, sorry, I walked into it.

2362
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:11,680
And then we just need to do this one like that. No.

2363
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:19,680
Oh, I need... Can you come here? Oh, I've done it now, haven't I?

2364
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:25,600
Okay, there we go, there we go. I was like, oh, we're gonna be stuck. Let's try a wee bit.

2365
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,440
Beyblades, yeah, those Beyblades.

2366
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,880
A horrendous evil nasty thing. Okay, let's get this switch in order and then we can

2367
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:42,800
progress. I think we're almost at the boss. I feel like we've done enough.

2368
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:01,920
Am I going crazy, but I can't do that because if I push that one, it blocks it.

2369
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:09,760
I'm going mental, right? Oh, because I'm not to push it at all. I understand. I understand from

2370
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,560
the other side. Sorry. I was like, my brain was like trying its best to figure out what on earth

2371
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:21,200
the game was asking for me there. I was like, pretty sure this was impossible. Yay, we're getting so

2372
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,400
many kinstones. Right, we can go this way.

2373
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,080
My booty. Okay, we'll need to try that again. Sorry, a bit of a panic there. Let's let the game

2374
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,360
do its thing, do its wee cheeky beeset.

2375
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:46,640
Okay, it's just the...

2376
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,640
You are wobbling a bit too quick for Malik and...

2377
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,800
Oh, I didn't have time to react. I need to move the pots out the way.

2378
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:09,280
Okay, let's go. There was a switch back there, which I didn't do. Hold on, I need to go back.

2379
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,040
Oh no, I can't get this switch from that side.

2380
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:19,120
If you could play one on one with a recently, what game would you absolutely beat as that Black Ops

2381
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:26,080
one? Absolutely no contest. Absolutely not one of you has a Black Ops one skill like me.

2382
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:35,520
Absolutely no contest. No hesitation. Oh shit, is this going to break by the time we get there?

2383
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,560
No, I don't. Thank you.

2384
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:49,840
Lies, you get smoke. Oh no, you do not understand. You do not understand. When I was peak like

2385
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:58,160
try hard sweat on like S&D, Team Deathmatch domination, you do not understand. You have no

2386
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:02,960
comprehension. And thank you for the tip again. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Sorry, I just...

2387
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:10,080
Hold on. Oh, there wasn't even anything related to things in here. Thank you for the tip again.

2388
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:17,040
But no, you genuinely have no comprehension how terrible you are at the game if you go against

2389
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:26,800
me on it. So right now, smile. As for any other game that I'm good at, Black Ops 2, I was pretty

2390
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:38,400
decent at. I'm pretty confident the MSC, that was pretty... I bloody enjoyed that.

2391
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:50,640
Can I get up? Can I get up? Yes, I can get up. On PCS, I still think I destroy on an FES.

2392
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:59,040
Halo terrible, halo. Oh goodness me, where am I supposed to go? Right, follow the wind. Follow

2393
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:09,120
the wind and follow the rocks. The rocks are putting me here. Oh wait, there's like... Ah,

2394
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:15,840
go back, go back, go back. There's a chest here. Cancel. Wait, oh, I can't get up there. Right,

2395
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:22,640
sorry, my apologies. I was diamond in Overwatch. Oh, I was terrible. Wait, I definitely cannot go

2396
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:30,480
past those rocks. So let's do this. I'm not very strong at Overwatch. It was... I just never

2397
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:40,160
got good at it. I just played it for fun. I like being a heal bot on Mercy. But unfortunately,

2398
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:45,440
Overwatch 2 happened and I completely fell out of love with the game, which is such a shame.

2399
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:50,640
But I wouldn't mind doing like a... We all play it as refling. I wouldn't mind that just casually.

2400
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:55,920
And I'll be screaming at you like, God, do this. Marvel, everyone was kind of dogging on it and

2401
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:02,320
yes, yes, haha, funny. But Marvel rivals, I believe the game's called, actually looked pretty decent.

2402
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:12,320
So as I did, I said it, it looked decent. I got a big key. Oh, I did it! We're here! Right, we're

2403
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:18,160
going to go back and fill up our health. I just realized we did it. I was too busy rambling away

2404
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,280
that we're actually at the boss. Right, we need to try hard.

2405
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:27,680
The first Overwatch 2 trailer happened. Literally, we all should have seen it come in when Papa Jeff

2406
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:34,720
left because Overwatch was his baby. Okay, whoa, I'm like a pixel off of getting Mars burnt.

2407
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:46,240
Whoa, ready? Ready for a boss fight? I guess these are just hearts, yeah. Oh wow, okay.

2408
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:50,000
I can't remember what happens in here.

2409
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:54,960
Oh no.

2410
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:58,480
Whoa!

2411
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,680
Honestly, it looks like a really cool level of Pokemon.

2412
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:08,880
Oh, you can throw fire at me? That's not very nice.

2413
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,680
Take this! Okay, I missed. I think I'm supposed to flip his arse. No, no, clearly not.

2414
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,000
I did! You are supposed to flip his arse. Okay, okay, okay.

2415
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:29,760
Tapping his horn! Okay, that's the best I can do. Ow, I just freaking hurt myself.

2416
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:35,520
Uh, I don't have a lava spell to save me. Hello?

2417
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,800
Bruh, you better calm down with that lava spread. I don't know what you want from me.

2418
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,920
Okay, boom! Get ready. No, okay, he's not vulnerable.

2419
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,000
Have he's vulnerable? Vulnerable? No, not yet.

2420
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,240
Vulnerable? Yes!

2421
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:56,560
With all your might!

2422
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,480
Yes! Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.

2423
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:08,480
This is all fire. Wait, oh, ow, my freaking head.

2424
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:12,400
Okay, I'll take that. Yeah, this is all fire, which is not good for us,

2425
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,480
because we need to be able to have mobility around the map, or we're in trouble.

2426
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,600
Okay, okay, vulnerable. Okay, through your fire, that's fine.

2427
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:30,720
We are too early, we are too early, we are too not in the right direction.

2428
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:37,280
Nope, he's already adjusted. Stop adjusting! Bruh, that's a bit...

2429
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,320
Bruh, I literally have no nubut, no nubut. Take that.

2430
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:43,440
Okay, okay, one...

2431
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:51,280
Okay, wow. I like it to teleport me on the fire, like rain between it.

2432
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:53,520
Appreciate that, please don't do it again.

2433
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:56,800
Oh, we did it!

2434
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,480
Hello? Oh, I thought my game paused there, I was like,

2435
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,920
I think we have an encounter technical difficulties.

2436
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,040
We did it! What's the element? The fire?

2437
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:17,520
Heat element? It must be heat. It must be, surely it's heat element.

2438
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:22,880
You got the fire element. Flames bring light to darkness and warmth to all.

2439
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:28,880
The fire element is the embodiment of that power. Fire girl confirmed for Jintu?

2440
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:36,800
You got a heart container, absolutely gorgeous. I love me a heart container.

2441
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,720
So you must get a heart container every boss you dealt with.

2442
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:46,400
Oh, that was so hot, and I, it was... Oh, that was hot. It was so hot,

2443
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:49,520
I thought my fibers would catch fire. Ah, but it's over now.

2444
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:51,920
I suppose we should get back and speak to Malari.

2445
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:56,240
Like Malari, or should I say we Malari?

2446
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,880
Hello? Hello? Americano?

2447
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:12,720
Wow, that was fast work, but not so fast that I didn't finish your sword.

2448
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:16,320
Here, take a look. I call this new blade the white sword.

2449
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,960
Well, it's green clearly by the handle, but whatever.

2450
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:24,320
You got the white sword. It's, you got the white sword.

2451
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,800
It's beautiful white blade sparkles with light.

2452
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,120
You can put away your grandfather's sword now.

2453
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:32,560
Oh, once you infuse it with the power of the elements,

2454
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:38,080
it will become a sacred blade. The forest elder no doubt told you this part,

2455
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:43,040
but if you want to infuse the sword, you must go to the elemental sanctuary.

2456
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:47,680
The sanctuary is a strange realm, sorry I keep forgetting the voices,

2457
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,200
trapped between two worlds. It is the bridge between the Minish world and the human world.

2458
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:59,440
The doorway to the sanctuary opens only once every hundred years.

2459
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,840
You'll find that door hidden within the castle.

2460
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:06,080
Once that blade has been filled with the power of the four elements,

2461
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:10,400
you should be able to break the curse of the princess,

2462
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:14,640
and I know that you can do it. After all, you made short work of that human mind.

2463
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:19,280
Let me tell you about a shortcut that you can get down through the mountain.

2464
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:24,640
You'll find it right in front of the entrance of the mine you just explored.

2465
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,960
You'll follow, just follow that and you'll be down in no time in the park.

2466
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,760
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much.

2467
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,480
Thanks for making the sword, I appreciate it.

2468
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:44,080
I appreciate it, love good sword moment.

2469
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,560
Short cut through the mountain, that's in through the mountain.

2470
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:52,800
Secret, secret, secret, secret, short cut.

2471
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,080
Short cut to the bottom, a little to the right, okay.

2472
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,440
To reflink, well no.

2473
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,400
Short cut to the bottom, no, it's not to reflink.

2474
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:14,800
To, ah, to lovers, forbidden from one another.

2475
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:23,120
I mentioned divides their people, and the day didn't end.

2476
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:24,560
Oh wait, I've said that wrong.

2477
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,200
Wait, post the lyrics, post the lyrics so I can say it right.

2478
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,920
I've messed it up, I've messed it up.

2479
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:34,000
To reflink, well am I technically a reflink?

2480
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:35,840
Yeah, I think so.

2481
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,000
I love the environmental kills, they're quite sad.

2482
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,680
Right, we need to go to the castello.

2483
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,840
Hydration check, no, because then I have to make a cup of tea and I'll be awake.

2484
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:51,280
Straining herself is the shortcut to the bottom.

2485
02:04:51,280 --> 02:05:00,080
Um, we got loads of stones, do you guys want to trade?

2486
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,320
Wait, none of them?

2487
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,280
No one wants to do kingstone pieces?

2488
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,560
You want a fuse, yes please.

2489
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,280
Wow, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

2490
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,720
The two fit perfectly.

2491
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:19,040
Two lovers, forbidden from one another.

2492
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:30,480
A war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart.

2493
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:38,480
Built a path to be together, and yeah, I can never forget the next couple of lines,

2494
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:52,480
and then it goes secret tunnel, secret tunnel through the mountain, secret, secret, secret tunnel.

2495
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:58,640
And then everyone clapped as a mule.

2496
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,840
I'd like to go down the stream.

2497
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,960
Wah, chest?

2498
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,480
Chest, yes chest.

2499
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,680
So green is like money rewards, I guess?

2500
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,480
Oh my god, who are you?

2501
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:18,960
How can they make pixels so sexy?

2502
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:23,600
We hear all sorts of interesting gossip in here.

2503
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,840
Stop by from time to time.

2504
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,280
Hello lady, I want a fuse canstone.

2505
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:32,720
Whoa, how am I miraculously having the pieces that they want?

2506
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:41,120
That looks like the cow farm, because of that little pitch on the side.

2507
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:43,120
And everyone too.

2508
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:49,040
She's got a mule too sharp, did they pixelate a mule on her?

2509
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:53,840
No way, they freaking pixelated the milk mule, that's hilarious.

2510
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,200
Right, what happens if I go tiny?

2511
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,640
Please shrink me down, please shrink me down.

2512
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:04,000
I have been educated, I've now learned where secret tunnel comes from.

2513
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,560
Yes, it comes from Avatar The Last Airbender.

2514
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,480
Did Emmy get to that episode?

2515
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:09,120
I'm not sure.

2516
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:10,880
She might have.

2517
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,360
That's right, even human objects are porous in the Minish world.

2518
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,920
These Minish may not look like much, but they are quite crafty.

2519
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,600
Unfortunately, I think I need something to push that.

2520
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,160
Oh hello, hi.

2521
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:26,720
This cafe is so busy, you can hear all sorts of stuff from the people here.

2522
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:30,080
Oh my god, their bed is a freaking take off!

2523
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:32,640
Ah, I can't handle how cute this game is.

2524
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:36,000
It's hard not to get stepped on when there are so many people here.

2525
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,920
Their posters are stamps!

2526
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,520
So cute, and look at their little light.

2527
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,800
It's a wee globey thing.

2528
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,160
And they got like a little baby!

2529
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,920
Oh my god, they have baby pottery.

2530
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,680
Look at the tiny plates and everything.

2531
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,680
Oh my god, the floor is a menu!

2532
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,720
Oh come on, you cannot tell me this game wasn't a passion,

2533
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:57,280
a project of love from the development team.

2534
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,080
It's so cute.

2535
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,280
It's so kawaii.

2536
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,440
How am I supposed to...

2537
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:04,880
How am I supposed to do this?

2538
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,400
It's so cute.

2539
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,640
Wait, hold on a minute.

2540
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:10,160
Are you squidding me right now?

2541
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,560
Look at your avatar then asked the question again.

2542
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,320
If you can look sexy...

2543
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,920
It's the pixel girl can do.

2544
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,200
Thank you.

2545
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,440
You like my watermelon hair?

2546
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:21,920
Thank you.

2547
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:24,240
Thank you very much for the tip.

2548
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:25,600
All right, the super chat.

2549
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,000
Sorry, I'm not supposed to get them confused.

2550
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,240
Wait, I want to talk to the chickadee!

2551
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:30,720
Hello!

2552
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,360
Hi, little baby.

2553
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:33,760
Hello!

2554
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,440
Eep!

2555
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,320
One of the menace.

2556
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:36,880
Peep!

2557
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,160
I'm not like my brothers.

2558
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:40,000
I won't chase you around and pick you.

2559
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,080
Not only that, I have some good info for you.

2560
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:43,840
Somewhere in Hyrule, there's a great fairy

2561
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,600
who helps honest adventures.

2562
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:49,280
If you hear her, answer her every question truthfully.

2563
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,320
You want to chit chit use kensun?

2564
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,520
Oh, I'm so sorry!

2565
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:57,040
Oh my god, look at this fucking wee icon!

2566
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,440
That's the cutest thing ever!

2567
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,560
Oh my god!

2568
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,280
I'm so sorry!

2569
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:04,640
I'll come back with kensun soon.

2570
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,920
I'm so sorry!

2571
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:06,880
Go menace, sorry!

2572
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,600
All right, what's over here?

2573
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:11,360
I don't know.

2574
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,080
There's a bush.

2575
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,760
We can go inside this building.

2576
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:19,760
Oh!

2577
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:22,560
What is this?

2578
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,080
There's construction men.

2579
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:26,480
Hello!

2580
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,880
The boss makes him rough,

2581
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,480
but he's a real softy at heart.

2582
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:31,040
Aww.

2583
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,920
Now this kid is trying to eat stuff, though.

2584
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:42,640
Hello!

2585
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:43,600
Oh, you want to trade?

2586
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,720
Yeah, let's view it.

2587
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,080
Oh, I don't have any green.

2588
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:47,600
Sorry.

2589
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,240
Listen up.

2590
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,200
I'm a skilled carpenter

2591
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,400
and I'm looking for a challenge.

2592
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:52,080
Uh, okay.

2593
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:52,400
Hi!

2594
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:57,520
I'm really quite good at tracking down rare figurines.

2595
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:58,560
Okay.

2596
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,280
Hi!

2597
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,360
Hello, puppy!

2598
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:01,680
Hello!

2599
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:05,920
What is all this?

2600
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:06,320
I'm busy.

2601
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:06,720
Don't you see?

2602
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,080
Do not disturb my research.

2603
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,520
If you have no business, be gone!

2604
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:11,600
Sorry, please.

2605
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,680
Can I get any green kensun from here?

2606
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,160
One green kensun.

2607
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:19,520
One.

2608
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,000
Fine.

2609
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,640
I'll get a rupee.

2610
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,120
I'll take it.

2611
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:23,840
Hello!

2612
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,040
Speak!

2613
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,080
I collected those mysterious shells.

2614
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,080
Ah!

2615
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,520
I collect those mysterious shells

2616
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,280
you've been scattered all over the place.

2617
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:34,240
If you bring these shells,

2618
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,080
I'll trade you these figurines I've made.

2619
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,920
Ah, what is that mysterious shell?

2620
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:39,520
Hmm, I've got an offer I'd like to make you.

2621
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,840
What do you say for trading it

2622
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,360
for a chance of winning a figurine?

2623
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:43,600
Sure.

2624
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:46,640
How many shells would you like to use?

2625
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:47,600
The more shells you use,

2626
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,880
the more likely to have a figurine.

2627
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:51,920
Probability, 100%.

2628
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,960
Well, I'll just use one.

2629
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,320
You're going to trade one of them?

2630
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:54,720
Great.

2631
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,760
Now just pull the lever on the figure dispensing machine.

2632
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,600
I will pull the lever.

2633
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,400
Ego de...

2634
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:03,200
Oh no!

2635
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:03,760
Gacha!

2636
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,160
This is gacha pawn.

2637
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,920
Pesto.

2638
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,760
Appears in Minish Road's dungeons.

2639
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,280
They are red and blue ones.

2640
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,680
The blue ones are stronger

2641
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:15,120
and throw things down on your head.

2642
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:17,600
Congratulations!

2643
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:19,280
I'll keep the figures in this case

2644
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,240
on the left for you.

2645
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,600
You can see them anytime.

2646
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,400
Oh, that's so cute!

2647
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,360
We'll come back and do that.

2648
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,440
I think that's going to be quite time consuming,

2649
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,000
to be honest.

2650
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,400
Can I have a figurine?

2651
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,120
Or is the answer no?

2652
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:32,080
Hey, I can still.

2653
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:32,640
Pardon me.

2654
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:36,000
I don't think I'm allowed it.

2655
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:36,320
Okay.

2656
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,000
Let's jump on this.

2657
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,840
This is mainly a same quest for 100%.

2658
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:42,480
Okay, okay.

2659
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,600
Uh, I might...

2660
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,160
Oh, hello!

2661
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:47,680
Oh, sorry.

2662
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:48,160
Am I in the way?

2663
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:48,800
I just wanted to...

2664
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,160
Anyway, it's nice of you to say hi.

2665
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:50,960
Sorry for the trouble.

2666
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:51,520
Move now.

2667
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:51,840
Aw.

2668
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,200
Yeah, I want to...

2669
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:54,480
Aw, don't have green!

2670
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:56,080
I'm sorry.

2671
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,120
I don't have green.

2672
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,720
Wow!

2673
02:11:58,720 --> 02:11:59,680
What's going on here?

2674
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,360
Well, we can't go up,

2675
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,320
so we can go...

2676
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:02,720
Hello!

2677
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:06,160
Hey, do you know the clothes that reveal the location of treasure?

2678
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:08,640
Cross the bridge that spans the rapid flow

2679
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:10,320
through the land of the fearsome beast

2680
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:11,520
until you reach the misty falls

2681
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,360
where treasure sleeps on the other side of this bridge?

2682
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:17,040
Um, okay.

2683
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:19,360
Okay.

2684
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:23,360
Wait a minute.

2685
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,200
Wait a minute.

2686
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,160
I am getting a memory.

2687
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,200
Oh, I can't use the stairs!

2688
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,280
Sugar.

2689
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:37,600
There's...

2690
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,600
So, there is a push ring item.

2691
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:40,880
Um...

2692
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:43,040
Wow.

2693
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,920
Okay, so the dog moves now,

2694
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,080
so we can, like, get access to this area,

2695
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:48,800
which is good.

2696
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:49,520
Hi, Popper!

2697
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,080
You okay?

2698
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:52,240
Oh, he's happy now, which is good.

2699
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:56,640
Wait, so why can't I get into this guy's house?

2700
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,240
What is all this?

2701
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:00,880
I'm busy.

2702
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:01,920
Do not disturb my research.

2703
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:03,200
If you have no business, be gone.

2704
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:07,760
Excuse me, doggy.

2705
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,040
You're still in the way.

2706
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:10,000
Excuse me, doggy.

2707
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:10,720
You're still in...

2708
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,840
Excuse me, doggy.

2709
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,640
Thank you.

2710
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,160
Hello?

2711
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:15,760
Dev team?

2712
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:17,360
Okay, there.

2713
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:18,000
There, jeez.

2714
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:21,680
I think we have to do a library quest,

2715
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:22,480
or not yet.

2716
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,560
But, sure, I'll use Ken's stuff.

2717
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,040
Red!

2718
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:29,440
I won't even have a red one.

2719
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:31,920
I'll get the ring later.

2720
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,120
Okay, that's fine.

2721
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,000
Right, Reeflings.

2722
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,200
Time to feed you.

2723
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,320
Who's hungry?

2724
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,200
Let's get the cake.

2725
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,120
Hello.

2726
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:39,760
Welcome.

2727
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,240
You've come.

2728
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,800
I have a pretty tasty slice.

2729
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:44,560
60 rupees!

2730
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:45,760
That's a bit of a rip off, hey,

2731
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:46,800
and I'm gonna be honest.

2732
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,360
All right, we did get a Ken's stone piece, though,

2733
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:50,880
and we did get a Ken's stone piece.

2734
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,640
Is that how you farm Ken's stone pieces?

2735
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,400
Hello?

2736
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:54,800
Howdy.

2737
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:55,920
Come get your fresh veggies.

2738
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:57,040
They're fresher than fresh.

2739
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:59,040
Straight out of the ground.

2740
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,160
Uh, what are you?

2741
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,720
Ah, that's unfortunate.

2742
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,280
They're not opening it.

2743
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:04,000
We'll come back later.

2744
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:04,800
Okay, that's fine.

2745
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,080
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Postman.

2746
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:06,880
You're in my way.

2747
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,160
Oh, now you're both in my way.

2748
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,280
Oh, okay, everyone's in my way.

2749
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:09,760
That's fine.

2750
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:11,600
The door's shut.

2751
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:12,880
We can't open it from this side.

2752
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:13,360
How bizarre.

2753
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,880
Finally, a sandwich.

2754
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,280
Yeah.

2755
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:22,400
Well, we go get some food and...

2756
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:26,640
Open.

2757
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:29,840
Open sesame.

2758
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:33,120
Right, we can't seem to do the ring yet.

2759
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,800
This is the ring.

2760
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,720
Oh, there's a child in one of you.

2761
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:39,040
I don't have your pace.

2762
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,360
Stop asking for pieces that I don't have.

2763
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,520
Don't be so selfish.

2764
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:43,920
Hello?

2765
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:45,760
I really wanna play a game,

2766
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,880
but this place isn't open yet.

2767
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,080
Guess I got here too early.

2768
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:48,880
Okay, that's fine.

2769
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:49,600
What's this?

2770
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:55,040
Oh, wait, I can make my shield bigger?

2771
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,880
What's for you?

2772
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,440
What are you?

2773
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:57,920
Hello?

2774
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:58,480
What is this?

2775
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,520
For only 80 rupees for a wallet.

2776
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,560
Oh, I don't have enough.

2777
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,680
Oh, we maybe could have had enough

2778
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:07,360
if I didn't spend it on the cake.

2779
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,160
But you know what?

2780
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,520
I'm happy I got to treat you.

2781
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,440
And we already got five back.

2782
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:12,480
It was like an investment.

2783
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:13,840
Go in here.

2784
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:14,720
Go in the well.

2785
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,080
Go in the well.

2786
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:16,640
In the well.

2787
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:17,280
In the well.

2788
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:18,880
Exactly.

2789
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:23,040
Oh, why is it giving demon noises?

2790
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,840
Oh, I can't swim yet.

2791
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:26,640
I'm not good enough.

2792
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,520
The snakes can also steal your shield.

2793
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,280
So you have to get it back.

2794
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,480
That's unfortunate.

2795
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,440
They're not open yet.

2796
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:38,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2797
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,480
I'm getting the picture that nothing's open

2798
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,160
because I'm trying to do stuff a bit too early

2799
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,920
in the sections.

2800
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,360
Right, let's go to the castle.

2801
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,600
We will infuse our lovely sword.

2802
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:52,160
And then we will have a quick break

2803
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,440
and I will make a cup of tea.

2804
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:57,280
So my voice doesn't shatter into a thousand different pieces.

2805
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,320
Is there something to the right?

2806
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,320
Oh, I've not unlocked it.

2807
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:01,600
Whoa, gammy.

2808
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:04,160
Gammy's aggro.

2809
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:05,440
Gammy, that's not it.

2810
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,360
Don't be aggro, gammy.

2811
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:08,080
It's bad.

2812
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,520
It's bombless.

2813
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:15,520
What's over here?

2814
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,840
I can't swim.

2815
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:20,560
Whoa, he's got a bomb in his hand.

2816
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,480
Whoa, look at the size of that waterfall.

2817
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,560
Beautiful, simply beautiful, my boy.

2818
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,000
I'm glad he appreciates.

2819
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,040
All right, we can't swim.

2820
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,960
So there's absolutely nothing we can do in this area.

2821
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:33,760
Don't forget the golden snakes.

2822
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:34,560
So they got money.

2823
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:40,080
Oh, it's like a little minch thing here.

2824
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,520
Oh, I'm glad I picked that up for whatever future use I mean to have for it.

2825
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,760
I know, gammy's feeling a bit possessed right now and it's fine.

2826
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:50,720
What's this?

2827
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:51,600
Royal Valley.

2828
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:55,120
Well, bombless since we've got full bomb anyway,

2829
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,480
so it's probably going to be a waste of a bomb.

2830
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,560
What the heck is this place?

2831
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:06,000
Whoa, I'll take it.

2832
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,200
A piece of part.

2833
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,720
Oh, we've got a new heart container.

2834
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,680
That's fantastic.

2835
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:13,680
Okay, we can't swim.

2836
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:14,320
We can't swim.

2837
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:14,960
So it's fine.

2838
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,200
Fantastico.

2839
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,720
We have a new heart container.

2840
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,560
We love tea in this house.

2841
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:25,360
Just got here.

2842
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:26,560
What's happened so far?

2843
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:28,560
We have got the earth element.

2844
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:30,240
We've just picked up the fire element

2845
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:32,720
and we're about to infuse the sword.

2846
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:36,080
Are you sure I look all right?

2847
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,480
I never know what to wear for formal occasions.

2848
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:39,440
My guy, you're a hat.

2849
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:46,800
We basically just need to go under the castle to find the secret room.

2850
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:53,280
And then we can learn a new technique from the sword master.

2851
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,080
But yeah, very beautiful.

2852
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:59,200
Link, look, see that doorway goes?

2853
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,240
Could that be the door that leads to the sanctuary?

2854
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,240
Nobody in this castle seems to be able to see it,

2855
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,200
but you and me.

2856
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:06,080
Let's go quickly.

2857
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:09,440
It's elemental sanctuary.

2858
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:11,920
Wow, the music, the music.

2859
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:13,760
The music, please.

2860
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:18,960
Wow.

2861
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,000
Okay, there it is.

2862
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,920
Hmm.

2863
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:30,320
So this is the elemental sanctuary then.

2864
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:33,360
This is where we can infuse your blade with the power of the elements.

2865
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:36,400
Yes, that seems to be the pedestal for it.

2866
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,520
Let's shove it in.

2867
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:39,280
Bump.

2868
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:42,880
There we go.

2869
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,240
Two element and some fears.

2870
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:46,640
We're doing it.

2871
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:51,520
It's perfect.

2872
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:56,880
It glows.

2873
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:05,120
The powers of earthen fire elements have infused your blade.

2874
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:15,600
Let's see if I can read that tablet for you.

2875
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:18,960
Fill your sword with the power and walk over the glowing tail.

2876
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:22,880
Perhaps it refers to those flashing spots on the floor around you.

2877
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:24,320
Well, what are you waiting for?

2878
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,040
Try it, Link.

2879
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:28,880
Oh, not yet.

2880
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:31,600
There's two of us.

2881
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,200
You just split in two.

2882
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,200
So this is the power of the white sword?

2883
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,520
I guess you can double yourself like that

2884
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:41,040
anytime when you see those panels.

2885
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:47,200
Okay, now we have a few more abilities, which is good.

2886
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:54,720
Um, there was a few things back the way that we did overlook.

2887
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,480
We're going to go back and hit the town

2888
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:00,080
because I want to learn what the master possession will teach us.

2889
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:04,240
Um, right, we'll run back into town

2890
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,640
and then we'll run and get snacks and go for a pee.

2891
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:07,840
Okay.

2892
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,240
What dungeon?

2893
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,600
This is the Castello.

2894
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:14,240
We're getting the elements infused

2895
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:16,000
and we're about to go for the third element.

2896
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:19,280
Oh, wait, there's a snake to the right, isn't there?

2897
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:22,560
Oh, I can't get access to it because of the guards.

2898
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:23,680
I don't know.

2899
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:25,440
I tried.

2900
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:26,480
Um, oh!

2901
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:30,480
Oh, they're English.

2902
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:31,680
Wait, what's an English voice?

2903
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:33,280
Interesting.

2904
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,080
You're the last person I expected to find here

2905
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:38,960
and just as I was wondering who could be behind this,

2906
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,200
I find my old master.

2907
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:47,140
Wow.

2908
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,540
Vati!

2909
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:55,920
Oh, and as always, you are dressed in the shabbiest of rags.

2910
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,720
My curses are not to be mocked.

2911
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:01,440
The one I cast on you is the most powerful.

2912
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:05,600
No matter what power you wield, you will never break it.

2913
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,520
You have me changed in the slightest, yabam.

2914
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,240
I should never have created that cap.

2915
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:16,480
It only fueled your insane desires.

2916
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,760
Thank you for becoming a member, Sortar.

2917
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:21,040
Sortar B'lain.

2918
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:23,680
Fool.

2919
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:27,360
A hat that grants the wishes of its wearer

2920
02:21:27,360 --> 02:21:29,600
as a spectacular creation.

2921
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,720
Thanks to you, I have gone from being a meek miniscule,

2922
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:36,080
nothing to the greatest sorcerer alive.

2923
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,560
You cannot stop me now and I have you to thank for it.

2924
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,600
Accept the small gesture of gratitude from me.

2925
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,320
Wait, Vati, wait, you fucking bam.

2926
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:50,080
Oh, yeah.

2927
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:51,200
Oh, yeah.

2928
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:51,920
Oh, yeah, bitch!

2929
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:56,000
I'm just sp- I'm just spamming, I'm just spamming.

2930
02:21:57,600 --> 02:21:58,480
Okay, it's not that bad.

2931
02:21:58,480 --> 02:21:59,120
It's not that bad.

2932
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:02,320
Okay, we're fine.

2933
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:04,240
I wasn't as bad as I anticipated.

2934
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,600
That foul Vati.

2935
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:06,400
What could he be?

2936
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:06,880
He?

2937
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:10,880
He?

2938
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:11,680
Question mark.

2939
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:14,800
He?

2940
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:16,720
Is it not a lady?

2941
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,440
What could he be scheming now?

2942
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:24,240
Link, I feel I owe you an explanation for what just happened.

2943
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:27,040
You see, Vati and I are actually both menish.

2944
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:31,920
I was once a famous sage and a renowned menish craftsman.

2945
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,280
Vati was only a boy.

2946
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:34,480
Okay, it's definitely a guy.

2947
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:38,320
Vati was only a boy when it took him in as my apprentice,

2948
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:42,480
but he became enchanted by the wickedness in the hearts of men.

2949
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,120
One day, Vati took a hat I made for the humans.

2950
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:46,480
My pride and joy.

2951
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:48,400
It granted the wishes of its wearer.

2952
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:50,240
He put it on without my permission, though.

2953
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:52,880
Am I going to flashback?

2954
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:54,240
Okay, it's a guy.

2955
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:57,440
I thought Vati was a chick.

2956
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,640
Vati, what are you doing here?

2957
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:02,400
Oh my god, that's her hat.

2958
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:06,160
Oh, yeah.

2959
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:11,120
Oh, what a vile form you've taken.

2960
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:16,000
Vio, I can't do an English male voice.

2961
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:19,040
I need to sound like Phil from EastEnders.

2962
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,360
Vio, I am a sorcerer now,

2963
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,760
and my power is beyond compare.

2964
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,120
No longer will I tire away as your apprentice.

2965
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,760
Now, all shall call me master.

2966
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:33,520
Wait, Vati, what are you plotting?

2967
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,040
This year, on the day that comes,

2968
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:40,640
but once a century, the portal opens.

2969
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:44,720
And when it does, I shall claim the life force as my own.

2970
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:47,200
I will be transformed, perfect,

2971
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,360
and there will be none who can stop me.

2972
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,400
Oh no, so that's who we have.

2973
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:07,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2974
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:11,840
Tell me, how does it feel, why sorcerers kiss?

2975
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:13,760
Do you see, Eslo?

2976
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,840
I am truly your master now.

2977
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,520
You cannot stop me, and with that, I must believe it.

2978
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,560
And that's how Eslo came to be.

2979
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,880
You know the legends, of course.

2980
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,160
The gift the Pokori gave the humans.

2981
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:33,200
What you call the Pokori Blade was the first of these gifts.

2982
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,000
The second, well, you call it the light force,

2983
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,720
but it is the source of limitless magic, power.

2984
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:43,360
If Vati were to be able to get it now, it would be devastating.

2985
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:47,760
I came to the world of men, hoping to stop Vati,

2986
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:49,280
and I came to you in the woods.

2987
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:51,360
You did want that?

2988
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:55,200
But it seems we won't be breaking the curse any time soon.

2989
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,040
However, with the Sacred Blade,

2990
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,600
we can certainly restore the Princess Zelda.

2991
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:05,600
I'm sorry, all that has happened has been due to my pride, my folly.

2992
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:10,000
I must rely on you, on your power, until we put an end to Vati.

2993
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:12,820
Monk.

2994
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:17,920
Well, Link, enough fairy tales.

2995
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:20,000
We must search for the next element.

2996
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,720
I don't know where to go.

2997
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:28,960
Right, we'll go into town, and then I'll have a little break,

2998
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:31,200
and I'll go make a tea, okay?

2999
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:33,440
And you guys can stretch your...

3000
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:33,940
No.

3001
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:39,520
Your legs to prevent any issues with your penis.

3002
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,020
Okay.

3003
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,160
Sorry.

3004
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:43,520
Set that the wrong way around.

3005
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,000
You're to stretch your legs so you don't have any issues.

3006
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,800
I will leave the game running in the background,

3007
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,880
whilst I go get my Koopa save.

3008
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,200
Already lost.

3009
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,720
We didn't even get started.

3010
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:57,440
Stretch the tentacle.

3011
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:01,280
Right, I'll leave the game so you guys can appreciate the music

3012
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:01,920
for what it's worth.

3013
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,520
This game is very adorable.

3014
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:05,200
We are already two elements.

3015
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,800
We are about to go for the third.

3016
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,560
If I'm not mistaken, the shoe shop should be open,

3017
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,640
because I've just remembered where we're heading next.

3018
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,240
Please do grab a snack, get some hydration,

3019
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:17,600
do go for a tinkle as well.

3020
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:19,200
It's not good to hold in your bladder.

3021
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,720
The only reason I don't need to pee a lot

3022
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:23,600
is because I am severely dehydrated.

3023
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:24,320
Let's go.

3024
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:25,920
We love severely dehydrated.

3025
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,680
I mean, you never have to go for breaks.

3026
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:31,200
But yes, get some snacks.

3027
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,080
I will get some too.

3028
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,360
I will be a couple of minutes,

3029
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:34,720
but I shan't be long.

3030
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:35,760
Okay, I shan't be long.

3031
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:38,800
T-minus warning for

3032
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:40,960
Emi?

3033
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:42,960
Question mark?

3034
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,200
Emi coming on in one hour 20?

3035
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,160
Question mark?

3036
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:46,800
I think.

3037
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:47,440
I'm not sure.

3038
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:51,600
I should be able to redirect,

3039
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,280
whichever issue it is.

3040
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:54,880
I can't remember what game you're playing, Emi.

3041
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,960
I know you've got a collab this week on...

3042
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:58,800
No, don't talk.

3043
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,680
Nobody explodes.

3044
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,080
Yes, I'll be back in a moment.

3045
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,440
Give me a few minutes, okay?

3046
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:27,120
Are you squinting me right now?

3047
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:57,120
Do you want me to do it again?

3048
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,360
Do you want me to do it again?

3049
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,360

....

3221
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:47,360
Give me future

3222
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,360
Give me future

3223
02:36:49,360 --> 02:36:51,360
Give me future

3224
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:53,360
You are too f**king thrown in a border

3225
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:55,360
Where my god?

3226
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:57,360
Gimli and Beato came flying around the corner

3227
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:01,360
I was like ooo

3228
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:03,360
I may or may not have forgotten to feed them this morning

3229
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,360
Eps

3230
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:06,400
Have back

3231
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,400
Have back

3232
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:11,720
So, I'm eating leftovers, and I was like,

3233
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:13,680
hurry, hurry, hurry, the ruffles are waiting,

3234
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:16,320
the ruffles are waiting, and I was pouring cheese,

3235
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:18,000
like a wee bit of grated cheese on it,

3236
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,040
the entire bag fell out on the meal,

3237
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:22,280
and I'm like, are you effing kidding me right now?

3238
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:25,160
Like the kettle's boiling, cats are body-me-amming.

3239
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:27,680
I'm like, oh my god, the poor ruffles

3240
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,880
are just sitting on this freaking title screen.

3241
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,800
I didn't understand a single word by a gray,

3242
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:35,560
thank you, thank you for agreeing.

3243
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:37,600
Right, I'm saying something like that too.

3244
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:42,640
Okay, T minus one hour 30,

3245
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:45,760
and then part one of Minish Cap is complete.

3246
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:49,920
I do have a warm, I've actually got a cola.

3247
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:55,960
Love me cola, I do, I do.

3248
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:58,800
I was so scared, well, because I was away.

3249
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:04,000
Right, we need to check out the shoe shop,

3250
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,480
because I believe this is where we're heading next.

3251
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:10,960
Yes, hello, was that, oh, welcome,

3252
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:13,280
welcome to Rem's shoe shop.

3253
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:14,880
Lately, whenever I take a nap,

3254
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:16,360
all my shoes are done when I wake up,

3255
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:18,520
you know, if I can make shoes in my sleep,

3256
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:20,400
I must be in the right job.

3257
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:24,400
However, things are not as it seems, no, no, no.

3258
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:30,120
We're gonna take out, oh yeah, piss.

3259
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:31,800
Yeah, I can't reach it.

3260
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:34,360
Okay, 70 AM cola, literally.

3261
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:40,160
Actually, I can't believe I'm saying this.

3262
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:43,280
I have to actually work after I finish the stream.

3263
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,520
Well, the other stream as well.

3264
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:45,880
Wait, is everything open now?

3265
02:38:45,880 --> 02:38:46,720
No.

3266
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,400
Okay, it's not open.

3267
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:55,640
Oh, right, is the library open now?

3268
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:56,800
Question mark.

3269
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:00,080
No, that's the school.

3270
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:01,400
No, it's not open.

3271
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:07,200
There's a little mini-pot up there, oh yeah.

3272
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:13,800
Am I supposed to go down and discover the swamp

3273
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:16,360
and then come back to the town, possibly?

3274
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,320
Very probable.

3275
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,120
So you don't consider streaming work.

3276
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:23,720
This ain't work.

3277
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:26,240
I thought this ain't work.

3278
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:28,040
This is not work.

3279
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:30,160
I absolutely, hello.

3280
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:32,160
Oh, hello, my brother's at school, okay.

3281
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:37,320
Failed the bench delt test or whatever the freaking thing is.

3282
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:40,320
I can't remember what it was, but I was laughing my ass off

3283
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:43,400
because Lord of the Rings fails the bench delt test.

3284
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:49,160
And I was like, oh, it's still a good movie, who cares?

3285
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:53,120
I was like, where the heck am I supposed to do it?

3286
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:54,640
Right, I think we're just to go to the swamp

3287
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:56,920
and discover that we can walk in.

3288
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:59,880
The bench delt test, it's like a test

3289
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:04,880
and it's like, if two lambs speak to each other,

3290
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:08,560
but it's not about a man, then it passes.

3291
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:11,400
And it seems like such a small thing,

3292
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:14,000
but it never happens in movies

3293
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,920
because obviously movies have to be centered around the plot.

3294
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:19,720
Right, I guess I have to go all the way up and into the thing.

3295
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:23,680
So it's quite humorous.

3296
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:25,400
Don't take it too seriously.

3297
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:27,640
People don't really take it too seriously.

3298
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:30,200
It's fucking relax, it's not that serious.

3299
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:32,760
Two named women characters talk to each other

3300
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,800
something other than that.

3301
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like something funny like that.

3302
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:39,760
And it's like, a lot of things fail it, which is hilarious.

3303
02:40:41,080 --> 02:40:44,000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, double drop.

3304
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,760
Hello, is the game feeling nice?

3305
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:48,360
Is there like more under here?

3306
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:52,040
I'll start picking these up if I get a piece.

3307
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:56,880
Is the game feeling bad for not giving me them?

3308
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,480
Good, because it should feel bad.

3309
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:02,240
Mummy, can we do a Lord of the Rings watch long?

3310
02:41:02,240 --> 02:41:06,000
Yes, you're actually doing it with me

3311
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,280
on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

3312
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:09,640
We're doing Lord of the Rings first,

3313
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:11,280
and then we're doing the Hobbit.

3314
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:16,160
Just because I am aware that

3315
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:19,520
Crumble Time can be a bit sore, a bit not fun.

3316
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:21,360
Whoa, blue.

3317
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:24,520
Whoa, you got those guys.

3318
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:27,680
Wait, I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.

3319
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:29,040
Oh my God, oh my God,

3320
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:31,600
the game's feeling so nice right now, what the heck?

3321
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:33,040
I'm cutting the grass, I'm cutting the grass.

3322
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,200
Hold on, let me cut the grass.

3323
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:38,200
You don't understand, I need to cut all the grass right now.

3324
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:39,600
I'll grab that shell though.

3325
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:42,920
And we're getting money for doing it too.

3326
02:41:42,920 --> 02:41:44,160
I wasn't kidding when this,

3327
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:46,400
this is literally grass cut simulator.

3328
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,280
Oh my God, there's so many.

3329
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:53,640
Hold on, we might actually have to go back to town

3330
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:55,600
if it's given me that much.

3331
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:01,920
What's in here?

3332
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:05,240
A red piece, oh, someone wanted to trade us a red piece.

3333
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:07,880
Oh no, but I can't remember the location.

3334
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:14,840
Hey, it's me, it's the two-year reefing badge, no it's not.

3335
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:17,600
Oh right, cause it's a, sorry, sorry, I was like,

3336
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:21,320
I was like, that is impossible,

3337
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:23,080
unless we've got time traveling here.

3338
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:25,640
We're cutting the grass.

3339
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:28,440
I assume if it stops giving us stones,

3340
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:31,480
then it stops, right, what's in here?

3341
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:35,520
Oh hello, hello, I am Percy,

3342
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:38,120
poet literature of Hyrule,

3343
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:39,920
and you are Link, sorry I skip that.

3344
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,400
I travel all over the realm,

3345
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:43,360
writing verses wherever I go,

3346
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:45,720
but here I am, returning after a long absence,

3347
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:47,760
only to find the road blocked.

3348
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:49,320
It wouldn't feel like such a waste

3349
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:51,680
if I hadn't lost half of my kinstone,

3350
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,640
where misfortune rains down upon my head

3351
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:54,960
at pores and torrents.

3352
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,800
I think I may have dropped it in the inn

3353
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:58,680
I stayed in last night.

3354
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:00,280
I see no other course than to put

3355
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:02,200
these tragic events to verse.

3356
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:04,040
I see stars beyond the rainbow,

3357
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:05,920
but I cannot reach them.

3358
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:08,200
Through the stone, though the stone out,

3359
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:12,120
I lost a small, large wizards placing my heart.

3360
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:15,040
Okay, I need to go back to the inn.

3361
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,320
Is that why it's giving me all these kinstone pieces?

3362
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:23,280
Ah, looks like my drop rate's changed,

3363
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:26,480
so I think I might have to go trade people.

3364
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:31,600
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

3365
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,920
Oh, sorry.

3366
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:35,680
Sorry, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, pal.

3367
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:39,240
Right, we're gonna unlock this route,

3368
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:41,920
because that's literally in my way, it's in my way,

3369
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:42,920
it's in my way.

3370
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:45,640
Please, I need to pick up.

3371
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:46,960
Maybe there's a hidden thing.

3372
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:50,200
No, it was an old man.

3373
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:53,880
All right, drop rate is definitely changed.

3374
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:59,040
Oh, oh, we've got a little cutscene moment.

3375
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:00,760
Eh, what a strange feeling.

3376
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:03,440
I sense something from the castle's direction,

3377
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:04,680
or was it just me?

3378
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:06,640
Oh, we need to go back to the castle?

3379
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:12,600
Oh, Phil from EastEnders, right, let's go.

3380
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:18,160
Oh, who's there?

3381
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:22,120
Eh, Vati, how did you get in here?

3382
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:25,280
I don't know how to do an English voice.

3383
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:29,440
Monka, instead of walking the teleport,

3384
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:30,920
talk about being lazy.

3385
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:34,000
Uh, what are you doing?

3386
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:38,960
Eh, given that sloppy toppy, clearly.

3387
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:39,800
Jesus.

3388
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:42,400
What did he do?

3389
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:43,240
Eh?

3390
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:48,200
Oh, he infected the...

3391
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:49,600
It looks like you're all here.

3392
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,680
Very well, the king of Hyrule has words for you.

3393
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:55,120
You all know the power of the Pokora gave to mankind,

3394
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:55,960
do you not?

3395
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:58,480
The golden light force of limitless magical power.

3396
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:00,280
I want it, it's somewhere here in Hyrule,

3397
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:02,040
go now and bring me this power.

3398
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:06,640
Waste no time, go forth at once and bring me the light force.

3399
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:10,960
Oh no, Vati made the king go crazy.

3400
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:13,520
Fling anyone who refuses into the dungeon,

3401
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:15,520
him and his family too, oh, North Korea.

3402
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,600
I will tolerate no disobedience,

3403
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:20,360
now search high and low throughout the lands of Hyrule.

3404
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:23,440
What do they think?

3405
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:27,200
Maybe it's just the wind, but I hope nothing bad has happened.

3406
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,840
Anyway, we need to look for the next element.

3407
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:31,920
The map says it should be around here somewhere.

3408
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,840
Yes, it must be around here.

3409
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:35,160
Pinstone pieces?

3410
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:36,000
Nope.

3411
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:41,120
Gami is getting poised to attack me and see...

3412
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:42,800
Did they just keep flying or did they go...

3413
02:45:42,800 --> 02:45:45,640
Whoa, you don't even have to do anything to them?

3414
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:49,960
Hold on, that's money.

3415
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:52,800
Oh wait, I can get a new wallet if I get 80.

3416
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:54,800
Hold on, let's see if I can get 80 coins,

3417
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:56,600
that might go down quite well.

3418
02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:00,560
Okay, we're gonna go get a new wallet and trade the people,

3419
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:04,240
because there was quite a few trades that I couldn't do.

3420
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:07,560
Well, I think I'm not...

3421
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:08,640
He's really unruly.

3422
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:12,040
So the light force is some kind of treasure,

3423
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:14,840
I can get anywhere, the king must be looking for it.

3424
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:15,680
Right, not you.

3425
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:17,760
You?

3426
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:18,600
You.

3427
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:21,200
Yes.

3428
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:23,240
Can I have this one please?

3429
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:25,040
Two pinstones, but carefully together.

3430
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,040
Hold on, I'm gonna bring my food over

3431
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:29,120
because I don't want it to get too cold.

3432
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,920
Whoa, chest, just a chest, okay, that's fine.

3433
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:36,560
Okay, I'm mixing in my stupendous amount of cheese

3434
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:38,680
for the pasta, hold here.

3435
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:39,680
It's not looking good.

3436
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:43,680
Hey, they fit perfectly, I wonder what's gonna happen.

3437
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:44,880
I get a chest.

3438
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:46,080
Do you trade me?

3439
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:46,920
No, you're done.

3440
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:47,760
How about you?

3441
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:49,280
Everyone still relies here, it's a good thing.

3442
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:52,240
My ideal cafe is a place where everyone can just hang out, yeah.

3443
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:53,080
How about you?

3444
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,200
You wanna fuse pinstone?

3445
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:56,040
Yeah!

3446
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,680
Like a four-leaf clover,

3447
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:02,680
where did you end up meeting a spaghetti?

3448
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:05,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3449
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:13,640
That wasn't what we needed.

3450
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:16,320
When he said N,

3451
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:20,320
oh, the postman!

3452
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:24,160
Oh, wait, wait, I'm not a Mr. Postman.

3453
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:28,160
Baby, I'm a Mr. Postman.

3454
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:29,000
Oh!

3455
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:30,560
What's this?

3456
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:36,800
I really wish I could do more to help people.

3457
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:39,120
Wait, I've got it, I'll ask swiftly

3458
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:41,480
to start up a newsletter for adventures.

3459
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:43,320
That'll be a great way to create a useful service

3460
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:44,320
for everyone, hmm.

3461
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:45,600
It's going to be a lot of work though.

3462
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,680
I should get Marcy to help me.

3463
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:50,160
Marcy?

3464
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:53,040
Help, a fish quiz.

3465
02:47:54,040 --> 02:47:59,040
I have no, I don't have no recollection.

3466
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:02,960
Whoa, there's a new guy in town.

3467
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:06,280
We've got so much fusing.

3468
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:09,640
Hey, did you talk to your mage?

3469
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:13,880
Oh, is a Wind Waker reference?

3470
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:15,560
I don't know.

3471
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:16,720
Another chess, okay.

3472
02:48:20,600 --> 02:48:21,440
Delicious.

3473
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,680
I'm nutritious.

3474
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:28,040
Hey, they fit perfectly, this will be good.

3475
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:29,800
Hello, what do you sell?

3476
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:32,640
Why, hello there, thanks for coming by.

3477
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:35,320
I sell all kinds of pickle, like,

3478
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:37,120
I just put in your bottle and get some patterns

3479
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:38,040
when you drink it.

3480
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:41,120
Hmm, I only drink stuff that reeflings give me,

3481
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:43,160
if I'm gonna be honest.

3482
02:48:43,160 --> 02:48:45,120
Oh no, I don't have it, ugh.

3483
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:48,880
Um, no, there was.

3484
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:50,560
Oh man.

3485
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:56,880
Ah, I don't have it, it's not that red piece, draught.

3486
02:48:58,160 --> 02:48:59,480
Ah, not you.

3487
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:03,120
There was someone here that wanted to,

3488
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:05,160
oh, I just put a bomb down in front of this guy's house.

3489
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:06,640
Sorry mate, it didn't mean that.

3490
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:09,280
Ah, do apologize, don't have it either.

3491
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:12,480
It's not a change of heart.

3492
02:49:13,480 --> 02:49:15,960
I'm just committing war crimes, okay, geez.

3493
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:20,640
Oh, can I fuse you?

3494
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:21,640
No.

3495
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:23,320
Oh wait, did I go back to the sword master?

3496
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,520
Can I, was it you?

3497
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,680
Well, I can fuse with them, so I'll take it.

3498
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:32,400
Oh, the money bag, yes, sorry, I already forgot, geez.

3499
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:35,600
Hmm, I'll grab that now.

3500
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:38,960
Ooh, what's this, quite nice.

3501
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:42,440
A chest.

3502
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,240
Oh, oh, move on, move on, move on, move on.

3503
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,680
They fit perfectly, time to celebrate.

3504
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:56,040
I don't think these guys can do anything for me.

3505
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:58,640
Right, we'll go get the,

3506
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:00,280
sorry, I'm playing one handed right now,

3507
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:01,960
I would go faster if I'm eating.

3508
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,760
I'm trying to eat and progress the story at the same time.

3509
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:12,240
Um, right, first get the rupee bag,

3510
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:16,000
because then we can hold more rupees in general.

3511
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,320
No, not that one.

3512
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:18,160
No.

3513
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:23,440
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

3514
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:25,240
Hello, may I please have this?

3515
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:28,320
Only 80 rupees for a wallet,

3516
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:31,760
it can hold a king's ransom by, yes.

3517
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:35,720
Yo, now you can carry more rupees, perfect.

3518
02:50:35,720 --> 02:50:37,400
Much obliged, my good lad.

3519
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:41,920
Much obliged, I have more, I do have more.

3520
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:45,360
Whoa, I didn't realize you could even go and see

3521
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:46,760
inside the bag.

3522
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:49,960
The reason why I'm asking if I have water is this.

3523
02:50:52,240 --> 02:50:54,120
Literally, you'd never figure it out on your own,

3524
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,120
it's impossible.

3525
02:50:57,240 --> 02:50:58,080
Do you want to trade?

3526
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,560
My dog's real smart and a little spoiled too.

3527
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,880
Aw, that's what you're supposed to do.

3528
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:04,800
You're supposed to, let's go talk to the dog.

3529
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:08,400
Hello, oh, you want to, the dog has a fricking,

3530
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:10,520
aw, it's always the one I don't have.

3531
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:14,440
Some might even take a swipe at you.

3532
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,240
Okay, this dog's nice.

3533
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:17,800
Oh, God.

3534
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:19,920
See, this is why you're supposed to go like that.

3535
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:21,200
Wait.

3536
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:22,800
Oh, no.

3537
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:24,440
Whoa, did you see that cat looking at me?

3538
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:25,920
I know it wants a piece of me.

3539
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:29,800
This is for a later quest, which we're not on right now

3540
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:32,040
because I'm going too far ahead of the plot.

3541
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:33,720
Oops.

3542
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:36,120
He's a good boy.

3543
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:38,360
Just like a replay.

3544
02:51:39,800 --> 02:51:42,360
You're such a good doggy replay, you're the one.

3545
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:45,640
Can I go in now?

3546
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:46,680
Finally.

3547
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:50,800
Right, I'm to trade someone in the end.

3548
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:53,640
Must be upstairs.

3549
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:00,840
Is it you?

3550
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:05,720
And you asked for the one I don't have.

3551
02:52:05,720 --> 02:52:07,160
Is it one of the children?

3552
02:52:08,240 --> 02:52:10,600
Stop asking for the ones I don't have.

3553
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:12,320
Right now.

3554
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:16,760
What's going to happen?

3555
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:18,960
I need to inhale my food, it's getting cold.

3556
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:24,160
Okay, that's a later platform.

3557
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:31,440
Okay, is that...

3558
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:32,280
Oh, you?

3559
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:36,120
Okay, can do it, can do it.

3560
02:52:36,120 --> 02:52:37,320
I'm gonna have to go in the grass

3561
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:39,240
and look for more pinstone.

3562
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:42,440
Hmm.

3563
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:46,280
A chest again?

3564
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:48,440
Okay, it looks like green is all chest.

3565
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:50,360
Oh, wait.

3566
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:55,360
Some sort of monetary gain as I choke on my food.

3567
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:57,120
Gah.

3568
02:52:57,920 --> 02:52:59,800
Okay, can't go out there yet

3569
02:52:59,800 --> 02:53:01,400
because we don't have a light, which is fine.

3570
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:03,120
Is there anyone in here?

3571
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:04,360
No, there's not, okay.

3572
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:07,480
Right, we need to go get pinstones

3573
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:09,400
so we can unlock this next section.

3574
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:13,880
Because we can't frickin' progress.

3575
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:19,320
I'm even sure what to do.

3576
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:21,800
I'm pretty sure there's a tingle man down here.

3577
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:25,680
What?

3578
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:26,520
Yeah, there he is.

3579
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:29,640
Let's go see this tingle man.

3580
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:30,880
Hello, tingle man.

3581
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:32,880
Yeah, I wanna fuse pinstone.

3582
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:35,040
And do you want the one I actually have?

3583
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:36,280
I like it here.

3584
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:37,480
I'm like maneuver.

3585
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:40,040
Oh.

3586
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:42,280
Oh.

3587
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:45,920
Okay, we'll definitely go investigate that

3588
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:46,920
because that's cool.

3589
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:49,920
They fit perfectly.

3590
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,760
Thank you.

3591
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:56,120
Right, we're gonna go get this.

3592
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:56,960
What is it?

3593
02:53:56,960 --> 02:53:58,720
200 shells.

3594
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:00,800
I better not be full with shells.

3595
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:01,640
No, I'm not.

3596
02:54:01,640 --> 02:54:02,480
That's fine.

3597
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:04,280
I don't wanna waste shells.

3598
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:05,360
I'd rather go gamble.

3599
02:54:06,320 --> 02:54:07,640
Yes!

3600
02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:08,480
Right, okay.

3601
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:10,120
I guess I'm just not allowed to have

3602
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:11,680
a certain amount on my person

3603
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,520
or the game is like that's too many

3604
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:15,640
and not fun anymore.

3605
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:18,800
Grass cutting simulator.

3606
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:21,160
Grass cutting simulator.

3607
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:23,960
Simulator, grass cutting simulator.

3608
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:29,440
I don't wanna go back to the guy with only one.

3609
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:30,880
That's so small.

3610
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:33,840
That's so little.

3611
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:36,440
What's over here?

3612
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:40,720
Oh, we don't have access to it yet.

3613
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:47,920
Did I go as far as I could back then?

3614
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:53,080
Or am I gonna have to go to that area?

3615
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:54,360
Just to cut grass.

3616
02:54:54,360 --> 02:54:56,960
Literally making my way over there just to cut grass.

3617
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,440
Dingle, dingle, dingle.

3618
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:07,920
Am I going extra crazy?

3619
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:09,760
Oh my God, I'm going extra crazy.

3620
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:11,960
This is where I'm supposed to go.

3621
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:13,320
I don't need to do anything.

3622
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,600
Ah!

3623
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:18,440
Strat.

3624
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:20,160
This is it.

3625
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:22,600
So, this must be, sorry,

3626
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:25,120
I'm burning myself with my whole war ball right now.

3627
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:26,880
So this must be Caster Wilds.

3628
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:31,880
It's a nasty dank place filled with swamp land and mirror.

3629
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:33,840
Mirror, mire?

3630
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:36,440
But we know there's an element waiting for us.

3631
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:37,920
Come on, Link, let's go.

3632
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:47,640
I don't think we can walk fast enough to cross the swamp.

3633
02:55:47,640 --> 02:55:50,400
We're gonna have to find some way to get across safely.

3634
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:53,080
Okay, I think now that we've done that,

3635
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:56,760
it means we can go to the shoe shop guy again.

3636
02:55:57,720 --> 02:56:02,480
Kingstone can be grander than RuneScape, honestly?

3637
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:06,360
Right, now the shoe shop guy will entertain us.

3638
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:09,880
Or the event will occur, like, that's supposed to happen.

3639
02:56:09,880 --> 02:56:11,200
Oh!

3640
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:13,240
They dropped 20!

3641
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:15,120
Parish right now, give me more money.

3642
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:18,880
So then what was down here?

3643
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:23,640
Did I just get to be?

3644
02:56:23,640 --> 02:56:26,640
I don't think I can go any further when I can.

3645
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:34,920
Kingstone, kingstone, kingstone.

3646
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:36,360
Is that?

3647
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:40,000
Am I losing it?

3648
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:40,840
Am I losing it?

3649
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:43,960
Did I just think I couldn't go any further when I could?

3650
02:56:43,960 --> 02:56:45,400
Oh, my guys.

3651
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:47,160
I'm not gonna make it.

3652
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:48,600
Hello?

3653
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:49,800
I planted it being near my house,

3654
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:51,280
but it just doesn't seem to grow.

3655
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:54,360
No, it won't, because I need to kingstone it.

3656
02:56:55,360 --> 02:56:56,520
Wow.

3657
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,280
The mysterious shells are worse.

3658
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:02,200
I'm almost there.

3659
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:04,680
Doomsday, Dan, thank you for the tip.

3660
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,400
You didn't put a message though.

3661
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,400
Find and read out.

3662
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:10,920
And delay lover, I don't think I said your name again.

3663
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:12,360
Delay lover, be a lure.

3664
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:13,920
I'll figure you identify yourself.

3665
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:18,320
I'm almost there now.

3666
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:22,160
You're gonna have to put up with my tune, okay?

3667
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:23,000
I can't.

3668
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:25,960
I can't do everything.

3669
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:26,800
I don't know.

3670
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:31,920
I just don't know.

3671
02:57:35,320 --> 02:57:36,320
You didn't go any further.

3672
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:37,480
Just assumed you couldn't.

3673
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:39,320
Oh, my God.

3674
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:40,960
Talk about giving up, Mentale.

3675
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:44,680
Wow.

3676
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:47,600
Oh, it's like choke.

3677
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:51,160
I'm swallowing, I'm swallowing, I'm choking, I'm choking.

3678
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:55,000
You want a bite too?

3679
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,080
You most certainly can have a bite.

3680
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:57,640
Go, ah.

3681
02:57:57,640 --> 02:57:59,360
Here comes the airplane.

3682
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:07,120
I've always done any itch, my eyelash.

3683
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:09,680
It's always on my left eye, my first eyelash.

3684
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:16,600
That's four.

3685
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:19,560
All the food is gone.

3686
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:24,640
We will now go back to the shoemaker

3687
02:58:24,640 --> 02:58:28,920
because we need the shoemaker in order to progress.

3688
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:30,280
Oh, ow.

3689
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:32,160
My butt, I was looking at chat

3690
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:34,760
and that gammy sniped my butt.

3691
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:39,280
Delicious, delicious, delicious.

3692
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:40,680
Goodbye.

3693
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:41,520
No.

3694
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:46,920
Chewing the mic and you shall be forgiven.

3695
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:48,520
No, people hate that.

3696
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:52,120
It's like, there's something called like misophobia

3697
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:52,960
or something.

3698
02:58:55,800 --> 02:58:57,360
Oh, here it is, this is the event.

3699
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:59,080
Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it.

3700
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:06,880
Oh, sleepy little, oh, yeah, I worked in too hard.

3701
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:09,360
There we go.

3702
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,240
Hello, hi.

3703
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:15,280
Hey, hey, you're Link, right?

3704
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:18,720
You're the one who brought the sword to Master Merlari.

3705
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:21,480
You're on a quest to help the princess, aren't you?

3706
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:22,760
I wish I could go on a quest,

3707
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:24,760
but then who'd make Rem's shoes for him?

3708
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:27,080
Notice how he's called Rem as in Rem's sleep.

3709
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,760
Like that one beach it better from.

3710
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:35,000
V4, Rem, yeah, Rem, get it.

3711
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:38,080
Hey ho, is that Pegasus boots?

3712
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:40,000
We just made a pair while Rem was sleeping,

3713
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,840
but only Rem can put the finishing touches on them.

3714
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:44,360
Ha ha, that sleepy head.

3715
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:45,960
Rem is nearly impossible to wake up.

3716
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:46,880
If you wanna wake him up,

3717
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,320
you'll need to get an item from Syrups Hop.

3718
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:52,080
It's a little bit of a trek,

3719
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:54,920
but we'll mark it on the map for you.

3720
02:59:56,480 --> 03:00:00,840
So now we need to go up into the right.

3721
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:06,680
Um, oh, I feel freaking detailed all this is.

3722
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:08,160
Who is Rem?

3723
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:12,440
From the other VTuber agency for V-Reverie.

3724
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:14,280
I can, no, not reverie.

3725
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:15,880
Not reverie, hold on a minute.

3726
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:17,080
Not that one.

3727
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:20,200
It's like V4 Mariaeus.

3728
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:24,160
There, V4-Me-E-Ret-Ail.

3729
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:25,360
Look, I'm gonna be honest,

3730
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:27,160
I don't know how on earth to say it.

3731
03:00:28,120 --> 03:00:30,360
You guys are gonna have to spell it out for me

3732
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:32,840
if you want me to say the name of that agency properly,

3733
03:00:32,840 --> 03:00:34,680
cause I ain't got a chance.

3734
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:35,800
I ain't got a chance.

3735
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:37,600
Okay.

3736
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:42,600
My-Rae.

3737
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:44,640
My-Me-Rae?

3738
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:46,680
Mer-Rae.

3739
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:52,160
V4 Mer-Rae.

3740
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:56,440
It was supposed to be a V0 though.

3741
03:00:57,440 --> 03:01:00,320
It said like, me-er-ae.

3742
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:02,960
Me-er-ae.

3743
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,520
Me-er-ae.

3744
03:01:04,520 --> 03:01:05,840
Me-er-ae.

3745
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:06,680
Hello?

3746
03:01:06,680 --> 03:01:07,520
Oh, what's wrong?

3747
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:09,400
You wanna fuse Kinstone?

3748
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:10,480
Sugar, I don't have it.

3749
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:12,000
Oh, you wanna quit too bad.

3750
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,840
Oh, just milked him.

3751
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:15,040
I'm so sorry, sir.

3752
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:17,160
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, sorry.

3753
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:19,120
I didn't mean anything by it.

3754
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:21,280
I lost my keys and I can't get inside.

3755
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:24,420
What pain?

3756
03:01:24,420 --> 03:01:27,460
I think I'm going into town to serve Lon Lon milk.

3757
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:30,540
Oh, well, I can get in the whooshed nae-ball there, didn't you?

3758
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:31,740
Didn't you mind me?

3759
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:34,980
Girls are so cute when they're a little,

3760
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:36,500
when they're a little rere-ere.

3761
03:01:37,820 --> 03:01:40,180
Okay, we need to find the key.

3762
03:01:40,180 --> 03:01:41,540
Or just on the other door.

3763
03:01:45,620 --> 03:01:46,460
Oh, there is.

3764
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:50,580
Okay, we got the key, so now we need to go back

3765
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:53,140
and be like, hey, we touched my goats' thumb, but...

3766
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:56,940
We totally found it.

3767
03:01:56,940 --> 03:02:00,980
And it wasn't through any, not nefarious.

3768
03:02:00,980 --> 03:02:03,820
We had didn't have malicious intent behind finding the key.

3769
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:06,940
Hey, sir, here's your key, all yours.

3770
03:02:07,860 --> 03:02:09,860
Oh, our one and only spare key.

3771
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:11,220
I don't know how you got this,

3772
03:02:11,220 --> 03:02:12,260
but I can't thank you enough.

3773
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:13,860
Tell me your name, Sunny Jim.

3774
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:15,500
Link, that's a great name.

3775
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:18,220
If you ever need to go to Lake Hyalil,

3776
03:02:18,220 --> 03:02:19,700
feel free to cut through our house.

3777
03:02:19,700 --> 03:02:22,420
Yes, that's exactly what we need to do.

3778
03:02:22,420 --> 03:02:23,940
Thank you very much, Link.

3779
03:02:24,860 --> 03:02:25,940
Shut up, little man.

3780
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:26,780
Hello?

3781
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:31,540
Come visit us again at any time, lady.

3782
03:02:31,540 --> 03:02:33,820
I'm just a wee lad, are you?

3783
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:35,620
But if a lady invites you in our house,

3784
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:37,420
who am I to know a blight?

3785
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:42,220
Hello, cow.

3786
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:43,820
Yes, of course, this is me.

3787
03:02:43,820 --> 03:02:46,820
Wait, I'm not getting any more Kinstone drops,

3788
03:02:46,820 --> 03:02:49,220
so I think we're at the limit of orbit gains

3789
03:02:49,220 --> 03:02:50,060
when we give those.

3790
03:02:50,060 --> 03:02:52,580
Oh, I'll tell a lie, I'll tell a Feverruni.

3791
03:02:53,940 --> 03:02:55,300
If she needs milk?

3792
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:56,820
No, she's the one with the milk.

3793
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:58,140
We're just a...

3794
03:02:59,140 --> 03:03:01,420
How tranquil, and those cows look so delicious.

3795
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:05,340
No, we're not eating the cows.

3796
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:06,180
Here we go.

3797
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:07,420
We're not eating the cows.

3798
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:08,940
We're not eating the cows.

3799
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:10,340
We're not eating the cows.

3800
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:12,220
We're not eating the cows.

3801
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:13,660
How...

3802
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:14,420
How is it?

3803
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:15,260
Islo?

3804
03:03:17,100 --> 03:03:20,260
If you can't see Mariah,

3805
03:03:20,260 --> 03:03:23,740
can you see purple burglar out or did it?

3806
03:03:23,740 --> 03:03:26,540
One day we'll get through a stream, one day.

3807
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:27,780
That stream is not today.

3808
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:32,420
Yes, I can see it, but if I put on a heavy accent,

3809
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:33,260
I can't see it.

3810
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:36,300
What is that for?

3811
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:43,300
Uh, there is a teleportation.

3812
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:47,100
Like, hiro.

3813
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:49,980
I'm so sorry, by the way,

3814
03:03:49,980 --> 03:03:52,700
for the purple burglar alarm corne meant.

3815
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:55,620
I'm sorry if I sounded like so defeated.

3816
03:03:55,620 --> 03:03:58,100
I'm not like upset or anything.

3817
03:03:58,100 --> 03:03:59,500
It's just...

3818
03:03:59,500 --> 03:04:02,100
You're not the only one who asks about such things.

3819
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:04,780
Wait, can I not get up there already?

3820
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:05,780
I think I can.

3821
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:09,380
Astrony is adorable.

3822
03:04:09,380 --> 03:04:10,900
Astrony is adorable.

3823
03:04:12,260 --> 03:04:13,620
Thank you.

3824
03:04:13,620 --> 03:04:14,860
You know who else is adorable?

3825
03:04:14,860 --> 03:04:16,180
You, please.

3826
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:17,020
Exactly.

3827
03:04:21,940 --> 03:04:23,660
There's a heart.

3828
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:24,860
Oh, no, but we can't reach it.

3829
03:04:24,860 --> 03:04:26,220
We need some to...

3830
03:04:26,220 --> 03:04:27,380
Oh, we got a serious.

3831
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:29,100
We got a red one, though.

3832
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:31,100
Do we go in a tunnel and try and get up?

3833
03:04:37,300 --> 03:04:42,820
Now, I am 99% sure there is an event,

3834
03:04:42,820 --> 03:04:44,420
a tamed event that comes up,

3835
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:46,100
and I really don't want to screw it up.

3836
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:47,700
Wait, I'll just go straight down.

3837
03:04:51,900 --> 03:04:55,420
And it's to trade that guy back in the one

3838
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:57,900
that I tried to explode his house by accident.

3839
03:04:59,220 --> 03:05:00,820
So we might actually have to go back

3840
03:05:00,820 --> 03:05:02,380
because it's a tamed event.

3841
03:05:02,380 --> 03:05:04,300
And if you don't do it properly,

3842
03:05:04,300 --> 03:05:05,820
well, you're done, so...

3843
03:05:07,300 --> 03:05:09,300
Where am I going with this?

3844
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:12,300
There better be a secret down here.

3845
03:05:15,300 --> 03:05:16,300
Oh, wow.

3846
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:17,300
But I hope this is the right way.

3847
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:19,300
I've just gone off the map.

3848
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:22,300
Lake Helio.

3849
03:05:23,300 --> 03:05:24,300
Please see.

3850
03:05:24,300 --> 03:05:26,300
It's like, this way to Mayor Hagan's

3851
03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:27,300
Lake State Cabin.

3852
03:05:28,300 --> 03:05:30,300
Have I gone the wrong way?

3853
03:05:30,300 --> 03:05:31,300
Oh, my God.

3854
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:32,300
Oh, no.

3855
03:05:32,300 --> 03:05:33,300
I'm just going to have to play the game

3856
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:34,300
even more with you.

3857
03:05:34,300 --> 03:05:35,300
Let's see it.

3858
03:05:40,300 --> 03:05:41,300
Okay, I have gone the wrong way.

3859
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:42,300
I'm pretty sure.

3860
03:05:42,300 --> 03:05:43,300
No, that's not true.

3861
03:05:43,300 --> 03:05:45,300
That's not going to stop me.

3862
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:47,300
Wait.

3863
03:05:47,300 --> 03:05:50,300
No, well, I did go the right way by accident.

3864
03:05:59,300 --> 03:06:01,300
Ah, welcome.

3865
03:06:01,300 --> 03:06:06,300
Care for some of Granny's homemade blue potion.

3866
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:08,300
One sip and you're full of energy.

3867
03:06:08,300 --> 03:06:10,300
Please look around.

3868
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:12,300
I need this mushroom, please.

3869
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:16,300
Oh, yes, a fine choice, my dear.

3870
03:06:16,300 --> 03:06:18,300
That is a limited time article.

3871
03:06:18,300 --> 03:06:20,300
One worth and you're wide awake.

3872
03:06:20,300 --> 03:06:23,300
That is why it is called a wake-up mushroom.

3873
03:06:23,300 --> 03:06:25,300
Would you like to buy it for 60 rupees?

3874
03:06:25,300 --> 03:06:26,300
That's for you.

3875
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:28,300
You got a wake-up mushroom.

3876
03:06:28,300 --> 03:06:29,300
It's a nasty stench.

3877
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:31,300
She chases away the sleepyhead.

3878
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:33,300
Just face the sleepyhead through that

3879
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:35,300
and press the button and he'll...

3880
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:37,300
and the little eyes will pop right open

3881
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:38,300
right out of the skull, yeah.

3882
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:39,300
Thanks, Granny.

3883
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:41,300
Please don't ever interact with me again.

3884
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:42,300
You're terrifying.

3885
03:06:43,300 --> 03:06:45,300
Okay, if we're going back to town,

3886
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,300
I'll try and do that.

3887
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:50,300
But I don't want to miss out on the timed event.

3888
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:51,300
Okay.

3889
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:52,300
If you don't do it,

3890
03:06:52,300 --> 03:06:54,300
a gentleman actually perishes

3891
03:06:54,300 --> 03:06:55,300
and that's true.

3892
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:57,300
Would you drink my blue juice?

3893
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:00,300
You would.

3894
03:07:00,300 --> 03:07:01,300
Admit it.

3895
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:02,300
I know you would.

3896
03:07:02,300 --> 03:07:03,300
No, you don't even have to admit it

3897
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:04,300
because I know you just...

3898
03:07:04,300 --> 03:07:05,300
Sorry, I said that.

3899
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:08,300
Whoa!

3900
03:07:10,300 --> 03:07:11,300
Whoa!

3901
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:12,300
What are you doing here?

3902
03:07:12,300 --> 03:07:14,300
We got another heartbeat by accident.

3903
03:07:14,300 --> 03:07:15,300
I forgot.

3904
03:07:16,300 --> 03:07:18,300
See, exploring pays off

3905
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:20,300
when you play legends of Zelda games

3906
03:07:20,300 --> 03:07:22,300
like they're soon forgiven.

3907
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:25,300
Lon Lon Ranch.

3908
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:28,300
I really need a fart right now.

3909
03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:31,300
I don't know, I shouldn't...

3910
03:07:32,300 --> 03:07:34,300
But I'm going to hold in.

3911
03:07:36,300 --> 03:07:38,300
I assume this is where I was supposed to go.

3912
03:07:38,300 --> 03:07:40,300
No, I was supposed to go up!

3913
03:07:40,300 --> 03:07:41,300
No!

3914
03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:42,300
No!

3915
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:44,300
How did I get back up there again?

3916
03:07:44,300 --> 03:07:45,300
Ow!

3917
03:07:46,300 --> 03:07:47,300
Let's do that.

3918
03:07:48,300 --> 03:07:49,300
Just me a...

3919
03:07:50,300 --> 03:07:51,300
Let it rip.

3920
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:52,300
Very question.

3921
03:07:52,300 --> 03:07:54,300
Would you drink the 20s Aimee?

3922
03:07:55,300 --> 03:07:56,300
Um...

3923
03:07:56,300 --> 03:07:58,300
I don't know how easily I can master this.

3924
03:07:58,300 --> 03:07:59,300
I'll be honest.

3925
03:07:59,300 --> 03:08:01,300
What are you guys?

3926
03:08:01,300 --> 03:08:02,300
Hello!

3927
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:04,300
You don't look aggressive,

3928
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:06,300
but I don't feel like you're angry.

3929
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:07,300
You're not.

3930
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:08,300
You wanna fuse?

3931
03:08:08,300 --> 03:08:09,300
Sure!

3932
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:10,300
Hey, go buddy!

3933
03:08:11,300 --> 03:08:12,300
What does it do?

3934
03:08:12,300 --> 03:08:13,300
It's a Goron!

3935
03:08:13,300 --> 03:08:15,300
His name is Goron.

3936
03:08:18,300 --> 03:08:19,300
Eh?

3937
03:08:23,300 --> 03:08:24,300
Oh!

3938
03:08:24,300 --> 03:08:25,300
No!

3939
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:30,300
It's been a long time since the last time

3940
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:31,300
I visited Hyrule.

3941
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:33,300
I think I'll stay at this place

3942
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:35,300
and I can sell my Kinstone.

3943
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:36,300
Yes!

3944
03:08:36,300 --> 03:08:37,300
This is exactly what we need.

3945
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:39,300
We need to throw our money into him.

3946
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:43,300
Wow, hydration check.

3947
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:45,300
I need to start slipping my tear.

3948
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:46,300
It's gonna get cold.

3949
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:50,300
Hmm, they fit perfectly.

3950
03:08:50,300 --> 03:08:51,300
That's so good.

3951
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:52,300
Are you okay?

3952
03:08:52,300 --> 03:08:53,300
This is one solid wall.

3953
03:08:53,300 --> 03:08:55,300
I need a few friends to give me a hand.

3954
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:57,300
I will get you those friends soon, TM.

3955
03:08:57,300 --> 03:08:58,300
But not yet,

3956
03:08:58,300 --> 03:09:00,300
because I need to do other things.

3957
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,300
Hold on.

3958
03:09:01,300 --> 03:09:04,300
Let me just cut down your produce for you.

3959
03:09:04,300 --> 03:09:05,300
Hello!

3960
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:06,300
Oh!

3961
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:08,300
Riplings!

3962
03:09:08,300 --> 03:09:09,300
They're farmed!

3963
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:10,300
There's no one here,

3964
03:09:10,300 --> 03:09:11,300
so it's ours!

3965
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:12,300
Oh!

3966
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:14,300
Cosmo.

3967
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:15,300
I love working in the garden.

3968
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:16,300
It makes me feel so close to nature

3969
03:09:16,300 --> 03:09:18,300
and sometimes I dig off a Kinstone.

3970
03:09:18,300 --> 03:09:19,300
Right, okay.

3971
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,300
We know what we're doing.

3972
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:22,300
Hee hee hee.

3973
03:09:24,300 --> 03:09:25,300
Please, CJ.

3974
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:26,300
I'm drink tea.

3975
03:09:26,300 --> 03:09:27,300
I drink tea.

3976
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:30,300
Oh my god,

3977
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:31,300
we already helped them out.

3978
03:09:34,300 --> 03:09:36,300
I feel so much stronger now.

3979
03:09:36,300 --> 03:09:37,300
Here we go.

3980
03:09:42,300 --> 03:09:44,300
Sorry, I'm drinking my tea.

3981
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:45,300
It's about time.

3982
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:46,300
Looking good, though.

3983
03:09:46,300 --> 03:09:47,300
I'm going in.

3984
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:50,300
That's what Ripling said.

3985
03:09:55,300 --> 03:09:56,300
Look at that.

3986
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:57,300
A perfect fit.

3987
03:09:57,300 --> 03:09:58,300
Okay, what about you?

3988
03:09:58,300 --> 03:09:59,300
Do you have one?

3989
03:09:59,300 --> 03:10:00,300
You do!

3990
03:10:01,300 --> 03:10:03,300
One a few Kinstone pieces?

3991
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:04,300
Let's rock and roll.

3992
03:10:05,300 --> 03:10:06,300
Yes, please.

3993
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:07,300
Oh, hold on.

3994
03:10:08,300 --> 03:10:09,300
Wait!

3995
03:10:09,300 --> 03:10:10,300
What?

3996
03:10:10,300 --> 03:10:11,300
I did it!

3997
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:12,300
I did it!

3998
03:10:12,300 --> 03:10:13,300
Sorry, sorry.

3999
03:10:13,300 --> 03:10:14,300
I'm trying to play one-handed.

4000
03:10:15,300 --> 03:10:16,300
It's not that kind of game.

4001
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:17,300
That comes later.

4002
03:10:17,300 --> 03:10:18,300
Okay, that comes in July.

4003
03:10:25,300 --> 03:10:26,300
I do remember seeing that.

4004
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:28,300
The wall.

4005
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:30,300
Okay, we're not going to go back to the wall.

4006
03:10:33,300 --> 03:10:35,300
That is very far away.

4007
03:10:35,300 --> 03:10:37,300
Look, I'm helping you tail the soil.

4008
03:10:38,300 --> 03:10:39,300
Oh, there's a sneaky poo.

4009
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:42,300
We will hurt the sneaky poo.

4010
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:45,300
But I want to talk to the guy first.

4011
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:46,300
Hello.

4012
03:10:47,300 --> 03:10:49,300
Hello, I'm at a client.

4013
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:52,300
Oh, no, you need a new buddy.

4014
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:53,300
This is a solid wall.

4015
03:10:53,300 --> 03:10:54,300
I'm going to need a friend.

4016
03:10:54,300 --> 03:10:55,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4017
03:10:55,300 --> 03:10:57,300
We need to just keep doing the Kinstone

4018
03:10:57,300 --> 03:10:59,300
to unlock more events.

4019
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:04,300
And I just realized we unlocked something back here.

4020
03:11:08,300 --> 03:11:11,300
We will go and get it right now.

4021
03:11:11,300 --> 03:11:13,300
Wait, what's over here?

4022
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:19,300
Veil falls.

4023
03:11:19,300 --> 03:11:20,300
I don't...

4024
03:11:20,300 --> 03:11:22,300
No, we're not to be here yet.

4025
03:11:22,300 --> 03:11:23,300
Rit.

4026
03:11:23,300 --> 03:11:24,300
I saw that.

4027
03:11:26,300 --> 03:11:27,300
Spelunking.

4028
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:28,300
No, I can't run.

4029
03:11:28,300 --> 03:11:30,300
I want to escape the word spelunk.

4030
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:32,300
And he fell.

4031
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:33,300
Spelunk.

4032
03:11:33,300 --> 03:11:34,300
Wah.

4033
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:35,300
Okay, hold on.

4034
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:38,300
Is the games being kind and giving me them again?

4035
03:11:41,300 --> 03:11:42,300
What's it?

4036
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:45,300
I'm a fellow spunker, I have to admit.

4037
03:11:46,300 --> 03:11:47,300
Spunks all over you.

4038
03:11:50,300 --> 03:11:53,300
They're top left one, I think we unlocked.

4039
03:11:53,300 --> 03:11:54,300
Sorry, I keep taking damage

4040
03:11:54,300 --> 03:11:56,300
because I'm like hardly paying attention.

4041
03:11:56,300 --> 03:11:58,300
But not in a bad way, just like...

4042
03:11:59,300 --> 03:12:00,300
Mm-hmm.

4043
03:12:02,300 --> 03:12:03,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4044
03:12:03,300 --> 03:12:05,300
There's something in that chair.

4045
03:12:06,300 --> 03:12:08,300
Oh, red, that's perfect.

4046
03:12:11,300 --> 03:12:12,300
Mm-hmm.

4047
03:12:17,300 --> 03:12:20,300
No, no, spelunking means cave exploring.

4048
03:12:20,300 --> 03:12:22,300
That's what we're talking about.

4049
03:12:23,300 --> 03:12:27,300
Right, can I finally trade the freaking guy?

4050
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:29,300
Oh, we need to do this.

4051
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:33,300
Wait, it does disappear and he gets a fright every time.

4052
03:12:33,300 --> 03:12:34,300
We get it.

4053
03:12:34,300 --> 03:12:35,300
It's the same dialogue.

4054
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:36,300
The dialogue hasn't changed.

4055
03:12:36,300 --> 03:12:39,300
Oh, she's selling her milkies.

4056
03:12:39,300 --> 03:12:42,300
I'm selling creamy nutritious llama milk.

4057
03:12:42,300 --> 03:12:43,300
It's Azura.

4058
03:12:43,300 --> 03:12:45,300
Don't buy, sorry, I'm not that rich.

4059
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:46,300
I'm a child.

4060
03:12:46,300 --> 03:12:47,300
Do you want a fuse?

4061
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:48,300
Yes, please.

4062
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:51,300
I don't have the freaking one you seek.

4063
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:53,300
What about you?

4064
03:12:54,300 --> 03:12:55,300
Yes, I do have what you seek.

4065
03:12:55,300 --> 03:12:57,300
Finally, one that I have.

4066
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:05,300
Oh, this is at the castle.

4067
03:13:10,300 --> 03:13:11,300
Goat milk, yeah.

4068
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:13,300
I remember when I teased Azura,

4069
03:13:13,300 --> 03:13:15,300
everyone was like, a cowgirl?

4070
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:17,300
I'm like, no, that's far too obvious.

4071
03:13:17,300 --> 03:13:19,300
What other thing produces milk?

4072
03:13:21,300 --> 03:13:22,300
Goat.

4073
03:13:22,300 --> 03:13:23,300
Um...

4074
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:26,300
I thought it was clever anyway.

4075
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:27,300
I thought it was good.

4076
03:13:28,300 --> 03:13:30,300
This one, yes, I want to fuse.

4077
03:13:30,300 --> 03:13:32,300
This is the time-gated one,

4078
03:13:32,300 --> 03:13:34,300
so we're going to do this right now,

4079
03:13:34,300 --> 03:13:37,300
so no one passes away due to my foolishness, okay?

4080
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:41,300
Mm.

4081
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:43,300
So this is right above our house,

4082
03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:45,300
we're going to go back to our house really quickly.

4083
03:13:45,300 --> 03:13:47,300
Goth boy, cleat at the castle.

4084
03:13:48,300 --> 03:13:50,300
Fusing stones with Malon.

4085
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:52,300
Mm.

4086
03:13:52,300 --> 03:13:54,300
Wait, is she actually called Malon?

4087
03:13:56,300 --> 03:13:59,300
Is that supposed to be because of her melons?

4088
03:13:59,300 --> 03:14:00,300
How's your name, Malon?

4089
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:05,300
Yeah, you can tell her names.

4090
03:14:06,300 --> 03:14:08,300
You know, I don't think I've ever tried goat milk before.

4091
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:12,300
If Azura didn't have an upset tummy,

4092
03:14:12,300 --> 03:14:14,300
I think it would be adorable

4093
03:14:14,300 --> 03:14:18,300
to get her to try all the different milk.

4094
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:21,300
But unfortunately, Azura has an upset tummy.

4095
03:14:24,300 --> 03:14:27,300
Okay, are you ready?

4096
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:32,300
You have to do this, or else you perish on a fire,

4097
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:35,300
and this poor gentleman passes away.

4098
03:14:36,300 --> 03:14:37,300
So, hi.

4099
03:14:37,300 --> 03:14:39,300
Goodness, we rarely get visitors.

4100
03:14:39,300 --> 03:14:42,300
Tell me, how did you get here via teleportation?

4101
03:14:44,300 --> 03:14:45,300
Are you okay?

4102
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:48,300
Nobody believes me, but I saw a ghost that's taken over Granda.

4103
03:14:48,300 --> 03:14:49,300
Yes.

4104
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:52,300
If you do not suck away the ghost,

4105
03:14:52,300 --> 03:14:54,300
he literally passes away.

4106
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:57,300
I can't believe old Greggal is sick.

4107
03:14:57,300 --> 03:14:58,300
He was looking so healthy,

4108
03:14:58,300 --> 03:15:00,300
I guess something just took a hold of him.

4109
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:04,300
Literally, if you do not do this.

4110
03:15:07,300 --> 03:15:09,300
Okay, now that thing's strong.

4111
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:14,300
Well, well, well, look at how the colours come back to his face.

4112
03:15:14,300 --> 03:15:16,300
How can I ever thank you?

4113
03:15:16,300 --> 03:15:19,300
I still have a hard time believing he'd been possessed by a monster, though.

4114
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:21,300
Well, I don't find it hard at all.

4115
03:15:21,300 --> 03:15:23,300
What, an evil spirit had taken a hold of me?

4116
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:25,300
And you drove it away?

4117
03:15:25,300 --> 03:15:26,300
You might be right.

4118
03:15:26,300 --> 03:15:28,300
I already feel my energy returning.

4119
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:30,300
I'll be able to get out of bed soon.

4120
03:15:30,300 --> 03:15:31,300
What's your name?

4121
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:32,300
Link.

4122
03:15:32,300 --> 03:15:33,300
Thank you, my boy.

4123
03:15:33,300 --> 03:15:34,300
You saved me.

4124
03:15:34,300 --> 03:15:35,300
I'm a hundred shell.

4125
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:37,300
If you do not do that,

4126
03:15:37,300 --> 03:15:40,300
before you unlock this area,

4127
03:15:40,300 --> 03:15:43,300
the non-teleportation way,

4128
03:15:43,300 --> 03:15:45,300
he is no longer in the game.

4129
03:15:46,300 --> 03:15:50,300
And you literally cause him to perish if you do not do that.

4130
03:15:51,300 --> 03:15:54,300
Now, all is good and we can go back to the main quest.

4131
03:15:55,300 --> 03:15:56,300
80% forehead.

4132
03:15:56,300 --> 03:15:58,300
But he's just an elder and he's smart.

4133
03:15:58,300 --> 03:16:00,300
Okay, where's he going to put all the knowledge and wisdom?

4134
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:03,300
Exactly.

4135
03:16:03,300 --> 03:16:05,300
So you didn't think that far ahead, did you?

4136
03:16:06,300 --> 03:16:08,300
Oh, I forgot to do the wee bird.

4137
03:16:09,300 --> 03:16:10,300
Hello.

4138
03:16:10,300 --> 03:16:11,300
Are you going to teach me something?

4139
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:12,300
A new sword.

4140
03:16:12,300 --> 03:16:13,300
Fantastic.

4141
03:16:13,300 --> 03:16:15,300
And you seem to have acquired new skills with it.

4142
03:16:15,300 --> 03:16:17,300
I'm going to train you again, young swordsman.

4143
03:16:17,300 --> 03:16:18,300
Will you accept?

4144
03:16:18,300 --> 03:16:20,300
Yes, we will.

4145
03:16:20,300 --> 03:16:23,300
I will now teach you a technique called the rock breaker.

4146
03:16:23,300 --> 03:16:24,300
So pay attention.

4147
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:27,300
First, swing your sword to break pots.

4148
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:30,300
Actually, that's all there is to it, young swordsman.

4149
03:16:30,300 --> 03:16:31,300
Do you understand?

4150
03:16:31,300 --> 03:16:32,300
Yes.

4151
03:16:33,300 --> 03:16:34,300
Yes, good.

4152
03:16:34,300 --> 03:16:39,300
If you had said you didn't understand, I would have serious doubts about you.

4153
03:16:39,300 --> 03:16:41,300
Yes, you must feel the technique.

4154
03:16:41,300 --> 03:16:45,300
But one must feel the technique, not just hear about it.

4155
03:16:45,300 --> 03:16:49,300
That's why I will now possess your body and do as to demonstrate the technique.

4156
03:16:49,300 --> 03:16:54,300
That is the secret of the swift blade possession technique of training.

4157
03:16:54,300 --> 03:16:55,300
Watch this.

4158
03:16:58,300 --> 03:16:59,300
Position.

4159
03:17:04,300 --> 03:17:05,300
Poof.

4160
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:07,300
Now you must try it for yourself.

4161
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:09,300
Break the pots with your sword.

4162
03:17:09,300 --> 03:17:10,300
That's all.

4163
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:12,300
Yes, fine work.

4164
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:13,300
Fantastic even.

4165
03:17:13,300 --> 03:17:15,300
I now give you the tiger scroll.

4166
03:17:15,300 --> 03:17:18,300
If you ever forget the technique, you can read it in the scroll.

4167
03:17:18,300 --> 03:17:20,300
Rock breaker fighting technique.

4168
03:17:20,300 --> 03:17:24,300
Shatter pots and pulverize boulders with a single blow.

4169
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:27,300
Is there anything else I can do?

4170
03:17:29,300 --> 03:17:32,300
Come again when you learn to run like the wind.

4171
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:33,300
Hmm.

4172
03:17:33,300 --> 03:17:34,300
I suppose.

4173
03:17:34,300 --> 03:17:36,300
Wait, how did I get to that chickadee?

4174
03:17:40,300 --> 03:17:41,300
I don't know.

4175
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:44,300
I actually don't know how to get into the shuffle though.

4176
03:17:45,300 --> 03:17:48,300
There's a singing thing.

4177
03:17:48,300 --> 03:17:50,300
I don't know what that's about.

4178
03:17:51,300 --> 03:17:56,300
I want to do this, but I don't think we're there yet.

4179
03:17:57,300 --> 03:17:58,300
Hello.

4180
03:17:58,300 --> 03:18:00,300
Bring whatever piece you'd like to shape.

4181
03:18:00,300 --> 03:18:02,300
You're like a simple amount of personal taste.

4182
03:18:02,300 --> 03:18:03,300
Goodle.

4183
03:18:03,300 --> 03:18:05,300
Oh, he wants to do it again.

4184
03:18:06,300 --> 03:18:07,300
Get again again.

4185
03:18:08,300 --> 03:18:10,300
Okay, I'll see, I'll see.

4186
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:18,300
Oh, unlock something in the room.

4187
03:18:21,300 --> 03:18:22,300
Hi, Jason, hi, Jason.

4188
03:18:23,300 --> 03:18:24,300
They fit perfectly.

4189
03:18:24,300 --> 03:18:27,300
Oh, I expect my sales will be tripled by this.

4190
03:18:29,300 --> 03:18:33,300
So did they, did they just go in order or what, they need it?

4191
03:18:36,300 --> 03:18:38,300
Oh, that's up north.

4192
03:18:40,300 --> 03:18:42,300
There might be life inside of that.

4193
03:18:42,300 --> 03:18:46,300
I think we'll go do that like right now because I think there's going to be an extra life in there.

4194
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:48,300
Like a heart container, pardon me.

4195
03:18:49,300 --> 03:18:52,300
I know, I'm sorry for people who want me to just do the main quest,

4196
03:18:52,300 --> 03:18:54,300
but that's the fun thing about the Zelda game,

4197
03:18:54,300 --> 03:18:56,300
is you get to do all this fun side stuff.

4198
03:19:02,300 --> 03:19:03,300
Oh, it's a fairy.

4199
03:19:03,300 --> 03:19:04,300
Sure.

4200
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:09,300
You found a fairy, a reliable ally to cleanse your health.

4201
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:11,300
If you trap a fairy in a jar.

4202
03:19:14,300 --> 03:19:16,300
Not like that, Riflin.

4203
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:19,300
Um, this wing friend will come to your aid.

4204
03:19:19,300 --> 03:19:22,300
Don't put the fairy in the jar for other reasons.

4205
03:19:22,300 --> 03:19:24,300
Do I make myself clear, Riflings?

4206
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:26,300
Good.

4207
03:19:28,300 --> 03:19:29,300
The fairies are so cute in this game.

4208
03:19:29,300 --> 03:19:32,300
Yes, this is a very cute pixel game.

4209
03:19:33,300 --> 03:19:36,300
Is there, so can I just keep like Kinstone into the same,

4210
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:38,300
I can, just over and over again.

4211
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:40,300
I guess it mustn't really matter.

4212
03:19:42,300 --> 03:19:43,300
Oh no, I can't do you.

4213
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:46,300
Is there anything here in here?

4214
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:49,300
A boomerang?

4215
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:53,300
Hello, how much is this?

4216
03:19:53,300 --> 03:19:54,300
300!

4217
03:19:56,300 --> 03:19:58,300
Oh, he's got a jar behind him.

4218
03:19:58,300 --> 03:20:00,300
Wait, how did I get here?

4219
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:04,300
He's got a jar, I need two jars.

4220
03:20:06,300 --> 03:20:08,300
Ah, sugar, I can't do it yet.

4221
03:20:08,300 --> 03:20:10,300
I must be after this one.

4222
03:20:11,300 --> 03:20:15,300
You're going to need a lot more zinc tomatoes and pineapples.

4223
03:20:18,300 --> 03:20:20,300
Remember to have tomatoes.

4224
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:26,300
This is good for you and your, your twins question mark.

4225
03:20:26,300 --> 03:20:28,300
Can I choose you because you're so cute.

4226
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:30,300
You're so adorable.

4227
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:33,300
What do you unlock, little trick-a-dee?

4228
03:20:34,300 --> 03:20:38,300
The other fountain in the, the...

4229
03:20:38,300 --> 03:20:40,300
Castello.

4230
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:45,300
You can push it, you've got to be big.

4231
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:48,300
No, I need a ring, it's like a special ring.

4232
03:20:48,300 --> 03:20:52,300
Bye-bye, I'm going to finish, I'm not like my brother so I'm going to look at it.

4233
03:20:52,300 --> 03:20:54,300
Okay, thank you.

4234
03:20:55,300 --> 03:20:57,300
Thank you very much.

4235
03:20:58,300 --> 03:21:00,300
Thank you very much.

4236
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:05,300
Uh...

4237
03:21:07,300 --> 03:21:11,300
That's what it is, I need the library to open up and put me on the book quest,

4238
03:21:11,300 --> 03:21:14,300
but that's not yet, it's after the swamp break.

4239
03:21:14,300 --> 03:21:18,300
We'll go pick up our shoes because I have been dilly-dallying enough.

4240
03:21:21,300 --> 03:21:22,300
Wakey-wakey.

4241
03:21:22,300 --> 03:21:25,300
If I recall correctly, and I guarantee that I do, my boy,

4242
03:21:25,300 --> 03:21:30,300
I think syrup said to stand in front of the sleeping person and press the right bumper.

4243
03:21:33,300 --> 03:21:35,300
It was literally just the interactive key.

4244
03:21:37,300 --> 03:21:40,300
What is that terrifyingly bad smell?

4245
03:21:40,300 --> 03:21:41,300
It's just me, sorry mate.

4246
03:21:41,300 --> 03:21:44,300
I wake up mushroom, I should have guessed, so you woke me up.

4247
03:21:44,300 --> 03:21:47,300
Thanks, I just remembered I have something urgent I need to do.

4248
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:50,300
Oh, what now?

4249
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:53,300
There are more new shoes, you probably won't believe this,

4250
03:21:53,300 --> 03:21:57,300
but I have a strange habit of making shoes in my sleep.

4251
03:21:57,300 --> 03:22:01,300
So you must have come here because you want some of my shoes, right? Tell me.

4252
03:22:01,300 --> 03:22:04,300
What, because you're so nice enough to wake me up, you can have them,

4253
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:07,300
hold on a second though, I just need the finishing touches.

4254
03:22:12,300 --> 03:22:14,300
And there we go, here, take these.

4255
03:22:14,300 --> 03:22:16,300
These are my special Pegasus boots.

4256
03:22:16,300 --> 03:22:20,300
They're so light, you'll feel like you're practically walking on air.

4257
03:22:20,300 --> 03:22:25,300
You got the Pegasus boots, hold the button to run faster than the wind.

4258
03:22:25,300 --> 03:22:28,300
Oh, I need to hurry up and get working on that special order,

4259
03:22:28,300 --> 03:22:31,300
the king asked me to make some shoes for Princess Del D.C.

4260
03:22:31,300 --> 03:22:33,300
Thanks for waking me up, come back if you ever need help,

4261
03:22:33,300 --> 03:22:35,300
or if you have any shoe problems.

4262
03:22:35,300 --> 03:22:38,300
Now we don't actually have any shoe problems.

4263
03:22:38,300 --> 03:22:41,300
But we're gonna go back to the swordsman,

4264
03:22:42,300 --> 03:22:45,300
because he will know teachers and new moves.

4265
03:22:45,300 --> 03:22:47,300
Got them Jordans on.

4266
03:22:48,300 --> 03:22:50,300
Ah yes, you have the Pegasus boots,

4267
03:22:50,300 --> 03:22:52,300
and you seem to have more skill too.

4268
03:22:52,300 --> 03:22:56,300
Yes, I am ready to train you again.

4269
03:22:57,300 --> 03:22:59,300
I got almost just one minute there, huh?

4270
03:22:59,300 --> 03:23:02,300
You will now learn a new technique called the dash attack.

4271
03:23:02,300 --> 03:23:05,300
First, equip the Pegasus boots, equip your sword,

4272
03:23:05,300 --> 03:23:08,300
third, run like crazy, that's all you need, do you understand?

4273
03:23:08,300 --> 03:23:09,300
Yes.

4274
03:23:09,300 --> 03:23:12,300
Yes, yes, you are my finest student.

4275
03:23:12,300 --> 03:23:14,300
Just equip the sword and the Pegasus boots,

4276
03:23:14,300 --> 03:23:17,300
and any button you like, but one must feel the technique,

4277
03:23:17,300 --> 03:23:19,300
not just feel about it,

4278
03:23:19,300 --> 03:23:22,300
that's why I will now possess your body to demonstrate it.

4279
03:23:22,300 --> 03:23:24,300
Watch this!

4280
03:23:24,300 --> 03:23:26,300
Position!

4281
03:23:28,300 --> 03:23:29,300
Bonk!

4282
03:23:30,300 --> 03:23:35,300
So now we can dash like crazy while having it out in front of us.

4283
03:23:35,300 --> 03:23:37,300
We don't have to do anything else.

4284
03:23:37,300 --> 03:23:40,300
Yes, fine work, you now take this tiger stroll.

4285
03:23:40,300 --> 03:23:43,300
If you ever forget, just reach the stroll.

4286
03:23:43,300 --> 03:23:44,300
We now know dash attack.

4287
03:23:44,300 --> 03:23:46,300
Run like the wind and attack.

4288
03:23:46,300 --> 03:23:50,300
Do you have anything more for me, or am I coming back?

4289
03:23:50,300 --> 03:23:53,300
Come again when you can jump further.

4290
03:23:54,300 --> 03:23:57,300
Got them jays on my feet.

4291
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:03,300
I'm sure there was something we could do.

4292
03:24:03,300 --> 03:24:05,300
But I forgot.

4293
03:24:07,300 --> 03:24:10,300
Out my way, out my way, ya bam.

4294
03:24:10,300 --> 03:24:14,300
Wasn't there a special fairy tree over here?

4295
03:24:14,300 --> 03:24:15,300
No?

4296
03:24:15,300 --> 03:24:18,300
Yes, I knew there was!

4297
03:24:18,300 --> 03:24:21,300
Whenever you see a tree sparkle, do that.

4298
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:27,300
And then become tiny, and then we can go explore.

4299
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:30,300
We're just so good at exploring.

4300
03:24:30,300 --> 03:24:33,300
Garfunkel, thank you for coming a member.

4301
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:35,300
You moved the rock for me, great.

4302
03:24:35,300 --> 03:24:37,300
I thought I'd never get outside.

4303
03:24:37,300 --> 03:24:39,300
Aw, poor little guy, we're stuck.

4304
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:41,300
Look at his wee decorations.

4305
03:24:41,300 --> 03:24:43,300
Got wee knick knacks over here,

4306
03:24:43,300 --> 03:24:45,300
his wee cutlery set,

4307
03:24:45,300 --> 03:24:47,300
all alone in my room.

4308
03:24:47,300 --> 03:24:48,300
I love what you've done with the place,

4309
03:24:48,300 --> 03:24:50,300
with a little rope on the wall.

4310
03:24:50,300 --> 03:24:52,300
What you're into is fine.

4311
03:24:52,300 --> 03:24:54,300
A little leaf like this stuff.

4312
03:24:54,300 --> 03:24:56,300
I just want to play a cute little pixel game like this,

4313
03:24:56,300 --> 03:24:59,300
and I don't know, maybe it's like making the townspeople happy.

4314
03:24:59,300 --> 03:25:02,300
You know what, I'm just going to straight up develop it.

4315
03:25:02,300 --> 03:25:06,300
I think I've said, um, not a,

4316
03:25:06,300 --> 03:25:11,300
kind of after a reveal or, um,

4317
03:25:11,300 --> 03:25:14,300
maybe going into fucking games.

4318
03:25:14,300 --> 03:25:17,300
It's a game published in, where like, I pay a studio

4319
03:25:17,300 --> 03:25:19,300
and make my game.

4320
03:25:19,300 --> 03:25:21,300
Maybe doing that, basically.

4321
03:25:21,300 --> 03:25:24,300
Um, but I'm happy to show the behind the scenes.

4322
03:25:24,300 --> 03:25:26,300
I mean, fuck me, I can never be quiet

4323
03:25:26,300 --> 03:25:28,300
whenever I've got a project going.

4324
03:25:28,300 --> 03:25:29,300
I'm like, and this is what I'm doing right now,

4325
03:25:29,300 --> 03:25:30,300
this is how I'm doing it, right?

4326
03:25:30,300 --> 03:25:32,300
You guys do this, this is how I do it.

4327
03:25:32,300 --> 03:25:34,300
Um, literally, I can't even keep my gob shot

4328
03:25:34,300 --> 03:25:37,300
when I've got something going for me.

4329
03:25:37,300 --> 03:25:40,300
Um, I'll just see how it goes.

4330
03:25:40,300 --> 03:25:42,300
I do have an idea.

4331
03:25:42,300 --> 03:25:44,300
I want to work with a studio,

4332
03:25:44,300 --> 03:25:46,300
but the problem is that you need to get, like,

4333
03:25:46,300 --> 03:25:48,300
fucking lawyers involved and everything.

4334
03:25:48,300 --> 03:25:50,300
I had to, I felt so bad.

4335
03:25:50,300 --> 03:25:52,300
So the VLR game, I feel really bad.

4336
03:25:52,300 --> 03:25:57,300
I had to get a fucking lawyer's piece of shit contract

4337
03:25:57,300 --> 03:25:59,300
because of the game.

4338
03:25:59,300 --> 03:26:03,300
Like, because obviously I had to pay for it to be produced.

4339
03:26:03,300 --> 03:26:05,300
It's not out yet for anyone that's like,

4340
03:26:05,300 --> 03:26:06,300
huh, how are you talking about the game?

4341
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:08,300
I'm not playing the game from VLR.

4342
03:26:08,300 --> 03:26:10,300
It's not out yet, it's not out yet.

4343
03:26:10,300 --> 03:26:12,300
It's been developed, we're in the last stages.

4344
03:26:12,300 --> 03:26:16,300
We're just waiting for the animation of the art to come through.

4345
03:26:16,300 --> 03:26:19,300
Um, which is taking a bit more of a,

4346
03:26:19,300 --> 03:26:22,300
um, it takes longer for that kind of side of production.

4347
03:26:22,300 --> 03:26:24,300
Um, but I've got a good deal.

4348
03:26:24,300 --> 03:26:26,300
Thanks to the developer I'm working with

4349
03:26:26,300 --> 03:26:29,300
because, uh, I cannot go that way.

4350
03:26:29,300 --> 03:26:31,300
Will it be on Steam?

4351
03:26:31,300 --> 03:26:33,300
No, it is an itch-y-o game.

4352
03:26:33,300 --> 03:26:35,300
It is wildly inappropriate for Steam.

4353
03:26:35,300 --> 03:26:37,300
Haha.

4354
03:26:37,300 --> 03:26:39,300
Ah, Sneaky's.

4355
03:26:39,300 --> 03:26:40,300
Go away.

4356
03:26:40,300 --> 03:26:41,300
Leave me alone.

4357
03:26:41,300 --> 03:26:43,300
Uh-uh-uh.

4358
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:45,300
I don't want to hear it.

4359
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:47,300
Where the heck did I go?

4360
03:26:47,300 --> 03:26:49,300
I don't know.

4361
03:26:49,300 --> 03:26:50,300
I will buy it.

4362
03:26:50,300 --> 03:26:53,300
Well, speaking of buying it, it's completely free.

4363
03:26:53,300 --> 03:26:55,300
You do not need to give me any money.

4364
03:26:55,300 --> 03:26:59,300
It was a developmental decision

4365
03:26:59,300 --> 03:27:01,300
in order to promote the girls,

4366
03:27:01,300 --> 03:27:04,300
and everyone can get a bit of a taste of the girls,

4367
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:05,300
if you will.

4368
03:27:05,300 --> 03:27:08,300
Um, I opted to make the game free.

4369
03:27:08,300 --> 03:27:10,300
You do not have to pay for it.

4370
03:27:10,300 --> 03:27:12,300
It cost a pretty penny to produce,

4371
03:27:12,300 --> 03:27:15,300
but that, ultimately, was my decision.

4372
03:27:15,300 --> 03:27:17,300
Um...

4373
03:27:19,300 --> 03:27:22,300
It's definitely a good learning experience.

4374
03:27:22,300 --> 03:27:24,300
Oh, it's bugging me, sorry.

4375
03:27:24,300 --> 03:27:27,300
Meekoo's big fan, thank you very much for the 10 gifted.

4376
03:27:27,300 --> 03:27:29,300
Congrats to who gets that.

4377
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:31,300
Yeah, it's definitely the girl.

4378
03:27:33,300 --> 03:27:35,300
Um...

4379
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:37,300
Hello?

4380
03:27:37,300 --> 03:27:39,300
I am just a child.

4381
03:27:39,300 --> 03:27:41,300
Leave me alone.

4382
03:27:41,300 --> 03:27:43,300
Hello?

4383
03:27:43,300 --> 03:27:44,300
I don't...

4384
03:27:44,300 --> 03:27:46,300
Okay, I can hit his back if he does that.

4385
03:27:46,300 --> 03:27:47,300
Right.

4386
03:27:47,300 --> 03:27:48,300
Oh my gosh.

4387
03:27:48,300 --> 03:27:50,300
What if we want to pay for it anyway?

4388
03:27:50,300 --> 03:27:53,300
Um, just support any of the girls then?

4389
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:55,300
Um...

4390
03:27:55,300 --> 03:27:57,300
The publisher can also be tipped

4391
03:27:57,300 --> 03:27:59,300
if you really like his work.

4392
03:27:59,300 --> 03:28:01,300
Um...

4393
03:28:01,300 --> 03:28:03,300
Oh, it's golden.

4394
03:28:03,300 --> 03:28:05,300
It's golden, why would it be golden?

4395
03:28:06,300 --> 03:28:08,300
Um, but yeah, it's free.

4396
03:28:08,300 --> 03:28:11,300
If you want to tip and be like, thanks for the game...

4397
03:28:11,300 --> 03:28:13,300
What if we want to pay for it anyway though?

4398
03:28:13,300 --> 03:28:14,300
Um...

4399
03:28:14,300 --> 03:28:16,300
If you ever felt so inclined, support any of the girls

4400
03:28:16,300 --> 03:28:18,300
or if you want to directly do it to me,

4401
03:28:18,300 --> 03:28:21,300
then do it to me, like on stream elements

4402
03:28:21,300 --> 03:28:23,300
is the best way to do it.

4403
03:28:23,300 --> 03:28:25,300
Or Patreon, to be honest.

4404
03:28:25,300 --> 03:28:27,300
Like, even if like...

4405
03:28:27,300 --> 03:28:29,300
Some people are like, oh, I feel really bad.

4406
03:28:29,300 --> 03:28:31,300
I've only got like five bucks to give.

4407
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:33,300
You don't, like...

4408
03:28:33,300 --> 03:28:34,300
What's the word?

4409
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:36,300
It's like such a cascade in effect.

4410
03:28:36,300 --> 03:28:38,300
I don't know where the heck...

4411
03:28:38,300 --> 03:28:39,300
I'm supposed to go.

4412
03:28:39,300 --> 03:28:41,300
I'm like rambling through the swamp section.

4413
03:28:41,300 --> 03:28:42,300
I'm so sorry.

4414
03:28:42,300 --> 03:28:43,300
Um...

4415
03:28:43,300 --> 03:28:46,300
Like, it adds up incredibly...

4416
03:28:46,300 --> 03:28:48,300
Oh, I'll take that, thank you very much.

4417
03:28:48,300 --> 03:28:50,300
Um, it adds up incredibly quickly.

4418
03:28:50,300 --> 03:28:52,300
Like, never be like, oh, I feel bad that I can't like,

4419
03:28:52,300 --> 03:28:54,300
give any money, I can't do this, I can't do that.

4420
03:28:54,300 --> 03:28:56,300
Like, don't ever feel like that because

4421
03:28:56,300 --> 03:28:58,300
the money like adds up so fricking...

4422
03:28:58,300 --> 03:29:00,300
Here's my pre-order in the game.

4423
03:29:00,300 --> 03:29:03,300
The game is free.

4424
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:05,300
You don't need to give any money.

4425
03:29:06,300 --> 03:29:09,300
Right, I've got a golden piece.

4426
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:11,300
Is it here, I'm supposed to go?

4427
03:29:11,300 --> 03:29:14,300
Oh, I'm getting all turned around now.

4428
03:29:16,300 --> 03:29:18,300
There's a cavern here.

4429
03:29:21,300 --> 03:29:22,300
Oh, how much do you want?

4430
03:29:22,300 --> 03:29:25,300
I want to sell you arrows, but you don't have a bow.

4431
03:29:27,300 --> 03:29:28,300
What was I saying again?

4432
03:29:28,300 --> 03:29:31,300
I've already forgotten my fricking subject!

4433
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:32,300
Right.

4434
03:29:33,300 --> 03:29:35,300
I don't think so, at least.

4435
03:29:36,300 --> 03:29:37,300
Um...

4436
03:29:38,300 --> 03:29:40,300
Bro, where am I supposed to go?

4437
03:29:41,300 --> 03:29:43,300
I'm going like, all the wrong ways.

4438
03:29:46,300 --> 03:29:49,300
I assume this is a dead end until I get yours.

4439
03:29:50,300 --> 03:29:52,300
Oh, I don't know how I've successfully gone the wrong way.

4440
03:29:52,300 --> 03:29:53,300
Like, eight times now?

4441
03:29:53,300 --> 03:29:55,300
I've already been here.

4442
03:29:55,300 --> 03:29:56,300
You know...

4443
03:29:58,300 --> 03:30:00,300
Did I come down here?

4444
03:30:00,300 --> 03:30:01,300
I did.

4445
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:03,300
Is there anything else here though?

4446
03:30:13,300 --> 03:30:14,300
I think I'm special needs.

4447
03:30:14,300 --> 03:30:15,300
Hold on.

4448
03:30:16,300 --> 03:30:18,300
Sorry, I need to try hard.

4449
03:30:18,300 --> 03:30:21,300
I don't know where I'm to go.

4450
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:29,300
I've got a keystone piece that was golden, right?

4451
03:30:30,300 --> 03:30:35,300
No, that is one nasty looking statue that I had evil glower to.

4452
03:30:38,300 --> 03:30:39,300
Hold on.

4453
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:43,300
Sorry, I'm genuinely unsure what to do.

4454
03:30:43,300 --> 03:30:45,300
I've already been down there.

4455
03:30:45,300 --> 03:30:48,300
I've already been here, and then this looks like a dead end,

4456
03:30:48,300 --> 03:30:51,300
but I don't go down it, so maybe this isn't a dead end,

4457
03:30:51,300 --> 03:30:53,300
and I'm just the top of the damn thing?

4458
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:57,300
So it is a dead end.

4459
03:30:58,300 --> 03:30:59,300
Hold on.

4460
03:30:59,300 --> 03:31:00,300
Processing.

4461
03:31:00,300 --> 03:31:01,300
What?

4462
03:31:01,300 --> 03:31:04,300
It says get a bow, but I didn't have a bow.

4463
03:31:07,300 --> 03:31:09,300
The wee mushroom guy.

4464
03:31:09,300 --> 03:31:10,300
The business scrub.

4465
03:31:11,300 --> 03:31:13,300
Which is me, by the way.

4466
03:31:13,300 --> 03:31:15,300
Oh, idiot features!

4467
03:31:15,300 --> 03:31:18,300
Pegasus boots to get me across here.

4468
03:31:20,300 --> 03:31:22,300
Oh, not the water though, Link.

4469
03:31:22,300 --> 03:31:23,300
Not the water though.

4470
03:31:24,300 --> 03:31:26,300
Yeah, sorry, that...

4471
03:31:26,300 --> 03:31:28,300
That must have been painfully obvious.

4472
03:31:28,300 --> 03:31:29,300
I do apologise.

4473
03:31:29,300 --> 03:31:31,300
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

4474
03:31:31,300 --> 03:31:33,300
Go across the swamp water.

4475
03:31:34,300 --> 03:31:35,300
Okay, what is this?

4476
03:31:35,300 --> 03:31:37,300
Ah, we're working this before.

4477
03:31:37,300 --> 03:31:38,300
Sorry.

4478
03:31:42,300 --> 03:31:44,300
Oh, look at the flowers.

4479
03:31:45,300 --> 03:31:46,300
What's beautiful.

4480
03:31:46,300 --> 03:31:47,300
Um...

4481
03:31:49,300 --> 03:31:53,300
Yes, I made the decision to make the game free for promotional reasons.

4482
03:31:56,300 --> 03:31:57,300
The game is not out.

4483
03:31:57,300 --> 03:31:58,300
Thank you for the money.

4484
03:31:58,300 --> 03:31:59,300
The game is not out.

4485
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:01,300
I do apologise, the lay lover,

4486
03:32:01,300 --> 03:32:02,300
but thank you for the money.

4487
03:32:07,300 --> 03:32:08,300
I'm getting spanked about.

4488
03:32:12,300 --> 03:32:13,300
I'm spamming, I'm spamming.

4489
03:32:14,300 --> 03:32:16,300
Oh my god, is this a bow and arrow?

4490
03:32:18,300 --> 03:32:19,300
Oh, thank god, we've got a bow.

4491
03:32:19,300 --> 03:32:20,300
Right, we've got a bow.

4492
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:22,300
The game...

4493
03:32:23,300 --> 03:32:26,300
It will be tweeted about from all the girls' accounts

4494
03:32:26,300 --> 03:32:28,300
and all of that jazz, so don't worry.

4495
03:32:28,300 --> 03:32:30,300
You'll know when it comes out.

4496
03:32:30,300 --> 03:32:31,300
It's still in development,

4497
03:32:31,300 --> 03:32:33,300
but the base is there.

4498
03:32:35,300 --> 03:32:37,300
Waiting on animated artwork to come back.

4499
03:32:37,300 --> 03:32:39,300
And then I just need to hand over the audio.

4500
03:32:41,300 --> 03:32:43,300
I need to break all the audios down.

4501
03:32:46,300 --> 03:32:48,300
But it makes the game cheaper if I do the work, so...

4502
03:32:49,300 --> 03:32:51,300
I'm not going to outsource the work,

4503
03:32:51,300 --> 03:32:52,300
but thank you again for the tip.

4504
03:32:54,300 --> 03:32:57,300
The name of it is a pun.

4505
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:59,300
Is anyone surprised at this point?

4506
03:32:59,300 --> 03:33:00,300
The answer is...

4507
03:33:01,300 --> 03:33:03,300
Okay, let's go back this way.

4508
03:33:07,300 --> 03:33:09,300
Okay, okay, now that we have the bow,

4509
03:33:09,300 --> 03:33:11,300
we can poke them in the eyes.

4510
03:33:12,300 --> 03:33:13,300
Oh, that wasn't very nice.

4511
03:33:13,300 --> 03:33:15,300
I'm going to have to admit that wasn't quite mean.

4512
03:33:18,300 --> 03:33:20,300
Let's outsource the audio.

4513
03:33:20,300 --> 03:33:21,300
No, it's like more money.

4514
03:33:21,300 --> 03:33:23,300
I spent a lot of money on the game

4515
03:33:23,300 --> 03:33:25,300
to get it produced.

4516
03:33:26,300 --> 03:33:27,300
I think...

4517
03:33:27,300 --> 03:33:28,300
Oh, I don't know.

4518
03:33:28,300 --> 03:33:30,300
Should I say it out loud?

4519
03:33:34,300 --> 03:33:36,300
It's over 10,000 US dollars.

4520
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:37,300
How about that?

4521
03:33:37,300 --> 03:33:38,300
It took me 10,000.

4522
03:33:38,300 --> 03:33:40,300
And I know someone's going to play

4523
03:33:40,300 --> 03:33:41,300
and be like,

4524
03:33:41,300 --> 03:33:42,300
this game's shit.

4525
03:33:42,300 --> 03:33:43,300
I can't believe you paid that much money for it.

4526
03:33:43,300 --> 03:33:44,300
And it's like, bro,

4527
03:33:44,300 --> 03:33:46,300
I'm going to just fucking relax.

4528
03:33:46,300 --> 03:33:47,300
Oh, yeah.

4529
03:33:49,300 --> 03:33:51,300
Game development isn't cheap.

4530
03:33:51,300 --> 03:33:52,300
It isn't easy.

4531
03:33:52,300 --> 03:33:53,300
It isn't fast.

4532
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:54,300
It isn't this.

4533
03:33:54,300 --> 03:33:55,300
It isn't that.

4534
03:33:55,300 --> 03:33:56,300
What the heck is this?

4535
03:33:56,300 --> 03:33:57,300
Hello, Mr. Gravestone.

4536
03:34:03,300 --> 03:34:04,300
Two more.

4537
03:34:04,300 --> 03:34:05,300
10K.

4538
03:34:05,300 --> 03:34:06,300
Oh, it's a bit more than that,

4539
03:34:06,300 --> 03:34:08,300
but I'll say it's 10K.

4540
03:34:08,300 --> 03:34:10,300
Though my body may have perished.

4541
03:34:10,300 --> 03:34:13,300
Strongly be voicing by Chris Pratt.

4542
03:34:13,300 --> 03:34:14,300
No.

4543
03:34:14,300 --> 03:34:15,300
Someone was like,

4544
03:34:15,300 --> 03:34:17,300
I don't have a male voice in the game.

4545
03:34:17,300 --> 03:34:18,300
I was like,

4546
03:34:18,300 --> 03:34:20,300
why on earth would the male voice be in the game

4547
03:34:20,300 --> 03:34:22,300
if the entire point of the game is to

4548
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:24,300
be allure?

4549
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:27,300
Why would there randomly be a male voice?

4550
03:34:27,300 --> 03:34:29,300
Moment is too generous.

4551
03:34:29,300 --> 03:34:31,300
Though my body may perish,

4552
03:34:31,300 --> 03:34:33,300
I'm still a true swordsman of Hyrule.

4553
03:34:33,300 --> 03:34:35,300
Swiftblade, the first spirit of a swordsman.

4554
03:34:35,300 --> 03:34:36,300
If you train with me,

4555
03:34:36,300 --> 03:34:37,300
I will teach you skills that,

4556
03:34:37,300 --> 03:34:39,300
hmm, it seems you're not ready to train with me.

4557
03:34:39,300 --> 03:34:40,300
Come back when you have...

4558
03:34:43,300 --> 03:34:44,300
I'll come all this way in a swamp.

4559
03:34:45,300 --> 03:34:46,300
And you're telling...

4560
03:34:46,300 --> 03:34:47,300
Okay, I'm not that mad,

4561
03:34:47,300 --> 03:34:49,300
because there was a Kinstone piece outside the Gravestone.

4562
03:34:49,300 --> 03:34:51,300
I'll let it slide this time.

4563
03:34:55,300 --> 03:34:56,300
Bitches.

4564
03:34:58,300 --> 03:34:59,300
I already know

4565
03:35:01,300 --> 03:35:02,300
what game

4566
03:35:02,300 --> 03:35:04,300
I want to produce

4567
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:06,300
for Gen 2.

4568
03:35:06,300 --> 03:35:08,300
Every generation is going to have a free

4569
03:35:08,300 --> 03:35:11,300
access kind of game.

4570
03:35:11,300 --> 03:35:13,300
And I already know what

4571
03:35:13,300 --> 03:35:15,300
the...

4572
03:35:15,300 --> 03:35:17,300
I'm drowning.

4573
03:35:17,300 --> 03:35:19,300
I'm drowning again.

4574
03:35:19,300 --> 03:35:21,300
I already know what the other game types

4575
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:22,300
are going to be.

4576
03:35:22,300 --> 03:35:24,300
I hope people find it humorous,

4577
03:35:24,300 --> 03:35:27,300
because it's kind of a parody of...

4578
03:35:30,300 --> 03:35:32,300
Oh, that's what the golden...

4579
03:35:32,300 --> 03:35:33,300
Oh, we need to go back.

4580
03:35:33,300 --> 03:35:34,300
We need to go back.

4581
03:35:34,300 --> 03:35:35,300
We've gone too far.

4582
03:35:35,300 --> 03:35:36,300
We need to go back.

4583
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:39,300
Wait, so there's going to be voice acting?

4584
03:35:39,300 --> 03:35:40,300
Yeah, by us.

4585
03:35:40,300 --> 03:35:41,300
By all the viewers,

4586
03:35:41,300 --> 03:35:43,300
the girls have already recorded their lines.

4587
03:35:44,300 --> 03:35:46,300
Now, I will say one thing.

4588
03:35:47,300 --> 03:35:49,300
The lines were very important

4589
03:35:49,300 --> 03:35:51,300
to be recorded first.

4590
03:35:51,300 --> 03:35:53,300
So, before you're like,

4591
03:35:53,300 --> 03:35:55,300
this person doesn't sound that confident.

4592
03:35:55,300 --> 03:35:57,300
Yeah, probably because it was very early

4593
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:59,300
into knowing each other.

4594
03:35:59,300 --> 03:36:00,300
And I sent them the script,

4595
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:03,300
and some of them have good experience.

4596
03:36:03,300 --> 03:36:05,300
Some of them are kind of new to it,

4597
03:36:05,300 --> 03:36:07,300
but are aware of the...

4598
03:36:07,300 --> 03:36:09,300
I'll push that down.

4599
03:36:12,300 --> 03:36:14,300
Does he come after me?

4600
03:36:14,300 --> 03:36:15,300
I don't know.

4601
03:36:16,300 --> 03:36:18,300
Is it an FPS stereo?

4602
03:36:18,300 --> 03:36:19,300
No.

4603
03:36:19,300 --> 03:36:21,300
It's not like a full, developed AAA title.

4604
03:36:21,300 --> 03:36:23,300
It's literally to play one-handed.

4605
03:36:23,300 --> 03:36:24,300
There's not much more to it.

4606
03:36:24,300 --> 03:36:26,300
Where am I supposed to go?

4607
03:36:26,300 --> 03:36:28,300
Am I supposed to go down?

4608
03:36:28,300 --> 03:36:30,300
No, I'm supposed to go over here.

4609
03:36:31,300 --> 03:36:32,300
Overwatch 3.

4610
03:36:32,300 --> 03:36:34,300
No, I did not produce Overwatch 3.

4611
03:36:34,300 --> 03:36:36,300
Literally, it's just a one-handed game,

4612
03:36:36,300 --> 03:36:38,300
but games are not easy to produce.

4613
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:40,300
Easy or cheap to produce.

4614
03:36:40,300 --> 03:36:42,300
And I still need to pay the artist.

4615
03:36:42,300 --> 03:36:44,300
I forgot to pay the artist.

4616
03:36:44,300 --> 03:36:46,300
Is it other 50%?

4617
03:36:46,300 --> 03:36:48,300
Oh, right, we just need one more piece now.

4618
03:36:48,300 --> 03:36:50,300
That's fantastic.

4619
03:36:54,300 --> 03:36:56,300
We can go back up here.

4620
03:36:56,300 --> 03:36:58,300
Then we need to claim up.

4621
03:37:02,300 --> 03:37:04,300
If Blizzard had any sense,

4622
03:37:04,300 --> 03:37:06,300
Overwatch 3 would be a one-handed game too.

4623
03:37:06,300 --> 03:37:08,300
No, that's so good.

4624
03:37:08,300 --> 03:37:10,300
That's terrible, but that's not good.

4625
03:37:21,300 --> 03:37:23,300
Let's do this.

4626
03:37:23,300 --> 03:37:25,300
Okay, the Pegasus.

4627
03:37:25,300 --> 03:37:27,300
Probably see there's only one thing about this game

4628
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:29,300
is we have to constantly go in the menus.

4629
03:37:29,300 --> 03:37:31,300
I need to push this down, actually.

4630
03:37:35,300 --> 03:37:37,300
Question mark, we did it.

4631
03:37:38,300 --> 03:37:39,300
Yes!

4632
03:37:39,300 --> 03:37:41,300
Okay, we can go straight back again.

4633
03:37:41,300 --> 03:37:44,300
And we don't need arrows from that guy,

4634
03:37:44,300 --> 03:37:46,300
because we're already full.

4635
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:48,300
Yes, the Overwatch industry

4636
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:50,300
is probably bigger than the playable...

4637
03:37:50,300 --> 03:37:52,300
Oh, I do not doubt it.

4638
03:37:52,300 --> 03:37:56,300
I'm sorry, they absolutely ran that game to the ground.

4639
03:37:56,300 --> 03:37:58,300
I'm like, hope it was worth it.

4640
03:37:58,300 --> 03:38:00,300
I genuinely hope it was worth it.

4641
03:38:00,300 --> 03:38:02,300
Although it's saying that...

4642
03:38:02,300 --> 03:38:04,300
What's that game?

4643
03:38:04,300 --> 03:38:06,300
Valorant?

4644
03:38:06,300 --> 03:38:08,300
All they do is sell...

4645
03:38:08,300 --> 03:38:10,300
It's a free-to-play,

4646
03:38:10,300 --> 03:38:12,300
but all they do is that skin stuff as well.

4647
03:38:12,300 --> 03:38:14,300
And they've found pretty good success,

4648
03:38:14,300 --> 03:38:16,300
so...

4649
03:38:16,300 --> 03:38:18,300
Maybe...

4650
03:38:18,300 --> 03:38:20,300
Is that what I should do?

4651
03:38:20,300 --> 03:38:22,300
I should put skins behind a paywall.

4652
03:38:22,300 --> 03:38:23,300
That's ridiculous.

4653
03:38:23,300 --> 03:38:25,300
Then what's behind here?

4654
03:38:27,300 --> 03:38:29,300
That noise.

4655
03:38:29,300 --> 03:38:32,300
Wait, don't he coax them to me?

4656
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:34,300
Okay, now come this way.

4657
03:38:37,300 --> 03:38:40,300
He does look awfully venison.

4658
03:38:43,300 --> 03:38:45,300
Oh, it's just for a chest.

4659
03:38:45,300 --> 03:38:47,300
Oh, okay, it's blue.

4660
03:38:47,300 --> 03:38:48,300
Oh!

4661
03:38:50,300 --> 03:38:52,300
I'm too skilled.

4662
03:38:55,300 --> 03:38:57,300
I didn't trust that when they popped off.

4663
03:38:57,300 --> 03:39:00,300
I was like, they did not come out of the grass.

4664
03:39:00,300 --> 03:39:02,300
I knew they didn't come out of the grass.

4665
03:39:02,300 --> 03:39:05,300
Probably because Valorant was sold as a PvP.

4666
03:39:06,300 --> 03:39:08,300
So it didn't have hint for the camp.

4667
03:39:08,300 --> 03:39:10,300
Wait, you're still in my way?

4668
03:39:11,300 --> 03:39:13,300
Oh my god, stop for real, for real.

4669
03:39:14,300 --> 03:39:16,300
Can't go that way, which is...

4670
03:39:16,300 --> 03:39:18,300
Fane.

4671
03:39:18,300 --> 03:39:20,300
I've already forgotten how to get...

4672
03:39:20,300 --> 03:39:22,300
I think I need to go up again,

4673
03:39:22,300 --> 03:39:25,300
and then do that swamp route in order to get where I need to go?

4674
03:39:27,300 --> 03:39:30,300
Yes, I do need to do the swamp route, which is fine.

4675
03:39:36,300 --> 03:39:38,300
Huh?

4676
03:39:38,300 --> 03:39:39,300
I don't know.

4677
03:39:39,300 --> 03:39:40,300
I forgot.

4678
03:39:40,300 --> 03:39:41,300
Wait, how did I get up there?

4679
03:39:41,300 --> 03:39:42,300
Ah, okay, okay.

4680
03:39:42,300 --> 03:39:44,300
Stab them in the eye.

4681
03:39:44,300 --> 03:39:46,300
Yeah, honestly, I'd be pretty enraged, too,

4682
03:39:46,300 --> 03:39:47,300
if that happened to me.

4683
03:39:47,300 --> 03:39:48,300
I'd be mad.

4684
03:39:52,300 --> 03:39:54,300
Can I get any cannons?

4685
03:39:54,300 --> 03:39:55,300
Please.

4686
03:39:55,300 --> 03:39:57,300
This one, please.

4687
03:39:59,300 --> 03:40:01,300
Thanks for joining.

4688
03:40:01,300 --> 03:40:04,300
I say that as if I'm not about to go off in 20 minutes,

4689
03:40:04,300 --> 03:40:07,300
because I need to do my forbidden tier stream.

4690
03:40:07,300 --> 03:40:11,300
Whoa, I made that by a centimeter.

4691
03:40:12,300 --> 03:40:13,300
By a millimeter.

4692
03:40:13,300 --> 03:40:16,300
Wait, no, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.

4693
03:40:16,300 --> 03:40:18,300
But it's near here.

4694
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:20,300
I just need to get done.

4695
03:40:21,300 --> 03:40:23,300
Okay, okay, we did it, we did it.

4696
03:40:26,300 --> 03:40:29,300
Two Kenstone pieces fit perfectly together.

4697
03:40:31,300 --> 03:40:32,300
Bunk.

4698
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:36,300
And they're last, but certainly not least.

4699
03:40:37,300 --> 03:40:39,300
Don't forget to eat a set of me.

4700
03:40:39,300 --> 03:40:41,300
I absolutely will not forget.

4701
03:40:41,300 --> 03:40:44,300
I actually need to get the thumbnail to put up the member stream.

4702
03:40:44,300 --> 03:40:46,300
I'll put it 15 minutes past,

4703
03:40:46,300 --> 03:40:49,300
because I might need to squeeze out a loaf of bread.

4704
03:40:49,300 --> 03:40:54,300
I think the painkillers are making my loaf of bread

4705
03:40:54,300 --> 03:40:56,300
severely impacted.

4706
03:40:56,300 --> 03:40:58,300
That's terrible.

4707
03:40:59,300 --> 03:41:01,300
And a couple more hours of member stream.

4708
03:41:01,300 --> 03:41:02,300
No.

4709
03:41:03,300 --> 03:41:06,300
I'm going to redirect into Emmy when she goes up,

4710
03:41:06,300 --> 03:41:08,300
and then 15 minutes later, the member stream will be there.

4711
03:41:08,300 --> 03:41:10,300
Like, I'll put it up, don't worry.

4712
03:41:10,300 --> 03:41:12,300
The heck with you.

4713
03:41:14,300 --> 03:41:15,300
Ooh.

4714
03:41:16,300 --> 03:41:18,300
Oh, I don't like you.

4715
03:41:18,300 --> 03:41:19,300
Oh, I can perish you though.

4716
03:41:19,300 --> 03:41:20,300
That's fine.

4717
03:41:20,300 --> 03:41:21,300
Okay.

4718
03:41:21,300 --> 03:41:22,300
Yeah, just stay stuck on that.

4719
03:41:22,300 --> 03:41:23,300
That's fine.

4720
03:41:23,300 --> 03:41:24,300
You don't scare me.

4721
03:41:25,300 --> 03:41:29,300
Is the tier list at the same time as Emmy?

4722
03:41:29,300 --> 03:41:31,300
Yes, but it'll stay up.

4723
03:41:31,300 --> 03:41:33,300
Whoa, what was that enemy?

4724
03:41:33,300 --> 03:41:34,300
I saw that.

4725
03:41:35,300 --> 03:41:36,300
I saw that.

4726
03:41:37,300 --> 03:41:38,300
We'll grab it.

4727
03:41:38,300 --> 03:41:39,300
We'll grab it.

4728
03:41:39,300 --> 03:41:42,300
We need all the moonies and...

4729
03:41:48,300 --> 03:41:49,300
Ah, perfect.

4730
03:41:49,300 --> 03:41:50,300
We got a red one.

4731
03:41:50,300 --> 03:41:51,300
Hello.

4732
03:41:51,300 --> 03:41:54,300
These soldier statues here were built by the Minish ages ago

4733
03:41:54,300 --> 03:41:55,300
to help humans.

4734
03:41:55,300 --> 03:41:56,300
It's kind of a secret,

4735
03:41:56,300 --> 03:41:59,300
but there's a switch inside that turns them on or off.

4736
03:41:59,300 --> 03:42:01,300
A switch, you say?

4737
03:42:01,300 --> 03:42:03,300
Conditioning, you say?

4738
03:42:03,300 --> 03:42:04,300
So nice.

4739
03:42:07,300 --> 03:42:08,300
I was going to say,

4740
03:42:08,300 --> 03:42:10,300
I'm sure you can climb these guys.

4741
03:42:10,300 --> 03:42:12,300
Right, now that he's activated,

4742
03:42:12,300 --> 03:42:15,300
he will wake up and you just stole his stuff.

4743
03:42:15,300 --> 03:42:16,300
Literally, hi!

4744
03:42:16,300 --> 03:42:18,300
Opens chest first, doesn't even greet him.

4745
03:42:22,300 --> 03:42:25,300
Oh, he actually bounces me back.

4746
03:42:25,300 --> 03:42:27,300
He's that much of a talent.

4747
03:42:27,300 --> 03:42:28,300
Honestly.

4748
03:42:29,300 --> 03:42:31,300
I see that thing.

4749
03:42:32,300 --> 03:42:33,300
I see it.

4750
03:42:35,300 --> 03:42:37,300
I actually don't think we're going to have enough time

4751
03:42:37,300 --> 03:42:39,300
to do the freaking dungeon.

4752
03:42:42,300 --> 03:42:44,300
What's Emmy doing today?

4753
03:42:47,300 --> 03:42:50,300
Be honest, what game's Emmy playing?

4754
03:42:51,300 --> 03:42:53,300
Is she doing a two-hour stream?

4755
03:42:53,300 --> 03:42:55,300
Or is she doing ASMR?

4756
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:02,300
Do you want me to do the member stream

4757
03:43:02,300 --> 03:43:04,300
two hours after Emmy starts?

4758
03:43:04,300 --> 03:43:06,300
Because Azur is off

4759
03:43:06,300 --> 03:43:08,300
and Mercy's off.

4760
03:43:08,300 --> 03:43:10,300
And I don't think Emmy would do ASMR

4761
03:43:10,300 --> 03:43:12,300
more than two hours because it gets a bit

4762
03:43:12,300 --> 03:43:14,300
really sore in the voice after two hours.

4763
03:43:14,300 --> 03:43:17,300
Brainwashing ASMR, yeah, it's my Emmy.

4764
03:43:17,300 --> 03:43:19,300
Shibuya's at eight.

4765
03:43:19,300 --> 03:43:21,300
Wait, I thought Shibuya was off.

4766
03:43:21,300 --> 03:43:22,300
Wait.

4767
03:43:24,300 --> 03:43:27,300
Oh, is Sheepster's a bit later?

4768
03:43:31,300 --> 03:43:33,300
As much as I would love to watch the member stream,

4769
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:35,300
I want to watch Emmy.

4770
03:43:38,300 --> 03:43:40,300
If that's the case,

4771
03:43:42,300 --> 03:43:44,300
I can play this game for another two hours

4772
03:43:44,300 --> 03:43:46,300
and then whoever wants to watch Emmy

4773
03:43:46,300 --> 03:43:48,300
can go watch Emmy.

4774
03:43:50,300 --> 03:43:53,300
I don't know, this game is nasty looking.

4775
03:43:54,300 --> 03:43:55,300
We are so back.

4776
03:43:55,300 --> 03:43:56,300
What a name!

4777
03:43:56,300 --> 03:43:58,300
Oh my god, your icons!

4778
03:43:58,300 --> 03:44:00,300
We ace the call.

4779
03:44:00,300 --> 03:44:01,300
That's so precious.

4780
03:44:01,300 --> 03:44:03,300
I love when you guys have like

4781
03:44:03,300 --> 03:44:05,300
the girls'...

4782
03:44:05,300 --> 03:44:07,300
Let's get rid of the snakes first

4783
03:44:07,300 --> 03:44:09,300
because they are scary.

4784
03:44:09,300 --> 03:44:11,300
I love when you guys have the girls'

4785
03:44:11,300 --> 03:44:13,300
oh-she-marks or like their profile pictures

4786
03:44:13,300 --> 03:44:15,300
them or their name is there.

4787
03:44:15,300 --> 03:44:17,300
I'm just like, oh, my bye-bye.

4788
03:44:17,300 --> 03:44:19,300
I'm so glad you guys can enjoy it.

4789
03:44:19,300 --> 03:44:21,300
Draco, thank you for coming.

4790
03:44:21,300 --> 03:44:22,300
Remember?

4791
03:44:22,300 --> 03:44:24,300
Oh, I'm glad I caught that grass.

4792
03:44:24,300 --> 03:44:25,300
I didn't realize.

4793
03:44:25,300 --> 03:44:27,300
I thought it was going to restart.

4794
03:44:28,300 --> 03:44:30,300
I heart you very much.

4795
03:44:30,300 --> 03:44:31,300
Yes.

4796
03:44:32,300 --> 03:44:34,300
It was concepted that A.C.

4797
03:44:34,300 --> 03:44:36,300
So I've...

4798
03:44:36,300 --> 03:44:37,300
I haven't said it.

4799
03:44:37,300 --> 03:44:39,300
Obviously only the development team

4800
03:44:39,300 --> 03:44:40,300
could see the designs.

4801
03:44:40,300 --> 03:44:42,300
And A.C. by far was voted

4802
03:44:42,300 --> 03:44:45,300
the most well-liked

4803
03:44:45,300 --> 03:44:47,300
designer...

4804
03:44:47,300 --> 03:44:48,300
whatever...

4805
03:44:48,300 --> 03:44:49,300
whatever.

4806
03:44:51,300 --> 03:44:53,300
So...

4807
03:44:53,300 --> 03:44:55,300
we popped her

4808
03:44:55,300 --> 03:44:57,300
in my

4809
03:44:57,300 --> 03:44:59,300
lore video

4810
03:44:59,300 --> 03:45:01,300
and it was a cute little kind of like cameo.

4811
03:45:01,300 --> 03:45:03,300
I can even call it a cameo.

4812
03:45:04,300 --> 03:45:05,300
She would just...

4813
03:45:05,300 --> 03:45:06,300
she's the muse

4814
03:45:06,300 --> 03:45:08,300
because obviously my lore

4815
03:45:08,300 --> 03:45:10,300
was people had already

4816
03:45:10,300 --> 03:45:13,300
hypnotized themselves

4817
03:45:14,300 --> 03:45:15,300
to

4818
03:45:17,300 --> 03:45:19,300
be watching VTubers,

4819
03:45:19,300 --> 03:45:21,300
which was a quite like the...

4820
03:45:21,300 --> 03:45:23,300
the charisma

4821
03:45:23,300 --> 03:45:25,300
of the charisma.

4822
03:45:26,300 --> 03:45:28,300
We just turned everyone off.

4823
03:45:28,300 --> 03:45:29,300
It's that easy.

4824
03:45:30,300 --> 03:45:32,300
I think that A.C.

4825
03:45:32,300 --> 03:45:34,300
smart in gameplay capture

4826
03:45:34,300 --> 03:45:36,300
to different audiences.

4827
03:45:36,300 --> 03:45:37,300
Yes.

4828
03:45:37,300 --> 03:45:38,300
If you...

4829
03:45:38,300 --> 03:45:40,300
if you want to watch Immers,

4830
03:45:40,300 --> 03:45:41,300
my little Immers...

4831
03:45:42,300 --> 03:45:43,300
Wait a minute.

4832
03:45:45,300 --> 03:45:47,300
Wait, a diddly dying minute.

4833
03:45:49,300 --> 03:45:51,300
I think I need to perish those guys.

4834
03:45:51,300 --> 03:45:52,300
I don't know.

4835
03:45:52,300 --> 03:45:54,300
Maybe another time right now.

4836
03:45:54,300 --> 03:45:55,300
Let's just get there.

4837
03:45:57,300 --> 03:45:58,300
The Conqueror?

4838
03:45:58,300 --> 03:46:00,300
A.C. having a rough day?

4839
03:46:00,300 --> 03:46:01,300
Is she alright?

4840
03:46:03,300 --> 03:46:06,300
Oh, I can destroy these with my sword now.

4841
03:46:07,300 --> 03:46:09,300
Sorry, I'll just do some edging

4842
03:46:09,300 --> 03:46:11,300
on the grass.

4843
03:46:11,300 --> 03:46:12,300
If you didn't know that

4844
03:46:12,300 --> 03:46:13,300
is actually the terminology,

4845
03:46:13,300 --> 03:46:14,300
cheeky edging.

4846
03:46:14,300 --> 03:46:16,300
Wait, who...

4847
03:46:18,300 --> 03:46:19,300
Oh, I do have to defeat

4848
03:46:19,300 --> 03:46:21,300
the other guys right there.

4849
03:46:21,300 --> 03:46:22,300
Did I do it?

4850
03:46:22,300 --> 03:46:24,300
Am I going to come back to this area?

4851
03:46:24,300 --> 03:46:25,300
Probably not.

4852
03:46:26,300 --> 03:46:27,300
It is called A.C.I.N.

4853
03:46:27,300 --> 03:46:28,300
If you're a gardener,

4854
03:46:28,300 --> 03:46:29,300
it's called A.C.I.N.

4855
03:46:29,300 --> 03:46:30,300
That's called A.C.I.N.

4856
03:46:31,300 --> 03:46:32,300
Just a little...

4857
03:46:32,300 --> 03:46:33,300
no, literally like on the...

4858
03:46:33,300 --> 03:46:35,300
fortress of wind.

4859
03:46:36,300 --> 03:46:37,300
What is all...

4860
03:46:37,300 --> 03:46:39,300
Well, there's so many rooms

4861
03:46:39,300 --> 03:46:40,300
you can explore.

4862
03:46:42,300 --> 03:46:44,300
Okay, do not touch that.

4863
03:46:44,300 --> 03:46:45,300
Let's not do that again.

4864
03:46:47,300 --> 03:46:48,300
Hmm.

4865
03:46:48,300 --> 03:46:49,300
To think the rooms were hidden

4866
03:46:49,300 --> 03:46:51,300
within this cliff the whole time.

4867
03:46:51,300 --> 03:46:52,300
Watch your step, Link.

4868
03:46:52,300 --> 03:46:54,300
There may be traps in here.

4869
03:46:54,300 --> 03:46:55,300
Hmm.

4870
03:46:57,300 --> 03:46:58,300
Well, there might be traps here,

4871
03:46:58,300 --> 03:46:59,300
but what about the Fen Boys?

4872
03:46:59,300 --> 03:47:00,300
Okay, well...

4873
03:47:01,300 --> 03:47:02,300
I tried, I tried.

4874
03:47:02,300 --> 03:47:03,300
Geez.

4875
03:47:03,300 --> 03:47:04,300
Can't impress them all.

4876
03:47:07,300 --> 03:47:08,300
Hydration check.

4877
03:47:09,300 --> 03:47:10,300
Um...

4878
03:47:10,300 --> 03:47:11,300
Right, I will tell you

4879
03:47:11,300 --> 03:47:12,300
when Amy goes live

4880
03:47:12,300 --> 03:47:13,300
and YouTube mods you have

4881
03:47:13,300 --> 03:47:14,300
permission to talk

4882
03:47:14,300 --> 03:47:15,300
when Amy does go live.

4883
03:47:16,300 --> 03:47:17,300
Um...

4884
03:47:17,300 --> 03:47:18,300
And we will play...

4885
03:47:19,300 --> 03:47:20,300
Oh!

4886
03:47:21,300 --> 03:47:22,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4887
03:47:23,300 --> 03:47:24,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4888
03:47:25,300 --> 03:47:26,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4889
03:47:26,300 --> 03:47:27,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4890
03:47:27,300 --> 03:47:28,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4891
03:47:28,300 --> 03:47:29,300
Oh, no, this can't be.

4892
03:47:30,300 --> 03:47:31,300
Oh, please don't touch me.

4893
03:47:37,300 --> 03:47:38,300
Wait.

4894
03:47:38,300 --> 03:47:40,300
So, what does the other lever do?

4895
03:47:43,300 --> 03:47:44,300
Jump on someone else's head.

4896
03:47:48,300 --> 03:47:49,300
Okay, there we go.

4897
03:47:51,300 --> 03:47:52,300
Okay, I'll take that.

4898
03:47:52,300 --> 03:47:53,300
Another keystone,

4899
03:47:53,300 --> 03:47:54,300
keystone.

4900
03:47:54,300 --> 03:47:55,300
Don't mind Father.

4901
03:47:56,300 --> 03:47:57,300
Oh!

4902
03:47:59,300 --> 03:48:00,300
Stop, please.

4903
03:48:01,300 --> 03:48:02,300
Sorry, a green chap.

4904
03:48:02,300 --> 03:48:03,300
Do you think Amy

4905
03:48:03,300 --> 03:48:04,300
has happen sizes?

4906
03:48:04,300 --> 03:48:05,300
No.

4907
03:48:06,300 --> 03:48:08,300
Whatever she does is completely

4908
03:48:08,300 --> 03:48:09,300
on her.

4909
03:48:09,300 --> 03:48:11,300
The girls make the content

4910
03:48:11,300 --> 03:48:12,300
they want to make.

4911
03:48:12,300 --> 03:48:13,300
They do what they want to do.

4912
03:48:13,300 --> 03:48:15,300
And that is the lovely

4913
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:16,300
jiggly way we do it.

4914
03:48:17,300 --> 03:48:18,300
And...

4915
03:48:20,300 --> 03:48:21,300
An unnatural...

4916
03:48:22,300 --> 03:48:23,300
Well...

4917
03:48:23,300 --> 03:48:24,300
Ah!

4918
03:48:24,300 --> 03:48:25,300
I see what I have to do.

4919
03:48:26,300 --> 03:48:27,300
No!

4920
03:48:27,300 --> 03:48:28,300
I just got walloped

4921
03:48:28,300 --> 03:48:29,300
by freaking haunted skulls!

4922
03:48:31,300 --> 03:48:32,300
Fucking get up,

4923
03:48:32,300 --> 03:48:33,300
you lazybump.

4924
03:48:34,300 --> 03:48:35,300
I can't go that way.

4925
03:48:38,300 --> 03:48:39,300
You can deactivate those

4926
03:48:39,300 --> 03:48:40,300
electricity skulls

4927
03:48:40,300 --> 03:48:41,300
with a boomerang.

4928
03:48:41,300 --> 03:48:42,300
Oh, I never bought it.

4929
03:48:42,300 --> 03:48:44,300
It was 300 rupees.

4930
03:48:46,300 --> 03:48:47,300
I can't believe it.

4931
03:48:47,300 --> 03:48:48,300
Poverty strikes again.

4932
03:48:49,300 --> 03:48:50,300
I said get the tinfoil hat on

4933
03:48:50,300 --> 03:48:51,300
right now.

4934
03:48:53,300 --> 03:48:54,300
It's tiring.

4935
03:48:57,300 --> 03:48:58,300
Great.

4936
03:48:58,300 --> 03:48:59,300
Yes.

4937
03:48:59,300 --> 03:49:00,300
That would be the plan.

4938
03:49:00,300 --> 03:49:01,300
We'll play menace

4939
03:49:01,300 --> 03:49:02,300
for another cheeky two hours

4940
03:49:02,300 --> 03:49:03,300
because we're cheeky cheeky.

4941
03:49:04,300 --> 03:49:05,300
Also cheeky bricky.

4942
03:49:06,300 --> 03:49:07,300
And then

4943
03:49:07,300 --> 03:49:08,300
we shall...

4944
03:49:11,300 --> 03:49:13,300
do the forbidden members here.

4945
03:49:15,300 --> 03:49:16,300
And then that way

4946
03:49:16,300 --> 03:49:17,300
everyone's happy.

4947
03:49:18,300 --> 03:49:19,300
And everyone is happy.

4948
03:49:20,300 --> 03:49:21,300
Can I make everyone happy?

4949
03:49:21,300 --> 03:49:22,300
I don't know.

4950
03:49:22,300 --> 03:49:24,300
I sent from the Australians

4951
03:49:24,300 --> 03:49:25,300
because this is

4952
03:49:25,300 --> 03:49:26,300
probably the worst

4953
03:49:26,300 --> 03:49:27,300
time

4954
03:49:29,300 --> 03:49:30,300
we could have asked for.

4955
03:49:31,300 --> 03:49:32,300
A key!

4956
03:49:33,300 --> 03:49:34,300
Can I fall at the bottom

4957
03:49:34,300 --> 03:49:35,300
without taking fall damage?

4958
03:49:38,300 --> 03:49:39,300
Hmm.

4959
03:49:39,300 --> 03:49:40,300
Did someone just fall down

4960
03:49:40,300 --> 03:49:41,300
or was it my imagination?

4961
03:49:42,300 --> 03:49:43,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4962
03:49:43,300 --> 03:49:44,300
Right.

4963
03:49:44,300 --> 03:49:45,300
Let's just take fall damage.

4964
03:49:46,300 --> 03:49:47,300
Speed things along a bit.

4965
03:49:48,300 --> 03:49:49,300
Emmy's going live now.

4966
03:49:49,300 --> 03:49:50,300
I don't know.

4967
03:49:52,300 --> 03:49:53,300
I knew...

4968
03:49:53,300 --> 03:49:54,300
I didn't know you could

4969
03:49:54,300 --> 03:49:55,300
do that with a boomerang

4970
03:49:55,300 --> 03:49:56,300
or something to do with a boomerang.

4971
03:49:58,300 --> 03:49:59,300
Hi.

4972
03:50:01,300 --> 03:50:02,300
What are you getting at?

4973
03:50:02,300 --> 03:50:03,300
Because I'm asked for showing up.

4974
03:50:03,300 --> 03:50:04,300
Wait, what's this?

4975
03:50:07,300 --> 03:50:09,300
Oh, there's so many stompers.

4976
03:50:10,300 --> 03:50:11,300
No, get away.

4977
03:50:11,300 --> 03:50:12,300
I'm no fighting you

4978
03:50:12,300 --> 03:50:13,300
as if you're just going to

4979
03:50:13,300 --> 03:50:14,300
keep respawning.

4980
03:50:16,300 --> 03:50:17,300
I don't have what...

4981
03:50:18,300 --> 03:50:19,300
That is so a rope snake.

4982
03:50:20,300 --> 03:50:21,300
I can tell.

4983
03:50:22,300 --> 03:50:23,300
No fall damage.

4984
03:50:23,300 --> 03:50:24,300
Nah.

4985
03:50:24,300 --> 03:50:25,300
Oh, these are happy.

4986
03:50:25,300 --> 03:50:26,300
Are they?

4987
03:50:27,300 --> 03:50:28,300
4am.

4988
03:50:30,300 --> 03:50:32,300
I guess it's maybe...

4989
03:50:33,300 --> 03:50:34,300
Oh, forget the stick.

4990
03:50:38,300 --> 03:50:39,300
Oh, I'm going to

4991
03:50:39,300 --> 03:50:40,300
freaking run out of health.

4992
03:50:40,300 --> 03:50:41,300
These don't have health.

4993
03:50:41,300 --> 03:50:42,300
Oh, for goodness.

4994
03:50:45,300 --> 03:50:46,300
I suck at this game.

4995
03:50:48,300 --> 03:50:49,300
But your mom swallows at it.

4996
03:50:55,300 --> 03:50:56,300
No.

4997
03:51:03,300 --> 03:51:04,300
Oh, no!

4998
03:51:04,300 --> 03:51:05,300
Did I?

4999
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:06,300
Please tell me they're

5000
03:51:06,300 --> 03:51:07,300
not all going to respawn.

5001
03:51:08,300 --> 03:51:09,300
Okay, they didn't.

5002
03:51:09,300 --> 03:51:10,300
Thank goodness.

5003
03:51:11,300 --> 03:51:12,300
The one time where

5004
03:51:12,300 --> 03:51:14,300
clearing out stuff actually works.

5005
03:51:15,300 --> 03:51:16,300
I zoned back into that.

5006
03:51:17,300 --> 03:51:18,300
But don't zone out.

5007
03:51:18,300 --> 03:51:19,300
Are you going to...

5008
03:51:21,300 --> 03:51:23,300
Can I actually perish these guys?

5009
03:51:25,300 --> 03:51:26,300
Can I?

5010
03:51:27,300 --> 03:51:28,300
Oh, you can!

5011
03:51:29,300 --> 03:51:30,300
Wait, can I, like,

5012
03:51:30,300 --> 03:51:31,300
fully perish you then?

5013
03:51:35,300 --> 03:51:36,300
That was 2...

5014
03:51:36,300 --> 03:51:37,300
3...

5015
03:51:37,300 --> 03:51:38,300
4.

5016
03:51:38,300 --> 03:51:39,300
Okay.

5017
03:51:39,300 --> 03:51:40,300
I didn't even know that.

5018
03:51:41,300 --> 03:51:42,300
Hello.

5019
03:51:42,300 --> 03:51:43,300
Are you the compass?

5020
03:51:44,300 --> 03:51:46,300
You're the dungeon map split school.

5021
03:51:48,300 --> 03:51:50,300
Well, AC is really going through it now.

5022
03:51:50,300 --> 03:51:51,300
What?

5023
03:51:52,300 --> 03:51:53,300
Did I need to check the disc?

5024
03:51:55,300 --> 03:51:56,300
Did she tweak something?

5025
03:52:01,300 --> 03:52:02,300
Oh, no, she can't tweak.

5026
03:52:02,300 --> 03:52:03,300
She's got her can band.

5027
03:52:03,300 --> 03:52:04,300
One more.

5028
03:52:07,300 --> 03:52:08,300
Am I missing?

5029
03:52:09,300 --> 03:52:10,300
Yeah, she's got her can band.

5030
03:52:15,300 --> 03:52:16,300
My cat is not me on it,

5031
03:52:16,300 --> 03:52:17,300
so I better figure that out.

5032
03:52:20,300 --> 03:52:21,300
Oh, AC got it.

5033
03:52:22,300 --> 03:52:23,300
Damn.

5034
03:52:23,300 --> 03:52:24,300
Hold on, let me find her.

5035
03:52:26,300 --> 03:52:27,300
Oh, I follow so many girls.

5036
03:52:29,300 --> 03:52:30,300
Oh, Dr. Nova followed me back.

5037
03:52:30,300 --> 03:52:31,300
That was kind of her.

5038
03:52:32,300 --> 03:52:33,300
Hold on.

5039
03:52:35,300 --> 03:52:37,300
Is it, like, the Any End Stream?

5040
03:52:38,300 --> 03:52:39,300
Or...

5041
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:41,300
I don't know.

5042
03:52:42,300 --> 03:52:43,300
I don't know.

5043
03:52:44,300 --> 03:52:45,300
I don't know.

5044
03:52:46,300 --> 03:52:47,300
I don't know.

5045
03:52:48,300 --> 03:52:49,300
I don't know.

5046
03:52:51,300 --> 03:52:52,300
I don't have the Discord account,

5047
03:52:53,300 --> 03:52:54,300
because I don't know anything.

5048
03:52:55,300 --> 03:52:56,300
She was showing me something.

5049
03:52:57,300 --> 03:52:58,300
Oh, it's just her filming.

5050
03:52:59,300 --> 03:53:00,300
Yeah.

5051
03:53:14,300 --> 03:53:15,300
I don't know.

5052
03:53:20,300 --> 03:53:21,300
Okay.

5053
03:53:30,300 --> 03:53:31,300
I think it's okay.

5054
03:53:34,300 --> 03:53:35,300
Okay, I think it's okay.

5055
03:53:35,300 --> 03:53:36,300
I think it's just...

5056
03:53:41,300 --> 03:53:42,300
Yeah.

5057
03:53:42,300 --> 03:53:43,300
Okay, I think it's...

5058
03:53:43,300 --> 03:53:44,300
All right.

5059
03:53:46,300 --> 03:53:47,300
The Uji-Sans will...

5060
03:53:47,300 --> 03:53:49,300
Oh, it looks like I'm moving on my health here.

5061
03:53:49,300 --> 03:53:50,300
The Uji-Sans will...

5062
03:53:54,300 --> 03:53:56,300
Gimli, I can hear you now.

5063
03:53:56,300 --> 03:53:57,300
Shut the fuck up.

5064
03:53:58,300 --> 03:54:00,300
There is not the time, darling.

5065
03:54:03,300 --> 03:54:04,300
Okay.

5066
03:54:05,300 --> 03:54:06,300
Phew, we barely made it.

5067
03:54:06,300 --> 03:54:07,300
I'm starting to run out of time.

5068
03:54:07,300 --> 03:54:08,300
I'm not trying.

5069
03:54:09,300 --> 03:54:10,300
I'm going to bed.

5070
03:54:10,300 --> 03:54:11,300
Oh, God, these are the hugger things.

5071
03:54:12,300 --> 03:54:13,300
Sorry, I might have to get Gimli in a minute.

5072
03:54:13,300 --> 03:54:14,300
She will not stop me on.

5073
03:54:17,300 --> 03:54:18,300
But I know...

5074
03:54:22,300 --> 03:54:23,300
He named your cat Gimli.

5075
03:54:24,300 --> 03:54:25,300
Am I going to call my cat Gimli?

5076
03:54:25,300 --> 03:54:26,300
So you're going to...

5077
03:54:27,300 --> 03:54:28,300
You're going to fart and clap?

5078
03:54:29,300 --> 03:54:30,300
Wait, no, that's not the same.

5079
03:54:30,300 --> 03:54:32,300
I think the same is like...

5080
03:54:32,300 --> 03:54:33,300
I'd rather...

5081
03:54:34,300 --> 03:54:36,300
go number two in my hands and clap

5082
03:54:36,300 --> 03:54:37,300
than do whatever...

5083
03:54:37,300 --> 03:54:38,300
or something fun.

5084
03:54:41,300 --> 03:54:42,300
It's a she, yes.

5085
03:54:44,300 --> 03:54:45,300
She's got a bit of ginger on her,

5086
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:46,300
so I named her Gimli.

5087
03:54:48,300 --> 03:54:49,300
I know, so for you.

5088
03:54:51,300 --> 03:54:52,300
Ah, yes.

5089
03:54:52,300 --> 03:54:53,300
The floor masters,

5090
03:54:53,300 --> 03:54:55,300
or the masters, depending on you.

5091
03:54:57,300 --> 03:54:59,300
Just kind of go in here

5092
03:54:59,300 --> 03:55:00,300
and do something.

5093
03:55:01,300 --> 03:55:02,300
I don't know what,

5094
03:55:02,300 --> 03:55:03,300
but we're doing something anyway.

5095
03:55:06,300 --> 03:55:07,300
Wait, what?

5096
03:55:07,300 --> 03:55:09,300
Is that supposed to go somewhere?

5097
03:55:13,300 --> 03:55:14,300
Wait,

5098
03:55:14,300 --> 03:55:15,300
have I gone too far ahead?

5099
03:55:18,300 --> 03:55:19,300
I think I have.

5100
03:55:25,300 --> 03:55:26,300
Wait, have I gone too far ahead?

5101
03:55:28,300 --> 03:55:29,300
Have I done wrong?

5102
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:34,300
I wouldn't mind getting a wee health bar.

5103
03:55:38,300 --> 03:55:40,300
I'm getting a wee cheeky heart.

5104
03:55:41,300 --> 03:55:42,300
I called my cat, baby.

5105
03:55:43,300 --> 03:55:44,300
Unlock the door.

5106
03:55:45,300 --> 03:55:46,300
I can't.

5107
03:55:46,300 --> 03:55:47,300
Oh, my God!

5108
03:55:50,300 --> 03:55:51,300
I'm not supposed to get killed for that.

5109
03:55:56,300 --> 03:55:57,300
Oh, no.

5110
03:55:57,300 --> 03:55:58,300
Close one.

5111
03:56:05,300 --> 03:56:07,300
Oh, I know, I know.

5112
03:56:07,300 --> 03:56:08,300
I comprehend, I comprehend.

5113
03:56:10,300 --> 03:56:11,300
No, don't.

5114
03:56:11,300 --> 03:56:12,300
Wait, what is this?

5115
03:56:12,300 --> 03:56:13,300
I don't know.

5116
03:56:14,300 --> 03:56:15,300
Oh, I need a zigzag.

5117
03:56:16,300 --> 03:56:17,300
Okay, I understand, I understand.

5118
03:56:17,300 --> 03:56:18,300
Sorry, it took me a...

5119
03:56:19,300 --> 03:56:20,300
a momento.

5120
03:56:20,300 --> 03:56:21,300
Right, if I do one there...

5121
03:56:23,300 --> 03:56:25,300
One, two, three, four, five.

5122
03:56:25,300 --> 03:56:27,300
Five, one, two, three, four, five.

5123
03:56:27,300 --> 03:56:29,300
Okay, up there and up there.

5124
03:56:29,300 --> 03:56:30,300
Right, okay, okay, okay.

5125
03:56:30,300 --> 03:56:31,300
Sorry, sorry.

5126
03:56:31,300 --> 03:56:32,300
It just takes me...

5127
03:56:32,300 --> 03:56:34,300
It takes me a moment to catch on.

5128
03:56:34,300 --> 03:56:35,300
It takes me a wee moment.

5129
03:56:35,300 --> 03:56:36,300
It's alright, it's alright, though.

5130
03:56:37,300 --> 03:56:38,300
It's alright.

5131
03:56:38,300 --> 03:56:39,300
It's alright.

5132
03:56:39,300 --> 03:56:40,300
We're here for doing it.

5133
03:56:40,300 --> 03:56:41,300
I don't need anybody.

5134
03:56:41,300 --> 03:56:42,300
I don't need anybody.

5135
03:56:42,300 --> 03:56:43,300
Um...

5136
03:56:44,300 --> 03:56:47,300
I was actually thinking of getting...

5137
03:56:49,300 --> 03:56:50,300
What's the game called?

5138
03:56:50,300 --> 03:56:52,300
Ah, that's exactly what I needed.

5139
03:56:52,300 --> 03:56:54,300
I was actually thinking of getting...

5140
03:56:56,300 --> 03:56:58,300
the buckshot roulette highlighted

5141
03:56:58,300 --> 03:56:59,300
just to show how dumb I am,

5142
03:56:59,300 --> 03:57:01,300
but like in a humorous way,

5143
03:57:01,300 --> 03:57:02,300
not like a...

5144
03:57:02,300 --> 03:57:03,300
you know, like pity party,

5145
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:06,300
oh my gosh, who's brainless type of way.

5146
03:57:06,300 --> 03:57:08,300
And then I need to be small down here.

5147
03:57:10,300 --> 03:57:11,300
Okay, that looks correct.

5148
03:57:11,300 --> 03:57:13,300
It looks like I need to be small now.

5149
03:57:15,300 --> 03:57:16,300
And what is down here?

5150
03:57:16,300 --> 03:57:18,300
I'm curious.

5151
03:57:21,300 --> 03:57:23,300
If there's anything at all.

5152
03:57:24,300 --> 03:57:26,300
Amy just went live with brainwashing.

5153
03:57:29,300 --> 03:57:31,300
She has already got a warning,

5154
03:57:31,300 --> 03:57:33,300
so I'm nervous for that stream,

5155
03:57:33,300 --> 03:57:34,300
but hey, huh?

5156
03:57:34,300 --> 03:57:35,300
We're all adults here.

5157
03:57:37,300 --> 03:57:38,300
How'd I get up?

5158
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:39,300
I can't use the stairs,

5159
03:57:39,300 --> 03:57:40,300
so I'll have to go all the way back

5160
03:57:40,300 --> 03:57:42,300
and shrink down an income.

5161
03:57:45,300 --> 03:57:46,300
I am getting very low health

5162
03:57:46,300 --> 03:57:48,300
and I don't like it,

5163
03:57:48,300 --> 03:57:49,300
and the game is currently refusing

5164
03:57:49,300 --> 03:57:51,300
to spawn one heart for me.

5165
03:57:51,300 --> 03:57:52,300
I do have a theory.

5166
03:57:56,300 --> 03:57:58,300
Yeah, I don't really need money right now.

5167
03:57:58,300 --> 03:57:59,300
I need a heart.

5168
03:57:59,300 --> 03:58:01,300
The game already needs a heart.

5169
03:58:02,300 --> 03:58:04,300
She's just following my misexample.

5170
03:58:05,300 --> 03:58:06,300
I just get so nervous.

5171
03:58:06,300 --> 03:58:07,300
I'm like, oh my god,

5172
03:58:07,300 --> 03:58:08,300
I wouldn't want them to jeopardize

5173
03:58:08,300 --> 03:58:10,300
their income or anything like that,

5174
03:58:10,300 --> 03:58:12,300
because YouTube makes up

5175
03:58:12,300 --> 03:58:14,300
such a big chunk of income.

5176
03:58:14,300 --> 03:58:16,300
As well as passive income,

5177
03:58:18,300 --> 03:58:19,300
because I almost made it.

5178
03:58:19,300 --> 03:58:20,300
I was going to go it,

5179
03:58:20,300 --> 03:58:21,300
but I don't have enough health

5180
03:58:21,300 --> 03:58:22,300
to be messing around.

5181
03:58:23,300 --> 03:58:24,300
But yes, Amy is live

5182
03:58:24,300 --> 03:58:25,300
for any pinpals

5183
03:58:25,300 --> 03:58:27,300
who are wanting

5184
03:58:27,300 --> 03:58:30,300
the tingly ASMR experience.

5185
03:58:30,300 --> 03:58:32,300
Please do check it out.

5186
03:58:32,300 --> 03:58:33,300
Um...

5187
03:58:35,300 --> 03:58:36,300
Um...

5188
03:58:36,300 --> 03:58:38,300
What happened from here?

5189
03:58:39,300 --> 03:58:40,300
Um...

5190
03:58:40,300 --> 03:58:42,300
I'm just a bit of an irritant, okay?

5191
03:58:43,300 --> 03:58:44,300
What did those do?

5192
03:58:50,300 --> 03:58:51,300
Right.

5193
03:58:53,300 --> 03:58:54,300
Again, my question is,

5194
03:58:54,300 --> 03:58:55,300
what did those do?

5195
03:58:57,300 --> 03:58:58,300
I dropped a key

5196
03:58:58,300 --> 03:59:00,300
that I can't get access to.

5197
03:59:01,300 --> 03:59:02,300
Ray...

5198
03:59:04,300 --> 03:59:05,300
Right, if I want to become big,

5199
03:59:05,300 --> 03:59:07,300
I can take a shortcut this way.

5200
03:59:08,300 --> 03:59:10,300
I am missing an item,

5201
03:59:10,300 --> 03:59:12,300
and I've gone the wrong way.

5202
03:59:16,300 --> 03:59:18,300
Okay, I've definitely missed an item,

5203
03:59:18,300 --> 03:59:19,300
because...

5204
03:59:25,300 --> 03:59:26,300
What was here?

5205
03:59:27,300 --> 03:59:29,300
Again, I need an item.

5206
03:59:29,300 --> 03:59:30,300
Right.

5207
03:59:30,300 --> 03:59:31,300
There must be another way.

5208
03:59:34,300 --> 03:59:35,300
Top ten times

5209
03:59:35,300 --> 03:59:36,300
Pastrani

5210
03:59:36,300 --> 03:59:37,300
shot herself with a shot

5211
03:59:37,300 --> 03:59:39,300
that I didn't believe number four.

5212
03:59:39,300 --> 03:59:40,300
What?!

5213
03:59:44,300 --> 03:59:45,300
Would you prefer to be punned

5214
03:59:45,300 --> 03:59:47,300
with Pastrami or something?

5215
03:59:47,300 --> 03:59:49,300
Friggin' Azura's accent is so funny.

5216
03:59:49,300 --> 03:59:50,300
She calls me Strani.

5217
03:59:52,300 --> 03:59:53,300
And I'm like,

5218
03:59:53,300 --> 03:59:55,300
are you calling me Minestrani Sue?

5219
03:59:55,300 --> 03:59:57,300
But it's just the way she says it.

5220
03:59:57,300 --> 03:59:58,300
Okay, this is exactly

5221
03:59:58,300 --> 03:59:59,300
what I needed.

5222
03:59:59,300 --> 04:00:00,300
This friggin' room right here.

5223
04:00:00,300 --> 04:00:01,300
Give me the heart.

5224
04:00:02,300 --> 04:00:03,300
She's a Gastroni,

5225
04:00:03,300 --> 04:00:04,300
and I'm like...

5226
04:00:05,300 --> 04:00:06,300
Oh my God, Azura.

5227
04:00:07,300 --> 04:00:09,300
I literally sound like Minestrani Sue!

5228
04:00:11,300 --> 04:00:12,300
That's very cute.

5229
04:00:12,300 --> 04:00:13,300
I like it.

5230
04:00:19,300 --> 04:00:20,300
That looks like Archery,

5231
04:00:20,300 --> 04:00:22,300
if I've ever seen something like that.

5232
04:00:22,300 --> 04:00:24,300
Yeah, and it gives you five in a...

5233
04:00:26,300 --> 04:00:27,300
Okay.

5234
04:00:27,300 --> 04:00:29,300
We will get the super secret item.

5235
04:00:33,300 --> 04:00:35,300
Right, I'm just gonna take the HP damage

5236
04:00:35,300 --> 04:00:37,300
because I know there's infinite heals.

5237
04:00:39,300 --> 04:00:40,300
Oh!

5238
04:00:40,300 --> 04:00:42,300
Do we have Invis frames when we spray?

5239
04:00:43,300 --> 04:00:44,300
One of them is a rope.

5240
04:00:47,300 --> 04:00:48,300
Yeah, fuck me.

5241
04:00:49,300 --> 04:00:51,300
Damn right, give me that coin.

5242
04:00:51,300 --> 04:00:53,300
Right, where is that electoral thing?

5243
04:00:55,300 --> 04:00:56,300
Is it the red one?

5244
04:01:00,300 --> 04:01:01,300
It is.

5245
04:01:05,300 --> 04:01:06,300
See, you can get me to this.

5246
04:01:06,300 --> 04:01:07,300
You got me before,

5247
04:01:07,300 --> 04:01:08,300
but you'll never get me again.

5248
04:01:12,300 --> 04:01:14,300
Azura's been absolutely killing it

5249
04:01:14,300 --> 04:01:15,300
on the Star Jew.

5250
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:16,300
She is a dick.

5251
04:01:16,300 --> 04:01:17,300
It's eight.

5252
04:01:20,300 --> 04:01:21,300
What is this?

5253
04:01:25,300 --> 04:01:26,300
Oh!

5254
04:01:26,300 --> 04:01:27,300
True.

5255
04:01:27,300 --> 04:01:29,300
Oh, I need to go on that platform.

5256
04:01:30,300 --> 04:01:32,300
Oh, I need to do a little cheeky trickshot.

5257
04:01:33,300 --> 04:01:34,300
Oh, I missed.

5258
04:01:36,300 --> 04:01:37,300
Hey!

5259
04:01:40,300 --> 04:01:41,300
And then...

5260
04:01:45,300 --> 04:01:46,300
There we go.

5261
04:01:46,300 --> 04:01:48,300
Both sides are open, that's why I like to...

5262
04:01:52,300 --> 04:01:53,300
Yeah, see,

5263
04:01:53,300 --> 04:01:55,300
imagine if you drop more hearts consistently.

5264
04:01:55,300 --> 04:01:57,300
How easy would this game be?

5265
04:01:57,300 --> 04:01:58,300
But no, no.

5266
04:02:04,300 --> 04:02:05,300
If I push that,

5267
04:02:06,300 --> 04:02:07,300
doesn't that block me?

5268
04:02:11,300 --> 04:02:13,300
I'm a bit too scared to touch anything

5269
04:02:13,300 --> 04:02:15,300
in this room...

5270
04:02:15,300 --> 04:02:17,300
unless I'm going crazy.

5271
04:02:18,300 --> 04:02:21,300
She said she has, like, two key arrows in it.

5272
04:02:23,300 --> 04:02:24,300
That is...

5273
04:02:25,300 --> 04:02:27,300
Am I going mental or is that just going to block me?

5274
04:02:40,300 --> 04:02:41,300
However,

5275
04:02:41,300 --> 04:02:43,300
I think I dropped down onto it instead

5276
04:02:43,300 --> 04:02:45,300
because that doesn't seem right at all.

5277
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:48,300
I'm actually losing that...

5278
04:02:49,300 --> 04:02:50,300
Game!

5279
04:02:50,300 --> 04:02:52,300
You knew exactly what I was trying to achieve.

5280
04:02:54,300 --> 04:02:55,300
Okay, let's go.

5281
04:03:02,300 --> 04:03:04,300
Well, I assume this is going to turn them on.

5282
04:03:05,300 --> 04:03:06,300
Hmm, gee Wilkers,

5283
04:03:06,300 --> 04:03:09,300
I wonder if standing on these buttons in this room full of two enemies

5284
04:03:09,300 --> 04:03:11,300
is going to activate enemies?

5285
04:03:11,300 --> 04:03:12,300
Surely it's a mystery.

5286
04:03:12,300 --> 04:03:13,300
Truly.

5287
04:03:13,300 --> 04:03:14,300
Truly a mystery.

5288
04:03:16,300 --> 04:03:17,300
I'm not stuck.

5289
04:03:18,300 --> 04:03:19,300
Oh, I missed.

5290
04:03:19,300 --> 04:03:20,300
Okay, now he's looking at me.

5291
04:03:21,300 --> 04:03:22,300
Wah!

5292
04:03:24,300 --> 04:03:25,300
I missed.

5293
04:03:27,300 --> 04:03:28,300
Right in your eyeball, bruv.

5294
04:03:31,300 --> 04:03:32,300
Ta-da!

5295
04:03:37,300 --> 04:03:38,300
No, wait, you got it.

5296
04:03:39,300 --> 04:03:40,300
Compass!

5297
04:03:42,300 --> 04:03:43,300
The heart's in here.

5298
04:03:43,300 --> 04:03:45,300
You know, there's ammo, though.

5299
04:03:48,300 --> 04:03:50,300
I'm full ammo, I didn't even get it.

5300
04:03:51,300 --> 04:03:53,300
It's correct, no push up.

5301
04:03:54,300 --> 04:03:56,300
Pegasus boots across the gap, no push up.

5302
04:03:58,300 --> 04:03:59,300
He gets trolling.

5303
04:03:59,300 --> 04:04:02,300
I'm pretty sure I have to drop down and it's a troll.

5304
04:04:04,300 --> 04:04:06,300
Nintendo are very trolly,

5305
04:04:06,300 --> 04:04:09,300
but this does not seem correct at all.

5306
04:04:09,300 --> 04:04:11,300
I think we dropped down.

5307
04:04:11,300 --> 04:04:13,300
I want to say we dropped down because...

5308
04:04:14,300 --> 04:04:16,300
Yeah, this doesn't look right.

5309
04:04:16,300 --> 04:04:17,300
Push!

5310
04:04:17,300 --> 04:04:18,300
Push!

5311
04:04:18,300 --> 04:04:19,300
I can only push.

5312
04:04:19,300 --> 04:04:20,300
I can only push again.

5313
04:04:21,300 --> 04:04:22,300
And then I can only push again.

5314
04:04:22,300 --> 04:04:23,300
I don't have a choice.

5315
04:04:23,300 --> 04:04:25,300
Like, I can push that back.

5316
04:04:25,300 --> 04:04:26,300
That doesn't do anything.

5317
04:04:26,300 --> 04:04:27,300
Oh, push it up!

5318
04:04:27,300 --> 04:04:29,300
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

5319
04:04:29,300 --> 04:04:31,300
I'm so sorry.

5320
04:04:31,300 --> 04:04:32,300
I'm so...

5321
04:04:33,300 --> 04:04:37,300
Like, if I can't see the solution, then it doesn't work.

5322
04:04:37,300 --> 04:04:38,300
You know what I mean?

5323
04:04:38,300 --> 04:04:39,300
I'm so sorry.

5324
04:04:39,300 --> 04:04:42,300
The reason why you push it that way is so you can do them horizontal.

5325
04:04:42,300 --> 04:04:43,300
I apologize.

5326
04:04:43,300 --> 04:04:46,300
Literally never played this, so I can't offer any advice.

5327
04:04:46,300 --> 04:04:49,300
Well, I'm pretty sure you probably called out though.

5328
04:04:49,300 --> 04:04:51,300
I am so sorry.

5329
04:04:51,300 --> 04:04:54,300
Oh my god, I must be painful watching me do anything.

5330
04:04:56,300 --> 04:04:57,300
Okay, we have a key.

5331
04:04:57,300 --> 04:04:58,300
Let's go grab it.

5332
04:04:59,300 --> 04:05:01,300
Yeah, we're just going to go back down again.

5333
04:05:01,300 --> 04:05:03,300
You're so adorable.

5334
04:05:03,300 --> 04:05:04,300
Isn't it not frustrating though?

5335
04:05:04,300 --> 04:05:07,300
I feel like it'd be frustrating watching someone being like,

5336
04:05:07,300 --> 04:05:08,300
No, that's impossible.

5337
04:05:08,300 --> 04:05:10,300
And the solution is literally right there.

5338
04:05:11,300 --> 04:05:12,300
I feel like...

5339
04:05:17,300 --> 04:05:19,300
I get it, I get it.

5340
04:05:19,300 --> 04:05:22,300
Right, we finally have the second key, so we can just come up here

5341
04:05:22,300 --> 04:05:24,300
and go straight into the...

5342
04:05:24,300 --> 04:05:26,300
We would watch you...

5343
04:05:26,300 --> 04:05:27,300
Oh, this reset.

5344
04:05:27,300 --> 04:05:29,300
Oh, but I didn't reset those guys.

5345
04:05:30,300 --> 04:05:32,300
Watch paint dry.

5346
04:05:33,300 --> 04:05:34,300
Right.

5347
04:05:34,300 --> 04:05:36,300
Let's just do this.

5348
04:05:36,300 --> 04:05:37,300
Steady.

5349
04:05:37,300 --> 04:05:38,300
Easy. Steady.

5350
04:05:38,300 --> 04:05:40,300
Whoa, you've never seen anyone move faster.

5351
04:05:42,300 --> 04:05:44,300
Are these going to vibrate?

5352
04:05:44,300 --> 04:05:45,300
No.

5353
04:05:46,300 --> 04:05:47,300
Whoa.

5354
04:05:48,300 --> 04:05:49,300
Naughty.

5355
04:05:50,300 --> 04:05:52,300
Oh wait, that's like the enemies in Isaac as well.

5356
04:05:53,300 --> 04:05:56,300
He wasn't kidding when you said this game was inspired by it.

5357
04:05:57,300 --> 04:05:58,300
Oh, fight room, fight room.

5358
04:06:02,300 --> 04:06:05,300
It always scares other way, Link.

5359
04:06:05,300 --> 04:06:06,300
Jeez.

5360
04:06:10,300 --> 04:06:12,300
Okay, he needs to attack,

5361
04:06:12,300 --> 04:06:14,300
and then I can wallop his chest.

5362
04:06:15,300 --> 04:06:16,300
Wallop.

5363
04:06:17,300 --> 04:06:18,300
Wallop.

5364
04:06:19,300 --> 04:06:20,300
Wallop.

5365
04:06:20,300 --> 04:06:21,300
Oh, I missed.

5366
04:06:25,300 --> 04:06:26,300
Ah, there we go.

5367
04:06:26,300 --> 04:06:28,300
Take yourself out, mate, you suck.

5368
04:06:28,300 --> 04:06:32,300
Oh, we're already halfway through the dungeon, so just unlock the portal.

5369
04:06:33,300 --> 04:06:34,300
Okay, yeah.

5370
04:06:35,300 --> 04:06:39,300
Just a reminder to anyone that wants to watch ASMR,

5371
04:06:39,300 --> 04:06:44,300
Amy Bezu is live, her link is in the description down below.

5372
04:06:45,300 --> 04:06:47,300
Everyone's link is actually in my description.

5373
04:06:47,300 --> 04:06:50,300
Go subscribe to everyone, and go watch their shorts.

5374
04:06:50,300 --> 04:06:53,300
I spend money on their shorts, so please watch them.

5375
04:06:53,300 --> 04:06:55,300
Please watch them, please help the girls.

5376
04:06:56,300 --> 04:07:00,300
Actually, big news that I completely forgot to mention,

5377
04:07:00,300 --> 04:07:04,300
Sheeby is going balls to the wall.

5378
04:07:05,300 --> 04:07:07,300
She's full-time now, I feel her.

5379
04:07:08,300 --> 04:07:11,300
She had a job, on every hand, and she's full-time now.

5380
04:07:11,300 --> 04:07:12,300
Feels good now.

5381
04:07:13,300 --> 04:07:16,300
So definitely don't be afraid to sign up for the girls' picture-

5382
04:07:16,300 --> 04:07:19,300
Oh, that's what I was saying before I interrupted myself.

5383
04:07:21,300 --> 04:07:22,300
Because someone-

5384
04:07:22,300 --> 04:07:23,300
Ah, piss!

5385
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:24,300
My rupees are full.

5386
04:07:27,300 --> 04:07:32,300
I didn't see a bag at that shot to increase my rupees.

5387
04:07:34,300 --> 04:07:36,300
Yeah, she quit, she's now full-time.

5388
04:07:36,300 --> 04:07:37,300
Yeah.

5389
04:07:40,300 --> 04:07:43,300
Oh, that's just how I progressed.

5390
04:07:45,300 --> 04:07:46,300
Yeah, she's full-time.

5391
04:07:46,300 --> 04:07:48,300
Definitely don't be afraid to support the girls I'm pretty on.

5392
04:07:48,300 --> 04:07:52,300
As I was saying, when I was mentioning that the game is free,

5393
04:07:57,300 --> 04:07:59,300
I was talking about people being like,

5394
04:07:59,300 --> 04:08:03,300
I only have five dollars to support.

5395
04:08:03,300 --> 04:08:05,300
I feel so bad it's not enough.

5396
04:08:07,300 --> 04:08:11,300
So, what's the word?

5397
04:08:12,300 --> 04:08:14,300
It comes together.

5398
04:08:16,300 --> 04:08:20,300
So you give five bucks, and then someone with your mentality gives five bucks,

5399
04:08:20,300 --> 04:08:22,300
and then someone goes on and on and on.

5400
04:08:22,300 --> 04:08:24,300
And that money adds up over time.

5401
04:08:25,300 --> 04:08:26,300
It's kind of like-

5402
04:08:26,300 --> 04:08:29,300
I don't know if you've ever heard of the OF Rhetoric where it's like,

5403
04:08:29,300 --> 04:08:34,300
Oh, you sell your do-do-do-do for pennies type thing.

5404
04:08:34,300 --> 04:08:36,300
But it adds up, though.

5405
04:08:36,300 --> 04:08:39,300
You don't need to charge 70 or four.

5406
04:08:39,300 --> 04:08:41,300
It's just not needed.

5407
04:08:43,300 --> 04:08:45,300
I'm going to get an exact-

5408
04:08:45,300 --> 04:08:46,300
I'm going to get-

5409
04:08:46,300 --> 04:08:48,300
Please let me out, jeez.

5410
04:08:49,300 --> 04:08:51,300
Wait, where'd I go with Keto?

5411
04:08:52,300 --> 04:08:54,300
But it all adds up and it adds to their income,

5412
04:08:54,300 --> 04:08:56,300
and it's stable income as well.

5413
04:08:56,300 --> 04:08:58,300
As long as I have told the girls,

5414
04:08:58,300 --> 04:09:00,300
I've been very serious with them.

5415
04:09:00,300 --> 04:09:02,300
Am I going to get-

5416
04:09:02,300 --> 04:09:03,300
Am I going to get touched?

5417
04:09:03,300 --> 04:09:05,300
I've been not in the business.

5418
04:09:06,300 --> 04:09:11,300
I have told them, like, it's of your utmost importance to give me these audios in time,

5419
04:09:11,300 --> 04:09:13,300
because if we have to pause your Patreon income,

5420
04:09:13,300 --> 04:09:16,300
then it's probably you're gonna be-

5421
04:09:16,300 --> 04:09:18,300
There's no point in picking up rupees.

5422
04:09:18,300 --> 04:09:21,300
Of course I get a red and two blues,

5423
04:09:21,300 --> 04:09:24,300
literally 30 rupees in one pop when I'm like full.

5424
04:09:25,300 --> 04:09:26,300
What are these guys?

5425
04:09:26,300 --> 04:09:27,300
How do I hurt them?

5426
04:09:27,300 --> 04:09:29,300
I'll just spam them in the corner.

5427
04:09:29,300 --> 04:09:31,300
Money compounds, yes, basically.

5428
04:09:31,300 --> 04:09:32,300
Can you come here?

5429
04:09:33,300 --> 04:09:35,300
Is that four hits, jeez.

5430
04:09:36,300 --> 04:09:39,300
Yeah, yeah, of course I get tons of money now.

5431
04:09:39,300 --> 04:09:41,300
In game.

5432
04:09:41,300 --> 04:09:43,300
Wah!

5433
04:09:46,300 --> 04:09:48,300
Nah, Sam's just skipping.

5434
04:09:48,300 --> 04:09:50,300
If you're not coming towards me, I'm skipping.

5435
04:09:50,300 --> 04:09:52,300
Ah, piss, left or right.

5436
04:09:53,300 --> 04:09:54,300
Left or right.

5437
04:09:54,300 --> 04:09:56,300
Whoever types left or right, I'll do your first-

5438
04:09:56,300 --> 04:09:58,300
Do your first saying.

5439
04:09:58,300 --> 04:10:00,300
Don't blow it yourself or not, then eat and come on through.

5440
04:10:00,300 --> 04:10:02,300
Don't be meanly, literally.

5441
04:10:02,300 --> 04:10:04,300
Alright, first one said left.

5442
04:10:12,300 --> 04:10:14,300
Mods, execute that man.

5443
04:10:15,300 --> 04:10:17,300
Left or right.

5444
04:10:17,300 --> 04:10:19,300
Left or right.

5445
04:10:22,300 --> 04:10:23,300
Left or right.

5446
04:10:23,300 --> 04:10:25,300
No, you know what?

5447
04:10:25,300 --> 04:10:26,300
You know what?

5448
04:10:26,300 --> 04:10:27,300
I'll do it myself.

5449
04:10:27,300 --> 04:10:28,300
I'm gonna time you out,

5450
04:10:28,300 --> 04:10:29,300
for giving me the wrong say-

5451
04:10:29,300 --> 04:10:31,300
I'm not even kidding, I'm timing you out,

5452
04:10:31,300 --> 04:10:33,300
because you gave me the wrong say to go on.

5453
04:10:33,300 --> 04:10:36,300
You will be timed out for a whole,

5454
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:38,300
a whole minute.

5455
04:10:38,300 --> 04:10:41,300
For your, your dissatisfaction.

5456
04:10:41,300 --> 04:10:43,300
Where are you?

5457
04:10:43,300 --> 04:10:44,300
No!

5458
04:10:44,300 --> 04:10:46,300
Where is it?

5459
04:10:46,300 --> 04:10:48,300
Wait, I need to time them out.

5460
04:10:48,300 --> 04:10:49,300
I need to time them out.

5461
04:10:49,300 --> 04:10:51,300
Put user in time out.

5462
04:10:51,300 --> 04:10:52,300
Who was it?

5463
04:10:52,300 --> 04:10:54,300
Right, put user in time out.

5464
04:10:54,300 --> 04:10:57,300
For ten seconds, confirm.

5465
04:10:57,300 --> 04:11:00,300
There, you've been timed out for ten seconds.

5466
04:11:00,300 --> 04:11:02,300
Take that time out.

5467
04:11:02,300 --> 04:11:04,300
Your insolence towards the cause

5468
04:11:04,300 --> 04:11:06,300
will not be forgotten.

5469
04:11:07,300 --> 04:11:09,300
Don't ever cook again.

5470
04:11:09,300 --> 04:11:10,300
Teasing you.

5471
04:11:10,300 --> 04:11:11,300
So cruel.

5472
04:11:11,300 --> 04:11:12,300
One whole minute of no-

5473
04:11:12,300 --> 04:11:14,300
No, I said ten seconds.

5474
04:11:14,300 --> 04:11:15,300
I said ten seconds.

5475
04:11:15,300 --> 04:11:17,300
Is he back?

5476
04:11:17,300 --> 04:11:18,300
I'm gonna start panicking,

5477
04:11:18,300 --> 04:11:20,300
if a mod actually did ban you for real though.

5478
04:11:20,300 --> 04:11:22,300
Mods, whenever I say ban this man,

5479
04:11:22,300 --> 04:11:24,300
I mean in humorous way.

5480
04:11:24,300 --> 04:11:27,300
Where the heck is the dungeon thing?

5481
04:11:27,300 --> 04:11:28,300
Based AF.

5482
04:11:28,300 --> 04:11:29,300
Oh no, there you are.

5483
04:11:29,300 --> 04:11:30,300
Guys, it hurts.

5484
04:11:30,300 --> 04:11:32,300
Yeah, okay, he's back, he's back.

5485
04:11:32,300 --> 04:11:35,300
Right, where was the dungeon entrance?

5486
04:11:35,300 --> 04:11:38,300
I actually don't recall seeing the dungeon entrance.

5487
04:11:38,300 --> 04:11:41,300
Is it back this way?

5488
04:11:41,300 --> 04:11:43,300
Oh, they're dancing.

5489
04:11:43,300 --> 04:11:44,300
Oh, it must be this way.

5490
04:11:44,300 --> 04:11:46,300
Yeah, surely, surely.

5491
04:11:51,300 --> 04:11:52,300
Check them out.

5492
04:11:52,300 --> 04:11:54,300
Personal attention.

5493
04:11:54,300 --> 04:11:55,300
Refling.

5494
04:11:55,300 --> 04:11:57,300
This should have been me.

5495
04:11:57,300 --> 04:11:58,300
No, it shouldn't,

5496
04:11:58,300 --> 04:12:00,300
because you get timed out for doing that.

5497
04:12:00,300 --> 04:12:02,300
Wait, I'm gonna do it.

5498
04:12:02,300 --> 04:12:03,300
The chest spawns there,

5499
04:12:03,300 --> 04:12:05,300
not the statue has to go there.

5500
04:12:05,300 --> 04:12:07,300
Me making my thingy.

5501
04:12:07,300 --> 04:12:08,300
Doomsdaydan,

5502
04:12:08,300 --> 04:12:09,300
what if I wanna pay for it though?

5503
04:12:09,300 --> 04:12:11,300
I never read out your name.

5504
04:12:11,300 --> 04:12:14,300
God, it must be really weird

5505
04:12:14,300 --> 04:12:16,300
when I don't read out your name when you don't know,

5506
04:12:16,300 --> 04:12:18,300
and then 15 minutes later,

5507
04:12:18,300 --> 04:12:20,300
I'm like, oh my god,

5508
04:12:21,300 --> 04:12:22,300
Oh my god, Duly Lover,

5509
04:12:22,300 --> 04:12:23,300
thank you so much,

5510
04:12:23,300 --> 04:12:25,300
because I keep forgetting.

5511
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:32,300
I wouldn't mind getting a full heal.

5512
04:12:32,300 --> 04:12:34,300
Do you have hearts?

5513
04:12:34,300 --> 04:12:36,300
Yeah, that's what I like to see.

5514
04:12:36,300 --> 04:12:37,300
That's what I like to see,

5515
04:12:37,300 --> 04:12:38,300
a video game that's stocked up.

5516
04:12:38,300 --> 04:12:40,300
Right, we're ready.

5517
04:12:41,300 --> 04:12:43,300
How long are you going today?

5518
04:12:43,300 --> 04:12:46,300
We have T-minus less than two hours,

5519
04:12:46,300 --> 04:12:49,300
and then we will continue

5520
04:12:49,300 --> 04:12:51,300
our Zelda shenanigans tomorrow.

5521
04:12:55,300 --> 04:12:56,300
I don't feel that.

5522
04:12:56,300 --> 04:12:58,300
I don't feel everything, honestly.

5523
04:13:12,300 --> 04:13:15,300
Shoot his hands with an arrow?

5524
04:13:15,300 --> 04:13:16,300
That looks correct,

5525
04:13:16,300 --> 04:13:18,300
so let's do that.

5526
04:13:18,300 --> 04:13:20,300
Oh, okay, let's not do that.

5527
04:13:20,300 --> 04:13:23,300
Oh, okay, let's just completely miss.

5528
04:13:29,300 --> 04:13:31,300
Ah, let me go, let me go.

5529
04:13:31,300 --> 04:13:33,300
I'm just a tiny boy from the pool.

5530
04:13:33,300 --> 04:13:35,300
Whoa, he took so much health.

5531
04:13:35,300 --> 04:13:38,300
That is an insane amount of health he just took.

5532
04:13:38,300 --> 04:13:40,300
Am I supposed to have more health by this?

5533
04:13:40,300 --> 04:13:42,300
I think I might need to do more side quests

5534
04:13:42,300 --> 04:13:43,300
than after this.

5535
04:13:43,300 --> 04:13:46,300
He took so much health in that.

5536
04:13:46,300 --> 04:13:48,300
Oh my god, oh my god.

5537
04:13:49,300 --> 04:13:51,300
He's got a little thing on his nose.

5538
04:13:51,300 --> 04:13:53,300
Oh god, what happens in here?

5539
04:13:58,300 --> 04:14:00,300
Oh, okay, we did it, we did it.

5540
04:14:00,300 --> 04:14:01,300
We're being extracted.

5541
04:14:01,300 --> 04:14:02,300
Any extractors?

5542
04:14:02,300 --> 04:14:04,300
Me, me, I'm being extracted.

5543
04:14:06,300 --> 04:14:09,300
Why did you take so much health though?

5544
04:14:10,300 --> 04:14:11,300
Oh.

5545
04:14:14,300 --> 04:14:17,300
Can you drop a heart maybe instead of arrows?

5546
04:14:17,300 --> 04:14:18,300
That'd be great.

5547
04:14:25,300 --> 04:14:27,300
I'm totally not strawwetting right now.

5548
04:14:27,300 --> 04:14:29,300
I'm getting a bit nervous.

5549
04:14:29,300 --> 04:14:32,300
Oh, what, there?

5550
04:14:32,300 --> 04:14:34,300
It's not that one, it has to be...

5551
04:14:34,300 --> 04:14:36,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5552
04:14:37,300 --> 04:14:38,300
I can't do any harder.

5553
04:14:38,300 --> 04:14:39,300
I can't do any harder.

5554
04:14:39,300 --> 04:14:40,300
Alright, again, extracted.

5555
04:14:40,300 --> 04:14:42,300
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

5556
04:14:42,300 --> 04:14:44,300
We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it.

5557
04:14:44,300 --> 04:14:45,300
What's that?

5558
04:14:45,300 --> 04:14:46,300
I'm low health.

5559
04:14:46,300 --> 04:14:48,300
It's fine though.

5560
04:14:48,300 --> 04:14:49,300
Ow!

5561
04:14:49,300 --> 04:14:51,300
Alright, I said we're dropping the fairy.

5562
04:14:51,300 --> 04:14:52,300
Bring the fairy in.

5563
04:14:52,300 --> 04:14:54,300
Ring the guards, ring the guards.

5564
04:14:54,300 --> 04:14:56,300
The guards have been rang.

5565
04:14:59,300 --> 04:15:01,300
Oh my god, I'm like spamming so hard when I do that.

5566
04:15:01,300 --> 04:15:03,300
I'm not even kidding.

5567
04:15:04,300 --> 04:15:05,300
Can we do it?

5568
04:15:05,300 --> 04:15:06,300
Can we do it?

5569
04:15:06,300 --> 04:15:08,300
Can we do it in this perfect three or are we gonna have to do it again?

5570
04:15:08,300 --> 04:15:10,300
Because I don't have any more heals.

5571
04:15:10,300 --> 04:15:12,300
I don't have any more heals, bro.

5572
04:15:12,300 --> 04:15:13,300
Wait!

5573
04:15:13,300 --> 04:15:14,300
What are you doing?

5574
04:15:14,300 --> 04:15:16,300
Link!

5575
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:18,300
Link, you're stressing me out.

5576
04:15:18,300 --> 04:15:19,300
We're under a timer here.

5577
04:15:19,300 --> 04:15:21,300
This guy doesn't stay down forever.

5578
04:15:21,300 --> 04:15:23,300
Sorry, sorry.

5579
04:15:23,300 --> 04:15:25,300
Ugh.

5580
04:15:25,300 --> 04:15:27,300
No!

5581
04:15:27,300 --> 04:15:29,300
Ugh.

5582
04:15:29,300 --> 04:15:31,300
Oh, we're gonna get extracted before we even...

5583
04:15:31,300 --> 04:15:33,300
Done a lick of damage!

5584
04:15:33,300 --> 04:15:34,300
No!

5585
04:15:34,300 --> 04:15:36,300
This is why I don't gamble!

5586
04:15:37,300 --> 04:15:39,300
This is why I don't gamble!

5587
04:15:39,300 --> 04:15:41,300
Oh, we did it.

5588
04:15:41,300 --> 04:15:43,300
Oh, we did it.

5589
04:15:43,300 --> 04:15:45,300
Don't gamble, home kids.

5590
04:15:46,300 --> 04:15:48,300
This is why we don't gamble.

5591
04:15:49,300 --> 04:15:52,300
Let's go free in a row.

5592
04:15:52,300 --> 04:15:54,300
And a healthup.

5593
04:15:54,300 --> 04:15:56,300
I don't know why I just turned Russian there.

5594
04:15:56,300 --> 04:15:57,300
A healthup.

5595
04:15:57,300 --> 04:15:58,300
Okay, we got healed up.

5596
04:15:58,300 --> 04:16:00,300
Now we go upstairs.

5597
04:16:01,300 --> 04:16:05,300
Oh my god, it's Gami's colourful family.

5598
04:16:05,300 --> 04:16:06,300
Hello.

5599
04:16:06,300 --> 04:16:07,300
Check.

5600
04:16:07,300 --> 04:16:10,300
We are the tribe of the winds.

5601
04:16:10,300 --> 04:16:13,300
Long have we lived with the winds.

5602
04:16:13,300 --> 04:16:14,300
We have mastered them.

5603
04:16:14,300 --> 04:16:18,300
Now we join them together with the great winds at our backs.

5604
04:16:18,300 --> 04:16:19,300
We head for the skies.

5605
04:16:19,300 --> 04:16:24,300
Those who come seeking our power must play the note Zafa teachers.

5606
04:16:24,300 --> 04:16:26,300
Zafa teachers.

5607
04:16:26,300 --> 04:16:29,300
May they lead you onward to the power that you seek.

5608
04:16:30,300 --> 04:16:31,300
Aw.

5609
04:16:31,300 --> 04:16:34,300
You got the ocarina of the winds.

5610
04:16:34,300 --> 04:16:38,300
North, south, east and west, they're all just a breath away.

5611
04:16:40,300 --> 04:16:43,300
I do believe this is where the tribe of the winds once lived.

5612
04:16:43,300 --> 04:16:44,300
Hmm.

5613
04:16:44,300 --> 04:16:48,300
So they've left for the heavens and taken their element with them.

5614
04:16:48,300 --> 04:16:53,300
It looks like the wind element is beyond our reach for the time being.

5615
04:16:53,300 --> 04:16:55,300
We have no choice but to press on.

5616
04:16:55,300 --> 04:16:57,300
Let's get out of here.

5617
04:16:58,300 --> 04:17:02,300
So we did all of that for fucking nothing.

5618
04:17:02,300 --> 04:17:06,300
The element was not here, but at least we now have a clue to its whereabouts.

5619
04:17:06,300 --> 04:17:09,300
You must use the ocarina of wind to open a new path.

5620
04:17:09,300 --> 04:17:12,300
Well, there's no point in standing around.

5621
04:17:12,300 --> 04:17:14,300
Get that last element.

5622
04:17:14,300 --> 04:17:16,300
Last element.

5623
04:17:16,300 --> 04:17:18,300
We only have two.

5624
04:17:28,300 --> 04:17:30,300
Are we?

5625
04:17:33,300 --> 04:17:36,300
Um, are we supposed to go to the graveyard now?

5626
04:17:39,300 --> 04:17:40,300
Yes.

5627
04:17:42,300 --> 04:17:46,300
Ah, so that mysterious mark we've been seeing is the crest wind.

5628
04:17:46,300 --> 04:17:50,300
If you play the ocarina of wind, Zafa comes to pick you up and fly away.

5629
04:17:50,300 --> 04:17:54,300
That means we can have Zafa carry us to any other wind crest that we've seen.

5630
04:17:55,300 --> 04:17:57,300
Are you following me, Link?

5631
04:17:57,300 --> 04:17:59,300
Don't hurt your brain thinking about it.

5632
04:17:59,300 --> 04:18:02,300
Just give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.

5633
04:18:05,300 --> 04:18:06,300
That's just the map from...

5634
04:18:06,300 --> 04:18:08,300
That's just the map from a link to the past.

5635
04:18:08,300 --> 04:18:10,300
Is that actually?

5636
04:18:10,300 --> 04:18:12,300
Right, no?

5637
04:18:15,300 --> 04:18:17,300
Do you wonder what's going on?

5638
04:18:17,300 --> 04:18:19,300
I wonder what's going on too.

5639
04:18:20,300 --> 04:18:23,300
Uh, right.

5640
04:18:23,300 --> 04:18:25,300
We never actually...

5641
04:18:25,300 --> 04:18:27,300
Hello?

5642
04:18:27,300 --> 04:18:28,300
Stamp, stamp.

5643
04:18:28,300 --> 04:18:30,300
Even if we hire more people.

5644
04:18:30,300 --> 04:18:31,300
Welcome.

5645
04:18:31,300 --> 04:18:33,300
I'm selling issues of a helpful, adventurous guide.

5646
04:18:33,300 --> 04:18:36,300
It's called The Swordsman's News, and it's full of device right now.

5647
04:18:36,300 --> 04:18:37,300
You can buy the latest issue.

5648
04:18:37,300 --> 04:18:38,300
It's only 200.

5649
04:18:38,300 --> 04:18:39,300
200?

5650
04:18:39,300 --> 04:18:42,300
That's extortionate for a piece of paper and a bit of ink, mate.

5651
04:18:42,300 --> 04:18:46,300
I'm not lying, but that's a bit much, don't you think?

5652
04:18:46,300 --> 04:18:48,300
I'm going to see if we can get a bigger...

5653
04:18:50,300 --> 04:18:53,300
A bigger money pouch.

5654
04:18:56,300 --> 04:18:58,300
Use the Ocarina to fly to the lake.

5655
04:19:00,300 --> 04:19:01,300
Ice temple.

5656
04:19:01,300 --> 04:19:02,300
Oh, you're right.

5657
04:19:02,300 --> 04:19:03,300
Ice temple.

5658
04:19:05,300 --> 04:19:06,300
Wow.

5659
04:19:07,300 --> 04:19:08,300
Money, money, money.

5660
04:19:08,300 --> 04:19:09,300
Oh, wonderful.

5661
04:19:09,300 --> 04:19:10,300
They fit.

5662
04:19:10,300 --> 04:19:11,300
I'm so happy.

5663
04:19:17,300 --> 04:19:21,300
Oh, I can just keep using these guys over and over again.

5664
04:19:23,300 --> 04:19:24,300
I've got two red.

5665
04:19:24,300 --> 04:19:26,300
I assume red is like a major math update.

5666
04:19:29,300 --> 04:19:31,300
Okay, money pouch.

5667
04:19:32,300 --> 04:19:33,300
Total.

5668
04:19:33,300 --> 04:19:35,300
It's a golden total.

5669
04:19:35,300 --> 04:19:36,300
I like totals.

5670
04:19:37,300 --> 04:19:39,300
Gears, the sh...

5671
04:19:39,300 --> 04:19:41,300
Oh, the arcade's open.

5672
04:19:41,300 --> 04:19:42,300
What happened to the arcade?

5673
04:19:46,300 --> 04:19:47,300
Netto?

5674
04:19:48,300 --> 04:19:51,300
I can buy a bigger quiver?

5675
04:19:52,300 --> 04:19:53,300
I don't know.

5676
04:19:54,300 --> 04:19:56,300
I'll buy the boomerang.

5677
04:19:57,300 --> 04:20:01,300
That boomerang is not a bargain, but I'll take it since I need it.

5678
04:20:01,300 --> 04:20:02,300
Yeah, you're...

5679
04:20:03,300 --> 04:20:05,300
Well, you're a big spender.

5680
04:20:05,300 --> 04:20:08,300
Wait, does the boomerang get replaced by a money pouch?

5681
04:20:10,300 --> 04:20:12,300
How much is the money pouch?

5682
04:20:13,300 --> 04:20:14,300
600?

5683
04:20:15,300 --> 04:20:16,300
Eh?

5684
04:20:19,300 --> 04:20:20,300
What about you?

5685
04:20:21,300 --> 04:20:23,300
I don't have this kind of money.

5686
04:20:23,300 --> 04:20:25,300
I can't even hold it on my persons.

5687
04:20:26,300 --> 04:20:28,300
Jeez, you're extortionate, mate.

5688
04:20:28,300 --> 04:20:29,300
I'm a child.

5689
04:20:30,300 --> 04:20:32,300
Surely I get some discount.

5690
04:20:33,300 --> 04:20:35,300
I want to play games too.

5691
04:20:35,300 --> 04:20:36,300
What's in here?

5692
04:20:37,300 --> 04:20:38,300
What do you do?

5693
04:20:38,300 --> 04:20:39,300
Ah, he's finally open.

5694
04:20:39,300 --> 04:20:41,300
I can't wait to get cracking.

5695
04:20:41,300 --> 04:20:42,300
I don't know what this is.

5696
04:20:42,300 --> 04:20:44,300
That's like four languages.

5697
04:20:44,300 --> 04:20:45,300
What are these inflation rates?

5698
04:20:45,300 --> 04:20:47,300
Yeah, real child labor.

5699
04:20:47,300 --> 04:20:48,300
Speak.

5700
04:20:48,300 --> 04:20:49,300
Oh no, a customer.

5701
04:20:49,300 --> 04:20:51,300
Why did I even start a treasure game shop anyway?

5702
04:20:51,300 --> 04:20:52,300
Alright then.

5703
04:20:52,300 --> 04:20:55,300
Well, welcome to the fascinating world of treasure, blah blah blah.

5704
04:20:55,300 --> 04:20:58,300
In this wonderland, you can test your luck and win big bucks, maybe.

5705
04:20:58,300 --> 04:21:00,300
I don't really recommend it myself, however.

5706
04:21:00,300 --> 04:21:01,300
It's your wallet.

5707
04:21:01,300 --> 04:21:03,300
It's 10 rupees for a try.

5708
04:21:03,300 --> 04:21:05,300
I don't even have that money.

5709
04:21:06,300 --> 04:21:08,300
I fell over because I don't have the money.

5710
04:21:08,300 --> 04:21:09,300
Oh, good, good.

5711
04:21:09,300 --> 04:21:10,300
It really is your lucky day.

5712
04:21:10,300 --> 04:21:11,300
You don't have enough rupees.

5713
04:21:11,300 --> 04:21:14,300
I'm telling you, this gambling nonsense is no good.

5714
04:21:14,300 --> 04:21:16,300
You're better off without it.

5715
04:21:16,300 --> 04:21:20,300
Wait, Nintendo kind of pitching the masses, huh?

5716
04:21:20,300 --> 04:21:21,300
Right.

5717
04:21:23,300 --> 04:21:27,300
Can I learn a new move because I can do this?

5718
04:21:28,300 --> 04:21:30,300
Come again when you can jump further than any other.

5719
04:21:30,300 --> 04:21:31,300
Okay, my bad.

5720
04:21:31,300 --> 04:21:33,300
It doesn't have 10 bucks, could you glad?

5721
04:21:33,300 --> 04:21:38,300
If you aren't playing on a Game Boy, you can scam this game?

5722
04:21:41,300 --> 04:21:44,300
Now, the implications of that just don't work.

5723
04:21:47,300 --> 04:21:48,300
I don't...

5724
04:21:48,300 --> 04:21:50,300
No, this isn't where I'm supposed to go.

5725
04:21:51,300 --> 04:21:54,300
Even though I'm supposed to technically make my way to the air temple.

5726
04:21:54,300 --> 04:21:55,300
Oh, goodness.

5727
04:21:55,300 --> 04:21:56,300
Yay, okay, right.

5728
04:21:56,300 --> 04:21:58,300
I'm not supposed to be here yet.

5729
04:21:58,300 --> 04:22:02,300
We will now go top right, but not too top right.

5730
04:22:02,300 --> 04:22:03,300
Like middle right.

5731
04:22:03,300 --> 04:22:04,300
How about that?

5732
04:22:04,300 --> 04:22:05,300
We do middle right.

5733
04:22:05,300 --> 04:22:06,300
Deal.

5734
04:22:06,300 --> 04:22:07,300
We now have Pegasus boots.

5735
04:22:07,300 --> 04:22:08,300
What is that?

5736
04:22:09,300 --> 04:22:13,300
I don't know what that changes over here if we have access to Pegasus boots though.

5737
04:22:14,300 --> 04:22:17,300
Oh, I just fucking ruled them.

5738
04:22:18,300 --> 04:22:19,300
Fucking hell.

5739
04:22:19,300 --> 04:22:20,300
Fucking hell.

5740
04:22:20,300 --> 04:22:22,300
There's too much going on here.

5741
04:22:22,300 --> 04:22:23,300
I can't handle it.

5742
04:22:23,300 --> 04:22:24,300
I'm getting ruled.

5743
04:22:24,300 --> 04:22:25,300
I'm getting ruled.

5744
04:22:25,300 --> 04:22:27,300
Jeez, would you perish already?

5745
04:22:28,300 --> 04:22:30,300
Gosh, galley.

5746
04:22:32,300 --> 04:22:34,300
Jeez, I'm getting absolutely obliterated.

5747
04:22:34,300 --> 04:22:36,300
I think you can use a Steve Star.

5748
04:22:36,300 --> 04:22:39,300
You can scan the game by saving and checking and loading and clicking right.

5749
04:22:39,300 --> 04:22:41,300
Wow, I didn't know that.

5750
04:22:43,300 --> 04:22:46,300
I feel like there's something I must have access to.

5751
04:22:48,300 --> 04:22:49,300
This?

5752
04:22:49,300 --> 04:22:50,300
Oh, this looks okay.

5753
04:22:53,300 --> 04:22:55,300
Reach go a little to the right.

5754
04:22:55,300 --> 04:22:56,300
Oh.

5755
04:22:57,300 --> 04:22:58,300
Or not.

5756
04:23:01,300 --> 04:23:03,300
Oh, a new fairy.

5757
04:23:03,300 --> 04:23:04,300
Hello.

5758
04:23:04,300 --> 04:23:05,300
Hello.

5759
04:23:05,300 --> 04:23:06,300
I'm Link.

5760
04:23:07,300 --> 04:23:10,300
And I'd like to link up with you, baby girl.

5761
04:23:11,300 --> 04:23:12,300
Hi.

5762
04:23:13,300 --> 04:23:14,300
Wow.

5763
04:23:14,300 --> 04:23:16,300
Welcome to the adventure spring.

5764
04:23:16,300 --> 04:23:18,300
I have need of many rupees.

5765
04:23:18,300 --> 04:23:20,300
Please throw all of yours into the spring.

5766
04:23:20,300 --> 04:23:21,300
Sure.

5767
04:23:21,300 --> 04:23:22,300
All yours.

5768
04:23:22,300 --> 04:23:23,300
I don't need it.

5769
04:23:23,300 --> 04:23:24,300
Really?

5770
04:23:24,300 --> 04:23:26,300
You know, I don't even have one rupee on my person.

5771
04:23:26,300 --> 04:23:27,300
You know that.

5772
04:23:27,300 --> 04:23:29,300
If you do this, you will have absolutely no rupees left, right?

5773
04:23:29,300 --> 04:23:31,300
Will you really throw them all in?

5774
04:23:31,300 --> 04:23:32,300
Yes.

5775
04:23:32,300 --> 04:23:34,300
You are most kind.

5776
04:23:34,300 --> 04:23:36,300
I do not really need your rupees,

5777
04:23:36,300 --> 04:23:39,300
but I must reward such a kind adventure with some of my power.

5778
04:23:40,300 --> 04:23:41,300
You got a big wallet.

5779
04:23:44,300 --> 04:23:46,300
Complain and you shall receive.

5780
04:23:46,300 --> 04:23:48,300
May light shine on your quest.

5781
04:23:49,300 --> 04:23:51,300
May light shine on your quest.

5782
04:23:51,300 --> 04:23:53,300
Complain and you shall receive.

5783
04:23:53,300 --> 04:23:55,300
I got exactly what I wanted.

5784
04:23:58,300 --> 04:24:00,300
Wallet upgrade.

5785
04:24:00,300 --> 04:24:02,300
Don't mind if I do.

5786
04:24:02,300 --> 04:24:04,300
Literally exactly what I was needing.

5787
04:24:06,300 --> 04:24:07,300
Sorry.

5788
04:24:07,300 --> 04:24:09,300
I'm going to have to get like Gimli in this room.

5789
04:24:09,300 --> 04:24:11,300
Because she's going to absolutely hate shit.

5790
04:24:13,300 --> 04:24:14,300
Sorry.

5791
04:24:14,300 --> 04:24:16,300
I need to get rid of the plastic in the room, girl.

5792
04:24:16,300 --> 04:24:18,300
Because she'll chew the plastic.

5793
04:24:18,300 --> 04:24:20,300
Won't you get more?

5794
04:24:25,300 --> 04:24:27,300
I can chew the room, Gimli.

5795
04:24:28,300 --> 04:24:30,300
Then I'll put it in.

5796
04:24:31,300 --> 04:24:33,300
No, there'll be inside by the money.

5797
04:24:34,300 --> 04:24:36,300
I'll be coming right now.

5798
04:24:36,300 --> 04:24:37,300
Sorry.

5799
04:24:38,300 --> 04:24:39,300
Oh, and now I'll open the door

5800
04:24:39,300 --> 04:24:40,300
all the time.

5801
04:24:40,300 --> 04:24:42,300
She'll be interested when we're coming in.

5802
04:24:43,300 --> 04:24:45,300
I'm getting out of here.

5803
04:24:47,300 --> 04:24:48,300
Why are you here?

5804
04:24:48,300 --> 04:24:49,300
I need to go.

5805
04:24:51,300 --> 04:24:52,300
Come on.

5806
04:24:52,300 --> 04:24:54,300
You need to push through the door.

5807
04:24:55,300 --> 04:24:56,300
Oh, hold on.

5808
04:24:56,300 --> 04:24:58,300
I'm going to open the back gate.

5809
04:24:58,300 --> 04:25:00,300
Garden 4, I'll be back for a sec.

5810
04:25:24,300 --> 04:25:25,300
Sorry.

5811
04:25:54,300 --> 04:25:56,300
See these cats, man.

5812
04:25:56,300 --> 04:25:58,300
See these cats.

5813
04:26:00,300 --> 04:26:01,300
Oh.

5814
04:26:01,300 --> 04:26:02,300
She's coming out of me.

5815
04:26:02,300 --> 04:26:03,300
Oh, do you want out?

5816
04:26:03,300 --> 04:26:04,300
No, do you want...

5817
04:26:04,300 --> 04:26:05,300
What do you want?

5818
04:26:05,300 --> 04:26:06,300
I've already fed you.

5819
04:26:06,300 --> 04:26:08,300
Obviously she wants treats.

5820
04:26:09,300 --> 04:26:12,300
So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour

5821
04:26:12,300 --> 04:26:14,300
for her to come me out and annoy me.

5822
04:26:14,300 --> 04:26:15,300
So, she's not looking good.

5823
04:26:15,300 --> 04:26:16,300
She's not looking good.

5824
04:26:16,300 --> 04:26:17,300
She's not looking good.

5825
04:26:17,300 --> 04:26:19,300
So, I'm now reinforcing that behaviour

5826
04:26:19,300 --> 04:26:21,300
for her to come me out and annoy me.

5827
04:26:21,300 --> 04:26:23,300
So, she's not looking good.

5828
04:26:23,300 --> 04:26:24,300
She's not looking good.

5829
04:26:24,300 --> 04:26:26,300
Do you want to do pin stones?

5830
04:26:26,300 --> 04:26:27,300
No?

5831
04:26:27,300 --> 04:26:28,300
Oh, wait a minute.

5832
04:26:28,300 --> 04:26:30,300
We have the mitts.

5833
04:26:30,300 --> 04:26:31,300
No, we can do this.

5834
04:26:32,300 --> 04:26:33,300
Fuck.

5835
04:26:38,300 --> 04:26:40,300
That's just the money.

5836
04:26:41,300 --> 04:26:44,300
No, the game knows I'm too scared.

5837
04:26:47,300 --> 04:26:48,300
Well, there you go.

5838
04:26:48,300 --> 04:26:51,300
To keep out money for doing a wee bit of exploring.

5839
04:26:52,300 --> 04:26:54,300
Stranny new.

5840
04:26:54,300 --> 04:26:55,300
What?

5841
04:26:55,300 --> 04:26:56,300
What does it do?

5842
04:27:00,300 --> 04:27:03,300
Oh, she's going to start me on a hell of a lot more now.

5843
04:27:03,300 --> 04:27:04,300
Oh, well.

5844
04:27:05,300 --> 04:27:06,300
She...

5845
04:27:06,300 --> 04:27:08,300
Honestly, you can spoil a cat.

5846
04:27:08,300 --> 04:27:09,300
What's the worst of him?

5847
04:27:09,300 --> 04:27:10,300
Is it me?

5848
04:27:10,300 --> 04:27:11,300
I was a bit more...

5849
04:27:11,300 --> 04:27:12,300
There's none of them.

5850
04:27:12,300 --> 04:27:13,300
It's up or down.

5851
04:27:13,300 --> 04:27:14,300
I think I may actually be up.

5852
04:27:14,300 --> 04:27:15,300
You know what?

5853
04:27:15,300 --> 04:27:16,300
This way to the lake.

5854
04:27:16,300 --> 04:27:17,300
So, what's up?

5855
04:27:18,300 --> 04:27:19,300
Shhh.

5856
04:27:20,300 --> 04:27:22,300
Aw, I'm going the wrong way.

5857
04:27:23,300 --> 04:27:26,300
Mmm, I may have gone the wrong way.

5858
04:27:27,300 --> 04:27:29,300
I am going the wrong way.

5859
04:27:29,300 --> 04:27:31,300
I'm going to have to go all the way on.

5860
04:27:33,300 --> 04:27:35,300
Cats deserve all the treats.

5861
04:27:36,300 --> 04:27:38,300
I didn't mean to spoil them.

5862
04:27:38,300 --> 04:27:39,300
Weed gimmels.

5863
04:27:39,300 --> 04:27:40,300
Or we go.

5864
04:27:41,300 --> 04:27:43,300
My cat doesn't stop me at one.

5865
04:27:43,300 --> 04:27:46,300
Literally, I don't know how much you could hear

5866
04:27:46,300 --> 04:27:49,300
because I was away from the microphone and, like, standing at the door.

5867
04:27:49,300 --> 04:27:51,300
I was like, right, come in then.

5868
04:27:51,300 --> 04:27:52,300
Come in then, you win.

5869
04:27:52,300 --> 04:27:53,300
Come in.

5870
04:27:53,300 --> 04:27:55,300
And then she's looking at me like...

5871
04:27:56,300 --> 04:27:57,300
I'm like...

5872
04:27:58,300 --> 04:27:59,300
Bruv, you've literally won.

5873
04:27:59,300 --> 04:28:00,300
Wait.

5874
04:28:00,300 --> 04:28:01,300
No!

5875
04:28:01,300 --> 04:28:03,300
I thought I unlocked the shortcut there.

5876
04:28:03,300 --> 04:28:04,300
Oh, there it is.

5877
04:28:04,300 --> 04:28:05,300
There it is.

5878
04:28:05,300 --> 04:28:06,300
Okay, we're on the right track.

5879
04:28:07,300 --> 04:28:09,300
That ace thing, if you noticed it.

5880
04:28:09,300 --> 04:28:10,300
Whoa, whose house is this?

5881
04:28:11,300 --> 04:28:13,300
Oh, Tiddly Wings.

5882
04:28:13,300 --> 04:28:14,300
Let me dug here.

5883
04:28:14,300 --> 04:28:16,300
Oh, how's it going, wee man?

5884
04:28:16,300 --> 04:28:17,300
Rough, rough.

5885
04:28:17,300 --> 04:28:18,300
Oh, great.

5886
04:28:18,300 --> 04:28:19,300
Can I go talk to it?

5887
04:28:19,300 --> 04:28:21,300
You're right there, mate.

5888
04:28:21,300 --> 04:28:24,300
My master, Sokwell, has been coming home far too late to play with me.

5889
04:28:24,300 --> 04:28:25,300
I'm so lonely.

5890
04:28:25,300 --> 04:28:27,300
Okay, let's fuse these two.

5891
04:28:29,300 --> 04:28:33,300
Guys, I'm still recovering from the time that I forgot what duration was left.

5892
04:28:33,300 --> 04:28:34,300
My cat doesn't...

5893
04:28:38,300 --> 04:28:40,300
Minish Village?

5894
04:28:42,300 --> 04:28:43,300
No, not Minish Village.

5895
04:28:45,300 --> 04:28:47,300
Thanks for that, Tiddly Wings.

5896
04:28:47,300 --> 04:28:48,300
For that, we just...

5897
04:28:48,300 --> 04:28:49,300
Let me just find...

5898
04:28:56,300 --> 04:28:57,300
Can I run on water?

5899
04:28:58,300 --> 04:28:59,300
I don't think I can.

5900
04:29:00,300 --> 04:29:01,300
No, I can't.

5901
04:29:09,300 --> 04:29:12,300
The mayor's secret house, maybe?

5902
04:29:14,300 --> 04:29:16,300
I can't believe I forgot to freaking do that.

5903
04:29:16,300 --> 04:29:17,300
You know that?

5904
04:29:17,300 --> 04:29:19,300
Right, I'll remember this for now.

5905
04:29:22,300 --> 04:29:23,300
However...

5906
04:29:24,300 --> 04:29:25,300
Where the heck?

5907
04:29:26,300 --> 04:29:28,300
I'm a bit confuzzled.

5908
04:29:29,300 --> 04:29:31,300
No, you need to keep...

5909
04:29:31,300 --> 04:29:34,300
Left is the one that's not right, I think.

5910
04:29:34,300 --> 04:29:35,300
Now you go back down.

5911
04:29:35,300 --> 04:29:37,300
Right, I think maybe...

5912
04:29:37,300 --> 04:29:39,300
Is this the library quest yet?

5913
04:29:39,300 --> 04:29:43,300
I think the library quest is what needs to happen next.

5914
04:29:45,300 --> 04:29:46,300
Oh, sorry.

5915
04:29:46,300 --> 04:29:47,300
My apologies.

5916
04:29:47,300 --> 04:29:49,300
Oh, there's a staircase down there.

5917
04:29:52,300 --> 04:29:56,300
That mustache-y old guy strikes me somewhat unreliable.

5918
04:29:56,300 --> 04:29:59,300
There's something fishy about this room, too.

5919
04:30:02,300 --> 04:30:05,300
I hope I don't sound like I'm bragging, but I have a certain cabin in Lake.

5920
04:30:05,300 --> 04:30:07,300
It's a gorgeous little place where I go to enjoy my hot...

5921
04:30:07,300 --> 04:30:09,300
Okay, I think that's the hint.

5922
04:30:09,300 --> 04:30:10,300
You want to fuse?

5923
04:30:10,300 --> 04:30:11,300
Yes, I want to fuse.

5924
04:30:14,300 --> 04:30:15,300
Can I run on water?

5925
04:30:15,300 --> 04:30:17,300
Jesus, girl, confirm Gen 2.

5926
04:30:17,300 --> 04:30:22,300
Oh, your name's not Stroneys Remove Tornail, bro.

5927
04:30:24,300 --> 04:30:27,300
No way you called yourself that.

5928
04:30:28,300 --> 04:30:29,300
Holy sh...

5929
04:30:32,300 --> 04:30:34,300
Oh, my God.

5930
04:30:34,300 --> 04:30:35,300
Brutal.

5931
04:30:37,300 --> 04:30:38,300
Absolutely brutal.

5932
04:30:41,300 --> 04:30:42,300
The pick?

5933
04:30:42,300 --> 04:30:44,300
Is that my foot?

5934
04:30:45,300 --> 04:30:47,300
Is that a picture of my toe?

5935
04:30:49,300 --> 04:30:52,300
Have you got a picture of my toe as your profile picture?

5936
04:30:55,300 --> 04:30:57,300
No way.

5937
04:30:57,300 --> 04:30:59,300
That's funny as fuck.

5938
04:31:01,300 --> 04:31:03,300
That's amazing.

5939
04:31:05,300 --> 04:31:08,300
Yeah, I would talk about the experience.

5940
04:31:08,300 --> 04:31:11,300
This person loving here is the mayor, very important.

5941
04:31:11,300 --> 04:31:14,300
Doesn't it just sound also official?

5942
04:31:14,300 --> 04:31:17,300
The mayor, like, strange mask sometimes even makes his own.

5943
04:31:17,300 --> 04:31:19,300
There's a mayor evil.

5944
04:31:21,300 --> 04:31:24,300
Just for a week, okay, okay, okay.

5945
04:31:24,300 --> 04:31:27,300
I would talk about, like, what happened in that,

5946
04:31:27,300 --> 04:31:31,300
but if I'm going to be honest, it was pretty, like...

5947
04:31:32,300 --> 04:31:35,300
A rough experience, so I'd rather just...

5948
04:31:35,300 --> 04:31:36,300
It's TFE.

5949
04:31:36,300 --> 04:31:39,300
Oh, you about it, because I had a bad time.

5950
04:31:41,300 --> 04:31:43,300
But I'm okay, so you don't have to worry.

5951
04:31:43,300 --> 04:31:47,300
No doom, no doom, but it was pretty...

5952
04:31:47,300 --> 04:31:48,300
Not nice.

5953
04:31:48,300 --> 04:31:50,300
So I don't really want to talk about it.

5954
04:31:52,300 --> 04:31:54,300
Right, I think the cabin in the lake was a hint.

5955
04:31:54,300 --> 04:31:56,300
There's no way it was.

5956
04:31:56,300 --> 04:31:59,300
Under construction, digging, prohibited.

5957
04:31:59,300 --> 04:32:01,300
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do if I do this, then?

5958
04:32:01,300 --> 04:32:03,300
Yeah, you're going to fart and clap.

5959
04:32:07,300 --> 04:32:12,300
The bandage gets changed, I guess, technically, after this room.

5960
04:32:13,300 --> 04:32:15,300
There's, like, a chest here.

5961
04:32:16,300 --> 04:32:18,300
Ah, I'm actually so smart.

5962
04:32:18,300 --> 04:32:20,300
I'm, like, 10 out of 10 smart.

5963
04:32:21,300 --> 04:32:23,300
There's a spider there.

5964
04:32:23,300 --> 04:32:25,300
He humped me!

5965
04:32:26,300 --> 04:32:28,300
He wasn't even hurting me. It's just...

5966
04:32:28,300 --> 04:32:30,300
It's a huntsman!

5967
04:32:30,300 --> 04:32:33,300
They don't hurt, but they just, like, look terrifying and stuff.

5968
04:32:33,300 --> 04:32:36,300
Where on earth am I going?

5969
04:32:36,300 --> 04:32:38,300
This is under the town.

5970
04:32:39,300 --> 04:32:41,300
Oh, we're getting red pieces, though.

5971
04:32:41,300 --> 04:32:43,300
I'm not complaining.

5972
04:32:44,300 --> 04:32:45,300
And 100 rupees.

5973
04:32:45,300 --> 04:32:46,300
Hold on a minute.

5974
04:32:46,300 --> 04:32:48,300
Hold on a minute.

5975
04:32:49,300 --> 04:32:51,300
Oh, something's happening.

5976
04:32:51,300 --> 04:32:54,300
I don't know what the heck all this is, but I'll take it.

5977
04:32:55,300 --> 04:32:57,300
Looks like it's a team effort.

5978
04:32:57,300 --> 04:33:00,300
The library quests, by flying to the lake,

5979
04:33:00,300 --> 04:33:02,300
you can't reach the Minish house otherwise.

5980
04:33:03,300 --> 04:33:05,300
Let's fly to the lake.

5981
04:33:09,300 --> 04:33:11,300
Ah, that's really good.

5982
04:33:11,300 --> 04:33:13,300
This is a lot of digging.

5983
04:33:14,300 --> 04:33:17,300
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a wood.

5984
04:33:17,300 --> 04:33:18,300
Diggy, diggy, wood.

5985
04:33:18,300 --> 04:33:20,300
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy.

5986
04:33:22,300 --> 04:33:23,300
There's a chest.

5987
04:33:24,300 --> 04:33:25,300
Wow, three red pieces.

5988
04:33:25,300 --> 04:33:27,300
Don't mind if I do, honestly.

5989
04:33:31,300 --> 04:33:33,300
Under construction.

5990
04:33:33,300 --> 04:33:34,300
Yes, that's fine.

5991
04:33:34,300 --> 04:33:37,300
Oh, we can go into the back of the bakery if we get small.

5992
04:33:38,300 --> 04:33:39,300
Can I go in here yet?

5993
04:33:42,300 --> 04:33:46,300
But I can't access the thing.

5994
04:33:54,300 --> 04:33:55,300
I've already forgotten what I'm supposed to do.

5995
04:33:55,300 --> 04:33:56,300
I'm to fly.

5996
04:33:58,300 --> 04:33:59,300
I'm to fly.

5997
04:34:00,300 --> 04:34:01,300
I'm to fly.

5998
04:34:06,300 --> 04:34:08,300
Ah, I am.

5999
04:34:08,300 --> 04:34:09,300
What the heck?

6000
04:34:16,300 --> 04:34:17,300
Hello.

6001
04:34:17,300 --> 04:34:18,300
Oh hi, a visitor.

6002
04:34:18,300 --> 04:34:19,300
How are you?

6003
04:34:19,300 --> 04:34:20,300
But you have phoned me.

6004
04:34:20,300 --> 04:34:22,300
The wisest of the wisest of whys.

6005
04:34:23,300 --> 04:34:24,300
You...

6006
04:34:24,300 --> 04:34:25,300
What?

6007
04:34:25,300 --> 04:34:27,300
You want to enter the temple you can see in the lake.

6008
04:34:27,300 --> 04:34:29,300
They call that place the temple of droplets.

6009
04:34:29,300 --> 04:34:33,300
I've heard rumors that one Minish actually did find a way long ago.

6010
04:34:33,300 --> 04:34:36,300
That Minish is Elder Libri Rari.

6011
04:34:36,300 --> 04:34:40,300
And he is in semi-retirement in Towns Library.

6012
04:34:40,300 --> 04:34:41,300
Yes!

6013
04:34:41,300 --> 04:34:42,300
Okay, thank you.

6014
04:34:42,300 --> 04:34:44,300
Towns Library.

6015
04:34:44,300 --> 04:34:45,300
There we go.

6016
04:34:45,300 --> 04:34:50,300
Luckily we just picked up that piece because we can actually use it.

6017
04:34:50,300 --> 04:34:52,300
What does it do?

6018
04:34:52,300 --> 04:34:55,300
That is at the swamp.

6019
04:34:57,300 --> 04:34:59,300
We should go grab it.

6020
04:34:59,300 --> 04:35:01,300
Yes, we will go grab it.

6021
04:35:01,300 --> 04:35:03,300
Hey, they fit perfectly.

6022
04:35:03,300 --> 04:35:04,300
Yes they do.

6023
04:35:04,300 --> 04:35:05,300
What are the odds?

6024
04:35:05,300 --> 04:35:06,300
Can I trade you again?

6025
04:35:06,300 --> 04:35:07,300
No.

6026
04:35:07,300 --> 04:35:09,300
He lives in the Towns Library.

6027
04:35:09,300 --> 04:35:11,300
Towns Library.

6028
04:35:11,300 --> 04:35:12,300
Library.

6029
04:35:12,300 --> 04:35:13,300
Library.

6030
04:35:13,300 --> 04:35:14,300
Let's go.

6031
04:35:20,300 --> 04:35:22,300
I still have the best feet for me.

6032
04:35:22,300 --> 04:35:23,300
Oh, sorry.

6033
04:35:23,300 --> 04:35:24,300
I accidentally backed out.

6034
04:35:24,300 --> 04:35:26,300
I picked that up though.

6035
04:35:28,300 --> 04:35:29,300
Stop.

6036
04:35:33,300 --> 04:35:36,300
Travel to the library.

6037
04:35:36,300 --> 04:35:38,300
Absolutely.

6038
04:35:38,300 --> 04:35:40,300
Let's see what we're working with.

6039
04:35:40,300 --> 04:35:41,300
Yes!

6040
04:35:43,300 --> 04:35:45,300
We can get in.

6041
04:35:45,300 --> 04:35:46,300
It took us long enough.

6042
04:35:46,300 --> 04:35:47,300
Hello.

6043
04:35:47,300 --> 04:35:51,300
Who is blocking that entire town?

6044
04:35:51,300 --> 04:35:52,300
Oh look!

6045
04:35:52,300 --> 04:35:55,300
Oh look at all the wee baby footprints from the minnish.

6046
04:36:00,300 --> 04:36:04,300
Sometimes these books move on their own, I've seen it with my own two eyes

6047
04:36:04,300 --> 04:36:07,300
and don't tell me I'm crazy, I ain't crazy.

6048
04:36:08,300 --> 04:36:10,300
Oh he makes quite a unique noise.

6049
04:36:10,300 --> 04:36:11,300
Right.

6050
04:36:11,300 --> 04:36:13,300
Let us begin.

6051
04:36:18,300 --> 04:36:21,300
He was raging at them books honestly.

6052
04:36:21,300 --> 04:36:22,300
It was down here.

6053
04:36:22,300 --> 04:36:25,300
I can't swim so I can't do anything.

6054
04:36:26,300 --> 04:36:27,300
And I'm gridlocked.

6055
04:36:27,300 --> 04:36:29,300
Okay I can't do anything yet because I don't know.

6056
04:36:29,300 --> 04:36:30,300
Oh there's a wee guy down there!

6057
04:36:30,300 --> 04:36:31,300
Hiya!

6058
04:36:31,300 --> 04:36:32,300
Americaia!

6059
04:36:32,300 --> 04:36:33,300
Hiya!

6060
04:36:39,300 --> 04:36:40,300
Clean this.

6061
04:36:40,300 --> 04:36:41,300
Hello!

6062
04:36:42,300 --> 04:36:44,300
Oh we can clean this, find the books.

6063
04:36:44,300 --> 04:36:45,300
Hey hey, it's no good, no good at all.

6064
04:36:45,300 --> 04:36:47,300
The humans have checked some books out of the library.

6065
04:36:47,300 --> 04:36:50,300
Thanks to them, none can get back to the elder.

6066
04:36:50,300 --> 04:36:53,300
How, I'm so worried, I'm sure the library knows the books.

6067
04:36:53,300 --> 04:36:58,300
I wish they were big, why I'd walk right up and ask if we're in them books where.

6068
04:36:58,300 --> 04:36:59,300
Okay.

6069
04:36:59,300 --> 04:37:01,300
You want a few pieces, yes please.

6070
04:37:03,300 --> 04:37:04,300
Okay.

6071
04:37:04,300 --> 04:37:06,300
He's just happy you got to meet his mummy.

6072
04:37:09,300 --> 04:37:10,300
Oh.

6073
04:37:10,300 --> 04:37:14,300
A little cavern has been unlocked.

6074
04:37:14,300 --> 04:37:17,300
Any cavern unlocked?

6075
04:37:18,300 --> 04:37:24,300
Hmm it fits perfectly.

6076
04:37:25,300 --> 04:37:30,300
We're like two peas in a pod for how did they fit.

6077
04:37:31,300 --> 04:37:34,300
It's for lunking ahoy.

6078
04:37:34,300 --> 04:37:37,300

6079
04:37:37,300 --> 04:37:38,300

6103
04:39:43,540 --> 04:39:47,580
I don't think shaking the bookcase will make it fall this presents an interesting

6104
04:39:47,580 --> 04:39:53,540
problem we didn't see if only we already knew what to do

6105
04:39:54,140 --> 04:40:00,660

6108
04:40:11,580 --> 04:40:14,860
well cuz he needs to come back so the cat will swipe at you so if you get a bit

6109
04:40:14,860 --> 04:40:21,660
too close why dodged it correct what that really startled me everything's

around the cat look at it shaking his little butt they actually put so much

6112
04:40:34,060 --> 04:40:38,380
detail into this game they could have just done like swipe motion on cat but

6113
04:40:38,380 --> 04:40:44,940
no they like actually did the they did the nature of the cat correctly okay we

6114
04:40:44,940 --> 04:40:49,820
have obtained the first book you got a library book called the hurry on me

6115
04:40:49,820 --> 04:40:56,540
sorry there's one of three books because this game follows the classic rules

6116
04:40:56,540 --> 04:41:08,180
which is as you know wait oh it's open I did not realize it was open almost

6117
04:41:08,180 --> 04:41:17,340
the cat under the book cats are really they're such a silly animal I don't

6118
04:41:17,340 --> 04:41:21,780
sense weird to say but they hate their pain and stuff so if there's something

6119
04:41:21,780 --> 04:41:29,460
wrong with them they won't even tell you oh hello oh here we are you've come to

your dreams we allow you to fight grand monsters without any danger this is our

6123
04:41:44,900 --> 04:41:49,180
unique same risk but I can't say it if you dispatch the monster skillfully enough

6124
04:41:49,180 --> 04:41:52,820
you might get something nice now even though there's only a simulation it's

6125
04:41:52,820 --> 04:41:56,420
still not for the faint of heart if you should die in the simulation why then

6126
04:41:56,420 --> 04:42:02,460
well I don't know it's never happened did I get a heart for doing this see so

6127

possess I don't know how anyone plays legendary on scour them I don't some

6450
05:23:57,600 --> 05:24:01,520
people like always oh I can't believe it people have different preferences to me

6451
05:24:01,520 --> 05:24:06,360
shocking behavior and but like I just enjoy like playing a wee story and like

6452
05:24:06,360 --> 05:24:10,400
going through it I'll say that as if I didn't really enjoy Elden Ring with you

6453
05:24:10,400 --> 05:24:16,800
guys though and so but I only enjoyed Elden Ring because you guys can hold my

6454
05:24:16,800 --> 05:24:22,520
hand through it but like I enjoy like a kind of calm like fun experience it's

6455
05:24:22,520 --> 05:24:26,520
just casual and like you gotta be story and it's like so cute and you can admire

6456
05:24:26,520 --> 05:24:33,280
the the visuals you can admire the sound design the music all of that I just

6457
05:24:33,280 --> 05:24:38,120
think it's rather lovely you know I didn't want to be sitting you know

6458
05:24:38,120 --> 05:24:44,320
playing dark souls replaying I say that I'm kind of saying dark souls but I

6459
05:24:44,320 --> 05:24:47,560
just play Elden Ring and get carried through it so I can't really check anything

6460
05:24:47,560 --> 05:24:56,640
I need to just send this single wow I do that's actually quite humorous um okay

6461
05:24:56,640 --> 05:25:05,160
now we have a platform so we can just I'm sure there's a switch over here often

6462
05:25:05,160 --> 05:25:10,280
they cheese it with self-archer paralysis today we're learning the strap

6463
05:25:10,280 --> 05:25:17,000
hey you yeah you oh sorry well I got what I wanted so I'm actually not that

6464
05:25:17,000 --> 05:25:23,720
sorry is it upper left sorry I'll be faster to manually swim to do this

6465
05:25:23,720 --> 05:25:30,760
it looks like it's up okay it's up or right sorry I totally know my left and

6466
05:25:30,880 --> 05:25:32,880
oh

6467
05:25:36,880 --> 05:25:46,680
Lily pad hello it's all the way at the start

6468
05:25:49,920 --> 05:25:54,120
well excuse me

6469
05:25:55,120 --> 05:26:02,640
how was I supposed to know it was gonna despawn if I wasn't standing on it

6470
05:26:02,640 --> 05:26:11,120
excuse me mr. Lily pad as if I had just missed you from business oh my god

6471
05:26:11,120 --> 05:26:18,880
that's so far to come back with it ah right lesson learned don't go off screen

6472
05:26:18,880 --> 05:26:25,680
without being on the Lily pad oh hell yeah like when Stevie was playing the

6473
05:26:25,680 --> 05:26:31,680
crab treasure game I said this before I thought it was just a casual fun game

6474
05:26:31,680 --> 05:26:37,440
no it's supposed to be like dark souls like I like what cuz I was gonna play it

6475
05:26:37,440 --> 05:26:43,640
and oh I did manage to watch some more about true gameplay I think we can do a

6476
05:26:43,680 --> 05:26:51,040
about true gameplay so a full house is when you have three of any card and two

6477
05:26:51,040 --> 05:26:58,320
of any card and oh I'm gonna get hurt here my apologies oh I didn't need the

6478
05:26:58,320 --> 05:27:08,440
house okay stop geez and straight is when you have a missing one from a flush

6479
05:27:09,040 --> 05:27:15,000
no a flush is when you have a missing one but a straight flush is when you have

6480
05:27:15,000 --> 05:27:22,280
five that are correct in the sequence and then you can do like two doubles or

6481
05:27:22,280 --> 05:27:29,400
you can play quads and so I think I think we can successfully do a

6482
05:27:29,480 --> 05:27:42,200
about true stream without perishing too much what's this what's a royal flush when

6483
05:27:42,200 --> 05:27:52,520
the flush has King Queen and Jack in it I'm gonna get turds dropped on my head I

6484
05:27:52,520 --> 05:27:59,040
think I don't know I'm not sure but I have enough knowledge to try and win at

6485
05:27:59,040 --> 05:28:03,480
the game a ball true is one of those games where if you lose you lose but

6486
05:28:03,480 --> 05:28:22,360
it's fine I'm gonna slide in any I'm gonna sneeze sorry sorry and down Ray

6487
05:28:22,360 --> 05:28:36,560
south west go down Ray and then south and then west and then off okay flush is

6488
05:28:36,560 --> 05:28:44,200
seems to straight is in any sequence royal flushes a oops okay I got close

6489
05:28:44,200 --> 05:28:53,920
close to the answer was a perfect place to see what a wonderful scene yes also

6490
05:28:53,920 --> 05:29:05,600
I'm such a kawaii name game whichever huh I'm so kawaii name no short to scare

6491
05:29:05,600 --> 05:29:08,640
yes you're more than welcome you're more than welcome I'll sneeze in your open

6492
05:29:08,640 --> 05:29:16,880
mouth anytime you need not ask with me for I will deliver I cannot do anything

6493
05:29:16,880 --> 05:29:29,640
about him I'm covered in dookie I went brown there lol actually covered in dookie

6494
05:29:29,640 --> 05:29:41,800
they're not I mean I have to leave now link where are you are you so under me it's

6495
05:29:41,800 --> 05:29:45,840
so dark I can't see my beak in front of my face and watch your step I don't want

6496
05:29:45,840 --> 05:29:50,920
you to trip over anything very dark I'm not supposed to be able to see at this

6497
05:29:51,640 --> 05:30:01,120
sure oh well I'll can see no actually get shown I'm getting rolled in the

6498
05:30:01,120 --> 05:30:05,080
child's game can't believe it I'm so excited for you up in the next month

6499
05:30:05,080 --> 05:30:11,080
and cameo we can start collecting our gamers oh not these guys these guys are

6500
05:30:11,080 --> 05:30:19,760
actually pretty troublesome especially when there's a room full of them hurt

6501
05:30:19,760 --> 05:30:30,400
myself by accident I suppose on purpose what have I got to hell I'll maybe do a

6502
05:30:30,400 --> 05:30:39,640
bit of exploring after this because now once we are not whoa okay we're we're

6503
05:30:39,640 --> 05:30:46,720
almost finished the dungeon if we've got that and we'll definitely go exploring

6504
05:30:46,720 --> 05:30:50,840
after this one to get like fill hearts and all the items and stuff because I

6505
05:30:50,840 --> 05:30:56,760
think we're supposed to have more health by now and like do like more of the

6506
05:30:56,760 --> 05:31:00,720
swimming because now the swimming's unlocked and digging is unlocked we have

6507
05:31:00,720 --> 05:31:11,480
so much more access to stuff unless we go get the last item of course sunlight

6508
05:31:11,480 --> 05:31:16,600
once we get some sunlight or melt the ice the element is as good as ours okay

6509
05:31:16,600 --> 05:31:26,640
that's perfect that's okay strongy we can believe it that you can be rolled in a

6510
05:31:26,640 --> 05:31:31,240
child's game can't I was so good at least I know where to get all the element of

6511
05:31:31,240 --> 05:31:35,800
fruit this time I still cannot believe I reflow and went back and watch my

6512
05:31:35,800 --> 05:31:41,160
gameplay to freaking do one by one I was convinced it was the chinchilla glitch

6513
05:31:41,160 --> 05:31:46,960

6654
05:49:20,600 --> 05:49:34,920

6655
05:49:34,920 --> 05:49:48,360
is the second one. Okay, I can handle that. We already got them. Oh, things are falling

6656
05:49:48,360 --> 05:50:09,520
on my head. I don't like it. Easy. Take it easy, buddy. Oh, is he just spamming it? I'll

6657
05:50:09,520 --> 05:50:20,480
take it. If you're just spamming it, I'll take it. Is it a dry bite? Wow, we did it. We

6658
05:50:20,480 --> 05:50:32,600
have 10 minutes to spare for Shabby. Let's go. We get the element. What is it? The water?

6659
05:50:32,600 --> 05:50:46,080
It must be water. Ice element doesn't make sense. You got the water element. Water quenches

6660
05:50:46,080 --> 05:50:51,640
thirst, ends droughts and nourishes life. The water element is the embodiment of that power.

6661
05:50:51,640 --> 05:51:00,040
I love and a heart. Oh, we can go to that man. That will teach us properly. One, two, three, four.

6662
05:51:00,040 --> 05:51:11,600
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get the heck out of here. I won't be here anymore. Here we go. Shabby's live

6663
05:51:11,600 --> 05:51:27,240
right now. Wait, I thought it was a 10. Oh, it is 10 already. Oh, young one. Child who

6664
05:51:27,240 --> 05:51:36,880
seeks to aid the princess of Hyrule. My name is Gustaf. I was king of Hyrule countless ages ago.

6665
05:51:36,880 --> 05:51:49,000
Stand before me. Only then will the path be open to you. Huh, was that just a dream? He said he

6666
05:51:49,000 --> 05:51:55,400
was the king of Hyrule. Wait, look at your map, Link. There's something marked on it. Huh, I guess

6667
05:51:55,400 --> 05:52:00,760
that means it wasn't a dream? We should head there once we've infused your sword with that element.

6668
05:52:01,200 --> 05:52:06,640
To the elemental sanctuary at once. Okay, then it's graveyard, then it's

6669
05:52:06,640 --> 05:52:17,440
airtop, and then we're done. Yeah, we made some fast progress. Holy moly. I definitely think we

6670
05:52:17,440 --> 05:52:32,560
should be exploring now. Because we're definitely getting close to end game content. What time is

6671
05:52:32,560 --> 05:52:41,880
that? Okay, I am going to end there. And then for members, I am going to do a membership stream.

6672
05:52:42,800 --> 05:52:49,920
In like 10 minutes, I will put it up. You cannot see the stream right now because I've not put it up.

6673
05:52:49,920 --> 05:52:58,160
But don't worry, I will put it up. If you give me 10 minutes after I end the stream for any members

6674
05:52:58,160 --> 05:53:06,840
of the channel, we are going to be doing the forbidden, the forbidden tier list. I'm not sure

6675
05:53:06,840 --> 05:53:21,400
how long that's gonna take. We'll see, we'll see. As for any, any what? Any notes? I'm going to try

6676
05:53:21,400 --> 05:53:33,920
and upload my special 2000 thank you. Today, I'm also going to try and see if I tomorrow I can

6677
05:53:33,920 --> 05:53:38,120
upload the first collab with Mimosa. She has been waiting so patiently. I mean, Denpah's been

6678
05:53:38,120 --> 05:53:44,480
waiting patiently. And so is this third person that I haven't told yous who I'm collabing with. I

6679
05:53:44,480 --> 05:53:53,400
don't think. Your hint is like wolf. Right, customization, redirect, and to none other than

6680
05:53:53,400 --> 05:54:00,360
Shibi Quarrenboom. Oh, Shibi is doing smash her pass with Toma Keys. I actually don't know much

6681
05:54:00,360 --> 05:54:07,880
about Toma Keys, but if Shibi knows her, then we are in good company. Shibi has fantastic friends.

6682
05:54:07,880 --> 05:54:13,880
Right, in 10 minutes without strany. Yes, give me 10 minutes. I'm going to see if I can drop

6683
05:54:13,880 --> 05:54:18,240
a loaf of bread. I'm going to make a cup of tea and all of that. But give me a few minutes and then

6684
05:54:18,240 --> 05:54:23,200
the stream will pop up. Don't worry. For those of you who are unable to member, please don't worry.

6685
05:54:23,200 --> 05:54:28,400
I always have free content daily and not only are you getting the stream, you're also getting a

6686
05:54:28,440 --> 05:54:34,640
video today as well. That will come up on YouTube soon to you. Thank you so so much for hanging

6687
05:54:34,640 --> 05:54:43,640
and we will finish this fantastic childhood game tomorrow. Nothing, nothing but fantastic nostalgia

6688
05:54:43,640 --> 05:54:52,720
this stream has been. And I will see you, if I don't see you in 10 minutes, I will see you tomorrow

6689
05:54:52,960 --> 05:54:58,400
to finish this fantastic game. Thank you so so much, Reflings. Please do say hi to Shibi for me.

6690
05:54:58,400 --> 05:55:04,480
I'm going to run away and drop a bomb in the toilet. Well, you guys can get comfy with Shibi, okay?

6691
05:55:04,480 --> 05:55:08,400
Thank you so so much, Reflings. See you until tomorrow or until 10 minutes, okay?
