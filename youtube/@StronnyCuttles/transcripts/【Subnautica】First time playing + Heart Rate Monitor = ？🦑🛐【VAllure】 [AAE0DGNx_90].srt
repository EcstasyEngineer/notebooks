they have a fear of the ocean um I don't know about you but I know how to swim so I'm not really

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,800
scared of the ocean like maybe if a wall of jellyfish I was up against and they all stung me on the

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,600
way past like yeah oh it's that 60 up oh well guess who gets to go through them because I was the

151
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,080
inventory tab okay please use this thank you and then well I guess I don't need food

152
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,600
so put it all away if we're gonna go in an adventure let's make it count sorry I keep

164
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,480

165
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,880
has gone too far sorry right cave sulfur let's get one big breath of air and let's go in

166
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,840
hello is there any cave sulfur oh yeah oh yeah piss what are you oh yeah piss what are you

171
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:51,840
hmm right did I get my cave sulfur I don't think I did I need my repair tool is this on fire

172
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:01,280
no it's just smoking right I'll keep smoking until I do it right we acquired fiber mesh

173
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,560
strong natural fiber and it's comfy oh we're getting a new fit fit check fit check

174
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:16,480
what did I acid mushroom and copper or make a battery battery oh I only got one quartz

175
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,600
so that wasn't enough I need a salt deposit okay we can

176
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,680
increase the local radiation levels trend is consistent for damage to the aurora's drive

177
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,040
core sustained during planet four uh-huh

178
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,000

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
because I keep thinking I'm in a menu but I'm not in a menace

um come come for the cave come for the cave I come for the cave I need a cave I need to

189
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,840
sign down right so I went life size so never go right size okay so we're just under 360

190
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,560
we've already been here let's go get some air and then go back down again stuff doesn't despawn

191
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:12,400
okay let's go okay cave sulfur yellow cavern secret cavern secret cavern I'm gonna grab the

192
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,960
quartz because it makes something that I don't know yeah what is this copper is an essential

193
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,560
component of all powered equipment okay your probability of survival has just increased to

194
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,920
unlikely but flaws detecting sulfur deposits in the local cave systems sulfur is an essential

195
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,840
yes I need sulfur so I'm trying to maintain the oxygen bar as well where's the sulfur a common

196
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,520
complication for cave divers is massive orientation yes yes so the based wiring

197
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,440
kits are an essential component of many habitat modules okay okay no that's fine that's fine right

198
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,040
we'll get some oxygen and we'll go back in here they are are they playing with the mail

199
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,920
give me that you bitch give me a little stop playing with the mail you don't need it the way I do

200
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,880
okay right if you're gonna go in that cave that's literally where I'm trying to go bro

201
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,080
or is it a dolphin that looks rather friendly honestly right did I pick up sulfur yet

202
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,640
maybe making noises behind me we creepy thing you

203
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,480
wait did I not get oxygen how am I already out there have I been mucking about

204
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,320
please tell me I picked up sulfur in this cavern oh yeah

205
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,840
right that's a lot seriously that's a lot

206
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,080
where's my home pod it's over here and before I dry already you didn't get max oxygen

207
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,680
ah it doesn't even go right away okay okay okay okay let him get up let him get up I love the

208

what was that what was that what was that what was that what was that what was that what was that

210
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640

211
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
you just go back doing in that water sun I'm no bother in you you're no bother in me

picked that up but she said it was in there Ken what Athena this is what I think about you Hen

217
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,680
standard or two if I make another one is it gonna double up my oxygen

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,080
if you leave them alone they'll leave you alone okay they bite okay

219
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,240

gloves on I don't have microchips I don't have goggles and I don't have an outfit oh yeah put me

227
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:22,080

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,280
extract our precious resources whether we like it or not this just sounds like our word with

263
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,680
extra steps suggests this biome supports extensive biodiversity yeah you're not kidding the number

264
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,240
of small cave networks you are not yep I'd say this is fucking advanced I too is right one more big

265
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:06,720
pump of oxygen and we're off let's see what's down here okay the little red guys we need to get some

266
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,480
sulfur out of them we're just gonna gently treat sulfur out of their bodies okay but we love

267
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:29,520
yes but why not whoa it's purple hello oh that's not good hello can you fart sulfur

270
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:51,200
ow is that not what we're supposed to kill pentane one thank you for the three months membership

271
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,960
you can actually find an egg and hatch a cuttlefish to be your pet real I'd believe it

272
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,640
oxygen oxygen yes um

273
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,960
Scott bugs don't who has sulfur wrong fish oh my gosh

that's how you guys I'm colorblind no I'm not I'm fucking great let me go back

275
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,440
oh gosh are you serious the pod is like 300 meters that way I feel like we're better just going

276
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,480
no right right right hold on hold on we'll go to the pod and we'll go back into that cavern

277
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,800
because I know where it is the red one the red was that not red am I going mental was that not red

278
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,760
schizophrenia okay we'll swim back to the pod and then we'll go in that cavern because I know

279
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:45,840
where that actual cavern is where that sulfide is that's what he said sodium chloride no it's not

290
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:25,280
I think they do I don't think they do right I got cave sulfur I just need a rubber silicone

291
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,000
and titanium well good thing I'm can you close that please oh see what unstuck there's a button

294
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,160
oh yeah oh yeah it like gravitate such shit fuck use the force

295
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,280
I put secondary systems online uh-huh running full environment diagnostic and

all right we need one of these

420
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,920

what do I

454
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,240
strong actually mentioned this game has no auto save oh

455
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,640
say no more the game has no auto save and why would they do a silly thing like that

456
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:37,440
why would they do a silly thing like that right I'm not going to be intimidated anymore by these

457
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,840
stinky stinky things I'm going to go around okay I don't know what's past them but

458
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,000
I've had enough of them dictating their attack and other fishes

459
00:54:50,160 --> 00:55:00,400
I'm the music don't worry I've got the music covered oh crap the sunlight's going

460
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,360

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,360
no no no you don't have to do that I promise you oh no don't do that that's not nice hold on

462
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,360

463
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:29,280
hmm okay there's land that's good okay I've got my C M a n m a n m a n m a n m a n m a knees

464
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,060
okay

465
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:43,060
to an unknown environmental biome. Passing 100 meters. Oxygen efficiency decreased.

466
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,060
Ah.

467
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,060
Woo! Can I come in? Beep boop beep boop. Cut open to access. Cut open.

468
00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:02,060
Oh. Right. Cut open. With what? With what would I cut this open? Hmm.

469
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:08,060
Strongly no. Wait. Good attempt. You'll need that for later.

470
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,060
You need a laser cutter. Oh. Okay.

471
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:24,060
Right. I'll try to remember this location. Need a new tool. How does one acquire a new tool in this game?

472
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:28,060
Other than, I guess, just going in.

473
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:36,060
I said there was a cavern entrance? I assume there's a new item in it that I need for my stonks.

474
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,060
Right. I'll see what's in here. I'm ready. I'm jumping them.

475
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:50,060
You think they're going to jump me? Can fart in someone else's face? It's not mine to do.

476
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:58,060
Scanning wreckages unlocks new recipes. Got a recipe. Seamoth fragment.

477
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,060
Oh! Don't do that! Fuck me!

478
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,060
What was that? Was he big or small? I've already lost him.

479
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,060
Is he for real? Comes and bites me and then fucks off? Are you serious? Peat off.

480
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:21,060
Yeah, I'd believe that.

481
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,060
Whoa! Whoa!

482
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:35,060
Oh, that's too deep for me. I need upgrades. I need upgrades. That's too deep.

483
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:42,060
That's too deep. I can't even survive that. I don't have enough oxygen. I need, like, the bare oxygen thing.

484
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:50,060
The data lady's funny. It is a cool cave, though. I like the purple. It's very pleasant on the eyes.

485
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,060
Okay, right. Stay here.

486
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:02,060
That was fucking terrifying. I thought that was an evil whale, but the whale isn't evil. The whale is nice. I like the whale. Hi, Mr. Whale.

487
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:08,060
Why is the music doing that? Does it need to do that? Doesn't it be so dramatic, honestly?

488
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,060
Hello, welcome to my ASMR parlor.

489
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,060
I can scan him? Sure, let's scan him.

490
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,060
A reef? It's called Reefback!

491
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,060
Wait, did I not finish the scans?

492
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,060
A rogue...

493
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,060
Rogue cradle.

494
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,060
What? Press Tab to view.

495
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:45,060
A complex cave-dwelling floor. The bright yellow core.

496
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:51,060
Right, why is the music all intense, though? Am I under attack? I feel like I'm safe with the whales, okay?

497
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,060
I'm just chilling with the whales. Why is the music all intense?

498
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:04,060
Is that how we look when you grow up? Yay, some nice and big flames.

499
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:09,060
I guess I'm actually just gonna try and get further away from the pod.

500
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,060
Are they just a texture? Okay.

501
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,060
Surely there'll be something to come across.

502
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,060
That music's too intense for me, though. I'm a bit of a baby.

503
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,060
A bit too intense, to be honest. A bit too intense.

504
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:31,060
Oh yeah, you like that? Yeah, I'm gonna scan you so hard. Scanning all over you.

505
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,060
Oh wait, we were just here. Dumbass. Dumbass!

506
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,060
Right, okay, I guess we're not here since we can't progress there.

507
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:44,060
That's just my death. Aging the scan. You know I will.

508
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,060
Right!

509
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,060
Okay.

510
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,060
Are you squiddin' me right now?

511
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:18,060
Stop force-feeding ya! No, you mean when I am force-feeding ya.

512
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,060
Thank you, Dainan, for two.

513
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,060
Ten pounds, Emine. Special gift voucher.

514
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:30,060
You is... Oh, he's gunnin'! There's another yin!

515
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,060
Is he gunnin' from me all the way up? No, he's going for another fish.

516
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
Right, hold on. Let me get oxygen and then we'll go straight down.

517
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:44,060
There's probably some item in here that we'd be wise to grab.

518
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,060
Come on.

519
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,060
Come on, lady. Come on, lady.

520
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,060
I'm trying.

521
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:01,060
It's so blinding. It's so tantalising. What is that?

522
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,060
Oh, it's pulsating.

523
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,060
Look, I didn't mean to get pulsed. It's throwing darts at me?

524
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,060
What kind of wildlife do they have on this planet that's so hostile? It's throwing darts?

525
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,060
Is that real?

526
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,060
Fuck your beach.

527
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,060
I'm fucking fighting a plant!

528
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
I'm fighting a plant!

529
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,060
Get out of here.

530
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,060
Fucking fighting a plant. What's this that I picked up?

531
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,060
A matured-er? There's no plant in the right conditions.

532
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,060
Okay, it's a shape. Hold on. Let's pop this one.

533
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,060
The scroll wheel is not very efficient, I said what I said.

534
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,980
Wait, I'm a fool.

535
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,060
I mean, I guess I can drop these.

536
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:06,060
Ooh, I'll pick that.

537
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,060
Ooh.

538
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,060
Okay.

539
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:14,060
If the whale can stop moaning in my ear, that'd be great.

540
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,060
That would be nice.

541
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:22,060
I don't mean to alarm you, but you're kind of moaning in my ear.

542
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,060
What?

543
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:30,060
I think your pot is going to explode in two hours.

544
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:36,060
This isn't my home for the rest of the game.

545
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,060
Same pose.

546
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,060
Thank you Grim by the other for the tap.

547
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,060
My pot, this isn't my home for the rest of the game.

548
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,060
Oh, is this the second batch of whales we've come across?

549
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:59,060
You can move items on your hotbar in your inventory.

550
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,060
The ship?

551
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,060
The ship blows up!

552
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,060
And how does one fix that?

553
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,060
Can I fix it blowing up?

554
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:17,060
Can I Pokemon go and fix the ship?

555
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,060
I'm skimming the water.

556
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:24,060
Fix the entire ship in two hours, you can't.

557
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,060
I'm going nuclear in two hours, you got me.

558
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,060
It's a story event.

559
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,060
Can I go up to the ship?

560
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,060
Wait, if I've got two hours, fuck it.

561
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,060
We swim into the ship after this.

562
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:45,060
Let me take my knife out.

563
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:49,060
Is this wreckage or is this scraps of metal?

564
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,060
It's metal salvage.

565
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:56,060
Will someone please think of the metal salvage?

566
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,060
Are you squinting me right now?

567
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,060
I don't know, are you squinting me right now?

568
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,060
Don't go to the ship.

569
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,060
Why not?

570
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,060
What do you mean?

571
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,060
I don't want to go to the ship.

572
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,060
You make me want to go more now.

573
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,060
Make me want to put my hands up and shit.

574
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,060
The ship needs to explode to progress the story.

575
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,060
What is going on?

576
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,060
I thought it was a wee game about being in the ocean.

577
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,060
What's going on here?

578
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,060
Right, I just need to drop everything I guess.

579
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,060
But these are so valuable, these resources.

580
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,060
Can I drop them and then they don't?

581
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,060
Please don't be spawned.

582
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,060
No, they don't.

583
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:37,060
Let's shake this over.

584
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,060
Oh my gosh, I'm so lightweight now.

585
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,060
I'm not worried for me.

586
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,060
Go to the ship there is our wordable reeflings there.

587
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,060
Oh yeah, I'm off.

588
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:51,060
You don't have to tell me twice.

589
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,060
Don't have to tell me twice.

590
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,060
I was saved.

591
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,060
Yeah, fuck you.

592
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,060
Right, save game.

593
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,060
Oh, game crash.

594
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,060
Please don't crash.

595
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,060
I want to take out.

596
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,060
My tools have power.

597
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:05,060
Brain power.

598
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,060
Fuel.

599
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,060
Let's get going.

600
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,060
Let's get going.

601
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,060
Lairing in the ocean, honestly though.

602
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,060
First thing human does on a new planet,

603
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,060
where is it?

604
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,060
Oh, should I scan that?

605
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,060
I should probably scan that on the way.

606
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,060
Where is it?

607
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,060
I'm scanning.

608
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,060
Oh, look at that scan.

609
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,060
You like that?

610
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,060
Yeah, fuck you.

611
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,060
Show me that trash can schematic.

612
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:36,060
I want to know how you make that.

613
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,060
Oh, I was kidding.

614
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,060
Oh, fuck you.

615
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,060
Teach me how to make a vending machine.

616
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,060
I'm going to start with Japan when I rebuild.

617
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,060
Wait, what?

618
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,060
There's vending machine.

619
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:56,060
Wait, can I make a vending machine in my wee house?

620
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,060
It's a non-functioning sample.

621
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,060
I don't know what that means.

622
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,060
Stop.

623
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,060
Right, we're starting.

624
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,060
I will rebuild Japan.

625
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,060
Don't think I won't do it.

626
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,060
Scanning.

627
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,060
A fluid analyzer.

628
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,060
Fragment.

629
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,060
A graph trap.

630
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:19,060
Whoa, actually, those wee skinny guys are in here.

631
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:23,060
I'm going to get my knife back off.

632
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,060
You can make pretty neat faces.

633
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,060
Are these skinny guys in here?

634
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,060
Are these skinny wee arseholes in here?

635
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,060
Back off.

636
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,060
I've got a knife.

637
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,060
And you're not killing me.

638
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,060
That'll lose my inventory if I die.

639
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,060
Where are you?

640
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,060
You wee arseholes under here.

641
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,060
Fuck.

642
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,060
I think we actually might go away with that.

643
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,060
I don't know where they are, but yeah.

644
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,060
Okay, safe.

645
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,060
Safe.

646
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,060
Just somehow safe.

647
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,060
Very surprisingly.

648
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,060
See.

649
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,060
Ah, this is a ship.

650
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,060
Hello, Mr. Ship.

651
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,060
Oh, no.

652
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,060
Oh, I can't even go in it.

653
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,060
Fuck.

654
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,060
Are you serious?

655
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,060
Can I, like, go around and avoid the radiation?

656
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,060
Is it, like, a little bit of a safe place?

657
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,060
You can just drop stuff, Minecraft.

658
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,060
Come on.

659
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,060
See that skinny fish that's in here?

660
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,060
Can I go, like, around it, or is the radiation...

661
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:30,060
Like, I know I can't just put tinfoil around me

662
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,060
to protect myself from the radiation,

663
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,060
but, you know, a girl can try.

664
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,060
What's this?

665
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,060
Did I scan you?

666
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,060
Yeah, a little bit like I scanned you.

667
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,060
I will scan you now.

668
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,060
A Cyclops engine fragment.

669
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,060
It's a pretty...

670
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,060
pretty beast of a...

671
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,060
thing in the bober.

672
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,060
Can I go back behind the aureola?

673
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,060
Hello.

674
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,060
Hello, Mr. Ship.

675
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,060
Yeah, you look fucked up.

676
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,060
I don't even know how to climb a board.

677
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,060
I don't think I can.

678
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,060
It doesn't look textured to...

679
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,060
Ah, you fuck!

680
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,060
Oh, you fucker!

681
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,060
Fuck off!

682
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,060
Oh, my God!

683
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,060
Oh!

684
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,060
Oh!

685
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
That's even worse!

686
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,060
That's even worse!

687
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,060
I think I'd rather be in the water

688
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,060
so I don't have to see his fucking face

689
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,060
on top of this thing.

690
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,060
Oh, my God, I'm actually hiding behind my microphone.

691
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,060
I'm actually hiding behind my microphone right now.

692
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,060
Oh, my God!

693
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,060
Is that for real?

694
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:44,060
Am I supposed to 1v1 that?

695
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,060
Am I supposed to 1v1 that?

696
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,060
Am I alive?

697
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
Is it still after me?

698
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,060
Bro, I'm staying next to the fucking safety of the pod.

699
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,060
Are you serious?

700
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:00,060
I'm sorry.

701
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,060
Please don't listen to me at load volumes.

702
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:06,060
Oh, my God!

703
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
What was that?

704
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,060
Am I genuinely supposed to 1v1?

705
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,060
You can kill it?

706
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,060
That fucking chance, are you joking?

707
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,060
With this fucking knife?

708
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,060
Look how small my knife is.

709
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,060
I feel emasculated now that I've seen that animal.

710
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,060
That creature in the deep.

711
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,060
I found a friend.

712
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,060
Some friend.

713
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,060
Some friend.

714
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,060
That was a reaper.

715
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,060
A hard-leave nor.

716
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,060
Why would I do that?

717
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:37,060
Oh, fuck you.

718
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,060
Oh, my God!

719
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,060
Right, so...

720
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:47,060
Does that mean that part of the map is inaccessible?

721
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,060
What does that mean?

722
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:54,060
What, does everyone get freaked out at that part?

723
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,060
Oh, Jesus.

724
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,060
Safety.

725
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,060
I'm just gonna curl up in a ball and fall asleep here after that.

726
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
Jesus.

727
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:07,060
You are definitely a siren.

728
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:12,060
Alright, I do, but what the fuck?

729
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Non-functioning laboratory equipment.

730
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,060
Jesus, I need a moment.

731
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,060
Tiny spany, thank you.

732
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,060
Boy, thank you for the tip.

733
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,060
Tiny spany, thank you for the tip.

734
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,060
Michichonky bird.

735
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,060
Oh, I did not find a friend.

736
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,060
The Legend 27, one of us.

737
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,060
Thank you for the tip.

738
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,060
Did I get hurt?

739
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,060
I think it did get me.

740
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,060
Holy shit, yeah, it did.

741
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,060
Let me use that.

742
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,060
I don't...

743
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,060
What did I do?

744
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,060
What am I supposed to do next?

745
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,060
Are you squidding me right now?

746
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,060
Internet basil file, thank you for the extended membership.

747
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,060
You actually kinda did 1v1 it.

748
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,060
Normally you'd have been swallowed whole but your knife stabs.

749
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:56,060
Wait, he can swallow me?

750
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,060
Jesus.

751
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:01,060
What's this?

752
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:04,060
To attract light objects in small creatures.

753
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
Wait, something's making a noise.

754
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,060
You?

755
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:11,060
Play message?

756
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,060
He will eat you.

757
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,060
Oh, there's someone else here?

758
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,060
There's others?

759
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,060
I'm not alone?

760
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
Jesus.

761
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,060
Thank you stash power.

762
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,060
Yeah, okay, so scary.

763
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,060
Ali Viva, thank you for the three months.

764
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,060
You did well in that situation.

765
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,060
So I could have died right there and lost everything?

766
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,060
One fact, the reaper is the second biggest animal in the game, smile.

767
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,060
Over what?

768
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,060
That thing was massive.

769
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,060
Are you squidding me right now?

770
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,060
Reflings, what did mama say?

771
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,060
I think I just got permanent aid before I have extreme tonight.

772
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,060
How loud was my scream?

773
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,060
Can someone marshmallow a clip?

774
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
I don't know how loud my scream was.

775
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,060
Wait, where's that other one?

776
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,060
700 meters that way!

777
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,060
Oh, you're tapping on that.

778
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,060
It was very loud.

779
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,060
What's this, sorry.

780
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,060
Sorry deaflings.

781
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:32,060
Sorry little Reflings.

782
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:35,060
Right, I guess we're gonna go here.

783
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
Belly flop.

784
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,060
We're gonna avoid these guys though.

785
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,060
Oh god, they're all the way out there.

786
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,060
Go back into your little veins.

787
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,060
Loud enough to pop my ears.

788
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,060
I heard you from the other room.

789
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,060
Do you want us to hold your hands?

790
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,060
Are they coming for me?

791
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,060
Yeah, go for the wee flashlight.

792
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,060
Bring that one.

793
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,060
Okay, life pod three.

794
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,060
It's the fourth biggest animal?

795
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,060
There you go.

796
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:08,060
Thank you deafling and thank you Christophels and for the toast.

797
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,060
Right, let's get to it.

798
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,060
We're gonna see if there's other humans.

799
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,060
Hello, Farky Boy.

800
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,060
I know the fact that Baby Pink is online.

801
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,060
She may or may not be streaming entirely.

802
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,060
On the road again.

803
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,060
Wrong mindset.

804
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,060
Survive and explore, not dominate.

805
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,060
I can rather dominate you.

806
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,060
This is scary.

807
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,060
Can I stand on this?

808
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,060
You just hear my flip-flops going like

809
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,060
wank, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.

810
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,060
And then back into the water.

811
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,060
Told you it's a horror game.

812
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,060
It's like, during the day, it's actually really pretty.

813
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:04,060
It's like, it's almost Pandora-esque.

814
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,060
You know what I mean?

815
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:11,060
Kind of like giving avatars at night when it's all pretty.

816
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:17,060
Oh, I'm fucking got PTSD going through fucking vines.

817
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:22,060
Right, that horrible thing's over there, so it's not here.

818
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,060
It's not here.

819
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,060
It's not here.

820
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,060
I'm safe.

821
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,060
I'm just gonna go around.

822
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,060
It's Spain.

823
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,060
I'm just gonna go around.

824
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,060
I'm just gonna go around.

825
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,060
Okay, I'm just playing it safe.

826
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,060
Can I scan this?

827
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,060
Delicious.

828
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,060
Whoa.

829
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,060
What?

830
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,060
What?

831
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,060
Is it gonna blow up?

832
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,060
Is it gonna blow up?

833
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,060
Five, two, one.

834
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,060
Three, two, one.

835
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,060
Is the Reaper dead now?

836
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,060
Is that how the Reaper dies?

837
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:16,060
From the shock wave?

838
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,060
Huh?

839
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,060
No, the Reaper is even more annoyed.

840
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,060
Well, he can come to me at any point now?

841
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,060
Don't say that. Don't say such things.

842
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,060
Don't think I won't scream again.

843
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,060
You better lower your volume.

844
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
Are those my friendly whales?

845
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,060
Hello.

846
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,060
Uh, Gutsh official.

847
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,060
Thank you for an extended membership.

848
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,060
You need to listen to its roars to avoid it.

849
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,060
Wait, here?

850
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
Right, I'm getting fucking...

851
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,060
I'm going to get sprannic now.

852
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,060
I'm losing it.

853
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,060
Oh my god, it's in the fucking vanes, please.

854
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,060
I can't handle vanes anymore.

855
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,060
Subbean, thank you for becoming a member as well.

856
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,060
I hope you enjoy them most.

857
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:21,060
I promise I'd sound more excited if I was a fucking terrible guy.

858
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,060
Okay, so those are the long-sleeved necks.

Can I go inside this pod?

863
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,060
Shit, let me in. Let me in.

864
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,060
Let me in. Put me in.

865
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,060
Put me in.

866
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,060
Oh shit, it's broken into.

867
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,060
It has exploded?

868
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,060
What's this?

869
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,060
Abandoned PDA.

870
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,060
Wow.

871
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,060
Open data box.

872
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,060
Sure.

873
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,060
Come here.

874
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,060
Come here.

875
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,060
Fuck, she died.

876

01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,060
Fuck off, bitch.

878
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,060
No, I'm not scared of you.

879
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:24,060
Actually, I'm terrified, but I'm not scared of you, go away.

880
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,060
I'm actually really scared to play this game.

881
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,060
I don't want to play anymore, I'm scared.

882
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,060
And it's about to be night time.

883
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,060
I don't want to be in the war at night.

884
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,060
I can end up falling.

885
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,060
I'm gonna make it.

886
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,060
The Reaper's about 55 meters in length.

887
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,060
Bro, I can't even handle 4 inches.

888
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,060
B.

889
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060

No, that's my scanner. Take your light out.

892
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,060
Okay, it's not a wee bit less scary.

893
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,060
Just a wee bit though.

894
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,060
Just a wee bit less scary.

895
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,060
I am hovering on the surfer.

896
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,060
I am hovering on the surfer.

897
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,060

924
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:25,620
okay I was a little bit pretty just a wee bit freaked out like it's just a wee bit

925
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:31,500
nothing nothing I can't eat right focus up what I need to I need lead is there

926
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:39,060
lead in this box I could have sworn I had a piece of lead I've won lead right I

927
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:45,020
need another bit of word and then a compass is a wiring kit and I've no

928
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:48,540
made a wiring kit because I need something for the wiring kit which is to

929
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:58,540
silver right and I don't have I only have one silver right so now what we

930
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:05,480
the fuck does that go back into caverns I think so right there seems to be a

931
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:11,580
lot of titanium so let's just get rid of this fish non-functional laboratory

932
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:18,740
equipment what does that mean Ken what it's non-functioning me because there's

933
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:29,420
any Ken what I'm doing right I need silver lead is found in the deeper

934
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:34,140
areas like the kelp forest where I'm gonna be a bottle wait am I dropping

935
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,780
this all over not too much but a little bit if it all just stays under there

936
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:49,780
right and then we're gonna drop the flares lead and okay refling

937
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:54,540
at my parents house we need to be quiet when we do it three seconds until in

938
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:59,140
extraction insert the screaming clip here that can be heard up to five miles

939
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:03,540
away wouldn't that be annoying if someone was screaming in your ear like

940
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:11,900
oh I'm gonna ink like wouldn't that be really annoying right where is the

941
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:18,460
cavern I'm not going near there I'm not going in that direction I do not care

942
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:24,700
right I think we'll go for the purple cavern which is this way right caverns

943
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:31,260
we need to go into caverns got it not if it's you it's underwater yes thank you

944
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:37,940
thank you tiny tiny for the fit at least your ASMR make was not on that thing

945
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:42,860
would have been blown out long ago long ago that thing would have been gone I

946
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:47,500
can already see the clip name of this brave first-time subnautica cuttlefish

947
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:53,220
player meets her first ah well freaking sound imminent I was fucking learning on

948
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:58,100
how to do the thingy so you know how man use short is like VTuber learns her

949
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:05,860
name is like butthole or whatever and you're not supposed to put your name

950
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:10,140
like it's not like strongy learns her name it's VTuber learns her name and

951
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,540
the algorithm likes that better like I'm not arguing against the algorithm but

952
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:19,940
if this gets turned into a clip then it's gonna be VTuber discovers Reaper in

953
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:27,580
subnautica for the first time like that kind of thing

954
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:34,580
blueprint acquired plate steel ingot okay like it's really interesting sorry I

955
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:38,460
could literally do a whole educational stream on trying on how to try and appease

956
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:45,780
the algorithm overlords I find it fascinating we personally I am very

957
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:51,300
fascinated on how to like try and get things to be successful or viral or

958
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:57,180
trying to trends and talk about trends and I have a drug education stream next

959
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:04,060
month I don't think I've done an education stream this month not that I

960
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:10,740
can recall people search VTuber more than any specified name yeah right

961
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:21,060
surely this cavern right there was a red fish that had a goat mate

962
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:29,660

991
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,300
weight of prey leaving the safety of the shallows to feed the stalker prey

992
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:08,380
lightly carved out its evolutionary niche as a sweet spot between feeding size

993
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:13,060
millions years ago and maybe oh shit I'm fucking drowning whilst I'm reading

01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:17,020
sorry we phone you have to go deeper I said that I was crazy I don't know why

1001
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:25,940
you're making such a remark like that way okay we got silver I just need lead

1002
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:35,060
now I'm just checking through this bank this does seem a bit deeper I don't

1003
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:46,940
remember did we go this way I'm looking around I see my wheels I don't see my

1004
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:59,540
precious little haverns you're waiting the war but we hit the end too fast pop

1005
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:05,540
pop pop pop is it weird that I almost find the wheels relaxing cuz I'm like

1006
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:09,860
they're not gonna spawn a big enemy next to the nice cam wheels so I'm like the

1007
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:14,780
wheels are saving me oh no I have been here this is where I needed that laser

1008
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:22,460
thing and the yes the aura thing happened and apparently it didn't kill

1009
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:31,300
the Reaper that's nearby ah nope not that one what we scan in it for oh pieces

1010
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:40,780
what did you just give me titanium so scanning now harvest resources how I

1011
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:46,460
still can't figure out how to get in here the 6th one

1012
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:54,620
hmm I don't know how to figure out the laser beam does anyone want to spoil

1013
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:59,260
how I achieve the laser beam for any particular reason just for a small

1014
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:08,140
reason some of those boxes have tools in them scan them okay let's go back down

1015
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:15,580
and scan them okay let's go

1016
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,380
loud boy

1017
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:34,980
if I was in a box and I was the laser I would be in this one and cargo GHD 3 no

1018
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:42,580
not a scanning selfie demo and these haha I'm the cargo cuz I'm so valuable

1019
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:48,740
he he I'll be really funny bacteria levels in the water performing a self-scan

1020
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:55,100
is advised where you for real I get like infected self-scan complete vital

1021
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:01,780
science normal detecting trace amounts of foreign bacteria we plan to monitor we

1022
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:08,540
plan fucking zombies out here I'm about to turn into a fucking aquatic zombie you

1023
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:14,100
have to mourn to make innumendos about refunds to find a little car honestly

1024
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:23,220
yeah why am I so bad at finding it I'm like this right you go up rocks you're

1025
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:30,180
gonna come back down a blueprints for a bioreactor I'm sure it's fine don't

1026
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:34,580
worry about it not every disease means zombies I just like mmm zombie fish is

1027
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:38,660
the only logical reason is it that box maybe it's that box like the further away

1028
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:56,980
like that your skin will start bubbling wait so not only do I have to survive in

1029
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:00,340
the game imagine if I had to deal with my health in my water right now as well

1030
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:05,220
well I'd be fucking off on one I'd be gone so I'd be out but now I have to do

1031
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:15,500
a zombie fucking virus no stop wait I've already been here dressed wait I've

1032
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:21,020
been in this place before I'm sorry what I'm getting all mixed about what I have

1033
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:31,940
and haven't scanned I see quartz don't be aggressive shit I see these they're

1034
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:38,860
just glass though brah I'm looking I promise I'm looking I'm not trolling I

1035
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:46,260
just can't find it deja vu I've been in this place before scanning all the mail

1036
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:52,980
and I can't find the blueprints this fucking laser is not gonna come into my

1037
01:34:52,980 --> 01:35:01,300
inventory and I still have to make the thing hmm I can't find the box I'm

1038
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:06,500
supposed to scan I scanned one thing there's nothing left for you in this

1039
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:12,140
spot I have to scan it at another site you'll have to find it at a different

1040
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:24,140
area but not in that area well that area there I need to go further out must I go

1041
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:30,300
further how much further must I travel there's other wreckages that'll come

1042
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:42,980
across okay I've got the anxiety playing this game a little bit shoulda taken a wee

01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:19,580
before so he was a bit he was a bit feisty after I've met him he's that

1090
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:56,340

1091
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:03,300
bed and skip the night like Minecraft oh my god Minecraft is it coming I don't

1092
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,380
know is it getting brighter or is that just copium I think it's just copium to

1093
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:18,220
be honest I don't like see the horizon getting brighter pure raw copium this

1094
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:21,980
perfect plan this place looks like the perfect planet to dump batteries

1095
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:27,300
something just London I'm actually becoming schizophrenic for this game I

1096
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,220
genuinely think stuff's moving about when it's not you see the way the like

1097
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:34,260
the light is glistening through the war I thought that was a big long thing

1103
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:20,180
distance it's rendered out let's take it easy we're let's skim the surface what

01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:43,740
out of the war I'm gonna get snipe I'm not good

1120
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:48,740
kind there's a good kind of stream sniping yes this is oh my god there's a

1121
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:54,940
fucking other thing can I grab this thing fucking give me this give me it

1122
01:44:54,940 --> 01:45:04,860
right up the drone there's stuff for me to scan though hydroclone and acid it's

1123
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:11,220
very bad for your skin okay nothing attacked me that went surprisingly well

1124
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:19,260
so I wasted all that time waiting for night time for no reason

1125
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,820
I think if I go down one more time I'll probably be able to scan something and

1126
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:30,360
then I can get the laser tool make a note to come back here later yeah it's

1127
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:34,560
probably too deep for your current gear you've not by going too deep with me

1128
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:43,680
everything oh there seems to be something in the distance that's like it

1129
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:51,680
looks like an older ship that's broken down hmm they're in the shallows right

1130
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:55,840
okay let's go get a laser fragment and upgrade our gear like the waters actually

1131
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,160
got a green hue to you know that I've just noticed that so I guess we are on a

1132
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:05,000
section so this is like a genuine map though it's not just randomly and

1133
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:12,840
generated like we're in the green abyss if you will and then there'll be like

1134
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,920
other bits like the shallow veins as soon as you come out yeah it's not random

1135
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:21,160
okay I'm glad that is not random I feel like if it was random that'd be less

1136
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:27,000
fun I'm just gonna pretend there's absolutely nothing nibbling at my toes

1137
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,480
right now I'm not even looking back actually I'm so confident I shan't be

1138
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:39,600
attacked I'm heady I'm belaning I'm belaning for my little car all the

1139
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,040
pieces of the same place okay

1140
01:46:43,040 --> 01:47:00,680
she's starting to gain that salaphobia is that the fear of the war you know what

1141
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:06,720
I don't like the sensory swap from being on the surface to under because as soon

1142
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:13,800
as you go under you hear all of this stuff just keep swimming some resources

1143
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:18,320
are placed there may randomly but there is a defined map and major aspect the

1144
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:23,760
tonic there thank you for the tip as well and that thank you for coming a

1145
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:30,760
member see the music's all nice so assume I'm in a nice part of the map music's

1146
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:39,720
all nice again so goes music's all nice life good happy days once the music's

1147
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:44,600
all night I don't need more titanium I've got enough titanium to last me in

1148
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:56,240
there travels sounds travel much better I know I don't want to escape nothing's

1149
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:00,600
nibbling at my toes so I think I'm already at this part of the map right we

1150
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,880
need to just upgrade our gear and then we can see about exploring that purple

1151
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:09,240
cavern and that area we just found in the green sea I'm just gonna call that

1152
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,640
place a green sea from now on

1153
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:24,640

01:53:50,740 --> 01:54:01,300
I need to fiber mesh and need like wait come here lead fiber mesh and then how

1197
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:07,820
do I make fiber mesh how do I make fiber mesh

1198
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:15,580
wait what was it fiber mesh I need it from Creepvine sample I think there's two

1199
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:19,580
below actually excuse me a moment I think there's actually Creepvine sample

1200
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:25,780
where's a Creepvine where is it there is look we'll just harvest it from here

1201
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:34,580
and we can do it this smooth ones have lead remember that moment I'm I am

1202
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:41,660
putting it in my mind right there they'll do it and then we'll have radiation

1203
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:52,060
suit so we can't be hurt by the radiation anymore and then something else

1204
01:54:52,060 --> 01:55:01,900
mm-hmm gorgeous stunning put it on right put that in I know it can no longer be

1205
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:07,300
harmed by radiation wait that means I'm going to the aurora

1206
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:19,420
a better fucking no be does that mean I have to go to Aurora next to Reaper

1267
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:41,660
right I found it in a cavern here so there must be more shallow caverns

1268
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,580
I can grab it from

1269
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,660

1279
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:42,060
ooh you look smooth oh like lead hell yeah we need one more radiation detected good thing I'm

1280
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:48,780
oh I need to breathe actually wait did I take damage from the radiation if I've got my suit on

1281
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,340
that need even more

1282
02:04:56,060 --> 02:05:02,940

must have been

1288
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:26,460

1289
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:30,140
what was that smooth

1290
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:34,620

yeah

1292
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:43,660
support salt glass I got silver those are pretty rare

1293
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:49,260
I don't think my suit's ready for this yeah

1294
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,140
I need one more lead

1295
02:05:56,300 --> 02:06:05,180
you can remove the radiation if you go to the ship you wee bastard you sorry he's

1296
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:09,340
wee tiny are you squiddin me right now cheeky thing coming at me like that

1297
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:16,380
oh great mama please enlighten us does ovulation time mean you're less or more fertile I'm only

1298
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:23,980
asking you because the internet told me nothing so um don't worry if you don't know about this

1299
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:29,100
don't be embarrassed it's absolutely nothing to do with you it's just education um you a

1300
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:38,540
woman me hi um I know scary uh I can only get pregnant for a window of like 48 hours in a month

1301
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:46,220
and that's what um the ovulation cycle is so when I say I'm ovulating I literally am fertile

1302
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:50,780
like you can put a baby in me that's what I mean okay

1303
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:58,140
but for the rest of the month you're unable to get me pregnant like you you don't have to pull out

1304
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:07,900
does that make sense that's how ovulation works um and humans wait you're a woman this whole time

1305
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:14,700
I'm so sorry I had to find out like this forgive me forgive me right and then I need to scan one

1306
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:20,060
more oh I see you are you coming at me no he's he's fighting something else couldn't do you think I

1307
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:29,980
could sneak around is he AI locked on to me no he's fighting something else is that box though

1308
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:35,900
I think it might have my laser in it I'm like a cat I just want my laser point now woman on

1309
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:41,820
stream yes so everyone I'm tell you I'm like oh I'm ovulating that um what normally a side effect

1310
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:53,580
of that is like increased lebedo increased submissiveness right hopefully he's gonna be

1311
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:57,420
distracted and I can scan wherever I need oh it's not here of course it's not me

1312
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:09,980
I'm like oh don't do that that scared me that noise scared me

1313
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:19,980
it's the side effect yeah oh he's coming he's coming integrating new pda data and he's going

1314
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:26,460
for something else oh no he's going for me oh I'm trapped it growls like a lion

1315
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:36,780
ah I can't seem to faint oh fuck I'm full I mean I didn't really need titanium I have enough of it

1316
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:42,540
at home don't need more of that metal salvage I can drop that that's again just titanium

1317
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:46,860
that box or was that box we've already scanned it probably

1318
02:08:54,780 --> 02:09:03,180
yeah I think um ink has like a 5d living span inside the womb just because of the womb is optimized

1319
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:08,700
to obviously hold the yes the

1320
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:16,300
no why am I scanning it looks like I'm gonna be like geological data

1321
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:31,980
is this it no what more do you want more greedy greedy pure greed

1322
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:37,100
you want more scans of it how is that not enough I want inside that little pod thing

1323
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,540
now this is pod racing

1324
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:51,020
all right he's gonna oh you look like it I'ma take the L and get bitten by this guy

1325
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:58,380
I'ma take the L and get bitten by him oh what's he missed

1326
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:06,780
blue print is quiet oh wait hold on that looks like lead down there out on a minute oh it's like

1327
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:17,100
lead are you lead please be loud oh oh dubs dubs all around dubs all around are you smooth

1328
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:26,380
yes when they're smooth I'm getting it my brain cells they're growing my brain's getting wrinklier

1329
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:34,060
there is a few good other bits there okay let's get the laser cutter and then we'll go into the

1330
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:42,380
room which I've already forgotten the location of sandstone is laid I'm lame it only took me

1331
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:50,540
two hours to grasp the basic mechanics of the game this cut off fish is the woven already

1332
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:59,820
basically was thank you for the tip and the booty load get educated again so fast can I just

1333
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:04,700
get to learn about all these cool things that's actually really cool I like that they had that

1334
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:15,340
in James Cameron's avatar game it congrats every names james um and they had like encyclopedias

1335
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:23,260
and I used to read them look oh my god what are the it's a floater are they attacking that

1336
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:31,260
what's going on here you don't need to hold still I'm trying to scan you a floater

1337
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:40,620
curious right we've achieved something I'm gonna be honest I've already forgot what we've achieved

1338
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:48,540
I'll take it um a battery diamond oh I don't even know where to get diamond

1339
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:54,140
where a battery I need a battery

1340

um a battery a battery a battery a battery is two acid mushrooms right and how

1341
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:09,980
fills my inventory they I'll go get we two acid mushrooms and I'll go get a battery

1342
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:17,740
okay give me a minute I need to go get about a wee battery wee battery yeah one whole battery

1344
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:30,940
uh yes I need diamond I'm not sure how to obtain diamond

1345
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:40,540
did she make a vehicle way I have not diamonds are found at deep slate levels

1346
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:48,220
gonna need a battery recharge or something diamond is even deeper is this not deep enough

1347
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:51,260
I feel like this is more than adequate

1348
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:58,780
ingredients unknown waterproof lock or small storage solution

1349
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:06,540
uses artificial gravity no I'm not wasting my money I recommend finding the vehicle base

1350
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:14,380
fragments why yes I would know where to go for that oh wait wasn't I not building something

1351
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:19,260
wait I could have sworn I was building something this how'd I pin how'd I create it

1352
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:22,460
but I've got all the ingredients for it

1353
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,900
Sony you will need to build the sea more

1354
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:33,900
in the vehicle bay

1355
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:41,580
vehicle bay what's that mean yeah you need a vehicle with the vehicle

1356
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:48,540

1360
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:27,020

1363
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,820
this the regular one

1364
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:55,980
oh I don't need to put that helmet on when I'm going in radiation sites

1365
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:04,380
mummies pull it in the ocean literally look at all this fish I've collected my resources

1366

I want to go in again

1368
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:21,740
use only the radiation when I'm in radiation okay that radiation area had like tons of stuff in it though

1369
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:34,060
use more oxygen when you're lower than 100 the rebreather changes that to 200

1370
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:43,900
up meet the sand shark mr sand shark can you fuck off I'm not in the mood

1402
02:19:56,860 --> 02:19:58,300
how do I power my tools up

02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:22,860
try crafting I see like this make new batteries or get charged in are you switching me right now

1407
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:29,740
you know some of those whale calls you keep hearing yeah that's the reaper and the other fish

especially for gamers like me who are trash right we're gonna go to the green sea and the reason

1434
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:20,220

1461
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:21,260
do you want do you want to know some really fun lore that's not fun it's actually embarrassing

1462
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:26,460
well it's not embarrassing because every fucking everyone did it so I watched Pewdiepie when I was

1463
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:33,820
younger and I watched him play amnesia and I was like I shit you know I must have been seven years

1464
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:45,660
old and I recorded my webcam microphone I was very very young okay this is the green sea let's go

1465
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:53,420
down and played amnesia for an hour on fraps or something like that obviously I was very fucking

1466
02:26:53,420 --> 02:27:01,580
young so I think I got all the viruses in the world with it um but like oh let me make sure my

1467
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:07,820
rebreather's on that show there we'll scan everything

1468
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:13,340
stalagmite hanging on the roof because they have to hold on tight

1469
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:18,860
actually that's not a bad way to remember it right here we go let's get some data

1470
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:25,100
let's get some data boys hello okay I grabbed that and then I piece the fuck out because I didn't

1471
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:28,540
have this rebreather at the time but now I have a rebreather

1472
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:39,980
modification station what are you I'm not even supposed to be of anything

1473
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:43,660
oh supply for it what is it take item

1474
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:55,180
I feel like I feel like that's tutorial stuff that I probably should have figured out a long

1475
02:27:55,180 --> 02:28:06,220
time ago a rebreather me when I want to run through with you a desk fuck yeah give me a desk I'm so

02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:12,460
excited uh oh found a desk recipe oh my god please let me out I'm gonna fucking drown

1477
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:17,020
must be something in one of these

1478
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:24,860
I seem safe honestly I don't actually see any enemies here so I think the green sea is safe and

1479
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:33,820
it's just uh it's so deep you should be so scared the green sea you don't need war because you're so

1480
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:42,940
you're already wet real well is this easy mode no it's tutorial stuff for survival mode honestly

1481
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:49,180
do you die on zero oxygen or die like take hp damage because I think I may have fucked up

1482
02:28:52,700 --> 02:29:00,700
did I fuck up holy shit how did I keep doing that I'm so emoji okay let's go in

1483
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:11,260
uh you die one hp in a dream your vision starts there darkening and then you respond

1484
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,900
you start down lose all my inventory

1485
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:25,100
you swap the tank oh maybe I should pick up the tank because it means I'm gonna explore for

1486
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:28,140
longer as well which would actually be really handy

1487
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:38,780
I'm scanning scanning caution rogue robot you lose some of it well better not be the important

1488
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:44,380
parts that I've been fucking going nuts trying to get maybe region ooh a torpedo

1489
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:46,380
ooh

1490
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:56,700
a thermal plan okay but these aren't anything that I need right there's been trolled

1491
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:02,380
I think I'm just gonna trolled thermal plan I can only use that

1492
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:04,540
oh

1493
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:19,740

1494
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:25,660
gonna try for it and see what happens can I load a last save if I die

1495
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:36,220
I know don't go for it save before you go down I agreed can we do it sure where am I in

1496
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:47,820

1497
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:57,900
though jeez I'm 800 meters away from fun right let's keep going what's this

1498
02:31:01,900 --> 02:31:06,460
it's not very textured which makes me think I'm not supposed to go further in the green sea

1499
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:12,140
it's land oh I can put my little flip flops on it right come on then let's go

1500
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:17,500
I don't like that there's a filter before I can see what's underneath

some salt some stalagmite

1506
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:48,700
it's kind of far so it doesn't load the texture properly okay

1507
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:56,140
I don't see any new items to pick up

1508
02:31:56,460 --> 02:32:04,460
I can't look like a skull oh it's like glowing egg

1509
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:13,020

bacterial infection bright green blisters forming networks around the site pathology suggests

1580
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:15,180
a waterborne bacteria incapable of penetrating the body through the skin and respiratory system

1581
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:19,580
underlying indications of genetic mutation and aggressive behavior the bacteria in itself is

1582
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:25,500
unlike anything so far in human warning maybe cautious avoid do not under any consume the flesh

1619
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:26,300
without perishing and you want me to go a thousand fucking meters down a new pda moment data you need

1620
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:34,300
the purple tablet wait did I not pick it up I mean I can always go back it's not a problem

1621
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:40,220
I was trying to go to that third observer true and you know observe it there that one

1622
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:45,180

um right what are we looking at log one

1631
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:55,660
right let's hear it this island is a godsend look out of the window no predators fresh food

1632
02:44:55,660 --> 02:45:01,420
no building materials nothing left of the ship and your kid says we're gonna starve without more

1633
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:08,380
grow beds speak up kid it's true father the natural growth rates too slow to keep supporting it

1634
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:16,780
all I'm saying is oceans got us surrounded no use hiding sooner or later we'll get our feet wet okay

1635
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:22,540
so your life may have been a fight made up but I've made my decision you want to forfeit your

1636
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:31,260
emergency paid to take a swim go ahead believe me I'm thinking of it damn she doesn't like me

1637
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:40,140
so did I not play this one you see chief you brought us to this sodden planet told us we'd

1638
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:47,980
see a lush payday now what do we got some six weeks later a dead crew a habitat that's half

1639
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:54,380
oh it went bad washed away it went bad executive decisions would be better left to someone with

1640
02:45:54,380 --> 02:46:00,220
your extensive experience of hidden people in the face I know enough not to take unscheduled

1641
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:06,940
detours to uncharted planets that's something you don't want to learn the hard way to judge a

1642
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:13,580
decision in hindsight or is no the first one a crash here plan of your own going already take what

1643
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:18,700
we can carry and hunker down in a cave somewhere a scout at a site a couple hundred meters deep

1644
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:25,100
lots of metal deposits how do you imagine we'd live with ready access to building materials like damn

1645
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:32,700
queens a couple of water filters a bio reactor fish but chief we'll eat seaweed salad and drink our

1646
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:38,940
own urine if that's what it takes oh all the matters is all right beer girls come down send the

1647
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:48,220
coordinates to my pda i'll review your proposal he's supposed to be so i'll review right um

1648
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:56,380
i definitely do not have what is necessary right do i need to pick up that purple data thing

1649
02:46:56,380 --> 02:47:00,060
down there again because i'll do it i'll go explore and i don't think i want

1650
02:47:00,860 --> 02:47:08,780
you don't think i will go explore yes who goes there identify yourself

1651

1654
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:32,460
after all we've been through but a cheeky bit of a slip and slide

1655
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:44,140
what does this do oh it didn't do the sound effect there you go i did it for you

1656

1658
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:10,460
i'm not saying it was aliens but aliens is that what the disease is in my body

1659
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:17,580
it's no zombies it's aliens oh my god i want to get to the bottom of this and i want to go though

1660

1664
02:48:57,180 --> 02:48:59,180
hammering on the roof

1665
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:04,780
someone check if he's actually got us

1666
02:49:04,780 --> 02:49:10,700
a stable source of food such a food education is paying off sooner than i'd anticipated

1667
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:17,180
i'd anticipated our only problem is made up made a lot of mess thank you i'll be here a week

1668
02:49:17,180 --> 02:49:23,180
i say she's finding excuses to risk our lives made a lot of excuses to risk our lives

1669
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:31,340
i didn't know all i say let's go judgment she makes things go from bad to worse

1670
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:40,220
if she had my experience she'd have more faith humans have spent millennia specializing

1671
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:46,700
in how to shackle nature to our will this planet won't cause us any new problems

1672
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:54,700
my one task now is to keep us alive as comfortably as possible until the insurance

1673
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:56,620
the insurance company

1674
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:09,340

right that's enough knock off knock off we're not doing that anymore

1676
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:32,540
and charge when you take charge of yourself say chief chief watch you know how to drain those

1677
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:39,260
grow beds of 40 months insurance companies are right from the air sorry um you stopped your tone

1678
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:46,300
2012 and you didn't report it your insurance is void okay then if tomorrow you're gonna be so hungry

02:50:46,300 --> 02:50:52,780
you start wondering what it takes like let me lower the s effects yes actually yes instead of

1680
02:50:52,940 --> 02:50:56,860

1681
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:14,060

1684
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:28,140

1807
03:07:04,060 --> 03:07:10,860
you're safe okay i'm safe in the purple cavern got it 100 meters oxygen efficiency decreased

1808
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:15,100
oh fuck i don't have my rebreather because of the fucking radiation

1809
03:07:15,420 --> 03:07:21,420

1812
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:42,460
hold on hold on i'm gonna go save it on the surface because i think i might drown there's

1813
03:07:42,460 --> 03:07:49,020
a very high chance of me drowning i'm gonna be honest very high chance so let's just save first

1815
03:07:53,900 --> 03:08:01,020
for it to be me no you need to lower your volume 30 seconds okay let's save and then let's go down

1816
03:08:01,020 --> 03:08:09,500
that's all we have to do save down save down save down save down and maybe joker no i've gotten

1817
03:08:09,500 --> 03:08:15,340

1820
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:43,340
for faster flippers maybe i should have upgraded should i go back

1821
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:59,020
too much ink i think i should go back i think i might drown there's a very high chance of me

1822
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:05,260
drowning unless there's air in here which i doubt there's no eels here that are interested in me

03:33:23,900 --> 03:33:25,020

2041
03:34:02,460 --> 03:34:04,460
I did it!

2042
03:34:04,460 --> 03:34:06,460
I was about to die, you know how to do shit.

2043
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:10,460
Let me get out.

2044
03:34:10,460 --> 03:34:12,460
Oh, it's a fucking tight fit.

2045
03:34:12,460 --> 03:34:13,460
Oh, yeah.

2046
03:34:13,460 --> 03:34:16,460
Imagine if I dried it after that, I was going to say, bro.

2047
03:34:16,460 --> 03:34:18,460
Okay, right, we're going back to the pod,

2048
03:34:18,460 --> 03:34:20,460
and then we're going to make this.

2049
03:34:24,460 --> 03:34:27,460
Another thing accomplished.

2050
03:34:27,460 --> 03:34:28,460
Fuck yeah.

2051
03:34:28,460 --> 03:34:30,460
Okay, we were going to craft this,

2052
03:34:30,460 --> 03:34:32,460
and then we can make stuff,

2053
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:34,460
and that stuff is going to help us get further down

2054
03:34:34,460 --> 03:34:36,460
to discover more stuff.

2055
03:34:36,460 --> 03:34:38,460
And with that more stuff that we discover,

2056
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:40,460
we can kill our biggest enemy, the Reaper!

2057
03:34:42,460 --> 03:34:44,460
He's our worst enemy.

2058
03:34:44,460 --> 03:34:46,460
He's my lifelong enemy.

2059
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:50,460
Enemy, enemy, give him an enemy.

2060
03:34:50,460 --> 03:34:52,460
I love the whales.

2061
03:34:52,460 --> 03:34:54,460
They're so cute.

2062
03:34:54,460 --> 03:34:56,460
A lot of jelly whales.

2063
03:34:56,460 --> 03:34:58,460
Jewels?

2064
03:34:58,460 --> 03:35:00,460
That Reaper.

2065
03:35:00,460 --> 03:35:02,460
Spank.

2066
03:35:02,460 --> 03:35:04,460
Spanked into oblivion, honestly.

2067
03:35:08,460 --> 03:35:10,460
Wait, no, don't get distracted.

2068
03:35:10,460 --> 03:35:12,460
Don't get distracted.

2069
03:35:12,460 --> 03:35:14,460
I was about to go there. I'm like, no, no,

2070
03:35:14,460 --> 03:35:16,460
we're crafting stuff in our little house.

2071
03:35:16,460 --> 03:35:18,460
The whales from whales.

2072
03:35:18,460 --> 03:35:20,460
It's a cat.

2073
03:35:26,460 --> 03:35:28,460
I'm going to kill all the Reapers.

2074
03:35:30,460 --> 03:35:32,460
How many Reapers are there in game?

2075
03:35:32,460 --> 03:35:34,460
Just out of curiosity.

2076
03:35:34,460 --> 03:35:36,460
No other reason.

2077
03:35:36,460 --> 03:35:38,460
That's why my hands are wet.

2078
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:40,460
No other reason.

2079
03:35:40,460 --> 03:35:42,460
You already...

2080
03:35:42,460 --> 03:35:44,460
I'm supposed to kill it with this fucking tooth.

2081
03:35:48,460 --> 03:35:50,460
Just talking about the damn thing makes me jump through.

2082
03:35:50,460 --> 03:35:52,460
Jeez.

2083
03:35:52,460 --> 03:35:54,460
I'm fine. I'm fine.

2084
03:35:54,460 --> 03:35:56,460
He's okay. He's okay. I'm fine.

2085
03:35:58,460 --> 03:36:00,460
Just talking about it got me on edge though.

2086
03:36:00,460 --> 03:36:02,460
I'm a donkey on edge.

2087
03:36:04,460 --> 03:36:06,460
There's 25 in game.

2088
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:08,460
Oh, you're bleep.

2089
03:36:14,460 --> 03:36:16,460
Isn't all of you wet right now?

2090
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:18,460
It's like a weird movie quote.

2091
03:36:18,460 --> 03:36:20,460
I think it's from Spider-Verse.

2092
03:36:20,460 --> 03:36:22,460
And he was like, and that's why my hands are wet.

2093
03:36:22,460 --> 03:36:24,460
No other reason.

2094
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:26,460
And I still can't figure out what the punchline of the joke is.

2095
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:28,460
Welcome aboard captain.

2096
03:36:28,460 --> 03:36:30,460
Welcome aboard indeed.

2097
03:36:30,460 --> 03:36:32,460
No, open up the tool and then start crafting.

2098
03:36:32,460 --> 03:36:34,460
Anyway, I start crafting.

2099
03:36:40,460 --> 03:36:42,460
How does one obtain diamond out of curiosity?

2100
03:36:42,460 --> 03:36:44,460
I don't know how I'm doing so terribly.

2101
03:36:48,460 --> 03:36:50,460
I genuinely don't know how I'm struggling to find this one thing

2102
03:36:50,460 --> 03:36:52,460
to fucking...

2103
03:36:52,460 --> 03:36:54,460
by mining it.

2104
03:36:54,460 --> 03:36:56,460
The deep cave.

2105
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:58,460
The cave that I can't breathe in and run out of oxygen in.

2106
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:02,460
That's a hand dryer joke.

2107
03:37:02,460 --> 03:37:04,460
Diamonds are a bit deeper. You need to go into the pink cave.

2108
03:37:04,460 --> 03:37:06,460
But I'm gonna drown in the pink cave

2109
03:37:06,460 --> 03:37:08,460
because I can't find the fucking...

2110
03:37:08,460 --> 03:37:10,460
body bastard bitch fucking...

2111
03:37:10,460 --> 03:37:12,460
the rest of the blueprint

2112
03:37:12,460 --> 03:37:14,460
for the sea glider.

2113
03:37:16,460 --> 03:37:18,460
Sea glider, I hardly even know her.

2114
03:37:24,460 --> 03:37:26,460
Where the fuck is...

2115
03:37:26,460 --> 03:37:28,460
Right, go and give me an actual...

2116
03:37:28,460 --> 03:37:30,460
I have a compass, alright?

2117
03:37:30,460 --> 03:37:32,460
Tell me where the fucking sea glider is right now.

2118
03:37:32,460 --> 03:37:34,460
It's in the shallows, right?

2119
03:37:34,460 --> 03:37:36,460
I'm not leaving until we get there.

2120
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:38,460
I'm not leaving until we get the fucking thing.

2121
03:37:38,460 --> 03:37:40,460
Where is it?

2122
03:37:40,460 --> 03:37:42,460
Tomo!

2123
03:37:46,460 --> 03:37:48,460
You alright, Brian?

2124
03:37:48,460 --> 03:37:50,460
Why'd you say it like that?

2125
03:37:50,460 --> 03:37:52,460
Thank you the very Lord.

2126
03:37:52,460 --> 03:37:54,460
Demon.

2127
03:37:54,460 --> 03:37:56,460
Check around the kelp forest.

2128
03:37:56,460 --> 03:37:58,460
The kelp forest that's north, right?

2129
03:37:58,460 --> 03:38:00,460
Or the one that's southeast.

2130
03:38:00,460 --> 03:38:02,460
There's two kelp forests.

2131
03:38:02,460 --> 03:38:04,460
A demon.

2132
03:38:04,460 --> 03:38:06,460
Country room.

2133
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:08,460
Check.

2134
03:38:08,460 --> 03:38:14,460
To the place where I belong.

2135
03:38:14,460 --> 03:38:16,460
West Virginia.

2136
03:38:16,460 --> 03:38:18,460
Mountain Mama.

2137
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:20,460
Take me home.

2138
03:38:22,460 --> 03:38:24,460
I'm taking you home.

2139
03:38:26,460 --> 03:38:28,460
Yeah, I'm coming home so hard.

2140
03:38:30,460 --> 03:38:32,460
I just look around, there's dozens of them in the shallows.

2141
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:34,460
Right, so Ken, how you're...

2142
03:38:34,460 --> 03:38:36,460
That's actually just seeing activations at this point.

2143
03:38:36,460 --> 03:38:38,460
There's tons of them in the shallows.

2144
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:40,460
There's tons of them.

2145
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:42,460
You just have to look for them in the shallows.

2146
03:38:42,460 --> 03:38:44,460
Ken, what I'll look for.

2147
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:46,460
You're fucking frosty. Bend over.

2148
03:38:46,460 --> 03:38:48,460
Where is it?

2149
03:38:48,460 --> 03:38:50,460
Right, this is the end of it, right?

2150
03:38:50,460 --> 03:38:52,460
So I'm going to go up for water.

2151
03:38:52,460 --> 03:38:54,460
I'm going to come back down, okay?

2152
03:38:56,460 --> 03:38:58,460
I'm about to be nighttime just to ruin my day even further.

2153
03:38:58,460 --> 03:39:00,460
Of course it's the one that goes in the direction of the reaper.

2154
03:39:10,460 --> 03:39:12,460
What is that?

2155
03:39:12,460 --> 03:39:14,460
A creature's egg.

2156
03:39:14,460 --> 03:39:16,460
I'm going to leave that alone because it's nothing to do with him.

2157
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:22,460
There are diamonds down in the geyser.

2158
03:39:22,460 --> 03:39:24,460
Oh.

2159
03:39:28,460 --> 03:39:30,460
I can fucking see it.

2160
03:39:30,460 --> 03:39:32,460
Now I'm getting all scared.

2161
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:36,460
Oh, do we have...

2162
03:39:36,460 --> 03:39:38,460
Oh, this one.

2163
03:39:38,460 --> 03:39:40,460
We have...

2164
03:39:40,460 --> 03:39:42,460
Oh!

2165
03:39:42,460 --> 03:39:46,460
I'm searching for the same fucking item for three fucking hours.

2166
03:39:46,460 --> 03:39:48,460
Fuck off.

2167
03:39:48,460 --> 03:39:50,460
Fuck off.

2168
03:39:50,460 --> 03:39:52,460
Right, I'm not doing that. I'm going to daytime.

2169
03:39:52,460 --> 03:39:54,460
I'm going to daytime.

2170
03:39:54,460 --> 03:39:56,460
I'm going to daytime.

2171
03:39:56,460 --> 03:39:58,460
I want coordinates.

2172
03:39:58,460 --> 03:40:00,460
I want northeast, southwest.

2173
03:40:00,460 --> 03:40:02,460
I want never eat shredded wheat.

2174
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:04,460
I want it.

2175
03:40:04,460 --> 03:40:06,460
And we're going up.

2176
03:40:06,460 --> 03:40:08,460
We're going to search in the daytime because I haven't got enough battery.

2177
03:40:10,460 --> 03:40:12,460
Okay?

2178
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:14,460
Oh wait, was there a radio signal?

2179
03:40:14,460 --> 03:40:16,460
Sorry, I think there was a new radio signal.

2180
03:40:16,460 --> 03:40:18,460
Hello.

2181
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:20,460
This is Sunbeam.

2182
03:40:20,460 --> 03:40:22,460
You know Aurora.

2183
03:40:22,460 --> 03:40:24,460
The heart rate jumped today.

2184
03:40:24,460 --> 03:40:26,460
What are you saying there?

2185
03:40:26,460 --> 03:40:28,460
No bad without the good.

2186
03:40:28,460 --> 03:40:30,460
No good without the bad.

2187
03:40:30,460 --> 03:40:32,460
I see the good and the bad.

2188
03:40:32,460 --> 03:40:34,460
That only means you're overdue.

2189
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:36,460
We'll hold on to the ladder.

2190
03:40:36,460 --> 03:40:38,460
Might just be we're in.

2191
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:40,460
We're scanning for somewhere to park.

2192
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:42,460
We'll be in touch when we find it.

2193
03:40:42,460 --> 03:40:44,460
The music breaking down over our radio song.

2194
03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:46,460
Say...

2195
03:40:50,460 --> 03:40:52,460
Who's Birkin, honestly?

2196
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:56,460
I went to 100 beats per minute during the moon.

2197
03:40:56,460 --> 03:40:58,460
Did I actually?

2198
03:41:00,460 --> 03:41:02,460
I'm trying to like spake my heart rate right now.

2199
03:41:06,460 --> 03:41:08,460
What?

2200
03:41:08,460 --> 03:41:10,460
I guess my body reacts so...

2201
03:41:10,460 --> 03:41:12,460
What the fuck?

2202
03:41:12,460 --> 03:41:14,460
Don't be scared.

2203
03:41:14,460 --> 03:41:16,460
Wait, what's Juno's voice line?

2204
03:41:18,460 --> 03:41:20,460
Do one star jump?

2205
03:41:20,460 --> 03:41:22,460
I mean sure, I'll move.

2206
03:41:24,460 --> 03:41:26,460
I'll move.

2207
03:41:26,460 --> 03:41:28,460
One star jump.

2208
03:41:28,460 --> 03:41:30,460
I can jump up and down.

2209
03:41:30,460 --> 03:41:32,460
I'm wearing clothes so you're not going to hear anything.

2210
03:41:34,460 --> 03:41:36,460
What was Juno's voice line?

2211
03:41:36,460 --> 03:41:38,460
What was the end of her voice line?

2212
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:40,460
Do not panic.

2213
03:41:42,460 --> 03:41:44,460
Do not panic.

2214
03:41:48,460 --> 03:41:50,460
I see the bad and good.

2215
03:41:50,460 --> 03:41:52,460
I see the good and bad.

2216
03:41:54,460 --> 03:41:56,460
Please, I can't take it anymore.

2217
03:41:56,460 --> 03:41:58,460
That's the best part.

2218
03:41:58,460 --> 03:42:00,460
Because you are going to keep taking it.

2219
03:42:02,460 --> 03:42:04,460
Like the good boy, I know you are.

2220
03:42:06,460 --> 03:42:08,460
This is my life for a week.

2221
03:42:12,460 --> 03:42:14,460
Right, sunlight.

2222
03:42:16,460 --> 03:42:18,460
We'll have our head in the coral next to the repo.

2223
03:42:20,460 --> 03:42:22,460
So can I go to the coral that's not next to the repo

2224
03:42:22,460 --> 03:42:24,460
and get this done part?

2225
03:42:24,460 --> 03:42:26,460
This is a bad day for denialings.

2226
03:42:26,460 --> 03:42:28,460
Real answer.

2227
03:42:28,460 --> 03:42:30,460
Can't believe...

2228
03:42:30,460 --> 03:42:32,460
Imagine not winning that overwatch.

2229
03:42:32,460 --> 03:42:34,460
I don't know.

2230
03:42:34,460 --> 03:42:36,460
I don't know.

2231
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:38,460
We'll read some marshmallows while we wait for the sunrise together.

2232
03:42:38,460 --> 03:42:40,460
So romantic.

2233
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:42,460
Oh, it's just me screaming and clip.

2234
03:42:48,460 --> 03:42:50,460
I think you can switch the battery from any two

2235
03:42:50,460 --> 03:42:52,460
into the flashlight.

2236
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:56,460
I don't know how to do that.

2237
03:42:58,460 --> 03:43:00,460
I don't know how to do that.

2238
03:43:00,460 --> 03:43:02,460
What's this?

2239
03:43:02,460 --> 03:43:04,460
I wonder what that is.

2240
03:43:04,460 --> 03:43:06,460
I've actually not fully upgraded myself.

2241
03:43:06,460 --> 03:43:08,460
You can that.

2242
03:43:08,460 --> 03:43:10,460
What would that be?

2243
03:43:10,460 --> 03:43:12,460
If that's the compass, it wouldn't be like putting down markers.

2244
03:43:12,460 --> 03:43:14,460
It would be something...

2245
03:43:14,460 --> 03:43:16,460
What?

2246
03:43:16,460 --> 03:43:18,460
What would a chip do?

2247
03:43:18,460 --> 03:43:20,460
I don't know.

2248
03:43:22,460 --> 03:43:24,460
Can you load your battery with a gun?

2249
03:43:26,460 --> 03:43:28,460
Is Mum denying that there's something in there?

2250
03:43:28,460 --> 03:43:30,460
Oh, wow.

2251
03:43:30,460 --> 03:43:32,460
It is reload like a freaking battery.

2252
03:43:34,460 --> 03:43:36,460
I mean, I'll reload the flashlight when we need it.

2253
03:43:36,460 --> 03:43:38,460
As I said, if we go diving in the water

2254
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:42,460
during the daytime.

2255
03:43:44,460 --> 03:43:46,460
There's like five, six sea-glide fragments

2256
03:43:46,460 --> 03:43:48,460
of 100 meters around from the pod.

2257
03:43:48,460 --> 03:43:50,460
How could it be so bad then

2258
03:43:50,460 --> 03:43:52,460
to find them 100 meters from the pod?

2259
03:43:52,460 --> 03:43:54,460
I'm just going to pick a direction,

2260
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:56,460
go 100 meters, and then swim

2261
03:43:56,460 --> 03:43:58,460
around the pod 100 meters away from it.

2262
03:43:58,460 --> 03:44:00,460
Because how could that genuinely be so bad

2263
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:02,460
that I can't find these body fragments?

2264
03:44:04,460 --> 03:44:06,460
Is someone pranking me?

2265
03:44:06,460 --> 03:44:08,460
I'm starting to feel like I'm being pranked.

2266
03:44:08,460 --> 03:44:10,460
By the way, the trash can delete items you put in it.

2267
03:44:10,460 --> 03:44:12,460
No, I'm not going to make it.

2268
03:44:12,460 --> 03:44:14,460
Right, 100 meters. Here we go.

2269
03:44:14,460 --> 03:44:16,460
This is all we need. 100 meters.

2270
03:44:16,460 --> 03:44:18,460
Just for some fish.

2271
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:22,460
100 meters.

2272
03:44:22,460 --> 03:44:24,460
We just need to look for the e-bots.

2273
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:26,460
E-bots.

2274
03:44:28,460 --> 03:44:30,460
Fucking thing, you.

2275
03:44:30,460 --> 03:44:32,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Focus, focus.

2276
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:34,460
Your Mum's a focus.

2277
03:44:34,460 --> 03:44:36,460
Hmm.

2278
03:44:44,460 --> 03:44:46,460
The fragments can be found

2279
03:44:46,460 --> 03:44:48,460
in kelp forests in the safe shallows.

2280
03:44:48,460 --> 03:44:50,460
Kelp forests, kelp forests, kelp forests.

2281
03:44:50,460 --> 03:44:52,460
Right, that's not kelp forests.

2282
03:44:52,460 --> 03:44:54,460
Kelp forests is the other one this way.

2283
03:44:56,460 --> 03:44:58,460
Kelp forests in the shallows.

2284
03:44:58,460 --> 03:45:00,460
Kelp forests in the shallows.

2285
03:45:00,460 --> 03:45:02,460
Like in a car?

2286
03:45:02,460 --> 03:45:04,460
In a cave?

2287
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:06,460
Like this?

2288
03:45:06,460 --> 03:45:08,460
Oh, there it is.

2289
03:45:16,460 --> 03:45:18,460
I saw that.

2290
03:45:18,460 --> 03:45:20,460
That was a stalker tooth. Hold on, I need that to build something.

2291
03:45:20,460 --> 03:45:22,460
Hold on, I need that to build something.

2292
03:45:22,460 --> 03:45:24,460
Let me get oxygen.

2293
03:45:26,460 --> 03:45:28,460
There's a couple.

2294
03:45:28,460 --> 03:45:30,460
I see I'm bottom left.

2295
03:45:32,460 --> 03:45:34,460
Hmm.

2296
03:45:34,460 --> 03:45:36,460
Okay.

2297
03:45:36,460 --> 03:45:38,460
Okay, just go for it.

2298
03:45:38,460 --> 03:45:40,460
Just send it, send it.

2299
03:45:40,460 --> 03:45:42,460
I can send it.

2300
03:45:48,460 --> 03:45:50,460
I'm off.

2301
03:45:50,460 --> 03:45:52,460
Oh, an inventory is full.

2302
03:45:52,460 --> 03:45:54,460
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

2303
03:45:54,460 --> 03:45:56,460
An inventory is full.

2304
03:45:56,460 --> 03:45:58,460
My thing is so fucking hard right now.

2305
03:46:00,460 --> 03:46:02,460
Fuck off.

2306
03:46:04,460 --> 03:46:06,460
Yeah, you better fucking rotate, bitch.

2307
03:46:06,460 --> 03:46:08,460
Is it gonna come back?

2308
03:46:08,460 --> 03:46:10,460
Fuck off.

2309
03:46:10,460 --> 03:46:12,460
Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.

2310
03:46:12,460 --> 03:46:14,460
Right.

2311
03:46:20,460 --> 03:46:22,460
Oh yeah, piss off too.

2312
03:46:22,460 --> 03:46:24,460
Good.

2313
03:46:24,460 --> 03:46:26,460
I'm trying to jump spear, man.

2314
03:46:28,460 --> 03:46:30,460
Is it here? No, it's not here.

2315
03:46:34,460 --> 03:46:36,460
Oh my god.

2316
03:46:38,460 --> 03:46:40,460
There was another tooth here.

2317
03:46:40,460 --> 03:46:42,460
Oh shit.

2318
03:46:42,460 --> 03:46:44,460
I need that for something.

2319
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:46,460
I don't know what, but I need it for something.

2320
03:46:50,460 --> 03:46:52,460
I just draw a titanium because it's really common.

2321
03:46:52,460 --> 03:46:54,460
But these teeth aren't.

2322
03:46:54,460 --> 03:46:56,460
What the fuck is it?

2323
03:47:00,460 --> 03:47:02,460
I'm gonna fart out of frustration.

2324
03:47:02,460 --> 03:47:04,460
I swear it again.

2325
03:47:04,460 --> 03:47:06,460
Is it like obvious?

2326
03:47:06,460 --> 03:47:08,460
And because it's obvious, my brain is like ignoring it?

2327
03:47:08,460 --> 03:47:10,460
No, that's just neat.

2328
03:47:10,460 --> 03:47:12,460
Salvage.

2329
03:47:12,460 --> 03:47:14,460
No, it's slowly coming.

2330
03:47:14,460 --> 03:47:16,460
My god.

2331
03:47:16,460 --> 03:47:18,460
No, don't pick up fucking random pieces.

2332
03:47:18,460 --> 03:47:20,460
Yeah, you better, ow.

2333
03:47:22,460 --> 03:47:24,460
Can we jump out of me, honestly?

2334
03:47:26,460 --> 03:47:28,460
Nah, I need it in kelp forest.

2335
03:47:30,460 --> 03:47:32,460
Has mummy found anything?

2336
03:47:32,460 --> 03:47:34,460
Mummy's done a sweet air fall.

2337
03:47:36,460 --> 03:47:38,460
This?

2338
03:47:38,460 --> 03:47:40,460
Does it look like it?

2339
03:47:42,460 --> 03:47:44,460
I just need one.

2340
03:47:44,460 --> 03:47:46,460
Is it you? No.

2341
03:47:46,460 --> 03:47:48,460
Yes!

2342
03:47:48,460 --> 03:47:50,460
Ah!

2343
03:47:52,460 --> 03:47:54,460
Ah!

2344
03:47:54,460 --> 03:47:56,460
Fuck! That took so long.

2345
03:47:58,460 --> 03:48:00,460
That took so long.

2346
03:48:00,460 --> 03:48:02,460
That took me four hours to find out.

2347
03:48:02,460 --> 03:48:04,460
And it was like a hundred yards away.

2348
03:48:08,460 --> 03:48:10,460
Right.

2349
03:48:10,460 --> 03:48:12,460
So now I go in here and make something.

2350
03:48:14,460 --> 03:48:16,460
What do I make?

2351
03:48:18,460 --> 03:48:20,460
I don't know what I make.

2352
03:48:20,460 --> 03:48:22,460
I don't know.

2353
03:48:22,460 --> 03:48:24,460
A sea board thing?

2354
03:48:24,460 --> 03:48:26,460
I don't know where I make it.

2355
03:48:26,460 --> 03:48:28,460
I don't know.

2356
03:48:28,460 --> 03:48:30,460
Hold on.

2357
03:48:30,460 --> 03:48:32,460
Is it in here I make it?

2358
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:36,460
Progress that only took me fucking forever.

2359
03:48:38,460 --> 03:48:40,460
Copper wire and titanium.

2360
03:48:40,460 --> 03:48:42,460
And I've got it!

2361
03:48:42,460 --> 03:48:44,460
Fucking Christmas, medical!

2362
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:48,460
Right. Need what?

2363
03:48:48,460 --> 03:48:50,460
What did I need?

2364
03:48:50,460 --> 03:48:52,460
Titanium and copper wire.

2365
03:48:52,460 --> 03:48:54,460
Titanium, go!

2366
03:48:54,460 --> 03:48:56,460
Oh, sorry I didn't need to jump there.

2367
03:48:56,460 --> 03:48:58,460
Titanium!

2368
03:48:58,460 --> 03:49:00,460
Copper, sorry. One, two, and give it a...

2369
03:49:00,460 --> 03:49:02,460
Oh no, I fucking have some supply.

2370
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:04,460
Just a few of these supplies.

2371
03:49:04,460 --> 03:49:06,460
Nothing major.

2372
03:49:06,460 --> 03:49:08,460
A copper wire?

2373
03:49:10,460 --> 03:49:12,460
A copper wire.

2374
03:49:12,460 --> 03:49:14,460
Okay.

2375
03:49:18,460 --> 03:49:20,460
Oh!

2376
03:49:22,460 --> 03:49:24,460
Right. And how does this work?

2377
03:49:36,460 --> 03:49:38,460
Okay.

2378
03:49:38,460 --> 03:49:40,460
Right, let's grab this now.

2379
03:49:42,460 --> 03:49:44,460
And then of course I can't just drop fucking shite in here.

2380
03:49:44,460 --> 03:49:46,460
It's gonna be too easy.

2381
03:49:46,460 --> 03:49:48,460
I'm gonna drop shite here instead.

2382
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:50,460
Fuck you.

2383
03:49:50,460 --> 03:49:52,460
I'm not...

2384
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:54,460
Oh my god, you can't just drop...

2385
03:50:10,460 --> 03:50:14,460
I swear this doesn't work the way I want it to.

2386
03:50:14,460 --> 03:50:16,460
Okay.

2387
03:50:18,460 --> 03:50:20,460
Take everything.

2388
03:50:20,460 --> 03:50:24,460
Take every single little thing I've ordered to scavenge.

2389
03:50:24,460 --> 03:50:26,460
I'm gonna keep the purple tablet on me

2390
03:50:26,460 --> 03:50:28,460
in case you somehow randomly come across

2391
03:50:28,460 --> 03:50:32,460
the ease of a power swirl.

2392
03:50:32,460 --> 03:50:34,460
I'll keep that.

2393
03:50:34,460 --> 03:50:36,460
Right! How do I quit the miserable thing?

2394
03:50:36,460 --> 03:50:38,460
I don't know.

2395
03:50:42,460 --> 03:50:44,460
I don't know.

2396
03:50:44,460 --> 03:50:46,460
And I have a new radio signal,

2397
03:50:46,460 --> 03:50:48,460
so I assume it's gonna tell me somewhere to go.

2398
03:50:48,460 --> 03:50:50,460
Slot one through five.

2399
03:50:50,460 --> 03:50:52,460
What did you call me?

2400
03:50:52,460 --> 03:50:54,460
Did you just write me?

2401
03:51:06,460 --> 03:51:12,460
There's a bit more than just radiation

2402
03:51:12,460 --> 03:51:14,460
between...

2403
03:51:14,460 --> 03:51:16,460
There's a wee bit more than just radiation

2404
03:51:16,460 --> 03:51:18,460
between us, Lava.

2405
03:51:18,460 --> 03:51:20,460
Can I show you that much?

2406
03:51:22,460 --> 03:51:24,460
Right.

2407
03:51:24,460 --> 03:51:26,460
The purple cavern has diamonds in it.

2408
03:51:28,460 --> 03:51:30,460
Which is that direction?

2409
03:51:30,460 --> 03:51:32,460
And then I can get the laser

2410
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:34,460
and I can go in something.

2411
03:51:34,460 --> 03:51:36,460
Okay, now just hold it and swim.

2412
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:38,460
Pod six is a red grassland.

2413
03:51:38,460 --> 03:51:40,460
The sharks.

2414
03:51:40,460 --> 03:51:42,460
Oh, I've already investigated it.

2415
03:51:42,460 --> 03:51:44,460
Mummy can be my slot reel.

2416
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:48,460
Oh!

2417
03:51:56,460 --> 03:51:58,460
Oh my gosh!

2418
03:52:00,460 --> 03:52:02,460
It's so...

2419
03:52:02,460 --> 03:52:04,460
I'm zooming!

2420
03:52:06,460 --> 03:52:08,460
It's so fast!

2421
03:52:08,460 --> 03:52:10,460
Where's the purple cavern?

2422
03:52:10,460 --> 03:52:12,460
Is it not right here?

2423
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:18,460
Toggle light?

2424
03:52:18,460 --> 03:52:20,460
Toggle map?

2425
03:52:20,460 --> 03:52:22,460
Oh my god!

2426
03:52:22,460 --> 03:52:24,460
Wait, where's the purple cavern?

2427
03:52:24,460 --> 03:52:26,460
I've lost it.

2428
03:52:26,460 --> 03:52:28,460
Is it not on the edge?

2429
03:52:28,460 --> 03:52:30,460
I mean, we could just go down to the light pod instead then.

2430
03:52:34,460 --> 03:52:36,460
Is that the Reaper of the Honest Wreck?

2431
03:52:36,460 --> 03:52:38,460
Fuck it, we're going over here.

2432
03:52:38,460 --> 03:52:40,460
I don't know where it is. I'm scared.

2433
03:52:40,460 --> 03:52:42,460
Oh my gosh! It's so fast!

2434
03:52:50,460 --> 03:52:52,460
Oh, there's the fissure!

2435
03:52:52,460 --> 03:52:54,460
One of you told me that in the fissure

2436
03:52:54,460 --> 03:52:56,460
there's diamonds down here.

2437
03:52:56,460 --> 03:52:58,460
Hold on.

2438
03:52:58,460 --> 03:53:00,460
Let it blow!

2439
03:53:00,460 --> 03:53:02,460
Let it blow!

2440
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:04,460
We're camping a fissure right now.

2441
03:53:04,460 --> 03:53:06,460
Are you ready?

2442
03:53:08,460 --> 03:53:10,460
Go a little bit too over there.

2443
03:53:10,460 --> 03:53:12,460
It all burns?

2444
03:53:14,460 --> 03:53:16,460
What? It always burns?

2445
03:53:16,460 --> 03:53:18,460
No matter what?

2446
03:53:20,460 --> 03:53:22,460
I didn't expect that.

2447
03:53:22,460 --> 03:53:24,460
Why are you still going in?

2448
03:53:24,460 --> 03:53:26,460
I thought it was a timed event

2449
03:53:26,460 --> 03:53:28,460
where you're supposed to go down a little bit.

2450
03:53:28,460 --> 03:53:30,460
Right, let's make our way over here.

2451
03:53:32,460 --> 03:53:34,460
It's superheated water.

2452
03:53:34,460 --> 03:53:36,460
It's a thermal vent.

2453
03:53:36,460 --> 03:53:38,460
That makes more sense.

2454
03:53:40,460 --> 03:53:42,460
Now, when you put it like that...

2455
03:53:42,460 --> 03:53:44,460
Wait, my power is only 91%?

2456
03:53:48,460 --> 03:53:50,460
What are you? Did you just spawn in?

2457
03:53:50,460 --> 03:53:52,460
Oh, you're playing with metal.

2458
03:53:56,460 --> 03:53:58,460
Why do they play with metal?

2459
03:54:00,460 --> 03:54:02,460
There's two more.

2460
03:54:04,460 --> 03:54:06,460
Scan the boxes.

2461
03:54:06,460 --> 03:54:08,460
This one right here.

2462
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:10,460
What is it?

2463
03:54:10,460 --> 03:54:12,460
There's something juicy inside.

2464
03:54:14,460 --> 03:54:16,460
Mobile vehicle.

2465
03:54:16,460 --> 03:54:18,460
The fragments.

2466
03:54:20,460 --> 03:54:22,460
God, they love playing with metal.

2467
03:54:22,460 --> 03:54:24,460
They're like...

2468
03:54:24,460 --> 03:54:26,460
Oh, there's another box there.

2469
03:54:26,460 --> 03:54:28,460
Oh, cheeky box.

2470
03:54:28,460 --> 03:54:30,460
Mummy, aren't you playing?

2471
03:54:30,460 --> 03:54:32,460
No, no, attack someone else.

2472
03:54:32,460 --> 03:54:34,460
I'm going for parts.

2473
03:54:34,460 --> 03:54:36,460
Give me, give me, give me.

2474
03:54:38,460 --> 03:54:40,460
How does this happen?

2475
03:54:42,460 --> 03:54:44,460
I didn't have nothing on me for ages.

2476
03:54:44,460 --> 03:54:46,460
And then, all of a sudden,

2477
03:54:46,460 --> 03:54:48,460
they all come flying at me.

2478
03:54:48,460 --> 03:54:50,460
Like...

2479
03:54:50,460 --> 03:54:52,460
Even bigger upgrade?

2480
03:54:52,460 --> 03:54:54,460
Wait, I'm going back to get whatever this is.

2481
03:54:54,460 --> 03:54:56,460
You're saying it's an even bigger upgrade?

2482
03:54:56,460 --> 03:54:58,460
We've got a vehicle?

2483
03:55:02,460 --> 03:55:04,460
No more smooth brain time.

2484
03:55:04,460 --> 03:55:06,460
I'm behaving.

2485
03:55:06,460 --> 03:55:08,460
Am I being chased?

2486
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:10,460
Nah, I seem okay.

2487
03:55:12,460 --> 03:55:14,460
Okay.

2488
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:16,460
You can make the sea more.

2489
03:55:16,460 --> 03:55:18,460
Use your glider for swimming.

2490
03:55:18,460 --> 03:55:20,460
Well, I don't want to use the battery up.

2491
03:55:20,460 --> 03:55:22,460
The battery...

2492
03:55:22,460 --> 03:55:24,460
I can't be arsed getting one.

2493
03:55:24,460 --> 03:55:26,460
Oh fuck, that's so much faster though.

2494
03:55:26,460 --> 03:55:28,460
Damn, they got me.

2495
03:55:28,460 --> 03:55:30,460
They got me. Right, how do I make this fucking mammoth thing?

2496
03:55:30,460 --> 03:55:32,460
Oh, with the...

2497
03:55:32,460 --> 03:55:34,460
This thing.

2498
03:55:34,460 --> 03:55:36,460
Right, drop these, then I need these.

2499
03:55:40,460 --> 03:55:42,460
Habitat Builder.

2500
03:55:42,460 --> 03:55:44,460
Pop that one.

2501
03:55:44,460 --> 03:55:46,460
And then, please make...

2502
03:55:48,460 --> 03:55:50,460
Not mammoth thing?

2503
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:52,460
I'm going to blow it off, but...

2504
03:55:52,460 --> 03:55:54,460
Is it going to be used? No.

2505
03:55:56,460 --> 03:55:58,460
You actually build the vehicle bait in the crafter.

2506
03:55:58,460 --> 03:56:00,460
Of course you do, because why wouldn't you smile?

2507
03:56:00,460 --> 03:56:02,460
In the crafter.

2508
03:56:04,460 --> 03:56:06,460
This.

2509
03:56:08,460 --> 03:56:10,460
I just need a lube.

2510
03:56:10,460 --> 03:56:12,460
Okay.

2511
03:56:14,460 --> 03:56:16,460
One lube. One of these.

2512
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:18,460
And then that's it.

2513
03:56:22,460 --> 03:56:24,460
That's like a fidget spinner.

2514
03:56:24,460 --> 03:56:26,460
Brain rot.

2515
03:56:26,460 --> 03:56:28,460
Lube is required to go ahead.

2516
03:56:30,460 --> 03:56:32,460
Right, and what is it?

2517
03:56:34,460 --> 03:56:36,460
It goes on the surface?

2518
03:56:38,460 --> 03:56:40,460
What is it?

2519
03:56:40,460 --> 03:56:42,460
How do I use that?

2520
03:56:42,460 --> 03:56:44,460
I can fill up that.

2521
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:46,460
Make it like a food?

2522
03:56:54,460 --> 03:56:56,460
And what do you do exactly?

2523
03:56:56,460 --> 03:56:58,460
Whoa!

2524
03:56:58,460 --> 03:57:00,460
What's that? Claim?

2525
03:57:00,460 --> 03:57:02,460
And what do you do? Claim?

2526
03:57:02,460 --> 03:57:04,460
I'm already on it. Use for you, puppy.

2527
03:57:04,460 --> 03:57:06,460
Lube, lead, glass, titanium, power cell.

2528
03:57:10,460 --> 03:57:12,460
Lube, lead, glass,

2529
03:57:12,460 --> 03:57:14,460
titanium, power cell.

2530
03:57:14,460 --> 03:57:16,460
Lube, lead, glass,

2531
03:57:16,460 --> 03:57:18,460
titanium,

2532
03:57:18,460 --> 03:57:20,460
power cell.

2533
03:57:20,460 --> 03:57:22,460
Lube, lead, and glass.

2534
03:57:22,460 --> 03:57:24,460
Can you... You guys can just count them.

2535
03:57:24,460 --> 03:57:26,460
I don't want you to use all your supplies.

2536
03:57:26,460 --> 03:57:28,460
Lube, lead,

2537
03:57:28,460 --> 03:57:30,460
lube,

2538
03:57:30,460 --> 03:57:32,460
lead, glass.

2539
03:57:32,460 --> 03:57:34,460
Okay, lube is these.

2540
03:57:36,460 --> 03:57:38,460
And I think I have everything else.

2541
03:57:38,460 --> 03:57:40,460
If you pin the rest,

2542
03:57:40,460 --> 03:57:42,460
you don't need to remember. Oh, they actually fill up that.

2543
03:57:42,460 --> 03:57:44,460
I can't believe that. Right, let's take some lube.

2544
03:57:48,460 --> 03:57:50,460
Lube, lead, glass, titanium,

2545
03:57:50,460 --> 03:57:52,460
power cell.

2546
03:57:52,460 --> 03:57:54,460
Lube,

2547
03:57:54,460 --> 03:57:56,460
lead,

2548
03:57:56,460 --> 03:57:58,460
lube,

2549
03:57:58,460 --> 03:58:00,460
lube, lube,

2550
03:58:00,460 --> 03:58:02,460
lube, lube, lube, lube.

2551
03:58:02,460 --> 03:58:04,460
Alright, let's make lube.

2552
03:58:04,460 --> 03:58:06,460
Okay,

2553
03:58:06,460 --> 03:58:08,460
bottle of lube.

2554
03:58:08,460 --> 03:58:10,460
And then let's check her inventory for the lead.

2555
03:58:16,460 --> 03:58:18,460
I did not need that much for lubricant.

2556
03:58:18,460 --> 03:58:20,460
Holy crap.

2557
03:58:20,460 --> 03:58:22,460
Lube, lead,

2558
03:58:22,460 --> 03:58:24,460
I need titanium,

2559
03:58:24,460 --> 03:58:26,460
I need 10 titanium for that.

2560
03:58:26,460 --> 03:58:28,460
So, one of you,

2561
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:30,460
that's five.

2562
03:58:30,460 --> 03:58:32,460
Then,

2563
03:58:32,460 --> 03:58:34,460
mm-hmm,

2564
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:36,460
I need five more.

2565
03:58:36,460 --> 03:58:38,460
So, of course, it's not going to be

2566
03:58:38,460 --> 03:58:40,460
around when I'm looking for it, Tini.

2567
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:42,460
That's why it would be.

2568
03:58:44,460 --> 03:58:46,460
Is there any titanium left?

2569
03:58:46,460 --> 03:58:48,460
One, six,

2570
03:58:48,460 --> 03:58:50,460
seven,

2571
03:58:52,460 --> 03:58:54,460
seven,

2572
03:58:54,460 --> 03:58:56,460
eight, nine,

2573
03:58:56,460 --> 03:58:58,460
ten.

2574
03:58:58,460 --> 03:59:00,460
Okay,

2575
03:59:00,460 --> 03:59:02,460
and ten going to be not here.

2576
03:59:04,460 --> 03:59:06,460
Ten.

2577
03:59:06,460 --> 03:59:08,460
Don't make me moan, I'll do it.

2578
03:59:10,460 --> 03:59:12,460
I think I got a horse.

2579
03:59:14,460 --> 03:59:16,460
And, of course, it starts.

2580
03:59:16,460 --> 03:59:18,460
I can't do anything.

2581
03:59:18,460 --> 03:59:20,460
You can pick up some metal.

2582
03:59:20,460 --> 03:59:22,460
Moan, you won't.

2583
03:59:26,460 --> 03:59:28,460
Maybe I don't want to boost the light on it.

2584
03:59:28,460 --> 03:59:30,460
I can't be arch-crafted in more barriers.

2585
03:59:32,460 --> 03:59:34,460
I probably should, though, if we're going

2586
03:59:34,460 --> 03:59:36,460
exploring.

2587
03:59:36,460 --> 03:59:38,460
Let me guess, this is that thing I needed?

2588
03:59:40,460 --> 03:59:42,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2589
03:59:42,460 --> 03:59:44,460
Okay, we have the

2590
03:59:44,460 --> 03:59:46,460
titanium.

2591
03:59:46,460 --> 03:59:48,460
Yeah, of course.

2592
03:59:48,460 --> 03:59:50,460
Literally, of course it is.

2593
03:59:50,460 --> 03:59:52,460
Of course it is.

2594
03:59:52,460 --> 03:59:54,460
Oh, I should fall and try to go unbanned.

2595
03:59:54,460 --> 03:59:56,460
I'm right.

2596
03:59:56,460 --> 03:59:58,460
Sorry, I don't know what kind of ultimate shit that was, but...

2597
04:00:24,460 --> 04:00:26,460
Okay.

2598
04:00:34,460 --> 04:00:36,460
I need four quarts

2599
04:00:36,460 --> 04:00:38,460
for glass, right?

2600
04:00:38,460 --> 04:00:40,460
Easy, please, don't want to squeeze it.

2601
04:00:40,460 --> 04:00:42,460
I do love just dropping everything right at this place.

2602
04:00:42,460 --> 04:00:44,460
Under the tree.

2603
04:00:50,460 --> 04:00:52,460
Okay, and then the power cell.

2604
04:00:52,460 --> 04:00:54,460
So we need to make

2605
04:00:54,460 --> 04:00:56,460
two batteries

2606
04:00:56,460 --> 04:00:58,460
in silicone rubber.

2607
04:01:00,460 --> 04:01:02,460
Okay, I'm...

2608
04:01:02,460 --> 04:01:04,460
Silicon rubber check.

2609
04:01:04,460 --> 04:01:06,460
And then, if I'm not mistaken, two batteries

2610
04:01:06,460 --> 04:01:08,460
which is two coffers.

2611
04:01:14,460 --> 04:01:16,460
Two acid

2612
04:01:16,460 --> 04:01:18,460
mushrooms and two coffers.

2613
04:01:22,460 --> 04:01:24,460
I'll do it.

2614
04:01:24,460 --> 04:01:26,460
That's unfortunate.

2615
04:01:26,460 --> 04:01:28,460
I only have one.

2616
04:01:28,460 --> 04:01:30,460
Another one, please.

2617
04:01:32,460 --> 04:01:34,460
Are you called for?

2618
04:01:34,460 --> 04:01:36,460
Perfect, and then one of you,

2619
04:01:36,460 --> 04:01:38,460
two of you, three and four.

2620
04:01:38,460 --> 04:01:40,460
And then we have built the

2621
04:01:40,460 --> 04:01:42,460
behemoth, behemoth, behemoth.

2622
04:01:46,460 --> 04:01:48,460
Right.

2623
04:01:48,460 --> 04:01:50,460
Battery.

2624
04:01:50,460 --> 04:01:52,460
Also, hi.

2625
04:01:54,460 --> 04:01:56,460
How much are you enjoying the game? It is a good game.

2626
04:01:58,460 --> 04:02:00,460
Uh...

2627
04:02:00,460 --> 04:02:02,460
Obviously, the only problem is

2628
04:02:02,460 --> 04:02:04,460
I'm too dumb to play it, but...

2629
04:02:04,460 --> 04:02:06,460
It's not gonna stop me, okay?

2630
04:02:06,460 --> 04:02:08,460
Right, is that everything?

2631
04:02:08,460 --> 04:02:10,460
A ball of war just tried to jump me, did you see that?

2632
04:02:10,460 --> 04:02:12,460
Right, this.

2633
04:02:12,460 --> 04:02:14,460
Hello, claim.

2634
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:16,460
Right, claim.

2635
04:02:16,460 --> 04:02:18,460
It's gonna make it.

2636
04:02:20,460 --> 04:02:22,460
Oh!

2637
04:02:26,460 --> 04:02:28,460
My gluteus maximus.

2638
04:02:30,460 --> 04:02:32,460
Uh...

2639
04:02:32,460 --> 04:02:34,460
Right, before we take off,

2640
04:02:34,460 --> 04:02:36,460
I am going to replace

2641
04:02:36,460 --> 04:02:38,460
the battery in...

2642
04:02:38,460 --> 04:02:40,460
this. I need two coffers.

2643
04:02:42,460 --> 04:02:44,460
I need two coffers and four

2644
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:46,460
acid thingamobobbers.

2645
04:02:46,460 --> 04:02:48,460
And then I'm gonna replace

2646
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:50,460
the batteries and all this, because

2647
04:02:50,460 --> 04:02:52,460
if I'm going to explore in deep, deep depth,

2648
04:02:52,460 --> 04:02:54,460
I'm going with

2649
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:56,460
full batteries.

2650
04:02:56,460 --> 04:02:58,460
Battery.

2651
04:02:58,460 --> 04:03:00,460
One and two, and then we'll go

2652
04:03:00,460 --> 04:03:02,460
make our batteries, replace

2653
04:03:02,460 --> 04:03:04,460
everything that we need, and then

2654
04:03:04,460 --> 04:03:06,460
we're off-ski. We're actually

2655
04:03:06,460 --> 04:03:08,460
call me a crystal

2656
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:10,460
Serovski, because

2657
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:12,460
oh, dear lord, we're off-ski.

2658
04:03:13,460 --> 04:03:15,460
You'll feel so safe in that.

2659
04:03:19,460 --> 04:03:21,460
Okay, right, and then R

2660
04:03:21,460 --> 04:03:23,460
to reload.

2661
04:03:23,460 --> 04:03:25,460
Oh, I might see.

2662
04:03:25,460 --> 04:03:27,460
Okay.

2663
04:03:27,460 --> 04:03:29,460
You can select.

2664
04:03:29,460 --> 04:03:31,460
Oh my god, so what are we going to do?

2665
04:03:32,460 --> 04:03:34,460
Okay, and I enter.

2666
04:03:34,460 --> 04:03:36,460
Then click. Okay.

2667
04:03:38,460 --> 04:03:40,460
Uh, then...

2668
04:03:40,460 --> 04:03:42,460
That's it. Just drop off whatever I

2669
04:03:42,460 --> 04:03:43,460
don't need, and then we go in the

2670
04:03:43,460 --> 04:03:45,460
behemoth.

2671
04:03:45,460 --> 04:03:46,460
Drop that, drop that.

2672
04:03:46,460 --> 04:03:48,460
Need to see Glider.

2673
04:03:48,460 --> 04:03:49,460
Don't need that right now, don't need that

2674
04:03:49,460 --> 04:03:51,460
right now.

2675
04:03:51,460 --> 04:03:53,460
We'll take the alien tablet with us, and

2676
04:03:53,460 --> 04:03:55,460
then...

2677
04:03:55,460 --> 04:03:57,460
What do you do, exactly?

2678
04:03:58,460 --> 04:04:00,460
Enter?

2679
04:04:00,460 --> 04:04:02,460
Does it update?

2680
04:04:04,460 --> 04:04:06,460
Um...

2681
04:04:06,460 --> 04:04:08,460
Right, I guess.

2682
04:04:08,460 --> 04:04:10,460
We'll go...

2683
04:04:13,460 --> 04:04:15,460
Do I need to get batteries for it or something?

2684
04:04:16,460 --> 04:04:18,460
Does it...

2685
04:04:18,460 --> 04:04:20,460
Does it, like, heal...

2686
04:04:20,460 --> 04:04:22,460
Did I just drive by a fish right there?

2687
04:04:22,460 --> 04:04:24,460
Did you hear that? I think I just drove

2688
04:04:24,460 --> 04:04:26,460
by a fish.

2689
04:04:26,460 --> 04:04:28,460
Ran it over.

2690
04:04:28,460 --> 04:04:30,460
It uses power cells...

2691
04:04:30,460 --> 04:04:32,460
to...

2692
04:04:32,460 --> 04:04:34,460
em...

2693
04:04:34,460 --> 04:04:36,460
that.

2694
04:04:36,460 --> 04:04:38,460
I think I'm going to be wasting that, you know?

2695
04:04:38,460 --> 04:04:40,460
A little speed bump.

2696
04:04:40,460 --> 04:04:42,460
You will hit fish as you look here.

2697
04:04:42,460 --> 04:04:44,460
Hi, Mr. Whale.

2698
04:04:45,460 --> 04:04:47,460
Hey, where your wife is?

2699
04:04:50,460 --> 04:04:53,460
So, I need to make batteries...

2700
04:04:53,460 --> 04:04:55,460
repair with your toolkit.

2701
04:04:55,460 --> 04:04:57,460
I have to repair it?

2702
04:04:57,460 --> 04:04:59,460
Right.

2703
04:04:59,460 --> 04:05:00,460
Yes, you can run over a fish and

2704
04:05:00,460 --> 04:05:02,460
suckers, but I'll get damage. Okay.

2705
04:05:02,460 --> 04:05:04,460
System error.

2706
04:05:04,460 --> 04:05:06,460
Issue detected with playback of

2707
04:05:06,460 --> 04:05:08,460
recorded stream.

2708
04:05:08,460 --> 04:05:10,460
Oh, yeah?

2709
04:05:10,460 --> 04:05:12,460
Starting stream from the beginning.

2710
04:05:12,460 --> 04:05:14,460
In five seconds, the streamer will begin

2711
04:05:14,460 --> 04:05:16,460
with her greetings.

2712
04:05:16,460 --> 04:05:18,460
Stop!

2713
04:05:18,460 --> 04:05:20,460
I go, hi, Vodling.

2714
04:05:20,460 --> 04:05:22,460
Thank you, pre-recorded stream bot.

2715
04:05:22,460 --> 04:05:24,460
This is not pre-recorded for anyone that's lurking

2716
04:05:24,460 --> 04:05:26,460
in the shadows. It is a meme.

2717
04:05:26,460 --> 04:05:28,460
It's a gag. We say that it's pre-recorded

2718
04:05:28,460 --> 04:05:30,460
because I only game for

2719
04:05:30,460 --> 04:05:32,460
male attention, all that kind of stuff.

2720
04:05:32,460 --> 04:05:34,460
So, my oxygen doesn't go down

2721
04:05:34,460 --> 04:05:36,460
at all inside this pod.

2722
04:05:36,460 --> 04:05:38,460
Can I, like, drop myself

2723
04:05:38,460 --> 04:05:40,460
off at, like, an inspection

2724
04:05:40,460 --> 04:05:42,460
site and then put myself back in the pod?

2725
04:05:44,460 --> 04:05:46,460
Oh, my gosh. Look at them.

2726
04:05:46,460 --> 04:05:48,460
Aren't they fascinating?

2727
04:05:48,460 --> 04:05:50,460
They must be aggressive,

2728
04:05:50,460 --> 04:05:52,460
but there's so many of them. That's not fair.

2729
04:05:56,460 --> 04:05:58,460
Aggressive.

2730
04:05:58,460 --> 04:06:00,460
Oh, jeez.

2731
04:06:00,460 --> 04:06:02,460
They look so beautiful, though.

2732
04:06:06,460 --> 04:06:08,460
Are they aggressive?

2733
04:06:08,460 --> 04:06:10,460
Maybe not.

2734
04:06:10,460 --> 04:06:12,460
No.

2735
04:06:12,460 --> 04:06:14,460
Alright, alright, alright. Relax, relax.

2736
04:06:16,460 --> 04:06:18,460
Relax, relax.

2737
04:06:20,460 --> 04:06:22,460
What does her thing say?

2738
04:06:24,460 --> 04:06:26,460
What does her thing say?

2739
04:06:28,460 --> 04:06:30,460
What does her thing say?

2740
04:06:30,460 --> 04:06:32,460
My...

2741
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:34,460
What is that next one?

2742
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:36,460
No, that one. Fuck that.

2743
04:06:58,460 --> 04:07:22,580
can the Reaper gobble me up inside this be honest I did some very German

2882
04:26:19,980 --> 04:26:25,180
uh it'll take us a couple of days to align our orbit should be able to establish direct

2883
04:26:25,180 --> 04:26:30,060
contact with you during that time then we're coming in to get you cross your fingers the

2884

did I even need to do anything I mean I've got diamonds

2888
04:26:54,780 --> 04:26:59,340
okay the good ending right I even bother about making the laser beam then

2889
04:27:01,020 --> 04:27:07,900
I mean I could try and make it a propulsion cannon I'm five laser cutter any self-made sure

2890
04:27:11,180 --> 04:27:14,540
why not let's make the laser cutter in case I come across something that needs to

2891
04:27:16,060 --> 04:27:18,060
sure

2892
04:27:20,060 --> 04:27:25,580

2893
04:27:25,900 --> 04:27:32,460
uh where is it not that way oh that way okay

2894
04:27:35,900 --> 04:27:37,420

we only have 79 battery almost I hope that's not gonna be a problem

2896
04:27:46,940 --> 04:27:51,900
then again we do be getting real quick so I'm not sure if it is gonna be a problem

04:27:52,460 --> 04:27:54,460
um

2898
04:27:57,340 --> 04:28:02,700
do you know you have 30 minutes 30 minutes yeah 30 minutes

2899
04:28:05,980 --> 04:28:12,460
don't beach it is that possible I can beach to my own so we've been this way before probably

2900
04:28:15,260 --> 04:28:18,700
it's a bit harder to see because there's like more interface in the way

2901
04:28:19,500 --> 04:28:26,700
okay this is the green sea what did it just spawn in there I saw that what did you just spawn in there

2902
04:28:28,860 --> 04:28:34,460
what was oh sorry sorry I'm still learning how to control this uh it's one done something

2903
04:28:34,460 --> 04:28:39,020
stressful oh my god cheat see doodle in I'm cheat see doodle in

2904
04:28:39,020 --> 04:28:47,260
oh wait is this the thing I need to get inside

2905
04:28:50,220 --> 04:28:59,500
oh is it not it's just crash thing oh imagine if I oh oh you'll never guess what you'll never

2906
04:28:59,500 --> 04:29:07,900
guess what watch this oh look at that scale look at that scale make sure you've got your dwee

2907
04:29:07,900 --> 04:29:12,620
am I controlling this or is it just going for it oh my god look at that scale

2908
04:29:14,780 --> 04:29:21,980
look at that I'm such a wielder I'm such a wielder what's in here show me

2909
04:29:22,300 --> 04:29:23,180
ah boom

2910
04:29:36,460 --> 04:29:41,500
oh I like how the game gives you a chance if you're a dumbass they're like oh you can just go

2911
04:29:41,500 --> 04:29:45,180
that way so it's got fragment sure

2912
04:29:47,980 --> 04:29:51,580
where it got it another fragment

2913
04:29:53,740 --> 04:29:57,180
yeah of course now that I've got it all of them start showing off everywhere

2914
04:29:58,220 --> 04:30:02,060
right let's go in the behemoth where is it

2915
04:30:02,540 --> 04:30:14,620
where is it why is there no cross here same way oh there it's oh it's the sea mess not the behemoth

2916
04:30:14,620 --> 04:30:23,580
sorry okay here we go welcome aboard captain okay we need to have more of that luck again

2917
04:30:23,580 --> 04:30:30,460
that render distance luck yeah let's do more of that let's lock in on that this game is too scary

2918
04:30:30,460 --> 04:30:36,060
I thought I mean I did get scared I mean not to get political or anything I may or may not

2919
04:30:36,060 --> 04:30:43,500
have screamed at a certain bit but overall heart rate's been on the low side he's a behemoth of a

2920
04:30:43,500 --> 04:30:56,140
sea myth he is such a good boy 28 degrees inside oh I just realized my hair is covering up the

2921
04:30:56,220 --> 04:31:02,780
temperature gauge should I put myself left honestly the problem is right this is just the green

2922
04:31:02,780 --> 04:31:15,500
sea we've been here before oh hello oh we've not been here before yes we're reading marshmallows

2923
04:31:15,500 --> 04:31:24,380
for the next 35 minutes don't mind me I do seem to have grown some balls

2924
04:31:27,100 --> 04:31:33,180
cannot identify I don't have the purple thing on me thank god right you stay there a behemoth

2925
04:31:33,180 --> 04:31:42,460
you've done me so proud thank you hello let me get my knife though because I don't trust the

2926
04:31:42,460 --> 04:31:53,260
location at all I go in that can I go in it

2927
04:31:56,140 --> 04:32:00,620
oh my god I can't believe we're playing Halo this entire time you guys pranked me

2928
04:32:00,620 --> 04:32:05,900
we're playing Halo this entire time I knew you liked the series too hello

2929
04:32:05,900 --> 04:32:14,300
hello hello oh my gosh I have what you like

2930
04:32:17,580 --> 04:32:21,500
when the alien versus predator is going what the fuck is going on in this continent

2931
04:32:21,500 --> 04:32:27,020
scans indicate this structure is composed of a metal alloy with unprecedented integrity

2932
04:32:27,580 --> 04:32:33,260
no matches found in database performing structure analysis

2933
04:32:35,100 --> 04:32:35,580
hello

2934
04:32:40,460 --> 04:32:46,780
hello anyone home I like what you've done with the place it's kind of like alien

2935
04:32:46,780 --> 04:32:53,660
dwarven inspiration got the green light oh you look important

2936
04:32:56,620 --> 04:33:08,700
you look very important demo data unknown language attempting translation okay alien data terminal

2937
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:18,700
discovered inside an alien facility it is not possible to translate any useful information

2938
04:33:18,700 --> 04:33:23,260
however scans have returned some information on the device itself it's likely a solid state

2939
04:33:23,260 --> 04:33:28,060
computer although there is no clear way to interface with it on approach it began producing

2940
04:33:28,060 --> 04:33:34,700
a low frequency radio wave containing complex but recognizable data patterns it is likely the alien

2941
04:33:34,780 --> 04:33:42,620
species which does end this technology evolved or genetically selected sensory apparatus here

2942
04:33:43,180 --> 04:33:46,940
and understand the information being broadcast by the device and to communicate back

2943
04:33:48,300 --> 04:33:52,780
whales and radials is that what it's talking about the metal process and power required to

2944
04:33:52,780 --> 04:33:58,060
perform this kind of telepathy would imply the designs were considerably more psychologically

2945
04:33:58,060 --> 04:34:08,540
developed than the common human huh how unique no get face hugged no thank you

2946
04:34:11,260 --> 04:34:11,660
hello

2947
04:34:14,780 --> 04:34:18,060
anyone home oh i found a key

2948
04:34:18,140 --> 04:34:23,580
hello oh

2949
04:34:25,740 --> 04:34:32,780
i'm gonna play minecraft oh my god is steven alex they're my favorite

2950
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:42,700
analysis of the patterns on the walls cannot ascertain whether their purpose is aesthetic

2951
04:34:42,700 --> 04:34:45,340
or functional whoa further data required

2952
04:34:47,980 --> 04:34:48,380
okay

2953
04:34:51,580 --> 04:34:58,620
all right i don't trust this i'm like i'm gonna keep my knife out you know for safety reasons

2954
04:34:59,900 --> 04:35:00,860
thank you for the cute

2955
04:35:04,780 --> 04:35:10,220
mommy i'm scared i'm the one playing the game i'm scared reflin we're just gonna have to cuddle

2956
04:35:12,780 --> 04:35:15,500
the more we get the more it can translate

2957
04:35:20,860 --> 04:35:25,740
this data set appears to be multi-dimensional schematic by mapping the pattern to three

2958
04:35:25,740 --> 04:35:29,980
dimensional spaces possible together basic understanding of the facilities internal

2959
04:35:29,980 --> 04:35:36,940
workings this facility this facility's unknown construction material is identified as an ultra

2960
04:35:37,500 --> 04:35:48,540
non-reactive oh ultra hard non-reactive metal amalgam synthesized from off-world materials

2961
04:35:48,540 --> 04:35:54,460
there is no indication that it can be damaged or destroyed power the schematic indicates the

2962
04:35:55,260 --> 04:36:02,060
facility was to be powered by a separate self-sustaining power plant located elsewhere on the planet

2963
04:36:02,060 --> 04:36:06,540
the location's not listed but there is evidence the designers intended to harness the planet's

2964
04:36:06,540 --> 04:36:14,460
natural thermal energy down the thermal vent she's going in this ventilation truck the facility

2965
04:36:14,460 --> 04:36:20,060
consists of the upper engineering section where the schematic was found in the control room which

2966
04:36:20,060 --> 04:36:26,060
is accessible via the security sealed elevator shaft or a separate underwater mantle oh

2967
04:36:28,380 --> 04:36:29,580
is it literally the vent

2968
04:36:30,460 --> 04:36:36,460
i got shacked by a big waterfall so the control room is in the lower section house is the only

2969
04:36:36,460 --> 04:36:40,460
known way to interface with the facility however the schematic doesn't detail the

2970
04:36:40,460 --> 04:36:45,900
operation procedure or installed screw measures okay that's a lot of work to get i'm kind of easy

2971
04:36:47,340 --> 04:36:54,060
uh 29 minutes and help gets here i'm wondering if you're more like efficient with your time

2972
04:36:54,460 --> 04:37:01,020
your best probability of interfacing with this facility is achieved by accessing the control

2973
04:37:01,020 --> 04:37:13,420
room in the lower section do i jump i mean i'm a gamer so oh i'm getting the good suck

2974
04:37:13,420 --> 04:37:20,140
oh i'm getting gently okay

2975
04:37:23,740 --> 04:37:27,180
getting a bit deep have to have to get a bit deep you know helps

2976
04:37:27,740 --> 04:37:31,260
helps on the way thing force fields control okay

2977
04:37:33,900 --> 04:37:37,260
doesn't appear to be anything of significance in the water

2978
04:37:38,220 --> 04:37:44,860
do a flip i don't think i'm going to be attacked i think i'm alone so

2979
04:37:49,660 --> 04:37:54,220
uh i would like to be outside for when help arrives in case it whoa

2980
04:37:56,460 --> 04:38:01,340
are you being rightful starting biological warfare

2981
04:38:01,500 --> 04:38:03,420
uh

2982
04:38:06,300 --> 04:38:11,100
strong resemblance to human weaponry in form this device must have been designed with a human

2983
04:38:11,100 --> 04:38:17,500
eye user in mind whether they they're sending us to war they're putting us to war whether the

2984
04:38:17,500 --> 04:38:23,900
aliens that built the structure were themselves human either are otherwise employed what there is

2985
04:38:23,900 --> 04:38:31,740
no obviously to remove the rifle from the case oh yeah watch this bonk okay well i'll try

2986
04:38:37,420 --> 04:38:39,660
maybe sometimes violence isn't the answer

2987
04:38:41,580 --> 04:38:49,100
so i can go up the stairs or i can go down a corridor i guess up this oh i'll take the cube thank

2988
04:38:49,100 --> 04:38:52,620
you uh

2989
04:38:55,660 --> 04:39:03,020
and there is an end to this at the top whoo hello hi

2990
04:39:06,620 --> 04:39:14,380
we got the the locksmith key a skeleton key that's what they call not the locksmith key

2991
04:39:15,180 --> 04:39:18,780
whoa alien device what are you

2992
04:39:21,660 --> 04:39:28,060
it doomsday device chotto matty scans indicate this device is uh contains enough potential energy

2993
04:39:28,060 --> 04:39:29,100
to destroy the entire

2994
04:39:32,540 --> 04:39:36,780
total fucking matty um what's going on here hello

2995
04:39:37,340 --> 04:39:41,180
uh

2996
04:39:46,460 --> 04:39:51,820
okay that's popular uh nanny the hell is going on here likes

2997
04:39:54,620 --> 04:39:55,900
i'm gonna put that away again

2998
04:39:55,900 --> 04:40:05,580
oh i'm gonna get jump stairs hello control facility hi

2999
04:40:09,500 --> 04:40:17,340
oh yeah no enter i'm gonna put my wee finger in it oh yeah it's got my wrist

3000
04:40:17,980 --> 04:40:20,780
oh

3001
04:40:28,220 --> 04:40:35,020
the control panel is broadcasting a message translation reads warning infected individuals

3002
04:40:35,020 --> 04:40:39,100
may not disable the weapon this planet is under quarantine

3003
04:40:47,980 --> 04:40:53,260
are you got you got a bandage that kind of fucking hurt i'm not gonna lie

3004
04:40:53,820 --> 04:40:57,420
what

3005
04:41:01,260 --> 04:41:07,900
disease research facility depths 800 i can't even get to 200 what makes you think i can get to 800

3006
04:41:09,340 --> 04:41:10,700
thermal 1.2

3007
04:41:13,020 --> 04:41:17,580
we're up to the uh quarantine procedures will be automatically enforced with immediate

3008
04:41:17,580 --> 04:41:22,460
this quarantine enforcement platform or target all incoming and outgoing crafters around the spread

3009
04:41:24,060 --> 04:41:32,700
that's why no one no one can get off the plant oh no can we radio in sunbeam

3010
04:41:34,780 --> 04:41:37,340
oh my god they're gonna get nuked out of the fucking sky

3011
04:41:39,340 --> 04:41:47,100
can we call them or something you know a little fm radio moment hey don't land bad idea

3012
04:41:47,660 --> 04:41:54,220
bad idea can we tell them not to land i'd rather they survived

3013
04:41:56,460 --> 04:42:02,620
okay so there's ale something made a noise there's ale

3014
04:42:04,940 --> 04:42:10,780
oh i've already taken it thank you though uh so there's alien tech that's preventing the spread

3015
04:42:11,740 --> 04:42:16,220
of a disease understandable have a semi nice day

3016
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:23,180
the alien arch oh my god we're going to the nether

3017
04:42:24,300 --> 04:42:30,540
i assure you the only nether i fuck with is my region so i'm a bit scared to progress alien

3018
04:42:30,540 --> 04:42:37,180
art this structure intends purposes theories of function ceremonial industrial advanced

3019
04:42:37,180 --> 04:42:38,940
teleportation network okay

3020
04:42:47,900 --> 04:42:49,900
are you anything is this just a dead end

3021
04:42:52,380 --> 04:42:57,340
okay i assume this is just a dead end and i'm not doing it i'm here i'll heal it for you

3022
04:42:59,740 --> 04:43:06,060
okay are we about to watch some fireworks because we can't radio in that they should

3023
04:43:06,060 --> 04:43:07,340
definitely not come

3024
04:43:10,300 --> 04:43:13,180
um self scan go on then

3025
04:43:14,060 --> 04:43:21,340
self scan complete bacterial infection in your system is progressing detecting skin irritation

3026
04:43:21,340 --> 04:43:26,700
and immune system response yeah further data required to identify bacterial strain

3027
04:43:29,020 --> 04:43:30,620
further scan oh wait i didn't hear that

3028
04:43:30,620 --> 04:43:32,620
okay

3029
04:43:46,060 --> 04:43:49,420
is this how i get out i need to go this way or kind of go up the lift

3030
04:43:50,780 --> 04:43:53,260
hey can you guys use that alien tech and give me a lift

3031
04:43:54,860 --> 04:43:57,020
oh i guess though right so then what's out here

3032
04:43:57,340 --> 04:44:02,620
here you can go both ways i didn't know you swung like that

3033
04:44:02,620 --> 04:44:06,220
oh

3034
04:44:20,860 --> 04:44:28,620
oh i'm gonna i'm gonna use the front door if that's okay with you i'm just gonna use the front door

3035
04:44:29,420 --> 04:44:32,780
yeah i think i'd rather just use the front door

3036
04:44:35,900 --> 04:44:46,140
yeah okay let's just that was not fun i honestly thought it was gonna let me explore a little bit

3037
04:44:48,780 --> 04:44:55,020
okay well unfortunately i don't think uh sunbeams gonna be

3038
04:44:55,580 --> 04:44:59,900
that's gonna be there's gonna be a beam there's gonna be a lot of sun

3039
04:45:03,020 --> 04:45:10,300
130 bpm yeah i i know it's hard to believe but i got a little bit surprised there i honestly

3040
04:45:10,300 --> 04:45:14,540
genuinely if we're talking like developer wise i thought they were gonna let you explore that

3041
04:45:14,540 --> 04:45:18,940
little watery bit out there like i saw that structure and then all here's

3042
04:45:19,420 --> 04:45:24,220
bomb in my ear and i'm like can you know

3043
04:45:28,780 --> 04:45:32,540
must begin to the front he came out of nowhere that was unlucky

3044
04:45:33,900 --> 04:45:36,300
mommy doesn't like us the end of the back door

3045
04:45:38,300 --> 04:45:39,180
terrifying

3046
04:45:41,500 --> 04:45:45,660
god this game is fascinating though i'm gonna be honest i thought i was gonna hate it i'm like

3047
04:45:45,660 --> 04:45:51,020
intrigued now i'm loving this so i'm guessing that's where i was and i could have swam but

3048
04:45:51,020 --> 04:45:59,820
you know me oh no me tablet me lucky charms oh i'm to scan it sorry i like that prompts me to

3049
04:45:59,820 --> 04:46:05,100
scan it thank you it helps no what does it just give me pieces of it just give me pieces of

3050
04:46:05,100 --> 04:46:08,140
oh titanine iron cubes hi million

3051
04:46:13,340 --> 04:46:19,020

i can't i have to i still have over 24 hours

3179
05:01:07,900 --> 05:01:13,500

3180
05:01:17,260 --> 05:01:22,460

i've not seen the new one

3186
05:01:50,380 --> 05:01:56,380
right okay is this the view of the totally legitimate sunbeam that's totally not going to

3187
05:01:56,380 --> 05:02:06,140
explode because um yeah i would read some marshy mouths whilst we uh wait for the rescue party

3188
05:02:07,580 --> 05:02:12,700
that's right the alien facility spoiled it i read with my own eyeballs if i didn't read that

3189
05:02:12,700 --> 05:02:15,260
i wouldn't have known and i would have been hopeful that i was getting through

3190
05:02:17,820 --> 05:02:25,100
yes the view i wonder did you guys read that when you were exploring the facility

3191
05:02:25,900 --> 05:02:30,540
tron a real you have to watch the 80s one before you watch the 2010 one

3192
05:02:32,460 --> 05:02:37,340
closer so you can see the building wait like actually on the spot isn't that where the

3266
05:11:28,860 --> 05:11:29,820

3269
05:11:53,260 --> 05:11:55,260
oh i guess we're going to the

3270
05:11:59,820 --> 05:12:00,540
what's it mean

3271
05:12:02,700 --> 05:12:05,980
what does it mean i seem to i need to activate like a portal or something

3272
05:12:09,900 --> 05:12:10,380
yeah

3273
05:12:17,580 --> 05:12:23,820
Reaper roar hardly even more i can see something there it looks like a stinger

3274
05:12:24,220 --> 05:12:33,820
am i staring at a reaper is that him did you see that too or the pixels too much

3275
05:12:41,260 --> 05:12:45,980
i seem i can just go up and then we pull it go closer

3276
05:12:46,780 --> 05:12:59,260
oh here he is yeah that's him that's him all right

3277
05:13:01,180 --> 05:13:05,820
i don't know what you're supposed to do against him well i'm gonna hit my head on this block

3278
05:13:08,780 --> 05:13:12,220
do not say first what is there something past him

3279
05:13:12,540 --> 05:13:14,540
um

3280
05:13:20,620 --> 05:13:22,700
i have purple tablets so

3281
05:13:25,180 --> 05:13:31,820
how did i go did i take this back to the little thing for upgrades

3282
05:13:35,660 --> 05:13:38,940
i'm framing speed you'll eventually get better vehicles can deal with them

3283
05:13:42,220 --> 05:13:45,180
so go back to spawn and upgrade this

3284
05:13:49,980 --> 05:13:59,020
use the alien facility list as your gate

3285
05:14:05,260 --> 05:14:07,020
um

3286
05:14:12,780 --> 05:14:22,780
so upgrade you have to find the docking room you don't want to dock with me at the first

3287
05:14:22,780 --> 05:14:29,740
also your radio and aura house and stuff rest well sleepy head rest low to me to go to sleep

3288
05:14:30,300 --> 05:14:34,220
please don't worry i'm stumbling through this game right now i really am enjoying it but

3289
05:14:35,100 --> 05:14:39,500
docking bad isn't that when you put two tentacles together wait what's docking

3290
05:14:40,620 --> 05:14:44,700
what is docking i thought you made like two tentacles

3291
05:14:49,980 --> 05:14:58,940
oh the act of docking is when one reefling stretches the boar skin of his tentacle around

3292
05:14:59,020 --> 05:15:04,940
another tentacle i mean you have two tentacles technically you can do self docking so

3293
05:15:10,460 --> 05:15:13,820
yes with one being put inside to give a little kiss

3294
05:15:17,580 --> 05:15:26,700
uh right what was the alien's clue alien artifact alien deal no not another one the terminal deal

3295
05:15:28,940 --> 05:15:34,620
no it had like addresses and stuff on it it told me like it was a billion miles away or something

3296
05:15:35,500 --> 05:15:37,900
no artifact no what

3297
05:15:48,380 --> 05:15:51,020
this is the worst thing i've ever overheard so

3298
05:15:51,020 --> 05:15:58,220
or advanced theories alien egg evidence suggests that substantial number if not all of the local

3299
05:15:58,220 --> 05:16:05,100
species produced through eggling eggs can be found different species like likely flavor biomes as the

3300
05:16:05,100 --> 05:16:11,500
nesting ground likely awaiting ideal conditions in which to hatch for the delivery of some

3301
05:16:11,500 --> 05:16:18,620
vital enzyme which will take place also it's impossible to calculate the species of the egg

3302
05:16:18,620 --> 05:16:24,380
from the here however maybe also to stimulate a hatching are you squiddin me right now are we

3303
05:16:24,380 --> 05:16:30,540
raising a fucking army watching first time playthroughs of somatic is always fun for me

3304
05:16:30,540 --> 05:16:37,420
don't be afraid to take your time with it thank you uh crazy jesse yeah

3305
05:16:39,740 --> 05:16:46,460
uh i'm just stumbling a bit here i'm a bit confuzzled on what to do i need to find a dock

3306
05:16:48,620 --> 05:16:56,060
right i know where that dog is i think what i need to do is i need to go back and upgrade my shiz first

3307
05:16:58,540 --> 05:17:05,740
and i'm gonna save and i want to go like around this way a bit like against the area could

3308
05:17:07,020 --> 05:17:13,660
and you're i'm just getting told what to do now and your alien data i can't have a swear

3309
05:17:13,660 --> 05:17:17,900
and ask it without like dancing around it alien data

3310
05:17:21,180 --> 05:17:26,540
clues what quotes and clues

3311
05:17:29,660 --> 05:17:33,660
alien detail quotes and clues

3312
05:17:37,340 --> 05:17:41,660
it hates me

3313
05:17:44,380 --> 05:17:46,860
quotes and clues

3314
05:17:50,300 --> 05:17:57,580
disease research facility 800 so yeah i can't do it and then the distress signal

3315
05:17:58,860 --> 05:18:04,140
okay so let's go back and upgrade our ship because i can't even make it past 200 depths

3316
05:18:04,700 --> 05:18:11,180
i'm not taking it personally i literally cannot get uh past 200 800 yeah 200 and if asking me to

3317
05:18:11,260 --> 05:18:16,700
do 800 so i don't think so all right let's just very carefully whenever are we over

3318
05:18:26,060 --> 05:18:28,780
i'm okay i'm okay

3319

3330
05:20:01,740 --> 05:20:07,660
when they did this one was the last time he saved i'm gonna save an upgrade how happy am i to see

3331
05:20:07,660 --> 05:20:14,140

isn't that all one of those

3334
05:20:29,500 --> 05:20:31,340

3335
05:20:34,140 --> 05:20:40,060
everyone don't get in the way it's just it's not gonna work if you

3336

get out right okay out sorry right at the end is when i crash lovely

3337
05:20:46,940 --> 05:20:55,660

3338
05:20:55,660 --> 05:20:56,620
okay uh

3339
05:21:00,140 --> 05:21:03,020

your next step is finding moon bay fragments you need a moon pool

3344
05:21:31,580 --> 05:21:35,180
need a moon pool a moon pool what is the mean

3345
05:21:40,860 --> 05:21:42,300
the multipurpose room don't get too excited

3346
05:21:42,300 --> 05:21:53,140
Oh, I forgot to do my revende mission. Oh, we can get a double bed in. A moon pool.

3347
05:21:53,140 --> 05:22:04,140
You know Fab, a modification station as well. Need data boxes from lipods, right, you can

3348
05:22:04,140 --> 05:22:10,340
see basically. Make another locker and store that shite. You need to find it! Oh no! Oh,

3349
05:22:10,980 --> 05:22:18,500
sorry, I didn't do that. I need to find it. You never said something so mean to me before.

3350
05:22:20,260 --> 05:22:29,700
Uh, right, I need to make a locker. Hardly even, nor. Oh my god, that's the music scene.

3351
05:22:29,700 --> 05:22:40,900
Uh, right, locker. Um, I don't think we can start to open it. Put all the really important

3352
05:22:40,900 --> 05:22:50,820
shit in here. Diamonds, lithium, yeah, a fuck. I'm already out. What's making that noise? Oh,

3353
05:22:50,820 --> 05:22:58,500
that weird thing up there. Um, another locker? Oh, I need titanium. Of course I need titanium,

3354
05:22:58,500 --> 05:23:04,500
because why wouldn't I? Titanium in here? Oh, that would be too advantageous.

3355
05:23:07,300 --> 05:23:13,860
You need to scan other bases. That one? It's 300 meters down. I can't even reach that.

3356
05:23:16,020 --> 05:23:20,260
Was there a radio signal to give me my next lead? Because I think I'm needing it.

3357
05:23:20,580 --> 05:23:24,580
Okay, here we go. Where's my next lead?

3358
05:23:29,380 --> 05:23:30,580
Roger, Roger.

3359
05:23:30,740 --> 05:23:52,660
Um, can we do the 250?

3360
05:23:53,620 --> 05:24:03,140
Roger, Roger. Can we do that 250? Or will that not work? Compute. Creatures egg.

3361
05:24:04,500 --> 05:24:08,420
I didn't really know what to do with the creature's egg. I even need it. Just grabbed it.

3362
05:24:10,100 --> 05:24:14,900
Yeah, 250 is doable. Just park it at 200 and quickly go down. Okay, right. I'm going to keep the

3363
05:24:14,900 --> 05:24:21,380
tablets on me and then the ions can just be chill out here. Doesn't there is something that required

3364
05:24:21,380 --> 05:24:31,620
one of an ion? I can't remember. There was something that asked me for that ion. Oh, a purple tablet?

3365
05:24:32,900 --> 05:24:36,980
Hmm, why not just fucking construct them like that and call it a day?

3366
05:24:39,460 --> 05:24:41,620
There's a hatch in a tank.

3367
05:24:41,620 --> 05:24:51,620
Put the tablets in the semit to save space. The semit can carry stuff.

3368
05:24:54,420 --> 05:24:57,300
Hello, can you carry stuff? Wait, hold on. Let me repair you real quick.

3369
05:24:57,780 --> 05:25:00,340
Uh, this one?

3370
05:25:06,740 --> 05:25:17,460
On the side of it. Enter. Access. Upgrades. Oh. Oh. No, it's not quite what I was on.

3371
05:25:18,020 --> 05:25:29,780
Uh, I miss it. It has storage by default. Oh, you need a storage model? Ah, um, that's okay.

3372
05:25:29,780 --> 05:25:34,260
Uh, I don't actually know how to do that problem though.

3373
05:25:34,260 --> 05:25:39,060
Let's check. I'm not sure how to do it.

3374
05:25:46,980 --> 05:25:52,980
Honestly, not bad though. All things considered, this could have gone horribly wrong.

3375
05:25:56,980 --> 05:26:00,100
She's already got the vehicle mode, but she needs the mental. Okay.

3376
05:26:01,060 --> 05:26:04,340
Right, we're going to follow that leads, which was this one.

3377
05:26:08,580 --> 05:26:16,980
Uh, sus is fuck. Look how far away it is. I'm so going past the reaper to get there. Are you serious?

3378
05:26:17,780 --> 05:26:19,780
Yeah.

3379
05:26:24,020 --> 05:26:28,020
There. Oh, fuck sake. We're so gone past the reaper.

3380
05:26:30,580 --> 05:26:37,620
I'm like, I've saved. That's the main thing. I've saved. That is the main thing.

3381
05:26:40,020 --> 05:26:43,460
That's the main thing I've seen.

3382
05:26:43,940 --> 05:26:52,260
Um, you just need to run them five heads. Lower the audio. Well, there's your warning.

3383
05:26:54,580 --> 05:26:56,340
Okay, my wheels are here, so I'm safe.

3384
05:27:01,140 --> 05:27:03,940
Wheels are here, so it's safe.

3385
05:27:04,260 --> 05:27:06,260
Okay.

3386
05:27:11,700 --> 05:27:20,260
I'm sure this isn't going to go bad at all. Oh, wait, what?

3387
05:27:20,420 --> 05:27:22,420
Fuck.

3388
05:27:31,940 --> 05:27:33,540
Strip out of the roof back real.

3389
05:27:37,060 --> 05:27:41,300
Okay. Okay. Not bad. Not bad. I like these guys. They don't attack.

3390
05:27:43,460 --> 05:27:48,340
The only nice thing left in the ocean, jelly reeds.

3391
05:27:49,300 --> 05:27:52,420
Why am I being tense? I'm not even playing.

3392
05:28:03,220 --> 05:28:05,220
Whoa. Whoa.

3393
05:28:07,860 --> 05:28:14,020
What's what? You're scaring me. You're scaring me.

3394
05:28:18,580 --> 05:28:20,580
What?

3395
05:28:22,340 --> 05:28:26,660
Sorry, the whole sparked and I just saw that and I put two and two together and it was wrong, but

3396
05:28:30,660 --> 05:28:32,660
Yeah, yeah, knock off knock off.

3397
05:28:36,340 --> 05:28:38,420
Okay, am I safe to even go down?

3398
05:28:40,580 --> 05:28:44,660
Is there anything there? Am I okay? Fuck, is that sharp?

3399
05:28:44,740 --> 05:28:48,420
Oh, that's fine.

3400
05:28:52,180 --> 05:28:55,780
That's okay. That's okay.

3401
05:28:58,100 --> 05:28:59,700
That's fine. That's fine.

3402
05:29:01,940 --> 05:29:03,940
Okay.

3403
05:29:10,820 --> 05:29:12,820
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Don't

3404
05:29:15,220 --> 05:29:21,220
relax. Do you think there's a new entry? Right. What was the

3405
05:29:21,940 --> 05:29:28,740
though? Detecting volcanic activity and several unusual electromagnetic signatures in the region.

3406
05:29:28,820 --> 05:29:32,180
Yeah, him. Caution the one diving deeper. Yeah.

3407
05:29:34,580 --> 05:29:36,580
New details.

3408
05:29:37,220 --> 05:29:45,700
I've got to go. Oh, don't worry about having to go. Thank you very much for hanging. That goes for anyone

3409
05:29:45,700 --> 05:29:51,460
who's lurking if you need to fall asleep. You're welcome to sleep. Relax. No flake. It's called deep sleeping.

3410
05:29:54,020 --> 05:29:57,540
Uh, for a survivor, I miss one.

3411
05:29:58,420 --> 05:30:04,180
I'm not really a doctor. I know that's what my ID says, but I never have been. Okay.

3412
05:30:06,820 --> 05:30:12,100
These days need to know about manually resetting bones. When was the last time a top surgeon actually

3413
05:30:12,100 --> 05:30:17,940
cut someone open? Oh, that's what the robots are for. Doctors these days, we diagnoses

3414
05:30:18,260 --> 05:30:22,260
You know what he sounds like? In New York City.

3415
05:30:22,900 --> 05:30:25,380
But what is it that I'm not connected to the main network?

3416
05:30:26,900 --> 05:30:35,140
I'm bleeding. I got glowing green pustules growing on my hands. I run a self scan and it tells me I got skin irritation.

3417
05:30:36,100 --> 05:30:39,940
The only thing I studied in medical school was how to lie convincingly.

3418
05:30:41,060 --> 05:30:43,940
What the hell do I know about how to treat an alien disease?

3419
05:30:44,660 --> 05:30:48,660
What do I know about trying to treat an alien?

3420
05:30:52,660 --> 05:30:59,540
Okay. It's okay. I'm going to press escape. I'm going to press tab. I'm going to hold on spacebar.

3421
05:30:59,540 --> 05:31:05,540
I don't know what's got me. Something has got me. What are you? Fuck off, bitch.

3422
05:31:08,100 --> 05:31:10,020
Decompressed ass, get out of here.

3423
05:31:14,340 --> 05:31:20,420
Okay, it's okay. It was a small boo boo. Okay, we can't make it to the lifeline. We got a new radio

3424
05:31:20,420 --> 05:31:26,260
signal, so we have new help. Oh, that's so bright. It's a bone shark. I'll show you a bone.

3425
05:31:27,060 --> 05:31:32,660
Far, far. Okay, let's get back to the lifeboards.

3426
05:31:37,220 --> 05:31:39,540
Can we mark lifeboard 13 to get my foot up?

3427
05:31:42,980 --> 05:31:46,820
Habitat equipment for our vehicles. That wasn't that thing.

3428
05:31:50,260 --> 05:31:51,620
I'm going to be the other way around.

3429
05:31:52,020 --> 05:31:55,860
My wheels are back. I'm safe.

3430
05:32:02,580 --> 05:32:10,020
You could also check for other items. Where is the wheel shark? Oh, hi, baby. My little reef back.

3431
05:32:10,580 --> 05:32:15,300
Wait a minute, that's not my lifeboard. Wait, no, it is.

3432
05:32:17,460 --> 05:32:21,380
Is it? What? Well, him with a little 360.

3433
05:32:23,700 --> 05:32:28,580
You should speak to them like, oh boy. I just got here. Strone Encounter, something big. Yeah, the reaper.

3434
05:32:30,180 --> 05:32:32,820
If you, here, how about I do your favor?

3435
05:32:35,460 --> 05:32:39,380
I'm going to link a clip that a reefman has sent me of me screaming.

3436
05:32:40,260 --> 05:32:41,700
You will be warned that I'm screaming.

3437
05:32:43,780 --> 05:32:47,780
But here, if you miss, if you miss the scary part.

3438
05:32:50,340 --> 05:32:51,220
There, how about that?

3439
05:32:55,380 --> 05:32:57,220
Is that going to work? Did it work?

3440
05:32:57,220 --> 05:33:01,540
Yeah, I don't think I can. It doesn't look textured to click.

3441
05:33:04,740 --> 05:33:08,500
I like how I managed to squeeze out a bliet. I'm really impressed with myself.

3442
05:33:09,460 --> 05:33:13,060
Is that already clicked? Oh, no, I'm going to have to send it to an editor and stuff.

3443
05:33:15,060 --> 05:33:21,140
Oh, bliet. But yeah, that's the part you're wanting. Let me pin it.

3444
05:33:22,900 --> 05:33:24,020
Pin message, there you go.

3445
05:33:27,780 --> 05:33:29,620
Mommy screams are a part of the experience.

3446
05:33:31,780 --> 05:33:36,420
Hello, reef back. We love you. You're so cute.

3447
05:33:38,500 --> 05:33:40,820
I might need to deal with this power cell thingy, my bobber.

3448
05:33:44,020 --> 05:33:47,540
Wait, why are we going back already for? Oh, to pick up the next radio broadcast,

3449
05:33:47,540 --> 05:33:51,780
to get the next one that'll teach me how to get the parts to the moon thingy, my bobber.

3450
05:33:53,860 --> 05:33:55,700
Leave one for the tentacle, I think.

3451
05:34:01,940 --> 05:34:04,260
Oh, I don't know if anyone clipped the other one of Screamda.

3452
05:34:04,820 --> 05:34:06,820
Is that the alien facility of Screamda?

3453
05:34:09,380 --> 05:34:17,300
Hmm. Reef backs are powered up reeflings. We have three tentacles instead of two.

3454
05:34:20,100 --> 05:34:26,260
Yeah, these guys don't seem that scary anymore. Like, not even a little bit.

3455
05:34:26,980 --> 05:34:34,340
Let's not bump it this time. I'll just heal it up.

3456
05:34:36,660 --> 05:34:41,540
And then I've already thrown, read the radio and then it'll tell me where to go next.

3457
05:34:43,460 --> 05:34:46,260
Sorry. Oh, I knew just since, pardon me.

3458
05:34:57,140 --> 05:35:05,060
Hunting. Analyzing. Sharing subject locations with other agents.

3459
05:35:08,820 --> 05:35:09,540
Can you not?

3460
05:35:13,860 --> 05:35:14,660
Can you not?

3461
05:35:14,820 --> 05:35:26,260
Can you not? Does he come after me now?

3462
05:35:28,900 --> 05:35:31,860
There's definitely some banshee blood in the sand here.

3463
05:35:34,180 --> 05:35:40,260
Did he come after me now? Yes, no, maybe. Yes.

3464
05:35:41,220 --> 05:35:46,420
A tamer begins? Sort of? A tamer for what? They're gonna blow up my little base?

3465
05:35:49,700 --> 05:35:52,180
Can I like, snipe them from here with my little laser beam?

3466
05:35:55,540 --> 05:36:00,500
I don't know, probably. I don't know where to go from here.

3467
05:36:00,500 --> 05:36:03,940
You guys said I need to discover a moon base. Is it northeast, southwest?

3468
05:36:04,020 --> 05:36:10,260
When they see you, they'll be super hostile. Oh, I already got shanked in the alien facility,

3469
05:36:10,260 --> 05:36:17,460
didn't you? Worry about me. Can you repeat the question? Pod 13 is Moonpool? How? It's 300 meters.

3470
05:36:19,860 --> 05:36:23,780
I have to risk it for a biscuit? Why the fuck do I have this egg in here still?

3471
05:36:24,420 --> 05:36:25,940
Take it rid of this egg, please.

3472
05:36:27,780 --> 05:36:33,700
I might like to restart the fucking biome of the country and the country of the thing

3473
05:36:33,700 --> 05:36:38,980
and it's like, you have to do. All right, where's Mihima? All right, come on, let's go.

3474
05:36:40,420 --> 05:36:44,820
Come on, you've got some diamonds. Welcome aboard. All right, I'm off.

3475
05:36:50,180 --> 05:36:52,020
Left hold is 13.

3476
05:36:54,900 --> 05:36:57,060
Left hold is, oh, 13.

3477
05:36:57,060 --> 05:37:05,060
Hmm. I don't think I have the coordinates for 13. Only 19.

3478
05:37:07,460 --> 05:37:11,940
Mommy's having a headache. You can build a modification station.

3479
05:37:14,260 --> 05:37:16,980
I suppose I'll see what that does.

3480
05:37:19,380 --> 05:37:23,140
I've missed so much. No, you've not. It took me four hours to get here, I assure you.

3481
05:37:24,020 --> 05:37:28,820
Welcome aboard. All right, what do I need to, what do I need to build the modification station?

3482
05:37:33,780 --> 05:37:46,500
Lead diamond titanium computer chip. Lead titanium computer chip. And I forgot another thing.

3483
05:37:46,820 --> 05:37:54,500
Lead titanium computer chip.

3484
05:38:02,660 --> 05:38:12,740
Lead titanium. That's our site. That's our computer chip. What's our computer?

3485
05:38:12,740 --> 05:38:26,900
Gold and copper wire. Gold? I assume gold is what meets the copper wire, right?

3486
05:38:30,500 --> 05:38:32,260
Oh, sorry, copper wire.

3487
05:38:35,860 --> 05:38:37,220
Oh, copper ore. Oh.

3488
05:38:37,460 --> 05:38:45,540
Gold meets copper wire. Look, I wasn't thinking when I said that I would load.

3489
05:38:46,340 --> 05:38:52,820
Right, I need titanium, which is here. I might, unironically, have to go get some metal because

3490
05:38:52,820 --> 05:38:56,180
I've not been going for any.

3491
05:38:56,900 --> 05:39:03,060
Keep something coming after me.

3492
05:39:09,940 --> 05:39:14,660
Where's the metal? There was like, it's always when I go and find it, it's like, no.

3493
05:39:15,540 --> 05:39:24,340
What do you mean, no? Right, that's enough titanium. Then I need copper. I can do that.

3494
05:39:25,300 --> 05:39:30,740
Coral shell plate. Is that that thing? I need to stab it. Hold on, let me stab it.

3495
05:39:33,060 --> 05:39:38,340
When in doubt, stab it. Stop, I keep doing that one by accident.

3496
05:39:41,940 --> 05:39:42,900
Shadow scared me.

3497
05:39:43,380 --> 05:39:43,880
Oh.

3498
05:39:49,540 --> 05:39:55,380
Lead. Is that one good? Copper, I need another one.

3499
05:40:00,900 --> 05:40:05,380
It's terrible, I'm like so fucked up from the other one that nothing scares me in here. I'm like,

3500
05:40:05,460 --> 05:40:10,020
yeah, I don't care. Okay, that'll call for a little limb.

3501
05:40:11,540 --> 05:40:15,140
Oh, this must have been where I dropped other ones for me to go. Okay.

3502
05:40:17,700 --> 05:40:20,100
I'm like, mummy, I'm not afraid anymore.

3503
05:40:24,260 --> 05:40:27,620
Oh, no, that happened when she knew that there's bigger fish around.

3504
05:40:28,020 --> 05:40:40,500
Hmm, resilient mummy. I'm here to finish the mission, to escape this planet.

3505
05:40:41,940 --> 05:40:45,940
Okay, well, I can make it from the salvage, so it's not a problem.

3506
05:40:46,660 --> 05:40:50,500
Okay, I need copper water.

3507
05:40:54,420 --> 05:41:04,980
I need table coral, table coral. Table coral. Coral that is for a table. Whoa!

3508
05:41:06,340 --> 05:41:11,060
Obliac! What is that? Is this just a cutscene? I feel like this is just a cutscene.

3509
05:41:11,300 --> 05:41:14,820
Human! Hi.

3510
05:41:18,980 --> 05:41:23,700
Is this plot? Am I getting real plot? Is she coming to help me, friendly?

3511
05:41:26,980 --> 05:41:28,420
Okay, I'm gonna hit a computer chip.

3512
05:41:30,500 --> 05:41:36,660
What does that do? Spell scan power. Nope, I need the crafty one.

3513
05:41:41,060 --> 05:41:44,660
Okay. Boss machines.

3514
05:41:47,220 --> 05:41:54,020
Diamond. We got a diamond. We'll have a diamond. We'll go find a diamond.

3515
05:41:55,300 --> 05:42:02,180
We'll go find a diamond. Please tell me I've got a diamond in here. Nope. Oh, thank god.

3516
05:42:02,900 --> 05:42:03,300
Hmm.

3517
05:42:07,700 --> 05:42:09,300
I think we're great.

3518
05:42:14,660 --> 05:42:18,980
I think you know what, we'll use some more of the pollution station.

3519
05:42:20,260 --> 05:42:26,580
Oh, wow. Really? Thermal? Cooks and sterilizes small organisms for immediate consumption. Oh.

3520
05:42:26,580 --> 05:42:31,620
Oh, we have lithium.

3521
05:42:31,620 --> 05:42:38,660
Um.

3522
05:42:49,300 --> 05:42:57,860
Right. I'll take that. So I need four lithium and I need to make a high tank.

3523
05:42:58,660 --> 05:43:04,260
Fins, silicon, lithium as well. Everyone's lithium. You all love lithium out there?

3524
05:43:06,180 --> 05:43:11,460
Are you lithium? One, two, three, four. Gorgeous. Get in my inventory. Then what?

3525
05:43:13,700 --> 05:43:19,540
High capacity O2 tank. Oh, I'm not sure about that. Mechani.

3526
05:43:22,980 --> 05:43:26,340
I'm gonna make one of these in here because it's gonna annoy me going back and forth

3527
05:43:26,340 --> 05:43:29,940
constantly into the old one. Um, where is it?

3528
05:43:35,940 --> 05:43:41,060
There we go. Alright, I'm gonna go back in this pod and we're gonna make this like the main base

3529
05:43:41,060 --> 05:43:45,780
thing with all my supplies and stuff because I don't want to be constantly going back and forth

3530
05:43:45,780 --> 05:43:50,740
to that other one. Go titanium and that's like super common anyway.

3531
05:43:50,980 --> 05:43:59,540
Mommy, you have it? Oh, it's on my back. This? Oh, take it off.

3532
05:44:01,460 --> 05:44:08,900
More like this. Oh, that's so smart. Okay, let's go. Upgrade people. Upgrade.

3533
05:44:09,460 --> 05:44:14,260
What's my new oxygen? It's 225.

3534
05:44:15,060 --> 05:44:20,340
Okay, and then fence. I need two silicon rubber and one lithium.

3535
05:44:22,100 --> 05:44:27,140
Okay, two silicon. I think that's the seed.

3536
05:44:31,140 --> 05:44:38,340
Did you get nom'd yet? No, but the fish are after me. Right, silicon. I need two creepers.

3537
05:44:38,580 --> 05:44:46,740
Stop! That's really bad brain oil. But can I get more walkers though? Yeah, I would like a

3538
05:44:46,740 --> 05:44:52,340
shit ton more walkers. I'm not even kidding. I want like this place to be pent out.

3539
05:44:54,980 --> 05:44:58,500
So then I don't have to like keep fucking going back and forth everywhere.

3540
05:44:58,980 --> 05:45:02,180
Name the loafers?

3541
05:45:07,860 --> 05:45:08,660
I named them.

3542
05:45:23,780 --> 05:45:24,580
Like name them?

3543
05:45:29,140 --> 05:45:36,740
I'll put you in your locker. So this is you. This is an inkling that allows you and then

3544
05:45:36,740 --> 05:45:44,340
Denialing going here. What if you named one? I barely know it. Locker? I barely know it.

3545
05:45:46,660 --> 05:45:55,780
It's evil. Pick a locker. Any locker is here. Naming them is easier. Oh, name them as in like

3546
05:45:55,860 --> 05:46:05,940
metals are in here. Oh, I genuinely thought you meant like... Oh, that made... Okay.

3547
05:46:09,700 --> 05:46:16,340
Upon reflection, what you said now makes a lot more sense. I was like, sure, I can name them.

3548
05:46:16,340 --> 05:46:24,260
Like, I'll call them like Samantha or, you know, Daenerys or something like that. LaMau, Zola.

3549
05:46:26,820 --> 05:46:27,540
Oh, we got four.

3550
05:46:34,340 --> 05:46:35,700
I'm just going to take all this shit.

3551
05:46:36,420 --> 05:46:41,060
How deep is that?

3552
05:46:47,460 --> 05:46:53,300
Dammit. Damage secondary systems? Oops, did I never repair this?

3553
05:46:53,300 --> 05:47:06,340
Wait, did I never... Or did it just get like old over time? Am I dumb?

3554
05:47:07,780 --> 05:47:12,020
Have I been running this? No, no, no, no, no. I did that. I did that the first time.

3555
05:47:12,020 --> 05:47:13,860
Okay, I'm going to put all this shit in the other one.

3556
05:47:15,540 --> 05:47:21,220
And then I can't complete it. It just kind of takes a little bit of damage over time. Okay,

3557
05:47:21,300 --> 05:47:26,180
that's fine, friend. We are doing... What is that one?

3558
05:47:28,580 --> 05:47:37,140
Shove all this shit out. I'm not taking the purple tablets with me? Or am I taking the purple

3559
05:47:37,140 --> 05:47:48,420
tablets with me? Just take one tablet.

3560
05:47:51,940 --> 05:47:56,980
And then I need... How do I make that silicon thing again? I already forgot.

3561
05:47:58,500 --> 05:48:00,020
Forgive me, I'm small brain.

3562
05:48:00,260 --> 05:48:06,660
I just need two yellow things. Yeah, I can do that.

3563
05:48:08,180 --> 05:48:09,780
And then I've got the next upgrade.

3564
05:48:17,460 --> 05:48:20,900
I guess one tablet means you have access to everything else afterwards as well.

3565
05:48:20,900 --> 05:48:34,580
Oh, wait, was it stabbing it? I don't know. I can't remember. Let's go.

3566
05:48:37,620 --> 05:48:41,220
Trust me, you want to explore or you're a barrier-ish.

3567
05:48:41,940 --> 05:48:43,940
Are you a sea jelly? I'm a calm thing.

3568
05:48:44,100 --> 05:48:46,100
Mm-hmm.

3569
05:48:50,180 --> 05:48:52,900
Yes. Sorry, my brain's starting to lag.

3570
05:48:56,420 --> 05:48:57,300
Silicon rubber.

3571
05:49:00,340 --> 05:49:02,100
Silicon rubber. Right.

3572
05:49:05,060 --> 05:49:06,580
And then take off my fin.

3573
05:49:07,140 --> 05:49:17,940
And then come here and ultra-fin. Fuck yeah. Ultra cool fin. So now I'm moving faster.

3574
05:49:19,220 --> 05:49:25,460
Cyclops? Well, I don't know that. I don't even have the first module kit, whatever that is.

3575
05:49:25,780 --> 05:49:34,740
What? An ammo glass? Magnetate?

3576
05:49:38,340 --> 05:49:41,860
Uh, I in fact, I will upgrade the knife while we're at it, so why not?

3577
05:49:44,420 --> 05:49:45,700
So now what do you look like?

3578
05:49:49,220 --> 05:49:54,500
Oh, it's like steaming on the war? Interesting creative choices.

3579
05:49:56,420 --> 05:49:57,780
I guess I'll just shove this in here.

3580
05:50:00,420 --> 05:50:02,660
Not my problem, if it's not a membrane 2.

3581
05:50:03,620 --> 05:50:09,700
All right, leave all this because it's fine. I've got one purple and everything else is fine to receive.

3582
05:50:10,500 --> 05:50:16,340
And then we're going to go to the 300 meter life pod because that's our only clue.

3583
05:50:16,340 --> 05:50:20,580
It's steaming quickly.

3584
05:50:23,780 --> 05:50:29,460
Right. Where are we heading off to? Is there a reason I turned around?

3585
05:50:30,580 --> 05:50:34,660
Oh, I couldn't make it, I don't think. Because I need the moon.

3586
05:50:36,180 --> 05:50:41,380
Mummy is going to put stuff inside of us. It's absolutely steaming, it's wasted.

3587
05:50:42,180 --> 05:50:50,100
Uh, what do, um, you've got more air now. I think we'll manage.

3588
05:50:52,020 --> 05:50:57,460
Wait, why is that? I don't want to make you any more. How do I get rid of this?

3589
05:51:00,260 --> 05:51:01,700
Is it just going to be there?

3590
05:51:02,420 --> 05:51:11,460
More air, let's see. Then just go back into that fucking table.

3591
05:51:13,140 --> 05:51:14,980
Okay, with more air, I think we'll be okay.

3592
05:51:20,900 --> 05:51:23,060
All right, right. So, tell me, thank you.

3593
05:51:24,580 --> 05:51:28,340
Yes, I went back just, I'm sure there was an easier way to do it. I'm sure there was an easier way,

3594
05:51:28,340 --> 05:51:34,980
but small brain. Tee hee. Tee hee, thank you for understanding. Tee hee. I was born this way, Tee.

3595
05:51:36,740 --> 05:51:43,700
Aurora, can I make it to Aurora? More air plus rebreather? What's that?

3596
05:51:47,060 --> 05:51:51,700
Wait, I've got more? Wait, was there something I could upgrade there?

3597
05:51:58,340 --> 05:52:00,420
You run past the reaper you can get on the ship.

3598
05:52:02,100 --> 05:52:05,460
Yeah, I trust you. Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

3599
05:52:06,180 --> 05:52:09,460
Where's Jack in? Right, we've got the high capacity tank.

3600
05:52:12,980 --> 05:52:17,060
Pronsuit depth module? Fucking science.

3601
05:52:17,460 --> 05:52:28,100
As the only streamer VTuber who made the connection of cave cell for making caves,

3602
05:52:28,100 --> 05:52:33,380
deny your small brain. Save first, right? We're going to save here and we're going to go to the

3603
05:52:34,180 --> 05:52:37,300
Aurora. Right, where's Aurora?

3604
05:52:42,580 --> 05:52:44,340
It's gently surfaced, where is she?

3605
05:52:46,580 --> 05:52:53,300
Now, before I be lying at past the reaper, how do I get on board? Is it the first engine?

3606
05:52:53,300 --> 05:52:57,620
Like, you know how one, two, three, four and four is like broken in the water? Is that how I get in?

3607
05:52:57,700 --> 05:53:07,140
Okay, the left side, front of the ship is how I get inside. Okay, say no more.

3608
05:53:09,220 --> 05:53:12,500
It's blown open at the front. Okay, not the only thing that's getting blown tonight with

3609
05:53:12,500 --> 05:53:17,700
how much you're carrying me through this game. Thank you, thank you.

3610
05:53:18,420 --> 05:53:21,380
Okay, let's make it, let's make it.

3611
05:53:23,380 --> 05:53:29,060
Now, there is a reaper kind of like, as if I'm running over fish when I'm skimming the water.

3612
05:53:29,060 --> 05:53:29,540
Go down.

3613
05:53:33,460 --> 05:53:38,020
She's not saving. I did. There, boom, save. Proof.

3614
05:53:42,580 --> 05:53:44,260
Right, front of the ship, front of the ship.

3615
05:53:45,220 --> 05:53:48,900
Part of the ship, part of the crew. I'm not going to go too deep because that's when the thingy

3616
05:53:48,900 --> 05:53:49,220
starts.

3617
05:53:55,780 --> 05:53:57,940
Find the nearest hole in the ship. Got ya.

3618
05:54:01,620 --> 05:54:03,700
Okay, so my wheels are here. That's fine.

3619
05:54:06,020 --> 05:54:10,500
Maybe a nice song could relax. Go down. No, I'm staying up on top.

3620
05:54:15,220 --> 05:54:17,860
I still seem to be in the whale's range, which is safe.

3621
05:54:20,420 --> 05:54:23,060
Okay, those are the resharky guys on the water.

3622
05:54:25,140 --> 05:54:30,740
Males scraps. Not much surviving around these parts.

3623
05:54:34,660 --> 05:54:37,300
And there's a depth there. Ooh.

3624
05:54:40,900 --> 05:54:41,700
Okay, okay.

3625
05:54:44,420 --> 05:54:47,460
Oh, so if I was in a dum-dum, I probably could have, like,

3626
05:54:47,460 --> 05:54:48,580
forgotten to the ship before it.

3627
05:54:48,580 --> 05:54:54,500
Left by the wheels. In this region, our sparse. The Aurora's radioactive fallout

3628
05:54:54,500 --> 05:55:00,900
will have devastating effects on the alien ecosystem if not contained within the next 24 hours.

3629
05:55:00,900 --> 05:55:17,780
Is this room supposed to go?

3630
05:55:20,020 --> 05:55:25,140
Like, am I supposed to get out now? No. I don't see the entrance.

3631
05:55:30,900 --> 05:55:33,940
Oh, that sounded fucking like it to me.

3632
05:55:37,460 --> 05:55:41,620
Len. Oh, come on. Give a break.

3633
05:55:44,420 --> 05:55:46,900
Give a break. No, I'm coming.

3634
05:55:49,460 --> 05:55:56,180
Yeah, that better hurt. I hope it burns. Had enough of you affecting me.

3635
05:55:56,740 --> 05:56:06,020
Enough. I hear you.

3636
05:56:08,820 --> 05:56:10,180
Right, where's the other guy? There's one more.

3637
05:56:18,500 --> 05:56:20,420
Well, there was another guy around here, but

3638
05:56:20,420 --> 05:56:28,740
I can't get over here. I've got a knife with your name on it. Come here.

3639
05:56:30,500 --> 05:56:43,780
There you go. Let's scan you. Scan? Scan? Scan? Okay, this is not where I'm supposed to go.

3640
05:56:43,860 --> 05:56:44,660
Oh.

3641
05:56:49,460 --> 05:56:54,020
And why is the music like this? There is another entrance.

3642
05:56:55,940 --> 05:57:00,820
Can you scan the dead bodies? Have you seen the bodies? I think I already did it on the other end.

3643
05:57:00,820 --> 05:57:04,900
Yeah. Of course, I get a radio signal now. You just can't do this.

3644
05:57:07,060 --> 05:57:11,220
There should be a path that goes a little higher, like back here or go around.

3645
05:57:14,420 --> 05:57:21,620
A little flip-flops. No, this is the dead end. Okay. Upstairs.

3646
05:57:34,580 --> 05:57:36,180
Where's my bohina?

3647
05:57:44,260 --> 05:57:49,700
You have to put out the fires with the extinguisher. Are we real?

3648
05:57:56,580 --> 05:57:59,140
That's too much of a fire to go through.

3649
05:58:02,420 --> 05:58:06,660
All right, that's definitely not it. So you're having me on this, maybe?

3650
05:58:09,940 --> 05:58:10,580
This maybe.

3651
05:58:14,740 --> 05:58:19,540
Warning. Ship's Structural Integrity is low.

3652
05:58:19,540 --> 05:58:23,380
Yeah, I'm going to ask the question. Equipment and laser cutters may be required.

3653
05:58:23,940 --> 05:58:26,660
Exploration is conducted at your own risk.

3654
05:58:28,580 --> 05:58:35,220
There's fucking so many. I'm going to get a rest. And how don't they burn in the fire?

3655
05:58:36,660 --> 05:58:41,060
I'm getting, they're jumping me. I'm getting gang violence. Jesus.

3656
05:58:44,340 --> 05:58:48,340
I'm T9. I made a kit. Thanks for telling me this.

3657
05:58:51,940 --> 05:58:55,780
Okay, game. Thank you for not registering the distance. No, I appreciate it.

3658
05:59:00,100 --> 05:59:02,660
Right, at least they're dying in two shots now instead of one.

3659
05:59:05,940 --> 05:59:07,940
Nah, I'm not having you jump me. Kiss off.

3660
05:59:08,740 --> 05:59:13,780
We'll be running out with one HP and then this will be the, oh, that one's infected.

3661
05:59:13,780 --> 05:59:16,820
He's super aggressive because we're kind of faked to be in. He's super aggressive.

3662
05:59:22,180 --> 05:59:26,900
Nah, I'm not having you jump me. Look at how many there is. Can you calm down, please?

3663
05:59:27,700 --> 05:59:33,940
Caution. Scans show the digestive trance of nearby life forms contain human tissues.

3664
05:59:35,140 --> 05:59:36,980
This time, I'm not surprised about that.

3665
05:59:42,660 --> 05:59:43,380
Oh my God.

3666
05:59:51,460 --> 05:59:55,460
Yeah, that's right. I showed you. I kicked him off the freaking, I kicked him off the ship.

3667
05:59:57,220 --> 06:00:01,380
Is this, is this anything?

3668
06:00:05,060 --> 06:00:05,460
What?

3669
06:00:10,900 --> 06:00:13,860
I did nothing. That can't be it.

3670
06:00:19,460 --> 06:00:20,340
Not that fire.

3671
06:00:27,060 --> 06:00:33,860
Oh, like this.

3672
06:00:40,580 --> 06:00:44,500
I wonder how painful it is to watch when you know where to, I'm supposed to be going right now.

3673
06:00:47,140 --> 06:00:53,380
That did nothing. Literally put the fire out. Oh, did it? Wait, I can go back there. Am I supposed

3674
06:00:53,380 --> 06:00:56,340
to go up? Look for the bridge at the ledge.

3675
06:01:00,580 --> 06:01:00,900
This?

3676
06:01:04,260 --> 06:01:05,940
Look for the bridge at the ledge.

3677
06:01:10,180 --> 06:01:12,820
Oh, there's a lake here, which makes me think it's here.

3678
06:01:14,580 --> 06:01:15,540
Look, flood lake.

3679
06:01:15,540 --> 06:01:39,780
Um, this? Yeah, no, it looks like this. Is that slanted or is it straight?

3680
06:01:40,500 --> 06:01:46,500
Okay, I can't seem to go that way, so it's not.

3681
06:01:50,980 --> 06:01:53,700
Yes, to the left of this, down here.

3682
06:01:59,460 --> 06:02:01,780
Your mummy isn't very smart.

3683
06:02:02,020 --> 06:02:07,220
It's not bad. It doesn't look like it's not.

3684
06:02:12,260 --> 06:02:16,500
You're almost there. You're cheering me on, but you're cheering on the wrong person.

3685
06:02:18,020 --> 06:02:19,220
This is terrible.

3686
06:02:22,660 --> 06:02:29,540
Look at me bastard. Leave me alone. I'm already failing the fucking exploration section. Please,

3687
06:02:29,620 --> 06:02:30,980
don't make me die to you guys.

3688
06:02:34,180 --> 06:02:36,340
There's a bridge at the top. It's not over here.

3689
06:02:40,420 --> 06:02:41,140
Fucking real.

3690
06:02:46,100 --> 06:02:54,180
I'm literally having a stroke. Where you scan the lamp is where the bridge starts.

3691
06:02:54,900 --> 06:02:57,700
Okay, so I'm going back to the lamp.

3692
06:02:59,540 --> 06:03:02,660
I love me a good lamp. I don't know about you. Love me a good lamp.

3693
06:03:02,660 --> 06:03:04,020
See that? I've had enough of that.

3694
06:03:09,620 --> 06:03:14,420
Okay, I am now back at the lamp. I am going to

3695
06:03:17,940 --> 06:03:23,700
save because the likelihood of me falling off the map right now is humongous.

3696
06:03:30,020 --> 06:03:33,540
I was supposed to just discover that myself, right? That's what I thought.

3697
06:03:35,060 --> 06:03:37,700
No, no. That's what I thought. That's what I thought, man.

3698
06:03:38,900 --> 06:03:40,500
First aid. Yeah, I'm going to need this one.

3699
06:03:40,500 --> 06:03:51,460
I'm going down.

3700
06:03:55,620 --> 06:03:57,460
At least let me see.

3701
06:04:05,300 --> 06:04:05,780
Sorry.

3702
06:04:06,020 --> 06:04:08,020
Integrate new PDA data.

3703
06:04:09,300 --> 06:04:10,580
Would you be any of them?

3704
06:04:12,500 --> 06:04:17,940
And what was that? Compulsion cannon? What's the PDA data?

3705
06:04:21,460 --> 06:04:24,740
I wish they would make it a bit obvious what I just picked up there.

3706
06:04:24,740 --> 06:04:26,740
No.

3707
06:04:27,460 --> 06:04:35,860
I'm looting.

3708
06:04:38,100 --> 06:04:39,940
If I could see, I'm looting.

3709
06:04:44,500 --> 06:04:45,300
Can I go up here?

3710
06:04:47,700 --> 06:04:48,900
It's in the voice notes.

3711
06:04:49,140 --> 06:04:50,500
Is that one available?

3712
06:04:55,140 --> 06:04:57,860
Voice log? It's not. It's just a last thing.

3713
06:05:06,500 --> 06:05:08,100
Aurora engineering drone.

3714
06:05:11,620 --> 06:05:14,420
Aurora engineering drone.

3715
06:05:19,140 --> 06:05:20,420
Voice recognition.

3716
06:05:20,420 --> 06:05:25,140
Engineer Barclay and Chief Technology Officer, you identified.

3717
06:05:25,140 --> 06:05:26,500
Drone, give me a propulsion cannon.

3718
06:05:27,860 --> 06:05:29,620
Repulsion cannon retrieved.

3719
06:05:29,620 --> 06:05:33,060
Hey, Berkeley, install that circuit box with that repulsion cannon

3720
06:05:33,060 --> 06:05:35,140
and you'll punch a hole in the cargo bay.

3721
06:05:35,140 --> 06:05:39,460
Damn it, drone. I said propulsion, not repulsion. Recalibrate sensors.

3722
06:05:40,020 --> 06:05:41,860
Sensors recalibrated.

3723
06:05:41,860 --> 06:05:44,660
Sensors aren't the problem. I tweaked the program.

3724
06:05:44,660 --> 06:05:47,060
It's like you now, as other light being told what to do.

3725
06:05:48,020 --> 06:05:49,860
Drone, I know.

3726
06:05:49,860 --> 06:05:51,380
His name's Albert now.

3727
06:05:52,340 --> 06:05:56,980
Albert, I know it's not your fault, but it would really help me do my job

3728
06:05:56,980 --> 06:06:00,500
if you'd bring me what I asked for. Thanks for your time.

3729
06:06:02,420 --> 06:06:04,180
Propulsion cannon retrieved.

3730
06:06:04,180 --> 06:06:06,420
Thank you. Now go away.

3731
06:06:06,420 --> 06:06:07,140
Endring.

3732
06:06:07,140 --> 06:06:08,660
Hibernation mode.

3733
06:06:08,660 --> 06:06:12,740
Boss, this hobby of yours isn't making my job any easier. Or safer.

3734
06:06:13,540 --> 06:06:16,740
Maybe so, but it's all the integrating new PDA data.

3735
06:06:16,740 --> 06:06:17,860
Next spacewalk in my skivvy.

3736
06:06:21,860 --> 06:06:25,940
Integrating new PDA data. Integrating new PDA data.

3737
06:06:31,060 --> 06:06:32,020
New reprint.

3738
06:06:35,300 --> 06:06:37,940
Did no one have some design thinking about this at all?

3739
06:06:39,060 --> 06:06:39,540
Lake.

3740
06:06:40,340 --> 06:06:43,460
Lake. So is that everything I needed from here?

3741
06:06:46,420 --> 06:06:50,420
Can you scan the data? Like the terminal?

3742
06:06:51,940 --> 06:06:53,220
There's a guy in the chair.

3743
06:06:54,020 --> 06:06:54,660
Oh, it's not.

3744
06:06:59,780 --> 06:07:01,620
You can jump through the boxes below.

3745
06:07:10,020 --> 06:07:11,140
Take the poster.

3746
06:07:17,540 --> 06:07:18,020
What?

3747
06:07:20,660 --> 06:07:22,260
That can pin for my wee lab?

3748
06:07:26,420 --> 06:07:27,860
So I can go down here?

3749
06:07:31,940 --> 06:07:32,900
Is that everything?

3750
06:07:33,300 --> 06:07:34,820
You can decorate your home.

3751
06:07:42,500 --> 06:07:44,020
You can pimp out the double bed.

3752
06:07:44,020 --> 06:07:45,140
Actually, yeah, I should do that.

3753
06:07:45,140 --> 06:07:46,980
We'll make the double bed and then we'll call it there.

3754
06:07:46,980 --> 06:07:48,340
And we'll come back to this.

3755
06:07:49,540 --> 06:07:50,660
We need a mummy.

3756
06:07:50,660 --> 06:07:52,340
Wait, did you say I could go this way?

3757
06:07:52,340 --> 06:07:54,740
Or did I misunderstand your message?

3758
06:07:54,740 --> 06:07:55,540
I don't know.

3759
06:07:55,540 --> 06:07:56,340
I don't know.

3760
06:07:56,340 --> 06:07:56,980
I don't know.

3761
06:07:56,980 --> 06:07:57,540
I don't know.

3762
06:07:57,540 --> 06:07:58,020
I don't know.

3763
06:07:58,020 --> 06:07:58,500
I don't know.

3764
06:07:58,500 --> 06:07:58,980
I don't know.

3765
06:07:58,980 --> 06:07:59,460
I don't know.

3766
06:07:59,460 --> 06:07:59,940
I don't know.

3767
06:07:59,940 --> 06:08:00,420
I don't know.

3768
06:08:00,420 --> 06:08:00,980
I don't know.

3769
06:08:00,980 --> 06:08:01,620
I don't know.

3770
06:08:01,620 --> 06:08:02,180
I don't know.

3771
06:08:02,740 --> 06:08:02,900
What?

3772
06:08:06,340 --> 06:08:06,740
Crouch?

3773
06:08:07,940 --> 06:08:09,140
Is crouch not?

3774
06:08:09,140 --> 06:08:10,820
There's not even a crouch in this game.

3775
06:08:12,180 --> 06:08:15,700
C, control, shift, catwalk, path.

3776
06:08:17,220 --> 06:08:18,900
This game doesn't have crouch in it.

3777
06:08:21,060 --> 06:08:22,180
Surely we are being trolled.

3778
06:08:25,380 --> 06:08:26,900
Oh, they're actually using a crouch.

3779
06:08:27,620 --> 06:08:39,220
I need a proportion cannon.

3780
06:08:40,180 --> 06:08:41,940
Want to go further in here?

3781
06:08:44,340 --> 06:08:44,980
Am I done?

3782
06:08:44,980 --> 06:08:46,180
Yeah, you can jump over it.

3783
06:08:51,460 --> 06:08:52,740
Don't be afraid to jump, bro.

3784
06:08:53,380 --> 06:08:57,780
No, I ran out of stamina right at the end.

3785
06:08:58,820 --> 06:09:00,260
The company took her knees.

3786
06:09:00,260 --> 06:09:01,060
Clearly.

3787
06:09:01,060 --> 06:09:02,820
I'm like fucking bouncing off of this.

3788
06:09:06,180 --> 06:09:07,860
Is this where I'm supposed to go next?

3789
06:09:09,460 --> 06:09:12,020
The compulsion thing moves boxes around?

3790
06:09:13,140 --> 06:09:15,780
Let's re-fan down whoever fucking coded this bit.

3791
06:09:17,140 --> 06:09:18,900
Oh, all right.

3792
06:09:18,900 --> 06:09:19,860
I have one complaint.

3793
06:09:19,860 --> 06:09:20,820
Am I allowed to say it?

3794
06:09:23,700 --> 06:09:25,940
I don't want to say it.

3795
06:09:25,940 --> 06:09:28,020
Although it actually might just be the way I play the game.

3796
06:09:28,020 --> 06:09:28,820
Maybe I shouldn't say it.

3797
06:09:31,380 --> 06:09:33,300
Maybe I shouldn't say it.

3798
06:09:39,380 --> 06:09:42,980
Whenever I feel like I'm finally getting something

3799
06:09:43,700 --> 06:09:44,820
instantly blocked off.

3800
06:09:45,540 --> 06:09:47,700
It's not even like a little bit of exploration at the

3801
06:09:47,780 --> 06:09:48,260
moment.

3802
06:09:49,940 --> 06:09:52,340
If I have that builder, what's going to build the fucking

3803
06:09:55,380 --> 06:09:55,860
tool?

3804
06:10:02,900 --> 06:10:04,340
So I have to go all the way back then?

3805
06:10:07,460 --> 06:10:09,220
I have to go all the way back to make this gun

3806
06:10:11,140 --> 06:10:14,260
just to progress when I'm already at the fucking ship?

3807
06:10:14,900 --> 06:10:18,100
They couldn't have like been nice and

3808
06:10:19,940 --> 06:10:21,860
just been like, oh, here's a station for you.

3809
06:10:21,860 --> 06:10:23,380
So you don't have to go all the way back.

3810
06:10:27,060 --> 06:10:32,100
Your brain will lose brain cells because there's no fast travel.

3811
06:10:33,780 --> 06:10:36,020
Oh, they give you a full fire extinguisher?

3812
06:10:36,020 --> 06:10:36,820
I didn't know that.

3813
06:10:38,260 --> 06:10:39,860
Oh, I was going to say that.

3814
06:10:39,860 --> 06:10:42,420
What happens if you showed up when you fire extinguish one?

3815
06:10:44,500 --> 06:10:45,780
Mommy, you can build anywhere.

3816
06:10:45,780 --> 06:10:46,100
How?

3817
06:10:50,900 --> 06:10:53,140
I've no got the compulsion, Rachel.

3818
06:10:57,540 --> 06:10:59,140
Why is it jiggling?

3819
06:10:59,780 --> 06:11:01,620
It's twerking.

3820
06:11:01,620 --> 06:11:02,260
Relax.

3821
06:11:05,620 --> 06:11:06,180
Oh, yeah.

3822
06:11:06,900 --> 06:11:07,860
Go and fuck off.

3823
06:11:10,900 --> 06:11:11,540
Honestly.

3824
06:11:14,340 --> 06:11:14,820
Oh.

3825
06:11:17,860 --> 06:11:19,860
A compulsion, Rachel.

3826
06:11:21,300 --> 06:11:22,340
Stop.

3827
06:11:22,340 --> 06:11:22,820
Right.

3828
06:11:22,820 --> 06:11:24,260
Repulsion cannon?

3829
06:11:24,260 --> 06:11:26,020
I don't have anything to do with that.

3830
06:11:34,740 --> 06:11:36,020
Inhabitat builder.

3831
06:11:36,660 --> 06:11:37,940
Inhabitat builder.

3832
06:11:39,620 --> 06:11:41,300
Oh my gosh, it's twerking.

3833
06:11:45,220 --> 06:11:48,180
Are you mean the actual tool habitat builder?

3834
06:12:03,220 --> 06:12:04,980
Can you do that thing where you tell me what to do,

3835
06:12:04,980 --> 06:12:06,820
and then do the arrow, and then do the next thing?

3836
06:12:06,820 --> 06:12:10,020
Without the compulsion cannon, you can free the door downstairs?

3837
06:12:10,980 --> 06:12:11,700
Yes.

3838
06:12:12,420 --> 06:12:16,260
My dear refling, but I don't know what or how to access this.

3839
06:12:16,260 --> 06:12:17,940
You can build the crafter.

3840
06:12:24,740 --> 06:12:26,100
So making it twerk.

3841
06:12:26,740 --> 06:12:27,780
Oh my god.

3842
06:12:27,780 --> 06:12:29,300
It wants me to make a...

3843
06:12:29,300 --> 06:12:31,620
Why don't they just provide the fucking item?

3844
06:12:31,620 --> 06:12:33,460
Like, not to be controversial, but...

3845
06:12:35,540 --> 06:12:37,300
Like, I'm sorry to get political, but why?

3846
06:12:38,180 --> 06:12:41,940
Why make me come all this way, literally all this way,

3847
06:12:41,940 --> 06:12:43,460
only to feel like, right, go back.

3848
06:12:43,460 --> 06:12:44,580
You've not got this item.

3849
06:12:45,700 --> 06:12:48,580
You need one more scam before you can even build the cannon anyway.

3850
06:12:49,300 --> 06:12:49,860
Exactly.

3851
06:12:52,820 --> 06:12:54,340
Like, I'm just glad I made it alive.

3852
06:12:54,340 --> 06:12:56,420
Or go back to base real quick.

3853
06:12:56,420 --> 06:12:57,700
Yes, I'll be a jiffy.

3854
06:12:57,700 --> 06:12:59,380
And then by the time I get back to base,

3855
06:12:59,380 --> 06:13:02,980
I actually need to put a battery and a moe-ing thing in my boba.

3856
06:13:03,940 --> 06:13:05,780
Will wiki the other PC?

3857
06:13:08,260 --> 06:13:10,100
I'll tell you what, I'll go back to base.

3858
06:13:10,100 --> 06:13:12,580
I'll make the double bed and hang the poster up.

3859
06:13:12,580 --> 06:13:14,340
We'll have Balmchika Wampwamp time.

3860
06:13:14,900 --> 06:13:17,460
And then we'll come back another day.

3861
06:13:18,580 --> 06:13:20,020
Jump off the ledge.

3862
06:13:20,020 --> 06:13:21,380
Although that would have been faster.

3863
06:13:23,700 --> 06:13:25,140
Yes, you're correct.

3864
06:13:28,980 --> 06:13:29,460
Cause, uh...

3865
06:13:29,620 --> 06:13:30,420
The...

3866
06:13:37,060 --> 06:13:39,620
I lanterns again, but I don't think that's why they did it this way.

3867
06:13:40,740 --> 06:13:41,860
It just feels a bit like,

3868
06:13:43,860 --> 06:13:45,460
could have thrown me a bow and like,

3869
06:13:45,460 --> 06:13:46,100
oh it's worth.

3870
06:13:48,740 --> 06:13:49,460
Like...

3871
06:13:49,460 --> 06:13:50,740
And he's right there.

3872
06:13:50,740 --> 06:13:52,660
He's ready to fucking snake me.

3873
06:13:55,780 --> 06:13:56,900
I'm fucking revert.

3874
06:13:56,900 --> 06:13:57,780
I'm twerking out here.

3875
06:13:59,460 --> 06:14:00,500
Put my eyes on him.

3876
06:14:00,500 --> 06:14:02,500
I'm bobbling up and down that water.

3877
06:14:02,500 --> 06:14:04,020
Right, I don't think he's gonna bother me, mum.

3878
06:14:06,980 --> 06:14:08,180
You put six in there.

3879
06:14:08,180 --> 06:14:10,020
Hours in, I earned a Balmchika Wampwamp.

3880
06:14:10,900 --> 06:14:11,540
What's going on?

3881
06:14:19,780 --> 06:14:21,540
Just the cute guys that don't effect,

3882
06:14:21,540 --> 06:14:22,420
which I like.

3883
06:14:22,420 --> 06:14:23,540
They're my favorite kind.

3884
06:14:29,460 --> 06:14:34,100
I don't remember, I don't remember,

3885
06:14:34,100 --> 06:14:36,340
but that's why I'm so foolish.

3886
06:14:38,340 --> 06:14:39,940
Cause, baby, tonight...

3887
06:14:39,940 --> 06:14:40,260
Oh.

3888
06:14:40,900 --> 06:14:41,860
Is that a new resource?

3889
06:14:41,860 --> 06:14:43,300
100 meters.

3890
06:14:43,300 --> 06:14:45,220
Oxygen efficiency decreased.

3891
06:14:48,580 --> 06:14:49,700
That's not anything.

3892
06:14:52,580 --> 06:14:53,300
Nope.

3893
06:14:53,300 --> 06:14:54,980
I'm seeing the fuck out of this tree.

3894
06:14:54,980 --> 06:14:55,380
Fuck it.

3895
06:14:56,340 --> 06:14:56,740
I'm in.

3896
06:14:59,540 --> 06:15:00,020
Okay.

3897
06:15:01,380 --> 06:15:04,660
Before I beat the game, I forgot one single resources

3898
06:15:04,660 --> 06:15:06,500
that I needed for the ending

3899
06:15:06,500 --> 06:15:08,260
that you could only get at the furthest point.

3900
06:15:08,260 --> 06:15:10,900
And the game had to circle the entire map route.

3901
06:15:12,820 --> 06:15:13,460
I'd believe it.

3902
06:15:15,460 --> 06:15:16,340
I would believe that.

3903
06:15:18,820 --> 06:15:20,900
And I can see myself doing that.

3904
06:15:20,900 --> 06:15:21,620
To be only.

3905
06:15:22,660 --> 06:15:23,300
Scan it.

3906
06:15:23,300 --> 06:15:23,540
Oh.

3907
06:15:24,340 --> 06:15:26,260
That makes a lot more sense now that you've set it.

3908
06:15:30,340 --> 06:15:31,140
500 meters.

3909
06:15:31,140 --> 06:15:31,780
So we're safe.

3910
06:15:31,780 --> 06:15:33,860
There's no Leviathan's or anything like that.

3911
06:15:36,340 --> 06:15:37,860
Let's not worry about that just yet.

3912
06:15:37,860 --> 06:15:40,820
I mean, I feel like I've hardly even got into the game.

3913
06:15:43,460 --> 06:15:46,180
To be on it, not to be career introvertial.

3914
06:15:46,180 --> 06:15:47,700
I feel like I've only just started.

3915
06:15:53,540 --> 06:15:55,220
Oh, those fish didn't get ran over.

3916
06:15:56,180 --> 06:15:56,420
Yeah.

3917
06:15:56,420 --> 06:16:00,580
I'm on 41 battery from a wee thingy mob over as well.

3918
06:16:00,580 --> 06:16:01,300
And I'm a bit late.

3919
06:16:03,700 --> 06:16:07,940
The last blueprint you need for the repulsion is in light port 12.

3920
06:16:09,700 --> 06:16:10,180
Hmm.

3921
06:16:10,180 --> 06:16:13,620
Well, we'll see if I've been given a message from light port 12 or not.

3922
06:16:14,820 --> 06:16:16,260
Would they be so kind?

3923
06:16:16,260 --> 06:16:17,620
This is Ulterra HQ.

3924
06:16:17,620 --> 06:16:19,460
This may be your only communications window.

3925
06:16:20,340 --> 06:16:22,260
We can't send a rescue ship all the way out there.

3926
06:16:22,260 --> 06:16:24,580
So Aurora, you're just going to have to meet us

3927
06:16:25,140 --> 06:16:25,940
halfway.

3928
06:16:25,940 --> 06:16:27,940
We've uploaded blueprints to the ship's computer.

3929
06:16:27,940 --> 06:16:28,580
What is the sandwich run?

3930
06:16:28,580 --> 06:16:28,980
You in?

3931
06:16:29,780 --> 06:16:29,940
Yeah.

3932
06:16:29,940 --> 06:16:30,740
Give me a second.

3933
06:16:30,740 --> 06:16:32,900
Why am I not in the high security terminal

3934
06:16:32,900 --> 06:16:34,020
in the captain's quarters?

3935
06:16:34,020 --> 06:16:35,060
It's still functional.

3936
06:16:35,060 --> 06:16:36,980
Becky's leaving in like five minutes.

3937
06:16:36,980 --> 06:16:37,220
All right.

3938
06:16:37,220 --> 06:16:39,060
Tell Becky I'll just take the regular.

3939
06:16:40,100 --> 06:16:40,260
Yeah.

3940
06:16:40,260 --> 06:16:41,060
She'll know what I mean.

3941
06:16:41,060 --> 06:16:41,780
The code should be.

3942
06:16:41,780 --> 06:16:42,820
She doesn't?

3943
06:16:42,820 --> 06:16:43,860
Just tell her the regular, dude.

3944
06:16:43,860 --> 06:16:44,340
OK.

3945
06:16:44,340 --> 06:16:44,740
The code.

3946
06:16:44,740 --> 06:16:45,380
I'll say regular.

3947
06:16:45,380 --> 06:16:46,580
She's like, what's the regular?

3948
06:16:46,580 --> 06:16:47,540
I'm going to give you the code.

3949
06:16:47,540 --> 06:16:48,500
Give us the code.

3950
06:16:48,500 --> 06:16:50,180
82679.

3951
06:16:50,180 --> 06:16:51,780
The regular is just a ham and cheese.

3952
06:16:51,780 --> 06:16:52,180
OK.

3953
06:16:52,180 --> 06:16:53,380
Would you just say ham and cheese?

3954
06:16:53,380 --> 06:16:54,180
Ham and cheese.

3955
06:16:54,260 --> 06:16:55,620
OK.

3956
06:16:55,620 --> 06:16:55,940
OK.

3957
06:16:55,940 --> 06:16:57,860
No, but he's actually got such a point, though.

3958
06:16:57,860 --> 06:16:58,900
Don't say the regular.

3959
06:16:58,900 --> 06:17:01,140
If someone's doing your favor, don't say the regular.

3960
06:17:01,140 --> 06:17:01,380
No.

3961
06:17:02,100 --> 06:17:02,900
Say what you want.

3962
06:17:03,540 --> 06:17:04,500
Get your whole bussy.

3963
06:17:07,540 --> 06:17:09,140
That guy's winding strong enough.

3964
06:17:09,140 --> 06:17:10,420
Give us the code.

3965
06:17:10,420 --> 06:17:10,820
Right.

3966
06:17:10,820 --> 06:17:11,780
Compulsion can.

3967
06:17:13,460 --> 06:17:14,900
Oh, whole meal states.

3968
06:17:14,900 --> 06:17:15,140
Right.

3969
06:17:15,140 --> 06:17:15,620
That's it.

3970
06:17:16,260 --> 06:17:16,740
That's it.

3971
06:17:16,740 --> 06:17:17,380
We're shagging.

3972
06:17:18,180 --> 06:17:18,900
Get me in here.

3973
06:17:19,540 --> 06:17:19,780
Right.

3974
06:17:19,780 --> 06:17:20,100
How?

3975
06:17:20,100 --> 06:17:20,740
I need to make a bit.

3976
06:17:20,740 --> 06:17:22,340
Welcome to the board, captain.

3977
06:17:22,340 --> 06:17:22,660
Yes.

3978
06:17:22,660 --> 06:17:23,140
Welcome.

3979
06:17:23,140 --> 06:17:23,940
I do feel welcome.

3980
06:17:24,180 --> 06:17:24,660
Thank you.

3981
06:17:24,660 --> 06:17:26,820
Um, where is our bed?

3982
06:17:27,780 --> 06:17:28,820
What I need to make that?

3983
06:17:29,860 --> 06:17:31,540
Titanium and fiber mesh.

3984
06:17:32,180 --> 06:17:33,780
I don't have fiber mesh.

3985
06:17:33,780 --> 06:17:35,140
How do you make fiber mesh?

3986
06:17:37,940 --> 06:17:38,980
Fiber mesh?

3987
06:17:39,620 --> 06:17:41,060
Oh, seaweed.

3988
06:17:41,060 --> 06:17:41,620
Of course.

3989
06:17:41,620 --> 06:17:42,260
I knew that.

3990
06:17:42,260 --> 06:17:43,540
Have I got titanium and seaweed?

3991
06:17:44,900 --> 06:17:45,460
Wrong thing.

3992
06:17:46,340 --> 06:17:46,660
Nope.

3993
06:17:47,860 --> 06:17:48,820
Seaweed.

3994
06:17:48,820 --> 06:17:49,220
Yoy.

3995
06:17:50,820 --> 06:17:51,300
And then

3996
06:17:54,660 --> 06:17:56,500
I really not got titanium in here.

3997
06:17:59,220 --> 06:17:59,700
I'm going to.

3998
06:18:03,780 --> 06:18:05,380
I do not prefer to have titanium.

3999
06:18:05,380 --> 06:18:06,020
And that's okay.

4000
06:18:07,700 --> 06:18:09,540
I am not going to take it personally.

4001
06:18:09,540 --> 06:18:10,980
That I don't have titanium.

4002
06:18:12,260 --> 06:18:14,420
It does not impede my gameplay that much.

4003
06:18:14,420 --> 06:18:15,220
Relax.

4004
06:18:15,220 --> 06:18:15,700
Breathe in.

4005
06:18:16,340 --> 06:18:16,740
Breathe out.

4006
06:18:17,540 --> 06:18:17,940
Breathe in.

4007
06:18:18,740 --> 06:18:19,380
Breathe out.

4008
06:18:19,380 --> 06:18:20,340
You have three in the middle one.

4009
06:18:20,340 --> 06:18:20,740
That off.

4010
06:18:21,540 --> 06:18:22,100
I believe that.

4011
06:18:22,420 --> 06:18:24,420
I'll give a little kiss.

4012
06:18:27,860 --> 06:18:30,260
It looks like a little disco ball, honestly.

4013
06:18:31,780 --> 06:18:35,860
But I feel like I can be on the water for so long now.

4014
06:18:35,860 --> 06:18:38,580
Look at how much oxygen I have.

4015
06:18:38,580 --> 06:18:41,380
I can breathe.

4016
06:18:42,580 --> 06:18:43,700
Well, underwater.

4017
06:18:45,460 --> 06:18:47,460
Like literally, I feel like I have so much now.

4018
06:18:49,060 --> 06:18:50,900
Radiation detectives.

4019
06:18:50,900 --> 06:18:52,660
Good thing I'm going straight back down.

4020
06:18:56,420 --> 06:18:57,620
It's like a disco ball.

4021
06:18:57,620 --> 06:18:58,660
It does.

4022
06:18:58,660 --> 06:19:00,660
Well, having a little party on the back of its tail.

4023
06:19:02,020 --> 06:19:03,540
It's ready to party.

4024
06:19:08,340 --> 06:19:09,460
Okay, let's make this bed.

4025
06:19:09,460 --> 06:19:10,580
Let's hang up the poster.

4026
06:19:11,380 --> 06:19:13,780
Let's put copyright free saxophone music on.

4027
06:19:16,900 --> 06:19:17,780
Let's get in there.

4028
06:19:17,780 --> 06:19:21,060
Hello.

4029
06:19:25,860 --> 06:19:26,580
Thank you.

4030
06:19:27,460 --> 06:19:29,300
And then bed.

4031
06:19:29,300 --> 06:19:30,500
No, bed.

4032
06:19:30,500 --> 06:19:31,700
Bed is this one.

4033
06:19:33,380 --> 06:19:34,180
Bed.

4034
06:19:34,180 --> 06:19:35,060
Oh, fiber mesh.

4035
06:19:36,340 --> 06:19:36,820
Sorry.

4036
06:19:41,220 --> 06:19:43,060
I need two strands of fucking kelp.

4037
06:19:44,580 --> 06:19:46,740
I need two big strands of kelp

4038
06:19:46,740 --> 06:19:47,540
to get one.

4039
06:19:47,540 --> 06:19:48,660
We hang like that, all right.

4040
06:19:51,540 --> 06:19:52,900
No, I'm not playing with food and more.

4041
06:19:52,900 --> 06:19:54,100
I would have reached quite long ago.

4042
06:19:55,620 --> 06:19:56,100
Right.

4043
06:19:56,100 --> 06:19:57,700
So when you enter, okay.

4044
06:19:58,580 --> 06:19:59,300
When you enter.

4045
06:20:01,220 --> 06:20:02,340
Wait, where's the door?

4046
06:20:02,340 --> 06:20:02,980
Ah, close enough.

4047
06:20:02,980 --> 06:20:03,460
Close enough.

4048
06:20:04,020 --> 06:20:06,100
When you enter, there's our bed.

4049
06:20:06,100 --> 06:20:08,340
And then we need to hang the poster up.

4050
06:20:11,460 --> 06:20:11,780
Bed.

4051
06:20:14,340 --> 06:20:14,820
Bind it?

4052
06:20:15,700 --> 06:20:16,980
Like the binding of items.

4053
06:20:17,940 --> 06:20:18,820
And then boom.

4054
06:20:20,740 --> 06:20:21,620
Oh my God.

4055
06:20:21,620 --> 06:20:25,460
So when you enter, it's just like, come on in.

4056
06:20:26,580 --> 06:20:27,460
You know what you want.

4057
06:20:28,420 --> 06:20:29,380
You can sleep now.

4058
06:20:29,380 --> 06:20:30,740
Come on, let's go bed together.

4059
06:20:36,980 --> 06:20:38,580
The poster gets you excited.

4060
06:20:39,300 --> 06:20:40,260
Oh, yes.

4061
06:20:41,220 --> 06:20:42,180
It really wakes you up.

4062
06:20:43,140 --> 06:20:43,780
There.

4063
06:20:43,780 --> 06:20:45,300
And then we wake up well rested

4064
06:20:45,300 --> 06:20:48,180
after having our basic double bed shenanigan.

4065
06:20:50,900 --> 06:20:52,660
The binding of Isaac, the hit video game

4066
06:20:52,660 --> 06:20:53,860
loved by these, Veronica.

4067
06:20:55,060 --> 06:20:56,180
Mommy, I'm not allowed to ink.

4068
06:20:56,180 --> 06:20:57,460
This is evil.

4069
06:20:57,460 --> 06:20:58,820
Oh, what's wrong?

4070
06:20:58,820 --> 06:21:00,180
Are you thinking about inking?

4071
06:21:01,060 --> 06:21:02,180
Is it on your main?

4072
06:21:06,260 --> 06:21:06,820
Right.

4073
06:21:06,820 --> 06:21:09,140
Ah, I'm satisfied to wrap it up.

4074
06:21:10,020 --> 06:21:11,620
If you're satisfied to wrap it up.

4075
06:21:12,900 --> 06:21:13,460
Yes.

4076
06:21:13,460 --> 06:21:15,300
May wrap up, but you don't need a wrapper.

4077
06:21:17,140 --> 06:21:18,660
Then mommy can sweep.

4078
06:21:18,660 --> 06:21:18,900
Yes.

4079
06:21:20,820 --> 06:21:21,380
Ah, right.

4080
06:21:21,380 --> 06:21:22,500
I'm going to save there.

4081
06:21:22,500 --> 06:21:23,620
I'll read some marshmallows

4082
06:21:23,620 --> 06:21:25,700
and then we'll redirect into Azura.

4083
06:21:26,340 --> 06:21:27,220
And if she's coming up.

4084
06:21:29,060 --> 06:21:32,100
I think Azura would be the next one coming up.

4085
06:21:33,220 --> 06:21:36,180
Uh, I think, uh, my followers.

4086
06:21:37,780 --> 06:21:39,380
I don't, am I?

4087
06:21:39,380 --> 06:21:40,420
Does she be following?

4088
06:21:41,140 --> 06:21:41,540
No.

4089
06:21:42,180 --> 06:21:42,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4090
06:21:43,380 --> 06:21:46,180
Oh, she's right in your fucking gun case.

4091
06:21:46,180 --> 06:21:46,980
Oh, that's funny.

4092
06:21:48,420 --> 06:21:49,300
That's funny.

4093
06:21:49,300 --> 06:21:51,700
She's, she's right in your, I mean,

4094
06:21:52,660 --> 06:21:54,820
your bedrooms, your bedrooms.

4095
06:21:54,820 --> 06:21:56,260
She's right in your bedrooms.

4096
06:21:56,260 --> 06:21:57,140
My apologies.

4097
06:21:58,260 --> 06:21:59,220
I was misquoted.

4098
06:22:00,900 --> 06:22:01,700
I was misquoted.

4099
06:22:03,460 --> 06:22:04,500
I was misquoted.

4100
06:22:07,300 --> 06:22:09,540
Azura is like, okay, we'll redirect into Azura.

4101
06:22:09,540 --> 06:22:12,100
I will read some marshmallows.

4102
06:22:12,100 --> 06:22:14,900
Uh, just, if it's missed anything.

4103
06:22:17,460 --> 06:22:21,460
Mommy can't stop thinking about my tentacle.

4104
06:22:21,460 --> 06:22:23,140
Missanjimiko Streamart and Health.

4105
06:22:23,140 --> 06:22:23,620
Wow.

4106
06:22:24,500 --> 06:22:27,540
Would I be so mean to like purposefully do that?

4107
06:22:28,100 --> 06:22:29,380
No, I couldn't be.

4108
06:22:31,780 --> 06:22:33,780
Couldn't, I couldn't be that evil.

4109
06:22:34,820 --> 06:22:35,700
I'm not mean.

4110
06:22:35,700 --> 06:22:36,500
I'm nice.

4111
06:22:36,500 --> 06:22:36,900
Okay.

4112
06:22:38,420 --> 06:22:39,060
Really nice.

4113
06:22:40,500 --> 06:22:44,500
Okay.

4114
06:22:46,980 --> 06:22:47,860
Hi, strongy.

4115
06:22:47,860 --> 06:22:48,340
Shame.

4116
06:22:48,340 --> 06:22:49,460
Wait, no, what?

4117
06:22:49,460 --> 06:22:50,100
Hi, mommy.

4118
06:22:50,100 --> 06:22:50,900
Hi, Evelyn.

4119
06:22:50,900 --> 06:22:52,740
Shameless strongy merch plug.

4120
06:22:52,740 --> 06:22:54,500
Every market has a hoodie and sweatpants

4121
06:22:54,500 --> 06:22:56,020
feel going on right now that ends fair.

4122
06:22:56,020 --> 06:22:58,740
Oh, well, if you're ever in the mid for a hood.

4123
06:23:02,660 --> 06:23:04,900
Denialings and shambles, honestly.

4124
06:23:07,140 --> 06:23:08,740
Another clip, a bit of the Tizm.

4125
06:23:09,940 --> 06:23:11,380
Okay, hold on.

4126
06:23:11,380 --> 06:23:12,100
What's the clip?

4127
06:23:14,340 --> 06:23:15,300
There's one minute long.

4128
06:23:16,580 --> 06:23:18,980
Oh, it was named in the lockers.

4129
06:23:20,340 --> 06:23:22,580
Mummy president, a second plaintiff hit them.

4130
06:23:23,300 --> 06:23:30,980
Oh, Ruflin, Ruflin, that anniversary was really recent.

4131
06:23:31,620 --> 06:23:34,100
Ruflin, you made me read that out loud.

4132
06:23:34,660 --> 06:23:39,060
Please, please pause.

4133
06:23:39,060 --> 06:23:40,100
It's going to blow up.

4134
06:23:40,100 --> 06:23:40,820
Oh, fuck.

4135
06:23:40,820 --> 06:23:42,420
Like, wait, it blows up further.

4136
06:23:46,260 --> 06:23:48,180
It's not, I already blew up once.

4137
06:23:49,060 --> 06:23:50,500
It blew up like it's core.

4138
06:23:52,500 --> 06:23:54,820
I can't believe you made me say that.

4139
06:23:54,820 --> 06:23:55,220
I don't.

4140
06:23:55,220 --> 06:23:55,940
I don't.

4141
06:24:02,900 --> 06:24:05,220
Strongy, have every intent of destroying me during this week

4142
06:24:06,740 --> 06:24:07,860
of denial.

4143
06:24:07,860 --> 06:24:09,220
I'm really going to be kind of sure.

4144
06:24:10,340 --> 06:24:11,940
I think the refunds are going to blow up.

4145
06:24:11,940 --> 06:24:13,460
Turn on the TV, strongy.

4146
06:24:13,460 --> 06:24:14,660
Any channel, fuck.

4147
06:24:16,100 --> 06:24:16,980
You're not American.

4148
06:24:16,980 --> 06:24:17,700
That's okay.

4149
06:24:17,700 --> 06:24:19,300
No, I never said it in the first place.

4150
06:24:19,300 --> 06:24:20,260
Now hold on a minute.

4151
06:24:20,260 --> 06:24:21,860
You can say the streams are prerecorded,

4152
06:24:21,860 --> 06:24:23,700
but you kind of say that I'm fucking putting that shit.

4153
06:24:24,500 --> 06:24:29,940
What is your sexuality?

4154
06:24:29,940 --> 06:24:31,140
I'm riefling sexual.

4155
06:24:33,540 --> 06:24:34,740
I'm rief sexual.

4156
06:24:37,460 --> 06:24:38,980
I need some R words.

4157
06:24:38,980 --> 06:24:40,740
R word and mumma.

4158
06:24:42,180 --> 06:24:42,660
All of that.

4159
06:24:42,660 --> 06:24:43,540
I'm rief sexual.

4160
06:24:43,540 --> 06:24:44,020
I like it.

4161
06:24:45,300 --> 06:24:45,620
Yes.

4162
06:24:47,140 --> 06:24:49,060
Mummy, I didn't get to play yesterday because of work.

4163
06:24:49,940 --> 06:24:51,140
Should I participate?

4164
06:24:51,140 --> 06:24:52,420
No, you didn't play.

4165
06:24:52,500 --> 06:24:52,980
That's okay.

4166
06:25:00,980 --> 06:25:01,940
No, not the reefs.

4167
06:25:01,940 --> 06:25:03,540
They're spoiled as it is.

4168
06:25:03,540 --> 06:25:05,140
Is it time for a daily group?

4169
06:25:05,140 --> 06:25:05,380
No.

4170
06:25:06,900 --> 06:25:08,980
She sees the reef when it needs to snuggle,

4171
06:25:08,980 --> 06:25:10,500
struggle them, literally.

4172
06:25:10,500 --> 06:25:13,140
I need to get artwork of me going feral.

4173
06:25:15,140 --> 06:25:17,620
Like as soon as a spot, like spot yet over.

4174
06:25:22,820 --> 06:25:26,740
It seems like everything's relatively calm and quiet

4175
06:25:27,700 --> 06:25:29,060
on the recent side.

4176
06:25:29,060 --> 06:25:31,860
Are you guys going to be okay if I redirect into a zero?

4177
06:25:31,860 --> 06:25:33,060
And then we'll continue this.

4178
06:25:34,420 --> 06:25:35,940
Got baby rabies?

4179
06:25:35,940 --> 06:25:37,540
I bring on the struggle snuggles.

4180
06:25:37,540 --> 06:25:39,140
Yeah, I think you can handle it.

4181
06:25:39,780 --> 06:25:40,500
That's cute.

4182
06:25:43,460 --> 06:25:46,100
Mumma, I have to go do some stuff.

4183
06:25:46,100 --> 06:25:47,300
Love you, love you too, reef.

4184
06:25:47,300 --> 06:25:48,100
Then have a good night.

4185
06:25:48,100 --> 06:25:49,140
You have a good night too.

4186
06:25:50,260 --> 06:25:51,220
No, great.

4187
06:25:51,220 --> 06:25:53,060
There are denials among us.

4188
06:25:53,060 --> 06:25:53,380
Me.

4189
06:25:55,220 --> 06:25:59,540
Yeah, you're going to enjoy as soon as soon as you can.

4190
06:25:59,540 --> 06:26:01,220
Cave reviews soon.

4191
06:26:02,420 --> 06:26:03,780
Thank you so much.

4192
06:26:03,780 --> 06:26:06,580
I feel like, oh, wait, hold on.

4193
06:26:12,580 --> 06:26:13,140
Hold on.

4194
06:26:14,100 --> 06:26:15,540
I don't think my shoes are done.

4195
06:26:15,540 --> 06:26:17,140
And my display is broken.

4196
06:26:19,140 --> 06:26:20,740
I don't know why display does this to me.

4197
06:26:21,620 --> 06:26:23,700
I feel like it is a personal attack on me.

4198
06:26:26,980 --> 06:26:30,740
Oh, I'm like, come on.

4199
06:26:45,460 --> 06:26:47,700
Okay, now I'm not going to go rip.

4200
06:26:48,660 --> 06:26:50,420
Um, next.

4201
06:26:50,420 --> 06:26:53,460
Oh God, can I even remember anything I picked next week?

4202
06:26:53,460 --> 06:26:53,860
Fuck.

4203
06:26:56,980 --> 06:26:59,540
I'm trying to think of one thing I picked for next week.

4204
06:26:59,540 --> 06:27:01,620
We're not doing the Left 4 Dead Streams night next week

4205
06:27:01,620 --> 06:27:03,780
because there's like, I think I did it wrong.

4206
06:27:03,780 --> 06:27:04,500
I'm so sorry.

4207
06:27:04,500 --> 06:27:06,740
I've completely forgotten what I planned next week.

4208
06:27:10,580 --> 06:27:11,940
An ASMR stream?

4209
06:27:11,940 --> 06:27:12,900
Okay, slay.

4210
06:27:15,220 --> 06:27:17,220
A membership stream?

4211
06:27:18,340 --> 06:27:20,180
What else did I pick?

4212
06:27:20,180 --> 06:27:26,180
Um, I've no got a fucking review.

4213
06:27:26,180 --> 06:27:29,940
Have a Austin power.

4214
06:27:29,940 --> 06:27:31,140
Oh, wait, I tell.

4215
06:27:31,140 --> 06:27:31,620
Hold on.

4216
06:27:32,500 --> 06:27:33,140
Hold on.

4217
06:27:34,020 --> 06:27:35,060
Pause the tunes.

4218
06:27:35,060 --> 06:27:35,940
Pause the tunes.

4219
06:27:35,940 --> 06:27:37,620
I've just, I've just got it.

4220
06:27:37,620 --> 06:27:38,260
I've got it.

4221
06:27:39,140 --> 06:27:41,380
There is a hand cam stream next week.

4222
06:27:45,860 --> 06:27:47,140
Okay, hold on.

4223
06:27:47,140 --> 06:27:48,020
Is this going to work?

4224
06:27:48,660 --> 06:27:49,300
I don't know.

4225
06:27:50,020 --> 06:27:50,420
Hold on.

4226
06:27:50,420 --> 06:27:51,140
I got my schedule.

4227
06:27:51,140 --> 06:27:51,700
You ready for it?

4228
06:27:54,500 --> 06:27:54,980
Where is it?

4229
06:27:57,620 --> 06:27:59,140
Uh, it's not displayed.

4230
06:27:59,140 --> 06:28:00,340
What is going on?

4231
06:28:00,340 --> 06:28:02,660
My OBS is having a really hard time.

4232
06:28:02,660 --> 06:28:05,460
I'll like tell it to show something and then it doesn't.

4233
06:28:05,460 --> 06:28:06,580
And it's like, no, I'm not showing.

4234
06:28:06,580 --> 06:28:07,940
I'm like, what do you mean you're not showing?

4235
06:28:09,780 --> 06:28:12,020
What do you mean you're not going to show the file

4236
06:28:12,020 --> 06:28:14,900
that I have identified for you to fucking show?

4237
06:28:15,460 --> 06:28:16,660
She's never gone home.

4238
06:28:17,860 --> 06:28:21,940
Okay, so we're, so two hand cam streams.

4239
06:28:23,220 --> 06:28:28,420
Um, this two hand cam streams.

4240
06:28:28,420 --> 06:28:30,820
So we're opening Pokemon cards.

4241
06:28:31,860 --> 06:28:32,500
Tomorrow.

4242
06:28:34,260 --> 06:28:37,780
And then, um, Sheevie let me rope her into playing Portal 2

4243
06:28:37,780 --> 06:28:38,420
for the first time.

4244
06:28:41,220 --> 06:28:43,140
And then we're doing one hand of clapping.

4245
06:28:43,140 --> 06:28:47,140
Where's like, it's not me clapping without my hands.

4246
06:28:47,140 --> 06:28:47,620
Okay.

4247
06:28:47,620 --> 06:28:49,380
I promise that comes later.

4248
06:28:50,180 --> 06:28:51,300
Oh, my game's playing again.

4249
06:28:51,300 --> 06:28:51,620
Sorry.

4250
06:28:53,620 --> 06:28:57,300
And then I'm doing fable three.

4251
06:28:57,300 --> 06:28:58,820
I'm doing it over two parts.

4252
06:29:00,020 --> 06:29:02,980
And then I'm doing a 25 K celebration stream.

4253
06:29:06,740 --> 06:29:08,340
Which rhymes with Vengebus.

4254
06:29:08,340 --> 06:29:13,940
Um, and then I'm doing a hand cam stream,

4255
06:29:13,940 --> 06:29:15,300
which is clay foam hand cam.

4256
06:29:16,100 --> 06:29:18,420
I'm gonna, I've never done it in my life,

4257
06:29:18,420 --> 06:29:19,460
but I'm going to do it.

4258
06:29:19,460 --> 06:29:20,420
I'm going to give it a shot.

4259
06:29:20,420 --> 06:29:20,660
Okay.

4260
06:29:22,020 --> 06:29:24,260
I'm going to try and make everyone's mascots.

4261
06:29:25,060 --> 06:29:27,140
Obviously going to start with my refunds first.

4262
06:29:28,260 --> 06:29:32,020
Um, and then maybe let's like spin a wheel.

4263
06:29:32,020 --> 06:29:34,260
Um, and then we'll make everyone's mascots.

4264
06:29:35,380 --> 06:29:36,020
But yeah.

4265
06:29:36,980 --> 06:29:40,340
Um, there is a membership ASMR.

4266
06:29:40,340 --> 06:29:41,700
There's a membership script right in,

4267
06:29:41,700 --> 06:29:42,980
and then membership watch along.

4268
06:29:43,620 --> 06:29:45,700
So only three membership streams this week.

4269
06:29:45,700 --> 06:29:46,020
Bye.

4270
06:29:47,140 --> 06:29:47,540
Bye.

4271
06:29:49,060 --> 06:29:51,780
Um, member 25 K continued.

4272
06:29:51,780 --> 06:29:52,660
Oh my days.

4273
06:29:53,700 --> 06:29:54,980
I won't be dumped by this.

4274
06:29:59,060 --> 06:29:59,700
So yeah.

4275
06:29:59,700 --> 06:30:00,900
Clealing's rise up.

4276
06:30:01,460 --> 06:30:02,260
Oh, and lay.

4277
06:30:02,260 --> 06:30:02,980
I mean, we bet.

4278
06:30:02,980 --> 06:30:03,460
Hold on.

4279
06:30:03,460 --> 06:30:04,260
I needed to.

4280
06:30:08,500 --> 06:30:09,460
That was very audible.

4281
06:30:12,580 --> 06:30:14,420
Bring on the awkward long handshakes.

4282
06:30:14,420 --> 06:30:16,260
Wait, what's an awkward long handshake?

4283
06:30:18,020 --> 06:30:19,220
Only three for eating, dude.

4284
06:30:19,220 --> 06:30:20,820
I'm almost happy I'm a specific stream.

4285
06:30:21,940 --> 06:30:23,060
Are you in Scotland?

4286
06:30:23,060 --> 06:30:24,900
No, I was born there though.

4287
06:30:26,180 --> 06:30:27,380
I'm going back there.

4288
06:30:28,500 --> 06:30:30,020
So I wrap up my business.

4289
06:30:33,780 --> 06:30:35,540
Only three.

4290
06:30:35,540 --> 06:30:37,220
Mommy, you do more membership things in a week

4291
06:30:37,220 --> 06:30:38,020
than what's done a month.

4292
06:30:39,620 --> 06:30:40,500
You said it.

4293
06:30:40,500 --> 06:30:41,220
Not me.

4294
06:30:41,220 --> 06:30:42,660
You were the one who said it,

4295
06:30:42,660 --> 06:30:43,860
but you were thinking it.

4296
06:30:43,860 --> 06:30:44,580
Or be playing.

4297
06:30:44,580 --> 06:30:45,380
You were thinking it.

4298
06:30:46,260 --> 06:30:48,980
And the good thing is when next week's finished,

4299
06:30:48,980 --> 06:30:51,460
we're going to be at a new part again.

4300
06:30:57,300 --> 06:30:58,340
I don't think that's a far.

4301
06:30:58,340 --> 06:30:58,660
Hmm.

4302
06:30:59,700 --> 06:31:00,580
I think it was a ship.

4303
06:31:02,100 --> 06:31:03,300
Has been a few days.

4304
06:31:03,300 --> 06:31:03,780
Um.

4305
06:31:06,580 --> 06:31:09,460
Then we'll be very shortly hitting the four months

4306
06:31:09,460 --> 06:31:10,420
streaming mark.

4307
06:31:10,420 --> 06:31:11,300
Can you believe it?

4308
06:31:11,860 --> 06:31:13,860
Oh, which is insane to think of it.

4309
06:31:13,860 --> 06:31:16,020
Like four freaking months together.

4310
06:31:17,380 --> 06:31:17,860
Hmm.

4311
06:31:19,140 --> 06:31:19,940
A what?

4312
06:31:19,940 --> 06:31:20,740
A shite?

4313
06:31:20,740 --> 06:31:21,940
A jobby?

4314
06:31:21,940 --> 06:31:22,980
Oh, sorry, sorry.

4315
06:31:22,980 --> 06:31:23,860
Were you expecting?

4316
06:31:25,860 --> 06:31:28,500
I need to go for an idle meeting.

4317
06:31:29,140 --> 06:31:30,340
Give me a moment.

4318
06:31:31,620 --> 06:31:33,060
No, around here.

4319
06:31:33,140 --> 06:31:35,540
We do big fat shites in that pan.

4320
06:31:36,420 --> 06:31:39,860
So get on that toilet and get fucking even.

4321
06:31:43,300 --> 06:31:48,900
I want you to push so hard that the fucking air that comes

4322
06:31:48,900 --> 06:31:51,860
out of your ass is enough to cut bricks.

4323
06:31:51,860 --> 06:31:52,180
Okay.

4324
06:31:52,180 --> 06:31:54,660
That's how hard I want you pushing on that toilet.

4325
06:31:54,660 --> 06:31:56,580
We do fucking shites around here.

4326
06:31:56,580 --> 06:31:57,300
We don't know.

4327
06:31:57,300 --> 06:31:59,300
We don't do idle meetings around these parts.

4328
06:32:00,980 --> 06:32:01,940
You what?

4329
06:32:03,300 --> 06:32:03,780
I just.

4330
06:32:14,740 --> 06:32:16,820
Anyway, yes, that's our agenda nation.

4331
06:32:16,820 --> 06:32:20,820
So I'll start putting up those streams, uh, those shortly.

4332
06:32:20,820 --> 06:32:22,500
Um, but yes, more hand cam.

4333
06:32:22,500 --> 06:32:22,900
Oh my god.

4334
06:32:22,900 --> 06:32:23,220
Surprise.

4335
06:32:23,220 --> 06:32:23,540
Surprise.

4336
06:32:24,500 --> 06:32:25,300
Yes, we're going.

4337
06:32:25,860 --> 06:32:28,580
I have, I bought a Pokemon set.

4338
06:32:28,580 --> 06:32:30,500
It is called, it's behind me.

4339
06:32:31,140 --> 06:32:33,140
It's called Paladin's fate.

4340
06:32:33,140 --> 06:32:35,460
No, Pal, Paladin's fate.

4341
06:32:35,460 --> 06:32:39,220
Oh my god, I'm such a fake Pokemon enjoyer.

4342
06:32:39,220 --> 06:32:44,180
Um, and then I also have the Pokedex.

4343
06:32:44,180 --> 06:32:47,380
So we can like slot it in the right coin thing.

4344
06:32:47,380 --> 06:32:48,180
Aim a bobber.

4345
06:32:48,740 --> 06:32:51,620
The risk is high that you see my face because of the reflective surfaces,

4346
06:32:51,620 --> 06:32:54,020
but you know, just imagine like a really depressed looking guy.

4347
06:32:54,740 --> 06:32:55,380
And then it's fine.

4348
06:32:56,020 --> 06:32:56,660
It's fine.

4349
06:32:56,660 --> 06:32:57,380
Don't use shite.

4350
06:32:57,380 --> 06:33:00,580
Uh, a Paladin's fate?

4351
06:33:00,580 --> 06:33:02,100
Is this Paladin's fate?

4352
06:33:02,100 --> 06:33:03,540
And it had a mimic key on the front.

4353
06:33:03,540 --> 06:33:04,660
So winner.

4354
06:33:06,420 --> 06:33:07,940
I had a stomach bug two weeks ago.

4355
06:33:07,940 --> 06:33:09,380
That's blessed and everything.

4356
06:33:09,380 --> 06:33:10,500
Gamba in real life.

4357
06:33:10,500 --> 06:33:11,140
Yes.

4358
06:33:11,140 --> 06:33:12,980
You're gonna keep talking Scottish accents.

4359
06:33:12,980 --> 06:33:13,540
Amazing.

4360
06:33:14,660 --> 06:33:16,740
I really depressed cute looking guy.

4361
06:33:16,740 --> 06:33:21,860
So yeah, that's the agenda nation for next week.

4362
06:33:21,860 --> 06:33:24,420
Sorry, uh, is there a stream state?

4363
06:33:24,420 --> 06:33:25,380
No, there isn't.

4364
06:33:25,460 --> 06:33:28,500
Oh, I must have had to make way for the stream site

4365
06:33:29,860 --> 06:33:32,180
for the 25k celebration.

4366
06:33:34,100 --> 06:33:36,820
Hmm, why is there no stream site?

4367
06:33:39,380 --> 06:33:42,260
I suppose with the stream site numbers after 11 days.

4368
06:33:45,460 --> 06:33:46,900
The cutest girl here.

4369
06:33:46,900 --> 06:33:48,340
I'm looking forward to next week.

4370
06:33:48,340 --> 06:33:48,980
Yeah.

4371
06:33:48,980 --> 06:33:53,300
And I'll try and rework Subnautica into the next week

4372
06:33:53,300 --> 06:33:55,860
and Left 4 Dead 2 into the week after

4373
06:33:55,860 --> 06:33:59,060
to get the thingy.

4374
06:33:59,060 --> 06:34:01,460
As always, the stream started the exact same time.

4375
06:34:01,460 --> 06:34:02,420
Things have calmed down now.

4376
06:34:02,420 --> 06:34:04,500
I don't really have to mix around stream times

4377
06:34:04,500 --> 06:34:06,020
for anything or collabs.

4378
06:34:06,020 --> 06:34:09,700
Probably collabs or the ASMR stream train

4379
06:34:09,700 --> 06:34:12,500
is kind of the only exception to my stream time.

4380
06:34:12,500 --> 06:34:14,820
So as I said, I'll be here every day at the same time.

4381
06:34:15,540 --> 06:34:18,740
I look forward to seeing cute little things Monday or Wednesday.

4382
06:34:18,820 --> 06:34:24,020
Um, what happened to the Overwatch board?

4383
06:34:24,020 --> 06:34:26,500
Um, I got a little bit too much.

4384
06:34:26,500 --> 06:34:29,060
Um, so I had to remove it for safety

4385
06:34:29,060 --> 06:34:32,500
because I got a little too in over my head.

4386
06:34:33,300 --> 06:34:38,820
Um, so I do apologize without, um, but I couldn't do that.

4387
06:34:39,700 --> 06:34:43,460
We will redirect into the lovely Azura Duley.

4388
06:34:44,500 --> 06:34:46,500
While she's reviewing your Yun KV,

4389
06:34:47,140 --> 06:34:51,060
um, please do enjoy her to your heart's content.

4390
06:34:51,060 --> 06:34:52,340
I will see you tomorrow.

4391
06:34:52,340 --> 06:34:54,500
And you get to look at my lovely nails again.

4392
06:34:54,500 --> 06:34:55,300
That's right.

4393
06:34:57,620 --> 06:34:59,060
And you get to see my nails again.

4394
06:34:59,700 --> 06:35:01,940
I'm actually really interested in more hand cam streams.

4395
06:35:01,940 --> 06:35:03,460
I have so much fun doing those.

4396
06:35:03,460 --> 06:35:05,780
Like, it feels like I can do so much more in them.

4397
06:35:06,420 --> 06:35:10,020
But yeah, I might do hand cam ASMRs once a month.

4398
06:35:10,020 --> 06:35:12,820
And then I'll get a new nail set just to feel extra feminine.

4399
06:35:13,700 --> 06:35:16,900
Oh, feminine, feminine, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

4400
06:35:20,740 --> 06:35:23,540
Okay, I love you lots, little v-flin.

4401
06:35:23,540 --> 06:35:24,500
How many kisses?

4402
06:35:24,500 --> 06:35:26,980
How many, oh god, how does kisses work in this game?

4403
06:35:28,340 --> 06:35:30,980
How many things did we get?

4404
06:35:30,980 --> 06:35:33,140
I don't, I don't know how to sign kisses.

4405
06:35:34,900 --> 06:35:36,740
We unlocked a lot of stuff.

4406
06:35:36,740 --> 06:35:40,260
225 kisses for oxygen, a zillion.

4407
06:35:41,140 --> 06:35:42,660
Will the nail color be another hint?

4408
06:35:42,660 --> 06:35:44,420
I'll see. It depends what happens.

4409
06:35:50,020 --> 06:35:52,020
Obama will be in Texas for today.

4410
06:35:52,020 --> 06:35:53,300
How many days have passed?

4411
06:35:53,300 --> 06:35:55,140
Oh, good one, good one.

4412
06:35:56,660 --> 06:35:57,940
We're on day 19.

4413
06:35:57,940 --> 06:36:01,940
Okay.

4414
06:36:01,940 --> 06:36:12,420
19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19.

4415
06:36:12,420 --> 06:36:18,660
for the extra. Please enjoy Azura and as always Azura isn't me and I am not

4416
06:36:18,660 --> 06:36:21,540
Azura so she likes things differently from the way I do when it comes to

4417
06:36:21,540 --> 06:36:25,540
communicating in chat but as always I know you will behave because you are my

4418
06:36:25,540 --> 06:36:32,020
friend. And I will see you tomorrow for some awesome Pokemon cards. You need to

4419
06:36:32,020 --> 06:36:35,940
wish me luck and you need to tell me how to open them. Do I put like two to the

4420
06:36:35,940 --> 06:36:40,700
back or something? We'll find out tomorrow okay? Love ya, see you tomorrow. Have a

4421
06:36:40,700 --> 06:36:46,420
good rest and have a good hydration and a good stretch okay? Bye bye and remember

4422
06:36:46,420 --> 06:36:49,540
no inking.
