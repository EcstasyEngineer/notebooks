that again okay body do I make myself clear okay vealor is the first agency of its kind horn dogs on me

07:21.440 --> 07:28.640
what did you why did you choose vealor instead of remaining independent Azura and Azura said

07:29.200 --> 07:40.480
I saw a great opportunity and vealor entrusted in our vision the support a company can give its

07:40.480 --> 07:46.880
talent is a great starting point oh thank you Azura really you're far too kind but how important

07:46.880 --> 07:54.880
was the amount of freedom with content creation being open to discussing pls etc for you I don't

07:54.880 --> 08:02.240
really want to discuss my pl but I'm happy that I get the freedom to talk about some aspects of

08:02.240 --> 08:09.360
life even when wanting to create new memories and the future for myself oh sure that's so kind of you

08:10.080 --> 08:14.960
I'm glad that you enjoyed that uh we're an agency that doesn't acknowledge your fucking brand new

08:14.960 --> 08:22.720
out the out the out the package okay thank you Azura I appreciate that and what platform did you

08:22.720 --> 08:31.200
want to make content on prior to being a part of vealor Azura since I originally streamed on Twitch

08:31.200 --> 08:40.000
I wanted to make the move to youtube and continue making content there including shorts and I actually

08:40.000 --> 08:45.280
speaking of shorts Azura sorry to interrupt you I've just ordered four shorts of you right now

08:45.280 --> 08:50.160
okay I'm just waiting on an asset and there's four shorts coming they're quite humorous okay okay

08:50.160 --> 08:56.240
strong thank you yes actually she calls me stroney as in minna stroney like she didn't go stroney

08:56.240 --> 09:02.400

09:02.400 --> 09:08.640
you love yeah yeah thanks Azura okay sorry to interrupt you back to the question uh as content

09:08.640 --> 09:15.520
there doesn't entirely get removed after a few days like twitch box okay thank you Azura okay

09:17.360 --> 09:24.640
but what inspired you to create content or content in general for that matter Azura

09:25.440 --> 09:32.960
I've always had a feel for voice acting and always wanted to take part in some kind of way

09:33.760 --> 09:40.800
the many voices that approached me were compliment towards my voice and how I should pursue it

09:41.360 --> 09:49.680
which piqued my curiosity in the air however the many voices claimed my voice is extremely

09:49.680 --> 09:59.920
erotic oh so when the opportunity appeared it felt like it was meant to be oh wow I agree with

09:59.920 --> 10:04.960
that I am sure people did compliment you I have no doubts about that Azura I absolutely no doubts

10:04.960 --> 10:15.920
at all um is there any content you're particularly interested in making well that would be the

10:16.880 --> 10:26.720
awesome raw place oh Azura all right I also look forward to being in other opportunity oh is that a hint to the video game Azura

10:26.720 --> 10:34.400
Azura is that a hint to the video game I don't know by the way before anyone's like oh new viewer

10:34.400 --> 10:40.400
here I thought stroney was a mix of strong and funny oh um for anyone who's like uh did you

10:40.480 --> 10:45.840
look over the girls answers and stuff uh I think I fixed one sentence and it was in mercies

10:46.800 --> 10:51.040
that's it I've not changed any all these answers are what they actually said I fixed one sentence

10:51.040 --> 10:56.320
in mercies which I actually didn't tell her about sorry mercy yeah fuck you stroney that's not what

10:56.320 --> 11:01.520
you sound like anyway well double fuck you then right whoa whoa whoa sit down sit down whoa

11:01.520 --> 11:07.840
I'm fighting myself here okay stop stop okay uh do you have any uh other content creators advice on

11:07.840 --> 11:13.520
how to navigate uh creating uh alternative content on the internet especially when it comes

11:13.520 --> 11:21.920
safely navigating it because I miss the word safely there if it's a view tubing related and you wish

11:21.920 --> 11:28.560
to keep your identity private try not to share too much information that could put you at risk for

11:28.960 --> 11:34.480
but it's perfectly okay to be honest and do things that make what

11:36.960 --> 11:42.400
don't oh don't force your side I fucking can't read in my own interview yeah is there are you okay

11:42.400 --> 11:47.600
do you need glasses you know you're the fucking I'm putting my glasses on okay hold on right glasses

11:47.600 --> 11:57.040
are on right everything's enlarged I can actually see no Azura just I'm fucking made that up hold on

11:57.040 --> 12:05.760
me fucking neglects Azura I'll let her it this is the lore oh it steady on right uh don't force

12:05.760 --> 12:12.320
yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable and the rather open up slowly okay I'll open you

12:12.320 --> 12:16.800
up slowly Azura thank you uh right what was the next question uh what do you hope to bring or

12:16.800 --> 12:23.360
change in the view tubing landscape Azura I don't think I can change much of anything but I would

12:23.360 --> 12:32.960
hope that people can see more person of color talent in the image oh I like that thank you thank

12:32.960 --> 12:40.320

oh thank you very much AC did you enjoy your your gorilla guild wars two stream

13:15.840 --> 13:23.920

13:23.920 --> 13:30.400
AC's previous guild war stream is she got a train ran on her uh hmm I wonder why she wanted to play

13:30.400 --> 13:38.640

14:00.160 --> 14:07.280

look she's my baby girl okay she my she my doll face she my doll face

14:25.600 --> 14:32.160
mm-hmm okay we're currently reading Azur's interview from a acapella media look at them

14:32.400 --> 14:42.720
I just revealed a bit of secret lore about um the uh design uh the promotional artwork this was

14:42.720 --> 14:48.720
ordered before the designs were finalized because look Azur doesn't have her nails painted and one

14:48.720 --> 14:56.160
of the biggest giveaways is her headband if it has floating jewellery that's actually uh that's

14:56.160 --> 15:04.800
actually a massive giveaway on if uh the artwork was completed or not at that point um they forgot

15:04.800 --> 15:09.520
about the jewellery on their toes oh yeah actually yeah that was another big thing so you can tell

15:09.520 --> 15:19.280
what stage of panic in production we were at depending on what the thing was but now everything's

15:19.280 --> 15:27.920
made correctly um oh oh my god the tea is steaming up my glasses I forget glasses steam up

15:31.680 --> 15:35.840
okay I've had my tea right back to the questions uh Azur can I keep question yet of course

15:36.400 --> 15:43.440
Stroney okay thank you Azur um right what's one thing you want people to remember about you

15:43.440 --> 15:50.720
individually or as a generation I may not be the first but I started with almost nothing

15:51.280 --> 15:59.280
I did the best I could and achieved very little I just want to show others that it's very possible

15:59.280 --> 16:06.240
and you shouldn't give up I still have a long way to go yes um I I think me and Azura are completely

16:06.240 --> 16:14.080
on the exact same page when I say this um I see a lot of potential in Azura which is why she's Azura

16:15.120 --> 16:24.000
um you know I I see myself and the girls to different degrees and Azura was definitely

16:24.000 --> 16:29.200
and I don't think this is an insult in any way I think she completely 100% gets what why I say this

16:29.200 --> 16:36.000
I think Azura is the the version of me that I see that I needed a helping hand or a gating hand

16:36.000 --> 16:40.800
and once you know things settle down and everything I'm going to try and get her moved out with her

16:40.800 --> 16:45.360
donathon that's coming up next month which is actually really exciting it comes up in August

16:46.320 --> 16:50.960
I'm going to try and get her moved out and then things can kind of I think it's upwards and onwards

16:50.960 --> 16:58.160
for Azura after that the underdog yes I I I'm a sucker for my underdog I always root for them

16:58.160 --> 17:04.720
and I think Azura has insane potential she just needs a few things to occur

17:05.680 --> 17:10.080
and then I I think she's got it she's absolutely she's got nothing to worry about

17:10.080 --> 17:16.400
um but we just need to first get her moved out and then I can just nuke her brain on all the

17:16.400 --> 17:25.200
secrets and behind the scenes stuff okay my little pad of one yes uh right um what do you want to

17:25.200 --> 17:37.920
represent in the v-tube sphere Azura I'm not I just I know I'm just another voice but I want to do

17:37.920 --> 17:45.680
so much more with that voice I always thought my voice was very no it's not I Azura I picked you

17:45.680 --> 17:51.680
because you said I need more gold in your goddamn voice I was about to cross off your damn stream

17:51.680 --> 17:57.200
you're a league player you but maybe I can find something that can truly represent in the beach

17:57.200 --> 18:05.040
on the sphere yes um Azura humble max and literally I everyone knows why I picked them

18:05.040 --> 18:09.600
I told them I said it on debut and I told them like one on one like hey this is why you got picked

18:09.600 --> 18:17.040
or type thing um now you have to remember this is the first time Azura has ever been in any kind

18:17.040 --> 18:23.200
of spotlight kind of had this attention so please don't be afraid if the girls may have said something

18:23.200 --> 18:28.080
that wasn't the kindest to themselves they're not all confident you know they can't all be

18:29.280 --> 18:38.160
just absolutely arrogant like myself um so if you see if you see a reply and you're like oh that's

18:38.160 --> 18:44.800
a wee shame just remember these some of these girls have never achieved anything close to what

18:44.800 --> 18:50.000
they've achieved in the very first month of the very first month at Vilaura they have not achieved

18:50.000 --> 18:56.400
that and they're at their time as a content creator so very yes we will grow and blossom their

18:56.400 --> 19:03.600
confidence just as the beautiful nasturtiums blossom you know stroney you're just being truthful

19:03.600 --> 19:10.000
to yourself as an arrogant okay one more question for Azura and we have finalized Azura's interview

19:10.000 --> 19:17.680
mm-hmm uh Azura is there any event in VTubing history that is incredibly significant to you

19:18.880 --> 19:25.440
there isn't one that particularly stood out to me but I suppose seeing the rise of Vilaura

19:26.000 --> 19:33.360
already coming out with the person of color talent right off the bat was incredibly nice

19:34.160 --> 19:41.600
as well as management being open to more person of color designs behind the scenes

19:41.600 --> 19:50.640
and developments was very reassuring it wasn't a publicity stunt now I have a oh boy do I have

19:50.640 --> 19:56.320
some information about gen 2 to leak to you motherfuckers uh yeah you're not ready for what

19:56.320 --> 20:03.440
occurred yesterday with the development team oh boy right that is uh beautiful Azura Dooley

20:03.440 --> 20:10.080
please do uh find her youtube channel in the link in the description below you can subscribe

20:10.080 --> 20:15.200

20:15.200 --> 20:21.360
goes to Sheebie and then we're rotating all over again because a few of the shorts editors uh have

20:21.360 --> 20:27.120
exams etc so I'm having to rotate gracefully between each girl to try and give them a fair

20:27.120 --> 20:31.600

okay interview vealor is the first agency of its kind why did you my little icicle choose it

22:20.720 --> 22:28.880
instead of remaining independent um i already had a previously good experience with them

22:30.160 --> 22:38.400

you hello i already have a pretty a previously good experience with the investor and from that day i

23:02.720 --> 23:10.240
always had a good impression of her so when i heard of the plans she was making i wanted to take

23:10.240 --> 23:18.560
part of it so much because i knew i'd feel safer under her wing and the concept of vealor i'm trying

23:19.360 --> 23:26.880
just to appeal the last to me being an indie was also very lonely to be in a group of girls that

23:26.880 --> 23:33.680
are degenerates like me i'm not right though like working all together to reach her dream sounded like

23:33.680 --> 23:41.520
the perfect place for me oh that's so lovely ac i'm so glad that you feel comfortable around

23:41.520 --> 23:46.640
us all being degenerates okay for the next question my little icicle how important was the

23:46.640 --> 23:53.040
amount of freedom that content creation being open with your pl etc was for you it was pretty

23:53.040 --> 23:59.600
important it was it make me nervous and overwhelmed if i had to rethink everything i say in fear of

23:59.600 --> 24:08.000
getting in trouble for it okay i just like to be comfy and to talk about whatever without worrying

24:08.000 --> 24:13.360
about that stuff oh i'm yeah no it honestly it's fine i'm not gonna pretend that you've never streamed

24:13.360 --> 24:18.800
before ever in your life okay i'm losing it's almost like i'm losing my mind hearing all these

24:18.800 --> 24:27.600
voices um okay uh what platforms did you want to make content on prior being on vealor my little

24:27.600 --> 24:35.440
icicle pretty much all of them are the known ones like twitch and youtube and twitter and patreon

24:35.520 --> 24:43.600
et cetera all right okay okay what inspired you to create content or just content in general

24:43.600 --> 24:52.320
for that matter hold on i need to refresh oh my name is icicle i have always done things on the

24:52.320 --> 25:00.720
creative side or have many ideas i wanted to bring to life seeing the things that people would create

25:00.720 --> 25:08.320
or do puts a fire in me you know what else is in her today the fucking dad does

25:10.480 --> 25:19.520
stop running a train oh my god thank you back to you ac that's far wait hold on what's your

25:19.520 --> 25:27.200
voice again it's no pause that's far to want to try and create those things myself everything

25:27.200 --> 25:34.320
expires me from music to art to poems to movies to animation god damn ac you pull from a love

25:34.320 --> 25:41.600
inspiration um are we sure stroney is a cut official not apparent do you have any advice

25:41.600 --> 25:48.960
for other content creators to navigate the field safety be careful with how much you share of your

25:48.960 --> 25:54.880
identity it sometimes makes you feel off or uncomfortable oh if something makes you feel

25:54.880 --> 26:00.480
off or comfortable don't engage with it and in general just don't do the 18 plus content

26:00.480 --> 26:06.400
if you think you might regret it later uh she really said if you're born a slag be a slag

26:08.160 --> 26:16.000
ac oh my god right okay uh you might regret later once it's on the internet it's there forever

26:16.000 --> 26:20.640
i would only advise going into it if it's something you're very passionate about and should enjoy

26:20.640 --> 26:29.280
want to do it long term oh my god ac you're hilarious oh my god right what do you hope to

26:29.280 --> 26:37.760
bring or to change in the v-trip and landscape well we've all seen 3d concerts like the big ones

26:37.760 --> 26:44.640
where people can watch in person it is my dream to achieve something similar but in a form of a

26:44.640 --> 26:52.640
3d 3d dj party with all of the violor oh that's fucking adorable she actually did say this in her

26:52.640 --> 27:00.640
application to us um i'd make for such a cool thing to experience with more interaction dancing

27:00.640 --> 27:06.800
and lots of fun oh she's so cute she put this in her application i really made it stand out because

27:07.680 --> 27:12.480
now if anyone's lurking that just happens to have applied you know there's a lot of reasons

27:12.480 --> 27:17.360
obviously again it was like 64 candidates the one model so it wasn't easy but um

27:18.400 --> 27:26.160
3d dj party madness no no no no no no no every strongy streamer's like i'll have a viola

27:26.160 --> 27:32.480
reading it now um what was this one oh yeah um like some people didn't really have much goals

27:32.480 --> 27:35.920
or aspirations etc they're just like i'm just happy to do my thing and i was like that's good

27:35.920 --> 27:40.720
and all but it was good to have like a someone come in with like a really strong goal like this is

27:40.720 --> 27:46.560
what i want to achieve like she's got something to work towards which is quite nice uh but i say

27:46.560 --> 27:50.400
i'm not finished uh asking you the question so what do you want to represent in the v-tribe

27:50.400 --> 27:56.080
sphere and just for those of us at home how does your voice go in? tarot polar bear from tarot polar bear

27:56.080 --> 28:01.920
it's a bit tough for me to think of that because i don't think there's anything i really represent

28:01.920 --> 28:10.080
besides myself oh you're so humble the closest thing i can think of is to represent is being

28:10.080 --> 28:18.080
yourself the most authentic version of you is the ideal version the right people will see that

28:18.960 --> 28:25.760
in you even if you take some years i had i'm losing it i had many nights where i cry oh

28:25.760 --> 28:31.920
hey so what the fuck i had many nights where i cried or was worried that i'm not it's not going to

28:31.920 --> 28:38.400
happen but it did and now i'm here and i'm the most fulfilled i've ever been yeah after that stream

28:38.400 --> 28:45.840
don't give up yes i see you're very fulfilled right now thanks for that dad as i see you there

28:50.000 --> 28:54.720
what's one thing you want people to remember about you individually or as a generation

28:54.720 --> 29:00.640
i think what i'd like people to remember about us as a generation is that even if we are a

29:00.640 --> 29:13.680
whore all of the girls have a lot of personality they are talented they're sweet they're incredible

29:13.680 --> 29:20.800
people that deserve to achieve their dream and i also think that it'd be sweet and a bit funny

29:20.800 --> 29:30.560
that the corpo with the horse is the one who ended up being the most wholesome and entertaining

29:30.720 --> 29:34.000
what oh my god i see i can't believe you said that i lied

29:35.120 --> 29:42.800
her pushers win honestly v sucky dub honestly okay last question for you i see and then you

29:42.800 --> 29:49.520

30:06.640 --> 30:14.000

30:14.000 --> 30:20.880
significant part for me what the fuck oh it's more like did i skip a sentence it's more like reading

the news and being updated about what's going on in the vitra being world oh icicle that's fantastic

30:27.680 --> 30:31.280

33:46.560 --> 33:55.440

34:37.920 --> 34:43.200
and youtube and patreon prior fucking hell you've got you're stacked out of the wazoo obviously most

34:43.200 --> 34:48.080
of it was just reposting stuff from one platform to the other to reach a brighter audience okay thank

34:48.080 --> 34:54.960
you emmy um but what inspired you to create that kind of content okay what is pl means previous life

34:54.960 --> 35:00.960
so um other kind of personas you might have made content under etc like again when you join

35:00.960 --> 35:07.280
veal or you get a whole new persona given to you eh what made you inspire inspire to make that kind

35:07.280 --> 35:15.920
of content they listened to a lot of blue dot i mean did you actually put on an interview you did

35:16.640 --> 35:23.280
well this is published okay i also consumed a lot of erotic literature so i had a lot of fun

35:23.440 --> 35:28.000
creating my own scripts too okay that's actually the same i never thought i'd actually be creating it

35:28.000 --> 35:33.680
because i naturally sound like the erm actually about t which is the least sexy thing imaginable

35:33.680 --> 35:38.000
but that's where the voice acting comes into play i know i i didn't know you voice acted for

35:38.000 --> 35:44.560
krema sonic heroes so i mean here we are um is there any content you're particularly interested

35:44.560 --> 35:51.760
in making i want to make more art i just have to find the time and energy and some inspiration

35:51.760 --> 35:57.200
you heard your pen pals you heard your big bros gi or some inspiration off you pop

35:58.080 --> 36:02.720
scotch accent brought you here and this stream is all about not being scotch well i'm just reading

36:02.720 --> 36:07.360
their interviews and then i'm like doing my default voice do you have any advice for other

36:07.360 --> 36:12.800
content creators i want to safely navigate the 18 plus field just hide your identity and don't

36:12.800 --> 36:17.920
become close personal friends with the people that consume your content it just gets too dangerous

36:17.920 --> 36:22.720
okay so keep yourself safe please wow you really do sound like krema i know how tempting it is to

36:22.720 --> 36:27.840
get close but you're playing with fire what do you hope to change or bring in the v-tubing

36:27.840 --> 36:33.360
landscape i mean okay i don't really hope to bring or change anything right out here with the goal

36:33.360 --> 36:38.720
to be a transistor to travel with thank god you're so humble that's too much pressure okay i felt

36:38.720 --> 36:46.400
a lot to be honest i just want to make my audience smile laugh and and me you didn't even substitute

36:46.400 --> 36:58.160
the word like put ink oh my god hey me i had no wait i'm like i'm like 90% sure i read over

37:16.960 --> 37:22.080
they could have like silently edited this stuff but they didn't so shout out again to acapella

37:22.080 --> 37:29.040
media for this opportunity um what's one thing you want people to remember you about you and me

37:29.040 --> 37:35.200
individually or as a generation uh like indulges or a generation as a generation oh as a generation

37:35.200 --> 37:39.760

designed correctly at this stage nope you were not no nail polish identified no band aids on the fingers

40:04.160 --> 40:12.080

40:18.640 --> 40:25.440

40:39.040 --> 40:44.480
instead of remaining independent now let's just try one more time up an atom bomb i heard you wanted

40:44.480 --> 40:50.800
to get to know me better while the allure may be uh agency first of its kind in the end i auditioned

40:50.800 --> 40:58.800
due to detail's dream resonating with me there are many factors at play as well i was reaching my

40:58.800 --> 41:04.560

they were and their old fans don't have to go to on hunt i'm a bit of a traditionalist so i still

42:24.880 --> 42:31.520
want to keep it on the down low with veal or the freedom with content creation is more lenient

42:31.520 --> 42:38.240
and i get to play the games i want and everything is more streamlined for more crucial things don't

42:38.240 --> 42:44.480

42:44.480 --> 42:51.520
my ideas are bad or would be a brand risk oh wait no a bad risk that's why management is there oh

42:51.520 --> 42:56.080

in general mercy i used to be an actor i actress whoops i've been unlucky for a lack of better

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
words for a while now i'm probably the most inexperienced of the group as this is my first

43:34.000 --> 43:40.880
time really creating that kind of content to me it's a return to form while still exploring my

43:40.880 --> 43:50.000
more sensual side haha it's been great fun also a roguet i play a roguet yeah oh wow mercy what the

43:50.000 --> 43:58.400

safety you learned in high school and i mean it that's really important i cannot stress enough

44:11.360 --> 44:17.920
about how important it is to do your new diligence to keep yourself safe also if you do want to do

44:17.920 --> 44:25.280
some if you don't want to do something say no yes that is very true please bring up any issues with

44:25.280 --> 44:31.440
any things you might not want to do in an audio with us and make you finding his central side

44:31.440 --> 44:37.680
children what do you hope to bring or change in the vtube and landscape mercy i hope feel or shows

44:37.680 --> 44:45.360
that we are just like any other vtuber agency just with spicier content on the side that content is

44:45.360 --> 44:51.680
by choice and if you want to interact with it i hope the taboo of being a not safe or vtuber goes

44:51.680 --> 44:58.560
away because in the end like all other vtubers we just want to make you smile and entertain you

44:59.120 --> 45:03.520

45:11.440 --> 45:17.840
anything is there any alt content you're particularly interested in making in mercy mouse

45:17.840 --> 45:24.640
mercy mouse i'm still discovering what i like and don't like so i'm exploring all facets of the

45:24.640 --> 45:31.760
alternative content i'd like to try experimenting with the medium a little more but we're all we're

45:31.760 --> 45:40.080
still in the beginning stages so taking it slow is okay okay but what do you want to represent

45:40.080 --> 45:46.560
in the vtuber sphere mercy let us know let us know your thoughts this is a thought-provoking

45:46.560 --> 45:53.840
question i suppose that i want to be at least someone who is seen as safe to work with even

45:53.840 --> 46:02.000
though i make that kind of content as well i it doesn't define me and means i'm some what

46:02.720 --> 46:09.040
it doesn't define me and means i'm some sort of rabid animal that cannot control my urges hot

46:09.040 --> 46:13.840
i've losing it i'm actually going schizophrenic right now it was one thing that you want people

46:13.840 --> 46:20.880

46:40.160 --> 46:48.320
vtuber history uh to you as a whole i suppose that the debut of hololive english really brought

46:48.400 --> 46:54.000
out about the forefront of vtuber into an international audience as a whole it's no longer

46:54.000 --> 47:00.160
a medium that is pretty niche it's becoming more and more acceptable i agree with that there was

47:00.160 --> 47:06.720
very interesting discourse discord discourse around a year ago that was like vtuber's dying

47:06.720 --> 47:11.120
i don't know if people still say that but i don't think people under oh my hands just farted if you

47:11.920 --> 47:18.400

49:20.720 --> 49:28.800
the misprint oops um that's my bad my bad chief um via lures the first oh wait that's the question

49:28.800 --> 49:33.040
asked me asking it to her via lures the first agency of this kind she be why did you choose it

49:33.040 --> 49:40.080
instead of being an independent as you twerk it's nice having the freedom of being an independent

49:40.080 --> 49:47.280
reach over but i longed for a group of people that i could see as sisters and have a a consistent

49:47.360 --> 49:54.240
collab partners with similar likes i'd also follow the roadmap of via lures for over a year

49:54.240 --> 49:59.680
and shared a lot of the same aspirations as the creative mind behind it all strut stop you're

49:59.680 --> 50:06.240
making me blush the fuck the fuck you're making me blush what the heck i also wanted to grow as a

50:06.240 --> 50:11.920
creator and learn more about the industry and i couldn't do that without a little bit of help

50:12.560 --> 50:19.520
now i have the resources amazing gen mates new knowledge and still manage to have talent freedom

50:19.520 --> 50:24.000
i'll stop it you're blowing art you're blowing air up my arse like that i'm gonna get an eagle

50:24.000 --> 50:30.240
stroke could these girls have stroke the agency anymore i didn't even direct them they did this

50:30.240 --> 50:38.720
themselves okay how in she be was reading the question to herself because uh because good dogs

50:38.720 --> 50:43.920
don't speak hey whoa i'm a dog what's going on here are you starting to insinuate so your

50:43.920 --> 50:49.280
sponsor ash that's that's how that's how i do a prompt get into the voice okay how important

50:49.280 --> 50:57.280
was the amount of freedom on content creation being open to pl etc for you i was ash who twerk i was

50:57.280 --> 51:04.560
extremely attracted to the fact that feel lower broke a lot of standard reach over roles but pl

51:04.560 --> 51:11.120
discussion wasn't a deal breaker for me also if i went in to sign the contract and felt like my

51:11.120 --> 51:19.120
rights as a creator were being taken away um in any fashion i would never have signed on yeah

51:19.120 --> 51:25.520
they all say that it's the most pathetic contract i've ever seen uh no matter the agency i do have

51:25.520 --> 51:32.800
to say ash out of professionalism i still double checked with my management to ask permissions

51:32.800 --> 51:36.480
because it's always good to make sure i mean that's pretty much melted away at this point that was

51:36.480 --> 51:40.560
probably right at the start when the girls were unsure how much they're allowed to do

51:40.560 --> 51:46.560
but i had to keep reminding the girls like hey you don't need permission go go don't need permission

51:46.560 --> 51:52.560
go there can i tweet this go send it as long as it's on the right twitter account send it you

51:52.560 --> 51:57.120
don't need permission but this was written a bit earlier so some of the stuff is about me

51:58.080 --> 52:02.960
how can you not stroke the agency when instead of working for the agency the agency works for them

52:03.520 --> 52:10.160
honestly sorry my glakes have got a fucking me mark on them right ash from pallet time come on

52:10.160 --> 52:15.280
no no no ash uh jesse from pokemon come on i can do this i can do this okay and then no more accents

52:15.280 --> 52:23.920
okay um ash would work it's really refreshing however to still feel like an indie you'd have

52:23.920 --> 52:29.840
a team that has my back and supports me with whatever creative endeavor i've put my silly mind

52:29.840 --> 52:36.720
to oh she be stop it my little sheepster's room oh sorry i'm covering up chat sorry sorry sorry chat

52:36.720 --> 52:44.000
sorry i'm dumb oh hold on a bit uh what platforms did you want to make content prior to join

52:44.000 --> 52:49.600
in v alert so when you were just doing your thing i was always the casual twitch streamer oh not

52:49.600 --> 52:56.080
twitch andy and i hoped someday i could go full time adjusting to youtube has been interesting

52:56.080 --> 53:03.440
but i don't mind it it's probably funny for me to say but i was never going to do anything

53:03.440 --> 53:13.200
my pl like i'm doing now what's that corruption arc yeah you're welcome ash i wasn't going to

53:13.200 --> 53:20.080
make a patreon or even consider fansly i see this reincarnation and my previous version of myself

53:20.080 --> 53:29.360
as almost two sides of the same coin i can be your angel or your devil it's very cool to learn how

53:29.360 --> 53:35.840
other platforms function and how you can develop and expand your audience alongside your main platform

53:36.720 --> 53:44.480
oh wait did she see the angle oh my god is that why it was spelled weird i can be your angle or your

53:44.480 --> 53:49.360
devil bro i thought i was like why the f*** did she spell it like that but everything else was

53:49.360 --> 53:56.720
spelled correctly my dumb ass didn't read it right uh so she stares what inspired just make that kind

53:56.720 --> 54:01.280
of content or that content in general just content in general okay it is the meme it's definitely the

54:02.000 --> 54:07.680
i can be your angel or your devil uh i've always wanted to be a content creator since

54:07.680 --> 54:15.200
watching youtubers like jenna marbles markiplier i'm not even saying that i wanted to have the same

54:15.200 --> 54:21.680
positive effect on viewers that watching my favorite content creator had on me and still do

54:22.480 --> 54:29.760
as for the erotic content i've always been indifferent about it i have dabbled extremely

54:29.760 --> 54:37.760
briefly in the past in the raw and erotic content what it really got nowhere so i never

54:37.760 --> 54:43.200
continued with it ash and now i have to learn and improve from the best of the best i'm not

54:45.760 --> 54:50.000
uh is there any other content you're particularly interested in making

54:51.280 --> 54:55.520
i'm not saying that name though i'm not saying the name of the content creator because i just know

54:56.160 --> 55:02.160

i can't do it naturally and what do you hope to bring or change in v tubing landscape i hope that

57:48.880 --> 57:54.880
companies consider the transparency of our splits and make adjustments accordingly in favor of the

57:54.880 --> 58:02.640
talents if they have the profit v tubing is an ever-growing industry and towns deserve a bit more

58:02.640 --> 58:08.080

about you sheepsters individually or as a generation of dealer as a company we're breaking the status

58:23.600 --> 58:31.520
quo of what it means to be a corporate vtuber you can allow and manage alternative content

58:31.520 --> 58:38.080
you can talk about your pl if you want and you can have a human relationship with your talents

58:38.080 --> 58:47.600
instead of treating them like far oh oh tell her is she be like fodder and still be a successful

58:47.600 --> 59:08.720
company as a generation a group of girls that just want to have a group of girls that just

59:08.720 --> 59:14.720
want to have fun make you happy and we appeal to all if not many in some way shape or form

59:14.720 --> 59:24.560
and then you can hire unknown oh that's so cute and and sorry and that you can hire unknown talent

59:24.560 --> 59:34.240
there's a few gems out there oh my god i'm gonna agree a few of us were complete nobodies but

59:34.240 --> 59:43.440
someone saw our potential no it gave us a chance what the fuck i'm saying no that's so sweet i'm

59:43.440 --> 59:53.680
thankful for that as myself your favorite girl failure scuff dorky scuff dorky dog always root

model i'm looking a bit funny i'm looking a bit skew if okay there we go recalibrate oh

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:12.400
oh blow and smoke up your butt is supposed to be our job literally let me repeat that last

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.840
bit uh you can hire unknown talent there's a few gems no there's lots of gems out there it just

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:25.440
ain't easy the problem it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy unhidden gem thinks

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.240
they're not good enough to apply to vtuber agency don't apply don't get shown off type thing

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.680
it really can be as simple as that there's like a lot of like i remember we got emailed on the

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:45.120
website after closing applications and someone was like i'm so sorry i've missed the window because

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.240
i didn't feel like worthy enough to apply and it was like bro you missed your deadline if we can't

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.800
we can't make exceptions but it's like don't hold yourself back seriously the talent pool is massive

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.200
it is like it's beyond comprehension how many little hidden gems are out there and they just

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.160
need a running start they just need like that exposure they need someone you know with the money

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.920
that can be like okay here's shorts right upload them right here's a bit of advertisement money

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.520
in this here's in that yeah it's a self-propagating issue where the lack of confidence is your work

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:24.400
yeah the imposter syndrome yeah and fear of rejection as well as absolutely humongous barrier

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.200
for some people it really is um you know i'm not gonna sit here and be like oh i don't experience

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:36.000
that so i'm not gonna you know be say xyz about it um it is this is a big thing anyway uh sorry

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.640
she be to ramble over it's fine um thank you uh what do you want to represent in the vtuber

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:48.240
and spear sheepsters um i think i've represented in my content enough already oh man oh we love

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.400
a confident dump but that you can still make 18 plus content and still be a normal streamer on

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.200
common part horrors some have the idea that lute tubers are coomed brain 24 7 and flick their

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:08.080
beads on stream and do nothing else haha wait wait would that be like a milk laugh i got uh

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:58.800
okay as they're an event in v tripping history that is significant to you my dear sheepsters

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:06.400
yes or no the creation of project melody a melody was the catalyst in my opinion of the boom of

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.320
lute tubers she pushed the boundaries of 18 plus content but still displayed herself as a cute and

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:19.520
talented streamer a normal human being but also a friendly vtuber with a unique approach to 3d

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:26.960
i can safely say she is a pioneer in not only on say so content creation but audience interaction

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:36.160
and streaming and in general thanks thank you melody fantastic thank you so much sheebie

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:46.240
for your fantastic okay um right i'm gonna thank you i'm gonna let you go rest because you

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.600
don't have a stream today question mark i really need to download everyone's things all at once so i

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.840
can start pulling up and be like right who this is who's coming on the day thank you so much sheepsters

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.280
up next who we got

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.120
right i'm interviewing myself let's go right let's go let's go let's get hype hype man look at that

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.320
look at that design so my design was actually finalized at this stage um kind of as you can

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.120
see i've got pearlescent if you didn't know i shimmer i don't actually have white on my outfit

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:29.200
i'm pearlescent check out wait hold on check out this oh hold on that's my stream deck oh hold on

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:39.760
that's the wrong one see i'm all wiggly and pearly essencey okay that's what i look like

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.680
but i'm scrawny cut oh it's a hypnotic cut of fish that has been streaming for a month and has

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.160
yet to put out one piece of hypno content other than a live stream uh and i did it for like 40

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:59.120
minutes and never did it any longer so obviously the first question did not apply to me vealour is

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:05.920
the first agency why did you choose it nope man man's was pre-selected so that question does not

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:12.880
apply to me so i had to get creative and give myself an alternative question and i've already

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:19.040
lost the damn magazine hold on i have found the magazine okay how did you attract independent

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.920
v-tubers to vealour is the only question substituted for me okay so first getting our name out there

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:33.440
was a challenge but we got incredibly lucky on youtube and the algorithm tapped into the reveal

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:42.640
trailer the announcement of vealours all the way back at new years is just shy of 100 000 views on

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:47.440
youtube okay and i'm going to discuss that in a short because there's a reason why i got picked up

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:56.160
in the algorithm then the vealour website stated what we wanted i cooked on that website okay i set

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.000
it straight up i said this is the cut this is the expectations there was no oh i don't know what i'm

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.560
signing up for oh i don't know i don't know no we set it off the bat so the people that did apply

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.360
knew what they were getting into okay so there really wasn't a struggle like as i said the talent

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:20.160
pool was pretty big considering new vtuber agency founding members uh quite a few different rules

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:26.720
most vtuber agencies are like eh you didn't have to make content prior to applying yeah they shove

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.960
your shit in the bin if you don't have any evidence so okay and yet there's people still asking

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:41.680
questions honestly that's not i'm wearing marathon runners why yes of course you don't sound like strawny

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.760
how dare you what you want to make my accent harsher okay so how important was the amount of freedom

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:56.080
content discussing pls etc although i confess it's not traditional and may lead to a few people not

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.920
enjoying what vealour have to offer he'll offer probably i'm no here to pretend that gen one

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:08.720
indulges made up of people who have never streamed before is this what you want yeah actually all of

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.320
the girls had more streaming experience than me this is true so it was quite funny going through

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:20.240
applications in that sense it was rather humorous it was humorous okay uh thank you strawny for the

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:27.200
next question what platform did you want to make content prior to vealour right youtube has always

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.000
been a staple for many eyes and i have found overall that their rules are mostly fair bad the

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.800
bloody uh this this age terribly this age terribly we all have warnings for breathing in an ear

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:49.920
anyway twitch however seems to have issues with using rules to punish some but not others it is

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:58.560
more of a pick the lesser of two evil situation twitter or x is much more for an overall promotion

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:06.480
and connecting with other vtubers for collaborations i'm afraid personally i'm just no suited for

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:13.040
twitter outside of that and i'm just i'm shy on twitter what inspired you to create alternative

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:22.720
content or content in general i never personally okay had any issues where it's just another media

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:29.680
source you either wish to consume it and seek it out or you just deny at all i suppose in my case

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.480
due to how comfortable i am where i find it quite fascinating to learn about what people enjoy and

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.320
challenge myself to give them what they want and that's true i like i like when you guys tell me

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.480
something outrageous and i'm like bet all right let's do it let's do it let's do it we need a scotland

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.360
forever okay i'll make scrawny say scotland forever at the end of the interview okay um

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:59.680
is there any content you're particularly interested in making it in the all alternative version

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:06.720
i have always had a secret fascination about hypnosis but i am well aware of the safety concerns

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:15.040
that come first it is with this new breath of life that the allure has offered me that i can finally

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.840
go down this rabbit hole and see what happens this is actually true um i've always enjoyed hypnosis

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.440
but being absolutely terrified to make it do you have any advice for people who might want to come

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:35.760
into safely creating a content of an alternate variety delete everything related to your legal

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:46.560
name and social media under it that is rule one okay chase louise from there be on the side of caution

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.680
now sadly you are an adult and you are responsible for your actions no matter how foolish they may

01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:01.040
have been in the moment please do not think however you will be the only numpty on planet earth

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:08.560
to make a mistake that is only natural so do not be harsh on yourself you will say and do stupid

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:15.840
things that is life okay relax no that's serious all right okay thank you started streaming 69 minutes

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:25.520
ago i am oh yeah what do you hope to bring to or change in the vtubing landscape on the surface

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:32.800
on the surface the answer would be that the western vtuber agencies are those agencies

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:40.560
that wish to appeal to these western agencies also understand that comes with culture changes

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.800
for example more freedoms of course the scottish person says more freedoms you can take my life

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:59.120
but i can't take my freedom honestly most freedoms less restrictions as a whole on vtuber agencies

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:07.120
stop being greedy gifts and pay your talents what they earned you did not earn that wake up

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:13.200
you didn't earn it you weren't the one streaming you weren't the one putting the hours in pay your

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:19.920
talents higher than 50 percent that's all i'm fucking asking stop doing less than 50 percent

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:28.560
it's disgusting thank you anyway that's me um anyway now that i've passed that along uh oh you

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:35.360
got a bit passionate there strony i do apologize okay okay let's go next um what's one thing that

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:42.800
you want people to remember about you individually or a generation individually it is uh is to be

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:51.280
yourself unironically and unapologetically as a generation well who better to indulge in than us

01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:02.480
oh thank you get it because our uh our gen name is indulge oh oh sorry was i not to explain it

saying to that sorry okay uh that you didn't have to know everything to be accepted by the vtubing

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.840
community i could have easily have been chewed up and spat back out but instead was welcomed with

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.600
open arms for my curiosity and wanting to learn more it has led to various uh humorous moments

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:20.400
such as tisker which is short for tisker it now is being called tisker in my community because

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.560
i didn't know what it meant and again i didn't know what that so meant and you guys were just so

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.480
nice and taught me everything um and i think it's because like you know you can uh yeah did you

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.960
take yeah and fucking okay you're done i still say tisker though literally tisker mentioned any

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:47.120
tisker yeah um we say instead of tisker or tskr tisker um is there any significant event in vtubing

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:55.120
that is incredibly important to you um the uprising of creator-owned vtuber agencies is upon us now

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.760
okay um socks agencies a fantastic example yumi plus i think is technically an example

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.200
um having someone at the helm that has had experience of what and knows what it's like

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:15.840
um to produce content and uh knows what to expect is very exciting i can't wait to see more agencies

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.480
come out that are like that and you never know viola might just collaborate with them i sure it is

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:31.760
i hope you're okay yes we are uh it should wink wink but yes um i think creator-owned vtuber

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.280
agencies are fantastic because they're realistic and like they know what's up they're like i've

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.280
made content before i know what like kind of strange you're under um kind of like is a split

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:50.400
hollow live collab no what i don't have you think i have contacts for hollow live the fuck

marshmallows um i am going to be reading them off my monitor i'm not gonna have them displayed

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:54.400
what was the removed mercy line if you're at liberty to say um she said something about

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.680
self-deprecating and it was a bit it was a bit on the severe side so i rephrased the sentence

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.520
to be nicer to herself um she used a phrase that wasn't very friendly but uh i'm not gonna say the

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.920
exact phrase because that's not very nice but uh yeah i think she'll i'm i'm sure she'll be fine

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:22.400
with it um wait what top bottom switch views are bosoms bosoms female female male male male female

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.960

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.760

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:43.600
uh moment i love you replaying i love you did you like me doing all the impressions it's a very

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:58.560
deep question what are oh hold on right hold on hold on what are some ways companies can

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:06.400
companies set up right whoever sent this question one using spell check and two i can't read properly

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:12.800
what are some ways companies can set up stuff so the company itself can protect their talents

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:21.840
fun set aside for legal concerns taxes content eight screenshots platform liaisons

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:28.960
anti anti stuff teaching the ropes um i think just being realistic like if you have been a

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.320
content creator and then you're behind the scenes you know what the girls are up against like um

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.040
obviously we shut down the marshmallows for quite a bit because like a few of the talents

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:47.120
were having issues and like i guess that was like a measure to basically we took on we got the girls

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.760
feedback and we were like nah forget this you're done so um and we were like right everyone off

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.520
marshmallow right now don't reply don't do nothing we're fucked up we made a mistake

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.040
sure do love when the xbox servers are done have the servers down

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.960
okay if another idiot comes up with mirrors i'm gonna play doom in real nah

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.200
ah barely audible oh did i do a tiny little burp there i wasn't paying attention

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:19.040
um taxes again don't actually spend the money until you paid the tax you should always hold 30

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.920
percent back uh i guess if you want tax uh content aid so uh that's like collaborations with people

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:33.280
outside of the agency um that's like putting advertisement money in shorts for example so

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:40.320
we do something that i don't think any other agency really offers we pay for the shorts to be made

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.080
for the talents we make the thumbnails for them their schedules all that we try and give them at

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.640
least stuff possible they're obviously the only overwhelming problem is like i took a while to

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:58.320
find the editors and get settled with the editors like um a few of them couldn't do it a few of them

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.720
uh now currently have ongoing in real life obligations which caused a massive backlog

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:12.880
like that's why irisa is my personal clipper because um i was just having so many issues

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:18.640
and at the rate the shorts were being made it was like at one point one person was making all the

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:26.480
shorts and it was like no that's just not viable at all um but azura is next to get shorts and

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.200
then shebe's getting a batch and then i think by that point we will have four people who can make

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.160
clips on at the same time but a lot of in real life stuff happened in their lives which caused a

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.720
massive backlog and it's caused an issue because i would have wanted a lot more shorts out by now

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.360
i don't know for me it's a respect thing there are people at least try to treat them as proper

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:52.880
human beings and not circus freaks uh communication is key um what are you saying

01:24:53.680 --> 01:25:00.640

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.640
easter egg in emi's interview she used the phrase keep yourself safe kiss your sister where

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.640
keep yourself safe

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.920

uh what she meant like genuinely keep yourself safe i don't actually think that's an easter egg

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.040
because she said please if it was an easter egg it would be keep yourself safe

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.760
no i think she may or may not have actually actually i don't think that's an easter egg

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.880
this month was fantastic thank you for everything you did and that you're doing

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.840
seeing how excited and happy you are makes me feel so good and honestly inspires me oh yeah

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:52.720
can you say how can you keep up with everything i think i would die in two seconds um so

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.760
i basically don't experience what people explain burnout to be

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.720
and the reason i don't experience it is thanks to autism i don't know how i got lucky with that

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:08.400
kind of autism but i did um i basically now don't get me wrong i can get frustrated and fatigued

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.720
but when i go to bed and then when i wake up it's like a fresh new day like let's go again

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:20.720
and one of the best things that i am able to do is i say to myself as long as i do one thing a day

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.680
so after i finish stream i say to myself i'll do one thing a day if that's editing an audio

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:31.280
collab if that's you know writing a script collab or something like that um as long as i do that

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:37.280
then you know we're on the up and up that's all i need to do um just one thing a day um maybe i can

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.680
impart that wisdom to you with that phrase and just say one thing a day doesn't matter how big

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:47.040
or small it is like if you are a bed rotting max or that one thing a day can literally be brushing

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.360
your teeth and then roll back in a bed one thing a day that's it all you got to do one thing a day

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:59.280
um that's uh the reason why i can do it to end others might not be able to

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:06.160
uh can we send save for work bibbutes on marshmallow yeah how does catbox work also

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.880
um it's like a website you put your link in it and then you send me the link here

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:00.480
wisdom mythic pool honestly mythic pool not to some combination honestly um depression max and

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.000
yeah if you're depression max and you're one thing a day literally make your bed brush your

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.880

no timestamp no one's found it yet i'm just starting i want to know

01:48:54.160 --> 01:49:00.640
where would you like to time travel the past or the future unfortunately i'm a woman so the past

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:04.960
probably isn't that good but the future seems pretty gloom so i'll stick right here in this timeline

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:12.560
uh uh you know born too late to see something born too early to see the future born in the same

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:21.440
timeline the strony calls a hungry jacks or mackers uh i get the absolute a screaming

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.760
shite so if i get mackers for some reason so hungry jacks it is for some reason mcdonald's

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:36.240
uh breakfast i can eat but if i eat anything else off the menu it makes me have a lava flow

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.120
yeah rip

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.680
this is the best time future means i get to see all strone's vids but i won't be able to join the

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:52.560
streams oh that's like really sad though gregs is oh gregs is bad don't say such things reflings

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.200
next time you go to gregs you order cheese and hamburger well you don't order it you pick up from

01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:04.160
the west side bit um and then you get uh sausage and cheese and bean pastry and you get the apple

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.920
juice that's what i used to get from gregs i don't like any other their bakery stuff like the sweet

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.520
stuff it's always rubbish we die on this hill no i don't i don't like the grill i like the sausage

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:23.520
and beans i really like beans though beans what is the wildest fantasy you've ever had um so there's

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:30.320
this concept called the asmr booth and it's it's growing arms legs it has hair it's probably got

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:38.160
brain cells at this point um basically i get to tingle you in person and put a mask on you and

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:44.640
like uh the joke is like you buy the premium pass at like a convention and then like i put you in the

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.200
soundproof booth with me and then things get out of hand really quickly okay um i've already wrote

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:57.280

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.400

01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:01.440
uh what is the most embarrassing moment in all your childhood a projectile vomited in public

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:05.680
but it actually humbled me to the point where like i don't feel embarrassed going in public

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:13.920
like about anything if you have ever been so humbled to projectile vomit right with no privacy

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:21.280
then uh yeah it turns out you don't really get scared of going outside have i ever been arrested

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:27.920
oh just because i'm scotish i and i didn't sound posh you think i've been arrested and in trouble

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:35.920
with the polis well i don't know i've never been arrested uh but the polis are right arseholes

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:41.440
honestly um hello what's going on we're doing what's called a q&a on marshmallow and you can

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:47.520
ask anonymous questions hitting the bed hitting a bit what hitting a bed yen is something like

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:56.000
that would be a yes no i've been arrested are you joking uh can you give chat a smooch a smooch

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:04.400
pack her up did you like that

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:15.120
have the talents discussed uh in uh alternative collab audios yes uh next month is when the

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:21.360
first alternative collabs come out um it is a tip please understand that some of the girls have

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:27.920
only just started doing solo audios so to already jump into a collab audio is quite a high stretch

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.160
so please don't be weird and like this is so disappointing you think that's gonna be the only

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:41.600
one they'll ever make please i'm gonna i'm gonna throw up an anger shadow box and over here okay

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:49.200
rip i'm on speakers i'm so sorry please lower your volume of me that was uncalled for i think my

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:55.040
heart beat went up all of a sudden why is it that round pizzas come in square boxes for transport

01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:02.560
mains um if you have a square box sitting on a car seat for example um it is more likely to stay

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.440
put and stay steady so transport much easier yes yes but if it was a circle imagine that thing rolling

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.720
around in the back seat get in that thing would be trashed by the time it got delivered um or you

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.880
took it back home if you go and pick up your what the fuck is that noise oh it's my chair sorry my

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:08.560
stimuli to tell you what to do next but basically you need to actually this is one of the really

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:16.800
big tips if you want to work hard and get a lot of stuff done okay um do you is you need to feel

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:21.920
your body this sounds ridiculous but it's true if you're using your brain and you're thinking and

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:28.000
your strategic doing strategies and all that you genuinely need to feel your brain in order to do

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.240
all these things it is not possible without eating so don't starve yourself don't forget to eat it is

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:32.960
you to enjoy while sending tiggy also sorry for being forward uh um i don't i don't know how to

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:40.960
even censor that word uh unique merchandise uh that violor might get uh in the future um once

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:46.480
all the girls hit 10 000 subscribers i'm going to contact a company and see if they will entertain

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:56.720
it the problem with trying to get uh a collaboration is they need we need to provide evidence of sales

02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:04.240
for them to even bother with what we're gonna ask for so i'm gonna wait until we're all 10 000

02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:10.240
subscribers i don't know if we're gonna get a shared one that might be the only way where all

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:20.560
our faces are on the same package um but if we do get it the girls will be releasing a free public

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:28.080
audio that would complement this unique merchandise we may or may not get

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:37.520
uh but you will be eating good either way okay a shared one for sharing well no really but yeah

02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:43.280
they need to see a potential return yes so i think it's a bit too premature for lack of better words

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:52.560
to contact the company um but yes if uh don't be shy to subscribe to the other girls as well

02:10:52.560 --> 02:11:01.680
not just me uh because everyone this is a a rising tide no a high tide rises all ships or whatever

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:08.800
