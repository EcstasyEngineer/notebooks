1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hey?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,700
I'm a dreamer even though we're a kitty cat.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,480
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,400
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
And I meow, meow, meow.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,500
And I meow, meow, meow.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,180
Cat, I'm a kitty cat, and I dance, dance, dance.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,580
And I dance, dance, dance.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,320
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,620
Cat, I'm a kitty cat.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,620
You guys remember that hit viral YouTube video where the song goes

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,620
I'm a cat, me and I'm a kitty cat

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,120
And I dance and dance and dance and dance and dance

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
Yeah, well I remember anyway

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't know if it might be better for me to play games like in the middle of the screen

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,120
I feel like I'll always cover up something important over here

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,620
But then I end up getting really tiny, but then if I'm here, it's like well

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,620
At least I can show my face

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,620
I can't feel my face when I'm open

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,620
Heart or heart?

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,620
Okay, let me explain the hearts

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,620
I did a bit of, did a bit of work, yeah

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,620
Did a bit of work

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,620
So you may notice

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
Good morning

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,620
Good evening

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,620
Or good afternoon

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,620
I'm your host

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,620
Strony Cuttos

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,620
Let's get right into the updates

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,620
Which is hardly any, there's not that much interesting stuff

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,620
If you are a member of any viewer member, you may notice that there's hearts

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,620
What do the hearts mean?

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,620
The hearts are placeholders for where emotes are going to go

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,620
YouTube is slightly, slightly

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,620
A little bit, dare I say, a bit based

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,620
You cannot lose an emotes slot if you bagzian, okay

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,620
I'm gonna hope that bagzian is a terminology

39
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Used by anyone else outside of Scotland

40
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,620
But bagzian means it is reserved, if you will

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,620
My new favourite emotes just dropped, okay

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,620
Can we keep one heart or moe?

43
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,620
Although I think me holding the heart and moe is better than just an emote

44
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Bro, I can't even fucking png them

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,620
But anyway, if you are a member of any girls channel, you will notice that there's moe slots

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,620
And depending on how many hearts you see is how many slots unlocked

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,620
AC for example is the first girl to receive her batch

48
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,620
So hers is already up

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,620
Emmys is the next to receive her batch

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,620
There was a bit of a miscommunication error

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,620
And by miscommunication error, they just randomly didn't draw one of the emotes we requested

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,620
And drew one of the emotes we already, like redrew one of the emotes we already had

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,620
And they were like, here's your delivery

54
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,620
And I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not what my little sister wanted

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,620
And that has to be, I'm glad she caught it actually

56
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,620
I sent it to Emmys and I was like, how does it look?

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Are you happy with it?

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,620
And she's like, strongy, there's an entire emote missing

59
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,620
And one we didn't ask for, and I'm like, you know what Emmys?

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,620
Even though you have negative 5 prescription, you've got some bloody good eyes on you sometimes for spotting

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Eh, oh did you hear my caller?

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Hi, hi, hello, hello

63
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
I can't go anywhere

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Um, updates

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,620
There's a new AC short, there's a new short on my channel

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
There's a new short on Mercy's channel

67
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Um, Azura's got 4 shorts that have been ordered

68
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,620
One of them is absolutely outrageous and hilarious

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Um, I had to get a serial box commissioned for it

70
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,620
It was that funny

71
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Um, so hopefully when that comes out, I'll send Azura's way

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,620
Cause Purser and Sheebie haven't had any shorts love

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,620
But finally, the shorts are working out and you know, people are ready to work on them

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Oh Anonymous tipped me, hold on a minute, we have missed your tipped Anonymous

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Give us the tip

76
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,620
Are you squiddin' me right now?

77
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,620
Thank you for giving us so many streams to share with you

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,620
Some of us are less active, but no less appreciative of how much you do

79
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Ah, don't you worry, you bumberino, gibberino, schnibberino, woobberino

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Anonymous, you don't have to fucking look

81
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,620
I know it's not easy to keep up with me every single day, you know

82
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,620
For mummies got endurance, the way we like it around here, okay?

83
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Thank you very much for the tip, that's very kind of you

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,620
And yes, I'm glad you can enjoy the daily content

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Speaking of daily content, uh...

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,620
We're still on for daily streams, that's the good news

87
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,620
We're having a few health issues, okay?

88
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,620
So currently, oh I just realized I'm linking the ACSR

89
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,620
We're currently having some mild issues with health

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,620
That is, I basically, I go for a nap for four hours when I finish a stream

91
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,620
And then four hours before a stream, I'm having a nap, I'm not having a full sleep

92
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,620
And I had a dream about a VTuber that I haven't even met and don't exist before

93
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,620
So the lines are getting crossed, I'm fucking dreaming about VTubers

94
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,620
That aren't even real!

95
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,620
I'm gonna start fighting real sh- I'm doing Shadow Boxing for real

96
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,620
In my head, in my head, in my head

97
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Is it Army? Army, Army

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,620
I don't know what that song is

99
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,620
So I'm starting to hallucinate a wee bit

100
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Not quite at the hallucinatory stage, however

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,620
I am really struggling to wake up for streams

102
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,620
But my only other alternative option

103
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,620
Oh is it Zombie? No, what did I say? Army

104
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Zombie, in my head, in my head

105
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Zombie, zombie

106
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
Anyway, whilst I'm being distracted

107
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
We're playing a game called Stray

108
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Apparently it takes five hours to do this game

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,620
Everyone went absolutely coconuts when this game dropped

110
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
I personally have not played it before

111
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
But it's got cats in it

112
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
And you know how we do around these parts

113
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,620
If you didn't know, Wham and Love It

114
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,620
When men like creatures or lesser beings

115
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,620
Because it shows that man is safe

116
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,620
If man does not like creature or lesser being

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Man is not safe

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Hmm, Monca es

119
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,620
But apparently we get to be a yin-yor cat

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,620
As well, not just any kind of cat, a yin-yor

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Five hours if you're quick

122
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
Oh no

123
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Oh my god

124
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
Why are we so skinny?

125
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
We need to fatten us up

126
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Where's your primordial pouch?

127
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,620
Oh my god

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
Hello

129
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Oh actually, I'm ginger

130
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
Wait, whoa, that camera's a bit...

131
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh my god, Mia

132
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
Do you jump?

133
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,620
Jump

134
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
No

135
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
Oh no

136
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Hello

137
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
Oh my god

138
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
It's Chateau Noir

139
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,620
Bonjour Chateau Noir

140
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Hello

141
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Oh, I'm the submissive cat

142
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Do you know why?

143
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
Because I got licked on the face

144
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,620
So I'm the submissive putter

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Okay, ginger is the submissive

146
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Hey, but you're a mix

147
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,620
You're a calico-colo-colo-lolo cat

148
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, we're all playing

149
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Yeah, we buddy

150
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,620
Oh, we're getting a little scent marking

151
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
On that one

152
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Hello

153
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,620
Oh my god

154
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh, I'm the submissive one

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
Out of all of them

156
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
I guess the runt is a litter

157
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
That's okay

158
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Oh my god, are we going to sleep as a family?

159
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,620
Oh, can I come join?

160
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Oh my god, we can sleep together as a family

161
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Oh my god

162
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
I loved this game already

163
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Cat-fine box, sitting box

164
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Yeah

165
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,620
But yes, the love hearts are going to get swapped out

166
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Oh, look at Mia, old ginger and stuff

167
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
I'm ginger tabby

168
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
Aw, yeah, look at my ginger tabby

169
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,620
It's a booty fly

170
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Oh, we're flicking her ear

171
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
That's so cute

172
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Tell me if the game is a bit too loud, okay?

173
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Because you know me, terrible for balancing my voice

174
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
And then in-game audio

175
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Oh, let me sip my tea

176
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Remember that time I read out everyone's interview

177
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,620
On acapella media in a magazine

178
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620

Like a little zerk from a far away. Oh, is the zerk the enemies?

718
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,320
Uh, you're not an input site. Where is the input code section?

719
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000

Okay, someone put the code in chat. Thank goodness. Where are they? Remember

722
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,360
Do they really consume this their original design doesn't have a digestive tract

723
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,480
Maybe they somehow evolved to mimic humans. Do they think I should try some of it? I don't want to be disrespectful of them

724
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
So you eat

725
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,480

00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,000
Right, let's go treat the wire person because apparently stealing it's more like borrowing

800
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
than actually stealing

801
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,040
Because look we're getting an item out of it inspect the electrical cables. What do you want? Uh, I set uh, yep

804
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,640
I don't know if that's just a memory unlock. It doesn't really seem like I need it

805
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
So you're the borrower type

806
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,840

01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
Okay, well that answer that question then

844
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,840
RIP humans. Okay humans were the first residents around here. It seems that they're all passed away

845
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:54,400
What do you think it feels like being dead? I know it's silly coming from me

846
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,000
But are they actually at peace? Well, I'd be at peace when I die. I don't know what death feels like for an AI

847
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,080
I'm sorry. I don't want to break the myth. Let's go. No, you're allowed to inquire about things

848
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,640
What are you on about?

849
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,880
You know what you're allowed to ask questions. Hi buddy. Do you need a jacket?

850
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,440
Hello, no, you don't want to talk to me

851
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
I guess not

852
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,600
Do you need a jacket? No, you're the shopkeeper. That's region. I don't think a jacket would make me feel better

853
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,080
Who needs a jacket?

854
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,080
Hi, are you still mad?

855
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Okay, you believe it man

856
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,160

857
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,040

858
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,280

Uh

868
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:31,680

869
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,760
Is there a monk that's missing a jacket? No, you guys are all

870
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,120

Hmm

875
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:03,840
Do you guys don't want a jacket? I'm guessing you don't want one either. Look at the hidden gems in the trash pennies from heaven or somewhere anyway

876
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,320
Okay

There's a clown coming out of the yo-yo

01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,120
What is this information the tree is a scientific marvel

906
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,280
It's remarkable that human ingenuity

907
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,280
Found a way to create plants that thrive out sunlight organic life requires trees to purify to set you there

908
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,200
We both don't need it, but they take care of them anyway. It's what the humans would have wanted. Oh

909
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,760

Hey mom, it's dusk here and I might pass out. You you're allowed to fall asleep. I'm worried

917
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,080
God everyone likes caz up like the wee holiday destinations here translate

918
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,600
We were programmed to be slaves, but since

919
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,840
Many a year we have a soul hope one day the outsiders will find the exit of the town or more

920
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
I

921
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,720
Think all the sodas just come out of end of machines

922
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,880
Yeah

923
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,400
Let's say benzene on it benzene. Oh, that's right upstairs

924
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,960
Right. We have something that can repair stuff for us

925
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,400
Right. We'll go back to the music guy. I want back out. Please. Please. Let me outside

926
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,960
Thank you next door

927
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Thank you very much. Um

928
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,680
Right, it looks like I need to go up now

929
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,640
Um

930
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,280
Maybe back to the pain guys. Maybe they've moved

931
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,720
Yeah, you don't say anything to me. Do you look like uh, yeah, that's okay

932
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,360
Okay, that's fine. Uh, right up up up. How'd I get up again?

933
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,640
Like literally anywhere, I guess

934
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,640
Let's have a go. This looks like that. Yeah, let's go

935
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,320
All the way the number of days ended up being

936
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,360
That's quite a while. Yeah, I'm not surprised

937
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,320
Uh, right

938
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,360
the youtuber throwing pain until I uh intervene sorry about that

939
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Let's see what's up here

940
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,320
We've got a bucket from here

941
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,440
Huh

942
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,520
um

943
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,480
I need so the programmer can can I not go up here?

944
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,400
Game said no you can do as much else as you want but that's too far

945
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,520
Uh, right. What's over here?

946
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Okay

947
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,880
Have I spoken to those guys? I don't think so. I don't want to take that in case it's like

948
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,000
Going the wrong way and have to climb all the way back up. Do you have another music sheet?

949
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,880
Oh, I don't know if I've got another song in me. Will we try it?

950
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,160
I definitely need to get up there, but how'd I get up there?

951
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
I don't know

952
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,160
Have I spoken to these two guys at the fire? I don't recall speaking to the guys at the fire

953
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,200
I thought there's a light here

954
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,760
I'm in someone's who's

955
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,800
The robot

956
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,100
The music just changed

957
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,520
Huh

958
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,840
I'm definitely in the right place

959
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,280
Have I heard the music changed any music changers?

960
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,160
Oh

961
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Take a notebook. Sure. Um, that's theft but also

962
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,120
A strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named climbing time

963
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,080
Everything is going according to plan. We've managed to

964
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,240
I can't read that fast

965
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:06,160
We managed to contact the upper level before the trans receiver went down. They are in a place called midtown

966
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:12,560
Apparently it's controlled by some kind of oppressive force. I talked to Momo earlier his eyes. I know his look

967
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,240
He will not come with us. I don't know what this means, but it'll probably be useful for there

968
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,840
We should go see the Momo person. I'm trying but I keep not walking into him

969
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,640
Okay, so there's like tons of

970
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,920
Okay, we've got two songs to go

971
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
Okay, we'll go speak to the musician

972
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,760
Uh, right how do I get down safely? How do I get down?

973
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,720
Let's go down

974
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,440
Gently easy easy. Right. Where's the music guy? Uh

975
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,480
Nope, this is the wrong way

976
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,920
Okay, I'm just gonna sing secret tunnel for one of them. It doesn't even count

977
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,960
Two kittens

978
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
Forbidden from one another

979
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,400
Their parents debate their people

980
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,800
Yes, I'm fine more. You'll never guess what I have on my person. Okay, we have three. Okay, let's do three

981
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,000
Untitled the tune contains 44 notes

982
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,680
You're gonna need to let them cook on that one ask them to do Wonderwall

983
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:48,640
I'm not sure I can do this one. This one's probably the closest one to me not gonna lie

984
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,040
Uh

985
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,840
Oh, thank you for the music practice. Yeah. Yeah. I've got one more

986
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,520
Cool down. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool down. We've got a prompt

987
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,080
It's a hot

988
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,720
It's a hot summer day and a feeling okay

989
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,320
And the air is going through my hair and killing me then and it feels real nice to be

990
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,560
Our cat in town. Oh, I feel so good

991
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:29,440
And it feels so nice and the sun is shining and feels alive and I'm going

992
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:36,960
And it's going great because I'm a cool cat on a hot summer day

993
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,720
Oh

994
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:06,160
He's gone. Oh, he's gone. Hey. Hey fuck him up. Hey. Hey. Hey fuck him up. Hey

995
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,720
Hey

996
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
We did it uncle

997
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,560
Okay, we did it right now we should actually probably progress the mission now

998
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,280
um

999
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,760
In the moment give him an animal right go. Sorry go to this freaking guy. Sorry. He's up right. Let's go upstairs

1000
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,520
Because I keep I have no idea where I'm actually going

1001
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,840
I love this goofy siren. Like just because you can't sing doesn't mean shouldn't you know what I'm saying?

1002
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,120
Right again pink guys

1003
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,040
Um

1004
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,840
Uh, right I'm just checking. Oh wait

1005
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,240
Wait the elevator doesn't work, but that's where I'm supposed to go. Huh

1006
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,960
Yeah

1007
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,780
Right I went into that hidden room

1008
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,600
There's a bucket and I'm up

1009
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,080
Why do you have to rune horse in moments and I'm gonna give him an animal because it's my earworm. I've got it stuck in my head

1010
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
Why or how?

1011
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,720
Okay, let's go this let's go dead ahead this time

01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,040
Oh, are you an elderly robot? Hi old man

1016
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,200
Oh, hey, it's you you do look weird and small, but there's something about your old chap

1017
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,440
I feel compelled to pet you, but I won't because I don't understand why

1018
01:15:54,240 --> 01:16:00,240
Oh, yeah, you want to pet me? I'm uh, oh, I can't pet. I can't get a pet. Okay. You can pet me in another way

1019
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,280
Oh, there's a vending machine

1020
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
I ran you in make it better

1021
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,080

1023
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,720
That's right. I'm I'm taping in the court that one. We got so juice

1024
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,280
Okay, we get an energy drink. I guess the robots can have energy drink

1025
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,080
Okay

1026
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:29,440
Oh, it is TV bonk. I press the big button

1027
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,920
You know, maybe sometimes TV sometimes or maybe she sometimes or maybe good

1028
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,760
News channel

1029
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,200
Uh, are you going to need nature documentaries?

1030
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,600
Oh my god, the robot's really straight up doing TV. That's horrible

1031
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,560
Oh, I see it. I see it. I see

1032
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
Please tell me I finally did it

1033
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

1034
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,800
I know it's playing the mysterious music again. I'm just getting that freaking document or something

1035
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,520
Translate

1036
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,480
Hey doc, I found the keys to the safe. You need to be more careful with these

1037
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:24,000
It's not enough to bury the safe behind a bunch of books the librarian. Okay. Well, we have our heading

1038
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
behind books

1039
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
There's a lot of books

1040
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,720
This is a lot

1041
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,760
There's too many books in here

1042
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,200
I was like properly in the library. So is there something I can interact with?

1043
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,520
Stealing time it's not stealing I see I see I see and give him a snowbreak. Oh, no

1044
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,840
It's there is how to develop your artificial intelligence in order to be creative as a real human volume

1045
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,560
I see rain. Hi, I see

1046
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,720
And um, uh, uh, sorry music time. He don't mind for no

1047
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
Oh

1048
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:14,880
Everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's the only cat that knows

1049
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,360
Hi snowberries. What were you up to you hooligans today?

1050
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,560
There'll be no more landing a train

1051
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:30,080
A I can't figure out where the safe is unfortunately

1052
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:37,600
Did you guys like aces news short? Yeah. Oh, I found it. Uh, this one, please

1053
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,320
What is it take

1054
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,400
The strange notebook with the symbol on it you're watching cartoons. Oh, that's so good

1055
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,200
I actually have aces

1056
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,240
Short linked if you want to literally listen to her laughing in the background like a maniac

1057
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,680
Uh, it's a strange notebook with a symbol on it. This one seems to belong to someone named the dog

1058
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,960
After weeks of research I've confined a spectrum

1059
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,880
Spectrometer with a powerful UV lamp with this it should be capable of warding the off dessert

1060
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,000
The initial attempt was explosive. I might have to test on the real conditions

1061
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't know what this means, but I'll probably be useful later

1062
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,280
We should go see that momo person who guardian tool. I'm trying. I keep going everywhere but him

1063
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,440
I don't know where he is

1064
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,520
please

1065
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,800
The ac weas classic on his blue

1066
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,400
Right, so I got a thing from being in here. So how do I get out again?

1067
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,760
Oh, okay

1068
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,760
There's something on the shelf there

1069
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
What is that?

1070
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
What's on the shelf over here?

1071
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,680
I see it

1072
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,360
Why?

1073
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,520
Oh, I can go for a cat nap. Oh, why not nice warm library

1074
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,600

Happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr

1076
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Okay, we have had a cat nap

1077
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:25,360
We are now going to try and get to this momo person. We've been at it for a wee hot setting now

1078
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,440
Uh, unfortunately following the light is not working for this. Um

1079
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,880
I think I just need to get higher up to like more obscure places

1080
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,400
I guess right. I've done that vending machine. Can I jump across? I can

1081
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,920
Can it looks like I should be able to jump up though. Are you sure?

1082
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,680
No, I can

1083
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,680
I think I think I'm gonna need a

1084
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,560
I want to say I need help, but I don't even know if you can explain where I need to go

1085
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
Because there's just so much

1086
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,840
I've been there I've been there have I been on top of that yet? I don't know. I don't think I have

1087
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,760
I'm just trying to go anywhere. I've not been

1088
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:27,040
Another ASMR she had 9,000. Oh god my desk like just that's so bright

1089
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,960
It does look like I can go this way. Hold on

1090
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,360
Excuse me. Pardon me. Come to me. Right. So I've been in that window

1091
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
Which is fine

1092
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,080
No, if I can go like oh, there's

1093
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,280
Oh, yeah ready for an uncle

1094
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,560
Suffering from success actually at um though

1095
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:59,760
Uh, I've got two more collabs to write. Oh, this is not going well. Um, I've got two. Is this just a scratch?

1096
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,240
Let me in please let me in. I don't know where to go

1097
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,880
What's that sound at the door? It's probably nothing

1098
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,960
I assure you it's not nothing come at the door right now open this door

1099
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,680
Show me who I'm supposed to go to

1100
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,480
Uh, right. Um, it's not like the music guy is gonna

1101
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,720
Oh, we're going down. I'm yelling dimmer

1102
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:32,960
Uh, yes, I have two more scripts to write and then all my ASMR collabs

1103
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,720
I've got 11 with people outside of velour. I'm going normally

1104
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,800
Um, and then I'm probably going to take a hot break on doing any clubs with anyone for a hot second

1105
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,080
11 is a lot considering I've just came flying out the gate. Okay. We're ready for a prompt

1106
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,960
Hey, I'm yeah, I'm definitely gonna focus on like meme ASMRs and solo stuff

1107
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,640
After that for a bit. Thank you. I will practice music. Do you think you can find more? I absolutely can

1108
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,640
You ready? I don't want it. Wait seven is a big number

1109
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,400
two

1110
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,000
Show item

1111
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,760
Ballard of the lonely robot. I think I can play it. Okay. Okay a bit sad a bit sad. Okay

1112
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:30,080
In senseless the best in the plane. I'm alone. I'm a robot and I'm in the rain and I'm sad

1113
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:44,880
And I don't feel glad for what I'm feeling but then again all the humans are dead and I'm kind of sad

1114
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,200
And I'm not so glad

1115
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Hit him with a rover

1116
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,680
Okay, okay, that wasn't that wasn't hopefully the next one's a bit more upbeat. Okay

1117
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:11,920
Uh, we've got one more for you buddy one more mildly important information

1118
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,920
Okay

1119
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
Other heroes here

1120
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:34,880
I have something I want to share and tell you it's something that I think you should care about

1121
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,880
It's an information overload in this world of

1122
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:48,000
Overgrown and everything inside is so looking. Okay. That was a really short one to try and come up with anything

1123
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,080
Thank you. Mr. Musician

1124
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,520
Um, unfortunately, I think I'm stuck right now. Um

1125
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,360
Kind of sounds like music from Omori

1126
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,280
Can you lay in the pillows? I think so. I think it's just a napspot

1127
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I'm trying to freaking

1128
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,280
You freaking freaks. I don't know how to progress

1129
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,880
I don't know. Maybe I need to

1130
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,800
Do I have enough energy drinks for the merchant? Hold on. How many energy drinks?

1131
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:23,120
One two, right, so I don't have enough for whatever the merchants hiding so maybe that's what I need to get access to normal

1132
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,720
I don't know

1133
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,680
Uh

1134
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:36,320
How'd it go? No, that's down close enough. I was one way or another honestly. You're doing great. Keep it up

1135
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,800
Sweet. Oh, and we're going down again. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. I didn't need to go. Okay. It's fine. I didn't need to go up

1136
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,440
uh

1137
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,440
I like writing songs in my spare time. So I'm come up. I'm jealous you can come up with lyrics on the spot

1138
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:54,160
I'm just going for it. Literally. It gives me a prompt. I'm not even rhyming properly. You're just being nice to me

1139
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,520
Actually, I'm not even rhyming and I'm just like

1140
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,280
That's me. Right. Okay. So that's me more right. How'd I get up?

1141
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,160
I was kind of coming down from here. I've already been this way, right?

1142
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,720
Sorry, it's probably have I been in here? Uh, this is the top of the bar

1143
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,480
Oh, these are the two that I've never speak to

1144
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,480
Hello

1145
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:28,800
I left it in the streets and the next day the zarks consumed it. That's crazy. They can eat everything

1146
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Hello, can I rub against your legs?

1147
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,160
I'm a male in your little heart

1148
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,920
Yeah, that's great. You love the pooters. What's this?

1149
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,640
Oh, is this where we're supposed to go if I actually progress the story line properly?

1150
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,280
I

1151
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,880
Shawnee trying not to fumble too hard. It's called improv. Shawnee. It's called improv. Oh, yeah

1152
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,760
You like the way that I don't rhyme because I don't have enough time to prepare for what I'm going to say next. I don't

1153
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,280
Right. I've already been in there. You can't fill me

1154
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:11,920
Fill me once shame on you. Fill me twice shame on you. Is anyone played straight? Am I supposed to get the third thing now?

1155
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,840
Despite what Shawnee says, she's actually a good thing, right?

1156
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
I really don't

1157
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,360
Wait, I'm an idiot. No

1158
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
Pull the other way

1159
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,640
I'm an idiot and it's been there the whole time. Am I going crazy?

1160
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,080
Wait, no, have I been here? Am I good?

1161
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,920
It's been here the whole time

1162
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,760
Oh, okay, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's been here the whole time

1163
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,480
Improv I

1164
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Oh

1165
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,720
My god, actual gamer moment. It's been here the entire time and I've been

1166
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,600
Well, you know what? I wouldn't be singing them songs if I was streamlined and okay translate

1167
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,560
outsiders

1168
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,560
Forbidden from one another

1169
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Um me

1170
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,240
It's never going to wait

1171
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,240
Why did I let them go? I'm all alone now. Hey, what do you want?

1172
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Uh, I want

1173
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,280
To leave

1174
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,800
This is a picture of outside. Do you want to go there meow? Well, don't bother waste the time

1175
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,160
I'll bring you only the loneliness and despair my friends had that dream too, but now they're gone and I'm all alone

1176
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,920
I don't know where they ended up. I tried to contact but that receiver doesn't work

1177
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,280
My friends and I took her notes of her research about the outside here. Take mine if you really want to go there

1178
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,120
Okay

1179
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,000
You're on your own. I'm done with the outside. Well, wait, that's it

1180
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,160
Momo seems very sad. He misses his friends. Let's check the notebook

1181
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,280
The outsider manifesto. We must go outside at any cost. We must protect our brothers and sisters

1182
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,960
We must stay away from dessert. It is saying clementime zanzibar doc and momo

1183
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,520
That does not say zanzibar. Does it what the fuck does that say zit belt?

1184
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,520
his are

1185
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:31,120
The belt is our okay zanzibar. Honestly, isn't that bad? I'm not even going to be mad at myself

1186
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,280
I don't like honestly, I think we should find the other notebooks. Okay, right. That's fine

1187
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,280
Did it say a password or did it curse? We'll never know right

1188
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:48,240
Hey, little cat. You're still looking for useless books, right? If I got if I got everyone's book by accident

1189
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,960
Oh, hold on. We're streamlined. Sorry me mucking about. I actually just streamlined this. Okay. Oh, you found clementime snows

1190
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,080
She was really brave. You know the most fearless person I ever met

1191
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:05,680
Hey cat, you're still looking for the notes. No, yeah now you oh it belonged to doc

1192
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,520
He was really a huge nerd for electronic stuff. He was was always on the verge of great discovery

1193
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:17,200
No way I streamlined this. I've got all of them feels good man. That's my notebook. I was oh

1194
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Who that need

1195
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,600
Zanzibar freaking thing. Zanzibar. Isn't that a song from

1196
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
Jack Black or something?

1197
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,160
Back home to a movie. Oh, there's a coup

1198
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,720
Oh back home to I remember this video game it was made just after I was created. I think I can't remember it

1199
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,960
Well the scientist and I spent a lot of time playing it. It was fun. I miss him. I can't even remember his name

1200
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,360
You'll remember soon enough. Don't force it

1201
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,760
And I know it's frustrating if you don't know things off the top of your head, but

1202
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,080
What the what kind of poster is that?

1203
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,800
Problem. Is this like troll face their version of troll face?

1204
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,720
Ooh rack in size and one problem. No

1205
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,360
What a bizarre little

1206
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,520
Thank you

1207
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,000
Uh

1208
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,520
What lunch

1209
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,960
Oh

1210
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,800
I got a achievement called curiosity killed cat. Oh, no. I'm not walking in the right direction. I'm like all spun around

1211
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,680
Stop spinning

1212
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,680
You're gonna make mercy sick

1213
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,840
It's just good terrible more stop. Wait. I can't get it all. Oh

1214
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,720
Okay, that's what that's what I thought exactly

1215
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,600
Uh, what do you do?

1216
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,240
You

1217
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,000
Don't do much, but that's okay. You don't have to do much translate

1218
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,400
The city has a cylindrical shape of 450 in diameter

1219
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,200
There is a level above ours the ceiling the city has

1220
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,240
Seems to have a ceiling if I remember my books the big blue skies hidden behind it curious

1221
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,360
Um, what's up here anything for me? I don't know where the last no

1222
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,600
There's them

1223
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,280
Right, I will come back with your stinky notepad

1224
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:19,200
And as evidence that I have been here take this

1225
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:25,280
You deserve it for not for hiding in plain sight from me. Okay

1226
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,560
The symbol on the wall watches one what symbol

1227
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,440
Okay, okay, so he's gonna point out

1228
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
What one haven't I been to

1229
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,840
I've been in that one. I've been in that one. So it's this one over here

1230
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,600
How'd I get there

1231
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
Okay getting that first

1232
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,760
Yeah, I haven't been in that one

1233
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,160
Sorry didn't mean to break it

1234
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,480
Have I been in that one?

1235
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,760
Oh no, I'm gonna have to use my head right okay go across

1236
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,640
Zanzibar was a player we player map in helo. Oh, maybe

1237
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,720
Challenge play the game with a bag on your head. That's not even possible the controls don't respond

1238
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:44,400
Right if there's a symbol over here, did I go in this one or not? I think I took the ledge down. Yeah

1239
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,640
Translate ventilation power supply

1240
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
I need to break it

1241
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,400
Okay, oh my god, we did it I get it

1242
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:12,800
Okay, big jump be brave. Oh, you're fine. That's just a we drop. Sorry to scare you like that, buddy

1243
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
Oh

1244
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:22,880
Just that just a little bit of myth normally you're not really supposed to leave much of a trace behind but he will press y

1245
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,120
Let me out

1246
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,720
Okay, so we have a shortcut. Okay, but we need to

1247
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,960
But

1248
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:38,080
Hello, hello, hello, any oh, we got some fresh water

1249
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,800
Speaking of water, I'm actually gonna open my bottle. Oh, no, I have a bottle of water from yesterday that is

1250
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,440
Stop drinking we don't want you to pee everywhere

1251
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,640
Chat we need to band together to mass spam bad cat puns. No

1252
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,920
Shawna got me feeling something kind of way. Yeah, I like the necklace

1253
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,880
Uh, right, there's there must be a book in here. Sorry. Wait. Whoa. What was that?

1254
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
Wait, it's on top of the thing

1255
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,160
Finally the last notebook this one seems to belong to Zanzaba

1256
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,200
All traces of organic life has disappeared except for what we call deserves

1257
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:31,840
They seem to eat almost anything that moves and breed at an inconceivable rate get it because they can see fast

1258
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,920
Uh, it's it's as if being walked in the city wasn't hard enough. Oh

1259
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,240
There's also a lot in this book. I said I found a design flaw in the transceiver

1260
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,640
But I think I figured out how to fix it. Here's the equation with this. We should be able to help

1261
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:53,120
Momo repair the transfer if it can communicate with the upper levels that could be our way up

1262
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,800
Let's show him what fun. Okay, baby

1263
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:08,080
Oh, there's a thing down there to remember. I see it. How'd I get there? Can I get done? I would like to remember

1264
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Member in the memory

1265
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,720
What's this? C14

1266
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,880
Remarkable companions have evolved so much in the early days

1267
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,960
They're simple ai merely in

1268
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:31,120
Imitated human art now. This is all on their own humans often said that making art is important in desperate situations

1269
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
These are certainly desperate times

1270
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,600
Getting his memories back

1271
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:46,000
Uh, actually should I come back up again? I think so. Whoops. Oh, and I'm going further down. Oh, and I'm going further down still

1272
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,080
Okay, let's just uh

1273
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,720
Let's just climb up a different location. Sometimes it's a bit finicky

1274
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,360
Right, I need to go top right

1275
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,680
I've made an

1276
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:07,120
I have made an incredible decision. We shall band together for now. We are Legion and meow

1277
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
Or or is night from

1278
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,520
What are you saying?

1279
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,080
Why are you blue?

1280
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,720
I have probably gone the longest way possible to get back to this guy. Sorry

1281
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
Unfortunately

1282
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,560
I don't wrong. Sorry. Sorry. It was a big jump. I shouldn't have done that to you. Oh, we need to go up

1283
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,560
We're getting there

1284
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,800
It's just taking me a hot second because I'm a little slow in the head

1285
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,840
But I thank you for being patient for me reeflings

1286
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:53,680
Okay, let's get up up ease. Hello. I did it. I got your quest items

1287
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,720
Are you still looking for the notebook? Yes, that's all

1288
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,680
That's his notebook, right? I never quite understood what he was talking about most of the time

1289
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,720
But he was very wise. Wait, you actually found all my friends notebook

1290
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:16,160
Oh, what's that? No, the transfer you were can be repaired. That's incredible. That means we should be able to communicate outside of the slum

1291
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,800
Climbing time

1292
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,160
Hey Johnny. Hi chat. Hi, Broly legend. Thank you for the tip

1293
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,400
and

1294
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:29,040
Climbing time doc. I'm sorry. I doubted our cause. I promise you'll find a way to reach the servers

1295
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:33,120
Thank you. We might be able to find you a way up now. Let's fix this piece of junk trans receiver

1296
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,720
The tv

1297
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,120
Or diameter

1298
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:48,000
Oh wait our friend in the programming thing said he'll fix anything. Oh, wait, he just did it come with me

1299
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,440
Come with me

1300
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,040
Up there see that building high above others

1301
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,240
Yeah

1302
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:06,560
If you install the transceiver at the very top of that tower, you should be able to communicate to go to the city

1303
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,760
My friends might still be out there. If there's any way out, they'll know

1304
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,240
There's only one small click enough to evade the zarks. We need you a little outsider. Bring us to the sky

1305
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,960
That's kind of that lane kind of goes hard

1306
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,920
Oh no, I need to get ready to run I think

1307
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,200
Oh no

1308
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,080
I don't like it already

1309
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,000
When do they start jumping out at me? How much time do I have?

1310
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:47,840
Oh no, oh no, this can't be right, okay

1311
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,160
I can't even see where to go

1312
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,160
I

1313
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:01,760
Assume I just jump up from over there. I don't want them to grab me but we're gonna

1314
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,160
That they're trying to get their attention

1315
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,040
Okay

1316
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:19,600
Uh, uh, uh, can I just hold a and you go up? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Perfect

1317
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,280
Okay, keep her going eggs bacon grits sausage

1318
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,240
Got a flat ass, but it still takes sausage

1319
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,320
Oh no

1320
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:37,680
Oh no, oh get me up. Just get me up. Oh my god. Oh no

1321
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,920
Oh my god, okay. Okay. What's the summer memory? Sorry. Are they chasing me?

1322
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,080
Oh

1323
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,480
I've got nine lines check. Yeah, the city is full of neon. It wasn't all this way

1324
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:55,760
We used to be strict energy caps, especially in the slums, but people couldn't handle the concept dodging

1325
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:02,240
One day someone lit up rainbow lamps neon signs all over the house that person was taken away and never seen the game

1326
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:08,720
Again, but people saw hope and not long after everyone started putting lots of lights in their homes

1327
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,960
There was nothing their pressers could do

1328
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,360
It was the way for people to see colors again like on the outside. I think it helped

1329
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,520
Okay, we're there progress. I don't want to go back down. Please don't make me go back down there

1330
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,160
Is this not the way should we do we?

1331
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,640
Oh, no, it's up. I see it

1332
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,200
Oh, we have a little swing

1333
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,840
Swing again on it. Oh, okay. Okay. We have swing mechanics stuff

1334
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,800
Uh

1335
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,520
Barrel classic rollover. Okay

1336
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,480
But not roll off the map. Oh, no

1337
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,360
That's why there's that metal pole there

1338
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,080
Why is it so cold?

1339
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,200
I knew it's drawn in with the fire. Eh, I'm playing as a cat. Okay

1340
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:02,240
Is there more of those bogey things ahead? Okay, I'm holding the right trigger. So we were running

1341
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,680
Where

1342
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:14,080
Ah, oh no, there's like there's a mechanic up ahead. What is it?

1343
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,400
What is it?

1344
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,440
What's the mechanic? I see red. I see a code

1345
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,080
I see it looks like I can just jump up to the left and I'll honestly

1346
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,240
Hack the door

1347
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,800
I'm waiting till they all come over

1348
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,880
Hack the door

1349
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,560
Wait, I can't lock them in though. Wait, do I need to lock them in?

1350
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,680
I'm not very bright. Wait

1351
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,080
I'm not very bright. Is that them all?

1352
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,800
Oh

1353
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,800
What and then go okay, okay, okay

1354
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,080
Okay, I get it. I get it

1355
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,840
Okay, and they can't jump over. Okay. I get it. I get it. I understand that was

1356
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,840
You want to go any faster buddy? Jeez. Not like there's like

1357
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,520
Organisms are ready. They mull your eyeballs out the socket

1358
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,480
Yeah

1359
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,080
I'll go on achievement for jumping 500 times and it's called catapult

1360
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:40,720
Okay, we did it. Oh, no, there's more. Whoa

1361
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,200
Good thing this game has aim assist

1362
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Uh

1363
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:54,240
Are they gonna like pop out here? Oh, no

1364
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:03,520
Oh, please get me up. Oh, no. Oh, yes, and then move the plank darlin my my yin-yur

1365

Oh, not good not good not good not good not good

1368
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
Oh

01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
Okay, where do we need to go?

1370
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:27,200
I see a light to the right. So maybe jump on that scaffolding and then they're stuck through here

1371
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:35,120
Okay, I'm gonna my money's on the scaffolding to the right

1373
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
What is there more

1374
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,880
Oh, I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it

1375
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:58,720
Oh, I don't like being chased. Please no more

1376
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,840
Okay, what's going on here?

1377
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,840
Did I just see some behind me? Okay. Why did I want to hack the door?

1378
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:10,480
Am I being chased? No, right. They're stuck inside

1379
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,800
There's a barrel. Okay barrels

1380
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,720
Hold on. Right. Okay. We can discover this memory first

1381
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,440
Okay, Neco Neco

1382
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:30,880
Neco corporate they were reason for waste management as trash from the upper levels overloaded

1383
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:38,240
They tried to develop a bacteria to dissolve at all after the humans disappeared that bacteria mutated growing eaten away more than trash

1384
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
And now we have drugs. Let's go

1385
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:47,680
Of course, it's a corporation that caused the d- mmm. I'm not surprised. This is my kind of game. That's right preach preach

1386
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,640
Right, so

1387
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,360
Hold on I'm just trying to

1388
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:01,040
So what open that gate they'll chase me and then grab the barrel very quickly

1389
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,360
And roll it over

1390
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,120
Okay, hold on hold on

01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,560
Oh, wait, can I hack myself in here?

1395
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:25,120
No, no, no, wait. I messed up

1396
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,800
Bring

1397
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,800
Dang. Oh, no, it's fine

1398
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,200
They can't come for me because they're stuck at that wall

1399
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,920
Oh, sorry, I heard something. Oh my god. Sorry. They made a really weird noise there and that freaked me out

1400
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,640
Oh

1401
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,120
What do you mean? I should play horror games. What are you talking about?

1402
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,160
No, they fucking terrify me

1403
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,480
Terrify like literally horror games or like donut on stuff because it just

1404
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,200
Horrifies me so much

1405
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,160
Okay, oh, yeah, you like that I face it maneuvers

1406
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:09,680
Up up up. Oh, that wasn't much of an up, but I'll take it. Oh, okay. That wasn't up. We're fine. We're safe. Whoa. You climb up that jeez

1407
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,720
Verically, are we safe over there?

1408
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,160
I see a lever

1409
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,200
I see a lift

1410
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:24,320
I think I see bodies. I see little glowing things

1411
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,360
Well

1412
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,800
I was fine just a layer at the mold where I'm going

1413
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,760
I was kind of kidding

1414
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:49,600
I was kind of kidding. I think I need to stall out the lift coming down

1415
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,800
Come on

1416
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,520
There's more dropping. Wait, that's cheating

1417
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:02,320
They're gonna stop me from running around. Oh wait, there is I see the lift. I see the lift

1418
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:05,760
It's coming down the shaft. I am

1419
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,360
Why is there so many jump jump?

1420
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:17,600
Please please get saved. Oh my god. Go. Oh my god. We just beat their vertical leap

1421
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:25,920
Oh, that's awful. That is awful. Please tell me we can unlock a gun. I'm not even kidding. Please tell me we get a gun

1422
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
Oh

1423
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,920
We need the mealmen we need the movement the mealmen

1424
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,920
I

1425
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:42,640
I really hope this cat gets a gun. I'm so sorry. There's no gun. No, I have to run away the entire time

1426
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,680
That's terrifying

1427
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,320
I'm so stressed

1428
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,400
Are we safe?

1429
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
Right

1430
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,040
Right open

1431
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,480
I demand you open how'd I get up? I go like this

1432
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,440
First of all

1433
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,840
Okay, there's no orange around. I think I'm safe

1434
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,560
Here is put the transceiver on the antenna this

1435
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,200
Uh transceiver here you go

1436
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,360
Oh

1437
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,800
We did it

1438
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:38,080
We're lighting it up. What does it mean? I don't really know. Well, we're communicating with the higher city, I guess

1439
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,560
Hydration check little reefling

1440
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,600
I love the aesthetics of this game. Yeah

1441
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Activate in the elevator. Oh, maybe

1442
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:09,360
Look the view is beautiful from here. I remember now the city it was meant to be a shelter. Oh

1443
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,080
No

1444
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,560
Looks like those look like stars, but they're only light markings

1445
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,960
Lights marking the hermetic

1446
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,600
Roof sealing off the city

1447
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:28,160
Mankind built the shelter to protect themselves from the outside

1448
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,880
But I came at a cost nobody can get out

1449
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:36,800
The outside was a disaster completely barren unlivable and dangerous

1450
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:43,040
But if you come from there, it must mean it's safe again

1451
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:48,080
And my promise wasn't just to go to the outside. It was to open the city

1452
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,400
Yeah, is that your goal

1453
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,400
I still don't understand why some memories are coming back and others aren't but I'm certain now. This is my purpose

1454
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:05,440
I have to open the city. Come on. Let's get back and find Momo now that we've connected the transmitter

1455
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,520
We should be able to get help

1456
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,160
Okay, okay

1457
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,560
Not bad

1458
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:19,600
This is the longest ride we're putting a lot of faith in this little cat in a bucket honestly

1459
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,600
Cola burp emote win

1460
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,040
Soon everyone's emotes got submitted before me

1461
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:33,600
Mercy has been accepted as errors. I'm waiting to be accepted and then mine are being done last because um

1462
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,600
I

1463
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:41,600
Want the girls stuff to be done first and reeflings you guys are actually like super understanding the slums part two

1464
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,760
No, get me out of the slums. Come on. I've been here a little too long

1465
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:49,760
Oh my god, I bought these for Gimli and Vigo and

1466
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:57,360
Vigo doesn't play with toys and Gimli only plays with a specific toy that they discontinued and I'm absolutely reading

1467
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
Oh, no, he went

1468
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,000
Little outsider if you're all that's such a cute nickname

1469
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:07,920
Little outsider if you're reading this that means you're still alive. Excellent

1470
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,680
I took some equipment to the bar to take advantage of their antenna. Come meet me there

1471
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,520
I've locked the window, but the code to open it is simple. It is

1472
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:25,280
Be careful it's case sensitive. See at the bar that must be the code for the window near the entrance looks cool

1473
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,360
Okay, the bar we know where the bar is

1474
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,760
Oh this

1475
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,680
Oh

1476
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,920
Okay, that was I thought amen

1477
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,440
The code at the bar. Sorry. I get it now. Okay. Uh, let me

1478
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:49,200
refresh my memory of the city really quickly

1479
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:55,920
Uh, I can't remember where the bar is, but you know what we'll just make our way down

1480
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,560
And hope we're going the right way

1481
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:06,320
Uh, is that the bar? Oh, maybe no, no down little little outsider or or yinya as I call you please go down

1482
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,040
Yeah, just like that. Yay. This is it

1483
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,760
Hi momo

1484
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,760
Hey little furball

1485
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:19,520
Come here. I managed to get a signal. All right. Let's go buddy. Show me what you're working with. Oh, sorry

1486
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,840
We've got a little too excited

1487
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,920
But you show it. Oh, I'll pull up a chair. Well, I'll hold on let me get up

1488
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:31,280
Hold on. Let me get up. Oh, he actually putt me off. Oh, I'm getting head cut

1489
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,780
Let me see if I can get this thing working

1490
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:47,120
Hi, mommy. This cat ears look cute. Yeah, I'm a necklace today. Oh, I've almost got it

1491
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,080
Hello, can anyone hear me?

1492
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:59,200
Hello, yes, we can hear you. We're from the slums. We're looking for a way out and wait, is that you zanzibar?

1493
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,480
Momo

1494
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:09,040
I can't believe it. I'm so happy to hear your voice zanzibar. Where are you? Are the others okay? Yes

1495
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,640
We are safe. We found a way up

1496
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,640
Up

1497
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:22,400
Hello, do you still hear me? You have to go through the sewers to reach us. It's very dangerous

1498
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,440
It's not because everywhere

1499
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
Sewers, how? Hello

1500
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,920
Darn it. We've lost the signal

1501
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:37,200
I can't believe it. Zanzibar is alive. He and the other outsiders managed to go up through the sewers

1502
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:43,040
The sewers are the most dangerous place in the slums, but if zanzibar made it there must be a way

1503
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:59,200
You'll never get past the sewers. It's infested with zirks. They'll make a quick meal out of you

1504
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,360
Especially you little one

1505
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,520
Many tried their luck in the past and it does the end well

1506
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:10,720
Anyway, I warned you. Your business is none of my business

1507
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:16,160
Oh, he he gave him a warning

1508
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:20,400
Mmm

1509
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:27,760
Sumis his father doc used to be a great scientist who was working on some new weapon to fight the zirks

1510
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:31,840
A few years ago. He went off to test the device. I love a cave back

1511
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,400
Seamuses never in the south

1512
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,200
up here

1513
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,760
Not so good

1514
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,000
Don't listen to seamus. He's just scared like I was a doc bill weapon

1515
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,160
That's our ticket to join the outsiders

1516
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:55,920
In his notebook doc mentioned a secret lab a few times that must be where he was working on it

1517
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:01,280
There might be a clue in Seamuses apartment. Come on. Follow me

1518
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,800
I'll follow you

1519
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
I will follow you

1520
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,200
Follow you wherever you

1521
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,520
mainly

1522
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:14,320
Because I'm just a kitty cat

1523
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,080
Down in the slums without my little family

1524
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:26,400
Of shot no are in is it two tail two dots

1525
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,760
Two dots on tail. I've forgotten in the other cat. Oh, he's still cleaning it off

1526
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:38,960
Bro, I think you're gonna have to get a mural down or something because uh, yeah, but you ain't cleaning up paint on concrete

1527
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:45,360
Oh, is this a uh, no point in translating. I thought it was a memory. Oh knock knock

1528
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,280
Let us in

1529
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:56,560
Two dots poke a dot. Oh, that sounds right. Come on. Seamus open the door. You know, your father would have wanted to help us

1530
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:02,160
Two dots poke a dot shot noir and Cali Cali Cali Caloo

1531
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,400
Well, that was to be expected the situation is pretty tough on Seamus. He doesn't want to hear about the outsiders

1532
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,200
He won't help me, but you I think I have an idea

1533
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,320
Okay, what's your idea Momo?

1534
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:25,760
Oh, I'm to go in are you sure here take doc's notebook and show it to Seamus

1535
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:30,480
It contains a lot of information that will hopefully act as an electoral shock

1536
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:34,400
Find the secret lab little outsider. Oh, that's such a cute name

1537
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,840
I'm going back to the bar to try and re-establish communication with others. Okay. Thank you Momo

1538
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,360
Hi Seamus

1539
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,640
I scared him

1540
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:51,360
No, no, don't shoot me away take this. What is it? Wait, this is my papa

1541
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:56,240
Oh, wow, I never knew there's a secret room here in our flat, but where?

1542
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:04,080
Uh, okay. Well considering there's loads of things to knock down on the wall. I'm a gobo knock all the things off the wall

1543
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:17,280
They really didn't hide it did they? Okay, but what's the code? I don't see any numbers and stuff. These schematics

1544
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,280
I

1545
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,960
Like how to jump back every time

1546
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
Oh, there's like little

1547
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,840
What is this thing translate?

1548
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,880
Time will tell

1549
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:34,400
You will considering the humans are all parish. Yeah, time will tell actually

1550
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:40,640
Actually factually as you are correct. Is it better than little seaweed? No, you don't call me little outsider

1551
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:45,280
I say being all we foreigner. I'm like, oh, why are you calling me we foreigner the fuck?

1552
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,640
That's your clue time will tell

1553
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:50,880
Oh

1554
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,440
The clocks. Okay the clocks. Okay. What time?

1555
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,240
Two o'clock five o'clock one o'clock one o'clock two five one one

1556
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:04,640
Two five one one. Yeah. Okay. Time will tell. Yeah. Time really did tell

1557
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:10,160
Oh, I missed the animation of the door opening up. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't realize it was gonna be right there

1558
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,760
Hello

1559
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:14,800
Wow

1560
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
Oh, there's bugs inside

1561
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,960
I've never seen this room. I can't believe he managed to hide it from me all this time

1562
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,240
These blueprints. They must be for dessert weapon. Wait, you said I didn't get a gun

1563
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:32,320
Papa was always so secretive with his work. He told me the weapon was working in theory

1564
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:36,640
But I needed a real life test. He went outside the slums and he never came back

1565
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,560
That must be very sweet

1566
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,800
The bugs

1567
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,600
Translate

1568
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:51,360
Observations cute sound, but never friendly old bacteria of human time eat all kinds of materials total

1569
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Vision in the darkness reacts to intense light and that's a different color

1570
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,680
Um

1571
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:05,360
It's just a shelf. So wait, what am I to do? I'm just a cat the fuck

1572
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,640
What you want me to do here knock some stuff over

1573
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:14,080
Don't tell me this one it's got the light next to it. That's when you know

1574
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,480
What wait one match is supposed to do though

Translate

1576
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:34,400
Uh robot news headlines lurks are officially no longer under control. They now eat metal. Okay

1577
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,560
Wait, oh, sorry. That was a bit too much of a jump. Was it in the box?

1578
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,560
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Sorry talk

1579
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,200
Find anything interesting in here. Okay, find something

1580
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:51,760
Oh, I was like, um under the table

1581
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,520

1582
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,960
Uh, what's this box up here?

1583
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,960

Hmm

1589
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:23,600
Wait, I remember that that's his tracker

1590
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:27,840
Papa always used that tracker to keep an eye on where I was

1591
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,080
Maybe we can reverse it to find where he went. I can't believe my papa might still be alive

1592
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:37,520
I've missed him so much. You need a weapon for the zirks, right? My papa definitely took one with him

1593
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,320
We just need to repair the tracker so we can find him someone in the slum should be able to help come with me

1594
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,400
I'll open the door for you. Okay

02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:15,720
trying to get to that guy but now that we did it and we pretty much did all the

1643
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:23,720
other stuff it's a perfect game I just want my gun so I don't have to run away

1644
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:36,200
like a maniac every time I see this a zur 16 hours in a day it's interesting to

1645
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:40,480
see how differently you're playing from a zur what's a zur that must be it he

1646
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,800
really left the slum yeah it's dangerous out there but I must be sure I need to

1647
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:53,000
know let's do this as the coconut one said in Elden Ring let's get to it

1648
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:59,280
the earth rotational periods go down ours just as they work better with hexadecimal

1649
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:08,800
or maybe the capital is pigs one and the work day got changed to 16 oh no

1650
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:16,760
oh it's pulsating the only thing throw but I want in the vicinity near me is a

1651
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:29,560
tentacle can I be attacked here no he's shown me where go wait if he's shown me

1652
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:34,440
where it goes or a secret or something yeah this isn't really like much of a

1653
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:40,080
secret place I'm a just following and not muck about as Zora chose war picked a

1654
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:45,200
gun and killed everyone look all these eggs they will eat us I can't do this

1655
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:49,400
I'm not as fast as you the Zorks will get me for sure here take this badge my

1662
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:40,000
it it's not a horror game strongy relax we loved it undulating flesh walls I

1663
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:46,680
never noticed a really cool detail look at how huge this wall is oh yes I remember

1664
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:50,400
it was a symbol of the division between those in the slums and in midtown that

1665
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:53,640
and the fact that they kept throwing their garbage down here what horrible thing

1666
02:08:53,640 --> 02:09:01,720
to do maybe that's why they failed good I love this game already yes take down

1667
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:07,080
the high table I understand strongy good refling good refling you pleased me

1668
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:18,440
you will be rewarded for such loyalty this dad just run right down the middle

1669
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:22,720
I'm trying to look ahead it doesn't look like I go up it looks like I go down and

02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:31,940
Swing it back now y'all

1680
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:34,100
Chris grows

1681
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,740
And then go back and then swing it one more time

1682
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:39,860
Give me the old wrap around

1683
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:45,780
Could see it I could see where the under passage was cuz they lit it up

1684
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:51,740
I have to admit the game design with lighting up where you're supposed to go next. I appreciate greatly

1685
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:57,540
Is that trolley

1686
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:00,540
That's quite a lot to dodge

1687
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:05,340
Hey

1688
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:10,160
Do the Hawaiian search like oh my god, hold on little buddy. Oh

1689
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:16,460
Oh ouch, are you okay in your

1690
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:27,300
That was a huge fall it was dog should be nearby we must be cool. Are you okay? I'm limping

1691
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:32,020
Can dog patches up? Are we gonna be okay? Oh

1692
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:40,080
No, how'd uh oh you okay? Oh, we're walking off. Okay. We're walking off

1693
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:46,980
Okay, give it like yeah, you're you're you're spit has healing properties. Okay. I guess we have to go up I

1694
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:53,960
Can hear something is it just frogs like ambience or is like is it something that's gonna there's nothing orange though

1695
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:00,800
The video game wouldn't be so cruel as to not show orange if there's enemies nearby surely the game wouldn't do that

1696
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,520
No, those are frogs

1697
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,280
I'm actually a really good fool

1698
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,680
Same leg it's never fully healed per thing. Oh

1699
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,520
No

1700
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:19,080
Where they need to go

1701
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,040
Hold on

1702
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:27,040
Hold on I'm about to cross a barrier where they need to go. I can't see

1703
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:32,120
Just jump across the bridge and then to the right cuz it's all lit up there

1704
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:43,040
Oh you turn hold on this is lit up. Oh

1705
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,520
Use item

1706
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:58,640
An energy drink. Well, it's definitely no way hmm. It's an electrical generator, but it seems to require some other part function. Okay

1707
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:08,240
Okay, we're not gonna get jumped on this side, I don't think because of that generator we need to come back to it

1708
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,280
Did we follow the cable? I think so

1709
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:18,600
Okay, when the music gets intense I'll start screaming

1710
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,280
I

1711
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:28,080
Really don't want to make noise. Oh

1712
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:40,600
Thank goodness it's in a cage, why is it in a cage because that baits clearly

1713
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:44,040
What generate? Uh

1714
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,560
Hello

1715
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Is this on its head? Oh, hello

1716
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:53,040
Oh

1717
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:58,960
Sorry, didn't mean to scare of course the scientist has like crazy cables coming over this here

1718
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:02,280
Wow

1719
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:07,520
Wait, you're not a zerk. Who are you? That's my badge you're wearing. How'd you find it?

1720
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:13,920
Did my son send you? Oh, see miss you clever boy. You've been alone here for oh, I've been alone here for ages

1721
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:19,200
I came here to test my defluxor, but it didn't go as planned. I wish I could go back home

1722
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:20,840
I miss my son daily

1723
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:25,640
You can have a look around the house if you want, but I have no idea how to escape this place

1724
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:33,520
What do you what do you mean? Wait, you're not gonna say knows what to do remember

1725
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:42,080
What do you remember little buddy? I've seen humans wear costumes like I mean similar

1726
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:46,680
They were small and running around making lots of noise. Oh, they were children. Yes

1727
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:53,240
The streets felt much more alive with children even with the difficulty they brought the adults seem to love them very much

1728
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:58,440
Doc says he misses Seamus. Is this the same thing? Yeah, it is. Oh

1729
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:02,560
No, no, he's out of beverages. Oh dear

1730
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:05,760
What's going on here?

1731
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:08,880
Hello radio. Oh

1732
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,240
Why oh

1733
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:19,680
I

1734
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,320
Was this mean

1735
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,440
But Morty you go to shove the mega seats. Oh, it does kind of oh, no

1736
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,200
It does look a wee bit like Rick

1737
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:38,120
Hey, be careful with the defluxor at fill charge it can explode zirks like

1738
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:44,840
What do you mean be careful give give me it meow

1739
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:51,320
This baby needs 1.21 gigawatts to work and the only thing around here that

1740
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:57,080
Kind of just as a generator outside the house. The problem with that is it's not gonna start

1741
02:15:57,080 --> 02:16:02,520
I think a fuse blew and with all the zirks around it's too dangerous for me go and fix it

1742
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:07,560
I'm not fast enough, but you might be if you reach the generator and replace the fuse

1743
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:12,560
It should be able to get the defluxor recharge. Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what to do

1744
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,080
Okay, I'm listening. Are you about to give me a weapon?

1745
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:23,360
Do I need to not be absolutely terrified and shitting my panty loners? Hmm?

1746
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:28,160
Cuz they just we ship my pants when it comes to these bad boys

1747
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:36,720
Well, I was actually already at the generator, so I know where to go here take this fuse is brand new

1748
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:43,360
Okay, thank you turning on the generator will be allowed to expect company once you fix the generator

1749
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:45,360
It should be able to charge

1750
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:52,320
The kick and kick start the defluxor you just need to follow this cable change the fuse and meet me back here

1751
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:58,400
Best of luck. Okay, so there's gonna be a bit of a jump sequence once we start it, but that's fine. We know where to go

1752
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:02,560
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now surely

1753
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:09,320
Surely they wouldn't spawn them in right now. No, it's after I do the generator. Okay

1754
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:14,040
The game is giving me a grace period. It's either I take a right or a left here

1755
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:22,560
Okay, now what were they coming from I can do it

1756
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:28,400
I can do it ominous red glow

1757
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,160
Hey

1758
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:38,760
Yes, give me that technology

1759
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:44,680
Wait what I can't cross

1760
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:52,080
Oh my god, bro, you're gonna need to aim bought this stuff. I can't get across cuz they're coming on the bridge

1761
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:59,560
They need to wait until it involves the mall doc you need better aim I

1762
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:03,000
Can't even get along the bridge

1763
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:17,640
Think I'm okay, okay, you actually didn't do a bad job

1764
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:24,120
Why would you do that game

1765
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:30,440
You know that would scare me

1766
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:36,640
This isn't a horror game. Why would you do that? Get me inside right now? Oh my god

1767
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:43,960
Doc is beaming. Yeah, oh you celebrate is so happy hydration chair

1768
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:50,760
Amazing you got the generator back on heck. Yeah, dude. You're well. Yeah

1769
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:54,600
And how do you see you're welcome in French I've already forgotten

1770
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,280
Doody and me duty and I

1771
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:04,720
Yeah, my voice is unfortunately breaking at the moment

1772
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:10,720
Have you seen how powerful the defluxer is it's definitely our way out here wait a minute

1773
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:14,520
I might be able to mount this defluxer to your drone

1774
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,640
Oh, that's exactly what I want to hear doc

1775
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:22,920
Give me um, you know that guy that smashes like money on the table gif and basically that right now

1776
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,200
You do not have to tell me twice. Oh

1777
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:29,880
Oh, he popped

1778
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:41,040
Thank you

1779
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:44,720
It works the defluxer is now installed on your fancy drone

1780
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:49,320
It's not meant to run off such a small amount of power if you use it too much a kid malfunction

1781
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:54,400
Just remember it's dangerous. Now. Let's go back to the village. I'm coming home to my son. Oh

1782
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,200
That's so adorable

1783
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,800
You had I do press a

1784
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:06,120
No, he's jumping on it. Wait, how do I use it?

1785
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,120
Oh

1786
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:18,480
Yeah, oh

1787
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:26,280
My god, okay, it's a wee bit short. That's fine. It's better than nothing. I'ma take it. I must take it. Okay

1788
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:29,760
Do you be bombs? Oh

1789
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:35,240
Take out all those darks and we can get through yes

1790
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:40,400
Wow, oh, sorry, I did it a bit quicker than the store. Well, it's working great

1791
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:43,800
But as expected it can overheat let it cool for a bit when that happens

1792
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:46,320
I hope we will last until we reach the village. Don't say that

1793
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:52,640
Why don't you bring your freaking big-ass one as well? Why does it have to be down to me?

1794
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,200
Like I'm a freaking cat. I'm literally in my head like oh

1795
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:01,640

What's the dealio here

1798
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:14,040

Reelings

1806
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:58,520
The other barrel needs to go to the pay this play

1807
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,080
It's the steam coming over

1808
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:08,120
I see it. I couldn't see it before but I see it now. It wasn't the paper all it was the freaking vent

I got an achievement from me I won one hundred we're about to get jumped sauce, but it's literally so obvious

1811
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:37,980

1812
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:45,040

They seem to like you more than the dog

1824
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,480
I think they go for organic matter like a preference if you will

1825
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:10,640
Cuz I guess they killed all the humans. I

1826

Is it down an alley way that we haven't been down maybe?

1855
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Fizzy juice not in there

1856
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,840
That's the way up

Feel like I've scoured the area for a vending machine. It's inside Momo's apartment. Oh

1863
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,600
Yeah, that's a new unlock isn't it

1864
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:53,160

1865
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:56,120
That's that guy

Slip through the gap the van. Oh, sorry, it's not even open

Slip through the gap in the door with the bars in it that Samus's apartment oops

1873
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,880
Momo's apartment

1874
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:04,060
Is that the one that was up

1875
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:09,520
Must be because we were doing rooftop scale in in order to get any of those

1876
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,240
Wow slip through the bars

1877

I'm gonna go back over to that roof

1915
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:17,340
Just because I didn't really explore that side of the map because I did the quest and then I was off on one

1916
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:21,240
I'm on the wrong way

1917

1923
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,760
Just to see if there's like any rooftop that

02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:08,440
Looks accessible that I've not jumped up one. I

1934
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:08,520
The final energy drink location is on the rooftops of the slums to start head up the rooftops and find

1935
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:10,120
Heptor

1936
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:13,840
He's sitting on a little bucket next to a sofa

1937
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:17,120
Near the robots for a chucking pain

1938
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,760
Old man

1939
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:31,040
Maybe he's up here jump

1940
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,080

Are you hip-tor? No, you're swan. I could name those like real constellations a big circle of the ball

1943
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:52,280
No need more brain-throwing. Hey, yeah, what do you want nothing? I'm sorry

1944
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,640

02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,760

1946
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:10,480
And then need to find that gentleman. Oh, please go up. Thank you darling

Okay, I faint him okay now that I found him hold on

1948
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:33,440
From hip-tor hi hip-tor followed the little wooden ramp to the left

1949
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:46,560
Look down to spot a balcony below you

1950
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,800
The

1951
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:56,600
Right the final vending machine is on the balcony, so make your way down

1952
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:01,280
The ramp was immediately

1953
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:07,160
Oh my god, that's so obscure

1954
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:10,440
That is so obscure

1955
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,480
Development team you should be ashamed of yourself. How is anyone supposed to find that?

1956
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:19,400
At least make it possible if you're gonna do things like that

1957
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:22,720
Okay, now we can buy the last memory

1958
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:30,680
Shop we need the shop

1959
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:35,880
Why some music go

1960
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:43,240
Agreed that was painful to find I

1961
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:48,000
Could not have done that I would not have been able to do that if you guys didn't tell me in spec

1962
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:55,000
Well again, what do you want now? This is an ancient relic. I will cost three energy drinks one

1963
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:59,160
Here you go, what is it?

1964
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:02,840
Remember

1965
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:05,360
The box were to help

1966
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:12,960
This is an early model of a companion back then they didn't have any personality. They were just glorified autonomous cleaners

1967
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:20,880
I think it's nice that the eventually mimic human is quickly missed them and in that way they kind of kept them from going extinct

1968
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
They're good robots

1969
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:28,880
Okay, we did it and then we'll go our last song. I don't know what it's gonna be, but let's find out. I

1970
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:34,240
Don't know if we can make a song of it or if it's gonna be like hi

1971
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:38,240
Oh, thank you for the music. I will practice you see

1972
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:40,920
Yeah, I got the last one

1973
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:47,720
Well done. Have a badge as a token of my gratitude gained an item. Let's see. What's the last please?

1974
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:53,480
Petit vals qua qua vals en anglais

1975
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:00,920
Petit small something. I don't know what vals is. Alright something small. Okay, we're gonna sing about something small. Okay, you ready?

1976
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:04,760
Or does anyone want to give me the translation before I go to

1977
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,200
Petit and then VALSE any

1978
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:10,660
French refling

1979
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:16,900
No, we're not doing SPH. That's for another location

1980
02:39:19,820 --> 02:39:22,820
Not one French refling lurking for Belgium is

1981
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:28,740
French for the little walls. Okay, let's go. Okay a dance. Okay a small dance

1982
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:48,820
As I slowly lean from left to right, I ask you please dance with me tonight

1983
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:58,100
We sway together under the moon and together we enjoy our month of gin

1984
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:05,900
It's already gone and July is here and I wouldn't have it any other way

1985
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:12,820
Thank you all done

1986
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:18,740
Thank you for all that. I'm a great musician now. Yeah, thank you

1987
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:22,020
Okay, we're ready to go

1988
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:28,140
Uncle uncle. Merci. Okay. I think I'll finish this area now because we did what we did

1989
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:33,420
All right, let me just remember the old controls for the old light

1990
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:40,620
Okay, I think we just loaded into another area and that's why it did that and I'm not about to be violently chasing

1991
02:40:40,660 --> 02:40:42,660
by a hundred of those bills

1992
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:48,180
Hello, Momo. Are you going to see your friends?

1993
02:40:49,860 --> 02:40:51,860
Oh, I understand

1994
02:40:54,020 --> 02:40:59,460
I can't believe you found docking and no with this now we can go find zons of all

1995
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:02,660
Oh, no

1996
02:41:03,220 --> 02:41:07,540
Will this dream be another seven every one? I'm not gonna 100% in this game now

1997
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:10,660
I'm I already walked past like a few a couple of memories

1998
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:13,860
Um

1999
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:17,940
Stormi I have a question who in the fresh heck curse she be to become a muppet

2000
02:41:19,060 --> 02:41:21,140
What does that mean? I don't know what I mean

2001
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:27,140
Oh, we're in a new location. Okay. I don't know what chapter we're on. I don't know how many there are but

2002
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:29,860
progress question mark

2003
02:41:30,820 --> 02:41:34,500
Yeah, starting if you use the purple beam you get a heat meter

2004
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:38,180
a reasonable length stream by stroney who

2005
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:44,740
Shebe's avatar is um, is she is she does is she's streaming not on her model lmao?

2006
02:41:52,420 --> 02:41:59,140
When the moon hips you're high like a big piece of high

2007
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:01,940
So

2008
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:25,140
She looks like a child's guardian character in stray the sirre section is found in chapter six of the game

2009
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:27,860
Uh

2010
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:30,180
Okay

2011
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:35,380
Can you look on the other side sure of course, uh, right just look on the other side of the gate

2012
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:37,540
Well, I can only jump on one platform. So

2013
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:42,100
I'm gonna jump through the bars. Dang. I've got skills

2014
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:50,500
Uh, huh gets up from over here. Don't think I don't see your devious plans video game. I can read right through you

2015
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:53,540
go across up and across

2016
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:57,540
And basically three more chapters to go. Oh, we steam it. We steam rolling

2017
02:42:58,420 --> 02:43:00,420
We jump straight

2018
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:02,500
Yeah

2019
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:04,500
right in front

2020
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,500
Uh anything up here

2021
02:43:07,060 --> 02:43:09,060
I don't want to jump down in case it's not

2022
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:13,220
Came to jump down. I know I'm about to get jumped by those xx. Sorry video games

2023
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:16,500
But you make it too obvious. How do I open the gate? I'm a cat

2024
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:22,340
What buttons am I supposed to mash to open? Oh, I see the lever behind the xx

2025
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:24,180
Mm-hmm

2026
02:43:24,180 --> 02:43:26,180
Just do it

2027
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:28,900
Exactly get out of here

2028
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:33,620
I knew it. I knew you dastardly planned

2029
02:43:35,460 --> 02:43:37,460
I knew your plan. Oh, no

2030
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:43,620
Oh, no, it's can be. Oh wait am I safe up here? Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so smart

2031
02:43:46,820 --> 02:43:51,300
Take this. Yeah, that's right. We can do better. Mmm. You're gonna pop

2032
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:54,740
That's right

2033
02:43:55,300 --> 02:44:01,220
I can see your video game. I know your plans. I know your development team. I've played far too many video games to be

2034
02:44:02,340 --> 02:44:07,700
To be outsmarted with such dukes. How do you meow? That's right. Exactly. Mm-hmm

2035
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:10,340
Not one enemy in sight. I'm just

2036
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:16,420
How do you even insult me? Are you gonna pick me up, please?

2037
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:18,980
Please pick me up

2038
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:20,980
Meow, please pick me up

2039
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,180
Can I jump on you jump? Okay

2040
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:30,980
I don't understand if I don't directly talk to you and the thing doesn't translate for me

2041
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:33,620
Johnny you always make us

2042
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:36,740
That has to smell so bad

2043
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:41,380
What smells worse me when I'm pheromone maxing or like

2044
02:44:43,060 --> 02:44:46,420
Exploding when coming into contact with uv raises that replay

2045
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:49,380
Bruh rump maxers any rump

2046
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:54,660
You got them good meow. That's right. I'm supposed to be meow

2047
02:44:55,460 --> 02:44:57,460
Hey, what I can't even do

2048
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:00,020
Are you gonna jump on me?

2049
02:45:00,180 --> 02:45:04,740
Don't think I don't see you. Are they gonna jump on the boat? You better not

2050
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,900
Is it actually warning us it's about to jump down?

2051
02:45:11,380 --> 02:45:15,540
Or is it just welcoming us into its domain? Okay, I think it's just welcoming us

2052
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:18,980
Okay, let's see

2053
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:26,580
Good good new york meow. That's right. Okay today. We're playing story

2054
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:28,500
and

2055
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:30,420
I'm a cat

2056
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:32,420
I've got a uv array

2057
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:36,820
You stop jumping

2058
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:39,140
You stinky stinky

2059
02:45:39,860 --> 02:45:41,860
Zerks be like this is our tour

2060
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,660
Hey, get out of here

2061
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,220
Hey, mr. Jay

2062
02:45:47,220 --> 02:45:50,180
I'm Harley Quinn Zores. I can't meow

2063
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:56,820
Oh

2064
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:02,260
Uh, what's the situation momo?

2065
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:08,340
This is old machinery is broken now. I think we can only open it manually

2066
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:11,300
We

2067
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:18,260
Do you mean open it manually we're about to get jumped, you know that right?

2068
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:30,500
You're just walking them all up getting that boat. Is it me about to get jumped?

2069
02:46:32,660 --> 02:46:38,900
I'm so even though we have protection. Oh wait. Oh no, I have to go on my own

2070
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:45,300
It's the end of the ride. Oh, I need to go more. I'm sorry. He's holding it open for me

2071
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,740
Uh, I can't go with you, but uh

2072
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:56,420
I won't stop looking for a way when you find zanzibar and clementine tell them I was brave. You're relax momo. You're not dying

2073
02:46:57,300 --> 02:47:00,420
If anyone's dying, it's fucking me. Look at this place

2074
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:03,700
Oh my god, it's not letting me run

2075
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:05,780
Why would you not let me run?

2076
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:08,100
Don't do such things on me

2077
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:23,780
Maybe one month we won't we'll beat the peeler allegations, but this month is not that month

2078
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:28,180
Thank you for the tip really legend

2079
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:32,100
Why why are we peeing on main? What's going on?

2080
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:38,900
Um, wait, I can't go in that. That's murky water. Wait, so what was I supposed to do here? Is really a secret?

2081
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:43,780
Can I pop these?

2082
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:49,940
Um, was there even anything?

2083
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:59,860
Wait, no, this is the dead end. Is the water shallow and it just looks like it's not or am I going crazy?

2084
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:04,900
Yeah

2085
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:13,700
Uh

2086
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:19,940
Were they gonna pop as I walked past I think

2087
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:24,500
Remind me who started the allegations. I actually don't know

2088
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:32,820
No, we must move through the stagnant pee water on a plate. Look at the menacingly looking at me

2089
02:48:32,820 --> 02:48:37,060
They don't know that I'm I've got a strap. I'm built carry. You know, I'm saying I'm carrying right now

2090
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:40,980
No, no, no, I saw it. I can see a bend. It's a secret. It must

2091
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:53,300
Yeah, you better be better be watching out for me. I'm a jumpy

2092
02:48:54,980 --> 02:48:58,580
I'm a murder you and I'm gonna make a little like an accident

2093
02:49:00,820 --> 02:49:02,820
Okay, these are active

2094
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:08,180
Hold on

2095
02:49:11,700 --> 02:49:13,700
So like how their butts get open

2096
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:19,620
Wasn't that in me with her drinking stream where chat blackmailed her into recording that is that where it starts?

2097
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:22,340
Oh

2098
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:27,460
My my little sister isn't so innocent anymore. She can

2099
02:49:30,980 --> 02:49:32,980
Okay

2100
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:36,980
I didn't mean to activate another one but fine. It's fine

2101
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:40,980
Try not to overheat it too much

2102
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:46,980
I can do it like that and just kind of see someone as they come

2103
02:49:49,860 --> 02:49:51,860
I

2104
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:55,700
Think emmy is more likely to do it and she be no different not that one

2105
02:49:55,940 --> 02:50:00,980
I know it was just sort of a throwaway line, but I can't get an idea of strongy pheromone max and out of my head

2106
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:05,940
Oh, it's because I'm fucking minion. Sorry, but I'm like an absolute like knee. I'm not being funny

2107
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:10,660
Like I didn't go outside if I don't need to go outside. I don't like

2108
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:16,580
I kind of discussed I don't even know if I should talk about it. You guys will be like so disgusted by it

2109
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:18,900
but like

2110
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:23,060
I don't even wear deodorant because I'm gonna go outside so it's like why it was the point of being deodorant

2111
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:27,140
Um

2112
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:30,020
But I hope my dad's not mad at me when he sees me

2113
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:34,740
He's gonna be like strongy. You're like shit and I'm like, yeah

2114
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:39,460
Oh, come on literally one

2115
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:41,540
I

2116
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:48,580
Hope one of the upcoming emotes is sniff. I mean if you want

2117
02:50:49,220 --> 02:50:52,420
Uh, I've got more than 10 like emotes slots

2118
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:59,140
Unlock how many heart mojis are there like what's the highest number it goes up to because that's how many emotes slots are unlocked

2119
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:03,060
But I'm not nice. There's so many

2120
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:12,180
15 okay, so I'm getting a batch of 10 and then I get an extra five and then if I make more then

2121
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:15,300
You know

2122
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:18,100
Yeah, I know I'm definitely open to that

2123
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:21,220
God this place is like

2124
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:28,900
Well, there is this how you're supposed to tackle these areas just this feels like cleaning simulator now a little bit just kind of like

2125
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:36,740
Oh, oh that guy popped in with

2126
02:51:39,220 --> 02:51:43,220
The hunger for the cat flash is okay the last couple of years from brothel everyone

2127
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:50,900
It's not even that I tried to be mingin or anything, but I just I'm mingin

2128
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:57,380
Like when I'm like when I say see is like, oh, I've not showered in a few days or whatever. I'm like, it's not a

2129
02:51:57,780 --> 02:52:03,700
Teehee. I'm so gross and nasty. It's like no, I ain't showered rough a fucking reek

2130
02:52:04,660 --> 02:52:06,660
I got be all out of the wazoo

2131
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:08,820
I've got greasy hair out of the wazoo

2132
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:13,860
That's a little it

2133
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:17,140
Yeah, if you don't sweat it's pretty okay

2134
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:22,740
Oh, no, I'm ready. Sorry, but I'm actually ready for you guys. I'm not being serious

2135
02:52:22,980 --> 02:52:24,980
I

2136
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:31,860
I'm so ready. I'm not scared anymore. I can hardly see anything by the way. I don't know why there's like a duff freaking

2137
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:35,940
Filler and of course it goes away the moment I complain about it because why wouldn't it?

2138
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:40,580
Okay, let's just let's just go next

2139
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,300
Yeah, that's right. You can't scare me now

2140
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:50,900
You can maybe jump scare me around a corner, but that's about it

2141
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:54,740
I

2142
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:56,980
Whoa

2143
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:59,060
Where are the eyes?

2144
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:03,940
Hold on. Hold on. This seems like a bit much. I don't think the torch can handle all of this

2145
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:17,140
There's no way I'm supposed to be being seen in Dungeon Mad down here

2146
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:19,620
Oh

2147
02:53:23,220 --> 02:53:28,260
Oh the game's lagging because it's loading a new area, right that's manageable

2148
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:36,740
Wow

2149
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:39,060
I

2150
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:47,460
Stony really gets stinky if I am I'm literally turning us all into Napoleon dynamite

2151
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:50,580
Can I go through here?

2152
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:54,980
I'm coming back in three days don't want

2153
02:53:57,060 --> 02:54:02,420
God it really does not oh the eyes are asleep on the wall

2154
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:06,580
I can't do anything to the eyes. Hmm

2155
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:11,940
I have to wash my hair every other day, but we don't seem to wash it off

2156
02:54:12,820 --> 02:54:15,460
Oh, I used to have really greasy hair

2157
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:20,740
And I would have to wash it every day like I'd wake up and it'd be fecking greasy and smooth

2158
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:27,460
But ever since I've been using lush shampoo bars, I actually get like a couple of days with it

2159
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:30,100
And which is really nice

2160
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:35,540
Um, so I can't recommend lush shampoo bars enough to be honest

2161
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:41,540
So if you're ever if you've got the money to treat yourself, it is a bit more expensive, but like

2162
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:46,820
As far as I'm aware they they pay their employees a bit more decently

2163
02:54:47,540 --> 02:54:51,060
Or probably publicity stunt. I have yet again fallen for you know, have you?

2164
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:53,540
Um

2165
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:56,340
Oh

2166
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:14,980
No, do not tap it. Okay. Sorry. I'll just test them because I keep overheating the poor guy, but

2167
02:55:16,260 --> 02:55:22,740
Just the should men use it. Yep. It's just a generic shampoo bar. It's called jumping juniper on the lush website

2168
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:27,940
It is literally, um, you put it on your head as you're in the shower or in the bath

2169
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:32,820
And it lathers up and then that's you dunzel. Um, open the door though

2170
02:55:33,700 --> 02:55:35,700
Oh hacker man, we're in

2171
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:40,820
Oh, we've done it now

2172
02:55:44,340 --> 02:55:46,340
What the

2173
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:49,300
Oh

2174
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:56,660
Is he gonna send an up? Okay. Yeah, he doesn't like it. I don't like it either

2175
02:55:58,900 --> 02:56:01,300
Oh my god, they just send more what the

2176
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:04,100
break

2177
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:13,140
Bruh, bruh, no, no, no, that's outrageous. Sorry. That's outrageous. Yeah, no wonder I'm fucking dead. What the fuck was that?

2178
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:18,740
I

2179
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:22,340
Saw is that was outrageous

2180
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:33,700
And it reloaded all of those freaking egg sacs that are in my way, so I need to destroy them all so I can get a clear

2181
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,740
And I'm gonna overheat again

2182
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:41,300
I

2183
02:56:44,420 --> 02:56:50,900
Huh, right, so what I need to do I need to be able to wait. I can't even run across there super easily

2184
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:54,020
I have to go down here and do a u-turn

2185
02:56:59,380 --> 02:57:01,380
That's ridiculous

2186
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:05,700
If you're gonna give me a battery that like

2187
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:10,980
I

2188
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:18,020
At least make it last that's all I'm asking seriously

2189
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:22,980
If you're gonna give a weapon to defend yourself, then you make like some fucking stupid ass

2190
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:25,700
map like that

2191
02:57:29,460 --> 02:57:33,620
I'm sure there's probably some tactics I've not figured out yet, but that was really annoying

2192
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:36,820
That was like, okay. Yeah, just keep sending it. Okay, great. Thanks

2193
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:49,060
All right, let's hopefully we don't mess up this time. I'll start on this end because why not and what difference does it make?

2194
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:55,300
He's already awake

2195
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:06,520
Hold on. Sorry, I'm tryharding. I'm actually tryharding

2196
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:15,220
I'm actually fucking tryharding and a fucking cat game. Please open the bloody thing

2197
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:23,860
Wait, I could just use these barrels and jump across and I've been done

2198
02:58:26,580 --> 02:58:28,580
I was those barrels not available

2199
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:33,460
Go right. You don't have to tell me twice to get the heck out. Oh for

2200
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:38,020
What and the F

2201
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:47,780
Hey, I'm feeling a bit intimidated as well. I ain't gonna lie

2202
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:53,300
We are being perceived

2203
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:05,700
I

2204
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:22,660
Uh, oh, please don't cut to me. Please don't cut to me. Oh, I cut to me and cut to me

2205
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:25,460
Oh

2206
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:33,220
I cut to me. Why did you cut? Why can't I not just have been a cute little cutscene?

2207
02:59:33,700 --> 02:59:39,140
Well, I've been to if it was just an adorable little cutscene of how fast I can run and I didn't have to do this section

2208
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:44,900
Oh, wouldn't that be adorable? Oh, that'd be so kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, kawaii-ne, so kawaii-ne

2209
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:47,540
Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii, kawaii

2210
02:59:47,540 --> 02:59:49,540
Oh

2211
02:59:56,260 --> 03:00:01,860
I'm literally just spam and be an anticipation of them launching onto my room and butt crack

2212
03:00:02,820 --> 03:00:04,820
Please

2213
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:10,260
Please don't make me frickin go back. Don't make me do that again. Oh god

2214
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:17,540
That was awful. Can we get an upgrade on the duration of this little bad boy, please?

2215
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:24,500
Wake up. Don't leave me alone. Please. I'm too scared to play this game alone now that I have you

2216
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:28,900
Literally be 12 more like be reflin get it?

2217
03:00:29,780 --> 03:00:33,860
It was dark. I was alone. I felt like I was back in the network, but you saved me

2218
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:37,460
Thank you friend. Enjoying that much power was rough on my core. The defluxer is completely

2219
03:00:40,260 --> 03:00:46,580
I was just praising this game for freaking not having to run away

2220
03:00:50,820 --> 03:00:57,620
I'm stressed. I thought this was supposed to be a cute cat game and I'm so stressed

2221
03:00:58,980 --> 03:01:02,340
Wait, you didn't hack it. Oh, you did hack it. Hold on. Oh, let's go before the fan goes on

2222
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:04,900
Right, so we are

2223
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:10,500
It's a flying refling. Yeah, you're literally gated me through the game. Yeah, yucky toxic

2224
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:16,660
Okay, we can't say remember we can't say we can't say

2225
03:01:21,700 --> 03:01:25,780
Oh, hello friend, that means no enemies. Hello

2226
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:28,820
Oh, hi, yo

2227
03:01:29,140 --> 03:01:34,260
A traveler from the sewers you haven't seen one of you in ages. Are you the one who contacted? Yes. I'm little

2228
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:39,700
Zanzibar the outsider has been expecting you. He's meditating at the top of her village

2229
03:01:41,540 --> 03:01:43,540
Whoa

2230
03:01:46,580 --> 03:01:48,580
Huh

2231
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:54,660
Wait, can they see the can they see the sky? Oh, sorry, we're gonna cut scene my apologies

2232
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:02,420
I am sure that would be the last of them surely copium

2233
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:10,500
Uh praying that the fluxer can be fixed the machine the scientist I insisted used one of these

2234
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:20,900
He was sick. This was the last hope he walked into the machine, but I wasn't with him. He was alone. What was he doing?

2235
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:27,700
Cryopods he uploaded himself into the computer and then everything was different

2236
03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:29,860
The

2237
03:02:31,540 --> 03:02:33,540
Bots aren't bots at all. They're humans

2238
03:02:35,460 --> 03:02:42,820
But the upload something went wrong. He was stuck for hundreds of years until a little cat appeared you

2239
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:47,060
You're a human in a bot

2240
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:55,860
Oh, no, he got a dolly zoom effect. It was me. I was the scientist

2241
03:02:57,700 --> 03:02:59,700
I was human

2242
03:03:02,100 --> 03:03:05,380
I need a moment. Oh, you are human

2243
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:14,740
Maybe the world was dying so you had the choice to become a ball

2244
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:18,740
Hello

2245
03:03:19,380 --> 03:03:21,380
Oh, you're covered in paint

2246
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:24,020
Scratch board

2247
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:26,740
Hello, oh, what are you playing?

2248
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:34,820
What is this? Mahjong? Mahjong? Oh like they've got a little spot for me to play. Can I play?

2249
03:03:38,020 --> 03:03:41,220
I'm so sorry. Oh, no, I'm so sorry

2250
03:03:42,580 --> 03:03:46,500
Are you actually mad at me? Can I make it up to you? Can I rub against your leg? I'm sorry

2251
03:03:47,140 --> 03:03:50,100
Oh, no, they're actually picking up the pieces. I'm so sorry

2252
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:54,020
Sorry, it wasn't my intention

2253
03:03:54,980 --> 03:03:56,980
Member? Oh, we've got a member

2254
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:02,900
You render scrabble? I'm so cat-like. I'm sorry. I

2255
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:07,300
I need a moment. I don't feel like talking right now. Okay

2256
03:04:09,300 --> 03:04:13,940
Yeah, that's probably a lot to process. I'm not gonna lie

2257
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:21,300
That's a unique tea tree top. Maybe we don't need a farm roof lens. Maybe we just need a tree top

2258
03:04:24,020 --> 03:04:30,740
And we can all have different levels and stuff. Although I might get a bit chilly. So I think we'd I think maybe the farm would keep us warm

2259
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:34,020
I think a tree top open like this would be too cold

2260
03:04:36,020 --> 03:04:38,020
What else have I forgotten?

2261
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:44,260
I must have had parents friends. What happened to everyone? I wanted to open the city

2262
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:50,580
But is there anyone else left to save? Oh, don't doubt your mission now soldier. Oh wait, we need to find this, sorry

2263
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:58,980
Zanzibar, we need to talk to you friend wherever you are. Oh, you're bloody Zanzibar. He's a hippie

2264
03:05:01,140 --> 03:05:03,140
Oh, they got the fortune cat teller

2265
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:08,340
That's it. I'm getting Chinese. Where's my Chinese auntie? What is this?

2266
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:12,260
I've got a jump scare

2267
03:05:12,980 --> 03:05:14,980
Eh?

2268
03:05:15,780 --> 03:05:19,940
This is Zanzibar. Hey, don't you know not to interrupt a fellow during his

2269
03:05:21,220 --> 03:05:22,740
Transcendental

2270
03:05:22,740 --> 03:05:24,340
Transcendental

2271
03:05:24,340 --> 03:05:30,340
Meditation. Oh, it's you. You're with Momo when we received that call earlier. I'm glad to meet you at last little outsider

2272
03:05:30,340 --> 03:05:36,900
Eh, that's in you. You know Momo and Doc. So you're already familiar with those outsiders. I miss them. Their memories bring me peace

2273
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:42,740
Momo stayed in the slums. I heard you helped find the doctor and clementime

2274
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:45,860
She's in midtown now. If you still want to see the outside

2275
03:05:46,340 --> 03:05:48,340
She's the one you can go to

2276
03:05:48,580 --> 03:05:50,580
You that can get you there

2277
03:05:50,980 --> 03:05:57,380
Apparently she had some kind of plan to leave the city here. Now take this. I wrote her address on the back of this picture

2278
03:05:58,900 --> 03:06:04,020
Okay, I'm sorry. I just teared myself in on that mono-controller hydration check

2279
03:06:06,900 --> 03:06:13,700
To reach midtown claim up our little village. It should be easy for your oh for a dexterous one like you

2280
03:06:14,820 --> 03:06:19,700
If you manage to reach the outside you will be the very first. I wish you good luck, but you don't need it

2281
03:06:19,780 --> 03:06:21,780
I believe in you. Oh

2282
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:24,500
Does he predict that we make it?

2283
03:06:25,380 --> 03:06:29,620
I'm sorry for shutting down earlier. I'm human probably the last in the world

2284
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:34,580
Now look what's left of me so much has come back to me. How much have I forgotten?

2285
03:06:34,820 --> 03:06:40,420
Maybe if we find clementime, we can restore my memories and get you back home at the same time

2286
03:06:40,580 --> 03:06:45,220
We can go back down and find out more from the companions or head onwards

2287
03:06:46,980 --> 03:06:48,980
um

2288
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:52,340
I think we just press onwards to be honest

2289
03:06:53,460 --> 03:06:55,300
I know you can

2290
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:59,700
Someone said you can a hundred percent this game if it's like just hundred percent with memories like

2291
03:07:00,740 --> 03:07:02,740
Sorry, I've gone it. She knows

2292
03:07:03,700 --> 03:07:08,420
The Japanese golden cat also known as the beckoning cat typically depicted as a cat with one piece

2293
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:11,140
Paul raised believe to bring good luck and fortune to them

2294
03:07:12,580 --> 03:07:14,260
Oh, we can play darts

2295
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:17,300
I'm thinking it'd be a bit hard. I don't have a poseable thumb

2296
03:07:17,620 --> 03:07:18,820
Hi

2297
03:07:18,820 --> 03:07:25,780
What we cooking back here good-looking all the boulder recipes. That's so smart. Honestly. That's so smart

2298
03:07:26,820 --> 03:07:28,820
All right, you ain't getting that idea. I don't even

2299
03:07:28,820 --> 03:07:30,820
know

2300
03:07:31,060 --> 03:07:33,060
Uh, where was that ladder? I just saw other

2301
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:39,700
It's also just nice to chat with the people if we aren't going for a hundred percent

2302
03:07:41,620 --> 03:07:44,740
Maybe I should maybe I should be a bit more social in this game

2303
03:07:45,860 --> 03:07:50,580
Okay, let's talk to the next person. Oh, you're a gardener. You're a leafling

2304
03:07:52,180 --> 03:07:56,740
Hello, buddy. How are you? Did you know that aunt clementine taught us how to grow?

2305
03:07:57,540 --> 03:08:03,380
Special plants that can live without sunlight. I have a huge collection. Do you want to see I still miss some of the colors though

2306
03:08:03,700 --> 03:08:04,580
I miss

2307
03:08:04,580 --> 03:08:08,980
Seeing a yellow a red and a purple. It's only someone small and agile. Okay. Okay

2308
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:13,300
I get it. No, I don't think I can get it for you

2309
03:08:14,340 --> 03:08:16,340
There are you

2310
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:22,500
I'm bored aunt clement used to hold classes. We learned so much cool stuff. Maybe you'll learn anything now

2311
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:24,500
Please

2312
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:26,580
Don't you that made that noise?

2313
03:08:31,460 --> 03:08:37,540
I hear in that I'm getting trolled by this game. I guess if I claim up that's not where I'm supposed to go

2314
03:08:40,580 --> 03:08:42,580
There's a bucket of paint

2315
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:48,100
Wait that's how we're coloring the flowers with paint

2316
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:52,100
Anyone let me go across

2317
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:55,380
Oh, well, no

2318
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:57,940
You want paint?

2319
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:03,460
Is this um, I just trash in the place because I don't understand what I'm doing

2320
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:08,900
Up up

2321
03:09:09,220 --> 03:09:11,620
Oh, that was the last the food I could talk to

2322
03:09:12,260 --> 03:09:15,860
Literally the last tip. I'll be more social the last two people. Bye

2323
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,980
I'm not getting you your flowers

2324
03:09:19,380 --> 03:09:24,500
Uh, we're getting a bit dangerous. I don't like this

2325
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:30,340
Please be careful little munchkin. You're making me nervous claiming this high

2326
03:09:32,260 --> 03:09:34,260
Okay, okay, I see

2327
03:09:35,940 --> 03:09:39,460
Knocking things over because she can I have become one with the cat

2328
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:46,600
I know I'm not fired because I say meow that's not how it works

2329
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:52,260
Uh, okay, it still looks safe. Is there like any

2330
03:09:53,060 --> 03:09:58,580
Memory things behind this video games love to spawn you in and be like oh, there's a hidden thing by the way

2331
03:09:59,380 --> 03:10:04,020
Right behind you. We've made it really obvious. Oh, please no enemies

2332
03:10:05,620 --> 03:10:08,180
Okay, I don't see the orange yet. I just see orange clore

2333
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:14,660
What's the daily over in a subway subway? Yes

2334
03:10:14,660 --> 03:10:23,060
Tell me what's up. Tell me what you're remembering. You remember going to work

2335
03:10:28,180 --> 03:10:33,140
Look, this is the subway station. I have completely forgotten this kind of transportation existed

2336
03:10:33,380 --> 03:10:36,580
You could write to anywhere in the city people used to take it to go to work

2337
03:10:36,660 --> 03:10:41,700
I used to take it to every morning after saying goodbye to my family at home. So you do remember

2338
03:10:42,500 --> 03:10:46,100
I remember I was doing this for them, but they're gone now. It was so long ago

2339
03:10:46,580 --> 03:10:50,100
Yeah, that's probably really rough waking up and being like all your families pop off

2340
03:10:50,500 --> 03:10:55,540
They wanted to see the outside, but does that even matter anymore? What happened to them? What happened to everyone?

2341
03:10:56,420 --> 03:10:59,700
I think it's all went into robots and all robots were technical demons

2342
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:02,020
I don't know

2343
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:06,500
Anyway, we're near midtown now. Let's find this climbing town. We have a picture of her

2344
03:11:06,820 --> 03:11:11,620
We can show it to some of the companions around here. Maybe the point is in the right direction

2345
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:16,100
Wow, okay, we just need climbing time

2346
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:20,180
Wow

2347
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:24,340
My beloved furry tripper. No, no quite

2348
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:30,740
Can we tell the train to go? No

03:11:31,700 --> 03:11:34,340
Chichi out my own meow meow

You know, Q. 3, 6, then new school. Wow. Hello

Charing test literacy the ethics of artificial intelligence. I recognize some of these that I have a library

2356
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:09,660
I remember nothing was quite like the smell of books as a kind of page

2357
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:13,940
It was a feeling almost like comfort a book was like spending time with someone

2358
03:12:15,220 --> 03:12:18,200
That's a you know. Whoa. I've missed that many blue memories. Oops

2602
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:51,200

03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:26,320
That this merchant sold me a faulty battery the other day

2642
03:37:26,320 --> 03:37:29,200
No, he just pretends not to hear me every time I try to confront him

2643
03:37:29,600 --> 03:37:34,480
If it wasn't for the sentinels on patrol, he'd end up with spare parts. Honestly, that's not true

2644
03:37:36,640 --> 03:37:41,760
I was really gonna speak right there. Oh, he's not gonna move. I can do what I want behind here then translate

2658
03:38:37,760 --> 03:38:39,760
Well, he didn't react

2659
03:38:40,720 --> 03:38:42,720

Um, I have stolen hello, can you tell me where to go?

2661
03:38:50,160 --> 03:38:52,160
I'd like one conversation

2662
03:38:52,240 --> 03:38:57,840
Hmm consider this tomorrow if you replace my arm with another robotic arm and then next another arm too

2663
03:38:58,400 --> 03:39:00,400
Why is this book how to be a ninja?

2664
03:39:01,440 --> 03:39:05,920
And then my body and so on until it you I've replaced all my parts and upgrades my software

2665
03:39:05,920 --> 03:39:09,680
Will I be the same robot? You're talking to them. We're getting philosophical. Hmm

2666
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:13,200
Uh

2667
03:39:13,200 --> 03:39:16,320
No, you're too philosophical to tell me what to do. I see

2668
03:39:20,160 --> 03:39:22,160
Theus robot

2669
03:39:25,520 --> 03:39:32,000
Hello, will you tell me what to do, please? Of course enough. Oh, he's getting pulled off

2670
03:39:32,480 --> 03:39:34,480
I

2671
03:39:34,880 --> 03:39:39,760
Told you five times you all she can't run around like that as dangerous. Hey, this is the first time seen this kind of robot

2672
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:41,440
You're so fluffy

2673
03:39:41,440 --> 03:39:46,560
Oh a guy wearing a bomber jacket and a gold chain. I don't know what you talked about you can check

2674
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:56,400
A bomber jacket wait, so I'm to look for someone in a bomber jacket with a gold chain and give them the note

2675
03:39:56,480 --> 03:39:58,480
Okay, I can do that

2676
03:39:58,800 --> 03:40:00,800
I

2677
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:04,960
Bomber jacket and a gold chain, not you wait you've got a chain around your neck

2678
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:20,480
What uh truly makes a robot unique if it's ones and zeros can it so be duplicated

2679
03:40:22,400 --> 03:40:24,400
You you look

2680
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:26,640
You

2681
03:40:26,720 --> 03:40:28,000
Yeah

2682
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:35,920
I'm busy. What do you want get me in? Where did you get that? You're my contact? Oh, you're without my contact

2683
03:40:36,160 --> 03:40:38,240
Let me make it brief

2684
03:40:38,240 --> 03:40:42,800
You oh, sorry. Let me breathe my brain just completely just made up a sentence. I wasn't even there

2685
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:45,680
Let me brief you about the atomic battery

2686
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:52,560
The battery is powering the necocorp factory right there

2687
03:40:52,880 --> 03:40:59,760
But this whole area is restricted and heavily guarded. They check every person who enters and turns away anyone who is not a worker

2688
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:04,400
Here's the knife

2689
03:41:04,400 --> 03:41:07,040
Okay, am I doing everything backwards?

2690
03:41:08,240 --> 03:41:12,880
Am I was I supposed to talk to him first and then grab all this stuff because I've already got it

2691
03:41:12,880 --> 03:41:14,880
I keep like stumbling

2692
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:18,320
You'll never guess. Yeah, you know, I've got you this perfect

2693
03:41:19,280 --> 03:41:21,280
Yes, I have it too

2694
03:41:21,840 --> 03:41:24,240
I'll get dressed now mine turning around sure

2695
03:41:25,680 --> 03:41:29,600
I keep stumbling into the plot. This is amazing. I like this game

2696
03:41:29,920 --> 03:41:35,680
I like games that let you accidentally progress without meaning it. These are great a little snug around the waistline build it

2697
03:41:35,680 --> 03:41:38,960
Okay, hop in the box. I'll sneak you across the checkpoint. Okay, got it

2698
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:42,240
I'll take it

2699
03:41:42,240 --> 03:41:44,240
Oh and sorry

2700
03:41:44,800 --> 03:41:46,800
The unintentionally speedrunning

2701
03:41:47,040 --> 03:41:50,800
I mean, I like freaking I like games that let you accidentally progress

2702
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:55,920
Like the one thing I dislike about assassin's creed brotherhood is you don't have access to the entire map

2703
03:41:56,400 --> 03:42:01,920
Which is frustrating because it would be nice if you could do like all the borja towers in one swoop

2704
03:42:02,240 --> 03:42:04,800
But you would be very op at the start of the game

2705
03:42:04,880 --> 03:42:09,840
But I like games that give you access to the full thing and don't like hold back or anything

2706
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:12,160
Oh

2707
03:42:13,680 --> 03:42:17,280
I'm being inspected hold on inspection ASMR

2708
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:24,000
Okay

2709
03:42:32,640 --> 03:42:35,280
Oh, there's freaking robots I can see me hold on

2710
03:42:36,240 --> 03:42:38,240
Oh

2711
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:44,720
No, right. Okay. I understand. I understand. I understand

2712
03:42:46,240 --> 03:42:48,720
I'm in a box I can hide in there's one right there

2713
03:42:53,520 --> 03:42:55,520
Oh fuck send it send it

2714
03:42:57,600 --> 03:43:00,720
Hiding the box I need to see okay. That was lucky

2715
03:43:02,160 --> 03:43:04,160
That one on the bridge is blocking me

2716
03:43:05,520 --> 03:43:07,520
Oh

2717
03:43:07,760 --> 03:43:11,920
I see the barrels. Okay. I see the barrels my apologies. I see them to the left to the left

I lost the keys to this place in the dark and huge factory

2722
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:32,960
The senators refused to help me. They told me if no place to go more work here

2723
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:40,880
If by any chance you could help me find that might be so grateful. Yeah, cool. How far did you drop it?

2724
03:43:41,680 --> 03:43:43,680
This place is very

2725
03:43:44,080 --> 03:43:46,080
Oh, no

2726
03:43:49,360 --> 03:43:53,280
You just do the same thing, okay, okay, okay

Unlocked more sentries

2733
03:44:32,320 --> 03:44:36,080
So real let's play or choose how you want to play just options for handholding. Yeah

2734
03:44:37,280 --> 03:44:39,280
I can't get back

2735
03:44:39,760 --> 03:44:41,760
I can get back on this side

2736
03:44:46,880 --> 03:44:49,360
Yeah, so I can be detected a little bit

2737
03:44:49,760 --> 03:44:59,040
Okay, okay, okay next one and then run to the left got it got it got it

2749
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,400
Oh that okay, okay

2750
03:46:28,320 --> 03:46:30,320
What was that

2751
03:46:34,080 --> 03:46:36,080
I'm in the headquarters

2752
03:46:36,720 --> 03:46:40,880
Stony trial try hard with my trial game. I don't want to step on

2753
03:46:47,600 --> 03:46:49,600
Oh, no, it's a puzzle

2754
03:46:51,680 --> 03:46:53,680
Turn on

2755
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:13,280
Wait, what? Oh no, I actually have to do a puzzle. Oh jump over here. Okay

2756
03:47:17,440 --> 03:47:19,440
Okay

2757
03:47:21,280 --> 03:47:23,280
Oh, there's another one. Okay, okay, okay

2758
03:47:24,720 --> 03:47:29,120
How do I turn it on? Oh, I sorry. I meant how did I get out right?

2759
03:47:29,520 --> 03:47:36,240
Okay, so come yeah, and then you come on this one

2760
03:47:38,080 --> 03:47:40,080
And then you stop

2761
03:47:40,720 --> 03:47:42,720
And then you come with me

2762
03:47:44,720 --> 03:47:48,720
And then you'll lift up the barrel with your weight

2763
03:47:50,720 --> 03:47:54,720
And then I can roll the barrel over the fumatic tube type thing

2764
03:47:54,720 --> 03:48:03,120
Yeah, and then that's all three done. You know for a cat. I'm awfully smart to even have this perception

2765
03:48:05,360 --> 03:48:07,360
Stony move hiding in a box

2766
03:48:12,400 --> 03:48:18,160
The part we need can I just take it? Okay, I was gonna say um

2767
03:48:18,400 --> 03:48:20,400
Oh

2768
03:48:21,040 --> 03:48:23,040
Production line stopped

2769
03:48:23,600 --> 03:48:25,600
We're taking down the high table

2770
03:48:26,960 --> 03:48:31,840
We've got it quick. Let's go here through the centre of the shop. We've got this battery back to clementine

2771
03:48:33,680 --> 03:48:35,680
Is this about to be a run sequence?

2772
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:40,000
Oh, no, we're fine. Oh

2773
03:48:41,040 --> 03:48:43,040
Oh, that's a smooth criminal

2774
03:48:43,520 --> 03:48:46,160
You've been hit there. Hey, you've been struck there

2775
03:48:46,720 --> 03:48:48,720
A smooth criminal

2776
03:48:51,760 --> 03:48:53,760
Where the heck is clementine

2777
03:48:55,280 --> 03:49:01,600
Uh in the apartment complex which it wasn't down here was it?

2778
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:07,280
Or was it I spoke to someone around here. Yes

2779
03:49:09,280 --> 03:49:12,880
I need the beatboxer guy like the three guys at the apartment

2780
03:49:14,000 --> 03:49:16,000
Not there

2781
03:49:16,720 --> 03:49:18,720
Where wait

2782
03:49:21,440 --> 03:49:23,440
It's done there

2783
03:49:24,560 --> 03:49:27,440
Do you think the criminals eyeing my collection of vintage cars?

2784
03:49:29,120 --> 03:49:31,120
I don't know what happens

2785
03:49:32,240 --> 03:49:34,240
Nothing makes sense if we can't done

2786
03:49:35,360 --> 03:49:38,240
We're locked off right we're gonna have to go an alternative route

2787
03:49:39,440 --> 03:49:42,000
I assume is what this is pointing to

2788
03:49:42,480 --> 03:49:48,480
We're taking down the high-bot table. Honestly who would have thought the cat would finish through a John Wick started

2789
03:49:50,320 --> 03:49:53,520
I need to like climb off. Yeah

2790
03:49:57,440 --> 03:49:59,440
What is so neon

2791
03:50:00,560 --> 03:50:02,560
My little gamer eyes can't handle it right now

2792
03:50:05,840 --> 03:50:07,840
I really be oh remember, okay

2793
03:50:12,640 --> 03:50:17,920
This spot is nice what I wouldn't give to actually feel the softness of the pillows or the taste of a cold drink

2794
03:50:18,320 --> 03:50:21,840
This drone is useful, but I miss having my own body. I miss feeling. I miss

2795
03:50:22,480 --> 03:50:28,480
Hurting I miss being hungry. I know this isn't helping, but what if we stayed just a little longer? Thanks for listening. I'm ready now

2796
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:31,040
Oh little buddy. It's okay

2797
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:36,000
Is this gonna put me down it is

2798
03:50:37,840 --> 03:50:39,440
Hmm

2799
03:50:39,440 --> 03:50:43,040
I don't know how to get into this apartment complex. It's been cut off by the polis

2800
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:48,480
To see police. I it's actually Gaelic

2801
03:50:49,280 --> 03:50:51,280
and Scott Slang

2802
03:50:51,440 --> 03:50:53,440
Polis is the same

2803
03:50:53,600 --> 03:50:55,840
Yeah, I'm just getting further away from the complex

2804
03:50:58,400 --> 03:51:01,600
Unless I'm to go up here. Hold on wait, maybe I was on the right track

2805
03:51:04,880 --> 03:51:07,040
Looks like I can climb up here question mark

2806
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:10,000
Not

2807
03:51:11,600 --> 03:51:12,800
Unless

2808
03:51:12,800 --> 03:51:18,000
I'm getting very turned around. I'm pretty sure the apartment complex is like eight miles that way. Let me in

2809
03:51:19,600 --> 03:51:21,600
Let me in

2810
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:24,160
Let me in

2811
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:29,920
I don't know what the downstairs neighbors are up to but keep hearing bugs on hammers

2812
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:32,880
Okay, that's definitely the one I'm supposed to know

2813
03:51:34,320 --> 03:51:36,320
Can we go anywhere?

2814
03:51:37,040 --> 03:51:38,160
No

2815
03:51:38,160 --> 03:51:40,160
Can I go up on that?

2816
03:51:40,800 --> 03:51:42,080
No

2817
03:51:42,080 --> 03:51:46,400
Right, right. I'm in the wrong direction. Hold on. Let's recalibrate our headings

2818
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:52,240
And if we can go down actually because I'm going the wrong way

2819
03:51:53,120 --> 03:51:57,040
I'll need to check out what the police are doing. I'll talk to all the people at the police the policemen

2820
03:51:57,760 --> 03:51:59,760
police

2821
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:01,760
Oh

2822
03:52:02,800 --> 03:52:04,800
My god

2823
03:52:04,800 --> 03:52:07,040
Uh, right you talk with

2824
03:52:07,920 --> 03:52:12,240
Hey, you think you can stop us from handling hanging an hour and six

2825
03:52:14,640 --> 03:52:17,040
All this work for nothing. What happened?

2826
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:28,080
I'm like looking for routes or anything but I'm being prepared

2827
03:52:28,320 --> 03:52:31,760
So does any reeflings know where I'm supposed to go?

2828
03:52:33,840 --> 03:52:36,320
There's bars I didn't there's no point in being inside it

2829
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:42,640
I want to say I have to take a right because honestly the game was designed for me to take a right

2830
03:52:43,920 --> 03:52:46,880
Hold on or maybe I can like go in here. No, I can't

2831
03:52:48,080 --> 03:52:53,280
You're awesome. There you go. It's hard to figure out like what the game wants you to do when you're

2832
03:52:53,680 --> 03:52:55,680
Then you know where to go

2833
03:52:55,760 --> 03:53:00,800
So because like obviously we can't really use the light theory right now. I was like, oh the light will guide you

2834
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:03,920
Really the thing's pointing them where I'm supposed to go

2835
03:53:05,920 --> 03:53:07,920
Danger

2836
03:53:08,160 --> 03:53:10,160
I don't believe I want to see it

2837
03:53:12,880 --> 03:53:14,880
Light theory isn't working right now

2838
03:53:16,800 --> 03:53:19,040
And none of those people are talking to me

2839
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:22,640
The meow will gauge you okay, hold on

2840
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:28,800
Yeah, I can't talk to you. I'll talk to the people in the bar. Maybe they'll tell me what's up. Hey, can you tell me where to go?

2841
03:53:30,560 --> 03:53:34,960
I've mastered every game that ever existed but can't figure out how this one am I not seeing the whole picture here

2842
03:53:37,200 --> 03:53:39,200
What game snooker

2843
03:53:42,400 --> 03:53:46,720
You need the you need the chalk is that what you need the snooker chalk

2844
03:53:47,440 --> 03:53:50,960
She's overthinking it so hard wait barriers

2845
03:53:54,080 --> 03:53:56,080
Oh for fuck's sake

2846
03:53:57,280 --> 03:53:59,280
Oh, there's sentinels hold on

2847
03:54:00,400 --> 03:54:02,400
Okay

2848
03:54:02,880 --> 03:54:04,880
Okay, what does it do?

2849
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:09,600
Of course, of course the tiny cat can slip under I'm sorry

2850
03:54:10,880 --> 03:54:13,200
That makes perfect sense and I'll honestly

2851
03:54:14,000 --> 03:54:16,000
I

2852
03:54:16,480 --> 03:54:21,680
Just like I need I forget I need to remember like I'm tiny and small and adorably cute

2853
03:54:30,960 --> 03:54:32,960
You don't move right

2854
03:54:37,840 --> 03:54:39,840
Do you look away

2855
03:54:41,040 --> 03:54:43,040
You do

2856
03:54:43,600 --> 03:54:49,040
What about you I saw you I think I've got time. I've not got time. That's not where I'm supposed to go

2857
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:05,200
Not here hold on have to use my brain hold on

2858
03:55:07,600 --> 03:55:09,600
Ready, where do you go?

2859
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:15,360
Okay, it's giving jump giving jump

2860
03:55:18,560 --> 03:55:22,480
Not really a jump is it uh, how'd I go out? Oh

2861
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:31,520
You move

2862
03:55:34,080 --> 03:55:36,080
You don't move okay, that's fine

2863
03:55:40,320 --> 03:55:42,320
Oh

2864
03:55:49,120 --> 03:55:51,120
Okay, we made it

2865
03:55:51,120 --> 03:55:58,080
That was a some stealth app that meant this game is actually really fair in its gameplay other than oh no, she's like what hello

2866
03:56:02,400 --> 03:56:04,400
Is she up there

2867
03:56:06,880 --> 03:56:08,880
She must be up there

2868
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:11,280
Or she left me a note being like I've popped my clogs

2869
03:56:18,880 --> 03:56:20,880
Uh

2870
03:56:21,920 --> 03:56:25,440
Am I going crazy did I not just she left me a note

2871
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:30,160
Look at clue. Oh god, she's hiding somewhere

2872
03:56:31,040 --> 03:56:33,040
Uh claim

2873
03:56:33,200 --> 03:56:38,240
No sign of claim here. Okay. Oh, what's that? It looks like some kind of a coded message

2874
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:44,880
We're gonna have to play detective to figure out what happened to her. Look for b12 in the cat the answer lies in my stuff

2875
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:47,040
And then there's four symbols

2876
03:56:52,160 --> 03:56:57,040
What okay, one's a lava lamp. I know that's upstairs the rock is upstairs as well

2877
03:56:59,120 --> 03:57:01,120
Wait that level lamps right there

2878
03:57:01,840 --> 03:57:03,840
I

2879
03:57:06,720 --> 03:57:08,720
Not that level lamp

2880
03:57:10,080 --> 03:57:14,480
Right the level lamp up here and spit is that we think

2881
03:57:19,840 --> 03:57:23,360
There's also a hidden message under the container it says I'm with okay

2882
03:57:24,480 --> 03:57:29,440
And then there was a level lamp up here. Okay. Okay. And then a level lamp up here

2883
03:57:30,160 --> 03:57:32,160
I was level up right there

2884
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:38,640
Maybe not this level lamp in particular. Okay inspect

2885
03:57:40,080 --> 03:57:43,840
We need a belly last a huge huge huge laugh. Yes, they're coming

2886
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:51,040
Um, this gem is a medium value in low purity. The glow seems to have been added artificially

2887
03:57:51,200 --> 03:57:55,840
Maybe it's the axis of beacon for us to find something useful bingo. Is it says blazer?

2888
03:57:56,160 --> 03:57:59,920
Okay, am I going crazy, but strongly seems tamer. Uh, I am

2889
03:58:02,400 --> 03:58:04,720
I am non-functioning sleep at the moment

2890
03:58:04,880 --> 03:58:11,600
I basically sleep for four hours after stream and then I sleep before our four hours before stream

2891
03:58:11,840 --> 03:58:17,360
Like I've not had a full sleep in a couple of weeks now, so I wouldn't be surprised if I sound not myself

2892
03:58:18,720 --> 03:58:20,720
So don't be scared

2893
03:58:20,720 --> 03:58:23,280
I can't believe it. My hyper reachable isn't hyper

2894
03:58:23,280 --> 03:58:28,640
Wait, where's the note? I can't I can't remember the other two objects. I'm supposed to find

2895
03:58:30,880 --> 03:58:34,880
No clue here. No, I know I'd what wait, what's the piece of paper?

2896
03:58:36,160 --> 03:58:39,120
Um a cone a cone

2897
03:58:42,880 --> 03:58:44,720
Inspect why not?

2898
03:58:44,720 --> 03:58:49,600
That's all right, right. You find something you don't say into the nature. I'm just clicking exit stuff. I'm gonna be honest

2899
03:58:50,320 --> 03:58:52,960
Oh, I heard the noise you bleep

2900
03:58:56,720 --> 03:59:00,720
You're bleeping at something I don't know what it's in this area

2901
03:59:02,880 --> 03:59:04,720
Sure

2902
03:59:04,720 --> 03:59:10,480
I don't want nothing to have an apartment. It's the way the companion see the humans. That's kind of funny. Oh wait the the cone

2903
03:59:11,440 --> 03:59:15,120
Like something it says come to someone. Okay. Oh

2904
03:59:16,080 --> 03:59:18,080
Right and then one last item which

2905
03:59:18,960 --> 03:59:20,960
What is number one a plant?

2906
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:23,040
Is it in the kitchen?

2907
03:59:23,600 --> 03:59:26,880
Oh, you're worrying about your sleeping health. I don't know what to do

2908
03:59:28,000 --> 03:59:30,560
I honestly don't oh we love her. Um

2909
03:59:32,000 --> 03:59:33,200
I'm a bit

2910
03:59:33,200 --> 03:59:34,720
Mucked up

2911
03:59:34,720 --> 03:59:36,720
That's not a warren can

2912
03:59:37,600 --> 03:59:39,600
Yeah, it's definitely a warren. Yeah

2913
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:47,280
I don't really know what to do because I basically pass out after stream, but I don't go full for a full eight hour sleep

2914
03:59:48,560 --> 03:59:51,440
So the only option I have really is to

2915
03:59:52,000 --> 03:59:52,720
um

2916
03:59:52,720 --> 03:59:55,280
drug myself up to force myself to sleep, but

2917
03:59:56,480 --> 04:00:02,560
I've done it a few times now and I keep waking up completely messed up and I don't do the full eight hour sleep

2918
04:00:02,560 --> 04:00:04,560
I

2919
04:00:04,640 --> 04:00:09,600
Can consume cannabis is it a plant? She's one. I think it's a plant. I don't know what plant though

2920
04:00:10,480 --> 04:00:12,480
She's wanting me to look at

2921
04:00:14,080 --> 04:00:16,960
Right you got so many plants in this apartment you can down

2922
04:00:18,880 --> 04:00:21,280
We'll go let me check one more time with the item looks like

2923
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:26,080
What even is that?

2924
04:00:27,440 --> 04:00:30,240
A seriously is there a plant up here that looks like that?

2925
04:00:33,280 --> 04:00:34,560
I

2926
04:00:34,560 --> 04:00:36,560
Don't know what the item is

2927
04:00:37,520 --> 04:00:42,480
Well, that doesn't sound sustainable. Yeah, the space you're right yourself. Just sleep normally. I can't know that's the problem

2928
04:00:44,080 --> 04:00:46,320
I pass out four hours before stream

2929
04:00:47,840 --> 04:00:54,800
And I pass out four like four hours after I've already inspected you right the heck is this bizarre item

2930
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:57,040
It's not in the kitchen is it?

2931
04:00:59,360 --> 04:01:01,360
Is up here maybe on the shelf

2932
04:01:03,280 --> 04:01:08,080
But it's a nice level lamp though. I have no idea what this is like was misread and sorry

2933
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:10,960
I was also writing this message. It reads nightclub. Oh

2934
04:01:17,520 --> 04:01:19,520
What

2935
04:01:19,520 --> 04:01:23,120
Show me the image. No, it's gone. What?

2936
04:01:24,480 --> 04:01:26,480
It looked nothing like that

2937
04:01:28,320 --> 04:01:30,560
Nothing like I don't know what that was

2938
04:01:32,960 --> 04:01:39,120
Um, you sleep four hours and four hours just sleep eight hours straight and you're fine. No, the problem is I wake up

2939
04:01:39,760 --> 04:01:41,760
I don't want to get in trouble

2940
04:01:41,760 --> 04:01:45,440
I I can't sleep for eight hours is the problem

2941
04:01:46,640 --> 04:01:51,040
I could do the only time I get a deep sleep is right before stream and

2942
04:01:51,600 --> 04:01:53,760
Uh, obviously I have to wake up for stream

2943
04:01:54,480 --> 04:01:56,480
so I don't have like any

2944
04:01:57,440 --> 04:01:59,440
Solution to my problem

2945
04:02:00,080 --> 04:02:02,080
Because I need to be meman

2946
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:04,560
I

2947
04:02:06,080 --> 04:02:08,080
Wait, how did I get over here?

2948
04:02:08,720 --> 04:02:14,480
Um, like obviously it's probably like oh just skip the nap. What? How did I get here? I don't

2949
04:02:16,560 --> 04:02:18,560
Oh, it must have been the wall

2950
04:02:18,720 --> 04:02:23,600
Take a day of rest without streaming. No, this sounds terrible. I know for a fact

2951
04:02:23,680 --> 04:02:26,400
I'll be so mad at myself for not streaming

2952
04:02:26,960 --> 04:02:32,240
That I would be so upset that I wouldn't actually sleep

2953
04:02:32,720 --> 04:02:34,720
And then that would annoy me twice as much

2954
04:02:36,080 --> 04:02:39,200
Um, that would send me into a fit of rage

2955
04:02:39,760 --> 04:02:41,760
Right, how did I get here? Was it you?

2956
04:02:42,160 --> 04:02:43,680
Whoa

2957
04:02:43,680 --> 04:02:45,680
Okay, he's patrolling. It's fine

2958
04:02:48,240 --> 04:02:53,840
Uh, are you sleeping then waking up looking at your phone? No, um, I spoke to my doctor about it

2959
04:02:55,120 --> 04:02:58,880
Um, actually a while ago now, um, and um

2960
04:02:59,680 --> 04:03:03,600
I don't like bring my phone into the bedroom. That's like a big no-no

2961
04:03:04,640 --> 04:03:09,840
I'm allowed to rot in bed like on tiktok or whatever, but I don't bring my uh phone into the

2962
04:03:11,120 --> 04:03:13,120
Bedroom because uh

2963
04:03:13,200 --> 04:03:15,200
it mentalates

2964
04:03:15,200 --> 04:03:20,480
The nightclub the nightclub all the bones through that was freaking hating on me. Yeah. Well now it's my turn

2965
04:03:21,680 --> 04:03:23,680
um

2966
04:03:24,640 --> 04:03:29,360
I'm the police is explaining that cat freaking stole it. Yo, let me in

2967
04:03:31,520 --> 04:03:33,520
It's not for you. We'll wait. Yes

2968
04:03:34,480 --> 04:03:36,720
A brave I don't take braves. What is that anyway?

2969
04:03:38,800 --> 04:03:40,800
Sorry, sorry, I'm not supposed to do that

2970
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:45,600
I don't think the bouncer's gonna listen. Hey guys, I think we're gonna have to claim at the back

2971
04:03:48,960 --> 04:03:50,960
This

2972
04:03:50,960 --> 04:03:54,080
I do have maybe you could have some days with a gorilla stream instead

2973
04:03:55,280 --> 04:03:57,280
um

2974
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:03,600
Oh, that's the window I can go inside

2975
04:04:05,200 --> 04:04:07,360
Are they talking? How did I get across to you?

2976
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:20,160
As long as long term if you collapse with burner and I don't get burner like that I just get like can't sleep

2977
04:04:20,240 --> 04:04:22,880
Oh my god, you're so happy. Can I talk to you?

2978
04:04:24,800 --> 04:04:28,960
Oh, that's a shame. I can't talk to him. Oh as long as you're happy doing your thing

2979
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:31,840
Hi, mr. Can I come inside?

2980
04:04:33,200 --> 04:04:37,760
Hey, how'd you get up here? You want to party with us here jump in and get a drink? Oh, yeah, come on buddy

2981
04:04:38,880 --> 04:04:40,880
Livian

2982
04:04:41,840 --> 04:04:47,520
Alex was the name of that mpc. I've just shot one of the person listening in right now

2983
04:04:48,480 --> 04:04:50,480
Whoa

2984
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:54,000
What's this

2985
04:04:55,600 --> 04:05:01,920
Wow, I'm getting blinded. We're just climbing time. Is there like a hidden bit?

2986
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:09,600
I've never been to like a rave or a party is this what it's like

2987
04:05:10,720 --> 04:05:12,640
Oh

2988
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:16,240
Hey, wait, there must be like a private room that claims them like back here. Maybe

2989
04:05:18,080 --> 04:05:22,480
Clam wouldn't be in the middle of the floor, right? Surely not. She's literally a bit

2990
04:05:25,120 --> 04:05:32,640
Just sleep well on stream I far in my sleep. I honestly would if I could buy freaking far. Where the frick is claim? Am I going crazy?

2991
04:05:35,840 --> 04:05:37,840
Hey

2992
04:05:39,200 --> 04:05:41,600
Who is it blaze or someone or Blake?

2993
04:05:42,560 --> 04:05:48,960
I'm gonna say where is she you like my mask. I made it the jam the scent on the scans and it looks cool

2994
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:54,000
You're a very shy dancer

2995
04:05:54,880 --> 04:05:56,880
Who wants to talk to hi

2996
04:06:00,720 --> 04:06:06,400
The access some private business going on it has been reserved for some blazer guy. Yeah, where is it?

2997
04:06:07,840 --> 04:06:09,840
Up

2998
04:06:11,920 --> 04:06:13,920
Up up

2999
04:06:16,480 --> 04:06:22,880
Uh, ask a new shop receipt. Wait, no, I'm still on site wait. I'm trapped wait come down. No down

3000
04:06:25,200 --> 04:06:27,200
Take it up

3001
04:06:28,400 --> 04:06:33,840
Hold on analyzing analyzing scanning location visualizing

3002
04:06:34,080 --> 04:06:36,080
Oh

3003
04:06:38,960 --> 04:06:41,200
Where there's wall here

3004
04:06:44,480 --> 04:06:46,480
God I suck at this

3005
04:06:48,000 --> 04:06:51,040
That looks like a walkway I'm supposed to get all the way around

3006
04:06:52,160 --> 04:06:54,160
How do I get up to it?

3007
04:06:56,080 --> 04:06:58,080
You see that you don't get rated on your birds

3008
04:06:59,520 --> 04:07:01,920
Once you open the floodgate with a farce it's over

3009
04:07:02,480 --> 04:07:05,760
You can never unfar again on stream

3010
04:07:08,160 --> 04:07:10,160
Wait, maybe that was the right way to go

3011
04:07:11,600 --> 04:07:17,360
Oh, it's it. There's not glass. I thought there was glass. Okay. Wait, so how'd I go up?

3012
04:07:19,440 --> 04:07:21,440
Okay, this has to be it

3013
04:07:28,240 --> 04:07:30,240
Um

3014
04:07:32,400 --> 04:07:34,400
So

3015
04:07:42,640 --> 04:07:49,840
Well, I uh, I think my dad's gonna keep me awake so I don't nap after stream basically because you'll be wanting to like go

3016
04:07:51,200 --> 04:07:54,560
And do stuff where the I'm genuinely stuck though

3017
04:07:55,280 --> 04:07:58,400
Can I like climb this wall with my claws or something?

3018
04:07:58,640 --> 04:08:06,720
I'm really turned around in this location. I see I see ladders, but

3019
04:08:08,400 --> 04:08:10,400
Oh for goodness

3020
04:08:15,200 --> 04:08:19,280
Use a lever do you guys have a lever here?

3021
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:24,160
This is why so I can like interact with it

3022
04:08:25,120 --> 04:08:32,880
Hey everyone DJ Matty here, let's get the party started. Of course someone's been requested by a very questionable friend blazer

3023
04:08:36,080 --> 04:08:38,080
I need a record

3024
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:45,120
Oh for goodness sake was it that simple?

3025
04:08:45,600 --> 04:08:47,600
Oh

3026
04:08:51,760 --> 04:08:54,320
Okay, it was that simple I'm so sorry

3027
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:58,640
In my defense, I'm not smart

3028
04:09:03,360 --> 04:09:05,360
Wait

3029
04:09:10,160 --> 04:09:14,560
I need to do it on that side and I need a lever for it

3030
04:09:15,280 --> 04:09:18,480
There's nothing up here

3031
04:09:29,520 --> 04:09:35,040
Oh take the thing okay when the other guy goes what take his record

3032
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:39,600
Okay, okay, okay

3033
04:09:40,240 --> 04:09:43,760
Surely that's what I'm supposed to do. I don't know why I'm supposed to do that

3034
04:09:45,120 --> 04:09:47,120
I

3035
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:53,120
Right, I need to wait until he's not doing it and then yonkers record

3036
04:10:00,080 --> 04:10:02,080
He squashed him

3037
04:10:11,520 --> 04:10:13,360
Terrible

3038
04:10:13,360 --> 04:10:15,680
Can you snatch the plate? That's what I thought but

3039
04:10:16,880 --> 04:10:18,880
He's not coming over

3040
04:10:19,360 --> 04:10:22,240
This guy needs to come over and so I can steal the plate I think

3041
04:10:24,080 --> 04:10:29,600
You probably have to do that on both sides to take it. This doesn't even have a lever right? I need to find a lever then

3042
04:10:32,320 --> 04:10:36,880
Oh, where do I find a lever? Do you have a lever for me?

3043
04:10:38,240 --> 04:10:40,240
No

3044
04:10:44,080 --> 04:10:46,080
Whoa

3045
04:10:53,040 --> 04:10:56,640
What how is anyone supposed to know?

3046
04:10:58,160 --> 04:11:00,160
Okay, remember

3047
04:11:00,800 --> 04:11:03,280
Oh, there's no progress down here. It's just a memory thing

3048
04:11:05,600 --> 04:11:09,360
When I was human my friends and I would gather and party long into the night

3049
04:11:09,360 --> 04:11:12,720
Even if we had to suffer the annoying consequences the next day

3050
04:11:13,200 --> 04:11:20,480
It felt good to find joy despite the unaliveable surface and of a ruddery and the underground living conditions became more and more

3051
04:11:21,040 --> 04:11:22,080
squalid

3052
04:11:22,080 --> 04:11:25,280
And the capitalist greed of the companies like

3053
04:11:27,600 --> 04:11:33,280
And the police state created by the sentinels now I remember why we're doing that

3054
04:11:35,200 --> 04:11:37,200
Oh

3055
04:11:40,320 --> 04:11:42,320
Okay, so there's nothing

3056
04:11:42,720 --> 04:11:44,720
Wait

3057
04:11:44,960 --> 04:11:48,400
Let me in the vip right now. I'm on the other side of the door. Let me in

3058
04:11:49,600 --> 04:11:51,600
When I was human

3059
04:11:52,320 --> 04:11:53,760
Yeah

3060
04:11:53,760 --> 04:11:59,840
Everyone's been turned in my theory is that everyone's a human entire robot

3061
04:11:59,920 --> 04:12:03,440
But they forgot or maybe it was taken away by the state

3062
04:12:03,520 --> 04:12:07,040
So the people wouldn't revolt and accept that the surface isn't livable

3063
04:12:07,360 --> 04:12:10,800
Because obviously everyone's a robot now. So of course the surface is livable

3064
04:12:13,600 --> 04:12:18,640
Down with black rock. No, no, no, no, no the sentence is the high table

3065
04:12:21,280 --> 04:12:23,280
Down with the high table

3066
04:12:25,920 --> 04:12:31,040
Tin foil man, right where the thick is this lever take strange drink

3067
04:12:32,960 --> 04:12:34,960
I'm too alcohol someone

3068
04:12:37,680 --> 04:12:41,760
Why would I take a strange drink who would want a strange drink?

3069
04:12:45,920 --> 04:12:47,920
You

3070
04:12:52,800 --> 04:12:57,040
Who would want a strange drink the wink

3071
04:13:00,160 --> 04:13:02,160
Am I getting you drunk

3072
04:13:02,320 --> 04:13:04,320
I

3073
04:13:04,720 --> 04:13:06,720
Want to see you destroy that dance floor

3074
04:13:09,840 --> 04:13:12,720
Who wants a strange drink? Do you want a strange drink?

3075
04:13:14,400 --> 04:13:19,440
This club sucks when I tried to get that stupid VIP room. Can you believe it? I just stole this lever

3076
04:13:20,480 --> 04:13:22,480
If you give me a drink, I'll give you this off

3077
04:13:24,080 --> 04:13:27,520
Oh, thanks. Here you go as prom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, give me that

3078
04:13:28,960 --> 04:13:30,960
Okay, we got there in the end

3079
04:13:31,600 --> 04:13:33,600
Doing it backwards as always

3080
04:13:34,320 --> 04:13:38,640
Okay, and then jump up on top of this one and then we can get away with it

3081
04:13:40,320 --> 04:13:42,320
Yeah, it wraps around

3082
04:13:48,240 --> 04:13:51,120
Oh, wait, should I do that music thing? Okay, hold on. Let me do the music

3083
04:13:54,720 --> 04:13:58,160
I think it must be achievement like make the club silent is my guess

3084
04:13:58,720 --> 04:14:00,720
No

3085
04:14:01,680 --> 04:14:06,560
Oh, wow. No, um, uh, I must be a I should have picked up a record somewhere

Yeah, well, okay. All right. Sorry. Sorry wasting time

3087
04:14:14,400 --> 04:14:18,720
Stranny is the master of solving puzzles backwards literally they're picking up all the random stuff being like

3088
04:14:18,720 --> 04:14:20,720
What?

3089
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:28,880
I'm wondering if I'm supposed to bring in a second record and it like enhances and like everyone dances a bit more I guess

3090
04:14:30,560 --> 04:14:34,640
Is my gander at what is supposed to occur here? Please put me upstairs

3091
04:14:41,280 --> 04:14:43,280
Did he really just pose for us

3092
04:14:45,200 --> 04:14:47,200
Okay, what's going on here?

3093
04:14:48,000 --> 04:14:50,720
Oh light control let there be lights

3094
04:14:53,760 --> 04:14:55,760
Oh, no

3095
04:14:57,120 --> 04:14:59,120
Make that stuff low

3096
04:14:59,920 --> 04:15:01,920
Hello, can you lower?

3097
04:15:02,960 --> 04:15:06,720
No, no, no the other way the other way lower

3098
04:15:08,480 --> 04:15:10,480
And then this one

3099
04:15:12,000 --> 04:15:14,880
I'm in lower. No, you're getting higher

3100
04:15:17,440 --> 04:15:23,440
And then lower. Oh, wait. No, that's a jump across. I jump across now

3101
04:15:28,560 --> 04:15:30,560
Oh

3102
04:15:32,800 --> 04:15:38,320
Uh, I have to admit I did take a lot of time to get there. So I'm not even surprised. He's not just being chilling

3103
04:15:39,200 --> 04:15:41,200
I'm waiting for me

3104
04:15:41,760 --> 04:15:43,040
Hi, buddy

3105
04:15:43,040 --> 04:15:44,240
Hi

3106
04:15:44,240 --> 04:15:46,240
Are you just being teeny here?

3107
04:15:46,320 --> 04:15:48,080
Hi

3108
04:15:48,080 --> 04:15:51,200
I have a very good relationship with the sentinels. I don't understand why people complain so

3109
04:15:52,480 --> 04:15:54,480
You're the first that would be taken down

3110
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:58,400
For your k your cranes you have committed against the community

3111
04:16:00,400 --> 04:16:02,400
I shouldn't have spoken to that man at all

3112
04:16:08,400 --> 04:16:13,200
Two birds with one stone, you're not as clever as you look little cat. Anyway, not in personal business as business

3113
04:16:16,240 --> 04:16:18,240
How do I blow him up?

3114
04:16:20,480 --> 04:16:22,480
We need Guy Fox's stuff right now

3115
04:16:22,880 --> 04:16:29,280
Business is money and I value money way more than our friendship or camaraderie. They are all yours

3116
04:16:30,160 --> 04:16:33,280
Am I about to do a quick time event? Oh, what do I do?

3117
04:16:39,120 --> 04:16:41,120

3120
04:16:57,440 --> 04:17:02,800
Why are you dangling me above a pit as well? What weirdos honestly? I'm just a freaking ginger cat

3121
04:17:03,680 --> 04:17:11,920
Wait, yeah, that's right. Oh no, I'm naked. Oh, I don't have refland with me

3122
04:17:24,640 --> 04:17:26,640

04:17:27,600 --> 04:17:29,600
I need to get you back

3124
04:17:31,360 --> 04:17:35,680
You can't go on without you. It's too scary. I really am in jail. I've got the jail

3125
04:17:48,080 --> 04:17:52,240

3128
04:18:16,560 --> 04:18:22,160
Uh, I need to get refland and get the heck out of here because what the heck can I claim?

3129
04:18:22,880 --> 04:18:26,880
Must be a claim and location is just jail

3130
04:18:29,680 --> 04:18:31,680
Look at the jail

3131
04:18:35,440 --> 04:18:38,880
Oh, I want you back now. I hate playing the game alone

3132
04:18:39,840 --> 04:18:42,160
You are ironically giving me so much courage to play

3133
04:18:42,880 --> 04:18:46,800
How do I get past you? You don't move. I don't get past you at all

3134
04:18:47,520 --> 04:18:49,520
I

3135
04:18:51,360 --> 04:18:53,360
Can

3136
04:18:58,000 --> 04:19:02,400
I'm not supposed to get caught. I can't that can't be right

3137
04:19:04,720 --> 04:19:07,040
Oh, wait, hold on. There's something here. Sorry

3138
04:19:12,640 --> 04:19:14,640
Oh, they aren't even here

3139
04:19:17,200 --> 04:19:19,200
I don't know when he's gonna come back

3140
04:19:25,040 --> 04:19:32,320
I'm just sending out. I'm just sending out seems like I can hide in here. I think you'll come back to me

3141
04:19:36,240 --> 04:19:39,440
Do you see just turn around? Okay, good

3142
04:19:43,920 --> 04:19:45,920
Very quietly

3143
04:19:47,600 --> 04:19:49,600
Okay

3144
04:19:52,560 --> 04:19:54,560
I go up there. No, I don't

3145
04:20:02,400 --> 04:20:04,400
I gotta claim up in this corner

3146
04:20:06,560 --> 04:20:13,760
Okay, here we go. Oh, no, we don't here we go. Uh, yeah, like that perfect

3147
04:20:14,480 --> 04:20:16,480
Okay, yeah

3148
04:20:17,360 --> 04:20:19,360
Look at that barricade in my safe

3149
04:20:20,320 --> 04:20:22,320
Oh

3150
04:20:26,240 --> 04:20:28,240
Hi, buddy, I'll get you

3151
04:20:30,800 --> 04:20:34,080
Oh god, that's right. We can't even translate we can't speak

3152
04:20:38,000 --> 04:20:40,000
That's called glass on it

3153
04:20:40,960 --> 04:20:42,960
That can scoop my boot in here

3154
04:20:45,200 --> 04:20:47,200
What's this

3155
04:20:48,160 --> 04:20:50,160
Why is the music ominous?

3156
04:20:51,760 --> 04:20:54,480
Please don't do ominous music. I can't handle it

3157
04:20:57,200 --> 04:20:59,200
Grab key

3158
04:21:01,200 --> 04:21:03,920
Uh, there's no shortcut. Let's go around that's okay

3159
04:21:04,240 --> 04:21:06,240
Okay

3160
04:21:06,560 --> 04:21:08,960
This is bleak as heck honestly

3161
04:21:10,320 --> 04:21:13,120
Humans are dead and had to be digitally uploaded

3162
04:21:14,000 --> 04:21:16,000
Hi clan drop

04:21:59,760 --> 04:22:01,760
I can't understand you

3169
04:22:04,880 --> 04:22:06,880
We need to be quiet

3170
04:22:17,840 --> 04:22:19,840
I can't understand

3171
04:22:20,800 --> 04:22:22,800
I

3172
04:22:36,160 --> 04:22:38,160

3173
04:22:43,840 --> 04:22:47,360
What are they doing to you they download in your brain or something

3174
04:22:50,640 --> 04:22:52,640

I didn't mean to get so ominous

3178
04:23:12,960 --> 04:23:14,960
Where the fuck do you get so ominous

3179
04:23:19,840 --> 04:23:21,840
I

3180
04:23:41,280 --> 04:23:44,320
Need me to go ahead because I'm small and fuzzy

3181
04:23:44,320 --> 04:23:46,320
I

3182
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:06,320
Don't they manually jump over it? Oh, sorry

3183
04:24:06,320 --> 04:24:08,320
I

3184
04:24:20,480 --> 04:24:26,820
This is a bit much isn't it? No, I'm gonna have to go back out

3185
04:24:27,220 --> 04:24:29,220
I

3186
04:24:34,740 --> 04:24:37,540
Sorry, I'm like sweating. I do not want to mess up the sequence

I see the lever I see it I see it

3190
04:25:11,540 --> 04:25:15,620
We're refling I'm coming to get you but they're looking at you

3191
04:25:17,700 --> 04:25:20,900
I need to create some sort of whoa, what does yellow mean?

3192
04:25:24,180 --> 04:25:26,180
Attack on sight

3193
04:25:27,780 --> 04:25:29,780

3197
04:25:56,820 --> 04:26:05,300
Okay, okay, okay, I've got my refill and that's all that's important

3198
04:26:08,660 --> 04:26:10,660
Feel the time

04:26:15,620 --> 04:26:17,620
Steady

3200

Okay

3201
04:26:23,220 --> 04:26:25,220
I

3202
04:26:33,140 --> 04:26:35,140
Saw that

3203
04:26:36,500 --> 04:26:38,500
Here I'm safe

3204

I think I did it. I think we did it holy crap. Oh, please give me give me

3205
04:26:53,220 --> 04:26:55,700
Did they reset you buddy

Talk to me come on is it you

3207
04:27:04,900 --> 04:27:06,900
Let's go

3208
04:27:07,380 --> 04:27:11,780
I felt like I was trapped in my lab computer system again all alone, but you came back for me

3209
04:27:11,780 --> 04:27:14,660
I can't believe it. You're a good friend. Heck. Yeah. I'm a good friend

3210
04:27:16,340 --> 04:27:20,740
I'm so glad that we're all safe together again, but we're not safe yet. We need to find a way out of here

3211
04:27:20,820 --> 04:27:22,820
Can you open that door?

3212
04:27:24,420 --> 04:27:26,420
Wow

3213
04:27:28,980 --> 04:27:30,980
We did it we did it we did it

3214
04:27:33,060 --> 04:27:36,500
Let's get the heck out of this jail. I see a lever

3215
04:27:38,020 --> 04:27:40,020
sugar

3216
04:27:40,260 --> 04:27:44,100
Could I get in there or can I just jump up? No, I can't all right, let's go to last uh

3217
04:27:46,580 --> 04:27:48,980
Hold on the main biscuit uh, uh, hold on

3218
04:27:51,220 --> 04:27:53,220
Wait, you can't progress all

3219
04:27:54,500 --> 04:27:56,500
Neither can I

3220
04:27:56,980 --> 04:28:00,660
This has got glass. You need to break it for me. I need to go up

3221
04:28:01,460 --> 04:28:03,460
again

3222
04:28:04,340 --> 04:28:07,700
Throw a brick at it throw a brick at the glass for me

3223
04:28:10,340 --> 04:28:12,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to help me progress

3224
04:28:16,580 --> 04:28:18,580
A little vandalism never went too far

3225
04:28:21,540 --> 04:28:23,540
I can already see that. Why can't I hold all these?

3226
04:28:25,780 --> 04:28:27,780
Can you give me a lift up?

3227
04:28:30,180 --> 04:28:34,980
I can't reach you'll have to lift me please. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just like that

3228
04:28:37,540 --> 04:28:40,020
I'll be a second hang in there

3229
04:28:41,780 --> 04:28:44,580
Uh, okay, it's just a lever. There's nothing scary here

3230
04:28:44,900 --> 04:28:51,220
Climb spray base we're not, uh, leaving him behind

3231
04:28:52,980 --> 04:28:54,980
B12 gang

3232
04:28:55,540 --> 04:28:57,940
And I'm getting every comfort in my chair

3233
04:28:58,900 --> 04:29:01,940
The sentinels are broken the way again. They will spot me instantly

3234
04:29:01,940 --> 04:29:06,020
Maybe you can try and bait them into those cells and lock them. Oh, no

3235
04:29:07,300 --> 04:29:09,300
What do you mean bait them into the cells?

3236
04:29:15,300 --> 04:29:17,300
Only see one

3237
04:29:21,140 --> 04:29:23,140
Just him you want

3238
04:29:27,620 --> 04:29:29,620
Just one

3239
04:29:37,860 --> 04:29:43,300
I didn't know they freaking show at me. Holy crap close it close it

3240
04:29:45,540 --> 04:29:49,060
What's around? Oh my gosh

3241
04:29:52,100 --> 04:29:54,260
That really went for me. Are you okay?

3242
04:29:56,340 --> 04:29:58,340
Are you tall?

3243
04:29:58,980 --> 04:30:01,060
Wait claims you can't talk all

3244
04:30:05,620 --> 04:30:12,020
We're cat gaming today we pooding any putters you're my little pooders

3245
04:30:12,980 --> 04:30:14,980
One second

3246
04:30:20,180 --> 04:30:25,140
This per fellow seems like sentinels are ruthless when it comes to defying them

3247
04:30:27,540 --> 04:30:33,380
That's what I feared they have completely erased him no more emotions no more self-awareness no more memories

3248
04:30:33,940 --> 04:30:36,580
Please let's not get caught. No we won't

3249
04:30:37,060 --> 04:30:41,060
All right, what's the deal climb?

3250
04:30:56,740 --> 04:30:58,740
I need a lock of them inside here

3251
04:31:03,620 --> 04:31:05,620
Would it be better

3252
04:31:07,300 --> 04:31:09,300
I need to attract them both

3253
04:31:10,420 --> 04:31:12,420
I'm gonna lock it behind me

3254
04:31:17,540 --> 04:31:24,660
Wait, I'm an idiot. Oh sugar only one came in that's not what we want

3255
04:31:28,580 --> 04:31:32,500
Is it gonna push against the other door if it pushes against the other door

3256
04:31:33,620 --> 04:31:35,220
No

3257
04:31:35,300 --> 04:31:37,300
It patrols inside the dang cell

3258
04:31:39,060 --> 04:31:41,620
Unfortunate I messed that sequence up. Um

3259
04:31:46,980 --> 04:31:48,980
Right, okay, let it out and then do a little

3260
04:31:54,420 --> 04:31:56,820
Wait, was that registering it was inside? Whoa

3261
04:32:01,540 --> 04:32:03,540
One shot

3262
04:32:06,180 --> 04:32:08,180
Seriously

3263
04:32:08,340 --> 04:32:10,340
One shot

3264
04:32:10,660 --> 04:32:12,660
I fucking give me a fighting chance

3265
04:32:13,140 --> 04:32:19,300
I was gonna praise this game, but I kind of be honest with one shot death type stuff. That's ridiculous

3266
04:32:21,540 --> 04:32:26,740
Literally one shot. I mean I get there has to be like an anti like oh this game this game

3267
04:32:27,300 --> 04:32:31,860
It needs to have like it can't just be like super duper easy and all that but one freaking shot

3268
04:32:31,860 --> 04:32:33,860
Like me

3269
04:32:34,260 --> 04:32:36,260
I'm freaking gonna say I don't know if I did that in time

3270
04:32:38,980 --> 04:32:40,980
Again

3271
04:32:44,740 --> 04:32:46,740
So how do I get you in?

3272
04:32:47,940 --> 04:32:50,020
Yeah, don't shoot me again, I guess

3273
04:32:52,740 --> 04:32:56,500
And come inside I guess uh, this is not gonna work

3274
04:32:57,460 --> 04:32:59,460
I did it work

3275
04:33:00,100 --> 04:33:05,060
Oh, thank god. Yeah, the game was nice. That should not have worked, but whatever. I'll take that

3276
04:33:05,860 --> 04:33:11,700
You're a house cat. You're not built for durability. I know I'm a tiny cat, but brav. Give me a something to breathe like a lamb

3277
04:33:13,700 --> 04:33:15,860
Hi, you want to come escape?

3278
04:33:19,700 --> 04:33:21,700
Oh no, they took their brains

3279
04:33:26,500 --> 04:33:28,500
I

3280
04:33:33,220 --> 04:33:38,260
Juked him like a pro honestly, I was like, bro. I'm dying again. I'm gonna start region. Okay. Maybe I take it back

3281
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:40,740
I was a bit heasty. Okay. I was a bit heasty

3282
04:33:41,700 --> 04:33:43,380
um

3283
04:33:43,380 --> 04:33:47,780
It's fine. I was just a little mad. I'm guessing we can't progress until I

3284
04:33:48,980 --> 04:33:50,980
Yeah

3285
04:33:51,300 --> 04:33:55,060
What are we looking at? All right out you come claim

3286
04:33:57,460 --> 04:34:03,060
Cat versus laser the cat should win it. Yeah, I should have infinite health infinite a ammo

3287
04:34:04,740 --> 04:34:07,860
This door it's only way out this jail. I think I can open it from that control room

3288
04:34:07,860 --> 04:34:10,900
We have to find a way to get access to that room though. Please look around

3289
04:34:15,060 --> 04:34:17,060
Hmm

3290
04:34:17,300 --> 04:34:19,300
There's parkour

3291
04:34:20,100 --> 04:34:25,620
Oh my god, what if the game just let me super easy just have a parkour moment with no enemies that chase me

3292
04:34:26,580 --> 04:34:31,060
Wouldn't that be awesome? That'd be amazing. Wouldn't you love oh keys?

3293
04:34:33,940 --> 04:34:35,940
No keys

3294
04:34:39,140 --> 04:34:43,860
They left the keys in the door hop on the back of the truck you should be able to jump over the fence

3295
04:34:44,580 --> 04:34:46,580
Oh, right. Okay

3296
04:34:47,060 --> 04:34:51,220
That's what I'm saying. I keep accidentally doing the puzzles. I'm like, oh cool keys. What do I do with it?

3297
04:34:51,220 --> 04:34:55,540
I was gonna like take the keys over and games like all right next great jump on back. Okay. I'm on the back

3298
04:34:58,420 --> 04:35:00,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa beep beep

3299
04:35:02,260 --> 04:35:04,260
That's what I saw a woman driver

3300
04:35:04,900 --> 04:35:08,500
Those poor saps are facing a fate worse than death. Mmm

3301
04:35:09,300 --> 04:35:11,300
Would you rather perish or would you like?

3302
04:35:12,020 --> 04:35:15,860
Rather like lose your mind but still be alive, but you're not all there

3303
04:35:17,060 --> 04:35:19,060
Oh

3304
04:35:20,660 --> 04:35:22,660
Please no run sequence

3305
04:35:23,060 --> 04:35:28,500
My heart can't handle it. I really can't wait. Please drive it. Please drive us in the car

3306
04:35:30,420 --> 04:35:35,380
Please oh my god, was that my freaking voice that did that noise? Did you hear that? It was like a piercing noise. Oh, I'm stuck

3307
04:35:36,020 --> 04:35:38,740
I'm stuck. I'm stuck climb climb climb

3308
04:35:43,620 --> 04:35:45,620
Wait climb you're not gonna pick me up

3309
04:35:47,140 --> 04:35:49,780
Hello meow

3310
04:35:52,500 --> 04:35:54,500
You forget about me bish. Yeah

3311
04:35:58,820 --> 04:36:02,660
I can get that I literally couldn't get that

3312
04:36:06,100 --> 04:36:08,100
Oh, we got like an actual cutscene

3313
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:18,580
Oh

3314
04:36:21,380 --> 04:36:23,380
All right, come on, let's go buddy

3315
04:36:24,820 --> 04:36:26,820
You're not coming

3316
04:36:28,420 --> 04:36:32,100
Okay, there's no way we'll we'll make it out of the sentinels on our tail

3317
04:36:32,100 --> 04:36:37,140
I can distract them for a little but you have to go the outsider manifesto says we must go outside at any cost

3318
04:36:37,220 --> 04:36:38,420
I wrote that

3319
04:36:38,420 --> 04:36:40,420
Oh, that's so

3320
04:36:41,140 --> 04:36:44,740
You're one of us now. It's not that everyone has to get the outside

3321
04:36:44,740 --> 04:36:50,900
But one of us has to you've gained an item subway key now go. I'll keep you in my ram little outsider

3322
04:36:53,620 --> 04:36:56,020
Climb run yes drive away

3323
04:36:57,620 --> 04:36:59,620
That's so funny

3324
04:37:00,420 --> 04:37:02,420
Okay, come on you and your mechanic mess up now

3325
04:37:04,260 --> 04:37:07,300
Oh, our friend was here. Oh, no the hippies gone

3326
04:37:08,260 --> 04:37:09,460
And

3327
04:37:09,460 --> 04:37:11,460
Now that is a death

3328
04:37:11,460 --> 04:37:13,460
Flag if I've ever seen one

3329
04:37:13,780 --> 04:37:18,580
I fear you might be correct my dear rifling. I fear you might be correct indeed

3330
04:37:20,820 --> 04:37:25,620
Okay, we've got a subway key now. We're unironically about to drive a train

3331
04:37:27,460 --> 04:37:29,860
We don't put it in this box

3332
04:37:31,060 --> 04:37:33,060
No

3333
04:37:34,260 --> 04:37:36,260
Sorry one moment

3334
04:37:36,820 --> 04:37:38,820
Is it this side we drive? No

3335
04:37:42,100 --> 04:37:44,100
Um

3336
04:37:44,340 --> 04:37:46,340
I'm sure we got given a subway key

3337
04:37:47,460 --> 04:37:51,780
If the death is not on the screen, it doesn't count exactly John Wick 4 momentum

3338
04:37:54,260 --> 04:37:57,300
I read an interview by Keanu Reeves because I was so upset

3339
04:37:57,780 --> 04:38:03,140
And if he apparently begged the directors to make it obvious he had perished

3340
04:38:03,780 --> 04:38:05,780
and I was like

3341
04:38:06,260 --> 04:38:09,860
Because he didn't want any of our arbitrary ending

3342
04:38:11,300 --> 04:38:13,060
Um

3343
04:38:13,060 --> 04:38:16,820
So I guess the scene of him falling down the stairs was it

3344
04:38:19,860 --> 04:38:21,860
I think I'm maybe going back

3345
04:38:24,980 --> 04:38:26,980
Or not at all

3346
04:38:28,900 --> 04:38:34,900
Boo oh neko like no eco not neko

3347
04:38:36,820 --> 04:38:42,500
We're actually going to be a train conductor stop. I'm pretty sure there's a train conductor neko in some

3348
04:38:43,220 --> 04:38:45,700
touristic railway station in japan

3349
04:38:48,340 --> 04:38:52,820
The music's gone all funky. I like your funky beat logo

3350
04:38:59,780 --> 04:39:02,980
Uh, but he's coming back for John Wick 5. Yeah

3351
04:39:03,700 --> 04:39:05,700
Oh

3352
04:39:08,740 --> 04:39:10,740
Train conductor for gen 2 confirmed

3353
04:39:12,340 --> 04:39:14,340
Can I make a sec?

3354
04:39:16,820 --> 04:39:18,820
Show me you take it

3355
04:39:21,780 --> 04:39:23,780
Here's that paper

3356
04:39:25,620 --> 04:39:27,620
We already have a train conductor in gen

3357
04:39:28,020 --> 04:39:30,420
Is that an ac joke omega alone?

3358
04:39:31,300 --> 04:39:36,340
The control room the headquarters you say

3359
04:39:39,380 --> 04:39:41,380
Do you have a ticket to this

3360
04:39:43,300 --> 04:39:46,900
Just stick people love tree what type of train would I design?

3361
04:39:51,380 --> 04:39:54,180
The steam train the scottish stream

3362
04:39:54,180 --> 04:39:56,180
The steam train

3363
04:39:58,980 --> 04:40:01,480
Well this place hasn't been touched by time

3364
04:40:07,700 --> 04:40:09,700
Hello

3365
04:40:11,860 --> 04:40:13,860
Hello

3366
04:40:14,980 --> 04:40:16,980
Hello

3367
04:40:17,300 --> 04:40:19,300
Oh

3368
04:40:20,820 --> 04:40:27,540
They don't have personalities that on the surface enjoy the world's safest city waltz city 99

3369
04:40:30,820 --> 04:40:32,820
There's no robots

3370
04:40:35,140 --> 04:40:37,140
Uh

3371
04:40:40,580 --> 04:40:42,580
Waltz city 99

3372
04:40:43,300 --> 04:40:48,020
Things are out of order though. There's no humans here

3373
04:40:51,220 --> 04:40:53,220
But the robots haven't evolved

3374
04:40:54,740 --> 04:40:59,780
City sealed rules of confinement heavy prison sentence

3375
04:41:01,860 --> 04:41:03,860
City sealed

3376
04:41:05,060 --> 04:41:07,060
Wow

3377
04:41:07,460 --> 04:41:14,740
Greetings inhabitant of waltz city 99 the door leading to the surface is currently locked due to a confinement procedure

3378
04:41:15,220 --> 04:41:21,300
Please refer to any certified engineer inside the control room if you have any requests. Have a nice day

3379
04:41:22,420 --> 04:41:24,900
It's weird when they don't have a personality

3380
04:41:25,860 --> 04:41:27,860
They're just

3381
04:41:27,860 --> 04:41:29,860
Robots

3382
04:41:30,580 --> 04:41:32,580
Okay

3383
04:41:33,380 --> 04:41:35,780
Wow, this is weird

3384
04:41:40,740 --> 04:41:43,380
The control room is closed by some sort of security protocol

3385
04:41:43,380 --> 04:41:48,980
It says that only humans are authorized also says that i'm not considered human. Hey, that's offensive security protocol

3386
04:41:49,540 --> 04:41:52,820
Maybe if we work together we can open this passage way

3387
04:41:55,780 --> 04:41:57,780
Um the control

3388
04:41:57,780 --> 04:41:59,780
It says why

3389
04:42:00,100 --> 04:42:06,180
I'm pressing why but it's not doing it. I need to drag something over. Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember this

3390
04:42:08,500 --> 04:42:10,900
Let's stand on it and see what we can do about this panel

3391
04:42:12,660 --> 04:42:17,220
Um, can we expect some gender bender and models females? No, I'm not like this

3392
04:42:19,460 --> 04:42:21,460
Oh

3393
04:42:21,460 --> 04:42:23,460
Okay

3394
04:42:23,460 --> 04:42:25,620
Yes, good little spreadsheet. Whoa

3395
04:42:25,620 --> 04:42:27,620
Oh, it's like

3396
04:42:27,780 --> 04:42:29,780
I can't scratch it off or open

3397
04:42:33,060 --> 04:42:35,060
Hmm

3398
04:42:35,540 --> 04:42:37,540
I need to throw something at it

3399
04:42:38,660 --> 04:42:42,980
Yeah, there's no gender bender of concepts that are already pre-established like

3400
04:42:45,140 --> 04:42:50,180
All the designs that have been approved so far like unique concepts. How do I open that panel?

3401
04:42:51,140 --> 04:42:53,620
Yeah, can I borrow your tool, please?

3402
04:42:56,500 --> 04:43:01,460
The savings you'll please refer to any certified engineer. Have a nice day. Thank you

3403
04:43:03,220 --> 04:43:05,220
Do you have a tool that I can borrow?

3404
04:43:16,900 --> 04:43:21,460
We started down there that was midtown and there we're up here

3405
04:43:21,860 --> 04:43:23,860
And

3406
04:43:25,540 --> 04:43:27,540
John makes and create with her coffee right

3407
04:43:28,180 --> 04:43:35,140
No, I was very surprised about the new gen two entry. Um, it completely knocked out a previous except the design

3408
04:43:35,220 --> 04:43:41,460
So that was a very I was very surprised. Um, because I had actually enjoyed the

3409
04:43:46,420 --> 04:43:48,420
Open human

3410
04:43:51,620 --> 04:43:53,620
I'm not sure what I'm missing

3411
04:43:54,740 --> 04:43:57,140
Oh, you know what you're actually done

3412
04:43:59,060 --> 04:44:02,740
Oh, yeah, that's right. A little cheeky like cold

3413
04:44:04,100 --> 04:44:06,100
Is it sabotaging?

3414
04:44:07,140 --> 04:44:09,140
Okay, this is my

3415
04:44:10,660 --> 04:44:14,100
Does I need to bring the thing over again? No, it's open

3416
04:44:14,900 --> 04:44:16,900
I

3417
04:44:19,940 --> 04:44:26,340
Chant to go to eat us through the high table. Oh, you've guessed the pot. How do you this is the control room for the entire city

3418
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:28,580
They controlled everything from here and it's empty

3419
04:44:31,540 --> 04:44:36,340
I remember hating them so much. They had everything clean space limitless power freedom to move

3420
04:44:36,980 --> 04:44:38,980
Little good. It did them

3421
04:44:40,500 --> 04:44:42,500
The plague I remember now

3422
04:44:44,980 --> 04:44:50,260
Everyone was dying and they thought they were above it all they did nothing to help us

3423
04:44:51,380 --> 04:44:56,580
I watched my family die. I felt helpless. I couldn't do anything to save them

3424
04:44:59,140 --> 04:45:02,820
But I can still help you we can still go outside together

3425
04:45:03,380 --> 04:45:06,660
I will carry the memories of humanity and the people I loved

3426
04:45:06,900 --> 04:45:08,900
Oh

3427
04:45:12,340 --> 04:45:19,780
I think we did it anyway, I don't know. This seems pretty end gamey to me not to be dramatic or anything, but I think

3428
04:45:23,780 --> 04:45:25,780
That's it. That's the main computer

3429
04:45:26,660 --> 04:45:28,660
I

3430
04:45:32,980 --> 04:45:35,300
According to the mainframe no one has been here for years

3431
04:45:35,620 --> 04:45:39,700
The whole city is stuck in a lockdown cycle from long ago if we disable it

3432
04:45:39,700 --> 04:45:43,220
We should be able to leave we'll need to bring the rest of the systems online

3433
04:45:43,860 --> 04:45:47,620
These computer holds the data we need we need to turn them on

3434
04:45:48,420 --> 04:45:53,220
While you do that, I'll look for passwords and encrypted keys to get into that system got it

3435
04:45:54,020 --> 04:45:56,020
Yeah, understood

3436
04:45:56,100 --> 04:45:58,100
Okay, turn these on

3437
04:45:59,380 --> 04:46:03,140
I actually really like areas that don't have freaking anything. Oh

3438
04:46:07,620 --> 04:46:10,500
That's me turning it on by walking on the keyboard

3439
04:46:12,100 --> 04:46:14,100
Oh, I can turn the phone. Hell yeah

3440
04:46:15,700 --> 04:46:17,700
Oh, let me jump that

3441
04:46:18,980 --> 04:46:20,820
Okay

3442
04:46:20,900 --> 04:46:24,980
Let's go. Oh, I missed. Sorry. Hold on one moment, please

3443
04:46:28,100 --> 04:46:30,100
And then done

3444
04:46:32,020 --> 04:46:37,940
It worked good job my friend. I found it. I know how to open the city something's off here

3445
04:46:39,620 --> 04:46:41,620
Wait, maybe there's a way around it

3446
04:46:46,580 --> 04:46:48,580
Roof control stage

3447
04:46:51,780 --> 04:46:56,420
There that's the workstation to open the city, but there's several layers of security preventing us from using it

3448
04:46:56,420 --> 04:46:58,180
Okay, that's understandable

3449
04:46:58,180 --> 04:47:03,220
Now we need to do what we do best me. I'll hack the machines and you destroy some stuff. Yeah

3450
04:47:04,740 --> 04:47:06,740
Oh, we actually destroyed the high table

3451
04:47:09,700 --> 04:47:11,780
Oh, so you're hacking what am I doing?

3452
04:47:14,500 --> 04:47:16,500
This isn't destroying

3453
04:47:17,460 --> 04:47:21,460
Okay, hold on there's a symbol here

3454
04:47:26,740 --> 04:47:28,740
Oh

3455
04:47:29,540 --> 04:47:31,540
Get this off

3456
04:47:31,700 --> 04:47:38,820
Okay, I will do my job do gel. Yeah, take this high table. Okay, this one

3457
04:47:42,820 --> 04:47:44,820
In this room

3458
04:47:47,220 --> 04:47:49,220
Um

3459
04:47:53,140 --> 04:47:58,260
Oh, there's a second one. What are you? Why are you like?

3460
04:48:03,140 --> 04:48:06,740
Am I supposed to go up? Oh, the circus

3461
04:48:11,780 --> 04:48:14,900
Okay, and then last but certainly not least

3462
04:48:15,860 --> 04:48:19,620
This one right here, which is connected to this

3463
04:48:21,300 --> 04:48:23,300
Open it up and then say this

3464
04:48:25,700 --> 04:48:31,620
Oh, it's so cute. Yeah, fuck it up. All that practice

3465
04:48:33,220 --> 04:48:35,220
Did I do it?

3466
04:48:37,540 --> 04:48:39,540
Hack, okay, okay, I understand

3467
04:48:40,500 --> 04:48:48,420
Did you take HP damage? Ouch

3468
04:48:52,660 --> 04:48:54,660
It's not what it looks like

3469
04:48:55,380 --> 04:48:59,220
It's not what it looks like. Oh no, we've got to keep going. Okay. It's not what it looks like

3470
04:48:59,220 --> 04:49:02,900
It's not what it looks like. We're totally not doing a hack. Please quick faster faster faster

3471
04:49:03,620 --> 04:49:08,260
Wow, he's taking HP damage, but it's okay. Oh

3472
04:49:09,300 --> 04:49:11,300
I

3473
04:49:11,380 --> 04:49:15,780
Can recharge once yes, yes recharge will recharge you please quick before we get stopped

3474
04:49:17,460 --> 04:49:19,460
Quick quick quick quick

3475
04:49:20,020 --> 04:49:21,620
Wow

3476
04:49:21,620 --> 04:49:25,220
Okay, we're picking up get on my back. I think this no, no, it's not it's not

3477
04:49:26,100 --> 04:49:28,340
Just kind of make the workstation. We can disable alarm. Yeah

3478
04:49:29,140 --> 04:49:34,260
We literally can heal you you're literally a robot. I have terrible news. You're literally a circuit board. We can heal you

3479
04:49:36,820 --> 04:49:38,980
Rift control right go do your thing

3480
04:49:41,860 --> 04:49:43,860
Oh wait, there's

3481
04:49:44,820 --> 04:49:46,820
That's it. We're safe

3482
04:49:48,180 --> 04:49:51,780
Listen I have something to tell you I knew the power requires to disable the city

3483
04:49:52,340 --> 04:49:57,220
Control center would be immense more than the strong body could handle but never the security disabled

3484
04:49:57,220 --> 04:50:01,620
I can take control of the system and open the city overriding it would destroy my software

3485
04:50:09,780 --> 04:50:13,700
Um, I'm pretty sure the software is him

3486
04:50:17,460 --> 04:50:20,500
By made that choice when I hooked into the first computer

3487
04:50:23,380 --> 04:50:26,260
Is he gonna die I can't cry

3488
04:50:28,180 --> 04:50:30,340
I don't want to cry wait no

3489
04:50:31,140 --> 04:50:33,140
And the consequences it could bring

3490
04:50:34,100 --> 04:50:36,100
I'm sorry. We won't see that. It's like no

3491
04:50:39,460 --> 04:50:43,940
I thought I needed to carry on in the memories of humanity to hold on to the past but I

3492
04:50:44,660 --> 04:50:48,580
Can see a future in the companion than you here. Let me take that off

3493
04:50:51,220 --> 04:50:56,500
You are my friend my very bad. Oh, no, why why do they have to make it sad?

3494
04:50:56,900 --> 04:50:59,620
It's literally I gave him a freaking car

3495
04:51:01,220 --> 04:51:04,740
Mine is thank you. No, I don't want the conversation

3496
04:51:07,220 --> 04:51:09,940
No, it's literally I gave him a fucking car

3497
04:51:11,540 --> 04:51:13,940
Why does everything have to be so sad?

3498
04:51:16,500 --> 04:51:18,500
No, please

3499
04:51:19,460 --> 04:51:22,100
Don't make a sweet body roll on the floor

3500
04:51:24,580 --> 04:51:26,420
No

3501
04:51:26,740 --> 04:51:29,220
I thought it was a game about being a wika

3502
04:51:33,220 --> 04:51:35,220
What the heck

3503
04:51:36,420 --> 04:51:39,380
No, we're curling up for a rest next time

3504
04:51:41,940 --> 04:51:43,940
Away

3505
04:51:48,340 --> 04:51:50,340
Oh my god

3506
04:51:51,300 --> 04:52:01,540
No, like literally so it's plug them back in he just needs a wee bit of a more GPU come on a GPU is just a rock

3507
04:52:01,540 --> 04:52:04,820
We tricked into thinking it's literally harvested from the air

3508
04:52:07,460 --> 04:52:09,460
Oh

3509
04:52:12,820 --> 04:52:14,820
Why

3510
04:52:15,540 --> 04:52:17,540
Oh

3511
04:52:28,660 --> 04:52:31,300
I don't feel better seeing everyone

3512
04:52:45,540 --> 04:52:52,740
Do you even see the surface to make it worth it? No, don't put me back here

3513
04:52:56,020 --> 04:52:58,020
Can at least take them with me

3514
04:52:59,700 --> 04:53:04,900
Yeah, no, don't no, no, don't sit down. Can I not take them with me?

3515
04:53:07,060 --> 04:53:12,500
Are you joking I can't even take them with me. Why not?

3516
04:53:15,060 --> 04:53:17,060
I

3517
04:53:18,740 --> 04:53:20,740
Bro

3518
04:53:22,340 --> 04:53:25,540
When the hero never gets the good ending honestly

3519
04:53:31,780 --> 04:53:36,100
The city is actually open you can freely get in and get out

3520
04:53:37,540 --> 04:53:42,980
Why does it say like that this city is actually open? There's an old way to freeze it

3521
04:53:44,820 --> 04:53:46,820
Oh

3522
04:53:48,100 --> 04:53:50,100
Oh, I'm gonna see my buddies at least

3523
04:53:52,740 --> 04:53:54,740
Now there's pigeons and shit I can eat

3524
04:53:59,700 --> 04:54:02,200
And my friends here I'm calling for them

3525
04:54:15,780 --> 04:54:17,780
Oh

3526
04:54:39,940 --> 04:54:41,940
Wait, was that him

3527
04:54:42,900 --> 04:54:48,340
Was he uploaded into the mainframe was that him at the left?

3528
04:54:52,260 --> 04:54:54,260
Was that him

3529
04:54:59,220 --> 04:55:01,220
Despite that you're still just the cat

3530
04:55:02,020 --> 04:55:06,900
I don't like when you cry I fucking can't stand why do the games have to be so mean?

3531
04:55:06,980 --> 04:55:11,700
Why can't it just always be a happy ending? I mean like shit cameo is a happy ending

3532
04:55:11,940 --> 04:55:13,940
Like fuck me man

3533
04:55:15,380 --> 04:55:18,900
Thank you dimsy dan for the cat sticker the neck with sticker

3534
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:25,940
They are just old home humans kopium. He took control of the system the drone got fried, but he's up like done in the system

3535
04:55:25,940 --> 04:55:31,780
Yeah, so there's their stray two coming out and then we can like shove them in a robot and then we live happily ever after

3536
04:55:34,500 --> 04:55:36,500
Oh

3537
04:55:36,980 --> 04:55:40,900
Whenever you cry it reminds me what a sweet girl you are. I literally cannae handle it

3538
04:55:40,900 --> 04:55:45,540
Like why can't we not just like fucking be pod champ? Have you ever played pokemon mystery dungeon?

3539
04:55:46,340 --> 04:55:49,780
I think so, but I was very young so I didn't understand what was going on

3540
04:55:52,820 --> 04:55:54,820
Wow

3541
04:55:55,060 --> 04:55:57,060
Wasn't a model twitching

3542
04:55:58,980 --> 04:56:01,860
I look like it was the rooms a bit dark so it's probably why

3543
04:56:03,780 --> 04:56:07,700
He lives happily ever after anyway if there's a straight mean he's gonna have

3544
04:56:08,100 --> 04:56:10,420
To struggle for it. Don't cry. No, I'm like

3545
04:56:11,380 --> 04:56:18,180
Why I just wanted to be like one thing. I'm such a crybaby and everyone like literally can't can't beat the crybaby allegations

3546
04:56:18,980 --> 04:56:22,260
Well, that just thought I was supposed to be like this cool neko game

3547
04:56:24,100 --> 04:56:31,140
Um, well, you know you're mucking about and like a post-apocalyptic scenario and it's like oh by the way the person

3548
04:56:31,620 --> 04:56:35,540
That you started with oh the parish and I was like, oh, thanks for that

3549
04:56:35,620 --> 04:56:40,180
That's really gonna brighten up my day after that. No, seriously that I'm so happy

3550
04:56:40,580 --> 04:56:43,860
That the person who helped me through the entirety of the game

3551
04:56:44,260 --> 04:56:50,740
Who helped me translate and speak to all the robots and gave me all this advice and we discovered that was actually a human

3552
04:56:50,900 --> 04:56:54,660
And they were a scientist. Oh, no, that's lovely that they just perished right at the end

3553
04:56:54,980 --> 04:57:00,100
No, thanks for that really really cheered up my day really made my heart speed up. Okay. Yeah, like

3554
04:57:01,460 --> 04:57:03,460
Cute crying mummy cup

3555
04:57:05,540 --> 04:57:10,820
I don't need to beat the embrace the crybaby embrace that emotion. Honestly. Why?

3556
04:57:15,060 --> 04:57:17,060
Oh, can't he handle it

3557
04:57:19,540 --> 04:57:23,860
Oh, but we love her crybaby. Honestly, it's freaking terrible for it

3558
04:57:25,540 --> 04:57:27,540
So out of 10

3559
04:57:30,420 --> 04:57:32,420
Honestly, I have to admit

3560
04:57:32,660 --> 04:57:38,180
That was a very fair game in the gameplay

3561
04:57:39,220 --> 04:57:41,220
my only

3562
04:57:41,220 --> 04:57:42,740
thing is

3563
04:57:42,740 --> 04:57:47,380
Maybe give a directional point to where you're supposed to go

3564
04:57:48,740 --> 04:57:50,980
Then again, I can see the argument for being like

3565
04:57:51,620 --> 04:57:56,580
Look, we've given you signs of where the shops you need to go and I kept stumbling into the puzzle somehow

3566
04:57:58,260 --> 04:58:01,140
But I do it. I think at the start we took a lot of time

3567
04:58:03,380 --> 04:58:06,420
I can hear my fucking neighbour in the garden right now

3568
04:58:08,260 --> 04:58:10,260
I swear to god if he puts on that lawnmower

3569
04:58:11,700 --> 04:58:14,660
She's sobbing hard. No, I'm no I'm no sobbing. I'm all right

3570
04:58:15,460 --> 04:58:19,060
Um our little crybaby seaweed. Honestly

3571
04:58:20,500 --> 04:58:24,020
At least the cat survived. Oh, no, I wouldn't even touch the game

3572
04:58:24,420 --> 04:58:30,100
I'm sure if the cat perished in the game like everyone I would have heard about it and wouldn't even touch the damn thing

3573
04:58:30,980 --> 04:58:32,580
Um

3574
04:58:32,580 --> 04:58:34,980
Now you can't even parley vu with the robots. I know

3575
04:58:36,820 --> 04:58:41,540
Um, are they confirmed that there's a straight to in production? Hold on. Let me check

3576
04:58:48,100 --> 04:58:49,700
Straight

3577
04:58:49,700 --> 04:58:52,900
Let's see is straight to in production

3578
04:58:54,500 --> 04:58:59,700
Not like you see it in the dark straight who is not confirmed as of yet. Wow. I'm surprised

3579
04:59:00,900 --> 04:59:04,260
Sorry, I need to sync up my mouse, but I keep them up, don't I?

3580
04:59:06,820 --> 04:59:12,660
Strony has been keeping the sea salty because of these games. Honestly. I can't stop greeting

3581
04:59:14,740 --> 04:59:20,660
We say greeting in scots. So yeah, Strony that was four hours. So I guess five hours is to 100% the game

3582
04:59:21,460 --> 04:59:25,620
Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't really know what you'd get if you 100% assume just as memories

3583
04:59:26,180 --> 04:59:33,220
I think they're gonna do a different game in the same universe. It is still a pretty recent game. Is it? Oh, okay

3584
04:59:33,460 --> 04:59:36,660
I just remember when it came out. There was like a lot of hype about it

3585
04:59:37,300 --> 04:59:39,300
because like no one expected that

3586
04:59:40,260 --> 04:59:41,620
So

3587
04:59:41,620 --> 04:59:43,620
Yeah, we're learning

3588
04:59:44,580 --> 04:59:46,580
That was cute though. Um

3589
04:59:47,380 --> 04:59:49,380
We'll just say it was 10 out of 10

3590
04:59:49,700 --> 04:59:58,660
For me personally, no, however, I can definitely see this appealing to the masses and being very fair

3591
04:59:58,900 --> 05:00:04,420
Like I think gameplay wise I messed up twice in the entire thing

3592
05:00:04,900 --> 05:00:09,860
And if I knew what was coming up like once I learned what was coming up, I could avoid what happened. So

3593
05:00:10,980 --> 05:00:12,980
Yeah, I don't think it's a

3594
05:00:13,460 --> 05:00:15,460
a wee problem

3595
05:00:16,420 --> 05:00:21,620
Stray came out in 2020. Okay. No game games take like at least three years development at this point

3596
05:00:22,900 --> 05:00:29,620
And I think in 8.5 animation and music was good gameplay was simple, but good story was good

3597
05:00:31,220 --> 05:00:33,220
Story was great

3598
05:00:33,780 --> 05:00:35,060
um

3599
05:00:35,060 --> 05:00:36,740
Yeah, I think that was

3600
05:00:36,740 --> 05:00:40,020
I think it's definitely on the higher for me personally. It's not a 10 out of 10

3601
05:00:40,100 --> 05:00:44,180
However, I can completely see where it's a 10 out of 10 for other people like

3602
05:00:44,740 --> 05:00:49,780
Again fair gameplay wasn't asking me to do like a billion different things at one time

3603
05:00:50,180 --> 05:00:56,260
I'm sure maybe exploring for people that enjoy exploring, but I don't really enjoy talking to NPCs

3604
05:00:56,660 --> 05:00:58,660
um that much

3605
05:00:58,660 --> 05:01:00,660
um

3606
05:01:01,140 --> 05:01:05,780
I know some people enjoy the dilly dallying, but I don't know for that game

3607
05:01:05,780 --> 05:01:09,300
I was like, oh, let's go to the net like let's do the next mission. Let's do the next mission

3608
05:01:09,300 --> 05:01:13,540
Like let's not dilly dally and like stop to talk like I guess cameo is a good example of like

3609
05:01:13,620 --> 05:01:17,460
I did the whole campaign and I only talked to who I needed to to get my fruits on that

3610
05:01:18,580 --> 05:01:24,180
This is definitely one of those games of all time from what I've seen I would give an 8.5 and I don't see a need to play it

3611
05:01:24,900 --> 05:01:28,500
I personally wouldn't replay it, but it is a good game

3612
05:01:29,940 --> 05:01:31,940
The game is pretty lore heavy, is it?

3613
05:01:33,060 --> 05:01:38,180
I think maybe yeah, maybe if you solo explored and you know

3614
05:01:38,820 --> 05:01:45,540
Read everything there was to say and found all the wee secrets and memories and that maybe you know, it'd feel like a bit better

3615
05:01:47,460 --> 05:01:52,100
Yeah gameplay wise it isn't that appealing. Yeah, it's I would say it's relatively easy

3616
05:01:52,100 --> 05:01:58,580
Which I quite I'm enjoying an easy gaming experience these days. Like I'm really addicted to baltro

3617
05:01:58,580 --> 05:02:04,340
But it's so hard not to like slam it down every week. So I'm behaving. I promise there's no baltro for a couple of weeks

3618
05:02:04,580 --> 05:02:09,380
Um, I've really been enjoying stuff that doesn't require like insane reaction time

3619
05:02:10,020 --> 05:02:15,860
Because that's like where I get frustrated. I have to like replay the same mission over and over. I do wish we had our

3620
05:02:16,740 --> 05:02:17,620
aim

3621
05:02:17,620 --> 05:02:24,340
A cutscene where all the cats got together though. That's a bit annoying. I like understand the cats freeing back on the surface

3622
05:02:25,300 --> 05:02:30,420
But I wanted it to see its pals, you know, like is that is that too much to ask for chat noir?

3623
05:02:31,060 --> 05:02:37,220
In a two tail polka dot. Oh, I forgot his name and cally-cally clear. I think

3624
05:02:39,780 --> 05:02:41,780
Stray is one of those

3625
05:02:42,180 --> 05:02:43,380
huge

3626
05:02:43,380 --> 05:02:50,820
Intractable movie type games. I'm gonna not even pretend. I know what that word. We should have baltro Monday. Nah, I've got

3627
05:02:52,020 --> 05:02:57,220
I've planned a little bit ahead of what streams I'm doing when my dad gets here. Um

3628
05:02:57,220 --> 05:03:05,860
I've got an Orwell game. I'm not even kidding. It's like a 1984 game. I'm forcing you to play it with me

3629
05:03:05,860 --> 05:03:08,980
I don't care. I honestly don't care. I'm forcing you to play with me

3630
05:03:08,980 --> 05:03:12,820
And I'm sticking a tinfoil hat on me when we do the entire gameplay

3631
05:03:13,220 --> 05:03:17,220
I need to start using like vtuber assets like this more because the ears are so funny

3632
05:03:19,460 --> 05:03:23,220
Interactable, okay. Yeah, is that a retro game? No, it's like a

3633
05:03:24,180 --> 05:03:26,660
I don't know. You just like click through the text and stuff

3634
05:03:27,300 --> 05:03:29,300
I'll read it out though. Don't worry. I'll read it out

3635
05:03:30,660 --> 05:03:36,100
But yeah, that was good. I enjoyed that. I'm gonna is there any uh veal or girly pops on

3636
05:03:37,460 --> 05:03:41,060
Yeah, I mean the review said the game takes five hours. So

3637
05:03:42,100 --> 05:03:45,540
Uh, I really be stumbling very luckily into that stuff. Uh

3638
05:03:46,820 --> 05:03:51,300
Is there any veal or girls on that I can redirect into just the question

3639
05:03:51,460 --> 05:03:57,700
She be on Elden Ring. Let's effin go

3640
05:04:00,340 --> 05:04:02,500
Let's effin go

3641
05:04:02,500 --> 05:04:07,620
Elden Ring it is time. Rise do you turn is she playing at the proper way or is harem

3642
05:04:08,180 --> 05:04:11,540
Is harem coming into help her or is she doing it the proper way?

3643
05:04:12,340 --> 05:04:17,140
As the development team intended, what do you mean you don't play Elden Ring as a multiplayer experience?

3644
05:04:17,220 --> 05:04:21,220
What are you talking about? It's a perfect multiplayer experience

3645
05:04:22,260 --> 05:04:28,500
That yours are cute. Read them up it. Let us go. Oh, no, somebody save she be. She hasn't summoned anyone yet

3646
05:04:29,300 --> 05:04:36,500
Oh my god, she's so brave. I'm like as soon as as soon as I had access to the summoning circles. I was like

3647
05:04:39,460 --> 05:04:41,460
Come play with mome

3648
05:04:42,660 --> 05:04:47,540
Oh also, uh all my thumbnails are up like all my streams are up for this week

3649
05:04:48,260 --> 05:04:53,300
We are playing the jellybean game, which is called fall guys. So if you don't have fall guys

3650
05:04:53,860 --> 05:04:58,900
Installed please do it for me if you want to play with me. I'd like to play with you. That's okay

3651
05:04:59,540 --> 05:05:03,860
But I know some people don't like downloading the launcher because I think it's an EA game

3652
05:05:04,100 --> 05:05:09,460
And I'm sorry if you don't so it's okay if you don't want to download it and play with me because of the launcher because I know it's a

3653
05:05:10,180 --> 05:05:12,180
thing

3654
05:05:12,180 --> 05:05:14,180
A real pro gamer not like me

3655
05:05:14,340 --> 05:05:15,460
Yeah

3656
05:05:15,460 --> 05:05:18,980
Some girls just like being princess carried in games and some like a challenge

3657
05:05:19,460 --> 05:05:24,900
I think a lot of people will show you in that game. Yeah, but the reeflings get to touch me and get to jellybean pull on me

3658
05:05:24,980 --> 05:05:28,180
Not that I had to make a new epic account

3659
05:05:28,820 --> 05:05:34,020
Hackers tick my your epic freaking account. Wait. Did you spend money on it?

3660
05:05:34,660 --> 05:05:37,540
All downloaded and ready to go. I just don't like fall guys

3661
05:05:38,660 --> 05:05:40,900
We were playing other multi game experiences

3662
05:05:41,860 --> 05:05:44,100
We're actually going to be making puzzles together

3663
05:05:45,060 --> 05:05:49,380
In a week or so, but I'm going to hate what I'm going to make the image

3664
05:05:50,660 --> 05:05:54,020
And I'm going to make it really difficult and I'll see if we can do it

3665
05:05:57,620 --> 05:05:59,780
A bit those of us who have on steam

3666
05:06:00,740 --> 05:06:04,420
I think you can like play with me. No problem because I just give you the code

3667
05:06:05,380 --> 05:06:08,900
Who would hate the fortnite launcher? No, it's a fortnite. It's fall guy

3668
05:06:10,980 --> 05:06:13,620
No money, but I lost some of the free games I claimed. Um

3669
05:06:15,300 --> 05:06:17,300
Shocking

3670
05:06:17,300 --> 05:06:20,500
Puzzles with Johnny. Yeah, but I'm going to hide the screen

3671
05:06:20,500 --> 05:06:25,780
So you don't know what the puzzle is and then I'll give you the link and then we complete the artwork together

3672
05:06:28,020 --> 05:06:29,140
Um

3673
05:06:29,140 --> 05:06:31,300
I had to catch up on Isaac

3674
05:06:31,300 --> 05:06:35,300
So I'm ready for multiplayer when you said this game wants you to suffer. Yeah, you're right

3675
05:06:35,300 --> 05:06:37,780
I remember why I draw oh the game does not

3676
05:06:38,180 --> 05:06:42,100
Want you to win it is a punishing game. Um

3677
05:06:42,900 --> 05:06:45,780
Like I honestly enjoy just playing it casually

3678
05:06:45,780 --> 05:06:49,860
I've not actually hardcore tried to go for any unlocks in a very long time

3679
05:06:50,100 --> 05:06:53,620
I should have showed off my unlocks because I had a I've got two

3680
05:06:54,900 --> 05:06:59,460
Alternative characters that aren't unlocked on Isaac and I keep forgetting to get them

3681
05:07:00,740 --> 05:07:04,980
But yeah, the game does not like you like I'm pretty sure pretty much all my unlocks are like

3682
05:07:05,060 --> 05:07:09,380
I randomly stumbled upon an R key. Um, and then did what I needed to do

3683
05:07:10,900 --> 05:07:16,100
Um, but yeah, that was like a really good experience. Is this freaking shame that I cried honestly

3684
05:07:16,100 --> 05:07:18,580
I'm such a fucking crybaby. Can he stop it?

3685
05:07:19,300 --> 05:07:24,180
Um, but that was really good. Um as for what I'm going to do when I go off lane

3686
05:07:24,900 --> 05:07:28,180
I've got two more ASMR collab scripts to write and then I have

3687
05:07:28,660 --> 05:07:35,860
Officially like given everyone what they need to collab with what I would like them to give me for the collab and then

3688
05:07:37,060 --> 05:07:41,860
I'm going to take a break from doing asking people for ASMR collabs just for a teeny weeny bit

3689
05:07:42,420 --> 05:07:45,700
Um, and then I'm going to focus on my

3690
05:07:46,500 --> 05:07:50,020
sub scraper milestone. Thank you videos. Um

3691
05:07:51,620 --> 05:07:57,780
And also the meme videos we've actually got the pregnancy ASMR comment that sounds bizarre saying that in a sense

3692
05:07:57,780 --> 05:08:02,180
I've got the pregnancy ASMR coming up. I've got hypnotizes you to like, um

3693
05:08:03,140 --> 05:08:09,620
Pineapple on pizza. I hope you can sleep. Yes. Um, I get I'm probably gonna go for a nap

3694
05:08:09,620 --> 05:08:14,740
But it's it's the only way I seem to be able to sleep that minute is go lie down

3695
05:08:15,780 --> 05:08:18,260
And then when I wake up I do a big chunk of work

3696
05:08:18,340 --> 05:08:23,620
Like the girls all had shorts come out today if I'm not mistaken. I think the mercy might have had a short come out

3697
05:08:23,620 --> 05:08:25,620
Let me see one more check

3698
05:08:26,020 --> 05:08:31,860
Um, I ordered a four for a zero one of them, which is absolutely hilarious. I cannot wait for you guys to see it

3699
05:08:33,220 --> 05:08:38,340
Oh, no, the mercy one must come out tomorrow. So it's only a season one that came out. Um, I

3700
05:08:38,900 --> 05:08:42,260
gave any to she is gonna upload it when she wants to upload it

3701
05:08:42,900 --> 05:08:44,180
and

3702
05:08:44,180 --> 05:08:49,300
Yes, I've linked the ac short if you want to watch that literally it's in the the the chat

3703
05:08:49,860 --> 05:08:54,420
A right now at the top. It's a funny clip. I was absolutely hilarious

3704
05:08:54,900 --> 05:09:00,340
It might actually be the first a clip on the viewer like clip channel. Um

3705
05:09:01,380 --> 05:09:05,540
We're gonna very slowly start putting stuff up. Um

3706
05:09:09,060 --> 05:09:14,180
Sorry, I just opened up Marshmallow just to see if anyone said anything the first sentence I read

3707
05:09:14,500 --> 05:09:18,100
One of the reasons I love you so much is that you can't spell or read

3708
05:09:20,260 --> 05:09:26,820
Refling oh my god, you're not supposed to say that. I mean you can Amy has a new one with her rats

3709
05:09:27,700 --> 05:09:32,580
Oh, did she post it? Okay. Uh, I will link. Uh, I'm actually gonna link Emmys

3710
05:09:33,620 --> 05:09:39,540
Tomorrow's stream. I will pin Emmys. I've pinned acs today. I'll pin Emmys main. I'm not really that bothered about

3711
05:09:42,500 --> 05:09:45,140
Wait hypnosis about pineapple on pizza. I missed that

3712
05:09:46,100 --> 05:09:50,020
Um, when we were meme I was memeing with the reeflings like in another stream

3713
05:09:50,500 --> 05:09:56,260
And I think I was like, oh that would be a really funny meme video like someone said it and I was like, oh my god

3714
05:09:56,820 --> 05:10:03,060
What if I did it hypnotizes you to like pineapple on pizza ASMR because like obviously I like my meme and shitpost day one

3715
05:10:04,740 --> 05:10:10,580
Um, or a little illiterate little seaweed doesn't know our abc's or one two three's honestly. Um

3716
05:10:11,540 --> 05:10:17,860
What was the rest of that message though? I don't really know why but I can't stop myself from wanting to squeeze you tight in my embrace

3717
05:10:17,860 --> 05:10:22,500
And kiss you on the forehead when you spell something wrong, especially when you get flustered over at a dory

3718
05:10:22,500 --> 05:10:25,860
I always have. Oh, thank you reeflin. I'm glad it doesn't frustrate you

3719
05:10:26,420 --> 05:10:31,220
I feel like when people like see how I type it's like, oh my god, how does your mind work like that?

3720
