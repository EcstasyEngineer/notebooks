WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in this

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
No time to wait for my days, of all the time

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Right, this is British lore

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh wait, hold on

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I have no idea what it's like even it says I'm online yet

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
No it doesn't, oh this is the thing

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Whenever I look back on a board, I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
But when I look back on the board, and all that, it's all fine

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
All fine

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The fine line

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Right, where are we? Nope

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Nope, not yet

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Not playing the game yet

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Coming at you with a fried voice

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you, Dule Lover for becoming a member in case that did not register

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
She loves it, she loves it

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
I had to do some bit of background work

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
What's the background work you ask?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I put Shabby Cotton Bum's memberships live

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
So if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But she might not say your name during the stream though

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Shabby Cotton Bum, maybe I should be a bit bigger

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Cause I'm kinda talking

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It's shocking

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Hold on, I'll actually go weave because BOOM!

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon little reeflings

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
What is on the agendination for week three?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, let me talk you through it, okay?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
So we're starting off strong with the ASMR stream

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
At the usual time

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute pause

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch along

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Which is none other than the first Transformers movie

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
With Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
We are playing Zelda Minish Cap

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Because for member stream, we are going to be doing the forbidden tear list

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Ooooooh, not the way you want the big yin

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And I get to answer it honestly this time

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Then the rest of the day on Wednesday

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
It is the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I know it's shocking, hold on, wait

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Chat, you'd let me stretch

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Why the frick frack diddley-dack?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Does it not let me stretch chat?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh my god, let me stretch you

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Why is it locked?

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Brev, brev

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm trying to explain

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What am I doing? Anyway

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh my god

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Eh, you be next

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Thank you for coming on member

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh my god, is that the mascot for um

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
WeleuVeton Inc

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm so sorry

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Chat, her name evades me right now

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
From hololiveleuVeton Inc

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh my goodness

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Anyway

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Um, we are going to do old school runescape on Thursday

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, and now my chat's broken completely

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, thanks OBS

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
No, really, thank you

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Please don't ever cook again

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, it finally worked

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Inna, yes Inna

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Chat, yeah

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Well, it's fixed, I can actually read chat now

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Inna, yes Inna

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
In my hole, thank you

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Um, let's see

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So then we're going to do old school runescape

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
However, check it

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with WeleuVeton Inc

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And guess what?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It's with Mercy

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I should have picked any kind of yandere

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
But I got Mercy

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
And we're going to be playing Goose Game

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We're going to be playing it at her time

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So we're only going to do a little bit of runescape

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Um, so a couple hours of runescape and blabbing away

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Because I want to give Mercy my all

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
She's not ready for the rotism, your honor

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Memberships are showing up to me on mobile

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Thank you, Omar and Simpson

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It still doesn't display properly

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Even though I have the full chat up

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Because we are redirecting into her

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
In a self-made cosplay of sheebie

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Yep, that's a full sentence

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Let me check them out by discovering the alternative twiers

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
If you don't know what the alternative twiers are

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Feel free to check out who the accounts are following

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I wanted to make the collab super easy for her

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
So I am going to have to rest and snort

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Some...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Shouldn't have said that

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm going to be taking lots of cola

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay, I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm going to start lagging a little bit there

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Ain't I meant for you either

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You don't have to give me money to tell me this

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You just realise that, Omar

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
You don't have to give me money to type things in chat

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Scotland forever

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Yes, erm...

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Count up for the life of me, find it

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I bought a new heart rate monitor

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Because my other one was bust

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Erm, and it's already gone

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So I think I'm about to purchase the third one

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Lucky me

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Erm, I'll probably...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
If I send a cure package to the girls

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Like, for Donothons, me just looking in my...

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Others have cute mascots

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
We have a cute Scottish girl

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
What?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Wait

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Did Brian talk?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Did Brian say...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
No, did Brian say anything there?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Oh shit, I didn't see that

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Aren't...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Others have cute mascots

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
We have a cute Scottish...

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Girl

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Thank you for the five iron reaper

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I appreciate it

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, I never heard that

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Sorry, I have my headset muted

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Because I have the freaking game sound in the background

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
It's so loud

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Wait, what?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
No, wait

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We're playing Nero

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Erm

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
If you didn't see

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
On a game called Don't Starve

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That's exactly AC's lore

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Because she had to hunt for her food

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So, rather curious

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Rather curious, aren't they?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Erm

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
What else? Elden...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes, Elden Ring the DLC

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Elden Ring the DLC, okay?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It launches on Friday

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm like 99% sure

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Erm

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
We have a lot of areas to clear anyway

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And I am under the impression

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
We have to perish the enemy

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
That's at the top of this elevator

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
In that graveyard

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Unironically, Ryan Goslin was the one

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That vanquished him

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Because I couldn't do it, I kept getting attacked

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
So the refland's on a freaking debuff

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Like a severe debuff

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Whilst I was running away from this boss

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
All came flying in

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And I'm like 99% sure that was a Ryan Goslin kill that one

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Erm

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I do say shortcaller

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Now, I do have a shortcaller

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're gonna test it out at the start of stream

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
If I can handle it

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I will permit my reflings to zap me

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Every time I cause us to die

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Erm, I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Whenever we get near an enemy

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Now

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I need you to open your eyeballs for me, okay?

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Because members' ASMR stream starts one hour earlier

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Than my usual start time

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The reason for that is

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Imi, Azura, Mercy, Strawny

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Are doing a four man uno collab

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So that I can't get away from Mercy this week

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I'm already entangled in her snare, you know

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Erm, and then

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
So that's two streams that day

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Erm

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And then and then and then

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Sorry, I did apologize for your head

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I didn't get a good sleep last night

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Again

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Erm

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm getting very tired

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Actually, I'll tell you something really bad

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
So I had to take sleep medicine the other day

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But whenever I take sleep medicine

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I have problems going number two, okay?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And then I hurt my butt going number two

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
So if there's anyone that wants to help kiss it better

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
And then Elden Ring part two

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
We again will have a full endurance on that

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
I am literally weaving so much content in between this as well

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Because I'm also starting up my thank you series

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
My one ASMR video pair 1000 views thank you series

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I am absolutely delighted

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And exhausted to learn that I

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
My scheduled uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I've already reached 7000

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Which means the debt of six is still to be paid

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Erm

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm very thankful

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But oh man I'm tired

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Erm

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
After this stream today

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm actually going to record three

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Collab ASMR's from my side

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Because three girls have given me their side

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Erm

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
So I need to edit that

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Unending ASMR's

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Back to back to back

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Erm

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
There's so many replays now

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I know I'm busy

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
My mum is very busy

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Erm

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
If you didn't know

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
AC's meme ASMR has gone live

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It is sniffing ASMR

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
If you like that trigger

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Mercy's ASMR has like

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I got a fucking cat here in my mouth all the time

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Erm

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah you really do get used to it when you get cats honestly

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Erm

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You're just like oh that's just another part of the video

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Erm

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Mercy has released Yandere ASMR

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Erm

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Please if you absolutely despise the meme ASMR's

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I got them to create

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well guess who fucking created them for them

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Me

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
So if you hate them

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Don't be like

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Mmm

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
This video is stinky

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Be like

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Mmm

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Strongly stinky

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Because she came up with a concept

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Okay

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
So don't

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
If you didn't like it don't worry

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
It's not like it's the only ASMR video

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
They're ever going to produce for free on YouTube

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Like fucking relax

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
For one

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Erm

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Haha

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I'm sorry

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I'm literally fighting imaginary people

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
One person has said that at all

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I know for a fact no one has said that

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And I'm like already swinging on behalf of the girls

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Like don't say nothing about my girls okay

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Erm

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
But yes

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Mercy's ASMR actually I was influenced by

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Well

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I had already created this over a year ago

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
And I think this was before the creator of Yandere Sim

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Got outed for all of his

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Erm

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm 32

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You have so much power over me tweets

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Or whatever the tweet was

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I can't remember the ins and outs of it

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Erm

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
But

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
If you didn't know

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
In Yandere Sim

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
There's a mechanic

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Where in order to lower your craziness levels

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
You need to laugh

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
You need to laugh very loud and very startling

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And if anyone is around you while you laugh

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It alerts them

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
And I was like

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
How did I do that for Mercy

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
So

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I did an intro

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Setting up the plot

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
She comes and finds you type thing

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And then she laughs like a maniac

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Ear to ear in the mic

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And I absolutely love it

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I absolutely love it

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
But I think that's cause I knew about

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I've never actually played Yandere Sim but

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Preemptive defense is a good strategy

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Literally just smashing people's skulls in

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
No one has said a thing to me

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But the rage has already taken over

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Erm

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
The only discord group with speedrun pan records

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Honestly

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Also

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
And

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh did Emi release it?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
So

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I went the complete meme route for Emi

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
But Emi isn't quite with me

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
On the same page

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Which is fine

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
It's completely fine

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
She has complete control

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
So I was like

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Upload it if you want it

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Don't

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh wait she did upload it

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Okay

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So she kept the thumbnail the same

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Okay

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I wasn't gonna like it

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Okay okay okay

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So she's called the video

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Alleyway Tingle Dealer

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
That's good title

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I like that title

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
My title was

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
VTuber Sells you

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Tingles in an alleyway

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I think or something like that

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
We did have to

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The artist at the time drew AC

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Emi

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Sorry they're twins

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Drew Emi

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Not Pattan

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
So we had to put a little

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Sutton Sutton over

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I loved the 30 minute Japanese one

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I'm glad you enjoyed it

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That is basically

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
What unscripted

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
ASMR

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Turns it into

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
If I don't have a script

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I will yap my head off

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So Emi also has her meme ASMR

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Now that she's monetised

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Which is fan-tiddly-astic

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The next

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Meme ASMR is Shibi

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
To do it once

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Once your monetisation stream

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I know professional streamer by the way

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Once your monetisation stream

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Has finished

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
My dear Shibi

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Would you like me to upload and

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Pub

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Is it publish?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
No

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Like upload and

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Put live your

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Meme ASMR

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
You guys are gonna freaking love the plot

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I came up with Shibi

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Shibi's plot was so unique

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I had to go away and record folly sounds

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Which is rare for me

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Because I have a massive bank

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Of sounds that I can

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Come from

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
It was great

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
You were loving the ear mass

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Oh you like the 7 girl collab

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh yeah

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
You like 7 of us being together

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
7 whole neckos

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well if you're excited for that

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
There's another

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Next week

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
There's another 7 man collab

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Ohhh

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm gonna have to edit it

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
The work never ends

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I don't know what you're saying

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Anonymous

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I loved ASMR you did with DTW

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
And the rest

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh thank you

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It was so hard to put together

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
You know she's such a busy person

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I was so excited to see this one

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Oh I'm glad you like it

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Thank you for the tip Anonymous

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yes

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
7 man

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No 7 person collab

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
With another girl

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
VA

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Surprise surprise

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
You've already guessed what channel it's going on

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
There's no way in heck you don't know who it is

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And then after that

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
For next week

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
There's another 7 man collab

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I need to put together

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
The work never ends

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
But the work is good

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It's like that good kind of stress

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Wait I'm gonna need confirmation

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Right think of one VA

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That I talk to all the time

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And burst in this chat all the time

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Thank

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Thank

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
That's who's next

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
And then

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
The next one after that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I actually did a watch along of us

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Because I have the artwork so I can edit it

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But then the fourth

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
7 man collab

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm waiting on this animator

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
To animate the artwork

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And the worst part is

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Well actually

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
It's not the worst part

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
The animator that I usually use

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Are like

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh I've just had a wedding

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And I'm like

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh my god congrats

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Meanwhile

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
My stuff has been

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Unedited

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And the deadline has slipped

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Almost 2 weeks now

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
And I'm like congrats on your wedding

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But your honeymoon phase is over

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Please get off of her

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And let her have some rest

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Okay

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
And do my work

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Thanks I paid you for this

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
So can you just do it

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
That'd be great

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Because

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm currently fricking

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Waiting on

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh mama yunya

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
What's so proud

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
No not mimosa

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
No I do have a collab with mimosa

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
But that's a one on one collab

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm jumping on her

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I said mimosa you're mine

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
There's actually another member

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Of yunmi plus as a 3dio

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I need to write the plot

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
And send it to her

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
And another piece of work

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Do you want me to get him to say that?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I could do that usually

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Wait wait wait

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Does your dad talk in Scots too?

Got a harsher accent than me

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
So my mum

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
My mum told me not to speak in slang

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
But my dad does

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Cause he is a

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I mean he just speaks slang

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
But my mum doesn't

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
So I don't really do it

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Cause is your dad single?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
No

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Oh my god

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000

Thank you anonymous for the tip

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Introducing a refling to her dad

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
As her boyfriend

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
And he's sitting there all

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Staring at that and it does

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Not to hurt his co-

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
No!

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
My dad's like

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Super nice and approachable

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You don't need to be scared of my dad

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Honestly

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Like he'd be like

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oh are you looking after Shawnee?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
And then you go

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
In your voice

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Cause you're like

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Scared of him

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
And then he'll go

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Is she happy?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
And then you go

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I think so

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
In your wee voice

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Cause you're trembling

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
And then after that

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Oh good that's it

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
My dad

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
As long as I'm happy

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
My dad's happy

Super duper simple

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000

It's just

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Nice

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
It's nice to do that

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Reflings are happy

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm happy

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000

She cusses me out regularly

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
With a smile on her face

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh that's terrible

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
What is the Scottish shotgun

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
And how's it different?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I don't know

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
There's haggies in your face

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Instead of pellets

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
Papastrone looks like

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
The dad from How to Train Your Dragon

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Wait hold on

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Let me

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
How to train your dragon

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
That exhibition

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
No

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
My dad doesn't

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
No he doesn't have beard

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
No beard

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
All the way

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
He doesn't have beard

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
But he has

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Not stubble

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
All the way

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
He

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Want to

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Actually I'll tell you

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
This is really funny

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
One time

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
My dad tried to grow a beard

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
And I was mortified

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I was like

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Oh

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
No

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It's my mom's single

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
No

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You're teasing me

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Refling

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
How do you think your dad would respond

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
If

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Refling said

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Your daughter calls me daddy too

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Would I call you daddy?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I wouldn't think I'd call you daddy

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Like

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
In my accent

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Daddy's pretty

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Jarring and cringe

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Like

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh yeah I like that daddy

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Mmm yeah

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Like no

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Do you want me to tell him

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Do you want me to tell him

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Like

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh dad by the way

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The refling's call me mummy

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I don't think he's going to get it

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
If I explain it

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Oh my god

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I don't think he's going to get it

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I think he's going to be like

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
What

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Oh I don't think he's going to

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Confend that

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
That would be amazing

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh yeah daddy

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Give me your space

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Hey sausage

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000

You been like

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Oh you been like

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I think every VTuber calls you mummy now

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I have to admit

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
It is an absolute cheat code

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Code

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
If any VTuber is like

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
You know

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Code name mummy

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm like

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh I'm cool with you

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Hearing you say mummy or daddy in your accent sounds

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Hot a f

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Anonymous

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Mummy or daddy in your accent

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Since hotspot

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Are you sure you're not listening

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
With rose tinted hearing aids

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Because

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Mumme

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Daddy

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Oh yes

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm feeling a bit

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Daddy

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
I'm redirecting into none other than Shibikotun Boom

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I don't know how

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Three of us has ended up doing feet

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Related celebrations

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Which is absolutely hilarious for monetization

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
That three of us has ended up showing our feetsies

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
That is hilarious

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And I will not be taking any statements

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Because oh my god

A channel that entered your girl

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Wait

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Scottish VTuber that tries

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Way too hard to prove that they're like a Scottish VTuber

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
We don't need to know if your mum is single

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Anonymous

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
We don't need to know if your mum is single

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
We have the only mum

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Oh that's so sweet

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
What the heck

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Thank you anonymous

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Do you want to know a fun fact

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
At Ville or headquarters

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
You guys have yet again supported the girls so much

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
That some money is on hold

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
You guys have supported the girls unanimously

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So much that

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
PayPal, emailed

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And we're like

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Some of your funds are on hold

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Not all of them

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000

You have literally

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You supported so much at the start

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You broke the code

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
And now some funds are on hold

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Because there's so much money coming in

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
It was actually a snowberry that did it

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So shout out to the snowberries

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
You broke

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
A little bit of the PayPal

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Holy shit

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Did you hear my cats

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Fucking I was playing with Gimli

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Before I started

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Stream

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I wish he was going mental again

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And I think I warmed her up too much

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Get supported

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Get supported

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Get supported

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Nero

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Imagine thinking

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
That listening to Strowney

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Saying mommy and daddy and I think

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Accent isn't hot

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
That would drive

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
That would be crazy

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Well, I get real close to you

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm looking in your eyes

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Is that what you should be saying?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Oh my god

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Do you know those convention

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Signs

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Those VTuber conventions

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Where they like hold a sign

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
And it's like five dollars to get stood on

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Bro

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
50 cent for me to smash

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
My arse on your face

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
How about that

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
One cent for me

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
A whispered daddy in your ear

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
How about that?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
We're gonna do a thing

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
At this VTuber convention

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
Called undercutting the market

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
You offer your goods

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
At an unbelievably discounted price

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Now I know undercutting

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Normally implies

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
There's going to be a raise later on

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
We ain't raising none of the prices

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
The prices you see

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Are the prices you get

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Pills out 20 bucks

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Take all my change

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
That's a steal

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Shawnee really undercutting the market now

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I'm like 99% sure

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I saw a cosplayer meme

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And she genuinely had a sign

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That said like five dollars

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
To be stepped on

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
And she was like

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I made like four hundred dollars

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
In a day type thing

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I'm like

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
So many different

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
We are getting married

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
With 50 children

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Thank you for the

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Is that Poland?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't know what that is

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Pozka?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So I guess for that much

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
We're getting married

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
With 50 children

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Nah, no children

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Did you see Azura's alternative artwork?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
She did break all

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
What?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Azura did what?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I didn't know she was down like that

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I didn't know she was down like that

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
I was like

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
She drew that of her own

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
She drew that

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Yes

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Azura's an artist

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
If you didn't know

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Literally all the girls have some sort of

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Drawing

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
History

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000

Congrats to those who caught it with your

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Face

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
In your face

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Oh my god we need to play Kung Fu Kiosk again

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
But I'm so bad at it

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Tornado

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Your doodles are so cute

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Oh no

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I don't know how to draw

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Actually I could show

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Oh I should have shown it on the

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Handcam stream

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I tried to learn to draw

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And I was consistent for like

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Five days before work

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Just got far too much

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I couldn't keep up with work naturally

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And the only thing

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I was wanting to draw

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Was the girls

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
So I have like

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Terrible pictures of me drawing the girls

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Like way back a couple of months ago now

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Sadly life got in the way

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
But I actually do genuinely think

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
If I ever hit

In your face

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Sorry

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm really

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
If you didn't know

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
There's a character called

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Candy Roll in Kung Fu Kiosk

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Her and Sweet and Sour

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Were my favourite characters

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And when my voice gets squeaky

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Internally

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Not externally

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
But internally

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Because of the

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
You hear yourself differently

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
From out loud

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
I sound like

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Candy Roll

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
When I get really high pitched

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
And

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I know all her voice lines

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Was it

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Echo Lillia

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
When you repeat

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
What you've heard

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
And she's like

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Kits my candy ass

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
And I just love her

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I love her so much

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
She's just like

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Ten out of ten characters

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh my god

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Gentoo Roller Skates confirmed

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Sorry

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Some sort of

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Girl on Roller Skates

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
I don't care

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Bimbo!

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Oh my god

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
We don't have a Bimbo

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Wait

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
What would the Bimbo be?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Maybe like a Bimbo

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That lures your expectations

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
And then does something

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Zenil Warrior

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Thank you for coming

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
A member

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Roller Skates

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
A Bimbo maid

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I would need something

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
A bit more than a maid

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I feel like a maid is very default

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't know

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
A maid

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
A Bimbo maid

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
That is quite nice though

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Bimbo maid is cute

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Because then she can

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Spill stuff on you

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
All the time

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
And then before you know

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Bimbo

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Possum

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
A possum

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Muds

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Remove this man's testicles

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Possum

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Possum

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Possum

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Possum

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Possum

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Possum

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Possum

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
As in the thing in the

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
That goes

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Anonymous

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm so conflicted about who you're

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Who is my favourite in violour

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Please hypnotise me

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Please hypnotise me to stay loyal to you mummy

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Keep that thought in mind

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Not for what you think

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Because next week

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
We may or may not be rating

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
A very unique audio roleplay

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Paul Lott

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
That involves me

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And the girls

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Maybe that kind of script

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Perhaps sea queen script

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Might solidify

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Who your choice is at the allure

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I am not a jealous mother

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
I assure you

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I wish to share all

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
All the goodness

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
All the spice

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I have clear ideas

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
A possum are kind of cute

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
A masochistic maid is

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Metta

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But it never goes out of the meta

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I was debating on when to get membership

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
And then I decided

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
If it's not on the day

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Strongly offers

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
50 cent butt smashes

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
What day will it be

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Honestly do you think conventions

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Would let us get away with that

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And I'll have a little wig

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
So my hair is the same

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
But like

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I feel like no one can stop

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
You're like

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Oh what you gonna do

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
A reefling lies down on the floor

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
And I quickly butt bash him

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
And then get back up again

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Like is that kickable to get out of the corner

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I feel like that's like such a baby thing

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Like oops

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I tripped and landed on my reeflings face

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Oh no

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Nah that'd be amazing

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Depends I guess

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Because it'd be really weird

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Messaging the convention and being like

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Hey

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Am I allowed to

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Fall on the faces

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Of reeflings

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Question mark

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Am I allowed

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Well if they allowed stepping

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Because then you can start to argue

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Like oh but you allow other

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
VTubers to step on them

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Did you know that is also

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Bexley bestifying

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
So why is it

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
When I trip and fall on a reeflings face

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
With my

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
My arms

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That's unacceptable

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
But if I step on them

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
That's acceptable

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Oh my god convention

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Talk about having double sided

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Is it because I'm Scottish

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Convention

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
You can't do that

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
You can't show that you

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Believe in the British Isles

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Sorry the

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
You need Kingdom over Scotland

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Oh my god convention

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
You don't believe in the independence of

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Scotland

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Convention

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You can't say that stuff at

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Low

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah anyway

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah albalfobia

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh my god exactly

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Sends like asking for trouble

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Well good thing my name's

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Johnny because we're making it double

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
That's right me I was

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
The name

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Sorry I was kidding

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Going on a

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Team rockets

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Blasting off again

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Oh wait that's not what they sound like

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
That sounded like cream

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Please be careful not to fall

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
What

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
What's

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
As

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Team rockets blasting off again

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
It's kinda there it's kinda there

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah yeah

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Convention what do you mean

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So there's a possibility

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
In a certain timeline that

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
I may or may not

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Be able to make it to our convention

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
I would love to do that

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
But the only problem is

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
We have a bomb

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And I'd actually need to hire

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
A bodyguard

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Two bodyguards or one bodyguard

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Bro I'm gonna be so embarrassed

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Messaging security is like

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
A private security comment being like

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Hey I basically need

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Two security persons

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
To follow me around a convention

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Is that fine

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Like for bodyguard

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Well I feel like the reeflings would bodyguard me pretty much

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
So like any shitters would like

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
You know get eaten up

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I thought this

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Thumbnail said backshot

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Bro you've been on the patreon a lot too much

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Okay that bodyguard

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
All me three four

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Four is quite a lot

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
It's because you're Scottish

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Nearly

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Nearly even

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
United with the UK

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I've spotted no I can't read that

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Five might be a good number

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Five little reeflings

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah paychecks a paycheck

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Literally

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
The bodyguards just watching me

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Like sit on everyone's face

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Being like what have I been hired for

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I thought it was a convention

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
For like weebs or something

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Like not understanding this like for retubers

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
We'd probably get weirder requests

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Eh plausible

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
True blood reeflings would be natural bodyguards

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
I think you'd have to hire professional security

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah no that's not the planet

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
A sniper too

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Steady I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Okay and what is this

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
France when Star Wars got released

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Did you know

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
That in France when Star Wars got released

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Was the last public beheading

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
What if they are also reeflings

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
The bodyguards

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I don't think bodyguards with a full time job

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Have enough time to

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Listen to me Japanese

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
About anything and everything that comes to my head

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
What yeah it's true

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
The year that Star Wars came out

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Which is

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
19

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
7

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
What

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Year did first Star Wars

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
1977

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Was the last year there was a public

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Execution in France

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
And also just happens to be the year

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
That Star Wars first came out

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
The evening

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I've been at home

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I have a full time job

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I can hear you yapping and so why not

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
How though

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Aren't you getting distracted at work

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Can I give you a bone bone at work

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
When we do the ASMR stream please

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
The thought I have that kind of power

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It's too much power

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Unlimited power

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Speaking of Star Wars

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Unlimited power

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I was freaked me out that scene

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
You have done that to me at work

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It's like one of my favourite friggin concepts

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Oh my god should I write a joystick

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
About doing it at work

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
And being subtle

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
No I don't want you to get fired

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I don't want to encourage such behaviours

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
That you didn't get fired

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
As much as you may despise

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Work as a whole

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It's good for routine for the brain

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It's good for socialisation

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It's good for keeping you active

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And the neurons firing

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Maybe capitalism won a little bit there

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
But maybe reduce it to a 4 day work week

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
4 day work week and not putting up to 10 hours

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Cause that's outrageous

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And then

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
For those who choose to not

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Cause that's not common

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
In all countries

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Anyway before the tinfoil

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Hat goes back on

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It's been 44 minutes already

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Guys why didn't you tell me to start the game

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Are you squidding me right now

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Sheepy goes live

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And tea mountains

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And hour and five

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Showing her thighs and feet

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I have taken so long and been so distracted

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Right let's turn on this desktop audio

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
So you guys can hear what I hear

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And let me turn off my background theme

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
This is what I hear in buckshot

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay we're just going to jump into it

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Hopefully that's not too loud

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Testing

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
No that's too loud

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Let's get my schedule off stream

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Schedules we're very thankful

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
It's been 45 minutes, start the game

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Oh now you tell me

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I might have to put brightness up

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I noticed that in my Crash Bandicoot stream

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
The brightness was so not bright

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But on my screens it was bright

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Hold on hydration

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
V-B-N-Y

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
V-N-N-Four

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Hold the scape tag

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Oh

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Oh my god we're Germans

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Germans like to rave

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Abandoned buildings for some reason

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Can I get a light mate

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
You got any hint on ya

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You got wee baggie on ya

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
No right we'll just keep going then

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Please sign the waiver

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Please sign the waiver

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
What's my name

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Oh my god my name is

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
That's me

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That's you

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Dealer

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
One live round

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Two blanks

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I insert the shells

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
In an unknown order

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh my god this back

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Like the faded background music

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Shotgun

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Shooting yourself with a blank

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Skips the dealer's turn

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
If there's two blanks

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I shoot myself

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I shoot myself

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Okay, okay, okay

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Statistically we're now at 50-50

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
We're at 50-50

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I'd rather give it to him

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Shooting yourself

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
No I want to shoot him

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I shoot the dealer

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
50-50

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm sorry mate

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Oh no

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
He's gonna sh

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
A defibrillator

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Careful now

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Defit a live

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Three rounds

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Two blanks

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Odds are what

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
They entered the chamber

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
In a hidden sequence

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Free live

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I want to shoot

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Sorry, three live, two blank

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Okay, now it's 50-50

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Two live, two blank

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay, okay, that's good

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
That's good because now it's two live

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
One blank, okay

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I am shit at this game

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
You're lucky I left you with a charge

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Get up and on

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
The night is young wait, do you want this?

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Okay

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Do I need to turn the brightness up

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
On stream?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Bruh

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
The game

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Is it bright enough for you guys?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Sorry, I'm gonna read chat

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
No it's good, it's good, okay thank you

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I don't know why but Crash Bandicoot was so dark

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Wait, is he the one that read me then?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Welcome back

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Hi

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I thought this game took like 20 minutes to

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
One live round

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Two blanks, okay

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
The odds are in my favor for a blank

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
So I'm gonna

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Okay, okay, safe

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And then again the 50

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Surely I wouldn't lose the 50-50

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
The second time around

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Are you serious?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
What the heck, I thought this was an easy game

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Careful now

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Oh, goodness me

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Right, three lives, two blanks

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I used up all my luck

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
On my daughters, that's what's happened

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Right, three lives, shoot the dealer

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Okay, the game is feeling kind

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Because there's now two live and one blank

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
The game is trying to let me win now

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm just gonna keep shooting

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Okay, okay, we did it

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
We did it, we did it

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
See, I do not gamble

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I have absolutely no interest in gambling

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And on the way to one replay

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
You did it

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Let's go

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Let's make this a little more

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Interesting

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I'm sitting on my toes

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Two items each

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
More items before

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Every load, every load

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This is my kind of game

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Oh, sheebie

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
You didn't tell me you were a part of this game

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Sheebie

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You do not

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Sheebie

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Four

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
One live, one blank

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Yes

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
So what do you do?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Dealer

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
Skips the next turn

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Does that mean if I sheebie him up?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
So I can just shoot both into him

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And win

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Yeah

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
And then I get to shoot again

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm getting it, I'm getting it

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
So we win

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Take that

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Okay

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Now what?

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Oh, I get more items every round

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Okay, you should come round

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Oh, beer

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Meh

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
What was that? No, no, no, come back out

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
What was that? It said God

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
A magnifying glass

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
What was that? It said God

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Two

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Oh, it's a 50-50 again

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
50-50 again

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
What does beer do?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Racks the shotgun

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
EJX

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Current shell

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Racks the shotgun

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Check the current round in the chamber

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Whoa

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It's a blank

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So I'll shoot me

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Rack equals pump

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I'll pump you in a minute

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Don't you worry

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I don't know if that means the same

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But in Scots that means I'm gonna do

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Okay

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Well, I did a blank

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
So two to one

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Okay

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Okay

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Oh, per dealer is going down

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
But I don't wish him any ill

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Well, he just looks creepy

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
But I don't... He's taking a cigarette

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
You know, a cigarette

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
What? Cigarettes are bad for your health

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Oh

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
To health

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Bro

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
He heals up and does double damage to me

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You wet fart

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Release me

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Oh, I've lost this

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I don't know what kinda

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I don't know what kinda stuff

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
be going on

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Sure, I'll take that and that

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
What?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Two blanks, three live

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Oh, I'm not winning this one

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Oh

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This is such a creative game

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I'll give it though, I like this

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It's live

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
That's so satisfying

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I like how it's not too loud

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I need to lower in-game volume

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Or it's all good to go

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Again

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Okay

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's fine, all good

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Should've cuffed him first

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Can I do multiple items per round?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Wow, I got two blanks

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
The game's feeling nice to me

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Right, I think I can just shoot him

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Cause there's only one left and it's live

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Yeah, take that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
You wet fart

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Okay, we're back on an even playing field

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Okay, what items, what items

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
What a curious game

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
God, okay

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
All I'm getting is handcuffs and beer

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
50-50

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Right

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Right, I'll handcuff him

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Please take these handcuffs

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Oh, it's a harem

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Right, eject the current shell

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It's 50-50, this will change the odds

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Out of 50-50

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Shit!

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Wait, okay, so it's live now

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
The odds are more likely it's a live round

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Oh, we're doing it

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
We have probability

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Okay, now it's likely

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
to be blank because

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
the odds are now one live to

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
two blank or three blank

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Oh, I don't like this part

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Okay, okay

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Right, and now it's again

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
back to being live

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Unless

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Put the gun down

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It's not gonna change my mind

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Live

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
No!

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I'm not gonna make every blank

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Aw, he knows what's inside

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Very interesting

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Yeah, I'm not surprised

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
It's a 1v1, careful now

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Oh no

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I don't know what

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I don't even

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I genuinely do not know what's

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
in this

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
There's no point in racking the shell

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Is there?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Cuff him, everyone says cuff him

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Right, I'll listen to the replays

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Cause you guys are smart

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Right, I've cuffed him

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And then I'm gonna

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Okay

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Oh, I just ended the round

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Yes, I'll absolutely take that

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Oh, and a ciggy

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Giazawi

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Whoa, the odds are very high

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
for a live round

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Sorry, look

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
I'm not the smartest, right

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff pass

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Yes, nicotine

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
No, it's not good

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I actually did it

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
A blank, right

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Okay, okay

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Me

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Okay, that's good to go

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Okay, so now it's like

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
5 to 1

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
We're just gonna shoot

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
What a curious game

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I'm very intrigued by this

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I'm intrigued by the dev team

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I'm intrigued by the graph

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
One reflying, and on one

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Yeah

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Long last, we arrive at the final showdown

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
No more defibrillators

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
No more blood transfusions

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Now me and you

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
We are dancing on the edge of life and death

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Eh

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Eh

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Four items each

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Handcuff

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Handcuff

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Magnifying glass

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Handcuff

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I'm starting to forget about my feet going on

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Eh

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
You know the drill

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Is he gonna handcuff me?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
If I handcuff him

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I can double

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I can double shoot

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And the odds are he's gonna get shot

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Okay, there you go

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Okay, we're doing it

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Uh

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Doesn't tell you what his health actually is

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
But he's

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
So we can just double

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Oh no, they're both blank, aren't they?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Ah, yeah

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Wait, no

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Oh no

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I messed up, hold on

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I'm so dumb

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Yeah, okay, right

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
And then fresh start and two new items

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
What we get, what we get

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Show me the money

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
We got beer

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
More handcuffs

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Oh, a beer

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
More handcuffs

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Four live, four blank

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
50-50

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Handcuff

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That gives me two in a row

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Uh

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Eject one to make seven on the board

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Odds our lives

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Blank

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Two blank remaining

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Four live

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Odds our shoot, shoot, shoot

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
One blank

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Four live

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Wah

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Can't give him that

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Can eject again

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Wait, no, wait

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
What did I just do? Sorry

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Three live, three live

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
One blank, shoot

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Cuff him

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Oh, could I cuff there? No, he's still cuffed

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Okay, now he's uncuffed

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
He's gonna eject

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Two live

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
One blank

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Handcuffed though

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Health revivals

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Oh, no

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Ah

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Eject alive

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Two live remaining

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Son of double for two health

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
No

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Three health total taken

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Two live

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Ah

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
This game is good

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
This game is good

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Oh, I like this game

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Hold on

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Okay, we got a health, we got a peak

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
We got two peaks, a health and a cuff

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Three live, two blank

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Okay

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
We're gonna cuff

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
We're gonna heal

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
We're gonna heal

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Because we do need a cheeky bit of health

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Because it is

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Three live, two blank

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Did we take a peak

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Or did we

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Wait, no, just taking a peak matter

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
If he's cuffed

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Well, because yeah

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It doesn't matter

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
No, it doesn't

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
That's what

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Two blank

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Oh, dear

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Oh, dear

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Right, doesn't matter if he's cuffed

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You can just double shoot, doesn't matter what the results are

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Right, what I've already forgotten

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
What we're at, is it one live, two blank

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Or two live, one blank

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Heals, he's got two heals on the board

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And he's got double son off

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Now it's two live, one blank

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Sugar, did you

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah, he's gonna shoot me

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
No, for two health

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
He's gonna shoot me for the son off

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Oh, this is

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
My odds

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Wow

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Gosh

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Wow, hopefully I can get some

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Cigarettes

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Right, cuff

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Wait, why cuff?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
It's two blank now

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It's two blank now

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
That's why I shouldn't have cuffed

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Remaining ammo, zero

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
They're both blank

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm not right, I need to focus up

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I need a piece of paper or something

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It was a 1v1

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Right, items, cuffs

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Peak, peak

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Oh, we've got a double son off

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
If we peak, we could get a double

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Four to two

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Four

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
To two

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Cuff him

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Let me know what's going on under the hood

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Let me double up

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
The damage under the hood

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Beautiful

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
This is acquire two HP damage

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh, that was satisfying

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So now we are three live

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Two blank

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Now it is a two in three

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Oh, dear

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Cuff

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Oh, he just released the blank

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Oh, no, this can't be

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
This can't be

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Oh, dear, I am

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
On life support, I believe there's

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Unless that's it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I don't know

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Okay

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Well, I'm handcuffed, he's won

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I've lost the odds game

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Oh, no

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Strummer bad

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm handcuffed

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Are you ready?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yeah

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Well, I can

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Hopefully there's a heal

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Double damage

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Double damage

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Double damage

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh, what are these

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Live, live, live, live

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Five, live, three

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Goodness me

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Heals don't work anymore

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Oh, you can't even heal anymore

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Oh, that's why the game is giving me critical damage

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Let's see what I'm working with

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Blank

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Well

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Five to three

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So now it's five to two

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And then

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
We'll just check again

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Okay, live

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And then we'll do double damage

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Unfortunately, the odds are not in our favor

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
But, hey-ho

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So that's four to

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Two

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We're not gonna make it

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Unless he throws

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We ain't gonna make it

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Oh wait, what?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Wait

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Are you saying there's a chance?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
If it's in the chamber, are you saying

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There's a chance?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Against all odds?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
What?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
What?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
What did I do with it?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh my gosh

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Oh my gosh

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
From the brink

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh my goodness

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Congratulations

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And on shots fired

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
24 shells ejected

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
54 doors kicked

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
4 cigarettes smoked

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
2 millilitres of beer drank

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Total cash

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
23

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Where's any button to exit?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Wow

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Double or nothing unlocked

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Wow

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Are these the developers?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The symbol?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
By computer game

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
by Mike Kaluub

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Nika

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The visuals

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The direction

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Did we go again?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Did we go again? Double or nothing?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
How did I do double or nothing?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Is it just start?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Just start

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Start then click the pill bottle

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Wow

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Oh it's changed

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's changed

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Because of our progress

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'll click the pill bottle

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Consume pills may impair your ability to drive

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But reflings I don't want you to go

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Consume the double or nothing

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Oh no the guy's gone

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Bye strongy

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
What an amazing game

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Please sign the waiver

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yes

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Let's do it

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I am blown away by this game

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Sorry

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I know how to spell your name

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Sorry I didn't mean to misspell it

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It was a genuine mistake

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Double damage

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Handcuff

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Mobile phone

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
What are you?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
One live to blank

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
A mysterious voice gives you

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
insight from the future

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Swap the polarity

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I think we'll just cuff

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and double shoot

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
If both of the blanks happen

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
to be in there

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Wow I have rubbish luck

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
That's fine

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Now it's a 50-50

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
If I shoot a blank at him

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm going to be

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Should I go all?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Not looking

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Okay rough start

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Double or nothing

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It was a double start

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Okay

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Two health already

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We've just gotten started on this

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
He's got health up

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Hydration check

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Okay we can pump one out of the chamber

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
We can heal and we can swap

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Another polarity

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Wow

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Interesting curious

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Again with a blank

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I am going to

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Puff one out of the chamber

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
To see what the odds are

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Okay now it's 50-50

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So I'm going to heal up because we already know what it's going to happen

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And then

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
We're going to saw

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
it off

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And we're going all in on double damage

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
against him

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Dealer

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Use the phone

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Right I'll use the phone

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Sorry it's the phone about the current round

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
or the next round

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Oh my god he's doing

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Double damage against me

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That's so bad

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Right I'll do the phone my apologies

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I thought the phone was like for the next round

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Careful now

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Careful re-flowing

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Re-flowing

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Wouldn't want to be dancing to death

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Let's see you

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
What is you

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Okay

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Ring ring hello

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Three lie four blank

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The game is trying its best to help me right now

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
A mysterious voice

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
How smart

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Do you think I am

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Reflings to be able to

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
retain the information

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That on the sixth shell

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It's blank

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
How smart do you think I am

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
What is this a pipe bomb

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Steal an item

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And use it

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Well

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh no

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Oh that's exactly what happened

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
They put adrenaline directly

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
into your bloodstream

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
What was that medicine box

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I wonder what this is

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I don't have it yet

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
There's nothing I can do

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Other than cuff them

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and double shoot

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
What

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That also means the fetus isn't going to be blank

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I just need to send it

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Sorry I can't

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
No okay

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So it means like these next few are live

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Gotta go straight to cuff and meet

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Okay

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Okay I've definitely messed up this one

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
What is that

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
A medicine packet

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
He takes a pill

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Oh I healed

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Okay that's fine, cigarette or pills heal

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I know

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I've lost

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I've lost

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh no

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Who is he calling literally

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Aw that's such a shame

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Wait

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
He put the polarizing effect on

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Oh no I'm gone

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Sorry

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Right I didn't know how the phone worked

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Not that it probably would have helped

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Oh by the way the fifth one's a blank

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Oh thanks for that mate

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Let me just add it into my fucking calculator

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And have the largest IQ

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And my brain goes three-sided

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
You know the average person who can only retain

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Like freaking what

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Four bits of information at a time

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Like come on give me a chance game

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Let me write it down, give me a wee piece of paper

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And I'll write it down just like this

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
He kicked the hell out of this cuttlefish

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Literally I'm calamari right now

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
By all accounts right

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Let's try that again

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Pump one out of the chamber

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Adrenaline burst, health and double damage

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Okay

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Okay we can work with this

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Four before

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Two live, three blank

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
What do I do with that information

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I don't know

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
If three blank should I shoot myself

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Or should I make the odds known

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
If it's 50-50

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Three blank, two

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
50-50 double damage

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Let's go

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
50-50 double damage

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Two blanks in a row

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Possibly

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Oh yes

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Okay, okay, okay

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Okay

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
He's gonna pump it out

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Now it's back to 50-50

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Yep and then one health damage on me

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And let me win

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
But that's slightly different

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Okay, okay, that's good

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Let him get up, let him get up

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Good shot

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Are you squinting me right now

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Cooper

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Brian, Blasterman

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Thank you for the five

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Cooper and yes I will Blasterman

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Okay two blank one live

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I have nothing

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
What's that

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Medicine, steal his medicine

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I think I'm gonna steal his health

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Prevent him from healing up

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Give me that

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Give me that

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
What does it do?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Why did my head just

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Two blank one live

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Two blank one live

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Okay

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Medicine is 50% chance one damage

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And two heal

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Oh wait is that

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Okay we are classic 50-50

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
If we get this

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
We have won the first round of doubler nothing

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Dealer

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Oh that was a clean round

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
That was a clean round of odds

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Very clean

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And on wins, okay

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I'm taking medicine again

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Because I didn't realise I could hurt myself with it

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Okay

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Oh great

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Fucking tiddlywink spawn

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
No I'm not taking that

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Okay what are the rounds

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Let me know

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Full eight

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
50-50 full eight

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Okay

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Remove one from the chamber

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Let me know my odds

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
4-4

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
3-4

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
3-3

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
6 total

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
4th shell live

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Ray

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Can I just take his fucking heal then

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
6

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
4 is life

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
6 total 4 is life

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
6 total 4 is life

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So I have to

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's most likely a blank

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
You know that

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
If 4 is live in that sequence

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
There are most likely 2 blanks before it

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Wait

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Am I an idiot

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Did I not take a heal

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Did I not take a cigarette

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Am I being dumb

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Did I not

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
2

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Is your max

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You can't over heal

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Oh

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Fuck

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Fuck

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Fuck

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Fucking just shoot him

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
This is not gonna work well

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
No

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
No

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
No

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Why is he doing polarizing

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Meh I suck at this game

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Let me go again

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
We've got time for another

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Why is this game

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Ah fuck he's suck at this shite

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
The only thing I'm good for sucking is willy

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Not this game

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Get me in that room

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Right you

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000

Please sign the waiver I consent

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Your gacha luck is not great

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I've actually never played a gacha game

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Call in a friend

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Polarizing in the seat

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Right I'm glad we can get a peek

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Right let's try this again

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It's okay

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
It's okay

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I'm gonna take a peek

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
What have we got

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Alive

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I am gonna steal

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
His sawn off and give him 2 damage

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Now I'm aware he has a heal there

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
No I'm not

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I'm gonna steal his heal

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Fuck off

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Your cigarettes are mine

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Awww you can't over heal

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The reeflings just told you

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That mere moments ago that you can't over heal

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
In this game mode and what do you do

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Reade it over heal

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
You could have had him down to 2

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
You could have had him on the ropes

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
But no no

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Okay 50-50 odds

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
He's getting insider knowledge

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Did you know

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Celebrities calling the paparazzi

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
To tell them ahead of time

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Where they're gonna

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Right

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
3 lives

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
2

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Blank

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And he's gonna hurt me

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Real good

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
3 lives 2 blank

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
3 lives

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
2 blank 3 lives

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
2 blank we won blank 3 lives

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Boom

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That's right take that you stinky stinker

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
No 2 lives

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
1 blank

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Yeah I'm not surprised

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm not surprised

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
That's okay

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Let him get up

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So now there is no blank

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
How can that not count

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Awww

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
That was even again

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Okay it's fine we're back

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Right now

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
There's no blank yeah there's nothing now

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Okay let's try that again

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Not gonna take that

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Might use that

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Double or nothing double or nothing

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Double that dammit

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Okay 50-50

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
It's 50-50

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
The only thing I can do is call in a pow

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I don't

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
It's 50-50

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Let's give him the damage

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Let's go let's brain hell

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
When I said brain hell

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I didn't mean like wind

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Literally all he

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
He felt was a little

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Wait

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Awww

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Man

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Alright so that's blank

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Very

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Interesting

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
What are you stealing

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Give it back

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Oh you can have that

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Please hurt yourself with it

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I'm gonna make it

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I'm so bad at this game

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Careful now

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I'm trying to be careful but I suck

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Okay

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
If I eject this one

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I'm removing this one

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
The next one is blank

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So I'm just gonna

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Play it safe and do that

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
He is using developer luck

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Remaining ammo

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Oh my god you guys try to help me so much

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I'm so bad I'm so sorry

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Right we can now double

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Double saw it off at least

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Why did I get two turns in a room there

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Wow

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Well it's now even Steven

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
No it's not cause he has two health and not one

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Cause I'm dumb

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
What is he doing

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Polarizing

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Okay

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Hiya

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Dude

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
So bad

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Oh my goodness this is so hard

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Yes please

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Let me try again

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Let me get up

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I'm afraid

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I'm very afraid

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
The force was a blank

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Yeah that's why I shot myself with it

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Sorry this must be painful

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I'm so sorry

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I'm not very smart

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart by playing connect 4 with me

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
In old school runescape

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Anon

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
You know what

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Yeah that's right

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Call me big willy

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Cause I got a big massive willy

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
One

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Right

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Let's try hard

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
It's time to try

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Not two irons or he only got two as well

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Big willy

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
It's a 50-50

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Let's try again

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
If it's a 50-50

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I could just win by doing this

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But he can do the save to shoot me

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
But he can still

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
He can still hurt me

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Cause the first one wasn't

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Wait what

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Oh if you shoot yourself you get to play a second turn

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's finally starting to make a little bit of sense

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Health?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
But I can't overheal so don't get jealous

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Whoa

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Why so many irons

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Oh he got loads of irons too

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Two life three blank

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Three

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Three blank

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
No it's 50-50

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
No

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
It's

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Oh god

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I can't use my brain and talk at the same time

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Just let me see what it is

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Please

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Okay

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
So if I shoot myself

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I get to go again

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And then I get to double shotgun

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Barrel you

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Am I doing it?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I think I'm doing it

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Why is my luck so poor

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
There's all life now

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
What does polarize do?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
You could have inverted

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And then sawn for the win

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Wait that works backwards as well

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
If I know it's blank

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Polarize it to change it

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
This must be the most painful place

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Or you've ever seen

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I even think we're going to be able to do it

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
In time for Shibi's monetization stream

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Okay

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I didn't realize polarizing

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Swapped

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
The

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Oh shit I did not pay attention

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
To how many live in

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
You know

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
If I know it's a blank use polarizing

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Got it

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
If I know it's a blank use polarizing

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Okay it's alive

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It's alive

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So I am going to

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Steal your double damage

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Steal his saw

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Steal his double damage

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Polarize

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Polarize

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You've already finished the game

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
This is infinite mode

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Wait it's the same

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Right he's on one health

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
He's gonna

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Sawn a friend which is fine

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
He's gonna

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
He's gonna cuff me

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Zadim

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Oh yeah you want to

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Cuff me up

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Right he's healed which is fine

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We're no one even Steven

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
What was that

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Adrenaline he's healing again

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Oh you could

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Yes

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Hello

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Why would you do that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Question mark

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Did you mean to do that

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Okay please

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Take a xp

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I hear a health down health down

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Aha

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Oh yeah

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Oh no he's done polarizing

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Oh no

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Oh no

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Ow

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Oh no

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I don't know what it is

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I don't know what's left

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Oh I do know what's left

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So if I blank myself

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Oh polarize

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Polarize you stupid women

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
You

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Polarize

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Polarize

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Polarize the blank

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Oh my god I was so

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I freaking clicked it and my brain was like

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Wait a minute you were supposed to do something

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Freaking polarize

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Okay give me give me give me give me

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Give me give me yeah give me yeah give me

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah blank

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Right 50-50

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Okay

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
50-50

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Inspect element

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Inspect element blank

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Blank found

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Polarize effect added

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Polarizing

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And then what

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Shoot myself or shoot him with polarize on

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Shoot him with polarize on

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Man she sure is pretty

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah that's all I got going for me

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
This feature of model is adorable

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Okay shoot him

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
We did it

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I was so sorry

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Shoot um right we did it

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Willy wins

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Big Willy wins

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Imagine if this is the run I went on

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And it's the one I call myself Willy on

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Right

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Okay let's see what we're working with baby

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Rejection

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Calling

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Focus right

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Uh

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
For help on big Willy 50-50 odds

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Okay

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
He can see he can cuff and he can double damage

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Maybe the phone

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Can tell me if what's first

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
If not I'll just use the magnifying glass

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
That's absolutely nothing

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Can you not pick like the second bullet

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So I'll actually remember

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Right I don't have polarizing

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So I can shoot myself for free

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
That's one

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
So odds are

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I can just shoot him

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Nooo

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Are you fucking kidding me

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
High odds of being

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Live literally the seventh shell is blind

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So and

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And two bullets have been utilized

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
This is the third bullet

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Being utilized

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Right

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So the odds of this one being live

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Are high again

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Oh no

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Okay

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Is that four shots now

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So then five and six are live

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Five is live

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
What

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
What

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Does this game want from me

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
What does this game want from me

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
My odds

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I know you can't rely on odds

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
That's just how odds work

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
My odds are

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Astronomically

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Right Willy's definitely

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
We can't even do it as Willy

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
We have to go back to our roots

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Cause this clearly isn't working

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It wants you to suffer

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
My poor Willy

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
My poor Willy got blown off

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Right

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I'm actually

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I'm like do I get a piece of paper

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Cause I might

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
These are good items

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
What are the odds

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Give me a 50-50

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
We've got a 50-50

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I can't overheal past two

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
If it's

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
50-50

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Let me see

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
What's

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Or eject

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I might be able to

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Eject 50-50

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And tell me what's up

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Right taking it out alive

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
So if we're gonna get a blank

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
We're gonna steal the polarizing

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
No it's live

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I really don't have a double

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Oh sugar but he has the polarizing

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Well next to a blank

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So if he uses polarizing

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Then he's won

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I think

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
No he can only do one damage to me this round

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Okay okay

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Steal the car

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I don't think

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
That would have

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Bro

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Bro it's not looking good

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Why is this game so hard

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I just need you guys to like

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Send me your gaming footage

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So I just commentate over it

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Cause this is getting so bad

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Careful now

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
All I've been told this game is careful now

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Careful now

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Careful now

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Yeah yeah yeah

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
They're both blank we know

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
We know they're blank

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Well at least I

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Have a cigarette

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Right

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Two live three blank

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
But he doesn't have a polarizing

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So blank actually means

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Blank in this game

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I'm gonna steal his

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Cigarette

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
No

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Can I get a vase

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Three blank two live

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Can I get a vase

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So the three blank are up ahead

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
So odds are

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
This is blank

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Can I steal his health

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I don't want him to heal

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yeah this is blank

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
It's my guess

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Oh for fuck's sake I keep being greedy

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Right this is blank sorry

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I'm guessing but

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah okay odds are

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Right I'm happy with that

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I'm happy with that

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Right we're gonna take a peek

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Blank again wow

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Blank again

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And then the rest are live

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
In a room

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Well unfortunately he's gonna get a lick in on me

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
How do I suck so badly

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I'm not being funny I'm getting

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Absolutely rolled

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I'm getting

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Just

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
They're making a mockery out of me

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
They're making an absolute mockery out of me

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Does this guy even have a name

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Okay phone a friend

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Adrenaline

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Right it's a 50-50

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You need to start comboing the items

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Oh I'm too dumb for that though

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
That's actually

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
An injection into

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
That

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Adrenaline into your heart

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Which basically forces it to go

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Blank

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I'm just shooting

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
So anyway I start blasting

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Cause I'm unable to keep up with them

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Right there we go boom

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Oh wait I actually won out of just pure frustration

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
We won that round

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Anyway start blasting

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
We did it we made it to round 2

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Of double or nothing

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I've still yet to make it to round 3

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Okay let's see what we get

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Cough, double

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Damage, adrenaline

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Not medicine

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Medicine that's not really medicine

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Too blind

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Does he have a polarizer he does

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Phone and a friend

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Wow okay

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Steel

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Polarizer

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Shoot him

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Steel polarizer

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Shoot him

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Yes

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Steel polarizer

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Shoot him

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Steel and then shoot

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Okay

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Then he'll shoot blank on me

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Cause we know it doesn't have anything in it

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And then double sawing off

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Oh he's healing

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Okay

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
So let him shoot

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
That's just fine cause it's blank

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Oh

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Forgot he can get an extra turn

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
If he shoots himself

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I keep

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I keep forgetting the mechanics

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Of this dumb game

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Why is it he is allowed to heal

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And he's allowed to do this

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And he's allowed to do that

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Don't you know the video game rules

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Only I'm supposed to be able to do

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
All the things that help me win the game

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I never thought that far ahead

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I never thought in the first place

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
That should be my sentence I don't think

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Right what was that 50-50

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Right at least we can heal first

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Watch your enemies

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Hand closed

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Hordeshell

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Live round that gives me nothing

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Thank you don't ever speak to me again

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
What's in the chamber

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Blank

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I don't have a polarizer

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So I can officially shoot myself

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Bunk

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Right and then

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And then what

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I mean that means all Tsar

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
It's a double

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Cuff him

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Okay and then what

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And then

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
The best I can do is just guess

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I'll say it from this one

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
So is this the third

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Wow

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
This is why I don't gamble

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I have no interest in gambling

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Because it's a Gamba game

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Or something like that

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I actually don't know if Genshin Impact

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Is a Gamba game but

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Yeah

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Remaining ammo

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
The fact you're trying to help me

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And it doesn't help because I'm so dumb

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
It doesn't help

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I'm too dumb to be helped

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
You guys are just going to have to send in

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Your gameplay and I'll commentate over

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And pretend that I'm playing

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
That seems like a plan

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Surely

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I'm not, I'm losing it

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
New round

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Let's see what we've got

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Let's see what we're working with

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Two lives, three blanks

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Okay, okay, okay

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Oh yeah

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
A burner

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Just show me if it's good or bad

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's good

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I don't have a polariser though

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Clink

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And there's four in the chamber left

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
So let's talk to the phone

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Because the bass ain't listening

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Okay

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
That means the odds have increased

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
That this is a live round

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So we're going to say

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Funk it

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And we start

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Blasting

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Okay, we know next is blank

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
But he doesn't

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
He doesn't have a polariser

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Either

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Hold on

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Oh

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Good or bad

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
We know this is blank

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
But we know that this is live

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And now he knows it's live

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And he's got a double

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It's ogre

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It's ogre

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
And he's cuffing me

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Bro

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Wait what

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Now it's live

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Oh my goodness

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Golly

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
If you are like me in small brain

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
This game ain't for you

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I've got one more in the tank

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Because she's actually getting ready to go live

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
We've got one more

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Come on

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
That's it, you know what

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I'm getting a piece of paper out for this

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I'm writing down

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
This freaking piece of paper

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Writing on in this game

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I'm going to call in

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
This freaking

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I'm going to call in the big guns

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Which is me writing on a piece of paper

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
To write down the odds

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
To write down what there is

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
To write down what to do

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
If we do not win this one

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
This settles it

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
That you guys are just far too smart for me

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And you have picked the most

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Our worded oh she

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
There possibly could be

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Right

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Pull out items

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Magnifying glass

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Health

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
No don't want meds

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I'm not taking my meds you can't convince me

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Right

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
What's in the chamber

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Two live

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Three blank

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
And then I'm going to do it

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Like hangman on my piece of paper

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So the odds are already

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Not

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
The best

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I am going

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
To

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Seal his phone

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I'm going to steal his phone

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
No

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Yes

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Yes I'm going to steal his phone

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
To get the intel

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Fifth shelf blank

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Okay so for hangman

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
There's now a B on the fifth

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
One

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
For blank

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
We are going to see what's inside

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Because either way we're doing damage to this round

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It's a blank so we're going to apply the polarizing effect

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
We're going to put B on the first

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Hangman section as well

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
So we're polarizing to make it hurt

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
The dealer

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Is being shot with the polarizing effect

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Resulting new damage dealt to the dealer

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Okay

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Okay

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
So first one's blank

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Last one's blank we now know this

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
That's perfectly fine

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And playing hangman

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I do not fully understand this game

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Neither am I that's why we're playing hangman

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
He is now inspecting

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
He claims

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
The contents are very interesting

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
He shoots me

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
With a live round

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
The second position is live

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
We are now on a 50-50

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
On the contents of the gun being live

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Or blank, we cannot ascertain

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
We can heal up

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But we cannot ascertain what is inside

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
This truly is a 50-50

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
He drank a beer

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
What did I miss it? Two and three were live

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
So we know it's a blank

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Wait

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
But none of us have a polarizer

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
So this round can be complete

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So we need to start a new freaking round

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
In hangman game

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Goodness gravy

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
All blanks

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Okay

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
A BBL

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Right

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Let's play hangman over again

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Let me, what is the ratio

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Three live four blank

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Three live

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Four blank

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Full of seven on hangman

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
One, two, three, four, five

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Seven, I have adrenaline

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
To call in

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
For information

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Which we're gonna do

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Right

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
You can yoink the yoink

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Right, position second shell

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Blank, hangman

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Second is B blank

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Oh sugar I just dropped my pencil

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
If we handcuff

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And we are going to act like

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
The first one is live

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Okay

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
We are going to treat it as live

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
We do not know and we cannot ascertain

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
If that information is true or not

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
However we can shoot ourselves for

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Okay that was a blank

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
We know the second is a blank

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So first two are filled out Bs

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That leaves two blank and three

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Live on the board

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
We are going to shoot ourselves to give ourselves another round

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Sadly

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
There are now

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Five pieces

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Remaining

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
And we cannot ascertain the knowledge

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
So we're going to treat it as alive

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
This truly is a 50-50

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
We're gonna treat it as alive cause the odds are it's alive

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
You know what I'm just gonna go fuck myself then

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
You know what

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Because that's the thing with odds

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
That is the thing with odds

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
That is the thing with odds

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Yeah

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yeah it could literally

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
You can flip a coin ten times in a row

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
And statistically never get heads

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Ten times in a row

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
But that's the thing with odds they are not reality

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Yeah yeah

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Yeah yeah

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Yeah yeah

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
That's right another

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Sorry I'm addicted

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I'm addicted I like this approach sorry

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
The hangman approach is quite fun

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I'm addicted I can't stop right

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
We've got ten minutes to speak on this

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Come on

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Ten minutes

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Oh my god come on

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Please sign the waiver I will

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Anything for you dealer let me do it again

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Again again again again

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Ah

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Okay

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Let's do it

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Let's do it

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Uh

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Right

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Let's go

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Who goes there

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Identify yourself

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Three live

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Four blank

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Three live

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Four blank

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Seven hangman

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Okay

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
We have adrenaline

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
We are going to get

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Intel from this adrenaline

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I assume we can only use adrenaline

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Once again right the intel is

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
The intel is

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Third shell live route

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Okay

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Can we do double adrenaline

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Hello

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Double adrenaline

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
That's cheating

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Blind shit

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Oh we have a polarizer

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Okay that's perfect

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
If we hand cuff

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Or does that leave

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
That's two live on the board we don't know

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
About three live on the board we don't know

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Tell you what we could do

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Hand cuff

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Polarize

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Shit

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Discard

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
The current unknown

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Because we don't know what it is

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
And I don't trust it

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
So we're just gonna discard it

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Okay we're just gonna discard it

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
It doesn't really matter

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Okay so we can write down blank in second

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
So now there's two blank and two live

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
The odds are straight back to 50-50 again

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
We are going to shoot

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Okay okay so now there's one blank

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Remaining and two live on the board

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
He's gonna eject a blank

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So all remaining are now live

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Shit

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And he's gonna do

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
He's gonna do three health damage in the sequence

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Wait

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Yeah no

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Sorry sorry sorry

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Then blank was the fifth there and then it's two live

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Remaining now

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Sorry my apologies

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Two live remaining

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Unfortunately he will get a lick

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
In on us but that's fine

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
That's fine

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Do you feel so big brain now

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
No I'm cheating by playing hangman and writing it down

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
That's how hard this game is for me to conceptualize it

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
In my head

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I cannot do this in an

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Abstract

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Concept

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I don't have the ability to do this

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I have to write everything down

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
We've got insight

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
We've got two insights

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Fantastic

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I'm not gonna do it for this round

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
He's got a polarizer

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
No he doesn't

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I might as well shoot then

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Shouldn't I

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
There's no point in using this stuff

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
It's a 50-50 I might as well just shoot

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
There's no point

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I've got two phones

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
One for the veiler

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
No use the phone

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
No get info

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
But wait wait wait hold on

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Hold on

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
What's the point in me using the phone

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Right now because it's 50-50

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
If it's a blank

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Oh wait

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Yeah idiot

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
If it's a blank then he can't get a lick in on me

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Sorry

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I'm so slow

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
It takes me a moment to remember

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
The way this game plays

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I'm so sorry

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
We are on to the second round

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Okay

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Okay okay okay big brain time

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Big brain time

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Winkles

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Becoming more wrinkly in your brain

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Your smooth piece of chicken breast

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Brain is no magnifying

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Three live three blank

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Three live three blank

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Hangman of six

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Okay

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Insider knowledge

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Yes please

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Third shell

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Blank

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Okay

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Yonkers

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I would like insider knowledge

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
From the adrenaline burst

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Okay

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
What are you gonna tell me

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Fourth shell

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Blank

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Okay

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Now that leaves one blank

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Unknown

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
The odds

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Is now one in four

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Of the current shell

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Chamber being a blank

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I think I want to shoot

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So anyway

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I start blasting

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
The odds of one in four

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Yeah okay that's what I like to see

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Live one in four

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
We are going

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Okay he's gonna heal up that's perfectly fine

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
He is gonna be able to see what's inside

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And he does have a polarizer

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
So I'm gonna have to be cautious of that

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
He's gonna check it out

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
What do you see

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Very interesting

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Okay

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Oh he's shooting it's alive

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Okay

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
So the next two we know are blank

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
So we can blank it up to high heavens

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Okay

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Blank

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Bonk

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And then blank again

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Thanks to our insider knowledge

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
And it worked

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And blank again

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Then we are going to drink the beer

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
To inject the second last bullet

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Because we will be able to

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
If this is blank

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Or if it's live so that was live

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
So that means the remaining one is blank

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
So we can just shoot ourselves

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Bonk okay all good

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
All good in the hood right new round

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
We do

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Insider

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
The game knows we are playing hangman

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
The game knows what we got

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Four live four blank

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Four live

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Four blank

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Hangman one two three

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Okay I don't have enough room on the paper

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
One two three four five six

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Seven eight sorry I need to re-write that

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Because I put it at really awkward bits

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Right

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Let me know what's the update

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Let us know what's going on here

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Third shell live

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Perfect

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Let me know what else is going down

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Obliet

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I didn't realise he could do that

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Yeah

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I didn't know he could do that

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Like thanks

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Right I'm going to

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Against my better judgement

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I'm still going to take this

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Because it's so much better and more valuable

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
To know what's coming up

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Fifth shell live

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Okay okay okay

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
We only don't know where two are

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
That leaves me to believe

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So the odds are now

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
What

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
One in three that this is blank

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
No that's not correct

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I want to shoot myself

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Against my better judgement

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I'm going to claim this as a blank

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Because statistically it should be

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Okay

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
We did it

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Okay we have a second round now

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
There are

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Three blank

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
What does this mean

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Cigarettes I can't heal up

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I don't think

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
In Minecraft

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
In Minecraft

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Unknown second live

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I don't know

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Shoot or not

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Your max is HP 4

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Let's have a wee quick

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
We'll start mull over this

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Thank you

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
My apologies

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I thought this was like you couldn't heal it

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
A 4 4 4

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Should we get a cigarette

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Smoker and gen 2

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Apparently that's a really big kink

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That I didn't know about

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
A wham and smokes a ciggy

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
No

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I don't know what it's going to be

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
You know what

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
If I shoot myself

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
It's actually going to not be that bad

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Okay we know this one is live

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
So we can shoot

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
A double shot

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I get so excited to like

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Utilize

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
We would have gone on to the next round

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Oh we would have gone on to the next round

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
If I wasn't so

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Freakin quick shorty

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Okay

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
He just ejected alive

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
So it's live live live actually

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Wait what

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Oh

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Thanks for letting me go to the other round

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Even though I messed up I appreciate you dealer

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
The game must know

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I'm like sweating so hard

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
We finally made it

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
To round 3

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Okay

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Okay

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Hangman ain't got nothing on us

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Okay

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Medicine

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Polarize

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
That's fine

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
2 live 2 blank

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
2 live

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
3 blank sorry

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Sorry number

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
We have no insider information

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
We have odds which is blank

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
The odds

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Stepulate this is a blank

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
So I shouldn't theory put the polarizing

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
On and shoot myself

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
We have to go with odds

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
We have no choice shoot the dealer with polarizer

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
On

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So that was a blank

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
So now it's 2 to 50 50

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Perfect and he can see what's inside

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Very interesting

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Live okay

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
The odds are now 1 live

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
2 blank

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Wow

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Wow

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Wow

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
If I take the medicine I expire

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Because my odds are not good enough

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
This is it

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I either win this game mode

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Or get it on whatever we pick

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Now the odds are

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
This is blank

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Swallow the medicine

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I'll swallow it

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Because you asked me to

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Refling

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Ah!

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Refling

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Ah!

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Forever tame because she be live with celebration

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
It was worth it though

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I died doing what I love the most

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Guzzling refling's ink

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I perished doing what I love the most

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Okay

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
So I don't feel that bad

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
That was so good

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
That was fantastic

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I can 100% see us revisit in this game

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
In a membership stream

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I don't like replaying games that I may have already done before

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
But thank you

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
So so much for that

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Fantastic experience on this game

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Another 10 out of 10 game

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Shout out to the developer

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
That is like such a fun little odds game

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So goofy

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Incredibly entertaining

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
And the graphics

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
As well as the design

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Visual design is absolutely

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Beautiful

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Some people might not enjoy

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
The poly

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Looking art

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Art style is the word I'm looking for

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
The art style

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Right

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
We are going to redirect

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Into none other

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Than she be cotton bum

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Membership monetization celebration

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Wherever the Frick Frick didle-a-dack

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Tic-tac-patty-whack-nick-nack

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I am going to make sure

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I am redirecting into her

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But that was fantastic

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
In that game with me

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
That was so good

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
We will definitely hangman this game at a later date

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Because

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Gosh golly gee

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
That was just amazing

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
We finally started

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
It started to click at the end

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I need to redirect into Sheepsters

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Cause that didn't work properly

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Thank god I checked that

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Right all good in the hood

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Yes thank you so so much

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000

Time and then 15 minutes later

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I will swap all my equipment

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Back over to my regular streaming equipment

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And we will have a membership

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Watch along of transformers

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
And don't be greedy

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
See that

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Don't be a naughty refling and see that

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Thank you so so much for hanging out

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
That was an absolutely amazing game

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
