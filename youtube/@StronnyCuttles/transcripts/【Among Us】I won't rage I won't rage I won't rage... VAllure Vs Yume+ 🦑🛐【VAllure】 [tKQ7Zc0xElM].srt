1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Oh my gosh.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,360
I think, I think we, what happened?

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,200
I want it.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
Can everyone hear my girls?

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,800
Scotland forever.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,280
Oh my gosh.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,440
Hi girls, Mina-san.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,280
Hi.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,760
Hi.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,440
Mina-san, ganky disco.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,240
Ganky disco.

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
Oh, we're starting already?

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh my God, that was so fast.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,960
That was so fast.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,280
Wait, what?

17
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,800
My body's not ready.

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,800
The lobby's going to close.

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,880
Are we all here?

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
We're here.

21
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Close.

22
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Close.

23
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
We should do introductions.

24
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,120
We should do introductions when we get in the room.

25
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,600
We can die.

26
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
We can die?

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,080
OK.

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,480
Let's die together.

29
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,720
I'm very anxious.

30
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Wow.

31
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,400
Oh my gosh, I'm imposter.

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
That's not how this game works.

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,680
Oh my God.

34
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,400
I just thought you guys would like to know.

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,200
Let's do our introductions around this round table.

36
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
OK, OK.

37
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Great, cool.

38
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,480
The round table.

40
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,160
I'm ready.

41
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,000
Each girl, her spotlight should come up here.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,520
OK, OK.

43
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
You may plus first.

44
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
OK, you may plus.

45
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
You may plus go.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
I said no.

47
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,440
The other first.

48
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,120
Hi, my name's the most sister, Saki.

49
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,240
And I like strawberries.

50
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,480
Nice to meet you all.

51
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,640
You have a cherry on your head.

52
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Yay.

53
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,880
Shut up, don't talk to me.

54
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Oh, oh.

55
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,880
You could do like that something.

56
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
I guess I'm next.

57
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah.

58
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,760
Hello, I'm Rhea Nevermore, and I am the goat girl

59
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,000

Yay.

62
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wow.

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You got that.

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wow.

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're the girl.

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wait, I can't hear them.

67
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Rain, go.

68
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You hear them now?

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, shoot, sorry.

70
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I had you guys off on my desktop.

71
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sorry, hold on.

72
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm so dumb.

73
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Damn.

74
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't hear them.

75
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We can smell it.

76
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, okay.

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hi me.

78
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi me.

79
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can hear myself.

80
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who's echoing?

81
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Turn off the damn echo.

82
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh my God.

83
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh my God, that's so bad.

84
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold on, don't laugh.

85
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

86
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

87
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like, go.

88
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Scuff scuff.

89
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Scuff scuff.

90
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Scuff scuff.

91
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Scuff scuff.

92
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Scuff scuff.

93
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh my God.

94
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The voices.

95
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Scuff scuff.

96
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Scuff scuff.

97
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Scuff scuff.

98
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Scuff scuff.

99
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're even actually just telling me.

100
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just get it, just get it, just get it.

101
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just get it, just get it.

102
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can you please fix it?

103
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Like that's just crazy.

104
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh wait, that was my laugh.

105
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can you still hear it?

106
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Or is it gone?

107
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can hear it, yeah.

108
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, it sounds fine, sorry.

109
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's good, you're fine.

110
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Girl, how loud do you have your head set?

111
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Me?

112
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, yes.

113
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sorry.

114
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wait, I fixed it, I fixed it, I fixed it.

115
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I did.

116
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh my God, I had it turned down.

117
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh my God.

118
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Welcome to the Via Lour and Yuma Plus Collab

119
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
where we are scuffed even through the beginning,

120
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
even though we met an hour before

121
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and set this all up.

122
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was more than an hour.

123
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's giving poopy.

124
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Speaking of poopy, let me go.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Alright poopy, take it away.

126
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Take it away, take it away.

127
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hi me, I am Yuma Plus Special Generation Remedy.

128
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000

Hi.

131
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why do I feel like I'm an alcohol synonymous?

132
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh.

133
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here we go again.

134
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm rain and I'm the problem.

135
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, okay.

136
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But like seriously, who are you?

Now for Via Lour.

139
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey, I'm Sterani, I'm Scottish.

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can't mix my voice up with anyone in this lobby

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and I will not tolerate otherwise, thank you.

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, Sterani.

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000

That was lit.

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

166
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, now that introductions are done.

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wait, is introductions done?

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, can we kill each other now?

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, get out.

170
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Bye.

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Screw you guys.

172
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm off to do the freaking alien thing.

173
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, I'm not.

174
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you upset?

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you hear?

176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh my god, she's good.

177
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I need to do

178
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the garbage shoot.

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hold on.

180
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you guys okay?

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You know, it's yourself, man.

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I need the garbage.

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you want to go do the

185
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Three, two, one,

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Who's dead?

188
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can you hear them now?

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was Amy.

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was Amy.

191
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh my gosh.

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Amy's at the garbage shoot.

193
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Amy's at the garbage shoot.

194
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I literally just saw her.

195
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I just came from communication.

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And Amy is

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
standing over the body of rain.

198
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Holy crap.

199
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Holy crap.

200
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, don't even fucking lie.

201
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry, but you're into...

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You didn't. Is that the best shot?

203
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sorry, if that's the best you've got.

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's the best you've got.

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I walked in on it.

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's literally

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Amy.

208
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's the Sonic Heroes.

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Fucking Shadow Roleplayer.

210
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, okay.

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The only guilty thing I have

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to admit is that I like Shadow,

213
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but I didn't. I didn't do this.

214
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I promise.

215
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Can Strony set you up?

216
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, absolutely.

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Set you up? Are you fucking having a laugh?

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Amy, are you joking?

219
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was literally at the gas canister

220
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
watching you as you got pulled over

221
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and then fucking sniped

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
rain in half.

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's like left behind.

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry, but that was a cure...

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Open up my stream.

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Open up my stream right now.

227
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not being gas-lipped

228
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
by a Sonic...

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
a freaking Shadow the Hedgehog streamer

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
right now.

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I am not being gas-lipped

232
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
by a Sonic the Hedgehog

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
stand.

234
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're getting done.

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will say that I did see

236
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Amy stand over the body.

237
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Amy immediately just being like

238
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
fuck you now, that's not fair.

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't do this.

240
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry, but you seem

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
suspicious.

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right now, believe me, my baby girl,

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I would never, I would never

244
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
have to fly.

245
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If it's not Amy, I'm voting

246
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
for Strony next round.

247
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait, why am I getting in trouble?

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Obviously, it's going to say imposter.

249
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're so passionate.

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work.

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll go find the other imposter while you're at it.

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll do it. I'll try my best.

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Damn, Strony, I fucking love you.

254
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Pigeonino?

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I've heard the tune, but you don't give a damn.

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
See you in death, baby girl.

257
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wait, what?

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait, you didn't do it!

259
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You didn't do it!

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wait, she didn't do it!

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mother.

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mother.

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wait, wait, Mercy,

264
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mercy said she saw it.

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mercy reported.

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I walked in.

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I walked in.

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know about this.

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

270
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What? I just walked in.

271
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to go do my shit.

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If somebody kills me, it was Strony.

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait, I'm not fucking doing it.

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mercy!

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Mercy, no!

276
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Guys, guys, I'm having a little issue.

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're cheating nasty whore.

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't see anything.

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hold on.

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can you guys hear me?

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, can you use her?

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I feel so betrayed, man.

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where are you?

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My atoll.

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We're so hurt by this development.

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't see anything.

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In my defense, Amy, what kind of defense is I didn't do it?

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You had no alibi.

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The candlestick was in the lounge.

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The billiard room had the freaking pool queue.

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And it was like, what was that alibi?

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't do it.

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, we got a play pro punt on D mode.

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Clue.

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Clue reference.

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That was horrible. I hated every second of that.

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I love Shadow the Hedgehog.

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Literally, I was like, I'm being accused

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
by a shadow the Hedgehog lover.

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know.

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, we can't let Sonic the Hedgehog

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
go down without fight.

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not Sonic, it's Shadow!

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh my god, please, get away!

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Whatever the hell his name is, whatever the hell his name is.

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They both begin with.

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, thank god.

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hopefully, this time, I'll actually be imposter.

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm coming for you, Johnny.

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you're fucking coming for me, I'm coming up.

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You, goodbye.

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, man.

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll be a good little girl.

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll do my test.

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, let's try it now.

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait, where's the map?

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, where the fuck is the map?

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I need to fix the wiring.

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why are they not highlighting it?

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I need to do the asteroid.

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey, Johnny.

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're pretty funny last round.

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Ask the gun to move in that gaslight.

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right, we're playing gal.

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wait, why is the game sound so quiet?

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Guys, I'm going to have to turn up the game sound, unfortunately.

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because that should not be making such a tiny little noise.

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's fine, it's fine.

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Unlock manifolds.

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A reactor, electrical, divert power to security.

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh god, what is that?

334
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Divert power?

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is he divert power?

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh my god, I love the map.

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The map, the map, the map.

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Right, we're going to admin.

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do I report?

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, yes.

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What the hell?

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What the hell?

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was doing it.

344
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I was doing it.

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It shadowed the hedgehog.

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let me talk.

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, found the body.

348
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let the rabbit speak.

349
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I was doing electrical.

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was coming from electrical.

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Actually, I don't know where the map works.

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hold on, let me look at the map.

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can open up the map.

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I walked up near and in between reactor and security.

355
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If that were the body.

356
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I am going to vouch for Rhea in pink.

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because she was near me all the way in navigation.

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I saw her go in the opposite direction.

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I think Rhea is fine.

360
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, yeah, he coughed at me.

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So Strony, Rhea and Mercy are vouching for one another.

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Shebi is claiming she saw it.

363
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So Azura, Mamosa and Rain, you all look in Suss's book.

364
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you guys have to say for yourselves?

365
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I have to say something.

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was in...

367
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was not me.

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I saw...

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How do we know?

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How do we know it wasn't you?

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because I was with Strony.

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Then I went to security and I saw what happened.

373
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't see who killed.

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, it was in between security.

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, but I...

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was in between security and Reactor.

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No, I did see Rain and Admin.

378
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So Azura and Mamosa are now the most likely suspects.

379
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Unless Shebi, you're playing mind game.

380
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So Azura, Mamosa and Shebi are all Suss now.

381
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Unless Ventilation was taken in Electrical.

382
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Which, unfortunately, I don't know.

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't believe a word you say, Azura.

384
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, I'm innocent.

385
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was sitting at the table.

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issues.

387
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can balance.

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can balance.

389
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know who to vote for then.

391
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm gonna vote for Mamosa.

392
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sorry, Mamosa, but you're the most likely target at the moment.

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay.

394
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait, who was the person that said they walked to security?

395
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm gonna skip because I don't know who to vote for.

396
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was me.

397
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Azura and Mamosa have abstained from voting.

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How fucking curious.

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm just wondering.

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What do you guys do?

401
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What do I do to you?

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right, let's find out.

403
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mamosa was an imposter.

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Azura is the most fucking likely.

405
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm keeping an eye on her.

406
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's impossible.

407
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But they're no fucking getting me in these mind games.

408
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I know how these games work.

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm fucking energetic.

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What happens is the lights are off and they don't work.

411
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Wait.

412
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Whoa.

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
One, two, three, four.

414
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

415
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Electrical.

417
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
More like, electricate my music.

418
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Mommy's been so aggressive.

419
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I think it's the lights.

420
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, look. Thank you.

421
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Unless it's Mercy, I bet.

422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

423
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why?

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not me.

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not me.

426
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's not me.

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not me.

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
She's getting nervous.

429
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She's getting nervous.

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not working.

431
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think it's rain.

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, it's rain.

433
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not rain.

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So it's both.

435
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Right.

436
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We do kind of need to breathe oxygen.

437
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Not going to lie.

438
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We need a cheeky bit of oxygen.

439
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Very fucking curious.

440
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It wasn't.

441
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Wait a moment.

442
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Who was attacking you?

443
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's fucking Mercy.

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh my god, guys.

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether.

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I do believe it might be her.

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, I was walking too.

448
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What was the area on the left?

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was right next to you when you

450
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was alone

451
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
with Rain and Rea

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and Strawny.

453
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was with

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Rain. I think it was Rain.

455
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, it was Rain.

456
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's Mercy.

457
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, it's not.

458
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's freaking you.

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, it's not. I can't believe you would do such a thing to me.

460
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, is there, I'm sorry.

461
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, okay.

462
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It would make sense

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
why Mercy would vote.

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh.

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh!

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yay!

467
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, let's go!

468
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, fantastic.

469
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Game play, fucking flow.

470
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I actually like to approve it

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
because the pressure of being a poster is hard.

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I probably could have killed.

474
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mercy walked right past me

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
because I was just talking to myself

477
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
with a weirdo.

478
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I just wanted to.

479
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I wanted to let you all live.

480
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Look at me being so kind as an imposter,

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
letting you live.

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're not kind.

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm not accepted.

485
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm red, not blue, goddamn.

486
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Jesus.

487
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm lying. I forgive you.

488
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can never be mad.

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All right.

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do my task and shake my hand.

491
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hi, I'm with garbage shooters.

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Garbage shooters.

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm sorry about last time.

494
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Please don't kill me.

495
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We're doing the garbage shoot boys.

496
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Taking out the garbage.

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know what any of this stuff is.

498
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm going to be honest.

499
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm scared.

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is closed. I'm so scared.

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, there you go.

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why are you...

504
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're fine.

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're fine.

506
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm traumatized.

507
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hold on a minute.

508
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Amy is in

509
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
fucking electrical

510
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and who does something upon?

511
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Who are we? Ria's dead body again.

512
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, no.

513
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
She's a victim.

514
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I literally opened the door

515
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because the door just got closed in my face.

516
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Me and...

517
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm fucking on the outside.

518
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And then Amy comes out

519
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and then I go in to the back of the vent section

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and Ria's sitting dead with her retort.

521
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, listen.

522
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Amy,

523
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
do you have to say for yourself?

524
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you tell me to kill myself?

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No, what do you have to say for yourself?

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Not that.

527
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean, if you want to...

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can't stop you.

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was doing electricals.

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes, you were because that's where you killed her.

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She just admitted.

532
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
She just admitted.

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She was...

534
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Strony, I think you're making money.

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Strony, when you get like this...

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Strony, when you get like this...

537
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No, because I know...

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Wait, no.

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When Strony came and opened the door,

540
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I screamed because you scared me.

541
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, listen to...

542
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Listen to Amy.

543
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
She literally goes.

544
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
She literally goes.

545
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was in electrical.

546
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's like breaking her microphone.

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She literally goes.

548
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
She literally goes.

549
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I was in electrical.

550
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I tell you, I find the dead body of Rhea in electrical

551
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and you go, oh, it's Strony.

552
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm abstaining.

553
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
All right, then.

554
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
All right, then.

555
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
She goes, I'm in electrical.

556
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I like how nobody's questioning us.

557
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I know it's Amy.

558
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Wait, wait.

559
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know.

560
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If it's Amy, it also might be Mamosa

561
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
because Mamosa was cornering me

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and she saw them walking together.

563
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was chilling with you.

564
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No, I have not seen Azura.

565
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Where's her body?

566
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Probably by the table again.

567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Probably by the table.

568
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
She got the table.

569
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I saw Azura talking.

570
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I saw Azura talking.

571
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000

572
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Right, go do tasks if you want to win

585
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000

I'm voting for Marcy.

589
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000

590
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Na na no.

591
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, Marcy's voting for me.

592
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So when you see me floating in space

593
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and I can't even play the game.

594
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's Marcy.

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
When it goes, oh, when

596
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
when床y is in Poster,

597
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
vote Marcy because she's gonna vote for me

598
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
last time it was Susie Baka.

599
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No.

600
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait, no, Marcy always

601
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
votes for the person that accuses her

602
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
when she's a posture

603
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,920
If you want to lose this crew mate have none, but I'm here at win and you guys

604
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
We know it's not she be

605
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,920
Right when I float away in space and it says

606
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,880
Ronnie was a wee crew mate everyone turned to merci and vote for her. Thank you very much. I rest my frickin case

607
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm no having it

608
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I

609
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,160
Because mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the imposter and accusing her

610
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,120
Back and then scrawny gets so defensive

611
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Have a midget as a pet

612
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Oh

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,920

614
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720

615
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm gonna get absolutely ruled by Amy is gonna be gunning for me if she was an imposter

620
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm glad we gonna for myself as well when my attitude is absolutely stinking in this game. I have to admit

621
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm taking nothing but the pain

622
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,520
They legit are must be like so sick and screaming so you know what we're gonna do next then

623
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,480
We're gonna know and we're gonna be calm and we're gonna laugh

624
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Okay, they're tickling each other behind over here they're tickling each other behind the bin

625
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I

626
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,880
Sorry, I'm getting chased by mercy halfway across the canteen. I'm just here for a scoop of food

627
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm not I'm not gonna lie. I'm just here for a wee bit of food. You just leave me alone

628
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,040
I actually you know what if you're imposter you should come for me first cuz I'm gonna figure out who the

629
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,480
Right who's dead as there came from here. So there's a dead body in here. It's a zero

630
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Right, but there's no dead body

631
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
So we can't approve we can't actually prove

632
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,760
Right check in Azura did come from here. We're actually gonna be a cheeky we that and pop on cameras, right? Okay. Okay, we're motion

633
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,840
Right Amy and Azura together right, but my motion here. Oh, everyone's fucking cleaned up

634
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,800
Right Azura and Amy can get a kill on each other right now if they're feeling confident enough

635
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,440
They're having a wee giggle. They're having a wee laugh. Azura is holding back not really doing any tasks. I don't like what I'm seeing

636
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,760
We are going to do the last oh, sorry, I can count numbers one, two

637
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Six of them eight nine ten

638
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,440
Okay, lovely. We're gonna go back on cameras because these imposters think they're gonna get the better of me absolutely fucking

639
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,560
Right, we see it Azura and Amy together again

640
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,440
Interesting interesting they two seem to be hugging one another

641
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,080
Mamosa has come out come out rails now coming my way I repeat rea is now coming my way

642
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,520
Not the good way rea is not coming. Oh shit. Oh, you're pissed. Oh, you can't

643
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:18,360
What I'm fucking are you going for me? Be honest. I think I think I think I think you're going a little skit

644
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm actually gonna get done by real. She's so cute. She's gonna be done. I'm gonna say thank you by the end of it

645
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
She'd be

646
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,440
Hold on right and I'm Amy again are on their own

647
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
I kind of trust Strelny

648
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,200
My task someone comes I'm a little scared of she be

649
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:48,640
I'm observing my my elf eyes are open camera. Oh god. She's going down into I believe med bay

650
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
She be out of med bay

651
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,080
Incredibly quickly timing on she be coming out of med bay almost as if uninterested in any test meriskay is fucking over me

652
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm getting nervous

653
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Me

654
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,800
Only rain I found rain dead in the back of electrical nobody was nearby

655
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,640
But I have a feeling it might be rea and Azura because they like to sit what with each other

656
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
They like a whole pants cuz they're go

657
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,600
And rea together no, I saw yeah

658
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,880
And then I was with Azura and then she became a mocked in on us

659
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,520
Well, that doesn't mean they couldn't have vented from electrical to

660
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
Mercy are very

661
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,440
Lately I've had to do the time in order to do electrical unless Mercy vented from below

662
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,240
But I actually wait did I see you come on cameras from I don't think that would make any sense. I think it's Azura

663
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I'm sorry

664
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040

667
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,880
Yeah, cuz I've already done on my task. They don't take that long. I mean I saw my tasks, but I'm really scared

668
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,040
No, I don't do that. I'll stay on count. Oh, Mary's is gonna fucking wallop me

669
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
I don't trust me either. She's fucking larkin and we can talk

670
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,040
She was the imposter and so I was like bye

671
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Amy's actually going to save

672
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Mamosa is following Amy so whatever happens in that room Mamosa and Amy are confirmed to be together. Yeah, piss off

673
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360

Did you run so slowly

677

You know

678
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,720
It doesn't take five seconds to type in a code

679
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,360
Okay, well, I guess we'll see I'll guess we'll see

680
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,760
Mosa if it's if it's not her

681
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
The person that's trying to kill you

682
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Maybe you guys are both

683
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,400
Posters, I don't trust either one of you now

684
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Like a sassy vodka social beat

685
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Only people I trust here

686
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I'm gonna stop accusing

687
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm sorry

688
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
I

689
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Know

690
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,160
Why don't you know just have open we gotta give

695
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,920
I'm tired of sweating mommy Mamosa's coming for you

Absolutely done diddle that round

698
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,960
There we go this way. I thought it was curious how much mercy was sticking to me on cam

699
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Okay, okay, let her say her piece

700
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,720
Dude she be looking right man, dude, no, I think it's rain

702
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,480
I'm skipping my boat. I'm I can't I'm upstanding. I'm upstaining

703
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,400
Lily walked away not knowing where I was going

704
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,760
Listen if the imposter wins you guys are gonna lose okay, all right, that's all I have to say

705
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040

Know mercy mercy didn't know where she was going

707
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,800
That was such a quick fucking round like bro, but I didn't even have time to gather any information

708
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,760
We downloaded this like proximity chat thing so we can like only hear each other when we get close

709
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Obviously it means we can like scream at each other when we're playing the game. It's just really fun

710
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,440
Or I think it's funny. I thought it was cute

711
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,560
Maybe yeah, I'm talking about proximity chat to the reeflings

712
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,240
Yeah, I was gonna say the hover and around I didn't really

So mercy, I don't know where strong. Oh, yeah, Ronnie. I saw her like a long time ago

733
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
But mercy was in the hallway

734
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,520
I had walked all the way from weapons through cafeteria and then found her body there

735
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,040
Where Rayo, Rayo, where did you come from? I went from so I went in the circle

736
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,960
I went from admin to down and then through I think it's

737
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
So you were the last one to see mercy

738
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Yeah, I was I think actually

739
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,680
I'm voting rain because she's a sure yes

740
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Voting rain

741
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Listen, I'm pretty sure it's rare

742
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,680
Okay, I was shooting asteroids as her you saw me sit in there and walk by sitting there

743
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
But

744
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
No, poor Rayo

745
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
I thought it was I me I think it might be

746
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,560
I don't think it's I I don't know anyone that I know it's I me is one of them

747
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,120
Yes, I freaking know I I me had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I watched her do the oxygen

749
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Maybe

750
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,680
Rain cannot lie. I think she's grooming you. I think it's a Zura and rain

751
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I

752
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,280
I did I did see you walk past me, but you could have looked back around you might have been waiting for your moment

753
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Because I literally ran past

754
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,440
A rain and no, it's not I don't think it's I think it's actually I me

755
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,320
I don't think it's a Zura at all. I think it's I me and rea. Oh shit

756
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Get out of here

757
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
You cheating conniving whore

758
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Now we just gotta get

759
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Okay, then who's it gonna be who's gonna be

760
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
I mean, I mean

761
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Uh, if they kill one of us

762
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
So we need

763
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,880
Or we can hit the table oxygen depleted

764
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
It's a Zura. It's a Zura

765
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
One of them and let them know

766
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,440
We just gotta kill one of them

767
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
About her off

768
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,680
I know it's you

769
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,680
Why was rain so hard voting for her old

770
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,240
Dude, I was trying to help her so you guys wouldn't think it was her

771
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Rea, please don't get groomed

772
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200

773
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680

788
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680

Are you're sitting? Oh, I guess I guess he's not gonna be able to listen to us

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,960
I really cannot hear. Oh, well, you don't need audio to play this game. Are you're sitting? Of course not

791
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Someone echoing

792
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Who is echoing?

793
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,720
I would need it. One's game is echoing. Oh, what's my joke? What's my ta- oh, na na

795
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,160
Oh, no, I can't see you guys. It's pretty good

796
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Do you remember

797
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I'm playing mid-summer

798
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,040
I shouldn't do that. It's fine. What's this?

799
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Go go

800
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,400
Right, I need to do cameras next so I can start freeing people

801
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,800
Right, I'm on cameras. What's going on? We've got rea

802
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,560
Hold on. There's an emergency. I'm helping with the emergency

803
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Wait, am I being dumb?

804
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,920
Can I not interact with this? Wait, that's the pretend to interact with this?

805
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:02,040
Am I being dumb? Where's the oxygen freaking help help? Where's the oxygen help?

806
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,800
Help any oxygen breathers. Hello, how do I interact with the oxygen?

807
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
No

808
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,600
Guys, listen, she was standing right there. I walk into the card room or whatever then I am used dead body

809
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,240
And then mercy then reports. Why are we just standing?

810
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,040
Because I was doing I was doing the um, I was doing the downloads and I wouldn't let me go

811
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,920
Wait, you did a freaking nervous. She saw me. You did a task before

812
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
It's a self report. Wait, oh my god

813
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,760
How do you not notice the body you did a task before reporting a body on purpose. Yes or no, that's us

814
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,920
I think it's mercy

815
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,120
It's the download thing. Well, you can vote for me if you want, but it's gonna say

816
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,160
And then I'm gonna tell you told you so I'm voting for you. I'm sorry. Yeah

817
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
If you vote for me if you want that sounds very

818
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

819
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,120
This is off topic when the oxygen thing comes on what do you

820
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,280
Did I look at the wrong part of the map for the oxygen because I was trying to turn it back on

821
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,200
Wait, why is there a crime just on the right side of the map?

822
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,120
Hey, mercy, if it's not you, I'm sorry. I'm real sorry

823
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Wait, why are you going for me?

824
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,880
Why should I randomly get a vote because I'm doing oxygen

825
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,280
Why did I get a friend of both?

826
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,640
I don't know why any of you ever trust stroney, I don't

827
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
I was trying to do the oxygen

828
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,680
No, I'm so serious. I'm so serious when I say this

829
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,200
I was trying to do the oxygen

830
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,840
I was doing I was trying to do the oxygen. I said I'm perfect

831
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,040
Because then I would have an alibi to say that I'm top left when the bodies were done

832
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,120
Right before

833
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,840
I will choose who the imposter is

834
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Because I honestly didn't I was like looking at the map and it was flashing. I'm like, where's the f I'm not supposed to go

835
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Hey, I couldn't mean

836
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,080
Honestly, I walked in and I was like me and rea. We're just swiping our cards having a jolly good time

837
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,200
Bro, I literally went one three two one

No, it was every it was everyone. It was everyone. They couldn't hear none of you talk

848
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,640
What does the reactor meltdown do? Do you know what that does by any chance?

849
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,440
It kills all of us. Oh, okay. Uh, where do you put it on right? I'm gonna just trust someone else is dealing with it

850
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,360
Yeah, yeah, see I worked it off, right? Okay. Is there was this awesome about this?

851
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040

854
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,760
This is a hell of a right and you go navigation, which is like one of the most unsafe locations due to the oh, right?

855
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Well, then I mean

856
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Oh

857
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040

00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,680

Never play. I mean he's just not allowed to play. He's not allowed to play. Um, she was killing

861
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,040
And she I saw me doing the reactor shit. I don't know how this thing works. I was a navigation good

862
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,120
I was in wiring in front of azure

863
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:22,920
She is sus though. She was laughing easily chasing me down a hallway. I ran into the open arms of mimosa

864
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,880
It was really fun

865
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
Rain, who were you with?

866
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,360
I was with mercy

867
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
Rain and marci

868
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Where was reya? Where was reya at?

869
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,600
Okay, because I was also at the zero at one point. Azura, who are you accusing?

870
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,240
I don't remember the truth. I didn't know what I didn't accuse you. No, I have no clue what's going on

871
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,960
Right, right, right. Okay. Azura took a

872
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:01,080
Azura took a hot second to do any type of task. She followed me from cafeteria down to storage and imparted with

873
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,960
When you talk, I don't believe you

874
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,480
That's also true and that's very on par for you. I won't say

875
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,480
I didn't see anybody nearby, but the closest was ran into the lives anymore

876
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,480
Okay, all I know is they were by oh two

877
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,200
No, no, no

878
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Oh strongy, but when I

879
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,840
When I actually am the poster or it's so strongy is Amy. Okay, I see how it is

880
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,960
Wait, who this time she's not talking that much. I literally shove up yours. I'm a little imposter. Why is

881
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,080
I don't I think it's mercy. I don't

882
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
She's being sassy

883
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,320
How about you abstain from existing my only

884
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,480
My only

885
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,280
In my only inclination is memos. Is that your cat's food dish? Yes

886
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,840
My only inclination is mimosa self-report is my only inclination and then mercies. Oh my god, don't tell them

887
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,880
Whoa, I don't know who to vote for guys. I don't know

00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,520
I have stains rain abstained. Can I you will shift the eyes? Don't touch me

889
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,200
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how to believe

890
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,680
I don't know how to believe you believe me

891
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,400
Because you know, you know when I when I'm not running and Raven that's when you know because when you know you

I'm gonna hang out with strongy. Yes. I'm I'm checking

894
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,160
You can see cameras when I look at cameras as well, can't you? Yeah. Yeah, we can both look at cameras

895
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:07,480
All right. I strongy mom. I think we're both good. Okay. I'm happy to say we're good if you're good because you're

896
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:14,280
That'd be hilarious if you killed me. Azura is literally lingering outside because she's waiting for one of us to be alone

897
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,520
She can kill us

898
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,640
I actually have to do a task bottom right to be honest

899
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,240
All right, I'm gonna go with me and if I die. Oh, no, don't no, no, don't come with me bottom right

900
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,760
I need to do. Okay. Okay. I need to do something in communication. Whoa

901
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,480
It doesn't matter

902
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,240
What oh, Azura it's Azura

903
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,480
Dude, I think it's Azura too. I saw her walking into electrical

904
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,480
Yeah, it's Azura and mercy electrical and found a body. What the fuck

905
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,720
What the fuck? Me and strongy are good. I was hanging out with strongy looking at cameras

906
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Yeah, Azura was lurking around

907
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,480
How are you gonna say it's me? I think I'm trying to find someone to follow

908
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,120
Being creepy. Uh, I'm gonna vote for this mercy because you don't trust that stuff she's looking at me

909
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,600
Mercy, who did you see on the map? Listen to me

910
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,360
What?

911
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,160
Mercy, who were you with or who did you see at any point in the map?

912
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
I passed by mimosa

913
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,520
Oh, when you killed her? No, he didn't. No

914
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,760
It's rain. It's rain. It's rain. It's literally rain. I was

915
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,200
It's

916
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Listen, I know

917
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,200
But why where's the reasoning Azura?

918
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,160
I said it. I was literally with you guys in I was literally with you guys in security

919
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,720
I went to the security with you guys and then I went up

920
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,640
I went and did my task and came back down and she said did she accuse me?

921
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
She accused me

922
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,240
Oh, I fucking heard that giggle at the end of his

923
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,240
All right. All right. She's so pretty

924
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Fuck you. I'm hiding in the corner. Fuck this. Wait, you coming with me. I don't trust any of you guys, man

925
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,600
With you strongy. That's a those

926
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,800
I'm allowed to go. I don't know who the fuck is missing out on task, but we're literally about to get double teamed. I fucking

927
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,720
Run run run run run. We're getting double teamed

928
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,640
Oh

929
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
It's fucking mercy

930
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,640
It's mercy and rain. It's mercy and rain. It's mercy and rain

931
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,320
It's rain. Volt Marcy. They're gonna double them. They win. If they do a double kill they win. Volt rain

932
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,240
Well, well, well, well, well, that's it.

933
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
You guys were huddling up in that freaking room.

934
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,600
Volt rain. Azura, you have to listen to us. Volt rain. Listen to me. It's rain. Volt rain.

935
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,400
Okay, we're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain.

936
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
And they didn't care. And they didn't care.

937
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,840
Because her and Mercy almost doubled me in Strani.

938
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,340
Literally.

939
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,800
No, we didn't man.

940
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,740
You guys were going to double me.

941
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,580
You guys were lining yourselves up to stab me in my bauhole.

942
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,180
Yeah, look at Ray do a fucking heal Mary on that vote against Sheebie.

943
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,660
We can see you on my yellow.

944
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,800
We can see you on my yellow.

945
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,300
Yeah.

946
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,860
It's Mercy, it's Mercy, it's Mercy.

948
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,960
Stay away, stay away from the yandere.

949
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,760
Hit the button, I can't call it.

950
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Oh wait, I can't call either.

951
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,620
I need 10 seconds.

952
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,740
Oh my God, before she can get run away, run away from the circle.

953
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:14,220
Rangarenda Rosy, the pumpkin Phillipo, she's a tissue, a tissue.

954
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:18,780
Get that, get that yandere off this ship right now.

955
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,940
She's creeping me out.

956
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,620
You're not even talking, that's how guilty you are.

957
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,860
You're, you're, you're running in a circle, chasing me and Strani.

958
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,420
When I actually have the chance to actually like pay attention.

959
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,820
What is her up to?

960
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,620
What did I have?

961
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,020
Cause I spent the entire game fucking with other shit.

962
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,220
And now I get to finally play.

963
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,020
Yeah.

964
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,220
Yes.

965
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,620
If Azura is in the posture, I'm really going to commit.

966
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,620
I'm smart.

967
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,420
I'm not a postage.

968
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,220
No, she wasn't.

969
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,820
You can tell by the tone of her voice.

970
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,220
Yeah, they weren't going to double us.

971
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:56,820
Yeah.

972
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,020
They weren't going to double us.

973
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,620
Thank God, Azura, you saved us.

974
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,620
The gamer in six.

975
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,620
Thank you.

976
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,620
Let's say go brothers.

977
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,620
That was easy.

978
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,620
That was good.

979
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,620
We're going to start an MLG group of among us unironically.

980
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,620
Hell no.

981
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,620
Hell no.

982
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
We're fine.

983
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,620
Okay.

984
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,620
Okay.

985
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,620
My girls hydrate.

986
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
Hydration.

987
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,620
Hydration.

988
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,620
This coffee counts.

989
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
Coffee counts.

990
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,620
Just hydrate.

991
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,620
Just hydrate because it's been an hour, roughly.

992
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Thank you.

993
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,620
Thank you.

994
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,620
I'm sorry.

995
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,620
I've been bullying you a little too much this round.

996
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,620
Let's go navigation.

997
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,620
Please don't touch me.

998
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,620
No, I'm the navigation.

999
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,620
You don't play a game of fire truck?

1000
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
That's an absolutely terrible joke, too.

1001
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,620
You don't ever repeat switch tricks, do you think?

1002
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,620
It is ill-advised.

1003
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,620
I can repeat switch tricks.

1004
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,620
Okay.

1005
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,620
Nothing in the shadows.

1006
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,620
Nothing.

1007
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,620
Nothing.

1008
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,620
Are we minors?

1009
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,620
Well, minors.

1010
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,620
She wasn't actually doing a task in the Slurkin Bay as well.

1011
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,620
They're killing me again.

1012
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,620
Yeah, we are.

1013
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Sorry to god.

1014
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,620
I'm supposed to get the fuck away from you.

1015
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,620
Wait.

1016
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,620
We just...

1017
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,620
They just treat me.

1018
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,620
No one.

1019
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,620
All right, it's five so there's at least a fucking witness inside.

1020
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,620
I got it.

1021
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,620
Using this room.

1022
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,620
How do I use it?

1023
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,620
No.

1024
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,500
Oh my gosh, I got it in one go.

1025
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:36,620
It's impossible, I just want to make a note, Mamosa, wait I want to make a note, Mamosa

1031
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:17,460

1032
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:29,300
What, everyone just perfectly disappeared?

1033
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,300
So I need to do my head like this.

1034
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,300
Okay, we did it.

1035
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Oh, come on.

1036
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,300
Who is laughing?

1037
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,300
What's going on here?

1038
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,300
Azura and Mercer together.

1039
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,300
The real follows.

1040
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,300
Ah, shit.

1041
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,300
She be no follows.

1042
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,300
Oh, come on.

1043
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,300
Wait, no.

1044
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,300
She killed me.

1045
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,300
No idea.

1046
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,300
She killed me.

1047
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,300
The whole show was so close.

1048
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,300
She was trying to get me.

1049
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,300
She was trying to get me.

1050
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,300
She was trying to get me.

1051
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,300
She was trying to get me.

1052
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Earlier, earlier.

1053
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,300
My mother was chasing me.

1054
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:28,300
I did watch, but I don't know, you broke my trust before, I mean, I don't know, I don't know what to say.

1055
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:36,300
It's I mean, I was chasing around them, I was chasing her and messing with her and she killed me.

1056
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,300
I don't know who, I don't know who it was.

1057
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,300
She beat me up.

1058
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,300
I'm going to say it won't stop.

1059
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,300
She did beat me up.

1060
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,300
She did beat me up.

1061
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
She did beat me up.

1062
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,300
She did beat me up.

1063
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,300
She did beat me up.

1064
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Oh, you guys are so dumb.

1065
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,300
You weren't doing any jobs, fool.

1066
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,300
We were no dumb.

1067
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,300
That's crazy.

1068
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,300
I mean, I mean, I mean, I didn't mean it.

1069
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,300
It wasn't me.

1070
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,300
What the fuck?

1071
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,300
She wasn't doing any jobs.

1072
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,300
She was like jumping corners and stuff and not doing anything.

1073
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,300
Sorry, anyone thought she looked suss to me?

1074
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,300
I don't know what to do here.

1075
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Wait, what?

1076
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,300
What?

1077
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Are we, I was going to say, are we can interact in each other?

1078
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,300
Vote it out.

1079
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,300
Oh, who got voted out?

1080
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Chibi, what is it?

1081
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
I don't trust Ivy again.

1082
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,300
I didn't.

1083
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Okay, well, we'll just vote her off.

1084
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,300
She was so adamant.

1085
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Yes, she was.

1086
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,300
The same tears as before.

1087
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
I don't want to get my heart broken again.

1088
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
We shared a kiss.

1089
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
I trust you, fuck it.

1090
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,300
I'll trust you.

1091
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,300
No, Missy.

1092
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,300
I mean, Blav has been a weird.

1093
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,300
I'm in a relationship.

1094
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,300
I'm in a relationship.

1095
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,300
Yes, me too.

1096
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,300
I'm going to abstain.

1097
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,300
I don't know.

1098
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,300
I'm going to do what I must.

1099
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,300
I'm doing what I must.

1100
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,300
I'm doing what I must.

1101
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,300
I don't trust you.

1102
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
What about all the time?

1103
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,300
I'm going to kill everyone now.

1104
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,300
Wait, Tronka's been very quiet.

1105
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,300
I don't trust you?

1106
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,300
It may be rare.

1107
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,300
Okay.

1108
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
We only got to be the reacting out?

1109
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,300
Rhea go.

1110
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,300
Rhea has been an imposter.

1111
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
It has to be.

1112
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:48,060
I'm waiting for someone on the other side hold react to normal all right I think

1113
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:54,300
Put that on hmm I actually didn't eat

1114
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:05,300
I think I just saw message that she just went from I think message is bent I think she just caught the trail under there

1115
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:19,300
Sorry I'm actually sweating and try hard and I can't actually do mercy and she vented and that's how we got to that all about to win though

1116
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:29,300
I need to go to cameras whoa stay on little one mommy's not looking for anything

1117
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:40,300
I don't want to get vented and oh shit what happened she was dead where did you find her

1118
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,300
I found her in what's that area Med Bay

1119
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,300
I said I found her in Med Bay I finished my task

1120
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:53,300
It's Trony it's Trony it's Trony wait why is it fucking me

1121
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:58,300
It's definitely Azure because I was in wiring admin with Azure

1122
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
Yeah yeah it's Trony why

1123
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:07,300
Right well fucking relaxing with your accusations it's fucking mercy self report

1124
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:14,300
No let me speak if you're gonna excuse me it's mercy self report I saw her

1125
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:22,300
It's mercy self report it's mercy self report and I will tell you oh fuck off

1126
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,300

1128
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Thank you no one was fucking mercy

1129
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:52,300
I knew I knew I saw the tail end of mercy come out of it sorry

1130
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,300
Sorry I need to mute the girls so you guys know exactly

1131
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:03,300
I saw the tail end of mercy coming out of electrical which couldn't have made any sense due to fucking geographical shit

1132
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:10,300
So they're all getting fucking muted right now so I could explain that I caught mercy and that's why I asked is where did you find the body in Med Bay

1133
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:17,300
She had been venting around the map but because Azure is so gun whole

1134
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:23,300
Anyway I still win in that case because I knew who the bad guy was

1135
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,300
Just let him fight it out

1136
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,300
We've hung out the entire time

1137
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,300
We have a cat fight

1138
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,300
We've hung out the entire time

1139
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,300
It's mercy

1140
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,300
Okay I'm voting Azure

1141
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,300

But you instantly went for me when I hadn't done the single thing

01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
It was Rea and Azura

1245
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,300
It was Rea

1246
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,300
Vote off the imposter

1247
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,300
We're missing people

1248
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,300
We gotta restart the lobby

1249
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,300

1267
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,300

Goodbye

1297
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,300

Ghost

1306
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,300
Ghost

1307
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Why is it so quiet

1308
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,300
Yeah

1309
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,300
I did it for us Rhea

1310
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,300
There we go

1311
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,300
Get Mercy in here

1312
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,300

I know we can

1322
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,300
There's like this in the lobby

1323
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,300
Okay

1324
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,300

That'd be great

1327
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,300
You guys

1328
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,300
We are really good

1329
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,300
For once

1330
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,300
I fucking love when

1331
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Like there's four people

1332
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,300
When there's two of us together

1333
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,300
I love going three, two, one

1334
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,300
I'm so satisfied

1335
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,300
I'm so satisfied

1336
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,300
Being like execute the plan

1337
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,300
You're a hit woman

1338
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,300
Anyways my next goal

1339
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,300
Is to follow someone just for fun

1340
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,300
Oh just to wind them up and make them

1341
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,300
Shibbe why do you sound so far away

1342
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
Yeah it was okay I felt like Shibbe's in my brain

1343
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,300
Oh

1344
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,300
You're gonna marry me

1345
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,300
I forgot

1346
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,300
She has like an actual place to live

1347
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,300
And doesn't live in her basement like me

1348
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,300
I like how her kitchen is right next to her desk

1349
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,300
That's cool

1350
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,300
I want food right next to me all the time

1351
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,300
Honestly Rhea was too good

1352
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,300
I like believed her

1353
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,300
I believed her

1354
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,300
Rhea you're so freaking innocent

1355
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,300
She's such a good liar

1356
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,300
You're capable of anything

1357
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,300
She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice

1358
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,300
You're just so innocent

1359
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,300
You didn't change your tone of voice at all

1360
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,300
When lying

1361
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,300
Oh why is my peeing dancing like that

1362
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,300
You see that I went all the way up to 300

1363
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,300
Mane's at 200 by default

1364
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,300
Never trust Rhea

1365
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,300
I can't tell

1366
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,300
She's one of the few people I can't tell

1367
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,300
You can tell really good mercy

1368
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
You caught on to me

1369
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,300
My mouth is dry

1370
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,300
I'm sorry Rain

1371
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,300
I just noticed your voice

1372
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
Thank you Shibbe

1373
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,300
My mouth is dry

1374
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,300
I believed her to the end as well

1375
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,300
Get ass I believed Raina to the end

1376
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
I can never tell if she's a fanatic

1377
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
Is she ever lying or not

1378
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,300
I can never tell if she's lying or not

1379
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,300
I can tell because she's real defensive

1380
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Every time you don't let someone finish

1381
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,300
It feels like you're being defensive

1382
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,300
And not letting the person speak

1383
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,300
So you're deflecting

1384
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
So I assume that you're the

1385
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,300
You gotta let me

1386
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,300
You gotta let me explain

1387
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,300
Because you're lying

1388
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,300
Fight fight fight

1389
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,300
You gotta let me explain why

1390
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,300
And then you have to tell me why I'm wrong

1391
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,300
Honestly if you listen to what I know

1392
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,300
I'm gonna go through it that way

1393
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,300
Because you voted too quickly

1394
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,300
So let me

1395
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,300
Well yeah because you didn't let me speak

1396
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,300
Honestly I wanted to

1397
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,300
I wanted to

1398
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,300
I thought scrawny was suspicious anyways

1399
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,300
It just feels good

1400
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,300
It's super sad

1401
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,300
What am I gonna do?

1402
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Right, scrawny is suspicious

1403
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,300
I see how it is

1404
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,300
That's it, you'll get that

1405
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,300
That's it, I'll be your member

1406
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,300
It's funny

1407
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,300
It's suspicious

1408
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,300
It's a 40 days, no pain

1409
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,300
It's what they deserve

1410
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,300
A 40 days

1411
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,300
What they deserve

1412
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
40 days, 20 nights

1413
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,300
You make push scrawny

1414
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,300
You're a really good guy

1415
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,300
You're the cold suspension

1416
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,300
We're not gonna lie

1417
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,300
You're really good at gaslighting

1418
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,300
So I'll say one thing

1419
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,300
The girls have never seen me

1420
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,300
At any other type of motion

1421
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,300
They're more than happy

1422
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,300
And proud of their work

1423
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,300
So playing among us

1424
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,300
When I'm screaming down the make

1425
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,300
Being like, it's fucking da

1426
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,300
Is probably quite a surprise for them

1427
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,300
It is

1428
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
I was just like

1429
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,300
Honestly, yeah

1430
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,300
I expected it

1431
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,300
Nice and refreshed, Daniel

1432
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,300
Trouble from school

1433
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,300
I wanna

1434
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,300
I wanna see Azura and Rhea

1435
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,300
Or scrawny and Rhea team up

1436
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,300
That's what I wanna see

1437
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,300
That'd be funny

1438
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,300
Scrawny and Rhea

1439
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
I haven't gotten imposter once

1440
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,300
You've not been imposter?

1441
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,300
Yeah, guys, let's give Azura a chance

1442
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,300
Okay

1443
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,300
Let's give Azura imposter

1444
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
The statistics of Azura being imposter

1445
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,300
Are very high now

1446
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,300
Just to keep that in mind

1447
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,300
Yeah

1448
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,300
Probability statistics

1449
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,300
Just for everyone

1450
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,300
Don't do that

1451
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,300
See, look, she's gaslighting

1452
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,300
I'm gonna get killed

1453
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,300
She says things like this

1454
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
See, they're funny

1455
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,300
This is how I get killed

1456
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,300
They're all fine to mess with

1457
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,300
I'm eating goldfish

1458
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,300
I'm eating goldfish

1459
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,300
A snack that smiles best

1460
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,300
That's a regular kind of goldfish

1461
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,300
She says scrawny

1462
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,300
Because she says the suss is shit ever

1463
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,300
Her names are Rhea

1464
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,300
She's a screw

1465
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
Oh no, my hair is thick

1466
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,300
Again

1467
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,300
I'm sick of being a crewmate

1468
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,300
I'm gonna be

1469
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait

1470
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,300
Who said that?

1471
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,300
Clean the leaves out of the filter

1472
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,300
What are you looking for

1473
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,300
There's nothing here for you

1474
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,300
Alright, I'm talking to my cat

1475
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,300
Nice, Ronnie

1476
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
Okay, sorry

1477
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,300
I'm like, are you doing any tests, Shuby?

1478
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,300
Or are you just like pulling me right now?

1479
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,300
No

1480
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,300
Oh, take your time

1481
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,300
I'll protect you

1482
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,300
Go someplace

1483
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Wow

1484
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,300
Okay, I did it

1485
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,300
Yay

1486
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,300
I'm a shiny safe

1487
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,300
I did swipe card

1488
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,300
We just did the swipe card

1489
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,300
Yeah

1490
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,300
Right, okay

1491
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,300
Electrical, please

1492
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,300
Excuse me, my lovely wife

1493
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,300
I have to go to

1494
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,300
Electrical too

1495
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,300
Okay, okay, be safe in here

1496
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,300
Safety in numbers

1497
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,300
Safety in numbers

1498
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,300
Wait, where's the body?

1499
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,300
Where is the other body?

1500
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,300
Oh my god

1501
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,300
Oh my god, holy shit

1502
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
What happened?

1503
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,300
I was about to report

1504
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,300
Wait, where was everyone?

1505
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,300
I was about to report

1506
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Wait, where's my...

1507
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,300
Shuby, Shuby, Shuby

1508
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,300
Where was she found the body?

1509
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,300
Raya was literally with me

1510
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,300
And Strani as well

1511
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,300
I saw Strani

1512
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,300
I passed by those two

1513
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,300
I was in electrical

1514
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,300
There was a body there

1515
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,300
Wait

1516
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,300
Well

1517
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,300
First of all

1518
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,300
Wait

1519
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,300
Excuse me

1520
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,300
Secondly

1521
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,300
I was shooting asteroids

1522
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,300
And I walked down

1523
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,300
And there was a body at oxygen

1524
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,300
And it was Mimosa

1525
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,300
She was probably doing like a little shoot

1526
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Is anyone being a navigation

1527
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Or to our weapons?

1528
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
Yes or no?

1529
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,300
No

1530
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,300
Yes

1531
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,300
No

1532
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,300
I was in cafeteria

1533
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,300
I was about to do electrical

1534
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,300
Wait, who was cafeteria?

1535
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,300
I know it's Strani

1536
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,300
I just know it's Strani

1537
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,300
I just know it's Strani

1538
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,300
Bro, you fucking...

1539
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,300
Wait, hold on a minute

1540
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,300
Hold on a minute

1541
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,300
I say who's been near weapons O2 navigation

1542
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,300
Because you have reported the body

1543
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,300
And where O2

1544
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,300
And you automatically go to Strani

1545
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,300
Sorry

1546
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,300
I know you love playing these mind games

1547
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,300
Being like, Strani, Strani, Strani

1548
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,300
But get to...

1549
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,300
No, no, no, no

1550
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,300
You're the only one

1551
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,300
It's Strani

1552
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,300
It's fucking she

1553
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,300
I mean, hold on

1554
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,300
It's Strani

1555
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,300
No, no, no, no

1556
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on

1557
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,300
Wait, hold on

1558
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,300
Notice how I'm nice and calm

1559
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,300
And she's freaking out

1560
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,300
And that's all I'm gonna say

1561
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,300
I'm reaching on me when you

1562
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,300
Self-reported the body

1563
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,300
When you're the only person

1564
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,300
Who's been witnessing weapons O2 navigation

1565
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,300
Fucking rain

1566
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
Clearly because the body was there

1567
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,300
For a lot longer

1568
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,300
Yeah, it could be both

1569
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
The body must have been there for a while

1570
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,300
Because no one else has been there

1571
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,300
No one said anything

1572
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,300
I was feeling the cafeteria

1573
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,300
Talking to my cat

1574
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,300
Literally all of them

1575
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,300
And then I went and shot some asteroids

1576
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,300
It could be Imi

1577
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on

1578
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,300
I mean, who were you with again?

1579
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,300
I was with Reia and Strani

1580
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,300
Was in the room with us

1581
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,300
When we swapped the cards

1582
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,300
Yeah, I was with Amy

1583
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,300
In the admin room

1584
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,300
Yeah

1585
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,300
Did you see Reia's body?

1586
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,300
No, I didn't

1587
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,300
No, I didn't

1588
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,300
No, because she was alive

1589
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,300
And then when she walked off

1590
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,300
And then that's...

1591
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,300
And then I was singing a song

1592
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,300
Going somewhere else

1593
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,300
Aw

1594
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,300
And then...

1595
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,300
I don't know

1596
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,300
I don't know

1597
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,300
I don't know

1598
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,300
I don't know

1599
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,300
I was walking to the med bay

1600
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,300
And the round goes fast

1601
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,300
It's Strani

1602
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Because Strani kills fast

1603
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,300
What do you mean?

1604
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,300
You're not...

1605
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,300
Right

1606
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,300
No, she could not see

1607
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,300
I don't even know that

1608
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,300
Thank you

1609
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,300
Thank you

1610
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,300
Thank you

1611
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,300
Oh my god

1612
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,300
Don't ever fucking...

1613
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,300
Anyways, we're...

1614
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,300
I'm scared

1615
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,300
I'm scared

1616
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,300
I'm scared

1617
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Now she's shooting at us

1618
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,300
Okay, goodbye

1619
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,300
Imi is lost

1620
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,300
Hi

1621
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,300
Hi

1622
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,300
What did I say?

1623
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,300
She's a gas voter

1624
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,300
She's a gas voter

1625
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Can we ban her, please?

1626
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,300
She's a gas voter

1627
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,300
Damn you

1628
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,300
I thought she banned her

1629
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,300
I'm a gas voter

1630
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,300
I'm a gas voter

1631
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Damn, I'm a gas voter

1632
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,300
I'm a gas voter

1633
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,300
Why does it keep making me blue?

1634
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,300
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud

1635
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,300
She is the impostor

1636
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,300
She's the blue nation

1637
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,300
Sheebie, give me the benefit of the day

1638
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
You're the only person in that area

1639
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,300
Oh my god

1640
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,300
I killed her long ago in that area

1641
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
No, that's what I mean

1642
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,300
I'm like, I had to have happened long ago

1643
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,300
I can't believe mommy would do this

1644
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,300
I'm sorry about that, love

1645
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,300
I can't believe

1646
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,300
I wasn't planning to kill you

1647
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,300
I didn't know

1648
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,300
Look, look

1649
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,300
Listen, listen

1650
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,300
Are you serious?

1651
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
Are you serious?

1652
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,300
Are you serious?

1653
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,300
Are you serious?

1654
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,300
Are you serious?

1655
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,300
Are you serious?

1656
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,300
I wish you guys could see all the gesturing

1657
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,300
that I'm doing right now

1658
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,300
I knew it was you twice

1659
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,300
I did it

1660
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,300
Honestly, you did

1661
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,300
I will know

1662
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,300
She'll eat a bowl of fish

1663
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,300
You are evil

1664
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,300
No, I'll never be the next one

1665
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,300
I didn't cover up

1666
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,300
I gave you some of my chances to run away

1667
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,300
but you kept running

1668
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,300
I mean, a gas-riding car

1669
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,300
When the killing goes fast

1670
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,300
and when she gets defensive

1671
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,300
you know what's wrong

1672
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,300
You said that we'd double all

1673
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,300
You said that we'd double all

1674
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,300
No, to be fair

1675
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,300
you were the one

1676
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:19,300
I'm sorry. Press the button. Thank you. Rain starts accusing her own teammates. It's rain.

1677
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:27,300
Please, I want you to feel like craved blood. I'm not fighting each other. Craved blood and death.

1678
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:35,300
I tend to accuse my teammates all the time. That's just her strass to kill her teammates.

1679
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:43,300
I'm going to get blamed this round as well. She's hanging about over here.

1680
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,300
Oh no, don't die. You're so hot.

1681
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:59,300
I'm doing the card. I don't have anything here. I'm scared.

1682
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:03,300
Are you needing pals just to get through the game? Because it's too scary.

1683
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,300
I'm probably going to get double gold.

1684
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,300
That's terrifying.

1685
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,300
They keep targeting me.

1686
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:23,300
It's so accusatory.

1687
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,300
Hello, press the button to start.

1688
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:29,300
Did I just close that?

1689
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:35,300
And you've got all the way to freaking electrical mode.

1690
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,300
Who the frick is talking? I can hear someone but I don't see anyone.

1691
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,300
I'm losing out.

1692
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,300
Did I not just hear someone?

1693
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,300
This kid's friendly. I need my medication.

1694
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,300
I literally am seeing no one.

1695
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:59,300
It's not either of us.

1696
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,300
I want everyone to tell me their location right now.

1697
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,300
I was sniffing Shuby.

1698
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:11,300
She was. I was doing the beds or whatever it's called.

1699
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,300
It's not Azura. I promise you.

1700
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,300
Open up the map and tell me where you are.

1701
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,300
It's Mercy. I saw her run off with Rhea.

1702
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,300
Why did you just say that right now Amy?

1703
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:27,300
I just remembered because I was laughing about sniffing Shuby.

1704
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,300
I saw her rain.

1705
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,300
It's not me guys.

1706
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,300
Are you kidding me?

1707
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,300
I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain.

1708
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:45,300
Let me vouch for people. It's not Azura or Shuby.

1709
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,300
I'm vouching for people right now.

1710
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,300
It's definitely because Shuby was following me and then I was following Azura.

1711
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,300
Then Amy was sniffing my ass.

1712
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,300
I was doing the leaves.

1713
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,300
I don't want to ditch my gen.

1714
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,300
I don't want to accuse my gen.

1715
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,300
You're a little bit quieter than you usually are.

1716
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,300
Johnny, why are you so quiet?

1717
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,300
It's rain. It's rain.

1718
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,300
It's rain. It's rain.

1719
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,300
Everyone has ignored my question.

1720
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:15,300
Everyone identify your location on the map right now.

1721
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,300
I'm in storage with my fellow cafeteria.

1722
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,300
We're on our way to cafeteria.

1723
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,300
Someone's in cafeteria.

1724
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,300
Me and Shuby.

1725
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,300
I was in storage with Amy.

1726
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,300
Me, Amy.

1727
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,300
So then Mercy and Amy then?

1728
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,300
No.

1729
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,300
I was literally with Shuby.

1730
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,300
I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time.

1731
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,300
But then Shuby was with me the other half.

1732
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,300
The other half I was not with rain.

1733
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

1734
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

1735
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

1736
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,300
I don't know.

1737
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,300
I think it's Mercy.

1738
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,300
Why?

1739
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,300
I think it's Mercy and Amy.

1740
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,300
Trust me.

1741
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,300
Trust me.

1742
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,300
I'm voting rain.

1743
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,300
I don't know.

1744
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,300
I swear to God.

1745
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,300
It wasn't me.

1746
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,300
It wasn't me.

1747
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,300
It wasn't me.

1748
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,300
I'm going to hold your hand the whole time.

1749
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,300
I would like to also mention

1750
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,300
Mercy did not defend herself

1751
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,300
once during that execution.

1752
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,300
Please keep that in mind.

1753
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,300
It's Mercy.

1754
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,300
It's Mercy and Amy.

1755
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,300
I don't know.

1756
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,300
It's freaking Mercy and Amy.

1757
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,300
I don't know, man.

1758
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,300
I don't know, man.

1759
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,300
I don't know, man.

1760
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,300
I am not.

1761
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:45,300
My mic is not picking up as normal.

1762
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,300
Maybe I was listening to it wrong.

1763
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,300
Get to fuck you.

1764
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,300
Get to fuck you're an electrical.

1765
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,300
Get to fuck!

1766
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,300
I knew it.

1767
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,300
Anyway, I can complete my task as a ghost.

1768
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,300
I was like, yeah, right.

1769
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,300
You're an electrical.

1770
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,300
I freaking doubt it.

1771
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,300
I'm going to defend Ezra.

1772
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,300
Trust.

1773
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,300
Trust.

1774
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,300
You need to pop that button.

1775
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,300
Unless it's Ezra, just doing a big switch.

1776
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,300
I'm going to...

1777
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,300
Oh, my God.

1778
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,300
What is going on?

1779
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,300
What is going on?

1780
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,300
You can follow it.

1781
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,300
Yeah.

1782
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,300
I'm going to Mercy.

1783
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,300
I'm going to Mercy.

1784
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,300
I'm going to Mercy.

1785
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,300
I love you a little, but I knew it was Mercy, too.

1786
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,300
I had a feeling.

1787
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,300
I won't continue to gas like you!

1788
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:55,300
When Stronny said that Mercy was quiet, that's when I knew, I was like, oh, oh, look who's low-toed now.

1789
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,300
I knew it was no octave.

1790
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,300
I didn't get a chance to save you.

1791
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,300
If I get changed to blue one more time.

1792
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,300
I saw Mercy, Mercy was the last person.

1793
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,300
About to kill.

1794
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Mercy, I'd like to abide my time.

1795
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,300
I knew it was Mercy because Mercy was the last one with Rhea and I was trying to tell you guys that.

1796
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,300
No, I know you're sipping the ass of a killer.

1797
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,300
She was following me, following Azura.

1798
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,300
You were following me, following Azura, makes sense now.

1799
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:28,300
Because I was hoping that Mercy would read my mind and we would do a double, but it didn't happen.

1800
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,300
Sorry, my mind play was to make my sound look more suspicious than everyone else.

1801
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,300
I don't trust the rabbit guys, man.

1802
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,300
Well, I don't trust the, what are you, a princess?

1803
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,300
I'm a rain cloud, man.

1804
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:42,300
This is straight up rain cloud!

1805
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:49,300
What is a different rain cloud called? A cumulative member?

1806
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,300
Oh, actually, I didn't mind that task.

1807
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,300
That was rather cute. I found that one rather.

1808
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,300
No, it's hot.

1809
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,300
Okay, it's hot when I'm actually screaming and rage.

1810
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,300
Oh, nothing does my, nothing really inverts my nipples.

1811
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,300
Like being falsely accused of being impulsive.

1812
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,300
I don't trust Rhea, but still.

1813
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:11,300
Like, it literally, oh my god, it doesn't mean so much.

1814
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:16,300
So I was actually going to do, I'm just going to trust that everyone else goes and does that.

1815
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,300
Because I think everyone's quite altruistic in the team.

1816
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:25,300
So I'm going to just focus on getting the task done like ASAP so I can get the,

1817
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,300
and before we run out of oxygen because of my lack of judgement.

1818
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,300
She's pretending! She's pretending to do it!

1819
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,300
Is no one doing oxygen or whatever the task is?

1820
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,300
I was trying to do oxygen!

1821
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,300
How come no one's doing the freakin' challenge, you guys?

1822
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,300
Why don't no one do the other one?

1823
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,300
What? Are you shitting me?

1824
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,300
What? Are you okay?

1825
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,300
Reed, are you literate?

1826
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,300
What are you doing?

1827
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,300
Hello?

1828
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,300
Are you okay?

1829
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,300
Are you?

1830
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,300
Dude.

1831
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,300
Legally, being legally blind is a skill issue.

1832
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,300
Yeah, sabotage. You're supposed to fix it.

1833
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,300
Dude, that was good.

1834
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,300
Not as skill as you.

1835
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,300
I just assumed everyone else was going to do it and I can't work in to be honest.

1836
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,300
Keep yourself safe!

1837
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,300
I sabotaged nothing.

1838
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,300
I thought you were pretending to do it.

1839
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,300
Wait, we don't have our 8th! We don't have our 8th!

1840
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,300
Are we all here?

1841
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,300
Are we good?

1842
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,300
Yeah, we're here now.

1843
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,300
We got our 8th.

1844
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,300
Oh my god.

1845
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,300
Alright, that scared me. Sorry.

1846
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,300
All of it here.

1847
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,300
I don't want to be a monster anymore.

1848
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,300
Bro, please! I want to be a monster!

1849
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,300
Dude, I've been a monster like what five times already is crazy.

1850
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,300
Tell me about it.

1851
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,300
Where do you go?

1852
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,300
Oh, Midway.

1853
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:00,300
Okay, Rhea now has a plausible motive because

1854
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,300
she corrected her course.

1855
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,300
So, perhaps not too sassy for Latuvia.

1856
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,300
That worked you.

1857
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,300
You were about to vent.

1858
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,300
Swear to god.

1859
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,300
I have a scan.

1860
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,300
I have a scan. Who wants to watch me do a scan?

1861
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,300
Watch you do a scan, Rhea.

1862
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,300
Yeah, I have.

1863
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,300
Who wants to watch me do a scan?

1864
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,300
You have to.

1865
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,300
Who wants to watch the scan?

1866
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,300
I don't want to get the power.

1867
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,300
Anyone want to watch a scan?

1868
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,300
Only three people.

1869
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,300
I'm doing security then.

1870
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,300
I don't want to be mercy.

1871
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,300
I don't want to be any kind.

1872
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,300
I haven't seen Mercy.

1873
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,300
I don't know if anyone's got eyes on Mercy.

1874
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,300
The serial killer of Viola.

1875
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,300
Maybe she died.

1876
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,300
I actually don't see her.

1877
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,300
I've not seen her.

1878
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,300
Okay, there's five of us. It's fine.

1879
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,300
There's five of us. It's fine.

1880
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,300
I'm scanning.

1881
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,300
Is she scanning?

1882
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,300
Okay.

1883
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,300
Mercy just kills her.

1884
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,300
She just kills her.

1885
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,300
She just kills her.

1886
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,300
Rhea, wait.

1887
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,300
Hold on.

1888
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,300
Rhea, why did you walk right past that?

1889
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,300
Because I was coming out of the scan.

1890
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
I was coming out of the scan.

1891
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:19,300
No, no, no. Rhea's fine.

1892
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:21,300
I watched your scan.

1893
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,300
I watched Mercy kill.

1894
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,300
After we all came out of bed.

1895
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
I was on the scan.

1896
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,300
I was on the scan.

1897
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,300
I saw Azura coming out of the scan.

1898
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,300
I killed Strawny.

1899
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,300
She made kills.

1900
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,300
Why would you do that?

1901
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,300
She just made kills.

1902
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,300
Where did you find Rhea?

1903
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,300
She was in Med Bake.

1904
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,300
I watched her do a scan.

1905
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,300
With Strawny.

1906
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,300
And then Mercy kills.

1907
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,300
It's not Azura. I'm just vouching for her.

1908
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,300
I saw Azura walk in that direction.

1909
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,300
I'm gonna ask her whatever it's called.

1910
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,300
It's the navigation. I think she's fine.

1911
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,300
Think...

1912
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,300
It's Mercy.

1913
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,300
I'm gonna be really upset because I-

1914
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,300
Why did you report her body?

1915
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,300
You walked right past it Mercy.

1916
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,300
I did it.

1917
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,300
Mercy you're terrible.

1918
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,300
It's Mimosa and Mercy.

1919
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:27,000
I don't know. I think it's you

1920
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,140
in the body. I was I was the

1921
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,480
one who reported it. I wasn't

1922
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,620
there. Yeah. No, Mamosa's fine.

1923
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,640
Mamosa's fine. I did it. I

1924
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,720
did it. I did it. I did it.

1925
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:44,920
I did it. I ran to Mamosa in

1926
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:48,360
fear. Yeah, you vote for

1927
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,960
how does it fatal mating

1928
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:56,640
girly Pop that's why she's

1929
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,380
Nothing's is going on. We

1930
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:08,440
don't have to worry about a

1931
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:15,120
Are you sure I mean you were

1932
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,620
forgive you because you didn'

1933
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,620
your collaboration.

1934
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,620
Your collaboration to figure it out is Rhea.

1935
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:26,620
Rhea is a you.

1936
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,620
No, but I skinned.

1937
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,620
Your pitch raised a little bit when you said that.

1938
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,620
If I was lying, my pitch wouldn't change.

1939
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,620
And she'd be watching me skin.

1940
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,620
Yeah, Rhea is fine.

1941
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,620
Rhea is cool.

1942
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:44,620
I mean, Red Bay, um,

1943
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:54,620
I have no idea who the other person is, I'm not skilled enough to know, but I'm glad everyone's enjoying my gameplay.

1944
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,620
Yeah, I'm sorry to say I haven't sabotaged.

1945
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,620
She's focused, she's locked in.

1946
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:10,620
It's not me, I promise. I'm just sussing you out a little bit.

1947
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,620
I don't know.

1948
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,620
Hopefully.

1949
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,620
Listen, it's one of the joes, it's Mercy Rosa, I bet.

1950
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:18,620
One of the joes.

1951
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,620
Mercy, go call and just retake me.

1952
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:22,620
Mita!

1953
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,620
It's not me!

1954
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,620
It's just one of the joes.

1955
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,620
Wait, is it rain?

1956
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,620
No, it's not.

1957
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:36,620
Oh my god, no, it's not.

1958
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:38,620
Alright, go on.

1959
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,620
Shibi, it's not.

1960
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,620
Do it, do it, do it.

1961
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,620
It's not me, it's not me.

1962
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,620
It's Imi, she's gonna do it.

1963
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,620
It's not!

1964
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,620
Wait, what if you do it in the other person's report?

1965
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,620
Fine, go do it rain, go on.

1966
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,620
No, you do it, you do it, it's you.

1967
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,620
I can't kill other people's stuff.

1968
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:58,620
Go on then, show what you mean.

1969
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,620
I'm gonna check on Azera and Rhea then.

1970
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,620
Oh my god.

1971
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,620
Oh my god.

1972
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,620
I've been on fuck.

1973
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,620
Just meant to kill someone.

1974
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,620
No, look, it's Azera or Rhea.

1975
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:16,620
Look, the three of us will stick together, promise.

1976
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,620
Where's Azera?

1977
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,620
That's what I'm saying.

1978
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,620
Oh, I gotta go back to Midnight, just FYI.

1979
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,620
What?

1980
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,620
Whispering to yourself, Azera.

1981
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,620
Yeah, yeah.

1982
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,620
See it?

1983
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:32,620
No way.

1984
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,620
Why were you whispering?

1985
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,620
You sounded weird.

1986
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:38,620
You said, where did she go?

1987
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,620
Where did she go?

1988
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,620
That's what I said.

1989
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,620
I asked Rhea, where did she go?

1990
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,620
Amy, are we killing?

1991
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,620
Or did she actually go, it might be like...

1992
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,620
No.

1993
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,620
No.

1994
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,620
Oh, I don't need that.

1995
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,620
Hi, Mims.

1996
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,620
We're not talking?

1997
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,620
We're not talking?

1998
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,620
I don't know about that.

1999
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,620
I just don't know about that.

2000
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,620
I don't know, I don't know.

2001
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,620
I haven't checked Electrical in a while.

2002
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,620
Maybe somebody died.

2003
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:16,620
Maybe somebody died in Electrical.

2004
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,620
Let me check it out.

2005
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,620
Honestly, Momosa's pretty smart, though.

2006
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,620
If anything, you're probably gonna die in there.

2007
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,620
No, dude, can somebody fucking kill somebody damn?

2008
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,620
If it's you, Azera.

2009
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,620
It's ending.

2010
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,620
Probably Mims, I don't know.

2011
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,620
I'm just accusing everyone.

2012
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:34,620
It's a double take, but then she realized somebody was nearby.

2013
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,620
Hmm.

2014
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,620
You could tell somebody this information.

2015
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:40,620
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something.

2016
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,620
In case I die.

2017
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,620
No.

2018
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,620
It might be Momosa, because she did a double take,

2019
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,620
but then she saw Rhea was nearby.

2020
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:50,620
Oh, my God.

2021
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,620
It's Amy.

2022
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,620
It's Amy.

2023
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,620
Yes, Amy.

2024
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,620
Oh, my God.

2025
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,620
Oh, my God.

2026
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,620
Okay, well, it's not Momosa.

2027
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,620
I just have an act for these sort of things.

2028
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,620
What can I say?

2029
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,620
Because she didn't accuse me even though I was seen on the TV.

2030
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,620
Oh, no.

2031
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,620
Rain was with me.

2032
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,620
Rain was with me.

2033
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,620
Yeah, I was with everyone.

2034
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,620
Rain over to Rain to tell her that I thought it was Momosa.

2035
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,620
It's not.

2036
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:22,620
Because she's dead.

2037
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

2038
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

2039
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

2040
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,620
I didn't see her.

2041
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,620
I didn't see her killer though.

2042
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,620
Listen, if it's not Amy, it's Rhea.

2043
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,620
Trust me.

2044
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,620
No, it's not Rhea.

2045
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,620
I saw her do a body scan.

2046
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,620
But she's the one that she might not have killed that round.

2047
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,620
Sorry, Amy.

2048
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,620
It wasn't Rain.

2049
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,620
It wasn't Rain.

2050
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,620
She accused me.

2051
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,620
Stop killing me.

2052
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:54,620
Oh, no.

2053
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,620
Oh, my God.

2054
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:58,620
Wait a second.

2055
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,620
It's not me.

2056
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,620
Are you sure?

2057
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,620
Are you sure?

2058
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,620
Listen, I can't believe it's not me.

2059
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,620
I can't believe it's not me.

2060
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,620
Rhea, we're the only ones we can trust.

2061
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,620
We have to figure out

2062
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:14,620
if it's Azura or Rain.

2063
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,620
I think it's Rhea.

2064
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,620
It's not Rhea.

2065
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,620
What does Rain not understand about medbay scan?

2066
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,620
What does she not understand?

2067
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,620
It's not me.

2068
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,620
It's not me.

2069
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:28,620
It's not me.

2070
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:30,620
No, but that was just the first time.

2071
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,620
Old people should not be a lot of play among us.

2072
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,620
Rhea, we need to

2073
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,620
in the shoot room.

2074
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,620
We have to be good on this.

2075
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,620
We need to think about our steps.

2076
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:42,620
Okay.

2077
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,620
What if it's Sheebie?

2078
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,620
Because Rhea said that Sheebie never scanned.

2079
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,620
So I didn't have a scan.

2080
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,620
Sheebie could be...

2081
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,620
How are we going to know that?

2082
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,620
Sheebie could be

2083
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,620
marinating Rhea.

2084
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,620
Yes, it's a smelly smell.

2085
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,620
Okay, okay.

2086
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,620
Rhea, I've been nothing but defend you.

2087
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,620
I'm the most.

2088
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,620
Each one of you.

2089
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,620
It was with Rain.

2090
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:10,620
You were at admin.

2091
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,620
Sheebie had like five opportunities to kill me

2092
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,620
and she never did.

2093
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,620
Unless she's trying to gaslight.

2094
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,620
Yes, because if we got rid of one

2095
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:20,620
and my B is gaslighting you

2096
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:22,620
because if Mercy was the imposter

2097
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,620
and it's only one

2098
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:26,620
imposter left.

2099
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,620
You think me and Mercy are going to be imposter together

2100
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,620
three times in a row?

2101
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:32,620
Yeah.

2102
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,620
Shroney was literally imposter like four times in a row.

2103
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,620
I wouldn't believe it.

2104
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,620
Rhea, you have to...

2105
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,620
I have to vote as Rhea.

2106
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,620
No, it's not me.

2107
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,620
Who do you want to vote for?

2108
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,620
I will vote for whoever you want to vote for.

2109
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,620
It's over.

2110
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,620
Alright, love, just vote me off and win.

2111
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:52,620
Is that what you want? I'm not the imposter.

2112
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,620
Okay, I'm going to vote for Rhea because

2113
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,620
Rain always points to you even when she's not.

2114
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,620
Oh, thank god.

2115
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,620
Yippee!

2116
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,620
Yeah?

2117
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:04,620
I'm sorry, is there if it wasn't you, I apologize.

2118
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,620
Yippee!

2119
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,620
Yes!

2120
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,620
Yes, yes!

2121
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,620
Easy, easy.

2122
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,620
You did it. I told you.

2123
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:16,620
I'm sorry, is there a...

2124
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,620
I should have let you win, damn.

2125
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,620
Bouched for you.

2126
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,620
Yeah, I had your back.

2127
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:24,620
Don't forget that.

2128
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,620
Man, is there a... I'm so sorry.

2129
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,620
Where's my story, Rain?

2130
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,620
You keep accusing me of doing anything.

2131
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,620
Okay.

2132
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,620
Listen, once you're out of the game,

2133
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,620
I can...

2134
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,620
I'm sorry.

2135
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,620
I'm back. I'll just stop playing the game.

2136
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,620
I was getting nervous because I didn't know how to defend myself.

2137
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,620
I was running around the map, which is crazy.

2138
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:46,620
I'm just teasing, I'm sorry.

2139
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,620
I'm sorry.

2140
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:50,620
I'm not sorry.

2141
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,620
I'm not sorry because you were so sorry.

2142
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,620
Where's your back from pissing?

2143
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,620
Yeah, sorry, I...

2144
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,620
The piss girl.

2145
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,620
The piss.

2146
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,620
You'll see all by yourself.

2147
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,620
I'll find we've been imposter at least once now.

2148
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,620
I'm gonna stop pissing.

2149
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:10,620
Well, at least Azura got to be imposter.

2150
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,620
Yeah, one time.

2151
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,620
Well, maybe you're imposter again.

2152
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,620
Right now.

2153
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:18,620
I need the coconut prattle and that...

2154
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:20,620
Oh!

2155
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:22,620
Mercy DC?

2156
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Mercy? Why did Mercy leave?

2157
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,620
I don't know. I don't know if we're gonna reset.

2158
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,620
Hold on, I'm going in the middle.

2159
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,620
Okay.

2160
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,620
Hang out with you.

2161
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:34,620
Should I just call a meeting?

2162
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2163
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,620
Oh, what?

2164
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,620
What happened?

2165
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,620
Mercy left, so we're just concerned.

2166
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,620
Oh, okay.

2167
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,620
Is her internet down?

2168
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,620
She didn't die. We didn't know what happened with her internet.

2169
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,620
Oh, she just got disconnected.

2170
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,620
Oh, yeah.

2171
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,620
Rain.

2172
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,620
Is it rain?

2173
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,620
It's not me. It's not, guys.

2174
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,620
I know, but it's getting her back in.

2175
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,620
Oh, okay.

2176
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,620
Alright, it's...

2177
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,620
Imposters come forward.

2178
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,620
Oh, my God.

2179
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,620
Wait, who is it? Rain or Reo?

2180
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,620
It was Imi?

2181
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,620
Yeah, Imi and Azura.

2182
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,620
Imi and Azura?

2183
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,620
Oh, I fucking knew Azura got it twice in a row.

2184
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,620
Oh, you called it.

2185
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,620
I feel bad for her.

2186
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,620
The way that she said how she denied it, how she was like,

2187
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,620
yeah, imagine.

2188
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,620
I was like...

2189
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,620
We heard that flick during your voice.

2190
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,620
Yup, yup, yup.

2191
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:38,620
Wait for me.

2192
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,620
Ready to stand on the side of the table?

2193
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,620
Alright, I'll press the button.

2194
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:44,620
I like pressing buttons.

2195
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:46,620
Press the button, girl.

2196
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,620
Two more, and then we will...

2197
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,620
We will call it.

2198
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,620
Yay!

2199
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,620
It's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other

2200
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,620
and never talking again.

2201
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:58,620
I know, it's so cute.

2202
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:00,620
Wait, is Azura calling me?

2203
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,620
Azura, what do you have to say for yourself?

2204
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:06,620
Is that your mic?

2205
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,620
Is that someone's mic or something?

2206
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,620
That sounds like popcorn.

2207
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,620
I was muted for a second.

2208
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:14,620
Yeah, it sounds like popcorn.

2209
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:18,620
Is that me?

2210
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,620
Wait, you guys hear that? No, I hear that.

2211
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,620
You guys hear that?

2212
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:24,620
Something's crunchy.

2213
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:26,620
Who's kissing?

2214
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,620
Who's frying some chicken?

2215
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:30,620
Is it me?

2216
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,620
Someone's frying...

2217
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,620
I don't know.

2218
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:36,620
I hear static.

2219
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:38,620
I'm going to turn my voice chat dial down.

2220
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,620
I still hear it.

2221
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:42,620
Okay, let me turn my dial down.

2222
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,620
Hershey's back!

2223
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,620
Yippee!

2224
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,620
Yippee!

2225
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:50,620
Definitely not me, it's not me.

2226
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,620
Is that a game?

2227
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,620
Pretty cool.

2228
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:56,620
Wait, we can only one at a time.

2229
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,620
I'm going to mute right now, hold on.

2230
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,620
No, you can still hear it.

2231
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:04,620
Okay, it's not me then.

2232
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,620
Someone's talking to me, alright.

2233
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:08,620
Someone in the middle, come to the edge if it's not...

2234
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,620
If you don't...

2235
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:12,620
I'm going to mute, hang on.

2236
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,620
Wait, if you hear it all...

2237
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,620
It's gone, it's gone.

2238
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,620
I didn't mute.

2239
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,620
We're getting a guy...

2240
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:22,620
Who's got a Geiger counter for radiation?

2241
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,620
I know, seriously.

2242
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,620
Are we ready?

2243
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,620
Are we ready?

2244
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,620
I'm ready.

2245
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,620
I'm in a voucher, I want you to be a voucher.

2246
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,620
They're gone?

2247
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,620
Okay, thank you.

2248
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,620
I believe in other ways.

2249
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:40,620
All your problems might be me.

2250
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,620
It's fine.

2251
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:44,620
I would like for Mimosa to be a voucher.

2252
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,620
Second last game, baby!

2253
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,620
Make it carry.

2254
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,620
This is the last game?

2255
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,620
Second last game.

2256
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,620
And then we call plain because we're the winners.

2257
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,620
Gorge?

2258
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:58,620
For a girl's 50th grade.

2259
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:00,620
Sixth?

2260
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,620
Sixth, the wiring.

2261
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,620
The ones that are like the double ones

2262
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:10,620
where you have to go to a second location

2263
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,620
are the ones that like trip you up the most.

2264
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,620
Like in terms of like

2265
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,620
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2266
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,620
That's sick.

2267
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,620
Two or what is going on in here?

2268
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,620
Absolutely nothing.

2269
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,620
Sacrifice material.

2270
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,620
Oh no, there's an imposter coming my way.

2271
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,620
Sure would be a shame if you

2272
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:34,620
absolutely callywacked me for one.

2273
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:36,620
Where the heck is everyone?

2274
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,620
This is like the main room.

2275
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,620
I don't like this one but I've got a med beta.

2276
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,620
Inspect sample.

2277
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,620
Lovely.

2278
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:46,620
Whoa!

2279
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,620
Hold on, let me put my sample on first.

2280
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,620
Let me put my sample on first and then I'll

2281
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:52,620
then I'll do it.

2282
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,620
Okay, report.

2283
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,620
Hey Mercy!

2284
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,620
Self report, self report.

2285
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,620
Okay, it's not Shebi or Rea.

2286
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:06,620
Mercy's dead on the med base scanning pad.

2287
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:10,620
Oh.

2288
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:12,620
I wasn't near med bay, I was all around the perimeter.

2289
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,620
I saw me doing the leaves.

2290
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:16,620
Rain and I.

2291
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:18,620
And I was on cams.

2292
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:20,620
Who was on cams?

2293
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,620
Wait, sorry.

2294
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,620
Hold on, hold on.

2295
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:28,620
Who just said scrawny, scrawny, scrawny three times?

2296
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,620
Say it one more time for me.

2297
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:32,620
Is it Azura's mic?

2298
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:34,620
Yeah, it's Azura, yeah.

2299
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,620
Who said scrawny three times in a row?

2300
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,620
Do it again.

2301
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,620
I dare you.

2302
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:42,620
Strawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny,

2303
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,620
scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.

2304
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:46,620
Self report, self report, self report.

2305
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:48,620
It's a self report!

2306
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,620
You are fired!

2307
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,620
Let her here!

2308
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,620
Let her, let Ramosa talk.

2309
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,620
Ramosa, where were you?

2310
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:58,620
It's a self report.

2311
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,620
Rain and Rea were together.

2312
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,620
Shebi, Rain, Rea were together.

2313
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:04,620
I don't know who to pick.

2314
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

2315
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:08,620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

2316
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

2317
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,620
It's scrawny and Azura.

2318
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:14,620
I will make you sweat later tonight.

2319
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,620
We'll talk about it later.

2320
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,620
I think it's scrawny and Ramosa.

2321
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,620
Oh no!

2322
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,620
I will let you sweat later tonight.

2323
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:24,620
I don't have anything to say.

2324
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,620
Goodbye.

2325
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:28,620
I'm done, baby.

2326
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,620
You didn't hear that too?

2327
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,620
Is it me?

2328
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,620
No, my turn.

2329
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:36,620
The person who reported the dead body.

2330
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,620
Yeah, Ramosa.

2331
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:40,620
Bye.

2332
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,620
Open your mouth!

2333
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:44,620
Your coochie smells like trash!

2334
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,620
Oh shit!

2335
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,620
It's scrawny!

2336
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:50,620
It's not me! She fucking voted me!

2337
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:52,620
So I thought she was sus.

2338
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,620
Dude!

2339
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:56,620
It's literally not me. She fucking voted me.

2340
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:58,620
Shebi then. Fuck you.

2341
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,620
What the fuck? Why would she so aggrieved?

2342
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,620
Wait, no. I'm not being funny.

2343
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,620
Everyone's actually ganging up on me.

2344
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,620
Because they can't even believe for a second

2345
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:08,620
that I might be a wee bit nice in this game.

2346
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:10,620
Like, so they just instantly get...

2347
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,620
Oh, it's a self-report. It's a self-report.

2348
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:14,620
Oh, go get to fuck, man.

2349
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,620
Go get to fuck, man.

2350
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:18,620
It's a self-report.

2351
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:27,620
It's a self-report.

2352
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,620
I'm sorry. I couldn't...

2353
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,620
I just kept hearing...

2354
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:40,620
I just kept hearing Mercy's ghost.

2355
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:42,620
I know, I heard it, too.

2356
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:53,620
it too because I knew if I voted I feel like I would have tied it

2357
01:47:53,620 --> 01:48:03,000
you did the same thing to me

2358
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:22,440
listen to people I was about to like say food I was like

2359
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:32,080
it's not about story being nice or not it's about me being dangerous which has

2360
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:39,640
been proven in previous rounds so now none of you you scare me yeah it's true

2361
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:43,400
and every time every time we start you always say that it's probably always

2362
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,520
gonna be someone or you say that we're gonna be someone or you say that we're

2363
01:48:45,520 --> 01:49:14,280
I don't even know if they're gonna believe that I'm just I'm gonna fuck up the game

2364
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,720
they're gonna blame me for everything whenever I'm crewmate I'm just gonna fuck

2365
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,420
up the last game and they're gonna have to play low-main games with me and I'm

2366
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:38,480
gonna claim that I am a naughty naughty boy okay this is just my task I did it

2367
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:53,600
up to them to fucking figure out excuse me every round well no it's not I was

2368
01:49:53,600 --> 01:50:03,920

2369
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,120

2370
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,440
mims and

2371
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,440
Is that the two of you?

2372
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:19,440
I mean, it's not me, I was trying to find my toss.

2373
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,440
Yeah, it's right, I believe.

2374
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,440
It's right.

2375
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:28,440
As soon as it's her, as soon as she blames me, I know it's right.

2376
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:29,440
I know it's right.

2377
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,440
Dude.

2378
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:34,440
She always blames me and I haven't done anything.

2379
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:39,440
Dude, what the three?

2380
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,440
No.

2381
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,440
Hold on, hold on.

2382
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,440
Her accent.

2383
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,440
Yes!

2384
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:47,440
Wait, what's the dealio?

2385
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,440
So Mamosa found the body wear.

2386
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,440
We found side of reactor.

2387
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,440
It was two of them.

2388
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,440
Side of reactor.

2389
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,440
I was with menzen.

2390
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,440
I was with menzen.

2391
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,440
Rea and Mamosa.

2392
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,440
Rean, sorry.

2393
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,440
I was bouncing for menzen.

2394
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:01,440
Wait, I was bouncing for menzen.

2395
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,440
I don't know why she's slipping.

2396
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,440
I'm not bouncing for rain.

2397
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:07,440
I'm not bouncing for rain because I didn't see.

2398
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,440
I don't know.

2399
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,440
I was just swiping a card.

2400
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,440
Yeah, to be honest.

2401
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,440
And I told you guys to go worry about that.

2402
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,440
Is it Rean and Mamosa?

2403
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,440
Whatever, man.

2404
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,440
Was it Pinkerton?

2405
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,440
Yeah, it's me.

2406
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,440
Vote me.

2407
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,440
Yeah.

2408
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2409
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,440
Yeah, it's Rean's being too quiet.

2410
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,440
Rean's being too quiet.

2411
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,440
Thanks for voting me.

2412
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,440
You're welcome.

2413
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,440
It was very kind of you to think about me.

2414
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,440
The other one is obviously Strani.

2415
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:37,440
What did I tell you?

2416
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:40,440
What did I tell you?

2417
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:41,440
Strani killed me.

2418
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,440
Yeah.

2419
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2420
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,440
No, I think Strani.

2421
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,440
Open your mouth.

2422
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,440
I'm Strani.

2423
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,440
I have to do a bad bay.

2424
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,440
I have to do a scan, Strani.

2425
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,440
Are you doing scan?

2426
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,440
Go watch.

2427
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,440
I'm doing fucking 60 seconds.

2428
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,440
Countdown, spot the difference.

2429
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,440
Oh my God, look at that.

2430
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:56,440
Oh my God.

2431
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:59,440
Oh my God, you're like, you're doing your thing.

2432
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,440
Huh?

2433
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,440
Well.

2434
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,440
Well, it's not us anyway.

2435
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:05,440
Oh yeah, it's not me and Strani.

2436
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,440
We're busy there.

2437
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,440
What's going on, guys?

2438
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:09,440
You already know my card swipe.

2439
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,440
Mama's on my fifth try.

2440
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,440
Come on.

2441
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,440
No, that's true.

2442
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:17,440
Because before Rea, was it Rea or Shibi was trying to...

2443
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,440
Well, it's between Amy and Momosa.

2444
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,440
I already did my card swipe.

2445
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,440
It's between Amy and Momosa.

2446
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:25,440
Yeah, because me and Strani were hanging out in Med Bay.

2447
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,440
I believe Rea's claim on the fifth card swipe.

2448
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,440
Momosa, what are you...

2449
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,440
Yeah, Rea is...

2450
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,440
Momosa, say your piece.

2451
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,440
No.

2452
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,440
Goodbye.

2453
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,440
See you later, ma'ams.

2454
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,440
I don't...

2455
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,440
I know who it is.

2456
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,440
You will rue this day.

2457
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:43,440
I don't...

2458
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,440
Oh, I don't know who to vote for.

2459
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,440
I'm with Strani.

2460
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,440
Okay, yeah.

2461
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,440
I was with Strani in Med Bay.

2462
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:52,440
It's Momosa then, because literally Shibi and Shibi have been touching each other all game.

2463
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,440
Goodbye.

2464
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,440
Yeah, we were touching Rea in Med Bay.

2465
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:59,440
She was doing a full body scan of my delicious bod.

2466
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,440
Not Momosa.

2467
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,440
What?

2468
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,440
Momosa!

2469
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,440
Why would you ban them like me then?

2470
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,440
Momosa!

2471
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,440
Momosa!

2472
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,440
Momosa!

2473
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,440
Wait, when I was...

2474
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,440
Momosa!

2475
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,440
Wait, when I was with Momosa, she could have killed me at any time.

2476
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,440
And it could have been like...

2477
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,440
Well, now we can't hit them.

2478
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,440
Well, now we can't hit them.

2479
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:22,440
Rea, because she just stood still and activated the fucking thing.

2480
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:24,440
Aw.

2481
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,440
Yes!

2482
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:28,440
You scared me!

2483
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,440
Okay.

2484
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,440
Wait, what?

2485
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,440
I'm so confused.

2486
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:40,440
Wait, can you activate sabotage's whilst on the move?

2487
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,440
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?

2488
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,440
I don't know.

2489
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,440
I honestly don't know.

2490
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,440
If you can activate sabotage's while moving.

2491
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,440
I feel like...

2492
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:58,440
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?

2493
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:01,440
That sabotage came on while Rea wasn't moving.

2494
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,440
Aw, are you serious?

2495
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,440
What the fuck?

2496
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,440
Wait, wait.

2497
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,440
No!

2498
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,440
I was only about to hit the button!

2499
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,440
Is it aim?

2500
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,440
Wait, what?

2501
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:15,440
I'm gonna hide and trigger the button if you want to do the lights.

2502
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,440
Please do the lights.

2503
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,440
They killed a mother with a baby.

2504
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,440
Did somebody leave?

2505
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,440
I actually pulled a clutch that's actually crazy.

2506
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,440
I'm so proud of her, oh my god.

2507
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,440
Wait, what happened?

2508
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,440
Wait, what happened to everyone?

2509
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,440
You guys don't clear the sabotage.

2510
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,440
No one ever clears the sabotage.

2511
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,440
Oh, it's the lights!

2512
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,440
It's the lights, so if you don't fix it...

2513
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,440
Dude, no, not the lights.

2514
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:45,440

2553
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,440
I didn't even clear the tasks,

2554
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
so I just looked at the bar.

2555
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,440
I was so close to...

2556
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:53,920
the other imposter was it was the other imposter it was rain oh it was rain okay she pulled a

2557
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,280
stretch she pulled a classic remedy

2558
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:05,040
gonna be honest actually kind of wish i was imposter uh yeah it's a little tip but you know

2559
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,600
how to say like one more for luck uh in the behind the scenes are like lord of the rings in the

2560
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,680
whenever he like does the scene like it obviously is the director and the actors

2561
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:23,200
you need multiple renditions of the scene to be recorded out um and one and he always goes one

2562
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:29,440
more for luck one more for luck which is him asking the actor to give one more scene even though

2563
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:37,920
oh my god oh my god mercy killed mercy killed rain i saw mercy killed rain mercy killed rain

2581
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:41,360
i mean azura i think it's marriage your voice telling her story i think it's a bit shaky

01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:47,760
she was because i am yeah i'm streaming for well go ahead you can kill me watch me watch watch

2583

2584
01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:02,880
oh no i had a feeling i told you my gut doesn't lie it's all right all right all right

most of us did quiet amy hardly said a peep and real's just being her cute quiet self all the time

2586
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:17,120
it's so fucking hard it's hard when they don't give like clear info or that so azura said it was

2587
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:23,360
what wait azura claimed she watched mersey kill her which is obviously never lie so it's so it's

2588
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:32,400
azura azura claimed she saw mersey kill that person well let's kill that man but we now know

2589
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:39,280
that's a lie so it is azura you don't think it's azura wait but didn't she not claim she killed her

2590
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:51,280
did azura claim that she saw mersey kill her i was stepped through the heart i should have voted

2591
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:58,640
for it but even if i voted for azura it would have been a tie i had a feeling that was super fun

2592
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:05,120
that was good that was a good ending i'm now satisfied i'm now satisfied she's happy everybody

2621
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:48,000
oh my god i hate this um yeah other than the audio issues someone said that a zura for some

2622
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:56,080
reason couldn't hear me even though i'm loud in scots like um me got a awful thought honestly i

2623
02:03:56,080 --> 02:04:05,600
me any time it's not any i i me like that uh got hit with a scots rage i don't think you guys

2624
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:13,680
know i was capable of that but i warned you i warned you and and everyone climbing for one more game

2625
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:18,880
means you can be confident that they had a lot of fun good i'm glad that was so fun and it was like

2626
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,920
i actually felt a bit nervous like starting up but i feel so comfortable with the yumi plus girls

2627
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,640
like they just i don't know all of us seem to be on the same page like we were all in a group

2628
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:34,400
called one hour before figuring it out and like i started doing like a veal or meeting like kind

2629
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,320
of recapping on some stuff and i'm like oh you guys couldn't listen in as well like it's just a

2630
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:44,400
few notes so i was like oh everyone's reached 5000 subscribers so we've got an artwork to celebrate

2631
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:54,080
post and all that um it was hilarious yeah i'm ready for uh the after game stress relief honestly

2632
02:04:54,080 --> 02:05:01,120
scrawny rage was that rage in that badly i kind of remember i think my rage is basically me going

2633
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:07,680
uh so the other person stops talking so i can say my piece i think that's what my rage is hopefully

2634
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:15,280
it's not too bad uh might have been taking the piss a little bit the whole stream was great yeah

2635
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:22,080
you like that i'm so glad the only you only rage on someone accuses you and you're innocent

2636
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:27,760
oh it annoys me like it was funny don't get me wrong it was so funny but as soon as they go it's

2637
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:33,840
scrawny and i'm like i literally have not done a single thing like i haven't spoken i haven't

2638
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:40,000
claimed anything oh it's scrawny i'm like okay just because the scottish person is like get at the

2639
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:48,400
game like come on i do i have to admit my favorite thing was the double kills um when like there was

2640
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:54,560
four of us but two of them posture going three two one oh it was so satisfying and one oh one

2641
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:59,520
and one of the kills rea was so slow to respond she probably could have reported the body in time

2642
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:08,880
um but she was so slow that she got yoinked um oh honestly on the mention of five came

2643
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,680
Paul of scrawny is getting forceful because you aren't eating your tomato

2644
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:24,720
uh scrawny you're too good at the game it's actually i'm aware there's another map um i'm not

2645
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:32,880
really familiar with it at all um and i have spelt modus terribly wrong in the second description

2646
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:41,920
of that um the serotonin from the double kills oh my god it was so sat satisfying especially

2647
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:48,880
with the close proximity just like oh hi and then like i just go three two one and they're both gone

2648
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:54,880
oh and we just like split in different ways oh and that one game i can't me and mary say

2649
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:01,200
didn't even get the round to voting because we had killed so perfectly at different sides of the map

2650
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:07,600
oh he's so good literally can you handle it oh it's so can you handle it

2651
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:11,840
this is so unbelievably good i'm gonna see if there's someone we can read i write it

2652
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,920
oh would you look at that the whole yumi plus is on

2653
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:21,040
