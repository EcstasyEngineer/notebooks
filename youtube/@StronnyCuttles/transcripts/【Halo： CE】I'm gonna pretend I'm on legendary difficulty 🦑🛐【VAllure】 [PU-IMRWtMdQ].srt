1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
isations

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,600
mode

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,200
more

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,160
more

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm gonna add a pyramid thingy.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Bob Ma!

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Oh god!

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,160
I've got something to show you!

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Bye bye.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
That's pretty.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,160
She hates the intro street.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
I mean...

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
I hate it.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Momma!

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon!

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,160
You know how I said I'm a rather quite a lucky person?

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,160
I accidentally became the first video on Acapella Media's YouTube channel.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
This wasn't planned.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,160
None of this was like a behind the scenes ploy or anything like that.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I literally flapped my gums about the interview stage that we had with them,

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
because we had an interview with them.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,160
And then I accidentally became the first video on their channel.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
What?

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
What?

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
What?

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
The audios for Midsma were really cute.

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Did you guys see that?

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,160
If you didn't know, I just did a birthday call in with Midsma.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I've never done one before.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,160
So I didn't know what to do or what to expect.

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,160
But I just called upon the girls and I said,

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,160
darlings, if you can send me an audio, just a view saying happy birthday to Midsma.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,160
And if you've got a question for her, let me know because

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,160
I kind of assumed Midsma's been streaming for three days now.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I went out on a limb and said, she's probably exhausted

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
and she doesn't want to think anymore.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
And she doesn't want to have to kind of steer the conversation.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
So I was like, you know, I'm cracking my knuckles.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm right, right.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
I'll take over this.

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Don't you worry.

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Don't you worry.

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
I'll take this over.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,160
So I gave her those questions and I also gave her those audios.

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,160
And then I excused myself and it was a cute little view.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Vealer takes care of other content creators challenge.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
No, you know what it should be.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Vealer doesn't take care of other content creators challenge impossible.

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Sheebie was saying I was helping out

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,160
one of the girls, a girl that isn't mine behind the scenes.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
And, you know, I told Sheebie about the situation and she was like,

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
you actually can help yourself.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Can you?

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,160
And I'm like, no, I can't if someone needs help.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm like, here, this is what you do.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
This is how you can make it super simple.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
You just get straight to the point.

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Vealer colonize and other features.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
That's funny.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
That's terrible.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
But that's not the only thing I want to show you.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Because if you didn't notice the end of the week,

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,160
and what does it mean when it's the end of the week?

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Oh, sorry.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Sorry, hold on.

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Right, there we go.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I am collabing with

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Now, unfortunately,

70
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Dead by Daylight has a temporary

71
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
two killers versus

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
eight

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
survivors.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Now, I thought we could do a stream snip lobby.

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
This is how you say in French,

76
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
no fucking possible.

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
So it's not really going to work with that,

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
but I've got two hours with my beloved

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
sister.

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Then I'm doing a member's ASMR

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
where I'm doing a thousand kisses,

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
and I'm not allowed to speak

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
until I've done a thousand kisses,

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
because for those of you who don't know,

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
whenever I do a membership ASMR stream,

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I never ever actually do ASMR.

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I always end up starting yapping away

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
and ruining the experience.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
So as punishment, we're doing that.

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm doing a collab with

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
none other than Aysa Cole.

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
We're playing Escape Simulator.

93
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
She's a bit nervous, but I told her,

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
so she hasn't played it.

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
I have played it.

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,160
I told her, hey, don't you worry.

97
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I'll get you through it.

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Then you mind.

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Bleeding, refling Senpai.

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
That's so good.

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Just smashing them all together.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Thank you for the super chat.

103
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
How did I say the gear?

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I don't know.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
I don't know.

106
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
I can't remember.

107
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Is it Vegeta or Vegeta?

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Oh, I said, I can't even remember.

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
And I was like, oh, is that Goku?

110
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
And everyone was like, oh, my God.

111
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Shut up, Strony.

112
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
And I'm like, oh, no, no, no.

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Not Vegeta.

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
You said it wrong again.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Vegeta, that's how it's spelled.

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Okay.

117
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
The members watch along.

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Oh, you convinced me.

119
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
We're watching Hercules after Beauty and the Beast.

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Oh, I'm convinced.

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I was just, I had to.

123
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
That's the stream, which is,

124
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm going to be answering questions

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
that you are too afraid to ask.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Now, you can use my marshmallows to ask

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
some questions that you're too afraid to ask.

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
But I will have some pre-made questions as well

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
that we will be answering.

130
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Goku.

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Yeah, literally, that's how to say it.

132
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I love how you pronounce it.

133
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
It's pronounced like that.

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Turnip boy commits tax evasion.

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
This game, I have heard about it.

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I've heard whispers about it.

137
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
I've heard so much about the dang thing.

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
We're going to finally do it, okay?

139
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Now, I do love a bit of tax evasion.

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
That's terrible.

141
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I don't know where I was going with that.

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I was going to make a joke, but I'm not really

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
woken up yet.

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
So, yeah.

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Then we're going to finish.

146
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
We are officially going to get Old School Runes,

147
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
my first ever cape, okay?

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Implying there might be more.

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I don't know yet.

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
But right now, we are going to polish off

151
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,160
our little Old School Runescape series.

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
And then I am playing another collab.

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
So, I've got a collab with Sin Sister,

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
I've got a collab with Asakul,

155
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I've got a collab with Arissa.

156
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
We're going to be playing this really cute game

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
on Xbox Game Pass.

158
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
It's called Moving Out 2.

159
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
I've never played it.

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
It looks like one of those games

161
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
that you can just pick up really quickly.

162
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
So, I don't need to hunt around the internet

163
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
for how to play guide or anything like that.

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
So, you'll get to meet Arissa.

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,160
She is the fantastic brains and brawn

166
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,160
behind the shorts you see on my YouTube channel.

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
The first two shorts on my channel

168
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
are very clearly edited by me.

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,160
And then after that, nothing's done by me.

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Nothing.

171
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm going to turn down the audio.

172
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,160
70M audio.

173
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Unless it's just loud on my headset,

174
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I'm not sure.

175
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
But it is.

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
And then on Saturday,

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
our StreamSnipe game is vermin tight 2.

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Now, I am going to make a throwaway steam account.

179
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
So, we can play steam games together

180
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
where I add you.

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
And then at the end of stream,

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I will prove that I have removed absolutely everyone.

183
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,160
But I am going to boot up their vermin tight.

184
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I've not played it in a very, very long time.

185
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
The game music is really adding

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
to the intensity of the schedule reveal.

187
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Honestly.

188
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Love me some vermin tight.

189
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Oh, yeah.

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
It's Saturday.

191
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
What does that mean?

192
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Sounds like Rotterdam.

193
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
And vermin tight 2 with DLCs.

194
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I don't.

195
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I think just base game.

196
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't remember purchasing the DLCs many months ago.

197
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
But, yeah.

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Haven't played vermin tight in a while.

199
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Halo music, my beloved.

200
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,160
And then for celebrating 15,000 subscribers

201
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
on Strongly Cuts channel.

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Bum, bum, bum.

203
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
We are going to do a thigh,

204
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
cam,

205
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
ASMR stream.

206
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Everyone can access it.

207
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
So, don't you worry.

208
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,160
And then members writing stream for my gen mates.

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I...

210
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
So...

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Yeah.

212
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah.

213
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
We'll figure it out.

214
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I don't know if I'll go back to the one-on-one collabs or whatever.

215
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Celebration for 15k and your 200 subs off 20k.

216
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
No, I need to...

217
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Well, so the 20k celebration stream is 20k already?

218
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
No, no.

219
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I don't know if I'll go back to the channel.

220
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,160
That would have jumped like a stupendous amount in the middle of the night.

221
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
It says I've got 19,837.

222
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Yeah, I was going to say that would have been a big jump.

223
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Um...

224
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Yeah.

225
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Also, you guys are all in trouble for misleading me.

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I thought we were winning on Fortnite,

227
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,160
but we were against bots the whole time.

228
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I thought we were against real people.

229
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I thought I was just so excited.

230
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Stop!

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I like how Nani just crushed it until it kind of dawned on me.

232
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I literally...

233
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
You're discovering it only now.

234
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,160
So, at the end of the stream, I kind of figured it out.

235
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,160
But I started going apeshit on our first victory royale together.

236
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Because I was like, oh my god!

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
We did it, we did it.

238
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,160
And all of you were like, oh my god, she's so happy.

239
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Let's not ruin the fact that she's against bots.

240
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Um...

241
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
There were definitely some real people.

242
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Trust us, players feel real, literally.

243
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Um...

244
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
The Lego Lord of the Ring streams are going to go back up

245
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
once I am happy that I'm not going to get DMC'd

246
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
and the channel is going to be nuked into oblivion.

247
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
All of the bots for Lego Lord of the Rings got...

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Um...

249
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Got...

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Heavily copyrighted because of the campaign mode.

251
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,160
All the music is straight out from the movie franchise.

252
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
And I kid you not, I think OneVod has over 50 claims.

253
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
And I'm like, oh, that's enough to get your channel deleted.

254
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
So a private edit for now.

255
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
There were at least three real players in the game, honestly.

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Halo adds much dramatically.

257
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
When you love Lord of the Rings but doesn't love you back.

258
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I can't believe Peter Jackson literally hasn't given me the rights to the entire franchise.

259
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Like...

260
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Warner Brothers, step your game up.

261
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm waiting for the letter to say that I have a free ride on everything.

262
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
It's a lot of claims, like it's scary.

263
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Like, so my, like Assassin's Creed has a claim.

264
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
A few random games have a claim here and there.

265
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
They're like false.

266
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
They'll go away eventually, but yeah.

267
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,160
You're not telling me that bullet that hit my skull wasn't shot by a real person.

268
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
But yes, that is today's, today's.

269
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
That's the week schedule.

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Everything is on time, the usual time that I stream.

271
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Except for Escape Simulator with AC.

272
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Whenever I collab with a gen mate, I will pick their usual time slot.

273
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Just because I don't want to rock the boat.

274
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Rock the boat baby, rock the boat.

275
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
So I am two hours early with me and Icicle.

276
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,160
But I think since sister is fine with me doing my thing.

277
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Eryssa Nunesh is actually quite a lot later.

278
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
So we're going to get old school runescape.

279
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Apparently it's four hours of yapping and then we got, we get the cape.

280
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,160
And then I go offline for a chunk and then I come back online with Eryssa because Eryssa is Aussie.

281
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,160
But I couldn't be like, do you want to wake up at 4 a.m. with me?

282
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
No, I cannot fucking ask an Aussie to wake up at 4 a.m.

283
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
So yeah.

284
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yeah, Dead by Daily is like 6% off at the moment if anyone was thinking about getting it too.

285
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Yes, unfortunately there's no direct way to stream snipe.

286
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
It's just lobby luck.

287
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
But yeah.

288
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Thank you Dimpa Fish for the artwork.

289
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I love the big shells.

290
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Like I love the art style of like just I'm so kawaii-nee.

291
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Don't think I won't edit an ear cleaning tool in my hand and make that an ASMR thumbnail.

292
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Don't think I won't do it Eryssa because I'll do it.

293
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Yeah, Eryssa.

294
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Dimpa because I'll do it.

295
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Aren't you streaming at 2 a.m.?

296
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I stream at 4 a.m. my time.

297
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm streaming at 2 a.m. with Icicle.

298
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,160
But for any snowberries lurking in the shadows, I do have fantastic news for you.

299
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I recorded the missing folly sounds for a YouTube role play that's going to go up on A.C.'s channel.

300
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Now, depending on how much energy I have by the end of this stream, there may or may not be a little A.C.icle thing going on.

301
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I am communicating.

302
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,160
A.C. is hoping to have a few more shorts come up and common vermentide dove reel.

303
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Literally, what a stream snip game.

304
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Fucking vermentide of all of them.

305
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:01,160
But yes, for vermentide, I am going to make a throwaway steam account that we purposefully use for stream sniping things.

306
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,160
And at the end, just for anyone that has brain worms, please don't worry.

307
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I've got you in my back pocket.

308
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm thinking about you just as much as you're thinking about me.

309
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I was having a really tough time yesterday.

310
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,160
And I was listening to this Oliver Tree song and I was going to tweet it out and I'm like,

311
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
wait, no, that's negative post and I'm not because I don't want to upset anyone.

312
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,160
But I was listening to the song and I wanted to buy a billion artworks of me and you together just to be like,

313
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm so thankful for you, just being so nice to me.

314
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,160
I had to tinker with the bios of a new PZ where you shit in your pantylons updating that thing.

315
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Your streaming schedule is clapped.

316
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Wait, what does that mean?

317
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Your streaming schedule is clapped?

318
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
What happened?

319
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
What does it mean?

320
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
It got an STD?

321
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,160
It's clapped goods?

322
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,160
The only thing clapped is my cheeks after a good stream by you guys.

323
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
You get a good stream sniping event.

324
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
You go plop plop plop.

325
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
My man plop plop plop.

326
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
He's speaking Zimmerman.

327
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
The new emotes are highlighted.

328
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Oh no, those aren't.

329
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Well, they're emote holders.

330
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm getting deja vu.

331
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
I've been in this place before.

332
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Hire on the streets and it's not on my time to go.

333
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
I don't know the words.

334
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Clapped equals clapped the cheek as in get ripped.

335
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Yeah, that's the other thing.

336
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
I wish to hear them clap.

337
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,160
I mean, for 20k subs, I'm doing a picture on my alt Twitter,

338
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,160
but I might do a gif as well of my actual, like, you know...

339
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Oh wait, no, you wouldn't be able to hear it.

340
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Okay, maybe I'll just do a twerk gif.

341
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I'll do a gif of twerking.

342
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I'll do thank you for 20k picture.

343
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,160
And if I can get it on video, like what it looks like when my cheeks are clapping,

344
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
then I'll post it.

345
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
So I'm not sure what I'm doing.

346
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Quite everyone gets a twerk gif.

347
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
A round of applause.

348
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,160
So, em, I will say tactically, em, this week's streams,

349
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,160
some of them are a lot shorter than the usual, like,

350
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,160
first day's four hours, second day's four hours,

351
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
third day is a two hour stream.

352
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Apparently, turn it boys like three hours.

353
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
I was gonna play that potion shop game,

354
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
but I decided against it because it's a quite mine.

355
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I need to somehow summon 200 people right now.

356
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
I wish I could summon more than one.

357
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
No, no, don't worry.

358
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I will gif some of the subs.

359
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
No, no, no, no, no, those kind of subs,

360
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
just like general channel subscribers.

361
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
If I had 20,000, like, membership thingies,

362
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,160
bro, Gen 2 and 3 would be farted out more.

363
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Em, but old school runescape is four hours,

364
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
then offline, then back online,

365
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
and then vermentage.

366
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
As long as everyone who wants to play with me has played,

367
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
then I'm quite satisfied when we, like, wrap up at that point.

368
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Em, and then thai cami, samar, you know,

369
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,160
it may just be an hour stream, hour and a half.

370
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Two hours of rubbing my thighs on the make.

371
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I feel like the concept gets a bit stale real quick, you know?

372
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm still waiting for emmy's oiled up toes though.

373
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Where the fuck are they?

374
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Where are they?

375
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I mean, we're waiting.

376
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
She thought that I wasn't going to ask for the oiled up feet?

377
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
No.

378
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Going to play Halo Master?

379
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Yay.

380
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
We're going to play Anniversary.

381
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Hold on, let me pop that way.

382
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay, now whatever's our shared plan,

383
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
we're going to do a combat evolve.

384
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Now, this game my dad used to...

385
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Oh, my dad's message, hold on.

386
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm going to finally read...

387
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,160
So I didn't realise how much I'm going to have to paraphrase

388
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
what my dad said.

389
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Hold on, let me open it up,

390
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
because I have to write it down in Discord.

391
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Right, this is from Papacuttle's.

392
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Okay, this is from Papacuttle's.

393
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Now, I had to change in the fucking...

394
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
because obviously legal name here, legal address here,

395
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
legal this and that.

396
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
He was...

397
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Thank you for being there for my daughter when I could not.

398
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
It's been hard being so far from her

399
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
after everything that happened,

400
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
but it's nice to know you have each other's back.

401
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,160
She has waited very long and worked very hard

402
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
to come back to you,

403
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
and all seems to be well,

404
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
so please continue to enjoy your time together.

405
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,160
She explained that you're now refling,

406
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
which I think is a good fit.

407
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,160
And then he ended it with Papacuttle's approves,

408
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
because I was saying the approves message.

409
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Now, I did have to remove a few things,

410
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
because obviously there's legal name, this, legal name, that,

411
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
and I'm like, right, steady on, steady on, steady on.

412
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Enough of the legal name.

413
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah.

414
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
We've got his approval.

415
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Wait, I'm getting emotional.

416
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
No, so my dad,

417
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
with what happened last year,

418
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
obviously my dad couldn't be with me.

419
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
And I was going through a very hard time,

420
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
like I completely relapsed in my A-bomb and all that,

421
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
like I'm back on,

422
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
I mean, not to get like fucking dramatic or anything,

423
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
but like I'm back on my A-bomb medication,

424
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
because I never used to have to take it,

425
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
but now I have to go back on it type thing.

426
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Yeah.

427
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
And he was obviously very worried,

428
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
because when I used to be on it,

429
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
that's when I was locked in the house for two years,

430
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
and he was like, oh my God, what's happening with you?

431
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
But he couldn't come over,

432
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I mean, he couldn't see me, so, yeah.

433
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,160
But I was expecting the feels for Halo,

434
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
but that's my heart can't take it.

435
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
He's going good,

436
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
and we're playing Halo Combat Evolved.

437
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Now that we have your dad's blessing, let's get married.

438
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
If you keep enough of your Marines alive,

439
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
you get a lot of respect.

440
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Subbed because of it, just saying, what does that mean?

441
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Wait, I get like accolades in game?

442
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Are you teaching me something, yeah?

443
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
We have to give Boombay a hug.

444
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Are you playing with the original graphics?

445
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I don't know, what do you guys want?

446
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
It's up to you.

447
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh, let me just pick legendary.

448
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Achoo!

449
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay, we picked legendary.

450
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Okay, are we ready?

451
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
So, my dad replayed this game

452
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
all the time in front of me,

453
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
but I used to be terrified of the grunts,

454
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
or the wee aliens,

455
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
and I used to hide behind the couch.

456
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Did the original graphics remaster suck?

457
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Do you know what else sucks?

458
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
You on my boobay.

459
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Legendary, cut off if it still be.

460
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I don't even know how to...

461
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Arsenic!

462
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Why are you named after Poison?

463
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Cos you're Poison!

464
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Thank you for becoming a member, Arsenic.

465
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Enjoy the emotes.

466
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Sorry about the pregnancy one.

467
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I promise I'm ordering the actual real emotes soon to you.

468
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Press Tab to switch graphics.

469
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Telling me to skip, which I don't want to.

470
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Is this too quiet?

471
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Do not remove the pregnant one?

472
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Can at least make it...

473
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Spoiler alert, good luck.

474
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
We are playing legendary difficulty.

475
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I need to push up.

476
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
This is so quiet, what the fuck.

477
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Oh, I've got it on ASMR.

478
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,160
At light speed, my maneuvering options were limited.

479
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Is that better?

480
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Yes.

481
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Until we decelerated, no one could have missed the hole we tore in subspace.

482
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
A video of clapping will use in prayer beats?

483
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
On main?

484
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
They were waiting for us on the far side of the planet.

485
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
It's railed up this morning, clearly.

486
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Our fighters are mopping up the last of the recon picket now, nothing serious.

487
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Legendary.

488
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,160
But I've isolated approach signatures for multiple CCS class battle groups.

489
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Sorry, AVW, thank you for coming to memory.

490
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
This game is quiet, right?

491
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Where is it me?

492
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Press Tab.

493
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm pressing Tab, but it's not registered enough.

494
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Nothing's changing.

495
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Cortana!

496
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
I want to get one more.

497
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Volume seems fine.

498
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,160
It is quiet, I don't know if it's bad things.

499
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
It can change.

500
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Remember that time I played Heal of Wars online and I died instantly?

501
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I've still never forgiven myself for being such a dumbass.

502
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
DUMBASS!

503
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Mommy, he's trying to fuck us.

504
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes, I will.

505
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
You heard the lady.

506
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Move like you got a purpose.

507
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
This is not a thrill.

508
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I repeat, this is not a thrill.

509
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Man, your eyes down range.

510
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Fingers on your triggers.

511
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
And we all go home in one ditch.

512
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Fingers on your trigger?

513
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Am I right, Ray?

514
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Wait, no, you're not...

515
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Sir, yes, sir!

516
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Damn right I am.

517
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Now move it out!

518
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Double time!

519
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Attention all personnel.

520
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
We are re-engaging the enemy.

521
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
External and internal contact imminent.

522
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,160
All you greenhorns who wanted to see covenant up close.

523
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
This is going to be your lucky day.

524
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Cortana, one croak.

525
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Sir?

526
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Is that John Master Chief Halo from the hit video game Fortnite?

527
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Okay.

528
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Bringing low-level systems online.

529
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
No trigger.

530
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Tracking the case in 30 seconds.

531
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Safety measures are off.

532
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Other regios with fingers.

533
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Oh my god, it's...

534
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Reflings down the cryo!

535
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
It's time to party!

536
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Party, party, party, party, party, party.

537
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
You've waited long enough.

538
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Let's go!

539
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I'm playing...

540
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm playing a controller.

541
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Hold on.

542
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Orientation.

543
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
One second mate.

544
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
One second.

545
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
How did I even do that?

546
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Where the fuck are subtitles?

547
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
You guys are seeing the volumes a little bit.

548
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
We're accessibility.

549
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Wait.

550
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Subtitles were on?

551
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Why aren't you even lying?

552
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Sorry.

553
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I guess that was burning inside.

554
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Subtitle setting.

555
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
No, that's fine.

556
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah, that's fine.

557
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Put it on.

558
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Sorry.

559
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
That echo.

560
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
I was like, I didn't...

561
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Yeah, I see.

562
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Right, and I put it up a bit.

563
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm joined in at the right time.

564
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Right, so...

565
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm going to tell you something.

566
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Where are my subtitles?

567
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Did I not just put them on?

568
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
It's not on.

569
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Accessibility.

570
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Automatic.

571
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Off.

572
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
On.

573
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Off a fuck's sake.

574
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Right.

575
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
I.

576
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Gee.

577
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Vital signs look normal.

578
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
It's done.

579
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
No freezer burn.

580
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Okay, sir.

581
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Go ahead and climb out of the cryo tube.

582
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Use rate bumper.

583
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm blinded.

584
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Let me tell you something.

585
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Automatic is not on.

586
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I gave you a double dose of the wake-up stim.

587
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Take a quick walk around the cryo bay

588
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
and join me at the optical diagnostic station

589
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
when you're ready.

590
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Okay.

591
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Wait.

592
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Oh, my God.

593
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
That's the difference.

594
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
All right.

595
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, my God.

596
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Holy.

597
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Right.

598
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Okay.

599
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Let me...

600
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Okay.

601
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
I guess we're playing old school.

602
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Right.

603
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Do you want me to play most in keyboard?

604
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Are you okay with...

605
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Where the fuck am I going?

606
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Is there the door?

607
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Wait.

608
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

609
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Oh, my God.

610
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Dad, I need help.

611
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Dad!

612
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Dad!

613
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Maybe I'll just do most in keyboard.

614
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I can't see him.

615
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Am I going mental?

616
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Can you guys see that?

617
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Wait.

618
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Why the fuck is this inverted?

619
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Why is this inverted?

620
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Don't do that.

621
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Stop it.

622
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Why is it inverted now?

623
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Oh, my God.

624
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Stop.

625
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
You're making me look like a fool.

626
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Is that better?

627
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Should I switch it back?

628
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
No.

629
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
The other...

630
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
What the fuck?

631
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Why would anyone play inverted?

632
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
What's cycle?

633
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
What's cycle?

634
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
It's something...

635
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Why?

636
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Oh, he said there's an error.

637
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Oh, right.

638
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Sorry, that was actually another creative of the dev team.

639
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm sorry, dev team.

640
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
You can change it yourself later.

641
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
I can hardly see...

642
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I literally...

643
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm sorry.

644
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I literally cannot see you.

645
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Please let me put up the brightness.

646
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Because...

647
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
What the fuck?

648
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Put up that fucking gamma.

649
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
How can I see function?

650
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Wait.

651
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Let's go.

652
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm ready for the energy shield test now.

653
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Please follow me to the energy shield test station.

654
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
What?

655
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Oh, UI gamma?

656
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
No.

657
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
What the fuck's that?

658
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Hold on.

659
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Hold on.

660
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Scuff, scuff.

661
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
I know how to do that.

662
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Gamma!

663
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Put that fucking up so I can bloody see!

664
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
And now everything's cloudy.

665
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I can't even fucking see.

666
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I can't even fucking see.

667
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Oh, it's a door.

668
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
No.

669
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
How do I run into this guy?

670
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Stand on the yellow square.

671
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
This will just take a second.

672
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Oh, I'm just putting my...

673
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Okay, bring his energy shields online, please.

674
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
What the heck has been on the door?

675
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I have no idea.

676
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
It's so dark for me as well.

677
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Alright.

678
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Shield read is fully charged.

679
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Okay, sir.

680
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Bring them down to test the automatic green charge.

681
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Is it brighter on the other graphic?

682
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Well, I can certainly steal all better

683
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
with the other graphic left admit,

684
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
so it must just be this area.

685
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Press E to continue.

686
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Ow!

687
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Give me my shield back.

688
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Color blank.

689
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
There's no...

690
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Wait, there's no sprint?

691
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Captain, we'll have to skip the weapons diagnostics, and I...

692
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
This game is so old,

693
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
the skipper seems jumpy,

694
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
we better get moving.

695
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
We'll find you weapons later.

696
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Oh, my God!

697
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
I forgot!

698
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I was like two years old

699
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
watching my dad replay this game.

700
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
This way.

701
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Can I get a gun, please?

702
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
The true authentic experience.

703
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Oh, my God!

704
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Am I skinny enough for this?

705
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
No, I'm not skinny enough.

706
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Oh, my God!

707
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Ow!

708
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Why are you so loud out of nowhere?

709
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Right.

710
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
One, relax.

711
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Two, go down.

712
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
What the fuck?

713
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
That went so loud out of nowhere.

714
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Game music.

715
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Man, your music.

716
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Get that shakedown.

717
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Save.

718
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Okay, let's try that.

719
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Loud Halo theme, please.

720
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,160
That is still really fucking loud.

721
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Holy shit, hold on.

722
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
How is...

723
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Okay, I think...

724
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I don't know.

725
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I can lower it further.

726
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
No sprint and climbing.

727
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Okay.

728
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm like looking at the bar

729
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,160
versus me, and it's not looking good.

730
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Banger is a banger,

731
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
but it's so loud.

732
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Oh, they're dying.

733
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Can I carry this weapon?

734
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Can I have your pistol, please?

735
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Oh!

736
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm actually getting shot at.

737
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Can I get your pistol, please?

738
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Ah!

739
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
What did I do?

740
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
I don't have a gun.

741
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't have anything.

742
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Please.

743
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Anyone?

744
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Can you give me your pistol?

745
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Uh, yeah.

746
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I can't see anything.

747
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
I think...

748
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I can see more on OBS

749
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
than I am on my actual screen.

750
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm glad you're playing Halo's.

751
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Bro, give me your gun!

752
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Give me your gun!

753
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Yeah, it's him.

754
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Fuck it.

755
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Joe Bonogos, Johnny's husband.

756
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Thank you for the super chat.

757
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm trying to play it,

758
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
but I don't remember anything.

759
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I just remember my dad playing the first mission

760
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
where they crash landed

761
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
and everyone died in the ship.

762
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm starting to think it's not this game.

763
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I'm getting nervous.

764
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I don't think I'm playing the right one

765
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
that my dad played.

766
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Is this not the one where you crash down in the ship?

767
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Give me a weapon!

768
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Get clear!

769
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
No!

770
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Give me freakin' ammo!

771
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
No!

772
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
It's because colorblind mode is on?

773
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Wait, actually?

774
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Are you trolling me?

775
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Accessibility?

776
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Colorblind?

777
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
UI colorblindness, colorblindness.

778
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Why was that even on?

779
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
I can see!

780
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,160
I can see now.

781
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I can see.

782
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Oh my god.

783
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Well, I'm blinded now, but...

784
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Why was that on?

785
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Did I put it on?

786
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
I thought you had.

787
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Bro.

788
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Put it on when I was going to fail.

789
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Bro.

790
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
10 out of 10.

791
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Smash!

792
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Smash!

793
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Don't care.

794
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Smash!

795
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Smash!

796
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
I love Cortana so much.

797
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Can you imagine how much they...

798
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
in the helmet?

799
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Report.

800
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
It would.

801
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
It would.

802
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Ma'am!

803
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Fire control for the main cannon is offline!

804
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Captain, the cannon was my last offensive option.

805
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
All right.

806
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm initiating cold protocol article 2.

807
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
We're abandoning the autumn.

808
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
That means you too, Cortana.

809
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Why did you go down the ship?

810
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,160
It doesn't let me, but I'm going to leave the old stuff on.

811
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm going to try and land the autumn on it.

812
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,160
AI decided what they looked like, so Cortana decided to do it like this.

813
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
He was a sexist woman.

814
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
I appreciate your concern, Cortana.

815
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
But it's not a thing.

816
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
That skin tight bodysuit.

817
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Cortana Gen 2, confirm.

818
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Instruction or capture of a ship...

819
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Shontana!

820
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Oh, it kind of sounds like Hannah Montana.

821
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You already know what chief collapses?

822
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,160
She's digitally real and true.

823
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
I'm sorry, but...

824
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,160
I may or may not have consumed some Cortana stuff back in the past,

825
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
because I love her so much.

826
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Absolutely accept otherwise.

827
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
I always thought she was just...

828
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Her.

829
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I understand.

830
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I understand.

831
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
The autumn will continue evasive maneuvers

832
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
until you initiate a landing sequence.

833
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Not that you'll listen, but I'd suggest letting my subroutines

834
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
handle the final approach.

835
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Excellent work, Cortana.

836
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
I can't.

837
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Back then, the animation was just the jaw unhinging.

838
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
A calendar.

839
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Shontana and master calls.

840
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Stop! I'll order that artwork right now.

841
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
I was like sewing my feels yesterday.

842
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I'm like, okay, I'm going to order all this artwork

843
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
and it's going to make me feel so much better.

844
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
And it was artwork of me being like,

845
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
thank you for waiting on me type stuff.

846
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Your architecture isn't much different from the others.

847
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Oh my god, she's in my...

848
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
In my head!

849
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Okay.

850
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
There's a lady in my head

851
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
that calls me stud muffin.

852
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Maybe I should get one of me as Cortana

853
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
and I'm taking you out of cryo-freeze.

854
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I think maybe that one would be quite significant.

855
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Oh my god, I can actually see.

856
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I cannot tell you how much I can see.

857
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Oh my god.

858
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Look at that legendary mode skills.

859
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Oh!

860
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
That's right, I'm on legendary mode.

861
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh, hold on, I need reload.

862
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Oh my god, the aim assist is like so strong.

863
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I love it.

864
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Oh my god, we're in the mess hole.

865
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Oh my god, the aim assist is still good.

866
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
Is it still loud or anything?

867
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Sorry.

868
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Oh my god, I love it.

869
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
How do I eat an alien this game?

870
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Bravo.

871
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
How do you reload?

872
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Wait, X is in reload?

873
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
What the fuck is reload?

874
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
How do you...

875
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
How do you re-

876
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Wait, how?

877
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Right bumper is to reload?

878
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Stop.

879
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
That's terrible.

880
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm not sure when we're going to be reloading

881
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
in a lot of middle of things.

882
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Right.

883
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Right bumper, honestly.

884
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Oh wait, hold on, I already...

885
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Wait, hold on, I need reload.

886
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Right, okay, there we go, there we go.

887
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh, the controls popping up

888
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
just as I'm having a stroke.

889
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Try to figure out how to reload that.

890
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Oh, wait, that's not right.

891
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
How do you like it now?

892
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,160
It's nothing, it's airlock.

893
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Airlock?

894
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
In my...

895
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Oh, I'm gonna...

896
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm gonna...

897
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm not gonna lie, I almost shot at them.

898
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Stop, I love the aim assist in this game so much.

899
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
I love not having to try hard in games.

900
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Amy messaged me yesterday.

901
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
She was like, oh, did you have fun on Fortnite?

902
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
And I was like, yeah.

903
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
I was telling her like,

904
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,160
oh, I really enjoy not having to like...

905
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Is that just because you're alien technology?

906
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Wait, we better just smash it.

907
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Huh?

908
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
It's like a bonus or something.

909
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
I don't know, I've just done something.

910
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Overshield?

911
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Wait, is this actually legendary?

912
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah, yeah, no, this is legendary.

913
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
100%, yep.

914
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
MLG Pro, that's me.

915
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,160
See, the thing with trying to win legendary mode

916
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
is you have to hit your headshots

917
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,160
or you're just wasting bullets unironically

918
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
playing this game mode.

919
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
So don't waste your bullets and aim for the head.

920
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
See how I'm carefully aligning the crosshair for the head.

921
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
It just means that...

922
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
And you can fill the AI as well

923
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,160
because if you didn't know, when you look away from the AI

924
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
it's programmed not to shoot you

925
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
but as you can see, like all these headshots,

926
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
you can't get me.

927
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Such a pro.

928
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,160
But I know all the strats and I'll just be running.

929
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Do you guys remember

930
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,160
that guy that pretended to be a Halo player

931
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
and he was like speedrunning

932
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,160
but he wasn't really a Halo player?

933
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
And he played this game

934
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
and he was like messing up all the strats

935
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
and he was invited to do it on Games Done Quick.

936
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,160
She's just pro-game of the best, literally.

937
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,160
As I just sort of shoot my own ally.

938
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Oh my god, Amy says, come on, pop off.

939
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Hold up.

940
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Wait, I keep...

941
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,160
I keep putting the flashlight on to freaking reload.

942
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Right, hold on.

943
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Gameplay, no.

944
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Controls.

945
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Configure the gamepad.

946
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Reload.

947
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Rit, rit.

948
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
Oh no.

949
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
Do not invert anything.

950
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Oh my gosh.

951
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Edit layout.

952
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
Reload.

953
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
X.

954
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Flashlight.

955
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Sure.

956
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I'll just shove on that.

957
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
What do you mean, action?

958
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Do we even need the flashlight?

959
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Be honest.

960
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I don't know.

961
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Save changes.

962
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
There's one unmapped.

963
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Well, where does it go?

964
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
No, don't...

965
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
No, that's jump.

966
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Oh my god, the game's trolling me.

967
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Right, Crouch actually should be that one.

968
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Zoom in.

969
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Wait, so what's the missing...

970
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
The game's trolling me.

971
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I don't know what the missing input is.

972
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Missing input.

973
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Toggle the flashlight.

974
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Just put on X as well, then, I guess.

975
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Or is it going to take it off?

976
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Wait, I'm getting trolled.

977
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm actually getting trolled.

978
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I'm getting trolled.

979
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Please use the pre-made one.

980
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm fucking...

981
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm just having to restore it.

982
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Discard changes.

983
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Bruh, I'm actually going to have a stroke playing this game.

984
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Oh my god.

985
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Right, I'm just going to have to...

986
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Wait, why can't I shoot?

987
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Wait, why can't I shoot?

988
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Hold up.

989
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
What have I done?

990
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
What have I done?

991
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I literally cannot shoot.

992
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
What have I done?

993
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Configure game path.

994
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
What have I done?

995
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Shoot.

996
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Fire.

997
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Right trigger.

998
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Right, so why was...

999
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
What have I done?

1000
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
What?!

1001
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
What?!

1002
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Huh?!

1003
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Configure...

1004
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
Oh my god, what is going on?!

1005
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Right, you know what?

1006
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
You know what?

1007
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
I don't know what's going on.

1008
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
We're fucking...

1009
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
We're just doing mouse and keyboard.

1010
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I don't know what's going on.

1011
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
It's just too embarrassing to continue.

1012
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Okay, this is too embarrassing to continue with the game pad.

1013
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
I've absolutely...

1014
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
I've broken everything.

1015
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
I have broken everything.

1016
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
And are you doing the rest of it?

1017
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Wait.

1018
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Whoa!

1019
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Okay, we just had a massive lag spike.

1020
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
That's okay.

1021
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Wait, where is that supposed to go?

1022
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Right here?

1023
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Can you...

1024
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Yeah, okay, okay.

1025
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,160
At least mouse and keyboard seem to be the correct kind of thing.

1026
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
As I said, I am a legendary player,

1027
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,160
so I can handle these kind of major inconveniences.

1028
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
As you can see...

1029
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm just so good.

1030
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I don't know what happened.

1031
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Please back off.

1032
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
You're so...

1033
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I broke the game.

1034
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Literally, the game thought...

1035
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Why does it keep doing that?

1036
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,160
It keeps, like, stopping me from walking.

1037
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
It keeps, like, stuttering.

1038
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
What are you...

1039
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
It's like...

1040
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Oh my god!

1041
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
How have I done this?

1042
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
What have I done to make this happen?

1043
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
I covered it.

1044
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
On the landing above us.

1045
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
It's, like, stuttering the game now?

1046
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Because I swapped some controls around by accident?

1047
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm now, like, got insane free-rate lag or something?

1048
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
The graphics are a pixel!

1049
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I don't know.

1050
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
It's impressed how bad...

1051
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,160
How badly you broke it so quickly.

1052
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Look, the game is obviously trying to sabotage me.

1053
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
What the fuck is this?

1054
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
What is this?

1055
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
What did I do with it?

1056
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Did I touch it?

1057
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
What did it do?

1058
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
How about it's melee?

1059
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
I don't know.

1060
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Murph for melee?

1061
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Oh my god.

1062
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Everything's lagging.

1063
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I don't know.

1064
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Oh my god.

1065
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
It keeps, like, pausing me.

1066
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
I don't know why.

1067
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
I can't do this.

1068
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I've missed this so badly.

1069
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
You have to put it on a different present,

1070
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
like, South 4.

1071
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Also, I think...

1072
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Click the analog stick and flashlight.

1073
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
It's an animal.

1074
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
It's an animal.

1075
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
And plug the controller and hit the golden dodo.

1076
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Wait, actually.

1077
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
The controller's fucking wireless.

1078
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
It's connected.

1079
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
No!

1080
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Don't change the graphics!

1081
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
I never even touched the button!

1082
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,160
How could this go so amiss?

1083
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,160
POV when girls think they're gamers.

1084
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Fuck you.

1085
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I've taken out the controller.

1086
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
That was my PC that made that noise.

1087
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I've taken out the controller,

1088
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,160
so it only has the keyboard input.

1089
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Let's see if that'll fix my random

1090
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
starting and stopping.

1091
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,160
I'm to go back and melee the crap out of this.

1092
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
This is primes...

1093
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I've never had a stream go so badly before.

1094
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
What is going on?

1095
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm to do something with this.

1096
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Melee, obviously, should be my mouse button.

1097
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
Let's skip down a bit.

1098
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
Hold on, hold on.

1099
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
You've been in the game for so long,

1100
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
and you've not even...

1101
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Melee.

1102
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Melee.

1103
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
What?

1104
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Mouse for...

1105
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
That's all I need.

1106
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Everything else?

1107
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm just...

1108
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I'm not touching my 10 foot pool.

1109
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Nothing happens.

1110
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Are you trolling me?

1111
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Nothing happens.

1112
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Rest well, those who need to sleep.

1113
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Shoot it.

1114
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Oh!

1115
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
It says I spy one of three.

1116
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Ha!

1117
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
You're in my way, bro.

1118
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Bro!

1119
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,160
You're literally blocking me.

1120
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
I, Master Chief, the tank.

1121
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
Okay.

1122
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
I spy.

1123
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
I didn't even know those were in the game.

1124
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Or we don't mean...

1125
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Okay, we'll play moose and keyboard,

1126
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
because we're just...

1127
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Oh my god, is that an empty thing?

1128
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Sorry, Cortana.

1129
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
I was having to deal with my sentence,

1130
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
but thank you, though.

1131
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Oh, can they get a little freight?

1132
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
They're like, whew!

1133
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,160
Oh, I went too far.

1134
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
I don't know.

1135
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
That looks like maintenance to me.

1136
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Master Chief, more like a Master Chief.

1137
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Heller of all of them,

1138
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
this mission has a maximum of, like,

1139
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Wait, they're randomized?

1140
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I've been trolled.

1141
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
Did it really just make me walk through this tunnel

1142
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
and there's nothing in it?

1143
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Oh.

1144
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Press four or use a flashlight.

1145
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Okay, okay.

1146
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
I literally thought it was like,

1147
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
yeah, go down this tunnel,

1148
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
but it's not gonna go anywhere.

1149
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Ooh!

1150
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Let me in!

1151
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Okay, again, just a random place.

1152
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Uh-huh.

1153
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
Okay, we've learned melee.

1154
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,160
I do a lot of good tutorial mode.

1155
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Cortana, we need some mad help.

1156
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Mad help.

1157
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Oh, my God, so good.

1158
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,160
As if you take a full magazine clip

1159
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,160
to go down, Saus.

1160
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
He's not that much of a tank.

1161
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Mummy's strong.

1162
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Literally, I am matrixing the bullets.

1163
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,160
I'm matrixing them so hard right now.

1164
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
Right, I think...

1165
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
I think we're over our issues.

1166
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Okay, I think the issues are over.

1167
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
Oh, my God, it's me!

1168
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Oh, my God, it's me!

1169
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
Oh, wait, no.

1170
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
No, it's you!

1171
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Wait, hold on.

1172
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1173
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,160
Hold on, pause, pause, pause.

1174
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,160
Let me redo that clip.

1175
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Let me redo the clip.

1176
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Hold on, hold on.

1177
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Let me redo it.

1178
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Okay.

1179
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Okay, I think we've dealt with

1180
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
all the problems now

1181
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
with the controls.

1182
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Oh, my God, it's Sherry!

1183
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,160
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1184
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Thank you, refunds.

1185
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
Okay, my voice feels better.

1186
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Oh, shit.

1187
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Is there all going to blow it up to smithereens?

1188
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
You're going to gulp in yourself

1189
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
this crazy work, honestly.

1190
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
Wait, am I...

1191
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Can I die here?

1192
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Can I actually die here?

1193
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
Wait, where's my flashlight dead?

1194
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I can't see anything.

1195
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Oh, my God, that scared me.

1196
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
Don't do that.

1197
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
My freaking flashlight doesn't have

1198
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
full bars.

1199
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Why put me in a dark room

1200
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
if it's freaking going to put...

1201
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
This isn't a horror game.

1202
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
Stop it.

1203
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Don't laugh.

1204
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,160
Don't laugh, okay?

1205
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Put me in a dark place

1206
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,160
and then put a jump scare in.

1207
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
It's loud, okay?

1208
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,160
I didn't expect them.

1209
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
I didn't expect them.

1210
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
I get creeped out when there's things

1211
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
rattling around and...

1212
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,160
Oh, my God.

1213
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,160
Don't do that again, Halo.

1214
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
You understand me?

1215
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Don't jump scare me again.

1216
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Cannon fodder.

1217
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
This is a lot of corridors.

1218
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Where?

1219
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,160
Where?

1220
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,160
Where is it?

1221
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
I don't know where it is.

1222
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
I swear if I die,

1223
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
because I can't figure out

1224
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
where this launch thing is.

1225
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
This one?

1226
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
This one.

1227
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
Okay, we made it.

1228
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Okay.

1229
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
This?

1230
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Yay!

1231
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
I had a right to check.

1232
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Going for minimum safe distance?

1233
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
That's really good.

1234
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Oh, Dim's done.

1235
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Thank you for the tip.

1236
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
I'm so sorry.

1237
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
I'll do a mouse and keyboard.

1238
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
I'm good with mouse and keyboard.

1239
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Amy has sent me a DM.

1240
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Are you squidding me right now?

1241
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Tharya!

1242
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,160
That's actually really good.

1243
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I'm going to give you that one.

1244
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,160
Thank you, Tharya, for the super chat.

1245
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,160
That was actually a really good one.

1246
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
That was quick.

1247
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Not going to lie.

1248
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,160
I went past the lifeboat twice.

1249
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
We're going to make it, sir.

1250
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
I don't want to die.

1251
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,160
No, you don't have armor, mate.

1252
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
I don't know in full world.

1253
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
But don't worry, your sheep can be clocked.

1254
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Narrative Navigator 1 of 8.

1255
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Narrative Navigator 1 of 8.

1256
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
The AI kept jumping off the bridge,

1257
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
so Bungie just killed them to not go programming.

1258
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
That's so real.

1259
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
I'm losing her.

1260
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
Brace for impact.

1261
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh, no.

1262
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,160
Oh, lord.

1263
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
Are we in the heaven?

1264
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,160
Chief?

1265
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,160
Chief, can you hear me?

1266
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,160
This is what I remember my dad playing.

1267
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,160
Are you all right?

1268
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,160
Can you move?

1269
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Oh, my god.

1270
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,160
What are we picking up?

1271
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
Oh, ammo and spook.

1272
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
Okay.

1273
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
I think I have all the ammo in me.

1274
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
Yeah!

1275
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,160
Damn!

1276
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
There's a sacrifice.

1277
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
I...

1278
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
killed Joan.

1279
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
He's really clinic.

1280
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
Okay.

1281
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
Yeah, yeah.

1282
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Need me more than American Henry accent.

1283
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

1284
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
They all say us Marines are the exact same.

1285
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
They all call us jarheads.

1286
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
They all say we chew crayons.

1287
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
That's not what I found.

1288
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
We are the...

1289
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,160
I don't know.

1290
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,160
I don't have...

1291
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Alert.

1292
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Why did she say that so sassily?

1293
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
Alert.

1294
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Halo.

1295
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
Mr. Halo.

1296
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Alert.

1297
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
There's enemies.

1298
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Can you just like walk away from the fight

1299
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,160
if the direction of the mission is over here?

1300
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
Can I just walk away?

1301
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
What's that noise?

1302
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,160
I've literally just walked away.

1303
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
There's something by the waterfall.

1304
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Really?

1305
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
There's a rather loud...

1306
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,160
Do you mean?

1307
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Okay.

1308
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,160
Do you mean?

1309
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,160
These things are loud.

1310
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
Is there actually something at the waterfall?

1311
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Drap.

1312
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,160
Is there actually...

1313
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Before I go down here,

1314
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
is there actually or am I getting trolled?

1315
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,160
I can hear stuff.

1316
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
A skull?

1317
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Oh, okay.

1318
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
Okay.

1319
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,160
I thought John Chief doesn't take fall damage.

1320
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
Where the fuck is my skull?

1321
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,160
Did you just make me take...

1322
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,160
Mods, time that man out.

1323
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,160
Where the fuck is the skull?

1324
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
He doesn't take it in the other game.

1325
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
I'm such a fake gamer.

1326
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
Time out.

1327
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,160
Anyone who said there was something behind the waterfall?

1328
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Mods, time them out for 10 seconds.

1329
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,160
That'll teach them to think twice before speaking

1330
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
in such...

1331
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
Only in the new graphics.

1332
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Wait, what?

1333
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
There's a skull behind the new graphics?

1334
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Why would there be a skull behind the new?

1335
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
I can't even see!

1336
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,160
You're too low of a difficulty.

1337
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
These accusations are unfound.

1338
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,160
I'm on legendary mode.

1339
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,160
The skull is on new graphics.

1340
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,160
On a higher difficulty getty!

1341
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
Fuck, man.

1342
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,160
No.

1343
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,160
I'm already on legendary.

1344
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,160
You literally can't get better than me.

1345
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Oh, this is your start, make a wish.

1346
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Are you kidding me?

1347
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Yeah.

1348
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,160
It really has a bull, hasn't it?

1349
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Thank you, tiny spiny.

1350
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,160
Difficulties shouldn't matter.

1351
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,160
That's impossible.

1352
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,160
She's on the highest difficulty.

1353
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
Thank you.

1354
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Alright, then.

1355
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
I don't deserve to take...

1356
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
No!

1357
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Oh, no, we actually have to do the fight now.

1358
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,160
How do I get more health out of this?

1359
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
I genuinely don't know.

1360
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,160
I can hear it.

1361
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
By the way, if you hear a heartbeat,

1362
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
it's because I'm one health.

1363
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Right, let's try that again.

1364
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Let's try that again.

1365
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,160
Hold on now, hold on now.

1366
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Hold on now.

1367
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Look, as I said, we're on legendary difficulty.

1368
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,160
The only way the game can kill me

1369
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,160
is if I give myself fall damage.

1370
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,160
I basically have to sabotage myself, okay?

1371
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Okay.

1372
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I literally am the only reason I die in video games

1373
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,160
because I'm naturally so good at them, you know?

1374
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
I'm naturally...

1375
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Death counter one...

1376
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,160
No!

1377
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,160
Wait, what?

1378
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
How am I getting shot?

1379
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,160
The booty lord?

1380
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
War.

1381
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,160
War never changes.

1382
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
No, the thing's on fire.

1383
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,160
Fuck it out!

1384
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Fuck it out!

1385
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Fuck it out, where's the other one?

1386
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
Okay.

1387
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
There's grunts on the hill.

1388
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
I repeat, there's wee aliens on the hill.

1389
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Whose side are you on?

1390
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,160
Are you on Jenna's side or are you on the alien's side?

1391
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,160
I'm trying to make a joke about killing the aliens.

1392
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,160
I'm sorry, it's not working.

1393
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
I'm sorry.

1394
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,160
I am not smart enough to pull off that joke.

1395
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,160
Right.

1396
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,160
The pistol is the greatest sniper, is it actually?

1397
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
How do I swap to my second gun?

1398
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Oh, there we go.

1399
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Okay, let's snipe some people.

1400
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,160
I'm on the side of justice, bonk!

1401
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Okay, I'm creepy indeed.

1402
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,160
Okay, let's see if I'm any good with the sniper.

1403
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,160
You didn't see that.

1404
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Okay, hold on.

1405
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
I just found getting shot.

1406
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
Wait, I'm killing the dead body, they're already dead.

1407
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Who is she?

1408
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Oh my god, look at that inboard.

1409
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,160
Come on, come on.

1410
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
You have to give it to me.

1411
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,160
Zoom in.

1412
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
Oh.

1413
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,160
I know this game has zoom in, what do you call it?

1414
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I've played it before.

1415
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,160
What do you mean watching your dad play the game when you're two years old

1416
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
and kind of can't play that?

1417
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,160
It doesn't kind of explain the game before.

1418
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,160
What are you talking about?

1419
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
Not more of them.

1420
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,160
Not more of them?

1421
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
Am I even supposed to do anything?

1422
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,160
Not more of them.

1423
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Oh no, none of them.

1424
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
This is a little too easy to play the normal.

1425
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,160
What do you mean easy?

1426
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,160
What?

1427
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
I'm literally on legendary.

1428
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,160
Look at the way I'm matrixing all the bullets.

1429
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
I have no idea.

1430
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1431
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
I'm getting sniped by a jackal, go away.

1432
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,160
Oh, my shield's down.

1433
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
What are you doing?

1434
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,160
Stop it.

1435
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,160
I like that.

1436
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,160
I can use some help over here.

1437
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
We are.

1438
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Are I supposed to protect them?

1439
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,160
I was in high school when the scene came out.

1440
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
Oh, my God.

1441
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
Oh, gee, son.

1442
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
I'm hiding.

1443
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,160
I'm hiding.

1444
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
Literally using tree for cover.

1445
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,160
I can't believe I'm actually having to play tactically.

1446
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
How are you not dead?

1447
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,160
I've literally sprayed a whole clip into you and then some.

1448
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
What is being that noise?

1449
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
I love the way they run away.

1450
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
He's so scared.

1451
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Okay, close.

1452
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
And he's still not done.

1453
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
Right, I'm out to defend them.

1454
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Surely that's what the mission objective is.

1455
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
I'm not wasting my time being here.

1456
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Surely the mission objective.

1457
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Uh-oh.

1458
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Another band are dropping in behind us.

1459
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
They're trying to flank us.

1460
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,160
They're dropping in behind us.

1461
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
They're trying to flank us.

1462
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,160
Master Chief from the hit video game series,

1463
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
Fortnite Battle Fees.

1464
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,160
The shit in my ears.

1465
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,160
And I bulleted up my PC.

1466
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,160
If you shoot at me one more freaking time,

1467
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,160
I don't know what part is shooting at me, but I mean, I don't know.

1468
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,160
That's it again.

1469
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Enough.

1470
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Enough of the rumbly loud tumbling.

1471
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,160
Don't need to turn the game sound up down a bit.

1472
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,160
It's getting a bit, you know.

1473
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,160
That's it.

1474
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
That'll teach them.

1475
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
That's right.

1476
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,160
That'll teach you a lesson.

1477
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Get out of here.

1478
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,160
Don't come back.

1479
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Pretty cute until they come.

1480
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
Right.

1481
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
No more.

1482
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,160
Bruh.

1483
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Come on.

1484
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
One in three.

1485
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Yeah.

1486
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
That'll scare them, literally.

1487
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
They won't come back.

1488
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
They won't be.

1489
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Oh, no.

1490
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,160
We've got two at a time.

1491
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,160
Grr.

1492
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,160
No.

1493
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
Oh, wait.

1494
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
That's not.

1495
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,160
Brr.

1496
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Brr.

1497
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,160
Brr.

1498
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,160
Brr.

1499
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,160
Brr.

1500
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,160
Brr.

1501
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Brr.

1502
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Brr.

1503
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Brr.

1504
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Brr.

1505
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
Brr.

1506
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Brr.

1507
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
Brr.

1508
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,160
Brr.

1509
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,160
Brr.

1510
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Brr.

1511
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,120
Brr.

1512
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Brr.

1513
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,160
Brr.

1514
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,160
Brr.

1515
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,160
Brr.

1516
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Brr.

1517
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,160
Brr.

1518
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Brr.

1519
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,160
Brr.

1520
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
Brr.

1521
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Brr.

1522
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,160
Brr.

1523
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Brr.

1524
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Brr.

1525
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,160
Brr.

1526
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,160
Brr.

1527
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,160
Brr.

1528
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
Brr.

1529
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Brr.

1530
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Brr.

1531
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,160
Brr.

1532
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
Brr.

1533
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,160
Brr.

1534
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,160
Brr.

1535
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Brr.

1536
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Brr.

1537
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Brr.

1538
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:35,160
Are we done now? Or did I just move on to the next section of the map because...

1539
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
I just can't really look.

1540
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
I wish I could flip them.

1541
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Halo 2 is impossible.

1542
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
We read you. Is that you, Fohammer?

1543
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,160
Roger, Fire Team Charlie. Good to hear from you.

1544
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,160
Hello.

1545
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Fohammer, we need transportation to the command shuttle.

1546
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Wait, wait, come on.

1547
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
I'm on my way.

1548
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Look, more lifeboats.

1549
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Give me that warhog.

1550
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,160
You're fast.

1551
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,160
Give me that warhog.

1552
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,160
If those lifeboats...

1553
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
There's no... If I had a sprint, ooh.

1554
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,160
Fohammer, we need you to disengage your warthog.

1555
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,160
The Master Chief and I are going to see if we can save some soldiers.

1556
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,160
The Master Chief?

1557
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,160
Roger Cortana.

1558
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,160
The Master Chief.

1559
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Okay.

1560
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Now remember, when you drive cars in Halo,

1561
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
you have to aim at your mouse.

1562
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
You have to aim...

1563
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
Ooh, it's your mouse.

1564
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Where am I going?

1565
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,160
I assume this way.

1566
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,160
It looks like we're going downhill.

1567
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,160
Let's go gambling.

1568
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,160
Aw dang it.

1569
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
The Master Chief.

1570
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Okay, this looks like it, surely.

1571
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Jackal Snipers are appearing in Halo 2.

1572
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,160
I'm driving.

1573
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Look, I didn't have to go and get lessons.

1574
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,160
Oh my god.

1575
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
If you wanna...

1576
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,160
If you see...

1577
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Sorry.

1578
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
If you meet it, then you know you have to go.

1579
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,160
Oh my god, the driving is actually really nice.

1580
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,160
Oh my god, where are we parking?

1581
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
Nope, not this way.

1582
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
Wait, why the...

1583
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
Wait, what?

1584
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,160
This literally looks like an underground car park.

1585
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,160
Is this like a secret or something?

1586
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
Why is there randomly this?

1587
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,160
There better be a skull here if I'm going to explore in.

1588
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,160
Nope, it's just...

1589
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,160
I'm getting trolled.

1590
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,160
Now parallel park!

1591
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,160
We'll enter.

1592
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
Wait!

1593
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
Aw for fuck's sake.

1594
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Right, okay.

1595
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Oh, okay.

1596
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,160
Ow, sorry.

1597
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,160
You just stay on that wee rotating thing.

1598
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
Right, let's go.

1599
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,160
Okay, we cleared the gap.

1600
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
Big drift!

1601
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,160
Big drift!

1602
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
I didn't realize it was around the corner.

1603
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Big drift!

1604
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Get him!

1605
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
Aim bot!

1606
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Aim bot!

1607
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Start shooting!

1608
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Start shooting!

1609
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
That's not a bridge.

1610
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,160
Nope, do not.

1611
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Don't go for it.

1612
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
Right, okay.

1613
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
You stay there.

1614
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,160
I'll go open the bridge somehow.

1615
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:32,160
A little known secret about the construct is that they have huge parking lots.

1616
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,160
Literally, I'm like, oh, this is perfect for my Warthog.

1617
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,160
I don't even need like those mirrors that they're using.

1618
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,160
Where am I supposed to go?

1619
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,160
Looks at you with my gleeby eyes.

1620
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
Ooh, let's not go on that.

1621
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Are you a password?

1622
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,160
People, people, people, please open the bridge.

1623
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
Right, bridge access over here, clearly.

1624
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Where the jackals are.

1625
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
Yeah, okay.

1626
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,160
If they put heavy or...

1627
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,160
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1628
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Oh, okay, okay.

1629
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,160
The lighten up, okay?

1630
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,160
We're lighting it up, we're lighting it up.

1631
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,160
We're lighting it up.

1632
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,160
Follow the lights.

1633
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,160
I know what to do.

1634
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,160
Where's the door code?

1635
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
Oh my god, it has a little beacon.

1636
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
Look at my grind.

1637
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
Such a whip.

1638
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,160
Why did you AI lock onto me?

1639
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,160
Scaring me.

1640
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,480
don't you remember you're so good at this game that you already unlocked all

1641
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,760
the skulls oh the skulls yeah they have to make more achievements because

1642
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,600
mother is so yeah all this skull how could I forget about the skulls like

row oh yeah it's an overpowered 50 caliber i like how it comes with a radio frequency as well

1760
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,320
just i don't know what it means

1761
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,200

1762
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,480
i'm exploring i'm exploring this looks important can i touch

others

1770
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,640
the music just coming on it nowhere right i don't know what i'm supposed to explore inside the structure though

1771
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,760
oh but that would have been so cool if i had hold on you embarrass me don't do that again

1772
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:03,640
be mindful of the limited ammo on the sniper oh whoa this looks like where we're supposed to go

1773
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:21,000
i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't mean that i was a mistake i am so sorry

1774

1776
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:41,720
went off that i'm not even kidding was that what i was supposed to do is this just like a mirror

1777
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,760
that's the same on the side too i can't believe i just killed that man in cold blood

1792
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,960
the truth and that was the tutorial mission the ship is currently holding position approximately

1793
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:26,120
three hundred years above the other end of this plateau that i'm a bit believe

1794
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:30,920
a lot of we get inside the ship if it's in the air the core is just me a rifle not a wing

1795
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,960
there's a gravity lift that varies troops and supplies between the ship and the surface

1796
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,800
that's our oh my sniper still i should be able to lock on to the tracking thanks for joining captain

1797

1798
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:50,840
paying us by the hour stick to the higher ground to the right we should be able to

1799
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,320
recon the covenant position without being spotted i've detected covenant stationary

1800
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,120
guns near the next pass i recommend using your sniper rifle to take out the gunners while i call

1801
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:05,240
for marina support there's no one on it get ready to move in to support us sergeant the master

1802
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,720
chief is going to covertly take out as many of the covenant as he can don't open fire until you

1803
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,560
hear the enemy return fire on us that should let us keep the element of surprise

1804
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:21,160

1981
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:33,160
i did okay i will have to say the seamless ability to go from like dead to instantly load to your last

1982
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,720
instance really digging out honestly

1983

1986
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:08,840
talking about what death you never dead exactly the marine dialogue is awesome

1987
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,560
there is a lot going on

1988
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,000
what the

1989
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:33,880
you know actually controversial take for a game that was made like a billion years ago

1990
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:41,960
this doesn't look that bad like i'm sorry i'm i think it looks good maybe i'm going crazy but

1991
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:47,560
but or oversimplifying it but it's fine to me

1992
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,680
okay new checkpoint game

1993
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:01,000
it sure does how's that controversial i don't know like because i know the whole point of like

1994
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
they kind of remastered it with a alternative as i broke my game like they remastered it to

1995
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,800
look like all fancy and schmancy but the reality is i mean this doesn't look that bad for when it

1996
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:22,120
came out and stuff i think it's done really well for itself the halo dev team should be happy it

1997
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:32,040
aged very well yes i am inclined to agree you know what you know what see you you're back

1998
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:41,320
okay where am i going i'm just letting it take me wherever the heck it's taking me i have no

1999
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:49,960
idea i'm just going for it there's a lot oh there's reloading stuff there hold on i think i've

2000
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:55,240
figured out if there's dead marines it means you can like heal up and yeah okay and get tons of supplies

2001
01:45:55,240 --> 01:46:01,160
got it i'm in danger the xbox og controller though i literally couldn't eat nothing

2012
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:26,920
red door that door's not red so we must be in the brig these look like holding cells there are

2013
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,800

2028
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:24,440

2158
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,120
Streaming for two months still hasn't figured out

2159
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:44,360
audio issues, real and true, and literally me.

2160
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,680
Right, did you guys just spawn in here, or?

2161
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,080
Gotta go back to your old Yeller.

2162
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,400
Oh, trust me.

2163
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:54,960
Okay.

2164
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:00,160
Ah!

2165
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,640
Stop, I can hear them.

2166
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,240
Oh my God, they're like shuffling about.

2167
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:07,040
You little freaks, leave me alone.

2168
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:09,200
Fuck you.

2169
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,040
Oh my God, stop!

2170
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,840
Die already!

2171
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,880
Eh, eh?

2172
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,120
Okay, I have one of them.

2173
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,760
How is it not dead?

2174
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,040
Okay.

2175
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,680
It doesn't seem to really register them in the room,

2176
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:37,040
but yeah, so I'll take that as a good thing.

2177
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,320
Okay, okay, we're good, we're good.

2178
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:43,880
So anyway, I thought it was blasted.

2179
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:46,920
Okay, I got a checkpoint for destroying those guys.

2180
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:50,040
No more jump scares around the corner with enemies, though.

2181
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,720
I didn't, like, that's twice I've been jump scared

2182
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,400
in this game, twice!

2183
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,600
She doesn't know, what do I not know?

2184
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,520
You need to hit their back.

2185
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,760
Oh.

2186
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:03,480
Use the hollow panel to shut down the security system.

2187
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,640
Uh, careful, we're gonna get flashbanged.

2188
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,720
Good.

2189
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,400
That should open the door that leads into the main shaft.

2190
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,240
Uh.

2191
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:21,920
Uh.

2192
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:28,920
Uh, what am I to do?

2193
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:32,680
I'm not gonna go the wrong way, be honest.

2194
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,480
Okay, it's fine, you can be honest with me.

2195
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,080
Mummy needs no help finding the main shaft.

2196
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,480
On the main shaft.

2197
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:44,360
Main shaft, Minecraft, yeah, yeah.

2198
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:47,320
Mayday, mayday, drop ship Bravo 22, checking enemy fire.

2199
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:48,920
Repeat, we are under heavy fire,

2200
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,760
and we're moving out.

2201
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:51,400
So, I'm getting allies.

2202
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,400
I better get allies.

2203
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,520
On the hunt, we're on our way.

2204
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,880
I need help, and I need, stop it!

2205
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,080
Ah!

2206
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,360
No, no, no!

2207
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,160
Please, please, I don't have the ammo for this.

2208
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:01,320
Get me out of here, get me out of here.

2209
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,160
Oh!

2210
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:05,120
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

2211
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,560
I don't have the ammo for this.

2212
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:08,880
Well!

2213
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,200
I don't have the ammo, leave me alone.

2214
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,800
Uh, don't have teammates, leave me alone.

2215
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,120
Chief, Bravo 22 was bringing us out of heavy weapons.

2216
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,820
After I saw we were up against the creatures,

2217
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:20,040
I thought you could be here.

2218
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:20,880
I don't get in there.

2219
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:21,720
Let's move down the beach.

2220
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,920
Am I going crazy?

2221
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,320
Should I not come up here by walking down a frikin' side path?

2222
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:32,320
Where did I come from?

2223
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:37,320
Where did I come from?

2224
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,320
What do I do?

2225
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:47,320
I'm so turned around.

2226
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:50,320
I turn her voice up and then she's like, Stop!

2227
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,320
Don't turn me up.

2228
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:52,320
I'm not.

2229
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,320
I'm literally.

2230
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,320
I don't have munition.

2231
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,320
Can I just, can I just ignore?

2232
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:02,320
I'm ignoring.

2233
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,320
I'm not real.

2234
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,320
I'm not real.

2235
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,320
I'm not real.

2236
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:06,320
I'm not real.

2237
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,320
I'm not real.

2238
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:08,320
I'm not real.

2239
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,320
I'm actually just a figment of your imagination.

2240
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,320
Please!

2241
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,320
Please!

2242
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,320
Oh!

2243
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:14,320
Ray, I'm away.

2244
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,320
I'm away.

2245
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,320
I don't need to do this fight.

2246
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,320
I don't need to do the fight.

2247
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,320
I don't need to do the fight.

2248
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:23,320
I need my reclings either at the bottom of this hill waiting for me.

2249
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:29,320
Because you guys are in the war, Hulk.

2250
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:30,320
There you are.

2251
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,320
AI's locked.

2252
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,320
Okay, now we're done.

2253
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,320
I don't know.

2254
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:44,320
We've taken down the security set and so we're going back to that place we were at.

2255
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:47,320
I'm going to jump out and see if there's any more ammo.

2256
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:48,320
Don't mind me.

2257
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:51,320
I can flip this?

2258
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,320
Oh!

2259
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:56,320
That's rather impressive strength, I have to admit.

2260
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,320
I did it on my own.

2261
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:59,320
Wasn't there a rocket launcher?

2262
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:03,320
I'm just a Master Chief with a rocket launcher.

2263
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:23,320
Oh my god, yes!

2264
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:25,320
Run him over.

2265
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:26,320
Run him over.

2266
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,320
Out.

2267
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:31,320
Oh my god, he's Spanish.

2268
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,320
Can I?

2269
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:35,320
Oh, I did not just do that.

2270
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:37,320
I might have.

2271
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:38,320
You know what, fuck it.

2272
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:43,320
You guys just stay out here and watch my back from out here, okay?

2273
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2274
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,320
You guys just snipe and stuff.

2275
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:49,320
I'm just going to leave you to do it.

2276
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:51,320
You don't want the launcher?

2277
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:54,320
Have you not seen my issues with grenades recently?

2278
02:09:54,320 --> 02:10:00,320
I am already in enough trouble trying to survive the game alone.

2279
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,320
And you want me to mix in RPGs with that?

2280
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,320
With my aim and my panic?

2281
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:13,320
There'll be an enemy around the corner and I'll literally fire at them and perish myself.

2282
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:14,320
I've got the flu.

2283
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,320
Oh no, you won't feel good.

2284
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,320
You need chicken soup!

2285
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,320
I make chicken soups.

2286
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:24,320
I'll show you my technique.

2287
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,320
Right, what do I need now?

2288
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,320
Cutscene time!

2289
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,320
Okay, so there's supposed to be a light path.

2290
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:34,320
I can tell by the way they were doing that.

2291
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:37,320
Now what?

2292
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,320
You're the enemies.

2293
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,320
Do you think...

2294
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:47,320
Why are they giving me such big enemies on my own?

2295
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,320
I'm at...

2296
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,320
Stop, Reflins.

2297
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:56,320
Can money stream snipe me?

2298
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:57,320
I'm not being funny.

2299
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:59,320
My game, I'm scared!

2300
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,320
Why does it say I'm getting...

2301
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:03,320
Anyway, I start playing.

2302
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:09,320
I'm gonna have to pick up one of the alien weapons.

2303
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,320
I'm not caught out for this, okay?

2304
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,320
I'm scared gamer.

2305
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,320
I'm terrified.

2306
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:17,320
Okay, that was actually a really good snipe out.

2307
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:18,320
Nowhere though.

2308
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,320
It says there's someone there.

2309
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:23,320
Where?

2310
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:26,320
I'm getting trolled by things and whispering right where I'm supposed to go.

2311
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,320
Am I even supposed to be up here?

2312
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:34,320
3, 4, 3 ghillie spark is gonna be fun, okay?

2313
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,320
I'm gonna stop.

2314
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:40,320
They were kissing on the bridge and I just killed them.

2315
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,320
Checkpoint done.

2316
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,320
So I'm hazing the right way.

2317
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,320
Reflins!

2318
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,320
Back on stream.

2319
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:51,320
I don't know.

2320
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,320
I don't know.

2321
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,320
Stop!

2322
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,320
Oh my god, I hate these big guys.

2323
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,320
They're scaring me.

2324
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:09,320
How am I supposed to shoot their back?

2325
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,320
Stop it, not now.

2326
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:13,320
Literally.

2327
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:15,320
Okay, okay, uh-huh.

2328
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:17,320
Right, that's a bit much.

2329
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:19,320
Wouldn't be nice to me.

2330
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:24,320
I made it so much worse.

2331
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,320
Stop!

2332
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:27,320
Stop doing this!

2333
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:30,320
Stop it, you did it twice in a row.

2334
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:34,320
You literally did it twice in a row.

2335
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,320
I don't know what-

2336
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:41,320
What was the logic?

2337
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:44,320
What was the logic?

2338
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,320
I don't know what the logic was.

2339
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:50,320
I just kept throwing them.

2340
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,320
I went deaf.

2341
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,320
You scared me?

2342
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,320
I scared me!

2343
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,320
Go-

2344
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:03,320
So they don't go weird in kamikaze when I'm halfway across the map.

2345
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:04,320
No, go away.

2346
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,320
Leave me alone.

2347
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:08,320
You're actually scaring me.

2348
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,320
Right, good.

2349
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:13,320
The logic is to approach them menacingly.

2350
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,320
No, I'm doing it from halfway across the map.

2351
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,320
Get sniped.

2352
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,320
Ow, he sniped me.

2353
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,320
Oh my god, right.

2354
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,320
No, I shouldn't have learned what the fricking need button is.

2355
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,320
Now I'm doing it to myself.

2356
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,320
Literally.

2357
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,320
Should not have learned what the need button is.

2358
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,320
I honestly shouldn't have.

2359
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:30,320
Just avoid them.

2360
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,320
What do you mean avoid them?

2361
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,320
They're big.

2362
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,320
They're massive.

2363
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:36,320
They're humongous.

2364
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,320
What?

2365
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:39,320
Avoid them.

2366
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:41,320
What?

2367
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:45,320
They're like, how tall?

2368
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:49,320
Isn't Big John supposed to be like a billion feet tall as well?

2369
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,320
And they're still taller than me?

2370
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:57,320
Okay, not to brag or anything, but I have a hundred and eleven billets and one need.

2371
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:59,320
So it says one, one, one, one, one.

2372
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,320
Can you get inside?

2373
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,320
He didn't say what.

2374
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,320
They're closing in too fast.

2375
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,320
Negative.

2376
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:07,320
Chief, you can come down to the front.

2377
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,320
We'll keep them busy as long as we can.

2378
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,320
Give him a hell, Marine.

2379
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,320
You'll be in a tight spot if we don't get out of here before additional reinforcements.

2380
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:16,320
Oh, tight spot, Sam.

2381
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,320
Let's find that map.

2382
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:20,320
Okay, I don't want to use too much ammo.

2383
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,320
What did he say?

2384
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:31,320
I do like the grunts being weaker.

2385
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:35,320
Like, it makes me feel more confident when I'm going against enemies.

2386
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:37,320
He panicked into me.

2387
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,320
What?

2388
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:43,320
Wait, what?

2389
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:45,320
I'm getting a bit confuzzled, right?

2390
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:47,320
I've just came here.

2391
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:50,320
What he says they're four meters tall?

2392
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,320
I'm like a meter six.

2393
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,320
Rough.

2394
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,320
I heard that.

2395
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,320
I guess it's still, wait.

2396
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,320
Wait, hold on.

2397
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,320
Let me interact with this first.

2398
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,320
Hold on.

2399
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:11,320
Okay, checkpoint done.

2400
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:12,320
Yep, let me just...

2401
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,320
Oh, no, am I going to get shot at in the closet?

2402
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:19,320
Okay, I despawned them.

2403
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:20,320
Feels good.

2404
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,320
What the fuck is that meter?

2405
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,320
Master Chief is six foot ten.

2406
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,320
I can't even...

2407
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,320
It's not even why it's how.

2408
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,320
How is he six foot tall?

2409
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:36,320
The captain wants out of contact, Cortana.

2410
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:39,320
His ship may be out of range or having equipment problems.

2411
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:41,320
Alright, what do I do?

2412
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:43,320
Let me know when you re-establish contact.

2413
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,320
And then tell him that the Master Chief and I

2414
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:47,320
are at the location of the control center.

2415
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:49,320
The Master Chief and I?

2416
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,320
I can't get over that sentence, Doctor.

2417
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:53,320
I assume they dropped the ball.

2418
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:54,320
Affirmative. Fall hammer out.

2419
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:56,320
I've apparently...

2420
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,320
Hold on.

2421
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,320
What am I...

2422
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,320
What am I doing?

2423
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,320
Am I done? Can I come out?

2424
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:09,320
Now, this is absolutely...

2425
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:10,320
Wait, what?

2426
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:11,320
Oh, god.

2427
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:14,320
I get lost inside an enemy freaking...

2428
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,320
command post.

2429
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:19,320
Well, Master Chief is his rank.

2430
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:23,320
Oh, it's like saying the captain.

2431
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:25,320
Oh, the guard or...

2432
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:26,320
Oh, this or that.

2433
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:27,320
Oh, my god.

2434
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:29,320
Sorry, I'm so turned around right now.

2435
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:31,320
I don't even know how to get up.

2436
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:35,320
Oh, my god, the music's so intense

2437
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:37,320
and I'm literally just straight up stuck.

2438
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:39,320
There's nothing intense about this.

2439
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,320
I'm just trying to...

2440
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,320
try to backtrack successfully

2441
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,320
because I'm too dumb to figure out.

2442
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:51,320
Literally, why is the guitar doing a solo?

2443
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:53,320
I can't even get out.

2444
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,320
I'm so lost.

2445
02:16:57,320 --> 02:17:00,320
This place is, like, unending as well,

2446
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:02,320
which doesn't help.

2447
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:04,320
I'm just go...

2448
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:05,320
I'm just pressing W.

2449
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,320
I think it's this way.

2450
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:08,320
I came, I don't know.

2451
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:10,320
Oh, my god, no.

2452
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:11,320
Why is it taking me down?

2453
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:12,320
Did I come up?

2454
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:14,320
I don't know.

2455
02:17:15,320 --> 02:17:16,320
Okay, I don't...

2456
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:18,320
I don't know if I came this way or not.

2457
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:23,320
Directionally challenged, honestly, though.

2458
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,320
I've just done a 360.

2459
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:26,320
Oh, my god, wait.

2460
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:28,320
Right, I see a corridor.

2461
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:32,320
Right, I've got this corridor.

2462
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,320
No, this is taking me down.

2463
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:34,320
I went up.

2464
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,320
Wait, ooh, what are you?

2465
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:38,320
Hicked up active camouflage?

2466
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:40,320
Don't mind if I do.

2467
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:43,320
Time to melee with this banger on, honestly.

2468
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:49,320
Wait, where did I come from?

2469
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,320
Oh, do I need to go up?

2470
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,320
Hold on, hold on.

2471
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:56,320
Where am I going?

2472
02:17:57,320 --> 02:17:58,320
Okay, go up.

2473
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,320
Up is where I need to go.

2474
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:00,320
Okay, that's good.

2475
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,320
Progress, progress.

2476
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:06,320
I'm just following what the gun says.

2477
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:07,320
The gun's pointing here.

2478
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,320
Okay, well, I tried.

2479
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,320
Mm-hmm.

2480
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:17,320
What?

2481
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,320
What?

2482
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:22,320
I'm so sorry.

2483
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,320
Right, I think it's this way,

2484
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:29,320
because the enemy's one here.

2485
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,320
Okay.

2486
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,320
Okay, I think.

2487
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:35,320
Okay, I got checkpoint.

2488
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:37,320
Progress, progress.

2489
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:38,320
Come on.

2490
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:41,320
It's really gone if you stop.

2491
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,320
The gun pointer isn't a navigator.

2492
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,320
What is it for?

2493
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:50,320
The arrow points to threshold,

2494
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:51,320
not objective.

2495
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:53,320
What's the threshold?

2496
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:00,320
I thought the threshold was

2497
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:03,320
where the living room becomes the kitchen.

2498
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:07,320
And there's like a little bit of straw,

2499
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:09,320
and then it's called the threshold.

2500
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:11,320
Go away.

2501
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:13,320
Right, I think I'm going to make it.

2502
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:16,320
I don't know how, but I'm going to make it.

2503
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:18,320
Okay.

2504
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,320
What is it?

2505
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,320
Okay, we're doing it.

2506
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:27,320
We're going upstairs.

2507
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,320
What?

2508
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:29,320
Almost there.

2509
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,320
Am I first throwing out names?

2510
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:33,320
Like, is there any idea what they mean?

2511
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,320
Literally, please talk to me.

2512
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:38,320
Like, I'm just, I'm newly spawned on Earth,

2513
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,320
and I'm just here for a good time.

2514
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:42,320
I'm just going to keep going up.

2515
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:44,320
That's literally the only thing I'm focusing on.

2516
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:47,320
Let's go upwards, in an upwards motion.

2517
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:53,320
Unless there's nothing else to do in the upwards motion,

2518
02:19:55,320 --> 02:20:01,320
then we will go retrace our steps to the next level.

2519
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:05,320
Okay, there's enemy here.

2520
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:06,320
That's a good sign.

2521
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:08,320
This looks near.

2522
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,320
Oh my goodness.

2523
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:18,320
Can I have that?

2524
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:19,320
No, I can.

2525
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:21,320
Where did it go?

2526
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,320
Red.

2527
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,320
Red, I wanted it.

2528
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:27,320
I wanted it, I wanted it.

2529
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:30,320
He needs to give me what I want, okay?

2530
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:33,320
Not until Halo 2.

2531
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:37,320
Oh, and Halo 1, they didn't let you have it,

2532
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:40,320
but they coded it in the game.

2533
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:46,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

2534
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:48,320
What is that?

2535
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:50,320
Where's my...

2536
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:52,320
I may have killed my Warthog,

2537
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,320
because we're the heck are my allies.

2538
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:58,320
I don't know where my allies are, they're gone.

2539
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,320
They're gone to Spain, they didn't like me.

2540
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,320
What am I doing?

2541
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:04,320
Thanks for the funny spree-

2542
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:05,320
Funny!

2543
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:07,320
This is the worst gameplay!

2544
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:16,320
Literally!

2545
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:21,320
Thank you, M&S, for the kind words and the super chat.

2546
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:24,320
I kid you not, you're looking at this with rose-tinted glasses.

2547
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:28,320
This is the worst gameplay in the world.

2548
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:31,320
Literally, have a good rest, but oh my gosh,

2549
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:34,320
have you got rose-tinted glasses on?

2550
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:37,320
They didn't have time to finish the story.

2551
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:46,320
Honeycomb!

2552
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:50,320
This is peaky gameplay, are you kidding me?

2553
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:53,320
I'm literally getting jump-scared in corridors,

2554
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:55,320
because it's dark.

2555
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:59,320
This isn't the worst gameplay, this is nostalgia and carnage.

2556
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:00,320
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2557
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:02,320
I'll take your word for it,

2558
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:05,320
but I'm freaking ridiculous with this.

2559
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:08,320
For our same plane, Halo blind is a great gameplay.

2560
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:11,320
Halo ESL ranked win.

2561
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:13,320
What's ESL ranked?

2562
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:16,320
Mummy's strong points are her 10 points in the app,

2563
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,320
and gaming's just the extra!

2564
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:21,320
Honestly, thank god I don't know how to app.

2565
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:22,320
I'd be over.

2566
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:24,320
Is it over for me as a streamer?

2567
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:25,320
Pretty much.

2568
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,320
After this gameplay?

2569
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:28,320
Yeah, diabolical.

2570
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:32,320
I don't even know what breakdown is.

2571
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:34,320
What video game's breakdown?

2572
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:36,320
Break it down now.

2573
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:41,320
Why is my tracking just died randomly?

2574
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:43,320
Stop! I wasn't asleep!

2575
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:45,320
Hold on, I'm re-calculating.

2576
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:49,320
Red, don't...

2577
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:51,320
Halo?

2578
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:53,320
V-Trip...

2579
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:56,320
V-Trip Studio?

2580
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:58,320
Is it the game?

2581
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,320
Is it the game, be honest?

2582
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:04,320
I've been lagging out this whole time and have no idea

2583
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:07,320
if I'm typically trying to not die in this game.

2584
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:10,320
Okay, see this on the floor?

2585
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:13,320
Little pointers to tell me where to go.

2586
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:14,320
Gorgeous.

2587
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:16,320
I'll have 20 more of them.

2588
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:18,320
I'll have 20 more of them.

2589
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:21,320
Your gameplay is always peak.

2590
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:23,320
You don't have to be good, mama.

2591
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:24,320
Just be yourself.

2592
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:27,320
Aw, thank you, the Z-Lords.

2593
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:29,320
Very kind of you, see?

2594
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:31,320
Yeah, you like when I start screaming

2595
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:34,320
because I accidentally kamikaze the big hunter

2596
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,320
right in my muffy.

2597
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:39,320
Yeah, you like that game.

2598
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,320
Rub it all over you.

2599
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:46,320
Oh my god, I'm loving this melee.

2600
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:48,320
Sorry, they should make a melee game.

2601
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:51,320
Where you're like, but not like a ninja type of melee.

2602
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:53,320
Like, it's just, it's melee.

2603
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:55,320
That's the gameplay.

2604
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:57,320
It's melee and around everywhere.

2605
02:23:57,320 --> 02:23:59,320
Aw, he was asleep!

2606
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:03,320
I wonder if the rings environment systems are malfunctioning.

2607
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:05,320
Or if the designers wanted the installation

2608
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:07,320
to have inclement weather.

2609
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:10,320
Oh my god, I'm playing Assassin's Creed.

2610
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:13,320
I'm literally playing Assassin's Creed right now.

2611
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:20,320
I didn't even know they had stealth in this game.

2612
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:22,320
What the heck?

2613
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:27,320
They had stealth this entire time.

2614
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:29,320
Oh!

2615
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,320
Don't do that!

2616
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:35,320
I didn't even know glass could break in 2001 games.

2617
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:37,320
What the heck?

2618
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,320
Bro.

2619
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:40,320
This is so well coded.

2620
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:41,320
What the heck?

2621
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:43,320
I'm so impressed by the dev theme.

2622
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:45,320
I'm sorry, I really am.

2623
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:49,320
I'm just so, stop it.

2624
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:52,320
I'm just so impressed with like everything they've done.

2625
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:55,320
You saw an act of ammo?

2626
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:56,320
Did that?

2627
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:01,320
Aw, I guess I never put toot-toots together.

2628
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,320
I mean, when did I ever, but...

2629
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:05,320
Please don't go on that.

2630
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:07,320
He's got the sword!

2631
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:09,320
I'm sorry, please forgive.

2632
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:11,320
Okay, I'm sorry, hold on a minute.

2633
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:12,320
Reload!

2634
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:14,320
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2635
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:16,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2636
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,320
All right, Dagnabbit, hold on.

2637
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:21,320
Oh my god, please don't do that again.

2638
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:25,320
Stop it, stop it.

2639
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:27,320
No, we're not going on the gunner.

2640
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:32,320
You did well to stay stealth as long as you did there.

2641
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,320
Time out, time out, time out.

2642
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:38,320
Literally everyone backed off of my master chief.

2643
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:43,320
Does he have a pintas?

2644
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:46,320
Or is that in sense for me to ask?

2645
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,320
I don't know, does he have one?

2646
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,320
Because isn't he like super strong and stuff?

2647
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,320
Wouldn't he like split someone apart?

2648
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:55,320
Would his pintas...

2649
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:58,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, not to be a weirdo,

2650
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:00,320
but because he's super strong, right?

2651
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:02,320
Wouldn't that make...

2652
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:03,320
What?

2653
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:04,320
Tracking, please!

2654
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:06,320
My tracking keeps saying I'm asleep,

2655
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:08,320
but I'm like literally looking point...

2656
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,320
I don't know what's going on with my model, hold on.

2657
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:13,320
Right, hold on, hold on, pause.

2658
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:14,320
What's going on?

2659
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,320
Why are you asleep?

2660
02:26:15,320 --> 02:26:17,320
I'm literally looking point blank.

2661
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:19,320
Can you not see me, OBS?

2662
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:20,320
Right, OBS can see me.

2663
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:22,320
What about you, VTuber Studio?

2664
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:23,320
What's going on with you?

2665
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,320
Wake up.

2666
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:27,320
It's the first of the month, VTuber Studio.

2667
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,320
Don't put me to sleep again, you understand?

2668
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:31,320
I'm looking point blank at this game.

2669
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:34,320
I'm looking point blank at this game.

2670
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:36,320
What do you mean I'm asleep?

2671
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:38,320
Stop it.

2672
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:40,320
Stop it.

2673
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:44,320
I'm looking point blank at the game.

2674
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:46,320
Point blank.

2675
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:48,320
Don't do that again.

2676
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,320
Hold on, let me recalibrate,

2677
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:51,320
but I don't know why I'm in trouble.

2678
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:53,320
Considering we're playing on the old graphics,

2679
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:55,320
I'm recalibrating.

2680
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:57,320
Okay.

2681
02:26:57,320 --> 02:26:59,320
If it keeps lagging out like that,

2682
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:01,320
and putting me to sleep when I'm asleep,

2683
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,320
when I'm awake, it's getting a spanking.

2684
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:04,320
It's like, where am I to go?

2685
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,320
Inside the arena?

2686
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:13,320
Okay.

2687
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:16,320
I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go,

2688
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:17,320
but we're learning.

2689
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:18,320
Are you asleep playing?

2690
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,320
Yeah, I was literally asleep the whole time.

2691
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:23,320
I don't know why it was acting like I'm asleep.

2692
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:25,320
Wait, I can't sleep.

2693
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:29,320
Nope, I'm too big.

2694
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,320
Oh my god, I love the glass bracing.

2695
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:36,320
Any glass?

2696
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:38,320
Wow.

2697
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,320
Whoa.

2698
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:43,320
Secret?

2699
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:45,320
No.

2700
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,320
Just design.

2701
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:47,320
Okay, sorry.

2702
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:49,320
I thought that was a secret.

2703
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:52,320
Gaming and yapping in her sleep while I'm one absolute legend.

2704
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:54,320
I'm just letting her do it.

2705
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:56,320
We're on a lift.

2706
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,320
She started his Spartan career at 7,

2707
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:01,320
and is 41 at the end of this game,

2708
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,320
if I remember.

2709
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:06,320
Legendary while asleep, exactly.

2710
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:09,320
I think the process of becoming a Spartan rex

2711
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:11,320
is reproductive system.

2712
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:13,320
Oh my god.

2713
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:15,320
He doesn't have any swimmers?

2714
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,320
Oh no.

2715
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:19,320
What happened to Reggie?

2716
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:21,320
Where are my resticles?

2717
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:25,320
What's the name of the captain again?

2718
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:29,320
I forgot.

2719
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:31,320
Whatever the name of the captain is,

2720
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,320
when Master Chief wakes up on the other side,

2721
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:35,320
Captain, where are my resticles?

2722
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,320
That looks cool.

2723
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:41,320
Why do they have to be yoink to turn them into a thing?

2724
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:45,320
He's got a lot of people first, that's so cute.

2725
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:51,320
You know what it feels like?

2726
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:53,320
I'm playing whack-a-mole right now.

2727
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:55,320
I'm really enjoying this.

2728
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:57,320
This is so cute.

2729
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:59,320
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

2730
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:01,320
Boom.

2731
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:03,320
Okay, give them a little spritz,

2732
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:05,320
and then we boom up.

2733
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:07,320
Because you're normally too hip.

2734
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:09,320
Stop dodging!

2735
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:11,320
We're there.

2736
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:23,320
I'm loving it.

2737
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:25,320
Thank you, Reverse.

2738
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:27,320
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

2739
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:31,320
It feels like I'm playing a really fun game of whack-a-mole.

2740
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:35,320
Where's the heck are we?

2741
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:39,320
Oh no, what are you shooting at?

2742
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:41,320
What's with that?

2743
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:43,320
Oh my god, it's a ray!

2744
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:49,320
How did I deal with the Is there a rocket launcher?

2745
02:29:49,320 --> 02:29:51,320
Give me that right now.

2746
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:53,320
Give me that right now.

2747
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:55,320
Give me the rocket launcher because there is a ray.

2748
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:57,320
There is a ray!

2749
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,320
No!

2750
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:03,320
You know what?

2751
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,320
The hit and run is really fun when it's not against me.

2752
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:07,320
Don't do that again.

2753
02:30:07,320 --> 02:30:09,320
What the heck?

2754
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:11,320
A ghost just took me out.

2755
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:13,320
Bruh.

2756
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:15,320
That was a ghost that just sidelined me

2757
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:17,320
whilst I was trying to deal with the freaking ray.

2758
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:19,320
Bruh.

2759
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:21,320
Right, that better not happen again.

2760
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:23,320
Or someone's getting in trouble.

2761
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,320
Oh my god, please.

2762
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:27,320
Where's the ray?

2763
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:29,320
Here he comes again.

2764
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:31,320
He is coming in the corner.

2765
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:33,320
He is coming in the corner.

2766
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:37,320
Can I use this?

2767
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:39,320
Oh no, I can't.

2768
02:30:41,320 --> 02:30:43,320
See you UV Bounce Prime.

2769
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:45,320
Oh my god, the wraith is scaring me.

2770
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:47,320
Wraiths are really scary

2771
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:49,320
and

2772
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:51,320
can it?

2773
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:53,320
I only have tanks too?

2774
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:57,320
Oh, I'm not sure.

2775
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:59,320
I'm not sure.

2776
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,320
I'm not sure.

2777
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:03,320
I don't know if it's a good idea

2778
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:05,320
to fucking walk near it

2779
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:07,320
but I kinda need to be able to hit it.

2780
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:11,320
And that wraith is really hammering them.

2781
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:15,320
It's good to hammer me.

2782
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,320
Fuck it, fuck it. If we die, fuck it, we both.

2783
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:23,320
Eh?

2784
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:25,320
It takes two to kill.

2785
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:27,320
Okay, understood, understood, understood.

2786
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:29,320
Two to kill.

2787
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:31,320
Bueno amigos.

2788
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:33,320
Bueno amigos.

2789
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:35,320
Bueno amigos.

2790
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:37,320
Buenos noches.

2791
02:31:39,320 --> 02:31:41,320
¿Dónde está la ugre?

2792
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:43,320
¿Dónde está la biblioteca?

2793
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:45,320
That's the best I got for Estangles.

2794
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,320
Nice shot.

2795
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:51,320
Oh yeah.

2796
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,320
Master Chief.

2797
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:05,320
No more wraiths, okay?

2798
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:07,320
I'm getting scared.

2799
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:09,320
I can handle jackals.

2800
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:11,320
I can handle ghosts for wraiths.

2801
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:13,320
Make me nervous.

2802
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:15,320
Make me...

2803
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:17,320
Okay, I guess.

2804
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:21,320
Can you guys jump down?

2805
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:23,320
Am I supposed to be in the warthog right now?

2806
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:25,320
Spanish approval?

2807
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:27,320
I'm so sorry.

2808
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:29,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2809
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,320
I heard bad noises, okay?

2810
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:35,320
No!

2811
02:32:35,320 --> 02:32:37,320
No, I can't get in!

2812
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:41,320
Oh my god.

2813
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:43,320
Everyone climb aboard on the victory wagon.

2814
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,320
Do you want on the other side?

2815
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:49,320
Are you coming on the other side?

2816
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:51,320
Oh my god.

2817
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:53,320
I'm so...

2818
02:32:57,320 --> 02:32:59,320
If you die, you can just say you fell asleep.

2819
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:01,320
Real.

2820
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:03,320
Oh my god.

2821
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:05,320
Tank mission.

2822
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:11,320
Right, you guys need to reload a bit faster.

2823
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:13,320
But otherwise...

2824
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,320
I missed.

2825
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:25,320
He did a backflip on us.

2826
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:27,320
Oh, I missed.

2827
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:29,320
Okay, hold on.

2828
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:33,320
There's a wraith!

2829
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:35,320
There's a wraith.

2830
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:37,320
Can you reload?

2831
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:39,320
There's a wraith.

2832
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:41,320
Oh my god, please.

2833
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:45,320
Can you guys deal with the jackal and the ghost whilst I deal with a literal wraith

2834
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:47,320
that is aiming at us?

2835
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:51,320
Sorry for being so stressed,

2836
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:55,320
but you guys are the worst aimers I've ever seen.

2837
02:33:59,320 --> 02:34:01,320
Oh my god, I love the tank.

2838
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,320
We're in the panther!

2839
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:05,320
Hello, Lighter.

2840
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:07,320
Today we are in the panther,

2841
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:11,320
and we are going to annihilate the panther.

2842
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:13,320
Yes.

2843
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,320
As you can see,

2844
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:17,320
the aliens kindly constructed

2845
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:19,320
the corridors nice and big.

2846
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:21,320
Let me in!

2847
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:23,320
Why am I not allowed in?

2848
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:29,320
I'm stuck.

2849
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,320
Hold on, you guys.

2850
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:35,320
Hello?

2851
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:37,320
Knock knock, let me in!

2852
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:39,320
Is that not where I'm supposed to go?

2853
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:43,320
Touch on...

2854
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:45,320
Sorry, my tracking is really having a hard time with this.

2855
02:34:45,320 --> 02:34:47,320
I think there's a frame rate in the fridge or something.

2856
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:49,320
You need to open the door by hand.

2857
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:51,320
Oh.

2858
02:34:51,320 --> 02:34:53,320
Oh!

2859
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:55,320
No way!

2860
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:57,320
Oh come on, don't be so silly.

2861
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:01,320
Are you guys putting on the other side?

2862
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:03,320
Or...

2863
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:07,320
Bro, imagine getting out of a...

2864
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:09,320
Are you coming or are you just going to stay there?

2865
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:11,320
It's up to you.

2866
02:35:11,320 --> 02:35:13,320
You just stay there, we're fine.

2867
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:15,320
Literally...

2868
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:17,320
Imagine getting out of a big old tank.

2869
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:19,320
Everyone getting off only two seconds later.

2870
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:21,320
Ooh, those speed bumps for the tank.

2871
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:23,320
The scorpions holding it together nicely.

2872
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:27,320
Oh, buh buh buh buh!

2873
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:33,320
Oh, I have like a secondary fire as well.

2874
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:37,320
Okay.

2875
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:39,320
Okay, that didn't work.

2876
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:41,320
Hold on.

2877
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:43,320
Let's do it!

2878
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:45,320
Okay.

2879
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:49,320
Oh my god, it can like...

2880
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:51,320
It can't see?

2881
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:53,320
Get on the...

2882
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:55,320
Floor!

2883
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:57,320
I can't floor it, we're in a tank!

2884
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:01,320
Right, you guys need to start shooting because what is going on?

2885
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:07,320
We ain't going to make it if you guys are acting like this.

2886
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:09,320
I need my shields to regen.

2887
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:13,320
Okay, it's regening.

2888
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:17,320
Oh.

2889
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:19,320
Wait, we're not to go here.

2890
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:21,320
Sorry!

2891
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:23,320
Beep, beep, beep, beep!

2892
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:25,320
We're not supposed to go here.

2893
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:27,320
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2894
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:29,320
Okay, we're all in the tank.

2895
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:31,320
Okay, okay.

2896
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:33,320
Okay, now...

2897
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:35,320
Oh my god, I can't see, bro.

2898
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:39,320
Please.

2899
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:43,320
Okay, stop, right.

2900
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:45,320
Hold on, hold on.

2901
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:47,320
See, because none of you jump off and open the freaking door,

2902
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:49,320
we can't floor it.

2903
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:51,320
Do you understand me?

2904
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:53,320
If one of yous were kind enough to actually open...

2905
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:55,320
I can't floor it, you're not all in.

2906
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:01,320
Right, there.

2907
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:03,320
Okay, let's go.

2908
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:05,320
Why are there six pedals, bro?

2909
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:07,320
Me, honestly.

2910
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:09,320
Technically, they can't use the doors

2911
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:11,320
because of lore reasons.

2912
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:13,320
They can't even go beep,

2913
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:15,320
and then swipe out a pass key.

2914
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:23,320
That was rather strange.

2915
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:31,320
Oh my god, that perg run on his own.

2916
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:35,320
Okay, let's make our way up here.

2917
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:37,320
And annihilate the jackals on the way.

2918
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:53,320
I can't destroy the ship.

2919
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:57,320
Because that would be too easy.

2920
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:59,320
Okay.

2921
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:03,320
As if you dropped that into the wind.

2922
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:13,320
I can't even be arsed with the

2923
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:15,320
the ship firing at me if I can't

2924
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:17,320
need damage to it.

2925
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:19,320
Can you be...

2926
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:23,320
Run versus a tank.

2927
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:25,320
Oh no!

2928
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:29,320
What does that mean?

2929
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:31,320
Yeah, hombre.

2930
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:37,320
I love doing what the...

2931
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:39,320
voiceline.

2932
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:43,320
Is that a ray?

2933
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:47,320
It was!

2934
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:49,320
Are we...

2935
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:51,320
Are we to go in there?

2936
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:55,320
Are we to just keep going?

2937
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:57,320
I missed.

2938
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:59,320
Is this just a dead end?

2939
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:01,320
No.

2940
02:39:01,320 --> 02:39:03,320
Off of music.

2941
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:11,320
Okay, I missed. Hold on.

2942
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:15,320
Okay, I missed again.

2943
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:17,320
Okay, if this is just a dead end...

2944
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:19,320
Wait, it's not...

2945
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,320
I can't actually miss him.

2946
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:25,320
Okay, we're definitely to go inside

2947
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:27,320
that little entrance way thing

2948
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:29,320
that I saw.

2949
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:31,320
I'm gonna just leave you guys out here.

2950
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:33,320
You can come with me if you want.

2951
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:35,320
You don't have to. I mean, I'd like you to.

2952
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:37,320
But it's okay if you don't want to.

2953
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:39,320
We're gonna do something in here.

2954
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:41,320
I don't know what it is.

2955
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:43,320
Hmm...

2956
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:45,320
Hmm...

2957
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:47,320
There's something up here.

2958
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:49,320
It says red on my minimap.

2959
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:53,320
Oh!

2960
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:55,320
Whoa!

2961
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:57,320
Just say you don't want to live,

2962
02:39:57,320 --> 02:39:59,320
because, bruv, why are you letting that happen to you?

2963
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:01,320
What's this one?

2964
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:03,320
It is.

2965
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:05,320
Okay, we came in here.

2966
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:07,320
Oh, sorry!

2967
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:09,320
I'm sorry.

2968
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:11,320
Whoa!

2969
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:13,320
Wait, did I just drop the tank for no reason?

2970
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:15,320
I think I did.

2971
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:17,320
Where am I supposed to go?

2972
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:23,320
There's nothing to do in there, right?

2973
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:27,320
You were going the right way with the wraith.

2974
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:29,320
Okay, everyone back in the tank.

2975
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:31,320
Go back through the building and in the tank.

2976
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:33,320
Mommy's a bit slow.

2977
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:35,320
Okay, mommy's a bit slow.

2978
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:37,320
Apparently it is behind the wraith, but I'm dumb.

2979
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:39,320
Just the camel for fun, dude.

2980
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:41,320
Right, okay, everyone back in the tank.

2981
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:43,320
And you come.

2982
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:45,320
And you come, reflins.

2983
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:47,320
Make sure you take your motion sickness, okay?

2984
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:49,320
All right, there you go.

2985
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:51,320
Yep, good, good boy.

2986
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:53,320
Oh, you're so good, aren't you?

2987
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:01,320
He was stuck on it!

2988
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:03,320
Okay, that wasn't men!

2989
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:05,320
He was stuck on it.

2990
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:07,320
He wasn't a real reflin anyway.

2991
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:09,320
It's fine.

2992
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:11,320
He wasn't a real reflin.

2993
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:13,320
And, not being funny,

2994
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:15,320
I reversed, so he walked into death.

2995
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:17,320
Is it behind there?

2996
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:19,320
Right, how was I supposed to see that?

2997
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:21,320
That's it.

2998
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:23,320
They're getting...

2999
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:25,320
They're getting a strongly worded letter.

3000
02:41:27,320 --> 02:41:29,320
After a shenanigan like that,

3001
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:31,320
reflin card revolt, literally fake reflin.

3002
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:37,320
Oh, my God.

3003
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:39,320
That's the second aim at that.

3004
02:41:43,320 --> 02:41:45,320
Ooh, really do not want to go flying off the road.

3005
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:49,320
Can I?

3006
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:55,320
Oh, my God!

3007
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:57,320
How are we supposed to, like...

3008
02:41:57,320 --> 02:41:59,320
Ooh, careful!

3009
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:01,320
Yeah, maybe don't go in front of the tank

3010
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:03,320
when I'm the driver.

3011
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:05,320
Do we want to start using our brains a little?

3012
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:07,320
Yeah?

3013
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:09,320
It's called not walking in front

3014
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:11,320
of the moving tank, okay?

3015
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:13,320
Especially while

3016
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:15,320
strongy chief is the one who's driving it.

3017
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:19,320
Little sausages.

3018
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:23,320
Who's your daddy now?

3019
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:25,320
Daddy.

3020
02:42:25,320 --> 02:42:27,320
Okay, let's go inside.

3021
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:29,320
Whatever this is.

3022
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:35,320
Okay.

3023
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:39,320
Okay.

3024
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:43,320
Are you okay?

3025
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:45,320
The music is bumping

3026
02:42:45,320 --> 02:42:47,320
in this game.

3027
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:53,320
Ooh, I see a platform.

3028
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:01,320
We're coming. We're saving you.

3029
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:03,320
We're saving you.

3030
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:05,320
We're saving you.

3031
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:07,320
Easy peasy.

3032
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:11,320
I like how the grunts actually get scared.

3033
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:13,320
When you kill, like, a bigger one,

3034
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:15,320
the grunts get scared and they're like,

3035
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:17,320
oh, let me still do that.

3036
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:19,320
Get out of that.

3037
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:21,320
Oh, my God, I almost got ran over by a freaking ghost again.

3038
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:23,320
Go away.

3039
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,320
Can I just go in this?

3040
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:27,320
Oh, I can!

3041
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:29,320
Eat lead, motherfuckers!

3042
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:33,320
I feel like I should not.

3043
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:37,320
Oh, my God, I have to judge the bullet distance

3044
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:39,320
though.

3045
02:43:39,320 --> 02:43:41,320
Oh, no.

3046
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:43,320
Oh, come on. I have like a one in three chance

3047
02:43:43,320 --> 02:43:45,320
of it hitting. Come on.

3048
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:47,320
No way. Come on.

3049
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:49,320
I have a one in three chance.

3050
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:51,320
Oh, no!

3051
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:53,320
Okay, there we go.

3052
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:55,320
We did it.

3053
02:43:55,320 --> 02:43:57,320
I'm going to spray that one.

3054
02:43:57,320 --> 02:43:59,320
I don't know.

3055
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:01,320
The accuracy is pretty rough.

3056
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:07,320
I only know that from Conqueror Mayford.

3057
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:09,320
I know.

3058
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:11,320
I know.

3059
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:17,320
Five missions in it.

3060
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:19,320
She's just making the...

3061
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:21,320
Well, excuse me.

3062
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:23,320
Sorry, did I interrupt your listening session?

3063
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:25,320
No, you can't kiss each other anymore

3064
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:27,320
on the lips.

3065
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:31,320
One.

3066
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:33,320
Shhh.

3067
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:37,320
Shhh.

3068
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:39,320
They're going to sleep.

3069
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:41,320
They're going to sleep

3070
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:43,320
like this.

3071
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:45,320
He's coming!

3072
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:47,320
Roughly

3073
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:49,320
going to sleep.

3074
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:51,320
Shhh.

3075
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:53,320
Shhh.

3076
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:55,320
They don't know.

3077
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:57,320
Soft lips.

3078
02:44:57,320 --> 02:44:59,320
Soft pants.

3079
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:01,320
The interlocking mouth feeding.

3080
02:45:01,320 --> 02:45:03,320
Baby Birdie.

3081
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:05,320
They got split lips,

3082
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:07,320
but I don't think they're species kiss.

3083
02:45:09,320 --> 02:45:11,320
You just give that...

3084
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:15,320
You woke up the babies!

3085
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:17,320
No need to put them down.

3086
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:19,320
The poor little grunts.

3087
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:21,320
They didn't deserve this.

3088
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:23,320
They could have...

3089
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:25,320
They could have known peace

3090
02:45:25,320 --> 02:45:27,320
before their demise,

3091
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:29,320
but no, no, no.

3092
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:31,320
You had to go and ruin it.

3093
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:33,320
Now they're all scared and worried

3094
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:35,320
as they're getting perished

3095
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:37,320
and exterminated.

3096
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:39,320
Come on.

3097
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:41,320
You could have been nice, but no.

3098
02:45:41,320 --> 02:45:43,320
And now I'm the bad guy.

3099
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:45,320
That's right, make me

3100
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:47,320
cry.

3101
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:49,320
Where do I go?

3102
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:51,320
Don't actually know

3103
02:45:51,320 --> 02:45:53,320
where I'm supposed to go.

3104
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:57,320
Stop it.

3105
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:59,320
See, now they're pleading for their literal life.

3106
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:05,320
Oh my god, I love the arrows on the floor.

3107
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:07,320
Please, give me more of that.

3108
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:09,320
How come they didn't have that at the start?

3109
02:46:09,320 --> 02:46:11,320
Or maybe they were already there.

3110
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:13,320
Oh, elevator time.

3111
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:15,320
I'm on a lift.

3112
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:17,320
I'm on a lift.

3113
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:19,320
Can you jump?

3114
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:21,320
Oh, you can jump on the lift?

3115
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:25,320
What the hell? Where are we going?

3116
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:27,320
To the bloody command center?

3117
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:29,320
I thought we were under

3118
02:46:29,320 --> 02:46:31,320
a ground.

3119
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:33,320
Underground.

3120
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,320
Right, what is in here?

3121
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:39,320
A few fallen heroes.

3122
02:46:39,320 --> 02:46:41,320
But it means I can scavenge

3123
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:43,320
off of them. Thanks mate, appreciate it.

3124
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:45,320
Your life was not in vain

3125
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,320
because I had you.

3126
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:51,320
Bumped.

3127
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:53,320
I'm chasing them down

3128
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:55,320
like a horror movie.

3129
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:57,320
Oh, that perk run.

3130
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:01,320
Literally chasing them down

3131
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:03,320
like a horror film.

3132
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:05,320
I'm so sorry.

3133
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:07,320
I'm so sorry.

3134
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:09,320
I'm like making them all prefer.

3135
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:11,320
Thank you.

3136
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:13,320
Joan Omni.

3137
02:47:13,320 --> 02:47:15,320
Stop.

3138
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,320
By the way, I never said thank you.

3139
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:21,320
Apparently

3140
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:23,320
to go out already?

3141
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:25,320
No.

3142
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:27,320
Bunk.

3143
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:29,320
Bunk.

3144
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:31,320
Bunk.

3145
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:35,320
Bunk.

3146
02:47:35,320 --> 02:47:37,320
Bunk.

3147
02:47:37,320 --> 02:47:39,320
I can't bunk these guys.

3148
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:41,320
But I like the bunk mechanic.

3149
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:43,320
Bunk.

3150
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:45,320
Bunk.

3151
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:47,320
Bunk.

3152
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:49,320
Bunk.

3153
02:47:53,320 --> 02:47:55,320
Bunk.

3154
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:03,320
I love this game.

3155
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:05,320
Oh my god, I love this game.

3156
02:48:05,320 --> 02:48:07,320
Come here, Bunk.

3157
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:09,320
Come here, Bunk.

3158
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:11,320
No, I miss Bunk.

3159
02:48:11,320 --> 02:48:13,320
Bunk.

3160
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:15,320
Bunk.

3161
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:17,320
I guess it's because

3162
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:19,320
I have such inhuman strength

3163
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:21,320
that I'm like strong enough to bunk.

3164
02:48:23,320 --> 02:48:25,320
I was gone for 15 minutes

3165
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:27,320
and got thanked by Momy.

3166
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:29,320
You gave me a super chevrolet.

3167
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:31,320
I forgot to thank you by name.

3168
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:33,320
I've been really bad at doing that recently.

3169
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:35,320
I don't know why.

3170
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:37,320
I think it's just because I'm

3171
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:39,320
getting used to going and just

3172
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:41,320
like, oh, reefing.

3173
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:43,320
Whoop.

3174
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:45,320
I'm going to do that.

3175
02:48:45,320 --> 02:48:47,320
There's an arrow pointing here, though.

3176
02:48:47,320 --> 02:48:49,320
Errrrr.

3177
02:48:49,320 --> 02:48:51,320
Is there a gun that does that

3178
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:53,320
in this game?

3179
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:55,320
Or is this

3180
02:48:55,320 --> 02:48:57,320
going to be an assault rifle?

3181
02:48:57,320 --> 02:48:59,960
It's just kind of, it's an assault rifle.

3182
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:04,640
Little light machine gun, maybe a heavy machine gun.

3183
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:07,880
Bonk, bonk, bonk.

3184
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:09,200
Ah!

3185
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:10,040
Okay, okay, okay.

3186
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:11,760
I'm baiting off more than I can chew.

3187
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:12,880
I'm baiting off more than I can chew.

3188
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:14,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3189
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,520
I'm baiting off more than I can chew.

3190
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,320
I'm getting too excited to bonk.

3191
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:22,520
The halo rifle is a stove.

3192
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:24,320
Okay, okay, assault rifle, got it.

3193
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:28,560
Let's just spray and pray.

3194
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:31,160
Again, you know what I'm saying?

3195
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:33,080
I have no idea, I'm gonna be honest.

3196
02:49:33,080 --> 02:49:35,200
I don't know what the mission objective is.

3197
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:37,840
I'm just, ooh, arrow on floor.

3198
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,560
Ooh, enemies that I've not dealt with yet.

3199
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:44,760
I'm getting snake.

3200
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:50,360
Well, if there's hunters on the other bridge,

3201
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:52,760
let's hope I don't have to go on that bridge again.

3202
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:55,160
Okay.

3203
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:58,760
Ba da da da.

3204
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,760
Something's tally-wacking me.

3205
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:07,800
I'm just going for it.

3206
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:11,200
You got to upload Cortana into the microwave.

3207
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,320
What?

3208
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:15,360
You got to upload Burkana into the frame.

3209
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:16,200
Whoa!

3210
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:20,960
You got to upload Cortana into the main frame.

3211
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:22,800
Why the microwave?

3212
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:26,040
Why did my brain even read that?

3213
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:28,600
It doesn't even say waves at all.

3214
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:29,600
I'm so sorry.

3215
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:31,560
Absolutely butchered your advice.

3216
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:34,440
Literally just trying to help me get through the game.

3217
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:35,960
And how do I repair you?

3218
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:39,800
Just, like, I'll be talking a little bit.

3219
02:50:39,800 --> 02:50:41,480
Oh, the baby's are asleep again.

3220
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:42,320
Bonk.

3221
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:48,360
That would be for your road gun.

3222
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:50,120
Brain didn't, yeah.

3223
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:52,080
Um, I never got much sleep

3224
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:54,120
because I was doing so much of my work yesterday.

3225
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:58,400
But I, oh my God, I did, like, big work,

3226
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:03,400
which makes, like, obviously, my work a lot less.

3227
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:06,880
Um, unironically, I'm doing, like,

3228
02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:10,800
the Avengers assembled and I'm getting the editors

3229
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:12,720
to all communicate to one another,

3230
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:17,720
so I don't have to delegate the Patreon edit.

3231
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:22,160
And, oh, not again, not again!

3232
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:25,320
Oh my God, there's no run, there's no run.

3233
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:26,600
Oh my God, not again.

3234
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:28,240
There's literally no run.

3235
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:29,280
There's literally no run.

3236
02:51:29,280 --> 02:51:31,200
I really don't like these enemies.

3237
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:34,400
I really don't like them.

3238
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,960
Oh my God, stop, they're so big.

3239
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:40,720
Oh, I really don't like it.

3240
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:41,800
I really don't like it.

3241
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:43,240
I really don't like the hunters.

3242
02:51:43,240 --> 02:51:44,480
They scare me.

3243
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:49,480
I, like, I could, oh, right, you.

3244
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:52,680
Oh no, no, let's go.

3245
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:58,320
If I had a super weapon.

3246
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:05,640
Oh my God, this is a bit dramatic.

3247
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:06,880
This is a bit dramatic.

3248
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:07,720
Oh, fuck it.

3249
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:12,640
Okay, hold on, I need, like, any guns in there.

3250
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:14,360
This is getting ridiculous.

3251
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:16,240
Oh, for fuck's sake.

3252
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:17,240
What am I to do?

3253
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:20,880
I'm getting blasted right now.

3254
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:23,960
Ah!

3255
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:26,080
It burns!

3256
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:28,920
It burns!

3257
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:37,440
Oh my God, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3258
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:38,840
You're all making me scared.

3259
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:41,240
There's, like, so many enemies this map.

3260
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:43,280
Is this it?

3261
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:44,640
We're not at the end game.

3262
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:45,960
There's no way we're at the end game.

3263
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:49,520
I just feel like this map is, like, going for it.

3264
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,720
Oh my God, maybe I shouldn't have woken up the baby.

3265
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:56,240
Sorry, go back to sleep.

3266
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:58,960
Cause I had rules, shall I bump into deep and I'll really care

3267
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:03,160
about sticks and violins, I love music, fuck, I love the island.

3268
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:04,000
Oh my God, maybe.

3269
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:08,560
Oh, this, like, this is a really effective gun.

3270
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:09,920
What the heck?

3271
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:11,920
Sorry, I'm just following the arrows on the floor.

3272
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:13,840
Imagine if the arrows aren't real.

3273
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:15,880
I'm getting really tired.

3274
02:53:15,880 --> 02:53:17,680
I feel like we've been here before.

3275
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Wait, never going down.

3276
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Have I just done one big massive circle?

3277
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,560
I mean, there's new enemies.

3278
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,120
Hold on, I got itched my nose, hold on.

3279
02:53:33,320 --> 02:53:34,360
There's new, oh!

3280
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:37,680
Don't do that!

3281
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:43,000
The map is kind of looping, at least what I'm saying.

3282
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,600
Right, okay, I'm glad I'm not going crazy,

3283
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:46,200
cause I'm like, did I mess up?

3284
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,800
Am I wasting everyone's time right now?

3285
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:53,680
Imagine if I was wasting everyone's time.

3286
02:53:54,680 --> 02:53:56,360
That's like, terrible gameplay.

3287
02:53:56,360 --> 02:53:57,680
Oh!

3288
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,960
Oh, the melee animation's different.

3289
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:01,880
No, it's with my fist.

3290
02:54:01,880 --> 02:54:02,720
Bumper.

3291
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:05,560
Where?

3292
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:11,400
Hold on, hold on, I've got it.

3293
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:12,720
Yep.

3294
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:13,960
Okay.

3295
02:54:13,960 --> 02:54:18,960
This map is very, very turning me around.

3296
02:54:24,040 --> 02:54:25,800
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

3297
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:27,680
We should come and hear one of those ghosts.

3298
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,160
They're going to need the firepower.

3299
02:54:29,160 --> 02:54:31,200
Wait, I'm coming to hear one of those ghosts.

3300
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:32,080
Rrrrr!

3301
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:33,400
Rrrrr!

3302
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,920
Where are we going?

3303
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:35,760
I saw a race.

3304
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,240
I'm not sticking around to find out

3305
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:39,360
how to 1v1 a rape on a ghost, okay?

3306
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:41,360
Or do I have to?

3307
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,040
Oh!

3308
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,480
Okay.

3309
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:56,000
Okay, we have hope.

3310
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:56,840
We have hope.

3311
02:54:56,840 --> 02:54:57,680
Hope is back.

3312
02:54:57,680 --> 02:54:58,520
Ooh!

3313
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:05,720
I see it, I see it, I see it.

3314
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:06,560
It's okay.

3315
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:09,800
Oh my God.

3316
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:10,640
What is that?

3317
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:11,480
Sniper ammo?

3318
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:15,120
Why is it giving me?

3319
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,920
It's giving me a rocket launcher back.

3320
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:19,280
Oh yeah!

3321
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:22,000
Right, what is going for me?

3322
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:26,160
Leafy Bams is going for me.

3323
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:34,960
As if!

3324
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:39,560
Right.

3325
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:41,000
What am I to do?

3326
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,240
Is that a staircase there?

3327
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:48,400
I think it is.

3328
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,960
I ain't got my Gleik's on, but it looks like a staircase.

3329
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:54,960
Copium?

3330
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:57,200
No, that is, that is, look.

3331
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,760
There's a purple command thing there.

3332
02:55:58,760 --> 02:56:00,000
I ain't got my Gleik's on.

3333
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,240
Up the pyramid, yes.

3334
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,200
Oh jeez, you fucking scared me!

3335
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:08,040
Oh my God!

3336
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:10,160
Stop!

3337
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:11,000
Stop!

3338
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,480
That ledged the scum.

3339
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:16,160
I didn't even see the hunter,

3340
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:19,160
I was so focused in on the wee grunt sleeping.

3341
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,480
The fact that he got a scare from me,

3342
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:23,080
and I got a scare from him.

3343
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
I've got my heart rate monitor on right now.

3344
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
I've got my heart rate monitor on right now.

3345
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Get off of it.

3346
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:38,720
Needle.

3347
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:41,720
Right, fisty cut.

3348
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:43,280
Fight me like a man!

3349
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:44,920
El mano, el mano.

3350
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:45,920
Brov.

3351
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:47,240
Brov, please stop moving.

3352
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:48,240
Okay, thank you.

3353
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:51,280
I got plasma grenades off of them.

3354
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:52,280
Oh wait, no, we can't go this way.

3355
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:53,120
Sorry!

3356
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:54,200
Right, up the pyramid.

3357
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:56,480
I do pity the grunt.

3358
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:59,920
I pity the fools who pities the grunts.

3359
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:01,040
They're adorable.

3360
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:06,200
I think they're very cute, if I look them.

3361
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:07,040
Bonk!

3362
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:11,040
Poor little guys.

3363
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:11,880
Bonk!

3364
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:15,280
I do pity them for their patheticness.

3365
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:16,120
Bonk!

3366
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:16,960
Oh!

3367
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:23,160
Eh!

3368
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:25,840
Eh!

3369
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:28,480
Wait, what?

3370
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:31,480
Wait!

3371
02:57:34,480 --> 02:57:35,480
Where am I?

3372
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:42,480
Did my game bug out?

3373
02:57:42,480 --> 02:57:45,480
Why is this my last Lord's station?

3374
02:57:50,480 --> 02:57:52,480
Why is this my Lord's la-

3375
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:54,480
Why is this my last Lord's la-

3376
02:57:54,480 --> 02:57:56,480
Why is this my Lord's la-

3377
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:58,480
Last Lord's station?

3378
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:01,480
Is that a joke?

3379
02:58:04,480 --> 02:58:07,480
Even though it's like save, loading, loading, loading, loading,

3380
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:09,480
every time I go do something.

3381
02:58:12,480 --> 02:58:13,480
Oh my god!

3382
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:15,480
Wait, how?

3383
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:20,480
There's no way.

3384
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:21,480
How?

3385
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:23,480
I was at the end of the mission!

3386
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:27,480
There's no way I wasn't, like, right at the end of that mission!

3387
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:31,480
Wait, check your saved games?

3388
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:40,480
It says assault on the c-

3389
02:58:40,480 --> 02:58:43,480
Defend the control room against wave after wave of covenants.

3390
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:51,480
The grunt smacked you so hard it sent you back several saves.

3391
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:55,480
Literally, what? I was like, was that not right at the end?

3392
02:58:58,480 --> 02:58:59,480
Last checkpoint?

3393
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:01,480
Is this my only Hail Mary?

3394
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:09,480
He returned to you before you killed the Marine randomly?

3395
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:11,480
At least you're a reviewer.

3396
02:59:13,480 --> 02:59:15,480
Awww.

3397
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:18,480
Nah.

3398
02:59:18,480 --> 02:59:20,480
What?

3399
02:59:20,480 --> 02:59:22,480
Enzy.

3400
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:23,480
Fuck!

3401
02:59:23,480 --> 02:59:25,480
What mission am I on?

3402
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:31,480
Bruhhhhhhh.

3403
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:37,480
Moe, you bums.

3404
02:59:38,480 --> 02:59:40,480
Welcome to gaming in the 80s.

3405
02:59:40,480 --> 02:59:42,480
Bruhhhh, what?

3406
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:44,480
This is literally, I'm not being funny.

3407
02:59:44,480 --> 02:59:47,480
We're playing the, the old, we're playing the new version,

3408
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:49,480
so none of that piss should be happening.

3409
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:53,480
I don't know why the games act in, like, it,

3410
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:55,480
we actually are playing old school.

3411
02:59:55,480 --> 02:59:57,480
Cause, what?

3412
03:00:02,480 --> 03:00:05,480
The Covenant placed their tanks to defend the entrance to the tunnel.

3413
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:09,480
I, will literally, I'm short right now.

3414
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:18,480
Awww.

3415
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:23,480
Awww.

3416
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:26,480
I don't know what to do.

3417
03:00:28,480 --> 03:00:31,480
Like, the only thing I can think is just bomb rush it at this point

3418
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:35,480
and just pretend that we didn't lose all that progress randomly.

3419
03:00:35,480 --> 03:00:37,480
See, checkpoint done!

3420
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:41,480
So, is my fail bugged now?

3421
03:00:41,480 --> 03:00:44,480
And if, if I die, it's gonna send me back there?

3422
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:47,480
I really hope not.

3423
03:00:47,480 --> 03:00:50,480
I, I really hope not.

3424
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:53,480
I'm just bomb rushing it, I'm sorry,

3425
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:55,480
but we literally have done this.

3426
03:00:55,480 --> 03:00:57,480
We probably were what?

3427
03:00:57,480 --> 03:00:59,480
About five minutes from finishing the mission?

3428
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:04,480
There is no reason that should have happened.

3429
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:08,480
Absolutely no reason.

3430
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:12,480
Yeah, fuck you.

3431
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:14,480
I'm bomb rushing it, I'm bomb rushing it.

3432
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:19,480
Bro, there, I have a horrible feeling my game file is bugged

3433
03:01:19,480 --> 03:01:22,480
and if I die, it's gonna send me back there every time now.

3434
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:24,480
See, checkpoint done.

3435
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:26,480
Does that mean save?

3436
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:28,480
Or are checkpoints different?

3437
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:32,480
Rolling Thunder, new location.

3438
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:34,480
So...

3439
03:01:35,480 --> 03:01:37,480
Can you help me out here?

3440
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:39,480
Frickin' 34th!

3441
03:01:39,480 --> 03:01:41,480
Three industries!

3442
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:45,480
Not even for, waiting for the Marines to hop on.

3443
03:01:45,480 --> 03:01:47,480
They're not refling, so it's okay.

3444
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:49,480
That's supposed to be the save.

3445
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:52,480
Why they got remastered the game without fixing the bug?

3446
03:01:52,480 --> 03:01:54,480
I swear, I bet you'll be like,

3447
03:01:54,480 --> 03:01:56,480
oh, that's like a mega super rare bug

3448
03:01:56,480 --> 03:01:58,480
that no one ever experiences.

3449
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:01,480
Obviously, I get it with my streamer luck.

3450
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:05,480
If I can just literally ignore everything,

3451
03:02:05,480 --> 03:02:07,480
I'm just going for it.

3452
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:09,480
I'll deal with the wraith.

3453
03:02:09,480 --> 03:02:11,480
It puts me on the bridge section.

3454
03:02:13,480 --> 03:02:15,480
The bugs are inevitable.

3455
03:02:21,480 --> 03:02:23,480
Like...

3456
03:02:23,480 --> 03:02:25,480
I do love shooting them.

3457
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:28,480
I can't believe that.

3458
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:30,480
Checkpoints kinda bugged is common.

3459
03:02:32,480 --> 03:02:35,480
Don't say such things to me, honestly.

3460
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:37,480
My heart can't handle it right now.

3461
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:40,480
I thought the Covenant had eliminated all the Marine forces in this area.

3462
03:02:42,480 --> 03:02:44,480
Yeah, away from the tank.

3463
03:02:44,480 --> 03:02:46,480
And they're all gonna jump.

3464
03:02:46,480 --> 03:02:48,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3465
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:51,480
Okay.

3466
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:53,480
So...

3467
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:55,480
What happens then?

3468
03:02:55,480 --> 03:02:57,480
The Covenant is jumping in behind us.

3469
03:02:59,480 --> 03:03:02,480
I like, I'm jumping out of the way and I don't even go after them.

3470
03:03:02,480 --> 03:03:05,480
You know, it's a first and not gonna be the last rate.

3471
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:10,480
Okay, as long as it was like some super rare, like, amazing thing that no one ever gets,

3472
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:12,480
but I end up getting it,

3473
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:14,480
then I can't be that mad.

3474
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:16,480
But I...

3475
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:18,480
I'm probably gonna ignore everything.

3476
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:25,480
Uh...

3477
03:03:25,480 --> 03:03:28,480
I'm trying to remember what we were going for.

3478
03:03:30,480 --> 03:03:32,480
I'm playing legendary,

3479
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:35,480
so I'm able to avoid the bullets a lot better than you would.

3480
03:03:35,480 --> 03:03:38,480
So don't worry about it too much, but...

3481
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:41,480
It's normal to be jealous.

3482
03:03:41,480 --> 03:03:43,480
Oh, no. It's normal. It's okay to be jealous.

3483
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:48,480
Right, okay.

3484
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:50,480
My checkpoints have fixed themselves.

3485
03:03:50,480 --> 03:03:52,480
That is progress.

3486
03:03:54,480 --> 03:03:55,480
That is progress.

3487
03:03:55,480 --> 03:03:57,480
My checkpoints have fixed themselves.

3488
03:03:58,480 --> 03:03:59,480
So...

3489
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:01,480
We can continue.

3490
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:09,480
Oh my god, I have to do all of that again.

3491
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:15,480
Don't do it.

3492
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:16,480
Don't do it.

3493
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,480
Don't do it.

3494
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:18,480
Don't do it.

3495
03:04:18,480 --> 03:04:19,480
Don't do it.

3496
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,480
Don't do it.

3497
03:04:20,480 --> 03:04:21,480
Don't do it.

3498
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:23,480
Stop it.

3499
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:24,480
Stop it.

3500
03:04:24,480 --> 03:04:25,480
Stop it.

3501
03:04:25,480 --> 03:04:27,480
I can see he's going nuts trying to get to me.

3502
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:28,480
Oh!

3503
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:30,480
I forgot about the one kissing in the corridor.

3504
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:32,480
Leave me alone.

3505
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,480
Leave me alone.

3506
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:34,480
I've already done this part of the game.

3507
03:04:34,480 --> 03:04:35,480
Leave me alone.

3508
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:38,480
Be gone, fellow beasts.

3509
03:04:38,480 --> 03:04:40,480
Right, if I take a left, what happens?

3510
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:49,480
I don't know.

3511
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:50,480
I don't know.

3512
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:52,480
I don't know if this is wise to bum rush it

3513
03:04:52,480 --> 03:04:55,480
because I might die and then get even more annoyed.

3514
03:04:57,480 --> 03:04:58,480
Is it in the middle?

3515
03:04:58,480 --> 03:05:00,480
Where the heck is it?

3516
03:05:00,480 --> 03:05:02,480
This is one where it's in the middle

3517
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:05,480
and you need to buckle a wall to get around it or something.

3518
03:05:05,480 --> 03:05:07,480
Bra, stop.

3519
03:05:07,480 --> 03:05:09,480
Why is it even here?

3520
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:11,480
Why is there a push mechanic?

3521
03:05:11,480 --> 03:05:13,480
Oh, we went past it.

3522
03:05:13,480 --> 03:05:14,480
It's fine.

3523
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:15,480
Leave me alone.

3524
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:20,480
The checkpoints do get a little corky at night.

3525
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:21,480
Just chilling.

3526
03:05:21,480 --> 03:05:22,480
Right, right.

3527
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:24,480
We're already on the first part of the bridge.

3528
03:05:24,480 --> 03:05:25,480
Go across the bridge.

3529
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:27,480
Go through the mechanic.

3530
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:28,480
Sing.

3531
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:30,480
Just bum rush it.

3532
03:05:30,480 --> 03:05:32,480
Just bum rush it.

3533
03:05:32,480 --> 03:05:33,480
Any bum rushers?

3534
03:05:36,480 --> 03:05:38,480
Any bum rushers.

3535
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:39,480
Yes, yes, yes.

3536
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:40,480
Bye.

3537
03:05:40,480 --> 03:05:41,480
Leave me alone.

3538
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:42,480
Leave me alone.

3539
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:43,480
Leave me alone.

3540
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:44,480
Right, okay.

3541
03:05:44,480 --> 03:05:45,480
Cross the bridge.

3542
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:47,480
Give me ammo and stuff.

3543
03:05:48,480 --> 03:05:49,480
Right, that's fine.

3544
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:50,480
I'll do it.

3545
03:05:50,480 --> 03:05:51,480
I'll do it.

3546
03:05:53,480 --> 03:05:55,480
Right, and then...

3547
03:05:55,480 --> 03:05:56,480
And then what?

3548
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:57,480
I don't know.

3549
03:05:58,480 --> 03:05:59,480
I forgot.

3550
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:00,480
I'm just using...

3551
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:01,480
I'm just doing...

3552
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:02,480
I'm going to assume it's...

3553
03:06:02,480 --> 03:06:06,480
Nope, it's not at the symmetrical opposite side on the map.

3554
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:08,480
Don't get excited.

3555
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:11,480
Where the fuck is it?

3556
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:15,480
Reflings are natural born bum rushers.

3557
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:16,480
I'm a flume.

3558
03:06:16,480 --> 03:06:19,480
I don't think it's necessary to do how many enemies there are around.

3559
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:22,480
It's something about the loading triggers.

3560
03:06:22,480 --> 03:06:25,480
You must have missed one of them,

3561
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:28,480
and then it just absolutely forgot everything that I ever did.

3562
03:06:30,480 --> 03:06:31,480
Stay asleep.

3563
03:06:31,480 --> 03:06:34,480
Rock on my baby, on the tree top.

3564
03:06:34,480 --> 03:06:38,480
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

3565
03:06:38,480 --> 03:06:42,480
And when the cradle rocks, it'll swing in the wind.

3566
03:06:42,480 --> 03:06:44,480
Swingin' in the wind.

3567
03:06:44,480 --> 03:06:47,480
I'm swingin' in the wind.

3568
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:50,480
Bum rum pum pum.

3569
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:52,480
I didn't see him,

3570
03:06:52,480 --> 03:06:54,480
and he's actually pretty big.

3571
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:58,480
De-spawn already!

3572
03:06:58,480 --> 03:07:00,480
De-spawn, everyone de-spawn.

3573
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:01,480
Checkpoint done.

3574
03:07:01,480 --> 03:07:03,480
Yes, the top left checkpoint done.

3575
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:05,480
Right okay, don't remember what was supposed to be.

3576
03:07:14,480 --> 03:07:17,420
I'll literally play an assassin's Creed right now in Halo

3577
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:26,480
Those jackals can take your full shield in one hit. That's a bit of a problem

3578
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:33,060
Stop stop I need this to recharge stop

3579
03:07:35,400 --> 03:07:38,560
I'm gonna far I'm gonna far I'm getting annoyed. Oh

3580
03:07:39,040 --> 03:07:41,040
Oh

3581
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:47,400
My god, I'm actually gonna die. I'm actually gonna die

3582
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:55,800
The shield mechanic want to come in or am I just in the rear? I'll like shield again

3583
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:59,960
I'm actually going to die

3584
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:07,760
We're going to break we're going across the other side of the bridge now

3585
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:14,320
Need them no because they're gonna run into me and then I'll be even matter I

3586
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:24,040
Just need to make sure I don't lose my shield that's when it becomes a problem

3587
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:29,560
Is there no dead I need like a Marine's body to heal up

3588
03:08:38,120 --> 03:08:43,280
Okay, I'm just I'm gonna pretend I didn't even see him you're invisible. I'll let you believe that you're

3589
03:08:45,320 --> 03:08:48,880
Yeah chip damage before the shield went off again

3590
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:54,440
Surely it's just perfectly on the other side of the map

3591
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:05,960
I'm like lawn ammo as well

3592
03:09:10,440 --> 03:09:12,440
We're gonna die

3593
03:09:13,200 --> 03:09:17,960
I'm really needing a Marine body. I'm literally out. I don't have

3594
03:09:19,560 --> 03:09:24,240
The only other thing I have is a rocket launcher. You can't make it. Oh

3595
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:27,880
And there's another one in the corridor

3596
03:09:30,800 --> 03:09:33,800
Buckle give me your gun

3597
03:09:38,320 --> 03:09:44,280
Country girls make do you need to pray well the plasma I don't even know what this one is

3598
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:46,280
Oh

3599
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,760
There's a fifty-fifty

3600
03:09:51,160 --> 03:09:58,200
Curse Halo is a fun game. What? Oh my god. Why did I just alert the AI to my position?

3601
03:09:59,160 --> 03:10:01,160
I don't know. I was just feeling corky like that

3602
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:06,960
You drop the rocket launcher, I did

3603
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:09,960
Ammo and there's no

3604
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:14,360
Scavenged from stop in my way

3605
03:10:18,080 --> 03:10:21,960
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I don't have time for this

3606
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:31,700
Fucking get me up. What is this this one supposed to be? Oh

3607
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:37,500
My god, oh my god, it's like what?

3608
03:10:39,020 --> 03:10:43,180
That was bizarre was that what I was supposed to do. I hope that was what it's locked

3609
03:10:45,340 --> 03:10:47,340
Whoa, what am I supposed to do?

3610
03:10:47,700 --> 03:10:52,140
We'll just fly down towards the pyramid. I can fly on the permit. Oh, sorry

3611
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:55,140
I

3612
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:02,660
Point unlocked, please I'm begging

3613
03:11:07,340 --> 03:11:12,180
Checkpoint checkpoint checkpoint. Oh wait up here Danny fly up to that next thing

3614
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:16,260
Yeah, skip a little chunk of the level. Oh

3615
03:11:17,900 --> 03:11:20,960
There was like a little slope right there. Haha. Sorry

3616
03:11:22,660 --> 03:11:24,660
Oh

3617
03:11:28,860 --> 03:11:32,420
Okay, now we're at the top of the pyramid

3618
03:11:34,420 --> 03:11:39,140
The collision of a vehicle can kill you your own vehicle that you get off can make you perish

3619
03:11:48,460 --> 03:11:50,740
Wait, there's nothing here

3620
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:54,860
What? I've been trolled

3621
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:01,700
I like how the race is still all locked to me even though I'm up here

3622
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:04,700
I just get trolled. There's a switch at the door, but warning there's a lot

3623
03:12:04,700 --> 03:12:07,100
There's a switch at the door at the door at the door

3624
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:15,580
I like how the concept of doors having locks is like so lost on me

3625
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:20,780
Because it's just not a thing in your game mechanics like all doors are unlocked

3626
03:12:21,740 --> 03:12:23,740
Okay, right I

3627
03:12:36,260 --> 03:12:39,660
Think it handles that all right all things considered

3628
03:12:44,540 --> 03:12:46,540
Yeah

3629
03:12:50,780 --> 03:12:52,980
I think thank you for the heads up

3630
03:12:56,700 --> 03:12:58,700
Okay, I guess everything

3631
03:13:00,180 --> 03:13:02,180
Oh, no wrong book

3632
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,860
That's really

3633
03:13:06,060 --> 03:13:11,500
Covenant forces in the vicinity have been eliminated. I really don't want to die now. I don't want to replay this mission

3634
03:13:13,380 --> 03:13:19,780
This is a very big one is this the beach missions considered the best one right because this one

3635
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:28,420
Is it blames me? Oh wait, is that how close I was to the end of the freaking mission control center

3636
03:13:33,940 --> 03:13:35,940
That's how close I was

3637
03:13:42,900 --> 03:13:45,220
She doesn't know about the witness we were

3638
03:13:47,700 --> 03:13:49,700
Next mission's best one

3639
03:13:50,780 --> 03:13:52,780
Pain for the one mission

3640
03:14:02,020 --> 03:14:04,020
That terminal try there

3641
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:06,820
Thank You Cortana

3642
03:14:08,180 --> 03:14:10,180
Oh my god

3643
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:27,620
Let's stay focused halo, how do we use it against the covenant? It's not the original voice actor

3644
03:14:28,100 --> 03:14:32,620
It's something else something much more important. What?

3645
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:35,780
this ring

3646
03:14:36,780 --> 03:14:38,780
What is it give me a second to access

3647
03:14:39,700 --> 03:14:44,780
Yes, the forerunner built this place. Fuck. It's a forerunner. What the fuck is a kilometer?

3648
03:14:45,780 --> 03:14:47,780
No, that can't be

3649
03:14:48,780 --> 03:14:51,980
Hydration check. Covenant fools. They must have known there must have been signs

3650
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:55,460
Slow down. You're losing me the Covenant

3651
03:14:57,460 --> 03:14:59,460
Cortana

3652
03:15:00,940 --> 03:15:06,460
Something buried the captain. We've got to stop the captain keys. What are weapons cash?

3653
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:10,580
He's looking for it's not really we can't let him get inside. I don't

3654
03:15:11,060 --> 03:15:18,820
There's no time get out of here find keys stop him before it's too late. Okay, geez Cortana, geez

3655
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:24,340
Hey, you know you could like just say like a few sentences while I walk out

3656
03:15:24,340 --> 03:15:28,340
You know just to explain the situation because games are always like there's no time

3657
03:15:30,140 --> 03:15:32,140
RGB Cortana

3658
03:15:32,580 --> 03:15:35,660
Did they say it was an action game? It's a horror game

3659
03:15:36,660 --> 03:15:38,660
Will there be aliens who run in from me?

3660
03:15:39,420 --> 03:15:43,780
I'll show you. I bet you are well enough alone. It's called this mission

3661
03:15:44,980 --> 03:15:46,980
You're gonna hate it. Have fun

3662
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:58,740
We're in the welcome to the jungle where we've got guns and games

3663
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:04,620
You guys what we're having a hurricane

3664
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:10,540
Where did they come from did a plant just pick them up is he plants enemies?

3665
03:16:23,180 --> 03:16:25,180
My god, I like the rainforest

3666
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
I'm a sucker for rainforest

3667
03:16:35,660 --> 03:16:37,660
Good luck. Come on. We you're about to ink

3668
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:44,100
Am I supposed to go up where he was

3669
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:56,220
I'm a wee bit turned around in this map after be honest, but oh no, you can claim the tree. Okay, well, I see the enemy over there

3670
03:17:00,140 --> 03:17:02,140
Fucking hero radio

3671
03:17:06,260 --> 03:17:08,260
Oh

3672
03:17:09,820 --> 03:17:15,660
Wait, that's where I was sorry sorry slow very slow right now my brain's not quite here

3673
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:19,700
She's gonna get so lost on this level which I already just got myself spun around

3674
03:17:22,620 --> 03:17:28,900
Right, I assume across the bridge because there's a light there there. Yeah, okay. I'm not gonna grunt against that yet

3675
03:17:29,660 --> 03:17:31,660
And

3676
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:36,580
The ambience is getting a bit creepy

3677
03:17:41,500 --> 03:17:43,500
Now we're holding up

3678
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:49,860
There's no way you're running away in fear, but when I show up you're like I'm not hold on a minute

3679
03:17:59,300 --> 03:18:01,780
Oh, I literally spun around

3680
03:18:11,340 --> 03:18:16,020
Oh, I'll that took fall damage. I can even get on the thing in time

3681
03:18:17,380 --> 03:18:19,220
Oh, yeah

3682
03:18:19,220 --> 03:18:23,020
Oh captain, you're not supposed to do something. I don't know

3683
03:18:28,900 --> 03:18:30,900
Bonk

3684
03:18:34,780 --> 03:18:36,780
Okay, I think we're bonking

3685
03:18:40,220 --> 03:18:45,300
You're like weird alien radios like nothing stuff. Well, there's a green door. Okay, assume that

So enter your that looks like a pin card machine in the uk

3719
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:12,180
The red is to cancel the the yellow is to take away one digit you put in wrong and green is to confirm

3720
03:22:12,180 --> 03:22:14,260
That's literally a pin pad in

Okay, let the other person incriminate themselves so they can also get done for telling the wrong information to the police

3728
03:23:02,100 --> 03:23:05,060
Why do we always have to listen to this old stuff serge?

3729
03:23:05,540 --> 03:23:11,300
Watch your mouth son. Oh a hydration check is your history. It should remind you grunts. We're fighting to protect

3730
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:17,620
Hey, if the governor want to wipe out this particular part of my history, that's fine by me

3731
03:23:18,660 --> 03:23:23,460
Yeah, better it than us. You ask real nice next time you see him

3748
03:24:31,780 --> 03:24:33,620
What do we have sergeant?

3754
03:25:00,660 --> 03:25:03,620
This is what Cortana didn't want them to open but he did

Then they just see forward it. Okay real and true though. Oh, right. Sorry. I missed it

right as long as my shield isn't gone I got worked a little bit keep an eye out for shotgun ammo

4007
03:58:14,420 --> 03:58:24,660

03:58:49,460 --> 03:58:58,900
oh well that glitch went really well keep doing more of what that is

4012
03:59:02,100 --> 03:59:05,300
they can't only keep from afar if you don't think about it too much

4013
03:59:06,740 --> 03:59:12,660
I imagine she's got to reboot the wafer where's john heel when you need him

4014
03:59:13,220 --> 03:59:13,860
I don't know

4015
03:59:18,020 --> 03:59:25,700
okay if I just if this is the like last mission where I just need to do the thing then I'll be okay

4016
03:59:27,380 --> 03:59:30,340
thought how are you shooting me you're literally wait where did he go

4017
03:59:38,500 --> 03:59:39,220

I'm to go down there

4019
03:59:52,420 --> 03:59:54,900
there are more I think the next one is actually worse for me

4020
03:59:57,860 --> 04:00:00,580
this is what I meant about small confined spaces

4021
04:00:02,420 --> 04:00:09,460
in the flood okay don't don't don't give me any more of whatever that was don't do it I'm not

4022
04:00:09,540 --> 04:00:10,260

4023
04:00:15,140 --> 04:00:18,980
it's fine it's fine it's fine I have aimbot

4024
04:00:26,340 --> 04:00:35,220
they have really claimed a lot of the common arms I don't know what I've been told

4025
04:00:35,700 --> 04:00:42,260
I'm fucking please tell me those laser beams are coming

4026
04:00:44,260 --> 04:00:49,060
oh I can't um I I feel sick in my throat

4027
04:00:53,460 --> 04:00:59,860
but if you could hurry us along to the location

4028
04:01:00,260 --> 04:01:09,540
as fortunately I um a living organism carbon-based life form I ain't gonna make it cheap if you

4029
04:01:09,540 --> 04:01:14,500
don't hurry your ass up and get me to where I need to be

4030
04:01:18,340 --> 04:01:26,500
I've entered the battle dome apparently they're all gonna start coming out of an AMAR oh my god

4031
04:01:26,500 --> 04:01:33,860
we're out of the halo gun again literally the halo shotgun but I don't want to ride the elevator

4032
04:01:34,740 --> 04:01:42,740
is the name of this mission so to say um just be shitting my pantyloons is a bit of an understatement

4033
04:01:42,740 --> 04:01:52,500
right now because what does that mean hi again oh I don't have ammo for this

4034
04:01:56,980 --> 04:02:03,700
we're releasing the plug they see most persistent in their attempts to access restricted areas get back down

4035
04:02:09,460 --> 04:02:15,540
okay if the wee planes want to come with me that'd be great just stay with me honestly

4036
04:02:27,460 --> 04:02:28,980
oh he got back up again hold on

4037
04:02:31,940 --> 04:02:39,620
are you down for real this time I don't like it I don't like tight little corridors this is

4038
04:02:39,620 --> 04:02:49,220
this is literally why I don't like tight corridors stop it literally why I I freaking called it I freaking

4039
04:02:49,220 --> 04:02:52,820
called it they know what the dev team knew exactly what they were

4040
04:02:56,900 --> 04:02:58,900
oh

4041
04:03:09,780 --> 04:03:13,620
anyway I was saying the dev team knew exactly what the heck they were doing

4042
04:03:14,980 --> 04:03:21,380
oh my god get me out of this heck hole where am I to go take an educated guess

4043
04:03:22,180 --> 04:03:31,300
oh it got up again oh don't do that okay I need more of these laser beams

4044
04:03:32,420 --> 04:03:36,020

4045
04:03:42,820 --> 04:03:48,100
I'm trying to act like this is fine I just know it's dire is it did I go the wrong way

4046
04:03:48,900 --> 04:03:55,300

4047
04:03:55,300 --> 04:03:58,580
go the other way going the other way going the other way going the other way

4048
04:03:59,620 --> 04:04:03,460

4049
04:04:05,700 --> 04:04:08,340
it's not but I have to pretend it's okay

4050

4097
04:09:23,540 --> 04:09:32,660
want it to be this scary or was it just like tee he like I'm about to read a developer's

4098
04:09:32,660 --> 04:09:38,340
interview after I play this game oh he just perished on the way down he took fall damage

4099
04:09:38,500 --> 04:09:46,180
aim because like there's only so much one can take

4100
04:09:51,380 --> 04:09:53,700
oh they dropped me ammo nuisance

4101
04:09:56,340 --> 04:10:04,900

4102
04:10:04,980 --> 04:10:11,620

4104
04:10:21,700 --> 04:10:30,020
this is not possible if they insta kill you with a touch how how do you win on legendary you don't

4105
04:10:30,660 --> 04:10:34,980
it's just suffering that's what you win do you want to suffer while you play video games

4106
04:10:34,980 --> 04:10:43,460
I have a great suggestion for you but seriously how I can hear him please open this door what's

4107
04:10:43,460 --> 04:10:52,420

4108
04:10:52,740 --> 04:10:55,940

4109
04:10:59,700 --> 04:11:02,820
am I not supposed to be here nothing's happening

4110
04:11:06,660 --> 04:11:15,460
am I going the wrong way oh right okay no no it's fine you're just waiting on you for ages anyway

4111
04:11:15,700 --> 04:11:21,700
no more please leave me alone

4112
04:11:26,100 --> 04:11:31,300
for me it's hard to feel scared when I'm playing as a death machine that destroys everything in my

4113
04:11:31,300 --> 04:11:39,060
past all I'm asking is for two assistant birds okay two assistant laser beams I'll be happy

4114
04:11:45,540 --> 04:11:49,540
what it's repairing my shit how

4115
04:11:54,260 --> 04:11:55,060
oh sorry

4116
04:12:03,620 --> 04:12:06,260
uh take a whack

4117
04:12:07,220 --> 04:12:18,980
that is insane what do you want from me oh my god

4118
04:12:20,820 --> 04:12:26,900
what does it want what is the flood one actually well we're on the subject of what do you want

4119
04:12:28,740 --> 04:12:30,500
do they want to take over everything

4120
04:12:31,300 --> 04:12:33,300
oh

4121
04:12:37,540 --> 04:12:39,380
it wants to consume to spread

4122
04:12:42,100 --> 04:12:44,980
every person they in fact they steal all they know like knowledge

4123
04:12:47,860 --> 04:12:52,900
they want to eat everything they want to spray cramber I have not heard that mean in ages

4124
04:12:53,540 --> 04:12:55,220
I don't know why it was so popular

4125
04:12:55,540 --> 04:12:58,500
what was the

4126
04:13:07,860 --> 04:13:09,220
was that supposed to happen

4127
04:13:17,220 --> 04:13:21,780
protocol requires that I take possession of the index for transport your organic form

4128
04:13:21,780 --> 04:13:25,780
rather too vulnerable to infection the index must not fall into the hands of the

4129
04:13:25,780 --> 04:13:32,500
flood before you use the room and activate the installation the flood is spreading we must hurry

4130
04:13:37,220 --> 04:13:38,900
so that's that bad mission over right

4131
04:13:40,980 --> 04:13:48,260
he yanked it literally brov got me to do it but then he takes it give you cheeky exam honestly

4132
04:13:48,260 --> 04:13:52,820
which means that any organism with sufficient mass and cognitive capability is a potential doctor

4133
04:13:55,220 --> 04:14:01,860
I mean you're not wrong but no nothing splendid shall we

4134
04:14:05,460 --> 04:14:06,980
no uh nothing

4135
04:14:11,700 --> 04:14:13,860
so what we're gonna use the halo ring in the way

4136
04:14:18,500 --> 04:14:23,540
with my classification to perform a task as important as the reunification of the index

4137
04:14:28,900 --> 04:14:30,100
so then give me back the thing

4138
04:14:34,580 --> 04:14:39,860
okay I feel like that may have been cut content or something now it takes it from

4139
04:14:39,860 --> 04:14:41,460
us next cut scene gives us a back

4140
04:14:45,940 --> 04:14:47,060
oh really

4141
04:14:50,260 --> 04:14:55,620
I've spent the last 12 hours cooped up in here watching you tody about helping that thing get

4142
04:14:55,620 --> 04:15:04,340
set to slit our throat hold on now he's a friend oh I didn't know he's your pal is he damn Cortana

4143
04:15:04,900 --> 04:15:11,860
any idea what that bastard almost made you do yes activate halo's defenses and yes

4144
04:15:12,740 --> 04:15:16,580
which is why we brought the index to the control center you mean this

4145
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:23,860
a construct in the core that is absolutely unacceptable wait so he's a buddy what

4146
04:15:25,140 --> 04:15:27,940
I shall hurt you at once you sure that's a good idea

4147
04:15:27,940 --> 04:15:36,740
how how do you what they're having like a little robot war the index you can just float and

4148
04:15:36,740 --> 04:15:49,780
sputter enough I mean I'm on Cortana's side but you have no idea how this ring works do you

4149
04:15:49,780 --> 04:15:57,620
why the forerunners built it halo doesn't kill flood it kills their food humans covenant whatever

4150
04:15:58,100 --> 04:16:04,500
we are all equally edible the only way to stop the flood is to starve them to death the ring

4151
04:16:04,500 --> 04:16:11,300
is exactly what halo is designed to do wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life you don't

4152
04:16:11,300 --> 04:16:18,900
believe me ask him we just about nuked everyone I'm just a grunt following orders I don't know what

4153
04:16:18,980 --> 04:16:19,460
you're on about

4154
04:16:22,580 --> 04:16:28,660
he doesn't even care as a maximum of more less than 25,000 light years but once the others follow

4155
04:16:28,660 --> 04:16:33,860
suit this galaxy will be quite a lot of life or at least any life with sufficient violence

4156
04:16:33,860 --> 04:16:36,740
to sustain the flood I mean yeah

4157
04:16:38,980 --> 04:16:45,700
sort of baseline and are they can I say something controversial was the development team british

4158
04:16:45,700 --> 04:16:49,860
by any chance as we manage this crisis I'm getting a vape though the rubric

4159
04:16:50,740 --> 04:16:58,740
I may just make that up we need to go right now last time you asked me if it were my choice

4160
04:16:58,740 --> 04:17:04,820
would I do it having had considerable time to ponder your query my answer is not changed

4161
04:17:05,540 --> 04:17:12,580
there is no choice we must activate the ring can I shoot the bowl get us out of here if you are

4162
04:17:12,580 --> 04:17:19,140
unwilling to help I will simply find another still I must have the index is he about to turn

4163
04:17:19,140 --> 04:17:28,180
on me I will be forced to take her from you that's not going to happen so weird save us and dispose of

4164
04:17:28,180 --> 04:17:36,180
the rest look out why is this my weapon

4165
04:17:36,900 --> 04:17:46,820
and let's try buddy what's laser at least like a mad really bad disco in the lakes are malfunctioning

4166
04:17:56,420 --> 04:18:03,540
what's this funky tune is playing we can't let the monitor activate halo we have to stop him we

4167
04:18:03,540 --> 04:18:09,140
have to destroy halo according to my analysis of the available data I believe the best course

4168
04:18:13,140 --> 04:18:18,260
size will help destabilize the ring and we'll cut through a number of primary systems we need to

4169
04:18:18,260 --> 04:18:24,100
trigger a detonation on a large scale however starships fusion reactors going critical

4170
04:18:25,380 --> 04:18:28,980
how could the guilty spark be so guilty to search what's left of the

4171
04:18:28,980 --> 04:18:33,540
covenant battle night and see if I can locate the pillar of this music is so funky though I'm not

4172
04:18:33,540 --> 04:18:38,180
fusion reactors are still relatively intact we can use them to destroy halo

4173
04:18:41,220 --> 04:18:46,980
door time I press e on a door to open it yes yes yes I'm so smart

4174
04:18:49,060 --> 04:18:56,740
wait so the covenants never the problem wait these are going to turn on us yeah is this a

4175
04:18:59,700 --> 04:19:06,340
coming in not now can you guys oh right okay this is one of the things that I have a great

4176
04:19:06,340 --> 04:19:10,340
with it's when two enemies are fighting you enter the room and they both look at you as if you're

4177
04:19:10,340 --> 04:19:18,900
the problem and they were literally just tearing each other apart moments before stop it stop it

4178
04:19:18,900 --> 04:19:27,460
oh my shield stone hold on let me just get my shield back one second

4179
04:19:28,740 --> 04:19:34,260
I need my shield miss the shotgun the new one just doesn't feel congrats you now have no allies at all

4180
04:19:34,900 --> 04:19:38,260
literally enter a room

4181
04:19:38,260 --> 04:19:45,620
um

4182
04:19:48,420 --> 04:19:55,060
I am prefiring oh I guess that was a waste uh I thought there was going to be an enemy that

4183
04:19:55,060 --> 04:19:59,620
pops out and goes behind them you're doing pretty good am I

4184
04:20:00,340 --> 04:20:08,500
I have no idea like how far we are through or anything like that

4185
04:20:08,500 --> 04:20:13,860
in case the monitor or his sentinels find a way to activate halo's final weapon without the index

4186
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:19,940
ain't a free bug the machinery in these cannons are halo's primary firing mechanisms they consist

4187
04:20:19,940 --> 04:20:25,700
of three phase pulse generators that amplify halo's signal and allow it to fire deep into space

4188
04:20:26,260 --> 04:20:31,620
the power levels are enormous I can't even begin to calculate the pulses range wait there wasn't

4189
04:20:31,620 --> 04:20:36,900
even anything up here so if we damage or destroy these generators the monitor will need to

4190
04:20:38,340 --> 04:20:44,180
wait there's only four billets some time oh there's not enough billets for his pulse generator with

4191
04:20:44,180 --> 04:20:50,020
a nav point we need to move in you're about the latter half getting close to the end fancy time

4192
04:20:50,100 --> 04:20:51,060
okay time to drive

4193
04:20:53,780 --> 04:21:00,180
no you don't want to hurt halo don't heal from the hit video game halo no get the pistol actually

4194
04:21:06,740 --> 04:21:11,540
wait where is my does he even know where my banshee is or did it get despawned I feel like

4195
04:21:11,540 --> 04:21:13,540
this mission is like far too big

4196
04:21:18,740 --> 04:21:20,580
yeah I don't have a banshee

4197
04:21:23,940 --> 04:21:25,300
but that aimbot is terrible

4198
04:21:32,500 --> 04:21:33,780
where is banshee

4199
04:21:36,100 --> 04:21:38,820
no one asks how is banshee but where is banshee

4200
04:21:39,700 --> 04:21:42,260
oh god that is green

4201
04:21:45,060 --> 04:21:46,740
oh I found it it's over there

4202
04:21:51,140 --> 04:21:54,820
does that hurt my shield I didn't expect that

4203
04:21:57,860 --> 04:22:01,780
is that gonna hurt me too if I messed up I think I'm about to lose health

4204
04:22:02,180 --> 04:22:05,300
unless I can hate and get my shield back

4205
04:22:06,980 --> 04:22:08,500
I'm such a stealth assassin

4206
04:22:10,340 --> 04:22:13,380
I got stolen shouldn't have parked in such a bad neighborhood on

4207
04:22:15,540 --> 04:22:16,980
as if there's a race

4208
04:22:19,700 --> 04:22:26,340
as if there's a race just waiting it's not gonna like get me right it's not gonna get me right

4209
04:22:27,300 --> 04:22:34,660
it's clearly don't get to get me right up get up get up up up up up up up up up up up up up up

4210
04:22:35,860 --> 04:22:36,180
okay

4211
04:22:39,380 --> 04:22:45,460
okay I think we're safe oh no we're not what the heck how do you control this

4212
04:22:49,380 --> 04:22:53,540
I want to shoot um before a lunge what the heck this is so odd

4213
04:22:53,860 --> 04:22:58,900
that's very odd driving how do you even use those in multiplayer when you have to like try

4214
04:22:58,900 --> 04:23:05,380
and kill other people John 117 Master Chief is a great character you mean John Halo from Fortnight

4215
04:23:07,300 --> 04:23:09,380
I'm trolling before anyone is like

4216
04:23:14,420 --> 04:23:14,980
what's this

4217
04:23:15,540 --> 04:23:18,020
that's the pulse generator the center core

4218
04:23:21,460 --> 04:23:26,180
we need to interrupt the pulse generator's energy stream I've adjusted your shield system

4219
04:23:26,180 --> 04:23:30,740
so that it will deliver an EMP burst to disrupt the generator that you'll need to walk into the

4220
04:23:30,740 --> 04:23:37,300
beam to trigger it the EMP blast should neutralize the generator but what to do

4221
04:23:37,700 --> 04:23:39,700
ah

4222
04:23:45,700 --> 04:23:51,300
uh-huh the generator's central core is offline well done oh peace off

4223
04:23:54,420 --> 04:23:55,060
oh peace off

4224
04:23:59,300 --> 04:23:59,780
am I done

4225
04:23:59,780 --> 04:24:01,780
I'm done

4226
04:24:04,260 --> 04:24:07,220
that's Johnny I got someone to listen to the hypnosis they want to work

4227
04:24:13,220 --> 04:24:15,300
the adjacent canyon okay

4228
04:24:17,860 --> 04:24:20,660
another throw another one to add to my pooch

4229
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:30,100
why is this so hard to steer oh my gosh

4230
04:24:32,020 --> 04:24:36,260
I absolutely have no comprehension on how I'm supposed to drive those

4231
04:24:37,620 --> 04:24:41,540
gotta run for a bit have a good night enjoy yourself love you Ethan

4232
04:24:42,980 --> 04:24:48,340

4233
04:24:48,340 --> 04:24:55,060
hanging with the covenant I definitely I can't believe I'm seeing this about the enemy

4234
04:24:55,060 --> 04:24:58,100

just came yeah okay right I'm not supposed to go there yet until I'm wanting to

4239
04:25:31,780 --> 04:25:37,380
the adjacent is how I learned what I meant oh that's what happened in a lot of video games

4240
04:25:37,380 --> 04:25:41,780
for me I was like oh that's what that word means I'm not going to look to the

4241
04:25:41,780 --> 04:25:45,220

4242

4247
04:26:21,060 --> 04:26:22,500
I do love like quick ones

4248
04:26:23,860 --> 04:26:25,380

04:26:31,300 --> 04:26:32,820
if I can do this really fast I don't know

4251
04:26:33,700 --> 04:26:37,940
oh it's not working what the heck I thought it was like

4252

hmm I wasn't really doing what I wanted to do you know I did math effect sometimes

4253
04:26:42,580 --> 04:26:45,380

04:27:02,820 --> 04:27:06,740
and I don't know what to do

4257
04:27:10,900 --> 04:27:12,100

4258
04:27:15,380 --> 04:27:19,380

okay the government and the flutter are oh my god could you be any more scarier

4269
04:28:30,100 --> 04:28:37,060
there's nothing worse than when the jump animation actually isn't animated and you can just see it come into

4270
04:28:37,060 --> 04:28:42,580
you in 4k and you've no got you've no got a clue you're going the right way okay just keep running

You understand me?

04:35:29,060 --> 04:35:31,060
Is that the wall?

4354
04:35:31,060 --> 04:35:33,060
Oh look at this!

4355
04:35:35,060 --> 04:35:37,060
Oh look at this!

4356
04:35:39,060 --> 04:35:41,060
No!

4357
04:35:43,060 --> 04:35:44,060
Monk.

4358
04:35:44,060 --> 04:35:47,060
Oh it's a dead end. I love finding the dead end.

4359
04:35:47,060 --> 04:35:51,060
Oh my god, I should find all the dead ends in this game for fun.

4360
04:35:51,060 --> 04:35:53,060
Just for the hell of it.

4361
04:35:53,060 --> 04:36:00,060
Nice death. Nice death. No. We'll watch the clip again and again.

4362
04:36:00,060 --> 04:36:05,060
Abra. If you use the clip in my desk, I'll get Arista to make it short of me just going

4363
04:36:05,060 --> 04:36:13,560
like every time I die. Wait, am I to walk into this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't

4364
04:36:13,560 --> 04:36:22,980
know what the answer is. Oh my god, they're like greveling at me. I don't know where

4365
04:36:22,980 --> 04:36:32,980
to go. I'm stuck in this room? Wait, how did I come in? No. I'm not stuck. I'm being

4366
04:36:32,980 --> 04:36:41,980
silly. Okay, but what's the actual answer though? What must I do? Is this the way I

4367
04:36:41,980 --> 04:36:49,980
came? This stuff all looks the same. Oh no, it says checkpoint. Okay, it says checkpoint.

4368
04:36:49,980 --> 04:36:55,980
We're winning. Let's take care of the next pulse generator. Okay, pulse generator. I love

4369
04:36:55,980 --> 04:37:02,980
pulse generators. I love pulsing all over a generator. I'm going to pulse so badly on

4370
04:37:02,980 --> 04:37:23,980
the generator. I'm about to get knocked out. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need this. Give me that.

4371
04:37:23,980 --> 04:37:31,980
I need it to get across the chasm. I need you to pulse my gen. Okay, well that didn't

4372
04:37:31,980 --> 04:37:37,980
work. How is the flood out here in the cold? Come on. Don't you get like hypothermia or

4373
04:37:37,980 --> 04:37:45,980
something? Your miserable bams, honestly. Weird. What am I supposed to do? Get up there.

4374
04:37:46,980 --> 04:37:53,980
In order to do that. Oh my god, am I at the distance for them? No, I can't be. I must be.

4375
04:37:53,980 --> 04:38:02,980
Where's the goat? Yeah, at the bench. Please pulse on me. She pulsed on my generator until

4376
04:38:02,980 --> 04:38:10,980
I overloaded. Honestly, that's absolutely. How or where? This? No, that's just the four

4377
04:38:10,980 --> 04:38:26,980
of them. Look at them all at the wall. Is one of them raiding that? What? Oh, come on.

4378
04:38:26,980 --> 04:38:32,980
I literally thought one of the wee floods were raiding that. Don't be so silly. What was

4379
04:38:32,980 --> 04:38:41,980
that? That literally was so rude. Sorry. That was so rude. I thought a wee flood was on

4380
04:38:41,980 --> 04:38:50,980
it. Right. No, yous are all getting ignored because you're wasting my time. How am I supposed

4381
04:38:50,980 --> 04:38:56,980
to get up there? Do you mind? I'm literally on foot. Sorry, I can't seem to figure out

4382
04:38:56,980 --> 04:39:12,980
what I'm supposed to do to get up. Am I supposed to go back? Like this way? Quickly. Oh my god.

4383
04:39:12,980 --> 04:39:22,980
Am I supposed to go this way? No, this is where I came in the tank. Is it? I'm so sorry.

4384
04:39:22,980 --> 04:39:31,980
I'm a bit turned around right now. Is it this? Yeah, no, I'm supposed to go this way. Okay.

4385
04:39:31,980 --> 04:39:37,980
Thank god you guys are gamers. I'll let you guys be the gamer. I'll just commentate over

4386
04:39:37,980 --> 04:39:49,980
your gameplay. What a strange, strange map. Checkpoint done. Okay. Why is it giving me loads

4387
04:39:49,980 --> 04:39:59,980
of nades? This makes me nervous. Maybe just a reload station. The whole game is kind of

4388
04:39:59,980 --> 04:40:20,980
a forward than a backward. Okay. Alright. I'm so confuzzled but it's okay. Wait. No, keep

4389
04:40:20,980 --> 04:40:24,980
going, keep going. Everything looks like a dead end in this game and then it's not and

4390
04:40:24,980 --> 04:40:34,980
it should be Banshee closer to where you need to get going. Checkpoint done. I need my glasses

4391
04:40:34,980 --> 04:40:45,980
on. I need to start gaming with my glycs, honestly. Okay, hunters, that's fine. If they only shoot

4392
04:40:45,980 --> 04:40:52,980
from afar, can I outrun them completely? Honestly, that looks like some Harry Potter magic when

4393
04:40:52,980 --> 04:40:59,980
Harry and Olivia's off. I'm going to just let yous do your thing. We're going to agree

4394
04:40:59,980 --> 04:41:06,980
to disagree. I don't need to die. Go up the middle part. Oh no, middle part and this is

4395
04:41:06,980 --> 04:41:20,980
locked. Is that a wraith when I'm on foot? Come on. I see lights over here. No point in

4396
04:41:20,980 --> 04:41:31,980
suffering because I can't even see. Oh yeah, yous. What the fuck? I'm literally on foot.

4397
04:41:31,980 --> 04:41:39,980
Don't auto lock to me, you freak. Let me deal with you first, you bam. Give me the plane.

4398
04:41:39,980 --> 04:41:47,980
Give me it. Okay, well, I can't take it now because I destroyed it. That's a bit overkill.

4399
04:41:47,980 --> 04:41:54,980
Come on, I'm literally just a guy. What are you aiming at? Can it not aim at me properly?

4400
04:41:54,980 --> 04:42:02,980
Oh well, we solved that fucking case, didn't we? Oh my god, stop moving. I'm going to cry.

4401
04:42:02,980 --> 04:42:11,980
Please stop moving. Much more like it. Right, where the heck is this banshee that I'm supposed

4402
04:42:11,980 --> 04:42:26,980
to do? Because I aim bot. Run. Nah, you can't steal banshees once they're gone. Oh, there

4403
04:42:26,980 --> 04:42:32,980
is, there is. I found it, I found it. Don't worry. You stop shooting at me. You leave me

4404
04:42:32,980 --> 04:42:37,980
alone. I'm just going in the sky. I'm sending it. I'm sending it. Sorry, I'm going. It's

4405
04:42:37,980 --> 04:42:44,980
not my concern what you guys do on the ground. I'm part of the air superior, you know.

4406
04:42:44,980 --> 04:42:50,980
Okay, up, up, up, and then along.

4407
04:42:50,980 --> 04:43:00,980
Oh, it's right. Let's get out. Woo! That's why we're getting out as soon as we can.

4408
04:43:00,980 --> 04:43:07,980
Okay, we did it. We did it. Checkpoint complete.

4409
04:43:07,980 --> 04:43:19,980
Loading. Okay, I'm going to have one, one review about this game. I know they were so

4410
04:43:19,980 --> 04:43:26,980
limited with memory space and what the actual console could do, but this is getting very

4411
04:43:27,980 --> 04:43:33,980
incredibly samey. I'm struggling to be like, I don't know what to do as soon as I enter

4412
04:43:33,980 --> 04:43:39,980
this location. It's all chaos and terrible and everything's awful and I've just killed

4413
04:43:39,980 --> 04:43:48,980
myself, I think. Oh wait, I'm to walk into this. Okay.

4414
04:43:49,980 --> 04:43:57,980
Bro, I'm dead. I'm actually dead.

4415
04:44:05,980 --> 04:44:15,980
I don't... Is this where I came from?

4416
04:44:15,980 --> 04:44:21,980
I don't know how I'm doing this. I really don't, darlings, I really don't. Oh my God,

4417
04:44:21,980 --> 04:44:25,980
my ghost is literally, I'm even, it's going to drop me.

4418
04:44:32,980 --> 04:44:41,980
Oh, it's fucking getting this before I can't. I don't know how to freaking drive these.

4419
04:44:41,980 --> 04:44:44,980
It's so bizarre. Like, it's honestly so bizarre.

4420
04:44:56,980 --> 04:45:03,980
Excuse me. Where am I to go? Damn. Hold on, I'm going to swap for a banshee that isn't

4421
04:45:03,980 --> 04:45:08,980
freaking... Am I actually supposed to go down or am I being trolled right now? Did you beat

4422
04:45:08,980 --> 04:45:10,980
me? No, I suck.

4423
04:45:13,980 --> 04:45:15,980
Let's go down.

4424
04:45:15,980 --> 04:45:18,980
If you switch weapons on the banshee, you can get a bomb.

4425
04:45:26,980 --> 04:45:32,980
Uh, I can skip all the fights because I'm flying. Love it here. I love a good flight

4426
04:45:32,980 --> 04:45:34,980
skipping. Don't mind if I do.

4427
04:45:45,980 --> 04:45:51,980
Oh, really? Hold on. Right, ready? And then get back in.

4428
04:45:56,980 --> 04:45:57,980
Oh shit.

4429
04:45:58,980 --> 04:46:04,980
How come they figure out what I want to do every time?

4430
04:46:07,980 --> 04:46:14,980
How come they go like, aww, she finally has it a bit easier. Let's make sure she can

4431
04:46:14,980 --> 04:46:21,980
take the banshee into the next area. How come the game devs always do that to me?

4432
04:46:21,980 --> 04:46:29,980
Like, just say you hate me. And none of this aww, then he take it personally, then he...

4433
04:46:29,980 --> 04:46:38,980
No, I'm taking it personal. 3, 4, 3? No! Literally, no. I'm not... I'm... I'm raging.

4434
04:46:39,980 --> 04:46:45,980
I'm raging! You fucking witch, you are scary. I'm just getting mad now.

4435
04:46:46,980 --> 04:46:51,980
You wish you were scary, but you're not him. You will never be him.

4436
04:46:54,980 --> 04:46:57,980
You will never be John Halo from the hit video game Halo.

4437
04:47:00,980 --> 04:47:03,980
I'm already out of Granada's, but I've got to think...

4438
04:47:03,980 --> 04:47:06,980
They are handicapping you because you're too good, exactly.

4439
04:47:09,980 --> 04:47:11,980
Yeah, partially I'm out of ammo.

4440
04:47:11,980 --> 04:47:13,980
Rip. RIP.

4441
04:47:15,980 --> 04:47:17,980
From Fortnite?

4442
04:47:17,980 --> 04:47:19,980
Raging? I thought you were scouting.

4443
04:47:21,980 --> 04:47:25,980
Is this legendary difficulty? It is! It is!

4444
04:47:27,980 --> 04:47:30,980
I'll let Sheldon 360s on legendary and everything.

4445
04:47:33,980 --> 04:47:37,980
Is this one going to fall apart? Nope, I could fit a banshee through it if I wanted to.

4446
04:47:37,980 --> 04:47:45,980
If I so desired, I could fit the chunkiest, juiciest, fattest banshee through that doorway.

4447
04:47:46,980 --> 04:47:48,980
No lube.

4448
04:47:50,980 --> 04:47:53,980
It's called the final run, a bloody opse, so...

4449
04:47:53,980 --> 04:47:57,980
I can't even take any more, my wee heart's going to pop its wee clogs.

4450
04:47:58,980 --> 04:48:00,980
Destroy Pulse Gen 3, rip.

4451
04:48:01,980 --> 04:48:05,980
Let's ignore the fight and let's get down to what we actually need to do.

4452
04:48:08,980 --> 04:48:11,980
Which is, we need to fly.

4453
04:48:13,980 --> 04:48:17,980
And in order to fly, we must find the secret banshee.

4454
04:48:18,980 --> 04:48:21,980
Sorry, Strony, there's more. No!

4455
04:48:22,980 --> 04:48:26,980
I'm going to expire! I'm going to expire midstream.

4456
04:48:31,980 --> 04:48:34,980
No! No!

4457
04:48:35,980 --> 04:48:37,980
Hello?

4458
04:48:38,980 --> 04:48:40,980
What was that?

4459
04:48:44,980 --> 04:48:46,980
What was that?

4460
04:48:47,980 --> 04:48:49,980
What was that?

4461
04:48:51,980 --> 04:48:55,980
I already expired, literally, called it to say we're hand on the fucking...

4462
04:48:55,980 --> 04:48:57,980
I said I'm going on a supermarket simulator.

4463
04:48:59,980 --> 04:49:02,980
At least this supermarket simulator gave me nice to me.

4464
04:49:02,980 --> 04:49:04,980
I'm like you.

4465
04:49:05,980 --> 04:49:06,980
Brave.

4466
04:49:06,980 --> 04:49:08,980
Did it have a RPG?

4467
04:49:19,980 --> 04:49:20,980
Okay.

4468
04:49:21,980 --> 04:49:23,980
Okay.

4469
04:49:23,980 --> 04:49:26,980
Okay, I see how it is.

4470
04:49:26,980 --> 04:49:29,980
I see how it is.

4471
04:49:30,980 --> 04:49:33,980
Not to be confused with Hit V Trooper or AC Snow Claws.

4472
04:49:33,980 --> 04:49:36,980
I see how it is.

4473
04:49:36,980 --> 04:49:39,980
Right, I've killed this banshee for the third time now.

4474
04:49:39,980 --> 04:49:41,980
This game needs to give it a rest.

4475
04:49:41,980 --> 04:49:43,980
Just give me the banshee!

4476
04:49:44,980 --> 04:49:46,980
Just give me the banshee.

4477
04:49:48,980 --> 04:49:50,980
No need, I'm out.

4478
04:49:51,980 --> 04:49:55,980
Look how long it took those, but then when I do it...

4479
04:49:56,980 --> 04:49:58,980
I'm stuck, no I'm not.

4480
04:50:00,980 --> 04:50:05,980
Did they already come out or am I about to be rocket launched for the billionth time?

4481
04:50:06,980 --> 04:50:09,980
Stop, I literally just saw all three of those.

4482
04:50:11,980 --> 04:50:13,980
Please!

4483
04:50:14,980 --> 04:50:16,980
Please let me win.

4484
04:50:17,980 --> 04:50:19,980
Please let me win.

4485
04:50:20,980 --> 04:50:22,980
Who's got the RPGs?

4486
04:50:22,980 --> 04:50:24,980
You need to be put down right now.

4487
04:50:25,980 --> 04:50:29,980
Seriously, whoever's got the RPGs needs to be put down right now.

4488
04:50:30,980 --> 04:50:32,980
Why are you sh-

4489
04:50:38,980 --> 04:50:40,980
I'm not gonna make it.

4490
04:50:45,980 --> 04:50:47,980
I'm not gonna make it.

4491
04:50:48,980 --> 04:50:50,980
Okay.

4492
04:51:04,980 --> 04:51:06,980
He was talking to himself.

4493
04:51:06,980 --> 04:51:07,980
Right, okay.

4494
04:51:07,980 --> 04:51:12,980
I need to go find the freaking banshee so I can get the heck off of this ground.

4495
04:51:12,980 --> 04:51:14,980
Because it's cursed.

4496
04:51:15,980 --> 04:51:17,980
I don't even see it over there.

4497
04:51:17,980 --> 04:51:19,980
Or am I to go through the cavern?

4498
04:51:21,980 --> 04:51:24,980
Is there a lore behind the nickname Momè?

4499
04:51:25,980 --> 04:51:29,980
It's not really that deep, it's just how you see it in a Scottish accent.

4500
04:51:29,980 --> 04:51:32,980
And I'm kinda seen as a bit motherly.

4501
04:51:34,980 --> 04:51:36,980
And it was a nice nickname so it stuck.

4502
04:51:36,980 --> 04:51:38,980
So now I'm called Momè.

4503
04:51:38,980 --> 04:51:41,980
But you can smell it like M-O or M-E.

4504
04:51:41,980 --> 04:51:43,980
M-E-A, sorry.

4505
04:51:43,980 --> 04:51:45,980
Sorry, I don't know my freaking words.

4506
04:51:45,980 --> 04:51:46,980
Right.

4507
04:51:46,980 --> 04:51:47,980
Give it a rest!

4508
04:51:47,980 --> 04:51:48,980
Give it a rest!

4509
04:51:48,980 --> 04:51:50,980
My heart can't eat this anymore.

4510
04:51:51,980 --> 04:51:52,980
I've got a checkpoint for that.

4511
04:51:52,980 --> 04:51:54,980
I don't know how I didn't do anything, but...

4512
04:51:55,980 --> 04:51:56,980
I'll beat it.

4513
04:51:56,980 --> 04:51:57,980
Mommy is Momè.

4514
04:51:58,980 --> 04:52:00,980
And then you're my little reflans.

4515
04:52:04,980 --> 04:52:08,980
Every time I do that with the ghost, stop.

4516
04:52:08,980 --> 04:52:11,980
Right, well that couldn't have gone any worse if I tried.

4517
04:52:11,980 --> 04:52:14,980
That literally couldn't have gone any worse if I tried.

4518
04:52:17,980 --> 04:52:18,980
Oh, it's a dead end!

4519
04:52:18,980 --> 04:52:20,980
Lovely, dead end.

4520
04:52:25,980 --> 04:52:29,980
Right, stop flipping over this fucking ghost, honestly.

4521
04:52:33,980 --> 04:52:36,980
I need the Banshee, wherever it is.

4522
04:52:39,980 --> 04:52:44,980
What is it when I get something that mildly aids me in my conquest?

4523
04:52:46,980 --> 04:52:47,980
Is this what I'm supposed to do?

4524
04:52:50,980 --> 04:52:51,980
Checkpoint.

4525
04:52:51,980 --> 04:52:52,980
Okay, it is.

4526
04:52:53,980 --> 04:52:55,980
Grab the spanker and spanko.

4527
04:52:55,980 --> 04:52:58,980
Mommy's foolish woman that makes me blush Momè.

4528
04:53:00,980 --> 04:53:02,980
Oh my giat.

4529
04:53:03,980 --> 04:53:07,980
Sticking out your giat for the wrestler.

4530
04:53:08,980 --> 04:53:10,980
Your sensitivity.

4531
04:53:11,980 --> 04:53:13,980
You're so found and stuffed.

4532
04:53:14,980 --> 04:53:16,980
There's literally two reefs.

4533
04:53:16,980 --> 04:53:17,980
Bro, I'm sorry.

4534
04:53:17,980 --> 04:53:20,980
I'm jumping in them reefs and I'm going.

4535
04:53:22,980 --> 04:53:25,980
Bro, you can literally lick my starfish.

4536
04:53:25,980 --> 04:53:27,980
I'm not doing this right now.

4537
04:53:27,980 --> 04:53:29,980
I am not doing this right now.

4538
04:53:33,980 --> 04:53:35,980
No, don't run me over either.

4539
04:53:36,980 --> 04:53:37,980
Fuck you, honestly.

4540
04:53:37,980 --> 04:53:39,980
Get me in this Banshee!

4541
04:53:42,980 --> 04:53:45,980
Oh, please get me in the air right fucking now.

4542
04:53:45,980 --> 04:53:46,980
Go.

4543
04:53:47,980 --> 04:53:48,980
Oh my gosh.

4544
04:53:50,980 --> 04:53:52,980
How is I, I'm so sorry.

4545
04:53:52,980 --> 04:53:54,980
I'm going to have to watch someone play legendary.

4546
04:53:55,980 --> 04:53:57,980
That is insanity.

4547
04:53:57,980 --> 04:54:01,980
That is insane in the membrane, genuinely.

4548
04:54:01,980 --> 04:54:02,980
How?

4549
04:54:04,980 --> 04:54:05,980
How?

4550
04:54:05,980 --> 04:54:06,980
I don't get it.

4551
04:54:07,980 --> 04:54:08,980
Get to the top.

4552
04:54:10,980 --> 04:54:11,980
Okay, we're here.

4553
04:54:11,980 --> 04:54:12,980
Thank the maker.

4554
04:54:12,980 --> 04:54:14,980
Please tell me this is the last mission.

4555
04:54:15,980 --> 04:54:16,980
Fuck off.

4556
04:54:16,980 --> 04:54:19,980
I'm not even, I've not even landed and you're going for me.

4557
04:54:19,980 --> 04:54:20,980
Get out of here.

4558
04:54:20,980 --> 04:54:21,980
Go away.

4559
04:54:23,980 --> 04:54:25,980
No, no, maybe this is better against them.

4560
04:54:25,980 --> 04:54:28,980
The flood is the shotgun, basically.

4561
04:54:29,980 --> 04:54:31,980
One pizza, of course.

4562
04:54:31,980 --> 04:54:34,980
They have shields, no!

4563
04:54:34,980 --> 04:54:36,980
When did they have shields?

4564
04:54:37,980 --> 04:54:39,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nice try mate.

4565
04:54:39,980 --> 04:54:40,980
Bonk.

4566
04:54:40,980 --> 04:54:41,980
Bonk.

4567
04:54:41,980 --> 04:54:42,980
Bonk.

4568
04:54:42,980 --> 04:54:44,980
Okay, was that three?

4569
04:54:44,980 --> 04:54:45,980
Bonk.

4570
04:54:45,980 --> 04:54:46,980
Bonk.

4571
04:54:46,980 --> 04:54:47,980
Bonk.

4572
04:54:47,980 --> 04:54:49,980
Bro, I'm getting laser beam today.

4573
04:54:49,980 --> 04:54:50,980
Relax.

4574
04:54:50,980 --> 04:54:51,980
Fuck you.

4575
04:54:51,980 --> 04:54:52,980
I'm shoving my arse in the gen.

4576
04:54:52,980 --> 04:54:53,980
Take that.

4577
04:54:53,980 --> 04:54:55,980
That's what I think of it.

4578
04:54:55,980 --> 04:54:56,980
Let's get out of here.

4579
04:54:58,980 --> 04:54:59,980
It's over.

4580
04:55:01,980 --> 04:55:02,980
Let's find a ride.

4581
04:55:02,980 --> 04:55:03,980
Good job now for the starfish.

4582
04:55:03,980 --> 04:55:04,980
No, it'll take too long.

4583
04:55:04,980 --> 04:55:05,980
You have a better idea.

4584
04:55:05,980 --> 04:55:08,980
There's a teleportation grid that runs throughout Halo.

4585
04:55:08,980 --> 04:55:10,980
That's how the monitor moves about today.

4586
04:55:10,980 --> 04:55:13,980
I learned how to tap into the grid when I was in the control center.

4587
04:55:13,980 --> 04:55:18,980
Unfortunately, each jump requires a rather consequential expenditure of energy.

4588
04:55:18,980 --> 04:55:21,980
Something tells me I'm not gonna like this.

4589
04:55:21,980 --> 04:55:24,980
But I'm pretty sure I can pull it from your suit without permanently damaging your shields.

4590
04:55:24,980 --> 04:55:27,980
Needless to say, I think we should only try this once.

4591
04:55:27,980 --> 04:55:28,980
Do it.

4592
04:55:32,980 --> 04:55:35,980
Cortana can't have beef for doing that.

4593
04:55:35,980 --> 04:55:36,980
She's good.

4594
04:55:42,980 --> 04:55:44,980
The Covenant Network is absolute chaos.

4595
04:55:44,980 --> 04:55:49,980
From what I've been able to piece together, their leadership ordered all ships to abandon

4596
04:55:49,980 --> 04:55:50,980
Halo when they found the flood.

4597
04:55:50,980 --> 04:55:55,980
I'm shoving my arse in the generator because it's the first thing that would reach my butt.

4598
04:55:55,980 --> 04:55:56,980
She...

4599
04:56:19,980 --> 04:56:20,980
Is this it?

4600
04:56:20,980 --> 04:56:21,980
Is this submission?

4601
04:56:25,980 --> 04:56:26,980
Oh, I see.

4602
04:56:26,980 --> 04:56:28,980
The Covenant data needs to be...

4603
04:56:28,980 --> 04:56:29,980
Right.

4604
04:56:29,980 --> 04:56:30,980
Sorry.

4605
04:56:31,980 --> 04:56:33,980
Is this the last mission?

4606
04:56:33,980 --> 04:56:35,980
Did we do it?

4607
04:56:35,980 --> 04:56:37,980
I hear the Halo music.

4608
04:56:43,980 --> 04:56:45,980
It's not my gun.

4609
04:56:45,980 --> 04:56:46,980
It's not my shot.

4610
04:56:47,980 --> 04:56:49,980
Don't do that!

4611
04:56:50,980 --> 04:56:54,980
I'm gonna pull a muscle in my shoulders at the rate I'm playing this game.

4612
04:56:54,980 --> 04:56:56,980
Oh my gosh.

4613
04:56:58,980 --> 04:57:00,980
They need to stop.

4614
04:57:00,980 --> 04:57:03,980
Stop with the tight corridors.

4615
04:57:03,980 --> 04:57:05,980
I'm begging.

4616
04:57:09,980 --> 04:57:10,980
I'm begging.

4617
04:57:10,980 --> 04:57:12,980
I can't even handle it.

4618
04:57:12,980 --> 04:57:13,980
Give me that.

4619
04:57:13,980 --> 04:57:14,980
Give me that.

4620
04:57:15,980 --> 04:57:16,980
Gonna make me go against the flood.

4621
04:57:16,980 --> 04:57:17,980
At least give me a shot.

4622
04:57:21,980 --> 04:57:22,980
Ow.

4623
04:57:22,980 --> 04:57:23,980
That hurt.

4624
04:57:25,980 --> 04:57:28,980
This is the second last mission.

4625
04:57:28,980 --> 04:57:29,980
Oh!

4626
04:57:29,980 --> 04:57:30,980
What?

4627
04:57:30,980 --> 04:57:31,980
Oh.

4628
04:57:31,980 --> 04:57:32,980
Wait.

4629
04:57:32,980 --> 04:57:33,980
I was supposed to do that?

4630
04:57:40,980 --> 04:57:41,980
Was that...

4631
04:57:41,980 --> 04:57:42,980
That was supposed to be done, right?

4632
04:57:42,980 --> 04:57:44,980
Because I got cutscene, right?

4633
04:57:48,980 --> 04:57:50,980
Uh...

4634
04:57:50,980 --> 04:57:53,980
I can hardly see a thing in here.

4635
04:57:53,980 --> 04:57:56,980
I can see it easier in OBS than that actual game.

4636
04:57:57,980 --> 04:57:58,980
Okay, I was supposed to do that.

4637
04:57:58,980 --> 04:57:59,980
Okay, that's good.

4638
04:57:59,980 --> 04:58:00,980
I'll take that.

4639
04:58:01,980 --> 04:58:03,980
Where am I supposed to go?

4640
04:58:07,980 --> 04:58:08,980
I can't see nothing.

4641
04:58:08,980 --> 04:58:09,980
Oh.

4642
04:58:09,980 --> 04:58:10,980
I forgot.

4643
04:58:11,980 --> 04:58:13,980
I have a flashlight.

4644
04:58:14,980 --> 04:58:16,980
Let's get powered by my shoot...

4645
04:58:18,980 --> 04:58:19,980
Okay, yeah.

4646
04:58:19,980 --> 04:58:20,980
The...

4647
04:58:20,980 --> 04:58:22,980
I don't know what rape will seem best.

4648
04:58:23,980 --> 04:58:24,980
I'm just ignoring.

4649
04:58:24,980 --> 04:58:25,980
Sorry.

4650
04:58:25,980 --> 04:58:26,980
I don't have time for this.

4651
04:58:28,980 --> 04:58:29,980
You guys...

4652
04:58:29,980 --> 04:58:30,980
Woo!

4653
04:58:30,980 --> 04:58:31,980
Mama!

4654
04:58:32,980 --> 04:58:33,980
Why?

4655
04:58:33,980 --> 04:58:34,980
Why?

4656
04:58:35,980 --> 04:58:36,980
Why?

4657
04:58:36,980 --> 04:58:38,980
What a wonderful day.

4658
04:58:38,980 --> 04:58:39,980
You should go this way.

4659
04:58:39,980 --> 04:58:40,980
Towards the ship's gravity.

4660
04:58:40,980 --> 04:58:42,980
Land deal enemies!

4661
04:58:42,980 --> 04:58:44,980
To ruin my day!

4662
04:58:45,980 --> 04:58:47,980
Zip-a-dee-doo-da!

4663
04:58:48,980 --> 04:58:51,980
Zip-a-dee-doo!

4664
04:58:53,980 --> 04:58:55,980
I'ma need that healthcare-

4665
04:58:55,980 --> 04:58:56,980
No!

4666
04:59:03,980 --> 04:59:05,980
Okay, keep her going.

4667
04:59:05,980 --> 04:59:06,980
Keep her going.

4668
04:59:06,980 --> 04:59:07,980
Keep her going.

4669
04:59:07,980 --> 04:59:08,980
Keep her going.

4670
04:59:08,980 --> 04:59:09,980
Keep her going.

4671
04:59:09,980 --> 04:59:10,980
Keep her going.

4672
04:59:10,980 --> 04:59:11,980
Rrrrrr!

4673
04:59:11,980 --> 04:59:12,980
Rrrrrrrrr!

4674
04:59:13,640 --> 04:59:14,980
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

4675
04:59:14,980 --> 04:59:25,820
Look at them smooth moves, smooth moves, love a bit of water, love a bit of water in

4676
04:59:25,820 --> 04:59:33,900
the map, this is raw copium we are working with, raw copium.

4677
04:59:33,900 --> 04:59:42,020
I freaking hope we were supposed to come down this way, I'm like about to run out of shotgun

4678
04:59:42,020 --> 04:59:43,020
ammo.

4679
04:59:43,020 --> 05:00:09,660
Let me in, hold your position, hold, hold, hold, weapons if you didn't make me hold

4680
05:00:09,660 --> 05:00:15,620
it and just teleported me up like right now, wouldn't that be so quirky if you didn't make

4681
05:00:15,620 --> 05:00:19,300
me defend and just let me go.

4682
05:00:19,300 --> 05:00:25,260
Okay that was so quirky of you, thank you, have a 10.

4683
05:00:25,260 --> 05:00:32,500
We should be able to get into the ship's control room from here, I can, there's only

4684
05:00:32,500 --> 05:00:36,500
two more to go, I can do it, it's fine.

4685
05:00:36,500 --> 05:01:00,380
Okay, okay, that's fine, oh they're coming by me as well, they're evolving, they're

4686
05:01:00,380 --> 05:01:23,460
evolving, they're evolving, they're evolving, for what, is that red, yep, he's gonna jump

4687
05:01:23,460 --> 05:01:30,060
back up, I'm gonna go please, no I don't want to assault rifle rounds, I want, I want

4688
05:01:30,060 --> 05:01:51,500
to show ease, oh my god, oh my god, okay well, okay what the actual fuck are you doing in

4689
05:01:51,500 --> 05:02:04,740
my house, this is impossible, this is impossible, the music isn't exactly helping you know keep

4690
05:02:04,740 --> 05:02:10,900
me up beat either about what's going on, oh my god please tell me this is the right way

4691
05:02:10,900 --> 05:02:15,500
because the door's open, I know the indicators tell me to go another way but I assume it's

4692
05:02:15,500 --> 05:02:27,860
like a, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, cheeky wee, cheeky wee, dead end, oh my god I love a dead end

4693
05:02:27,860 --> 05:02:31,380
I do, I really love it, they code it into the game, I absolutely adore it when you don't

4694
05:02:31,380 --> 05:02:40,860
just lock over the, okay, I love it, okay, the arrow and the gun is the compass, someone

4695
05:02:40,860 --> 05:02:46,980
told me it was no, I got spanked for thinking it was and I was like oh I'm just trying to

4696
05:02:46,980 --> 05:02:51,420
be a good girl, okay, I'm just trying to be a good girl and navigate this game, okay,

4697
05:02:51,420 --> 05:02:58,700
xee, oh my god why did they have to make this game so scary, why, I literally, oh let's

4698
05:02:58,700 --> 05:03:04,540
play a really McTuity shooty game, oh my god wouldn't that be so legit, oh my god, am I

4699
05:03:04,540 --> 05:03:16,260
going in circle, look in the corners, the flood are gathering bodies, am I just going

4700
05:03:16,260 --> 05:03:46,220
to run one big circle, huh, I thought I

4701
05:03:46,220 --> 05:04:03,580
always end up backwards, I'm like flabbergasted right now, okay, this is what happened last

4702
05:04:03,580 --> 05:04:15,780
time and then I went down that corridor that was open, well I'm going to have to go for

4703
05:04:15,780 --> 05:04:26,420
the dead bodies because they've got health on them, oh, why is there so many fucking

4704
05:04:26,420 --> 05:04:38,180
dead ends on this level, I've directionally challenged chromosomes, did I not go down

4705
05:04:38,180 --> 05:04:47,660
here and it was a dead end, or something, oh that's what I was supposed to do, yeah

4706
05:04:47,660 --> 05:04:53,420
sure, I was supposed to figure that one out real quick, bro, honestly how is that supposed

4707
05:04:53,420 --> 05:05:04,740
to figure out it's a freaking hole, only you would be able to do that, wait what, I'm sorry

4708
05:05:05,100 --> 05:05:18,420
I just think the game hates me, I literally need ammo of any accord, Covenant if we could

4709
05:05:18,420 --> 05:05:40,100
just join teams for a millisecond, who, who, who is anyone supposed to complete this game

4710
05:05:40,100 --> 05:06:02,580
if they're not in easy mode please, oh right, right, I'm not being funny, I'm not being

4711
05:06:02,900 --> 05:06:14,500
funny, I've been at this for like, go here do this, reverse the entirety of what you've

4712
05:06:14,500 --> 05:06:18,420
been going here to do, I don't even know where I'm going, I'm going down apparently, I don't

4713
05:06:18,420 --> 05:06:24,420
think I'm supposed to be going down, I'm supposed to be going up, I'm supposed to be going up

4714
05:06:24,420 --> 05:06:36,260
in that top corner, still not one friendly fire accident, by not using the assault rifle

4715
05:06:37,300 --> 05:06:45,780
it's a bad weapon on Legendary, I'm like having to guess where to go, I know the game's older

4716
05:06:45,780 --> 05:06:51,620
and they didn't have navigation like that but oh my god, someone's getting farted on it by the end

4717
05:06:51,700 --> 05:06:56,260
of this game, I don't know if it's the developers or you guys I'm farting on but someone's getting

4718
05:07:01,940 --> 05:07:10,900
am I going the wrong way, hand holding for modern game, literally, so this is locked so I'm going

4719
05:07:10,900 --> 05:07:23,060
the wrong way, who are you shooting at as if the flood's not being chillin' in here as I volunteer

4720
05:07:24,580 --> 05:07:29,620
I'm struggling after I admit, I'm struggling, right okay so this is just a look at the bottom

4721
05:07:29,620 --> 05:07:37,380
that you can randomly enter because why not, yep so all these are locked, I can't go in a hole,

4722
05:07:37,380 --> 05:07:44,420
okay I'm satisfied, so we're going to come out of here and we're going to go back up the stairs

4723
05:07:45,060 --> 05:07:49,220
that we came from, the game let us in

4724
05:07:58,660 --> 05:08:03,620
oh my god I need such a freaking shower after the stream, that view is

4725
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:12,580
no you guys are like, we actually don't know how, we've never done it before

4726
05:08:14,500 --> 05:08:22,020
I'd never make you pull out that terrible, thank you basically was the tip, literally it was like

4727
05:08:22,660 --> 05:08:27,220
refling's pillow, we actually don't know how, we've never done it before

4728
05:08:28,180 --> 05:08:38,740
some of the dead ends provide a lore friendly spawning place, that's what I'm like 100%

4729
05:08:38,740 --> 05:08:43,540
convinced it is to drop, you get a rest

4730
05:08:51,060 --> 05:08:56,580
not even the gods could fill me a leg locked in, I do have strong legs, you're going to see

4731
05:08:56,660 --> 05:08:59,140
by the end of this week you'll see how my thighs look

4732
05:09:01,700 --> 05:09:05,620
okay give me that gun, 10 rounds for that

4733
05:09:10,100 --> 05:09:12,660
how is it, it seems almost ineffective, oh

4734
05:09:15,940 --> 05:09:19,780
just chaos, I know the good kind likes, I'm going to pop back up

4735
05:09:20,100 --> 05:09:30,100
oh my goodness, can't he manage it, can't cut it

4736
05:09:31,060 --> 05:09:34,420
oh

4737
05:09:41,460 --> 05:09:52,420
we're almost there, oh yes, we're almost there, and he still survived that, a freaking grenade

4738
05:09:53,140 --> 05:09:59,140
oh my god, chain mayor, else you believed, younger

4739
05:10:01,940 --> 05:10:03,140
this is a nightmare

4740
05:10:09,540 --> 05:10:16,740
hurry, how Cortana, please be so for real darlin, what am I looking at

4741
05:10:17,300 --> 05:10:21,540
oh my god, is there a part of the fucking thing

4742
05:10:26,900 --> 05:10:35,060
oh my god, you'll need an 80 min to pull me out, oh my god, pull me out, it's misery

4743
05:10:35,700 --> 05:10:40,980
no human life signs detected, the captain, he's one of them

4744
05:10:42,340 --> 05:10:47,140
that's a horror story, we can't let the flood get off this ring, you know what he'd expect

4745
05:10:50,180 --> 05:10:51,700
what he'd want us to do

4746
05:10:51,860 --> 05:10:53,860
oh

4747
05:11:05,940 --> 05:11:11,860
oh you're not even, bro, you're not even gonna take me out

4748
05:11:11,860 --> 05:11:19,860
no, go up my arsehole, honestly, take me back

4749
05:11:22,660 --> 05:11:28,260
the game's telling me I've been going the wrong way this whole time, oh and this is fun location

4750
05:11:32,420 --> 05:11:36,900
you're not gonna give me any advice, you're gonna tell me which direction to go in

4751
05:11:37,540 --> 05:11:38,040
and

4752
05:11:41,140 --> 05:11:45,300
at least wind and dive me before you fuck me so hard

4753
05:11:47,380 --> 05:11:56,820
please, where am I going, there's no indication, this, there's no ship, I'm going the wrong way

4754
05:11:56,820 --> 05:11:58,100
but I don't know where to go

4755
05:12:07,860 --> 05:12:14,340
okay it is here, apparently, unless that's just to be a drop ship, just upset me even more

4756
05:12:15,060 --> 05:12:20,420
because it's working, grab one of the escort vans and see the music to return to the robot

4757
05:12:21,940 --> 05:12:28,340
where, oh my god, you actually used the HUD for once, thank you Cortana, you're wet far

4758
05:12:28,900 --> 05:12:35,380
I'll actually let me hide under these, I'll let my thing go full

4759
05:12:36,980 --> 05:12:43,220
and then get out of my way, yabba bags, I'm out, bye, don't give a fuck

4760
05:12:46,260 --> 05:12:51,220
literally get me out, what a nightmare of a map, seriously

4761
05:12:58,340 --> 05:13:04,100
my brain's too strong, sorry, you need to splash yellow paint everywhere for me, you do, I don't

4762
05:13:04,100 --> 05:13:11,940
care if that makes me xyz or whatever, done and done, final level, here we go and the horse you

4763
05:13:11,940 --> 05:13:17,220
rode in on, what, go back home and the horse you rode in on

4764
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:39,220
so

4765
05:13:47,860 --> 05:13:53,140
I'm gonna blow up the ship to blow up the ship, bro I'm gonna need you guys to blow my

4766
05:13:53,140 --> 05:13:58,020
fucking ring out after this one just to make me less angry

4767
05:14:11,060 --> 05:14:18,740
okay that's kind of funny though, yay the hardest level, don't, don't speak such things into

4768
05:14:18,740 --> 05:14:27,620
existence, I'm sure this will be the most clearly designed, oh my god it really is going backward

4769
05:14:34,020 --> 05:14:41,460
it really is going backwards, really, she's using, oh you, you, you bams you, oh I'm scared

4770
05:14:41,700 --> 05:14:51,700
oh and I just, I deserved it honestly, oh my god, this is 10 times worse than I could have

4771
05:14:51,700 --> 05:14:56,340
estimated, I'm gonna be honest, do I have a shotgun, nope you're not a shotgun, just to ruin my day

4772
05:14:56,340 --> 05:15:03,220
uh

4773
05:15:04,820 --> 05:15:07,220
bruh why, why, why, why

4774
05:15:26,500 --> 05:15:37,700
in me, I wanted that weight, something, something, something, why are you holding

4775
05:15:37,700 --> 05:15:46,980
a gun like that, drop it, bad grunt, over the please and I'm going the wrong way, yay I love

4776
05:15:46,980 --> 05:15:49,620
going the wrong way

4777
05:15:54,340 --> 05:15:56,420
this is a dead end, I'm not even supposed to be here

4778
05:15:59,140 --> 05:16:02,820
oh my god I have a crazy concept for the development team

4779
05:16:05,380 --> 05:16:11,380
stop making it possible to go in locations that are dead ends, checkpoint done apparently, well

4780
05:16:11,460 --> 05:16:14,100
it's not in right, it's just a shotgun

4781
05:16:17,700 --> 05:16:19,220
wait why did it just load

4782
05:16:23,540 --> 05:16:28,660
you're trolling right, you're having a funny ha ha right, I literally just cleared that out

4783
05:16:29,540 --> 05:16:34,180
but because I came too quickly, oh you got something against premature ejaculate, what the

4784
05:16:34,180 --> 05:16:37,540
fuck, I never loaded it because uh

4785
05:16:43,380 --> 05:16:49,620
oh I'm one health, sorry I'm about to die, I'm sorry I'm literally not paying attention

4786
05:16:52,500 --> 05:16:53,380
give me that one I guess

4787
05:16:55,780 --> 05:16:58,180
I'm literally just tonight, I'm fucking trolling

4788
05:16:59,140 --> 05:17:03,140
sorry, oh good, now the door opened, well we got health kit so

4789
05:17:06,820 --> 05:17:11,780
what worked katana, there's nothing here

4790
05:17:12,180 --> 05:17:15,380
hey

4791
05:17:30,820 --> 05:17:34,980
right we're in the bridge right, what happens next katana, come on then, come on then you

4792
05:17:34,980 --> 05:17:35,940
take the effect

4793
05:17:38,500 --> 05:17:39,940
what, what do I do

4794
05:17:43,940 --> 05:17:47,940
what am I supposed to do, she said we're in the bridge, yeah we're in the bridge, do something

4795
05:17:55,060 --> 05:17:59,060
did you prevent, oh okay, okay I see how it is

4796
05:17:59,060 --> 05:18:05,940
next to the main view screen, the main view screen, there isn't a main view screen, everything's destroyed

4797
05:18:08,900 --> 05:18:12,580
I leave home for a few days and look what happens, this won't take long

4798
05:18:14,100 --> 05:18:20,260
there, that should give us enough time to make it to a lifeboat and put some distance between ourselves and the people before the dead nation

4799
05:18:22,900 --> 05:18:27,140
I'm not actually under the quote, oh hell

4800
05:18:29,060 --> 05:18:35,860
you wouldn't view a warship's AI with such a wealth of knowledge, weren't you worried it might be captured or destroyed

4801
05:18:36,740 --> 05:18:38,900
he's in my data arrays, a local tab

4802
05:18:40,260 --> 05:18:45,460
you can't imagine how exciting this is to have a record of all of our lost time

4803
05:18:46,260 --> 05:18:49,140
human history isn't fascinating

4804
05:18:49,140 --> 05:18:50,360
huh

4805
05:19:19,140 --> 05:19:25,140
You cannot win! Give us the construct, and I will endeavor to make your death relatively famous, and...

4806
05:19:25,140 --> 05:19:27,140
At least I still have control over the comm channels.

4807
05:19:27,140 --> 05:19:28,140
Where is he?

4808
05:19:28,140 --> 05:19:32,140
I'm detecting taps throughout the ship. Sentinels most likely. As for the monitor...

4809
05:19:33,140 --> 05:19:36,140
He's an engineering. He must be trying to take the core offline.

4810
05:19:36,140 --> 05:19:40,140
Even if I could get the countdown restarted, I don't know what to do.

4811
05:19:40,140 --> 05:19:44,140
How much firepower would you need to crack one of the engine shields?

4812
05:19:44,140 --> 05:19:47,140
Not much. A well-placed grenade, perhaps, but why...

4813
05:19:49,140 --> 05:19:52,140
But why? And he's instantly, like, fucking tossing that shit.

4814
05:19:52,140 --> 05:19:54,140
Okay, I'm coming with you.

4815
05:19:55,140 --> 05:19:56,140
Yeah, you're...

4816
05:19:56,140 --> 05:19:57,140
Sentinels.

4817
05:19:57,140 --> 05:19:58,140
We're not leaving our brain.

4818
05:20:01,140 --> 05:20:03,140
What was learning about humanity?

4819
05:20:07,140 --> 05:20:10,140
The basic of muster-up is fascinating.

4820
05:20:14,140 --> 05:20:16,140
Okay, we good? We good?

4821
05:20:16,140 --> 05:20:18,140
Hang out a little cheeky-heel?

4822
05:20:18,140 --> 05:20:20,140
Hang out a little cheeky-heel?

4823
05:20:30,140 --> 05:20:33,140
Uh, I assume back the way I came, somehow?

4824
05:20:33,140 --> 05:20:37,140
Well, the music started up, so I'm gonna take that as a use.

4825
05:20:47,140 --> 05:20:48,140
Right.

4826
05:20:54,140 --> 05:20:55,140
Right.

4827
05:20:59,140 --> 05:21:02,140
I don't know what to say. I'm a bit speechless right now.

4828
05:21:02,140 --> 05:21:03,140
I don't know.

4829
05:21:14,140 --> 05:21:16,140
Alright, we're getting it, we're getting it, we're getting it, we're getting it.

4830
05:21:16,140 --> 05:21:19,140
Don't worry, we're not, we're not quitting or anything like that.

4831
05:21:20,140 --> 05:21:23,140
I'm just a bit out of words in terms of, like...

4832
05:21:25,140 --> 05:21:26,140
You know...

4833
05:21:28,140 --> 05:21:29,140
Let's wrap it up.

4834
05:21:33,140 --> 05:21:35,140
I'm not even bothering to fight.

4835
05:21:36,140 --> 05:21:38,140
I will happily move on.

4836
05:21:40,140 --> 05:21:41,140
Nope.

4837
05:21:48,140 --> 05:21:54,140
It just seems like the best way to do it is to just fucking bash past it.

4838
05:21:55,140 --> 05:21:56,140
Sorry.

4839
05:21:56,140 --> 05:21:59,140
I'm enjoying this game, I'm just a bit like...

4840
05:22:00,140 --> 05:22:07,140
The backtracking through the same maps, the getting confused, where the heck are we heading, where the heck are we going?

4841
05:22:07,140 --> 05:22:13,140
It's a bit like, oh my god, wrap it up, please, I'm happy, I'm happy, we're gonna win, I'm happy, you know...

4842
05:22:13,140 --> 05:22:16,140
We got the halo rings and all that ting, but...

4843
05:22:16,140 --> 05:22:18,140
Oh my god, please wrap it up, I'm dying.

4844
05:22:18,140 --> 05:22:20,140
I'm actually dying.

4845
05:22:27,140 --> 05:22:32,140
Like, I enjoyed when everything was new, but is that...

4846
05:22:32,140 --> 05:22:39,140
I think there's three back-to-back maps that we've played, and we've just gone and repeated them.

4847
05:22:39,140 --> 05:22:41,140
And I don't mean to be nasty, I'm so...

4848
05:22:41,140 --> 05:22:47,140
Like, I do enjoy Halo, don't get me wrong, enjoy the concept, it's very nostalgic because my dad used to play this.

4849
05:22:47,140 --> 05:22:51,140
And, you know, poggers and all that, but...

4850
05:22:52,140 --> 05:22:55,140
I'm getting a bit...

4851
05:22:57,140 --> 05:23:00,140
I assume this is the way to go considering they're like, unending.

4852
05:23:07,140 --> 05:23:10,140
You're doing good, okay, I hope so, I hope it's not bad.

4853
05:23:12,140 --> 05:23:14,140
Wait, was that a health pack or something?

4854
05:23:14,140 --> 05:23:15,140
Yeah, it is.

4855
05:23:15,140 --> 05:23:16,140
How did I miss that?

4856
05:23:18,140 --> 05:23:20,140
Is this an infinite spawn or something?

4857
05:23:22,140 --> 05:23:24,140
They don't seem to be ending.

4858
05:23:27,140 --> 05:23:30,140
Am I accidentally found an infinite spawn?

4859
05:23:33,140 --> 05:23:34,140
I have.

4860
05:23:34,140 --> 05:23:36,140
Okay, well, that explains it.

4861
05:23:38,140 --> 05:23:41,140
Lucky me that that's what I freaking discovered.

4862
05:23:41,140 --> 05:23:42,140
Okay, I have none of that.

4863
05:23:42,140 --> 05:23:44,140
Can we please close this fucking door?

4864
05:23:44,140 --> 05:23:45,140
Checkpoint done, apparently?

4865
05:23:45,140 --> 05:23:47,140
I didn't do anything.

4866
05:23:48,140 --> 05:23:50,140
I'm glad you think I've done something, but I haven't.

4867
05:23:55,140 --> 05:23:56,140
I don't...

4868
05:23:58,140 --> 05:24:00,140
Oh, I can't get over by that.

4869
05:24:02,140 --> 05:24:04,140
Who are they shooting at?

4870
05:24:06,140 --> 05:24:07,140
This is like...

4871
05:24:09,140 --> 05:24:13,140
Wait, all I'm saying is that when I go to bed tonight, I'm watching...

4872
05:24:13,140 --> 05:24:17,140
Combat Evolved Legendary, because what the eff is this?

4873
05:24:19,140 --> 05:24:20,140
And I'm so...

4874
05:24:20,140 --> 05:24:22,140
I don't know where to go.

4875
05:24:23,140 --> 05:24:25,140
That was the way forward.

4876
05:24:25,140 --> 05:24:26,140
Am I going backward?

4877
05:24:26,140 --> 05:24:28,140
I'm supposed to go in here.

4878
05:24:28,140 --> 05:24:30,140
Sorry, I'm so sorry, darlings.

4879
05:24:32,140 --> 05:24:34,140
Forgive me, forgive me.

4880
05:24:34,140 --> 05:24:36,140
I just don't know where to go.

4881
05:24:36,140 --> 05:24:37,140
Hold on.

4882
05:24:38,140 --> 05:24:39,140
Wait, that was the way forward.

4883
05:24:39,140 --> 05:24:41,140
What was the way forward there?

4884
05:24:43,140 --> 05:24:48,140
You haven't earned your stripes from this one.

4885
05:24:52,140 --> 05:24:58,140
Wait, back here where everything was locked off, it opened a door when it said checkpoint reached.

4886
05:25:00,140 --> 05:25:01,140
Oh my...

4887
05:25:01,140 --> 05:25:02,140
Wait, did it?

4888
05:25:02,140 --> 05:25:03,140
No.

4889
05:25:03,140 --> 05:25:05,140
I'm so sorry.

4890
05:25:10,140 --> 05:25:12,140
Ah, sorry.

4891
05:25:13,140 --> 05:25:18,140
I can hear them.

4892
05:25:18,140 --> 05:25:23,140
At least if you're going to attack me, at least give me a...

4893
05:25:25,140 --> 05:25:28,140
Oh, I'm going to lose.

4894
05:25:32,140 --> 05:25:35,140
I'm trying, and I'm going to dead.

4895
05:25:38,140 --> 05:25:41,140
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4896
05:25:44,140 --> 05:25:46,140
I have tons of needs for a reason.

4897
05:25:46,140 --> 05:25:48,140
Did he just...

4898
05:25:49,140 --> 05:25:51,140
Wait, where did you come from?

4899
05:25:51,140 --> 05:25:55,140
That thing just spawned, and she...

4900
05:25:58,140 --> 05:26:01,140
See, if I spawned behind, it's perfectly fine, but...

4901
05:26:01,140 --> 05:26:04,140
Because it's not me, is this where I came from?

4902
05:26:07,140 --> 05:26:09,140
No, I just saw my 360.

4903
05:26:09,140 --> 05:26:10,140
I just felt like...

4904
05:26:10,140 --> 05:26:12,140
I just felt like sailing on them, sorry.

4905
05:26:13,140 --> 05:26:16,140
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, that's where they respawn over there, right?

4906
05:26:16,140 --> 05:26:19,140
Where am I coming? Where am I going?

4907
05:26:20,140 --> 05:26:23,140
Where did you come from? Where did you come from?

4908
05:26:31,140 --> 05:26:33,140
Engine room open, we're here.

4909
05:26:36,140 --> 05:26:39,140
Alert, the monitor has disabled all command access.

4910
05:26:39,140 --> 05:26:41,140
We can't restart the countdown.

4911
05:26:41,140 --> 05:26:45,140
The only remaining option is to detonate the ship's fusion reactors.

4912
05:26:45,140 --> 05:26:48,140
That should do enough damage to destroy Halo.

4913
05:26:48,140 --> 05:26:52,140
Don't worry, I have access to all of the reactor schematics and procedures.

4914
05:26:52,140 --> 05:26:54,140
I'll walk you through it.

4915
05:26:54,140 --> 05:26:56,140
First, we need to pull back the exhaust covers.

4916
05:26:56,140 --> 05:27:01,140
That will expose a shaft that leads to the primary fusion drive core.

4917
05:27:02,140 --> 05:27:04,140
Expose a shaft?

4918
05:27:04,140 --> 05:27:06,140
I do that on the daily, ma'am.

4919
05:27:12,140 --> 05:27:13,140
Right.

4920
05:27:18,140 --> 05:27:19,140
Right.

4921
05:27:27,140 --> 05:27:29,140
Y'all gonna need to stop.

4922
05:27:31,140 --> 05:27:33,140
Or you're gonna make me drop.

4923
05:27:37,140 --> 05:27:39,140
Wait, well, where?

4924
05:27:42,140 --> 05:27:44,140
Where? Stop.

4925
05:27:57,140 --> 05:27:59,140
It's telling me.

4926
05:28:00,140 --> 05:28:01,140
Sorry.

4927
05:28:03,140 --> 05:28:05,140
I'm not supposed to be here.

4928
05:28:06,140 --> 05:28:09,140
No, I'm not supposed to be here. Sorry.

4929
05:28:12,140 --> 05:28:14,140
Where am I?

4930
05:28:14,140 --> 05:28:16,140
I can hear him. We'll...

4931
05:28:18,140 --> 05:28:20,140
I don't know. It says...

4932
05:28:20,140 --> 05:28:23,140
You will destroy this installation as well as this fascinating record.

4933
05:28:23,140 --> 05:28:25,140
Yes.

4934
05:28:34,140 --> 05:28:36,140
Fusion reactor number one destabilizing.

4935
05:28:36,140 --> 05:28:39,140
Use explosives on the other three reactors.

4936
05:28:39,140 --> 05:28:43,140
That should be enough to trigger a Wildcat explosion of the engines.

4937
05:28:50,140 --> 05:28:52,140
I'm waiting for her to tell me.

4938
05:28:52,140 --> 05:28:53,140
Wait.

4939
05:28:55,140 --> 05:28:57,140
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4940
05:28:57,140 --> 05:29:00,140
I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

4941
05:29:02,140 --> 05:29:04,140
Okay, we're almost done. We're almost done.

4942
05:29:04,140 --> 05:29:06,140
We're almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

4943
05:29:07,140 --> 05:29:08,140
Almost there.

4944
05:29:10,140 --> 05:29:11,140
Oh.

4945
05:29:12,140 --> 05:29:15,140
So, we're to just go around in circles. Got it.

4946
05:29:24,140 --> 05:29:25,140
Hello.

4947
05:29:27,140 --> 05:29:29,140
What do you want?

4948
05:29:29,140 --> 05:29:31,140
I still need.

4949
05:29:32,140 --> 05:29:34,140
It wasn't deep enough?

4950
05:29:34,140 --> 05:29:36,140
I guess not.

4951
05:29:36,140 --> 05:29:38,140
I guess it wasn't deep enough.

4952
05:29:38,140 --> 05:29:41,140
Wait till they open. You can do it.

4953
05:29:41,140 --> 05:29:45,140
Basically, you have to get to this thing with the hole and throw a heat in it.

4954
05:29:46,140 --> 05:29:48,140
Honestly.

4955
05:29:51,140 --> 05:29:54,140
Okay, how do I do the third one?

4956
05:29:56,140 --> 05:29:59,140
Ow. Got burnt a little bit and I'll go on. That kind of hurt.

4957
05:30:09,140 --> 05:30:11,140
So, run for the monster to me.

4958
05:30:11,140 --> 05:30:13,140
Or I'll be forced to take you up my head.

4959
05:30:14,140 --> 05:30:15,140
No.

4960
05:30:16,140 --> 05:30:18,140
I need to do it any more or am I done?

4961
05:30:18,140 --> 05:30:21,140
Keep it up. Only one more fusion reactor to go.

4962
05:30:25,140 --> 05:30:28,140
Okay, and then surely that's it, right? Surely.

4963
05:30:29,140 --> 05:30:32,140
I'm not going to be asked to do anything else from this game.

4964
05:30:38,140 --> 05:30:40,140
It's quite a miracle.

4965
05:30:44,140 --> 05:30:46,140
Surely, I'm not going to be asked anything else.

4966
05:30:47,140 --> 05:30:49,140
Not a singular thing else.

4967
05:30:52,140 --> 05:30:53,140
Uh-huh.

4968
05:30:54,140 --> 05:30:55,140
No war.

4969
05:30:59,140 --> 05:31:00,140
Mm-hmm.

4970
05:31:09,140 --> 05:31:11,140
There's a service lift at the top of the engine room.

4971
05:31:11,140 --> 05:31:15,140
It leads to a class 7 service corridor that runs along the ship's dorsal structure.

4972
05:31:15,140 --> 05:31:16,140
Hurry!

4973
05:31:17,140 --> 05:31:19,140
Where am I to go?

4974
05:31:19,140 --> 05:31:21,140
That way?

4975
05:31:23,140 --> 05:31:25,140
Gimli? Is that you?

4976
05:31:27,140 --> 05:31:29,140
Did my cat just meow?

4977
05:31:30,140 --> 05:31:32,140
Where am I to go?

4978
05:31:33,140 --> 05:31:35,140
Is this to go up?

4979
05:31:36,140 --> 05:31:39,140
I don't know where I'm to go.

4980
05:31:43,140 --> 05:31:46,140
Gimli, are you in this room? No, I'm not.

4981
05:31:53,140 --> 05:31:55,140
You just got to stay on top of the thing.

4982
05:31:55,140 --> 05:31:56,140
Oh.

4983
05:31:57,140 --> 05:32:01,140
So, I'm going the complete wrong way. We're right at the third second.

4984
05:32:02,140 --> 05:32:05,140
15 minutes is plenty of time to make it.

4985
05:32:05,140 --> 05:32:09,140
Yes, but it's me that's playing, which is a problem, refund.

4986
05:32:10,140 --> 05:32:14,140
For an average gamer, absolutely. For me?

4987
05:32:15,140 --> 05:32:18,140
Right, I need to go up 4-3 for it.

4988
05:32:22,140 --> 05:32:25,140
Fly-full. Send it a little like a meow, but could it be me?

4989
05:32:26,140 --> 05:32:28,140
I heard a big meow.

4990
05:32:28,140 --> 05:32:30,140
I thought it might be Gimli.

4991
05:32:36,140 --> 05:32:40,140
Oh, is this how it did end? We went up earlier? I think it is as well.

4992
05:32:43,140 --> 05:32:45,140
Look behind me.

4993
05:32:46,140 --> 05:32:48,140
What's this? A lift?

4994
05:32:49,140 --> 05:32:51,140
I don't see her.

4995
05:32:58,140 --> 05:32:59,140
Okay.

4996
05:33:01,140 --> 05:33:03,140
I'm sure we'll get there in 2 minutes.

4997
05:33:04,140 --> 05:33:06,140
Woah, this is rough.

4998
05:33:06,140 --> 05:33:08,140
I have been hearing me out. That's weird.

4999
05:33:08,140 --> 05:33:12,140
Catcams? Okay. I'm doing a pulp in the chicken stream.

5000
05:33:12,140 --> 05:33:14,140
And I'm really...

5001
05:33:15,140 --> 05:33:17,140
Gimli and Bebo can't come on.

5002
05:33:19,140 --> 05:33:23,140
And the Lord that Elite has been chasing you since the game started to tell you.

5003
05:33:24,140 --> 05:33:26,140
We need stuff. Put it to bags.

5004
05:33:28,140 --> 05:33:30,140
Put it to bags. Put it to bags.

5005
05:33:32,140 --> 05:33:34,140
He's an assassin.

5006
05:33:35,140 --> 05:33:37,140
Timer, do it!

5007
05:33:49,140 --> 05:33:51,140
I can't handle it.

5008
05:33:59,140 --> 05:34:01,140
Can I not get in a warhold?

5009
05:34:04,140 --> 05:34:06,140
We can't make it on foot. We need a vehicle.

5010
05:34:10,140 --> 05:34:12,140
Okay, well, I'll try it.

5011
05:34:14,140 --> 05:34:16,140
Oh my god, there's an actual timer.

5012
05:34:16,140 --> 05:34:19,140
I think I'm going to be doing this segment again.

5013
05:34:21,140 --> 05:34:23,140
Get in the warhold. Okay, let's go.

5014
05:34:28,140 --> 05:34:30,140
Um...

5015
05:34:37,140 --> 05:34:40,140
Why would the last mission require driving?

5016
05:34:40,140 --> 05:34:42,140
Are they serious?

5017
05:34:44,140 --> 05:34:47,140
They really just said we hate our female chicken fan base.

5018
05:34:47,140 --> 05:34:49,140
What the fuck?

5019
05:34:51,140 --> 05:34:54,140
I don't know if it's better to go down and up

5020
05:34:54,140 --> 05:34:57,140
or if it's to stay on this weird winding path.

5021
05:34:59,140 --> 05:35:01,140
I don't know.

5022
05:35:02,140 --> 05:35:05,140
I mean, we've cleared 1.5.

5023
05:35:08,140 --> 05:35:10,140
Avoid dying?

5024
05:35:12,140 --> 05:35:16,140
I'd already be dead if that was legendary, because what was that?

5025
05:35:19,140 --> 05:35:22,140
I don't even know how to take this much damage.

5026
05:35:24,140 --> 05:35:27,140
Uh, hold on. I need to pick it up again.

5027
05:35:29,140 --> 05:35:31,140
Okay.

5028
05:35:34,140 --> 05:35:37,140
The driver's seat, Master Chief.

5029
05:35:37,140 --> 05:35:39,140
The driver's seat.

5030
05:35:41,140 --> 05:35:43,140
My stomach isn't strong enough for this.

5031
05:35:43,140 --> 05:35:45,140
Close your eyes, darling. Close your eyes.

5032
05:35:45,140 --> 05:35:47,140
It's not looking good.

5033
05:35:49,140 --> 05:35:51,140
Are these put there on purpose?

5034
05:35:51,140 --> 05:35:53,140
I swear.

5035
05:35:53,140 --> 05:35:56,140
If they're put there on purpose for that reason alone,

5036
05:35:56,140 --> 05:35:59,140
literally what even is that?

5037
05:36:04,140 --> 05:36:06,140
I...

5038
05:36:07,140 --> 05:36:10,140
You've got to avoid them. Why would they even put those in?

5039
05:36:10,140 --> 05:36:12,140
That's so malicious and evil.

5040
05:36:12,140 --> 05:36:16,140
I'm gonna have to replay this entire section again.

5041
05:36:18,140 --> 05:36:20,140
Like, what is this map?

5042
05:36:20,140 --> 05:36:22,140
Leo!

5043
05:36:23,140 --> 05:36:27,140
Plain fucking dodge arms in a corridor?

5044
05:36:32,140 --> 05:36:37,140
I don't even know what the most efficient way of getting through these locations would be.

5045
05:36:40,140 --> 05:36:42,140
Because you can't even send it in the middle.

5046
05:36:42,140 --> 05:36:45,140
They've got all these weird things in the way.

5047
05:36:47,140 --> 05:36:50,140
Yeah, and if you miss, you lose all your momentum.

5048
05:36:52,140 --> 05:36:55,140
Is that what it's supposed to be? You're rewarded for doing it perfectly,

5049
05:36:55,140 --> 05:36:58,140
but if you miss your momentum, it's over?

5050
05:36:59,140 --> 05:37:02,140
What the fuck? Thanks, man!

5051
05:37:10,140 --> 05:37:13,140
I think I can get past without dying, right?

5052
05:37:13,140 --> 05:37:15,140
Okay.

5053
05:37:18,140 --> 05:37:21,140
100 meters away, at least.

5054
05:37:21,140 --> 05:37:23,140
A Christmas miracle.

5055
05:37:28,140 --> 05:37:30,140
Nope.

5056
05:37:39,140 --> 05:37:42,140
Yeah, no, I'm sorry, but why is it open?

5057
05:37:45,140 --> 05:37:49,140
Wait, I still only have two minutes you didn't add to my timer?

5058
05:37:52,140 --> 05:37:55,140
It didn't add to my timer?

5059
05:37:58,140 --> 05:38:01,140
Have I lost this burial?

5060
05:38:05,140 --> 05:38:07,140
Have I lost?

5061
05:38:21,140 --> 05:38:23,140
Huh?

5062
05:38:27,140 --> 05:38:30,140
I don't know if I'm winning or not!

5063
05:38:32,140 --> 05:38:34,140
I don't know if I'm winning.

5064
05:38:39,140 --> 05:38:42,140
This is getting a bit too close for Malaykin.

5065
05:38:47,140 --> 05:38:49,140
I guess.

5066
05:38:52,140 --> 05:38:56,140
Am I supposed to fucking manually walk the rest of it? I guess!

5067
05:39:01,140 --> 05:39:05,140
Oh my god. Get me on this fucking thing.

5068
05:39:07,140 --> 05:39:10,140
Please, don't kill me now.

5069
05:39:10,140 --> 05:39:14,140
Oh my god, we did it. I don't have to do that again.

5070
05:39:22,140 --> 05:39:24,140
Oh.

5071
05:39:26,140 --> 05:39:29,140
That was awful. Don't ever let me do that again.

5072
05:39:34,140 --> 05:39:36,140
Oh my god.

5073
05:39:38,140 --> 05:39:45,140
First try, I'll actually, in zero deaths, run, zero allies, hit, run.

5074
05:39:47,140 --> 05:39:50,140
Something tells me the flood isn't over.

5075
05:39:51,140 --> 05:39:53,140
Oh.

5076
05:40:02,140 --> 05:40:04,140
We're in space.

5077
05:40:07,140 --> 05:40:10,140
Cortana. Oh, we blew it up.

5078
05:40:10,140 --> 05:40:14,140
Oh, we blew up the whip? Oh, we blew it up. Yeah, okay, I get it.

5079
05:40:22,140 --> 05:40:24,140
Oh.

5080
05:40:26,140 --> 05:40:29,140
Fancy a look? It's not really.

5081
05:40:32,140 --> 05:40:35,140
Only 17 deaths and seven allies. No.

5082
05:40:35,140 --> 05:40:38,140
Thank you, Justice John, for becoming a member.

5083
05:40:40,140 --> 05:40:42,140
You enjoyed that move?

5084
05:40:47,140 --> 05:40:50,140
So we broke the weapon.

5085
05:40:52,140 --> 05:40:54,140
No.

5086
05:41:10,140 --> 05:41:13,140
Yes, one tells me the flood comes back.

5087
05:41:17,140 --> 05:41:20,140
Oh, he's taking his helmet off.

5088
05:41:22,140 --> 05:41:26,140
Did you know when he takes his helmet off, it just stays on?

5089
05:41:28,140 --> 05:41:31,140
Okay, Sergeant Johnson made it.

5090
05:41:31,140 --> 05:41:35,140
He was the part of the alien. How did he make it?

5091
05:41:38,140 --> 05:41:41,140
No hologram girlfriend to justify my war crimes?

5092
05:41:41,140 --> 05:41:44,140
Real? What's under the helmet?

5093
05:41:44,140 --> 05:41:48,140
Another cliffhanger? There's a second game?

5094
05:41:49,140 --> 05:41:51,140
Isn't there like five healers now?

5095
05:41:51,140 --> 05:41:54,140
Nah, he lives because he was spotted on there.

5096
05:41:55,140 --> 05:41:58,140
Oh, reluctantly saying thank you for the 10 gifts, memberships.

5097
05:41:58,140 --> 05:42:02,140
I'm sorry for being such a fucking miserable coward at the end of that.

5098
05:42:02,140 --> 05:42:04,140
Bro, wrap it up.

5099
05:42:04,140 --> 05:42:08,140
Oh my God, I was, that was like,

5100
05:42:09,140 --> 05:42:12,140
I'm not gonna lie, by like the third fetch quest

5101
05:42:12,140 --> 05:42:15,140
on the same map that I've already been on before.

5102
05:42:15,140 --> 05:42:19,140
Sorry, I'm taking off my heart rate monitor because I don't need it anymore.

5103
05:42:19,140 --> 05:42:22,140
It might make a beep though, just to warn you, hear a beep.

5104
05:42:22,140 --> 05:42:25,140
It's okay, we still enjoyed it, powering through, bro.

5105
05:42:26,140 --> 05:42:27,140
Oh, there it goes.

5106
05:42:27,140 --> 05:42:31,140
Am I going mental and saying like a fucking wrap up?

5107
05:42:31,140 --> 05:42:33,140
Thank you, reluctantly saying thanks.

5108
05:42:33,140 --> 05:42:37,140
For those who you caught it with your face, enjoy the email.

5109
05:42:37,140 --> 05:42:39,140
You know, it supports the channel.

5110
05:42:39,140 --> 05:42:42,140
Oh wow, that broke my motto for some reason, taking it off.

5111
05:42:43,140 --> 05:42:46,140
It's fair, that was a lot, don't worry about it.

5112
05:42:46,140 --> 05:42:51,140
I can't believe it, I'm heavily criticizing a game that was developed in 2001.

5113
05:42:51,140 --> 05:42:53,140
What a terrible person I am.

5114
05:42:58,140 --> 05:43:01,140
No way, you gave me a tip for every death.

5115
05:43:01,140 --> 05:43:03,140
I did it 16 times.

5116
05:43:03,140 --> 05:43:08,140
Thank you for the tip death, John Omne.

5117
05:43:08,140 --> 05:43:10,140
I appreciate you.

5118
05:43:10,140 --> 05:43:12,140
They didn't pretty much set the standard for fast shooters though.

5119
05:43:12,140 --> 05:43:14,140
Halo 2 is the best game.

5120
05:43:14,140 --> 05:43:16,140
Is Halo 2 better, right?

5121
05:43:16,140 --> 05:43:18,140
Maybe we'll play Halo 2 then.

5122
05:43:18,140 --> 05:43:21,140
Is there going to be scary things in Halo 2?

5123
05:43:21,140 --> 05:43:23,140
Is the flood coming back, to be honest?

5124
05:43:24,140 --> 05:43:26,140
Does the flood come back?

5125
05:43:26,140 --> 05:43:29,140
Oh my god, why is my YouTube studio all messed up?

5126
05:43:31,140 --> 05:43:34,140
My shells are getting cold, but they aren't cold.

5127
05:43:36,140 --> 05:43:37,140
Where am I?

5128
05:43:38,140 --> 05:43:39,140
Scary like FNAF?

5129
05:43:39,140 --> 05:43:41,140
No, flood won't be like that, no?

5130
05:43:41,140 --> 05:43:42,140
Maybe?

5131
05:43:43,140 --> 05:43:45,140
It was just the reveal of them.

5132
05:43:47,140 --> 05:43:49,140
And it was the worst part.

5133
05:43:55,140 --> 05:43:57,140
Oh my god, my boots were cut off.

5134
05:43:57,140 --> 05:43:59,140
You didn't say anything?

5135
05:43:59,140 --> 05:44:03,140
Anyway, thank you so much for playing Halo with me.

5136
05:44:03,140 --> 05:44:04,140
I had so much fun.

5137
05:44:04,140 --> 05:44:06,140
I don't know about you, but I really...

5138
05:44:06,140 --> 05:44:08,140
Could you imagine?

5139
05:44:13,140 --> 05:44:14,140
That's it.

5140
05:44:14,140 --> 05:44:15,140
Halo 2 is mental.

5141
05:44:15,140 --> 05:44:16,140
Is it like as long as that?

5142
05:44:16,140 --> 05:44:18,140
Or is it like better?

5143
05:44:18,140 --> 05:44:20,140
They had a limited budget on Halo 1.

5144
05:44:22,140 --> 05:44:24,140
As much as I'm complaining, I do have to admit,

5145
05:44:24,140 --> 05:44:27,140
considering the resources they most likely had,

5146
05:44:29,140 --> 05:44:31,140
what they could do, the budget,

5147
05:44:31,140 --> 05:44:34,140
what their console could do as well,

5148
05:44:34,140 --> 05:44:39,140
obviously would pay into the factors a lot.

5149
05:44:39,140 --> 05:44:42,140
There is no mention of the flood in any material,

5150
05:44:42,140 --> 05:44:44,140
even for the Covenant Guide to beat them,

5151
05:44:44,140 --> 05:44:46,140
there was nothing for the flood.

5152
05:44:49,140 --> 05:44:52,140
Why have all times that I decided to look up at that moment?

5153
05:44:52,140 --> 05:44:55,140
I don't know, maybe you knew I was up to some mischievous,

5154
05:44:56,140 --> 05:44:58,140
devious app.

5155
05:45:00,140 --> 05:45:01,140
There's a secret.

5156
05:45:01,140 --> 05:45:04,140
The development of Halo 3 was an absolute mess and rush

5157
05:45:04,140 --> 05:45:06,140
after its development team, then.

5158
05:45:06,140 --> 05:45:09,140
The game was a long time in development though.

5159
05:45:11,140 --> 05:45:14,140
I wondered, there was that scene where he yanked the thing from me,

5160
05:45:14,140 --> 05:45:15,140
and I was like,

5161
05:45:15,140 --> 05:45:17,140
was there supposed to be something in between that?

5162
05:45:17,140 --> 05:45:18,140
But then I was like, no.

5163
05:45:18,140 --> 05:45:19,140
But...

5164
05:45:21,140 --> 05:45:23,140
The development of Halo 2 was worse?

5165
05:45:23,140 --> 05:45:27,140
I thought 3, 4, 3 became Bungie or something like that.

5166
05:45:27,140 --> 05:45:29,140
I thought they got actually...

5167
05:45:30,140 --> 05:45:32,140
You should really check out the Halo marketing and trailers

5168
05:45:32,140 --> 05:45:34,140
that release this stuff.

5169
05:45:34,140 --> 05:45:37,140
I'm going to watch someone play Legendary tonight.

5170
05:45:37,140 --> 05:45:38,140
Legendary difficulty,

5171
05:45:38,140 --> 05:45:41,140
because how on Earth is anyone playing that Legendary?

5172
05:45:41,140 --> 05:45:42,140
I have no idea.

5173
05:45:42,140 --> 05:45:46,140
No, 3, 4, 3 got Halo from Bungie.

5174
05:45:46,140 --> 05:45:48,140
Oh, fun, right.

5175
05:45:50,140 --> 05:45:51,140
Right, okay.

5176
05:45:51,140 --> 05:45:52,140
Doom when?

5177
05:45:52,140 --> 05:45:53,140
You want me to play Doom?

5178
05:45:53,140 --> 05:45:55,140
Am I going to get annoyed at Doom though?

5179
05:45:55,140 --> 05:45:56,140
That's my concern.

5180
05:45:56,140 --> 05:45:57,140
If I'm going to get annoyed,

5181
05:45:57,140 --> 05:46:00,140
if I'm like, wrap it up, right, wrap it up.

5182
05:46:01,140 --> 05:46:02,140
That's when I get concerned,

5183
05:46:02,140 --> 05:46:03,140
because I'm like, no,

5184
05:46:03,140 --> 05:46:06,140
because I know I've turned into such a wee moody cow in that,

5185
05:46:06,140 --> 05:46:08,140
when I'm like, ah, wrap it up.

5186
05:46:09,140 --> 05:46:10,140
Perhaps.

5187
05:46:10,140 --> 05:46:12,140
Halo 2 Market was the scene.

5188
05:46:12,140 --> 05:46:14,140
7-Eleven slurping up.

5189
05:46:14,140 --> 05:46:15,140
Oh!

5190
05:46:16,140 --> 05:46:19,140
3, 4, 3 was created by Microsoft to keep Halo going,

5191
05:46:19,140 --> 05:46:20,140
but they...

5192
05:46:22,140 --> 05:46:25,140
But will she get annoyed at Doom?

5193
05:46:25,140 --> 05:46:28,140
Or Old School Doom or Doom 2016?

5194
05:46:28,140 --> 05:46:29,140
I don't know.

5195
05:46:29,140 --> 05:46:31,140
I take your guys' recommendation.

5196
05:46:31,140 --> 05:46:32,140
This is your choice, not mine.

5197
05:46:32,140 --> 05:46:34,140
If you're asking me to play Doom, I'll play Doom,

5198
05:46:34,140 --> 05:46:36,140
but you've been whined.

5199
05:46:38,140 --> 05:46:39,140
If you want to fight Capitals,

5200
05:46:39,140 --> 05:46:40,140
then BioShock might be mine.

5201
05:46:40,140 --> 05:46:43,140
BioShock 2 is on the roster this month at Layergate.

5202
05:46:45,140 --> 05:46:47,140
I will open up my little chandelier.

5203
05:46:47,140 --> 05:46:48,140
Boom.

5204
05:46:48,140 --> 05:46:49,140
Nope.

5205
05:46:49,140 --> 05:46:50,140
That's a meme.

5206
05:46:50,140 --> 05:46:51,140
That's not a schedule.

5207
05:46:52,140 --> 05:46:53,140
Hold on.

5208
05:46:55,140 --> 05:46:56,140
This is a schedule.

5209
05:46:58,140 --> 05:46:59,140
This is annoying.

5210
05:47:00,140 --> 05:47:01,140
Oh, no, that's me.

5211
05:47:06,140 --> 05:47:07,140
Okay.

5212
05:47:07,140 --> 05:47:08,140
We will do this.

5213
05:47:10,140 --> 05:47:13,140
So this week is focused on being a little bit smaller

5214
05:47:13,140 --> 05:47:15,140
whilst I deal with some background stuff.

5215
05:47:15,140 --> 05:47:18,140
We should have the clipper program launched though.

5216
05:47:19,140 --> 05:47:22,140
As for the longest day, I guess it's Friday

5217
05:47:22,140 --> 05:47:24,140
because it's four hours of RuneScape offline

5218
05:47:24,140 --> 05:47:26,140
and then two hours with Arisa.

5219
05:47:28,140 --> 05:47:31,140
But this week is going to be a little bit shorter

5220
05:47:31,140 --> 05:47:35,140
just because I'm trying to launch that program,

5221
05:47:35,140 --> 05:47:37,140
but you know, you need to sit down

5222
05:47:37,140 --> 05:47:38,140
and you need to get the website out.

5223
05:47:38,140 --> 05:47:40,140
You need to lay everything out

5224
05:47:40,140 --> 05:47:44,140
and make it super-duper easy for everyone involved.

5225
05:47:44,140 --> 05:47:48,140
So that's the shenanigans we plan on getting up to.

5226
05:47:49,140 --> 05:47:52,140
Doom Eternal took all of Doom 2016

5227
05:47:52,140 --> 05:47:53,140
and made it in Zoomer.

5228
05:47:53,140 --> 05:47:54,140
Hell!

5229
05:47:54,140 --> 05:47:56,140
Wait, does that mean I'm going to like it though?

5230
05:47:58,140 --> 05:48:01,140
Yes, we are going to launch an established clipper program

5231
05:48:01,140 --> 05:48:03,140
where we pay you

5232
05:48:03,140 --> 05:48:05,140
if you have an established clipping channel.

5233
05:48:05,140 --> 05:48:07,140
What's the money to put the girls?

5234
05:48:08,140 --> 05:48:09,140
Basically.

5235
05:48:09,140 --> 05:48:11,140
But I need to write down all the...

5236
05:48:12,140 --> 05:48:15,140
The website update, the thing...

5237
05:48:15,140 --> 05:48:19,140
Doom 1993 is one of my favourite games of all time.

5238
05:48:19,140 --> 05:48:21,140
Do we pixel one?

5239
05:48:25,140 --> 05:48:27,140
Vermintide 2, yes.

5240
05:48:27,140 --> 05:48:29,140
I'm going to get a throwaway Steam account.

5241
05:48:31,140 --> 05:48:33,140
I've been enjoying lurking here as I wake up.

5242
05:48:33,140 --> 05:48:35,140
Oh, am I a good time zone for you?

5243
05:48:36,140 --> 05:48:41,140
Play Oddworld Apes Odyssey.

5244
05:48:41,140 --> 05:48:43,140
I think there was a remake for it too.

5245
05:48:43,140 --> 05:48:45,140
It's difficult, but you're going to love the opening scene.

5246
05:48:45,140 --> 05:48:47,140
Play the game for the opening scene.

5247
05:48:47,140 --> 05:48:50,140
Turns into like a rage and mess by the end of it.

5248
05:48:50,140 --> 05:48:53,140
Apparently Turn It Boy commits to Activation.

5249
05:48:53,140 --> 05:48:56,140
I keep hearing it in the whispers for VTubers

5250
05:48:56,140 --> 05:48:57,140
and I'm like, is it a VTuber game?

5251
05:48:57,140 --> 05:48:59,140
I don't know, let's find out.

5252
05:49:01,140 --> 05:49:04,140
Right, is there any of my girls that are online

5253
05:49:04,140 --> 05:49:07,140
so I can redirect them to their cheeky bum?

5254
05:49:14,140 --> 05:49:17,140
I also want to do some of that 8 more,

5255
05:49:17,140 --> 05:49:21,140
so I will put the rooms up publicly.

5256
05:49:21,140 --> 05:49:23,140
I think I do have some meow.

5257
05:49:25,140 --> 05:49:26,140
Let me see.

5258
05:49:30,140 --> 05:49:31,140
Do I have a thumbnail?

5259
05:49:34,140 --> 05:49:35,140
What thumbnail do you want?

5260
05:49:35,140 --> 05:49:36,140
Okay, you know what?

5261
05:49:36,140 --> 05:49:38,140
This is the best thumbnail for next week.

5262
05:49:38,140 --> 05:49:39,140
I'm going to show you.

5263
05:49:39,140 --> 05:49:41,140
Oh my god, spoilers.

5264
05:49:41,140 --> 05:49:43,140
This is the best thumbnail for next week,

5265
05:49:43,140 --> 05:49:44,140
because it's adorable.

5266
05:49:44,140 --> 05:49:45,140
Are you ready for it?

5267
05:49:47,140 --> 05:49:48,140
Boom.

5268
05:49:51,140 --> 05:49:53,140
Escape Simulator with Icy.

5269
05:49:53,140 --> 05:49:56,140
And look, she has a monocle

5270
05:49:56,140 --> 05:49:59,140
and like a Fedoro hat,

5271
05:49:59,140 --> 05:50:00,140
or what are they called?

5272
05:50:00,140 --> 05:50:01,140
A Fedoro?

5273
05:50:01,140 --> 05:50:03,140
I forgot the name, a Fedoro.

5274
05:50:03,140 --> 05:50:06,140
And then I got a little paper and a little magnifying glass.

5275
05:50:06,140 --> 05:50:10,140
Yeah, VTuber assets are kinda hitting the gritty.

5276
05:50:10,140 --> 05:50:11,140
They're really good.

5277
05:50:11,140 --> 05:50:14,140
But yeah, I think that's the best thumbnail of this.

5278
05:50:14,140 --> 05:50:17,140
Or maybe, maybe this one, hold on.

5279
05:50:17,140 --> 05:50:19,140
Oh my god, I'm just leaking all the thumbnails

5280
05:50:19,140 --> 05:50:21,140
before I put them out.

5281
05:50:27,140 --> 05:50:28,140
Are you ready?

5282
05:50:28,140 --> 05:50:29,140
Are you steady?

5283
05:50:30,140 --> 05:50:32,140
I'll show you this.

5284
05:50:32,140 --> 05:50:33,140
Boom.

5285
05:50:35,140 --> 05:50:36,140
Me?

5286
05:50:36,140 --> 05:50:38,140
Why am I wanted for tax evasion?

5287
05:50:38,140 --> 05:50:40,140
I get taxed extra,

5288
05:50:40,140 --> 05:50:42,140
because I'm a foreigner in this country.

5289
05:50:42,140 --> 05:50:43,140
Yay.

5290
05:50:43,140 --> 05:50:46,140
I love paying a tax based on the fact that I didn't spawn here.

5291
05:50:46,140 --> 05:50:47,140
Yippee.

5292
05:50:49,140 --> 05:50:50,140
I think you just love it.

5293
05:50:51,140 --> 05:50:52,140
Shotting behavior.

5294
05:50:53,140 --> 05:50:55,140
Right, let's see if any of my girls are on.

5295
05:50:55,140 --> 05:50:56,140
Emmy's on.

5296
05:50:56,140 --> 05:50:57,140
Oh my god, we can redirect into Emmy.

5297
05:50:57,140 --> 05:50:59,140
Oh, she did a Bob Ross stream.

5298
05:50:59,140 --> 05:51:01,140
That's fantastic.

5299
05:51:01,140 --> 05:51:03,140
Oh my god, where is her hair?

5300
05:51:07,140 --> 05:51:09,140
Where is her hair?

5301
05:51:09,140 --> 05:51:11,140
Her hair is gone.

5302
05:51:11,140 --> 05:51:13,140
Oh my god.

5303
05:51:13,140 --> 05:51:14,140
She took her fucking hair off.

5304
05:51:14,140 --> 05:51:16,140
Are you just making me right now?

5305
05:51:16,140 --> 05:51:18,140
Oh my god, that's hilarious.

5306
05:51:19,140 --> 05:51:21,140
That's funny to look.

5307
05:51:21,140 --> 05:51:22,140
She's Bob Ross.

5308
05:51:22,140 --> 05:51:24,140
Anonymous, thank you for the 25.

5309
05:51:24,140 --> 05:51:25,140
You didn't say anything.

5310
05:51:25,140 --> 05:51:27,140
No, and don't tip saying something

5311
05:51:27,140 --> 05:51:29,140
or nothing in the message or whatever.

5312
05:51:29,140 --> 05:51:31,140
Thank you for the 25.

5313
05:51:31,140 --> 05:51:33,140
Anonymous, that's very kind of you.

5314
05:51:33,140 --> 05:51:35,140
You know, you don't have to be shy.

5315
05:51:35,140 --> 05:51:37,140
You can talk to me in Marcell or something.

5316
05:51:37,140 --> 05:51:39,140
Oh, it's so quiet.

5317
05:51:39,140 --> 05:51:41,140
Giving me money quietly when I'm with Chad.

5318
05:51:43,140 --> 05:51:45,140
Whenever someone gives me something quietly,

5319
05:51:45,140 --> 05:51:46,140
everyone's like, what Chad?

5320
05:51:46,140 --> 05:51:47,140
What Chad?

5321
05:51:47,140 --> 05:51:49,140
And it's like, maybe he's just too scared to talk to me.

5322
05:51:49,140 --> 05:51:50,140
I don't know.

5323
05:51:50,140 --> 05:51:52,140
Don't be scared, Evelyn.

5324
05:51:52,140 --> 05:51:54,140
Either way, you're getting milked.

5325
05:51:55,140 --> 05:51:56,140
It was a great stream.

5326
05:51:56,140 --> 05:51:57,140
You enjoyed it.

5327
05:51:57,140 --> 05:51:58,140
I'm glad.

5328
05:51:58,140 --> 05:51:59,140
That was fun.

5329
05:51:59,140 --> 05:52:01,140
I didn't realize how hard Halo could be, though.

5330
05:52:01,140 --> 05:52:04,140
I thought it was easy for you to make sure again.

5331
05:52:06,140 --> 05:52:07,140
But we did it.

5332
05:52:07,140 --> 05:52:08,140
We did it.

5333
05:52:08,140 --> 05:52:10,140
Think fried something.

5334
05:52:10,140 --> 05:52:11,140
We did it.

5335
05:52:11,140 --> 05:52:12,140
We did it.

5336
05:52:13,140 --> 05:52:15,140
Anonymous, reward paid.

5337
05:52:15,140 --> 05:52:17,140
You are free.

5338
05:52:18,140 --> 05:52:19,140
What does that mean?

5339
05:52:20,140 --> 05:52:22,140
Reward paid.

5340
05:52:23,140 --> 05:52:24,140
I'm free.

5341
05:52:24,140 --> 05:52:26,140
Okay, I am going to go get a bath

5342
05:52:26,140 --> 05:52:28,140
because I reek of deodorant

5343
05:52:28,140 --> 05:52:30,140
after discovering what the flood...

5344
05:52:30,140 --> 05:52:32,140
No, I don't reek of deodorant.

5345
05:52:32,140 --> 05:52:35,140
I reek of body odor after discovering what the flood is.

5346
05:52:35,140 --> 05:52:38,140
So I'll see you in the bath, okay?

5347
05:52:38,140 --> 05:52:39,140
Yeah.

5348
05:52:39,140 --> 05:52:42,140
We can brain-rotten the bath together on TikTok.

5349
05:52:42,140 --> 05:52:44,140
How about that, Evelyn?

5350
05:52:44,140 --> 05:52:47,140
I'll put my lemon soap bar in as well,

5351
05:52:47,140 --> 05:52:49,140
so it smells nice.

5352
05:52:49,140 --> 05:52:50,140
The pheromone maxing.

5353
05:52:50,140 --> 05:52:52,140
Yeah, unfortunately, pheromones are going

5354
05:52:52,140 --> 05:52:54,140
because it's that stinky kind of feel.

5355
05:52:54,140 --> 05:52:56,140
You know how sometimes you can get a whiff for yourself

5356
05:52:56,140 --> 05:52:58,140
and you're like, oh, that's a wee bit stinky?

5357
05:52:58,140 --> 05:53:00,140
No, this is vile.

5358
05:53:00,140 --> 05:53:03,140
If you were to take a whiff, you'd gag.

5359
05:53:03,140 --> 05:53:05,140
Please bottle and sell to me.

5360
05:53:05,140 --> 05:53:07,140
Honestly, though.

5361
05:53:07,140 --> 05:53:09,140
Right, thank you so, so much,

5362
05:53:09,140 --> 05:53:12,140
my little rufflings for enjoy.

5363
05:53:12,140 --> 05:53:14,140
I just realized my heart rate is still displaying,

5364
05:53:14,140 --> 05:53:15,140
even though it's not.

5365
05:53:15,140 --> 05:53:17,140
Thank you so, so much for enjoying.

5366
05:53:17,140 --> 05:53:18,140
Please enjoy.

5367
05:53:18,140 --> 05:53:20,140
Amy Beezoo.

5368
05:53:20,140 --> 05:53:23,140
I will see you tomorrow

5369
05:53:23,140 --> 05:53:25,140
for some shenanigans with sin,

5370
05:53:25,140 --> 05:53:27,140
and then a membership stream.

5371
05:53:27,140 --> 05:53:30,140
And then we'll take it from there for the week, okay?

5372
05:53:30,140 --> 05:53:32,140
But hopefully I have some exciting news for the snowberries

5373
05:53:32,140 --> 05:53:34,140
when it comes to an AC role play,

5374
05:53:34,140 --> 05:53:36,140
as well for the reeflings

5375
05:53:36,140 --> 05:53:38,140
because my collab with Sage

5376
05:53:38,140 --> 05:53:39,140
that I never shut up about

5377
05:53:39,140 --> 05:53:40,140
because it never comes out,

5378
05:53:40,140 --> 05:53:41,140
but it's coming out soon.

5379
05:53:41,140 --> 05:53:42,140
Promise.

5380
05:53:42,140 --> 05:53:45,140
I just need to do a few background things, as always.

5381
05:53:45,140 --> 05:53:46,140
Wow, I can't believe it.

5382
05:53:46,140 --> 05:53:49,140
I can't believe I'm doing a YouTuber agency.

5383
05:53:49,140 --> 05:53:50,140
Takes a little bit of extra time.

5384
05:53:50,140 --> 05:53:51,140
Who'd you think, huh?

5385
05:53:51,140 --> 05:53:52,140
Who'd you think?

5386
05:53:52,140 --> 05:53:53,140
Amy Beezoo.

5387
05:53:53,140 --> 05:53:54,140
Thank you so much for joining

5388
05:53:54,140 --> 05:53:57,140
Heal Combat Evolved with me.

5389
05:53:57,140 --> 05:53:59,140
I'm so surprised we somehow survived

5390
05:53:59,140 --> 05:54:01,140
that car mission with the Warthog,

5391
05:54:01,140 --> 05:54:02,140
but we did it, okay?

5392
05:54:02,140 --> 05:54:05,140
And I'll see you tomorrow.

5393
05:54:05,140 --> 05:54:07,140
Um...

5394
05:54:07,140 --> 05:54:08,140
Mwah.

5395
05:54:08,140 --> 05:54:09,140
Mwah.

5396
05:54:09,140 --> 05:54:10,140
Mwah.

5397
05:54:10,140 --> 05:54:11,140
Mwah.

5398
05:54:11,140 --> 05:54:13,140
I'm gonna kiss ten times

5399
05:54:13,140 --> 05:54:16,140
because there's two killers and eight survivors tomorrow.

5400
05:54:16,140 --> 05:54:17,140
One.

5401
05:54:17,140 --> 05:54:18,140
Two.

5402
05:54:18,140 --> 05:54:19,140
Three.

5403
05:54:19,140 --> 05:54:20,140
Four.

5404
05:54:20,140 --> 05:54:21,140
Five.

5405
05:54:21,140 --> 05:54:22,140
Six.

5406
05:54:22,140 --> 05:54:23,140
Seven.

5407
05:54:23,140 --> 05:54:24,140
Eight.

5408
05:54:24,140 --> 05:54:25,140
Nine.

5409
05:54:25,140 --> 05:54:26,140
Ten.

5410
05:54:26,140 --> 05:54:27,140
Kisses.

5411
05:54:27,140 --> 05:54:28,140
Please enjoy Amy to your fullest content

5412
05:54:28,140 --> 05:54:29,140
with her Bob Ross hair,

5413
05:54:29,140 --> 05:54:30,140
which is terrifying.

5414
05:54:30,140 --> 05:54:31,140
But she's enjoying herself,

5415
05:54:31,140 --> 05:54:32,140
so that's the main thing.

5416
05:54:32,140 --> 05:54:33,140
Okay.

5417
05:54:33,140 --> 05:54:34,140
Bye-bye.

5418
05:54:34,140 --> 05:54:35,140
I see you tomorrow.

5419
05:54:35,140 --> 05:54:36,140
Mwah.

5420
05:54:36,140 --> 05:54:37,140
Mwah.

5421
05:54:37,140 --> 05:54:38,140
Mwah.

5422
05:54:38,140 --> 05:54:39,140
Mwah.

5423
05:54:39,140 --> 05:54:40,140
Mwah.
