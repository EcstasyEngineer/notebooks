0	9000	What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light on to the fucking tracking thing.
9000	12000	Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good.
12000	16000	Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted.
16000	20000	About, like, one minute late, she hates us.
20000	24000	You stop that. You naughty Nellie.
24000	27000	You naughty soft fans.
27000	30000	You naughty ballbags. Actually, don't say that word.
30000	33000	That's not, well, I mean, that's not the right word.
33000	35000	Uh...
35000	37000	Um...
39000	44000	Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello, I'm Marika. Hiya! Hiya!
44000	50000	Oh my god, what's that? We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed.
50000	54000	I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like.
54000	60000	Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support. Yay!
60000	64000	PayPal unblocked this.
64000	70000	Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time,
70000	75000	supported, like, everyone with donos, and PayPal was like, halt, halt.
75000	82000	This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things?
82000	86000	And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal.
86000	91000	Uh, we're streaming. Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock.
91000	94000	So you can support my daughters.
96000	101000	Good morning. Good evening.
101000	106000	And most of all, good afternoon, Reflings.
106000	110000	Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern?
110000	119500	Do-do-do-do..
119500	121500	How are you?
121500	126000	And you did? It was Aisi looking after you?
126000	132000	Did anyone touch your tummy? Don't lie, Aisi's best design element is her tummy.
132000	137500	Her navel, if you didn't know a belly button is also a refer to as a navel.
137500	142500	I understand you can't hear the background music of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood right now, ask that meme-in.
143500	149500	I apologize for being a whole 60 seconds late.
149500	151500	Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late?
151500	154500	Because I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab.
156500	159500	I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it.
159500	165500	I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in.
165500	168500	If not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship.
168500	171500	That's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started.
172500	175500	But it's been fantastic.
175500	182500	I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations, like I did yesterday, because I was absolutely awful.
182500	187500	I just kept missing everything left and right.
187500	191500	Everything left and right.
191500	194500	Left and right.
194500	196500	Oh, that's not how I can read.
196500	198500	Okay, there we go.
198500	201500	Woo, five hours of sleep and eight hours of work, and we're so bad.
201500	204500	Oh, please rest, okay?
204500	209500	I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower.
209500	214500	Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action.
214500	216500	I'll tell you something nasty.
217500	220500	Why can I not hear my game?
223500	225500	Hello, headset?
225500	227500	Headset?
227500	230500	Headset, I know there's, hello?
230500	237500	Okay, I cannot hear any sound, and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop.
237500	239500	Are you fucking serious?
239500	242500	By the way, this game lives up to the test of time.
243500	246500	Are we being true?
246500	249500	Why is it not coming out of desktop?
249500	252500	Is this a fucking joke?
252500	256500	How could this have been so scuffed?
256500	258500	I can't hear the game either.
258500	263500	Okay, fantastic, fantastic.
263500	265500	No, seriously.
265500	267500	The tips link is messed up again.
267500	269500	Are you joking?
269500	271500	God, I'm so scuffed.
272500	286500	I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now.
286500	290500	Ah, hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens.
290500	293500	Okay, I need to start clicking stuff.
293500	300500	Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio?
301500	304500	I am totally not raging right now.
311500	314500	Let's check, let's check.
314500	318500	Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me cook.
318500	323500	Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again.
323500	326500	Because why would it not be detectable on desktop?
326500	329500	That's rule one of gaming.
329500	332500	So I've closed it, it's now closed, you can't see none of it.
339500	346500	Also, I listened back, I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay.
346500	350500	My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up,
350500	355500	but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is.
360500	366500	Uh, yep, again, no audio.
366500	372500	If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad.
372500	374500	Why? I didn't do anything.
374500	380500	This is, I, Mercy has literally made a short about this exact scenario.
380500	386500	I cannot make this up, Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation.
386500	393500	Um, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
393500	398500	Game, audio, output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
398500	404500	Manage input devices, manage output devices, sound mixer, is it a sound mixer?
404500	407500	Input, yep, output, yep.
407500	413500	Why the frick, why the frick, frack, diddle-y-dack, tic-tac, pedi-wack?
413500	417500	Would this not be coming out?
417500	420500	I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this.
420500	422500	I'm not even kidding.
427500	431500	I can't believe this. Are you joking?
432500	437500	Oh!
442500	446500	It only took me seven minutes to start the stream!
451500	454500	Oh, 49% total synchronization.
454500	459500	Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then, if I'm only at 49%.
460500	463500	Literally, Mercy made a short about this.
463500	470500	I cannot wait for the short to come out, so you guys can be like, oh my god, oh my god, she was right.
470500	477500	Um, if you are not up to scratch, please do not worry,
477500	482500	because we have successfully finished campaign mode.
482500	488500	We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment.
488500	493500	We are now doing the kind of save quest-esque missions.
493500	499500	We are about to do a very sad mission for the Auditory family.
499500	503500	Auditory, me, I'm still here. Let's see, let's see, Auditory.
503500	506500	But gom, morning, good afternoon, good evening.
506500	509500	I hope, uh, oh, it's good.
509500	513500	I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment,
513500	525500	but as always, when another member goes live, I will force you to go insane to her stream.
528500	530500	Oh, okay, here we go.
530500	534500	I do not normally do this, so I'm not too familiar with what happens next.
536500	537500	Oh!
540500	542500	I think AC is going offline.
543500	546500	I see, in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Rome.
546500	550500	It's Leonardo. That's Leonardo's voice.
550500	551500	Hmm.
551500	552500	What's happening?
552500	556500	Etio seems to be remembering something. Something from 1506.
556500	560500	Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative.
560500	564500	No, the missing data may be there. The piece of Eden is useless until we have-
564500	566500	Oh, I don't remember much of this.
566500	568500	Let him continue. Yes, William.
568500	571500	Yes, William! Congrats if your name's William!
571500	573500	Any Williams and her?
577500	578500	Eh?
581500	582500	Eh?
583500	585500	The Da Vinci?
585500	587500	Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
587500	589500	The Da Vinci disappearing.
591500	592500	Did you know?
594500	595500	Oh, I remember!
601500	602500	Leonardo!
604500	605500	Good friend.
610500	611500	I see.
613500	615500	I see you reading Super Chess at the moment.
615500	617500	You're- Wait, she got monetized?
618500	620500	She couldn't have. I didn't link that.
620500	621500	Sense accounts.
622500	624500	Do you mean Donation?
627500	629500	No, they were doing- I was gonna say.
629500	631500	None of us have monetized these.
636500	640500	Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success. We're from a mission.
659500	661500	It's gonna be the Mona Lisa.
665500	666500	Acical!
667500	668500	My sleepy pee-
670500	671500	My sleepy acical.
671500	672500	How is strum?
673500	676500	I'm so sorry, AC. I never managed to catch any of the-
676500	677500	Snowberries!
677500	678500	Any snowberries?
679500	680500	Hi, snowberries!
681500	684500	We're currently talking to the historical icon, Leonardo Da Vinci.
686500	687500	He's a part of the campaign.
689500	690500	Get raided, get raided, get raided.
690500	692500	Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.
692500	694500	Are you squidding me right now?
695500	696500	Thank you for the 20.
696500	697500	Bajinga. What the fuck?
698500	700500	There's no way that says Bajinga.
700500	701500	Did I read that right?
701500	702500	I read it in the top corner.
705500	706500	Thank you Bajinga for the-
706500	708500	What? You didn't even leave a message!
708500	710500	Why are you called Bajinga?
711500	712500	Oh, now I can't read chat.
712500	714500	Oh god, I'm so brain dead.
714500	716500	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
717500	719500	Bajinga.
721500	722500	Good morning.
728500	730500	I'm glad you like icicles.
731500	732500	It's the woman.
733500	735500	Did you see the guitar AC design for-
735500	738500	No, I didn't manage to catch her stream.
738500	742500	I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios.
746500	749500	I told you those guys were lucky.
749500	751500	Fortuna wishes she were as good as me.
751500	752500	John Jacomo.
752500	755500	I do not answer to that name.
755500	756500	Honestly, me is real.
756500	758500	Better, but not good enough.
760500	761500	Yes!
761500	762500	I'm good to go.
762500	763500	She designed one for everyone.
763500	765500	Oh, I need to watch that VOD then.
767500	769500	No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon.
769500	772500	Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios.
772500	775500	I'm really struggling to know how to tag though.
776500	778500	If you didn't know.
780500	781500	Of men.
782500	784500	You worship their misery?
785500	786500	No, mate.
786500	790500	I actually prefer holes and no poles.
790500	792500	Then he's swinging that way, but actually,
792500	794500	he's not an against a mate.
800500	802500	Wait, is this DLC?
802500	803500	Yeah, Pink's Hole.
803500	804500	It's not like main quest stuff.
804500	806500	This is like side stuff.
806500	808500	Okay, ready to kill.
811500	813500	No reactive model today?
813500	815500	Oh, I never put it on.
815500	817500	I've got this though.
818500	820500	That's if I make a joke, I can do that.
822500	823500	Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat.
823500	824500	Hold on, hold on.
824500	825500	Get the wee knife out.
825500	827500	Wee knife and let them attack you.
827500	829500	Oh, I can call them assassins.
831500	833500	So if I make a pun that I like,
833500	835500	I can literally do that.
836500	838500	Okay, the assassin's on the horse.
838500	839500	I'm happy.
844500	846500	Can you get off the horses?
847500	848500	Oh, that was brutal.
849500	851500	No, you can attack me then.
852500	853500	There we go.
853500	854500	Whoa, I missed that.
854500	856500	Okay, there we go.
858500	861500	Please God, do that as hilarious.
861500	863500	Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun,
863500	865500	all you're going to hear is that all day long.
876500	878500	Casually kills a dozen people.
881500	882500	Apologize.
883500	884500	Any apologizers?
885500	886500	Man, let me burp.
886500	887500	No, sorry, let me raid the horse.
887500	888500	Jeez.
888500	889500	I didn't mean to say that.
889500	891500	Literally what I was about to do.
892500	893500	Why is he running?
893500	894500	Nothing.
895500	898500	I drink honey tea.
898500	900500	I have a lovely honey tea.
900500	904500	Just for me, some honey tea.
904500	910500	And a game full of nostalgia.
910500	915500	And I'll play and ramble all day.
915500	922500	So I can enjoy the game with you.
922500	925500	I'm not even, I don't know what the tone of the song is after that.
925500	926500	Come with me.
926500	927500	Yeah, there you go.
928500	930500	Wait, so what are you?
930500	932500	I am a cuttlefish.
932500	935500	I'm a siren and a cuttlefish.
935500	939500	But the problem with being a siren is I can't sing.
939500	945500	So I have to rely on my hypnotic abilities to steal the hearts of men
945500	948500	and then perish them in the war.
949500	951500	I did not make my lore, by the way.
952500	957500	But in terms of who's the most evil out of all of us in Vealor,
957500	958500	I'm pretty evil.
958500	961500	And then it goes Emmy, but Emmy isn't inherently evil.
961500	965500	She just really wants her brother back and she does stuff to entertain herself.
965500	966500	Okay.
966500	967500	What tea?
970500	974500	I drank some tea, so if I start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea.
976500	979500	I would, oh you'd perish in my water willingly.
984500	985500	Follow me.
985500	986500	Follow me.
994500	1001500	We are following, following the leader, the leader, the leader,
1001500	1005500	trailing behind the leader, going ahead of the leader,
1005500	1008500	the lead to lead to lead to lead to lead.
1009500	1011500	Oops, oops, oops.
1011500	1013500	I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section,
1013500	1016500	because they could spot me a mile away, but hey ho.
1017500	1019500	Somehow things work out in the end.
1026500	1032500	It speaks volumes about Vealor, but the most evil person is not the god of the fish.
1032500	1035500	No, Azura created you.
1035500	1037500	She's your literal mother.
1037500	1039500	She created humanity as we know it.
1041500	1045500	Like, so Azura is like the kindest.
1045500	1048500	Mercy's just misdirected, okay?
1048500	1051500	Mercy just, she just doesn't understand,
1051500	1054500	because she does genuinely love,
1054500	1060500	but sometimes that love results in your expiration date,
1060500	1063500	which is a shame, but she doesn't mean it, okay?
1063500	1065500	She's wholesome.
1065500	1067500	She's like a dorky yandere.
1067500	1072500	She lures your guard, and then before you know it,
1072500	1075500	the finishing act occurs.
1075500	1077500	And then, yeah.
1079500	1082500	Oh, we're learning about catacombs that we can go in.
1082500	1085500	Oh, this is the DLC called Leonardo's Diaries.
1085500	1088500	I just remember that literally eight right now.
1088500	1092500	I thought it was an auditory mission, but it's gone.
1093500	1095500	Um...
1096500	1098500	Taste my...
1098500	1100500	Oh, no, we're just...
1100500	1102500	For size?
1102500	1104500	Oh, I got a double A or something.
1109500	1111500	Rick, wait, I'm going to get a quick drink of my tea.
1111500	1112500	I apologize.
1112500	1113500	Don't let her deceive you.
1113500	1115500	It's all just part of her plan to lure us into her watery graves.
1115500	1117500	Oh my god, that was such a hard word to say.
1117500	1119500	Watery graves.
1119500	1121500	Yandere grapes.
1121500	1123500	Terrible.
1123500	1124500	Again.
1124500	1128500	We are jumping into the DLCs of Sasuke Brotherhood.
1128500	1132500	We've finished the main quest, and we are going to try and 100% this bad boy.
1132500	1133500	Think I can do it?
1133500	1134500	I have no idea.
1134500	1137500	I did not look up what the tank mission is, so I'm getting scurred.
1137500	1139500	DLCs.
1143500	1145500	Ah, delicious.
1145500	1146500	Not...
1146500	1147500	You're true?
1148500	1152500	Honey is very good for avoiding illness.
1152500	1154500	But Antelba...
1154500	1156500	And take back cereal.
1157500	1161500	Sorry, that guy's talking at the same time, and it makes it hard to talk and think.
1161500	1163500	Whoa, E.I.
1163500	1165500	E.I. Burger.
1166500	1168500	I'm a beautiful fish.
1168500	1170500	Oh, we should watch that movie.
1170500	1171500	The song is like...
1171500	1176500	I'm a little little fish in the deep blue sea.
1176500	1179500	Somebody help me.
1180500	1181500	No help.
1181500	1182500	No help.
1183500	1185500	Whoa, whoa, whoa, I've gone too far.
1185500	1187500	I think I'm about to desync.
1188500	1189500	Oh, no, they're just walking past.
1189500	1190500	Okay.
1190500	1194500	Walking behind.
1195500	1196500	Out my way.
1196500	1198500	Out my way.
1198500	1200500	Oh, I'm on the floor.
1200500	1201500	No help.
1201500	1206500	Strongly evil intentions through Cain's axe.
1206500	1208500	Amy, Cain's intentions through evil.
1208500	1211500	Yeah, basically, Amy just wants her brother back.
1212500	1216500	And she Cain to has a bit of fun with the spells, really.
1216500	1218500	That's how she was concepted.
1220500	1222500	Oh, the Yoink Leonardo!
1232500	1233500	I do not know.
1233500	1234500	Katso.
1242500	1243500	What does he say?
1244500	1245500	I cannot read.
1246500	1247500	Leonardo.
1247500	1248500	Depente.
1249500	1250500	Depente?
1252500	1254500	He wants us to examine art.
1255500	1256500	I remember when Leonardo.
1256500	1257500	He was Leonardo.
1257500	1258500	Back.
1259500	1262500	The every lovey painting's hung in the gallery there.
1262500	1264500	What do they have to do at their temple?
1264500	1266500	You're the cuff, you're the cuss.
1266500	1268500	Oh, it's Edgy girlfriend.
1268500	1270500	Hey, thanks for doing the watch alone, baby.
1272500	1274500	God, I can be the cuss cull fish that ever did cull.
1276500	1277500	Hope you're doing well.
1277500	1278500	Thanks again for doing the watch alone.
1279500	1281500	I appreciate you winking at you right now.
1285500	1286500	You got three deal?
1286500	1293460	a three-deal? You wanna do ASMR together? You're slayed in on my Twitter DM? That's terrible.
1293460	1297620	That's absolutely terrible. Please do not feel put on the spot. And anyway, I'm just, I'm just
1297620	1311460	moving around. I'm such a fiend. I'm a little ASMR fiend. Right, we're gonna keep doing a Leonardo
1311460	1318580	situation. So, if you didn't get any of that plot, Leonardo has been yoinked and he discovered
1319140	1326180	some sort of advantageous thing that would, oh pardon me, excuse me, come through. Sorry,
1326180	1330420	reading chat. I was reading chat, excuse me, I was reading chat, excuse me sir. Have you
1330420	1337540	heard about this? Have you seen this about chat? Yeah? Oh my god. Slayed in right now.
1337540	1343860	Yeah, slayed in my DMs. And then I'll, I'll do the rest of the work, okay? I got you covered,
1343860	1351300	babykicks. Biba, biba an ASMR fiend, you know? Oh, Catherine, not Catherine, Christina's coming
1351300	1360100	up. Oh right, we'll do Christina. So basically, we stalked her home and then we got a kiss. So
1360260	1369620	surely this isn't gonna get weird any further? Reading chat, obviously, a mistake to do. I
1369620	1376580	know literally doing it like in a game is so hard. Let's strongly lead my pleasure. I remember that
1376580	1385460	it's, yeah, it was a bit, it was a bit sus. I have to admit it's ill. It was a bit sus. Now, we, the girls
1385460	1393700	can do it to you. That's fine. You know, that's fine. By the way, around Christina, we're in
1393700	1405540	Firenze. Assassin's Creed 2 is like Firenze. Oh, this is so sad. Oh, this is so sad.
1405780	1420020	Mm. In Assassin's Creed 2, your family get hung due to treachery. This, this is really sad. This,
1420020	1428260	I don't like this one. This is pretty freaking sad, honestly. Oh, I can't remember the past though.
1428660	1435460	Mm. This is very sad. So the girls, yeah, yeah, so we can do it to you, but you're not allowed to do it to us.
1444020	1449300	Come here, you fanny. Bunk. Oh, I missed, I missed. That was really embarrassing, actually.
1450260	1454980	Imagine someone coming to punch. Oh, I did it again. I'm like punching the air. This
1454980	1456820	can't be one air that's going on with him.
1472740	1475940	Assassin's Creed 2 is actually very beautiful, considering how old it is.
1475940	1486260	Mm. I don't want to speak because I don't know, for a fact. This might genuinely be the imported
1486260	1492820	map from Assassin's Creed 2. Where the heck am I trying to go? Swinging at his family.
1492820	1500980	Sorry. To be honest, it was, it's his first day. Yeah, his first day, as you know.
1500980	1508500	What do you do? Only one thing to do. Kill them. No, don't do that. They did nothing wrong.
1508500	1514740	They follow orders unquestioning me. That makes... Unquestioning me. That's a very hard word.
1514740	1518100	I'll sneak behind their backs. That's a big word for scrawny.
1518580	1522740	Time if I have to. Carry them down to the river. Be careful.
1525300	1532580	Right, if I remember correctly, I can just do this. And there's one patrolling guard
1533780	1538340	that will desync you if you're not. Oh, he's up there. I can see him.
1540100	1545780	Oh, this is so sad. This is literally the bodies of my freaking family.
1546100	1551300	Oh, I've desynced already. Wait, am I not to kill these people?
1553300	1558660	Wait, did I desync if I kill them, Chris? Without killing any... Right, how did I do that?
1559700	1564980	Uh... Wait, he perished because he went in the water. Right, come in the water. Come in the water.
1564980	1568900	And you come. Come into the water. Come on. Good boy. Be a good boy. Into the water. Wee!
1568900	1574660	You love water, don't you? You love it. Into the water. Come on. Come on. He's a good boy.
1574660	1579940	He's a good boy that wants to come in the water. Yes! No! Jump in the water. Jump in the water.
1579940	1584260	Jump in the water. Come on. Oh, wait. Can I knock him out? Does it count if I knock you out?
1584260	1587460	Let me knock you out. Boom! Get in the water. Yeah, good boy. Get in the water.
1589140	1593460	Right, in the water. In the water. You too. You're next. In the water. Don't be throwing rocks at
1593460	1600740	me. That's no nice. Ha ha! Ha ha! Get pulled. Get pulled. In the water. Go! Good boy. In the
1600740	1607780	water. You go. Okay, we did it. We did it. Okay, now back to the sad part. This is my big brother.
1608580	1614020	And, yeah. This, honestly, it's pretty messed up. All things considered.
1616180	1621540	Poppy down there. Oh, his body just kind of ragdoll and...
1622420	1631060	It's so leaving their deaths to fate once again, probably. Oh, no. This was your wee brother.
1632420	1639460	It was actually so freaking sad in Assassin's Creed 2. So your mother, Maria,
1640260	1647700	she doesn't talk until you collect a hundred feathers because Pietro, the wee little brother,
1647700	1652740	was collecting feathers. And once you collect all 100 feathers, she finally speaks her first words
1652740	1659940	after the death of everyone. And it's just like such a freaking sad thing, genuinely. And then this
1659940	1669300	is your dad. Oh, it was so sad. Literally so freaking sad. Yeah, the feather quest. That's why
1669300	1679380	there's 10 feathers in this game. I guess it's a memoria. I have to leave the city. Christina, I
1679380	1681460	want you to come with me.
1683620	1688660	I want to. But I can't. My family.
1693300	1695460	So you can always be together, Christina.
1696020	1696580	It's you.
1696980	1708260	Actually so sad.
1711380	1715780	She doesn't... She doesn't come with those.
1718020	1725860	And Christina's ex, he was like true love. And then so sad. She's feeding corpses to the fishes.
1726820	1727300	That's true.
1730340	1735380	And there was no in-game map for the feathers. Do you want to hear the worst part about the
1735380	1743300	feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2? So my Xbox was in a different room from where the computer
1743300	1750500	was in my house. So I would have to scurry to the living room and memorize a location of a feather
1750500	1755220	and then scurry back through to my Xbox as a child. I was doing this back and forth.
1755220	1759620	My mum was like, what on earth are you doing, Strony? I'm getting worried about you.
1759620	1763780	And I was like, it's the feathers! The feathers, mum! The feathers! I need the feathers!
1763780	1768020	What do you need the feathers for? I was like scurrying back and forth.
1772340	1778100	And I did it once. I've never done it again. But we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2.
1779060	1780900	Which is our DLC.
1790260	1794260	Allegedly, so the way I memorize things, I don't have a very good brain.
1795700	1800420	So I had to open my eyes really wide and order. Oh, it's the crit sale.
1808100	1835540	Wow. So after Chesery's date with fate, the crit sale got married off.
1838420	1840340	And Chanel lives on the countryside and hiding.
1845380	1850340	But yeah, I used to like have to, in order to memorize stuff, I had to open my eyes really
1850340	1854820	wide, which I know seems bizarre, but it's the only way I could do it. I just had to go like,
1855700	1860260	and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run to the Xbox and like where the location was.
1860820	1864740	It sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud, but it was the only way I could do it.
1864820	1868260	Like the like phones weren't like, well, I didn't have a phone.
1870580	1873620	Because I was a child and like, yeah, phones weren't like that.
1883460	1887380	This is really dangerous because I actually don't know which way. Okay, okay, that was lucky.
1888420	1893460	Eyes wide must take all information. I was literally like, sorry, can't speak. Don't talk to me.
1894900	1898100	And then I'd get another feather and then come back through and look at the next one.
1898660	1903220	And if you like pick up feathers on the way, actually being set a bit harder.
1905620	1913220	There are guards everywhere. La Crescia is, is that just a straight jump? I think so. Okay.
1916660	1920820	You don't hear a grown man fall into here. Literally, oh my back.
1925620	1933220	Yeah, you don't remember which feathers you pick up along the way. So it makes it even harder
1934100	1941460	because if you go to the area you think it, it was that, um, sorry, I got nervous. I'm about to go
1941460	1941860	the wrong way.
1941860	1947700	You're stuck on that side. No one will hear you. Are you ready? No. Stay where you are.
1947700	1952020	Let me through. You must wait until the Tukesa allows you to pass.
1953540	1960980	I can reach that, jeez. Another wind. Skyrim logic must be the best logic.
1961700	1968100	Sorry, is there, I think, no, there can't be flags on the DLC. That's not allowed. Whoa.
1968180	1971140	So that camera angle change, sheesh.
1975140	1979860	Although I will say one thing about this DLC, this is so satisfying because, um,
1979860	1983860	you really won't get caught by the guards doing this. You can literally parkour your way through
1983860	1991220	it and the guards don't actually catch you, which I see is very satisfying gameplay wise.
1991220	1992500	What a satisfying yes.
1993460	1998580	Um, I do like the idea of, like, it so being able to, like, completely sneak undetected
1998580	2000660	without the fear of being detected.
2003940	2011220	Oh my god. Uh, I have terrible news, I need to pee already. Um, yeah, like, see, I love this.
2011220	2015380	This is, like, so satisfying. Like, I'm just quietly sneaking around.
2016340	2024500	Ooh. We're in the gardens of whatever that goddess name is and I've already forgotten
2024500	2025860	what the garden's called.
2028500	2032660	Okay, this is the bit where you can lose, I think.
2035060	2037220	Right, you can't climb the hedge, I guess.
2037380	2038820	Okay, okay.
2044820	2046500	As if they don't hear me fucking...
2054020	2058020	What was that supposed to do? I have no idea. Oh, I just went for it. Oops.
2060580	2064180	They are so dead. Oh, the cret. Honestly, this outfit, they're gonna...
2064900	2066180	Benesons.
2066180	2067220	Gentle.
2067220	2069060	Benesons Veechever?
2069060	2071060	History Veechever?
2083700	2084740	I'll redecorate that win.
2084740	2085940	Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop!
2089060	2089940	I'm sorry.
2094500	2097940	She is home. Yeah, do you like her haze?
2115380	2117940	Go, we are really a ladies, man.
2124180	2130900	And one for someone who was special to me, Patrizio. He spends his time near Ilvatica.
2130900	2132980	I'm not gonna lie, Riflin, if you did that to me yet, Mel.
2132980	2136180	I'll give it to you soon. Give it to me.
2137620	2138100	Guards!
2140900	2144740	Place the Vinci's Annunciation in a cart. Leave it outside the walls.
2147460	2148180	No.
2148740	2152020	Oh, lo bene. Now, close your eyes.
2152980	2154580	I don't remember what's happening.
2156500	2160580	There's no way. We killed her brother and...
2167940	2169780	No, we won the scene.
2175060	2181940	Oh. Oh, see, all you had to do was put your pole in the hole and now the guards are on.
2182900	2184660	So it was that simple. Come on.
2185460	2188420	You heard that doctor at the start. There's a cure for syphilis.
2189940	2191220	Oh, I don't know where to go.
2191220	2192420	Take up the stairs.
2192420	2195300	This is the most logical reason because why would you put the stairs at 12 o'clock?
2195300	2197140	Oh, I don't know where to go.
2197140	2198020	And there's a timer.
2199540	2203220	There's so many guards, so many guards inside.
2203220	2204260	We go back inside.
2205220	2207380	Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.
2207380	2208340	Let me go, let me go, let me go.
2208340	2210660	Okay, across, across the chandelier.
2212420	2213620	Unfortunate.
2214740	2215780	Door locked down.
2215780	2216820	Okay, okay, okay.
2216820	2217860	Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo.
2219460	2221220	Sorry, I cannot reach out. I'm getting stressed.
2221220	2222580	This is a freaking time hard.
2224180	2225860	Okay, and then wee.
2225860	2227460	And then run across, run across, run across.
2227460	2228500	Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
2229940	2231060	Okay, we can do it, we can do it.
2231060	2232020	Come on, I say, come on, I say.
2232020	2232500	Don't be scared.
2234580	2236020	Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to whistle that.
2236020	2239220	I just whistled because I was breathing like with a small mouth.
2240500	2243380	My pardon, my pardon, your pardon, I beg.
2243380	2245700	I don't say my pardon, you beg.
2245700	2247060	But you don't need to ask me.
2247060	2248260	Oh, did we do it?
2248260	2249140	Oh, was that it?
2249140	2250180	I was actually really quick.
2252580	2253080	What?
2253700	2254200	What?
2256740	2257860	One out of five pins.
2257860	2259460	Okay, we nailed that.
2260100	2261700	We nailed that.
2262500	2264020	We absolutely nailed that.
2264980	2265860	Who's pardon now?
2270820	2272980	That was, that was scary.
2272980	2273860	But we did it.
2274500	2276980	Only one minute and 57 seconds is fair.
2278900	2282260	Okay, that went so well.
2282260	2284580	Honestly, can you distract on a horse?
2285380	2286420	Can you distract with me?
2286420	2287460	Whoo, yeah, you can.
2288580	2290660	Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, camera angle, camera angle.
2290660	2292420	Relax, relax.
2292420	2293460	Ooh, wait, I'm funny.
2294180	2297380	Um, this is terrible, but can I go for a pee already?
2298420	2300100	I need to tinkle my winkle.
2301380	2303460	Please get up and stretch and get a thingy.
2303460	2304660	I actually generally do pee.
2305540	2306180	So sorry.
2306180	2309060	It's like so quick into the screen, but I just noticed it.
2309060	2309860	And now I'm like, huh.
2310500	2312020	Okay, I'll be, I'll literally be a minute.
2312020	2314340	Okay, stretch your legs and get a war.
2314340	2316340	I'm going to get, oh, I have a war already.

3021140	3028100	suppose the error lies in her Spanish blood I know it such untruth you so casually utter based
3028180	3035140	on little more than a name these countries these groups make such easy targets for the lazy
3035140	3041860	and ignorant you should tell her that the high and mighty duquesa putana I have changed my mind
3041860	3044420	that painting does not deserve to belong to anyone
3049140	3056100	I take the painting and examine it for clues be careful human hands aided by a fierce intelligence
3056100	3062660	made that treat it with respect go he casted London experience

3073940	3081700	what he's so fast how am I desyncing
3084180	3089780	he's literally faster than the speed that I can run at I'm not sure why the game is telling me
3089780	3100020	careful you're desyncing yeah get arrow stormed get arrow stormed you deserve it you stinky stink
3100660	3106980	leave the Vatican district okay working on it's ill there was a poll there that you could have
3106980	3113780	grabbed to save the health of your ankles I'm not going to take responsibility for you being sore
3115700	3119940	because that was point blank it's ill that was point blank no excuse
3120260	3129700	I'm trying to escape this district it puts you like all the way into a certain section of the
3129700	3132420	map and then it's like oh by the way go all the way out of the section
3135780	3142420	and out and out shake all about you do the hockey pokey and you run around and that's what's all about
3143380	3152660	hey that's green let's start wasn't even I'm seeing viewer from your pentas have you
3152660	3161300	drawn your pentas a little too much the funniest thing I got a few maros I wouldn't say anyone was
3161300	3168420	like disgruntled I think they were surprised so out of all the four audios for sheebie three of them
3168420	3174100	are her in control and one of them is her not in the controlling position guess which one you
3174100	3180900	all voted well the majority voted for the one who was me and then I've got a few messages and I'm
3180900	3187780	like ah please I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better and we are working on making graphics
3187780	3196580	so you know what content is coming up and it just takes time like we're we're settling into everything
3197300	3205460	and obviously Emmy got a warning recently and sheebie's lower video got 18 plus so I think
3205460	3211460	we're actually debating about deleting it to try and ensure she gets monetization I would be
3211460	3217540	mortified for the girls if they didn't get like they were rejected from youtube monetization because
3217540	3224980	of me because member the girls didn't pick their designs and I would feel like so upset like don't
3224980	3229220	get me wrong there's still stream elements there's still patreon there's still like tips on stream in
3229220	3235300	general which is perfectly fine um heck I'm not supposed to go but I would like be mortified if
3235300	3240580	like they had to wait an entire month for monetization streams all because like I didn't think I had to
3240580	3244260	get a toggle to like cover up the cleavage
3244660	3245540	hmm
3264180	3269860	what do you normally need to do to get monetized 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours but your
3269860	3274660	channel can still be rejected um which is understandable like they need to go through the
3274660	3280420	content but like um hoping you know all things considered like if the girls are sitting doing
3280420	3285300	like game streams and all of that it's just another like yeah they're just gamers pass it on like
3286260	3293140	obviously before we could launch I could only spell out so much like don't be silly of course
3293940	3299620	like the girls aren't gonna be wait am I not to be detected I don't don't detect me I'm scared
3303540	3304260	get in here
3306260	3311140	who dares approach the bail of hey right we're just gonna go for it because there's no need to
3312180	3318900	assume we can just run right those guys are bugged out because that guy I literally couldn't
3318900	3325780	give a left a boot crack oh I'm gonna hurt my ankles thank goodness we have the armor because yeah
3327940	3331780	I'm just gonna run for the objective there's no point in to stopping and fight because it's
3331780	3338260	one of those ones where they just keep spawning in more guys and it's just a waste of time
3340020	3346500	we're trying to 100% this I say that as if we don't have to like redo all of this again probably
3346820	3353460	to get 100% I actually don't know what oh no 100% was don't be detected or something that's impossible
3353460	3358740	if they're gonna just constantly spam enemies may I sit on the bench please

7322500	7326100	no happy ending for the best character literally like
7326980	7331620	there must have been more written I'm so sorry but I do not believe for a moment the
7331620	7340100	development team ended it there for Christina literally it's saving him from Gamba and going
7340100	7345380	do you love her do you love her and then that's it I do not believe one second the writers left
7345380	7352980	it there if there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse I refuse I refuse
7353380	7360340	whoa what is a man to write all I know is
7365380	7369220	but it's you will have a hell of a happy ending I can't remember what happens at the end of
7369220	7376260	revolutions I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got
7376260	7383940	kidnapped but that's not the true love Christina was
7386580	7388980	like ah

7553460	7557300	had to go by the Christina mission wouldn't show up in my game so you're welcome literally
7557860	7563540	first and only girl in the series I so doesn't lose literally okay
7565700	7570180	so someone said I didn't take the medicine like a dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb dumb
7572660	7574420	jeez oh wow because I'm
7580100	7583220	okay I know I'm replaying it I didn't know it did it like this
7583300	7587380	doctor I like fully armored up fully healed up
7590820	7593220	uh okay I'll take it I'll take it
7599140	7607140	okay let's do this the totally hello mr. doctor may I please have oh my arm
7608100	7613220	salute I require medicine and you find a doctor you're 100 health mate
7614340	7617540	it's just speaking out literally he just needs a bit of attention honestly felt that
7617540	7620820	I needed a bit of attention I felt that over time
7621700	7627300	gracias four out of five doctors would suggest leeches but they have not proven effective
7627300	7631940	against such things however I can recommend several good colleagues around the city
7632660	7636260	do you need anything else no sir thank you very much for your help please
7639060	7642340	right checkpoint reached I've not
7645940	7653620	I think it was the guards uh the guards hit me remember when the guard hit me around that
7653620	7660660	corner I think this entire section is for that I don't have climbing gloves okay so I don't have
7660660	7663540	what abilities I don't have at that time
7666660	7668900	Chad doctor not prescribing leeches honestly
7672420	7672900	right
7677460	7677780	um
7680340	7684900	what's my opinion I was having to pee it was a game yeah
7685620	7690820	okay it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that
7692260	7699300	literally our storm would wait this yeah it was definitely because they hit me
7703300	7707540	we'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo
7707540	7712500	for well it would be nice to finish Christina but then we're having like backtrack all this way
7712900	7718900	right what weapons okay I do have my fast knife so hopefully none of them like
7719460	7724980	fly out of the corner and attack me because that was what happened the first time like they
7724980	7731860	started attacking me way before we even got to the gallow which is where it's supposed to start so
7731860	7735140	I'll definitely hold back a bit more to be cautious
7735540	7742180	like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3 well
7744900	7750580	I wouldn't play it on stream though like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of
7750580	7758820	that and I really love how forgiving the counter controls are and brotherhood and revelations
7758820	7766020	I think it's roughly the same um but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards they like change the controls
7766020	7773540	and I am definitely if it's not broke don't fix it and if you fixed it it has now made like gameplay
7773540	7779940	frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like
7780660	7785220	oopsie whoopsie you forgot to dodge this attack so now you're desynced and you have to repeat this
7785220	7790740	over and over and over again because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the
7790740	7795380	controls on brotherhood were received so well because it's like our best well-received game
7795380	7804580	you know like that stuff just makes me perish all right we're still gonna stay back we're not
7804580	7812180	quite at the gallows yet but I don't want anyone reaching to attack me and I definitely have time
7812180	7814500	to react if I've kind of got this distance on them
7821620	7828660	sorry excuse me pardon me come through all right take your time actually I have smoke bombs I'm
7828660	7834100	wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them if they turn on me
7834100	7841780	are we at the gallows yet I'm like getting scared I do not want to replay this if it's
7841780	7846100	literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off
7850020	7851700	I don't know if I should claim you know that
7854100	7857460	that's okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
7857460	7862580	okay I have access to all my long range I am using it
7865780	7869860	please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness
7872820	7882020	oh wow this is did I just I don't know citizens please do not walk in front of the crossbow
7882420	7889140	okay there we go 100% yeah okay this is so much easier I did not realize we'd have access to the
7889140	7896100	older weapons for this stuff as well this will make it easy that guy had a death wish literally like
7896100	7902100	thank you for it's you did not kill civilians well because civilians certainly pop themselves off
7902100	7909540	right that's fine uh double oh we've got one missing from this one as well
7910420	7917140	don't be detected while reducing to a righty that's like super easy why have I failed these ones
7918100	7919460	fake game are clearly
7923380	7929460	uh right oh I need to do the whole thing over again
7932660	7935140	10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strutting for distressing
7935380	7941380	my door was this the game that had the terror defense no that was revelations
7944580	7949780	because you were super excited and borrowing them to a barrel thank you that man is a traitor
7949780	7957140	to our order your character design romancy of mesmer from subnautica is there NPCs in subnautica
7957140	7962900	I thought it was like you versus all deafish I'm not pleased
7965140	7967140	subnautica
7969220	7976100	but he is an assassin not a traitor you run into guards well oh that's right that's true that's true
7980980	7989620	the mesmer is a fish I'm a fish too I'm a photo fish oh I didn't sink my my cheeky iPhone
7990180	7991780	let me calibrate myself right now
7996100	8000740	ah okay I calibrated so now you can like really tell what I'm looking at yeah
8002180	8004980	okay we will rock you for one
8007540	8012020	it's a scary little fish that hypnotizes you stop it's actually okay maybe we will have to
8012020	8014980	play subnautica I didn't realize I was in the game
8015940	8029700	there are NPC messages okay that's great right how much ammo oh I need a restock ammo okay
8029700	8035780	I'm actually gonna do the the pouch upgrade so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches
8035780	8043140	increase your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and it'll definitely help out in these
8043140	8045860	kind of rewind situations
8053780	8059540	wait you've never played subnautica I don't remember I think I've seen people play it which
8059540	8067940	is why I say like I don't remember playing it um I'm in my tummy's wumbling okay okay
8067940	8070260	after this one we go get food and fizzy juice
8073540	8075140	boom
8079060	8080420	wow that would hurt
8084420	8088260	we can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica
8088260	8093220	because I have no concept of what to do my son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him
8094420	8098260	not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot
8103700	8108740	I may not have an automatic but I'll I'll do it anyway oh whoa whoa what are you doing
8110100	8113780	yeah yeah yeah whoa they're like destroying him
8116100	8122580	stop why are you just accepting gunshots that oh okay we did it we did it quick I'd run the guards
8122580	8128020	can we hold hands anyway yeah I subnautica multiplayer imagine if you guys can come in and help me
8128580	8134820	oh we should have more games like that uh right don't get caught while reducing notoriety I'd like to
8134820	8143380	see you son oh my tummy's really yumbling whoa that was a good switcheroo words my stomach is really
8143380	8151060	rumbling okay as soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem but I don't notice it for
8151060	8156180	like hours on end are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel
8156180	8161540	like it is going that way it's single player oh that sucks it would be so fun to play
8167540	8173860	there is a mod but I don't know if I need like whoa what's going on there's like three groups here
8173860	8180420	yo shouldn't be inter clashing the tree someone's taking the tree okay okay we're good we're good

8187620	8188660	mutual hypnotizing
8190740	8197940	no I'm stuck okay and then we quickly run ahead and then we don't get detected whilst reducing our
8197940	8203300	notoriety can I just say shout out to the word notoriety you're so satisfying to see
8203380	8212020	no a rioting no a rioting good me good me good work good way there's subnautica and subnautica below

9143540	9150420	strongly just never grew anything um like I remember when she got me a training bra
9151380	9157620	like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing one because it's
9157620	9161780	actually really uncomfortable like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable
9161780	9167700	but like having something to strap down moving parts um it's kind of cut
9171140	9175060	how much am I missing is that like less than 500 florins roughly
9175940	9183780	oh um and like she got me one and I was like mum what is this for and she was like oh well
9183780	9188740	I've got big gibberish so you're gonna get big gibberish as well and I'm like um okay so like
9188740	9202820	I start training and then nothing happened no not like a sports bra like just like a thin
9202900	9210340	fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah nothing happened nothing happened with me for
9215380	9221780	but I'm not mad like I quite like my aesthetic some people like have struggles with their
9221780	9231540	bodies but I am really lucky because I I prefer being uh not having much up but having a lot down
9231540	9233300	like I really like my body
9237140	9239300	yeah like small buddies don't get in the way either
9241140	9248260	like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like uh the only pain
9248820	9256900	I get is like I don't get any pain because of my physique I would say that sorry I'm trying to like
9256900	9264580	think and do things at the same time and it's not working out um I would say like my physique
9264580	9272180	just means like I'm always good to go basically uh right we'll be doing another DNA
9274180	9280820	bro but do you know okay there's quite a lot oh no only two only two
9281380	9288660	do castle crusher no I don't want to do you the burdens we carry no I don't want to do you either
9288660	9294740	right I'm gonna avoid any don't be I can do it in this one I know how to do that one
9299700	9307380	so I just went on a massive ramble about that milk milk and dump truck as I go oh mini milk is
9307700	9315700	yeah mini mocha oh no we don't have our sassan recruits but we should at this point
9319060	9326340	it's gonna be a bit painful wait where are you gonna get some food oh I was
9327780	9330260	okay we'll do it after this one see you guys distracted me
9330500	9332260	be fine stay alert
9333780	9342340	oofy I forgot to get up wait I have one sassan recruit thing
9344100	9346260	is that because I only had one at the time
9348900	9354420	oh no it's because they're all away on missions right now okay so if my sassans are way on missions
9354420	9360820	they're not available during recall that's yeah I understand that's probably like programming
9360820	9365940	would have been a nightmare so yeah no that makes sense okay I won't send my recruits away too much
9365940	9371780	anymore if that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the
9371780	9378260	assassin signal I'm just gonna do this right now because I'm pretty sure it'll count towards my
9378260	9381620	hiring the to lure the guards
9392820	9396900	at the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies
9396900	9400100	should have got some food bozos
9400260	9411860	yeah you put everyone else on quest literally I need to go around and find all these gestures
9411860	9416740	I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture thing like they get money or just something
9416740	9425380	happen where does that senator I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back
9425380	9431460	for this mission right yes we're gonna do that that's probably the best idea right now so I don't
9431460	9436260	mess up this mission I'm actually gonna go out of range just so the event doesn't trigger
9436900	9445380	um please get off there we go we're just hiding here why not I'm going to go get some food I'm
9445380	9449540	going to get a drink as well oh did you see that street performer fall over there oh dear
9450340	9457140	I'm gonna go for pee and please do get up and hydrate and stretch your legs um because we
9457140	9462420	do not have hemorrhoids in the reefing gang I'll be back very shortly literally I just need to
9462420	9469380	like put it all in a bowl and then uh that's it really I don't recall if I need to do anything else
9470260	9472580	maybe make a hot water bottle because I'm a bit too late
9472580	9476420	bit too late I'll be I'll be like a couple of minutes
9502580	9506420	all right you'll need a beating

9862220	9865860	I could have sworn I was in that hay bale but whatever.
9865860	9868020	You were, a guard shoved me out.
9868020	9871020	I got bullied.
9871020	9874020	Yes all your flooring- oh how dear you.
9874020	9875860	A guard attacked me, how am I alive?
9875860	9877940	Did the mission just reset?
9878900	9886580	Right I can see that I've got three sassan signals so this is gonna make things a heck of a lot of you.
9890660	9894420	I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins
9894420	9897220	and I have chocolate covered raisins and I'm sorry I had.
9901620	9902980	They just pushed me out I guess.
9903540	9906660	Make an exception for her.
9911540	9912420	Right I...
9916180	9918580	Oh am I allowed to be detected at this stage?
9918580	9924580	Do not be detected while escorting the senator so I'm not escorting just yet.
9924580	9929300	I know I said that wrong so I repeated it to seem like I said on purpose but the truth is I didn't.
9933940	9936500	I like how the senator couldn't like perfectly see through it.
9936500	9940820	By the way sorry I just noticed a mean tag in the reply under your schedule that Cephalophogre is that correct?
9942020	9943060	Have I spelled it wrong?
9945620	9947220	I probably spelled it wrong then.
9949060	9953860	This is what you guys need to tell me what to do because I don't know what the heck I'm doing.
9955460	9959220	Friends these days unfortunately I'm not one of them.
9960980	9962180	Cephalophogre!
9962740	9964740	He fights the guards and gives away money.
9971220	9974740	So honey someone on Twitter made a VTuber fruit tier list and they fit you in impressive.
9975700	9977540	Oh yeah they like my fringe tipped.
9980100	9981860	Hold on I'm taking a sipping to Nicola.
9981860	9983220	Did you guys get up and start to leave?
9985540	9986420	I'm so sorry.
9987300	9990260	I don't know what's going on with my tum tum I'm having to take more pain killers
9990260	9994020	but I'm having them with food so it's not going to hurt me.
9994900	9996820	I promise it's not going to hurt.
10002420	10004580	Cephalophogre honestly.
10013620	10014820	Oh burp warning.
10015060	10020980	I burp a lot when I eat so please brace yourself if you're not uh
10021780	10026020	not that you're not into burping but I understand that some people being rude that burping is very
10027140	10028100	rude but I
10031060	10032260	Oh I liked her scream.
10037060	10041620	Okay in order if you look away your assassin recruits will despawn faster
10042580	10045380	and then they'll re like start reloading quicker.
10048020	10048820	Did you see the art?
10052660	10058020	I've been locked out of my Twitter and I keep getting locked out of it to the point where
10058020	10062340	it's inaccessible and it keeps telling me to do these like stupid capture thing
10063940	10066020	and it keeps saying um
10066900	10067400	um
10069300	10069800	no
10070980	10071480	well
10072420	10080340	I did not see them at all and so it says like verification complete you're human
10080340	10086980	and then it says error submitting and I can't do anything I don't know what I want me to do
10086980	10095380	um so I've been locked out of my alt one I've not had a chance to check out my
10095380	10099940	current one it's the music's a load of my ears sorry I need to hear my headset then
10099940	10104340	then you turn the games on or is it just being a bit dramatic at this stage
10104340	10107540	on the appropriate width of women's league
10107540	10112180	not you you raise money for false causes to pay back the gambling debts
10112180	10115060	they're gang violence and I'm right now barfy a smart win
10116100	10119700	um am I allowed to confess I've already recorded it
10119860	10124260	this is the most significant I sat in my recording this for 15 minutes
10124820	10130340	I had one bottle of water and one can of cola and I fell ill after recording it
10131220	10138980	but I already recorded it I'm so sorry if it's not your thing but I it's the truth I already
10138980	10147940	recorded it I thought it was funny but I don't really have manners so I was raised in a bar
10150660	10158660	I've just gone oh management unlocked my alternative twitter okay I'll go I'll look after
10158660	10163860	stream and then I'll see what I've missed because I think it's very possible I've missed a lot of
10163860	10172500	fan arts or clips oh someone clipped me plain assassin's creed and someone clipped me um
10172580	10179860	um when me and the horse were beating up the captain um I was like giggling my little butt off
10179860	10187780	at the club it was so good I'm going to tweet it out um because like it was just so funny um
10187780	10191380	and like I really appreciate anyone that clips me because like clipping takes so much time
10192420	10196580	how long will the audio be I think it's roughly 15 minutes after editing because
10197300	10204020	um I'm doing a lot of what I call live ASMR where like I don't edit out all my mistakes and stuff
10204020	10210100	like I know this sounds a bit funny saying it like that but um
10214820	10222500	uh sorry um what was the same word of gone I'm sorry my brain's too small to think and talk
10222980	10229220	at the same time oh yeah live ASMR um I've really been enjoying doing it instead of like the super
10229220	10234900	hyper edited approach like if like I make a bump then I just lower the volume so it's still
10234900	10242740	acceptable for ASMR and like if not like at one point my cat um came in my recording booth and
10242740	10248820	I was like do you want to do ASMR with me and my baby boy was like so I'm just like going to leave
10248900	10257940	it in because it's just so precious and I really like it um like I've really enjoyed doing like
10257940	10266420	live ASMR instead of like try hard even more um like I've done like non-scripted ones as well
10266420	10277060	where I'm rambling out my butt like so much um if it's not scripted my ramble ASMR is ridiculous
10277060	10281460	like it's not even ASMR honestly like it's just me like goofing off talking about whatever I like
10282100	10291860	um whoa whoa I've accidentally hired this group when I'm how is the senator under attack
10293780	10296420	I don't even know he's under attack there's no one that patrols that way
10298260	10304740	as long as I don't get discovered I could me and yeah what happened we're addicted to the yapping
10304740	10308500	where can I hear the ASMR it'll just be on youtube I do need to edit it I've got a few
10308500	10315140	things first before I start doing my uh 1000 subscriber thank you ASMR's um like I've got
10315140	10319780	a few collabs that I need to focus on first like I really whoa whoa whoa why did all of that

10776500	10783380	I kind of plan to do like one endurance game stream a week so next week is Skyrim for endurance
10784580	10792500	then we have Elden Ring for two weeks in a row after that so I'm playing the DLC with you guys
10792500	10798420	first and then I'm playing multiplayer with sin sister um
10801540	10808820	and we also have shot callers and heart rate winners and all that jazz um thankfully sin sister
10808820	10816180	is an endurance streamer so like if you ever get annoyed like uh I hate it like when streamers like
10816180	10822420	don't finish a game I don't like either which is why I would love to get endurance streamers first
10822980	10828740	borderlands too I would love to do a vtuber playthrough like you know the vtuber's the problem is
10830180	10836740	if people aren't endurance streamers that's like oh so long whereas if you can find an
10836740	10842900	endurance it takes maybe three streams max if you want to just blast through the campaign maybe even two
10842900	10844900	honestly
10852500	10863220	I'm sucking my fingers I don't know why my tongue's coming out oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue
10866980	10870660	that's so cool I love this I don't know if I've ever been
10871380	10875700	borderlands too is like a hoot in a hole or it's like a fun game honestly
10876420	10886900	oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow while I do this yes I will look at Marshmallow that's so silly
10893300	10898500	oh my goodness I have a hundred more questions than I did yesterday oops
10899220	10905780	any chance there'll be a full body pillow for sale in the future yes um
10906980	10912980	ubu market are like absolutely amazing to work with and they were like whenever a girl has a
10912980	10919060	birthday please tell us and we're happy to do like a new thing for you um so the more support like
10919060	10925460	they get on ubu market right now the more favor we have to like produce something new so for the

10936660	10943860	mascots in a plushie now I don't know if the designs for the mascots might be a bit advanced
10943860	10952340	um or they would come out quite expensive that's the only um issue hi good to hear you yeah it's
10952340	10957860	good to be heard didn't it um maybe a hundred percent open to any merch uh we are going to
10957860	10964100	establish ourselves first and then I'm gonna reach out to a very unique merchandise line
10964100	10968420	because I have no idea how to bridge a connection between that but I'll give it a shot you know
10968420	10973780	you can only do but ask if you do not ask you do not receive so I will ask I will see if it's possible
10974340	10982740	if it's not possible then we tried um would it be uh I'm not going to let you know what those
10982740	10990020	type of mousepad designs will be for the others I know what mine is my big badonk adonk I take
10990020	10999300	a bite of my muffin I'm just hi strongy I really like the Assassin's Creed streams wanted to give
10999300	11004580	you uh feedback that I've tipped in the stream elements paid around five times now between
11004580	11012580	the two streams but it never came up oh no wait wait wait wait wait why would it not come up
11015540	11026100	why would you get filtered I don't it was broken before it's fixed now but why would it not show up
11026500	11037380	I have bejinga narrow tiny spiny and bejinga again for today it broke yesterday please tell me if
11037380	11043940	your money didn't go through or did go through the PayPal was broken because you guys gave us
11043940	11050500	so much money you broke the cricket PayPal but it's unbroken that's what's fun it is a legal
11050500	11060660	requirement of all reeflings to love strong stuff um I also was thinking I need to find an artist to
11060660	11068980	do this one that's good with all body types I would love for our six month anniversary to have a mouse
11068980	11076260	pad of all of us together like one of those big flat mouse pads I would adore to have us all together
11076260	11079620	absolutely adore it
11082180	11086500	but I would need to get like a really good artist for that like I would not want to waste money
11087460	11091460	dicking around with artists like I would want an artist to like fucking smoke it
11094580	11102020	I know I adore it okay um since there's a notification discord server would it be possible
11102020	11108740	for you to upload the unarchive stuff the discord like a thread and unarchive stuff do you mean
11108740	11117300	like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream that went kaput um I think because we like can't we shouldn't
11117300	11123460	really host it because I got taken off so I don't want to like be the ones responsible if that makes
11123460	11130980	sense like archive annons shout out to archive annons like for saving everyone's butts I for me
11130980	11134420	I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion please you're more than welcome to
11134420	11139700	give me your opinion again and marshmallow but archive annons if a broke don't fix it
11139700	11145060	they've been doing fantastic they've been catching um what's been put out there and yeah
11146020	11147140	hmm
11157620	11164660	our alternative stream is going to be free to access yes I do not personally believe in paying more
11164660	11171380	than like 10 us dollars to like fully support your oh she and get everything that they put out
11171460	11176260	there and the girls have shown an interest in playing alternative games and doing some other
11176260	11185220	stuff um but I would not like them to charge for it I'm going to say to them like let's not charge
11185220	11189620	but obviously I will never hold you back from giving any tips to the girls
11191060	11194740	and you can always tip as a thank you to content that you enjoy
11195460	11205060	but that's just me um like someone said um do I plan on raising the prices of what's been
11205060	11211860	established no I don't I think I think 10 us dollars per month for all the content that the
11211860	11220500	girls put out is fair and I think it's good value for money and I think it also shows that
11220660	11227860	uh like the end goal isn't great and again like 8 20 split comes into it type thing um
11227860	11231620	and it goes up in their favor next year type stuff if they want to hang about like
11233140	11242980	I think if it's more than 10 us dollars you're you're not taking the piss but I very much push
11242980	11253060	for value for money and I hope I know region doesn't always change the price of membership
11253060	11260500	regionally which is obviously a big thing that's hard to overcome because we don't set the like we
11260500	11267380	set the price but if the website doesn't do an alternative payment style then you're like you're
11267380	11272980	getting shafted in other countries like there is a streamer that talked about selling games and
11273780	11279380	it was like oh brazil because they lowered the price in brazil like it was fine and all that
11279380	11288580	jazz i'm sorry i'm rambling i'm not making any sense um by the way cuddles i sometimes make a
11288580	11298340	lot of clips as you probably remember from back then are you goober we may be goober i'm happy for
11298340	11304900	you to use my clips with whatever you want whenever but i would prefer to keep the clips of you as
11304900	11311540	gay can't is possible and i only share those with the reeflings really uh and i posted group clips
11311540	11317300	with the other girls i'm happy for the clips of the other girls in the group collab to be used to
11317300	11320980	monetize and shoot oh that's so nice of you whatever you want not like it really matters what my
11320980	11327140	opinion is yes it does you mean that you goober um and i would like to keep comfy streams to you
11327140	11331700	as long as possible while you go naturally and share well i've got good news for you
11334260	11338660	the nature of my content gate creeps me automatically do you want to hear why a little
11339460	11347940	my goal of a ASMR video every time i get like 1000 subscribers the reason why that naturally gate
11347940	11352820	keeps me is because someone will come into the livestream after consuming that content and they'll
11352820	11359220	go when ASMR when ASMR stream and then when they see me rambling my head off about a 14 year old
11359220	11365540	game having the time of my life they're gonna get bored aren't they they're only here for ASMR
11365860	11377220	five heads i'm playing chess in 4d already i already did it myself they're weak they can't
11377220	11383860	handle the strongy they want the they want the strong ASMR whisper in you they can't handle
11383860	11391380	the ramble and they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the so by default i naturally
11391380	11395300	get keep myself you're welcome love you reeflings always had you in mind
11398100	11400660	only the strongest reefling can survive
11404660	11410020	first time doing this listen to your audio through oh wait i don't think i can read this one out loud
11410900	11414340	it's a video link oh i'm gonna watch that after stream
11415460	11420900	hey i did forgot a scottish game show show them the name of places in scotland an asset pronounce

11428500	11434580	they tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent i just sound like a bagpipes
11436340	11440180	i can't handle the scottish ramble also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other

11449220	11453140	there is no way you're telling me like it's gonna keep continuing because this is getting
11453140	11460020	outrageous now like i'm not laughing no one's hee-hawing strawney it's not fair you give the

11545700	11553060	doors waiting on you all right
11556820	11561940	sup oh i'm gonna choke sup less i feel they need to say something after that brotherhood part
11561940	11568660	one stream what are you talking about why you don't think you could be considered or oh she
11568660	11573220	why because they're creators that they were more experienced who you think are better so clearly
11573300	11578980	would prepare them have you not followed have we not followed and supported you for a while heck
11578980	11586740	i've been listening laughing relaxing sagging and straight jorgen has pentas for many a time now
11586740	11591540	what do you why do you think that is could it mean we adored the silly scottish gremlin who's not
11591540	11596500	afraid to be herself and treat her with love and respect no last kick that impossible shame
11596500	11603540	syndrome to the curve we love you oh you're oh she case closed doofus oh thank you evening i love
11603540	11614180	you replay is that a bag of chips no it's a bowl i'm like the p-snacks are really hard i can
11614180	11627300	like dink them on the bowl without them cracking oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about
11627300	11633940	on the other stream but i forgot oh my god right hopefully i don't forget this time there's a really
11633940	11643380	brave refling who messaged me well he's not a reflin but he's asked for helps reflings okay
11645140	11650900	i i'm going to paraphrase it because i can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but
11653140	11661940	basically this person is struggling to brush their teeth and i think it would be very nice
11661940	11666740	if we brush our teeth together after stream like when streams ending will brush our teeth
11666740	11673620	together i know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and i think it would be
11673620	11679460	nice reflings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that so if you would
11679460	11684340	like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream i will give a roughly 30 minute warning
11685220	11690900	so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad for your enamel to brush
11690900	11696980	and i think it can be a really nice thing we reflins can do for someone even even if together
11696980	11703860	we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have helped that person who
11703860	11710020	was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come out with um i won't say too much
11710020	11718580	about it but um you know you were very straightforward and said that um you don't you know consider yourself
11718660	11727700	a refling and that's okay um and you know we can't promise that we we can help everyone but we
11727700	11733540	would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something nice together and it's a lot easier when
11733540	11739460	you do something together with someone so uh yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out
11739460	11743300	i would like to brush my teeth with you when i end stream i don't know if you're out there
11743700	11746420	but uh we can definitely do that together yes it's
11748340	11749620	i see no problem yeah

11812420	11816420	like these fake things you put on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look

11823060	11829140	i've never seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah i do understand for people that do need

11863220	11869860	weakness you and the girls but i feel much more lonely than i did before oh watching everyone interact
11869860	11875620	with each other the girls respond into mario's maro's and such i don't even know why i suppose i'm
11875620	11881300	just envious of the attention that everyone's getting i feel so out of place i'm so sad i haven't
11881300	11886740	even been able to listen to your audios to sleep i'm sorry for being selfish it's not selfish at all
11888020	11891540	are you are you maybe one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything
11893300	11899380	or have i managed to successfully accidentally dodge all your messages and stream and i would
11899380	11905060	be a bit upset too if you were talking away and i accidentally never read out any of your messages
11905060	11910420	so i do apologize if that happens and well i'm sorry for a little reflame i never want to make
11910420	11918020	you feel lonely if you are a lurker and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your
11918020	11923540	comfort level is you're allowed to be that uh you can always say you can always be at arm's length
11923540	11932420	or you can always be attached at my head you can sit on my head if you like um and it's okay
11933940	11937620	but just i don't know hopefully it doesn't make you feel lonely like
11937620	11942740	oh by then i get to show you my childhood game you guys get to show me you get to suggest to me
11942740	11950100	your childhood game i want to sit on stroney's head yeah lurkers are beloved yes i understand
11950100	11956660	for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve-wracking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and
11956660	11964180	like i i read out what you're saying stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my
11964180	11969060	autistic diagnosis please refer to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only
11969060	11975700	reason i went off instead of 14 hours of full gameplay is because of bod okay i'm usually playing
11975700	11980820	something and lurking yeah like it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with
11980820	11987860	lurking absolutely not um don't be shy reflame stroney isn't always reading my comments but yeah
11988580	11997220	it's um a gooberino so i do apologize if i've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully
11997220	12005220	it doesn't happen in the future um i can only apologize uh sometimes hi stroney want you to
12005220	12010500	know what i think it's very cute when you narrowed out about sasa's group brotherhood well i'm getting
12010580	12013860	rolled in the dlcs clearly i'm not built for the dlc
12018020	12023300	i have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice i lurk when i'm at work um yeah a lot of people
12023300	12030740	like lurking and listening to stroney podcast wait if you don't see the screen when i'm streaming
12030740	12038500	and like i'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us oh take this oh like are you like oh what's
12038500	12044500	going on or can you use context clues i like to have the stream on in the background but i do like
12044500	12048980	to interact i'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact i know some people shy like
12048980	12056980	that hi coddles just wondering if you could forward something to management i know vealer or not on
12056980	12065540	holodex but you can still view the stream of the url but i think the girls have something set that
12065620	12069540	prevents their streams from being viewed through third-party sites well mine is fame
12070580	12078500	i can't be right people is true screen off pretending stroney is physically
12078500	12085220	throwing the refill and then around for sport um to be honest you talk enough that there isn't
12085220	12091460	dead air so i don't have to wonder about what's going on yeah i can't believe it wait was there
12091460	12096900	really no dead air in the last stream i must have been quiet at some sections there's no way
12097700	12102180	i had the video playing i just can't fully watch the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long
12102180	12109140	for the average adult uh okay management's gonna look into holodex i think that puts all their
12109140	12114020	streams together we were thinking about hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules
12114020	12118340	but it cost like more money and it was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it
12118340	12124180	for free we're just gonna let holodex take over who goes there i died for yourself there was almost
12124180	12131140	no dead air outside of breaks and they wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after i've been
12131140	12139620	done with you i watched for about five hours and wasn't it okay you talked the entire time i do i'm
12139620	12144900	very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if i missed it but what are we
12145540	12148900	yes your reeflings i was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you
12150980	12158820	i've lost some gnar twerk of a nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out
12158820	12164900	who i follow on strawnycuddles on twitter i don't use twitter much you're much better given a like
12164900	12171700	and a subscribe to this youtube channel i am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush i use twitter
12171700	12177940	now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar hey sweet
12177940	12187700	cakes want to make a samar basically so i do i think your longest dead air was the sprint
12187700	12194260	section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like monomogged
12194260	12199620	because i'm just that good at being a yap or hey strawny loving the assassin's creed i was
12199620	12206260	wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two i haven't there are fun games
12206260	12210020	that i think you may like even if you don't play them i still appreciate you for beating
12210020	12216100	this message i have not i've never heard of them or i can't remember them being on the cover of
12216100	12227700	an xbox 360 so probably not have i ever played dragon age i played the demo of dragon age one
12228340	12234820	i think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if i
12234820	12241060	remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age i've done i don't know what it's like um
12242420	12250900	but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well am i flamboyant
12250900	12254660	because of my watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and i'm like
12254660	12260340	honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay
12263380	12268020	congratulations on your debut i'm looking forward to supporting all of the talents i must
12268020	12274020	apologize i said that's so wrong i must apologize but i find myself confused what you meant by
12274020	12279940	vealers collab restrictions and i'm looking forward to clarification you describe the
12279940	12287140	collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me
12287940	12295540	my collab restrictions are um i'm like if i don't know that someone is like me mentally then i can't
12295540	12299220	stream with them because i'm dumb i can stream with the girls though that's fine and the girls can
12299220	12307140	stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with males or interact
12307140	12316820	with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good literally none of
12316820	12325300	the girls have broken that rule scrawny slaps of each of us behind i can make you a star yeah um
12327380	12331300	it seems odd for me for them to be rules i've never heard of any other agency that has an
12331300	12339060	outright rule against them against who sorry i'm not read this properly uh especially value
12339060	12347060	and freedom doesn't it apologize if it comes off with really critical however i think clarification
12347060	12355940	were an issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want oh this is asking about male collabs
12355940	12364660	the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed would the girls be able to do that
12366740	12374820	i mean i would never stop them from an opportunity like would they be on the same team as a guy like
12374820	12380500	i don't think i don't think that's like advised if it was like that like i wouldn't advise it
12381220	12386820	however none of the girls have given me an indication to ever even do that like i think
12386820	12394020	we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are uh following japanese idol culture
12394020	12401460	and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here which is terrible don't say that i love don't
12401460	12411780	say that part of it keep burping don't apologize oh yeah oh yeah hello again friend of a friend
12411780	12426180	i knew you well the truth is just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on
12427060	12430900	i don't remember the words pick it up every time
12440020	12445060	hi stroney i think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not
12445060	12453220	too much oh no so the way i i've been taught v tripper culture i'm so sorry but i've been taught
12453220	12460500	by the majority v tripper culture i'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know or
12462260	12470500	membership however because and the reason why i can't do it when it's like just saying hi section
12470500	12477540	or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and i really
12477540	12485220	don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me
12487380	12491620	we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um uh at the start of the ASMR
12491620	12497380	stream i am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do
12497380	12502180	you feel that you're no longer a v-tweeter well hopefully my first stream length really showed
12502180	12510740	how much i enjoy video being so up cuddles was thinking of a tag oh i missed the tag i kind of
12510740	12520420	finished them oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um i'm currently
12520420	12527540	getting a new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because
12527540	12531780	he can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because i can only guess what you want
12531940	12539460	to hear and so much um so like roughly the first three months of scripts are me and then it goes
12539460	12545540	to other script writers and then it goes to the script manager but we're testing script manager
12545540	12551060	but if all goes well my responsibilities lessen so much and i can stream so much more
12554580	12559780	well at the start of the stream you were 3.5k now you're at 3.3 heck yeah that means i don't
12559780	12564100	have to edit the 4k thousand anytime soon that's fine
12572500	12577300	hey i have to say that i think you amazing i don't get to interact with many scottish people online
12577300	12583940	that's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my scottish life to become a v-tweeter that's why
12583940	12589860	there's no scottish v-tubers do you know how i know i've hurt myself my finger is bleeding why
12589860	12596660	what did i cut myself on i've not touched anything sharp is there anything sharp in this room
12598260	12601620	ouch it stings hopefully i can still keep gaming
12602740	12607700	scotland only has one computer yeah yeah no like genuinely there's a reason why there's not a lot
12607700	12616100	of scottish v-tubers is if you genuinely like grew up around well like grew up around like normal
12616100	12622100	friends uh you would genuinely be like bullied so hard like bully culture like in america and
12622100	12628420	australia and the uk is so prevalent like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly different
12628420	12635780	from the status quo you get sicked on like a like a hound like sick um it's crazy pour some
12635780	12642340	zura milk on it honestly i don't know i can't remember how i cut myself my wee fingy i'm okay though
12646820	12652340	someone says hi stroney i missed all of your livestreams rip but i do have a few questions
12652340	12657620	what happens if one of the girls wants to leave they uh they leave question mark
12658740	12662820	they get to go we don't have a non-compete uh i don't believe in them i don't think they're nice
12662820	12667780	they are not kind if you no longer work for the vealer agency why would we prevent you from
12667780	12675700	making money elsewhere that is uh called being uh messed up will you retire the character yeah
12677140	12683300	also if you can work the plans for gen two will you bring in six new girls and retire the other
12683300	12687780	what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what
12689060	12695780	if gen two is the thing there will be six new girls on board um so well when feature agencies come
12695780	12701700	out with generations uh everyone can be active at the same time it's not a problem so generation one
12701700	12706500	all six active generation two all six active so that would be 12 total then if generation three
12706500	12711780	and everyone's happy with their cuts and things are all nice and swimmingly and then generation
12711780	12720260	three and there will be a total of 18 succubi and v-sucky wow i really that's very daunting to
12720260	12726340	think of but thank god i'm not the script master anymore because if i was a script master i could
12726340	12735300	not stream i genuinely could not stream um there are absolutely no interest for any generations
12735300	12742180	after three no spin-off generations no secret plans no save for work generation
12743140	12750420	none of that i and i am exhausted i took insane amounts of hp damage getting gen one out
12751220	12759860	i am ill i want to get myself better and i'm going to stream and i'm going to enjoy every second of
12759860	12768900	it um but yeah we we uh we are not having to retire gen one to get gen two out no um sorry
12770740	12774580	lastly and this may be taboo to ask and if you don't i'll read it in my head
12778580	12781460	that is controversial it's not controversial
12781700	12787780	and what's an item you would copy and steal from the other girls
12791540	12796820	shibis no i will be taking no further questions and why is everything in japanese are are you
12796820	12806260	weep nothing's in japanese actually this is a fully english stream there's nothing in japanese

13856340	13860420	to the fuel stack because i don't want to get in any trouble
13860420	13873220	i think we just got 50% DNA so i think we might actually have
13878900	13885940	i think we might actually have a new pristine memory unlock if it's 25 percent then 50 then 75
13886500	13890020	that reason said then should we help
13896100	13897380	i can't protect him
13900820	13906180	speaking of smoking before to my friend lu you want to smoke go for it no nothing for me to say
13906580	13918900	i'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now i think we're okay with the render
13918900	13926980	difference i have no idea what we're missing and not done yet we're replaying easy missions that
13926980	13932260	i failed in order to get higher dna sequence christina's story doesn't unlock until you have
13932260	13937300	high synchronicity so i'm having to go back and redo missions that like are easy and they'll
13937300	13942100	raise our overall percentage and then we should be able to finish whatever happens with christina
13942100	13947700	because it like ended and it didn't make any sense like at all
13954020	13957140	right okay we're done this part we just need to do the benchmark night
13957220	13964740	how far are you planning on taking vila or dominate no not domination i just want the girls to
13965380	13972660	achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do and um have a good time you know it's kind
13972660	13977220	of like what are vila's dreams vila's dreams or whatever the girls dreams are because we want

13990420	13996820	but yeah like uh alcohol and me don't go well um it speeds up my heart rate it makes me feel
13996820	14003540	uncomfortable and i get i'm very late wait even though i'm Scottish i'm so freaking late wait it's
14003540	14006500	so annoying i'm stinky like why
14008660	14015780	um so i just can't really handle it i don't do it also there's been like tons of reports that come
14015780	14020260	out where alcohol is really bad but i'm not gonna say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something
14020260	14033380	like that um i kind of learned that um so when you feel a buzz from alcohol you don't have to drink
14033380	14038100	any further than that point to keep the buzz going that's not how alcohol works i only recently
14038100	14046580	learned that back anyway and but like i won't be shy of doing like drunk uh karaoke i'll drink for
14046580	14056020	the both of us honestly there's less of you to fill alcohol with oh please please excuse me i'm

14128180	14135140	lot of drinking culture comes into play in the uk um like the aim when you go out with your friends
14135140	14141860	is to get like plastered which is like just not very pleasant um

14226420	14232740	literally i like i just play video games all day i'm sure it is fun if you're into it but like
14232740	14238740	i just have no interest i have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk

14324900	14327220	very nice because like i completely understand
14331140	14336180	i did it again it makes that noise i think that must be an audio mistake or something because
14340900	14345540	i was studying the hidden bleed i was such an assassin's creed fanboy
14345540	14351380	i used to think it would be so cool if i got like the assassin's creed logo branded on my finger
14352020	14360340	i was so impressionable as a child you're truly a man after my so impressionable not very smart
14360340	14363860	it's kind of character i will get the armor my troops will gather it from the dead
14363860	14369060	what's been streamed tomorrow is a needy streamer overload needy streamer over than that's you
14369060	14374100	it's actually a pretty good tale for me to kill them without a fight the armor has to stay clean
14374100	14379220	next small fish the ac logo in tattoo only refilling assassins allowed inside
14381460	14386260	okay if this is just don't be actually well i am here

14395220	14397060	like the longest way to find anyone
14406580	14410100	that's the good reason that young people can't get tattoos yes i would like to be
14410100	14414340	sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers probably the sega logo on me at one point as well
14414340	14425460	for um for don't get detected for um sonic heroes i always loved it when i was like

14892740	14894580	yeah i can't speak none of that
14894580	14902980	okay i think we just need to go back and forth and not get attacked by anything which is super
14902980	14904980	simple
14913220	14914980	maybe part of a 2.0
14915860	14917220	why is your french so good no
14928100	14933700	i actually don't know any french i'll literally no phrases and i record just hate the same phrases
14934260	14938100	if you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette you say
14939060	14942660	i would like a good ham with
14944740	14945860	i forgot what cheese is
14950420	14953380	well that didn't that didn't work out very well
14957620	14959700	well it sounds good coming from my friend to speak up
14959860	14961380	uh
14967060	14967860	Oh wait that was
14970980	14972420	must have french post word
14972420	14976620	I enter and don't bear in gifts and hope that
14976620	14981820	I can not see offensive of Rima, but did I say
14981820	14985020	call your man back to the max. I will explain that.
14985020	14987020	You better have something good.
14987020	14989820	Hold back!
14989820	14992420	Yeah, that's like, I'm literally just regurgitating.
14992420	14996020	Do I have higher education? That sounds like I have higher education.
14996020	14998020	That answers me.
14998020	15001020	Reason a barn, uneducated in the barn.
15002020	15004020	And became a gamer. Hell yeah.
15008420	15012020	Ray, I'm a bit scared of this one.
15012020	15014020	Don't lose any health squares.
15017020	15020020	I actually don't want to do that one because it takes too long.
15020020	15026020	Ray, we're at 52%. So every time I do a memory, I'm getting like, up to 5%.
15026020	15029020	Use assassin recruits to do your targets.
15029020	15035020	Okay, we're actually, factually going to upgrade our assassin recruits.
15035020	15040020	Which, sorry, I just closed this, but we actually needed to open it.
15040020	15044020	If I do this, they get...
15044020	15047020	Okay, we just need to send them on missions.
15047020	15055020	If we get 5 assassins level 10, the assassin's recruit signal replenishes so much faster.
15055020	15062020	I think it takes off like 20 seconds, which, in the grand scheme of things, adds up so quickly.
15062020	15064020	How much money do I have on my assassins?
15066020	15068020	13k, right, I don't have enough right.
15068020	15070020	We'll just go and do...
15070020	15073020	We'll send them on missions.
15074020	15076020	By the P-jones.
15076020	15078020	Oh, it was like, dead ahead, dead center.
15079020	15082020	I remembered an Italian swear. I'll use anything.
15082020	15084020	Show us your thrones!
15085020	15087020	I didn't even know that.
15087020	15088020	I know, cazzo!
15090020	15092020	Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank?
15093020	15094020	50 smacaroons.
15094020	15097020	Right, we're going to send away our agents.
15097020	15101020	Because I want some of them to level up so then we can get faster.
15104020	15106020	I have no one at 10 yet.
15106020	15108020	What, how are you guys...
15108020	15110020	Oh, you're getting close!
15110020	15112020	Right, I just need to send them away.
15112020	15115020	Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them.
15116020	15118020	And then we can get that...
15121020	15124020	5, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
15124020	15126020	If you guys all go...
15127020	15129020	I think...
15129020	15131020	1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
15131020	15133020	Oh, I don't want to risk the room.
15133020	15138020	If it fails, I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished.
15138020	15141020	If it fails, which is like, pretty unforgiven.
15143020	15144020	Eh...
15144020	15148020	Honestly, your openness and no manners is one of the reasons why I like...
15150020	15152020	That's funny.
15152020	15154020	When I live at Cleveland.
15155020	15156020	Eh...
15156020	15157020	Right.
15157020	15159020	Missions, missions, missions.
15159020	15161020	Wait, they don't have...
15162020	15165020	17 minutes for that mission?
15165020	15167020	Is really not.
15167020	15171020	Is there not another level 5 regular contract?
15173020	15174020	There's no...
15174020	15176020	Oh, these are all level 5s.
15176020	15177020	Okay.
15177020	15179020	All four of you go together.
15180020	15182020	And you're humble, little thing.
15185020	15187020	Alright, as an Italian myself,
15187020	15190020	I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases another...
15190020	15192020	Languages is cringe!
15192020	15194020	Oh, you don't want to hear me say...
15194020	15196020	Spinji, spinji!
15196020	15198020	Aiuto, aiuto!
15198020	15200020	Aius mius!
15200020	15202020	Wait, no, that's Spanish.
15203020	15205020	Alright, we're going to go to a bank.
15215020	15217020	As an Italian myself, please say more Italian words.
15217020	15219020	Ai, ai, ai, aius mius!
15221020	15223020	To say...
15224020	15226020	I don't think I have any Italian words.
15227020	15230020	I'm ready for a little nap after eating almost this little snack.
15230020	15232020	I still have pea snacks left over.
15232020	15234020	I forgot to eat any of my reasons.
15234020	15236020	I'm going to have to put them back in the fridge.
15236020	15238020	I need to buy paintings.
15238020	15240020	Wait, do paintings?
15240020	15242020	Question mark, go to DNA.
15244020	15247020	52, 4, 7.
15247020	15248020	52, 4, 7.
15248020	15249020	52, 4, 7.
15249020	15250020	52, 4, 7.
15250020	15251020	52, 4, 7.
15251020	15252020	52, 4, 7.
15252020	15253020	52, 4, 7.
15253020	15254020	52, 4, 7.
15254020	15255020	52, 4, 7.
15258020	15260020	I just spent all my money on that then.
15260020	15262020	Oh, excuse me, you're in my way.
15273020	15276020	I just need to access the bank over here.
15276020	15279020	I don't mind getting a little wet, why not?
15284020	15286020	That's my favourite food.
15286020	15288020	Chatting, has to be chicken.
15289020	15291020	It's too tasty, I don't know, I just did something.
15291020	15294020	I like savoury foods over sweet foods.
15296020	15298020	Savory is just dab on.
15300020	15302020	Flags, feathers and chest.
15302020	15306020	Do they, do flags go to the percentage?
15306020	15309020	Because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't, is like so...
15310020	15312020	Rough, colonel standards.
15312020	15314020	I can't do that, just do it.
15317020	15318020	Don't be detected.
15318020	15319020	Like, I don't like to...
15321020	15324020	Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.
15325020	15327020	How did I do that?
15328020	15330020	Because they're all attacking you.
15333020	15336020	Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.
15339020	15341020	Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.
15348020	15350020	I have my hand over my mouth thinking.
15350020	15352020	Oh, I don't have any smoke bombs!
15356020	15359020	I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.
15359020	15361020	Fried, oh, fried by far.
15361020	15363020	I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.
15366020	15367020	Yeah, for sure, would you?
15367020	15369020	Like, if you heard Nataline speak your navel image.
15369020	15373020	Sure, it might not be some bad, but you know, the accent can pack a punch.
15384020	15386020	The layers of Romeo, the war machine.
15386020	15387020	The war machine.
15390020	15392020	Wait, do these have a percentage?
15395020	15397020	No, these don't have a percentage.
15404020	15406020	Okay, this is why our thing is so low.
15409020	15413020	Okay, okay, we're gonna do Assassin's contracts, wherever the heck they are.
15413020	15415020	That's why the freaking percentage is so low.
15417020	15421020	These symbols, the pigeon groups?
15422020	15425020	Like, these ones, is it that?
15425020	15427020	Assassin's contract, right, okay, okay.
15428020	15433020	I was gonna say, because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low.
15433020	15436020	There's only a few missions that I haven't done 100% on.
15437020	15442020	I'm gonna be honest, and I don't think we're gonna 100% it,
15442020	15445020	but we definitely finished the game and I'm satisfied.
15446020	15451020	After the stream, we don't need to hop back on Black Ops on Brotherhood.
15455020	15459020	Because I'm satisfied with the playthrough.
15461020	15464020	Because I don't actually have much faith.
15464020	15468020	Okay, so I just need to kind of do all the black markers on the map, really.
15468020	15474020	Maybe factions also, half of it, if I get 100% favor in the factions as well.
15477020	15479020	KFC Yummi, honestly.
15482020	15484020	It's been very cozy.
15484020	15486020	It's more of a cozy day, I think.
15486020	15489020	Yesterday, I used up a lot of my energy on our replay.
15489020	15492020	Just being gushed in about this game and being like,
15492020	15494020	it's getting so cool, it's getting so awesome.
15495020	15497020	Today, it's definitely cozy.
15497020	15500020	It's definitely have a little blanky on you, make sure you're comfy vibes.
15501020	15506020	Yesterday, I was screaming my head off, just loving everything.
15506020	15508020	So energetic.
15508020	15511020	But I get to be like that unapologetically,
15511020	15516020	because nothing's worse than being excited for something,
15516020	15520020	and then someone's like, you're being really loud and obnoxious.
15520020	15521020	They're just like kills.
15521020	15524020	Oh, that's what I mean, I'm having such a good time.
15524020	15527020	You never met someone who's genuinely excited before?
15528020	15534020	Yes, faction challenges are also part of the peer-centered contract.
15534020	15536020	No, not that contract.
15536020	15538020	Mission.
15541020	15544020	Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire
15544020	15547020	who's expected to come and wait and structure the...
15547020	15549020	kill the three targets in two minutes.
15549020	15554020	Oh my god, these have freaking things as well.
15555020	15557020	Oh.
15557020	15562020	Okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA, I think, is so unbelievably low.
15573020	15576020	Oh, he's just out of range and no more.
15578020	15581020	Wait, under three minutes.
15581020	15583020	Three gunmen and under...
15585020	15587020	They're not that far away.
15587020	15590020	Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice,
15590020	15593020	because this guy's not that far away.
15593020	15596020	Oh, that was super reasonable.
15602020	15604020	Oh, I can't reach that.
15609020	15611020	Eh, that quick.
15612020	15614020	Okay, I was like...
15614020	15617020	Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow.
15617020	15619020	Me ankles.
15619020	15621020	I'm out of medicine.
15621020	15623020	Ugh, and smoke worms.
15624020	15627020	Oh, there's a doctor over here, that's perfect.
15635020	15637020	What was out of medicine?
15638020	15642020	See, the thing is, I don't look soldiers' bodies,
15642020	15644020	so I don't get anything from them.
15644020	15647020	Heal me, you should heal myself, no.
15650020	15651020	Sure.
15651020	15653020	Do the feathers count as DNA?
15653020	15655020	Oh, possibly.
15656020	15658020	You don't need ankles.
15658020	15663020	Right, so literally just do the pigeon coops and then it's going up.
15663020	15665020	Oh yeah, 53%.
15665020	15668020	Okay, okay, okay, okay, let him get up, let him get up.
15668020	15670020	53%, how do I go up there?
15671020	15673020	That looks like a hell to me.
15673020	15676020	That looks like a bit of an enslave, a bit of an incline.
15683020	15688020	Eh, I think tomorrow I'm going to save.
15688020	15691020	Which means I need to take a shower.
15691020	15693020	Put deodorant on.
15693020	15697020	I need to pretend I'm a normal person.
15697020	15699020	I'm teasing.
15699020	15701020	I do not stink all the time.
15701020	15703020	Wait, what was 100%?
15703020	15705020	Assassinate three guards with a hidden blade.
15705020	15709020	You do not have to tell me anything more, I assure you.
15709020	15711020	Hidden blade is a way to go.
15717020	15721020	Oh, they're on horsies.
15721020	15723020	I love when they're on horsies.
15723020	15726020	Hello, would you like to die?
15726020	15728020	Okay, hold on, let me try the game.
15728020	15730020	Would you like to die?
15730020	15732020	One.
15732020	15733020	They're all on horses.
15733020	15736020	No wonder the game's like, they're all on horses.
15736020	15739020	How am I supposed to do this?
15739020	15741020	Hello, would you like to die?
15741020	15742020	Hello, would you like to die?
15742020	15743020	No.
15743020	15745020	Yes, wait, I did it.
15745020	15746020	100% already.
15746020	15747020	Skill?
15747020	15748020	Okay, wait, wait, hold on.
15748020	15750020	It's fine, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
15750020	15751020	Let him get up, let him get up.
15751020	15754020	Oh, no, no, no, don't spank the horse.
15754020	15757020	Wait, wait, wait, get him, because he's got a bow.
15757020	15758020	Why does it not...
15758020	15760020	Do I need to like jump up onto the horse?
15763020	15766020	Ow, you're hurting me.
15766020	15767020	Okay.
15767020	15769020	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
15769020	15770020	Let them cook, let them cook.
15770020	15772020	Yes, they got off the horse by automatic.
15774020	15776020	Okay, easy peasy lemon smoothie.
15776020	15777020	You're next.
15777020	15779020	No, you're not.
15779020	15780020	Are you coming?
15780020	15781020	I've lost sight of him.
15781020	15782020	Are you coming?
15782020	15783020	Yes, there, get him.
15783020	15784020	3, 2, 1.
15784020	15785020	Oh, I missed it, I missed it.
15785020	15786020	I missed the timing source.
15788020	15791020	I sniffed for you too late.
15791020	15793020	Well, the weather's nicer for you.
15793020	15794020	It's mild.
15794020	15796020	33 degrees.
15796020	15801020	It's too much for me.
15801020	15802020	I'll pass.
15802020	15805020	Right, I guess we're gonna do Leonardo as well.
15805020	15809020	Oh, right, there's another one.
15809020	15813020	If we do that, the assassin missions seem like super fair.
15813020	15816020	Some of it buys for them right now.
15816020	15821020	And we can generate more money by sending our wee assassins to get more XP.
15821020	15823020	Oh, I'm gonna need a horse for this.
15824020	15826020	I said I'm gonna need a...
15826020	15827020	Wait, I'm blind.
15827020	15829020	I just passed off on the horse.
15829020	15831020	Sorry mate, my apologies.
15836020	15839020	If it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them.
15839020	15841020	Get them out of the way and then...
15841020	15845020	Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like 5.
15845020	15847020	That's pretty good.
15851020	15856020	Actually, I could also use these mercenaries.
15856020	15858020	Well, I can't right now.
15860020	15862020	Hello chat, hello.
15862020	15866020	We're just trying to do what we can.
15866020	15870020	It's very unlikely we're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly.
15870020	15874020	I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table
15874020	15876020	and I'm killing circulation to my leg.
15876020	15877020	I'll just be a second.
15877020	15879020	I don't need to mute so you can...
15879020	15882020	What's that saying that's like, I love...
15882020	15885020	I hate to see you go, but I'd love to watch you leave or something like that.
15892020	15893020	Okay.
15908020	15911020	I'm returned already.
15912020	15915020	I'm gonna have my lovely blanket to protect my leg
15915020	15919020	because my circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table.
15919020	15921020	They ain't sitting on my feet.
15921020	15923020	I'm cutting the circulation out of my leg.
15928020	15931020	All right, my chair is like so quicky.
15935020	15937020	Right, have we got any level 10?
15937020	15940020	No, we don't. It was a smaller mission.
15944020	15946020	I screenshot that.
15949020	15951020	That's an interesting scene.
15952020	15955020	I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave.
15955020	15960020	So the thing looks right, but I don't think there's a soul here.
15960020	15964020	I'm just gonna keep sending people away to do more.
15964020	15966020	Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb.
15966020	15970020	I was supposed to accept a assassination contract.
15970020	15972020	Missions.
15974020	15975020	Choose company.
15975020	15977020	Kill both targets for your hidden belief.
15977020	15980020	You do not have to tell me twice.
15980020	15983020	I'm loving these assassin missions.
15983020	15985020	Are you joking me?
15987020	15990020	I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them.
15992020	15994020	Where are we getting pretty far?
15997020	16000020	I can't tell which one's closer.
16002020	16004020	Eh, where is this?
16005020	16007020	Oh wow, they're like...
16009020	16011020	Let's do that.
16012020	16015020	By Austria and Switzerland, it's 26 right now.
16019020	16022020	Literally, the assassin missions are so easy.
16022020	16027020	We may be 57% once by the time we finish them.
16027020	16030020	If they make them this easy, then...
16035020	16039020	If you die, your assassin role before promoting them at max,
16039020	16042020	their cape match will be that colour.
16042020	16044020	I have no sense of colour.
16046020	16048020	Wait, that...
16049020	16051020	Assassin contracts are so easy!
16051020	16053020	I love it here!
16053020	16054020	What the heck?
16054020	16059020	Don't be detected and there's 18 billion guards looking at you.
16059020	16061020	Shout out to assassin contracts.
16061020	16063020	Hello?
16063020	16066020	I can't believe how easy these are!
16069020	16071020	Excuse me, Mr. Horsey.
16071020	16073020	Yet, in Maui.
16073020	16075020	6 and 8% finish.
16075020	16077020	Is that where we'll end on 6 and 8%?
16077020	16080020	I'll give the Leonardo missions a go.
16085020	16089020	It would be nice if 100%, but my goodness, I didn't know.
16090020	16093020	I'll see what happens by the end of this stream.
16093020	16096020	I thought I was only going to do 6 hours today.
16096020	16097020	Hi.
16097020	16098020	I'm sorry.
16098020	16099020	Bye.
16099020	16101020	It was nice meeting you.
16103020	16105020	What percentage are we on?
16105020	16106020	54?
16107020	16108020	55!
16108020	16109020	I love it here!
16109020	16110020	It says 55.
16110020	16112020	Oh my god, more contact please.
16112020	16113020	They're so easy.
16113020	16115020	Is there any more?
16116020	16120020	No, but there's Templar Agents.
16120020	16122020	Okay, we're going to do Templar Agents.
16122020	16127020	I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky.
16132020	16134020	Last Christina needs 75%.
16134020	16136020	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
16136020	16137020	We're going to do that.
16137020	16138020	We're going to do it.
16138020	16144020	I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like, we'll do what we can.
16144020	16149020	I actually don't know how long we're going to stream today.
16149020	16157020	As I said, I was only planning on doing 6 hours-ish, but I mean, we're already getting close to that mark.
16159020	16165020	It's already been 4 hours and a half, and I'm like, I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now for stream.
16165020	16174020	Especially tomorrow, depending on how much I like the game, it might only be a tour stream, which is a bit meh.
16176020	16178020	I believe in a thing called love.
16178020	16180020	Just listen to the rhythm of your heart.
16180020	16194020	Yeah, literally, it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go-
16194020	16196020	Oh wait, the bank, I can collect money from it.
16200020	16202020	Oh no, I've already collected my money.
16203020	16217020	I suppose once we buy the last, how do you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall.
16220020	16223020	I'm trying to do the faction challenges on the way there.
16223020	16228020	Yeah, I need to hire thieves to lure people away.
16228020	16231020	You need to do it 10 times to their question.
16232020	16235020	I just need to find enemies.
16240020	16241020	Yeah, just like that.
16244020	16246020	We need to complete Christina!
16246020	16247020	Literally.
16248020	16250020	Right, what's this? Hi!
16250020	16251020	Are you a kitty?
16251020	16253020	Oh, it's not looking good.
16255020	16256020	She's beating up!
16261020	16263020	I will not touch you. What happened here?
16263020	16269020	Auguste, my beloved husband, he owns this neighborhood.
16269020	16271020	That Borgia have given it to him.
16271020	16279020	He once made signs for the shop's nudistic, but now he post lies for the Borgia and hurts those who stand in his way.
16279020	16282020	Like you, where is he?
16282020	16287020	He spends his days locked in his workshop, but I may know how to go them out.
16287020	16289020	What are we doing?
16289020	16290020	Kill your target with the hidden bl-
16290020	16293020	I love these missions, what the heck?
16295020	16296020	Aw, that's so easy.
16296020	16298020	Yesterday you said 8 hours and then end up being 12.
16298020	16300020	It would have been 14.
16301020	16304020	I don't know, maybe one day they'll fix the VOD issue.
16304020	16314020	If the day comes where they fix that VOD issue, please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule.
16314020	16320020	I'm talking, we wake up, we brush our teeth, we get our food, and then we stream.
16320020	16322020	14 hours, put a vidyag in.
16322020	16324020	Wait, what am I supposed to do?
16326020	16327020	What?
16327020	16328020	Him!
16330020	16332020	Wait, it's the doctor? What am I supposed to do?
16332020	16334020	Oh no, it's the sign!
16335020	16336020	Interact.
16337020	16341020	Oh, we're pulling down propaganda, my apologies.
16341020	16343020	I didn't know.
16345020	16347020	Can you at least reserve the weekends, yeah?
16347020	16349020	Aw, you needing a break from my stamina?
16349020	16351020	You're so adorable, refling.
16351020	16353020	There's no breaks on this tree.
16354020	16356020	I was gonna say something else there, right?
16356020	16358020	I was really bad shouldn't have fallen out.
16358020	16360020	I'm not even naughty.
16361020	16365020	Alright, we're pulling down propaganda, it's useless posters.
16366020	16369020	Sleep is already ruined, what's a lot more ruined?
16369020	16370020	Choo choo.
16372020	16374020	Japanese man drained me.
16377020	16379020	I like them trying to do this.
16380020	16387020	Obviously they did the poster grabbing thing when you got no variety, but I didn't realise they reused it.
16387020	16391020	I quite like the concept, because obviously whenever you think of the past, you're like,
16391020	16394020	how did all these people even get caught for crimes?
16394020	16396020	It just seems so...
16397020	16400020	Kill your target within a move.
16401020	16404020	Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me?
16404020	16407020	Okay, that's exactly odd-up smoke bombs.
16410020	16412020	I'll just do that then.
16412020	16413020	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
16413020	16414020	I wasn't even...
16414020	16416020	Yeah, see that's what I get annoyed with.
16416020	16419020	If you don't enter combat before they whack you, you can't counter.
16419020	16422020	And I literally can't do a boom-boom, but here we go.
16422020	16425020	I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy if I loot him,
16425020	16428020	which I would actually really appreciate in case...
16430020	16431020	Ancient Rome graffiti was here.
16431020	16432020	There was a Pompey.
16432020	16433020	We're at...
16433020	16434020	Oh, yes, he does give me a smoke bomb.
16434020	16435020	That was lucky.
16436020	16438020	I'll definitely try and remember to...
16438020	16439020	Oh, anti-drops!
16439020	16441020	The other guy drops smoke bomb too?
16441020	16442020	I don't know.
16445020	16448020	So when we pull this down, I assume we get to meet the guy,
16448020	16450020	and then we...
16450020	16452020	Oh, we lure him out of his workshop
16452020	16454020	because we've filled all those posters down.
16454020	16455020	Okay.
16456020	16458020	We can definitely do...
16460020	16462020	Other fanbases be looking at refills
16462020	16463020	like a man dying of dehydration.
16463020	16465020	Watch another man drowning!
16465020	16467020	That is so good.
16467020	16468020	What?
16468020	16469020	I predict.
16470020	16472020	I'll friggin' just say I've got Santa Man now.
16474020	16475020	I'm actually...
16475020	16477020	At least he well in this house.
16478020	16480020	I do feel bad when people have a streamer
16480020	16482020	that maybe struggles to stream.
16483020	16485020	I know, I just find that a really good time.
16485020	16486020	A good time!
16488020	16489020	Is that a multiplayer character?
16489020	16490020	It kind of looks like it.
16490020	16491020	It might actually be.
16493020	16494020	If it is,
16494020	16497020	then that's another compliment to the game
16497020	16499020	would be on how they incorporated
16499020	16503020	multiplayer characters into the game campaign.
16504020	16505020	I feel like...
16506020	16508020	Drowning is standing in this house.
16509020	16510020	Wait, did I not say that?
16510020	16512020	Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game?
16512020	16517020	I don't really think so.
16518020	16520020	I think I was aware of it.
16520020	16521020	56%?!
16521020	16522020	Okay, hold on.
16522020	16524020	I'm starting to have hope.
16525020	16527020	I'm starting to have mild hope.
16527020	16529020	I don't want to get anyone's...
16530020	16533020	I don't want to lead to anyone on,
16534020	16537020	but it might be possible.
16537020	16541020	It might be for the 100% run.
16543020	16546020	Because that's going up way faster now that we're...
16546020	16548020	Sorry, I should be riding horse right now.
16550020	16552020	Because literally I was so confused
16552020	16555020	why the percentage was so low.
16555020	16556020	Okay.
16557020	16558020	So let's...
16558020	16560020	Let's see what happens.
16560020	16564020	Let's see, we're at 55% I believe.
16564020	16565020	I've gone the wrong way.
16565020	16566020	Oh, no, not.
16569020	16570020	Oh, I remember this one.
16570020	16571020	That's stupid.
16573020	16575020	You go all the way around in order to...
16575020	16577020	Oh, actually, I'm going to send off a sassan with roots.
16577020	16578020	I need to level them up
16578020	16581020	and we need money, money, money for tourist attractions.
16581020	16582020	Wee!
16584020	16585020	I know, I know.
16586020	16589020	Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the day
16589020	16591020	is a god time for viewers.
16591020	16593020	Yeah, I don't really get burned out.
16593020	16595020	I'm happy to talk about it, but...
16597020	16599020	I just don't seem to experience...
16599020	16601020	So don't get me wrong.
16601020	16605020	I absolutely can have days where I am
16605020	16608020	ready to go to bed,
16608020	16610020	but I wake up on the other side of bed
16610020	16612020	and I'm like,
16612020	16613020	yeah, let's do it.
16613020	16614020	What are we doing?
16614020	16615020	Let's go do this.
16615020	16616020	Let's go do that.
16618020	16621020	Send them off for 200 type thing.
16621020	16623020	But actual burnout,
16623020	16624020	I always wake up the next day
16624020	16626020	wanting to do something more...
16626020	16627020	Oh, there's actually a contract right here.
16627020	16628020	Wee!
16628020	16629020	Is that inside?
16632020	16634020	There's a killing contract inside here.
16634020	16636020	Oh, it's fantasy there!
16637020	16638020	Hello, madam.
16639020	16640020	Madam?
16640020	16641020	Let's talk.
16646020	16648020	Hard part will be the last 5%.
16648020	16649020	Yeah, I agree.
16663020	16666020	What's the hundred percent?
16667020	16670020	New assassin contracts on lot?
16670020	16673020	Say no more, my lady.
16673020	16675020	Say no more.
16677020	16678020	Okay.
16678020	16680020	Let me get up.
16680020	16682020	Okay, we've got more assassin contract,
16682020	16684020	which means the percentage will get even higher
16684020	16686020	very shortly once I do them.
16688020	16690020	Send away my assassins to level up and...
16692020	16693020	Oh, pardon me.
16693020	16694020	Excuse me, come through.
16694020	16696020	My ladies, would you like to distract those?
16699020	16701020	More ladies!
16701020	16703020	Would you like to come...
16704020	16707020	and distract some guards?
16708020	16710020	If there's any guards ahead.
16710020	16711020	Unfortunately, I'm on a horse,
16711020	16713020	so I'm much faster than them.
16713020	16715020	And the horse is stuck on the hill.
16715020	16717020	That's the only thing I don't like about this game.
16718020	16719020	Right.
16719020	16720020	There's no guards,
16720020	16721020	so we're just gonna...
16721020	16723020	We'll be fine, it's okay.
16724020	16725020	Where's this guy?
16725020	16727020	I'm on the wrong side.
16727020	16728020	Hello?
16728020	16729020	Oh, there you are.
16740020	16742020	What are these contracts doing?
16754020	16755020	Merda.
16755020	16757020	He would kill us if we stayed here.
16757020	16760020	Listen, I will run to the next pillar to draw his fire.
16760020	16763020	He's swinging her huge percent in her face.
16763020	16767020	Kill the target using the hidden bleed within 45 seconds.
16768020	16771020	I don't like times, but let's try it.
16773020	16774020	They're so bastard.
16775020	16777020	45 seconds, run, run, run, run, run, run.
16777020	16778020	He's gonna close that.
16778020	16780020	Okay, I can tell.
16782020	16783020	Okay.
16784020	16785020	Okay.
16786020	16788020	45 seconds, hidden bleed.
16788020	16790020	45 seconds, hidden bleed.
16793020	16794020	45 seconds, hidden bleed.
16794020	16795020	45 seconds, hidden bleed.
16796020	16798020	45 seconds, hidden bleed.
16798020	16801020	45 seconds, hidden bleed, hidden bleed, hidden bleed.
16802020	16805020	I love hurting people with a hidden bleed.
16805020	16807020	Okay, we did it.
16810020	16813020	His name is Laquac.
16813020	16818500	What's your take on the best AC game regarding story-wise?
16818500	16821180	Exio's story-wise?
16821180	16823580	Like all of Exio?
16823580	16827880	Uh, like especially Revelations when-
16827880	16829580	Well, why am I under attack?
16829580	16830580	What's going on?
16830580	16831580	Come here, man.
16831580	16834580	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did you even come from?
16834580	16840580	I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing.
16840580	16845300	I saw that, so we'll grab it.
16845300	16847420	I didn't even know where those guys came from.
16847420	16849420	They're no station here, right?
16849420	16850420	Uh...
16850420	16856420	I don't know if I'm going to go longer on.
16856420	16857420	Hmm.
16857420	16859860	You know my favorite part of these?
16859860	16862940	Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters.
16862940	16863940	Yes!
16863940	16864940	Definitely.
16864940	16868380	Okay, we'll go get this assassin contract.
16868380	16873660	We'll kind of just spin around the map again, like how we did when we were renovating everything.
16873660	16875780	Spin around the map.
16875780	16879460	Why is he whispering in Italian to a French?
16879460	16884620	I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in French.
16884620	16885620	Dormez-vous!
16885620	16887620	Dormez-vous, mate!
16887620	16888620	So la-vous!
16888620	16889620	C'est n'est pas la vie?
16889620	16890620	No, no, it's not the life anymore.
16890620	16901340	My French is awful.
16901340	16905380	I get very confused with how these structure, like, words in French.
16905380	16906380	It's pretty...
16906380	16910620	Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial killer and probably
16910620	16911620	the highest killer?
16911620	16912620	Oh, yeah.
16912620	16914660	Actually, who does have the highest kill count?
16914660	16915660	Oh!
16915660	16917780	Don't answer that, actually.
16917780	16918780	Yeah.
16918780	16919780	Not necessary.
16919780	16920780	Thank you.
16920780	16921780	Okay.
16921780	16922780	Hmm.
16922780	16929780	Okay, I'm going to grab this flag right now.
16929780	16936780	Yeah, no, I asked the question and my brain then flashed up the answer and I was like,
16936780	16937780	ah, mm, mm.
16937780	16942780	Okay, we're not doing this.
16942780	16945260	Now we're just memeing along.
16945260	16947660	We're not really talking about each other.
16947660	16953620	I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow, so we're currently in the question
16953620	16958980	mark stage of, is this going to be a 12 hour marathon to 100% the game or not?
16958980	16963660	Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game.
16963660	16965660	Oh, we need...
16965660	16972660	Okay, you guys are like so close to being maxed out, it's crazy.
16972660	16974660	I'm not going to send you away for 20 minutes.
16974660	16978660	So do you like that after doing that?
16978660	16980660	Yes, we do.
16980660	16983660	The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore.
16983660	16984660	More.
16984660	16986660	Do you need like 24?
16986660	16990660	No, you need a bit more XP than that.
16990660	16994660	Got a level 82 XP for you.
16994660	16996660	Yeah, that looks like quick math.
16996660	16999660	That looks good to me.
16999660	17002660	My brain was still explicit in the context.
17002660	17004660	No, no, I don't need me.
17004660	17006660	Oh, I need to accept the contract.
17006660	17012660	Actually, oh, I'm going to send the thieves on this person over here, actually.
17012660	17016660	Actually, factually.
17016660	17020660	As long as you set them on someone, you don't actually have to stick around or anything.
17020660	17024660	I'm going to grab this feather while I'm at it as well, because I'm really close to it.
17024660	17030660	Right, as well.
17030660	17033660	It's also a feather on the Colosseum that you go back for.
17033660	17036660	That's 6 out of 10.
17036660	17038660	Wait, why are you guys still following me?
17038660	17042660	Did you not lure their guards?
17042660	17050660	I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough.
17050660	17053660	Wait, do you only lure away stationary guards?
17053660	17055660	Can't he be?
17055660	17057660	Oh, wow.
17057660	17059660	I did not know that.
17059660	17061660	I thought you could lure anyone.
17061660	17065660	So I have to pick stationary guards?
17065660	17068660	I have not bought the Colosseum.
17068660	17070660	I actually might have enough.
17070660	17074660	Right, there.
17074660	17078660	Right, they're luring him away.
17078660	17082660	I'm going to go and get this nation.
17082660	17083660	Oh, a maestro.
17083660	17086660	I saw that, I saw that.
17086660	17093660	I need five assassins to be maestro and then we'll do some more reblet.
17093660	17096660	You just have to be good at the game.
17096660	17099660	I say you're done.
17099660	17100660	Wait, is this funny?
17100660	17103660	I'm coming for you.
17103660	17109660	Constantinople.
17109660	17111660	Wow, you actually...
17111660	17115660	Right, I'll send them two together because they're not ready yet.
17115660	17119660	No, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract.
17119660	17122660	Hi, hi, hi.
17122660	17124660	Yes, yes, yes.
17124660	17126660	Right, what's the mission assignment?
17126660	17128660	Make a nice and easy peasy.
17128660	17131660	Finish the memory within two minutes.
17131660	17133660	Where am I supposed to go?
17133660	17134660	Do I need to go by horse or not?
17134660	17143660	Yes or no?
17143660	17145660	The thing is, you take...
17145660	17151660	If you just directly sprint...
17151660	17153660	Yeah, see, this is the problem.
17153660	17158660	All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under two minutes.
17158660	17162660	Gallop, please.
17162660	17164660	Yeah, okay.
17164660	17166660	Faster, faster, faster.
17166660	17168660	Yeah, okay, the horse was definitely the better bet.
17168660	17171660	You could not run that.
17171660	17173660	And just says do it in under two minutes.
17173660	17175660	So...
17175660	17177660	Yeah, what are you?
17177660	17179660	They're on horseback.
17179660	17183660	No, that makes fighting so annoying.
17183660	17185660	Oh, sorry, I've got a nitri nose.
17185660	17187660	So if my tracking goes away...
17187660	17189660	It's a running face.
17189660	17191660	Okay.
17191660	17193660	Okay, so glad I took the fricking horse.
17193660	17197660	Holy crap.
17197660	17200660	Okay, that's...
17200660	17203660	It's just so easy.
17203660	17205660	It's just so easy.
17205660	17206660	It's so good.
17206660	17207660	Like, I love these missions.
17207660	17208660	Holy crap.
17208660	17211660	I had no idea how easy they were.
17211660	17212660	Oh, excellent.
17212660	17214660	It's like that.
17214660	17218660	Literally a minute to spare.
17218660	17220660	Let's go, let's go, let's go.
17220660	17222660	Another one.
17222660	17223660	Another one.
17223660	17227660	Oh, do you want to come with me and we'll distract some guards?
17227660	17232660	I should be so close to doing the distraction on...
17232660	17236660	Okay.
17236660	17239660	There's a guard over here.
17239660	17241660	Actually, I need to walk around.
17241660	17244660	I might distract.
17244660	17246660	I didn't do anything.
17246660	17247660	May I ask that?
17247660	17250660	Time to perish.
17250660	17253660	Are you ready?
17253660	17256660	Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe?
17256660	17269660	Yeah, I literally did not know.
17269660	17273660	So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location,
17273660	17280660	you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me.
17280660	17290660	And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge.
17290660	17297660	Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the gold?
17297660	17299660	Parliamentary death squad?
17299660	17302660	Oh, jeez.
17302660	17307660	I'm just here to play video games.
17307660	17316660	I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation is completely out of my knowledge realm.
17316660	17318660	No, I've never played it with monsters.
17318660	17323660	I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development team made it.
17323660	17328660	A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it.
17328660	17340660	I didn't know, because I played on Xbox, that on vanilla Skyrim, because I was on Xbox,
17340660	17346660	that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time.
17346660	17354660	Oh, is it? Am I pooping or is that mud?
17355660	17365660	Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly?
17365660	17371660	I just tried to watch A.G's stream, E.B's stream, but I'm deaf on my left ear,
17371660	17373660	so it went silent for 10 seconds on my right ear.
17373660	17375660	But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know.
17375660	17377660	Oh, bless you.
17377660	17381660	What happened?
17382660	17387660	Were you born like that, or did you get tinnitus?
17387660	17389660	Are they still not done with that fight?
17389660	17394660	Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going to send him on him.
17394660	17396660	Oh, they're still fighting? Come on.
17396660	17403660	It's just one guy in armor.
17403660	17406660	Come on, you can do that. I believe in this.
17406660	17412660	Horses kicking, literally. I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor.
17412660	17417660	Come on, mercenaries.
17417660	17420660	Come on. Yeah, there you go.
17420660	17423660	Right, we're going to send him on this guy now.
17423660	17425660	Thank you, sir.
17432660	17434660	The Guardia?
17434660	17440660	Oh, they're beating that horse up.
17440660	17443660	I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed.
17443660	17448660	All their stuff is weapon-based. They're doing something impressive, a weapon.
17448660	17452660	We're going to say, do you guys need help?
17452660	17455660	Do you guys need help with him?
17455660	17457660	Okay, definitely. Do you need help with him?
17457660	17458660	Yeah, I'm done.
17458660	17463660	Thanks, guys. Glad I hired you.
17470660	17472660	Bought stone, bought things, taken so long.
17472660	17476660	I know.
17476660	17481660	I've almost done sending the mercenaries on people, at least.
17481660	17483660	Is this, like, five, maybe?
17483660	17491660	If they could just perish some a bit faster, you know, we can be there.
17491660	17498660	And they tell him, like, just hooded man on horse since four men to fight.
17498660	17500660	Ten years working around engine rooms.
17500660	17504660	Oh, no, that's, like, the quickest way to lose hearing.
17504660	17506660	It's, like, works like that.
17506660	17508660	Okay, moving up.
17508660	17510660	Fire messages disappeared.
17510660	17512660	Mozi, y'all feeling okay?
17512660	17514660	Am I going crazy?
17514660	17515660	Rubber room.
17515660	17517660	I'm rubber roomed for the rest.
17522660	17523660	Stop.
17523660	17525660	Right, we're almost there.
17525660	17527660	We're almost there.
17531660	17533660	Right, fight him.
17534660	17539660	Fill him off the horse or something.
17547660	17553660	This is going to take forever.
17553660	17556660	Is there, like, another mercenary group right here?
17556660	17557660	Yeah.
17557660	17559660	Okay, can I have you?
17559660	17563660	And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting?
17563660	17564660	Oh, it works!
17564660	17567660	Okay, there, they're completely outnumbered.
17569660	17571660	That must be, what, six now?
17571660	17573660	Only four more to go.
17573660	17575660	I'm born deaf in my left ear.
17575660	17578660	Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on my right side.
17580660	17583660	Okay, now, follow me.
17585660	17587660	So this will be seven?
17588660	17591660	Oh, for goodness sake, that's taking forever.
17594660	17596660	I'll do that, though.
17596660	17600660	Because when you send them, they don't have to win the fight.
17600660	17602660	It's just when you send them on people.
17602660	17604660	Actually, you know what?
17604660	17605660	I'm just checking.
17605660	17606660	I'm just checking.
17606660	17608660	I can't take this anymore.
17608660	17610660	Gale challenges.
17610660	17612660	Mercenary?
17612660	17613660	Nine?
17613660	17614660	Okay.
17615660	17616660	Ugh.
17627660	17629660	That must be done from a certain location.
17629660	17630660	Yeah, double assassination.
17630660	17633660	Three out of ten, I can hardly get it done.
17633660	17635660	Court is on, nine.
17635660	17636660	Oh, guard's poisoned.
17636660	17638660	It's fifteen, so I do need to go poison.
17638660	17640660	There's kind of more guards.
17640660	17642660	I assume if they hate each other down, it doesn't count.
17642660	17643660	Okay.
17643660	17645660	These, honor, honor, and spread.
17645660	17647660	Leaves of faith, I need twenty.
17649660	17651660	Guards are assassinating from me.
17652660	17653660	Okay.
17653660	17654660	Oh, there she is.
17657660	17660660	I just need to find one enemy.
17660660	17661660	Hello.
17661660	17663660	You are enemy.
17663660	17665660	And fight.
17665660	17666660	Okay.
17666660	17667660	Finally.
17667660	17669660	That took so long.
17669660	17671660	Hiring discount earned a little bit.
17674660	17675660	Hello.
17688660	17691660	Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard.
17691660	17692660	Look at that angle.
17692660	17694660	Is that even possible by then?
17694660	17705660	I was really dumb, but, like, before razors were invented, did guys just, like, shape their beard on rocks and stuff?
17705660	17709660	Like, I know that sounds really silly, but did they, like, fashion a rock to be sharp?
17709660	17711660	And then that's how you got rid of your beard?
17711660	17715660	Or did, like, everyone just have beards back in the old days?
17715660	17718660	The razors weren't a thing.
17718660	17720660	Maybe glass?
17720660	17723660	It was a hundred percent.
17723660	17726660	Kill by air assassination.
17726660	17728660	I can absolutely do that.
17729660	17731660	Shave with swords.
17731660	17733660	Not, like, before that kind of effect.
17733660	17736660	What the heck must we do on this stuff?
17738660	17740660	Oh, wow, that's such a good faraway.
17740660	17742660	Um, maybe or something?
17748660	17749660	I'm tired of thieves.
17749660	17754660	They may be able to keep up, if I can do a little way to guard things.
17754660	17755660	Yeah, yeah.
17755660	17757660	We're getting there, we're getting there, we're getting there.
17763660	17765660	Here is, oh, I'm getting stuck on a rope.
17765660	17767660	They shaved with knives.
17768660	17772660	They just got the homies to scratch their beards off by hand.
17772660	17775660	That sounds painful as anything.
17776660	17778660	Shave with obsidian.
17779660	17781660	The guy's still dead.
17782660	17784660	Okay, what am I supposed to do?
17784660	17786660	Oh, air assassination.
17786660	17791660	Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the guy's probably up in this building then, since it's all red.
17795660	17797660	Not gonna be discovered, am I?
17797660	17799660	Hello, goodbye.
17799660	17806660	Actually, I need to start looting bodies, cause I'm getting low on supplies, cause I'm wasting them all.
17807660	17809660	Mid.
17815660	17817660	Okay, air assassination.
17819660	17821660	Let's give that a shot, where is he?
17822660	17824660	Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination.
17824660	17826660	Oh, I just called him a horse doing that.
17830660	17833660	I need to get away, that's why I called him a horse.
17836660	17840660	Having strongies mug on two monitors is overwhelming.
17840660	17842660	Wait until I make hypnosis.
17842660	17844660	I'm so excited to make my first one.
17844660	17846660	I don't know what to do.
17847660	17852660	I was gonna do a, like, free thing.
17853660	17856660	God, these missions are so good and easy.
17856660	17858660	I can't go over it.
17858660	17860660	I'm not doing the Naruto.
17860660	17865660	I'll keep doing the Templar Agents, cause it's starting to get less and less.
17865660	17869660	Copernico is a nightmare, if I remember correctly.
17869660	17876660	Copernico is, like, throw yourself across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise.
17876660	17882660	And, like, it really does not give you, like, much time at all, so I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico.
17883660	17886660	No, I don't need the body, but thank you.
17886660	17888660	Hello, horsey.
17888660	17890660	Are you ready?
17890660	17892660	Mount.
17892660	17894660	Mabos.
17894660	17896660	Mabos.
17896660	17898660	Well, the horse, please think of Mabos.
17900660	17902660	Okay, I think we're gonna pull one way around.
17904660	17907660	Speaking of, are you gonna collab with Secret Subject?
17907660	17909660	I haven't reached out yet.
17909660	17911660	I know Secret is, like, super busy.
17911660	17917660	Like, she's got, like, the new VTuber model and everything going on.
17917660	17923660	And, uh, I don't want to be, like, a bother, like, harassing anyone.
17925660	17928660	I might get the boss to reach out.
17928660	17935660	But at the moment, like, I've actually got quite a lot of people that are interested in collabs with me,
17935660	17938660	and I'm gonna try and, like, not take too much time.
17938660	17942660	Like, as she says, as she plays on stream for 12 hours,
17942660	17947660	and literally has, like, folk waiting on her right in the script, so it can be sent off.
17947660	17949660	Well, that was fun.
17950660	17955660	Um, but yeah, I don't want to leave too much of the pee.
17955660	17957660	Send you away.
17957660	17959660	Can I send?
17960660	17963660	I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing.
17965660	17967660	I think it's time.
17967660	17975660	The problem is that I take, like, five minutes to generate one.
17975660	17977660	I really don't want to go.
17980660	17984660	I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about,
17984660	17987660	but I think it's happening.
17987660	17989660	Oh, wait, sorry. Oh, sorry.
17989660	17995660	I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over something.
17995660	18003660	But I'm, like, 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around.
18003660	18006660	I have no coin on my corpse.
18007660	18010660	Ah, I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary.
18010660	18012660	Nah.
18014660	18016660	Oh, no, no, no.
18016660	18020660	I will take advantage of the smoke, because we need to kill enemies in smoke.
18031660	18034660	Right, they can all just fight each other.
18035660	18037660	Oh, I need to go into the smoke.
18039660	18042660	Any idea when the first hit in the stream I'll do my job?
18044660	18046660	It's time is my biggest problem.
18046660	18051660	Like, if we end up doing this 100%, I don't know if it's possible.
18051660	18055660	Then I probably won't do it tonight.
18055660	18060660	Needy streamer, I need to go out and buy American sweets for this hand cam stream
18060660	18063660	and clean up my desk, because it's an absolute mess.
18064660	18066660	And get a nice cute outfit and all that.
18069660	18071660	It's just time, honestly.
18071660	18075660	I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it.
18075660	18078660	It's just time I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me.
18078660	18082660	And then I'm sending away shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers,
18082660	18086660	because I didn't want them being stressed out having to organize this stuff.
18087660	18094660	And, like, I guess it's just trying to settle in right now,
18094660	18099660	but I hope to have some consistent stuff that's free to access.
18099660	18105660	Like, I do want at least something decent free to access on the alt,
18105660	18110660	because I don't think it's fair, like, especially for, like, people just,
18110660	18113660	they just simply don't have the money, like, I completely understand,
18113660	18117660	like, don't ever feel bad if you're unable to, like, just straight up give money
18117660	18120660	to, like, streamers or anything like that, like, any of the viewers.
18120660	18126660	Like, I am 100% can say right now that, like, all the girls feel the exact same way as me.
18126660	18128660	If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad.
18128660	18133660	Like, literally watching, liking, commenting, flipping if you want,
18133660	18136660	liking a tweet, like, all of this stuff is free to do.
18136660	18139660	Like, that helps us beyond words.
18139660	18146660	So don't ever feel inclined and, like, thank you for respect
18146660	18149660	and that there, like, is a paywall on some of the content,
18149660	18152660	because, obviously, the girls need to eat and they need to thrive,
18152660	18156660	because if they don't, like, thrive monetary-wise,
18156660	18159660	then, obviously, they're not going to stick around at VLR, why would you?
18159660	18165660	So, like, I do appreciate everyone's, like, complete understanding around it.
18165660	18167660	Um...
18167660	18168660	Nope.
18168660	18169660	Right.
18169660	18170660	Okay, where's the source?
18170660	18171660	I am actually, unironically stuck.
18171660	18173660	Where the heck am I going?
18177660	18178660	Over the bridge?
18180660	18181660	Over the bridge?
18181660	18183660	Over the broken bridge?
18183660	18185660	The girls are doing great, don't worry.
18187660	18189660	No, not over the broken bridge.
18189660	18191660	Do not be fooled by the map.
18191660	18192660	It's not that old.
18192660	18194660	How do I get down though?
18196660	18199660	I always have that problem whenever I come up to this section.
18200660	18203660	You have to, like, all of your breath around me.
18204660	18207660	We're already lucky and spoiled with what you've done for us already.
18207660	18209660	No need to rush yet.
18209660	18211660	Like, I know some folk are noticing, like,
18211660	18214660	oh, all the girls aren't posting anymore.
18214660	18216660	And it was, like...
18216660	18219660	Yeah, the girls are live streaming now.
18219660	18221660	They're preparing for streams.
18221660	18224660	They're thinking our heads, like, like, that's stuff to do now.
18224660	18227660	Before, the only stuff the girls could do
18227660	18230660	was meme in the Discord with each other
18230660	18235660	and muck about on Twitter and pre-record audios, you know?
18235660	18239660	And now they've got so much to deal with and contend with, so...
18241660	18242660	What am I doing?
18243660	18244660	What am I doing before I mess up?
18244660	18245660	Kill your target?
18245660	18247660	Why is this game so good?
18247660	18250660	These game missions are so good!
18251660	18253660	It's actually making me angry.
18253660	18255660	Have nice interfaces.
18256660	18260660	Some... No, I do understand that some people, like, complain to complain.
18260660	18262660	That's okay. That's just how some people are.
18262660	18265660	Like, it's how they, like, get, you know, like, stressed out.
18265660	18268660	It's therapeutic to kind of have a mop or whatever.
18270660	18273660	It's a lady killer!
18275660	18277660	Okay, I need to chase...
18277660	18279660	Stop chasing me!
18279660	18282660	No, you like it, you little rascal.
18282660	18284660	You're teasing me.
18285660	18286660	You're a leaky.
18287660	18289660	I don't know what that means. They didn't put the subtitles in.
18292660	18293660	Stop it!
18294660	18296660	Oh, oh, oh! I love a good glitch.
18296660	18297660	I love a good glitch.
18297660	18299660	I love a good glitch.
18299660	18301660	And that helps me get the objective.
18301660	18302660	I love that.
18305660	18307660	That was gorgeous. Do that again.
18309660	18313660	Honestly, Renaissance outfit starting to grow in me.
18314660	18318660	Kind of Renaissance influence outfit, maybe.
18319660	18322660	Someone suggested a design...
18323660	18325660	Which was...
18325660	18326660	Ah...
18327660	18329660	Was it an aristocrat?
18330660	18331660	Vampire?
18332660	18335660	No, it was a smug aristocrat.
18335660	18336660	Mmm.
18337660	18340660	I'm very, like, posh, hoity-toity looking.
18340660	18343660	The only problem is they would have to be British,
18343660	18345660	because if there were any other...
18345660	18348660	I was about to say if there were any other gender,
18348660	18349660	it doesn't work.
18349660	18350660	If they're not British, I'm going to...
18350660	18352660	Oh, Christina available!
18352660	18355660	Wait, what's her DNA if Christina is available?
18355660	18357660	I'm not questioning it.
18357660	18358660	To Christina we go...
18358660	18360660	Mom-
18365660	18367660	Any other gender than British?
18367660	18369660	Let's- I was like, okay, thanks, friend.
18371660	18372660	Stroney?
18372660	18374660	Yesterday, don't follow Lady Hoon, also me.
18374660	18376660	No, no, no, no, I like that.
18376660	18378660	It's a lady assassin, though.
18379660	18382660	Only I am allowed to raise lady assassins.
18384660	18385660	Okay.
18385660	18387660	Something, Christina, because I have no idea
18387660	18390660	what the heck that your fricking story line is.
18391660	18392660	Alright, I need you guys,
18392660	18393660	because you guys...
18393660	18395660	I need to lure away guards with...
18398660	18400660	Can I technically get you guys to...
18400660	18401660	Well, why are you...
18401660	18402660	Right, I guess not.
18403660	18405660	There should be some guards coming up.
18406660	18407660	God, they can run fast.
18407660	18409660	They're keeping up with a horse practical.
18412660	18414660	Lure them away.
18414660	18415660	There we go.
18417660	18419660	Aristocrat with a Jordi axe.
18423660	18425660	Wait, I always get so...
18426660	18428660	spun about when it comes to this section of the map.
18428660	18430660	It's terrible.
18432660	18434660	I think it's on this stage.
18436660	18438660	Stuck their anger.
18439660	18441660	Watch out, watch out.
18442660	18444660	No, no, no.
18446660	18448660	No, no, I missed something there.
18450660	18452660	Goodness me.
18452660	18454660	I just can't even get this right.
18454660	18456660	Can't I just go on the wrong way?
18456660	18457660	On the wrong way?
18458660	18459660	You're the one that's right.
18459660	18460660	Oh, excuse me.
18460660	18461660	You're on my way.
18462660	18463660	I could have sworn there's a cape
18463660	18465660	that makes guards ignore you
18465660	18467660	unless you, like, straight up attack them.
18468660	18469660	I need to get into that.
18469660	18471660	I don't know what cape that is.
18475660	18476660	Oh, wow.
18476660	18478660	I think that's 5-1-2.
18486660	18488660	I'm just going to send them away for money
18488660	18491660	because I think we actually might have enough now.
18492660	18493660	No.
18493660	18494660	For...
18496660	18497660	For what?
18497660	18499660	For buying everything yet.
18501660	18503660	Right, Christina, my love.
18504660	18506660	Thank you for unlocking
18506660	18508660	because we were genuinely also confused
18508660	18511660	on what a bizarre ending your storyline had
18511660	18513660	because that didn't make any sense.
18514660	18516660	And you know it didn't.
18516660	18518660	So what on earth are we doing?
18521660	18522660	Oh, no.
18522660	18523660	Oh, no.
18526660	18527660	Oh, no.
18527660	18529660	I think we're going to the fair.
18532660	18534660	Do you get an AC monster?
18535660	18537660	Maybe put, like, an assassin's screen.
18537660	18538660	Hold on me.
18542660	18543660	So there'll be an assassin's screen.
18543660	18545660	Oh, I've never thought about that.
18545660	18547660	Maybe I should get AC's outfit
18547660	18549660	and, like, but, like, you know,
18549660	18552660	get the, like, red, lazy underwear and stuff.
18557660	18558660	Leonardo!
18579660	18580660	Aww.
18587660	18588660	Aww.
18588660	18590660	He's not over her.
18590660	18591660	He's heartbroken.
18594660	18595660	That's so sad.
18598660	18600660	I can't remember what we have to do here, though.
18602660	18603660	Oh, there she is!
18604660	18605660	I'm to tail her.
18610660	18612660	There she is.
18612660	18614660	With her other hussies.
18615660	18617660	Oh, Christina.
18623660	18625660	I'm just so interested in these masks.
18627660	18629660	She just got a circle.
18629660	18630660	Wait, what was it?
18630660	18632660	Am I supposed to do something?
18633660	18635660	Oh, plan a letter on her.
18635660	18637660	I beg your pardon.
18637660	18639660	I was like, why did she just go in a circle?
18645660	18646660	Okay.
18646660	18648660	That makes much more sense.
18648660	18650660	Way more sense.
18653660	18655660	Okay, the rendezvous?
18656660	18658660	Don't mind me.
18662660	18664660	Wait, she reciprocates.
18668660	18669660	Um...
18676660	18677660	Um...
18678660	18680660	It's you, that's wrong.
18680660	18681660	This is...
18681660	18682660	It's you.
18698660	18700660	I haven't seen you in eight years.
18700660	18702660	It's been eight years?
18702660	18704660	You're right.
18704660	18706660	I wouldn't have.
18706660	18707660	It's you.
18707660	18708660	The last time I saw you,
18708660	18710660	you kissed me in an alley
18710660	18712660	and then left me behind to be married.
18712660	18714660	It was the right thing to do.
18714660	18715660	We loved you.
18715660	18717660	Who cares what he wanted?
18717660	18718660	I love you!
18721660	18723660	You have your second child.
18724660	18725660	Please, Edson.
18726660	18727660	It got worse!
18727660	18729660	Why did we do this?
18729660	18731660	Why did we play that memory?
18731660	18732660	It got worse!
18732660	18734660	Is that where it ends?
18734660	18736660	That was even worse.
18736660	18738660	Why did we go away?
18738660	18740660	Why did we go further?
18740660	18742660	There has to be another one.
18742660	18743660	There's no way.
18744660	18746660	It got so much worse.
18749660	18752660	That was terrible.
18756660	18757660	Aw.
18762660	18764660	Shot through the heart, true.
18765660	18766660	That got even.
18766660	18767660	I don't know why...
18767660	18770660	I don't know why I thought that memory would...
18770660	18773660	Oh, that's going to be so much better than the last one.
18773660	18774660	No.
18776660	18778660	No, no, no, no, no.
18778660	18780660	That's terrible.
18782660	18785660	Well, she said don't find her again.
18785660	18787660	But I'm left unsatisfied.
18787660	18789660	I feel like that's such a short memory
18789660	18791660	that's not like the true ending.
18793660	18795660	Right, we're going to upgrade our assassins
18795660	18797660	just because...
18799660	18802660	we have the thing.
18803660	18806660	I'm a ballard about the seas, honestly.
18807660	18809660	I have quite a lot of money, though.
18813660	18815660	Good on Christina for not being a cheater.
18815660	18817660	Literally, like, when...
18817660	18820660	Oh, when she was like, oh, husband's name.
18820660	18823660	I was like, wait, Ezio planted the lair and...
18826660	18828660	What a mess, Ezio.
18828660	18831660	What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle.
18832660	18835660	Yeah, he sucks when it comes to romance.
18835660	18837660	Everything is permitted.
18841660	18843660	Goodness, gravy.
18848660	18850660	Mm-hmm.
18852660	18853660	Whoa.
18856660	18858660	Welcome to the Brotherhood.
18860660	18861660	Yes.
18864660	18866660	Did I get the thing?
18872660	18873660	Mm-hmm.
18874660	18876660	Suspend points.
18878660	18880660	Assassin's Guild challenge is complete.
18880660	18881660	Okay.
18883660	18884660	Uh, is that...
18884660	18886660	Oh, Guildcrest.
18886660	18888660	Stop, is there something new around here?
18891660	18893660	This?
18893660	18896660	We get little things.
18896660	18898660	We get trinkets.
18898660	18899660	Oh, my God, this game, I'm sorry.
18899660	18900660	This game was made for girls.
18900660	18901660	You're telling me.
18901660	18903660	I get a little sim.
18903660	18905660	And I get to put it in my little house,
18905660	18906660	my little assassin house.
18906660	18907660	Okay, sorry.
18907660	18908660	I love this game so much.
18910660	18911660	How did it know?
18911660	18913660	How did it know I was a girl?
18914660	18915660	Good night.
18915660	18916660	Rest well.
18916660	18917660	See you in the morning.
18918660	18919660	Mm-hmm.
18919660	18920660	Oh, this game.
18920660	18923660	Gender norms go hands, my goodness.
18924660	18925660	Ah, right.
18925660	18927660	I don't really want to start Copernicus.
18927660	18929660	We'll go by the Pantheon.
18931660	18933660	Augusto, my Pantheon.
18934660	18936660	We'll go by this because we literally do have a...
18936660	18939660	I'll check the bank in case any interest is made.
18940660	18943660	Accessories, Claire, I can't believe it.
18944660	18948660	I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins' freakin' hideout
18948660	18951660	with my Guildcrests for all my hard work.
18951660	18952660	Ah.
18954660	18955660	We know the target audience.
18955660	18956660	Honestly?
18956660	18959660	Is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls' game?
18959660	18963660	The only reason I say that is because it's, like, such a good game.
18964660	18965660	Like, it doesn't...
18966660	18970660	It's, like, so hard to get, like, genuinely to get stuck in, like,
18970660	18972660	at any part is next to impossible.
18975660	18976660	Mm.
18976660	18978660	Oh, I need poison guards, actually.
18980660	18982660	I'm just gonna, like, muck about.
18982660	18985660	I don't want to poison, like, anyone in front.
18985660	18987660	But I think they need to, like, pass away from poison,
18987660	18990660	or it doesn't count, because I'm pretty sure I've poisoned quite a lot now.
18991660	18992660	Um...
18993660	18995660	Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier.
18998660	19001660	Why is this one so goofy looking, honestly?
19005660	19007660	Wait, are you saying if it's easy to...
19007660	19008660	I mean...
19009660	19010660	I don't know.
19010660	19013660	I feel like whenever I see, like, a guy review a game,
19013660	19014660	it's always, like,
19014660	19016660	I love the challenge of this game.
19016660	19019660	I love having to repeat the same thing, like,
19019660	19022660	12 times over until I got, like, unspanked.
19023660	19025660	And, like, I figured it out.
19026660	19028660	And I'm, like, I just want a chill experience,
19028660	19030660	like, make it through the story mode,
19030660	19032660	and have a good time.
19033660	19034660	And, like, yeah.
19035660	19038660	I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games.
19041660	19043660	Not if you're a game journal.
19043660	19046660	I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boy's angry.
19046660	19047660	Yeah.
19049660	19051660	My little cousin played it after watching me play it.
19051660	19052660	So who is?
19055660	19056660	Someone's gonna get beat.
19058660	19060660	Then you gotta love Dark Souls.
19060660	19061660	I mean, it's basically what you...
19061660	19064660	No, Dark Souls is the opposite of what I described,
19064660	19066660	and I know for a fact why it is.
19067660	19072660	Because I have had the pleasure of playing Elden Ring with the Wreethlings,
19072660	19074660	and the truth...
19074660	19076660	You want the truth? I don't think you can handle the truth.
19076660	19080660	I would not have been able to complete that game on my own,
19080660	19084660	like, I just don't see how I could have done it
19084660	19086660	without all the help of the Wreethlings.
19087660	19088660	That's the truth.
19088660	19090660	You think you can handle the truth?
19091660	19094660	I need Poison Guards alone.
19095660	19098660	I'll just poison them when I attain.
19099660	19101660	I think I need to wait until they expire as well,
19101660	19103660	which is the biggest problem.
19104660	19106660	You just like your hand being held, didn't you?
19106660	19107660	What?
19107660	19111660	What do you mean that all these people are being so nice to me
19111660	19114660	and helping me through my game and I get to reward them?
19115660	19116660	Maybe I should do that.
19116660	19120660	Like, every time we do a game where you guys hold my hands,
19120660	19122660	like, I do a reward audio for it.
19122660	19127660	And then, like, when I'm doing the ending part of the reward,
19127660	19130660	I'm like, thank you for helping me, thank you for helping me,
19130660	19131660	thank you for helping me!
19131660	19133660	And then, then I pop.
19135660	19136660	You know?
19136660	19137660	That's terrible, I know.
19141660	19143660	Can you poison on horseback?
19144660	19147660	Can you poison on horseback?
19151660	19152660	It says shoot.
19153660	19155660	No, you can't poison on horseback.
19164660	19166660	A spank in that horse, jeez.
19167660	19169660	I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire.
19174660	19176660	I wouldn't be able to...
19176660	19177660	Wait, we played what?
19178660	19179660	Elden Ring.
19179660	19182660	Elden Rings are really good game to carry.
19204660	19205660	Hmm.
19207660	19210660	They're all looking in opposite directions.
19211660	19213660	So I can maybe do two.
19215660	19218660	I can maybe do three if I get this guy.
19218660	19220660	Oh, no, I can't, they're both...
19224660	19225660	That'd be amazing.
19226660	19228660	Games should have some challenge, though.
19228660	19229660	Yeah!
19229660	19230660	No, I do agree.
19230660	19232660	There definitely should be, like, some consequence.
19232660	19235660	Or else, if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything,
19235660	19236660	then you don't enjoy the game.
19236660	19239660	Like, it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic
19239660	19241660	that you wanted.
19241660	19242660	Like...
19242660	19244660	Oh, I'm in trouble, I'm sorry.
19245660	19246660	I am a naughty assassin.
19246660	19248660	I didn't hide well enough.
19248660	19249660	Unless...
19249660	19251660	Dun, dun, dun!
19251660	19253660	Oh, don't push me.
19253660	19254660	Get poisoned.
19256660	19257660	Plop, plop, plop.
19257660	19259660	Get poisoned, get poisoned, bloop, poison.
19260660	19262660	Everyone's getting poisoned around you.
19264660	19266660	Oh, please spin that pole around.
19266660	19267660	There we go.
19267660	19269660	Okay, I managed to replenish.
19269660	19271660	Oh, like, a ton of poisons, which is good.
19272660	19273660	Oh, hello.
19274660	19277660	You're going in the well for thieving from me.
19277660	19278660	Goodbye.
19281660	19282660	Um...
19283660	19285660	You can come out now.
19285660	19286660	It's okay.
19286660	19288660	I'll come get you.
19289660	19290660	I did not mean to do that.
19290660	19292660	I don't think his life should have been forfeit,
19292660	19293660	but...
19293660	19296660	I mean, was it kinda deserved?
19296660	19297660	I don't know.
19299660	19301660	That was a bit morbid, so I'm going to be honest.
19301660	19303660	I actually didn't expect that.
19304660	19306660	Please, mommy, don't poison my iron brew.
19306660	19309660	I have a can of iron brew in the fridge.
19310660	19312660	Look at this!
19312660	19314660	But it ages ago, and I'm still not sipped up.
19315660	19317660	I need, like, the perfect meal.
19317660	19320660	I miss British fish and chips so much.
19320660	19324660	I'm sorry to any Aussies listening.
19324660	19327660	Your fish and chips are rank.
19334660	19336660	Okay, I did the court exam.
19336660	19337660	Can I poison?
19337660	19347660	Can I poison all you guys, and then push you all away
19347660	19349660	so you don't do that fighting thing?
19349660	19351660	I hate when they do the fighting thing.
19351660	19354660	I think if they, like, hit each other with the swords,
19354660	19357660	it doesn't count as poison, so I'm going to try and separate them.
19357660	19359660	Oh, he just did it there.
19359660	19361660	Mmm...
19364660	19365660	No, I tried.
19365660	19367660	I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly
19367660	19369660	before the poison's out somehow.
19370660	19372660	Hey, I'm not going to find it with fish and chips around here.
19372660	19375660	Yeah, Aussies use shark.
19375660	19377660	Like, I think it's called gummy shark.
19377660	19379660	It's not actual shark.
19379660	19380660	Meat.
19380660	19382660	It's just a fish.
19385660	19388660	How do you call Germans Scottish?
19388660	19389660	Oh, there we go.
19389660	19391660	We did the poison guard.
19391660	19393660	Rank five.
19393660	19395660	Court is on...
19396660	19399660	Did I say court is on poison people now?
19400660	19402660	Ladies.
19402660	19404660	I didn't know that.
19405660	19407660	Am I in Australia forever?
19407660	19409660	I highly doubt it.
19409660	19412660	It's very good to run a business from Australia
19412660	19414660	compared to the United Kingdom,
19414660	19415660	but...
19415660	19416660	Oh.
19416660	19418660	Well, you're saying get down to me,
19418660	19420660	but not to this wife over here.
19421660	19423660	What's he going to say?
19423660	19424660	No.
19424660	19426660	Are you joking me?
19428660	19430660	Yeah, it's good to run a business in Australia,
19430660	19433660	but I can't see myself being here forever.
19437660	19438660	Lance.
19440660	19441660	Ooh!
19441660	19443660	The British use haddock.
19443660	19445660	It's a delicious fish.
19445660	19447660	Are you in Australia?
19447660	19449660	Yeah, I am.
19449660	19451660	I'm doing a...
19451660	19453660	I'm making a corn.
19454660	19456660	I'm going to do a V-Tuber meet and greet
19456660	19458660	in Australia.
19460660	19462660	I did not look at what the 100% thing was.
19462660	19463660	Oopsie.
19463660	19465660	What's 100%?
19465660	19467660	Kill your target with a hidden blade.
19467660	19471660	Why is this mission tape so...
19471660	19473660	so perfect?
19477660	19478660	Hmm.
19478660	19479660	Hmm.
19479660	19480660	Hmm.
19480660	19481660	Hmm.
19481660	19482660	Hmm.
19482660	19483660	Hmm.
19483660	19484660	Hmm.
19484660	19485660	Hmm.
19485660	19486660	Hmm.
19486660	19487660	Hmm.
19487660	19488660	Hmm.
19488660	19489660	Hmm.
19489660	19490660	Hmm.
19490660	19491660	Hmm.
19491660	19492660	Hmm.
19492660	19493660	Hmm.
19493660	19494660	Hmm.
19494660	19496660	So, Ironberg was well with fish and chips then.
19496660	19498660	Ah, kind of.
19498660	19501660	I don't know what the best takeaway...
19501660	19503660	maybe unironically a Chinese,
19503660	19505660	but like a British Chinese.
19505660	19508660	Oh, I think I need to chase this guy
19508660	19509660	from the rooftops.
19509660	19511660	I think, yeah.
19511660	19513660	It's giving chase from the rooftops.
19513660	19514660	Hmm.
19516660	19517660	Merda!
19517660	19519660	What do you mean, merda?
19519660	19520660	Get bonked.
19520660	19521660	Hmm.
19521660	19522660	Hmm.
19522660	19523660	Hidden blade.
19523660	19524660	Hidden blade.
19524660	19525660	Lock on to him at least,
19525660	19526660	Exio.
19526660	19527660	Don't be afraid.
19527660	19528660	Exio.
19528660	19529660	Water!
19529660	19530660	Exio.
19530660	19533660	The only thing I despise
19533660	19535660	is when you have to do, like,
19535660	19536660	assassin.
19536660	19537660	Can you come here?
19537660	19538660	Yeah?
19538660	19539660	Yeah?
19539660	19540660	Yeah?
19540660	19541660	No.
19541660	19542660	No.
19542660	19543660	No.
19543660	19544660	Come back.
19544660	19545660	Come back.
19545660	19546660	Come back.
19546660	19547660	Can I knock him off?
19547660	19549660	Why are you trying to hit the air?
19550660	19551660	Oh.
19552660	19553660	Goodness sake!
19553660	19555660	Stop moving a bit!
19555660	19556660	Just accept your death.
19556660	19558660	It's over for you, buddy.
19559660	19560660	Stop it!
19560660	19562660	Oh, actually getting teased.
19562660	19563660	Stop it.
19563660	19564660	There we go.
19564660	19565660	My goodness.
19567660	19568660	My tummy hurt.
19568660	19569660	No more food.
19571660	19572660	No more.
19572660	19573660	Have you eaten too much?
19573660	19574660	Can't forget.
19576660	19578660	Have you had any encounter with local fauna?
19578660	19580660	Ah, magpies.
19581660	19584660	I have befriended wild magpies.
19584660	19587660	Although I saw my first snake
19587660	19589660	in a cockroach.
19589660	19590660	Oh my god.
19590660	19593660	There's no such thing as cockroaches
19593660	19595660	in Scotland.
19595660	19597660	And I met my first...
19597660	19598660	And a possum.
19598660	19599660	Oh my god.
19599660	19600660	Possum are terrifying.
19600660	19601660	I don't like...
19601660	19603660	I thought they were cute.
19603660	19606660	The noise they make at night is like...
19606660	19608660	Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!
19608660	19610660	Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!
19610660	19611660	Very scary.
19611660	19612660	Not a fan.
19612660	19613660	Not a fan.
19615660	19617660	Yeah, I had my first cockroach encounter
19617660	19618660	and I'm like,
19618660	19619660	I want to go back to Scotland right now.
19619660	19620660	Thank you very much.
19623660	19624660	Because...
19624660	19625660	Oh my goodness.
19626660	19629660	Possums are harmless if you leave them alone.
19629660	19630660	Yes.
19630660	19635660	I accidentally ran into one.
19635660	19637660	That sounds really dumb.
19637660	19640660	But my cat escaped the garden
19640660	19645660	and I had to go into my neighbour's garden.
19645660	19647660	And it was one o'clock in the morning
19647660	19649660	and thank goodness I'm no in America
19649660	19652660	because I probably would have got shot on sight.
19652660	19653660	Oh, I'm in trouble.
19655660	19657660	And it was absolute nightmare.
19657660	19660660	It was freaking so dark
19660660	19662660	and I had to run around
19662660	19664660	to get into my neighbour's garden
19664660	19667660	and there was a possum that was eye level in the fence.
19667660	19669660	And both of us basically,
19669660	19671660	like, both me and the possum were like,
19671660	19672660	eep!
19675660	19680660	But yeah, I had to dive into my neighbour's garden
19680660	19684660	at 1am to throw my cat back over the fence.
19685660	19688660	Yes, Gimli, I'm talking about you.
19689660	19691660	Don't do it again.
19691660	19693660	I never want to be in that situation again.
19693660	19696660	I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox
19696660	19699660	being like, I am so sorry if you heard any of that.
19699660	19701660	The ruckus last night, that was me.
19701660	19703660	No one tried to steal from you.
19703660	19707660	And I had to sign it with my freaking address and everything.
19709660	19710660	Her name is Gimli.
19710660	19711660	Yes.
19711660	19713660	Because she's Ginger.
19714660	19717660	She's got Ginger on her, so I named my cat Gimli.
19717660	19722660	So when I pick her up, I go, that's my wee lad, Gimli.
19724660	19725660	Hmm.
19727660	19729660	Excuse me, you said, well, the thing was,
19729660	19731660	it was literally 1am.
19731660	19735660	And like, they had the creakiest gate ever.
19735660	19738660	And I'm like, I'm like, Gimli, Gimli, get here,
19738660	19740660	Gimli, get here right now, Gimli.
19740660	19744660	And because she had never been outside the garden before.
19745660	19748660	And she got really confused.
19748660	19751660	And was meowing at the door of the neighbour
19751660	19754660	instead of coming back over the fence to me.
19754660	19756660	Like, I had been calling on her for ages
19756660	19758660	and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighbourhoods,
19758660	19760660	like the neighbourhoods area.
19760660	19766660	And I was like, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli.
19766660	19770660	Kill only Donato, big Donato.
19774660	19778660	Nobody, no, like, unironically, I had to toss Gimli back into my garden.
19779660	19782660	And yeah, she's not here.
19784660	19787660	Oh, the music's gonna do the thing.
19788660	19791660	I love the pickup of the music.
19797660	19803660	Oh my God, veterinary care, though, in Australia is so fairly priced
19803660	19805660	and so good.
19806660	19814660	My baby boy, he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious
19814660	19817660	and he had a cut on his leg.
19818660	19821660	And I phoned up a vet and they were like,
19821660	19826660	oh, we offer up a pickup service for animals.
19826660	19829660	And I'm like, well, I don't drive, so that's perfect, thank you.
19829660	19833660	I don't understand how you can do that, though.
19834660	19836660	Wait, I need to kill only him?
19836660	19838660	Simple.
19839660	19841660	You can bowl a cat.
19841660	19843660	What?
19843660	19845660	Where are my pills?
19848660	19851660	But yeah, I phoned up, I'm like,
19851660	19855660	my baby boy's got a cut on his leg, I don't know what happened.
19855660	19858660	Can I book an appointment?
19858660	19861660	I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me.
19861660	19863660	Wait, wait, wait, wait, just becoming anonymous.
19863660	19865660	Don't hurt anyone.
19865660	19869660	Excuse me, good sir, I need this horse, I need the horse.
19869660	19872660	Please give horse, horse now, thank you, bye.
19872660	19876660	Ow, ow, ow, ow, horse, horse, come, horse.
19876660	19878660	Let me on you!
19878660	19884660	No, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone.
19884660	19889660	Nice, I'm coming in my own horse, this is gonna be ridiculous.
19889660	19894660	No, don't run away, don't run away, I need the horse.
19894660	19896660	Right, let's go.
19899660	19901660	We're safe.
19903660	19905660	We're safe, are they chasing?
19905660	19907660	Oh, they're chasing!
19907660	19909660	Oh, okay, okay.
19909660	19913660	Sorry, sorry, sorry, I know which way to go, sorry, sorry, sorry, pardon me,
19913660	19916660	excuse me, pardon me, come through, excuse me.
19916660	19920660	Uh, right, which path does NPCs not normally take?
19920660	19922660	That's one, I guess.
19923660	19925660	Okay.
19925660	19928660	And we lost them, we're going pretty far now.
19930660	19936660	I'm still going, still going, can I go down here?
19936660	19939660	Oh, we did it, okay, I'm fine.
19940660	19942660	Let's go.
19943660	19946660	We took a neighbour cat cat since she got on a fight in Toril Fathom,
19946660	19948660	and I was like, give it away to her.
19948660	19955660	Yeah, like literally, the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good.
19955660	19959660	And they were like, oh, we can like pick up your animal, and I'm like, oh, yes please.
19959660	19966660	And I was expecting like $800 or something, and it was like super cheap, and they were so nice.
19966660	19972660	And like, it was so quick until when I adopted him, that I was like, I'm so sorry,
19972660	19977660	I have absolutely no idea what the temperament he's going to be, like please be careful,
19977660	19980660	he might be aggressive, like I don't know how he's going to act, and they were like,
19980660	19985660	oh, he was just like a sweet little angel, and I'm like, oh, thank you, I'm so glad.
19986660	19988660	So what happened next with Gimli?
19988660	19995660	Oh, well, threw her back over the fence, and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her,
19995660	20000660	because she is a silly, silly sausage and gives me a heart attack.
20004660	20010660	I unfortunately live like on car roads.
20010660	20018660	Actually, one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed limit,
20018660	20022660	or the speed limit is ridiculously high, and I'm not being funny.
20022660	20025660	The speed of freaking cars is ridiculous over here.
20025660	20032660	It's very Americanized, sorry, sorry to be mean and stinky, because I should be really thankful like that.
20032660	20040660	I even have like the ability to like, basically like check out another country type thing,
20040660	20045660	like I should be grateful and all that, but it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to complain, so I will complain.
20046660	20050660	But I'm trying to think that once, hold on.
20053660	20060660	So you did, literally, what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence.
20060660	20066660	So I basically, now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like, oh my god, you're,
20066660	20069660	was it a linear or whatever her name was, 2.0 or whatever.
20069660	20075660	No, I put her back on the tree, like I like sugled her back on the tree,
20075660	20080660	and then I knew she was back in the garden, and then I had to run around and go back in,
20080660	20084660	like in my garden and bring her back into the house.
20084660	20090660	And obviously she was on time at like, she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that.
20090660	20093660	We know you never helped me, yeah.
20093660	20095660	Oh, sitting in the chat for me.
20095660	20097660	Why you gonna go home?
20097660	20101660	You go into a car crash, listen to the sheebie, you're joking.
20105660	20108660	You're joking, you're in a car crash.
20108660	20111660	You heard it here first.
20111660	20118660	The violor is causing people serious damage to their health.
20118660	20121660	You've heard it here first.
20121660	20123660	Oh, we've done all the missions.
20123660	20127660	So we can do courtesans, we can do these.
20127660	20129660	We can do Copernacle.
20129660	20131660	What's our DNA percentage now?
20131660	20133660	62?
20146660	20149660	Wait, the treasures count as 100%?!
20149660	20151660	Ignoring the treasures?
20158660	20160660	Hope you're okay.
20160660	20162660	Did you have to like call the police?
20162660	20165660	I think you have to report it to the police if you get hit.
20165660	20167660	I'm gonna cry.
20168660	20170660	Oh.
20178660	20180660	Why are they doing that?
20180660	20182660	Okay, Leonardo says 18%.
20182660	20184660	I think that's holding us back on the DNA.
20184660	20185660	Right, we're doing it.
20185660	20187660	We're doing it, Leonardo.
20188660	20191660	Oh no, Majobi's came back.
20192660	20195660	You know, sometimes if you hold it, it goes away again.
20195660	20197660	It's coming back.
20202660	20204660	Where's Kaka Ann on when you need him?
20204660	20208660	I had a really funny story for him, but I don't even know if he's here anymore.
20209660	20212660	And it's the one that wanted to hear me fart in the toilet.
20212660	20214660	I don't know if he's still here.
20214660	20217660	But if he is, I'll tell you a really funny story.
20217660	20219660	And it's really gross.
20220660	20222660	Shit!
20223660	20225660	Yo-yoing your poop?
20225660	20227660	No! No!
20227660	20229660	A little bit though.
20229660	20231660	I feel like, oh, I think I've said this before,
20231660	20234660	and this is the dumbest statement I'll ever say.
20234660	20237660	But I feel like if you're a guy, if you're yo-yo, can you not like...
20239660	20241660	stimulate your pee?
20241660	20243660	Doing that?
20244660	20246660	Use a smoke bomb to stun the overseer?
20246660	20248660	Not overseer, sure. I can 100% not.
20248660	20250660	Easy peasy.
20250660	20252660	Yes, I do have a stun bomb on me.
20253660	20255660	Locate the overseer.
20255660	20257660	What? No comment.
20257660	20259660	Literally, like, isn't that a thing that guys can do?
20263660	20266660	Still surprised no one said, I'm doing it right now.
20266660	20268660	Right.
20268660	20270660	And then...
20270660	20272660	Oh, we got a double assassination out of that.
20272660	20274660	Oh, the others just disappeared.
20274660	20276660	Right, we'll do any Leonardo.
20277660	20279660	I've never felt good from...
20279660	20281660	Well, aren't you in luck?
20281660	20283660	I have a four-part trading series.
20283660	20285660	See if it's for you, and if you finish the series,
20285660	20287660	and you don't like it,
20287660	20289660	then actually, you were right.
20289660	20291660	It really isn't for you.
20294660	20296660	Whoa, that's a lot of money.
20297660	20299660	So...
20303660	20305660	You stay away from the back door.
20306660	20310660	I mean, I don't know if once you've done all those things...
20312660	20315660	If there's really much of a point of sending them away,
20315660	20319660	other than one, one, two, three, and four.
20319660	20321660	Yeah, that looks good.
20322660	20325660	Did she be heck on wheels?
20325660	20327660	Not? Yeah, I might not have even done it,
20327660	20329660	I don't know, honestly.
20330660	20332660	Oh, I think I need...
20332660	20333660	I think I need toilet time,
20333660	20334660	but it's gonna take me like five minutes,
20334660	20336660	because I'm a nervous poopo.
20336660	20339660	I'm a nervous poopo when I sweep with some wheezing.
20339660	20342660	That comes flying out of my nose.
20343660	20345660	I remember I felt more embarrassed by a streamer in my life,
20345660	20346660	because SUV man went,
20346660	20347660	what was that?
20347660	20349660	And I just went, listen to a podcast.
20350660	20352660	Oh, are she bees in your ears like,
20353660	20355660	like spitting on you and that?
20355660	20357660	He's like, weren't you listening to me?
20358660	20359660	Flying machine...
20359660	20361660	Oh, I think I picked like the hardest one.
20361660	20365660	Do not get shot while using the bomber.
20365660	20366660	Okay.
20370660	20374660	Do not get shot while using the bomber.
20376660	20379660	Do not get shot.
20380660	20382660	So am I allowed to be spotted,
20382660	20384660	or is this a classic warning being detected
20384660	20385660	because desynchronization?
20385660	20387660	Okay, I need to go poopy.
20387660	20388660	I'm nervous.
20388660	20390660	I'm scared of this part of the section.
20390660	20391660	Do you guys want it?
20391660	20394660	What happens if we all take a job at the exact same time?
20404660	20406660	I'm having lots of water,
20406660	20409660	so I need to make sure the organs are all ready
20409660	20411660	for this ball man about to drop.
20423660	20424660	Okay, I'm gonna mute.
20424660	20426660	I will be a few moments,
20426660	20428660	so do forgive me for this.
20429660	20431660	Who said link up or put mods?
20431660	20432660	No, I'm just kidding.
20433660	20434660	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
20435660	20436660	Okay.
20436660	20438660	I'm ready to poop.
20438660	20440660	I'm pooping around.
20462660	20463660	Okay.

20891680	20906040	I don't know about you lads, but I came flying over me.
20906040	20910960	I'm grabbing my cup of tea and I'm gonna make a honey tea, I'll be back in like literally
20910960	20911960	a minute.
20911960	20918960	Okay that was already boiling.
20971960	20994120	Well, I have absolutely horrific news, I've not got any tea bags left, there'll be no
20994120	21000040	honey tea for me and this has shot me, that was a moment for me to, I'm so sorry if you
21000040	21007320	dropped in on that moment, we all collectively went for adobe, I can't believe I'm fricking
21007320	21013160	out of tea bags, I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm gonna like, the one thing I do like about
21013160	21023520	Australian supermarkets, they have big like stuff, oh my, calibration is off, hold on,
21024520	21030520	there, that's my calibration, I don't know why I was looking all the way over that way,
21030520	21041400	I have no idea if we're gonna be able to do this, do you want people to tell you when
21041400	21046240	the other girls go live or when you ask for it, please always tell me when a girl goes
21046240	21059360	live, I can't always keep up and I suck, right, I am not to be detected, interesting, if I'm
21059360	21066960	not to be detected, wait what am I supposed to do though, locate the architect, but don't
21066960	21085520	be detected please, okay, I, there's two together, how am I supposed to be able to navigate, you
21085520	21089920	play some games where you versus the chat and hypnotise them so you win honestly though, I
21089920	21096280	wanted to do an IQ test and then I want a chat to do an IQ test, like we do a poll for what
21096280	21118840	the answer is and see what like the results are, are they gonna spot me, wait, wow, I love all the
21118840	21128520	bugs in this game, full stop, I just love them all, game don't be detected, then why is that man on
21128520	21135600	the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work the victory, oh no you guys are allowed to win,
21135600	21140320	I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I think it hit me in the stream where I make
21140320	21146680	y'all dumb, really good, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk,
21146680	21157040	I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him over there,
21157040	21175040	I'm having a, I don't have a choice, yeah I was gonna say I don't have a choice because he was
21175040	21182400	coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right, I'm gonna be number one, chats IQ's
21182400	21190560	room temperature, but that's why we're so good for each other, we're so bad, is that tracking funny
21190560	21195960	to me, I think, oh my tracking is funny, I fucking hate this iPhone for some reason, sorry that I got
21195960	21204960	really aggressive out of nowhere, whenever it is horizontal it does not track me full stop, horizontal,
21204960	21210240	vertical, no when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge it
21210320	21216800	while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical, it's not tracking being rubbish all day,
21218240	21224800	I'll just over enunciate my word, so you guys, I don't know where this enemy is genuinely,
21228880	21237920	can I, oh it was me, pardon me for being so rough, I guess I can do this kind of stuff,
21241200	21242400	and loot the bodies,
21247440	21250800	could you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there,
21253680	21258800	oh, so it's on like the world's tiniest tripod which is adorable,
21259760	21270640	I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is, I'm supposed to be trying to find him,
21275680	21278400	I'm gonna loot these bodies and hopefully get more supplies,
21278400	21281360	because one poison, one medicine wasn't a deal,
21282320	21285920	I'm not good, the position of the arms is all wrong for the saltarello,
21285920	21289760	please expire so I can loot your body, sorry, okay there we go,
21291440	21295200	to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is off or not, since we don't have a reference,
21295200	21301840	all right let me build my webcam lets, where is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the
21301840	21308400	church or something, is he in it, is he the one by the hay bale, he can't be,
21312080	21312480	um,
21316080	21317920	have I been everywhere yet, I don't know,
21319600	21324960	so those were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why,
21326400	21327520	no, what,
21330880	21340960	is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling me to stay in this section,
21341840	21349040	I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your voice it's saying,
21350320	21353040	love cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true,
21355600	21358320	I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl,
21359280	21373760	okay, look at that, I think we're just gonna have to literally go around the map and clean it up,
21373760	21376080	because this is,
21379920	21386560	use eagle engine to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing is being
21386560	21396320	highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they still, we're checking the hay bale,
21407360	21415600	they're like, those guards from down there come any closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them with
21415600	21421520	poison, like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video game,
21421520	21423360	I've literally been to all sections of this map,
21432080	21438320	wait that didn't happen, okay, I hit them that time, I'm gonna loot their bodies to get all the supplies,
21438320	21447200	oh they'll meet them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building?
21458320	21466560	more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk into
21466560	21477760	guards that are like flailing about and it's like, bro, hopefully I can get more ammo off
21477760	21483840	these guys and I'm not spending more, I just get, I'm getting more poison back which is fine,
21483840	21489440	if I'm spending poison it's good to get poison back, but am I getting,
21496800	21499680	okay, I didn't, so he does just roam the map,
21504960	21511440	okay, all those guards, don't want to be these things because I stopped,
21514800	21525680	I didn't really see it turned back, I'm very confused with this mission, so like I had to
21525680	21531440	find him walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm gonna go on the roof because
21531440	21540320	there's that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill
21540320	21551360	with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, okay, fuck it, I'll do it, hopefully this gives
21551360	21562800	me like a loading point, give me the plans, right now, oh yeah, honestly me,
21571280	21577840	that took so long to progress, I do apologize, that must be painful, right, so what happened
21578480	21586320	now, I'm notorious, okay, I can deal with that, I've definitely progressed to the next loading
21586320	21591360	screen, so again we've not failed 100%, do not get shot while using the bomber,
21592080	21599760	surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber, surely I will not have any issues at all
21599760	21605440	and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch
21605440	21614960	on that, oh it hits you with a ver, oh sorry, I need time to perish like right now, so don't get caught,
21617200	21626480	no I have no interest, surely absolutely health and copium, right, next loading point, yes please,
21626880	21637520	oh I'm at,
21637520	21643120	I'm to not be detected by the two guards that are across from each other,
21645840	21649440	yeah, I'm not to be detected by the two point blank guards,
21650400	21658560	I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way, and then he will be distracted by him,
21661680	21668640	I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's in the way,
21669520	21680000	get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that,
21680560	21684560	but they've made them a little too well, okay, they've made them a little too well,
21686800	21692160	okay yeah my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you,
21693120	21697840	there's no way, or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, give me, let me click for the
21702800	21706960	my elaborate set up from yesterday, I removed all the cups from my ring, look at them ass,
21707840	21711680	when I had the perfect set up,
21719120	21720640	that looks much more,
21723120	21730160	okay and then we'll look for supplies, the poor NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm
21730160	21737200	gonna be so mad, because I don't know what to expect,
21737200	21750160	okay, these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous,
21752560	21761680	these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous, okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see
21761680	21774480	the ones coming down the hill, I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted,
21774480	21784160	I'm just gonna hide in here, unleash the archers, good evening skulls, I'm nervous, I don't know
21784160	21795760	what to do here, I'm just kind of waiting around, waiting for the EI to kick in, so I don't know
21795760	21804640	what to do now, oh yeah that, must have been drinking the good stuff, must have been drinking the good stuff,
21805120	21814480	okay we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts are,
21815920	21820480	yeah you know don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly
21820480	21829040	don't be afraid, no I missed shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no next one, use the other
21829040	21837040	guys, okay there we go, we're gonna let these two bodies so we can refill our poison, we're taking
21837040	21846960	it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah, okay these are both poisoned,
21846960	21853600	again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow, you know we don't need it too
21853680	21859120	fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere,
21867920	21874080	but remember don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through do you think,
21875280	21876880	I'll still finish it anyway, but
21877440	21883200	no, oh yeah, wow you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that,
21885120	21889920	she be redirect, oh no they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now,
21894320	21902800	I'm gonna be region, they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer, nice cozy atmosphere, remember the
21902800	21906160	guys gagging and choking on the background, literally, I'm gonna just need a whistle to my
21906160	21914720	teeth, whistle while you work, your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the dlc stuff because like
21916400	21918000	I don't know there's anyone up here,
21918960	21927440	oh my gosh,
21933280	21939440	I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like
21940000	21954800	and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth, oh no, oh no, no he can't see us again,
21955680	21968000	he needs to forget about us like right now, he needs to like okay, wow that was dangerous,
21970400	21976880	hold on, I think we'll be investigated by another guard, right there's one in there,
21978480	21982240	yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies,
21982960	21986800	I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff,
21987200	21996480	oh my goodness, she be caught and bummed herself, thank you for the wait,
21998000	22005200	how is your stream, are you steaming, please drink water, please drink lots of water, my dear,
22006000	22010960	we don't want any hangovers, she be and Emmy,
22011120	22021600	wait, both Emmy too, you both spend a stream at the same time, oh my gosh, hi guys,
22024000	22028080	oh my god, you both ended stream at the same time, I don't know, maybe you should like kiss or
22028080	22035120	something, geez, I don't know, maybe you should give each other a little kiss, if you're just like
22035200	22041760	so in tune with each other, please, Emmy ready to she be, she be ready to do
22043760	22049520	please get lots of water and food, she be, don't want you having any hangovers,
22051200	22059200	hi Emmy, hope you both enjoyed your streams, hope you enjoyed your streams, we are currently doing
22059760	22068400	Leonardo's missions and I'm currently debating if I'm actually capable of 100% in this game,
22069040	22075840	unfortunately my answer is it might be, it might be a no, I don't actually think I have the
22075840	22081600	thingy, just guarantee the vods getting nuked, okay, guys I'm trying to get you monetized on
22081600	22089600	YouTube, right, I can get him, I need this archer over here done, yeah, okay, I'm glad that looks,
22090640	22095200	that's good, is that a flag over there, I don't know, maybe just a treasure,
22096640	22105680	sorry it's fine, I'm teasing, you guys can do what you want, but I'm not, I need to go there, what?
22105680	22118320	Oh goodness me, que cosa, I actually think I want that guard to forget I exist,
22122240	22128080	she seems so grown up, it's fine, we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 2,
22128960	22136160	which is a very beloved childhood game of mine, I believe Mercy's coming online in one, two,
22136160	22143440	three hours, just under three hours, so if you are a snippet, you are welcome to hang about
22144400	22151760	till it's mercy time, that's very, oh that guy up there, I don't like him,
22152160	22159440	I think I'm gonna have to start looting bodies as well, because I'm running low on ammo,
22159440	22181120	so that was actually rather humus, oh what a post to be left on, POV, you're a harem,
22182400	22184800	that's the position she'd be gonna leave you in at the end of the night,
22184880	22190160	yep no bad, it's already dead,
22194560	22197280	wait it already got a warning, that was pretty quick,
22201040	22205040	that was pretty rough, Jesus, I private it over here, ah I should have gone,
22205760	22209040	ah let's see, let's do poison,
22213280	22214720	oh let's not do poison again,
22220160	22227520	oh she'd be making a smart move, five head move, this is so sad, I only got to see half of it,
22228800	22233360	there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry, it's not one and done,
22234320	22239600	we're not, we ain't one and done around these parts, hopefully YouTube gets this stuff missed,
22240720	22246960	there's a few things going on with YouTube right now, this is a very slow based mission
22246960	22250480	by the way, because every time we poison I have to wait until they're perished and then I have
22250480	22254080	to loot them and then I have to go for the next part, I don't know if I can reach anything here,
22254400	22258560	just outside but I need him gone,
22261280	22263520	I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower,
22266000	22268800	he's out arranging these guys, but I'm not gonna do it,
22268800	22275440	Strani you're always streaming, are you okay, ah yeah it's called, I am sharing my childhood games
22275440	22282160	and I love them and I want to share them, it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday, I was a bit,
22282160	22282880	can he see me?
22286560	22292800	He can, man needs glasses, I mean Tuarev will literally let you upload, true,
22297600	22304960	lovely, lovely stuff, we will be taking this very easy,
22305200	22311680	I am not sure how to get
22316640	22320160	out of safety, we're gonna be doing a lot of poison right now,
22322160	22327600	I'm, I don't know if I can leap from there to that and I don't want to risk it,
22327600	22332240	that looks like a leap over definitely, like that 100% looks like a leap over so,
22333120	22337920	right they're currently poisoned below me, so I should be safe to make my,
22340240	22345280	there's a lot of red there, I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though,
22347360	22351520	a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is all inspiring, I just really enjoy
22351520	22357600	these video games, I definitely will be focusing, please don't think my streams like are all gonna
22357600	22361600	be 18 hours, like tomorrow's needy streamer overload, I've never played it before but
22361600	22367760	it's definitely gonna be a shorter stream because I don't even know if I like it and
22368480	22376400	whenever like I have the, whoa, it's so careful, what happens if I spin around a beam
22377280	22383600	and a, no need to poison these two down here, I'm not risking it,
22384160	22392720	not risking it at all, we have come too far, right onto the beam,
22395360	22399600	I'm just going poison route because poison stops them from being able to see me,
22401040	22410640	and yeah, I'm gonna loot this guy's body because archers normally have a lot more stuff on him,
22413600	22418560	called fish are venomous, there is one called fish is venomous but my ink isn't venomous,
22419680	22425440	it's an aphrodisiac, it puts you under my alluring spell,
22427680	22430800	that's so, what is bro doing, poison them,
22433280	22437280	the lead artist for needy streamer overload is one of my favorite artists, I'm a sucker for
22438240	22446400	oh his and she booty's stuff, right, we need to be super careful because this is the most
22446400	22452640	ridiculous thing for trying to spot enemies, there's like guys all the way up this tower
22453440	22459040	and it is so hard to know when one's about to see you and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again
22460480	22465360	but I'm getting scared, okay I can see one guy up there, it must be there all on the roof
22468240	22475200	under your lure, not your visa, you might have a streaming edition, I can't believe it,
22477120	22478240	oh almost fell there,
22481360	22491520	you said you might not be able to 100% it, there's a few 100% that I genuinely don't know
22491760	22500080	and I'm worried about not being able to do my, like I just simply cannot do it and I can't
22500080	22506800	like call, I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me and so I've still, I'm still
22506800	22515840	not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not, I can hear music, how am I supposed to hurt
22515840	22528640	them all at once, I don't think that, is that a flag this room, no what, the sun's getting further
22529520	22546720	um, why isn't it, what am I supposed to do, no, oh, okay, okay, I understand, I thought I was about
22546720	22554240	to be exposed right at the end there, right, in order to 100% this mission, do not get shot
22554240	22560880	while using the bomber, okay, we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now, all I have to
22560880	22568560	do is nail this off the bat and I don't even remember freaking doing this, oh I'm going to start
22568560	22583120	sweating, okay, don't get shot using the bomber, oh why can we not get like a little tutorial first,
22583840	22590400	destroy the workshops, I can do that, I can do that, it's fine, tactical camera, no not tactical,
22590400	22598800	that was awful, don't ever do that again, press retreat to fire, R2, oh no, oh my god I'm going
22598800	22603120	down, this is not good, this is not good, oh my god, I don't know the controls, I don't know the
22603120	22613280	controls, oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is, it's the one, if I take a right,
22613280	22617600	I don't think I'm going to make it, just go for the one that I'm hitting at, oh my god there's
22617680	22627280	archer towers, no no no no no no no no no no no no!
22637360	22643840	I didn't even hit that tower, yeah, see this is what I'm afraid of, that I can't 100%, I'm under
22643840	22649200	After the impression, I now have to redo this entire mission again.
22649200	22653400	I missed that again?
22653400	22654400	I'm trying so hard.
22654400	22657520	I think I'm going to have to go further away.
22657520	22659520	I don't think there's a checkpoint.
22659520	22661520	I never gave an indication.
22661520	22668000	Okay, there we go.
22668000	22671120	Shoot workshop twi- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my controller, Jesus.
22671120	22673120	Oh, please, my goodness.
22673360	22675360	I almost didn't make it there.
22675360	22677360	I did that.
22677360	22681360	Okay, then do this.
22681360	22683360	And I missed, so that's okay.
22683360	22685360	We just need to do it go around a bit.
22685360	22689360	Oh, well, maybe we're going to just straight up attack this one.
22689360	22693360	I missed.
22693360	22695360	Whoa.
22695360	22701360	Hopefully there is checkpoints because that does seem very harsh.
22701360	22704400	I completely, I did, I will admit, I twided it all up.
22704400	22706400	I'm going to get my own.
22706400	22708400	I need a fire right now.
22708400	22710400	Oh, goodness me.
22710400	22712400	Goodness, gravy.
22712400	22714400	They didn't even make this game easy.
22714400	22716400	There we go.
22716400	22718400	Destroyed that one.
22718400	22722400	Honestly, this section was a lot harder on paper, I think.
22722400	22724400	There.
22726400	22728400	There.
22728400	22730400	All right, now what?
22731920	22735920	Only if you die, you have to repeat home missions if you play a port.
22738400	22740400	A checkpoint at the start of the bomb.
22740400	22742400	Destroy the bomber.
22742400	22743360	Where?
22743360	22745360	Oh, I see.
22745360	22747360	Speedrun over there.
22747360	22749360	Can we aimbot it?
22749360	22751360	Three, two, one.
22751360	22753360	Oh, I think that was a miss.
22753360	22755360	A swinging a miss.
22755360	22757360	Swinging a miss, swinging a miss.
22757360	22759360	Hold on, let's try again.
22759360	22761360	Wow, I cannot control this right now.
22761360	22763360	I'm completely looking in the wrong direction.
22765360	22767360	I...
22767360	22769360	Bruv.
22769360	22771360	Bruv.
22771360	22773360	Bruv.
22773360	22775360	Bruv.
22775360	22777360	Yeah, okay.
22777360	22779360	Controls, please, thank you.
22779360	22781360	Oh, no, there's more.
22781360	22783360	Okay, okay, it's okay.
22783360	22785360	It's okay.
22785360	22787360	I'm just trying to set a fire along the way.
22787360	22789360	I am... Hello, game?
22789360	22791360	Respond, please.
22791360	22793360	I missed, and it's okay.
22793360	22795360	It's okay.
22797360	22799360	We're gonna bomb that, get a bit of speed.
22799360	22801360	Whoa!
22801360	22803360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
22803360	22805360	Whoa.
22805360	22807360	Hello, game?
22807360	22809360	Relax, relax.
22809360	22811360	Game.
22811360	22813360	I don't think...
22813360	22815360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
22815360	22817360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
22817360	22819360	Game?
22819360	22821360	What was that velocity?
22821360	22823360	It was completely unnecessary, are you sure?
22823360	22825360	Game, up, put me up.
22825360	22827360	Put me up, put me up, put me up.
22827360	22829360	I want uppies, so I can aim.
22829360	22831360	I missed.
22831360	22833360	Oh, whoa, I actually hit that.
22835360	22837360	Wow.
22837360	22839360	That was crazy.
22839360	22841360	I don't think I was supposed to fly that high.
22841360	22843360	That was insane.
22843360	22845360	Oops, played it out of order.
22845360	22847360	Where's this, a horse?
22847360	22849360	Okay, turn around.
22849360	22851360	Every now and then I get...
22851360	22853360	Oh, I was too early.
22853360	22855360	Maybe there then?
22855360	22857360	Yes.
22857360	22859360	Yeah. Okay, that wasn't bad.
22859360	22861360	That wasn't horrific.
22861360	22863360	Whoa.
22863360	22865360	That was a crazy boost.
22865360	22867360	I don't think I was supposed to go that high.
22867360	22869360	I think the game mathematics...
22869360	22871360	It's way...
22871360	22873360	I don't think I was supposed to go that high.
22875360	22877360	Okay.
22879360	22881360	Because cool guys don't look
22881360	22883360	back at explosions.
22883360	22885360	Well, we did it.
22885360	22887360	That was not easy.
22887360	22889360	That was not fast.
22889360	22891360	I am going to open it up in the DNA sequence
22891360	22893360	to see if it's like, replay that section.
22893360	22895360	If it is,
22895360	22897360	then 100% is still on board.
22897360	22899360	If it's not, then 100% is like a much less likely
22899360	22901360	because this is getting hard.
22901360	22903360	This is getting tricky.
22925360	22927360	The whole thing.
22927360	22929360	I was worried it would say that.
22933360	22935360	I was so worried it was going to say that.
22943360	22945360	Look, we'll do what we can.
22947360	22949360	We'll finish the other Leonardo missions
22949360	22951360	and that.
22951360	22953360	But yeah.
22953360	22955360	This is going to be...
22955360	22957360	I don't...
22957360	22959360	That has just like dramatically
22959360	22961360	decreased the odds of being able to
22961360	22963360	100% it.
22963360	22965360	To go through all of that section again,
22965360	22967360	I was taking my time poisoning guards
22967360	22969360	along the way so I didn't have any issues.
22971360	22973360	That one attempt
22973360	22975360	and we got hit immediately.
22975360	22977360	That was the only time we got hit as well
22977360	22979360	which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure
22979360	22981360	what the controls were.
22981360	22983360	That was so rough.
22983360	22985360	Come on, that hurts.
22985360	22987360	And that is why a late game gives more check.
22987360	22989360	Literally, that is so...
22991360	22993360	punishing.
22995360	22997360	Wait, can you 100% this game without being online?
22997360	22999360	Yes, the DNA sequence is what we're 100%
22999360	23001360	doing 100% of the memories and stuff.
23001360	23003360	I'm currently
23003360	23005360	63%
23005360	23007360	which isn't bad at all.
23007360	23009360	However,
23009360	23011360	I was under the assumption
23011360	23013360	the game was a bit more forgiving.
23013360	23015360	However, we've just kind of
23015360	23017360	discovered
23017360	23019360	the replayability checkpoints aren't
23019360	23021360	necessarily all there on certain
23021360	23023360	missions and
23023360	23025360	that is just so...
23025360	23027360	I don't know.
23027360	23029360	I don't know.
23029360	23031360	Let me see that.
23031360	23033360	Okay, go ahead.
23033360	23035360	Remember trying to
23035360	23037360	platinum the game.
23037360	23039360	Achieving wise...
23039360	23041360	I don't know if you need 100% DNA
23041360	23043360	for the achievements.
23043360	23045360	War machines
23045360	23047360	are infamous for a reason.
23047360	23049360	Yeah.
23049360	23051360	There's a difference between 100% and 100%
23051360	23053360	achievements.
23053360	23055360	So, yeah.
23055360	23057360	I thought we could maybe attempt
23057360	23059360	100% the DNA sequence
23059360	23061360	but, yeah.
23061360	23063360	It ain't looking good.
23063360	23065360	I mean, how long? Oh, it's already been 6 hours?
23065360	23067360	What the heck?
23067360	23069360	Okay.
23069360	23071360	Yeah, I didn't...
23071360	23073360	I thought I was only going to...
23073360	23075360	What was I supposed to do?
23075360	23077360	Use a kick attack against
23077360	23079360	the overseer. I
23079360	23081360	literally thought...
23081360	23083360	um...
23083360	23085360	If you don't do it in a movie,
23085360	23087360	this should be a thing you come back to
23087360	23089360	at a later time. I think so.
23089360	23091360	I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in a row
23091360	23093360	is a bit too much.
23093360	23095360	But I'm perfectly happy to
23095360	23097360	come across the save fail. That's not a problem.
23097360	23099360	What was I supposed to do? Kick him.
23107360	23109360	Oh, no.
23109360	23111360	No, we're not doing this.
23115360	23117360	We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone.
23117360	23119360	You're scaring me.
23125360	23127360	Whoa! I actually dodged that successfully.
23127360	23129360	But the game said no.
23129360	23131360	So...
23131360	23133360	Oh, there you go.
23133360	23135360	A true lover of this game with 100%...
23135360	23137360	Oh, steady on. Have you seen what the requirements are
23137360	23139360	on some of the missions?
23139360	23141360	Oh!
23141360	23143360	Is there a wee bit of a...
23143360	23145360	Is there a wee bit much for me, honestly?
23145360	23147360	Like, I love this game.
23147360	23149360	But, I think
23149360	23151360	definitely
23151360	23153360	wouldn't mind coming back to
23153360	23155360	it. But I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
23155360	23157360	in a row maybe ain't the choice.
23157360	23159360	We'll try Needy Streamer
23159360	23161360	and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow.
23161360	23163360	Which means I can
23163360	23165360	go get the
23165360	23167360	sweets that I'm using
23167360	23169360	for that hand cam stream. I need to, like, prepare
23169360	23171360	for it and saw.
23171360	23173360	I don't even know what to wear.
23173360	23175360	Hee hee. I'm actually gonna have to put clothes
23175360	23177360	on for one. See ya, pee.
23179360	23181360	I don't even know.
23181360	23183360	I don't even know what to wear.
23183360	23185360	And one achievement
23185360	23187360	requires you to reach level 50 in multiplayer.
23187360	23189360	Oh, yeah, no, no. Not those achievements,
23189360	23191360	like the DNA season.
23191360	23193360	I'll be girlin' up neek.
23193360	23195360	Pants, sewer, cry, mutually.
23195360	23197360	Have to is a
23197360	23199360	strong word.
23199360	23201360	I think I have to.
23201360	23203360	Open one of the first three games.
23203360	23205360	The Borgia have constructed a deadly
23205360	23207360	naval war machine based on Leonardo's design
23207360	23209360	and must be destroyed before
23209360	23211360	Chesery.
23211360	23213360	The jeans.
23213360	23215360	Talk to Eduardo.
23215360	23217360	Ed Uardo.
23217360	23219360	Ed Uardo.
23219360	23221360	I assume this is a don't get caught.
23221360	23223360	It's giving don't get caught.
23223360	23225360	Yeah.
23227360	23229360	I'm just a little fish.
23229360	23231360	Look, look, look.
23231360	23233360	No, I'm a fish.
23233360	23235360	You didn't see me.
23235360	23237360	I'm just a fish.
23237360	23239360	Fish, fish, fish, fish.
23239360	23241360	Swimming in the deep canal.
23241360	23243360	Canal.
23243360	23245360	Fish, fish, fish, fish.
23245360	23247360	Fish, fish, fish, fish.
23247360	23249360	I'm excellent.
23249360	23251360	If you hold the block button with the
23251360	23253360	floor ball and the horse coming out,
23253360	23255360	you can knock the raider down.
23255360	23257360	Oh, it says gasman prayer.
23257360	23259360	Me, through, through.
23259360	23261360	E.
23261360	23263360	Clothes strong.
23263360	23265360	I have six.
23265360	23267360	Oh.
23269360	23271360	Baby.
23271360	23273360	It's you.
23273360	23275360	Hello.
23275360	23277360	I would like you to take me on the canal.
23277360	23279360	Oh.
23279360	23281360	You are the assassin, am I right?
23281360	23283360	You must stop Chesery.
23283360	23285360	I will help you.
23285360	23287360	Let me take you to them.
23287360	23289360	Oh.
23289360	23291360	Like I said, I chose life today.
23291360	23293360	Thank you.
23295360	23297360	Uh.
23297360	23299360	Interacting with the gondola
23299360	23301360	will cause desynchronization.
23303360	23305360	I scratch my nose.
23307360	23309360	How tall are you?
23309360	23311360	162 centimeters.
23311360	23313360	Um.
23313360	23315360	Taller than
23315360	23317360	smoke bomb
23317360	23319360	disables guards. Assassin or sleep
23319360	23321360	fort wears off.
23321360	23323360	Um.
23323360	23325360	Excuse me.
23325360	23327360	Am I not allowed to kill?
23327360	23329360	No, I am.
23329360	23331360	So why not?
23335360	23337360	Uh, the gate.
23337360	23339360	What am I supposed to do here?
23339360	23341360	Nothing.
23341360	23343360	Oh, he just jumped on. I saw that.
23343360	23345360	I thought I saw that.
23347360	23349360	Oh.
23349360	23351360	Uh.
23351360	23353360	Okay.
23353360	23355360	Okay, okay, we're getting it.
23355360	23357360	Taller than a smoke bomb.
23357360	23359360	What's that?
23359360	23361360	Banana or freedom? Uh, 5-3?
23365360	23367360	I've not played Assassin's
23367360	23369360	orgy, no.
23369360	23371360	You're like me, also.
23371360	23373360	It's just a weird class.
23373360	23375360	It's just no flood me.
23375360	23377360	Okay, something's a flood.
23377360	23379360	I'm so sorry.
23379360	23381360	I just pushed that man in the water
23381360	23383360	and he drowned. I will say one thing though.
23383360	23385360	If you're a gondola pusher
23385360	23387360	and you don't know how to swim, isn't that
23387360	23389360	a bit dangerous?
23389360	23391360	Isn't that a bit silly?
23393360	23395360	I didn't even realize I was supposed to be up here, also.
23399360	23401360	Whoa, wait, why can he see me?
23401360	23403360	I thought we'd purposely put these beams here
23403360	23405360	so you can't get seen by the guards below.
23407360	23409360	Hmm.
23409360	23411360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
23411360	23413360	My pard in my bag.
23415360	23417360	Look at that. Just so you know.
23417360	23419360	Where is it?
23419360	23421360	Oh.
23421360	23423360	Pitching him wasn't the problem.
23423360	23425360	It was like you touched the boat.
23425360	23427360	I can't believe it. Fending Nemo?
23427360	23429360	I touched the boat.
23431360	23433360	How many slower, mate?
23437360	23439360	Okay.
23441360	23443360	Okay.
23443360	23445360	Are you coming?
23457360	23459360	The frickin' twat
23459360	23461360	from across the street saw me.
23463360	23465360	Yeah, you do that all the way again.
23465360	23467360	You'd be surprised.
23467360	23469360	I was in the Navy and it only passed the swim test
23469360	23471360	because the
23471360	23473360	Proctor wanted me to go home.
23473360	23475360	Jeez.
23479360	23481360	I think if you're Scottish, you have to learn to swim.
23481360	23483360	You're forced to go swimming.
23483360	23485360	Let's just run ahead of this guard
23485360	23487360	because he can't see me at the corner of his eye.
23487360	23489360	But I get out of range,
23489360	23491360	which is good.
23491360	23493360	Gondola logging.
23493360	23495360	I've only got five poisons.
23497360	23499360	I could probably just
23499360	23501360	do that, man.
23501360	23503360	I've got 19 crossbow bolts.
23503360	23505360	They're quiet. I don't get it.
23505360	23507360	So it's all good.
23515360	23517360	That's fine.
23517360	23519360	That's fine.
23519360	23521360	So who?
23527360	23529360	Okay, so this time the frickin' guy doesn't notice me?
23529360	23531360	Yeah, that's what I thought, mate.
23531360	23533360	I'm such a wee liar, honestly.
23537360	23539360	He doesn't even spot me this time.
23539360	23541360	Sting.
23549360	23551360	I'm set to Scotland.
23551360	23553360	We've got school soon enough.
23555360	23557360	Oh, I need to go up.
23563360	23565360	So you're going to see me?
23565360	23567360	He is, so I kind of need to deal with you.
23567360	23569360	Sorry, but you're in my way, son.
23569360	23571360	You're in my way.
23571360	23573360	You're in my way.
23579360	23581360	You're in my way.
23587360	23589360	Poison, huh?
23589360	23591360	Just to get around the corner successfully.
23591360	23593360	The Bluetooth device is...
23593360	23595360	Why did you not go up?
23595360	23597360	Go up.
23597360	23599360	Go up and along.
23599360	23601360	There we go.
23601360	23603360	Much better.
23603360	23605360	How's your gaming going?
23605360	23607360	We MLG gamers out here.
23607360	23609360	Unfortunately,
23611360	23613360	I believe the 100%
23613360	23615360	will not happen this stream.
23617360	23619360	I did not anticipate
23621360	23623360	how hard this game is.
23623360	23625360	Because I've never attempted it before.
23625360	23627360	I genuinely don't know how it goes.
23627360	23629360	Right, I'm going to poison him and the other...
23631360	23633360	Eh?
23633360	23635360	Eh?
23637360	23639360	I almost deseed,
23639360	23641360	but I think I hit a checkpoint.
23643360	23645360	I didn't...
23647360	23649360	I'm going to show you now.
23649360	23651360	I don't even know how you saw me.
23651360	23653360	I'm up here.
23653360	23655360	They're not supposed to be able to see you from up here.
23659360	23661360	Yeah, like that guy really...
23661360	23663360	There's like more to go.
23663360	23665360	Oh, that...
23665360	23667360	Get me in the war!
23667360	23669360	No!
23677360	23679360	I like that.
23681360	23683360	That's a pretty good detail, huh?
23683360	23685360	No...
23685360	23687360	No...
23687360	23689360	It seems literally drowning right now.
23689360	23691360	He needs to catch a breath of
23691360	23693360	frickin' air.
23693360	23695360	Making him go under.
23695360	23697360	Oh, goodness me.
23697360	23699360	I don't know what to make of that.
23699360	23701360	Oh, goodness me.
23701360	23703360	They're not making this one easy, are they?
23707360	23709360	Oh, my goodness.
23711360	23713360	He took his sword out.
23713360	23715360	I heard it, but he needs to breathe
23715360	23717360	or else he pops up for too long!
23717360	23719360	He needs to breathe.
23719360	23721360	I need to breathe just thinking
23721360	23723360	about how long he's holding his breath, honestly.
23725360	23727360	Please don't do that animation
23727360	23729360	where you can't breathe.
23731360	23733360	We did it.
23733360	23735360	Oh, for goodness sake, there's more!
23743360	23745360	Breathe, exhale, breathe.
23745360	23747360	Oh!
23747360	23749360	Well done!
23749360	23753360	One, two, three...
23753360	23755360	One!
23755360	23757360	Okay, I think maybe I can
23757360	23759360	kill those ones
23759360	23761360	because that was really rough, right?
23761360	23763360	See, that was too much breath holding.
23763360	23765360	Any breathers in chat?
23765360	23767360	We stayed around.
23767360	23769360	Mm-hmm.
23769360	23771360	I'm going to Scotland in 2D.
23771360	23773360	Whoa, wait, how far back are we?
23775360	23777360	Huh.
23777360	23779360	That's pretty far back.
23783360	23785360	Okay, that guy doesn't care.
23785360	23787360	Oh!
23787360	23789360	I've just wasted so much time
23789360	23791360	dropping myself back here, but who...
23791360	23793360	Breathing is overrated, honestly.
23797360	23799360	I know the game's telling me to swim under this,
23799360	23801360	but, like, it takes so much freaking time.
23801360	23803360	Like, that guy is going so fast
23803360	23805360	in his wee gondola.
23805360	23807360	Like, he knows that I'm literally trying
23807360	23809360	to swim behind him in time.
23809360	23811360	He's such a lot, like...
23811360	23813360	You know I'm freaking behind you.
23813360	23815360	Slow it down!
23817360	23819360	Literally, I'm trying to, like, silently swim.
23819360	23821360	It's not even possible.
23825360	23827360	I think if I just hang off
23827360	23829360	the pier and assassinate him,
23829360	23831360	this is the best way forward for this.
23831360	23833360	Sorry, mate, but time's up.
23835360	23837360	Okay, yeah, that is far more easier.
23837360	23839360	I just need to do it to the other guy on the pier.
23839360	23841360	Sorry!
23843360	23845360	Oxygen addicts, honestly.
23845360	23847360	Can't get enough of it.
23847360	23849360	You're so greedy, huh?
23849360	23851360	So greedy for more...
23851360	23853360	more oxygen.
23855360	23857360	Okay, let's dive.
23857360	23859360	And then breathe.
23859360	23861360	And then dive.
23861360	23863360	And then breathe.
23863360	23865360	And then yank.
23865360	23867360	Ezio, please do not go on the platform
23867360	23869360	when it comes to assassinating...
23869360	23871360	freaking gods!
23873360	23875360	Ezio.
23875360	23877360	You knew!
23877360	23879360	Fine well. I was asking you to pull him
23879360	23881360	into the water.
23881360	23883360	Not get on the platform
23883360	23885360	where the freaking AI
23885360	23887360	is so sensitive
23887360	23889360	and on the lookout
23889360	23891360	on freaking...
23891360	23893360	YOU FREAKING FREAKS!
23893360	23895360	Right, I'm just a serious
23895360	23897360	assassinating spam, honestly.
23897360	23899360	Game knows... oh, and he's gonna
23899360	23901360	fuck you.
23905360	23907360	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
23907360	23909360	And I'm out of honey tea
23909360	23911360	and I'm sad that I can't have
23911360	23913360	a freaking honey tube.
23913360	23915360	Gonna have to go to the shops.
23917360	23919360	Okay.
23921360	23923360	Right, I can take my time to this segment.
23923360	23925360	I've never been caught at it yet
23925360	23927360	so let's not go caught now.
23927360	23929360	We swimming!
23929360	23931360	Any swimmers?
23931360	23933360	You got any swimmers for me?
23933360	23935360	Shopping.
23935360	23937360	That's how it is, just that, honestly.
23937360	23939360	I feel like if I fast swim
23939360	23941360	I might alert him.
23941360	23943360	Now, if I am correct
23943360	23945360	what the problem was
23945360	23947360	is that I assassinated here.
23947360	23949360	I need to hang off and then assassinate.
23949360	23951360	Yeah!
23951360	23953360	But you knew exactly what I wanted to
23953360	23955360	achieve, so don't even look at me, okay?
23955360	23957360	Don't interact with the gondola.
23957360	23959360	Me swimmers!
23959360	23961360	My story.
23963360	23965360	Alright, let's...
23965360	23967360	Okay.
23973360	23975360	Why is he gulping?
23975360	23977360	I'm not even diving in.
23977360	23979360	Okay.
23979360	23981360	Hang off the ledge, please.
23981360	23983360	One assassination, please.
23983360	23985360	Back in the war.
23985360	23987360	Dive.
23987360	23989360	Dive over the ropes.
23989360	23991360	Don't be afraid.
23991360	23993360	Don't be afraid of the ropes.
23993360	23995360	That was very talented.
24009360	24011360	My life flash before my...
24011360	24013360	Someone say ropes.
24013360	24015360	She's still alive.
24015360	24017360	Especially not past that drunk.
24017360	24019360	I don't know if you're drunk.
24019360	24021360	I was not supposed to...
24021360	24023360	That's all I want to see, baby.
24025360	24027360	Okay, there we go.
24029360	24031360	Detection is now permitted.
24031360	24033360	Yee-haw!
24033360	24035360	Time to perish, boys!
24039360	24041360	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want some of this?
24043360	24045360	I kicked it.
24045360	24047360	Actually, I need to disarm guards
24047360	24049360	and kill them with their own weapon.
24049360	24051360	Let's do that.
24051360	24053360	Give me that sword, please.
24053360	24055360	Yee, thank you very much.
24055360	24057360	Drop object.
24057360	24059360	And then we're going to do it again.
24059360	24061360	Can I steal your weapon?
24061360	24063360	Oh, it's not fighting over the weapon.
24063360	24065360	Okay, there we go.
24065360	24067360	He wouldn't go over it, honestly.
24067360	24069360	I wouldn't go my weapon to if I had one.
24069360	24071360	Now I'm chilling, cleaning up and watching
24071360	24073360	because I love these people.
24073360	24075360	Azura said she played it as well.
24075360	24077360	Emmy said she got it as gifted,
24077360	24079360	but she never played it.
24081360	24083360	Good night.
24083360	24085360	Those who rest, thank you for hanging in.
24089360	24091360	I love when I can be detected.
24091360	24093360	It's so fun.
24095360	24097360	Come on, who wants to first, then?
24099360	24101360	Okay, there you go.
24101360	24103360	Oh, no, don't grab me. Who wants to first?
24103360	24105360	You!
24107360	24109360	Ugh!
24109360	24111360	Take that.
24111360	24113360	And this!
24113360	24115360	And you're another one!
24115360	24117360	I love the crisscross kill.
24117360	24119360	It's so cool.
24119360	24121360	Oh, wait, I'm actually going to loot because those were pretty high.
24121360	24123360	Guard.
24127360	24129360	These guys act like they understand you're the main character
24129360	24131360	on a flittle.
24137360	24139360	Okay.
24139360	24141360	I thought I got more poison holdings.
24153360	24155360	Once we've done other Leonardo missions,
24155360	24157360	I think we'll do all of the factions
24157360	24159360	because I want to dress up my Assassin's Creed guild.
24163360	24165360	So it's girly pop, you know what I'm saying?
24167360	24169360	How do I get up there?
24169360	24171360	Or do I just leap?
24171360	24173360	Do I do a leap?
24173360	24175360	Oh, that was a big leap.
24175360	24177360	I don't think you should have been able to do that.
24177360	24179360	Hey, ho.
24179360	24181360	You can't see me because you're dead by the time
24181360	24183360	you process it. It's me!
24183360	24185360	Daddy's home!
24185360	24187360	Let's loot.
24187360	24189360	He may have poison on him.
24191360	24193360	They accepted that.
24197360	24199360	I'm going to go see you in the morning.
24199360	24201360	Oh, that's hilarious.
24201360	24203360	I'm focusing on that now.
24203360	24205360	Literally, good night. See you in the morning.
24205360	24207360	I'll still be online. Sweet dreams.
24207360	24209360	Have a good rest.
24209360	24211360	I'll still be here on Assassin's Creed on my knees.
24215360	24217360	Daddy's home.
24219360	24221360	They're more like guidelines than actual rules.
24227360	24229360	Oh, I do love this game.
24233360	24235360	That reason I did go watch
24235360	24237360	and get him out of it alive.
24249360	24251360	What's this?
24253360	24255360	What a switch.
24257360	24259360	Wow, I have to switch between rowing
24259360	24261360	and aiming.
24261360	24263360	I mean, I guess I comprehend that.
24263360	24265360	But, sheesh.
24265360	24267360	Oh, we're taking down ships!
24269360	24271360	Boo Templars.
24271360	24273360	Stinky Templars.
24273360	24275360	Switch, fire!
24275360	24277360	Oh my gosh, that's so cool.
24277360	24279360	Okay, sales destroyed.
24279360	24281360	That makes sense.
24281360	24283360	Won that one?
24283360	24285360	I only hit one of them there.
24285360	24287360	I'm getting wrecked right now.
24289360	24291360	All done.
24291360	24293360	Bye-bye!
24293360	24295360	Okay, okay, I like it. I'm digging it.
24295360	24297360	I'm digging it.
24297360	24299360	Oh my gosh!
24299360	24301360	They're like ragdolling off the ship.
24303360	24305360	Okay, that was cool.
24305360	24307360	I enjoyed that.
24307360	24309360	Yo ho ho.
24309360	24311360	It's a pirate's life for me.
24311360	24313360	A tweedalidum.
24313360	24315360	A tweedalidum.
24315360	24317360	Tweedalidiliwi.
24317360	24319360	I don't know the words. I just know the shanty.
24319360	24321360	Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho!
24325360	24327360	Okay, it looks like there's just three.
24327360	24331360	And I have plenty of health, so that's fine.
24333360	24335360	Give me fuel in my fire.
24335360	24337360	Give me burning.
24337360	24339360	Put some oil in my land.
24339360	24341360	Eye free.
24341360	24343360	Okay.
24343360	24345360	Can I do it from here?
24347360	24349360	Possibly.
24349360	24351360	Can I do all three though?
24353360	24355360	I think I'm gonna have to go a bit closer to this one.
24355360	24357360	At the back here.
24357360	24359360	I think that's it.
24359360	24361360	That should be good.
24361360	24363360	No? I didn't hit it?
24363360	24365360	Oopsies.
24365360	24367360	Okay, there we go.
24383360	24385360	I don't think you can go back through,
24385360	24387360	so we're just gonna...
24387360	24389360	do our thing.
24391360	24393360	You are now notorious,
24393360	24395360	for throwing high alert.
24395360	24397360	I should hope so.
24397360	24399360	Because I'm still here.
24399360	24401360	Oh, they knocked me off my gun.
24401360	24403360	I don't even know what to do about it.
24403360	24405360	Hold on, lads. I need to rotate before I destroy his.
24405360	24407360	Dude, give me a second.
24407360	24409360	We just need to rotate.
24409360	24411360	I actually don't think I can hit it from this distance.
24411360	24413360	You know that?
24413360	24415360	Ow, I'm...
24415360	24417360	Wait, whoa, what's happening?
24417360	24419360	Okay, hold on.
24419360	24421360	Hold on. We need to do a big old circle around.
24421360	24423360	Cause...
24423360	24425360	I'm like...
24425360	24427360	too close.
24427360	24429360	To even hit this stuff.
24431360	24433360	Honestly, black flag will take through.
24439360	24441360	Going reverse is so slow.
24441360	24443360	Can you go backwards?
24443360	24445360	I don't even know if you can.
24445360	24447360	I'll try. We're just in the old spin around.
24447360	24449360	Did that hit?
24449360	24451360	I hope so.
24453360	24455360	Almost.
24455360	24457360	There we go. Beautiful, beautiful.
24457360	24459360	And last but not least,
24459360	24461360	let's not get too close now.
24461360	24463360	Let's not get too close.
24463360	24465360	We've still got some momentum.
24469360	24471360	One more roll should do it.
24471360	24473360	Get us front row seats to this pirate ship going down.
24477360	24479360	Oh.
24479360	24481360	Ow, ow, ow. They're hurting me.
24481360	24483360	They're hurting me.
24485360	24487360	Just out of range. Hold on.
24489360	24491360	I'm like just there and no more.
24491360	24493360	Ow, you guys are hurting me.
24493360	24495360	You're giving me a booboo.
24499360	24501360	Just out of range.
24501360	24503360	That was so close.
24503360	24505360	A little bit of a push.
24505360	24507360	Get too close to the point where I can't even fucking aim.
24509360	24511360	There we go.
24511360	24513360	We got it.
24513360	24515360	It literally is your tank in all the arrows.
24515360	24517360	That was kind of comedic
24517360	24519360	the way they jumped off the ship.
24523360	24525360	How are they not lunch on you?
24525360	24527360	Honestly, there's literally cannonballs.
24529360	24531360	Literally BRB.
24531360	24533360	Sorry, I can't aim at your shields. Let me just do a little spin around.
24533360	24535360	Ooh.
24535360	24537360	Oh, we're shooting at itself.
24541360	24543360	Wow.
24549360	24551360	Splish splash.
24551360	24553360	I was ticking fast.
24553360	24555360	Oh, we actually got 100% sync for that.
24555360	24557360	Okay, I'll take it.
24559360	24561360	I used to love this game.
24561360	24563360	It has a fantastic taste.
24563360	24565360	This is my number one game of all time.
24565360	24567360	And I suck at it.
24571360	24573360	Is there one more Leonardo mission?
24573360	24575360	Yes.
24579360	24581360	How are they always on the opposite place?
24587360	24589360	There's one.
24589360	24591360	This is Leonardo.
24591360	24593360	And then we'll get the Guilds Faction Femme.
24597360	24599360	Tank tank tank.
24599360	24601360	You are good at sucking.
24613360	24615360	Sorry, I'm making an animated shot
24615360	24617360	of your reference sheet for the meme tag.
24617360	24619360	Should I bring in the tweet?
24623360	24625360	I don't know when it comes to
24625360	24627360	memification of something.
24627360	24629360	You don't have to credit the original artist.
24629360	24631360	I don't know. What do you guys think?
24631360	24633360	You're probably better known than me.
24633360	24635360	I did credit her right under the
24635360	24637360	thingy so people know
24637360	24639360	it is by her under the reference sheet
24639360	24641360	at all times.
24641360	24643360	I don't know.
24643360	24645360	These hay bales
24645360	24647360	were so confusing actually.
24649360	24651360	One of the games I love the most
24651360	24653360	is called Dynasty Warriors.
24653360	24655360	AC Brotherhood was the last game I
24655360	24657360	truly played in the series.
24657360	24659360	Yeah, Revelations was alright.
24659360	24661360	But
24661360	24663360	it wasn't Brotherhood.
24667360	24669360	If I had to rank them as Brotherhood
24669360	24671360	then AC2 and then Revelations for
24671360	24673360	Exo's storyline.
24673360	24675360	I went on an adventure trying to beat
24675360	24677360	all of this
24677360	24679360	but I stopped at Syndicate.
24681360	24683360	I think I've played Assassin's Creed 3
24683360	24685360	maybe unironically three times.
24687360	24689360	It's just no fun.
24693360	24695360	ACR had
24695360	24697360	a fucking turret defense.
24697360	24699360	Literally the turret defense.
24699360	24701360	Do slash credit.
24701360	24703360	Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's
24703360	24704360	not like
24704360	24705360	bothering.
24705360	24707360	But the credit is there for people who do
24707360	24709360	want to use it.
24709360	24711360	Yeah, people say they love Black Flag.
24711360	24713360	I struggled so much to get into it.
24713360	24715360	But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm a
24715360	24717360	little crybaby because AC wasn't
24717360	24719360	in the series anymore.
24719360	24721360	Which is very plausible.
24721360	24723360	I wouldn't mind to try and get
24723360	24725360	Black Flag. One more big hood.
24725360	24727360	Yeah.
24729360	24731360	But I just
24731360	24733360	really seem to struggle with the controls
24733360	24735360	but it's probably because I'm doing
24735360	24737360	the, well I've already played Assassin's Creed
24737360	24739360	so I don't need to sit and read the controls
24739360	24741360	well obviously they have changed the controls.
24743360	24745360	I'm
24745360	24747360	you're being a crybaby.
24751360	24753360	I wish they would make
24753360	24755360	more like story multiplayer games.
24755360	24757360	Like
24757360	24759360	it takes to
24759360	24761360	is like such a good story
24761360	24763360	thing and I would absolutely love to
24763360	24765360	play games like that on stream and be like
24765360	24767360	okay after the first chapter we'll get
24767360	24769360	someone else in, okay next chapter we'll
24769360	24771360	get someone else in but like they just
24771360	24773360	didn't do that. They just didn't do that.
24775360	24777360	It's so annoying.
24777360	24779360	It's so frustrating.
24779360	24781360	I can't believe I can't play video games
24781360	24783360	exactly the way I want to
24783360	24785360	play them.
24785360	24787360	It's such a baby.
24791360	24793360	Kill the Templar overseer to recover map.
24793360	24795360	Use the pistol.
24797360	24799360	I can do that.
24811360	24813360	No.
24813360	24815360	Yes. No.
24815360	24817360	Yes.
24821360	24823360	Yeah I was going to say you sure you want to
24823360	24825360	fight this. Oh wow
24825360	24827360	it's always you guys that want to fight.
24827360	24829360	Stop this.
24829360	24831360	Fuck it Sam.
24831360	24833360	Not really.
24833360	24835360	I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back.
24837360	24839360	I've been having a blast
24839360	24841360	watching a veteran on a newcomer play the
24841360	24843360	Halo.
24843360	24845360	Oh yeah the Halo campaign
24845360	24847360	is going to be playable.
24855360	24857360	Where am I supposed to go?
24857360	24859360	Okay last one question mark I think.
24859360	24861360	Is it like
24861360	24863360	safe to do
24863360	24865360	a Halo campaign?
24865360	24867360	That would be really cool to do a
24867360	24869360	refling. It's not going to lie.
24869360	24871360	I'd be pretty hyped for that.
24871360	24873360	But I don't know how safe it is to like add
24873360	24875360	people.
24875360	24877360	Because I don't think I can just instance and
24877360	24879360	have you guys in.
24879360	24881360	It would be pretty cool to like
24881360	24887360	I don't, is it
24887360	24889360	duo only or is it four man?
24893360	24895360	Favorite game combat of
24895360	24897360	is it evolved or
24897360	24899360	evolution?
24901360	24903360	Oh my gosh
24903360	24905360	it's John Halo from Fortnight.
24905360	24907360	Laying out his tank
24907360	24909360	is an ambitious and devastating war machine
24909360	24911360	capable. Do not take any damage while in
24911360	24913360	the tank. Yeah good luck for that.
24913360	24915360	We're not doing this one.
24915360	24917360	But you know
24925360	24927360	I have name poison
24927360	24929360	which is decent.
24939360	24941360	Is he going to come see me?
24941360	24943360	Oops.
24943360	24945360	Yeah we're not doing that.
24945360	24947360	Literally everyone's getting poisoned.
24947360	24949360	I don't care.
24951360	24953360	I only have name to watch.
24953360	24955360	I should have bought some more at a healer.
24959360	24961360	Yeah maybe if
24961360	24963360	it's safe to add people like on Halo
24963360	24965360	then we could do
24965360	24967360	playthroughs of that but
24967360	24969360	I guess you
24969360	24971360	do it mission by mission so like we would do one
24971360	24973360	mission and then
24973360	24975360	kick out and then add
24975360	24977360	and then next mission kick out
24977360	24979360	you know.
24981360	24983360	You see nothing.
24987360	24989360	How did you guys not shoot?
24989360	24991360	It's a poison dart so it's supposed to
24991360	24993360	just be like a little swing
24993360	24995360	and no one knows.
24995360	24997360	Literally poison is so OP for like when it
24997360	24999360	comes to don't be detected because you can walk
24999360	25001360	right in front of them and
25001360	25003360	obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing
25003360	25005360	but I don't know how to say it.
25005360	25007360	Poison's cool.
25007360	25009360	Oops sorry.
25009360	25011360	I was pulling down my sleeves
25011360	25013360	I'm getting a...
25013360	25015360	That's right I'm wearing a hoodie.
25015360	25017360	You'll never guess why.
25017360	25019360	Wait how am I supposed to see him?
25027360	25029360	I love how as soon as you go sideways
25029360	25031360	they just don't care anymore.
25039360	25041360	Beat up the architect.
25041360	25043360	Oh okay.
25045360	25047360	Hello.
25055360	25057360	You're so aggressive.
25057360	25059360	You just ask before beating up.
25069360	25071360	We're helping people.
25073360	25075360	Go home.
25077360	25079360	Checkpoint reached.
25079360	25081360	Amalo to be seen yet?
25083360	25085360	No.
25087360	25089360	This music is so dramatic.
25089360	25091360	Checking my heart for that.
25091360	25093360	You can go first.
25093360	25095360	Sucks to suck.
25095360	25097360	Sorry but if someone had to bear.
25099360	25101360	We could do two poisons here
25101360	25103360	just to be doubly sure.
25107360	25109360	We could probably do...
25109360	25111360	Can you? No I really...
25111360	25113360	Oh my god that alerted him?
25113360	25115360	No.
25115360	25117360	I need this guy to par...
25117360	25119360	Stop hurting!
25119360	25121360	And then in order to unsheathe my...
25125360	25127360	Right you're next.
25127360	25129360	You're freaking next.
25129360	25131360	Now that I can see you.
25131360	25133360	Jeez you're such a pain in my butt.
25133360	25135360	Not the good kind.
25135360	25137360	You're next.
25137360	25139360	You're all done.
25139360	25141360	And everyone's perished.
25141360	25143360	And my ankles are sore.
25143360	25145360	But it's fine.
25145360	25147360	We did it.
25147360	25149360	First thing I checked
25149360	25151360	was she still screaming for me.
25151360	25153360	No.
25153360	25155360	I would have gone the 14 hours
25155360	25157360	but it didn't work.
25157360	25159360	Free the mercenaries.
25159360	25161360	Can I still be...
25161360	25163360	Can't be spoilers?
25167360	25169360	So I don't even hear?
25169360	25171360	Doesn't look like it.
25171360	25173360	Hi mercenaries!
25173360	25175360	Where is Dabinchi's machine?
25175360	25177360	Follow us. They have hidden the path
25177360	25179360	but we discovered the entrance.
25179360	25181360	There you come lads.
25183360	25185360	Three mercenaries?
25185360	25187360	Oh not two.
25187360	25189360	Follow and protect them.
25189360	25191360	Well maybe if they didn't
25191360	25193360	jump right in front of the enemies.
25193360	25195360	Then sure.
25195360	25197360	Wait wait wait you're done.
25197360	25199360	I'm farting.
25199360	25201360	You're done.
25201360	25203360	Oh it's good to see me.
25205360	25207360	Hopefully they can actually fight a weaver.
25207360	25209360	No! Why are you fighting one of them?
25209360	25211360	Why is there...
25211360	25213360	Please stab them in the...
25213360	25215360	Oh and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
25215360	25217360	Stop it.
25217360	25219360	Stop it.
25225360	25227360	I hate when they do that right.
25227360	25229360	Where are you taking me?
25233360	25235360	Step eight Rizzo.
25235360	25237360	Fart in the guards faces.
25237360	25239360	Get him first!
25239360	25241360	Get him first! No you missed him!
25241360	25243360	You were supposed to get the other guards.
25243360	25245360	Right right we're farting again.
25245360	25247360	There we go.
25253360	25255360	I should have got that guy first actually.
25255360	25257360	Oh and he's right around the corner.
25257360	25259360	I'm just attracted to the tent.
25259360	25261360	Please just perish your one HP
25261360	25263360	in a freaking dream!
25263360	25265360	And it's not even registering
25265360	25267360	my kicks probably.
25267360	25269360	And that guy's getting beaten up by a brute.
25269360	25271360	Yeah they're done.
25271360	25273360	Can I loot in time for another
25273360	25275360	fart bomb because
25275360	25277360	we're needing them.
25277360	25279360	I got one. Okay I actually got one needed.
25291360	25293360	Let's go for it.
25293360	25295360	What's that?
25297360	25299360	Open inside?
25303360	25305360	Hold still.
25305360	25307360	Wait for me.
25307360	25309360	A little bit parkour.
25309360	25311360	A little bit parkour momentum.
25317360	25319360	Okay there we go.
25319360	25321360	Open for you.
25321360	25323360	Open sesame.
25329360	25331360	Did I just say open sesame?
25333360	25335360	No.
25337360	25339360	Remember that time
25339360	25341360	I got asked about open sesame?
25343360	25345360	And I said open cumin.
25345360	25347360	Good times.
25347360	25349360	I'm such an idiot.
25351360	25353360	I don't know if anyone remembers.
25355360	25357360	Saved!
25357360	25359360	Jeez it's you.
25359360	25361360	I did not think I would get here.
25365360	25367360	I don't know why my brain blank.
25369360	25371360	I think it was the way the question was worded.
25371360	25373360	I will lower the bridge.
25373360	25375360	Can I lower the bridge?
25375360	25377360	I guess I can.
25381360	25383360	Open sesame!
25383360	25385360	Or open cumin.
25385360	25387360	I don't know which one seems better than me.
25389360	25391360	I don't know.
25397360	25399360	Is there a lever?
25399360	25401360	I don't think so.
25405360	25407360	The way you recalled that.
25407360	25409360	Literally my brain was like
25409360	25411360	recalling memory loading.
25411360	25413360	Memory loaded.
25413360	25415360	It's open cinnamon.
25423360	25425360	Music?
25429360	25431360	Oh my god.
25431360	25433360	Hello?
25435360	25437360	Can I run people?
25437360	25439360	I must be able to run people over.
25439360	25441360	There's no way in heck.
25441360	25443360	Oh my god.
25443360	25445360	This is adorable.
25445360	25447360	Yeah, POV come.
25447360	25449360	Take that.
25453360	25455360	This is so cool.
25455360	25457360	I love this POV.
25457360	25459360	Maybe not.
25461360	25463360	I don't know what's behind it.
25463360	25465360	I assume that's what hurts me.
25465360	25467360	If I take damage.
25467360	25469360	I don't know.
25469360	25471360	100% a bunch.
25471360	25473360	That's unlucky.
25473360	25475360	Oh well.
25475360	25477360	Sorry, that's a lot easier to tell
25477360	25479360	what's coming up.
25479360	25481360	I'm sorry, I have to change camera angle.
25481360	25483360	I apologize.
25485360	25487360	After the 100%.
25487360	25489360	Are you squidding me right now?
25489360	25491360	Thank you for the tip.
25491360	25493360	What did you see?
25495360	25497360	Hold on.
25497360	25499360	I'm destroying things.
25499360	25501360	Wait, wait.
25501360	25503360	Thank you for the tip.
25503360	25505360	Why are you?
25505360	25507360	There's no way someone is standing up to a tank.
25507360	25509360	You have to be crazy to stand up to a tank.
25511360	25513360	Did they even do damage?
25521360	25523360	Oh, so you can dodge.
25523360	25525360	Let me pause.
25525360	25527360	I don't want to miss that.
25527360	25529360	I'm really dumb.
25529360	25531360	I'm going to forget.
25531360	25533360	I don't want to forgo.
25533360	25535360	No way.
25535360	25537360	Okay.
25537360	25539360	Hey Australia.
25539360	25541360	I'm back from work.
25541360	25543360	Yeah, I got tank tank.
25543360	25545360	Thank you for the tip.
25545360	25547360	I appreciate it.
25547360	25549360	Oh.
25549360	25551360	Man, just tank that whole cannonball.
25553360	25555360	I need help setting up alerts.
25555360	25557360	They barely work.
25557360	25559360	It's a bit of a nightmare to instrument elements,
25559360	25561360	but once you get it set up,
25561360	25563360	you never have to change it again.
25563360	25565360	And you can set up custom
25565360	25567360	things like if someone
25567360	25569360	donated like $69,
25569360	25571360	for example, you can get it to do.
25571360	25573360	Are we going in a battle dome?
25573360	25575360	Yes!
25575360	25577360	Yes!
25577360	25579360	Oh my god, tank battle dome!
25579360	25581360	Take this.
25581360	25583360	And this.
25583360	25585360	Hold on, I'm reloading.
25585360	25587360	And this.
25587360	25589360	Yes!
25589360	25591360	Oh my god, I love tank battle dome.
25591360	25593360	This is amazing.
25599360	25601360	More tank battle dome.
25601360	25603360	More tank battle dome.
25603360	25605360	There's something.
25605360	25607360	Let me in.
25607360	25609360	Let me in.
25609360	25611360	This is why I think of your factories.
25611360	25613360	Take this, capitalism.
25615360	25617360	Tanks! Tank battle dome!
25617360	25619360	No, no, you're not loading the tank.
25619360	25621360	You're not loading it.
25621360	25623360	Tank battle dome.
25623360	25625360	Tank battle dome.
25625360	25627360	I'm stuck on the cylinder box.
25627360	25629360	Tank battle dome.
25629360	25631360	Tank battle dome.
25633360	25635360	Oh, no, no, no, no.
25635360	25637360	Wait, wait, wait. Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.
25637360	25639360	Let me in.
25639360	25641360	Okay, there we go.
25641360	25643360	Tank battle dome.
25643360	25645360	Battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome.
25659360	25661360	Yeah, I don't know how I'm going to
25661360	25663360	think that. I'm not going to lie.
25663360	25665360	I ain't going, there's no way I'm 100%.
25665360	25667360	We can try and layer
25667360	25669360	streams, but
25669360	25671360	yeah, there's no shot. I'm doing it tonight.
25671360	25673360	Arrivederci.
25673360	25675360	Little tank.
25675360	25677360	No, I wish I could keep you.
25677360	25679360	I see we're so real for that.
25679360	25681360	That was fun.
25681360	25683360	I like tank battle dome.
25683360	25685360	Just don't take damage.
25685360	25687360	Five hits, honestly.
25687360	25689360	Someone was like, have you ever played the game modded before?
25689360	25691360	Me who mods it so I can't take damage
25691360	25693360	so I can do the no damage hits.
25693360	25695360	Runs.
25695360	25697360	Some of the
25697360	25699360	freaking 100%
25699360	25701360	are a bit outrageous, honestly.
25705360	25707360	Rest builders who have to go, if you need
25707360	25709360	to go sleepy, bye bye.
25709360	25711360	Strongly, I'm up for almost 36 hours.
25711360	25713360	I'm going to get some shy.
25713360	25715360	Oh my God, that's dangerous. Definitely get some rest.
25715360	25717360	My goodness.
25717360	25719360	Yes, we will have a wonderful stream.
25727360	25729360	It's dirty underwear.
25737360	25739360	Okay.
25739360	25741360	I think I know what we do with that.
25743360	25745360	I think I know
25745360	25747360	what we do with it.
25753360	25755360	99% sure I know what we do with it.
25757360	25759360	Y'all don't mind
25759360	25761360	what we go do right now.
25765360	25767360	That was Leonardo da Vinci, you're right.
25767360	25769360	You're not wrong.
25769360	25771360	Maybe I could have gone off that surface.
25775360	25777360	I think it's just one of the guild
25777360	25779360	requirements
25779360	25781360	to use
25781360	25783360	the parachute.
25783360	25785360	Oh, there's a bank actually.
25785360	25787360	I'm going to take my bank money out because
25787360	25789360	it looks cool.
25791360	25793360	I can faint the bank.
25793360	25795360	Good evening.
25795360	25797360	Good afternoon, Mr.
25797360	25799360	Bankman.
25799360	25801360	Can I have my landlord simulant?
25801360	25803360	Whoa, where the heck is this thing?
25803360	25805360	Can I have the landlord simulator
25805360	25807360	part of this game?
25809360	25811360	Is he counting coins?
25811360	25813360	Why is he leaning over like that?
25813360	25815360	He looks so insidious, like, ball him.
25815360	25817360	My coins.
25821360	25823360	12 never came, so me and the SUV
25823360	25825360	just went away. Lol.
25829360	25831360	Hello bank, I was like
25831360	25833360	I want one zillion dollars.
25835360	25837360	We're rich, we're rich.
25839360	25841360	Right, next
25841360	25843360	we're going to do challenges
25843360	25845360	to get
25845360	25847360	our guild
25847360	25849360	to play decoration,
25849360	25851360	to play room decoration.
25851360	25853360	So we've done landlord simulator, we're now doing room
25853360	25855360	decoration.
25855360	25857360	Uh,
25857360	25859360	and then
25859360	25861360	after that
25861360	25863360	I
25863360	25865360	think we actually have
25865360	25867360	done, like, the main
25867360	25869360	we're going to take some of the layouts
25869360	25871360	of this place.
25871360	25873360	He actually just gave you
25873360	25875360	sheets to take. It's his laundry.
25875360	25877360	He's like, here it is, it's all for you
25877360	25879360	buddy.
25879360	25881360	And why not jump with me?
25881360	25883360	That's such a smart, I wonder
25883360	25885360	he only says that line
25885360	25887360	if you jump here.
25889360	25891360	Butcher. It's not a butcher.
25891360	25893360	Why do you keep saying butcher?
25893360	25895360	I don't know.
25895360	25897360	They both begin with the letter B
25897360	25899360	so
25899360	25901360	yeah, maybe that's why
25901360	25903360	instead of blacksmiths I say butcher.
25907360	25909360	Up next, animal crossing
25909360	25911360	decorating rooms.
25911360	25913360	I
25913360	25915360	personally will never
25915360	25917360	stream animal crossing.
25917360	25919360	I don't
25919360	25921360	know.
25921360	25923360	Whoa, they boarded me
25923360	25925360	out.
25925360	25927360	Oh
25927360	25929360	bridge.
25929360	25931360	Like I don't know if I can make
25931360	25933360	animal crossing fun.
25933360	25935360	Like
25935360	25937360	maybe as a
25937360	25939360	I don't know. I couldn't make it
25939360	25941360	fun. I don't mind watching other people play it
25941360	25943360	but me, I'm like, I ain't that creative
25943360	25945360	to make it entertaining.
25945360	25947360	I love all the games that
25947360	25949360	start with AC on full.
25949360	25951360	Right, so I guess the only way to get back
25951360	25953360	into the castle is this way from now on.
25953360	25955360	Whoa, we have over a hundred
25955360	25957360	thousand forums.
25959360	25961360	Right, I can
25961360	25963360	can I walk through that gate?
25963360	25965360	No.
25965360	25967360	That would be too easy.
25967360	25969360	I wonder, actually, probably post-game
25969360	25971360	they should actually open that gate. I said what I said
25971360	25973360	because like chaseries won't do a thing.
25975360	25977360	Yeah, oh no, guys, I've got a DM.
25977360	25979360	I was getting nervous.
25979360	25981360	I'm like, oh no, is there something wrong with my babies
25981360	25983360	if I've got a DM?
25985360	25986360	Everything is
25986360	25987360	really cute.
25989360	25991360	Oh, we have the thumbnails
25991360	25993360	for our first group collab.
25993360	25995360	And that is what I knew.
25995360	25997360	How interesting.
25997360	25999360	I'll let it be a mystery.
26005360	26007360	Rest well, those who have to go.
26007360	26009360	Thank you for hanging.
26011360	26013360	Mercy is going live
26013360	26015360	in 2 minus
26015360	26017360	1 hour and 45
26017360	26019360	for a
26019360	26021360	how the heck to get up. I've completely
26021360	26023360	forgotten all over again.
26023360	26025360	Just go straight up
26025360	26027360	like that, I guess.
26027360	26029360	I do have my assassins
26029360	26031360	so I suppose I can just signal them to go
26031360	26033360	get rid of them.
26033360	26035360	Yeah.
26037360	26039360	Wait, wasn't there?
26041360	26043360	This way over here.
26045360	26047360	Relax, Hen.
26047360	26049360	Why are you moaning
26049360	26051360	about the place? My goodness.
26051360	26053360	Alert the guards.
26055360	26056360	Good night.
26056360	26058360	Sleep well, those who need to sleep.
26058360	26060360	Good morning, those who are good
26060360	26062360	morning.
26066360	26068360	She's getting me acting up.
26068360	26070360	Oh, literally, I don't know what that was.
26076360	26078360	Okay, this is what I was going to do.
26079360	26081360	Let's do you.
26081360	26083360	No, that guy actually
26083360	26085360	can see you here.
26087360	26089360	Morning.
26089360	26091360	Europe's waking up.
26097360	26099360	Okay, the assassin signals being able to
26099360	26101360	do that is like amazing.
26110360	26112360	It's 3 a.m. in Europe.
26112360	26114360	Oh, I'm a bit early for European streamers.
26114360	26116360	I apologize.
26118360	26120360	Can I not go up there?
26120360	26122360	I don't want to go too far.
26122360	26124360	Okay, it's the next one I go up.
26125360	26127360	I need to go down in order to go up.
26130360	26133360	European's perishing right now trying to
26133360	26135360	wait.
26135360	26137360	I'm losing it.
26139360	26141360	Yeah, go down to go up.
26141360	26143360	Okay, I'm starting to kind of remember, but...
26144360	26146360	It's always 3 a.m. somewhere.
26150360	26152360	Last and ESP.
26153360	26156360	I have no idea what time zone I'm like
26156360	26158360	perfect for.
26158360	26160360	But then again,
26160360	26162360	am I technically not perfect
26162360	26165360	for all time zones if I stream really long?
26170360	26171360	Hmm.
26171360	26174360	Yeah, I don't think we're doing a 12 hours
26174360	26176360	before anyone is strapped in.
26178360	26180360	So some people will be relieved to hear
26180360	26182360	that we're not doing another 12 hours
26182360	26184360	at this floating home.
26184360	26186360	I think when we do Eldon Ring,
26186360	26189360	it will be a few back-to-back 12 hours.
26191360	26193360	Yeah, you fit all time zones.
26193360	26195360	Heh heh heh.
26197360	26199360	Bad healthy sleep.
26199360	26202360	You'd be perfect for New Zealand.
26203360	26205360	I thought it was 4 a.m.
26205360	26207360	Sorry, I didn't have my weapon out.
26208360	26210360	Sorry, I'm not paying attention.
26210360	26211360	I'm Jerry Jack.
26211360	26213360	Why have you got your...
26213360	26214360	Put away this thing?
26214360	26216360	Oh, my thing's glitched out.
26216360	26217360	It's like...
26217360	26219360	What are you doing?
26219360	26221360	Oh, that was kind of badass.
26221360	26223360	I wouldn't lose it all.
26225360	26227360	Something's not...
26227360	26228360	I had it up here.
26228360	26229360	That was...
26229360	26230360	That was...
26230360	26231360	Now my...
26231360	26232360	Assassin...
26232360	26234360	What are you doing, Lady?
26235360	26236360	Classic woman moment.
26236360	26238360	Can't make up her mind.
26238360	26239360	That's terrible.
26239360	26241360	Don't make too much of that.
26242360	26243360	Don't do that.
26243360	26244360	That's my next.
26244360	26245360	Heh heh.
26249360	26251360	He has two goons.
26260360	26262360	We're doing it!
26262360	26264360	We're doing the thing!
26267360	26268360	Oh.
26268360	26269360	That's on the way.
26269360	26271360	Oh, it was on the wrong side.
26271360	26273360	My Assassin's still having de-spawn.
26273360	26274360	They're freaking out.
26274360	26275360	I don't like it.
26276360	26277360	Right.
26279360	26281360	So I don't mess this up.
26281360	26283360	How do I tell the parachute to come out?
26289360	26290360	Uh...
26290360	26291360	I'm being propaganda.
26291360	26293360	How do I tell the parachute to come out?
26295360	26297360	Did I just launch and press X?
26299360	26300360	Right.
26300360	26301360	I don't...
26302360	26303360	I don't want to go that way
26303360	26305360	because that won't activate the jump.
26307360	26308360	Look at that thing.
26308360	26310360	The Assassins are really struggling.
26311360	26312360	Should prompt...
26312360	26313360	Do a flip.
26313360	26314360	Okay.
26315360	26316360	What were we doing?
26316360	26317360	Did I go that way?
26317360	26318360	Or that way?
26320360	26322360	No point in going in the back in the street.
26325360	26326360	Uh...
26326360	26327360	Whatever the prompt is,
26327360	26329360	bloody hope it comes up because...
26330360	26331360	it is...
26331360	26333360	not on the wheel.
26336360	26337360	Oh, there we go.
26337360	26338360	Oh, thank God.
26338360	26339360	Right.
26339360	26341360	I need to do like a ton of distance.
26341360	26343360	I guess I'll just go over the wall.
26345360	26347360	I was really worried that prompt wasn't going to come out.
26350360	26353360	I think I need to glade like 500 meters.
26359360	26361360	Uh...
26361360	26363360	Am I going to make the glide?
26367360	26368360	Am I going to make the glide?
26368360	26369360	Hello?
26371360	26372360	Am I not going to make it?
26372360	26373360	Come on, pop.
26373360	26374360	Pop.
26374360	26375360	Pop.
26375360	26376360	Pop.
26376360	26378360	No, I don't want to climb it again.
26378360	26379360	Please pop.
26379360	26380360	What was that supposed to do?
26384360	26385360	Why did that not pop?
26385360	26386360	I was supposed...
26386360	26387360	something was supposed to pop there.
26387360	26388360	Not the achievement.
26390360	26392360	What was supposed to...
26392360	26394360	what did I do wrong?
26395360	26397360	It was an assassin's.
26399360	26401360	Was it thieves because they're agile?
26403360	26404360	Glade...
26404360	26407360	and a cumulative total of 500 meters were a part of it.
26407360	26408360	Is that what I just said?
26414360	26416360	I'm not to turn at all.
26417360	26418360	Okay.
26419360	26420360	No.
26421360	26424360	I hope you guys have the same patience for me.
26424360	26426360	Because I need to do that all over again.
26426360	26427360	I don't know...
26428360	26429360	cumulative.
26430360	26431360	Alright.
26431360	26433360	I'll just do it again because it should pop then.
26434360	26435360	Just do it multiple times.
26435360	26436360	Yes.
26436360	26438360	Alright, we're going to zoom it because at least I know exactly where to go.
26440360	26441360	Wait.
26441360	26442360	Wait.
26444360	26446360	You can do it cheeky sometimes.
26447360	26449360	I thought you could do it in one jump.
26449360	26450360	For some reason.
26454360	26456360	I went for it too often.
26458360	26459360	We're so rude.
26460360	26461360	Slanted.
26462360	26468360	There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach.
26469360	26471360	If you're trying.
26472360	26474360	Oh, I'm breaking free.
26476360	26477360	I can't remember the rest of it.
26485360	26486360	Does it still have a parachute?
26486360	26489360	Yeah, I have four more inventory.
26489360	26491360	I can't believe it.
26491360	26492360	I can't believe it.
26492360	26494360	I can't believe this castle is full of guards.
26495360	26497360	Shot and behaviour.
26497360	26498360	Get out.
26498360	26499360	Anyone wants you here?
26499360	26500360	Oh, my ankles.
26500360	26502360	I didn't take any fall damage.
26502360	26503360	Okay.
26504360	26505360	I love your...
26505360	26507360	Yeah, you're like when I burst into Scott swinging.
26507360	26508360	My wee accent.
26511360	26513360	I should do a Scott or some cover.
26513360	26514360	I don't know what to do.
26514360	26515360	I wanted to do an M&M one,
26515360	26516360	but I was like...
26516360	26518360	I don't know if it's bordering on cringe.
26519360	26520360	She was like...
26521360	26523360	I don't know what M&M song I wanted to do.
26523360	26524360	I don't know what song.
26524360	26525360	I don't know.
26528360	26529360	I've got any clue.
26530360	26532360	You've got any clue what's going on there?
26532360	26533360	No, you didn't.
26533360	26534360	You've gone back.
26534360	26535360	Sorry.
26537360	26538360	You threw me.
26538360	26540360	I don't know what one to do.
26540360	26544360	I'm beginning to feel like a wee bit of a rap god.
26547360	26548360	I don't know.
26549360	26555360	Yes, who's back, back, back, back again, again, again.
26556360	26560360	Strony's back, back, back, tell a friend.
26560360	26564360	Oh, everyone report to the dance floor.
26564360	26568360	It's your season to be butt squeezing.
26568360	26569360	That made me snore.
26569360	26570360	I'm so sorry.
26573360	26574360	Touch my body.
26574360	26576360	I mean, is it boy just touch my body?
26576360	26578360	I mean, girl, just touch my body.
26579360	26581360	Because this is the part where the rap breaks down.
26581360	26582360	No one moves.
26582360	26583360	No one makes a sound.
26583360	26586360	I'm just mixing into a ton of different songs, I think.
26587360	26588360	Back to reality.
26588360	26589360	There goes gravity.
26589360	26590360	There goes...
26590360	26591360	Doesn't have any.
26591360	26593360	There goes gravity again.
26593360	26594360	I don't know.
26596360	26597360	Okay, that was very lucky.
26597360	26599360	You can actually go backwards.
26601360	26602360	Are we a big fan of M&M?
26602360	26603360	No.
26604360	26605360	Not like...
26606360	26608360	Oh, I know all the albums and stuff.
26608360	26609360	It's just the goofy songs.
26609360	26610360	I like it.
26610360	26611360	I can't believe it.
26613360	26615360	I love Scottish M&M.
26621360	26622360	That one's good one.
26630360	26632360	The spaghetti on this shirt.
26632360	26634360	No, there's vomit on his shirt.
26634360	26635360	Mum's spaghetti.
26638360	26639360	I'm a jukebox.
26642360	26644360	Okay, now we need this as a carry, okay?
26645360	26646360	Oh, there goes gravity.
26646360	26647360	Oh, there goes a rabbit.
26647360	26648360	That's not the lyrics.
26648360	26649360	You're teasing me.
26652360	26654360	Scottish Kendrick Lamar wins.
26662360	26663360	I don't know the words.
26663360	26665360	I don't even know if that was Kendrick Lamar.
26665360	26666360	I'm going to be honest.
26667360	26668360	No, that was Denzel Watt.
26668360	26669360	No.
26669360	26670360	Wait, hold on.
26671360	26672360	Hold on.
26672360	26673360	Brain farming.
26673360	26675360	Sitting here repeating YouTube work on my Scottish accent.
26675360	26677360	I really know many other...
26677360	26678360	Right.
26679360	26682360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26682360	26684360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26684360	26686360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26686360	26688360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26688360	26690360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26690360	26692360	I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.
26692360	26694360	You know what's up or won't you?
26694360	26696360	That's not really...
26698360	26700360	500 accumulative meters.
26700360	26703360	500 accumulative meters.
26703360	26707360	I don't want to fly up off that fricking building again.
26707360	26710360	500 accumulative meters, please.
26715360	26716360	I can't believe it.
26717360	26718360	That's it.
26718360	26719360	Put the tunes on.
26719360	26721360	We're rapping in Scots.
26721360	26726360	Because how on earth was that not 500 accumulative meters?
26726360	26730360	500 accumulative meters.
26730360	26737360	I only ask for 500 meters.
26738360	26739360	Hmm.
26746360	26747360	Talk to my assassins.
26747360	26749360	Because Exio ain't listening.
26750360	26752360	We suck at rap battle.
26752360	26754360	You want us to rap battle each other?
26754360	26755360	Honestly?
26756360	26757360	Right.
26757360	26760360	This is going to be really obviously kind of spoilers if you'd be here.
26760360	26763360	Well, it's not really spoilers because it would have to be discussed anyway.
26763360	26766360	I really thought it would be fun to have diss tracks made.
26766360	26768360	Like make diss tracks on each other.
26769360	26771360	So obviously they'd be like,
26771360	26773360	Strongly cuttles can't even see your name right.
26773360	26775360	Because you're Scottish, you know what I mean?
26775360	26777360	If I don't know how to do that,
26777360	26781360	I would have to unegronically commission someone to diss each other.
26781360	26784360	But I think a diss track on each other would be so funny.
26784360	26786360	I know it's brain dead, but I don't know.
26786360	26787360	I just want to find out the content that's funny.
26787360	26789360	Like interact with each other in that kind of way.
26789360	26790360	Words, yeah.
26790360	26796360	Like she be caught in bomb or like pretending to be your mom.
26796360	26802360	Oh, you know, because you know, she's a male.
26802360	26805360	But she hasn't spawned in a child from her loins.
26805360	26808360	Like, oh, like, oh, what this, what this,
26808360	26810360	but I don't know how like this tracks work.
26810360	26813360	I don't know how you make them or anything like that.
26814360	26818360	And like Azura Dooley, more like Azura Doo-Gay.
26818360	26824360	Oh, I mean Beezoo, more like, I mean, your brother's dead.
26824360	26833360	Oh, I see snow paws, more like a brat with just claws.
26833360	26838360	Oh, this is awful.
26839360	26840360	Merci, modest.
26840360	26841360	Yeah, nothing.
26841360	26844360	Yeah, your dress wear isn't modest at all.
26844360	26846360	You just slagged your dress like a slag.
26850360	26852360	Like how do you make diss tracks?
26852360	26853360	I don't know.
26859360	26860360	That didn't even rain.
26863360	26864360	I just don't know how.
26864360	26866360	Like how do people think of it?
26866360	26869360	Like, you have to go right away and write something.
26872360	26873360	I was like that.
26873360	26875360	I don't know if you've seen the meme where it's like,
26875360	26876360	you're deadly.
26878360	26881360	You're deadly nails out of the garden, the scruffy nose.
26883360	26886360	Like that's how we end up doing a diss track
26886360	26889360	because I feel so much pressure to like say something.
26890360	26896360	It's like, it just doesn't make any sense.
26896360	26899360	Like, I just don't know how people come up with like actually,
26899360	26902360	like, you know how epic rap battles is like so good?
26902360	26907360	Like, whose rap flows the dopest Marilyn Monroe's
26907360	26911360	upthrown pharaohs, like opposes like Moses or something like that.
26911360	26914360	Um, like that is so good.
26914360	26916360	And I'm like, how do people know that?
26916360	26918360	We can do epic rap battles.
26918360	26919360	VTuber style.
26919360	26920360	Come on.
26920360	26921360	Oh, stop reading my mind.
26921360	26922360	Literally though.
26924360	26925360	Literally though.
26926360	26927360	I should.
26929360	26930360	Yeah.
26930360	26932360	Yeah, they spend more times on the like,
26932360	26933360	get idea wrong.
26936360	26938360	Maybe VTuber should do rap battles,
26938360	26941360	but like the problem is I don't have any music or lyrical thing.
26941360	26944360	So I would have to like go out and commission to do it.
26944360	26945360	I don't need to grab VTubers.
26945360	26947360	I'd be willing to like let us diss each other.
26947360	26952360	Like, oh, I don't even know how I would diss myself.
26954360	26956360	Oh, I don't know.
26957360	26960360	Probably like, oh, schizophrenic personality disorder.
26960360	26964360	Oh, but you're like, that's probably how you get me.
26964360	26965360	She's been streaming seven hours.
26965360	26966360	That's what you hate.
26966360	26967360	Yeah, I am.
26967360	26968360	Right.
26968360	26970360	Repeat after me.
26970360	26973360	500 accumulative mirrors.
26973360	26975360	500 accumulative mirrors.
26975360	26977360	500 accumulative mirrors.
26977360	26980360	500 accumulative mirrors.
26980360	26983360	Accumulative mirrors.
26983360	26986360	500, please.
26986360	26992360	500 accumulative mirrors.
26992360	26995360	Because I don't want to do that anymore.
26995360	26998360	I'll probably do something else if we don't hit it this time
26998360	27000360	and that's okay.
27000360	27005360	But we're asking for 500 accumulative mirrors.
27005360	27006360	Yay!
27006360	27007360	We did it!
27007360	27008360	We did it!
27008360	27010360	Okay, it takes three times to jump off together.
27010360	27011360	Okay.
27011360	27013360	Oh, let's do a cheeky air assassination.
27013360	27014360	Oh, I can't.
27014360	27015360	I'm out of bounds.
27015360	27018360	Sorry, just dropping in for the third time today.
27018360	27021360	Oh, I just looked up my own scout there.
27021360	27022360	We did it.
27022360	27023360	We did it.
27023360	27028360	Right, now we need to figure out what on earth these guilds want from us.
27028360	27029360	Let's see.
27029360	27030360	Guild challenges.
27030360	27031360	Assassins.
27031360	27032360	Like, fully done.
27032360	27033360	Yeah, okay.
27033360	27034360	Okay, it's done.
27034360	27035360	Cheeky Flash.
27035360	27036360	Cheeky Flash.
27036360	27037360	Right.
27037360	27038360	Brutes killed.
27038360	27039360	Scaffolding by guards.
27039360	27041360	PayPal guards.
27041360	27047360	The PayPal guards are back there.
27047360	27050360	Guards killed while on horseback.
27050360	27053360	Guards on horseback air assassinated.
27053360	27055360	Double assassination.
27055360	27058360	Five guards disarmed and killed with their own weapon.
27058360	27060360	I'm going to be honest, I've actually already done one of that.
27060360	27061360	I know for a fact I have.
27061360	27063360	I have a five-man kill streak.
27063360	27065360	Mm, okay, is there anything easier?
27065360	27067360	Oh, we've actually done quite a lot.
27067360	27071360	Evade enemies using the crowd or other hiding spots.
27071360	27074360	Enemies stationed at a guard post while using a crossbow.
27074360	27076360	I actually know how to do that.
27076360	27082360	Horses belonging to guards commandeered without killing the rider,
27082360	27084360	and guards killed in a smoke bomb.
27084360	27088360	Right, we'll do that right now because we can do the smoke bomb.
27088360	27089360	Hello.
27089360	27090360	Hello.
27090360	27092360	I'm going to kill you.
27092360	27094360	Oh, that was...
27094360	27096360	Right, take your time.
27096360	27100360	Right, and then I'm going to get rid of this one.
27100360	27102360	Oh, well, I'm going to get double assassination,
27102360	27106360	and then I'm going to take his sword.
27106360	27107360	Oh, he can.
27107360	27109360	He's not weak enough.
27109360	27112360	Sugar.
27112360	27114360	Uh, right.
27114360	27117360	We did the smoke bomb, which is fantastic.
27117360	27120360	Um...
27120360	27122360	7.68%.
27122360	27124360	Is it actually?
27124360	27125360	No more kill.
27125360	27126360	Actually, I did the coppers kill.
27126360	27128360	That's terrible.
27128360	27130360	Kilty, kilty, cold bum.
27130360	27134360	Did you know when you were killed, you're not supposed to wear any...
27134360	27136360	Greeks under it.
27136360	27140360	Mm...
27140360	27142360	Did I need to write these on a note?
27142360	27144360	I think I actually have to.
27144360	27146360	Uh...
27146360	27148360	Yeah.
27148360	27149360	This is like so much.
27149360	27154360	Right, the papal guards are...
27154360	27157360	actually back across the bridge.
27157360	27159360	You know that.
27159360	27161360	Excuse me, how about your horse?
27161360	27162360	Oh, fine.
27162360	27166360	Right, I'll call him on.
27166360	27169360	What item do you steal from the other guards?
27169360	27170360	I answered...
27170360	27171360	Oh, I answered that.
27171360	27173360	But it's a bit inappropriate.
27173360	27177360	I'm not sure I should say it again.
27177360	27178360	Right, here.
27178360	27180360	These are where these guards...
27180360	27182360	These ones spawn.
27182360	27185360	So, we're going to need to like come back and then...
27185360	27186360	Oh, don't shoot me.
27186360	27188360	That's not nice.
27188360	27192360	Whoa, you weren't even aiming at me, bro.
27192360	27193360	I don't want to...
27193360	27194360	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
27194360	27195360	Right, okay, okay.
27195360	27196360	Okay, okay, okay.
27196360	27197360	You're done.
27197360	27198360	You're done.
27198360	27200360	Well, because I am, you're dead.
27200360	27203360	Don't waste my time.
27203360	27205360	Stinks.
27205360	27206360	Take that.
27206360	27208360	These are the only location...
27208360	27210360	I know these type of guards spawn.
27210360	27213360	I'm like 99% sure.
27213360	27218360	I don't think anyone else spawn here.
27218360	27228360	Right, and then you.
27228360	27229360	Here you go.
27229360	27231360	Here's some money.
27231360	27232360	Me.
27232360	27233360	Here we go.
27233360	27234360	That's my money.
27234360	27238360	I don't know.
27238360	27240360	This beast is beautiful.
27240360	27241360	Beautiful?
27241360	27247360	I don't know how to respawn those guys in without like going around doing something else.
27247360	27254360	Should we do Quarters on Assignment?
27254360	27255360	No.
27255360	27258360	I need to do a lot of horse activities.
27258360	27260360	That sounds bizarre.
27260360	27263360	Out of context.
27263360	27267360	Have I got a pen and paper for my brain?
27267360	27271360	I don't know.
27271360	27275360	I'm literally going to write this on the discord.
27275360	27280360	So the girls are like, what the heck are you typing about?
27280360	27282360	Right, let's see.
27282360	27285360	I need to...
27285360	27289360	Right, I've killed four more people.
27289360	27293360	I have to like open it and then show it in the next.
27293360	27296360	Killstreak and then...
27296360	27300360	I need to evade...
27301360	27304360	Evade four times or something.
27304360	27307360	I've already forgotten the other freaking thing I was supposed to do.
27307360	27309360	One enemy stationed at Guard Post.
27309360	27314360	Okay, we're actually going to station Guard Post.
27314360	27318360	We're actually going to do that in a memory because there's a memory that enables that.
27318360	27321360	Horses belonging to guards commandeered.
27321360	27328360	Horses yoinked without killing.
27328360	27330360	Do you want me to screenshot and post on the discord?
27330360	27332360	I just need to do the last one.
27332360	27334360	Oh, I can screenshot it.
27334360	27336360	I don't even have to type it out.
27336360	27337360	Can I screenshot it?
27337360	27338360	Did that screenshot work?
27338360	27340360	I don't even think I did.
27340360	27342360	It did.
27342360	27344360	Okay.
27344360	27346360	Okay, that worked.
27346360	27348360	Okay, it worked.
27348360	27350360	I am so smart.
27350360	27353360	SMRT.
27353360	27356360	Okay, let's see.
27356360	27361360	Put that there so I don't miss any donations if someone tips.
27361360	27364360	And then put the discord there.
27364360	27366360	And now I can...
27366360	27367360	Oh wait, no.
27367360	27368360	I can't see it.
27368360	27371360	Oh, the screenshot makes it so tiny that I can't see it.
27371360	27372360	I need to type it out.
27372360	27373360	Six.
27373360	27375360	Six thieves lured.
27375360	27376360	I did it for anyway.
27376360	27377360	Now, that's the picture.
27377360	27380360	It's because if it's a picture, I need to have the discord in small.
27380360	27382360	Sprint uninterrupted.
27382360	27385360	Sprint for 300.
27386360	27388360	21 leaps of faith.
27388360	27391360	I need to do 40 leaps of faith.
27391360	27394360	So you don't really do leaps of faith anymore.
27394360	27396360	Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.
27396360	27400360	Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.
27400360	27403360	Unless, but certainly not least,
27403360	27406360	jump from a horse to a beam.
27406360	27408360	Jump from horse to beam.
27408360	27411360	Yeah, there's actually like so much horse related ones.
27411360	27413360	This is surprising.
27413360	27415360	I didn't actually expect...
27417360	27419360	Oh, Azura just messaged me.
27419360	27420360	Oh.
27420360	27422360	What's she saying?
27423360	27425360	Ah, okay.
27426360	27427360	It's MRT.
27427360	27428360	Oh my god.
27428360	27431360	The girls are posting in the not-safe-for-work section of the discord.
27431360	27433360	Now look at it.
27437360	27438360	I think it may be...
27438360	27441360	Oh, it actually may be my gifted artwork.
27441360	27442360	Open it.
27444360	27445360	It's MRT.
27445360	27447360	Oh wait, I've just closed the discord.
27447360	27448360	Oops.
27448360	27451360	The discord actually holds everything that I need in order to play the game.
27451360	27453360	Look at dum-dum.
27453360	27455360	It's MRT.
27455360	27457360	No, that's Samarty.
27459360	27461360	Wow, I can't believe it.
27461360	27465360	I might unironically need a third moner for this kind of stuff.
27468360	27469360	Okay.
27472360	27475360	Someone at Ubisoft is really proud of the horses.
27475360	27480360	Honestly, it probably took like a heckish and hellish...
27480360	27481360	Oh, wait.
27481360	27482360	I'm freaking dumb.
27482360	27484360	Why am I so dumb?
27485360	27486360	Dum-dum-dum.
27486360	27487360	Okay, wait.
27487360	27488360	Hold on.
27488360	27491360	Hold the freaking telephone.
27492360	27494360	Okay, there we go.
27494360	27496360	I definitely need a third moner.
27496360	27500360	Honestly, I felt that right now as I'm currently trying to like arrange so many things.
27500360	27502360	Okay, hydration check.
27511360	27513360	I am going to do one...
27513360	27515360	Yeah, one of those portrait moners.
27515360	27518360	Yeah, definitely like chat-orientating.
27518360	27519360	Right.
27519360	27525360	Because there's so many horses once, I'm actually going to take us to the thieves district
27525360	27529360	if I can find a fast port, which I can at the...
27529360	27531360	Rosa in Fiori.
27532360	27534360	Merci.
27535360	27536360	One hour, 20 minutes.
27536360	27538360	Merci.
27540360	27541360	Merci.
27549360	27551360	Merci didn't know what countdown was.
27551360	27552360	Yeah.
27556360	27557360	I...
27557360	27559360	I'm like...
27559360	27560360	All our...
27560360	27563360	All like, Merci's senpais are more deceased.
27563360	27565360	Oh!
27566360	27569360	Merci just catches the street a little bit.
27570360	27571360	What?
27571360	27573360	I'm dissing my...
27573360	27575360	My fellow gen mate,
27575360	27578360	but I'm so bad at like dissing because I just...
27578360	27580360	Like, I...
27580360	27584360	Oh, I need to put you in the scaffold and please let me grab you.
27584360	27585360	No, no, no.
27585360	27586360	I don't want to fight.
27586360	27587360	I don't want to fight.
27587360	27588360	I don't want to fight.
27588360	27589360	Please, can I grab you?
27589360	27590360	Can I grab you?
27590360	27592360	Wait, I can't grab them when they're in.
27592360	27593360	Right.
27593360	27595360	That's two of three.
27595360	27596360	Ah!
27596360	27598360	Leave me alone!
27598360	27601360	Is there any more scaffolding?
27601360	27606360	If there's more scaffolding, now's the time to reveal yourself.
27609360	27611360	There is!
27612360	27614360	Please come this way.
27614360	27615360	Please come this way.
27615360	27617360	Oh, look at this lovely scaffolding
27617360	27619360	that someone's put up for it.
27619360	27620360	Damn, she cooking.
27620360	27622360	Merci, what's she doing?
27622360	27624360	Zero, I'm trying to diss tracks,
27624360	27626360	but I'm absolutely rubbish at them.
27628360	27630360	And I'm like, trying to pretend I know how to
27630360	27631360	frickin' diss tracks,
27631360	27633360	but it's plausible.
27638360	27639360	Now, you're not coming over.
27639360	27640360	Come here, right now.
27640360	27641360	Come here.
27641360	27642360	Come here.
27644360	27645360	I'm wondering...
27645360	27646360	Oh, this is terrible.
27646360	27648360	This isn't going to work out well, I don't think.
27648360	27649360	Tell these two.
27649360	27652360	Right, we've got a double assassination out of that.
27652360	27653360	No!
27653360	27654360	It's you.
27654360	27657360	You're a bit too efficient at your job.
27657360	27660360	I didn't actually want to assassinate them.
27660360	27662360	I'm talking about a third monitor,
27662360	27664360	and I still only have one.
27664360	27665360	Ah!
27665360	27668360	If you're going to be sure, you might need three.
27671360	27673360	Momet and Mummy are here.
27673360	27674360	Yeah.
27674360	27676360	Or Mommy.
27678360	27679360	Wait, what do I need to do?
27679360	27681360	I need to go do horse missions!
27681360	27684360	Right, we're going to go to the Thieves Guild,
27684360	27687360	which I totally know the name of.
27688360	27690360	The Thieves Guild.
27690360	27693360	Why is it all the way down here?
27694360	27696360	I feel like the last one.
27696360	27698360	You know what?
27701360	27702360	Yeah, you're dumb.
27702360	27704360	Mm-hmm, you're dumb.
27704360	27705360	She would never diss me.
27705360	27707360	She would love me.
27707360	27710360	Oh, I can't remember what my diss was on you.
27710360	27712360	I thought I was like Azuridule, more like...
27712360	27713360	Oh, that's what I was like.
27713360	27715360	Azuridule, more like Azuriduke.
27715360	27718360	That's really like the most rubbish thing.
27718360	27720360	Like nonsense.
27720360	27721360	What's wrong with you?
27721360	27722360	Visual number of hurricanes.
27722360	27723360	Are we allowed to recommend?
27723360	27724360	Yeah, you can always recommend stuff.
27724360	27725360	That's not a problem at all.
27725360	27728360	Right, horse activities.
27728360	27731360	Right, I need to run 300 meters uninterrupted.
27731360	27734360	You can do it at this section super duper easily.
27734360	27736360	Definitely recommend going to the Thieves Guild
27736360	27738360	in order to do this.
27738360	27740360	Azuridule, more like Fontal Abyssum.
27745360	27749360	Your third monitor should be used exclusively to ignore chat.
27749360	27751360	Why would I ignore chat?
27751360	27753360	It's literally the best part of streaming.
27756360	27758360	Other than, like, when the gameplay gets intense,
27758360	27761360	then, uh, some things need to be slowed down.
27761360	27763360	Is there, like, a perfect circle here?
27763360	27765360	Can I just go in circles?
27765360	27767360	If you get motion sick, close your eyes.
27767360	27768360	Mercy, look away.
27768360	27770360	Don't watch stream here, man.
27773360	27776360	What would happen if Ezio had to turn for the feature bar?
27776360	27778360	I think he'd have a lot of fan girls.
27779360	27781360	Ay, hold on.
27781360	27783360	Alright, what do I need to next?
27787360	27789360	What?
27789360	27792360	How have I got the Thieves Guild crest?
27792360	27793360	I didn't do it.
27793360	27797360	More like Stacey, these Milkretains, literally.
27801360	27805360	She'd be calling herself a dumb winner.
27805360	27806360	Winner.
27806360	27808360	Protide name was literally cotton bomb.
27808360	27811360	Yeah, get wrecked, yeah.
27814360	27817360	Your dedication towards Ezio is highly respectable.
27817360	27819360	It's a good game, what can I say?
27819360	27820360	Right.
27820360	27824360	Am I supposed to kill from being on a horse?
27824360	27826360	Guards killed well on horseback.
27826360	27828360	Let's go!
27829360	27831360	Oh, hold on, let's try again.
27831360	27833360	Hold on, let me get back on the horse.
27833360	27834360	Sorry, sorry.
27834360	27836360	Let me quit, excuse me, excuse me.
27836360	27839360	Let me literally get back on the horse.
27839360	27842360	I kid you not, literally let me get back on the horse.
27843360	27846360	Stop, I know you're scared, but we need to try that again.
27846360	27849360	I messed that up really badly, hold on.
27849360	27851360	Okay, let's try that again.
27851360	27854360	I've been destroyed, decimated.
27854360	27859360	Just like how decimated your skin is when you interact with rabbits,
27859360	27860360	because you're allergic.
27860360	27862360	Ha, ha, ha, you're allergic.
27862360	27864360	Yeah, I'm so good at doing this.
27864360	27866360	This is awful, I'm so sorry.
27866360	27869360	This is absolutely horrendous, I'm just gonna stop talking.
27873360	27874360	Oh.
27876360	27877360	I'm a horseback.
27877360	27881360	Showing it on an old space commercial.
27881360	27884360	Wow, low blow, just like the hate of rabbits.
27884360	27886360	Oh, ooh.
27888360	27890360	They just make my throat close now.
27890360	27893360	Literally put you in anaphylactic shock.
27893360	27895360	Oh, nothing measured though.
27895360	27897360	Yeah.
27897360	27901360	Okay, retconning the model we gave you right now.
27901360	27903360	Holy crap.
27903360	27905360	Double air assassination.
27905360	27907360	Oh, it actually worked.
27907360	27908360	Wow, okay.
27908360	27909360	Owie.
27909360	27910360	Wait, hold on.
27910360	27911360	Horse, come back.
27911360	27912360	Stop being scared.
27912360	27914360	Where did the horse go?
27914360	27915360	Is it?
27915360	27916360	Oh, right, fine.
27916360	27918360	I'm just calling my recruits in.
27919360	27920360	No, no, no, no, no, no.
27920360	27921360	We don't do this.
27921360	27923360	Get me here, get me.
27923360	27926360	Yeah, yeah, yeah, the people are fighting back.
27926360	27927360	Take that.
27927360	27929360	And this is stinky, stinky.
27929360	27931360	Wait, that missed?
27931360	27933360	Oh, well, I'll let this guy control that.
27933360	27934360	Where's my horse?
27934360	27935360	There's my horse.
27935360	27937360	Okay, we did this.
27937360	27941360	We need to just go around killing more guards from horseback.
27941360	27944360	And then once that one's done, we'll move on to the next one.
27944360	27947360	Hello, are there any guards?
27948360	27950360	It seemed quieter.
27950360	27953360	Hello, are there any guards?
27956360	27959360	I get turned into a horse because they get...
27959360	27962360	Oh, would you want to be a horse feature?
27964360	27968360	If I would change into another animal,
27970360	27973360	I'd maybe make you...
27973360	27975360	What would I make you?
27975360	27979360	Thank goodness I'm not on the development team anymore when it comes to that shiz.
27979360	27982360	Don't worry, you're not getting any more bad names.
27982360	27983360	No.
27983360	27984360	No.
27985360	27986360	Hi, Jack.
27986360	27988360	I'm to commandeer a horse without killing.
27988360	27990360	Okay, so that's one for the commandeering.
27990360	27993360	Oh, my horse has like a little backpack now.
27996360	27998360	Got a little backpack on the horse?
27998360	28001360	Okay, so that just need to like keep running around, hoping to run into...
28001360	28003360	Okay, here we go.
28005360	28007360	Okay, that was one more.
28009360	28012360	Okay, we're going to call in the assassins.
28013360	28016360	As soon as they get on a horse, I don't like it.
28016360	28017360	I get scared.
28017360	28018360	Ooh!
28018360	28021360	Oh, that was guard on horseback assassination.
28021360	28023360	That was good, that was good.
28023360	28026360	There's only been like three surprising ones.
28027360	28030360	Let's see if we can do another double, maybe?
28030360	28032360	Yeah, okay, nice double.
28032360	28034360	We're racking up their numbers really quick.
28035360	28037360	Alright, I'll let the assassins deal with this.
28037360	28039360	I'm going to get this guy.
28039360	28040360	I'm getting out of here.
28040360	28042360	No, you're literally in my way.
28045360	28048360	Horse features also have a very big buff because of the horse.
28053360	28057360	Alright, we need to get back on a horsey-worsey.
28058360	28060360	Hello!
28061360	28063360	And then...
28064360	28069360	We're getting there, we're slowly whittling it down to not much...
28069360	28071360	Oh, I'm stuck on a rock.
28074360	28077360	Alright, enemies, enemies, enemies.
28077360	28079360	Oh, who we got, who we got?
28079360	28082360	I just need to hijack without killing.
28082360	28085360	Thank you, so that's two for ten.
28086360	28091360	That's two for ten for commandeering a horse.
28096360	28100360	I need to do the hide spot things, so maybe I'll go into the spale here in time.
28100360	28101360	I don't count.
28101360	28102360	Oh, rush.
28103360	28104360	What was an enemy back here?
28104360	28105360	What was it?
28105360	28106360	Oh, right, you.
28106360	28107360	Right, you're three of ten.
28107360	28109360	Thank you very much.
28111360	28112360	Appreciate it.
28113360	28116360	Actually, I'm going to go for these guys because they're just easy.
28119360	28120360	Oh, pardon me.
28120360	28122360	I'm just calling the assassins in.
28123360	28124360	No, stop running away.
28124360	28126360	I know it's scary when I start.
28126360	28129360	Oh, hijack, thank you very much.
28130360	28134360	Wait, if he keeps going on horses, can I just farm him?
28134360	28135360	Farm him?
28140360	28142360	Oh, no, my assassins are going to get up.
28142360	28144360	Okay, I have learned.
28145360	28146360	Today I have learned.
28146360	28147360	Let me get this guy here.
28149360	28152360	I think I can just farm him over and over again.
28152360	28157360	And because I jump off my horse to do it, he jumps on main automatically.
28157360	28160360	Right, what, what was that, like five?
28161360	28163360	So he's going to get on the horse.
28164360	28165360	Six.
28167360	28168360	Okay.
28171360	28173360	Oh, my goodness.
28173360	28178360	Seven grand theft dressage, but I didn't get the thing yet.
28179360	28181360	That's funny as anything though.
28182360	28183360	Oh, my God.
28183360	28185360	This is actually really funny.
28185360	28187360	Eight, I think eight.
28189360	28191360	Nine.
28192360	28194360	Oh, no, no, no, no.
28194360	28195360	Hey, there we go.
28195360	28196360	There we go.
28196360	28197360	Beautiful, beautiful.
28201360	28204360	Right, a few more kills from horseback.
28204360	28205360	That was good.
28205360	28208360	All he wants to do is ride the horse on his horse.
28208360	28210360	I just kept yanking over and over again.
28211360	28215360	I mean, did he really want the horse if he just made it that easy for me?
28216360	28218360	Okay, we're at the bath house.
28218360	28220360	I recognize this part of the map.
28222360	28225360	I think we're going to have to go in a bit more to find more guards.
28225360	28227360	I'm literally just going on the outskirts there.
28227360	28228360	On the map.
28230360	28236360	A few more assassinations from a horse while on horseback.
28237360	28238360	Well on horseback?
28238360	28240360	Oh, no, hold on, let me check.
28241360	28242360	Very quickly.
28245360	28247360	Stoney has DNA, DNA.
28248360	28250360	Is this the horse one?
28250360	28253360	Guards on horseback, air assassinate.
28253360	28255360	Guards killed while on horse.
28255360	28256360	While on horseback.
28256360	28262360	Okay, I'm going to get my crossbow out and we're literally just going on a spree then.
28263360	28265360	I need to stay on horseback now.
28267360	28268360	Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
28268360	28275360	I need to go to the wards, the Colosseum, which is this way.
28275360	28276360	What's that?
28276360	28279360	You've played assassins, creeds so much that you recognize which way you need to go.
28279360	28281360	Maybe, maybe not.
28283360	28285360	There should be four enemies here.
28287360	28289360	I'm surprised how casual this is.
28295360	28297360	Don't peel me off, don't peel me off, I'm scared.
28297360	28299360	Stop, you're scaring me.
28300360	28301360	That's four.
28302360	28303360	Okay, there we go.
28306360	28309360	Oh, wait.
28310360	28312360	We need to do the beam trick.
28312360	28313360	I think this is the beam trick.
28314360	28315360	That was the beam trick.
28315360	28317360	Right, we need to do that 19 more times.
28317360	28318360	I'm not even kidding.
28318360	28320360	Hold on, and we need to lure the guards.
28320360	28322360	Come here, come, come, come.
28323360	28324360	Lure these men away.
28326360	28327360	No, lure them away?
28327360	28328360	Yeah, there you go.
28329360	28336360	Right, we basically need to go back and forth over and over, jumping on this beam.
28337360	28339360	No, you didn't do it, it's you.
28339360	28341360	That wasn't it, that wasn't the trick.
28341360	28346360	We needed to do that flip you saw, literally 19 times more.
28346360	28348360	Do a flip, it's you.
28348360	28351360	Right, and I want to...
28351360	28353360	No, it's you, try again.
28354360	28357360	Do I need to jump on a specific part?
28358360	28359360	Really specific.
28363360	28366360	Jump, hold, flip.
28366360	28368360	Okay, jump, hold, flip.
28369360	28371360	So I need to tap A and then hold it.
28371360	28372360	So 18 more times.
28375360	28377360	Jump, hold, no.
28377360	28379360	Okay, I think we needed a bit more speed that time.
28379360	28382360	Give us a bit more energy, a bit more energy.
28382360	28385360	Little bull's eye, a little horsey-worsey.
28386360	28388360	Do a bit of run-up for it, hold.
28389360	28393360	And that horse just blocked us and jump and hold.
28393360	28395360	Why did that not work that time?
28397360	28399360	I'm not sure why that didn't work.
28402360	28404360	Yeah, but while talking with those, it's not bad.
28405360	28407360	I'm doing it in the corner of my eye.
28407360	28409360	And jump.
28409360	28413360	Okay, I purposely did that a bit later than when I would have selected A.
28413360	28416360	So it's 17 more.
28417360	28419360	I can do it.
28419360	28421360	Bitly, hold.
28421360	28423360	No, okay, right.
28425360	28427360	You're gonna have to bear with me, bear with me.
28427360	28431360	A is in this room right now because you're gonna have to bear with me.
28431360	28434360	Bear with me, let me take a few seconds.
28435360	28438360	Ready, steady, jump and hold.
28438360	28441360	Yay, 16 more times, let's go.
28442360	28445360	I definitely seem to be able to do it coming from that way.
28445360	28447360	I'm wondering if I can't do it this way.
28447360	28449360	Maybe there's like a hidden bug.
28449360	28451360	And a jump and a hold.
28453360	28455360	Maybe it's a one-way type of thing.
28457360	28459360	We're getting there.
28459360	28461360	70 more, let's go, literally.
28461360	28463360	It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this.
28463360	28465360	Really arbitrary.
28465360	28469360	Okay, really, really premature with that one.
28469360	28471360	I'm not even gonna, no, no.
28471360	28473360	The horse.
28475360	28477360	Let's try that again.
28479360	28482360	I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely.
28482360	28484360	Hold, no.
28486360	28489360	I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes
28489360	28491360	and not other times.
28491360	28495360	My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like
28495360	28497360	this pathing mess up.
28497360	28499360	Jump, hold.
28499360	28501360	No, why?
28501360	28503360	What is going on?
28503360	28505360	What is going on?
28505360	28507360	I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that.
28507360	28509360	Right, we'll do a really big run up just because we can.
28511360	28514360	Okay, so run and then stand.
28514360	28516360	And then jump and hold.
28516360	28518360	Okay, okay, it's speed.
28518360	28520360	It's speed. We need a bigger run up.
28520360	28522360	15 more times.
28522360	28524360	15 more times.
28524360	28527360	Okay, big, big long journey.
28527360	28529360	One, two, three, four, five.
28529360	28531360	Jump and hold.
28533360	28535360	15 is still the number.
28535360	28536360	We can't do it.
28536360	28539360	This is not at all.
28539360	28541360	A bit of a grind.
28541360	28543360	A bit more of a grind than I was expecting.
28543360	28545360	Run.
28545360	28547360	Jump and hold.
28550360	28553360	I honestly don't understand what's determining
28553360	28555360	the number.
28555360	28557360	Maybe do the middle one.
28557360	28559360	Like jump late.
28559360	28561360	I think you may be right.
28561360	28563360	We'll jump late on purpose this time.
28563360	28565360	Okay.
28565360	28567360	Not doing it.
28567360	28569360	Not doing it.
28569360	28571360	We'll jump now and hold.
28571360	28573360	No.
28573360	28575360	Thank you for at least coming back.
28575360	28577360	Hmm.
28577360	28579360	15 is better than 20.
28579360	28581360	And 14 is better than 15.
28581360	28583360	Whoa.
28583360	28585360	No, no, no, no, no, no.
28585360	28587360	No.
28587360	28589360	No.
28589360	28591360	No.
28591360	28593360	No.
28593360	28595360	Is the appropriate response
28595360	28597360	after seeing that out loud?
28599360	28601360	Oh, right.
28601360	28603360	No, that didn't work.
28603360	28605360	I think I'm getting speed blocked or something.
28605360	28607360	Because this is...
28607360	28609360	What?
28609360	28611360	What?
28611360	28613360	13.
28613360	28615360	No, not 13.
28615360	28617360	Close to 13.
28617360	28619360	We can do it.
28619360	28621360	I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like...
28621360	28623360	He's like trying not to be like a bit
28623360	28625360	disgruntled with like
28625360	28627360	the dwarves showing up.
28627360	28629360	And I'm like, ooh, ooh, it's fine.
28629360	28631360	It's fine.
28631360	28633360	No.
28633360	28635360	This is very pun.
28635360	28637360	There is a war going on.
28638360	28640360	Maybe you have to be under the beams.
28640360	28642360	Okay, I'll definitely...
28642360	28644360	Like, I'll super delay it this time.
28644360	28646360	Like, genuinely super delay it.
28648360	28650360	No, he just jumped straight on it.
28650360	28652360	If you do it, like, super delayed.
28652360	28654360	Okay.
28654360	28656360	Hmm.
28656360	28658360	Curious, curious, right?
28658360	28660360	I'll try again.
28660360	28662360	Because 14...
28663360	28665360	Like, I can do this, honestly.
28665360	28667360	It's just so...
28667360	28669360	I'm trying to avoid that guy.
28669360	28671360	I'll try to avoid that guy.
28671360	28673360	I think I just need to let the horse
28673360	28675360	maybe directly steer,
28675360	28677360	even if the horse is a little off.
28677360	28679360	Because the steering...
28679360	28681360	As soon as I stand on the horse's saddle,
28681360	28683360	the steering...
28684360	28686360	Oh.
28686360	28688360	What is it? I don't know.
28688360	28690360	So, I just realized since you're in Australia,
28690360	28692360	does that mean you've been streaming since 3am?
28692360	28694360	4am is my stream time.
28694360	28696360	Daylight saving and stuff.
28697360	28699360	But it's healthy...
28699360	28701360	It's healthy.
28701360	28703360	It means I can do stuff during the day.
28703360	28705360	Oh, 13, 13!
28705360	28707360	Okay, I don't know.
28707360	28709360	I genuinely didn't do anything different.
28709360	28711360	I think it really is just luck of the draw or something,
28711360	28713360	because I did not do anything...
28715360	28717360	Ah, I thought I was going to say, hopefully,
28717360	28719360	I'm going to get two in a row.
28720360	28722360	This is such a bizarre,
28722360	28723360	like,
28723360	28725360	challenge-type thing, honestly.
28730360	28731360	No!
28731360	28733360	Why, why, why, why?
28733360	28734360	30!
28734360	28735360	No, not 30!
28735360	28736360	13!
28736360	28737360	13!
28738360	28739360	Mmm.
28739360	28740360	Spreads build up just straight up and...
28740360	28741360	Ah!
28742360	28744360	All bits are so, like...
28745360	28746360	Neaxanoid in the moment.
28746360	28748360	See, yeah, that was, like, hardly any build up to it,
28748360	28750360	so I think that's why that one's on the wall.
28753360	28754360	Mmm.
28755360	28757360	Let's not be knocking down women.
28757360	28759360	I only want to knock up women.
28759360	28760360	Thank you very much.
28761360	28762360	Oh, wait!
28762360	28763360	I don't want to knock down women.
28763360	28765360	I only want to knock them up!
28766360	28767360	Please laugh.
28772360	28774360	One more time without doing a massive thing.
28780360	28781360	I have a little thingy.
28781360	28782360	Yeah, I forgot.
28782360	28784360	I forgot I had it too.
28784360	28785360	Okay, I forgot.
28785360	28787360	Literally, I'll need to add a laughing track as well.
28787360	28790360	Oh, brother, this guy stinks!
28790360	28793360	Yeah, I'm going to have to add a...
28794360	28795360	I'll add a laughing track.
28795360	28797360	I should add a laughing track.
28797360	28798360	That's, like, one that's good,
28798360	28800360	and then one that's, like,
28800360	28802360	it gets a few coughs and, like, a giggle,
28802360	28803360	so it's, like, a bad joke.
28803360	28805360	I'm definitely going to need to get that.
28808360	28809360	I need to hydrate.
28809360	28810360	My goodness.
28810360	28812360	Trying so hard to figure out, like,
28812360	28814360	what's determined in this jump or not?
28816360	28818360	I need some crickets, yeah.
28820360	28821360	Do the joke again.
28821360	28823360	I let my laugh in my other jacket.
28824360	28826360	Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket.
28826360	28828360	Ha-ha, you spelt it wrong.
28828360	28829360	Everyone pointing laugh.
28829360	28830360	You spelt his thing wrong,
28830360	28831360	and I read it out,
28831360	28832360	and now he's embarrassed.
28832360	28834360	Ha-ha-ha, streamer,
28834360	28836360	read out your message with a spelling error.
28836360	28837360	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
28837360	28839360	Oh, that was just gross.
28840360	28842360	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
28843360	28845360	Right, okay, we're going to try Gallop now.
28846360	28848360	The only issue with Gallop in
28848360	28850360	is if you Gallop through a crowd too much.
28853360	28854360	No, that was far too early.
28854360	28856360	Okay, I kind of struggled with this.
28856360	28858360	We'll try the Gallop from this side.
28859360	28860360	Life's over.
28860360	28861360	It's over.
28861360	28862360	You'll never recover.
28862360	28865360	Your social credit has been determined.
28865360	28866360	No, okay.
28866360	28869360	That Gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever.
28869360	28871360	I like how the horse is so responsive.
28871360	28872360	It's like, where'd you go?
28872360	28873360	Please come back.
28875360	28878360	Oh, is it the degration?
28878360	28879360	Degoration.
28879360	28880360	Degredation?
28880360	28881360	Degredation.
28881360	28882360	Degredation.
28882360	28884360	Degredation sounds correct.
28884360	28886360	I said a degredation.
28886360	28887360	Ooh, 12!
28889360	28891360	I'm just so surprised when it does happen.
28891360	28893360	It seems to happen in that direction
28893360	28895360	more than it happens in this direction.
28896360	28897360	Nope.
28897360	28898360	Well, close.
28898360	28899360	It's over.
28899360	28900360	Not quite.
28901360	28902360	I do want you on the beams,
28902360	28903360	but I want you to do that
28903360	28905360	with fancy flips that you do.
28905360	28906360	They should have made it 10.
28906360	28908360	No, they actually shouldn't have done this at all
28908360	28910360	because literally, how would you have discovered that
28910360	28911360	Exo can even do this?
28911360	28913360	I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered
28913360	28914360	that he could do this.
28916360	28917360	Good night.
28917360	28918360	Rest well.
28918360	28919360	Thank you for hanging.
28920360	28921360	We're, uh...
28922360	28924360	Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for.
28924360	28925360	I've accidentally covered it up
28925360	28928360	by a little list of things that I need to do.
28928360	28929360	Oopsie, oopsie.
28930360	28931360	Oh, that was like...
28931360	28932360	Really?
28932360	28933360	Nope.
28936360	28939360	It feels like it has cooled down, honestly.
28939360	28940360	The brain rot took over.
28940360	28941360	Yeah, it took over long ago.
28941360	28942360	I apologize.
28943360	28944360	Eight hours.
28944360	28945360	I've only been streaming eight hours,
28945360	28946360	and I've got a few more in me.
28948360	28949360	I want this one over
28949360	28951360	because I never want to have to do it again.
28952360	28954360	I don't want to have to come back to this,
28954360	28956360	but I know you guys have been literally watching me
28956360	28957360	do a backflip on...
28957360	28959360	Do a flip on a horse for like ten minutes now.
28959360	28960360	It's gonna be just...
28960360	28961360	No one's laughing.
28963360	28964360	Getting aggravated now.
28964360	28965360	Great.
28965360	28966360	I am running.
28966360	28967360	I am running.
28967360	28968360	I am holding.
28968360	28969360	Oh!
28969360	28970360	Hmm.
28971360	28972360	Eleven?
28974360	28976360	Okay, I think it's eleven now.
28976360	28977360	I don't know why.
28977360	28980360	Right, I'll run up for ages.
28980360	28981360	Hold.
28981360	28982360	Nope.
28985360	28987360	Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there.
28987360	28989360	We're almost there.
28990360	28991360	No flip.
28991360	28992360	Absolutely.
28992360	28994360	Only eight hours.
28994360	28996360	Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place
28996360	28999360	when you see me only online for like two hours tomorrow.
28999360	29000360	You're gonna be like,
29000360	29001360	what's wrong?
29001360	29002360	Is she sick?
29002360	29003360	Where's my horse?
29004360	29005360	Oh, I'm sorry.
29006360	29008360	Oh no, you have done.
29014360	29015360	Ten, ten.
29015360	29017360	Right, I feel like it always happens
29017360	29018360	come in this direction
29018360	29020360	instead of the other direction.
29021360	29022360	Skillshare can't even do a flip.
29022360	29024360	We're not flipping out on you.
29024360	29026360	You're not flipping out on me?
29029360	29030360	Insert laugh track here
29030360	29031360	that I still haven't added yet,
29031360	29033360	but I will add the laugh track soon to you.
29034360	29036360	Please get the heck out of my way.
29036360	29037360	I'm trying to do flips.
29045360	29047360	Can you leave me alone?
29048360	29049360	No.
29052360	29054360	No money is worth this, he said.
29056360	29058360	I do need to kill from horseback.
29059360	29061360	So maybe just do that real quick.
29065360	29066360	We'll just do this one
29066360	29067360	to add to the horseback one.
29067360	29068360	So we're still making progress
29068360	29070360	even though it's very good.
29071360	29072360	Let's try this.
29074360	29075360	I did it!
29081360	29082360	Okay, that's the sound
29082360	29084360	I need to add right now.
29085360	29087360	But if I do the flip, it goes ehhhhh.
29088360	29089360	Don't worry,
29089360	29090360	I'll get a little bit for you.
29090360	29091360	I'm dead.
29096360	29097360	Flipping on a beam off a hole
29097360	29099360	or is this sucks
29099360	29100360	and I don't know
29100360	29102360	why they asked for a twin.
29104360	29108360	stop taking people's horses.
29108360	29112360	It's really not nice.
29112360	29116360	I'm looking to see if there's like a
29116360	29120360	prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever
29120360	29124360	but there's no happening.
29124360	29128360	There's no happening but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it.
29128360	29132360	Well, that's probably not going to work now.
29132360	29136360	I have lost my mind.
29136360	29140360	Literally I've been doing flips for so long. Please.
29140360	29144360	Free me. Free me from the beam.
29144360	29148360	Oh, nine. Finally.
29148360	29152360	Wow.
29156360	29160360	No, it's still below the beam.
29160360	29164360	You could have easily sat back on the horse, I'll be honest.
29164360	29168360	The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed.
29168360	29172360	He's killed to kill to pull fun.
29172360	29176360	Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Okay, that was
29176360	29180360	excuse me. I think I need it. I think I can kill him
29180360	29184360	and it'll count for the horseback.
29184360	29188360	Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry.
29188360	29192360	Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well.
29192360	29196360	There we go. One.
29196360	29200360	Two.
29200360	29204360	Three. Or I'm going to throw rocks through
29204360	29208360	your window.
29208360	29212360	Okay, let's try this again. Oh, no, don't jump.
29212360	29216360	No, stay. Try again. Try again.
29216360	29220360	You mustn't offend the left.
29220360	29224360	You wouldn't like me when I'm angry, can you? Oh, seven.
29224360	29228360	Seven? I think seven.
29228360	29232360	I still have yet to
29232360	29236360	figure out what determines it, but once it's over with, we don't have to do it again.
29236360	29240360	We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god, I've not done that.
29240360	29244360	Can we do a triple? Can we do a triple? It's like my subconscious understanding
29244360	29248360	what I need to do, even though my brain, like, my actual conscious doesn't...
29248360	29252360	No, we got a double though. So it's six.
29252360	29256360	Only six more to go. I've never done back to back. That's fantastic.
29256360	29260360	I was literally like, is my subconscious knowing what's up? But my conscious
29260360	29264360	is like, can't... mmm, that was far too early.
29264360	29268360	I need to put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible.
29268360	29272360	Wow. Oh, baby.
29274360	29278360	Top 10 moments of 24.
29278360	29282360	Welcome to WatchMojo. Well, we rate the
29282360	29286360	worst little
29286360	29290360	side quest things that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood randomly give you, because it is a bit
29290360	29294360	arbitrary.
29294360	29298360	Yeah.
29298360	29302360	Only six
29302360	29306360	more. Can you hold on?
29306360	29310360	I'm starting to lose
29310360	29314360	a little bit, but that's okay, because we got five. We got five.
29314360	29318360	I was going to say it would be a triple. Get out of my
29318360	29322360	hand. Look, I wasn't kidding when people were like, why would you
29322360	29326360	describe Shubi as like, everything you should have been?
29326360	29330360	I wasn't kidding. Was I kidding?
29330360	29334360	Oh, four! Four! Four!
29334360	29338360	Cheat run.
29338360	29342360	F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...
29342360	29346360	F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...
29346360	29350360	F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f
29350360	29358360	Wow, four, that was too slow.
29358360	29364360	We're sounding so country.
29364360	29371360	Wow, the sound of the ice cream.
29372360	29378360	Three, three, three, three,
29378360	29388360	three, two, two, two, two,
29388360	29392360	two, two, two...
29392360	29394360	All the two, two, two,
29394360	29396360	all the two, two,
29396360	29399360	all of that was gonna get the Truffle there.
29399360	29407200	Two more. Two more. The people listening in right now that are like waiting on
29407200	29412560	Mercy to start they're like please for the love of God mercy start early.
29415840	29425840	One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Just one more time.
29426640	29432320	We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah jumping on the horse beam.
29435440	29442640	Do the random say thing for the guilt quiz because it's so silly. Just one more time.
29443600	29447120	We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah.
29448080	29457360	Oh don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and
29460960	29466800	your daddy your dad tells everyone don't ever give me such a silly thing again.
29466800	29473600	That was absolute torture. Lower guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam.
29474160	29475840	No guards.
29480080	29484320	Okay the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to
29484320	29492400	no because they would have to be below me. Where is a beam that a rider goes past because I think
29492400	29496720	that's what I have to assassinate. It's enough horsing around. No dive on.
29497120	29502880	I think if I do this I might get the horseback kills.
29518000	29521600	Uh uh please come under this beam over here please harass me under this beam please
29521600	29524800	harass me under this beam I can't believe the game literally just trained me for this moment
29524800	29528320	please come under the beam please come under the beam I take all back I'm sorry these guilt
29534000	29542960	these skills I'm sorry these skills I'm sorry I didn't believe you these skills I didn't believe
29542960	29553840	you I'm sorry where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where
29553920	29557760	it's located it's not up here it doesn't feel like it's up here at all
29561120	29565920	ah mission failed you get I'm next time literally where the heck are these beams
29567280	29572960	are there any beams anywhere the only beam around here is me having a beamer because
29572960	29581280	of how freaking embarrassed in this gameplay is to have a beamer means that you are embarrassed
29581280	29584000	and have scarlet face or a red face
29584000	29602720	um
29603440	29604720	um
29605760	29606320	just to be like
29607280	29615920	uh levope does have missions I am going to buy ammo and I'm going to do this stationary guy
29615920	29622880	one because it's really easy to do it in this quest so I'm going to go buy ammo and we're going
29622880	29628400	to replay a mission that gives us one of the thieves guilds requirements
29628400	29638560	yeah Claudio yeah she does as well um I'm trying to do sorry who goes there um
29641520	29645120	oh goodness me I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating from a very
29653600	29658000	what is needy smear overload it is uh unfortunately I actually don't
29658080	29661680	know too much about the game but it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the

29761680	29768400	waking up after yeah it's gonna be an interesting day but I do have endurance streams every week
29768400	29776960	kind of planned as long as all goes well and I'll see what the clipping situation is uh
29779600	29780560	hi Leonardo
29781440	29788000	it's you the people apartments are in turmoil cesare is ill and the pope dead it was your doing
29788720	29793120	was it not Leonardo I swear to you he did not die by my hand
29793920	29799280	this world gets stranger every day I shall have to focus on my painting I work on the small
29799280	29805440	portrait of a woman I'm growing rather fond of it hmm do not let a beautiful girl distract you
29805440	29813040	from constructing my designs I have no worries women provide little distraction wait I don't get it
29814000	29817760	he's a gay boy so it's pride month doesn't he be like that man
29819600	29822880	doesn't he be like that that's nice oh I have everything
29826480	29831040	if you decide to buy something look for the chalk outline on bench I don't have anything to
29831040	29839200	purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again you have all that I can give
29839200	29842960	now you're on your own ah Leonardo give back you
29845280	29851440	give me some of that good day for catching up on clips and bars and things and no endurance
29851440	29857120	yeah um so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have
29857120	29861120	to click like and stream at the same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs
29861120	29866160	all the girls and all that uh and deal with audios and blah blah blah so I don't want to stress them
29866160	29872880	out so when you guys like do a make a youtube clip I can go on their accounts and see what
29872880	29879280	someone's clipped and if it is like clippable worthy I can then send the timestamp onto like an
29879280	29887440	actual clip editor to make clips for them um I just need to see how it works out in theory
29887440	29891440	obviously when I do endurance streams I can't do any of it like right now for them um
29891520	29901040	but we will see how it goes I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need
29901040	29906560	more clippers of this particular style because there's a particular clipping editing style
29907280	29914720	that I'm looking for the most recent mersey shorts the blonde hair short and the other
29915280	29923280	short a forgotten um is the clipping style so if you really can do that editing style
29924080	29930560	you know don't be afraid to hit up the website uh because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point
29931440	29936720	good thing I got a few clips already my job is not nice either if you're a general clipper
29936720	29942080	uh we just I'm still interested in doing the clipping enterprise that like idol end done
29942080	29947040	which is really good um obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my
29947040	29953360	funds and the money looks like and all that um because will it tell you a really embarrassing fact
29954160	29963920	you know the earlier uh like um the earlier uh clips that came out shorts that were on the
29963920	29969920	girls channels um emmy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually
29970560	29975520	but I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed I was like I'm so sorry
29975520	29982160	girls this is the best I can do because we had quite a few issues behind the scenes production
29982160	29989520	wise with timing it was a freaking nightmare um so like all my attention was elsewhere and
29990320	29995200	like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers here's this these files like please wear them
29996160	30001120	um which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about
30001120	30004080	like where I failed the girls and like I definitely feel like I've failed with them
30004880	30011440	on the clips because the actual plan was the count school live for two weeks before stream
30011440	30018640	and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and
30018640	30024800	I feel really bad about it like I feel wrong um but like the dust is kind of set off already done
30024800	30035040	this but the dust is like kind of settling now the only bad thing is that for now time zone only
30035040	30043440	you and I see stream at normal times okay you may be not in a normal way yeah
30051360	30054880	no like it definitely went well like absolutely no denying like
30055760	30056800	where am I trying to go
30060880	30070880	um I'm definitely not denying like debut went well and everything just like I had planned
30070880	30076400	things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all
30076400	30080240	I just realized I need to leave the face uh we're going to be jumping off this building for quite
30080240	30087920	well um like I understand it's not possible for everything are you serious it's for everything
30087920	30094960	to like come out the way of my head um like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted
30094960	30101920	them to um but because of like production issues I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in
30101920	30112000	time for anything really and it was just like ah but yeah yeah are you winning strong absolutely um
30112000	30120000	are you winning excuse me I'm using this hay bale I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick
30120000	30125280	I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith
30126160	30132400	no it's ill into the hay bale no it's ill into the hay bale
30135600	30142480	yeah it was a timing issue um we love artists in this house we do but um
30143840	30152880	I had given very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking
30152880	30162320	and pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked
30162320	30168400	with me and you did go over deadline like please don't worry um like it's not like a big deal
30168400	30172880	anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and
30172960	30183360	like that's that's the facts but I had a lot of delays and basically I had planned every month in
30183360	30188880	advance being like this month I'll be focused on this this month I'll be focused on that and what
30188880	30198720	happened was everything had to be done in May and like I'm not gonna lie I like cried a few times
30198720	30206160	out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough because I have to wait for
30207120	30214080	someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of
30215840	30222480	like issues with um people not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like
30222480	30229440	hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey um like the subtitle that you put here um like it's
30229440	30234960	quite clear that she didn't say this but you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey
30234960	30239840	the audio literally cuts out in the middle of this can you re-render like I don't know what like
30240800	30248240	it was it was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the the girls know a bit more in detail
30248320	30255120	exactly what I'm talking about um because like I showed them like we are like I'm constantly
30255120	30260160	sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the
30260160	30265120	fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version
30265120	30270640	of something it's like no 24 hours I'll do it in the morning I'll do it later and I'm like I have
30270640	30277040	paid premium rates I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work you should quality
30277040	30283840	check it before you send it to me and like bro it was just a cascading effect and it was pretty
30283840	30293440	horrible um but yeah but we're here now so and there were so many lessons learned like um
30294400	30298880	ripped to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler but like everyone's getting
30298880	30307040	contracts like conscripted and stuff like um and being like if you miss this deadline like
30307040	30314640	you know it's just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the
30314640	30323680	benefit of the doubt but holy is this even counting for leaps of faith uh yeah like deadlines are so
30323680	30334960	important and having that like oh wow we're one off of leaf of faith um literally in the end we
30334960	30340880	made it everything worked out fight wait did that guard hurt himself I don't remember hurting him um
30342160	30349840	like we made it in the end but yeah rough rough not fun but I'm now like I just want to stream
30349840	30353040	I just want to have fun I want to show off my games I want to have a good time I want to make
30353040	30357760	ASMR I want to do everything that I've wanted to do while I get to do it alongside like these
30357760	30362560	amazing girls type thing um and I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes
30362560	30367600	like obviously the the the current goal is YouTube to please stop calling us and like
30367600	30372240	admit that we're real like streamers and stuff you don't need colors like there's plenty of content
30373600	30379200	on the channels now but yeah like it definitely like everything works out in the end
30379200	30383360	absolutely is everyone max level
30386320	30394000	no three people aren't max oh I didn't mean to do that but hey yeah like the worst part is over
30395200	30403920	wait what the heck oopsies I'm to kill the mailman not to be confused with the sand man
30403920	30409680	that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz that was ridiculous
30410880	30418160	never heard of that first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard the song but like what

30460800	30465120	oh you're using the new info I can't believe it YouTube on softwares
30466080	30470080	it's old european folklore of course it's nonsense true

31201760	31204480	maybe on the outside of the policy that looks up man
31207840	31209200	give me that feather
31212640	31213440	true love
31214320	31220160	girlfriend roleplay something what could a hand-holder roleplay blessing yeah like so i did have a few
31220160	31226080	variations of like would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like
31226080	31231360	what's the point it's just a real agency at that point
31234320	31241600	um where the hype was that other feather oh it's literally split perfectly in the middle
31242640	31249040	where there is the jump off point oh wait we have a parachute all right we'll just use a
31249040	31250240	parachute off the coliseum
31256640	31259760	temple popping roughly where you can hear audible oh in me
31266240	31267280	right we're just gonna do this
31267280	31273120	here assassinate
31276400	31282560	group roleplay is a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well i'm coming out
31283760	31288480	uh it just came in each time to sell i only want them to come out once the calling has stopped
31288480	31298480	because literally it's like such a shame that it is still happening even though like we're like
31298480	31301920	getting into the stage where it's like yeah we've like got proper streams now so i'm not really
31301920	31307920	sure what the deal is like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them
31307920	31312320	at this point because i'm like what's going on with asmr i think there may have been a stealth
31312320	31318160	policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly uh feathers up here um
31324240	31330640	this is a little sister you argued has an innocent name yeah i'm not arguing in what's
31330640	31337360	innocent it was oh cool okay right we're gonna use the
31341360	31347040	yeah there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because
31348320	31353920	there's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine
31354720	31363040	and they're my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because asmr is such a popular
31363040	31368800	category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category and they don't want to come out and say
31368800	31378720	it so they're just tackling it like silently basically so it's not arguing this thing um
31379520	31386240	i i think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr
31386240	31392080	i think they like said it's like one of the top four categories sorry like in the top 10 searches
31392080	31398240	a variation of either like foodie in or asmr medicines like whatever you want to kind of
31398240	31405920	really get into it um it's like such a high watched category that if they publicly said like
31405920	31411120	hey we're drawing the line here now i do think there will be a post at some point
31411120	31417920	but at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done so the content is no longer available so when
31417920	31425120	they do go publicly like hey we've actually changed this people are like oh that's fine because
31425120	31429920	like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know you've been deleting channels less than
31429920	31437760	right and uh handing out warnings willy nilly so yeah that's my guess by the way this is absolutely
31437760	31446880	not factual this is like just what my genuine like what i think is going on um youtube is
31446880	31453040	just like i see yeah it's literally just my guess what's going on it seems the most probable to me
31453360	31463600	um so unfortunately i think like you're looking content it's just gonna have to be like
31465600	31478160	just straight up upload it to twitter or put on patreon solution and i know a lot of people are
31478160	31484720	like oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon unfortunately in order to link your
31484720	31494160	patreon successfully um everything must be behind the paywall for like even if it's a fine audio that
31494160	31501520	is not wrong with it um it has to all be behind the paywall it's bizarre it's bizarre the rules get
31501520	31507760	very arbitrary in memoria now you're wrong youtube's wrong
31514240	31524320	all right let me see we've done the feathers i have no idea how many things i've done right we're
31524320	31526480	getting close to doing the courtisms
31531600	31540560	yeah like we're supposed to enemy stations right we're gonna do that now because i know
31540560	31547600	how to do that you have to replay a memory from the french one
31548320	31550880	no
31555280	31563760	yes this is one can you stream to x i wouldn't stream on twitter no need money
31565840	31569520	like i hate to i hate to be that one i know it sounds really sucky we're like money money money
31569520	31575200	but it's like the obviously the girls need my support and the thing with youtube vods is like
31576160	31582960	you always like make money on youtube vods and like oh yeah once inside your men can
31582960	31587120	overpower the camp's patrols correct made money around yes especially if they're patrolling
31587120	31591040	i think it's fine saying like yes we're not an agency for greed but at the end of the day we need to
31591040	31597680	liberate several suits of french armor and don't and youtube vods is like a fantastic way or the
31597760	31604800	youtube adds on like a smaller video for example like this kind of stuff is like free to make
31604800	31608880	content like it's free for me to scream right now you know troops will gather it from the dead
31608880	31615680	and people underestimate the value of ad revenue via advertise like the free like add
31616400	31618720	the armor has to stay clean
31621280	31627760	right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like
31627760	31631040	oh there's a horse right there oh there's another horse right there
31635840	31640000	business is business can't do everything for you unfortunately yes the world does run on
31640560	31644800	no i'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these days
31646080	31652240	um we'll go this way instead yeah this way is like so much better you basically for some reason
31652240	31660960	if you snipe the guys in this one um they count towards that court is on thing but if you snipe
31660960	31666880	in general it doesn't count oh sugar i'm sorry no i didn't want to do that
31670080	31676400	actually hold on hold on i'm gonna disarm and kill with this one weapon there we go one of five
31677360	31685120	nine percent of all my problems from silver money it is a terrible
31691600	31697200	okay we might have to do this place place i'm not sure well that guy's coming over to
31697200	31704400	investigate thank you another free kill is that guy coming to investigate oh these guys are
31704400	31712040	I'll take it.
31712040	31715840	I will loot them just so I can get some of them back.
31715840	31723120	That's how the next one might be.
31723120	31728600	We appreciate that thing, but please do always consider supporting the girls.
31729600	31732600	We should get crossbow bolts from this.
31732600	31734600	Hydration check, hydration check.
31734600	31740600	I've been yammering, but I've not had much water today.
31740600	31746600	I don't know when we can submit for monetization yet.
31746600	31750600	As I said, the stats are no update.
31750600	31755600	So it's kind of just...
31755600	31758600	They're very casually like...
31758600	31760600	Oh, excuse me, sorry.
31760600	31762600	Oh, excuse me, sorry.
31762600	31764600	Okay, I'm going to help.
31764600	31766600	I'm calling the assassins and...
31769600	31772600	Oh, I just teabagged them as they died.
31772600	31775600	Okay, that was a rather unit.
31775600	31777600	Let's not do that again.
31777600	31780600	That was really not a move.
31781600	31784600	Mm-hmm.
31784600	31796600	But yes, once the YouTube calling stops, then please do look around for very fun ASMR collabs coming out.
31796600	31801600	Very, very large ASMR collabs that cost a lot of money put together by Heihou.
31802600	31819600	Um, sorry, I'm trying to bramble and think and get this done.
31819600	31827600	I like how he's suspicious even though I literally just perished that guy right there.
31827600	31830600	God, I wish there was a way to pay for all the girls' patrons at once.
31830600	31832600	I just got 16 months back to back.
31832600	31833600	Oh, you support them as patrons?
31833600	31834600	Thank you so much.
31834600	31835600	That's very kind of you.
31835600	31836600	Thank you.
31836600	31842600	Yes, actually, special thank you to literally anyone who has supported the girls on Patreon.
31842600	31852600	I understand the patrons that you have one audio and it's very kind of you to like, you know, reach out and do that even though there's literally one audio.
31852600	31857600	And there are coming because the audio is released on the first.
31857600	31862600	The girls are going to have a consistent day that their audio in particular comes out.
31862600	31865600	I really hope this is counting towards the challenge, actually.
31865600	31867600	Um...
31871600	31874600	Grave, I'm having to go all the way around.
31875600	31878600	Wow.
31881600	31882600	Okay, that was it.
31882600	31887600	Right, I just need to redo that and then I think that'll be it for the mission.
31887600	31890600	Eh, for the crotch design.
31890600	31893600	Right, let me just check the DNA sequence.
31893600	31895600	I say that as I literally just close it.
31895600	31899600	That should have counted quite a bit towards that one.
31902600	31903600	Two?
31904600	31909600	That came in as two.
31914600	31916600	Why did that not work?
31917600	31920600	Is it because I kept getting detected?
31922600	31924600	Oh, brother.
31928600	31930600	Guards on horseback ears.
31930600	31933600	Guards killed Will on horseback.
31935600	31940600	PayPal guards, I need to go all the way.
31942600	31944600	Guards air assassinate from a beam.
31944600	31947600	Actually, we're closer to getting the thieves done.
31947600	31949600	I need to find a beam.
31949600	31952600	I don't know where the beam is to assassinate them.
31954600	31957600	The mercenaries one is like absolute killer.
31957600	31959600	So we got a patreoner just paid for you.
31959600	31962600	Oh, thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it.
31963600	31966600	Y'all are expected way more hate.
31966600	31971600	Honestly, I think we all did, but I think everyone's just on the same page.
31971600	31978600	You're probably tired at this point of your reach over just teasing and teasing and never giving anything.
31978600	31982600	And then it's like, yeah, we're just having a good time.
31982600	31984600	If you want the goods, you know where they are.
31984600	31986600	If you don't, there's also free stuff coming out.
31986600	31989600	There's a free video game coming out.
31990600	31993600	I think it probably helps without the greed out.
31993600	31998600	I think if it was a greedy looking corporation, that probably wouldn't help.
32002600	32006600	Right, I'm going to bump into guards and then run away from them and hide in spots.
32008600	32010600	We'll do the bump because there's a hay bale right here.
32011600	32012600	Excuse me?
32013600	32014600	Oh, sugar.
32014600	32016600	Oh, I don't think I can hide in this.
32017600	32022600	Okay, let's see how fast can I hide now?
32027600	32028600	Oh, no.
32028600	32030600	Oh, no, they're right next to me.
32033600	32034600	No, don't check it.
32034600	32035600	Don't check it.
32035600	32036600	Don't check it.
32036600	32037600	Don't check it.
32037600	32038600	Don't check it.
32040600	32043600	That shouldn't happen.
32043600	32045600	Oh, there's more guards up here.
32045600	32048600	I thought this district was like, there's no guards here at all.
32056600	32057600	Oh, yes, the bench.
32057600	32058600	The bench of safety.
32058600	32061600	Okay, I can't go on the bench because it's not like...
32061600	32064600	Oh, for goodness sake, how many of you are there?
32066600	32068600	Oh, right, I'm hiding in here.
32068600	32069600	Can't get me.
32072600	32073600	Does that count?
32076600	32077600	Did it count?
32077600	32079600	He seems still annoyed at me.
32080600	32083600	I'm just going to check that counted because if it does...
32084600	32085600	Not the poking.
32085600	32090600	If that did count, I'm literally just going to keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again.
32092600	32093600	I think it should have counted those.
32094600	32095600	I did it!
32095600	32096600	Right, time to keep bumping into them.
32096600	32100600	I'm going to kill this guard up here though because he's going to keep ruining it.
32103600	32104600	Yeah.
32106600	32107600	Woo!
32111600	32112600	Oh!
32112600	32113600	Ow!
32114600	32117600	Right, let's go upset some guards.
32121600	32123600	You smell so bad!
32124600	32125600	Tee hee!
32125600	32127600	Now you have to chase me.
32130600	32132600	Miss me, miss me, now you have to kiss me.
32133600	32135600	Oh, is that supposed to jump off?
32140600	32141600	Where's the bail hay?
32141600	32142600	Oh, there it is.
32152600	32153600	A...
32153600	32154600	Six.
32160600	32161600	Yank!
32163600	32164600	I've got to get out of here!
32164600	32165600	I've got to get out of here!
32176600	32179600	And then we just dive into this again.
32182600	32183600	Oh!
32185600	32186600	I'm not sure that counted.
32186600	32188600	He was like so close.
32189600	32190600	You guys should know.
32192600	32193600	No, I'm sorry.
32193600	32194600	Please excuse me.
32194600	32195600	Ah, please excuse me.
32195600	32196600	I'm scared.
32196600	32197600	There's a table in the way.
32197600	32198600	I got nervous.
32198600	32199600	I'm sorry.
32202600	32203600	Oh no, I can't claim this way.
32203600	32204600	Okay, he jumped down again.
32206600	32207600	Ah!
32207600	32208600	He's gone a long last.
32208600	32209600	Please leave him.
32210600	32211600	Leave me alone.
32212600	32213600	Ah!
32215600	32216600	Jump!
32219600	32221600	They're like instantly giving up.
32221600	32224600	I'm like really worried that it's not counting, but...
32228600	32229600	No, it is.
32229600	32231600	It just doesn't look like it.
32231600	32232600	It looks so silly.
32235600	32236600	And Mercy online?
32236600	32238600	Heck yeah, Mercy's online.
32238600	32239600	Let's go.
32243600	32246600	Is there any mods still even awake at this point?
32246600	32247600	You're more than welcome to link.
32248600	32249600	Mercy.
32252600	32254600	And please enjoy your stream.
32255600	32258600	I think we're going to wrap up the guild's challenge.
32258600	32259600	Oh!
32259600	32260600	I hit C.
32260600	32261600	I'm just going to squat in the hairball.
32264600	32265600	See you in the clip.
32273600	32274600	Can you hear that?
32274600	32275600	Or am I going crazy?
32279600	32280600	Am I going...
32282600	32285600	Did I hear that right?
32285600	32286600	Yeah, okay.
32286600	32287600	I'm going to...
32287600	32288600	I was like...
32288600	32290600	Are you all hearing that thing?
32292600	32293600	Literally.
32295600	32300600	I wonder if it's left over ambience from the party sequence with the banker.
32301600	32302600	Last one.
32304600	32305600	Okay.
32308600	32309600	I hear it again.
32309600	32311600	Is there like people here?
32311600	32313600	Or is it just SFX?
32315600	32316600	More like SFX.
32320600	32322600	Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here.
32322600	32324600	I must just be background ambience.
32324600	32328600	That's left over from the party sequence with the banker.
32329600	32334600	Let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really aggressive.
32335600	32337600	There's still asset, literally.
32337600	32339600	The party ended many a day ago.
32340600	32342600	They just played an operation.
32344600	32345600	Crazy.
32345600	32346600	That's crazy.
32346600	32347600	Right.
32348600	32350600	I'm starting to get a bit delirious.
32352600	32354600	How much should we survive though?
32364600	32365600	Mm-hmm.
32365600	32366600	Mm-hmm.
32367600	32369600	I don't know why that did so little.
32376600	32378600	I'm watching all the girls, right?
32379600	32381600	A long watch strategy before...
32381600	32382600	Isn't there not too much noise?
32382600	32384600	Like, there's too much noise going on.
32384600	32385600	Like, focus.
32388600	32390600	We're all blabbing away at once.
32391600	32392600	Blabbing.
32397600	32399600	I'm not too sure what to do.
32399600	32400600	I'm kind of getting...
32400600	32401600	I'm not, like, stuck.
32401600	32402600	I know we can do those things.
32402600	32406600	I'm just, like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do.
32409600	32410600	Um...
32414600	32415600	I'm just, like...
32416600	32419600	Do we call it and then the next thing come on?
32419600	32420600	Am I gonna...
32420600	32422600	I'm like, I'm saying it myself.
32422600	32425600	Am I gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now?
32425600	32426600	Is one.
32427600	32428600	Think I'm...
32428600	32430600	I think I'm in back yet?
32431600	32434600	Oh, in 19 seconds they come back.
32435600	32441600	Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that.
32444600	32445600	I can only focus...
32445600	32446600	It's hard to multitask.
32446600	32448600	I'm watchable script, right?
32450600	32451600	But Mercy is alive.
32451600	32452600	If anyone would like to watch...
32452600	32453600	Mm, Mercy Modis.
32455600	32456600	Oh, I saw that.
32456600	32457600	Okay, there are...
32458600	32461600	There are thieves somewhere on the roof up here.
32464600	32465600	No.
32471600	32472600	I'm just coercing.
32473600	32474600	Um...
32474600	32475600	Um...
32477600	32482600	I think for simplicity we'll just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them.
32482600	32484600	I struggle so much to find thieves.
32484600	32488600	I understand they're on roof tops, but they make it so freaking hard.
32489600	32490600	Run Vods of...
32491600	32494600	Run Vods of all six at once and let it just fry your brain.
32495600	32497600	Most of that is four, but only one audio.
32497600	32503600	Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get saved once POV.
32505600	32506600	Mm...
32506600	32508600	I have teleported to the wrong place.
32508600	32509600	I was not paying attention.
32509600	32510600	I apologize.
32510600	32512600	Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy.
32512600	32513600	Hello?
32513600	32515600	Would you like to be purchased?
32519600	32521600	It would be a shame not to do Christina though.
32521600	32523600	Like we're actually so close.
32526600	32527600	Ah!
32528600	32531600	What's the percentage we need for Christina?
32535600	32540600	Why is your accent so cool?
32540600	32542600	Spondin' Scotland!
32543600	32544600	And...
32544600	32546600	Always be Scottish.
32546600	32548600	It's very hard to unlearn that accent.
32549600	32550600	I even think it's possible.
32552600	32553600	Truly outlawing it.
32554600	32555600	Um...
32555600	32556600	Why was I here again?
32556600	32560600	Oh, to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here.
32561600	32563600	I need to hire one group of thieves.
32563600	32564600	Is this for real?
32564600	32565600	For real?
32565600	32566600	Like for real?
32566600	32567600	For real?
32569600	32574600	Well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over.
32575600	32578600	And it's kind of in this general area.
32579600	32580600	I'm at...
32582600	32584600	Unbelievably.
32584600	32586600	I'm at 69%.
32586600	32587600	Um...
32591600	32592600	Like...
32593600	32594600	I don't know why.
32595600	32597600	Locate memory and world.
32597600	32599600	Insufficient data to accent.
32599600	32600600	Locate memory and world.
32600600	32603600	Go to memory start point to synchronize with animals.
32603600	32604600	Gotta go to work.
32604600	32606600	Have fun at work.
32606600	32609600	If you could have any other accent, what would it be?
32615600	32616600	Ah!
32616600	32618600	Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it.
32618600	32619600	That's missing.
32619600	32620600	We'll do Copernacle.
32621600	32623600	Um, as for accent...
32628600	32630600	I can't imagine myself wearing her now, honestly.
32631600	32632600	Like, to pick one.
32633600	32635600	The Italian accent can be really nice.
32635600	32640600	Although the Japanese voices are so nice and pitched.
32642600	32644600	Which I really enjoy.
32644600	32647600	But I guess it's pitch and no actual voice.
32650600	32651600	Uh...
32652600	32653600	Her accent.
32655600	32661600	Honestly, I don't actually mind a Polish accent.
32661600	32665600	If you've ever listened to a sweet Polish accent,
32665600	32667600	it can actually be really soothing.
32668600	32671600	Just a little hint of her words from that.
32671600	32672600	It's pretty good.
32672600	32675600	Apply the Scottish accent to any language.
32675600	32676600	Any language.
32678600	32679600	Oh, you might apply it.
32683600	32684600	I want you.
32687600	32688600	I want sex now.
32691600	32692600	As you believed.
32695600	32696600	Volgmae.
32697600	32698600	That's Scottish Dutch.
32701600	32702600	That's pretty awful.
32703600	32704600	Pray rough.
32704600	32705600	Pray rough.
32705600	32707600	Right, we'll try Copernacle,
32707600	32711600	but this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA.
32711600	32712600	I think I'm gonna...
32712600	32714600	I think I'm perishing.
32715600	32716600	Unfortunately.
32718600	32722600	And it might be wiser to redirect into Mercy
32722600	32723600	and kind of have a break
32723600	32726600	and deal with these ASMR collages
32726600	32727600	and see what I'm looking at,
32727600	32731600	because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit.
32731600	32734600	The world itself is unchanging.
32734600	32737600	We must change to understand it.
32737600	32738600	It's secret.
32739600	32741600	Scottish is the best accent in British Isles.
32741600	32742600	Who is this man?
32743600	32744600	He comes from Russia.
32744600	32745600	The Welsh accent.
32745600	32746600	I hear his studies at Iboticalo,
32746600	32749600	but his words are unlike any other issue from that place.
32750600	32752600	I don't buy it to put Scottish accents first.
32753600	32754600	Scottish is magical.
32754600	32756600	Hearing German speaking with songs that we're in.
32756600	32758600	You're not good at the spheres dancing around the earth.
32759600	32761600	You know you have a good source accent
32761600	32763600	when people can't even understand you.
32767600	32769600	I could use an excuse to go to bed.
32769600	32770600	Yeah, I'm kind of like,
32770600	32771600	I think I'm actually lagging.
32771600	32772600	I can't believe it.
32772600	32775600	You're me saying I'm an endurance streamer.
32775600	32776600	I'm a liar.
32779600	32780600	How long did we make it?
32780600	32781600	How long did we make it?
32787600	32789600	Take no damage during the ambush.
32789600	32790600	Right, get the wee knife.
32792600	32793600	Two minutes!
32796600	32797600	Let's get the wee knife.
32800600	32801600	No.
32802600	32803600	Yeah, that's what I meant.
32804600	32807600	I'm going to call in two of my assassins.
32810600	32812600	That was way too early.
32812600	32814600	You saw the way he was wiggling that knife.
32818600	32819600	Whoa, why are you...
32819600	32821600	You know the guy that's right in front of us?
32821600	32822600	Maybe focus on my guy.
32825600	32826600	Oh no, my assassins...
32827600	32829600	Okay, my assassins are sticking around,
32829600	32830600	which I'm quite happy about.
32830600	32832600	I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins.
32833600	32835600	Just because...
32836600	32838600	If they kill them too fast,
32838600	32840600	they actually might all be spawned
32840600	32841600	and not help me at all,
32841600	32843600	which is quite funny to think about.
32844600	32846600	I do wish citizens would stop running
32846600	32848600	into the middle of the fight or near it.
32848600	32849600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
32849600	32850600	Don't hurt me, please.
32851600	32853600	If I take no damage, I win.
32857600	32858600	Oh.
32858600	32859600	I'm scared!
32859600	32862600	He's got such a long, frickin' pole!
32862600	32864600	He's got such a long, frickin' pole!
32865600	32867600	He's gonna hit me with it!
32870600	32872600	My assassin is trying to chase them,
32872600	32873600	but it's not happening.
32878600	32879600	I'm just hiding.
32879600	32881600	I'm letting my assassins do it.
32881600	32882600	Copernicus is fine.
32882600	32884600	His health bar is fine.
32888600	32889600	Oh, I got fined.
32889600	32890600	Oh, they caught me.
32892600	32894600	I don't want to get hit.
32894600	32895600	I'm so close to doing no hit.
32895600	32898600	Please, please, please.
32898600	32899600	Please.
32899600	32901600	Literally 13 seconds is all I ask.
32903600	32904600	Don't change up.
32904600	32906600	Don't do anything else.
32907600	32909600	Just four more seconds.
32911600	32912600	Okay, we did it.
32913600	32914600	We did it.
32914600	32915600	We did it.
32915600	32916600	We did it.
32916600	32917600	We did it.
32917600	32918600	We did it.
32918600	32919600	We did it.
32919600	32920600	I think we can do it.
32920600	32921600	I'm still running away
32921600	32922600	in case it counts.
32922600	32923600	I think it counts,
32923600	32924600	but I'm just gonna keep running,
32924600	32926600	running and running
32926600	32928600	in circles around the fountain.
32928600	32929600	Okay.
32932600	32933600	Yeah!
32934600	32935600	That's right.
32935600	32936600	I did that.
32941600	32942600	What did I do?
32945600	32947600	I didn't go up that much.
32949600	32951600	Right, I have terrible news.
32951600	32953600	Fake endurance streamer.
32953600	32954600	Absolutely horrible news.
32954600	32955600	100% poggers.
32955600	32956600	Yay!
32956600	32958600	You said 100%!
32959600	32961600	Now, we may genuinely return
32961600	32963600	to Brotherhood again
32963600	32964600	at a later date.
32966600	32967600	But I'm actually quite satisfied.
32967600	32968600	Literally, we did the campaign.
32968600	32970600	We've done all the DLC stuff now.
32971600	32972600	You did that so hard
32972600	32974600	that other people didn't find it.
32976600	32977600	Strolling it, if you don't finish it,
32977600	32980600	just means you need to do it.
32980600	32981600	Yes, I actually wouldn't mind
32981600	32983600	revisiting it at a later date.
32983600	32984600	I would like to play a bit more
32984600	32986600	Variety at this point.
32986600	32988600	I'm going to redirect
32988600	32989600	into
32991600	32993600	Mercy, so we can all enjoy her.
32994600	32995600	I can't believe it.
32995600	32996600	I'm not a real endurance streamer.
32996600	32997600	I only lasted
32998600	32999600	nine hours this time.
32999600	33000600	Gee willa curse.
33001600	33003600	Oh, I'm kind of basic.
33004600	33005600	I can't believe it.
33005600	33006600	I can't believe it.
33009600	33011600	Please do consider giving
33011600	33013600	a like and a subscribe
33013600	33014600	if you enjoyed.
33014600	33015600	YouTube may have unscripted
33016600	33017600	but don't worry,
33017600	33019600	I'm going to redirect you
33019600	33020600	into Mercy.
33022600	33023600	Into Merchandise.
33025600	33028600	Redirect, select stream.
33028600	33031600	Oh, she's playing Omori.
33031600	33032600	Omori.
33033600	33035600	That's Omori
33036600	33037600	when
33037600	33039600	Mercy plays
33039600	33041600	the tippy tippy thing.
33043600	33044600	That's pretty good.
33044600	33045600	Yeah, that's pretty good.
33055600	33057600	I got a copyright
33057600	33059600	on my Assassin's Creed Playthrough game
33059600	33060600	yesterday.
33061600	33062600	What?
33062600	33063600	Sorry, I just spotted that right now
33063600	33064600	and I'm like,
33064600	33065600	what?
33065600	33066600	I apologize.
33066600	33068600	Thank you so, so much
33068600	33070600	my lovely beflings
33070600	33071600	for watching.
33072600	33073600	Literally, I just checked it out.
33073600	33074600	I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game
33074600	33075600	has no copyright,
33075600	33077600	so it's a false copyright thing
33077600	33078600	going on.
33078600	33079600	But thank you so, so much
33079600	33080600	for hanging out.
33081600	33083600	Yeah, maybe not 100%
33083600	33084600	for the first time,
33084600	33085600	but we'll give it a shot.
33085600	33086600	I think we'll come back
33086600	33087600	and we'll feel refreshed
33087600	33088600	at a later date
33089600	33090600	because that was a lot of
33090600	33091600	jumping about.
33091600	33092600	I think that's brought
33092600	33093600	20 hours
33093600	33094600	combined
33094600	33095600	at this point.
33095600	33096600	So thank you
33096600	33097600	so, so much for hanging.
33097600	33098600	Tomorrow we're playing
33098600	33099600	Needy Streamer Overload.
33099600	33101600	I haven't played it.
33101600	33102600	So I'm not quite sure
33102600	33103600	what to expect,
33103600	33104600	but it is a shorter stream
33104600	33105600	for me.
33105600	33106600	So for those of you
33106600	33107600	who like the endurance side
33107600	33108600	of things,
33108600	33109600	I apologize,
33109600	33110600	but my stamina
33110600	33111600	is lacking tomorrow.
33112600	33113600	But nevertheless,
33113600	33114600	it's always fantastic.
33114600	33115600	Thank you so, so much.
33115600	33116600	My little beflings
33116600	33117600	or those who are watching,
33117600	33121600	and I will see you tomorrow
33121600	33123600	and say hi to Mercy.
33123600	33124600	I will talk,
33124600	33125600	I will talk in Mercy's chat
33125600	33126600	for a little bit,
33126600	33128600	but I do need to go
33128600	33129600	for the big P.
33129600	33130600	I'm not even going to pretend
33130600	33131600	otherwise,
33131600	33132600	I need to pay pass.
33132600	33134600	So I'll see you tomorrow.
33134600	33135600	Okay, bye-bye.
33141600	33142600	Bye-bye for now.
33142600	33143600	See you tomorrow.
33143600	33144600	Bye-bye.
33146600	33147600	Bye-bye.
