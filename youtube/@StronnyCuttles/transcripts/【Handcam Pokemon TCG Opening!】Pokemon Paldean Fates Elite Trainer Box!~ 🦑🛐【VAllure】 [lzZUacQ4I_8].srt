1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not prepared for this thing.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm slinging gmods with a girl.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm trying to keep a good body in me.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Like we did in each one.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My face in the screen?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, it looks like the surfaces.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There we have it.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There we have it.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And this is also my cat.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The cat that we're using.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And this one is my dog.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My cat.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's looking good.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's looking good.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It is looking good.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is looking good.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You didn't work in?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is what you think, Borschti.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm just kidding.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why am I a bruh?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's an only bot lane, you know.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi!

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you want to see where I still owns my fucking

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
unnamed seat collection?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ray here!

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I get to ruin all those samples that I took, so yeah, I spelt them all with my opnion samples, and I spelt them, so...

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, as a rule of thumb, the likelihood of me showing my face in the screen is very fucking high.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Am I gonna apologize? No.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I didn't really get much time to say oh, it's a clean Gmod with the girls.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, we have this.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi mom, I can't get more than I'm good.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your immersion is getting ruined, unfortunately.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As I said, the likelihood of a reflective surface showing my bald GI balls is pretty high, so if you don't want to acknowledge that I am a woman, then you are more than welcome to check out our screen.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is not the screen for you.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We are opening.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Paladin's face in my barber.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Can you hear me?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hoodie up.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, you wanna put Hoodie up?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's actually really smart.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hold on a minute.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Women on the screen?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Green blanket.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What does that mean?

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If I can even get into the spot.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, I have this as well, which we're gonna put away the ones we get in the correct order.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have a face mask.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't have one.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm having a show so the microphone picks me up because the microphone is now right here.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I just thought we'd do some gambler.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Go gambling.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Aw, dang it.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The real gambler was trying to open the box to see if he knew.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you think?

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is so reflective of that's the way to happen.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, to be honest.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
To be honest, I just look like a depressed fucking, you know, golf ad, really.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not that I am depressed.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just I'm depressed.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, I'm not depressed.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, that's what I'm trying to say.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm not depressed.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just, I look depressed on first.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, shame you.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, what's going on?

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now hold on a minute.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The leg.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, pulling.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe the real gambler was the one you were looking for.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I am just in this to relive what I want in my childhood.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I cannot miss the shame of things.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm actually in my time.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is this?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This thing?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, let's see then.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And this is the coin flip.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This one is the coin flip.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's the two.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Where's the refling card?

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will get it though.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, this is like something I can make.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, it's like I thought it was metal.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Classbook.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
TCG car truck simulators came out by the way.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hold on.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let me recalibrate.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to do it.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, do you know how to do it?

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You step on it.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I may as well go some higher.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, unfortunately.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, not unfortunately.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was playing Gmod.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Where's the girl?

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, I didn't have much time to set this up.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, I'm a bit...

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you tell I've never opened a Pokemon box before?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What am I trying to achieve?

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, we have...

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Holy shitele.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We have basic decks.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I assume this is not the gambler.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh my god, shame you.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, this isn't the gambler.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I assume these big pre-made stacks are decks, not gambler.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then it comes with its own pocket.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, if we get a really good card,

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it comes with its own pocket of notes.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then...

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, if we get good cards, we'll put them in there.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then we've got...

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is that? Open five?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Any Pokemon enthusiasts know what this is called?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The big stack is all energy cards?

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you serious?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why would they give you that?

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know why.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a deck to Vador.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Look at you, you little nerd.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Answered all our questions.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, I assume the gambler is these.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is what the gambler is.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, sorry. Let me spread it for you.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All name gambler.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is why we're here.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is the money shop, people.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The money shop.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The gambler.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right, what one do you want first?

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's spread it.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Excuse my seat collection.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What have we got?

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
God, I don't even recognise half of these Pokemon.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, God, I should have picked an old school pack.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There's Pikachu.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There's a pink thing.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's a blue thing.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's a whale.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What one do you want?

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Show me the card.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are they so big?

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why are they so big in your hands?

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a booster pack in your hand.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You want the pink one?

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You want the pink one?

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll give you the pink one.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think there might be a code inside.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if you play the online game, sure.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can grab the code.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's only the difference to me.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tinkerton.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Tinkerton.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Put your phone.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's just tiny hands.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you for this set.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Dainan.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
M&S.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, God.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hold on.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Did we think about the real challenge about this stream?

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Opening the pack?

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or literally opening them?

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't do that.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Am I going to need scissors?

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What the hell?

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are these factories?

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is this not for children?

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Um...

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just...

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bruh, hold on.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm getting confused.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm talking to the show now.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not...

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You were playing with me saying that.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So I'm going to get you ready to take over the stream.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, first quiz.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Obtain...

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the card opener.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Look, you remember when I said the nail glue one

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and I needed scissors?

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The nail glue got stuck to the scissors.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ladrian.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you for the extended membership two months.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Our having small hands is great.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Make other things bigger.

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right, we're going to make sure

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
we're not actually only cutting the top of the card.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So as you can see, I'm using my finger as a gaze.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Is that the result we wanted?

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Seeing those Pokemon packs

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and knowing the size of them,

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you really have tiny, adorable hands.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They look massive in your hands.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
More than you know.

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Whatever Brian is saying, I do not endorse.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right, first gamble.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, this is the code.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you're a gamer online,

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
note yourself out.

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you want to focus,

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
so the QR codes are rich and durable.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There you go.

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There you go again.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Right, I didn't even go.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Seeing those Pokemon packs

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and knowing the size of them,

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you really have tiny, adorable hands.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They look massive.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm actually just so big.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is this the one where it's like

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
put two from the back to the front

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and then, I don't know,

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
open the pack,

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
fill the code in one card to the front.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This one to the front.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you ready?

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh yeah, I got an energy.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm so excited.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You got elephants.

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, you need to focus webcam.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Please.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We're gambling.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're gambling.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you.

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What the fuck is that?

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not technical.

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright, I should have went old school with this.

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I should have went old school.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Leechonk.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Leechonk, onk, onk, onk.

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ooh, I like ganga.

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I like you.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I like that pun.

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You got technic on the tree.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Crisis punch.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's emotional speed.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You got...

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What does that do?

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dash bun?

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Dash bun?

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wait, is this the part?

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hold on.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait, can I do this thing?

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Can I do this thing that all the streamers do

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
when they get something like a really good pool?

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Is it a good pool?

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh my god.

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's one good card in this pack.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh!

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What does that mean?

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, oh, oh.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's shining, so we're going to...

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We are going to night him

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
with one of these,

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
of the Static Force on his leg.

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're going to have to put him in here.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You go.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What is you?

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I told the crew.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it's a tentacle, but not a tentacle.

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't be distracted.

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not a tentacle, but not a tentacle.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why should I throw it into the camera?

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because I don't know if it's a tentacle.

271
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We just slayed it in,

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and then we can get a perfect breed

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
when we sell this.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh yeah.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We just slayed it in.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You know you guys still have another couple of irons

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
to do when you're still on 2D?

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know.

279
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's such a good one.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's just a little tentacle.

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can...

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can freak it out if you get a special artwork card.

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm going to put him

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to the side again.

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And we got Haunter!

286
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ah!

287
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We got Holo!

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Ah!

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Look at that.

290
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mmm.

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Mmm.

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's go down blue.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do I put a Holo

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
in the shiny pocket as well?

295
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or is this a reverse?

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Haunter and Gengar in sameSceneHackDane.

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How appropriate that first two could be.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
For the tentacles.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is this pre-recorded?

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Exactly.

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That put in a wee aslonee punch.

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I bet it's Husky and Snacky.

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're winning?

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, good.

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm going to put all my wee shins

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in these specials.

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's like tons of these anyway.

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know.

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,400
So I'll put our pools so far that are good here and then the regular one, we're going

310
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,920
to numeric the deck and then we're going to put it away in the binder the correct way.

311
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Okay pick a card, any card, any pack of yours.

312
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,880
We did just do a tincture tin pack, so maybe we'll do Pikachu?

313
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:37,280
Pikachu has three, wait there's so many left, yeah this is, that was the first pack that

314
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:47,240
we opened, we've only opened one pack so far, right, right open, open, right as I said the

315
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,600
cards are at the bottom, my finger is a guide to where the cards start, so I literally can't

316
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,920
put into them, it's not possible, I've seen a few handcams like put into the pack and I'm

317
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,720
like why are you putting into it so willy nilly, believe, believe, open cumin, we don't say

318
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,480
open sesame around these parts, oh no, oh no, two cards stayed in, I don't know what the

319
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,440
order is, order, okay you ready for your card if you play the online game, oh yeah,

320
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,320
look at that, get that code in, get that holographic in the game, mmm yeah, that's great, you deserve

321
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,440
it, right, unfortunately I messed up the opening so I don't know if this truly is where it belongs,

322
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,520
so I'm going to put two in front, are you ready, boom, oh, well that worked out rather well,

323
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,520
that doesn't seem to me, it's the start of the day, I don't know, how was I doing that, like this, yeah

324
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,000
I saw something shady, I don't know what it is, but I see it, close, close,

325
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,480
this is probably the hardest move, shuffle them for a surprise, I opened them wrong, can you

326
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:18,280
please focus, oh I was going to get a model based after her, she has a lot of good

327
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:28,520
art or software, hello what so, oh I like that, is that a indie electric flying,

328
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:37,080
it's truly good, Ion is an annoying card, oh God guard of hours, pre-evolution,

329
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:50,440
when you've got the fairing whip, I spent 40 instead of, Varun, Varun, and then, and then I'm trembling,

330
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:59,320
oh, oh my God actually, I'm happy about that card, oh my God, I'm like so happy, it's guard of hour,

331
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:08,280
oh I'm actually happy about that, I'm not even kidding, I'm actually happy, look, oh she's pushing

332
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,080
and yes guard of hours is she, no I will not be taking any comments,

333
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:22,120
right, guard of hour getting here, Scottish guard of hour cosplay wins right now,

334
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:35,560
oh my gosh, so so far we have guard of hour, little kinds of in the booger, oh you can't really see

335
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,560
the shine on them in these, but they are shining from us, very slowly, so that's our hall so far,

336
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,520
there's an even more beautiful version of guard of hour in this pack, are these pre-selected cards,

337
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,840
am I celebrating over nothing, are these not Rambo, are these not Gambo,

338
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,200
and the four of them celebrating three, we've not done the wheel yet, or the purple one,

339
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,440
well I do eat, well chi chi a Scottish thing, right, this is a Scottish thing, don't judge me,

340
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:14,280
it bit dog shit, here if I need to see two, that's it, and then you pick this one,

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,920
that's when you do it, and the they are Gambo kids, okay, as you are my witness, the cards are

342
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,960
done there, she said dog shit, haven't heard that, takes a drag from a cigarette, haven't heard that

343
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,760
yet, normally eating any of them anymore, but we were a bit different around these cards,

344
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:50,440
right, let me grab all of the cards correctly this time, guard of hour, are you ready to study,

345
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,920
oh up there then, no please focus, you're working focus right away,

346
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,520
and then pick one from the back and put it to the front, and then watch,

347
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,440
why don't you put the energy on the back, that sniff is so low, because you have flashback,

348
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
yeah, we already got you,

349
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,720
oh I've missed that one, mass chip, is it a Matthew, is it a Mickey,

350
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,600
oh we got baby rolls, we have the rolls generation, oh man, hey I on Gary here, we already got you,

351
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,720
get out, we already got you too, how are we getting duplicates, we're in pack three,

352
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,720
and we're getting duplicates, come on, whatever you ate, nasty, right, I like nasty,

353
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,640
I mean you're different, I love it, what's his name, what's trio, are you squidding me right now,

354
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
I don't know, I'm pretty sure it's them,

355
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,800
let me put them away, gently put them in the pocket, and then I'll see what Brian's saying to me,

356
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,360
are you squidding me right now, are you squidding me right now, a little bit more every day,

357
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,360
thank you for his phrases, thank you, I love Scotland a little bit more every day,

358
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,640
thankful for its phrases and you, oh wait what, oh my god I'm going crazy, oh well that's what we

359
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:40,760
wanted anyway, and then we got this guy, eggs with people, and he's a huge basic, is it, how

360
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:47,240
is the ranking, it's like shiny reverse hollow, what's the ranking, you're gonna have to tell me,

361
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,200
again I'm sorry but I'm doing this for male attention, I'm getting no, I'm getting no enjoyment,

362
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,840
no valence, no nothing sir, I've got two shiny hollows right, hold on let me check,

363
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,720
because I can't hear and I've got my headset on, thank you lord of scorns for the tip and thank you,

364
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:19,800
order Ling Mummy, why did, why did you order this ordered box, I would like to order them,

365
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,040
yeah, yeah, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're getting spanky, these are our whole,

366
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,200
we've got decent ones so far,

367
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,760
it's okay mummy, we'll give you all the attention, oh my god attention,

368
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,880
okay we've not opened up a wheel, so we'll do any mini mini mini more, catch the title,

369
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,720
if this wheel lets it go, mini mini mini more, wheel pain, wheel pain,

370
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,960
and then, well again fingers the gaze, so no cards are gonna get cut, no cards were cut,

371
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,640
no cards were cut in the making of this, strong,

372
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:13,080
see, not many awards, almost, almost, let's go wheeling, oh dang it, oh dang,

373
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm a wheel of the beach variety, oh hell yeah,

374
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,520
that's also going on before we open the cards again,

375
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,760
okay, ready, steady, go,

376
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:48,520
one card to the front,

377
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,520
do you think you'll play the online game, I might give it a shot, I don't see why not,

378
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,280
can I do gen 3 only, oh my god a war card, I'm so excited,

379
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,160
oh no more, I know no more, I know no more, I love you, no more in camel rucks,

380
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,520
oh no you didn't see that, who's fucking doing that, terrible,

381
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,040
terrible, I don't know who the streamer thinks they are,

382
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,440
oh you're in my game too, you're in pokemon ruby, so I know you,

383
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,240
gen gar, nice to see you again buddy, but how are we getting duplicates in the

384
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,440
a nest ball, well that's a good sign, oh hold on,

385
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,440
I thought that was something under the nest ball,

386
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,360
uh swuba, I've played this den as well, I think that's pokemon black,

387
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,840
okay I'm happy with a little bit of gold, I'm gonna put you to the safe

388
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,800
and then we've got rate, Iona, how about you, Iona up to and give it a break, stop

389
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,600
showing up, that's the third pack now, and then a researcher,

390
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,000
not fast, not fast, not fast, but we'll still put them away in packets,

391
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:46,520
really special packets, is it a shiny, I mean is it called a reversal thing because it's a

392
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,200
mummy, wait, hold on I'm not actually seeing this again,

393
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,280
oh wow, that's actually quite a unique one if your death is completely terrible,

394
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,800
uh so when are we doing streams tonight pokemon, um right now I think,

395
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,880
okay only five more gambas to go, what would you like,

396
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,720
the streamers may be questioning if I'm sober or not, what does that mean,

397
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,280
which gen is she from, I think seven maybe,

398
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,000
your wish, my command, what's up big abby, I'm ash from pallet town

399
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,760
and you're gonna be my new buddy, we're gonna be together forever,

400
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,400
what, no, Pikachu, I'm not ditching you for guard of hour, I just need some personal time,

401
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:11,800
you know, to train her of course, we're in gen nine, relax, relax, we need to rough up,

402
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:26,120
that's the code, what is, holy shit that's ash's voice, no, wait yes actually I'm the real ash

403
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:36,680
from ash pallet town, the hit video game series pallet town, energy, see I'm never unhappy seeing

404
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:45,800
muster boys, I love muster boys, oh mr moe, nice to meet you, mom what are you doing with mr moe,

405
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,560
you're making some weird noises last night, noobat is so cute and then his evolution it turns ugly,

406
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:07,480
he's wrappedy, he's in put one black, he's found in the desert with one black,

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,400
a electrical generator, what was mr. mom doing, I don't know, threw back the tea,

408
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Then we have a backpack. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for the backpack. Get- get those legs out of here. You belong in the war. I don't care what they've done to your evolution line, get back in the war.

409
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,400
I didn't know Mr. Mime could wrestle with your mom. That's so cool.

410
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Oh my god. Right, I take it back. Neubat's evolution is kind of fucking cool. Hold on a minute. Is that- is that Shani? Is that Shani Hollow?

411
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Is that Neubat? That's not Neubat's original look. See, Neubat's purple. Oh my gosh.

412
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Oh, is that normal? Is it not called Neubat?

413
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,400
It's called Neubat. Yeah, first one's called Neubat. Yeah, I'll show you Neubat.

414
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. I pulled the fucking Shani. What? You mean there's a higher chance rate that every packet has something Shani in it?

415
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:30,400
No, don't tell me such things. I want to see Neubat turn it- it involves into Neubat.

416
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,400
What is the po-ka-dex of toy school and the- and the thingy? Hearing Ash cursing is so funny.

417
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:46,400
What the fuck are you talking about? What are you doing? Pikachu, for fuck's sake. Just kill the leader.

418
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Why are you using Quick Attack? That's a normal type move. It's a fucking ghost type you're against. What are you playing at?

419
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Basically, have I imagined how Ash would be? Si, I wish women were real. Takes a drag from a cigarette. I wish women were real.

420
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm fake. I'm- remember, I'm doing this for Neal, okay? Ask her if I just snipped a card. I'm gonna cry. Did I? Did I just do that?

421
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Hold on a minute, Ash. You're on the back burner, son. I'm raging. Did I just snipped a card?

422
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Better not have. No, I've no- it's fine. I've no-

423
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Ash, are you ready? Online players. There's that code and QR thing that you can do now. Yeah, you like that.

424
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Did you go to pokemon.com slash bdm? Then you're not a real gamer. I like how the official lore is now. I've just done it now. There's no going back.

425
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:04,400
She is doing this because she got paid by the casino. I'm actually addicted to gambling. It's a real problem, but I hide it behind this board.

426
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Oh, the results again. Magmar, playing the board. It's nice to have you.

427
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Oh, are you the pre-evolution to that pastry looking dust? I can't- I know there's a generation that is in France. Is this French?

428
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Is that French? Oh, not French. Are you French? Don't quit before you hit that jackpot. You already know it, baby.

429
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Lantern. He's an evolution of the night. Clive. Congrats if your name's Clive.

430
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Women's got- I'm reading this upside down, by the way. No, Jen's like this.

431
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Where has it been?

432
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,400
What is it called?

433
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Oh, maybe it's what it's called.

434
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Cereluity.

435
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,400
I don't know what you are. You're a poison type?

436
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,400
The webcam ain't very good. You want it? Did we say it's good? Is it 16?

437
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I didn't see that. I promise I didn't see that. Life's sucker. Oh, wow. It's like a fighting type.

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm going to send the package.

439
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Cereluity.

440
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
And then-

441
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Are we happy?

442
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I don't know. Are we happy?

443
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll wait for your reaction. Special art? Good?

444
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Good? Oh, hey! Hey! Must be streamer luck.

445
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Streamer luck, streamer luck.

446
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Streamer luck, streamer luck.

447
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, no! I made a cup of tea!

448
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
No!

449
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,400
No! It's fucking cold!

450
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Whatcha say? I have no more milk, so I can't make another one.

451
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Whatcha say?

452
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
No!

453
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm going to try it.

454
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
No! Up for gore.

455
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, we're going to very gently put her away. So she's the Ash, 2.0.

456
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,400
So she just got a lighter voice than Ash. So if Ash is down here-

457
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,400
I need to try and raise it up here. Is this how she sounds?

458
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I don't know. I haven't seen that anime, but you said she's kind of like a tomboy.

459
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,400
So, is that- She's a yandere? What's going on? What's going on?

460
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
What's going on?

461
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Microwave the tea. Do not speak again for the next 10 seconds and think about the actions of your words.

462
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Another one says microwave the tea! Are you mental?

463
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Mmm, no. I thought I was kinky, but microwave and tea? Mmm, too far.

464
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Okay, it's a game of three.

465
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,400
We've got three gambas. What's wrong with the microwave?

466
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,400
You didn't microwave tea, though. You can use the microwave as much as you want, but you want a cup of tea.

467
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm not having that.

468
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Your hit rate is- His box is really good. I've never seen that many hits before.

469
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Streamer luck.

470
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Another dodonzo.

471
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
This is dodonzo.

472
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Okay, we have two more packs, and then we're going to alphabetize.

473
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
You have a tea addiction, a gamba addiction, a zeal.

474
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,400
They opened up that game that I played PCG Card Shop Simulator.

475
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,400
They've released it early, and I'm like, mmm, I want to play it now, but I must wait for stream.

476
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm going to start fresh and then play through the game.

477
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm going to hire you to work in my little card shop.

478
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Oh!

479
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Is this the card you're looking for?

480
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Oh, it's not the card.

481
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Oh, yeah? Check your force, then.

482
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Exactly.

483
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
A warm-in oven.

484
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm going to pour it in.

485
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Tutu?

486
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Lechonk, right here.

487
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Sharked it.

488
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Sharked it.

489
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
What are you, a picnic?

490
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, wait, it looks like it's got a coconut mask on.

491
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Oh, you're new.

492
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Ker-let-oh-bet-oh-piss, clobber-piss.

493
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Glob-clobber-piss? Any clobber-piss fans?

494
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Dom-fam, we know Dom-fam because that's an ashes team.

495
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Hey, that's my Dom-fam.

496
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Ne-mo-nans-backpack.

497
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Well, I don't know why she's lost it, but get it out of here

498
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
because we've already got this card.

499
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Get it out of here.

500
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Okay.

501
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Oh, it's the evolution of the guy.

502
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Hello.

503
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
You look like you're on the same team.

504
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,400
They're the same player, right?

505
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
It's a ground-type octagon?

506
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Huh?

507
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
A ground-type octopus?

508
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Uh...

509
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
No, they're feyin'.

510
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Oh, feyin'? Okay, okay, okay.

511
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
That makes much more sense.

512
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Sorry, this is brand, so my brain's like...

513
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
brand.

514
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
If it's brand, then it's brand.

515
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Ooh, what are you?

516
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Beth?

517
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Beth, what?

518
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Please, camera, I'm begging.

519
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Little?

520
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Why can't you see the upper skirt?

521
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Ah!

522
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Oh, sorry, it's the next card.

523
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Hold on, hold on, hold, hold, don't get too exu-

524
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It's the next card, okay?

525
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
It's the next card.

526
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Ah!

527
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Ah!

528
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Oh, my God, it's Meg Mortar!

529
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Ah!

530
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
It's the super-evolution!

531
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Ah!

532
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Oh, yeah, baby.

533
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs.

534
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
We got it.

535
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Come on.

536
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Yeah, look at that.

537
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Volcanic Heat.

538
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Volcanic Heat is 170 attack, hold on.

539
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,400
During your next turn, this Pokemon can't attack.

540
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Oh, it's a build-up.

541
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
It's like Sunbeam.

542
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
It's a build-up attack.

543
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Meg Mortar is an ugly basketball, isn't it?

544
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Why did they make his lips like that?

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
His lips were not that big in the pre-evolution.

546
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I know that for the fact.

547
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I've seen what you look like when you're wee.

548
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
I've seen you when you're wee.

549
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,400
You're gonna be like growing up with any like that ugly.

550
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
So what's going on?

551
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Pokemon and making cute little Pokemon's fucking ugly.

552
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Challenge impossible-evolution.

553
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Sorry, that wasn't even a sentence.

554
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Bye-bye, thank you for hanging in.

555
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Please don't worry, you can't hang.

556
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
This is a short stream today.

557
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
It's not- it's not mega-

558
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
uh, massive and finished in just a minute.

559
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Let's be honest.

560
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Is this a serious Pokemon opening?

561
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
No, I've never done it before.

562
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
I just always wanted to do it with my childhood wish.

563
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Okay, it's between purple or yellow.

564
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Pikachu and then.

565
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I mean, it's not that much damage these days.

566
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
I have a card that goes to Jesus.

567
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
You want purple?

568
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Short stream, next four hours.

569
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Let's go!

570
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Oh, and it's slow though.

571
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,400
No, I dealt with the script writers.

572
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,400
So, I had to, like, get my management to send on.

573
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
There's two people I picked.

574
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
And I'm, like, right.

575
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
So there's been a message.

576
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
As far as I'm aware, there's been emails,

577
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
but only two people emailed,

578
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
and there was, like, seventy-eight people wanting to write scripts.

579
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
So, mm-hmm.

580
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Right, was there purple?

581
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Was there purple one?

582
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
So, I was up dealing with that,

583
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
so I've not had much to do, so I'll go apologize.

584
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
And then we were playing G-Mod.

585
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Emperor Zurus couldn't fucking connect!

586
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I was raging!

587
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Um, I don't know why she couldn't connect to Sheevee.

588
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Sheevee was hosting four, and I was, like,

589
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
oh, is it because you were hosting it, Stormy?

590
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
No.

591
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
No.

592
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
And we were, like, trying so hard,

593
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
but it just, it really could not get in.

594
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Oh, no, I've done it.

595
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Fuck, sorry.

596
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I pulled it out wrong.

597
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Oh, how?

598
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I have one job.

599
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I don't, I don't know what card it is.

600
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
I think it might be this one.

601
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
We're gonna do this.

602
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,400
If we get spoiled early, that's completely on me.

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Yeah, we played offline.

604
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
It wasn't a stream, no.

605
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
And if we do end up streaming G-Mod,

606
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
unfortunately I can't stream it on my end

607
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
because the lag is too severe.

608
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
And I was, like, a magic trick.

609
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Mm-hmm.

610
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Mm-hmm.

611
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
No, I did not expect that much of a response on the list, right?

612
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Um...

613
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I don't know.

614
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
My friend was, like,

615
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
oh, you've got that many spoken words, right?

616
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Oh!

617
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
We can...

618
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Right, no one saw that, no one saw that.

619
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
No one saw that, right, no one saw that.

620
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Ooh, right, she's focused.

621
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Faincon?

622
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Is that your name?

623
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
A faincon?

624
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
No one saw that, no, don't laugh.

625
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Don't laugh.

626
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Are you gonna focus me?

627
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
There you go.

628
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Faincon.

629
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Energy.

630
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Good.

631
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Fancy.

632
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Good.

633
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Lapras.

634
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Good.

635
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Moonlit hell, all right.

636
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Can't unwrap the finished numeral's evolution one

637
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
unless you've got mega-evolutioned and

638
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
you saw nothing.

639
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Pinnacle is gen 2.

640
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
What?

641
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I haven't recognized him at all.

642
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Good luck on the first thing to you,

643
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Primi.

644
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Love you, darling, love you, Primi.

645
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Ecstasy?

646
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Okay, we've got ecstasy flying through.

647
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Pikachu.

648
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Pikachu.

649
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Oh!

650
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Oh my god!

651
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Oh!

652
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Oh my god, I'm so surprised we got this card!

653
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Oh no!

654
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
What?

655
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
This didn't get spoiled a minute ago because

656
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I messed up the order?

657
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
What?

658
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
No, what are you talking about?

659
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Oh my god, celebrate!

660
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Yay!

661
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Wow, I never...

662
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
No, I never expect that either.

663
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Only I could have messed that up without them.

664
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Okay, we got one of them.

665
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Each one.

666
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Wait, did we get another one of them?

667
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Hold on, I need to go through the special tile.

668
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
These cards are special.

669
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Also, I've got a bone to pick for some of you reeflings.

670
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
What's going on?

671
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Mummy needs to have a talk.

672
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
What's going on?

673
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I've been getting a few marshmallows saying

674
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
you feel really bad when you interact with me

675
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
and you overthink and you think you're upset

676
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
and you're annoying me.

677
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
What's going on?

678
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Why are you overthinking interacting with me?

679
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
What is going on?

680
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Why are you scared to interrupt?

681
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Everyone's like, I've had a couple of marshmallows

682
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
that are apologizing for interacting with me

683
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
because they feel bad about it.

684
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

685
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
The person that did the 9-11 joke.

686
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,400
They're like, I'm so sorry I didn't meet up today.

687
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
And I was like, no, I was getting a rise out of the joke

688
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,400
because I said it so fast that I didn't think it.

689
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
It was funny.

690
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
And then I got another one that was like,

691
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
I feel like you appreciate me.

692
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
And I'm like, I'm sorry, this one.

693
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
I thought I was doing good.

694
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I thought I was doing alright.

695
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
You know, I've been in every day, having fun,

696
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,400
looking through all the good things that come.

697
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,400
We don't want to embarrass ourselves.

698
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
It's a view of the reasons I have got it.

699
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Some got it.

700
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Open and put them on card packs.

701
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Some got it.

702
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Right, this is the last pack, so make it count.

703
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Brains until brain worms got hands.

704
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Yeah, and normally I thought I was defeating the brain worms

705
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
before they could spawn in.

706
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
That card is 9 gigabytes.

707
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Oh, you grabbed it?

708
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
It's because you're super shy and you like it a lot.

709
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh, this one.

710
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
You must brain break us not to think.

711
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Oh, well, if you put it that way.

712
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Oh, yeah.

713
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Oh, yes.

714
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
You need your energy.

715
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Shark a bit.

716
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Right, for a fucking yambo?

717
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,400
How many cards are in this bag?

718
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
This is like...

719
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Bruh, I've seen you.

720
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Get over here.

721
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Are you new here?

722
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
So many duplicates.

723
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I know.

724
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I know you're saying that I'm getting lucky with the pills,

725
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
but the duplicates...

726
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Bruh, that's like the third or fourth time.

727
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
You don't have people who are like, I get addicted

728
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
and I just want to keep yamboing more.

729
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
I get so fucking annoyed that I spend money on this.

730
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm like, mmm, you there or not?

731
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
You there?

732
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Fucking shit that way.

733
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
How many backpacks does this bitch have?

734
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
I don't want to keep fucking buying more.

735
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Chronic lurker hurt.

736
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Here, can confirm I'm shy.

737
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh, don't feel forced to talk if you don't want to talk.

738
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
So that's different.

739
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
You just want to lurk that time.

740
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Artazone.

741
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Ooh, Skipplin.

742
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I don't know you, but it's nice to have you.

743
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Is that mine?

744
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Wait a minute.

745
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Oh, you can have two and a thing.

746
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Skipplin looks good.

747
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
What?

748
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
That was it.

749
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh, he's shiny as well.

750
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm fucking gambling again.

751
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
What the fuck was that?

752
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
That's fucking piss.

753
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Right, I'm going to put the specials away

754
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
and then we're going to alphabetize.

755
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
We're going to number them.

756
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
It's shiny and a gender.

757
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Skipplin is gender?

758
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
What?

759
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Am I going to meant?

760
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Right, I've not played the Gen 1 or 2 game.

761
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I started at Ruby.

763
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I started at Ruby and then I did 4 and 5

764
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
and then I couldn't do 6.

765
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
So I'm only similar.

766
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
You're wrestling.

767
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
That's me with the polka dots.

768
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Horn good, yeah.

769
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Horn region is my region.

770
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
The only reason, this sounds really bad,

771
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,400
but the only reason I remember horn region is my region

772
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
is because I'm horn me.

773
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Like, I'm playing the horn me region.

774
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
That's what I remember.

775
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
These were our pools.

776
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Let me just kind of zoom into it this way

777
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
because this is like...

778
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
This is harder than it looks.

779
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Not that I'm saying any special applause for doing this, okay?

780
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,400
But this is not how I expected

781
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
to go.

782
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
I expected to...

783
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,400
I expected to hardly even know her.

784
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
My eyes, I'm sorry.

785
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
The noyvern is pretty cute.

786
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I have to admit, noyvern is such a nice word to say,

787
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
like noyvern.

788
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Like, it's a satisfying word to say noyvern.

789
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Ah, noyvern.

790
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Noyvern, noyvern.

791
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
I started at Gen 1.

792
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
So I got a special...

793
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Wugtrio and Neymona.

794
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
A special art.

795
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Rainworms go.

796
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Mommy's love is here to stay.

797
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Aw, thank you.

798
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Hapsicum.gar for the extended membership.

799
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Thank you.

800
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
I got a little...

801
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
We got guard of hour.

802
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm really happy with guard of hour.

803
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I think if I have to be biased,

804
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
noyvern and guard of hour

805
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
are my favorite tools.

806
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Not... I'm not telling Sivirino.

807
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Um, my fellow mercs.

808
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I really like...

809
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Noyvern has a lot of HP.

810
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
He's stacked out with HP.

811
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
260 as well.

812
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
It's just OP as well.

813
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
140, 140, 120 health.

814
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Only 90 at that time.

815
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
No.

816
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Are you squiddin' me right now?

817
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
You're so weak, you little baby.

818
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Headbutt 30.

819
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Undersea tunnel.

820
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Flip three coins for each head.

821
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Guard of top three cards of your point is dead.

822
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Come here.

823
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Black blood.

824
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Thank you for the extended membership.

825
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Sunnybell.

826
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
You can do more.

827
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Two eggs is a full art shiny egg.

828
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
A full art trainer.

829
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Two shinies in an art rare.

830
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
Pretty tall box.

831
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
There's so many Pokemon.

832
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Play the TCG win.

833
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Oh, I feel like I'm gonna make a fill on myself though.

834
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I feel like I'm gonna make such a...

835
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
a guberino of myself.

836
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Cause I don't know what we're gonna do.

837
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I'll maybe need to research some videos.

838
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,400
I found a video game that I wanted to play for an ASMR.

839
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Like pre-recorded ASMR.

840
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Some people do that stuff when you do ASMR videos.

841
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
There's 1,025 Pokemon.

842
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Okay, I recognize about 300.

843
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Take your leave at...

844
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Royce.

845
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
This is the bit where I don't really know how to progress.

846
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
And the reason for that...

847
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Pre-recorded?

848
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,400
No, I pre-recorded ASMR stuff.

849
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,400
This is where I don't know how to progress, for the most part.

850
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,400
I want to numerically number them.

851
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,400
But I need to like place down...

852
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
like 1 to 10.

853
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
I don't even know how big this deck is.

854
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Wait.

855
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
This deck is 91, not including the hidden.

856
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Can you see that?

857
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Oh, please do this.

858
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,400
It says this is card 39 out of 91,

859
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
not including the hidden.

860
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,400
So, I don't know if I should put them in the tiles for now.

861
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
Like that's the third tile.

862
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,400
This is 90, of course.

863
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
So what?

864
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
Like 1...

865
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
So let me back up a little bit.

866
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,400
So like 1, 2, 3, and then 9's down here.

867
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,400
This is 5, so that was over there.

868
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
50.

869
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,400
This is 71.

870
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
So like here in the 7, that's 6.

871
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Do you know what I mean?

872
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Is this the best way to do it?

873
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,400
And then I'll put it in the book at that way.

874
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Back it up, yeah.

875
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,400
See, this is 4, so this would be at the start of the deck.

876
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:02,400
16, so that would be 0, 10, 4, 8, 8.

877
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
So yeah, there you go.

878
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,400
0, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

879
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,400
And then specials will go right where my head is.

880
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Let me make myself smaller.

881
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Oh, let me make myself smaller.

882
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Aw.

883
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,400
You're massive.

884
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
You like my socks?

885
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Is this the comfy?

886
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Yeah, I got them at the asylum.

887
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Man, they released me.

888
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
I don't know why.

889
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
They just had another name.

890
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Fuck this.

891
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
50?

892
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Oh my god, look at them.

893
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Concert and things like that.

894
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
The Griffey Gryffindor.

895
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Well, you never had heads on a V2 Gryffindor before?

896
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
What's going on here?

897
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
That's 14.

898
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
51.

899
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,400
This is the best way I can see it in my head to do it.

900
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Like the most efficient way when I'm putting them away.

901
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
That says 8.

902
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,400
6, 7, 8, 9 specials increases when that's through the balls.

903
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
I hear cracking.

904
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
What?

905
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Wait, cracking in my mind?

906
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
Would you be the first?

907
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,400
I'd like to be the first, but you're here.

908
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
I do like cherries.

909
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Do you like cherries?

910
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,400
6, 7.

911
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
1, 2.

912
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
What's the first 2?

913
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,400
It's the routine you're doing to me.

914
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Oh, Panko is the first card in the 6.

915
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
They always start with grass-papes.

916
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
You can do grass-papes that much.

917
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Fancy for you.

918
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,400
3, 4.

919
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
The rest, thank you for coming.

920
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Remember, please enjoy the emotes.

921
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
I'm getting new emotes soon, I promise.

922
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
I'm waiting for an update with the emotes.

923
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
They're not really doing much.

924
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,400
And I've been waiting so well.

925
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,400
It's not above 50%.

926
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Yeah, the specials seem to be at the end of the deck.

927
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,400
No, they would be kind of the 4.

928
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,400
2, 3, and 4.

929
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
What's my cherry? Can you help me find it?

930
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,400
No, no, no. I've picked the cherry.

931
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
You'll never get it back.

932
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Hmm.

933
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I've got to work now. Good luck and have fun.

934
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Thank you.

935
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
As I said, it's a very short stream today.

936
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Please do not be getting straddled in.

937
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
I assure you the only straddling is me.

938
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Straddling for a paddling.

939
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,400
I do think I'll have Ace more tomorrow.

940
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
There'll be a new Ace more video.

941
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,400
My Patreon is also going to get an update.

942
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,400
I can either do a police officer,

943
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
do something to your P-Sport,

944
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,400
or I can do a different role play.

945
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Take care, leave it.

946
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
The cherry, mine, thank you.

947
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
No, that is...

948
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
Chinnicle.

949
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
I love Chinnicle.

950
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
Right now, I'm mercy a little bit for some reason.

951
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,400
I don't know why I'm just like that adorable nature.

952
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Flip a coin.

953
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Is what I mentioned was useful.

954
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
It's only the cherry trigger.

955
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Honestly!

956
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
I'm not going to be extra haunted,

957
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,400
which I'm not mad about. I don't mind haunted.

958
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
Iona, you can pop off.

959
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,400
We've had enough of you for quite some time.

960
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
I have to admit, was there...

961
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,400
Iona, we see you quite a lot,

962
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,400
and we're not really that fast to see you that much.

963
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
It was nice.

964
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Well, it lasted.

965
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I mean, it was through 8-6-6.

966
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Then we were given them two.

967
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Sonya, I'm begging you.

968
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
You only got a few more hours if you're the 2D weekend.

969
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
It's only a few more hours.

970
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
I should...

971
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,400
I either have a hands-cam video where I'm tapping on the girls.

972
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
It's just a rambling ASMR.

973
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,400
You guys seem to enjoy my rambling ASMR,

974
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
and because I don't have to write a script,

975
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
it doesn't need to be performed a certain way.

976
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
I don't mind making it.

977
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Like, I'm playing a happy music now.

978
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Seriously.

979
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,400
So it's like a rambling tapping on each...

980
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
It's like with my nails, with my fake nails.

981
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
I've got five days.

982
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
I'm happy my music.

983
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
The projector!

984
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Two days left in this season.

985
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Your rambling is really soothing.

986
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
Yes!

987
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
I'm glad because...

988
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
Not in a lazy way.

989
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
It means I have less work to do.

990
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,400
A lot of pressure is taken off where it's like...

991
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
You don't need to write a script because you know me.

992
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,400
I'm already behind.

993
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
How much energy cards do they give you?

994
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,400
Look at these.

995
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Energy, energy.

996
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,400
And then they already gave me...

997
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Here is this entire pack full.

998
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Remember it.

999
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,400
That's how much I hate it.

1000
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
I've already lost it.

1001
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
I've already lost it.

1002
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
That's how much I hate it.

1003
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
What?

1004
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
I'm getting fluff on me.

1005
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Don't look.

1006
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
There's fluff on me.

1007
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,400
They really stuff me so it's tiny.

1008
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
I wonder...

1009
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh, that's the seven?

1010
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
That would still be it, right?

1011
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah.

1012
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Get my tails of it.

1013
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
What's the one here?

1014
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
What's the one?

1015
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
That's a team.

1016
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,400
That's 51...

1017
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
49.

1018
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,400
That's 69 brain loss.

1019
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
And then her backpacks which are...

1020
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Plenty.

1021
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Nope.

1022
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Yeah, we do not need any more backpacks.

1023
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
I assure you we are...

1024
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Hitting down for backpacks, really.

1025
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
No.

1026
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
No seriously.

1027
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
We do not need any more.

1028
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Is that it?

1029
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
And then we've already sorted through all the cards?

1030
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Oh well.

1031
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
We are efficient.

1032
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,400
You can call us reeflings many things.

1033
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,400
We are efficient when we know what we're locking in.

1034
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Mummy, have my first.

1035
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Oh, we got your super cherry.

1036
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Your super cherry.

1037
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Thank you, big ol' boy.

1038
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,400
For the super cherry.

1039
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
It's May now.

1040
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,400
You can't get it back.

1041
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
I'm fine now.

1042
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Mummy, yappin' is like the news for old people can't live without it.

1043
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
I think it is.

1044
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Thanks for having that Susan rambling in the backpacks.

1045
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Hey mama, just got here.

1046
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
You can hear that.

1047
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,400
I'm ecstatic to record ASMR about having just quiet myself down.

1048
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
I submitted a sample script.

1049
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?

1050
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
When you whisper...

1051
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Like it's quite damaging to your voice.

1052
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Which I'm used to now.

1053
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
I'm used to my voice.

1054
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,400
When I do ash from pallet town, this genuinely hurts my voice.

1055
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:15,400
But I understand that it's going to be okay and it will heal up.

1056
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:23,400
But whispering pain of death not only takes the men to meet as well.

1057
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
So there's a lot of 20s.

1058
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
What's going on?

1059
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
It's all 20s.

1060
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Again 21.

1061
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
78.

1062
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
This was a very...

1063
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,400
So we got rare cards.

1064
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,400
But I will admit the repeats are killer in this deck.

1065
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,400
That's it.

1066
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,400
That's us already ready to adjust into the good.

1067
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Brian got ignored.

1068
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
Oh sorry.

1069
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
Hold on.

1070
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Hold on.

1071
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
I can't.

1072
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,400
I don't have my headset on.

1073
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
I'm reading.

1074
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Look, you can even get a little football.

1075
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah, you like that football.

1076
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
I'm a ballerina.

1077
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Shilin.

1078
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Hey mom, I just got here.

1079
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
How's the script for everything going?

1080
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
I'm a lot curious.

1081
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm a bit disheartened for the script.

1082
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,400
But we'll ever see any feedback if I was chosen or not.

1083
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,400
When will I know?

1084
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
So two people have been emailed.

1085
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:15,400
We're waiting on them to send their response script.

1086
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
And then we'll take it from there.

1087
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Thank you Shilin for the morning.

1088
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Can I say that?

1089
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Yeah, I do.

1090
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
No, they've been emailed.

1091
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,400
So only two people were emailed and there was like 76 applicants or something like that.

1092
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
So please don't be like, oh my God.

1093
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
Shilin.

1094
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,400
Like, oh, I got debated.

1095
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
I thought it was an unopened part.

1096
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Oh my God, I got excited there.

1097
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Yeah, third time.

1098
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Sorry Brian.

1099
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Brian got yaps out.

1100
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
I'm sorry.

1101
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm sorry.

1102
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Do you want me to repeat it?

1103
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
I can repeat it.

1104
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Hi mom, how are you?

1105
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
I'll repeat it.

1106
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
But yeah, look at that leg.

1107
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Look at that.

1108
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
You see me tensing it up?

1109
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Right there.

1110
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Brian, your turn.

1111
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1112
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Hey mama, just got here.

1113
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
How is the script writer thing going?

1114
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
I'm a little curious but shy.

1115
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
I submitted a sample script.

1116
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?

1117
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
When will I know?

1118
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Brian finished?

1119
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Good boy, Brian.

1120
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Thank you for saying that again.

1121
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,400
Oh yes, they've already been emailed.

1122
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm waiting on the responses from it.

1123
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm going to get a bit closer to you if that's okay.

1124
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
Please don't freak out, okay?

1125
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,400
I know I'm a real woman but it's okay.

1126
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
I'm also like you.

1127
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,400
So don't overthink your interactions together.

1128
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,400
I'm born like you, okay?

1129
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
I'm born like you.

1130
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Thank you, mommy, for blessing my eyes and ears.

1131
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
How many submissions?

1132
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
It was like 76 or something like that.

1133
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
It was a lot.

1134
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Okay, so this is the only way I can see it being done.

1135
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
So I've picked out.

1136
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,400
These are all the cards that are one to ten, okay?

1137
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,400
So we literally go like...

1138
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,400
This is the first page.

1139
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Did I even have number one?

1140
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Number two.

1141
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
So literally number one, right?

1142
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
Fuck.

1143
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
This is harder than I thought.

1144
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
And these cards are in the way.

1145
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
I can't believe it.

1146
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
I never thought...

1147
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Wait, no, no, no.

1148
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,400
Hello?

1149
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Are you there?

1150
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,400
Okay, there we go.

1151
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,400
It's double-sided.

1152
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400
I thought that.

1153
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Then it goes one.

1154
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
And then we'll just take it from there.

1155
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,400
This is the banger at the end of how full or empty it is.

1156
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Hmm.

1157
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
That was funny.

1158
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,400
I love your content.

1159
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
I'm glad you can catch me live.

1160
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
I'm so sorry.

1161
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
This is like the worst stream to catch me live.

1162
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,400
I'm just rambling.

1163
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,400
I can't fit it in me.

1164
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Oh my God.

1165
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
What?

1166
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
That's so cool.

1167
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400
There's like a secret thing here.

1168
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Oh my God.

1169
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,400
Hold on a minute.

1170
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,400
I'm starting to understand why Pokemon cards collect.

1171
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
A bit addictive.

1172
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Hold on a minute.

1173
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Oh no, that's satisfying.

1174
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Oh.

1175
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Oh, that's satisfying.

1176
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm sorry.

1177
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Hold on a minute.

1178
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Hold on.

1179
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Hold the phone.

1180
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
What do I do with duplicates?

1181
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Well, I'll put them in a separate pile.

1182
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
I'll put duplicates in a separate pile,

1183
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,400
and I'll send it to Ariflin for the doughnuts on.

1184
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
How about that?

1185
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
You can have all my duplicates.

1186
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Nine.

1187
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,400
So it's like one, two, three, four,

1188
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,400
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1189
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,400
Like, that's how we do it, right?

1190
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Oh my God.

1191
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,400
The dopamine all along was putting it in the binders.

1192
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
It wasn't pulling the card.

1193
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
It was, oh my God.

1194
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Tell me.

1195
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Oh, sorry.

1196
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
That is so fucking satisfying.

1197
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,400
I'm getting dopamine hits, like fucking turning the damn thing.

1198
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Now, as I said, there's a very high chance

1199
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
of you seeing my face this stream.

1200
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
Look.

1201
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
It is what it is.

1202
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Put it back in.

1203
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
It's still good.

1204
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
No problem.

1205
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
You just eat what you want to.

1206
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Right.

1207
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
So then we're on the teens.

1208
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
We've got 14 to 18.

1209
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
We've got 11.

1210
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
That's a good one.

1211
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Right.

1212
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
We've got 11.

1213
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,400
So nine, 10, 11.

1214
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,400
Huh?

1215
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
Oh my God.

1216
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
That's so satisfying.

1217
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
What the fuck?

1218
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,400
I'm making a game right now that is just putting stuff in the binder.

1219
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
And I put you in the two mills.

1220
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,400
I am trying so hard to get you a good shot.

1221
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Oh, hold on.

1222
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,400
If I can, like, put you in the two mills.

1223
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,400
And then we get Nemo, which is evolutionist camera.

1224
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Because he can't erupt.

1225
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
So there's lava on the back.

1226
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
Oh, my God.

1227
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
The binding of us at once.

1228
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Well, Pikachu is a wispy.

1229
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
So put it in the wispy pile.

1230
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Sorry.

1231
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
This is so hard.

1232
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
Right.

1233
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,400
You know what?

1234
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,400
You know what?

1235
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Right.

1236
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Everyone calm down.

1237
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,400
Let's move the fucking cars back in two by two.

1238
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,400
I need a better camera angle, people.

1239
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Come on.

1240
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Think of the shot.

1241
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Think of the money shot.

1242
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Will you?

1243
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,400
Jeez.

1244
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Any.

1245
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Keogreful.

1246
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Keogreful?

1247
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,400
Keogreful?

1248
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
Keogreful.

1249
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
Okay, there.

1250
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
Is that looking right up at my face?

1251
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
I think it is a little bit.

1252
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
That's it.

1253
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,400
It is what it is.

1254
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Is that me?

1255
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,400
In this one?

1256
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,400
Is that me?

1257
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,400
No.

1258
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
What do you think?

1259
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,400
I have no idea.

1260
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Right.

1261
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Okay.

1262
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,400
I think I'm going to have to, like, swivele around.

1263
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Oh, no.

1264
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
That's going to make it even worse.

1265
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,400
The odds have increased of my face being shown.

1266
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Fuck.

1267
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Fuck.

1268
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Fuck.

1269
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Oh, well.

1270
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah, well, wrap it up.

1271
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,400
Right.

1272
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,400
Okay.

1273
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,400
Numeral is 12.

1274
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,400
So, you got...

1275
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Oh, this is really hard to do.

1276
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
I'm so sorry.

1277
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,400
This is very unoptimized.

1278
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
If numeral is 12, we have 14.

1279
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
So, I guess we'll do 13.

1280
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
12.

1281
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,400
13.

1282
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,400
14.

1283
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Wait.

1284
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
Yes.

1285
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
No.

1286
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,400
Wait.

1287
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,400
Hold on.

1288
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,400
Hold on.

1289
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,400
Hold on.

1290
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,400
Hold on.

1291
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,400
Hold on.

1292
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
Hold on.

1293
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Hold on.

1294
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Hold on.

1295
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Hold on.

1296
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Hold on.

1297
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,400
Hold on.

1298
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Hold on.

1299
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,400
This is what I'm seeing.

1300
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
This is what I'm struggling with.

1301
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,400
I can't do numbers.

1302
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,400
Well...

1303
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,700
Yeah, and then next page, it would be 13.

1304
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,700
Here.

1305
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,700
And then 14 here.

1306
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,700
Okay.

1307
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Sorry.

1308
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,700
It's very slippery.

1309
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,700
It's rather slippery.

1310
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,700
I can't squeeze it.

1311
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,700
How can I do it?

1312
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,940
I mean, I want to be thebanger in the LA.

1313
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,940
Wait.

1314
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,940
Can I put you in between lines?

1315
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,940
Is that easy?

1316
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,620
I don't know if that's easier or more difficult.

1317
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,620
Oh.

1318
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,620
Well, if I squeeze it, it's actually a lot easier to do and go all the way through.

1319
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:02,940
squeeze it it's actually a lot it's gonna hold okay so that is 14 and then

1320
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:12,620
that's a repeat that's fine and then we've got 14 we don't have 15 but we have

1321
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:29,620
16 17 14 15 16 and then we literally you get in the

1322
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:35,820
second crushing fruit a bit early this is so hard

1323
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:58,260
find out shortly that was 17 and these are duplicates and there's a 17 18 to

1324
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:03,900
Pikachu so we're already on electric tape like what yeah like look how many

1325
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:21,420
fucking gaps we have oh that's rough that is rough for a banger

1326
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:31,540
need more gambas to sell the beans or I think that's how they're trying to get

1327
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:42,340
you right this says so that's 18 right Pikachu is 18 and then we've got 21 18

1328
01:04:42,340 --> 01:05:01,340
19 20 21 have 22 whoa wait a minute my dumb not to have like a funny thing on

1329
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,420
him like that hypnotist stuff well it has nothing on the car it's not to a

1330
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:34,580
secret thingy put 52, 23, 24, 25,

1331
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:42,580
Yeah, like all the sides. Yeah! Oh my god, what do you think? What do you guys think?

1332
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:52,580
Okay, five, six, six, six, seven. That's fine. Oh, this is point two. Point one.

1333
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:59,580
You get this. It's not shiny. It just looks slightly different.

1334
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:06,580
Even with my naked eyes, it's in point 22, 22.

1335
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:11,580
I'll show a big up close at the end as well, so please don't worry.

1336
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:19,580
You're a Reefy in the city town. And in this 1819, 20, gorgeous stunning.

1337
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,580
We're getting a bit more filled out. I love it.

1338
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:27,580
Oh my gosh, this is speaking to me.

1339
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,580
Right, that's pointy one. So we've got a Reefy. Oh! Yeah, look!

1340
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,580
That one's different from that one, but this one's better.

1341
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:42,580
So it's got the actual beef over it. That's going in the duplicate pile, and this one's from here.

1342
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:48,580
So you think you could ever professionally compete one day with a dick?

1343
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:53,580
I mean, I could compete whether or not I'd fucking win in the different questions,

1344
01:06:53,580 --> 01:07:00,580
but that's no harm in having a room tie dealer. Thank you for the three months extended membership.

1345
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:06,580
No, there's absolutely no way. I could professionally fucking have a dick. Are you joking me?

1346
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:12,580
I pick dicks. I pick my Pokemon based on do they look kawaii desune or not.

1347
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:17,580
I'm not even going to hide the fact that I do. That's how I pick my dicks.

1348
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:23,580
Are they cute? And you come. That's how I do it, okay?

1349
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:27,580
Yeah, and she definitely is complete.

1350
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:32,580
That's right. I picked them at their kawaii name. Right. What are you?

1351
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:37,580
But I really cannot see that fucking number. Don't be afraid to make it bigger next time.

1352
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:42,580
Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty.

1353
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,580
Do I have thirty?

1354
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,580
I have thirty-one. Wait, let's get you in there.

1355
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,580
Thirty-one. Gorgeous, stunning.

1356
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:58,580
Oh, do you have thirty? Lovely. We love to see it. We love to...

1357
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,580
We love to get in there. Thank you.

1358
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:08,580
That was thirty. Thirty-one, thirty-two. We got thirty... thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.

1359
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:13,580
Wait. Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.

1360
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:18,580
Sorry, I don't... I'm not very... You know, you know how it is, right?

1361
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:23,580
You know, spondin'. I kind of spawned in as a girl.

1362
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:31,580
I might not have the best kind of attribute, but as long as I try my best, right?

1363
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:37,580
That's what counts, even if I am dumber than a bunch of rocks.

1364
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,580
I'm just here for a good thing.

1365
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,580
Thirty-three, and then that's thirty-five, which is correct.

1366
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:55,580
And then I've got thirty-eight, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight.

1367
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,580
You've got a little pinch, just like you pinch the ball for.

1368
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,580
And just do that with a little pinch, so there's nothing else that guys do.

1369
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:07,580
And I was absolutely sponded when I saw a meme about it.

1370
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:14,580
Alright, that was thirty-nine, so we're hitting them with a forty right off the bat.

1371
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,580
No pun intended, you know.

1372
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:22,580
And then forty-one, ooh, got a little clean slate going here.

1373
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,580
Wait, what?

1374
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:31,580
Apparently guys have to pinch and roll their sack in order to itch it, and I saw it in a meme.

1375
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,580
And I was dumbfounded.

1376
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,580
I forgive me.

1377
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,580
I was not familiar with your game, gentlemen.

1378
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,580
I was not familiar with your game.

1379
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:48,580
Right, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six.

1380
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,580
Big gap.

1381
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,580
Big gap.

1382
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,580
I understand the gamble and the drive.

1383
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:58,580
Oh, that's a good, good gap, and doesn't have to text on it that long.

1384
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,580
Accurate.

1385
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,580
Would you let me do it with my nails?

1386
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,580
Come on, let me, let me pinch and roll for you.

1387
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,580
Come on, let me do it with these nails.

1388
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,580
Yes?

1389
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,580
No, you scared of the nails?

1390
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,580
Scared they're gonna hurt?

1391
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,580
Someone sent me a marshmallow, they were like,

1392
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,580
I'm starting, I don't mean to be asked such a personal question.

1393
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:28,580
But I had to do it with those nails, and I'm like, well, see, I have the same post.

1394
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,580
This is the peril, okay?

1395
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,580
And this is the nails.

1396
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,580
They have, they have not, the nails don't cut the peril.

1397
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,580
It's not necessary.

1398
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,580
Just, just so you shouldn't have, you know.

1399
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,580
Oh, whoa.

1400
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,580
Wait, no, I've not finished that deck yet.

1401
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,580
We've got two duplicates, so that's okay.

1402
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:03,580
And we've got Fampy and Dumfam, so that's 46, 47, 48, me, and 49.

1403
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,580
And we're on the 50s.

1404
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,580
And we're like, why is it so sad that I'm still not a vendor?

1405
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,580
Like, I'm so happy right now.

1406
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,580
Educational marshmallow?

1407
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,580
Honestly, I don't mind educating.

1408
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,580
I'd rather you ask me than never know at all, and like,

1409
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,580
or be embarrassed to even try and learn.

1410
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,580
Like, it's nice that you're even, like, curious enough to ask.

1411
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,580
And it's like, well, listen to how it works.

1412
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,580
Don't worry about it.

1413
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,580
If you didn't know, because how are you supposed to know?

1414
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,580
How are you supposed to know?

1415
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,580
No, seriously, how are you supposed to know?

1416
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,580
If you don't know better, how are you supposed to know?

1417
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,580
That's a duplicate.

1418
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:46,580
Haunter, these, actually, there's no difference between these.

1419
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:52,580
So, I've got 57 and 56, and we've just done 52.

1420
01:11:52,580 --> 01:12:03,580
So, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

1421
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:08,580
I'm afraid we didn't get ghastly, so we did not complete the game for everything,

1422
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,580
which is a little unfortunate that we didn't really lose.

1423
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,580
Thank you for watching over.

1424
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,580
Some of us have much to learn.

1425
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,580
Oh, is that a cherry, I say?

1426
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,580
Are we up to date on marshmallows?

1427
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,580
No, I've not looked at marshmallows.

1428
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,580
You're gonna shit yourself, why?

1429
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,580
I'm sure you're not.

1430
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:31,580
57, 58, 59, 60.

1431
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Okay.

1432
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:39,580
And then, as long as there's no scraggie, that's sort of, you know,

1433
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,580
that's 60, sorry.

1434
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,580
Sorry for some of my face there, no, I don't care that much.

1435
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,580
Unfortunately, I do have a face.

1436
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,580
60, 61, 62.

1437
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,580
Hold on.

1438
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:04,580
And then your duplicate, and then it was 61.

1439
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,580
You're 62.

1440
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,580
You're 61.

1441
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,580
And you go, don't fight it, you're getting put away by me.

1442
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,580
Okay, this one's the better version.

1443
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,580
This is 64.

1444
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,580
62, 63, 64.

1445
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,580
It's very satisfying when you mean the bottom ones again.

1446
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,580
Not seeing anything like this on, I guess.

1447
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,580
Day one of the marshmallows.

1448
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,580
It's trying to put, oof, steady on.

1449
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,580
I think I've killed them enough for one, two.

1450
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:38,580
40, 68.

1451
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,580
What are you?

1452
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:46,580
64, 65, 66, 57, 68.

1453
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,580
Gorgeous.

1454
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,580
Stunning.

1455
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,580
68.

1456
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,580
I must remember.

1457
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:51,580
This is 69.

1458
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,580
80.

1459
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,580
60, 70.

1460
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,580
71.

1461
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,580
And we're just going to double check that math pencil,

1462
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,580
because I'm not ready to do that.

1463
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:11,580
60, 69, 70, 71.

1464
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,580
And that's a duplicate.

1465
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,580
Please stop playing.

1466
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,580
Oh, please stop playing.

1467
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,580
This is why you were getting thigh locked earlier.

1468
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,580
That was 71.

1469
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,580
So we've got 76, 79.

1470
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,580
Okay, hold on, let's do the math.

1471
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,580
Are you ready?

1472
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,580
Are you ready?

1473
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:38,580
71, 72, 73, 74, 75.

1474
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,580
And then it goes 76 here.

1475
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:44,580
God, that gap is very difficult.

1476
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,580
And then it goes 77.

1477
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,580
Oh, Jesus, we are getting there.

1478
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,580
We are getting there.

1479
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:56,580
Who said pick this one?

1480
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:02,580
And then 78, 79, like that.

1481
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,580
And then if we have...

1482
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,580
Oh, I've mixed this.

1483
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,580
I've mixed this last pattern.

1484
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,580
Oh, well, we're not as...

1485
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,580
Should have been me, not the binder.

1486
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,580
Thank you for having us.

1487
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,580
Please don't worry, today's a much shorter stream.

1488
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,580
Literally, once I put this away, we're going to take a look,

1489
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,580
and then I was so much in my loop.

1490
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:29,580
And I believe she'd be streaming.

1491
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,580
And you can read her out there into her for once,

1492
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,580
because I always end up missing her.

1493
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,580
I feel really bad.

1494
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:41,580
80, 81, 82, 83.

1495
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,580
Crying at that backpack.

1496
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,580
There's no unique...

1497
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,580
On that.

1498
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,580
I'm just checking.

1499
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,580
Oh, there's a unique one, this Iowa.

1500
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,580
And the backpack, right, outcome.

1501
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,580
No, I'm not having an outcome.

1502
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,580
See that?

1503
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:00,580
The backpack at least has the unique little markings on it.

1504
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,580
Iona, for you too.

1505
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,580
Who said get nails?

1506
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,580
Fuck sake, I can't get nails.

1507
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,580
Out and...

1508
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,580
I think I put more clothes on my dad.

1509
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,580
There's nothing else in here.

1510
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,580
I think there was loads of knockoffs, like,

1511
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,580
fastened day.

1512
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:26,580
79, 80, 81.

1513
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,580
So...

1514
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,580
A little bit more filled out than originally.

1515
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,580
I don't want to do that.

1516
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,580
That's what she said.

1517
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:38,580
Who are you?

1518
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,580
83.

1519
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,580
What?

1520
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,580
Oh, that's a duplicate, Iona.

1521
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,580
84.

1522
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,580
I was like, that's not possible.

1523
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,580
How can there be two of the same?

1524
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,580
84, 85, 86.

1525
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:02,580
Okay, and then the last card.

1526
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,580
90.

1527
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:04,580
What was that?

1528
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,580
86.

1529
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,580
87, 88, 89, 90.

1530
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,580
I'm not off my board.

1531
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,580
That's how empty your fucking desk is.

1532
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:21,580
I'm not sure how it feels about that.

1533
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,580
Is this how we get you in?

1534
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,580
Is this how they suck you in?

1535
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,580
It's not very filled out at all.

1536
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,580
Dear.

1537
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,580
We've got greens, a lot of grass pipes.

1538
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,580
And then, yeah, gaps all over.

1539
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,580
Oh dear, this is how they suck you in.

1540
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,580
I've not put these guys in.

1541
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,580
That put them in the binders?

1542
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,580
Are they going to fit?

1543
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,580
Like, that put these guys in the binder?

1544
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,580
How do you do it?

1545
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Buy more colourful cardboards.

1546
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,580
I don't know.

1547
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,580
Look out of Rudigan's number.

1548
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,580
What?

1549
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,580
Oh my god, can you see that?

1550
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,580
224, hidden out of a 91 deck.

1551
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,580
Are you serious?

1552
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,580
This is 224 in a hidden deck?

1553
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,580
What?

1554
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,580
This deck is 239 cards.

1555
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,580
And I've got this many fucking duplicates.

1556
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,580
Excuse me, there's 239 cards.

1557
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:39,580
Excuse me, there's 229 cards in the deck.

1558
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:42,580
And I get how many duplicates?

1559
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,580
All duplicates, by the way.

1560
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,580
All duplicates.

1561
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,580
No way.

1562
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,580
That's insane.

1563
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,580
See, being told that doesn't make me want to go gambling.

1564
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,580
That makes me want to quit, because like...

1565
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:09,580
If that was my booster packs, and these are all duplicates,

1566
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,580
how you need me, you know?

1567
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,580
Literally, that's how they need to buy more?

1568
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,580
No!

1569
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,580
I'm sorry, but they've lost me.

1570
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,580
They've completely lost me after that.

1571
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,580
Are you serious?

1572
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:38,580
Like, that's more than probably what was put in the fucking poker deck,

1573
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,580
not to be my poker deck.

1574
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,580
Like, your poker deck is bigger than mine.

1575
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,580
I don't know what to say.

1576
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,580
I'm feeling emasculated right now.

1577
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,580
Clearly bigger than mine.

1578
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,580
Oh, there we go.

1579
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,580
I found the energies, as if that wasn't enough.

1580
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,580
Here's a bunch of energies that no one asked for.

1581
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,580
Just print the...

1582
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:57,580
Fucking just print the cards.

1583
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,580
Put them in the bag, bro.

1584
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,580
Put the fries in the bag.

1585
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,580
Just put the cards that I want.

1586
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,580
Oh my gosh.

1587
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,580
Very hard.

1588
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,580
And so that's why some Pokemon cards go for like a hundred bucks,

1589
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
because it's such a very cool tool.

1590
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,580
Thanks for the compliment.

1591
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,580
Oh my god, it's called a V-Tuber.

1592
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,580
Sadly, I am real.

1593
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,580
I'm breaking all the V-Tuber rules.

1594
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,580
Before you get excited and click subscribe,

1595
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,580
I do break a lot of V-Tuber rules, okay?

1596
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,580
I'm not supposed to acknowledge that.

1597
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,580
I'm piloting a mess.

1598
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,580
Yeah, look at that.

1599
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,580
Empty.

1600
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,580
Empty.

1601
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,580
I don't like that.

1602
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,580
That's wrong.

1603
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,580
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1604
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,580
I had fun putting these cards away.

1605
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,580
I was getting a bony.

1606
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
Like, I was getting erect.

1607
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,580
Putting that away, but...

1608
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,580
We got...

1609
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,580
I can't even...

1610
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,580
Yeah, look at that one.

1611
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,580
Holy shit.

1612
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,580
One.

1613
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,580
Out of eight on that page.

1614
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,580
One.

1615
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,580
Oh no, two.

1616
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,580
Sorry.

1617
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,580
Two out of eight.

1618
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,580
V-Tuber rules.

1619
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,580
There's rules.

1620
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,580
I mean, there's unwritten V-Tuber rules.

1621
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,580
Like, one of them is like,

1622
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,580
don't acknowledge your pilot and a metha.

1623
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:12,580
I used to get told off for that so much.

1624
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,580
Don't acknowledge your...

1625
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,580
using your emotes or whatever you're looking for.

1626
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,580
Then...

1627
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,580
I'll send you a chat.

1628
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,580
Hello.

1629
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,580
This is our polka debt.

1630
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:27,580
I'm not really beating anyone with this, to be honest.

1631
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:31,580
Can these fit inside the...

1632
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,580
If these can fit, maybe...

1633
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,580
can these fit whilst still in the packet?

1634
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,580
You might look a bit better if I can do those.

1635
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,580
I don't know if they can fit with staying in the packet.

1636
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:43,580
Oh, please.

1637
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:44,580
It's invisible.

1638
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,580
Okay, it's invisible.

1639
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,580
Oh, it can.

1640
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,580
Okay, okay, okay.

1641
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,580
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1642
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:50,580
Don't write me out yet.

1643
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:51,580
Don't write me out yet.

1644
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:54,580
Don't write me off just yet.

1645
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:58,580
I've got 24 here.

1646
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,580
10.

1647
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,580
11.

1648
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:01,580
12.

1649
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,580
13.

1650
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:03,580
14.

1651
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,580
15.

1652
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,580
16.

1653
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,580
Wait.

1654
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,580
18.

1655
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,580
Executor?

1656
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,580
Oh, there.

1657
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,580
Executor?

1658
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,580
Hardly.

1659
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,580
I'm not sure.

1660
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,580
I almost showed my face on screen.

1661
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,580
Right.

1662
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,580
Okay, okay, okay.

1663
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,580
Hold on.

1664
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,580
Let me put my specials in.

1665
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,580
I didn't realise they could fit.

1666
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,580
You know, it's a tight squeeze.

1667
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:20,580
How was that specific?

1668
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:26,580
Oh, it's struggling on the bottom one.

1669
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,580
Is that in?

1670
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,580
No, I'm just going to get schizophrenic now.

1671
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:30,580
Oh, it's not in.

1672
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,580
Hello, I'm thinking of do it again.

1673
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,580
I'm so sorry.

1674
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:40,580
Ooo, slide them in gently.

1675
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,580
It is tight.

1676
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,580
I'm not even kidding.

1677
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,580
That is tight.

1678
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,580
I'm gently...

1679
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,580
I don't want to bend the card.

1680
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,580
I'm really tight.

1681
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,580
I'm really tight.

1682
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,700
I don't want to bend the card or anything. I am gently.

1683
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,460
Well, I've done it now, haven't I?

1684
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,340
Okay.

1685
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:01,940
Ooh.

1686
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,060
Ooh.

1687
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,980
That was tight.

1688
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,420
147 special.

1689
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,620
229 is Nemona.

1690
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,300
Tentacruel, 213.

1691
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,460
224.

1692
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:20,980
69.

1693
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,020
Nice. You have 69.

1694
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,500
Just look for Neubat.

1695
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:27,900
Where are you, Neubat?

1696
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:28,860
69.

1697
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,820
You look cute, Stanky Bean.

1698
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:34,900
69. There you are. So this one will go up to y'all.

1699
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,220
I'll give you a big...

1700
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,900
Sound right, I've got 16.

1701
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,980
Of course I would. Mummy, you're losing it.

1702
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,140
It's just Corpheon.

1703
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,060
Fucking...

1704
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,740
Look how empty it is. I'm feeling a muscular lookie.

1705
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,380
I'm trying to be like, all cute and stuff.

1706
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,980
I love it. They're pretty rough.

1707
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,340
Is anyone who have a Phil Pokemon collection here?

1708
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,940
It's an expensive hobby, I feel.

1709
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,020
This is 97.

1710
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:20,620
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97.

1711
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,660
You're cool. I'm putting in orders if I'm going to finish this deck.

1712
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,220
Stanky Bean, 23, I do not have that kind of money.

1713
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,580
Nor would I want to spend it.

1714
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,620
Like, I'd rather have like...

1715
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,140
I wish...

1716
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,660
There must be Pokemon Gambo, but with less filler, right?

1717
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,220
Surely there's someone who's like, well, cut to the chase.

1718
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,300
Yeah, it's a bit rare, but it's not that rare, you know?

1719
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,460
Like, I want to cut to the chase.

1720
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,580
A bit different, you know?

1721
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,620
Why, something on your name, Jason?

1722
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,820
Is that what the bill says?

1723
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:54,460
That's strange.

1724
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,740
What would stop you from doing what you want to do?

1725
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:08,620
90, 90, 89, 88.

1726
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,100
Stop it.

1727
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:11,900
Look gently.

1728
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,820
Tease teaser.

1729
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,300
Mm-hmm.

1730
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,260
This way, I might let you guys do it.

1731
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,180
Right, gently.

1732
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:24,860
Come on.

1733
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,660
No, I haven't forgotten that I need to take bulls.

1734
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,140
Before anyone's like, have you forgotten?

1735
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,180
No, I have not forgotten.

1736
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,180
40.

1737
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,860
Okay, back here.

1738
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,140
40, that's 50.

1739
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,900
Is this 40 on the shoulder?

1740
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:40,780
It is.

1741
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,580
Oh, I have a spacey and a duplicate.

1742
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:49,980
Right, I'll take out this one, and I'll give it to Ari Fling.

1743
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,820
Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.

1744
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,500
Chicken fried chicken, Ari Fling, huh.

1745
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,260
Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.

1746
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,300
Shawnee needs to take her team, I don't think.

1747
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,580
I'm going to extend my way, can you get up?

1748
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,740
Sorry, this blanket has too much fluff that comes off of it.

1749
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,220
And then the blanket.

1750
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,180
This is 70.

1751
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,180
Still bizarre.

1752
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,300
I've not had my book door.

1753
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,180
I was there.

1754
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,180
I even bought the webcam a bit too far.

1755
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,900
Oh, I forgot my fucking mattress here.

1756
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,220
Oops.

1757
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,140
Ta-da.

1758
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,660
That's how I say hi to you.

1759
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,140
Hello.

1760
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:27,900
Hello.

1761
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:28,860
Hi, hi, hi.

1762
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,620
Shawnee, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1763
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,180
Hi, Shawnee.

1764
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,660
So, I had to pick it up, or else it couldn't see my face.

1765
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,700
But now you can see my face.

1766
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,300
I didn't realize I forgot.

1767
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,540
Okay, 69, 70.

1768
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,020
Hmm.

1769
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,380
Is that a leg?

1770
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:46,940
I know.

1771
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,220
I'm not in a wheelchair, popular to...

1772
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,020
Contrary to popular AI artwork.

1773
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,700
Oh, right.

1774
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,660
And then are these numbers like the outrageous ones?

1775
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,100
No, this is 87.

1776
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,140
That's not outrageous.

1777
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,580
88, 87.

1778
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,220
And then now it's the ridiculous numbers?

1779
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:26,220
147, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 3.

1780
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,620
Do I even have that many slots?

1781
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:29,900
Right.

1782
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,380
You're gonna have to walk through the math, okay?

1783
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,340
We're my boy up.

1784
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,420
97.

1785
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:35,900
Right.

1786
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,460
Everyone.

1787
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,460
Shhh.

1788
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,860
I need shushes from across.

1789
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,980
And this is gonna be terrible.

1790
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,860
97, 98, 99, 100.

1791
01:27:47,740 --> 01:28:03,580
101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116.

1792
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:32,940
117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,

1793
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:36,780
The following is a fact from UK-classified government documents.

1794
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,700
Their accent isn't natural.

1795
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:43,260
It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.

1796
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:47,500
If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.

1797
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,100
Spread the word before they.

1798
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,300
514, 6147, yay!

1799
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,420
You missed one?

1800
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,300
Did I actually?

1801
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,340
Wait, did I miss?

1802
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,700
Did I miss?

1803
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,660
No, they're fucking with you?

1804
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:07,980
Okay.

1805
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,220
And that brain surgeon alloy you fucking with?

1806
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:16,060
Stop fucking with me.

1807
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:16,300
Right.

1808
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,180
What did Brian say?

1809
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:17,740
Hold on a minute.

1810
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,740
Oh, excuse me for sawing my phone.

1811
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,300
Brian's Edward Snowden.

1812
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,820
The following is a fact from the UK-classified government documents.

1813
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,180
The accent isn't natural.

1814
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:34,220
It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.

1815
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:38,140
If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.

1816
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,220
Spread the word before they.

1817
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:40,620
Huh!

1818
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,740
Yeah, that's right, British Edward Snowden.

1819
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,780
Get done for.

1820
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:49,500
You're either Northern Irish, you're Irish Scottish,

1821
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,300
you're either Welsh, or you're either English.

1822
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,660
England, school's not that good else.

1823
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:56,620
Okay.

1824
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:00,540
Thank you very much for the tip as well.

1825
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,100
How could you forget?

1826
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,180
Okay, 147.

1827
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,500
Right, but it's not over yet.

1828
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,540
Okay, we have two.

1829
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,420
We have two 13 first.

1830
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:11,740
Okay.

1831
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,060
Are you ready?

1832
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,180
I hope you like counting.

1833
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,660
And it's not going down.

1834
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:18,780
Sure you.

1835
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:26,460
Right, 147, 148, 149, 150.

1836
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:35,500
150, 152, 153, 154, 156, 178, 9, 6.

1837
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:36,940
Hold on.

1838
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:48,700
6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 8.

1839
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:54,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9.

1840
01:30:54,700 --> 01:31:23,580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 210, 210, 210, 211, 212, 213.

1841
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,220
Yeah.

1842
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,420
Can 13 even be in this position?

1843
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,980
I don't know if what we're doing.

1844
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,540
I think I had, I did it.

1845
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,820
I think that's correct.

1846
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,980
Two 13.

1847
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,020
And then thank the fucking maker.

1848
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:46,780
These are for 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1849
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:57,180
21, 22, 23, 24, right.

1850
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,620
And then last but certainly fucking least because I've had enough of you.

1851
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:12,940
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and then 29.

1852
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,900
And we're done with put the deck away, no duplicates.

1853
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,740
Oh, that was so fucking hard.

1854
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:27,580
I wish, Tina, why is it so hard putting away Pokemon cards?

1855
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:31,820
Can't we just count the pages and multiply by four?

1856
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,380
There, my deck is done.

1857
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,740
Now we can look at my deck.

1858
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,420
You want to come over in my house and look at my deck?

1859
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,580
Oh, no, like my actual Pokemon deck.

1860
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,380
I just borrowed it.

1861
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,420
So I'll put it behind you.

1862
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:52,700
Right, are you ready?

1863
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,820
I'm going to present to you.

1864
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,780
There are many polka decks in the world, but this one's mine.

1865
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:04,780
There you go.

1866
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,540
Well, it's empty.

1867
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,900
Yeah, I'm buying mine.

1868
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:25,660
I'll show you if I was saying deck as fucking set, straight, we don't be pussyfooting around

1869
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:30,460
these bushes trying to invite you to our house to show you her deck, but you heard it wrong.

1870
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:35,100
Oh, no, you accepted coming over to see foot on me.

1871
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,220
And then it never happened.

1872
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:41,260
You're like, so when you pulling it out and I was like, oh, I don't know.

1873
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,460
You're in a Pokemon like that.

1874
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,700
I thought you're more of a Yu-Gi-Oh fan to be honest.

1875
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:46,060
I'm sorry.

1876
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,340
Well, I'm familiar with your game.

1877
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,380
Oh, I love my wee haunted.

1878
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:53,660
I wish I could have got my wee ghastly as well to finish their line.

1879
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:54,220
But you know what?

1880
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,540
We got Ralts's line, so I'll kind of do that now.

1881
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,940
She's pulling her cock out.

1882
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,620
Wait, she's pulling her cock out.

1883
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:16,460
And then we get to the special part and for no particular, look how far away the next card is.

1884
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,500
It's so covered.

1885
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:23,980
It's so covered, it's so far away, literally all over here for the next one.

1886
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,460
And then for the next one, the other two are only visible because they are in special little pockets.

1887
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,940
Who fucking made these?

1888
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,460
That is ridiculous, honestly.

1889
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,580
That's ridiculous.

1890
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,940
It's donkulous.

1891
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:46,380
They are special, and then two more.

1892
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:46,700
One.

1893
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,940
And then last, but certainly not least.

1894
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,420
Apparently she's a rare pearl, so maybe I shouldn't be so mad.

1895
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,940
And the ultimate key is ridiculous.

1896
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,420
Right, where's her?

1897
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:07,100
I want to see my Ralts's line though, because I always play Ralts in the Pokemon movie.

1898
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,860
I always have a guard there, I always hold her super safe, so there it is.

1899
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:12,060
There it is, I'm coming.

1900
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,500
Look at that.

1901
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,020
My Ralts's line is complete.

1902
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:21,340
Imagine raising a Pokemon to be used for breathing stuff.

1903
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,260
Very nice.

1904
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,580
Very, very nice.

1905
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:30,140
I get it.

1906
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,140
He's the martial in my deck.

1907
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,700
Did somebody mention Vaporeon?

1908
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:42,380
No, mommy wants to be Guard of Air, bro, Guard of Air is such a sex symbol.

1909
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,100
I don't care what anyone says, I'm such a sex symbol.

1910
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,780
My large face.

1911
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,140
Where my pack's good.

1912
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:57,100
I kind of got rip-fozled a little bit.

1913
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,820
So these were my duplicates.

1914
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,900
Like, that's pretty fucking stacked.

1915
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:08,060
For duplicates, that is, that's rough.

1916
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,220
A discount guard of our design for Gen 2?

1917
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,260
No, we don't, sadly.

1918
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:23,020
Yeah, that's duplicate, that's rough.

1919
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,700
Like, you can see how thick that is.

1920
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:31,820
Like, I don't know if you have a Pokemon card for scale, just to see how thick this stuff is.

1921
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,220
How about Gen 3 Guard of Air?

1922
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,260
Do you want us to guess it?

1923
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,100
Dick torture, yeah.

1924
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,220
Is it torture when I play this game?

1925
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,060
Yeah, sick chunky boy.

1926
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,980
End point, best, isn't it?

1927
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,580
Just don't call it Guard of Air, bro.

1928
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,300
I should do my Pokemon deck through this one.

1929
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,540
Yeah.

1930
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,300
So that's my agendination, I think.

1931
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:13,260
The other stuff, just in case someone didn't clean all the coins, I'll show them again.

1932
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,540
And then I'll read Marshmallow.

1933
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:32,380
Okay, so put one, put two, three, ignore the, ignore the discarding system, okay?

1934
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,820
Just in case someone didn't grab them.

1935
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:42,540
Ignore the discard system, don't, don't, what are you, what are you focusing on?

1936
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,540
Oh, what are you doing?

1937
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:51,980
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, identify yourself.

1938
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,660
You're making a mess, oh no.

1939
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,220
Should I not be making a mess right now?

1940
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:07,260
So if you play the online game, you're more than welcome to clean all of those coins.

1941
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,940
That is not a problem for you.

1942
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,660
No problem at all.

1943
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,140
Is there anything else?

1944
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:19,420
A little player's guide, if you want to take a look at it, boom.

1945
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:21,580
Oh, look at that.

1946
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,260
I don't like when they do art like that.

1947
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:29,500
I hate the fucking, how do you call it 3D?

1948
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,220
I don't like that.

1949
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:35,980
Pokemon are supposed to be, what?

1950
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,660
It actually teaches you how to play.

1951
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,980
I mean, it is a guide, right?

1952
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,100
Colorful combos.

1953
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,620
Cyborg for a mulling.

1954
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:50,540
Espertha X is the angry, and it's Cyborg your opponent's Pokemon in the face.

1955
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:51,020
What?

1956
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,580
Build metal strategists, make it rain energy card when you Pokemon with

1957
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:11,500
gold den or gold den goes, new lavish hospitality attack.

1958
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:16,140
Pokemon like Metal X from Scarlet and Violet are amazing.

1959
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,940
Obsidian Flames often have attacks that benefit.

1960
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,140
Are these our specialty cards?

1961
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,140
I've never had any.

1962
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,300
Moonlight Hill has eyes.

1963
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:31,420
Psychic decks get a new play through with Moonlight Hill, and there's no one better

1964
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:37,900
to take advantage of the stadium cards than Garderbummer X, who debuted, oh my god,

1965
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,860
Beach of Arreol?

1966
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:42,140
Gen 3 Villar leaks?

1967
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,060
Please tell me, you can read that says debuted, right?

1968
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:54,380
Debuted in the Scarlet and Violet expansion, and now reappears in Scarlet and Violet halogen states.

1969
01:39:54,380 --> 01:40:00,460
Moonlight Hill, Moonlight Hill can help put basic psychic energy cards in your

1970
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:05,020
discard file and heal damage incurred by psychic integrity.

1971
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,740
Actually just confirmed?

1972
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,980
We got both of those cards, I do.

1973
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,100
Oh, just to rub it in your face?

1974
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,980
Oh my god, just to rub it in your face?

1975
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:19,660
They show you what you could have had.

1976
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:23,820
I never even got Mimic, oh no, I did get Mimic C before, anyway.

1977
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:28,460
I did get Mimic C, sorry, let me pop Mimic C in there.

1978
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,940
Hold on, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.

1979
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:34,060
Mimic C was a special card, because look, we came in and we packed it.

1980
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:37,340
Sorry, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.

1981
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:40,940
You know, you know the whole point of the box and the design?

1982
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,700
Yeah, sorry, I forgot about that.

1983
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,580
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, I forgot about him.

1984
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,820
And this is not holding him.

1985
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,940
Deck appeared in the first place.

1986
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,620
Doesn't wear glasses, has zero dents, perception.

1987
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:00,620
I will go through what we could have had, okay?

1988
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,620
I think it somehow had the perfect deck.

1989
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:10,540
Oh, I love Mimic C, the safe card.

1990
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:16,220
Prevent all damage done with Pokemon by the attacks from your opponents.

1991
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,740
Who the fuck is Pokemon V?

1992
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,300
I've never heard of Pokemon V.

1993
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:25,900
Who's Mimic C?

1994
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,180
Oh, he's right behind me.

1995
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,660
It's perfectly behind me.

1996
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:31,500
Right, 70, are you 70?

1997
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,300
You're 75, right, go back to the book.

1998
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,100
75, hold on, hold on, something's there.

1999
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:39,340
What are you?

2000
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:43,340
68, 69, okay.

2001
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:49,100
70, two, three, four, five.

2002
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:53,100
Here we go, little Mimic C's having a go.

2003
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:57,500
There, now it's complete.

2004
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,980
I'm 75, I'm Mimic C, 75.

2005
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:06,140
Right, okay, let's rub it in.

2006
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,540
Rub it in, let's rub it in, this is what we could have had.

2007
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,100
Oh, Jesus.

2008
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:18,220
Oh my God, they have shiny, these are the shiny variants as well.

2009
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:19,740
Get to fuck, man.

2010
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,900
There's no way you can organically buy a deck.

2011
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:26,540
Like, via Gamba.

2012
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,180
Via Gamba?

2013
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,340
There's no way.

2014
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:35,420
Hyper rear, shiny rear, shiny ultimate rear, above it.

2015
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:36,940
This fucking post, yeah.

2016
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:41,820
Uncommon, common standard of Ruth.

2017
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,940
This is what, let's just pretend this is not Pokemon.

2018
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:56,300
Oh, I can't imagine if we had that though.

2019
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,820
Oh, and all the ghost tape.

2020
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:01,580
Oh my God, what are you?

2021
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,660
A whipper ghost tape?

2022
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,100
Lord Shire?

2023
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,140
Who's who?

2024
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,180
Oh, the normal tapes, yeah, we had like one normal tape.

2025
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,820
You look like Mimic C.

2026
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:20,940
This is what we could have had, got any stars, can you say?

2027
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:23,260
I'm sorry, I'm afraid to.

2028
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:28,060
Oh wow, we could have had Abra on the hidden deck.

2029
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,860
Fuck the hell.

2030
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:34,140
These hidden decks are insane.

2031
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,900
Holy shit, they have Padichur?

2032
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,380
Lunatic Luxio?

2033
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,620
Randomly just chilling out?

2034
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,260
He's like, yeah.

2035
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,940
Abra's in the deck as well?

2036
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:45,180
What?

2037
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:47,180
Who's who to forget about?

2038
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:50,380
Like, who's actually feeling so shiny on the screen?

2039
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:55,500
You're actually, you're expected to find out if he really, really likes Mudhip and

2040
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:58,860
pray to him 50 Mudhips would all be true and rare.

2041
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:03,420
Oh my God, that Mimic C.R. is so good on this one.

2042
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,340
Holy shit, he's got a failed comma.

2043
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:12,300
I love creepy little things, okay?

2044
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,060
I love creepy little things, they're so fucking cute.

2045
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,500
They're so cute.

2046
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,620
Hawaii Disney.

2047
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:23,420
Oh look, they're there.

2048
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,460
I got the first one.

2049
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,980
You got money to spend?

2050
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:33,580
That's what I'm saying, who has this money to spend?

2051
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:34,460
That's insane.

2052
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:38,220
Oh no, that was the ultra rare?

2053
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:41,260
There was the other variation of that trick?

2054
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,820
Sorry, I don't see what you're talking about.

2055
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,700
Do you think this is something different?

2056
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,180
That looks like something different.

2057
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,100
Muse in a bubble?

2058
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:52,700
Yeah, well man.

2059
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,460
Oh, that's the one we got.

2060
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,300
Sorry, Nemona, this is the one we got.

2061
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,580
Are we things creepy little things?

2062
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:02,860
You are a wordable little thing, do you think?

2063
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:05,260
God, there's a fucking God there especially.

2064
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,180
But yeah, that goes for some fucking money, huh?

2065
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,300
I don't know what these are, I don't think this is good.

2066
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:12,140
God?

2067
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,180
It looks like God.

2068
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,780
Tengu, Wu, Qian.

2069
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,340
Wait a minute, what?

2070
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,700
Qian Yu, Qian Tao.

2071
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:24,860
Wait, is Nihong good at?

2072
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,100
I'm afraid I don't speak Chinese.

2073
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,500
Are these being named after Chinese things?

2074
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,900
Poraidon, Maradon.

2075
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:38,300
It doesn't look like Pokemon, but it looks pretty open.

2076
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,540
Oh hi, thanks for coming.

2077
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,060
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

2078
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,460
Okay, right, let me read some marching novels

2079
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,300
and then we'll be directing the series.

2080
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:48,940
So let's go on.

2081
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,220
Okay, what do you...

2082
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,380
Quick, eat a card, please.

2083
01:45:58,380 --> 01:45:59,180
Do not eat a card.

2084
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:00,380
You can have a video, please.

2085
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:02,300
So, okay, hold on, adjust your volume

2086
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:03,900
because I'm not at the microphone.

2087
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:07,260
And yeah, well man, what are you doing?

2088
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,660
I'm adjusting the table.

2089
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,100
Griffy salts, hey, yeah.

2090
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:18,460
Hell yeah, apparently, Griffy salts are real mean

2091
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,260
and I didn't know that.

2092
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,020
I just really like to take a look at it.

2093
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:26,540
Okay, let's see about redirecting into Shibu.

2094
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,500
And before Shibu's not screaming, I'm gonna cry.

2095
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,420
Please tell me she's screaming.

2096
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:32,460
I miss her all the time.

2097
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:34,620
Right, let me say cheeky redirect.

2098
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:35,740
Oh yeah.

2099
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,180
And then we'll read...

2100
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,780
Is my headset...

2101
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,060
Oh, is that me making my...

2102
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:47,420
Hold on, I think I can hear myself.

2103
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,140
Is that me?

2104
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,340
I think there's something...

2105
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,460
Is it in my headset?

2106
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:55,020
It's a member stream.

2107
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:55,820
Are you joking?

2108
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:58,220
I can't fucking hit Shibu ever.

2109
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:00,620
What do you say?

2110
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:05,260
No way I can't redirect into Sheepster's.

2111
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:09,580
I'm like, oh, I finally do a stream where I wrap it up.

2112
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,700
She's not screaming.

2113
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,500
Oh god, she's in a collab later.

2114
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,460
Oh well.

2115
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:18,220
Oh my god.

2116
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,140
Sorry, I'm just so nervous.

2117
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,980
Let me rub my little feet together.

2118
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,500
I'm so nervous about you.

2119
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:26,140
I got to go.

2120
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,740
Shibu actively avoiding me.

2121
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,100
Confirmed, yeah.

2122
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:34,780
Oh, her weight rooms aren't up either,

2123
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,900
so I couldn't redirect.

2124
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,380
The other feet.

2125
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,380
Right, let me...

2126
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:44,220
Is there anyone we can redirect into?

2127
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,180
Well, I'll read Marshmallows.

2128
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:49,580
So it's actually, the Marshmallows are the most important things

2129
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:51,100
for wanting to get your facts right.

2130
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,220
I'm getting my facts right.

2131
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:53,100
I'm also getting them wrong.

2132
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:53,580
Fuck you.

2133
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,780
And I'm allowed to get them wrong, okay?

2134
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,660
I guess we're not redirecting into any...

2135
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:01,980
Well...

2136
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:07,420
So, unless Emmy has her weight room up,

2137
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:08,540
we can redirect into Emmy.

2138
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:09,740
Yes, I'm going to send you into a stream

2139
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:10,460
that's two hours away.

2140
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,500
No, I don't care if he...

2141
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,700
Does Emmy have her rooms up?

2142
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,660
I'm going to cast this particular torsion on the girls.

2143
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,420
I can't redirect into anyone.

2144
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,300
Right, Marshmallow time.

2145
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,380
Strongly wish you more luck on your pools.

2146
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:27,820
The next card stream?

2147
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,940
I'm not gambling.

2148
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,860
I'm not doing that again.

2149
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:34,060
Mummy, your hospital socks are adorable.

2150
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:34,940
Do you like them?

2151
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:37,740
National Zoom.

2152
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,380
Better tours away for Emmy than...

2153
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,820
Their weight rooms aren't up,

2154
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,940
so I can't redirect.

2155
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,340
Wait, Emmy's streaming today?

2156
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:45,900
Is it?

2157
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,420
And I'm looking at the calendar.

2158
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,900
It says, strongy, 4am,

2159
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,740
she be 6am members.

2160
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,980
Yes, I'm leaking fucking veiler secrets.

2161
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:56,460
Then it says, she be chained together with Emmy

2162
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:01,420
So Pralto and Vivian Bloss for part two with Emmy.

2163
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:02,140
She be an Emmy.

2164
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:07,420
As long as you don't cast Andrometriosis,

2165
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,500
I think Griffie thought, would it feel good?

2166
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,660
I mean, I could put coconut oil on them if you want.

2167
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,380
Hi, Mummy.

2168
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:19,820
I tried applying for the script writer section,

2169
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:20,940
but I never got the prompt.

2170
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,180
No, you didn't get the prompt unless you were accepted

2171
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:24,140
into the next stage.

2172
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:26,220
That's why there is no prompt.

2173
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,300
You're just to give your portfolio

2174
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:32,380
and give a quick about you or your interests or what not.

2175
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:35,340
No, there was no prompt given.

2176
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,420
The prompt's given to those who made it on

2177
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,660
to test their resolve.

2178
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,380
Anime style.

2179
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,820
I need to test your resolve.

2180
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,140
Oil on Griffie thought?

2181
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,180
Because what will it become?

2182
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:49,100
Mercy has one off in seven hours.

2183
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,940
Her uneye-curved cure, are you okay?

2184
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:53,340
Yes, I will redirect you into a stream

2185
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,300
that's seven hours away.

2186
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,060
No, I will not apologise either.

2187
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,940
Do you like the way my toes can bend?

2188
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:01,660
I'm always like ready to run.

2189
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,460
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2190
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,260
No, wait, what?

2191
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,260
Bend them around my tentacle.

2192
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,620
Very straightforward.

2193
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,340
Oh no.

2194
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:24,940
Right.

2195
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:25,740
Redirect.

2196
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:26,300
Merchie.

2197
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:27,580
And then I'll read the marshmallows

2198
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,700
and we can chill for the rest.

2199
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:35,340
If I may be a forward young leafling.

2200
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,220
Maybe please get a pure unfiltered

2201
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:39,740
brain rot earworm stream.

2202
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:42,380
Oh, like where I just keep saying the stuff

2203
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,500
that my brain says?

2204
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,460
I'm not sure you're gonna want that.

2205
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,540
I get very annoying very quickly.

2206
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,580
Do you walk on your toes a lot?

2207
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:56,700
I bend my feet like this part of my feet

2208
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,260
at the toes.

2209
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:59,980
I bend them a lot like all the time

2210
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,100
my feet are bent.

2211
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:02,940
They're either pressed up against something

2212
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:05,180
or bent and sorry, I just realised

2213
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,780
my hand was covering my face.

2214
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:12,060
Sorry, let me recalibrate my tracking.

2215
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,780
Real beautiful.

2216
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,380
Hello.

2217
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,500
Tell me much better.

2218
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,460
Sony, can't annoy us.

2219
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,060
I'll be the best stream.

2220
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:22,220
Do you also walk upstairs on bent toes?

2221
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:28,300
I used to walk upstairs on all fours

2222
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,740
because it was so much faster.

2223
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,540
I don't know if I've unlearned that yet.

2224
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:38,540
I don't have stairs where I am.

2225
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:43,580
But I think I still go upstairs on all fours.

2226
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,460
Like if I was back at my family house.

2227
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:51,180
I'm like 99% sure I still run upstairs on all fours.

2228
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,340
Some decrepit dog.

2229
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:54,220
Like I kid you not.

2230
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:58,620
Like I'm chasing you out the stairs.

2231
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,300
Like some fucking dog.

2232
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:03,740
If I was chasing you out like nipping your ankles

2233
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,540
on the way out.

2234
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,260
I could see that.

2235
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:10,220
I could see that.

2236
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:16,220
I slowly talk about G-Mod in Pre-Chat

2237
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:17,980
and I got hit by a wave of nostalgia.

2238
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:20,060
Yeah, that was the first time I ever played G-Mod.

2239
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,580
Glad to hear you've all enjoyed it with girls.

2240
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,180
I'm a bit surprised to hear you can't stream the game

2241
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:23,900
without lagging.

2242
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:29,580
The lag was out of control with the ping and the delay.

2243
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,580
Like I showed the girls how bad it was

2244
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:34,140
and I was like standing in the corner for 20 seconds

2245
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:34,940
waiting to move.

2246
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,980
Like it just wasn't happening.

2247
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:41,740
Shawnee chases you up the stairs

2248
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:43,180
to put you to bed ASMR.

2249
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:45,260
That would be terrifying.

2250
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:48,620
Like oh I get scared of like the idea of being chased.

2251
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,220
You know people are like oh I like pre-hunter type stuff.

2252
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:55,500
I'm like I'm fucking absolutely fucking terrified.

2253
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,300
Do not chase me.

2254
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,820
I'll start screaming.

2255
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:59,500
Okay you heard that scream yesterday

2256
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:00,700
in the Subnautica stream.

2257
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,180
Like I do not take chase and lately.

2258
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,380
Is the members Overwatch VOD gone forever?

2259
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,380
It can't come back on the channel

2260
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:09,820
due to what happened in it.

2261
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,140
I do have the full VOD.

2262
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:14,700
I don't know what to do with it.

2263
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,220
Well it was just too much.

2264
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,380
Is the bottom line?

2265
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,940
I mean I could maybe just put on blue sight later

2266
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,140
once we actually use it.

2267
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:27,020
The screaming is half the fun.

2268
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:30,380
I hear that stream still in mind.

2269
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,020
Did anyone stream Gmod?

2270
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:34,780
No we were just playing together.

2271
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:40,140
Shawnee is the monster that appears

2272
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:41,260
when you turn the lights off.

2273
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,020
Mummy I would interact more such as

2274
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:51,820
in the stream snipes

2275
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,100
what the reeflings are there for your

2276
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,020
lovely voice if they heard mine

2277
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:57,180
would all turn gay like the pinpals.

2278
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:02,300
Oh is this reefling confident in their voice?

2279
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:05,980
You need to come on the mic next time.

2280
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:06,780
What's going on?

2281
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:12,300
We've got a cocky reefling up in here.

2282
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,740
We've got a non-R wordable reefling

2283
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:17,740
confident in your what?

2284
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,540
Get on the mic and the next stream snipe.

2285
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:22,060
We want to hear it okay.

2286
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:26,300
No pressure making those claims

2287
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,460
around these parts partner okay.

2288
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:31,020
Private reefling brother.

2289
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,700
Shawnee calling your buff reefling.

2290
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,100
So I'm sitting here watching stream

2291
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,140
and pitching a tent.

2292
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:36,460
What?

2293
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,260
Oh the denial got me messed up.

2294
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,780
I was going to say I was like to the feet.

2295
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:43,900
I was like excuse me.

2296
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,340
I mean if you like it that much

2297
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:46,300
I can do a little dance for you.

2298
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:47,900
Oh wait.

2299
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,380
Can I do it?

2300
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:52,460
How does Billie Jean is not my love?

2301
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:57,180
She's just a girl who thinks I am my heart.

2302
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,500
Oh shit.

2303
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,940
But the kids are my shine.

2304
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,780
What happened during the out stream

2305
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:06,140
are you meaning to ask?

2306
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:07,740
What happened?

2307
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:08,460
What happened?

2308
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:14,620
There were consequences if you lost on

2309
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:16,620
Overwatch with me okay.

2310
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,380
That's the best way I got.

2311
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:21,660
That's the most brunt brute force way

2312
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,300
that I can say it.

2313
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,740
Thank you Broly legend for the tip.

2314
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:25,900
That is the most brute force way I can say it.

2315
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:31,340
If you lost your game then you lost the ability to

2316
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,580
pre-stream dance was true Scottish dance.

2317
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,180
No you're not.

2318
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,780
You can't be a vodling yet.

2319
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,620
Not until the stream is over.

2320
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:43,260
Vodlings are illegal until the stream is over okay.

2321
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:47,340
The consequences aren't real without the vod though.

2322
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,940
I mean I still have it on my desktop.

2323
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:49,260
Shit.

2324
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:50,380
You want me to open up the file?

2325
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:52,940
You want to hear it?

2326
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:57,820
Here's me.

2327
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,140
Oh my god.

2328
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,780
Meal and stream.

2329
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:02,940
There you go.

2330
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:03,900
I got the full vod.

2331
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,180
So I don't know what claims you're coming out with.

2332
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,940
Nice try though.

2333
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,020
It was initially 480s.

2334
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:12,380
It was a mis-input.

2335
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,180
Hi strongy.

2336
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:16,460
Most people that buy the cards want duplicates

2337
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:17,740
because they play the game

2338
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:19,900
and you need multiple for making decks.

2339
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:27,660
How they are but it is makes this fucking hell

2340
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:28,860
can't read your English.

2341
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:31,740
How they make but is right you.

2342
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:35,260
I have problems reading English.

2343
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:36,860
You had problems typing English.

2344
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:39,420
So together the combination isn't working

2345
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,420
but it's okay there's other parts of our body

2346
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:42,780
that'll work together just fine.

2347
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,340
I assure you.

2348
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,980
The strongest cards on the rarest

2349
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:48,940
making people spend more money,

2350
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:51,340
spend more money to try and get the dupes they need.

2351
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:51,580
Okay.

2352
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:52,780
Yeah.

2353
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:53,180
I tried.

2354
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:54,540
We both tried.

2355
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:54,860
Okay.

2356
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:55,500
We both tried.

2357
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,620
We're having a stroke together

2358
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:57,740
but not like that.

2359
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:58,380
Hey moment.

2360
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:59,100
Random question.

2361
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:00,940
But was Space Marine 2 a trending on Warhammer?

2362
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,580
Have you thought of doing Warhammer 40k in general?

2363
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,020
So I did fermentide.

2364
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,940
I've seen some gameplay of Space Marine 2.

2365
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:09,260
I'll need to watch other people play it more

2366
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:11,340
but I think we will do it together

2367
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,100
if it's a stream snipe game.

2368
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:15,020
If Space Marine I can get you in stream snipe.

2369
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:17,340
I would like to play it with you for the first time.

2370
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:18,220
I think it would be nice.

2371
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,100
Um yeah.

2372
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:22,700
This is now a feet stream.

2373
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:24,540
You want me to talk with my feet?

2374
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:28,140
So I think we can play Space Marine 2 together

2375
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:30,620
but it has to be a stream snipe.

2376
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,780
Will fermentide come back?

2377
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,260
I think so but much later on.

2378
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:38,620
Every syllable I hit my feet okay.

2379
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:39,980
Hello.

2380
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,340
Any good cards today?

2381
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:42,780
Uh so yeah let me show you.

2382
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,660
Hold on.

2383
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:44,220
Hold on.

2384
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:44,620
Wait.

2385
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,860
Uh we got...

2386
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:50,860
Hold on.

2387
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:52,540
I'll see if I can show you the real ones real quick.

2388
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:53,740
I know I'm further away from the mic.

2389
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:54,300
Forgive me.

2390
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,780
Uh kind of had a little shiny guy there.

2391
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,620
We got guard devour shiny.

2392
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,180
Are you ready?

2393
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,180
The most important card.

2394
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:06,700
The Bokuwara SEX.

2395
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,020
SEX.

2396
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:11,020
SEX.

2397
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:13,020
SEX.

2398
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:13,820
SEX.

2399
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:17,100
Unfortunately very empty deck but we got Noibat.

2400
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,300
Uh Noivern.

2401
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,260
Noibat lane.

2402
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:20,380
Very happy with that so.

2403
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,500
Um it's not the best.

2404
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:27,500
We did get a very spanking rare like all the way back here.

2405
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,060
Where is it?

2406
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:32,380
We got a rare thing that's supposed to be a tentacrow

2407
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:33,020
but they changed that.

2408
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:34,220
I don't know what they did.

2409
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:35,660
Bokuwara SEX.

2410
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,420
And we got a rare pool on him.

2411
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:38,860
A little wiggly worm boy.

2412
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:41,260
And then our last pool was Neruso.

2413
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,140
Oh no of course not.

2414
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:45,580
Neruso's his youtuber that I watched.

2415
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:49,820
Her name is Nemono.

2416
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,340
Not Neruso.

2417
01:58:58,700 --> 01:58:59,020
Um.

2418
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:06,060
Hello mom I just wanted to say that you're doing a good job.

2419
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:07,180
You stop that.

2420
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,460
I'm not giving brain worms.

2421
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,180
Thank you.

2422
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:09,740
I try.

2423
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,340
Don't worry about it.

2424
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:14,140
Some will just get brain worms and it's inevitable bubble.

2425
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:15,820
But you're still doing a very good job.

2426
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,500
Keeping them at bay.

2427
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,060
Also interacting with you is not always good.

2428
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:22,060
Imagine getting 48 days of no income.

2429
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:23,580
No I didn't understand that.

2430
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:24,700
It was a misinput.

2431
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:27,420
A jail bird spot.

2432
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,300
I just like Neruso.

2433
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,740
I like her big fat titties.

2434
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:30,860
Deep cups with X.

2435
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,620
Oh wait she doesn't want us to say that anymore.

2436
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:33,580
Oh.

2437
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,580
I never said that.

2438
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,420
Strony is short for stronethin.

2439
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,260
Sadly I'm not smart enough to do something clever with cuttles.

2440
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:43,260
So it doesn't beat Jimmy B soup.

2441
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,380
I'm called stronethin.

2442
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:47,660
Is that my legal name?

2443
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:47,980
Fuck.

2444
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,740
Stronethin?

2445
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:50,060
Shit.

2446
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,780
Can we take the socks off?

2447
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:54,780
Reeflin!

2448
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:56,780
No.

2449
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,220
That comes late.

2450
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:00,540
But I'll still talk through my feet though.

2451
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:02,380
Hi strony.

2452
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:05,020
I still have time on my no ink in your legs and thighs.

2453
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,540
You're making it hard to get right.

2454
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,100
Oh I just need stretch.

2455
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:10,380
Oh look at the shape of that.

2456
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,660
Look at the calf muscle shape.

2457
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:12,780
Can you tell I ride a bike?

2458
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,260
Can you tell I got some stamina?

2459
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:16,300
What did Neruso say?

2460
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:17,580
I could have sworn Neruso was like

2461
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:19,100
I've had enough of yous being like I have big...

2462
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,220
Can you tell I ride a bike yes or no?

2463
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:22,860
Be honest.

2464
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,380
Can you tell?

2465
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,020
Do I ride a bike yes or no?

2466
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:28,480
No.

2467
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:33,340
Pray please it's my birthday?

2468
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:33,820
No.

2469
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:37,180
I hope that bike isn't the only thing you ride.

2470
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:39,660
Well I did say I'm re-sexual so...

2471
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:43,340
And...

2472
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,780
How long does it take for you to train your back door?

2473
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,340
That's for another stream.

2474
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:58,140
Okay.

2475
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:00,060
Did we all enjoy the wholesome Pokemon time?

2476
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,420
Sorry I just dropped the ball over here.

2477
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:04,860
The idle foot cam is killing me with my boot bit.

2478
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:05,820
Your foot interests.

2479
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:06,540
They are so cute.

2480
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:07,180
Please let me...

2481
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,100
You like my feet?

2482
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,260
Would you like them even more if they were oiled up?

2483
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,500
Is there anyone here that's into CBT?

2484
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,460
Be honest.

2485
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,780
I too enjoy cognitive behavioral therapy.

2486
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:25,180
It is great for helping your health and overall thoughts.

2487
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:29,820
I wish I had something square...

2488
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:30,540
I did!

2489
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:32,620
Oh my god.

2490
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:36,700
I was like, I wish I had something especially I could stand on.

2491
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:42,620
There.

2492
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,500
Can I slip on this?

2493
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,820
Holy crap this is like so slippery.

2494
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:52,780
There stop it you're being denied.

2495
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:57,260
Have you seen that video where she's like doing this?

2496
02:01:57,820 --> 02:01:58,940
To the guys?

2497
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:00,140
For no particular reason.

2498
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:01,500
Oh, playing a bit fit.

2499
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,380
Bit fit.

2500
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:03,500
Oh yeah the Celtics on!

2501
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,140
Celtics on!

2502
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:04,780
Everyone shut up!

2503
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:05,420
Celtics playing!

2504
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:07,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2505
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:15,260
Don't know if it's possible but putting the missing OW2 stream on Bansley would be a good solution.

2506
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:15,500
Probably.

2507
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:20,220
Seeing what happened in the stream I think the reeflings who missed it would greatly appreciate it.

2508
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:21,260
Yes, I can do that.

2509
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:24,380
Just not yet because I'm not ready for it yet.

2510
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:25,420
Oh, oh, Celtics on!

2511
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:25,980
Celtics on!

2512
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:26,460
She shoots!

2513
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,740
Oh, she scores!

2514
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:28,540
Let's go.

2515
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,020
Let's go.

2516
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:30,140
I lost.

2517
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,260
Unfortunately I know where she's talking about!

2518
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:33,820
I win!

2519
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:35,740
Don't slip.

2520
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:37,340
Oh, don't slip the slide.

2521
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:37,980
Can't read it.

2522
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:40,700
Oh, so this is the Pokemon stream.

2523
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:43,900
Let's just put some cards in the viewpoint at least, you know.

2524
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:44,300
There.

2525
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,820
Now it's a real Pokemon stream.

2526
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:47,980
Hi cuddles!

2527
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:50,540
I'm much bigger and stronger than you but the thought of you dominant.

2528
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:52,140
Oh, can I read these?

2529
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:54,620
I don't think I can read these.

2530
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:57,820
Ahem.

2531
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:05,660
Do you want to float?

2532
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:09,420
Love it.

2533
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:10,300
Love it too, though.

2534
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:14,460
What about the one with the guy in the floorboard?

2535
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,500
Yeah, that was the one.

2536
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:18,780
I was at Azura put it in the discord?

2537
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:21,980
Like Azura randomly put it in the discord.

2538
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:26,780
And she thought it was fake.

2539
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:28,300
And it was like, no Azura.

2540
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:30,860
This is real cognitive behavioral therapy.

2541
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,900
And all of us were like, what is this?

2542
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:36,140
And we all watched it and it was the guy like, oh!

2543
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:41,740
And it was like, Azura, what do you mean you thought it was fake?

2544
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:43,340
You can see it getting redder.

2545
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:46,220
That was very much not fake, no.

2546
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:48,060
Yeah, yeah.

2547
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:52,460
It's thank you Nihongo or Nides for the tip.

2548
02:03:56,060 --> 02:04:00,060
But yes, the diamond diamond.

2549
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:02,060
Some Pokemon card opened and this was off.

2550
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,700
Are you enjoying the card?

2551
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:09,580
Hopefully.

2552
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,540
What's the gen donation?

2553
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:14,780
Oh, I'm annoying you with Shibi tomorrow.

2554
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,780
Yeah, me and Shibi are going to be a drill.

2555
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:20,780
She's never played the portal to Azura into it.

2556
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:23,660
I don't, I think she just didn't think it was real.

2557
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:24,460
And she was like, oh.

2558
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:28,940
I have seen it smashed between two boards.

2559
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:32,300
Most horrific one I thought was a lady in heels

2560
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:34,620
where she actually gives them a pure, oh fuck that man.

2561
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:39,100
I think the worst thing I ever saw was like a flattening device.

2562
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:43,580
But it was flattened to like, I'm not even like an eighth of an inch.

2563
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:45,020
It was flattened.

2564
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,420
Like, I wasn't saying.

2565
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:50,940
A feet cam featuring some Pokemon cards.

2566
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:51,580
Oh yeah, sorry.

2567
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:53,340
I'm to talk via my feet.

2568
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:54,220
Hello, Reefling.

2569
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:00,140
Flattening device?

2570
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:01,580
Yeah, please stop.

2571
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:04,220
Well, I'm helping you if you're in the denial.

2572
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,060
I'm actually throwing you a bone.

2573
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:12,940
A CBT is also your special interest?

2574
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,140
No!

2575
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,900
Oh dear, poor Reefling.

2576
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:18,060
Hi, Strony.

2577
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,380
This has been the longest 48 hours of my life.

2578
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:20,700
Well.

2579
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,340
Flattening device?

2580
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:26,540
More like Strony's cake.

2581
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:27,500
Oh yeah, you wanna see that too?

2582
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,180
Kidding!

2583
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:29,900
You saw.

2584
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:30,460
You saw.

2585
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:33,820
This is bad as the time as Narissa mentioned

2586
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:35,580
giving a guy a paper cut and taking his...

2587
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,380
What story did she tell us?

2588
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:40,940
Your hands are funny looking.

2589
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:42,300
I know they're claws.

2590
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:44,220
I got fake nails on.

2591
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:46,220
Let me see them.

2592
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,700
Little fake nails.

2593
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:49,900
Where the fuck is the webcam?

2594
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:50,780
Easy, I can't find them.

2595
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,500
Yeah, what an interesting design.

2596
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,220
Middle finger and thumb only on the purple?

2597
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,140
This is supposed to be purple.

2598
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:00,060
It looked purple in the shop.

2599
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,580
And then I walked outside and it's blue

2600
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,300
and I'm like, I assure you,

2601
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:04,140
we do not have a fucking Celtic and Rangers

2602
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,260
bloody YouTuber model.

2603
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,740
Look, me getting a bit political

2604
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:09,420
around these parts, aren't we?

2605
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:10,780
What, me?

2606
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,020
Close beta testing.

2607
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:13,420
Yes.

2608
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:16,860
The Card Shop Simulator game

2609
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:17,980
released full version,

2610
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:19,020
which I really wanna play.

2611
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:25,420
Sorry, I'm getting a lot of good feedback on my legs

2612
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:27,660
when I'm stretching and things like this.

2613
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,340
This feels really nice.

2614
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:31,580
As I said, I always have my toes

2615
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:33,740
pushed in against something.

2616
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:37,980
If you can't handle strontia or stumpies,

2617
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:40,300
you don't deserve her at her suppies.

2618
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:43,180
Is your kitty around?

2619
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:44,380
I don't think so.

2620
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:45,500
Hold on, I can go ask.

2621
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:48,220
I'll go ask Camely.

2622
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:52,140
Camely, are you there, Camely?

2623
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:56,140
Camely, where'd you go?

2624
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:01,500
Are you coming?

2625
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,860
I don't know if you can see her.

2626
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,140
Come.

2627
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,340
Come on.

2628
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:08,380
I heard there's a...

2629
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:10,380
Come on.

2630
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,300
Vigo doesn't like this one,

2631
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,980
so I'm not gonna even ask him.

2632
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:14,940
Get away.

2633
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:17,900
Come explore the Pokémon.

2634
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,180
Where are you going, Vigo?

2635
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,180
She's...

2636
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:25,660
She's no longer in this race.

2637
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:27,180
She's a spirit.

2638
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:28,140
She's a spirit.

2639
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:29,100
She's a spirit.

2640
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:30,060
She's a spirit.

2641
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,020
She's a spirit.

2642
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:31,900
She's a spirit.

2643
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,940
She's a spirit.

2644
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:33,740
She's a spirit.

2645
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,460
She's a spirit.

2646
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:35,340
She's a spirit.

2647
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,420
I just need her to jump there.

2648
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:38,460
She's a spirit.

2649
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:40,540
I'm scared here.

2650
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,180
Because normally I'm super quiet,

2651
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:44,780
and then I get all nice and loud with you.

2652
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:46,380
Who do you mean?

2653
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:48,700
Camely's gonna chew on the corn.

2654
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:53,260
Give him my things.

2655
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:54,140
She didn't hate me.

2656
02:07:54,140 --> 02:07:54,540
She just...

2657
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:56,540
Because I'm very quiet.

2658
02:07:57,420 --> 02:08:01,660
Like, I spoke on G mode with the girls this morning,

2659
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,820
and Vigo was meowing his head off

2660
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,260
as I was like, Vigo, Vigo, Vigo.

2661
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:12,220
A peacock girl.

2662
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:12,860
Interesting.

2663
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:14,140
No, this is not peacock.

2664
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,980
You can't guess from the colour scheme.

2665
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:17,740
It's supposed to be purple and green.

2666
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:21,180
You cannot guess what this type of girl

2667
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:22,380
would be from the nails alone.

2668
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:24,780
It is not possible,

2669
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,900
but no, she's not peacock.

2670
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:26,780
It is purple.

2671
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,900
It's supposed to be purple,

2672
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:29,180
but that's very blue on screen.

2673
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,100
Hospital socks again?

2674
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:33,020
When am I never out of them?

2675
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:34,780
Hmm?

2676
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:36,380
Have you ever seen me out of hospital socks?

2677
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:37,980
I'm actually in the hospital right now,

2678
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,580
and they just let me do what I please.

2679
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:45,020
I give them no grief when I get to hang out with the refunds,

2680
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:46,380
and I get to do what I want.

2681
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:47,340
I get no grief,

2682
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,420
so they let me have a little pee pee

2683
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:50,620
in my little stream once.

2684
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,380
Feet nails?

2685
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:53,100
Nails.

2686
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:53,420
Hmm.

2687
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:57,820
There's a pee in.

2688
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,780
There's a pee in.

2689
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:00,540
Oh, there.

2690
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,300
Mummy's in the hospital?

2691
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,260
Yeah.

2692
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:04,860
All right, I got to go get some dinner.

2693
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:05,580
Rest well.

2694
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,620
Thank you for hanging.

2695
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:10,380
And I...

2696
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:12,140
I'm actually going to redirect into emergency.

2697
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:13,820
This is a much shorter stream today.

2698
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:14,780
Down badling?

2699
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:15,660
You can say.

2700
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:16,620
Noodle arms.

2701
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:17,100
Uh-huh.

2702
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:18,460
Humongous cake.

2703
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:18,780
Yes.

2704
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:22,220
And some nice-looking athletic legs.

2705
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:23,020
Uh-huh.

2706
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,060
So looking good.

2707
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:25,260
Oh, you want to taste?

2708
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,300
You want to taste of this cuttlefish?

2709
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:30,060
You like calamari?

2710
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:30,780
Caramari?

2711
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:36,380
Thank you, down badling, for the tip that you have.

2712
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:40,460
Be proven from the psych ward, actually, though,

2713
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:42,220
for real, for real, could you imagine?

2714
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:43,580
I could pull that off.

2715
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:44,460
Don't think I couldn't.

2716
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,500
All you need to do is a bit of bribery.

2717
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:48,780
Imagine, like, I'll be like,

2718
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:50,220
look, let me get my nails done.

2719
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:53,260
I'll give you a one-hour ASMR session through your heads.

2720
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:55,820
Like, I'll give you the, like, headpats for one hour.

2721
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:56,300
Boom.

2722
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:56,620
Right.

2723
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:56,940
There.

2724
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:57,740
I got the stuff.

2725
02:09:57,740 --> 02:09:58,940
I got my nails done.

2726
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,380
Okay, next thing I need.

2727
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:04,380
I need materials and supplies and PC and monitor,

2728
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:05,020
and I need a room.

2729
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:07,500
So I'm actually in the staff room right now, okay?

2730
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,820
I'm in the staff room of the asylum.

2731
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:12,380
And they're just letting me be it

2732
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:14,380
because I'm not giving them any tip when I'm like this.

2733
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:17,900
Oh, God, Gira.

2734
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:20,380
Gira's back, back, back.

2735
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,140
Yeah, this is back, back, back.

2736
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:26,380
Yes, this is back, yes, this is back, yes, this is back.

2737
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,580
Do, do, do.

2738
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,420
Don't ask why she's in that pose.

2739
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:30,700
Don't ask.

2740
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:33,420
Thank you for the tip.

2741
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:33,900
Bam.

2742
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,700
I think I'm in black today.

2743
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,140
Yep.

2744
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,180
Black, if you see that.

2745
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:43,500
Yep.

2746
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:45,740
Why is she in that pose?

2747
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:46,460
No, I don't know.

2748
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,100
Don't ask me.

2749
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:48,540
Don't ask me.

2750
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:49,820
I don't know.

2751
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:50,300
Hold on.

2752
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:51,740
I'm just grabbing that.

2753
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:52,940
I need my bobbers.

2754
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:54,220
Right.

2755
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,340
I'm ready to wrap up.

2756
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,140
Is there anything I need to tell you?

2757
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,580
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2758
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:02,860
The face connect girls livin' a psych ward?

2759
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:05,040
Oh.

2760
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,820
I just forbidden lore.

2761
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:10,540
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

2762
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:12,860
Is this face connect lore that I don't know about?

2763
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:14,860
You guys need to teach me about other retours.

2764
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,820
It's weird you're in black.

2765
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:21,580
I have absolutely terrible news.

2766
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:27,580
I have absolutely horrific news about what I look like day to day.

2767
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:33,180
I am a pale, pasty, pasty goth, okay?

2768
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:36,620
That puts no effort into her appearance.

2769
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,120
So.

2770
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,340
You can hear like, huh?

2771
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:48,700
I understand why people get parasocial over shimmers

2772
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:50,540
after watching news, Ronnie.

2773
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:52,460
Okay, I relearned what parasocial meant.

2774
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:54,300
I thought parasocial meant you're coming to my house

2775
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:55,820
and it was like dangerous.

2776
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:57,500
But it's not dangerous.

2777
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,420
And as long as it's happy, then it's good.

2778
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:00,140
Like it's fine.

2779
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,540
So thank you, Ethan.

2780
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:04,700
For the nice comment.

2781
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:06,620
That is how it means, yes.

2782
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:08,700
You're too powerful.

2783
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:11,580
And she's ever not wearing black.

2784
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:13,340
I do have black rippy socks.

2785
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:15,580
Terrible news.

2786
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:18,060
Ronnie's in fact, demure and mindful.

2787
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:19,900
That's straight up a thought.

2788
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,740
That is technically parasocial in a way.

2789
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:25,020
I thought if it was unhealthy, then it's parasocial and bad.

2790
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:27,100
But if it's like, fuck, I'm actually happy

2791
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:28,940
and I'm enjoying watching like shit.

2792
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:29,740
I thought that was good.

2793
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:30,540
Like, fuck me.

2794
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:32,540
Fuck me.

2795
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:35,660
Like let's jump into a match of fucking left for dead too.

2796
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,420
We're going to finish the campaign together.

2797
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:39,500
Am I going mental?

2798
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:41,180
I think I might misunderstand.

2799
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:44,300
Cause like, which is more grippy?

2800
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:46,300
Ronnie socks or her actual bear grippers?

2801
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,900
Oh no, I can go rip.

2802
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,740
I have toes that fucking grip.

2803
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:51,900
I assure you, I just can't do it with salt on, okay?

2804
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:53,180
Trust me, bro.

2805
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:54,300
I'll do it in another stream, okay?

2806
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:59,660
Can get bad, but mainly just get social very vicariously.

2807
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,620
Oh, that's a big word.

2808
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:02,140
That's a big word for Elmo.

2809
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:05,980
It depends how far gone mentally the person is.

2810
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:08,780
I thought it was just like, you're nice to each other and shit.

2811
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:10,700
Like you say, I love you, mummy.

2812
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,220
And I say, I love you, reflin.

2813
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:14,060
And it's like, Ken what?

2814
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:16,220
If you don't fucking hear it, if, you know,

2815
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:17,900
if you don't have got someone in your life that says,

2816
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:18,300
Ken what?

2817
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:19,580
I fucking love you.

2818
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:20,620
Flaws and all.

2819
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:23,180
Well, fucking excuse me for being the one to do it.

2820
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:25,500
Like you do deserve to be told that you're loved

2821
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:29,420
and you do deserve to be told that, like, yeah.

2822
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,460
If we judged each other for like our worst fucking days,

2823
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:34,300
would any of us fucking be here?

2824
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:35,740
No, cause when you've had a bad day,

2825
02:13:35,740 --> 02:13:37,180
you've had a fucking dry day.

2826
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:37,820
Ken, what I mean?

2827
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:38,780
Or am I misunderstood?

2828
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,660
I think I'm misunderstood.

2829
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,060
I don't know.

2830
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:42,700
Power socials character, great teenage girl,

2831
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:44,140
loves actor, good power socials.

2832
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,420
Ronnie and the reflins, good.

2833
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,500
Reflins to Ronnie, good, stop or bad.

2834
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,300
Right, okay.

2835
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:48,700
Yeah.

2836
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:49,500
Oh, how cute.

2837
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,540
She's delusional.

2838
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,300
Am I in the silence?

2839
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:54,060
People can take it too seriously and go too far.

2840
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:55,340
I love everything about you, Shen.

2841
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:56,380
It's a spectrum.

2842
02:13:56,380 --> 02:13:57,900
What a good thing I'm an autist then.

2843
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,220
I've mastered this part.

2844
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:02,860
They are both good and bad.

2845
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,180
Some people just take it too far and it's a bad thing.

2846
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:05,900
I love her so much.

2847
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,020
I love two people.

2848
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:08,380
This right here.

2849
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:09,580
I agree with this one.

2850
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:14,140
Yeah, I just like, am I good mental?

2851
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:15,180
I feel like if it was like,

2852
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,940
I'm not playing games with you on stream.

2853
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:18,060
I'm not saying I love you.

2854
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,580
I'm not saying da, da, da, da.

2855
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:21,980
I was like, why would you want to put your stonks

2856
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:24,220
into a strummer like that anyway?

2857
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:28,700
Isn't it not fucking nice to be told you're appreciated

2858
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:29,420
and you're loved?

2859
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:31,100
And yeah, you might be a lurker.

2860
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:31,900
You might only talk.

2861
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,820
You might only be able to catch me in the boards.

2862
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:37,900
I am still appreciative of your time that you put into me

2863
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:40,780
because you, I'll say it again.

2864
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:42,940
I'll say it again.

2865
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:46,700
You could literally be consuming any other content creator

2866
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,540
right at this very second.

2867
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:50,140
And yet you chose me.

2868
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:54,140
The watermelon-haired hypnotic cuttlefish

2869
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:56,860
that's done two hypnosis streams and called it a day.

2870
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:00,460
Like, I don't know how to, I don't know how to tell you.

2871
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,660
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

2872
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:06,460
And Hydrus Simothadius.

2873
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:08,380
Fucking good luck saying that right.

2874
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:09,740
Thank you for becoming a member.

2875
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:11,420
Please enjoy your moments.

2876
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:12,540
I love your ASMR.

2877
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:16,220
Well, you're going to be in for a treat tomorrow.

2878
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:16,780
Oh, sure.

2879
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:17,260
Yes.

2880
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:18,780
And I wouldn't choose any other.

2881
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:21,500
Thank you, my man.

2882
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,380
Why are you called that?

2883
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:26,620
You've got an interesting gamertag.

2884
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:29,020
And birth an amazing gen.

2885
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:30,460
Sounds really appealing to me.

2886
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:32,780
Literally, like, do you want to make sure you're happy?

2887
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,420
If you're streaming and you're happy

2888
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:36,620
and you know what, clap your hands.

2889
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:38,060
Hey, oh.

2890
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:48,220
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

2891
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:59,020
You could see the thought forming in my mind.

2892
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:04,700
You could see it forming in my mind

2893
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:08,140
when the words came out and I did the fucking thing.

2894
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:11,260
You could see it.

2895
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,380
I'm going to sit on my chair.

2896
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:13,420
I'm going to sit on my chair.

2897
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:16,140
I'm going to sit on my little game of chair.

2898
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:16,780
Oh, no.

2899
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:17,500
You can see the wheel.

2900
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:17,820
Oh, my God.

2901
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:18,380
How embarrassing.

2902
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:19,740
You can see the wheel of my game of chair.

2903
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:21,260
There.

2904
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,460
Pokemon's from by the way.

2905
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,940
We could see your hands in the shadow.

2906
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:29,660
I love you, Strani, because you just seem cool.

2907
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:30,460
Also, clap, clap.

2908
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:36,460
Like, as you see, like, you're here to have a good time.

2909
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,700
I'm here to have a good time.

2910
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:41,180
We can play video together and stuff like that.

2911
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:43,820
Parasocial can be that you really like the streamer

2912
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:46,460
as a friend and want to watch and help her on one end,

2913
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:49,260
but also can mean that you decide to find her

2914
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:50,860
and try to visit her or hurt her.

2915
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:51,740
Yeah, that's scary.

2916
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:53,420
The streamer is only yours.

2917
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,740
Depends on the mental from fan.

2918
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:58,780
Yeah, like, that part's scary.

2919
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,100
But the bit before where it's like,

2920
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:04,220
fuck yeah, hold my hand through fucking Subnautica.

2921
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:05,740
Like, oh, my God, I love that game.

2922
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:06,460
Can we play?

2923
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:07,980
I wish Subnautica was multiplayer.

2924
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:10,620
I'd go fucking mental if it was multiplayer.

2925
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,460
I'd be so brave.

2926
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:14,220
I wouldn't be screaming at the reapers

2927
02:17:14,220 --> 02:17:15,260
or anything like that.

2928
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:16,940
Thank you.

2929
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:21,820
Bit of an educational link for the tit.

2930
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,820
Yeah, I see that's right.

2931
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:26,380
Personally, I'm happy to talk and flirt here.

2932
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:27,980
And all the other reflins are nice too.

2933
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:31,500
However, I don't think you have some deeper feelings for me,

2934
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,020
especially since you don't actually know me.

2935
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:34,620
Give me that dick.

2936
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:35,420
Now, let's find out.

2937
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,820
I'm trying so hard.

2938
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,500
Had to become a member for the Great Vison.

2939
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:47,740
Do not be expecting feet membership streams.

2940
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:48,860
Oh, my gosh.

2941
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:51,740
I'm so sorry to disappoint you

2942
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:53,900
if you signed up for feet membership streams.

2943
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:03,660
I mean, I could do oiled up earcup and ASMR

2944
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,860
with my feet, I guess.

2945
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:12,460
Like, except only expect membership streams.

2946
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:15,980
Like, I don't know if you saw it.

2947
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:17,500
There was Goon Cave review.

2948
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:23,260
Aw.

2949
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:25,820
I'd love to take photos with Mama,

2950
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,660
even if you're a TV on a stick.

2951
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,380
A TV on a stick?

2952
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:29,900
I can even wear my Mama's sweater

2953
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,580
under score love, under score love.

2954
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:33,020
Oh, that's okay.

2955
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:33,980
Thank you, basically.

2956
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:36,220
I've never been to a con either.

2957
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,500
You want me to zoom about.

2958
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:39,740
Can I run you over if I'm one of those robots?

2959
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:41,100
Can I run into you?

2960
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:44,060
I can give you a struggle, snuggle tackle

2961
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:45,260
if I'm in one of those robots

2962
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:47,820
and then I have to pay like $3,000 in damages

2963
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:48,780
to the equipment.

2964
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:52,540
Strongly takes your con chair at will.

2965
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:56,380
It's been done before.

2966
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:58,380
You can run into us, but you might fall afar.

2967
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:00,780
To be honest, just the yapping stream

2968
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:02,860
of feet in the background would be nice to.

2969
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:05,420
I do love a good yapping, honestly.

2970
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:09,900
Are you do larger scale playing with viewers?

2971
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,180
What's in life or do you have an idea

2972
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:12,860
that the other ones can come in

2973
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:14,300
and play mountain blade banner?

2974
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,580
We might do SCP.

2975
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:20,940
I'm going to see if we can do SCP maybe for my birthday.

2976
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:21,980
No, I'm just making memes.

2977
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:22,620
Sorry, my bad.

2978
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:23,340
No, you're fine.

2979
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:24,220
Don't apologize.

2980
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,260
See, yeah, brainworm.

2981
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,180
Don't let the brainworms win.

2982
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:28,940
I just don't know how to say your name properly.

2983
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:37,420
Thank you for the tip.

2984
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,500
Solve a Rubik's cube with your feet real.

2985
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,100
I might try that.

2986
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:51,500
Dangerous parasociality is pretty much never a creator's fault.

2987
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:54,940
Let's not forget poor Björk had a literal insane stalker

2988
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:58,460
in the 90s and she never read his Dono's or Erotic Malo's.

2989
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,020
Oh!

2990
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:01,500
Healthy fans know how to love some respects

2991
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:02,700
with their friends' length.

2992
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:05,900
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

2993
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:06,220
Okay.

2994
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:12,060
And she never read his Dono's or his Erotic Marsh Malo's.

2995
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:13,900
Hi, Stronny.

2996
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:17,580
I want to run my tongue up your legs and thigh until I've missed.

2997
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,980
I memorized what your legs and thighs feel like.

2998
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:23,660
Right.

2999
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:27,180
Mount and Blade Bannerlord and have both fan bases fight each other

3000
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:28,780
in the battlefield through their Oshii.

3001
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:38,780
Honestly, is that that game where the guy was like Tally Ho and he died

3002
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:42,140
and they have to like cock their guns?

3003
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:46,860
Like they have to like shove the barrel up and down it

3004
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,740
and then reload it?

3005
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:48,620
Like that old game?

3006
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:53,980
Bannerlord is pretty hard though.

3007
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:54,220
Yeah.

3008
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:56,620
You're on about him.

3009
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:57,740
I think he can.

3010
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:01,420
There's another game that's like, it's a multiplayer game

3011
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,980
and there was like a really funny clip and he was like,

3012
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,740
I'm going to make it and he dies instantly.

3013
02:21:05,740 --> 02:21:07,260
You might be thinking of hold fast.

3014
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:10,780
It's a medieval war game.

3015
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:18,700
Role blocks, rust, factorial, Minecraft?

3016
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:24,060
I don't know.

3017
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:26,300
I don't know what I want to do for my Donathon.

3018
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:30,620
I really like doing the collab on the Donathon.

3019
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:35,980
I thought it would be possible to maybe do crab game stream snipe.

3020
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:40,860
I thought that would be fun.

3021
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:42,940
Not all the girls have to stream it if they don't want to,

3022
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:44,700
but I would like them to be there

3023
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:48,300
and then you guys literally have the opportunity to stream snipe

3024
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:49,820
like me and my gen mates.

3025
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:52,540
Not just me, like all six of us are going to be in it.

3026
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,620
Bannerlord is with the boobs.

3027
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,020
Okay.

3028
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,380
Yeah, I don't know.

3029
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:01,740
Crab game is a bit meh,

3030
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:05,820
but you guys would like genuinely make it much more interesting.

3031
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:08,460
So I'm going to see if maybe crab game

3032
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:09,740
will be the stream snipe one.

3033
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:15,980
Factorial can have 65,000 people on a server at once.

3034
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:17,260
How?

3035
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:20,140
How?

3036
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:22,860
Who coded that?

3037
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:27,660
That man needs some under the table support.

3038
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:30,460
65,000 people on a server at once.

3039
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:32,140
How is this possible?

3040
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:34,540
What is crab game?

3041
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:37,740
Crab game is a free to play multiplayer game

3042
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:41,900
based on the squid games.

3043
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:44,300
It was me.

3044
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:45,020
Oh, okay.

3045
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:49,820
Yeah, it is possible through even on Australian ping.

3046
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,340
Would I be the server host?

3047
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,700
Your PC will not survive.

3048
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:01,260
The SEC secret lab will be in person.

3049
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:03,820
Splatoon, I'm afraid I've not bought the game.

3050
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:05,820
Apparently it's actually bad for stream sniping.

3051
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:06,620
Sorry, can't see feet.

3052
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:20,220
Very big game not visually demanding in special circumstances.

3053
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:21,740
Crab game would be hilarious.

3054
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:24,780
Factory dev is addicted to optimization, clearly.

3055
02:23:25,580 --> 02:23:26,780
Is SAP free?

3056
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:27,580
I think so.

3057
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:29,340
SAP multiplayer?

3058
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:32,700
Oh wait, would it be free if it's got servers they have to run?

3059
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:36,860
Wait a minute, that makes no sense.

3060
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:41,340
Right.

3061
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:42,380
Are you squiddin' me right now?

3062
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:43,820
I don't know, are you squiddin' me right now?

3063
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:46,940
Parasocial is basically one-sided relationship.

3064
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:47,420
Uh-huh.

3065
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,860
It becomes dangerous when you become too emotionally dependent

3066
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:54,700
and begin thinking the one you want is your special one only.

3067
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:57,820
But then it becomes worse than parasocial.

3068
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:00,300
Basically a negative three tiers above.

3069
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,140
What does that mean?

3070
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:04,460
Thank you anonymous for the tip.

3071
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:10,140
So yeah, that's where I'm worried.

3072
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,060
That's why I'm always like make sure you're having fun

3073
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:13,820
because you know when you're not having fun anymore?

3074
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:15,900
That's when I'm like you're not enjoying yourself.

3075
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:18,700
Like you're just hurting yourself and I don't want you to hurt yourself.

3076
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:21,260
Like I want it to be good fun.

3077
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:24,620
I want it to just be like me mucking about opening up Pokémon cards.

3078
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:26,060
I have no idea how to pull.

3079
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:30,140
Yeah, that kind of thing.

3080
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:33,100
Lamar, she puts her feet on cam like jingle and keys.

3081
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:34,140
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3082
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,460
Gonna redirect into mercy in five hours.

3083
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:38,060
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3084
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:39,420
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3085
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,540
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3086
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:43,900
Five hours.

3087
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,500
Five hours.

3088
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:46,620
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3089
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:48,460
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3090
02:24:52,540 --> 02:24:55,900
But yeah, if you guys are okay, I'm gonna wrap it up.

3091
02:24:56,300 --> 02:25:03,180
Um, can we, uh, we can.

3092
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:04,860
Five hour Yapathon, honestly.

3093
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:08,460
Don't be silly and subject your willy to what you don't like.

3094
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:10,060
The wise words are strony calls.

3095
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:10,780
Absolutely true.

3096
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:11,900
Redirect in five hours.

3097
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:13,100
More like five hours a stream.

3098
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:17,500
No, I need to go off because I'm gonna try and get the ASMR video off.

3099
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:19,260
I'm gonna update my Patreon as well.

3100
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:25,820
I don't know if I can do the caller for all and dog Zemma.

3101
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:31,900
Not to be confused with X-Zema, the spin condition, or Yima, X-Zema.

3102
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:34,780
This is a feet puppet show.

3103
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:40,700
Okay, so this is an innocent little reefling here, and this is me hiding.

3104
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:48,620
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

3105
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:52,140
And the thing is, you can pretend to fight, but you're not gonna win, okay?

3106
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:52,780
I'm too strong.

3107
02:25:57,740 --> 02:26:01,340
No reefling, accept it, accept it, reefling.

3108
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:07,100
Let it happen, reefletch, let it happen.

3109
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:11,820
And then boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

3110
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,860
I'll show you the thunder side.

3111
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:17,260
I fell down on my pants so long.

3112
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:19,260
Who would ask to go?

3113
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:23,420
A real reefling would never fight back.

3114
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:25,180
The struggle.

3115
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,940
Can you rotate strongly like a shark?

3116
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:30,460
I can't show my bottom half.

3117
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,260
It's not allowed.

3118
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:33,820
Don't stop when I pass out.

3119
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:34,620
Oh my god!

3120
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:40,060
Prailing.

3121
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:43,580
Aww.

3122
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:45,420
Love you, mama.

3123
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,300
Love you, mommy.

3124
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:47,500
Love you too, reefling.

3125
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:49,340
Thank you, Prailing, for the tip.

3126
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:49,740
Yay.

3127
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:53,820
I'm asked to come someday.

3128
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:55,260
So can't stream as mommy works.

3129
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:58,940
Do you want that for the membership writing stream?

3130
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:03,900
I could do the membership writing streaming.

3131
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:06,540
It's just a fucking video feed on my feet.

3132
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:07,500
If you want.

3133
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:09,340
I mean, shit, I'm not here to dictate.

3134
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:10,620
Do what you want.

3135
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:15,100
You're allowed to ask for the content you want to see around these parts.

3136
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:17,260
I'm not going to be like, ah, don't backseat game me.

3137
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,780
Ah, don't tell me I want to stream.

3138
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:21,580
No, I'm fine with it.

3139
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,860
I know, I'm being attacked.

3140
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:23,500
Help.

3141
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:23,980
I guess.

3142
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:28,060
I love mommy because she gave me a place to belong.

3143
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:29,340
Oh, that's so sweet.

3144
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:35,980
Strongly Bottom is a WDM weapon of math.

3145
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:38,940
They're bad, Sean.

3146
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,860
My lawyer has advised me to end the drip game.

3147
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:45,180
Now, unlike you, a shark, you immobilize strongy with

3148
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:48,220
wrapping her in a soft blanket and giving her a head pass, and please.

3149
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:49,660
Oh, you put me a bed.

3150
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,380
Are you going to fuck me in?

3151
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:56,460
You can't just tuck me in.

3152
02:27:57,820 --> 02:28:00,140
You have to do the other part too, or it doesn't count.

3153
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:03,660
I'm not into feet.

3154
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:05,180
Do what you're comfortable with.

3155
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:08,940
You're like, oh, please wrap up the fucking feet, strongy.

3156
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:10,220
Jesus, we get it.

3157
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:11,660
You're wearing grippy socks, woman.

3158
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:14,620
Please wrap it up.

3159
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:15,900
I do love good wrap-ups.

3160
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:18,700
I'm going to want you in.

3161
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:20,780
Boko wa ya.

3162
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:25,260
Right, I'll check Marshmallow one more time just to make sure.

3163
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:26,380
Mommy, you're so cute.

3164
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:28,620
Yeah, do you like how I get all excited when I get to do it

3165
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:30,220
and really things, be anything?

3166
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:31,900
Look at that toe spread.

3167
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,780
Oh, my God.

3168
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:33,900
Look at that pinky toe.

3169
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:34,700
Yeah, damn.

3170
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:36,300
Looks like I've webbed feet under those.

3171
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:38,460
I promise you these toes separate.

3172
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:41,660
Yeah, well, Mae, you're so cute today.

3173
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:42,540
Thank you.

3174
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:43,660
Hi, strongy.

3175
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:45,260
I just wanted to say this real quick.

3176
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:46,780
Thank you for your Twitter content.

3177
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:47,820
It is freaking amazing.

3178
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:49,420
I don't know why you sound like Elvis.

3179
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:51,180
Thank you for all the fun streams and everything.

3180
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:51,660
I love you.

3181
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:53,740
I love you too.

3182
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:54,940
I love you too.

3183
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,820
I love you too.

3184
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,380
Oh, yeah.

3185
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:00,940
I don't know why you turned into Elvis there, but you did, okay?

3186
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:02,380
You did.

3187
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:04,380
Hi, strongy.

3188
02:29:04,380 --> 02:29:05,500
Hi, mithan.

3189
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:07,660
I love you with every fiber of my being.

3190
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:10,140
You have quickly became my kami-oshi.

3191
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:10,860
Oh, no.

3192
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:14,060
I feel so nervous when you call me kami-oshi.

3193
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:17,660
I'm like, aren't you disappointed in me?

3194
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:21,340
I was like, could you not pick a little bit better?

3195
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:25,580
You're the most wonderful person I've ever known.

3196
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:27,420
You make us all feel loved and appreciated.

3197
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:29,740
You generally make my day better just with your yapping.

3198
02:29:29,740 --> 02:29:31,500
Yeah, you're like when I do feet puppetin.

3199
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:32,540
Yeah.

3200
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:36,860
I'm proud to be your riefling and call you my kami-oshi.

3201
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:39,100
I will always love you and be here to support you.

3202
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,220
Oh, thank you, riefling.

3203
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,100
I love you too.

3204
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,140
That's so sweet.

3205
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:45,820
Nice screen to open up streams to.

3206
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:47,020
Yeah, I wouldn't do it very.

3207
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:48,380
I would close this.

3208
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:49,260
The stream's over.

3209
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,900
Let me put my feet on your mouth to silence you.

3210
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:55,820
It's okay.

3211
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:56,780
Just let it happen.

3212
02:29:57,420 --> 02:29:58,380
Just let it happen.

3213
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:02,220
Oh, yeah.

3214
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:05,420
There's one more hand cream stream at the end of this week.

3215
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:08,220
And then I believe that's all my hand cam for quite a while.

3216
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:13,100
Let me check my schedule.

3217
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:14,780
I'll let you have my schedule open right now.

3218
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:18,620
I'll put 25 Tenga celebration.

3219
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,660
Soft clay form.

3220
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:20,940
So that's hand cam.

3221
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:22,300
And then it's dragon quest.

3222
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:23,260
Conquer is bad for a day.

3223
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:25,420
That's getting delayed for something else.

3224
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:31,340
I've got a deep rock galactica stream snipe next week.

3225
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,340
Like the next next week.

3226
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:36,220
Star Wars Battlefront campaign's coming up.

3227
02:30:36,220 --> 02:30:37,500
ASMR stream's coming up.

3228
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:40,700
Let me snuggle up to you, ASMR stream.

3229
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:42,220
See how it goes.

3230
02:30:42,220 --> 02:30:43,180
Rock and stone.

3231
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:48,460
That moment when the Bluetooth connects in the car.

3232
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:51,820
You can see what the positive messages do to mama.

3233
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:54,700
Close her toes go wild and erratic.

3234
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:56,860
Yeah, we can see to the adorable mama.

3235
02:30:56,860 --> 02:30:59,260
Wait, my toes reacted to your messages?

3236
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:00,300
Stop.

3237
02:31:00,300 --> 02:31:01,580
Did they actually?

3238
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:01,980
Hold on.

3239
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,580
I'm going to get that shit off the screen.

3240
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:05,740
Did my toes react to your messages?

3241
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:09,020
I'm having pepega.

3242
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:10,140
Thank you, Pete Kling.

3243
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:13,020
No permission for conquer.

3244
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:15,020
No, no, just to delay it for something else.

3245
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:18,060
Did my fucking toes react?

3246
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:19,100
That's embarrassing.

3247
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:20,620
I'm putting them under the cover now.

3248
02:31:20,620 --> 02:31:21,260
What?

3249
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:21,820
Oh my God.

3250
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:26,220
I was like, you got me feeling things and stuff.

3251
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:29,020
That's a fact.

3252
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:30,940
I don't know that.

3253
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:36,460
I've got Left 4 Dead Streamsnip campaign on the 4th of October.

3254
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:39,340
We'll go back to Left 4 Dead.

3255
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:41,740
I think Conker's Bad Friday's getting delayed

3256
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:45,740
and we'll try and wrap up Subnautica on that day.

3257
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,580
I'm just looking.

3258
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:49,900
I'm just straight up leaking the rest of my schedule.

3259
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:51,500
I've got an ASMR maid roleplay.

3260
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:53,260
Professor Layton.

3261
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:54,460
I've got High on Life.

3262
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,740
Never played that.

3263
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:58,540
I've got Baking My Genmates.

3264
02:31:58,540 --> 02:31:59,980
It's coming up in October.

3265
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:01,340
That's probably the next handcam.

3266
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:04,140
But I'm calming it on the handcam for quite a while

3267
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:05,820
because I've had quite a few back-to-back ones.

3268
02:32:07,580 --> 02:32:08,860
Not until I get new nails.

3269
02:32:08,860 --> 02:32:09,340
Okay?

3270
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:10,140
I need new nails.

3271
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:10,940
Her feet timed.

3272
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,580
She covered them.

3273
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:12,460
Am I ruining that?

3274
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:13,100
I don't know.

3275
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:15,420
Are my fucking toes reacting to your messages?

3276
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:17,660
I'm like, oh my God.

3277
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:18,860
That's embarrassing.

3278
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:20,380
You can see me squirm.

3279
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,020
Great for me.

3280
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:24,780
I'm like, a fellow toe spreader?

3281
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:25,740
What have you sent?

3282
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:28,460
Are you sent a fucking video of your feet?

3283
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:31,820
Hold on.

3284
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:34,780
Have you just sent me a video of your feet in Marshmallow?

3285
02:32:36,700 --> 02:32:37,100
All right.

3286
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:44,620
Ruflin, get your dogs off of my screen.

3287
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:46,380
That's hilarious.

3288
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:48,780
I'm like, why is your feet so veiny, though?

3289
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:51,020
Are you a runner?

3290
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:55,020
Why is your feet so pale at the knuckles,

3291
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:56,700
but then you have like blood flow out,

3292
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:58,380
like your ankle and your toe area?

3293
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:03,900
You can't just ask someone that.

3294
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,100
Why are you white?

3295
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:06,780
That's funniest fuck.

3296
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,500
Thank you, Ruflin.

3297
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:08,300
That's hilarious.

3298
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,820
Thank you for showing me your grippers.

3299
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:15,980
It's a vampire vascular guy, I think so.

3300
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:20,220
In her reaction, hmm.

3301
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:20,700
Hi, mom.

3302
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,260
I love you.

3303
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:23,260
I can't wait to see what my technical comes.

3304
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,380
Oh, okay.

3305
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:25,340
Love you too, Ruflin.

3306
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:29,020
Why are you white?

3307
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:29,580
Hi, Johnny.

3308
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:30,700
I just want to send this real quick.

3309
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:35,820
What other stuff?

3310
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:36,780
I'm playing control.

3311
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:38,620
Apparently it's SCP adjacent.

3312
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:43,020
Mines of Moria stream got delayed way at the end of October.

3313
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:46,300
And then I'm going to do a test crowd control stream,

3314
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:48,140
possibly, on Pokemon Emerald.

3315
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:51,340
I don't know how that works, though.

3316
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:54,220
I'm going to have to look into it.

3317
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:58,940
I've got God of War coming up in November.

3318
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:01,260
I've got BioShock Infinite in November.

3319
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:04,940
I've got Mario 64 in November.

3320
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:07,020
Johnny, do you really plan this far ahead?

3321
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:07,260
Yes.

3322
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:09,420
Yeah.

3323
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:12,620
I literally have on the calendar

3324
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:17,180
the May 4th Lego Star Wars Complete Saga.

3325
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:18,860
Like, yes, I plan this far ahead.

3326
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:21,580
And I change things out, okay?

3327
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:23,900
The OG or the new...

3328
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:25,340
Which God of War?

3329
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:29,900
Wait, is it PS PlayStation only?

3330
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:32,780
Yes, if you'll stop me.

3331
02:34:32,940 --> 02:34:33,980
Yes, if you'll stop me.

3332
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:40,460
Is it PS PlayStation only?

3333
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:41,660
That might have to get changed.

3334
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:48,540
The question should be if she's supposed to plan that far ahead?

3335
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:49,740
Oh, I never read that.

3336
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:50,940
No, don't message me that.

3337
02:34:50,940 --> 02:34:52,300
I've never read it in time.

3338
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:54,380
You are a planner.

3339
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:56,540
God of War is on PC.

3340
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:58,300
Okay, that'll be the one I'm playing then.

3341
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,420
The one that's on PC.

3342
02:34:59,420 --> 02:34:59,980
So we're there.

3343
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:04,940
I hope you like Bioshock Infinite.

3344
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:05,260
Yes.

3345
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:07,020
What games are we talking about?

3346
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,140
That's PlayStation exclusive.

3347
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:10,780
I thought there was a God of War game that was PlayStation exclusive.

3348
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:14,220
Look at these feet.

3349
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,300
This is me cricketing.

3350
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:19,340
You ever heard of a woman like,

3351
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:20,780
I'm cricketing my feet.

3352
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:21,260
This is it.

3353
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:23,100
It's literally just a self-soothing behavior.

3354
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:23,980
There's nothing more to it.

3355
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:24,780
And it's a bit warm.

3356
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:27,660
Teasing strong even redacted messages

3357
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,260
because she can't read them in time.

3358
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:31,500
No, it wakes me up.

3359
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,340
I luckily, I caught that.

3360
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:34,220
But oh yeah.

3361
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:36,540
Oh, it really inverts my nipples

3362
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:38,300
when I'm like reading halfway through your message

3363
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:39,020
and then you're done.

3364
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:41,900
I'm like, never got to finish it.

3365
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:44,380
It wasn't me.

3366
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:47,180
Damn, came at the best time.

3367
02:35:47,180 --> 02:35:48,220
The wrap up, yeah.

3368
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:51,260
The original ones are P.O.A. station.

3369
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:51,580
Yeah.

3370
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:53,340
Momay.

3371
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:54,940
Yeah.

3372
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:55,900
Wait, what did I say?

3373
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:57,820
Strony, I love you.

3374
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:58,940
I love you too, this one.

3375
02:35:58,940 --> 02:35:59,420
It what?

3376
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:00,220
Wait, what?

3377
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:01,820
Am I getting, did I say something?

3378
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:05,260
Do you think we could do

3379
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:07,900
Trouble in Terror's Town Gmod Streams

3380
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,260
now if you're the one hosting that?

3381
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:11,180
Possibly.

3382
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:15,020
I'll need to see if it shows IP or anything

3383
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:16,540
like that, but possibly.

3384
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:18,220
I think it's held by Gmod servers.

3385
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:20,540
Oh, my nipples being inverted.

3386
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:21,420
Yes, sorry.

3387
02:36:22,220 --> 02:36:22,860
Sorry.

3388
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:24,780
I said, stop doing redacted.

3389
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,540
I have no clue what users are saying.

3390
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,420
No, I scoopy do.

3391
02:36:28,380 --> 02:36:29,740
Do you want tummy pics?

3392
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:31,100
Am I allowed tummy pics?

3393
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:34,860
Stop, I can't fucking read.

3394
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:36,380
Strony, try not to overthink.

3395
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:38,780
It's because I finished like my thingy

3396
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:41,900
so quickly, like I don't,

3397
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:44,460
I'm already onto the next topic

3398
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:45,660
that I'm talking about

3399
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:50,300
that I've no got a clue what's going on.

3400
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:53,100
Yeah, I've got one more hand cam stream

3401
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:55,180
on October, then I have nothing planned after that.

3402
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:57,020
So if you're sick of seeing me

3403
02:36:57,020 --> 02:36:59,260
and not a Vtuber model,

3404
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:01,500
it's because I did just a lot,

3405
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:02,940
okay, but I'm wrapping it up.

3406
02:37:03,980 --> 02:37:05,020
I'm wrapping up.

3407
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:07,580
Give mommy a head tap.

3408
02:37:07,580 --> 02:37:09,180
Stop with the redacted.

3409
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:10,300
I'm missing them all.

3410
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:11,740
One of the two new God of War games

3411
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:13,260
in the first one is a PC.

3412
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:14,380
I missed that, right?

3413
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:15,340
What is redacted?

3414
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,900
When you delete your message,

3415
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:21,340
it says for me, message retracted.

3416
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:24,700
Oh, those are two different words.

3417
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:27,100
Retracted is take them back.

3418
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:30,220
Redacted is hidden information and adult feeling.

3419
02:37:30,220 --> 02:37:31,020
Okay.

3420
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:34,620
It's not as, stop!

3421
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:36,380
I was just saying that!

3422
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:37,820
Mommy is super sad.

3423
02:37:37,820 --> 02:37:38,540
Thank you.

3424
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:39,980
Redacted is a joke from S.E.C.

3425
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:42,620
about where the S.E.C. writer says,

3426
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:44,060
Shania, I deleted my message

3427
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:46,700
if I make a minor spelling error.

3428
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:47,820
You struggle reading as it is.

3429
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:48,940
I don't want to make it harder.

3430
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:50,140
Okay, real unsure though.

3431
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:52,860
We love to shume regardless with this hand.

3432
02:37:53,500 --> 02:37:55,420
I can't even read.

3433
02:37:56,540 --> 02:37:58,140
See how it even shows up in the hang?

3434
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,460
It just says, it's just gone.

3435
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:01,260
It's just no there.

3436
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:05,260
Wait, before you,

3437
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,460
I wanted to say that I think you're really funny

3438
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:09,180
and you're my ocean.

3439
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:10,380
Well, get right, I get right.

3440
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:12,780
Are you doing okay?

3441
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:14,860
Yeah, they're keeping me for a few more weeks

3442
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:16,300
at the asylum, as you can see,

3443
02:38:16,300 --> 02:38:17,820
by the certified grippy socks.

3444
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:21,260
But no, we had a really good Pokémon haul.

3445
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:21,820
I enjoyed that.

3446
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:23,420
I'm not buying more Pokémon though, fuck that.

3447
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:33,900
Not one, I genuinely haven't had one.

3448
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:37,020
Unless I missed it or it got blocked by the filters,

3449
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:38,140
I generally haven't had one.

3450
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:41,500
Generally haven't had one.

3451
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:44,540
As I was saying, I think I've scared yous all.

3452
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:46,620
Like, I think yous are scared of me

3453
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:48,620
because I don't really get much

3454
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:51,020
hmm and stuff and I'm like,

3455
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:52,220
I think I'm just scared yous.

3456
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:55,100
But then a refland sent me a marshmallow

3457
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:55,820
and they were like,

3458
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:00,060
like, I feel satisfied.

3459
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,380
Like, I don't need to be a tumor anymore.

3460
02:39:02,380 --> 02:39:04,140
I'm just happy he's like watching you

3461
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:05,820
and I'm like, oh, tea.

3462
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:09,260
And I'm like, oh, okay.

3463
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:13,660
Thank you, big belly-ing for the tip.

3464
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:17,100
It's just weird to send that stuff randomly.

3465
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:19,180
Oh, I mean,

3466
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,300
do I need to, I'm down?

3467
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:28,700
Do it real.

3468
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:31,500
He's spitting real facts.

3469
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:33,900
Oh, well someone said that.

3470
02:39:33,900 --> 02:39:35,740
They were like, I used to be a chronic

3471
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:38,940
anchor but I'm not anymore.

3472
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:42,700
And I was like, aren't I the problem though?

3473
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:46,060
Because like, I do like non-stop,

3474
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:49,340
shut the fuck up in about ink and this and teasing and that.

3475
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:50,620
And I'm like, aren't I the problem?

3476
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:53,660
But the refland says no.

3477
02:39:53,660 --> 02:39:54,700
And I'm like, okay.

3478
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:55,820
But aren't I the problem though?

3479
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:56,300
But no.

3480
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:03,260
Mummy, did you know redactors yet?

3481
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:03,820
What?

3482
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:05,500
Don't worry, I'll turn just a minute.

3483
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:08,460
Don't be shy, put some more.

3484
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:10,300
I don't want to be hate, I just want to be happy.

3485
02:40:10,300 --> 02:40:13,180
Yeah, yeah, like basically I think

3486
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:14,460
is what I boil down to.

3487
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:20,220
Hmm, don't send unasked for stuff

3488
02:40:20,220 --> 02:40:21,900
if a thing does get full though.

3489
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:24,220
I guess I'm such an exception to the rule.

3490
02:40:24,220 --> 02:40:27,260
I think actually I want to just do the brainworn stuff a bit more.

3491
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:29,580
I was like, I'm going to be honest,

3492
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:33,340
have you been fucked up by a VTuber before?

3493
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:36,060
Because you're so terrified to like say these things to me

3494
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:37,340
or do things around me.

3495
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:40,620
I'm like, what nasty VTuber had a reaction to you

3496
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:43,260
that was so visceral to make you so cautious?

3497
02:40:43,980 --> 02:40:46,620
Like, was someone nasty to you?

3498
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:48,540
Do I need to go speak to the manager?

3499
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:52,300
Like that's such a shame.

3500
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:56,380
I feel really bad that whenever you interact,

3501
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:57,500
instead of being like,

3502
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,740
oh, strong is like having a hoot and a holler,

3503
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:03,260
you're like, oh my god, I've messed up.

3504
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:04,780
She's going to end up blocking me,

3505
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:05,820
muting me or whatever that.

3506
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:08,300
Like, I assure you I've not muted one motherfucking person.

3507
02:41:08,300 --> 02:41:11,740
I've muted two people on Marshmallow.

3508
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:13,580
One was harassment,

3509
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:17,420
and then the other one was really random racism

3510
02:41:17,420 --> 02:41:18,620
that wasn't even shown at me.

3511
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:20,780
That was a bit bizarre.

3512
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:22,700
I don't know what about, I can't decide for the message.

3513
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:25,180
Not VTubers, but girls.

3514
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:27,500
Most VTubers don't like weird comments.

3515
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:28,860
Oh boy!

3516
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:31,020
You are in for a treat over at your home.

3517
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:32,860
It's not even just online.

3518
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:34,380
It's what we've been taught in Relay.

3519
02:41:36,140 --> 02:41:38,460
I mean, I guess in Relay,

3520
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:40,940
you wouldn't like go up to some random check

3521
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:43,420
and it can be like, hmm, your feet.

3522
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:45,660
But you know, here.

3523
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:47,580
And the gloves are fucking off, okay?

3524
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:48,380
My gloves are off.

3525
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:49,580
Feet!

3526
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:50,300
Hi, DEMPA.

3527
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:51,740
Sorry, we've wrapped up the Pokemon,

3528
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:53,820
but we did play Pokemon for real for real, okay?

3529
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:54,940
Look, it's real.

3530
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:56,540
I promise I opened up Pokemon.

3531
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:57,980
It may not look like it, but yeah.

3532
02:41:59,740 --> 02:42:02,780
I inked DEMPA real once.

3533
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:04,220
I think it's just good manners.

3534
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:05,820
The world has been hard on the phyllis,

3535
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:06,700
darling, you know.

3536
02:42:07,340 --> 02:42:09,180
Culture is told is not to be openly,

3537
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:10,860
hmm.

3538
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:11,820
I guess, yeah.

3539
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,900
No, I do understand that.

3540
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:15,180
I guess that would explain why

3541
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:16,860
some overthinking comes into it,

3542
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:19,580
because I do feel bad when,

3543
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:21,500
like, we have a carry-on on streaming and,

3544
02:42:21,500 --> 02:42:25,580
you know, I'll go brainwrote for a bit

3545
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:26,940
and then I'll check Marshmallow

3546
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:27,900
and it's apologies.

3547
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:29,900
And I'm like, what are you apologizing for?

3548
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:31,340
We're having fun together.

3549
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:33,740
We're playing games together.

3550
02:42:33,740 --> 02:42:34,700
We're chatting.

3551
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:35,900
We're, I'm reading chat.

3552
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:36,940
I'm reading you.

3553
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:38,220
I know there's lurkers,

3554
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:40,620
if you're lurking in the shadow, don't be.

3555
02:42:41,180 --> 02:42:42,620
Don't feel forced to talk,

3556
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:44,140
but, like, I know you're there

3557
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:45,500
and you're just bitching in.

3558
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:46,940
There's a man, I'm bitching in.

3559
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:49,500
Wait, people send apologies?

3560
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:50,220
I kid you not.

3561
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:51,580
People, like, are literally, like,

3562
02:42:51,580 --> 02:42:53,100
strongy, I'm sorry that I did this,

3563
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:53,580
I did that.

3564
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:55,340
And I'm like, oh my God,

3565
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:57,340
like, you've actually been so fucked up

3566
02:42:57,340 --> 02:42:59,100
because of something before.

3567
02:42:59,100 --> 02:42:59,740
Hin Law.

3568
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:00,780
Hi, lurker here.

3569
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:01,980
Hi, lurker.

3570
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:02,940
Lurker Ling.

3571
02:43:02,940 --> 02:43:03,980
We'll call you lurkers.

3572
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:07,260
Um, mm-mm-mm.

3573
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:09,340
But yeah, like, uh, hello, lurker.

3574
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:09,980
Hi.

3575
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:12,620
Oh, you're being brave, little lurkers.

3576
02:43:13,980 --> 02:43:15,500
Are you feeling the pressure?

3577
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:17,420
Did your heart rate go up when you typed?

3578
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,900
Lurker Love.

3579
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:21,580
Yes, I know you're a little lurker.

3580
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:23,500
You're allowed to lurk, it's fine.

3581
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:25,340
Um, I'm not, like, feel the pressure,

3582
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:27,580
like, you must talk or anything like that.

3583
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:29,340
I feel a genuine level of acceptance,

3584
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:30,300
more freedom in a sense.

3585
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:31,820
Brain feels better when I sit in stream,

3586
02:43:31,820 --> 02:43:33,900
whether it's lurking or participating.

3587
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:35,340
We are gentlemen first.

3588
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:36,620
Oh my God, hold on, wait.

3589
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:37,660
Wait, I have the sound bite.

3590
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,740
Oh no, I don't, because it's not popping up.

3591
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:40,700
A true gentleman.

3592
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:44,220
Um, I almost had a heart attack.

3593
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,180
Oh my God, stop!

3594
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:46,460
Wait, am I elevating your stream?

3595
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:48,860
I was a lurker before the stream, yeah.

3596
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,220
No, you're allowed to be lurker.

3597
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:51,820
For any lurker that's, like, I don't,

3598
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:52,780
I'm too scared.

3599
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:54,460
Don't worry, you don't have to,

3600
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:56,940
you don't have to say anything like a true gentleman.

3601
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:58,940
Um, I'm just straight up lurking.

3602
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:01,980
And by it, let's just say my beacher bird.

3603
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:03,420
Okay, that was really good.

3604
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:05,260
You win comment of the stream.

3605
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:08,060
Plop, plop, plop, plop.

3606
02:44:08,060 --> 02:44:09,340
You win comment of the stream.

3607
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,380
That was actually really good.

3608
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:12,380
I'm a gentleman and a scholar,

3609
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:13,660
but I like Dom's one.

3610
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:14,700
Oh, you like Dom me?

3611
02:44:15,820 --> 02:44:18,380
Okay, thankfully I didn't send one.

3612
02:44:18,380 --> 02:44:21,260
I find it very hard sometimes having brain worms in the path

3613
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:22,460
and I felt like sending me apology.

3614
02:44:22,460 --> 02:44:23,260
Good thing I didn't.

3615
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:24,460
No, it's not a bother.

3616
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:26,940
No, don't get brain worms if I haven't brain worms

3617
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:27,740
and apologize.

3618
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:31,980
Don't get brain worms if you've apologized either.

3619
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:33,980
Hold on, pause, pause.

3620
02:44:33,980 --> 02:44:35,660
Don't get brain worms either.

3621
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:37,020
It's okay to apologize,

3622
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:39,420
but what I'm trying to say is you don't like to apologize.

3623
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:41,180
Wait, grug?

3624
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:43,180
Grug like women.

3625
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:44,220
Grug like men in prayer?

3626
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:46,300
Grug as in red?

3627
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:46,620
Grug?

3628
02:44:49,420 --> 02:44:50,380
Red, is that you?

3629
02:44:52,700 --> 02:44:55,660
Thank you, bab, for the tip, my little guru guru.

3630
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:58,380
Oh no, the brain worms have brain worms.

3631
02:44:58,380 --> 02:44:58,700
No.

3632
02:45:02,220 --> 02:45:04,060
Is that red or am I just...

3633
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,220
Brain worms squared?

3634
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:10,700
I feel like if you read more suggestive and you rap positive,

3635
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:12,860
it's all good, but I'm not saying anything wrong with either.

3636
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:14,140
You're too kind, I love you.

3637
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:15,180
I love you, sir, you're fun.

3638
02:45:15,180 --> 02:45:15,660
Oh, hi.

3639
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:17,980
Oh, hi there.

3640
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,660
Oh, should I start calling lurkers out?

3641
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:20,940
No, that puts you on the spot.

3642
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:21,580
That's not fun.

3643
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:26,540
Sometimes it's tough to be a gentleman and a bit on the side.

3644
02:45:26,540 --> 02:45:27,100
Don't worry.

3645
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:32,940
I lurked two weeks before I interacted with you for the first thing

3646
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:35,820
because I want to have a good idea of what it's okay to say to you.

3647
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:38,460
No, I feel like literally I have to be like,

3648
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:42,060
all right, reflins, remember when we go into other people's streams,

3649
02:45:42,060 --> 02:45:43,100
they're not like me.

3650
02:45:45,580 --> 02:45:46,700
Grug as in a caveman.

3651
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:48,860
Ah, okay, okay, I'm mistaken identity.

3652
02:45:48,860 --> 02:45:53,100
My apologies, guru, at the door via a doorbell.

3653
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:56,860
Oh god, now I have to apologize even harder.

3654
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:57,660
No.

3655
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:59,340
You're not to apologize even harder.

3656
02:45:59,340 --> 02:45:59,740
Stop it.

3657
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:04,460
Hey.

3658
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:08,780
Mom, I like to send you an ink tax.

3659
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:10,460
What the fuck?

3660
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:11,100
That's so good.

3661
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:14,140
The ink tax, the ink tax.

3662
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:17,900
Mommy's tried hard, so you better pay the price.

3663
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:20,460
The ink tax, the ink tax.

3664
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:23,900
Mommy's been a tease, so you better call for that.

3665
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:26,300
So anyway, when it comes to talking to you during streams,

3666
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:28,140
I get nervous when talking.

3667
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:31,100
I find you so beautifully attractive and you get nervous.

3668
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:31,420
No.

3669
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:33,900
Are your feet cold?

3670
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:34,860
They actually are.

3671
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:37,340
I'm getting a bit chilly.

3672
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:38,540
I'm getting a bit chilly.

3673
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:39,500
Are you okay?

3674
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:40,380
I'm getting a bit chilly.

3675
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:40,860
Is that cool?

3676
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:44,780
I don't chat often in streams or really post comments.

3677
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:46,780
I felt like the eye of Saruman found me

3678
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:48,220
when you replied to my comment.

3679
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:52,540
Do you have a ring for me?

3680
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:56,220
Do you still have the cherry associated with that ring?

3681
02:46:58,300 --> 02:46:59,500
I really love you all so much.

3682
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:01,580
I'm a lurker, nine times out of 10, but when...

3683
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:03,500
But I talk when I can.

3684
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:04,620
I really love you all so much.

3685
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:06,380
Aw, Riefling.

3686
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:08,300
You guys are super funny and sweet and lovely.

3687
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:09,500
Thanks for having me, Riefling.

3688
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,100
Aw, that was so nice.

3689
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:11,660
Thank you.

3690
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:15,020
Hey, I wonder if she realized she's reacting with her feet again.

3691
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:16,700
Meow.

3692
02:47:19,500 --> 02:47:21,580
No, you can't prove it, okay?

3693
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:24,460
I am the danger.

3694
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:27,260
What if you tell them that they apologize to get punished?

3695
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:28,380
I feel like they'd want that.

3696
02:47:29,340 --> 02:47:32,220
That Riefling experience, the whole body turns up.

3697
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:33,500
Bless all.

3698
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:36,540
Does it make you...

3699
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:38,220
I like when you tell me stories,

3700
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:40,780
like it makes you smile when I read your message.

3701
02:47:40,780 --> 02:47:43,420
I'm like, ah, I can't handle it.

3702
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:44,940
It's so fucking cute.

3703
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:48,620
Like the thought of you cheesing behind your keyboard right now.

3704
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:50,700
Stop being so cute.

3705
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:51,740
I'm gonna do it.

3706
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:53,820
I'm gonna start passing out the R-word.

3707
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:57,180
And like the thought of you cheesing behind your little keyboard

3708
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:59,260
is so cute.

3709
02:47:59,260 --> 02:48:00,700
It's so fucking cute.

3710
02:48:02,380 --> 02:48:04,380
The chat reflects the true word.

3711
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:05,340
Shawnee is so cute.

3712
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:06,940
That's why you start quivering, dimple.

3713
02:48:07,980 --> 02:48:09,180
Cuteness aggression.

3714
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:11,820
I mean, of course, we get happy if you read our message.

3715
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:14,060
We are shy when you do that.

3716
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:17,500
That happens to everyone.

3717
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:18,460
Riefling.

3718
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,580
You stop being so cute.

3719
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:20,860
It happens to me through real.

3720
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:27,020
The amount of dopamine I get when you read my chat message

3721
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:31,340
or when I get a like from you on Twitter since we're flying.

3722
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:33,980
Oh, I don't, I'm really bad at using Twitter.

3723
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:35,100
Actually, I'll tell you what.

3724
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:36,940
I've got a funny Twitter post.

3725
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:38,300
I'm gonna post this in TM.

3726
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:41,900
You better start our wordness then.

3727
02:48:41,900 --> 02:48:43,020
Oh, deals of deals.

3728
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:44,380
Shit, you got me.

3729
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:45,340
You caught me.

3730
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:46,780
All right, line up.

3731
02:48:46,780 --> 02:48:47,500
Line up.

3732
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:48,060
Who's first?

3733
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:52,700
Twitter hate, honestly.

3734
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:54,140
I'm just rubbish actually.

3735
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:57,580
I told the giggle when I got a comment right out there.

3736
02:48:57,580 --> 02:48:58,380
I need squid mirrors though.

3737
02:48:58,380 --> 02:48:59,260
No need for them.

3738
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:02,620
Brain dead VTuber fan.

3739
02:49:02,620 --> 02:49:04,540
You're not brain dead.

3740
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:05,260
You have to be nice.

3741
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:07,420
You need to name yourself positive things.

3742
02:49:07,420 --> 02:49:10,940
You should call yourself two brain cell VTuber fan.

3743
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:11,820
There's your new.

3744
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:14,300
And then you can celebrate each new brain cell yet.

3745
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:15,180
Thank you for coming to member.

3746
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:16,940
Please enjoy your moments.

3747
02:49:16,940 --> 02:49:18,940
Stream went from wholesome to hate to wholesome.

3748
02:49:18,940 --> 02:49:21,260
Yeah, that, yeah.

3749
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:21,980
Not gonna lie.

3750
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:23,820
That stuff kind of happens around here.

3751
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:25,020
Witness me.

3752
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:26,300
Me, me, me, I'm fine.

3753
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:28,860
Brain raw VTuber fan.

3754
02:49:28,860 --> 02:49:31,820
Well, honestly, if you're a member for me, I'll take it.

3755
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,580
Stop redacting your messages.

3756
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:36,380
I sent some letters during dead hours.

3757
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:39,020
I'm so embarrassed to hear you read it on stream.

3758
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:41,500
You get embarrassed, but your marshmallows are anonymous.

3759
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:42,860
I can't even tell.

3760
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:46,300
Sorry for not having sent a marshmallow yet.

3761
02:49:46,300 --> 02:49:47,020
Please forgive me.

3762
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:48,460
No, don't be sorry.

3763
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:50,700
That's, don't, don't be sorry.

3764
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:52,620
Our wordness is gonna start happening if we start.

3765
02:49:52,780 --> 02:49:53,420
Mmm.

3766
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:56,860
You just typed message redacted.

3767
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:58,220
That's not actually been redacted.

3768
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:00,540
Welcome to strongy stream.

3769
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:01,580
If it's your first time.

3770
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:05,020
Hi.

3771
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:07,900
Did I pop your cherry?

3772
02:50:07,900 --> 02:50:08,860
Maybe a little bit.

3773
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:11,660
Little cherry popping today.

3774
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:13,100
If you see me for the first time.

3775
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:14,940
Oh, fuck.

3776
02:50:14,940 --> 02:50:16,060
My ankle's about to crack.

3777
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:16,380
Sorry.

3778
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:19,260
Ah, my ankle's about to crack.

3779
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,380
Sorry, mommy.

3780
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:22,220
I apologize for not giving a fuck.

3781
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:23,420
Yes.

3782
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:25,980
I saw that.

3783
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:27,500
I read yes before you got it.

3784
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:29,260
I'm sorry for that.

3785
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:30,540
Reefling being sorry.

3786
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:30,780
Okay.

3787
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:31,980
Oh, wait.

3788
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:32,540
Hold on.

3789
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:34,860
I'll tell you how I get used to stop saying sorry.

3790
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:39,100
I'll tell you how I'll get used to stop saying sorry.

3791
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:40,940
You already know.

3792
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:44,060
You already know.

3793
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:49,180
I know how I'm gonna, I see one more sorry.

3794
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:52,700
And if I see one more sorry in that chat.

3795
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:54,540
It's getting done.

3796
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:56,700
Please don't.

3797
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:57,580
I'm sorry, mommy.

3798
02:50:57,580 --> 02:50:58,140
Don't do it.

3799
02:50:58,140 --> 02:50:58,700
Don't do it.

3800
02:51:00,220 --> 02:51:00,860
Message.

3801
02:51:00,860 --> 02:51:01,420
Sorry.

3802
02:51:01,420 --> 02:51:02,140
Sorry.

3803
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:02,540
Okay.

3804
02:51:02,540 --> 02:51:03,420
You're getting punished.

3805
02:51:05,180 --> 02:51:06,540
Naughty refling.

3806
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:07,900
Yeah.

3807
02:51:07,900 --> 02:51:09,180
You feel that pressure?

3808
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:11,420
Bad boy.

3809
02:51:11,420 --> 02:51:12,700
You know, bad boy.

3810
02:51:13,980 --> 02:51:14,780
See this?

3811
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:19,100
We're totally punished.

3812
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:20,460
Bad refling.

3813
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:22,460
Don't do it.

3814
02:51:22,460 --> 02:51:23,340
It's too late.

3815
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:24,220
It's too late.

3816
02:51:26,300 --> 02:51:27,500
I'll threaten again.

3817
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:28,620
Look, I'm threatening again.

3818
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,340
No more s's.

3819
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:31,340
Message.

3820
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:31,740
Sorry.

3821
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:32,300
Reduct.

3822
02:51:34,060 --> 02:51:35,340
But what about gen two?

3823
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:38,380
I think we're like what, a month?

3824
02:51:39,420 --> 02:51:39,740
No.

3825
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:43,500
Oh, shit.

3826
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:47,500
I'm gonna be pregnant in less than a month.

3827
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:49,980
Oh my god.

3828
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:51,420
It's the 17th today.

3829
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:54,220
Oh no.

3830
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:54,860
This can't be.

3831
02:51:55,740 --> 02:51:58,860
I'm gonna be pregnant in a fucking month with gen two.

3832
02:51:58,860 --> 02:51:59,100
Shit.

3833
02:52:00,780 --> 02:52:01,100
Shit.

3834
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:06,940
Better get your tentacles ready.

3835
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:09,180
We're gonna need a big load for gen two.

3836
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:12,700
Prepare yourself.

3837
02:52:12,700 --> 02:52:13,020
Yes.

3838
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:14,460
Dying less fast.

3839
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:17,420
No, I need to get pregnant with them.

3840
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:18,540
I need to be pregnant with them.

3841
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:19,900
I'm getting pregnant on my birthday.

3842
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,700
I've got some work to do.

3843
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:26,540
Is that what you're denialings are for?

3844
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:29,500
Do you get a special model?

3845
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:30,780
When I'm pregnant,

3846
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:34,860
you want me to have a special toggle?

3847
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:36,140
I think it would cost a lot.

3848
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:38,460
Uh, I don't know.

3849
02:52:38,460 --> 02:52:39,820
Do you want me to fucking...

3850
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:44,380
Oh, my big swollen belly with my big swollen milkers?

3851
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:46,620
You want a pregnant version of Strawny?

3852
02:52:46,620 --> 02:52:47,180
Jesus.

3853
02:52:49,420 --> 02:52:49,980
Jesus.

3854
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:52,300
Yes.

3855
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:55,900
Is there anyone that's done a prego feature for model?

3856
02:52:57,580 --> 02:52:59,580
I just want you to see where Dune's cuddle.

3857
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:01,820
I'm not gonna do three-deal.

3858
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:03,660
You can't hear when I cuddle this microphone.

3859
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:04,460
It's so annoying.

3860
02:53:04,460 --> 02:53:05,340
I can, like, rub it.

3861
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:07,980
That's gonna scare the new people away.

3862
02:53:07,980 --> 02:53:09,980
Yeah, I think that's probably more of an incident joke.

3863
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:11,020
Yeah, no, pregnant.

3864
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:13,420
Kids, just place the prego barely P&D on top.

3865
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:15,420
Yeah, that's a lot cheaper as well.

3866
02:53:15,420 --> 02:53:15,900
You know what?

3867
02:53:15,900 --> 02:53:16,220
You're right.

3868
02:53:16,220 --> 02:53:17,180
That's a lot cheaper.

3869
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:18,300
Stretch marks, Strawny.

3870
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:20,060
I already have them on my thighs.

3871
02:53:20,060 --> 02:53:24,460
I used to be a plank, and then when puberty hit,

3872
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:28,380
my hips, like, doubled in size overnight.

3873
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:29,660
It was bizarre.

3874
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:30,780
It was truly bizarre.

3875
02:53:30,780 --> 02:53:31,740
So I have, like, stretch...

3876
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:34,140
Like, did they call them tiger stripes or something there?

3877
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:35,660
It's not stretch marks anymore.

3878
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:37,900
But I have them on my thighs and my hips.

3879
02:53:37,900 --> 02:53:38,700
And no, my thighs.

3880
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:39,580
Sorry, my hips.

3881
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:41,420
Hips only.

3882
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:41,740
Brea...

3883
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:43,740
Proof?

3884
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:46,620
Are you not seeing my...

3885
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:48,140
Oh, I don't have a shirt on under there.

3886
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:50,620
Okay, am I going crazy?

3887
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:51,980
Have I never showed you guys my...

3888
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,140
I don't know if you can tell.

3889
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:56,620
Hang on.

3890
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:58,460
I don't know if you can tell, because I'm like...

3891
02:53:58,460 --> 02:53:59,260
Oh, you can't.

3892
02:53:59,260 --> 02:54:00,140
Holy shit, you can't.

3893
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:01,660
Wait, no.

3894
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:04,620
Oh, you can't tell?

3895
02:54:04,620 --> 02:54:05,900
Oh, I look like a plank.

3896
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:07,820
Oh, well, I'm not actually a plank.

3897
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:08,300
It's just...

3898
02:54:08,300 --> 02:54:09,820
It's the bad camera angle, okay?

3899
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,700
I was like, have them on!

3900
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:15,660
You know, kind of go a little bit hip-pitch.

3901
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:17,180
You know, if you've ever been on the alt-wear.

3902
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:18,860
That's a lot of hip-pitch.

3903
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:20,940
You're a plank from the front.

3904
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:21,820
Yeah, there you go.

3905
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:22,300
Plank.

3906
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:22,780
Plank.

3907
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:23,260
Plank.

3908
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:26,060
I can't find my glasses.

3909
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:28,460
Hips for birthing veal or generations, literally.

3910
02:54:29,420 --> 02:54:31,420
You edit it out of the picture.

3911
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,140
My hips?

3912
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:35,340
I smooth my skin.

3913
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:37,420
I don't have nice skin.

3914
02:54:37,420 --> 02:54:38,220
Like, I have skin.

3915
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:40,540
Smooth the skin in my face, but I don't...

3916
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:43,020
Oh, the marks!

3917
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:43,980
Yeah, I edit the marks.

3918
02:54:43,980 --> 02:54:44,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3919
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:45,100
The skin.

3920
02:54:45,100 --> 02:54:45,980
I fix the skin.

3921
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,740
Try to remove everything.

3922
02:54:50,620 --> 02:54:51,420
Birthing hips.

3923
02:54:51,980 --> 02:54:53,020
Stony's personality.

3924
02:54:53,020 --> 02:54:53,900
Breeding bros win.

3925
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:00,620
She has normal skin.

3926
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:01,340
The shock and horror.

3927
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:02,060
I know.

3928
02:55:02,060 --> 02:55:02,700
It's terrible.

3929
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:05,580
Mummy, when you read my messages or when you, like,

3930
02:55:05,580 --> 02:55:07,260
my art or, like, my tweet, I get embarrassed

3931
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:08,700
and I get butterflies in blood.

3932
02:55:08,700 --> 02:55:09,900
I, like, run around my room and jump.

3933
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:11,020
Stop!

3934
02:55:11,020 --> 02:55:12,060
That's so cute!

3935
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:14,140
Oh, my God.

3936
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:18,860
God, I want Stony to just grab me and drag me

3937
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:21,900
while I hyperventilate and grab for the furniture

3938
02:55:21,900 --> 02:55:24,460
and walls while she takes me into a small dark room

3939
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:28,300
and all that is heard is muffled moans and wallbangs?

3940
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:34,940
Reeflyn, you have a very specific intro, don't you?

3941
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:36,700
We're on to you.

3942
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:38,620
You have a very specific intro.

3943
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:40,300
Yeah, no.

3944
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:42,300
Mmm.

3945
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:43,520
Mmm.

3946
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:45,820
Mummy, I love when you read my marrows.

3947
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:46,780
I sent all of them.

3948
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:48,860
Am I getting one reflinged here?

3949
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:50,460
Mmm.

3950
02:55:52,300 --> 02:55:53,420
Hey, Stony.

3951
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:54,620
Hi, Reeflyn.

3952
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:56,380
Today, I went to Costco.

3953
02:55:56,380 --> 02:55:57,740
It may not seem like a huge deal,

3954
02:55:57,740 --> 02:55:59,900
but I normally get really anxious when going there

3955
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:00,620
and it's busy.

3956
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:02,700
Ah, I hate when it's busy as well.

3957
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:04,380
There's always a lot of people and I get overwhelmed,

3958
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:06,700
however, after I talked to you, even the little bit

3959
02:56:06,700 --> 02:56:08,220
that I did, I was able to keep it together

3960
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,060
and not have to leave early this time.

3961
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:11,900
I thought back to how nervous I was talking to you,

3962
02:56:11,900 --> 02:56:14,220
but how worth it it was to say I love you and it helped me.

3963
02:56:14,220 --> 02:56:15,260
And thank you so much.

3964
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:16,300
Oh, Reeflyn!

3965
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:17,100
What the fuck?

3966
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:18,060
That's amazing.

3967
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:21,340
I'm glad you got your little cost...

3968
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:22,940
Oh, Costco!

3969
02:56:22,940 --> 02:56:24,700
Wait, Costco's a supermarket.

3970
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:26,460
That's so good.

3971
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:27,660
Love you too, little Reeflyn.

3972
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:28,700
I'm so glad.

3973
02:56:29,900 --> 02:56:31,900
See, it was in you all along though.

3974
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:34,940
You have to celebrate your victories.

3975
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,740
And that wasn't me.

3976
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:37,020
I wasn't in the shop way.

3977
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:37,660
That was you.

3978
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:38,220
You did that.

3979
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:39,500
You were doing fantastic.

3980
02:56:39,740 --> 02:56:42,220
And that was you.

3981
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:43,580
I cannot read that fast.

3982
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:44,060
I saw that.

3983
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:45,100
I cannot read that fast.

3984
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:46,380
That was like a fucking essay and a half

3985
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:47,340
in the corner of my eye.

3986
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:48,620
I cannot read that fast.

3987
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:50,540
We're a figment of strong ease of imagination.

3988
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:51,260
You better not be.

3989
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:52,940
Either I'm going to be pregnant next month or not.

3990
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:56,060
Take responsibility.

3991
02:56:56,780 --> 02:56:57,260
All right.

3992
02:56:58,220 --> 02:57:00,860
If you're not rapping it, take responsibility.

3993
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:03,100
Meeting me pre...

3994
02:57:03,100 --> 02:57:03,660
Six!

3995
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:05,180
I was pregnant with five.

3996
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,140
Now I'm pregnant with six.

3997
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:07,900
I can't read that fast either when I'm talking.

3998
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:11,500
I fantasise about not being each other aggressively

3999
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:12,940
while we exercise.

4000
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:15,260
One, two, three, four.

4001
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:17,980
That's basically if we're working out.

4002
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:19,420
That's how it's going to sound for me.

4003
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:21,740
Remember buying stuff in Costco during the pandemic?

4004
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:26,220
Have to pay child support through working on the farm.

4005
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:27,020
Yeah, working.

4006
02:57:27,740 --> 02:57:28,380
Working.

4007
02:57:28,380 --> 02:57:31,180
I'm sure we'll be harvesting anything from you on the farm.

4008
02:57:33,340 --> 02:57:35,420
Everyone help for sins, mum and gen two.

4009
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:36,860
Yes.

4010
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:40,540
If we keep apologising, do we get grape time?

4011
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:40,940
Oh no.

4012
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:50,140
Nice zorks, yeah.

4013
02:57:50,940 --> 02:57:52,540
You're like the mental asylum.

4014
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:55,500
That's the replete Alice Madness return.

4015
02:57:58,140 --> 02:58:00,060
This would be the first time I actually would.

4016
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,180
So hesitation.

4017
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:03,980
Can we have a shotgun wedding after a prequel?

4018
02:58:04,780 --> 02:58:06,460
Oh my god, do you want to do that?

4019
02:58:06,540 --> 02:58:07,340
A little wedding rules.

4020
02:58:08,780 --> 02:58:10,220
I need to figure out how to use both.

4021
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:15,420
Both is how people have like outfits that their head is like a head is still on it.

4022
02:58:16,940 --> 02:58:18,860
I don't know how to put a wedding dress on me.

4023
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:22,220
It's going to have to be wed and dress PNG.

4024
02:58:22,220 --> 02:58:22,700
I'm sorry.

4025
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:27,180
We're going to have to consummate the marriage as well.

4026
02:58:27,180 --> 02:58:27,820
Just so you know.

4027
02:58:29,020 --> 02:58:31,180
Just so you know, we're going to have to consummate the marriage on that

4028
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:32,620
after the ASMR wedding.

4029
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:32,940
So.

4030
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:38,300
Mom, I tend to lurk for weeks because feeling comfortable commenting and live chats.

4031
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:41,340
Some communities can put you all for hostile but your community is so friendly,

4032
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:42,540
so comfortable typing stuff.

4033
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:44,060
Oh, I'm so glad.

4034
02:58:44,860 --> 02:58:46,060
We've still got stinkings.

4035
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:46,940
She knows right?

4036
02:58:46,940 --> 02:58:48,300
She can teach you.

4037
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:49,660
I don't want to be a bother.

4038
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:55,100
Shotgun wedding, hopefully, since one is hell.

4039
02:58:55,100 --> 02:58:55,900
Yee-haw!

4040
02:58:56,780 --> 02:58:58,140
That would murder me in real life.

4041
02:58:58,140 --> 02:58:58,700
Worth it.

4042
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:01,500
We should get married before gen three.

4043
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:04,460
So when we consummate your prego with gen three?

4044
02:59:05,100 --> 02:59:06,060
I don't know.

4045
02:59:06,060 --> 02:59:06,700
Oh wait, no.

4046
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:07,900
Because that's speedrunning.

4047
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:08,300
No.

4048
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:09,420
I need a not...

4049
02:59:09,420 --> 02:59:10,140
Bruh.

4050
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:10,460
This...

4051
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:12,620
The tank needs to be empty, okay?

4052
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:14,140
Morning, Scottish mummies.

4053
02:59:14,140 --> 02:59:15,340
Good morning, this one.

4054
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:19,420
Thank you for the stream today.

4055
02:59:19,420 --> 02:59:20,300
Did you enjoy it?

4056
02:59:20,300 --> 02:59:21,580
Even though it's just me going...

4057
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:24,540
Oh, I was supposed to wrap up like 30 minutes ago.

4058
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:25,020
I'm weak.

4059
02:59:26,940 --> 02:59:27,500
Hi, mummet.

4060
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:29,100
I don't know how much to say except a miss.

4061
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:29,820
Oh, I love you.

4062
02:59:29,820 --> 02:59:30,300
Many kisses.

4063
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:30,700
Many kisses.

4064
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:36,940
Hey, mummet.

4065
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:41,100
Your streams have been quite some freedom for me.

4066
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:42,300
Freedom, you say?

4067
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:43,580
For the Scottish VTuber?

4068
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:46,540
It's a given around these parts.

4069
02:59:47,100 --> 02:59:49,260
Big Willy Wallace didn't die for nothing.

4070
02:59:49,820 --> 02:59:52,220
Freedom around for the Scottish VTuber.

4071
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:56,460
I have quite the perverse mind, isn't it?

4072
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:58,860
But I've been flamed by VTubers and communities before.

4073
02:59:59,420 --> 03:00:03,740
And I kind of ganged up with hate mail because of it.

4074
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:04,540
Somewhere bad.

4075
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:08,540
So your streams have been quite enjoyment for me and for Incan

4076
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:10,540
and just having fun and positivity in my brain.

4077
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:11,340
Thank you for being here.

4078
03:00:12,380 --> 03:00:14,060
Thank you for being here.

4079
03:00:14,060 --> 03:00:18,220
I hope in the future I get a girlfriend who has your mindset and personality.

4080
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:18,940
I assure you.

4081
03:00:20,220 --> 03:00:21,100
I ain't the only one...

4082
03:00:22,060 --> 03:00:23,900
I'm not the only one built like this.

4083
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:27,660
You need autism, ADHD and an accent.

4084
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:28,140
And there you go.

4085
03:00:28,140 --> 03:00:28,700
Boom.

4086
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:29,980
And that's it.

4087
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:30,620
That's all you need.

4088
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:34,220
So a little bit of microplastics on the brain to cause the autism

4089
03:00:35,420 --> 03:00:38,540
and the ADHD and the rest is good to go.

4090
03:00:40,220 --> 03:00:41,580
Good to go.

4091
03:00:42,140 --> 03:00:42,540
Okay.

4092
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:48,140
Wedding is part of the doughnathon right before the first blue site stream.

4093
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:50,380
Oh, hold on a minute.

4094
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:57,420
Wedding is part of the doughnathon and then consummation.

4095
03:00:58,700 --> 03:00:59,200
Hmm.

4096
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:00,560
Hmm.

4097
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:02,700
Hmm.

4098
03:01:02,700 --> 03:01:04,380
Now we're playing 4D chess.

4099
03:01:06,460 --> 03:01:07,500
I'm playing checkers.

4100
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:10,220
You're playing chess right now cause hmm.

4101
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:11,420
No, hold on.

4102
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,380
Let that man speak.

4103
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:13,260
Let that man speak.

4104
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:17,260
The first blue site could be the honeymoon.

4105
03:01:17,260 --> 03:01:20,140
I think that would actually be very nice.

4106
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:21,660
I'm not sure about you.

4107
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:24,380
Mummy, when you read my marshmallow just hid better in my phone.

4108
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:26,380
Are you cheesing?

4109
03:01:27,340 --> 03:01:30,380
I don't have a fetish but your feet and socks are cute.

4110
03:01:30,380 --> 03:01:31,020
Thank you.

4111
03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:32,620
I got them from the mental fund.

4112
03:01:33,580 --> 03:01:34,860
Mummy, can I ink today?

4113
03:01:36,060 --> 03:01:36,940
Are you being denied?

4114
03:01:36,940 --> 03:01:37,660
Are you trying to skip?

4115
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:39,600
Hmm.

4116
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:41,340
From a lurker.

4117
03:01:41,340 --> 03:01:41,820
I love you.

4118
03:01:41,820 --> 03:01:43,660
I love you too, little lurkerling.

4119
03:01:43,660 --> 03:01:44,620
You're so cute.

4120
03:01:46,300 --> 03:01:50,860
Do you smell what the rooflings are cooking?

4121
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:52,940
Sounds really cute.

4122
03:01:53,660 --> 03:01:54,860
Hmm.

4123
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:55,420
Hi, Strony.

4124
03:01:55,420 --> 03:01:57,740
Sometimes I pitch a tent when you do those fake tears in them.

4125
03:01:58,460 --> 03:01:59,260
What are you talking about?

4126
03:01:59,260 --> 03:02:00,060
I'm just stretching.

4127
03:02:02,060 --> 03:02:02,560
Ah.

4128
03:02:03,500 --> 03:02:04,540
Ah.

4129
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:05,420
Just stretching.

4130
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:07,760
Yep.

4131
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:13,900
Nice hooves.

4132
03:02:13,900 --> 03:02:15,180
Yeah, you like that.

4133
03:02:15,180 --> 03:02:17,180
No.

4134
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,540
Your marshmallows go eh.

4135
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:24,620
I'm at four minutes ago.

4136
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:25,820
This is a double sentence.

4137
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:27,820
I don't know if I got caught if you did then ignore.

4138
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:28,700
Thank you for everything.

4139
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:32,300
Even though I have Enrily friends,

4140
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:33,980
I don't have much in common with them.

4141
03:02:33,980 --> 03:02:34,780
Oh my God, I felt that.

4142
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:40,220
So I still feel a bit lonely not to mention that I'm 26.

4143
03:02:40,220 --> 03:02:41,740
And oh, Jesus.

4144
03:02:41,740 --> 03:02:43,500
I have yet to have a girlfriend.

4145
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:46,300
Veiler has been a massive help for my mental state.

4146
03:02:46,300 --> 03:02:46,860
I didn't really...

4147
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:49,900
Wait a minute, you have cherries, don't you?

4148
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:53,820
I didn't really watch streamers before,

4149
03:02:53,820 --> 03:02:55,340
but the girls are giving me nothing but joy.

4150
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:57,580
And it's not just the girls.

4151
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:59,260
Sorry, I'm reading a lot of English here.

4152
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:01,580
Being a part of the community of like-minded,

4153
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:05,260
independent jewels have finally given me a sense of belonging,

4154
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:06,540
especially during the Overwatch stream.

4155
03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:09,580
Dropping around with you, chat, and the other guys in the lobby

4156
03:03:09,580 --> 03:03:11,420
has made me the happiest I've been in quite a while.

4157
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:12,620
So again, I can't thank you enough.

4158
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:13,740
Honestly, I'm saddened a little bit.

4159
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,100
I'll never be able to repay you.

4160
03:03:15,100 --> 03:03:16,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4161
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:19,100
You don't understand.

4162
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:22,060
I will never be able to repay...

4163
03:03:22,060 --> 03:03:23,580
Wait, 26 is that what you said?

4164
03:03:23,580 --> 03:03:24,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

4165
03:03:24,860 --> 03:03:25,660
I'm sorry.

4166
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:27,980
No, I don't...

4167
03:03:27,980 --> 03:03:29,900
Aren't most reeflings 30 plus?

4168
03:03:29,900 --> 03:03:30,700
Oh, he is!

4169
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:31,660
Oh, that's kind of hot.

4170
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:37,420
You're over 30 and you're letting me control your ink.

4171
03:03:38,540 --> 03:03:39,340
Oh, that's hot.

4172
03:03:44,620 --> 03:03:46,700
You're letting me be in control.

4173
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:49,500
Oh, my God.

4174
03:03:52,220 --> 03:03:54,060
Oh, my God.

4175
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:55,980
You're letting little old me,

4176
03:03:57,020 --> 03:03:59,340
a little five foot three tiny,

4177
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:02,220
wainy little Spironee control your ink.

4178
03:04:04,140 --> 03:04:04,700
Shocking.

4179
03:04:06,140 --> 03:04:06,780
I'm 40.

4180
03:04:06,780 --> 03:04:08,060
What does that mean?

4181
03:04:08,060 --> 03:04:09,580
You have bloody good taste.

4182
03:04:10,220 --> 03:04:11,180
Oh, my God.

4183
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:11,980
That's so good.

4184
03:04:12,940 --> 03:04:15,500
She didn't know a big part is 30 plus.

4185
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:16,300
I guess not.

4186
03:04:17,100 --> 03:04:19,580
32, 28, 20.

4187
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:22,540
Plenty of cherries on you.

4188
03:04:24,940 --> 03:04:26,860
I could smell the cherries on you.

4189
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:29,740
I just turned 25 though.

4190
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:30,300
Okay.

4191
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:31,820
Because you're idly gonna...

4192
03:04:31,820 --> 03:04:33,820
Because you're idly this when I tell you my age.

4193
03:04:34,940 --> 03:04:36,860
We need to do a reefling demographic.

4194
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:39,100
Where are my other...

4195
03:04:39,100 --> 03:04:40,460
I'm 23.

4196
03:04:40,460 --> 03:04:41,500
Where am I 24?

4197
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:44,380
I can smell you.

4198
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:47,580
How old do you think the youngest person here is?

4199
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:47,980
18.

4200
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:52,620
No one else under is allowed to watch our advice system.

4201
03:04:53,340 --> 03:04:54,140
We do not accept.

4202
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:56,460
36.

4203
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:58,620
The little spike ball.

4204
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:00,540
Goddamn.

4205
03:05:01,660 --> 03:05:03,260
The real chair, boyhunter.

4206
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:04,700
Pull it.

4207
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:05,980
What?

4208
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:07,100
Like the average...

4209
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:07,580
Hold on.

4210
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:08,620
Wait, I can't do a pull.

4211
03:05:09,660 --> 03:05:10,220
Oh, my God.

4212
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:12,220
I'm supposed to be working right now,

4213
03:05:12,220 --> 03:05:13,820
but I like talking to you too much.

4214
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:16,140
Age range.

4215
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:19,100
Okay, add option.

4216
03:05:19,100 --> 03:05:21,180
Let's do 18 to...

4217
03:05:23,180 --> 03:05:23,900
24.

4218
03:05:25,580 --> 03:05:27,660
25 to 30.

4219
03:05:28,460 --> 03:05:31,900
31 to 35.

4220
03:05:32,780 --> 03:05:34,620
And then 36 plus.

4221
03:05:34,620 --> 03:05:35,900
And then true will do some.

4222
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:41,820
That's probably not how I was supposed to do it,

4223
03:05:41,820 --> 03:05:42,940
but this is anonymous.

4224
03:05:43,020 --> 03:05:44,940
Like, it's not a thing that you sell out.

4225
03:05:44,940 --> 03:05:45,580
Do you see it?

4226
03:05:49,660 --> 03:05:50,780
Wait, did I do it wrong?

4227
03:05:50,780 --> 03:05:52,940
Are there any other reasons that are also from someone?

4228
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:54,540
36 plus dang.

4229
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:55,980
Real OG-san.

4230
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:57,020
True OG-san.

4231
03:05:57,020 --> 03:05:58,540
Get their category.

4232
03:05:58,540 --> 03:06:00,940
I mean, fucking look at me though.

4233
03:06:00,940 --> 03:06:03,260
Like, I'm not being weird or funny,

4234
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:05,420
but like, I'm not being funny.

4235
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:08,700
Gomenasori, if you don't like seeing,

4236
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:12,860
you're letting me control your anger.

4237
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:13,740
Look at me.

4238
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:17,420
Do you understand how hot that is?

4239
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:18,140
I mean, shit.

4240
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:21,660
This is the size of a Pokemon card in my hand.

4241
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:25,100
And you're letting me control you?

4242
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:27,100
Come on, that's fucking hot.

4243
03:06:27,100 --> 03:06:28,780
I don't care what anyone says.

4244
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:30,140
I don't care what anyone says.

4245
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:32,540
That is...

4246
03:06:33,900 --> 03:06:35,180
That's each word.

4247
03:06:35,180 --> 03:06:36,300
I don't care what anyone says.

4248
03:06:36,860 --> 03:06:38,140
I mean, look at me.

4249
03:06:38,140 --> 03:06:39,180
I write a bake.

4250
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:40,380
Like, fuck, and you're letting me...

4251
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:42,780
I'm a cyclist.

4252
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:45,660
I'm the lowest of the lowest scum, okay?

4253
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:50,620
You knew that?

4254
03:06:50,620 --> 03:06:50,940
Okay.

4255
03:06:52,380 --> 03:06:53,260
What can I say?

4256
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:54,060
I like your stat.

4257
03:06:54,060 --> 03:06:56,220
I like your funny words, Scottish lady.

4258
03:06:57,100 --> 03:06:59,100
Your hands are like half as big as mine.

4259
03:06:59,100 --> 03:07:00,540
This is very plausible.

4260
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:03,420
Apparently I have very tiny hands in comparison to you guys, so...

4261
03:07:05,980 --> 03:07:07,420
Oh my god, it says my name,

4262
03:07:07,420 --> 03:07:09,900
my blood type, and social security after voting.

4263
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:12,220
I'm coming to your house now, got ya.

4264
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:14,700
Okay.

4265
03:07:14,700 --> 03:07:15,660
Nah, you guys are...

4266
03:07:15,660 --> 03:07:18,380
Yeah, you guys are getting my ages.

4267
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:19,420
She's a cyclist.

4268
03:07:19,420 --> 03:07:22,540
Waterboard her with McDonald's spray, real.

4269
03:07:22,540 --> 03:07:25,100
We just love you, Momela, you too, you son.

4270
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:27,020
Keep going on.

4271
03:07:27,020 --> 03:07:28,460
Like, a bake cyclist?

4272
03:07:28,460 --> 03:07:32,940
I cycle all the time, shoulder to shoulder, with semis.

4273
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:36,620
You've got a semi, you say?

4274
03:07:36,620 --> 03:07:39,180
Sorry, you're being very serious with that sentence.

4275
03:07:39,580 --> 03:07:43,980
I cycle on the pavements, which actually is illegal,

4276
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:45,580
because I could hit a pedestrian,

4277
03:07:45,580 --> 03:07:47,980
but I don't want to go on the road,

4278
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:49,900
because I don't want to get ran over by a car team.

4279
03:07:53,980 --> 03:07:57,740
Yeah, I'm a 36-year-old man who owns the house and has a job,

4280
03:07:57,740 --> 03:07:59,020
and I'm on the other side of the road.

4281
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:00,620
Please control my ink, it's all for you.

4282
03:08:00,620 --> 03:08:01,420
Fuck!

4283
03:08:01,980 --> 03:08:03,180
That's crazy!

4284
03:08:05,100 --> 03:08:06,060
But in a good way.

4285
03:08:06,700 --> 03:08:07,500
No one did.

4286
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:10,380
Mmm.

4287
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:12,140
Hello, I'm the 26-year-old reflin.

4288
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:16,460
Yes, I still have every single chair you want it.

4289
03:08:16,460 --> 03:08:17,260
Please!

4290
03:08:17,260 --> 03:08:19,740
Oh my god, I need to do a fucking meta roleplay right now.

4291
03:08:19,740 --> 03:08:21,900
You can't bike on the sidewalk on the pavement,

4292
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:24,300
like, where people walk, isn't it not?

4293
03:08:24,300 --> 03:08:25,660
In Scotland, it's illegal,

4294
03:08:25,660 --> 03:08:27,500
but the police never told me off for it.

4295
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:29,260
Like, the police used to see me a lot.

4296
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:30,780
Oh my fucking god.

4297
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:35,180
I used to see the same fucking egg to Polish men,

4298
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:36,620
like, day in, day out,

4299
03:08:37,420 --> 03:08:38,620
and they'd always look at me,

4300
03:08:38,620 --> 03:08:39,420
and I'd always be like,

4301
03:08:39,420 --> 03:08:40,860
oh, you fuck, they're gonna say something,

4302
03:08:40,860 --> 03:08:43,100
because it's like, you're not supposed to be on the pavement,

4303
03:08:43,100 --> 03:08:45,340
or you'll get, like, because you can hurt someone.

4304
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:47,500
Evos, thank you for becoming a member.

4305
03:08:47,500 --> 03:08:49,020
Please enjoy the emotes,

4306
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:50,140
and thank you for the support.

4307
03:08:50,140 --> 03:08:51,340
Sorry, it's a bit fluff on my leg.

4308
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:57,420
But I look very visually quite young in real life,

4309
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:58,860
like, not on camera or whatever.

4310
03:09:00,220 --> 03:09:01,740
Visually, I look quite young,

4311
03:09:01,740 --> 03:09:04,220
and I think that's why the police never said nothing to me,

4312
03:09:04,220 --> 03:09:05,260
because they were always like,

4313
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:07,020
oh, she's like a teenager,

4314
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:09,260
she's like still at high school and that kind of thing.

4315
03:09:10,060 --> 03:09:12,060
To polis, the polis.

4316
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:14,460
Polis men, policemen, polis.

4317
03:09:15,180 --> 03:09:16,060
A Shawnee gremlin.

4318
03:09:16,780 --> 03:09:18,460
They have home, two cars,

4319
03:09:18,460 --> 03:09:19,340
and live across the world.

4320
03:09:19,340 --> 03:09:20,700
I always let you control my anger.

4321
03:09:20,700 --> 03:09:21,500
Damn!

4322
03:09:23,260 --> 03:09:25,740
I'm not sure how much you're controlling for the priority.

4323
03:09:27,180 --> 03:09:27,900
Polis.

4324
03:09:27,900 --> 03:09:30,140
All right, and so it's not a police in Scotland,

4325
03:09:30,140 --> 03:09:31,660
it's the polis that are at the door,

4326
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:33,020
like, oh, the polis out here.

4327
03:09:34,060 --> 03:09:34,940
You didn't really get,

4328
03:09:35,660 --> 03:09:37,180
it's quite common to get, like,

4329
03:09:37,180 --> 03:09:38,780
randomly spanked by the police,

4330
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:39,820
so don't be too worried

4331
03:09:39,820 --> 03:09:41,500
as opposed to show up at your door.

4332
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:43,740
I'm out of cherries.

4333
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:44,860
Oh, no, no, no, no.

4334
03:09:44,860 --> 03:09:46,380
On the contrary, Riflin,

4335
03:09:46,380 --> 03:09:48,540
I'm sure I can spawn in a few more for you.

4336
03:09:50,460 --> 03:09:54,140
I'm sure there's a few first times I can have with you.

4337
03:09:54,140 --> 03:09:55,820
I'm sure, but don't you worry.

4338
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:56,460
Don't you worry.

4339
03:09:58,060 --> 03:09:59,260
I thought you said polis, no.

4340
03:09:59,260 --> 03:10:00,300
Not polska.

4341
03:10:00,300 --> 03:10:01,660
Nie, nie polska.

4342
03:10:02,460 --> 03:10:03,580
Pokaż syski?

4343
03:10:04,540 --> 03:10:05,420
Is that why I'm not?

4344
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:07,420
No polska today.

4345
03:10:08,700 --> 03:10:09,660
Hi, Mummy.

4346
03:10:09,660 --> 03:10:11,580
De-nailing here?

4347
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:15,580
Oh, denial-ing here?

4348
03:10:15,580 --> 03:10:17,100
I edged too much.

4349
03:10:18,460 --> 03:10:19,980
And opted to ruin it.

4350
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:21,420
Your audience is too hot and awful.

4351
03:10:23,660 --> 03:10:24,460
Oh, my God.

4352
03:10:24,460 --> 03:10:24,780
What?

4353
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:25,340
How many?

4354
03:10:25,340 --> 03:10:26,220
Well, how long was your...

4355
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:26,940
Oh, we need to deal.

4356
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:28,940
I'll deal with, I'll deal with you

4357
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:30,140
in the membership stream.

4358
03:10:30,300 --> 03:10:31,260
Thank you very much.

4359
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:34,860
Can we pull a new audio for Patreon?

4360
03:10:34,860 --> 03:10:36,460
Um, there's a membership stream

4361
03:10:36,460 --> 03:10:37,420
that we're writing this week

4362
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:38,700
for what you want,

4363
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:40,460
but in November,

4364
03:10:40,460 --> 03:10:42,220
all Patreon contents

4365
03:10:42,780 --> 03:10:44,380
becomes what you guys

4366
03:10:44,380 --> 03:10:45,420
want me to write with you.

4367
03:10:47,340 --> 03:10:48,860
32 owns a house and a job,

4368
03:10:48,860 --> 03:10:50,460
and you stream the moment I go off work.

4369
03:10:50,460 --> 03:10:52,060
So having someone control me

4370
03:10:52,060 --> 03:10:53,020
after a tiny day

4371
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:54,700
is an extraordinary feeling.

4372
03:10:54,700 --> 03:10:56,140
Oh, does it give you relief?

4373
03:10:56,140 --> 03:10:57,740
But in more ways than one.

4374
03:10:57,900 --> 03:11:01,820
Anyone want to buy Pokemon?

4375
03:11:01,820 --> 03:11:03,420
Collector's binder?

4376
03:11:04,460 --> 03:11:06,540
We got scum as with our binder, okay?

4377
03:11:07,660 --> 03:11:08,700
Yeah, we got scum as.

4378
03:11:09,580 --> 03:11:10,380
So many.

4379
03:11:10,380 --> 03:11:11,660
Sorry if this is a repeater

4380
03:11:11,660 --> 03:11:12,300
I got eaten.

4381
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:13,820
Here's my gripper video.

4382
03:11:13,820 --> 03:11:14,460
Are you...

4383
03:11:14,460 --> 03:11:17,340
You sent a video of your feet moving?

4384
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:20,380
As opposed to not moving.

4385
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:22,380
Oh, my gosh.

4386
03:11:22,380 --> 03:11:24,460
I'm about to see your freaking feet on my...

4387
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:25,820
I swear if you are...

4388
03:11:26,780 --> 03:11:28,620
And I open up this marshmallow.

4389
03:11:28,620 --> 03:11:30,540
I'm not opening up marshmallows on stream again.

4390
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:34,300
Are you talking?

4391
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:35,820
No, he's just moving his feet.

4392
03:11:35,820 --> 03:11:37,500
You're in your boxers!

4393
03:11:38,220 --> 03:11:39,980
Okay, I didn't see a pizza.

4394
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:41,740
Wait, his feet are so pale.

4395
03:11:41,740 --> 03:11:42,860
What the fuck?

4396
03:11:42,860 --> 03:11:43,980
Why are they so pale?

4397
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:44,940
Why are you white?

4398
03:11:46,540 --> 03:11:48,060
Okay, I think he's in his boxers.

4399
03:11:48,060 --> 03:11:49,580
Wait, who's in their boxers?

4400
03:11:49,580 --> 03:11:50,300
Hold on a minute.

4401
03:11:50,300 --> 03:11:51,900
Are you all in your boxers right now?

4402
03:11:52,540 --> 03:11:53,740
Hold on a minute.

4403
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:55,980
Wait a minute.

4404
03:11:57,740 --> 03:11:58,620
Wait a minute.

4405
03:12:00,940 --> 03:12:01,260
Who?

4406
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:04,540
Who's not wearing anything right now?

4407
03:12:05,660 --> 03:12:07,100
She knows?

4408
03:12:07,100 --> 03:12:08,540
I mean, it's easier access.

4409
03:12:14,220 --> 03:12:15,820
Oh, you guys are wearing underwear.

4410
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:16,940
Nope.

4411
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:18,140
I'm in me joggers.

4412
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:19,740
Broom, broom.

4413
03:12:20,780 --> 03:12:22,140
It's hot in here, okay?

4414
03:12:22,140 --> 03:12:23,500
I'm in bed, so yeah, boxers.

4415
03:12:24,700 --> 03:12:25,500
I'm wearing shorts.

4416
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:26,380
The socks count.

4417
03:12:26,380 --> 03:12:27,580
You're only wearing socks?

4418
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:28,940
They don't look cold.

4419
03:12:28,940 --> 03:12:30,540
I'm at work, fully clothed.

4420
03:12:30,540 --> 03:12:31,660
Oh, are you at work?

4421
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:33,100
Ink yourself.

4422
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:33,420
No!

4423
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:35,980
No, don't, don't, don't, don't.

4424
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:36,540
You're at work.

4425
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:39,180
Pants to check.

4426
03:12:39,180 --> 03:12:39,820
I'm a grown man.

4427
03:12:39,820 --> 03:12:41,180
Why would I wear clothes on my own house?

4428
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:42,380
Real, real through.

4429
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:44,060
I don't have shit to do.

4430
03:12:44,060 --> 03:12:44,700
So hot.

4431
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:46,220
Mmm, grab it up.

4432
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:47,180
Power word.

4433
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:47,580
Ink.

4434
03:12:48,380 --> 03:12:50,860
Easier to keep the jewels at a proper temperature.

4435
03:12:51,820 --> 03:12:53,180
Alone and naked.

4436
03:12:55,180 --> 03:12:57,100
I'm always on the commando grind.

4437
03:12:57,100 --> 03:13:00,220
Oh, you got the commando weapon on black ops?

4438
03:13:00,220 --> 03:13:00,700
Real.

4439
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:03,180
Um.

4440
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:08,380
Mmm.

4441
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:10,060
Mummy, I'm nervous to say my age in chat,

4442
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:12,060
although other reasons have said theirs.

4443
03:13:12,060 --> 03:13:15,100
But I'm 20 and yes, I'm letting you control my ink in America.

4444
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:16,620
Oh, you're letting an older woman.

4445
03:13:17,180 --> 03:13:18,060
Call me a cougar.

4446
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:21,260
An older woman?

4447
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:23,260
Control your ink?

4448
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:30,140
I'm walking in public so sadly, I'm modestly just terrible.

4449
03:13:30,140 --> 03:13:32,220
Caught me off guard, I'm wearing five pairs of pants.

4450
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:32,700
Got you!

4451
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:34,380
Got you in 4k.

4452
03:13:34,380 --> 03:13:35,660
A onesie for real, for real.

4453
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:38,140
I've sucked on, does that count?

4454
03:13:38,140 --> 03:13:38,620
Something.

4455
03:13:39,340 --> 03:13:40,780
You spilled water on that bed.

4456
03:13:41,660 --> 03:13:42,140
Bed?

4457
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:43,580
Who's bed?

4458
03:13:43,580 --> 03:13:44,380
Who's bed?

4459
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:46,540
This is called floor.

4460
03:13:47,500 --> 03:13:48,220
No bed here.

4461
03:13:52,220 --> 03:13:53,580
Below 20 and 30.

4462
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:55,260
We're closing in on that real age boys.

4463
03:13:55,260 --> 03:13:55,660
Ooh.

4464
03:13:58,140 --> 03:14:00,220
Please do the foot cam script writing stream.

4465
03:14:00,220 --> 03:14:03,180
I have a major fantasy of being used as a chair and a foot sill.

4466
03:14:03,180 --> 03:14:03,420
Oh.

4467
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,260
So that's your thing.

4468
03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:10,860
That's your special interest.

4469
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:12,220
Oh, and you ignore me.

4470
03:14:12,220 --> 03:14:14,620
Just playing with that ball as you were yapping was killing me.

4471
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:16,060
I'm sure the other refunds would enjoy it too.

4472
03:14:16,060 --> 03:14:16,620
Thank you, mommy.

4473
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:17,500
You're too good.

4474
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:20,380
Also CB, cognitive behavioural therapy is not punishment.

4475
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:22,300
Kinkling.

4476
03:14:22,300 --> 03:14:24,060
More like you've got a name upgrade.

4477
03:14:24,060 --> 03:14:24,940
You're called kinkling.

4478
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:26,780
Furnit year?

4479
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:27,740
You want to be furnit year?

4480
03:14:31,180 --> 03:14:32,700
No bed, no hands for hanging.

4481
03:14:32,700 --> 03:14:33,580
Life is a lie.

4482
03:14:33,580 --> 03:14:35,500
What, you wanted my bed for the next one?

4483
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:40,700
I mean, if you want, I can bring a mattress through for the next hand cam stream.

4484
03:14:40,700 --> 03:14:41,580
I don't see why not.

4485
03:14:42,380 --> 03:14:43,900
I don't see why not.

4486
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:45,820
I can bring a mattress in if you want it.

4487
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:46,620
Like, sure.

4488
03:14:46,620 --> 03:14:47,740
That's all you have to say.

4489
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:49,820
Do it.

4490
03:14:49,820 --> 03:14:51,020
Treat me like an object.

4491
03:14:51,020 --> 03:14:51,820
Fuck no.

4492
03:14:51,820 --> 03:14:53,500
That's just vanilla stuff.

4493
03:14:54,380 --> 03:14:55,500
I'm kink-shing.

4494
03:14:57,980 --> 03:14:59,260
Older women are extremely hot.

4495
03:14:59,260 --> 03:15:01,820
I'd assume it's the same for women when older men are hot.

4496
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:04,540
See, I go both ways.

4497
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:05,660
I'm like fucking everything.

4498
03:15:05,660 --> 03:15:06,460
Gimme it all, please.

4499
03:15:08,460 --> 03:15:09,260
As a lurk.

4500
03:15:09,420 --> 03:15:10,380
As a lurk?

4501
03:15:11,820 --> 03:15:12,380
Hi, strongy.

4502
03:15:12,380 --> 03:15:14,460
All this lurker love is making me come out of the woodworks

4503
03:15:14,460 --> 03:15:16,380
and I'm a major lurker who doesn't even talk and chat.

4504
03:15:16,380 --> 03:15:17,580
Been lurking since debut.

4505
03:15:17,580 --> 03:15:18,060
Oh, hi.

4506
03:15:19,260 --> 03:15:22,540
We're almost at four months lurking on me from the shadows.

4507
03:15:22,540 --> 03:15:23,260
But I see.

4508
03:15:25,420 --> 03:15:27,020
And other girls, it's actually kind of bad

4509
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:29,180
because whenever I become a member, I did it

4510
03:15:29,180 --> 03:15:31,420
when there was no stream, so you wouldn't read my name.

4511
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:35,340
Oh, but that's like the best part about like becoming a member

4512
03:15:35,340 --> 03:15:37,420
because I'm not allowed to say your names in general.

4513
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:38,540
Because that's feature, but there,

4514
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:40,220
that's one of the unwritten VTuber rules,

4515
03:15:40,220 --> 03:15:43,740
to wrap around back to the singing.

4516
03:15:44,780 --> 03:15:46,220
That's like an unwritten VTuber rule.

4517
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:48,780
I don't say your names in general, like I could,

4518
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:51,100
but I don't because it's not possible.

4519
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:54,860
But when you tip or become a member or stream snipe,

4520
03:15:54,860 --> 03:15:56,780
then that gives you the choice.

4521
03:15:56,780 --> 03:15:59,420
Although I feel a bit rough about the stream snipe one

4522
03:15:59,420 --> 03:16:01,180
because obviously for those who like to lurk,

4523
03:16:01,180 --> 03:16:03,740
I'm worried that you feel left out

4524
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:05,580
because you don't want to show up on stream

4525
03:16:05,580 --> 03:16:07,260
because you're self-conscious.

4526
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:10,620
But I'm hoping I can extract not only ink out of you

4527
03:16:10,620 --> 03:16:11,820
but some confidence as well.

4528
03:16:11,820 --> 03:16:13,500
So it would work out in the long run, you know?

4529
03:16:15,020 --> 03:16:18,300
Momay, a birth ASMR that ends in the reveal of Jenta next year.

4530
03:16:19,580 --> 03:16:21,180
I have no idea.

4531
03:16:21,180 --> 03:16:22,300
Like a real ninja.

4532
03:16:22,300 --> 03:16:23,020
That's okay.

4533
03:16:23,900 --> 03:16:25,740
I never like when VTuber say my name.

4534
03:16:25,740 --> 03:16:26,060
Why?

4535
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:28,460
Beat for free just like that.

4536
03:16:28,460 --> 03:16:31,260
You're gonna love my monetization stream.

4537
03:16:32,380 --> 03:16:32,700
Sir?

4538
03:16:33,660 --> 03:16:33,980
Sir?

4539
03:16:34,700 --> 03:16:36,700
There's a monetization stream

4540
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:38,700
with your name written on it on this channel.

4541
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:39,420
If you like VT.

4542
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:42,780
Isn't that just for money purposes?

4543
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:45,420
Like your only one worth can call your name if you pay me?

4544
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:47,420
No.

4545
03:16:47,420 --> 03:16:49,660
Like if I start to try and say everyone's...

4546
03:16:49,660 --> 03:16:51,820
So I used to do this thing where I say good morning,

4547
03:16:51,820 --> 03:16:53,500
try and say everyone's name at roll call,

4548
03:16:53,500 --> 03:16:55,260
but it's not possible.

4549
03:16:55,260 --> 03:16:57,580
So I can only say it during the...

4550
03:16:57,580 --> 03:16:59,980
It's not like fuck you pay me, I'll say your name.

4551
03:16:59,980 --> 03:17:04,460
It's just like brain worms and all those issues that come up.

4552
03:17:04,460 --> 03:17:05,900
Fin don't fuck off!

4553
03:17:05,900 --> 03:17:06,220
No!

4554
03:17:07,660 --> 03:17:08,380
Nope!

4555
03:17:08,380 --> 03:17:08,940
I'm...

4556
03:17:08,940 --> 03:17:09,420
Nope.

4557
03:17:09,420 --> 03:17:10,540
We're not doing that.

4558
03:17:10,540 --> 03:17:11,500
We're not doing that.

4559
03:17:11,500 --> 03:17:12,300
You're done.

4560
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:12,940
You're done.

4561
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:14,620
You're done.

4562
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:16,300
You're done.

4563
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:16,940
We're not...

4564
03:17:16,940 --> 03:17:19,660
We're not even touching that subject of our time football.

4565
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:22,300
Mummy, what are your any opinions about armpits?

4566
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:25,660
I think you should take a big inhale of mine,

4567
03:17:25,660 --> 03:17:27,900
memorize the sin and ink.

4568
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:29,260
That's why I think about armpits.

4569
03:17:29,420 --> 03:17:37,500
It would cause brain worms if someone doesn't get their name called out when they're doing a roll.

4570
03:17:37,500 --> 03:17:39,420
Yeah, like I don't want brain worms either.

4571
03:17:40,220 --> 03:17:40,940
Don't shoot me!

4572
03:17:40,940 --> 03:17:42,060
I'm just a messenger!

4573
03:17:42,060 --> 03:17:42,620
Reeflings!

4574
03:17:42,620 --> 03:17:44,540
Twist that man's nipples right now.

4575
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:46,060
Getting up on that reefling right now.

4576
03:17:46,060 --> 03:17:46,940
Show them...

4577
03:17:46,940 --> 03:17:48,780
Show them what a real twisty is all about.

4578
03:17:50,300 --> 03:17:52,060
Hi mummy, I'm also a denialing right now.

4579
03:17:52,060 --> 03:17:53,660
Can I ask for some words of encouragement?

4580
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,940
I have until Saturday.

4581
03:17:54,940 --> 03:17:55,980
When's Saturday?

4582
03:17:55,980 --> 03:17:58,460
I'm on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

4583
03:17:58,540 --> 03:17:59,180
What's that one?

4584
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:01,420
Two, three, four, five.

4585
03:18:01,420 --> 03:18:02,700
Five more days, damn.

4586
03:18:04,380 --> 03:18:05,740
Sucks the suck, damnit.

4587
03:18:07,500 --> 03:18:09,420
Sucks the fucking suck.

4588
03:18:11,900 --> 03:18:14,780
Watch Thephilipod dom here?

4589
03:18:14,780 --> 03:18:15,660
I don't know, what would it...

4590
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:18,300
It's healthy to lose gums with ink every stream.

4591
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:20,300
I hope you find it.

4592
03:18:20,300 --> 03:18:22,540
Thank you, Gura, for that hit joke.

4593
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:23,660
Yes, I will steal that.

4594
03:18:26,140 --> 03:18:27,660
Denialing, what would you say to that?

4595
03:18:27,660 --> 03:18:28,700
To encourage you?

4596
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:30,860
Don't think about it.

4597
03:18:31,660 --> 03:18:33,180
But if you do think about it,

4598
03:18:34,300 --> 03:18:38,380
make sure you think really deep and hard about it.

4599
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:45,420
Almost keep ramming the point over and over and over again in your head.

4600
03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:52,700
Where did my desktop audio display?

4601
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:54,140
Something pleaded my desktop audio.

4602
03:18:54,140 --> 03:18:54,940
I don't know what it was.

4603
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:58,060
Is someone streaming in the background?

4604
03:19:05,660 --> 03:19:07,660
Hi, mommie, I'm usually too tired to send in texts.

4605
03:19:07,660 --> 03:19:08,220
No, you don't have to.

4606
03:19:08,220 --> 03:19:10,460
But whenever you make content specifically for yourself,

4607
03:19:10,460 --> 03:19:11,740
I do like to send you something in return.

4608
03:19:11,740 --> 03:19:13,580
So don't worry if it seems like you don't want to send stuff.

4609
03:19:13,580 --> 03:19:15,340
I think most of us just wait for material.

4610
03:19:15,340 --> 03:19:15,900
That's fair.

4611
03:19:15,900 --> 03:19:16,540
No, that's true.

4612
03:19:16,540 --> 03:19:17,180
No, that's true.

4613
03:19:17,180 --> 03:19:17,740
That's true.

4614
03:19:17,740 --> 03:19:18,540
That's definitely true.

4615
03:19:18,540 --> 03:19:21,180
I've been just lacking and lacking, unfortunately.

4616
03:19:21,420 --> 03:19:26,780
And that's like I fucked up when I made my Roblox account.

4617
03:19:26,780 --> 03:19:28,220
Literally have my first surname.

4618
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:33,660
Yeah, definitely don't stream snipe if your legal name is on your social media.

4619
03:19:34,380 --> 03:19:36,620
That goes for anyone else listening out there.

4620
03:19:36,620 --> 03:19:39,340
Turn your name into 360 no scope now.

4621
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:42,860
Do not use your legal name on any stuff.

4622
03:19:44,460 --> 03:19:45,580
Moment please.

4623
03:19:45,580 --> 03:19:46,460
These songs are good.

4624
03:19:46,460 --> 03:19:47,580
Hey, mommie, I need to go pee.

4625
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:48,940
Can you pause the game?

4626
03:19:51,660 --> 03:19:53,820
I can't remember the VTuber's response to that.

4627
03:19:53,820 --> 03:19:55,260
I think that's a VTuber's name.

4628
03:19:56,060 --> 03:19:56,940
It's too late.

4629
03:19:57,660 --> 03:19:58,460
It's too late.

4630
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:03,500
Just don't need the new honey you bought, you know.

4631
03:20:03,500 --> 03:20:06,220
Can we do an ASMR stream where we send our names on Maro and VTuber?

4632
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:09,740
I did think about that for the Pokemon stream.

4633
03:20:11,100 --> 03:20:14,140
I was trying to take the feedback I got from the drawing stream,

4634
03:20:14,140 --> 03:20:16,860
the membership drawing one, where I gave him the gamer tag and stuff,

4635
03:20:16,860 --> 03:20:19,180
but people didn't like it, so I'm a bit hesitant.

4636
03:20:19,580 --> 03:20:24,700
Considering how you are advertised, I almost feel bad.

4637
03:20:24,700 --> 03:20:25,420
I haven't inked to me.

4638
03:20:25,420 --> 03:20:26,380
I just watched your streams.

4639
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:29,500
You've never inked to me once?

4640
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:31,260
Is it my accent?

4641
03:20:35,100 --> 03:20:38,060
There's not one thing that's made you want to ink.

4642
03:20:40,060 --> 03:20:41,740
I'm clearly failing my job.

4643
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:45,820
I'm clearly a failure as a succubus.

4644
03:20:46,780 --> 03:20:47,980
No one?

4645
03:20:47,980 --> 03:20:50,380
You gave mummy brain worms, literally.

4646
03:20:50,380 --> 03:20:51,260
No one?

4647
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:54,060
I've not said one thing that's tickled your pickle pink

4648
03:20:54,780 --> 03:20:56,700
until you stroke that shit raw.

4649
03:20:57,660 --> 03:21:00,380
Until you couldn't feel your thighs anymore?

4650
03:21:00,380 --> 03:21:02,460
What a failure of a fucking streamer I am.

4651
03:21:02,460 --> 03:21:02,940
Goddamn.

4652
03:21:03,980 --> 03:21:04,620
Sacrilege.

4653
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:08,460
Mummy needs your ink to survive.

4654
03:21:08,460 --> 03:21:09,260
Girl, failure.

4655
03:21:09,260 --> 03:21:10,140
I can't believe it.

4656
03:21:10,140 --> 03:21:10,620
A face.

4657
03:21:12,060 --> 03:21:13,340
He's just a holy knight.

4658
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:14,860
Don't take it personally.

4659
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:17,180
Goddamn.

4660
03:21:18,860 --> 03:21:20,060
I'm the girl failure.

4661
03:21:20,060 --> 03:21:22,860
I can't even live up to those fucking expectations.

4662
03:21:22,860 --> 03:21:23,180
Shit.

4663
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:28,060
Shocking.

4664
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:28,380
Chong.

4665
03:21:29,180 --> 03:21:31,740
If that made you mad, you're not gonna like what I have to say.

4666
03:21:32,460 --> 03:21:33,420
No!

4667
03:21:33,420 --> 03:21:34,300
Wait, really?

4668
03:21:38,540 --> 03:21:38,860
Ah.

4669
03:21:39,660 --> 03:21:40,780
Don't take it to heart.

4670
03:21:41,340 --> 03:21:46,860
That fucking teasing game, that shit, the fuck?

4671
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:51,900
Oh, you can't do that.

4672
03:21:52,940 --> 03:21:53,900
That's okay.

4673
03:21:53,900 --> 03:21:56,460
Um, there's a time and a place for that.

4674
03:21:56,460 --> 03:21:56,860
There it is.

4675
03:21:57,900 --> 03:21:59,100
I know what it is.

4676
03:21:59,100 --> 03:22:01,180
It's cause I'm not cute and funny, isn't it?

4677
03:22:02,220 --> 03:22:03,820
It's cause I'm not cute and funny.

4678
03:22:05,020 --> 03:22:06,300
You know what I think about that?

4679
03:22:06,380 --> 03:22:19,500
You don't have to be scared, I want this, please, for me.

4680
03:22:20,540 --> 03:22:21,020
That's it.

4681
03:22:21,020 --> 03:22:22,700
It's cause you want cute and funny, but I'm down here.

4682
03:22:22,700 --> 03:22:24,380
I'm all the way down here with my octaves.

4683
03:22:24,940 --> 03:22:27,180
I'm chilling down here with my octaves, all right?

4684
03:22:28,780 --> 03:22:30,620
Leave me and my deep voice alone.

4685
03:22:30,620 --> 03:22:31,980
I know you like the cute and funny.

4686
03:22:31,980 --> 03:22:32,540
I'm on to you.

4687
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:32,940
Which one?

4688
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:34,300
I don't think I've been again.

4689
03:22:34,300 --> 03:22:35,020
No, I'm on to you.

4690
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:40,860
I sadly, I can't ink to you most of the time because of anti-depressants.

4691
03:22:40,860 --> 03:22:41,980
Oh, no, keep doing that.

4692
03:22:41,980 --> 03:22:42,460
Hold it.

4693
03:22:42,460 --> 03:22:46,700
All memes aside, all memes aside, all memes aside.

4694
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:51,180
Do not stop taking, cause the thing about anti-depressants is

4695
03:22:51,180 --> 03:22:53,020
they take so long to build up in your system

4696
03:22:53,020 --> 03:22:55,900
if you stop taking them purely for the purpose of inking.

4697
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:58,220
No, thank you.

4698
03:22:59,820 --> 03:23:00,940
Lollipops running.

4699
03:23:02,140 --> 03:23:02,860
Cunning cull.

4700
03:23:04,060 --> 03:23:04,620
Okay.

4701
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:05,260
Hi, Yumi.

4702
03:23:05,260 --> 03:23:05,740
How's it going?

4703
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:07,980
Cunning cull.

4704
03:23:09,740 --> 03:23:10,380
Fuck.

4705
03:23:10,380 --> 03:23:11,100
That's kind of good.

4706
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:13,980
You like the dummy mommy voice?

4707
03:23:13,980 --> 03:23:14,300
What?

4708
03:23:14,300 --> 03:23:16,700
You mean you don't like the Ash Ketchum voice?

4709
03:23:18,140 --> 03:23:18,620
Ash.

4710
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:21,420
I'm Ash Ketchum.

4711
03:23:21,420 --> 03:23:23,260
What do you mean you don't like my voice?

4712
03:23:24,540 --> 03:23:26,140
Um, you got class then?

4713
03:23:26,140 --> 03:23:27,500
Oh my god, you're in education?

4714
03:23:27,500 --> 03:23:28,300
How young?

4715
03:23:28,300 --> 03:23:29,500
Are you over 18?

4716
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:31,340
I don't call out for people that are under 18.

4717
03:23:34,540 --> 03:23:35,020
Are you an-

4718
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:36,460
Okay.

4719
03:23:37,260 --> 03:23:37,900
Monka is.

4720
03:23:38,780 --> 03:23:39,900
Please enjoy your class.

4721
03:23:39,900 --> 03:23:40,380
Goddamn.

4722
03:23:41,900 --> 03:23:43,020
What's the name plus twi-

4723
03:23:43,020 --> 03:23:44,540
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4724
03:23:44,540 --> 03:23:45,820
You had me stressed in there.

4725
03:23:45,820 --> 03:23:47,660
I was like, you fucking middle school?

4726
03:23:47,660 --> 03:23:49,580
Why are you talking to me?

4727
03:23:49,580 --> 03:23:51,020
Why are you making content?

4728
03:23:53,180 --> 03:23:54,300
Change her back.

4729
03:23:54,300 --> 03:23:56,460
I want that voice that sounds like she's telling me all.

4730
03:23:57,660 --> 03:23:58,460
Oh, this one.

4731
03:23:58,460 --> 03:23:59,020
Right, okay.

4732
03:23:59,660 --> 03:24:00,780
It's Ash Ketchum.

4733
03:24:00,780 --> 03:24:01,580
Holy smokes.

4734
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:03,260
I don't know what-

4735
03:24:03,420 --> 03:24:06,140
I don't know what American ranking system is.

4736
03:24:06,140 --> 03:24:09,660
Is middle school not like when you're 12 or something?

4737
03:24:09,660 --> 03:24:10,540
I have no idea.

4738
03:24:11,500 --> 03:24:12,780
University is a thing?

4739
03:24:13,820 --> 03:24:17,980
Well, it could use me for being uneducated

4740
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:19,900
and not understanding the basic age ranges

4741
03:24:19,900 --> 03:24:21,820
of those who go into further education.

4742
03:24:22,940 --> 03:24:24,140
It could be at university.

4743
03:24:24,940 --> 03:24:26,780
College students can be 18 or 19.

4744
03:24:26,780 --> 03:24:29,180
Funny to put her on her toes though.

4745
03:24:30,140 --> 03:24:32,780
Did you just make a pun?

4746
03:24:33,660 --> 03:24:38,460
I hear, I hear, I hear.

4747
03:24:38,460 --> 03:24:40,860
You me said she put me on my toes.

4748
03:24:42,220 --> 03:24:43,420
This is my perfect team.

4749
03:24:44,460 --> 03:24:45,980
I don't like the toes pointing at-

4750
03:24:45,980 --> 03:24:47,900
Well, you don't have dexterity in your toes?

4751
03:24:48,780 --> 03:24:50,620
Like, can you not move them around

4752
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:52,140
and do what you want with them?

4753
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:53,100
I didn't mean to.

4754
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:53,660
Oh my God.

4755
03:24:53,660 --> 03:24:54,860
Well, it was bloody good either way.

4756
03:24:58,620 --> 03:24:59,500
Nicely said.

4757
03:24:59,500 --> 03:25:00,620
I don't mind Ash Ketchum.

4758
03:25:00,620 --> 03:25:02,300
I have specific things though.

4759
03:25:03,180 --> 03:25:03,660
What?

4760
03:25:03,660 --> 03:25:05,980
You'd prefer Jesse instead?

4761
03:25:07,340 --> 03:25:09,500
What's the wrong briefling?

4762
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:12,460
You don't like when mommy sounds like a Pokemon character?

4763
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:14,380
Oh dear.

4764
03:25:17,580 --> 03:25:19,260
How you like that, boys?

4765
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,900
Strony's toes are very powerful.

4766
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:22,780
Can you do James?

4767
03:25:23,900 --> 03:25:24,940
Me off this right-

4768
03:25:24,940 --> 03:25:25,580
Wait, James.

4769
03:25:26,860 --> 03:25:29,180
To protect the world from devastation.

4770
03:25:29,180 --> 03:25:30,060
I can't go that deep.

4771
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:32,140
I can't go that deep.

4772
03:25:32,140 --> 03:25:32,780
Ma'am, please.

4773
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:33,420
I'm in the kitchen.

4774
03:25:33,420 --> 03:25:34,540
Try and make dinner.

4775
03:25:34,540 --> 03:25:35,340
What's wrong?

4776
03:25:36,060 --> 03:25:39,260
Are you imagining me coming from behind you?

4777
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:39,900
No.

4778
03:25:39,900 --> 03:25:41,420
Keep doing what you're doing.

4779
03:25:41,420 --> 03:25:44,620
I'm just going to stay behind you.

4780
03:25:44,620 --> 03:25:46,620
Press the real class in the kitchen.

4781
03:25:48,220 --> 03:25:49,900
James is higher than Jesse.

4782
03:25:49,900 --> 03:25:50,540
Wait, walk.

4783
03:25:51,820 --> 03:25:53,580
Protect the world from devastation.

4784
03:25:54,460 --> 03:25:56,700
To protect the world from devastation.

4785
03:25:58,140 --> 03:25:59,340
Me off this right?

4786
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:00,780
Uh, I kind of fucking do.

4787
03:26:02,780 --> 03:26:03,740
Protect the world.

4788
03:26:04,460 --> 03:26:05,500
Protect the world.

4789
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:08,780
Protect the world from devastation.

4790
03:26:08,780 --> 03:26:09,580
Wait, no.

4791
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:12,940
James, how?

4792
03:26:12,940 --> 03:26:13,580
I'm okay.

4793
03:26:14,620 --> 03:26:15,740
Please, I'm trying to click in.

4794
03:26:15,740 --> 03:26:17,740
Can you go ara ara?

4795
03:26:17,740 --> 03:26:21,180
Ara ara, and then in Jesse's voice.

4796
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:22,220
Ara ara.

4797
03:26:24,140 --> 03:26:26,860
Have you been a good boy, little briefling?

4798
03:26:27,820 --> 03:26:33,340
Have you been making sure that mommy has perfect access to you?

4799
03:26:37,020 --> 03:26:41,020
Did you know if you stick your feet out from the blanket,

4800
03:26:41,020 --> 03:26:43,180
mommy's going to visit to talk you in?

4801
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:48,780
The trolling James voice is our register's more than this one.

4802
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:49,740
This is kind of thing.

4803
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:52,220
How do you do it Valley though?

4804
03:26:53,980 --> 03:26:56,380
Oh my god, are you me?

4805
03:26:56,860 --> 03:26:59,420
It's been so long.

4806
03:27:00,620 --> 03:27:01,340
That's the best.

4807
03:27:01,340 --> 03:27:02,220
I go up right here.

4808
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:07,420
That triggered my swallow reflex.

4809
03:27:07,420 --> 03:27:09,180
I'm playing a game of women's chills.

4810
03:27:10,140 --> 03:27:11,020
Young world craft.

4811
03:27:12,220 --> 03:27:13,580
Woman mathematical stood up.

4812
03:27:13,580 --> 03:27:16,300
Up two, three forward, up two, three forward.

4813
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:18,620
It's been way too long.

4814
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:23,420
We should like honestly catch the fuck up like seriously.

4815
03:27:24,060 --> 03:27:27,580
What? Why are you calling me a bimbo?

4816
03:27:28,380 --> 03:27:29,420
What are you talking about?

4817
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:30,860
What does that word even mean?

4818
03:27:31,740 --> 03:27:33,660
You're so funny, briefling.

4819
03:27:33,660 --> 03:27:36,380
I like when you give me that expression on your face

4820
03:27:36,380 --> 03:27:37,660
like you're pitying me.

4821
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:39,980
I don't know.

4822
03:27:40,780 --> 03:27:41,740
That's a car.

4823
03:27:41,740 --> 03:27:42,220
Sorry.

4824
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:43,740
I'm sorry.

4825
03:27:43,740 --> 03:27:45,980
I'm gonna imagine saying what?

4826
03:27:47,820 --> 03:27:48,700
No, I'm not a good boy.

4827
03:27:48,700 --> 03:27:51,980
In fact, I'm actually a bad boy that I became a woman.

4828
03:27:51,980 --> 03:27:52,540
What?

4829
03:27:52,620 --> 03:27:53,740
That's not every one.

4830
03:27:54,460 --> 03:27:55,900
Gayru voice on top.

4831
03:27:56,940 --> 03:27:59,260
Fifth, fifth gal in law.

4832
03:28:00,060 --> 03:28:01,260
Bimbos have big boobs.

4833
03:28:05,340 --> 03:28:06,300
I'm speechless.

4834
03:28:06,300 --> 03:28:07,740
I don't know what to say to that.

4835
03:28:07,740 --> 03:28:11,580
Um, you got me there.

4836
03:28:13,260 --> 03:28:14,380
You got me there.

4837
03:28:14,380 --> 03:28:15,660
I'm not gonna lie.

4838
03:28:15,660 --> 03:28:16,780
Fuck, I have no comeback.

4839
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:24,540
Yeah, okay, I got to tip for that Jesse Aruara.

4840
03:28:24,540 --> 03:28:25,580
Pure gold.

4841
03:28:25,580 --> 03:28:26,380
I lost.

4842
03:28:26,380 --> 03:28:27,980
Oh, you liked it.

4843
03:28:27,980 --> 03:28:28,380
Thank you.

4844
03:28:30,620 --> 03:28:31,740
Literally I paused.

4845
03:28:31,740 --> 03:28:33,900
I was like, there's no recovery from that one.

4846
03:28:33,900 --> 03:28:36,940
Oh, I was like, oh, I can do this and this and this.

4847
03:28:36,940 --> 03:28:39,100
And I was like, well, actually the webcam's on right now.

4848
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:41,420
If I go sideways, you're gonna see through me.

4849
03:28:41,420 --> 03:28:43,260
Um, so not as much as that happens.

4850
03:28:44,220 --> 03:28:45,500
Are you squinting me right now?

4851
03:28:45,500 --> 03:28:46,620
Mio's Oro Oro.

4852
03:28:47,260 --> 03:28:49,500
Strani is one of my favorite streamers.

4853
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:49,900
Oh, yeah?

4854
03:28:49,900 --> 03:28:52,860
Thankfully, she doesn't know who I am since this is my out.

4855
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:55,740
Gura Gura channel.in.

4856
03:28:55,740 --> 03:28:56,940
Okay, dude.

4857
03:28:56,940 --> 03:28:58,300
Thank you for the tip.

4858
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:01,660
Gura, we love you, Gura.

4859
03:29:01,660 --> 03:29:03,100
I can't wait for your next thing.

4860
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:06,060
I love your, your bucket, Callan.

4861
03:29:06,060 --> 03:29:08,780
Your gallon bucket of a comment.

4862
03:29:08,780 --> 03:29:09,580
That was really funny.

4863
03:29:09,580 --> 03:29:10,300
Peace.

4864
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:12,860
I don't know how she can think on her feet like that.

4865
03:29:12,860 --> 03:29:13,340
Yeah.

4866
03:29:13,340 --> 03:29:16,380
I don't know how Gura could think so fast on her feet like that.

4867
03:29:16,380 --> 03:29:18,220
I don't get it because I'm just asking.

4868
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:22,460
Um, I don't know how she did that, honestly.

4869
03:29:24,060 --> 03:29:25,420
I've lost gallons to you.

4870
03:29:26,060 --> 03:29:27,340
I've lost gallons to you.

4871
03:29:28,060 --> 03:29:29,260
I hope you can go find it.

4872
03:29:33,580 --> 03:29:34,300
Gura's real.

4873
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:35,900
She's a real good book.

4874
03:29:36,700 --> 03:29:38,060
Why is that whenever I come at hand?

4875
03:29:38,060 --> 03:29:39,740
I'm streaming my feet.

4876
03:29:39,740 --> 03:29:41,260
Honestly, you got me there.

4877
03:29:41,260 --> 03:29:42,140
Wrap it up.

4878
03:29:42,140 --> 03:29:42,780
Wrap it up.

4879
03:29:42,780 --> 03:29:43,820
The reefling called me out.

4880
03:29:43,820 --> 03:29:44,860
No, he's got a point.

4881
03:29:44,860 --> 03:29:45,500
Nope.

4882
03:29:45,500 --> 03:29:45,980
Hold on.

4883
03:29:45,980 --> 03:29:46,540
Let him speak.

4884
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:47,340
He's got a point.

4885
03:29:48,460 --> 03:29:48,780
Um,

4886
03:29:53,980 --> 03:29:55,180
they're trying not like bimbos.

4887
03:29:55,180 --> 03:29:56,380
No, I'm flat-chested.

4888
03:29:56,380 --> 03:29:58,380
You may, you may.

4889
03:29:58,380 --> 03:30:00,380
There's no other way to explain this.

4890
03:30:00,380 --> 03:30:01,260
I am Patan.

4891
03:30:02,460 --> 03:30:06,940
Um, I have the smallest as well of all my gen mates.

4892
03:30:06,940 --> 03:30:08,460
Um, I am flat-chested.

4893
03:30:09,180 --> 03:30:13,180
No more feet on hand count streams?

4894
03:30:17,980 --> 03:30:19,180
Why are you lying?

4895
03:30:19,900 --> 03:30:20,380
I mean,

4896
03:30:22,460 --> 03:30:22,860
I mean,

4897
03:30:32,140 --> 03:30:33,180
that's all you're getting.

4898
03:30:34,220 --> 03:30:36,140
Do you see head straight down this way?

4899
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:37,340
There's nothing going on.

4900
03:30:39,420 --> 03:30:41,420
There's just little hills.

4901
03:30:42,700 --> 03:30:44,220
There's tiny little hills.

4902
03:30:44,220 --> 03:30:45,180
We're just chilling.

4903
03:30:46,140 --> 03:30:47,180
Chilling like a villain.

4904
03:30:47,980 --> 03:30:49,980
No, there's a little bit.

4905
03:30:51,980 --> 03:30:52,780
The hips coming.

4906
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:55,420
A little bit.

4907
03:30:55,420 --> 03:30:57,100
I don't want to mess with the way I've come too much.

4908
03:30:57,100 --> 03:30:58,300
What time is it now?

4909
03:30:59,660 --> 03:30:59,980
Sorry.

4910
03:31:02,620 --> 03:31:02,860
Um,

4911
03:31:04,060 --> 03:31:05,340
Sheevee's boobs reattached.

4912
03:31:05,340 --> 03:31:07,740
Someone made a meme of Sheevee giving me her boobs

4913
03:31:07,740 --> 03:31:09,580
and I was like, who do you think ticked your boobs?

4914
03:31:09,580 --> 03:31:10,860
Stranny nose!

4915
03:31:14,060 --> 03:31:15,260
Are you squiddin' me right now?

4916
03:31:15,260 --> 03:31:16,860
Don't able to firmly grasp them.

4917
03:31:16,860 --> 03:31:19,660
Well, remember I do have a bra that's shaping them on,

4918
03:31:19,660 --> 03:31:20,380
by the way.

4919
03:31:20,380 --> 03:31:21,500
I have terrible news.

4920
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:24,060
Thank you to Puckle Nation for the extended membership.

4921
03:31:25,660 --> 03:31:26,300
And the support.

4922
03:31:27,020 --> 03:31:29,420
I hope you enjoy your emotes.

4923
03:31:29,420 --> 03:31:30,460
They're soon coming.

4924
03:31:30,460 --> 03:31:30,940
20m.

4925
03:31:31,980 --> 03:31:33,340
Rip that shit off!

4926
03:31:33,340 --> 03:31:33,980
Free the boob.

4927
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:36,940
I don't see any problems here.

4928
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:38,300
Okay.

4929
03:31:39,660 --> 03:31:40,380
Don't say sorry.

4930
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:40,940
I didn't mean it.

4931
03:31:40,940 --> 03:31:41,580
Oh, no, no, no.

4932
03:31:41,580 --> 03:31:42,300
Don't worry.

4933
03:31:42,300 --> 03:31:43,420
We're just teasing.

4934
03:31:43,420 --> 03:31:43,980
Don't worry.

4935
03:31:43,980 --> 03:31:44,620
I'm teasing.

4936
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:47,660
I'm teasing for a please and please don't overthink.

4937
03:31:47,660 --> 03:31:49,980
When you talk to me, you're wearing a brate.

4938
03:31:49,980 --> 03:31:51,100
Blasphemous.

4939
03:31:51,100 --> 03:31:51,580
I know.

4940
03:31:51,580 --> 03:31:52,220
Well, that's true.

4941
03:31:52,220 --> 03:31:54,540
If you're wearing a hammock and you said you were wearing a,

4942
03:31:54,540 --> 03:31:55,500
your boxerino.

4943
03:31:55,500 --> 03:31:56,540
So you're wearing a hammock.

4944
03:31:58,940 --> 03:31:59,740
Hi, mommy's feet.

4945
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:02,300
Hello, Riefling.

4946
03:32:02,300 --> 03:32:03,340
It's nice to see you.

4947
03:32:04,380 --> 03:32:05,900
I'm talking to you through my feet.

4948
03:32:06,700 --> 03:32:07,180
Ta-da.

4949
03:32:08,060 --> 03:32:09,740
Sorry, I'm an innocent asylum right now.

4950
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:13,580
Due to the fact that you can see my under feet.

4951
03:32:14,780 --> 03:32:16,380
To support what breast.

4952
03:32:16,380 --> 03:32:17,500
Right, steady on.

4953
03:32:17,500 --> 03:32:17,900
Right.

4954
03:32:17,900 --> 03:32:22,780
If there was no mild support, they'd start sagging and shit.

4955
03:32:22,780 --> 03:32:23,420
I don't know.

4956
03:32:23,420 --> 03:32:24,540
I don't know how science works.

4957
03:32:28,620 --> 03:32:32,860
Would you say it's not fair that guys can show their bitboops and women?

4958
03:32:32,860 --> 03:32:34,780
Oh, I get scared of men.

4959
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:41,180
Like, whenever I watch a movie or a TV show and then that guy takes his shirt off,

4960
03:32:41,180 --> 03:32:43,020
I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, right.

4961
03:32:43,020 --> 03:32:43,260
Okay.

4962
03:32:43,900 --> 03:32:47,100
Cause like, cause you're not allowed to see him another way, you know.

4963
03:32:49,100 --> 03:32:50,780
It's not expecting the ball squish.

4964
03:32:50,780 --> 03:32:51,900
Oh, I'm just having a bit.

4965
03:32:51,900 --> 03:32:54,460
I'm not, I'm just, I'm stimming on the ball right now.

4966
03:32:54,460 --> 03:32:55,900
I'm stimming so hard on your ball.

4967
03:32:57,900 --> 03:32:59,420
What do you feel about tattoos?

4968
03:32:59,420 --> 03:33:00,460
Knock yourself out.

4969
03:33:00,460 --> 03:33:02,620
Unfortunately, my mom instilled in shala.

4970
03:33:02,620 --> 03:33:03,740
She's instilled in me.

4971
03:33:03,740 --> 03:33:04,780
Didn't have any tattoos.

4972
03:33:05,500 --> 03:33:08,620
And I'm allowed piercings where they're not, well, I'm allowed.

4973
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:10,940
I am an adult now, but when I was growing up,

4974
03:33:10,940 --> 03:33:13,580
I had an interest in getting like a tongue piercing and stuff.

4975
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:18,860
But she said, don't get piercings where people can see them.

4976
03:33:20,860 --> 03:33:23,420
And I took that literally and I got my angel wings.

4977
03:33:23,420 --> 03:33:28,460
Um, yeah.

4978
03:33:31,580 --> 03:33:34,300
The sad ball, my single ball.

4979
03:33:37,260 --> 03:33:38,620
She's still one of those strong.

4980
03:33:40,140 --> 03:33:42,300
Making me hungry and hatred.

4981
03:33:42,300 --> 03:33:44,460
I want a neck tattoo, but that would kill my job.

4982
03:33:44,460 --> 03:33:46,060
Yeah, I'm gonna have to.

4983
03:33:46,060 --> 03:33:48,140
I'm afraid the world hasn't quite evolved past.

4984
03:33:48,140 --> 03:33:48,620
Oh my God.

4985
03:33:48,620 --> 03:33:48,860
Inc.

4986
03:33:49,500 --> 03:33:53,020
Now as much as the angel wings, um, yeah.

4987
03:33:54,140 --> 03:33:54,940
You hold on.

4988
03:33:54,940 --> 03:33:55,500
Let me, uh,

4989
03:33:58,380 --> 03:33:59,580
approve just a minute.

4990
03:33:59,580 --> 03:34:01,180
And you know what this is?

4991
03:34:02,620 --> 03:34:04,060
This is an angel wing.

4992
03:34:05,740 --> 03:34:06,860
This was in me.

4993
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:08,140
It's no longer in me.

4994
03:34:09,020 --> 03:34:11,100
It was stolen from me by a shower.

4995
03:34:13,020 --> 03:34:16,780
That used to be a part of me, but unfortunately that ship

4996
03:34:16,780 --> 03:34:17,180
has sailed.

4997
03:34:17,180 --> 03:34:18,540
And no, I'm not gonna re-pierced.

4998
03:34:19,180 --> 03:34:20,620
You just have it.

4999
03:34:20,620 --> 03:34:22,620
Yeah, it ripped out like a month ago.

5000
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:29,260
I, it tore off out of me, like out of my personal body.

5001
03:34:29,980 --> 03:34:30,780
It went, wee.

5002
03:34:31,820 --> 03:34:32,780
It was painful.

5003
03:34:32,780 --> 03:34:35,660
Yes, before you ask, it was excruciatingly painful, but

5004
03:34:36,700 --> 03:34:38,860
will we take out the other for symmetry?

5005
03:34:38,860 --> 03:34:41,020
Oh, I'm keeping it for now.

5006
03:34:43,020 --> 03:34:46,460
Um, did the nip rip off?

5007
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:47,500
It reattached.

5008
03:34:47,500 --> 03:34:49,980
Um, because of the blood flow around the area,

5009
03:34:49,980 --> 03:34:51,980
um, it healed incredibly quickly,

5010
03:34:51,980 --> 03:34:54,300
which I kind of suspect.

5011
03:34:54,300 --> 03:34:57,420
But I'm a one-winged angel,

5012
03:34:57,420 --> 03:34:59,500
so I can kind of fly just a little bit,

5013
03:34:59,500 --> 03:35:00,940
not too much, but I can fly a little bit.

5014
03:35:01,980 --> 03:35:03,100
And you should take the other one out,

5015
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:04,860
so you don't rip that one as well.

5016
03:35:04,860 --> 03:35:06,540
But because I only have one now,

5017
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:09,420
my brain registers that I got only have one,

5018
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:10,460
and I need to be careful.

5019
03:35:12,620 --> 03:35:16,140
She almost had a gripper nipple on her body.

5020
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:17,100
What does that mean?

5021
03:35:17,820 --> 03:35:19,020
Oh, like, okay.

5022
03:35:19,980 --> 03:35:21,900
Shawnee, you need me to kiss it better.

5023
03:35:21,900 --> 03:35:22,940
Mmm.

5024
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:24,700
But yeah, it's fine, honestly, it's fine.

5025
03:35:26,860 --> 03:35:27,900
Sephora?

5026
03:35:28,780 --> 03:35:29,100
What?

5027
03:35:29,900 --> 03:35:30,860
Sephora?

5028
03:35:30,860 --> 03:35:31,500
Evil?

5029
03:35:32,380 --> 03:35:34,140
Wait, you've both made a reference to this.

5030
03:35:34,140 --> 03:35:34,780
What is this?

5031
03:35:35,500 --> 03:35:36,540
What's Sephora?

5032
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:41,580
What?

5033
03:35:41,580 --> 03:35:44,860
Is it Final Fantasy?

5034
03:35:44,860 --> 03:35:47,260
Oh, I've not played Final Fantasy, my apologies.

5035
03:35:47,900 --> 03:35:50,540
I thought Goofy was in Final Fantasy or something like that.

5036
03:35:52,220 --> 03:35:54,300
Sorry, I've not played Final Fantasy,

5037
03:35:54,300 --> 03:35:55,340
I've not played any of it.

5038
03:35:55,340 --> 03:35:57,020
Forgive me, okay, fake gamer,

5039
03:35:57,020 --> 03:35:58,220
only do it for male attention.

5040
03:35:59,100 --> 03:36:00,060
Sephora?

5041
03:36:00,060 --> 03:36:02,060
I've never seen the name before!

5042
03:36:02,060 --> 03:36:03,180
Stop typing names!

5043
03:36:03,980 --> 03:36:05,180
Like, you can't even be like,

5044
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:06,540
oh, she said it wrong.

5045
03:36:08,220 --> 03:36:09,980
Goofy is in Kingdom Hearts.

5046
03:36:09,980 --> 03:36:11,100
Wait, what?

5047
03:36:11,100 --> 03:36:13,420
Oh, wait, I'm getting Final Fantasy

5048
03:36:13,420 --> 03:36:14,860
in Kingdom's Heart messed up.

5049
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:16,780
Sorry, I've not played either before you ask.

5050
03:36:17,820 --> 03:36:19,260
Sephora, right.

5051
03:36:21,420 --> 03:36:22,780
You've got Kingdom Hearts sometimes.

5052
03:36:22,780 --> 03:36:25,420
I'm sorry, like, they look the same or something,

5053
03:36:25,420 --> 03:36:25,980
I don't know.

5054
03:36:25,980 --> 03:36:27,820
I ain't played the genres yet.

5055
03:36:27,820 --> 03:36:29,420
I ain't played the genres yet.

5056
03:36:31,260 --> 03:36:32,700
The One-Winged Angel,

5057
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:34,140
because you'll never guess what he is.

5058
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:35,740
Cuddles?

5059
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:37,100
I want to give you a womb tattoo,

5060
03:36:37,100 --> 03:36:38,220
but instead of a traditional one,

5061
03:36:38,220 --> 03:36:40,300
I want you to put my name on it

5062
03:36:40,300 --> 03:36:41,900
to show that you're my best friend.

5063
03:36:41,900 --> 03:36:43,020
Breeding pot, what the?

5064
03:36:44,700 --> 03:36:46,220
I don't think I should have read that one out loud.

5065
03:36:47,180 --> 03:36:47,580
Hmm.

5066
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:49,580
Hmm.

5067
03:36:50,700 --> 03:36:51,820
Your technical type though.

5068
03:36:52,620 --> 03:36:53,180
Be honest.

5069
03:36:55,260 --> 03:36:56,460
I can't ink to you if you don't know

5070
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:57,740
the Final Fantasy lore.

5071
03:36:59,020 --> 03:37:00,300
He did read that one out there.

5072
03:37:01,980 --> 03:37:04,380
Wait, I have to learn Final Fantasy lore?

5073
03:37:04,380 --> 03:37:04,860
Right.

5074
03:37:04,860 --> 03:37:06,940
Well, I'm Sephiroth, okay?

5075
03:37:06,940 --> 03:37:07,820
So, there you go.

5076
03:37:07,820 --> 03:37:09,500
How much more lore do you need

5077
03:37:09,500 --> 03:37:10,860
before you can base?

5078
03:37:10,860 --> 03:37:11,420
And base?

5079
03:37:13,580 --> 03:37:15,180
You're getting male attention and refling.

5080
03:37:15,180 --> 03:37:16,140
Ink mixed up?

5081
03:37:16,140 --> 03:37:16,620
I know.

5082
03:37:17,500 --> 03:37:19,260
Her internal thoughts are full of like,

5083
03:37:19,900 --> 03:37:20,940
more sane refling.

5084
03:37:22,620 --> 03:37:23,020
It's like,

5085
03:37:23,740 --> 03:37:26,220
it's like Dresda, but a femboy?

5086
03:37:26,940 --> 03:37:27,420
What?

5087
03:37:28,300 --> 03:37:29,260
Have we got femboy?

5088
03:37:29,260 --> 03:37:30,540
Are we fighting more femboys?

5089
03:37:30,540 --> 03:37:32,460
We just bought one in Elden Ring there.

5090
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:34,620
Hmm.

5091
03:37:34,620 --> 03:37:35,820
That's pretty fucking hot.

5092
03:37:35,820 --> 03:37:37,180
I'm a little reminded though.

5093
03:37:38,700 --> 03:37:41,100
Eh, not sure if message got filtered.

5094
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:42,380
Sorry if it's a repair.

5095
03:37:42,380 --> 03:37:44,700
Insert glasses, copy past that mummy.

5096
03:37:44,700 --> 03:37:46,300
I have a thing for nerdy girls with glasses.

5097
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:47,100
Since you have glasses,

5098
03:37:47,100 --> 03:37:48,460
can you pin some on your model?

5099
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:49,740
Just for fun.

5100
03:37:49,740 --> 03:37:51,580
Can you pull and see the reasons why you look like that?

5101
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:53,580
Oh no!

5102
03:37:57,180 --> 03:37:57,580
Yeah.

5103
03:38:06,540 --> 03:38:07,340
Reeflin.

5104
03:38:09,900 --> 03:38:10,860
A reeflin.

5105
03:38:10,860 --> 03:38:12,860
Are you fucking Gamblin?

5106
03:38:14,940 --> 03:38:18,220
I mean, I'll give it a like and a heart,

5107
03:38:18,220 --> 03:38:20,380
but don't fucking Gamba.

5108
03:38:20,380 --> 03:38:20,860
Doin'.

5109
03:38:22,940 --> 03:38:25,980
I just gambled on Pokemon cards and look what I get.

5110
03:38:26,620 --> 03:38:29,580
Energies and repeats for a century.

5111
03:38:29,580 --> 03:38:31,100
Wait, you can't see that tile there.

5112
03:38:31,100 --> 03:38:32,380
Hold on, I'm bringing it up.

5113
03:38:32,380 --> 03:38:34,060
Literally, look all these repeats.

5114
03:38:34,060 --> 03:38:35,820
Repeats, repeats, repeats.

5115
03:38:35,820 --> 03:38:37,100
Some of them I had multiple.

5116
03:38:37,100 --> 03:38:38,460
They showed up more than once.

5117
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:40,300
Like, you're Gamblin?

5118
03:38:41,180 --> 03:38:42,460
This is a job.

5119
03:38:42,540 --> 03:38:45,100
You're gonna lose, the house always wins.

5120
03:38:45,100 --> 03:38:48,140
Like, literally, I just had to work with Gamblin.

5121
03:38:48,140 --> 03:38:49,580
If you ignore the specials,

5122
03:38:49,580 --> 03:38:51,740
but the specials were guaranteed anyway,

5123
03:38:52,620 --> 03:38:53,820
you just touch them with your feet,

5124
03:38:53,820 --> 03:38:56,380
you gain 100% more value at once.

5125
03:38:58,300 --> 03:38:59,500
Gamblin for fun is fine,

5126
03:38:59,500 --> 03:39:01,900
but throwing money at it is expensive all day.

5127
03:39:01,900 --> 03:39:03,900
That's not Gamblin, that's RNG on the pack.

5128
03:39:03,900 --> 03:39:05,020
Gamblin is more Gamblin.

5129
03:39:06,540 --> 03:39:07,900
No more Gamblin, I'm having this.

5130
03:39:07,900 --> 03:39:09,180
What if I'm the house?

5131
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:11,340
Get it twisted, you will win big.

5132
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:13,500
Whoa, that is a reference

5133
03:39:13,500 --> 03:39:15,100
to hardly anyone's gonna get.

5134
03:39:16,220 --> 03:39:17,580
Get it twisted.

5135
03:39:18,540 --> 03:39:20,460
Wow, that's a good reference.

5136
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:21,900
I don't like Coke.

5137
03:39:21,900 --> 03:39:23,580
I don't do Coke, I drink Coke.

5138
03:39:24,780 --> 03:39:26,860
He has luck from strongy believing him.

5139
03:39:28,220 --> 03:39:30,300
Someone please fall out New Vega.

5140
03:39:32,940 --> 03:39:33,740
What, Gamble?

5141
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:35,340
You can Gamble and fall out New Vega?

5142
03:39:35,340 --> 03:39:37,260
Oh, Gamblers stop when they're about to win big.

5143
03:39:37,260 --> 03:39:41,260
So yeah, you're gonna turn the reflins into addicts.

5144
03:39:42,300 --> 03:39:42,620
Yeah.

5145
03:39:46,220 --> 03:39:47,020
Mm-hmm.

5146
03:39:47,020 --> 03:39:48,060
Let's go Gamblin.

5147
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:49,820
Aw, dang it.

5148
03:39:50,380 --> 03:39:51,900
Mummy dad permission to go pee?

5149
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:54,860
No, hold it for five minutes.

5150
03:39:55,820 --> 03:39:57,820
What, you can't last another five minutes?

5151
03:39:58,540 --> 03:39:58,860
Really?

5152
03:39:59,660 --> 03:40:00,940
Hold it for five minutes.

5153
03:40:00,940 --> 03:40:02,780
You can stay a little time on your phone, it's fine.

5154
03:40:03,580 --> 03:40:04,780
If you're gonna ask for permission,

5155
03:40:04,780 --> 03:40:05,740
you're gonna have to wait.

5156
03:40:06,460 --> 03:40:10,620
Uh, Mummy, I really appreciate how you make time for us,

5157
03:40:10,620 --> 03:40:11,660
even when you should be working.

5158
03:40:11,660 --> 03:40:12,620
Even if it's procrastination,

5159
03:40:12,620 --> 03:40:16,140
glad we entertain and give you back a little bit of what you just said.

5160
03:40:16,140 --> 03:40:19,660
No, that's what I was trying to say before I got distracted.

5161
03:40:19,660 --> 03:40:23,100
Imagine helping strongy by giving her 100k for the tip.

5162
03:40:23,100 --> 03:40:26,300
No, don't give me that kind of money, are you stone?

5163
03:40:26,300 --> 03:40:28,780
I wouldn't even know what to do with it.

5164
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:30,620
Typical nation, thank you for the tip.

5165
03:40:30,620 --> 03:40:33,100
No, don't give me this kind of money.

5166
03:40:33,900 --> 03:40:38,780
Don't do that, as I said, for my one year anniversary,

5167
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:41,340
I'm gonna purchase the KU100 microphone.

5168
03:40:41,340 --> 03:40:43,500
It's gonna be out of my money, I'm happy to do that.

5169
03:40:43,500 --> 03:40:45,260
I wanna experiment with that mic,

5170
03:40:45,260 --> 03:40:46,940
and say I'm a real ace, Mars, wink, wink,

5171
03:40:46,940 --> 03:40:49,900
even though I don't have the setup at all enabled for it.

5172
03:40:51,100 --> 03:40:53,900
No, don't do that, don't give me that kind of money.

5173
03:40:55,180 --> 03:40:55,980
Wrap it up.

5174
03:40:55,980 --> 03:40:58,140
That's too much money for one person to have.

5175
03:40:58,140 --> 03:40:59,340
A multiverse?

5176
03:40:59,340 --> 03:41:00,300
I don't think so.

5177
03:41:00,300 --> 03:41:01,820
Too much money for one person to have.

5178
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:03,580
A multiverse, honestly.

5179
03:41:06,380 --> 03:41:08,940
Mommy, you've been playing with the weebaw for like 10 minutes.

5180
03:41:08,940 --> 03:41:10,620
I mean, I can touch it too, so like...

5181
03:41:13,340 --> 03:41:14,940
You can get down here if you like.

5182
03:41:16,540 --> 03:41:17,900
Or does that make it weirder?

5183
03:41:17,900 --> 03:41:19,260
I don't know, 10 of the weirds.

5184
03:41:20,380 --> 03:41:21,580
Supply in.

5185
03:41:21,580 --> 03:41:23,100
You want me to sit on it?

5186
03:41:23,100 --> 03:41:23,980
I don't even know what's...

5187
03:41:23,980 --> 03:41:24,620
Is it gonna...

5188
03:41:24,620 --> 03:41:27,580
If it explodes everywhere, you're fucking cleaning this up.

5189
03:41:27,580 --> 03:41:28,780
Do you understand reefling?

5190
03:41:29,420 --> 03:41:34,060
If this explodes, you are cleaning up.

5191
03:41:34,060 --> 03:41:36,060
All the little balls are about to go everywhere.

5192
03:41:36,700 --> 03:41:37,260
Hold on.

5193
03:41:37,900 --> 03:41:38,220
Oh.

5194
03:41:39,340 --> 03:41:41,260
I can't see it squishing out.

5195
03:41:41,820 --> 03:41:42,540
Just approve.

5196
03:41:42,540 --> 03:41:44,140
Oh, sorry, my duplicate.

5197
03:41:44,140 --> 03:41:46,700
Someone, please think of the health of my duplicate part.

5198
03:41:46,700 --> 03:41:47,500
Thank you, thank you.

5199
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:49,820
Can you see it?

5200
03:41:50,620 --> 03:41:51,180
It's not...

5201
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:52,540
Oh, there's one more card, hold on.

5202
03:41:53,740 --> 03:41:57,740
If this freaking breaks...

5203
03:41:57,820 --> 03:41:58,860
I'm gonna be so mad.

5204
03:42:00,540 --> 03:42:01,660
It's not really...

5205
03:42:04,060 --> 03:42:04,780
Alleycraft?

5206
03:42:07,020 --> 03:42:08,780
It looks like a tail, honestly.

5207
03:42:08,780 --> 03:42:10,620
It looks like a weird marshmallow tail.

5208
03:42:18,620 --> 03:42:21,420
Mami, you're gonna make that reeflings ball explode, honestly.

5209
03:42:22,220 --> 03:42:23,900
Oh, excuse me, I'm just standing up.

5210
03:42:23,900 --> 03:42:25,340
Oh, excuse me.

5211
03:42:26,300 --> 03:42:27,260
That's terrible.

5212
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:33,500
Mami, did you know those balls are wet inside?

5213
03:42:33,500 --> 03:42:34,700
So, last time I'm saying the things,

5214
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:37,980
well, you're cleaning up a cinematic universe.

5215
03:42:37,980 --> 03:42:39,260
It's gonna go hard, honestly.

5216
03:42:40,860 --> 03:42:41,820
She's too good.

5217
03:42:41,820 --> 03:42:43,340
So, you're gonna buy another one then.

5218
03:42:43,340 --> 03:42:44,220
Another ball?

5219
03:42:44,220 --> 03:42:46,540
What, you want me to have two balls to play with on stream?

5220
03:42:47,260 --> 03:42:49,260
I never thought that far ahead, but that makes sense.

5221
03:42:50,060 --> 03:42:51,340
Typical nation thing for the set.

5222
03:42:52,060 --> 03:42:54,380
Someone said, like,

5223
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:56,220
oh, I want to try and repay you for the thingy.

5224
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:57,340
No, you don't understand.

5225
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:58,380
I'm in debt to you.

5226
03:42:59,100 --> 03:43:02,220
Do you understand, like, how happy I am and how fulfilled I am

5227
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:07,900
and, like, just how amazing it is to, like, be with you, like, reefling?

5228
03:43:07,900 --> 03:43:12,140
Like, I don't know how to say it.

5229
03:43:12,140 --> 03:43:13,500
Like, you're not in debt to me.

5230
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:15,020
You don't have to show me any kindness.

5231
03:43:15,020 --> 03:43:17,820
You don't need XYZ, Elemental P, anything like that.

5232
03:43:18,540 --> 03:43:20,940
I'm just fucking happy to be here.

5233
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:22,140
That is the bottom line.

5234
03:43:22,140 --> 03:43:28,140
And the truth is, I'll never be able to repay you for anything like that, you know?

5235
03:43:29,900 --> 03:43:31,500
So don't be, uh, yeah.

5236
03:43:32,540 --> 03:43:35,900
I think you're now tapped for more time than you've spent.

5237
03:43:35,900 --> 03:43:37,660
Opening car, I'm sorry.

5238
03:43:37,660 --> 03:43:38,780
I've yapped, yeah.

5239
03:43:39,740 --> 03:43:40,620
Sorry, I can't sub.

5240
03:43:40,620 --> 03:43:41,900
No, it's not like that.

5241
03:43:41,900 --> 03:43:42,860
You don't have to.

5242
03:43:42,860 --> 03:43:43,660
Like, you don't have to.

5243
03:43:43,660 --> 03:43:45,020
That's why I stream every single day.

5244
03:43:45,020 --> 03:43:46,620
Like, even though I do membership streams,

5245
03:43:46,620 --> 03:43:48,860
it's not like one day I do a membership stream

5246
03:43:48,860 --> 03:43:49,820
and no stream on that day.

5247
03:43:49,820 --> 03:43:53,020
Like, no, I do like a regular, schmagular stream.

5248
03:43:53,660 --> 03:43:56,620
And then, like, because it's not like that.

5249
03:43:56,620 --> 03:43:57,740
Like, don't think it's like that.

5250
03:43:57,740 --> 03:43:59,180
Don't, don't get it twisted.

5251
03:44:00,620 --> 03:44:02,860
What a strongy stream without a good app.

5252
03:44:02,860 --> 03:44:04,220
One PP touch on the debt.

5253
03:44:04,220 --> 03:44:05,020
It's paid.

5254
03:44:05,660 --> 03:44:06,460
I either can.

5255
03:44:06,460 --> 03:44:08,220
I'm currently, no, you don't have to.

5256
03:44:08,220 --> 03:44:09,340
Like, don't think like that.

5257
03:44:12,300 --> 03:44:13,900
My prediction for 5-0 stream.

5258
03:44:13,900 --> 03:44:22,940
He's a tenner for sitting on your ball.

5259
03:44:22,940 --> 03:44:24,620
Did he deserve that?

5260
03:44:24,620 --> 03:44:25,340
Did it hurt?

5261
03:44:25,340 --> 03:44:26,860
But did it hurt good?

5262
03:44:26,860 --> 03:44:28,540
Thank you, basically, Liz, for the tip.

5263
03:44:29,660 --> 03:44:31,340
My predictions for a 5-hour stream.

5264
03:44:31,340 --> 03:44:31,900
What are we at?

5265
03:44:34,940 --> 03:44:35,660
How long?

5266
03:44:36,860 --> 03:44:39,420
It was 3 hours 44 minutes ago.

5267
03:44:39,420 --> 03:44:39,900
The fuck?

5268
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:42,780
Who else has a shit ton of money

5269
03:44:42,780 --> 03:44:43,900
to throw this woman in now?

5270
03:44:45,900 --> 03:44:46,620
Oh my gosh.

5271
03:44:52,620 --> 03:44:55,180
Well, how about we both agree that it goes both ways?

5272
03:44:56,220 --> 03:44:58,060
How much for socks off?

5273
03:44:58,060 --> 03:45:00,220
No, don't give me money for that.

5274
03:45:00,220 --> 03:45:01,020
I'm not sure.

5275
03:45:01,020 --> 03:45:03,420
I've still got my pedicure on my feet

5276
03:45:03,420 --> 03:45:04,540
and I don't like how it looks,

5277
03:45:04,540 --> 03:45:06,300
so I don't like showing my feet right now.

5278
03:45:06,300 --> 03:45:07,980
Typical nation, thank you for the tip.

5279
03:45:07,980 --> 03:45:09,500
Spidey, keep your money.

5280
03:45:09,500 --> 03:45:11,180
Don't fucking give me money.

5281
03:45:12,140 --> 03:45:13,740
Right, okay, okay, okay.

5282
03:45:13,740 --> 03:45:15,180
I'll redirect into Marisa.

5283
03:45:15,180 --> 03:45:19,900
Let's wrap up like a protection layer.

5284
03:45:21,980 --> 03:45:23,660
Well, I'll wrap it up, okay?

5285
03:45:23,660 --> 03:45:27,660
Right, I'm gonna redirect into damn it, I don't...

5286
03:45:27,660 --> 03:45:29,900
Unless Shibi is streaming.

5287
03:45:29,900 --> 03:45:31,260
Shibi, technically, what?

5288
03:45:31,260 --> 03:45:31,900
Should be up in...

5289
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:35,260
Should Shibi be up in 10 minutes?

5290
03:45:36,300 --> 03:45:37,260
Am I going mental?

5291
03:45:39,260 --> 03:45:40,940
No, she doesn't have her waiting room.

5292
03:45:40,940 --> 03:45:42,540
So is Emi going waiting room's up?

5293
03:45:42,540 --> 03:45:44,060
Is this being cancelled?

5294
03:45:46,620 --> 03:45:49,260
I guess it's been cancelled.

5295
03:45:51,420 --> 03:45:52,860
Oh, no, Emi can't stream anyway.

5296
03:45:52,860 --> 03:45:54,140
Dumbass, Emi can't stream.

5297
03:45:54,140 --> 03:45:56,140
That's why the fucking thing can't be cancelled.

5298
03:45:56,140 --> 03:45:57,100
Dumbass, dumbass.

5299
03:45:58,700 --> 03:46:00,540
Okay, I'm gonna...

5300
03:46:00,540 --> 03:46:02,060
No, stop giving me money, I'm going.

5301
03:46:02,060 --> 03:46:03,500
So my money, okay.

5302
03:46:03,500 --> 03:46:06,540
No, Kalker, thank you for the tip.

5303
03:46:07,420 --> 03:46:08,540
Yep.

5304
03:46:08,540 --> 03:46:09,900
No, Emi, who?

5305
03:46:10,940 --> 03:46:13,580
Emi, B-Soup, sorry that you didn't recognize the name.

5306
03:46:13,580 --> 03:46:15,580
Okay, sorry you didn't recognize the name.

5307
03:46:15,580 --> 03:46:16,460
Shibi has the members.

5308
03:46:16,460 --> 03:46:17,980
Marisa is the only one that's been public.

5309
03:46:17,980 --> 03:46:19,260
Okay, I'll redirect into them.

5310
03:46:19,260 --> 03:46:20,220
Okay, look at this.

5311
03:46:26,220 --> 03:46:27,340
This is payment-along.

5312
03:46:27,340 --> 03:46:28,700
I'm just telling you that everything is okay

5313
03:46:28,700 --> 03:46:30,620
while I give you hugs and headpats.

5314
03:46:31,100 --> 03:46:33,900
Oh, that's actually easy.

5315
03:46:33,900 --> 03:46:35,740
Thank you for the donation.

5316
03:46:35,740 --> 03:46:37,020
Right, no more fucking money.

5317
03:46:37,020 --> 03:46:38,140
Stop it, you're stalling me.

5318
03:46:38,140 --> 03:46:39,580
And I don't want to stall for money.

5319
03:46:39,580 --> 03:46:40,620
It makes me uncomfortable.

5320
03:46:41,340 --> 03:46:43,100
Twenty seconds, I really need to wee.

5321
03:46:43,100 --> 03:46:43,900
Okay, go pee.

5322
03:46:45,180 --> 03:46:46,460
Don't read this stream.

5323
03:46:46,460 --> 03:46:48,140
I'm sorry if this comes off as angry.

5324
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:00,300
Okay.

5325
03:47:02,060 --> 03:47:02,380
True.

5326
03:47:03,340 --> 03:47:05,740
Barbecue pulled pork sandwiches or burgers.

5327
03:47:05,740 --> 03:47:07,180
What do you want for dinner?

5328
03:47:07,180 --> 03:47:09,260
Are you making me food?

5329
03:47:09,260 --> 03:47:10,860
Oh my gosh.

5330
03:47:10,860 --> 03:47:11,820
What would you look?

5331
03:47:11,820 --> 03:47:13,260
Beef or pork?

5332
03:47:13,260 --> 03:47:15,100
I would say burgers

5333
03:47:15,100 --> 03:47:17,180
because you can put lettuce on it and cheese.

5334
03:47:18,220 --> 03:47:21,740
I like lettuce and burgers because it's a nice crunch.

5335
03:47:23,340 --> 03:47:24,780
It's so good.

5336
03:47:24,780 --> 03:47:26,540
That reef one had some shit to say.

5337
03:47:26,540 --> 03:47:27,580
Sorry, quietly.

5338
03:47:28,140 --> 03:47:29,580
Jimmy, B-Soup,

5339
03:47:29,580 --> 03:47:32,060
Stronathan, Cthulhu, Cthulhu?

5340
03:47:33,020 --> 03:47:34,140
Cthulhu.

5341
03:47:34,140 --> 03:47:35,340
Oh, Cthulhu.

5342
03:47:35,340 --> 03:47:36,140
That's not bad.

5343
03:47:36,140 --> 03:47:37,340
That's not bad.

5344
03:47:37,340 --> 03:47:37,980
Love you, Stron.

5345
03:47:37,980 --> 03:47:39,100
I love you too, reef one.

5346
03:47:39,100 --> 03:47:39,660
Thank you for the stream.

5347
03:47:39,660 --> 03:47:40,780
No, thank you for the stream.

5348
03:47:42,220 --> 03:47:43,820
I apologize for yapping

5349
03:47:43,820 --> 03:47:45,340
when this was supposed to be a handcam.

5350
03:47:45,340 --> 03:47:47,100
It's literally just my feet kicking a ball around.

5351
03:47:47,100 --> 03:47:48,380
But literally, we're playing footy.

5352
03:47:53,180 --> 03:47:55,420
Strony, you should tell me what to edge to later.

5353
03:47:55,420 --> 03:47:55,980
Me, bitch.

5354
03:47:56,860 --> 03:47:58,780
I have like three audios on the alt square.

5355
03:47:58,780 --> 03:48:01,100
Go, listen to them again and tell me you don't like that shit.

5356
03:48:02,700 --> 03:48:05,340
And it's a nice, yeah.

5357
03:48:05,340 --> 03:48:06,700
But I do enjoy getting that.

5358
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:07,660
Love you, mommie.

5359
03:48:07,660 --> 03:48:08,620
So I'm getting distracted.

5360
03:48:08,620 --> 03:48:09,420
Right, I'm going.

5361
03:48:09,420 --> 03:48:10,220
I'm going to work.

5362
03:48:10,220 --> 03:48:11,580
Right, what do you want me to do before?

5363
03:48:11,580 --> 03:48:12,940
Do you want to like a little dance?

5364
03:48:14,700 --> 03:48:16,140
Or do we pretend that this is...

5365
03:48:17,420 --> 03:48:18,060
I don't know.

5366
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:20,940
What would you like me to do before we go?

5367
03:48:20,940 --> 03:48:21,980
Before we wrap it up?

5368
03:48:21,980 --> 03:48:22,940
Come and walk again.

5369
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:23,820
Here, here.

5370
03:48:24,540 --> 03:48:25,820
I'm Michael Jackson.

5371
03:48:25,820 --> 03:48:27,100
I touch little things.

5372
03:48:27,900 --> 03:48:29,820
Who said that?

5373
03:48:29,820 --> 03:48:30,700
That's wrong.

5374
03:48:30,700 --> 03:48:32,780
How many nostrils does Michael Jackson have?

5375
03:48:36,780 --> 03:48:37,580
Brick down there.

5376
03:48:38,780 --> 03:48:39,500
Put it down there.

5377
03:48:41,020 --> 03:48:42,220
Oh, you can see me thrusting.

5378
03:48:43,180 --> 03:48:44,620
You put your hands on your hips.

5379
03:48:50,220 --> 03:48:51,660
Remove the thoughts and take the...

5380
03:48:52,540 --> 03:48:53,740
I'm not ruining the thoughts.

5381
03:48:53,740 --> 03:48:56,540
My feet size, big monster feet.

5382
03:48:56,540 --> 03:48:57,340
All right, hold on.

5383
03:48:57,340 --> 03:48:58,540
Are you guys going to put Pokemon cards?

5384
03:48:58,540 --> 03:49:00,300
Are you going to put Pokemon cards at home?

5385
03:49:01,660 --> 03:49:05,420
Can you use that Pokemon card?

5386
03:49:07,100 --> 03:49:10,060
Like, if I do it from my heel there,

5387
03:49:10,060 --> 03:49:11,740
I'm like two Pokemon cards.

5388
03:49:11,740 --> 03:49:14,860
And a bit more, like a third Pokemon card comes into it.

5389
03:49:16,140 --> 03:49:17,420
Just a jump to the top.

5390
03:49:20,300 --> 03:49:21,580
Can you join the ace monster?

5391
03:49:21,580 --> 03:49:22,940
Ooh, you're in for a treat tomorrow.

5392
03:49:24,700 --> 03:49:25,340
Okay.

5393
03:49:25,340 --> 03:49:26,380
Oh no, my fucking...

5394
03:49:26,380 --> 03:49:27,580
Oh, my phone's dying.

5395
03:49:28,380 --> 03:49:29,100
Right, wrap it up.

5396
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:29,820
My phone's dead.

5397
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:30,300
Wrap it up.

5398
03:49:30,300 --> 03:49:31,420
The fucking trash is dead.

5399
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:33,980
Wrap it up.

5400
03:49:33,980 --> 03:49:34,860
The track is gone.

5401
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:35,820
The track is gone.

5402
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:37,020
Reeflings, bedtime.

5403
03:49:37,020 --> 03:49:37,660
Bedtime, right.

5404
03:49:37,660 --> 03:49:38,460
Everyone go to bed.

5405
03:49:38,460 --> 03:49:39,020
Go to sleep.

5406
03:49:39,660 --> 03:49:40,860
Do you have a banana for scale?

5407
03:49:42,300 --> 03:49:43,820
The real Pokemon...

5408
03:49:43,820 --> 03:49:45,260
The real measurements are Pokemon.

5409
03:49:45,260 --> 03:49:46,700
Forget kilometers.

5410
03:49:46,700 --> 03:49:49,340
Forget the other unit of measurement.

5411
03:49:49,340 --> 03:49:49,820
Yards?

5412
03:49:51,020 --> 03:49:52,060
Oh god, do you see your...

5413
03:49:52,060 --> 03:49:54,620
No, you can't see your feet are three yards long.

5414
03:49:54,620 --> 03:49:55,820
That doesn't make any sense.

5415
03:49:57,100 --> 03:49:57,660
Truly not.

5416
03:49:58,700 --> 03:49:59,260
Truly not.

5417
03:49:59,980 --> 03:50:01,980
Mommy's falling to sleep on us.

5418
03:50:01,980 --> 03:50:02,300
No.

5419
03:50:03,180 --> 03:50:04,860
It's time to tuck you into bed.

5420
03:50:05,980 --> 03:50:07,340
After I give you the good suck.

5421
03:50:08,380 --> 03:50:09,900
Are you gonna be okay?

5422
03:50:12,060 --> 03:50:13,180
Are you gonna be okay?

5423
03:50:13,180 --> 03:50:16,780
Now strip off and bounce on that peach on my tentacle.

5424
03:50:16,940 --> 03:50:25,820
I love reading your marshmallows.

5425
03:50:25,820 --> 03:50:26,540
Seriously.

5426
03:50:27,340 --> 03:50:29,180
Yours are so out of pocket.

5427
03:50:29,180 --> 03:50:30,780
Like the start of the marshmallow.

5428
03:50:30,780 --> 03:50:33,180
The reason why I read that sentence out loud.

5429
03:50:33,180 --> 03:50:34,540
Strony, you're so sweet.

5430
03:50:34,540 --> 03:50:35,980
You're sweet too, Reefling.

5431
03:50:35,980 --> 03:50:37,740
The love is completely mutual.

5432
03:50:37,740 --> 03:50:39,900
Now strip off and bounce that peach on my tentacle.

5433
03:50:43,420 --> 03:50:45,900
Yeah, my track is down.

5434
03:50:47,020 --> 03:50:47,580
Who said that?

5435
03:50:47,580 --> 03:50:48,780
Who stole my idea?

5436
03:50:48,780 --> 03:50:49,420
Give it back.

5437
03:50:51,580 --> 03:50:54,060
Those five minutes almost made me pee my jeans.

5438
03:50:54,060 --> 03:50:55,820
Then don't ask for permission again.

5439
03:50:56,540 --> 03:50:57,980
Because I'm gonna make you good.

5440
03:50:57,980 --> 03:50:58,300
Okay.

5441
03:50:59,180 --> 03:51:00,620
You get spanking.

5442
03:51:00,620 --> 03:51:03,020
Reef, I love you lot.

5443
03:51:03,980 --> 03:51:07,660
I apologize that this hand cam stream turned into a foot cam.

5444
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:10,460
I would say I'm sorry.

5445
03:51:11,820 --> 03:51:12,860
But am I?

5446
03:51:12,860 --> 03:51:13,500
No.

5447
03:51:13,580 --> 03:51:17,100
I give you the content that you do not ask for nor want.

5448
03:51:17,900 --> 03:51:20,540
And you must be thankful for it.

5449
03:51:20,540 --> 03:51:22,940
You will be grateful for what I provide.

5450
03:51:22,940 --> 03:51:25,580
Even though you did not request it at all.

5451
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:27,580
At all.

5452
03:51:30,700 --> 03:51:32,540
Beat or just the hands of the man.

5453
03:51:32,540 --> 03:51:33,180
That's true.

5454
03:51:33,180 --> 03:51:35,020
I mean you need to bounce on my feet.

5455
03:51:35,020 --> 03:51:36,140
Okay, right, right.

5456
03:51:36,940 --> 03:51:38,140
I love you little Reeflings.

5457
03:51:38,140 --> 03:51:38,620
I'm gonna go.

5458
03:51:38,620 --> 03:51:40,780
I'm gonna redirect into Mercy's karaoke.

5459
03:51:41,100 --> 03:51:42,300
It will be unarchived.

5460
03:51:43,740 --> 03:51:46,540
Just as a heads up because of copyright issues as always.

5461
03:51:46,540 --> 03:51:47,340
YouTube ruins it.

5462
03:51:48,220 --> 03:51:49,900
Thank you everyone for hanging.

5463
03:51:52,620 --> 03:51:54,140
And for chilling.

5464
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:54,940
And binchini.

5465
03:51:54,940 --> 03:51:56,940
Don't you want binchini?

5466
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:57,580
Right on my nose.

5467
03:51:57,580 --> 03:51:58,540
Okay, you're done.

5468
03:52:00,060 --> 03:52:01,260
Please look after yourselves.

5469
03:52:01,260 --> 03:52:04,220
Tomorrow we are getting up to.

5470
03:52:04,220 --> 03:52:06,460
Let's find out what we're getting up to tomorrow.

5471
03:52:07,180 --> 03:52:09,660
We are playing with Portal 2.

5472
03:52:09,660 --> 03:52:12,380
With Sheevee who has never played the game before.

5473
03:52:12,380 --> 03:52:14,380
So don't be a stinker then.

5474
03:52:14,380 --> 03:52:16,540
I can never remember the last few puzzles.

5475
03:52:16,540 --> 03:52:18,460
They get a bit too advanced for my brain.

5476
03:52:19,180 --> 03:52:20,380
But thank you so so much.

5477
03:52:20,380 --> 03:52:22,860
I will see you tomorrow for the shaggagagans.

5478
03:52:22,860 --> 03:52:24,460
Let me and Sheepsters we'll be up to.

5479
03:52:24,460 --> 03:52:26,300
And we're gonna see if we can finish it in one go.

5480
03:52:26,300 --> 03:52:27,980
I warned her it's five hours long.

5481
03:52:28,620 --> 03:52:31,020
But I might be able to remember the puzzles.

5482
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:32,460
I'm gonna give her a blast with it.

5483
03:52:32,460 --> 03:52:34,380
But we can almost come back to it later if she gets the time.

5484
03:52:34,380 --> 03:52:35,100
It's not a problem.

5485
03:52:35,100 --> 03:52:35,660
Not a problem.

5486
03:52:35,660 --> 03:52:37,820
And I know I know these things, okay.

5487
03:52:37,900 --> 03:52:40,060
All right I love you lots I'll see you tomorrow please.

5488
03:52:40,060 --> 03:52:41,100
Remember to hydrate.

5489
03:52:41,660 --> 03:52:42,220
Hydrate.

5490
03:52:43,260 --> 03:52:44,300
Remember to rest.

5491
03:52:45,900 --> 03:52:47,660
Remember to look after yourself.

5492
03:52:49,100 --> 03:52:53,020
Remember to wash behind your ears and your belly button.

5493
03:52:53,020 --> 03:52:54,780
And scrub yourself down with a flannel.

5494
03:52:56,620 --> 03:52:59,900
And remember to eat and be kind to yourself.

5495
03:53:01,020 --> 03:53:01,340
Okay.

5496
03:53:02,300 --> 03:53:03,740
And remember you're still being denied.

5497
03:53:03,900 --> 03:53:08,220
But you enjoy mercy.

5498
03:53:08,220 --> 03:53:08,700
Okay.

5499
03:53:08,700 --> 03:53:10,380
When she comes up she's coming up soon.

5500
03:53:10,380 --> 03:53:11,100
Okay.

5501
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:13,660
But you put you put you.

5502
03:53:13,660 --> 03:53:16,540
That's supposed to be the sound effects from Brian.

5503
03:53:16,540 --> 03:53:18,140
But I don't have the thing plugged in.

5504
03:53:18,860 --> 03:53:20,700
See you later alligator.

5505
03:53:20,700 --> 03:53:22,300
In a wild crocodile.

5506
03:53:22,300 --> 03:53:26,780
And then I'll give you kisses for mimicry.

5507
03:53:26,780 --> 03:53:27,740
I think there was nine packs.

5508
03:53:27,740 --> 03:53:28,460
One clue.

5509
03:53:28,460 --> 03:53:29,100
We want one.

5510
03:53:29,900 --> 03:53:32,620
One, two, three, four, seven, eight, nine.

5511
03:53:32,700 --> 03:53:33,180
Nine packs.

5512
03:53:35,340 --> 03:53:36,220
Okay nine packs.

5513
03:53:36,220 --> 03:53:37,100
Bye bye.

5514
03:53:37,100 --> 03:53:37,900
See you tomorrow.

5515
03:53:39,180 --> 03:53:39,740
I kissed you.

5516
03:53:43,020 --> 03:53:43,820
See you tomorrow.

5517
03:53:43,820 --> 03:53:44,380
Bye bye.
