1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm not happy with you, you know.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Alright, I need to get a chance screen.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I need to get a chance screen.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why is my iPhone bugging the fuck?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, relax.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm bugging out.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Am I getting a chance screen?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Get a chance screen.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, it's not.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Scuffs already started, boys.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Scuffs already started.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Look, he's a, he has a thing.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He has a thing.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
One minute, one month.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was there to do some, some business things.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God, the freaking scuff is a thing.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What the hell's going on?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The tracker is hating me right now.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can you hear me?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Have you all seen this?

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have you all heard about this?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, I think I'm going to have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can you guys hear the background music or no?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, you can now.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can hear a bit of Assassin's Creed.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good morning.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm just calibrating, testing left.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, what the heck?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Can you not see my face?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sorry, blame the technology.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's that?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I should have used my loading screen.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sorry, can't relate.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Couldn't care less.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And something, something.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh my God.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it because it's dark in this room?

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't believe it.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't believe being a goblin in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hold on, hold on.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I need to come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is nonsense.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Honestly.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why can't you see me iPhone?

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm out of the port?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are no keys.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh my God.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right, anyway, I've got some good news.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right, I've got to lay on.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right, I've got to lay on.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right, back and back and back.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, that's snuffing those.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why can, can V-tube Studio not handle how you want them?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why is that going?

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right, I don't think V-tube Studio works at all horizontal.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, fuck you.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You stupid little twat.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
First of all, you little prick.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can it, hun?

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can it not, it can't go horizontal?

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm confused but I'm ready.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know what, fuck it, we're just jumping in.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll, I'll deal with the tracking issues once, uh, hold on, hold on.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fuck it.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, there we go.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm actually normal.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know why the tracking bugging.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm covering up too much of the screen now.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who's ready for someone's house screen now?

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I do believe Asakul is still streaming, so please do support Asakul.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She's still streaming for a white Christmas.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Uh, let me just check before we jump into that.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Need to make sure I've got subtitles on.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Spoken language, English subtitles on.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh my god, I'm such a real gamer.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you ready?

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AC is just ending.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, does she be next?

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think she'd be maybe next.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Her god's EPS soldier.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right, okay.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, actually this is some, oh wait, no.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I, I did all my like, oh, latest, like tipper and all that if you did a donalink to me.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh no.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, you know what?

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Fuck it, we're playing Assassin's Creed, man.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Fuck the money.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to play Assassin's Creed.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Um, I wanted to say something.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know if you guys would like this, but whenever we play a video game, obviously

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
there's names in the video game and, uh, as rid for a feature, but to like name people

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and chat.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I want it to be like special congratulations if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean,

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy, if your name's Ezio, like in the video game.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know, like maybe only the guy names make sense, but I thought that would be a

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
bit different.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Um, yeah, special shout out if your name's Desmond.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Eh, there we go.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Eh, Desmond, that's right, your name is Desmond.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find themselves caught in

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the middle of a war between two secret organizations.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know I do, but here I am.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
On one side-

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can you guys hear the game?

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Better known these days as exturgo industries.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They're in the business of control.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Politics, economics, knowledge-

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey Skull, hope you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm terrible.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm terrible.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm terrible.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Friendsly remainder, we don't have HR, uh, if you-

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Did you enjoy Whim Raider, you little E.P. polar bear?

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I caught the start of you, shtween.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't worry, I'll tell you the lore that you're missing out on, cause I'm rambling on

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the top of it.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ohhhhh.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh my God.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Altair.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Not Altair.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not Altair.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The Templars wanted the location of something known as a piece of Eden.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The HR made-

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go out at night!

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nah, you're done.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go away, manager.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Actually scare me.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They actually can make me graduate.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I always have to be like, my views are not-

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They do not reflect the agency, because my views-

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mm-mm, they shouldn't reflect the agency.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was hoping that would be the end of my misadventures.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have honey tea.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How are the snowberries?

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Piece of Eden?

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Eden D's nuts.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, that was good.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're welcome.

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Da Frenze!

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
My ancestors from their insolence, searching for a path forward.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ahhhhh!

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But me!

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm still here!

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ezio!

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ezio Auditor!

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey, that's from Assassin's Creed 2.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We're gonna play that Lea-

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay, I'm gonna play all Eden.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But we're playing Brotherhoods first.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Take me in between the views of the towns,

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
just to not reflect the agency.

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
True.

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is my story.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh my god.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, I'm getting ready.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh my god, I'm ready.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm so excited to fucking play with you.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sipping my tea.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Tell me if it's too loud or I'm too loud.

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But let's be honest, I'm always too loud.

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If I'm too big, I might need to make myself smaller.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know that.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Would you like me small ewe?

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Me.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is a police dog from Mario.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me hear.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's actually the full dialogue.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We got it.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We did the quick time thing.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The bigger the better.

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No!

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh my god, it's a horse feature bird!

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh my god, it's Oz!

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We're Ezio!

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Serious hooded man.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Watch this.

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're awesome.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Technical difficulties.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh my god.

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I couldn't.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This isn't on Xbox Game Pass,

196
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
so we're not getting any gamerscore from it.

197
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's that?

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Another reason to play this game later?

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Gee, will it hurt?

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I have to tell.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, it's General!

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fun fact.

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So excited to play.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Who is Desmond?

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't understand.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, wait, that's not Italian.

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where did that Italian speak?

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm here, me, Ezio Alditore.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is my favourite bet,

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
because it always glitches out.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The fabric always glitches out on his knee in the scene.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It doesn't matter how many times you play through this game,

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
like it is instance of new glitches going to occur

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
during the cutscenes,

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
but it always glitches out on the knee at that cutscene.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It doesn't matter how many times you play it.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mario, what are you doing here?

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Better to be left in the hands of the earth

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
than in the hands of man.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where's that bloody Pope gone?

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where's that Pope gone?

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Sorry, I'm drinking,

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and then it makes me do hypnosis.

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll just get so excited, okay?

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ah, we're being swallowed alive.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A zirgian taste.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's already occurring.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Are we ready?

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Are we ready?

231
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Are we ready for the best freaking voice line from Mario?

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Better to leave you in the hands of the earth.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ah, it's such a good freaking quote.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's an entire anime.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was worried.

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Quick, we have to get out of here.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, so you can't actually jump up

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
if you do not engage in Eagle Vision.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So we're already in tutorial mode.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you do not engage in Eagle Vision,

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
the game will not let you climb up at all.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But until you engage it.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So we're playing Ezio Auditoria da Frenze,

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
which means he was spawned in Frenze.

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We are already an established assassin, okay?

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We've just defeated the big bad evil in Assassin's Creed 2.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll shut up.

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh my god, right, okay.

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So yeah, we're Italian.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So Babadabopi, oh, that was jokes.

251
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This up next part section.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So we're still in tutorial mode, obviously, the game.

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is because the game perfectly is structured.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's created the sympathy of the only place.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What you're doing.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, that's another good thing.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You condemn what you do not understand.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right, so we can push people out of the way.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Out of my way, out of my way, out of my way.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Rosary beats up your arse.

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Leave me alone.

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Away you go.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mario will actually get caught on those people.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's quite funny.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's your uncle Mario.

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Uncle Mario.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There you go.

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My arm would blurted his attack.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now I want you to remember that pineapple.

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
For no reason at all.

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Remember the pineapple.

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All hail the pineapple.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All hail the pineapple.

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, this next section is how you get one of the easiest

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
achievements in the game.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And it is perfectly sequenced for you to do so.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So look alive.

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is how you get the...

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You haven't...

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're not to get hit.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're not to get hit.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh shit, he knocked them over.

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Right, hold on.

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You wait for them to attack.

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And then if you perfectly execute all these men,

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
then you get your first achievement,

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
which I believe is frenzy.

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But if you do it perfectly, Mario shouldn't.

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Unfortunately, the camera angles are a bit...

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No!

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I lost this straight because of the freaking camera angle.

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Anyway, your first achievement is to kill 10 people in a row.

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You could easily do it at that section of the game,

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but don't worry if you miss it.

297
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There are many opportunities to do so.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The camera angle will...

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Merce you up.

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was going to say,

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Merc you up.

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The camera angle is a bit funny,

303
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
especially when you're in between buildings.

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's telling me to follow Mario.

305
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You must also trail behind Mario a couple of meters.

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you are right behind him,

307
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you will knock him off his coded path.

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The AI will fix itself,

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and he will go back on the path,

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
but you must give him space,

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
or you will knock him off the rooftops,

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and then you have to wait even longer

313
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
for this section to occur.

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But it's fine.

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not a bad section.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is to learn mostly rooftop moving about,

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
how to get your agility sorted.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You kind of get used to holding down.

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I recommend...

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, see, that's another thing.

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sometimes AI say we will do something.

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When you tell him to jump in a certain direction,

323
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's fine.

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This game has aged beautifully,

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and I believe this game came out...

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
2012.

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Skyrim was 2011.

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Again, you can knock Mario off this

329
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
if you're too quick.

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You must be careful.

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It was 2010.

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh my God, I was a baby.

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I remember asking my dad for this game,

334
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and fun fact,

335
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
my dad bought me the special edition,

336
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and it came in a special box.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you opened it up,

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I had the Assassin's logo on it,

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and you opened up the box,

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and the game pops up and presents itself, man.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was freaking good.

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Here's another section.

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If I continue up,

345
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
he does not move.

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you ready for this?

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going to...

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh no!

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You can't progress.

350
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You have to go to the side.

351
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He is in a wall right now

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in the tutorial phase.

353
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, my dad gave me it,

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and I was so happy.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was so lucky.

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, I'm a Sitma fish.

357
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're holding the apple of Eden.

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The page doesn't load if you

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
click the link in the description.

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did I mess up my own donation link?

361
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oops!

362
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, this is a beautiful song.

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, the theme song.

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think that theme is called

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Family Auditore.

366
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's such a lovely song.

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It takes you to just your profile,

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but not the tip page.

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Eepth.

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Eepth.

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Can management...

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can you update my link live on the stream?

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Thanks, management.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So we are now going back to

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Montregion,

376
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
which is the home of the Auditore family.

377
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And we've been introduced to cannons.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Finish my tea.

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Look how much money.

380
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We have 53,000 Florence,

381
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
which was the currency.

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Florence, yes.

383
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So we are now heading back

384
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
from Il Vaticano,

385
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Roma, with Mario on our little

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
horsey-worsies.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And we're about to come back

388
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to our family villa location.

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You can see that we've got the

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Brotherhood, the Assassin's logo

391
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
on top.

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And we've also got

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the Assassin's logo on top,

394
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and Assassin's is very famous in the village.

395
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because he's kind of the

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
back-assit.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Assassin's!

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Assassin's!

399
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I want to meet him!

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Please!

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Enjoy your meal!

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We are going to be home.

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
These places just keep getting better.

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So everyone's very happy to see

406
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Assassin's back.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Thanks to you.

408
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And we also renovated this place

409
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in Assassin's Creed 2.

410
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's your sister!

411
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Claudia.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Claudia.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Claudia.

414
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm so glad to see you with my own eyes.

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The Contessa afford me to

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
welcome you.

417
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The Contessa?

418
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Here?

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
June, you're truly dead.

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
She has a really, like,

421
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
good but bad voice line at later

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
section.

423
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it ruins it

424
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
if you've not played this game.

425
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So, we are assigned

426
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
three.

427
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I repeat,

428
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
three little side quests here,

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and it just kind of shows you,

430
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you know, you can walk around,

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you can walk around in the game.

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you hold the trigger,

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you will do...

434
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh!

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A bit of degradation there, mate.

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That'll do.

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Did you know,

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
to say,

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
push in Italian?

440
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Spingy!

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh, also,

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
it shows a bit of a...

443
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
a bit of a slag.

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
A bit of a Waman's man.

445
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A bit of a slag.

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But then, anybody, then, anybody.

447
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We'll make sure he gets his whole...

448
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, that's actually Scott!

449
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
A second teacher!

450
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
To say get your whole

451
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
means to

452
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
punk a girl.

453
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes.

454
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Sorry.

455
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No one in Town Watch

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
who's such a burden.

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I am sure

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it's the only self

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to be proud.

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You know,

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
he's this big.

462
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Rizio Auditori

463
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
defends

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
it for Renzi,

465
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
for real, for real.

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You?

467
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The party

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
was supposed to be a secret!

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, that's what happens.

470
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Loose lips and all that,

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
both bottom and top, hen.

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Several things.

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hey!

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
She is offering us

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
gratitude

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and services

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
to keep her sealed.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She won't be sealed

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
once I'm

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in the room.

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know what she's like.

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So we have to

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
complete her first quest.

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh, she's touching her chest!

485
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Nipple stimulation.

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, it's always tomorrow

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
with you lassies.

488
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's never now.

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's never...

490
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like, come on,

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
let's go behind the dumpster.

492
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Always the motto

493
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
with lassies, man.

494
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Can I trust them?

495
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The link in description

496
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
has been up to you.

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Just make sure

498
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
in OBS

499
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
you have the audio set

500
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to monitor.

501
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Sure.

502
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll totally do that.

503
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
One

504
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
out of

505
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
three

506
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
side quests, okay?

507
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So you're supposed

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to do the flower girl

509
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
first, okay?

510
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because she drags you

511
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
into the villa,

512
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
like up to the villa, okay?

513
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Fancy a shag

514
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
from A.C.W. himself.

515
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Can I do an Italian accent

516
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
with the Scottish slang?

517
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Fancy a shag?

518
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, I didn't.

519
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It just sounds like

520
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
fancy a shag.

521
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, no toilet time.

522
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh,

523
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Mario's going to murder me.

524
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I have lost

525
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
his favorite horse.

526
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ah!

527
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're tipping!

528
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait, I didn't hear it, though.

529
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I see the tip.

530
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I saw the tip.

531
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I saw the tip.

532
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, hold on!

533
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wait, I just bet

534
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
if you run ahead of the horse,

535
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
you can actually get the horse

536
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
first time in the tutorial section.

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Keep running, keep running,

538
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
keep running.

539
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then if you're Prince Pampi,

540
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

541
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
aw, we missed it.

542
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You can get it

543
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
first time in this tutorial section.

544
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll open up

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the stream elements

546
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
so I can see he just tipped.

547
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, my God.

548
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This frickin' horse

549
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
he always jumps around.

550
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Get on the...

551
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay, there we go.

552
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Horsespeed Tubers,

553
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
dominated.

554
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Check.

555
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ta-da!

556
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But you can't do that.

557
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
World record pace ruined.

558
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Wait, so did you guys

559
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
hear any notification

560
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
of that tip?

561
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I need to go read it.

562
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hold on.

563
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, my game paused!

564
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, my God.

565
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Such a professional streamer,

566
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
by the way.

567
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Stream elements.

568
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay, stream elements,

569
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
sign in.

570
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We hear it.

571
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You don't.

572
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I did hear it.

573
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, you heard it.

574
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Was it loud?

575
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I need to turn it down.

576
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, no!

577
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't have my login

578
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
for stream elements.

579
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can connect it

580
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to my YouTube.

581
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Management that connected

582
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
to my YouTube?

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Or is it...

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No, wait,

585
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that doesn't sound right.

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No, it should be connected

587
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to YouTube.

588
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Stream elements should be

589
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
connected to YouTube.

590
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes.

591
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

592
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay.

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If the stream goes down,

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it's because I'm a fanny.

595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Full stop.

596
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That is the same.

597
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Uh...

598
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Uh...

599
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Can I...

600
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hey!

601
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Wait.

602
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Uh...

603
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wait a minute.

604
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Uh...

605
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Right!

606
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Why is it showing me

607
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
people subscribed

608
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to the YouTube channel?

609
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Terrible.

610
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, it's good that you subscribe,

611
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but it's clogging up

612
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the frickin' thing.

613
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Right.

614
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Save.

615
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I see it!

616
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I see tips!

617
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I see snowpots as well.

618
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Ta-ha.

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Get it?

620
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Anyway, sorry.

621
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Thank you so much.

622
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
6.9.

623
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Assassin's Creed Battle Hood.

624
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Thanks for playing this game.

625
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Uh...

626
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why are you re-thinking me?

627
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is literally my favorite game.

628
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Uh...

629
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Someone called Bajinga

630
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
works now.

631
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Okay.

632
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Congratulations for the four.

633
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you for the tips.

634
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I really appreciate it.

635
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Uh...

636
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Right, okay.

637
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Straight back into the fun

638
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
with just...

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You spend as much time in battle

640
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
as your Uncle Mal.

641
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
My battles have already won.

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I see.

643
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That is good news.

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Arrivederci has...

645
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Arrivederci!

646
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Sorry.

647
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Are you squirming me right now?

648
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Right.

649
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So, you're like...

650
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, the next objective

651
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is up there

652
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and you'll be sitting yourself.

653
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Uh...

654
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I am gonna have to really

655
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
annoyingly

656
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
walk up all these buildings,

657
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
climb them up.

658
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Eh, no.

659
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The game is kind enough

660
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to give you these sandbags.

661
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Up the sandbags you go.

662
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Right.

663
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why can I not hear notifications?

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm actually gonna miss donations

665
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
if I don't have the sound on.

666
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Just give me a second.

667
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll just...

668
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Uh...

669
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Uh-huh.

670
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Uh-huh.

671
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yep.

672
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I know what I'm doing.

673
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Uh-huh.

674
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Advanced options.

675
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay.

676
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Advanced options.

677
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hear me out.

678
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hear me out.

679
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

680
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Monitor.

681
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Monitor only.

682
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Monitor and output.

683
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That sounds right.

684
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

685
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah.

686
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That sounds right.

687
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Um...

688
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Hopefully I'll hear it next time

689
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
if someone is...

690
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wait.

691
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I can repeat the donation

692
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
like a five-head.

693
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, I missed a donation!

694
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Anonymous said,

695
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
how's your day's drawing?

696
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm fucking pop-champ.

697
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hold on.

698
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'mma test this if I can hear this.

699
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Are you squirming me right now?

700
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I hear it!

701
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay.

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I will know when people

703
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
are kind enough to tip.

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Thank you for the tip.

705
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Can you guys do 20 blazes?

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
How's your day?

707
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You're squirming me right now.

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You're freaking poll-grows, man.

709
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Can I write something agency?

710
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What'd you say?

711
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
About the agency?

712
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why doesn't it not display your message?

713
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll need to update that later.

714
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't think I can do it right now.

715
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000

Why are you giving me 50?

That's a lot of money.

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's like...

724
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000

I'm gonna be honest. That's a lot of money. You need to be careful giving me a lot of money

726
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800

Hold on right there. But now I can't see myself. Oh, you know what? You know what? You know what?

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,600
It's your auditory the forensic has hit me. Thank you

748
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,840
Joe Mikar I'll read it over after the sections

749
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
I believe it

750
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Can I tell you a sad story actually really cried like I cried squid me right now?

751
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,640
Hey

752
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,440
Right, I'll read the the random Italian this person thinks I could think I can see

753
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Thank you for listening to my Italian

754
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Oh

755
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,660
El car yes, well, I gotta give

756
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,200
To compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way. How many times did you play the game to know it so well?

757
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,920
The answer is I actually couldn't even count how many times I've played this game

758
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
No, anything killing us is that breath

759
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Take a drink of war

760
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,720
Did you saw my mother in Italian? Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves about this game

761
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
The freaking cannons. So you see how the hit markers there?

762
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,480
It looks like you're gonna hit it and the cannons are like way loud in this game. They're like far too loud

763
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
They're insanely loud

764
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,720
My my foul-ass breath

765
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,560
The guy sounds like a Skyrim guard most video games reuse

766
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,520
Voice actors, so you will recognize people over and over again

767
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,160
It's very common if you work in a video game that you will be used for NPCs for example

768
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:30,200
Or just miscellaneous characters all the time very common Skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors

769
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Being used over and over again

770
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,040
Other than Cicero and Skyrim shout out to Cicero and Skyrim can't remember the actual guy's name

771
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
But goodness greatly

772
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,920
He said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented. Maybe you can teach me a beautiful

773
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,160
Wait, you can't even speak English and you like my accent, bro. You're gonna be in for a shock

774
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,360
My favorite oblivion line. Oh, let me retake that. Let me redo that in the left in the game

775
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,640
Okay, we have now just finished all our three side missions. We have just handled the cannons. Hmm suspicious

776
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I wonder why we have also been able to ride a horse. That's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very

777
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Necessary to X

778
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,400
To explore certain locations and it's just not possible on foot is partly you can do it

779
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
but it just takes up so much time and

780
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,320
We also help the lady which established that it's a auditory is a bit of a bit of a ladies man

781
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,760
And he's out for ladies holes. I mean we're all out for the ladies hole at the end of the day

782
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Hey, hold

783
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
This is outrageous

784
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,020
By Zura by Zura by Zura

785
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,680
There are two major hubs of English voice actors to go from

786
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
So this is Katarina sports. She is a real person

787
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,160
Did occur a very badass personality

788
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Based on a real person

789
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,360
We're like Katarina do Fanny cuz we're getting her

790
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
That's her mummy

791
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,040
That's Marquia Valley recurring character

792
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,400
I wish I could show you the magic she performed very good

793
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,040
Moving painting of the goddess Minerva spoke

794
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,480
Don't have a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future

795
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,560
Give hope of lost temple that will provide a to humanity

796
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,160
Then she called out to a phantom desmond as if you were there

797
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,960
After her warning she vanished

798
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I

799
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Cannot imagine such wonders

800
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,600
Did not house the terrible wet food fear this is good news

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,720
Did she appear human yes, but her words proved otherwise

802
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,880
All of her kind died many years ago. I wish I could show you the magic she performed all of the good delivery good delivery

803
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,240
Where are these temples Minerva spoke up?

804
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,400
Do not know perhaps we must search for them

805
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,800
Tell me how it ended for you did Rodrigo beg forgiveness. Make excuses from his power

806
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,120
No, none of those things the script pulled off another one. I got you pulled up another

807
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,160
Just watching the mirror on her the spaniards

808
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Oh

809
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Some of the voicelines are a bit goofy

810
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,600
Damn straight you don't come Mario here real one

811
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
That's me your uncle Mary

812
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,640
Maria auditory as your mummy big mummy kins. Did you know actually that's a bit sad

813
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,360
Maybe not and we'll just continue to the next part of the sequence. Oh, right ready everyone group session right now everyone get out

814
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:52,000
Not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on

815
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,120
Wait for it wait for it

816
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,000
See this is what happens when you pay for the premium pass at the VL or meet and greet booth

817
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,120
You're presented with a bathtub and then this part is me. That's you okay. That's you in the bathtub. This next bit is me

818
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Yeah

819
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,160
Oh, this for a hundred dollars for the premium pass. Yes, please

820
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Coming at you in my bikini

821
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,280
Welcome home reflin in my accent. Obviously. I'll have to play really put on my accent. Welcome home reflin

822
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Mom is

823
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,040
Do you think a con we would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious

824
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,720
Forgot about that part of the scene. Oh, oh

825
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,960
Like what happens in the ASMR booth stays in the ASMR booth everyone sh okay

826
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,080
Fun fact I played this game in front of my mom and she was mortified at this scene because I was very very young

827
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,600
And I remember playing it at midnight and I had the dining room chair in front of the TV

828
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
My mom let me play it on the big TV

829
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,640
And she was like, what are you playing now? Like it's a sad that's great

830
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Mom, please. I didn't make the game

831
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,800
One should always have the freedom to choose. Oh so salty so salty

832
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, damn train and exercise is out of control

833
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Put in the ass

834
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
Actually, that's another side note

835
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,240
I remember why my dad needed to spell

836
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,320
Oh, I was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years back now

837
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,520
He was like, how do you spell assassin? I was like ass ass in and we both looked at each other like that shrek meme like

838
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Like burst out laughing

839
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Such children honestly

840
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,840
I'm not I'm not gonna lie if I felt like that my ankles would be gone. They would be dust

841
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:35,240
Okay, this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can do everything right and the game will still fail you

842
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
So Mario has the apple of Eden

843
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,440
The one Italian like oh my god, she really likes assassins

844
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
My goodness

845
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,400
Uh to say help and uh, oh no, we lost our monies. It's not about the money money money

846
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
Forget about the money money money

847
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,240
Uh, you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence

848
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
So

849
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,360
The entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and I'm currently singing that one Scottish song

850
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,960
All the horses get back up in this video game

851
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I just what for anyone who doesn't like when the horses go down and with you with that

852
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,960
The horses always stand back up in video in this video game

853
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,960
No horse ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt la la la la

854
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,640
Okay, this is the part I hate you can destroy

855
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,880
All the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can fail the section

856
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I have done it consecutively

857
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,160
All you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore everything else

858
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,400
But the freaking it's really hard to tell. Yeah, see I should have hit that third one

859
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,000
But it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your

860
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,440
Area of effect if you will and my goodness gravy it's frustrating

861
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,600
No horses were harmed in the production of this video game. No, they're not so

862
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Please don't worry. All horses get back up

863
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,600
The aoe area of effect is it's so freaking hard to tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like

864
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I should have three but yeah

865
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,960
And especially the ones on the hill this oh

866
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Beautiful beautiful

867
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,600
Do that again Hen do it again do it again do it again. Give us three. Oh, baby

868
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,160
Right, so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed this one

869
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Boom, baby

870
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,400
Okay, next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can fail

871
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,200
The problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons. Oh triple, baby

872
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,960
Let's go three for three. Obviously. We can't do it for this one because it's not third, but we've got three for three so far

873
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay, wait what that one survived. Hello

874
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Uh

875
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Use me excuse a moi

876
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,360
Do my eyes

877
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,160
So this is the problem. You can't really hit those ones

878
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,800
Now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing. I've forgotten what their legal name is

879
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
But the big brown thing doesn't count

880
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Uh, we can kill it. We've done what we can

881
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,120
So either we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10

882
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,720
five

883
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,280
We did it. We didn't get a ballista a siege tower. I

884
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,560
Soldiers are climbing the walls

885
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,160
Okay, this is one bit. I don't like about this game. You ready for this

886
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,880
They change your weapons. So they've given me a sword. I've said, uh, let me keep my blade out because

887
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
I prefer fighting with a blade the only

888
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,920
Enemies that you're not to go against with the blade jump down. Oh, jeez

889
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,040
Yeah, my ankles would be disintegrated if I did that

890
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,200
um

891
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,840
It's much easier to fight with the blades. Oh my god

892
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,760
He just curbstomped that borgia guy. Did you see that encio? That's a war crime. You can't curbstomp people

893
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
That's not how it works

894
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Jesus etio

895
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay, hold on

896
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,840
These enemies. Oh my god, I just got twatted. Oh, I'm getting twat twice. Sorry. I'm too busy trying to be chatting

897
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,840
Kill at the same time. Um, no, I'm missing. Oh, no, everyone's gonna know I'm a terrible gamer

898
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,640
Um, the only enemies that are not effective. So like these guys for fuck's sake

899
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,840
They freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming. It's not a problem

900
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Again, you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out boom

901
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,960
It didn't register it. See, oh, he's getting a bit close mate. You're gonna need to aim

902
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
That was kind of it close for comfort

903
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,440
Point blank etio that probably wasn't even five meters. No been do we need to put glicks on them?

904
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Oh, this is a sad bit

905
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Of assassins

906
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,000
This is an invitation my family to yours

907
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I

908
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Like that part

909
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,200
There is a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for us keep that in mind

910
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,120
I can walk faster means to stop in Italian

911
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
So we are now

912
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,560
Basically running on fumes adrenaline wise. We've literally just been absolutely

913
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,880
Destroyed we have three bullet wins. I think shoulder

914
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,960
Uh abdomen. Oh, okay. Just to show we've got two bullet wins. I could have sworn it used to be three

915
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,520
But I'm probably just wish me remember being

916
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:06,760
Uh, but yeah, we've literally our liver is currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow. What happened there?

917
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,440
Did you see me get turned into that rubbish pile? I was like liquid. Did you see that?

918
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,600
Ouch, I don't want to be jelly. Please don't turn me into jelly

919
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,760
Hey leaf cloudia lonia bam

920
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:32,840
So you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence, but they all do they all are aggressive towards you

921
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,680
You can clean them up if you really desire

922
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,320
But if the arrow is red that means the ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack

923
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,360
Oh, also the guards have assassin abilities. Look how he's sitting on the wall

924
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:55,880
The coding in this game is a bit funny. Um, if you upset NPCs, they turn into assassins and start climbing walls

925
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,400
and stuff

926
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,360
You could always break a guard stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them

927
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,760
But we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly. Um

928
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,880
But yeah, uh, you can ignore all these I think and just go straight in here. No you can't

929
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,320
You have to wait until they're assigned to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. The game does it quite often where it won't

930
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,440
Let you in

931
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,680
If someone is target locked onto you

932
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,520
Hey, come on Claudio ain't go all day. Jesus. We're under a siege. Take your time hen

933
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,640
Ezio, I'm in here. I will hold the back. Stop wait for us

934
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,400
We thought you had to kill sir Ezio. Not yet. Where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls?

935
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,520
Are you surprised it exists? I might have to open my door. Um, I must go help the troops

936
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,880
My freaking room is getting so hot with this computer

937
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Ah

938
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,440
I'm coming. So we're currently inside the Auditori villa. We're now going down down down down deep inside

939
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,120
Down deep inside see how do you pick me?

940
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm sweating um, I'm sitting on my sweaty feet right now. I don't know how you guys sit in your chairs, but I sit on my feet

941
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Oh

942
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,520
We will play Assassin's Creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in Assassin's Creed 2

943
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,400
We're essentially playing Assassin's Creed 2.5. It's fine brotherhood's good game

944
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,800
Right lore lore. I'm gonna take a war sip water sipping then take a sip with me if you're not got war

945
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Oh

946
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
The horse was a paid actor

947
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,040
I'm not flexible enough to sit on your feet. I'll make you flexible once I've done me

948
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,880
Sorry

949
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Hmm

950
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
We're actually speedrunning

951
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,280
Just love this game all over everything about it. The patience fantastic. We've completed sequence dna one

952
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Battle wounds achievement unlocked

953
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
Lucy, I can't seem to get a position

954
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,600
Poe could one of you tell me what's going on

955
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,600
Sorry

956
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,160
I will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now

957
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,680
But only at the end

958
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Right, so that says in present day

959
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Congrats if your name's Desmond

960
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Congrats

961
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,360
Congrats if your name's Sean Sean's one with glasses. Congrats

962
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm convinced we need to get our hands on Ezio's apple of Eden

963
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,640
Minerva altered it somehow when she are the tame traveling

964
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,280
We're at the Alti Torre Zilla. I will tell you in a second. It's our last safe, but we were present day

965
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
It turns out the Templars are watching the border

966
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,520
Ezio hid the poe sometime in 1507, but when I try to access that dna sequence

967
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,040
He seems to be remembering something else

968
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,200
Like a memory inside a memory. Yes, exactly

969
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,280
Maybe exactly maybe I believe you experienced something similar back at obstaga, didn't you?

970
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,080
Subject 15 exhibited memory within memory like patterns, but she was pregnant

971
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,520
The memories of prego's father and mother not in this was

972
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Desmond's not pregnant

973
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh my god, we've just been fat shamed in 2024

974
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,320
You guys remember when Bal got that model and she was like inflated and someone was like

975
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,280
This is fat shaming. I was like, no, bro. That's real 34 open your eyes

976
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,480
That's crazy that either that or rebecca's is not a very good engineer. Thanks asshole

977
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,880
Imagine coming out with an inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming. No mother fucker

978
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:32,920
Ages ago the waves go through everything above brown. They're gonna find us. No, they aren't come with me

979
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Oh

980
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,320
There's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead, but I'll try and for those who don't know the game I will very quickly summarize

981
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,640
From the inside we're not getting in this way

982
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,480
What's her next move the road just moves back into the highway. This is not a good place for us to be right now

983
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,920
Do we have any tarps? We need to cover up the van. I really hate to stress this yeah, but we are running out of time

984
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,400
That's Sean. We'll help us. That's Rebecca. That's Lucy any ideas?

985
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,160
I don't know. Maybe there's another way into the sanctuary. Hey, I think I've got something

986
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,560
Okay, so we're modern-day Desmond if you don't know the game

987
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,680
Uh, we basically have a special bloodline

988
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,960
That commutes to the gods that created us

989
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:37,320
Um, and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go back in the past very fictional based. Uh, I

990
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,520
Absolutely loved the concept when I was a child and I wanted it to be so real

991
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,280
I was like take me back to the battle of anaconda

992
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Take me to big willy walrus

993
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,440
I want to see the construction

994
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,200
So we are like the trunk. I'm sorry. I don't know what the trunks are

995
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,680
Memories are stored in DNA. Yes. That's the quickest way. Oh my god me and Lucy

996
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,880
Oh

997
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,760
Oh, yeah, you know how to have fun you'll have fun with me the night Lucy

998
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,920
Okay, there we go. Oh, that was a loading screen by the way, it looked like it wasn't they were trying to hide it

999
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,160
What was that?

1000
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,960
So Desmond also sees the past because his it's basically leaking into his present

1001
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,400
So Lucy can't see any of this we can see this

1002
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:06,440
They escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack I can see them now

1003
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,200
I know it's difficult, but try to compartmentalize focus on the present

1004
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
What if I can't stop the visions?

1005
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,000
How long before I start painting symbols on the walls?

1006
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,640
Don't joke about that. Subject 16 had the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself

1007
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,520
But we learned more about him in Assassin's Creed 3

1008
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,200
Well the animus he does to a man

1009
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,640
Please do not refer to the animus that lets us go back into the past is the animus

1010
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,080
Oh

1011
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,920
Is a revelation not unless you want me to end up like that skeleton always

1012
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
I'll find a way around

1013
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,640
Always revelations, you're right. Sorry, my apologies. I apologize

1014
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,600
I would say this is a revelation

1015
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,720
Do you guys remember Dan bull's cover of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood revelations?

1016
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,920
I meant if you see any

1017
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,520
So we are now backtracking our way of sort

1018
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,960
This is the problem. There's so much dialogue in this game at the start

1019
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,720
And we are now backtracking trying to get back inside the villa

1020
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,560
Oh no, Claudia, that's our sister

1021
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,480
Just joined. Why is he wearing jeans? We're in present day. Actually. Yeah, could you jump about in jeans?

1022
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,160
I don't even wear jeans. I don't even wear clothes after time actually

1023
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,440
Do you want to guess what clothes I'm wearing right now? Because it's not what you think

1024
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Okay

1025
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,520
We are selling tutorials, so it's a bit slow, but

1026
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,720
Okay

1027
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,480
Um, I just wear a bra and a hoodie

1028
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:22,280
That's it. So my bear arms is on my game and chair right now with my sweaty feet as well

1029
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,680
They never stop sweating neither do my hands. My hands are very sweaty right now actually, but they don't sweat as much as my feet

1030
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,000
I'm sorry. I don't I don't think I don't care. I'll show up about that

1031
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,280
Oh my marriage

1032
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,920
Oh, I have marriage oopsies forgot to talk about that. I have marriage if you want to support me

1033
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,080
I'm getting key chains with the girls and we're I'm going to make a little key chain ASMR

1034
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,440
So the thing about this cutscene you have no health so you can literally just do that

1035
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,280
You can't die in this cutscene in this section of the game

1036
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,880
It's not a cutscene. It's a section again. You can just drop down

1037
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,400
When did this become I wish I wish you

1038
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Nice try ready

1039
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,560
God well, do you see such a skinny legend on this one found a switch

1040
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,800
Oh, no, no don't do that. That's morey. Here we go

1041
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
Something's open

1042
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Yeah, my leg. Hey, yo

1043
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Absolutely brain

1044
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
So he shouldn't have said this line yet because

1045
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,320
Oh

1046
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,520
I've never had that happen before I got pushed out the way by the shadow

1047
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,160
Oh my god, I've never had that happen before the shadows are freaking I wonder if you can attack the shadow

1048
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,920
I've never been pushed out the way by the shadow before

1049
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:10,040
See this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic

1050
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,240
Anyway, we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste

1051
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,200
The game's being coded as you play

1052
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,200
Toxic waste it was Lucy's idea

1053
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Oh

1054
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,840
You're exaggerating

1055
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:35,000
Whoa, whoa, uh, see when the camera angle start to shift it actually makes things like really hard to judge

1056
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,320
It's good for the skin

1057
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,920
Remember the that one post where that guy was like

1058
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:48,920
For $500 let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was like, oh you're

1059
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,240
I mean

1060
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240
Yeah, that was quite the post

1061
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Wait

1062
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You're going so fast the game can't keep up

1063
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,600
That was minging honest

1064
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,960
Oh my god, it's you no it's you Desmond. Did you just ask a woman why she's not wet?

1065
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,320
That's sexual harassment, honestly water check

1066
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Oh, I just fell water. Oh well, it's fine

1067
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:29,560
I'm sorry. It like cold water just went on my leg and I'm like, ah, you know, that's fine. It's actually not that big a deal

1068
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,800
Jesus, you know, that's brutal making someone fall to their death

1069
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,520
Now I'm wet. I'm a cuttlefish. I was wet from the start

1070
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:51,000
Human resources. Why is septic tank? It's just what the guy wanted. It's like that Japanese post

1071
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,240
Oh, this is another thing. There is this is a true

1072
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,080
hashtag

1073
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,120
story

1074
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,480
and

1075
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,920
So this wife went away on holiday for the weekend

1076
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,200
And her neighbor on Friday

1077
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,800
went into her like toilet tank

1078
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,640
Like Japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done

1079
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,280
So he could look up and peep at her while she disintegrated basically

1080
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,680
Um and because she went away on holiday, uh, that man

1081
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,920
perished

1082
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,960
via

1083
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,440
I'm freezing to death in kaka

1084
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,080
I was like, bro

1085
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,120
Don't get me wrong. I'm no really

1086
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,280
Shame in anyone for what they like, but to die

1087
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,680
To die

1088
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,680
I'll wait here. It's a bit extreme

1089
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,560
It's a bit extreme

1090
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,160
Oh g-san messed up on that one. I'm not gonna lie. Oh g-san

1091
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
Yeah

1092
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,800
Did they scatter his ashes?

1093
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,800
That's too funny that I can't even laugh at that. That's awful. That's awful

1094
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,160
Oh my god, that was so quick-witted

1095
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Damn

1096
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,840
Thanks

1097
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,120
Anyway, the sequence is just teaching us the relationship that et-sio has with lucy

1098
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,800
Ed Desmond has with lucy jesus. I have the bleeding effect myself

1099
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,480
No, no before you freaking take that out of context. The bleeding effect is when Desmond thingy's

1100
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,720
Oh, uh, Veechabur's stomach is sore. It must mean they're they're just a ketchup packet. No

1101
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,960
Stop it with the ketchup packet allegations. Okay

1102
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,160
Veechabur's can't beat them enough. My goodness

1103
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:52,440
Veechabur feels mildly ill. Oh, she must be a ketchup packet. You stop that right now naughty naughty

1104
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,640
Stop it

1105
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,720
It's all right, I'm a mustard pat it comes out yellow. Hello

1106
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,240
Oh, should I be worried? Do we need to get you a doctor?

1107
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,320
When the past memories and new ones melt in yes Desmond has a very hard time

1108
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:26,200
Differentiating himself from et-sio because he spends so much time in the animus as et-sio. I mean you'd do it too

1109
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,720
You'd do it too. You'd do it too. All right friendly over the section

1110
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,080
Oh my god, it's the back of the statue

1111
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,160
Repeat after me stat you that's how you say statue in scots stat you

1112
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
No tea stat you

1113
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
Oh, I guess there is a tea technical

1114
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,680
Well, I'm as if you die in the animus and you just perish

1115
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,680
No tea I've finished

1116
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,680
Wow weapon ice gets free

1117
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,920
True

1118
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,080
Et-sio must have come back here way after the attack

1119
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,040
But why

1120
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,040
Desmond

1121
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:27,240
Desmond let's open that door. I think big dizzy. Here's like, hmm big easy big as you all the touring

1122
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:36,280
You have any fizzy juice, no, I might get a cola later, but right now I'm I'm high. I'm high is okay

1123
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,080
I'm literally playing my favorite game of all time. I'm allowed to just word vomit and do whatever I please

1124
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:48,440
Life is good. Bruv. Bruv. Life is good. I'm happy. I hope you know this experience is enjoyable

1125
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,800
Don't apologize about burps. I don't burp much with water, but hey

1126
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,960
Can you open the damn bookcase Desmond says Sean as I cut over his voiceline

1127
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,120
Yes, et-sio has three things

1128
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,720
Assassin's Creed to Assassin's Creed brotherhood and Assassin's Creed revelations are all et-sio elder towards storyline

1129
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,760
Numbers Mason. Oh my god, we need to play black ops

1130
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,720
In 1421

1131
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,320
Oh my head, are we? That's all right Desmond has a boo boo

1132
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Let's get the animus down there

1133
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,840
You're gonna create an entire corporal weirdo. Hey

1134
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,240
Uh, um was watching the everyone's 2.0's

1135
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Uh lurking in the shadows

1136
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,480
I'm so happy. Make sure you aren't followed

1137
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,920
What is that smell?

1138
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,080
It's my clothes. It was Lucy's idea. I smell like you swam through a sewer

1139
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:08,200
It was Lucy's idea. It was Lucy's idea. Wait a second guys. You need to remember the there's a line right?

1140
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,760
Is that confliction in his voice going? That's the word

1141
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,920
Oh

1142
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,000
My name rule one suck you are the king

1143
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,600
Oh the girls they're absolutely fantastic in their 2.0's absolutely adore them

1144
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,560
um

1145
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,680
like

1146
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,320
Obviously, I'm happy to talk about like some behind the scenes stuff

1147
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,520
But like they were kind of shocked that I'm like, yeah, just do what you want

1148
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,240
Like whatever you want go for it. You can say what you want

1149
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,480
Obviously, as long as you don't see any nda content, you can talk about the interview with me if you want

1150
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,480
You can talk about how you found the process

1151
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,120
Talk about how you found debut

1152
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,160
Um, yeah, just do what you want and have fun. I'm here to be a booty hole

1153
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,800
Right look around Montoregioni for circuitless

1154
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,600
That little dude asked they'll re-wrote small amounts of electricity to the power line underneath the villa

1155
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,200
Don't ask me how they work if I understood that I wouldn't be the fellow hide in the van

1156
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,440
I

1157
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Used to think

1158
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
He is he Wheatley?

1159
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,280
I think he might be Wheatley. I'm not sure from

1160
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,880
a

1161
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,880
portal to

1162
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,960
So we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus underneath the villa

1163
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:32,120
In order for upstairs go the big baddies are called upstairs go in this game or templates. Those are the big baddies

1164
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,160
Um, so basically you just need to go around the city

1165
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,240
You can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago

1166
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,960
That the big old fights were occurring. I really like stacey milk. Yeah

1167
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,800
I saw the reaction to fondle a bosom

1168
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:57,560
Admit that it was funny. Okay. Admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now

1169
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:04,360
And anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars. Okay fondle a bosom was hilarious. I don't care

1170
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,360
I think someone was like it sounds like you're naming them from like that parody

1171
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,600
um

1172
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
That parody movie

1173
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:19,960
Uh austin powers and I'm like, yeah, you're supposed to have fun names. Who wants serious names that like no one can remember

1174
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,560
like

1175
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:28,600
Cuttles cuttlefish. Okay, so any cuttles. Let's go. Uh, a polar bear. Okay. I see I see still pause. Yes. She has pause

1176
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
And she's cold. I see stop us. Let's go

1177
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,640
Like it's really it's not that bad

1178
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,920
Um, so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense of moving around. Um

1179
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:46,120
And all that jazz there's like one right next to me. Isn't there yet? It's right behind me. Uh box

1180
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,080
I vana humpullo

1181
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,600
Hey

1182
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,200
That was not a name karambi. No karambi for like a cs gov each of her

1183
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,800
Perfect name. Don't care karambit. Yes

1184
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,120
And karam sounds like haram so you can probably make a few puns

1185
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,320
Yes, it's booted

1186
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,560
Name from money python's life of brian incontinent above

1187
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,000
African saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot

1188
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,960
I was like, oh no, they've got me laughing. I was like, oh, that was actually really funny

1189
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,880
All right, we're going in the animus

1190
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,840
We're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory if we're still in the tutorial stage

1191
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,240
I will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage. Uh, we've still probably got another hour and a bit

1192
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,360
sanctuary

1193
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:45,480
As you may have noticed in the van, I've made some improvements to the animus and have a new vr training program

1194
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,360
Here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors

1195
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,600
Let me open one in the mission

1196
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,120
AC show

1197
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,800
AC hall

1198
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,920
Okay, but it doesn't make sense. Maybe if we had like a fire and ace like v tripper just saying ac

1199
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:07,000
No, we can't like call ac. We already have ac. Oh, oh shit. Okay. So this is the virtual training. I despise it

1200
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I absolutely despise it

1201
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,560
I just cannot stand this section. It's for people who enjoy the combat or practicing it me

1202
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:21,320
I hate it. I despise it. Okay. You see that skinny guard? He is a problem

1203
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:28,840
They can grab you. Yeah, see the guards are trying to grab me and then it breaks your streak if they grab you and so annoying

1204
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:36,520
I freaking hate the we guards. Honestly. Oh, and I hate the Lancers too. I absolutely hate it. I'm much better in combat

1205
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Yeah, fuck you. Take it

1206
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,560
Take it the Lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter

1207
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:49,320
So when you're on a killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically

1208
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,480
Skinny ball bad guards. Oh, honestly

1209
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,360
Lancer hates the skinny guards hate because they are agile warriors

1210
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,320
And you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly

1211
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,240
Shrimp check. Yep posture still shrimp. Thank you

1212
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,280
Oh, we're in the tutorial for like another two hours

1213
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,960
But the reason I'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial

1214
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:27,080
You progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like I know that sounds silly to praise that because obviously all games work like that but

1215
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
I'll kind of

1216
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,720
You can leave the machine whenever you like

1217
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,520
I'm all set to go. Don't worry

1218
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,560
One last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing events

1219
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,800
repressed memories

1220
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,520
You might even discover some repressed memories. She be caught in bottom. Okay, let's get started

1221
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,640
Ass and feet locked on that seat. Oh, that's actually a really good like model

1222
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Ready for like an eight hour stream

1223
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,920
Ass and feet get on that suit

1224
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,560
Anyway, I never expected you to see you play something. I have terrible news, but these should personally play a video game

1225
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Subjects, dude

1226
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,240
Okay, we're here present day

1227
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:35,400
Give me one second. I'm gonna get a cola. Okay, I'll leave it on so I'm least I'm not yapping over the actual cutscenes for once

1228
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Oh

1229
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,880
Sorry, I forget my hip. I need to close my eyes if I walk away so the sleep thing clicks on right but

1230
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,960
Come on me. Come on me. Oh my god. Listen to the music

1231
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Beautiful

1232
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,920
Oh gorgeous

1233
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,520
Roma

1234
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,600
Yes

1235
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,280
I just got chills

1236
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,720
Such an idiot. I just love this game so much

1237
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,720
I just feel like so full of it like my heart feels so full. I get to share this game and

1238
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,560
Just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010

1239
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:06,040
And it aged beautifully. I will not tell I will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well

1240
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:13,480
So we're currently injured and going to the doctor. We're about to learn about health bar. So we're still injured

1241
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,240
We're still hurt

1242
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,400
In the top left corner. We have five health squares and only one left

1243
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,360
That is how we deal with health in the game. Do not take that horse

1244
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,760
I don't know why they put that horse there unironically

1245
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,800
You don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer

1246
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,400
Trying to tip you it says internal server. It's okay. You don't have to give me money. Just hanging out. It's fine

1247
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,360
Hey, I'm not sure about the problem is but hey

1248
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,160
But don't worry. You don't have to give me money. Thank you very much

1249
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,800
For a man of your age. Tisk, tisk

1250
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Four out of five doctors would suggest leeches

1251
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,920
No leeches

1252
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,800
However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the sea

1253
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Do you need anything else?

1254
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:15,560
Have fun at work. Don't worry guys. If you ever have to leave stream. I am an endurance streamer. I'm not very friendly

1255
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,840
Long time streamer. Um, I do plan on streaming for eight hours or finishing the

1256
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:31,720
Story mode of this game and tomorrow we will 100% it because I've never 100% of the game before but with your

1257
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,080
Encouragement, I think it's possible. I think I could 100% this game

1258
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,920
When you collect all the board your tower like the flags

1259
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,840
um

1260
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,560
All the hidden flags that are also in the halls of nero, which I will teach you all about very shortly

1261
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,160
So this

1262
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:55,640
Beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD. Okay, they're all hidden at the moment

1263
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,440
But we are going to be doing map update as you can see

1264
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,840
Uh synchronized view points beauty beauty beauty

1265
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,560
It talks on you. I'm listening at work. Oh my god. Oh, those are the naughty naughty

1266
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
Stinky borgia

1267
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:21,320
We don't like borgia. We don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borgia

1268
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:29,480
100% in this game in two days possible. Yes, sir with autism anything is possible

1269
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,240
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I apologize

1270
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,920
Um

1271
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,400
I am very passionate about what I'm passionate about and if I am like unable to do so

1272
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,960
So ie I can just straight up like play this game the way I want to then yes

1273
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,400
We're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one

1274
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:55,560
I'm so sorry. It must be like really weird. Just randomly come out with it. I'll

1275
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,480
We'll refer to the strontism. How about that? So we're currently tailing. Do you see the yellow hit marker or hitbox above these?

1276
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,440
This is tailing. It means do not be discovered by them

1277
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,800
They can be pushed by NPCs so they can turn around and look at you. It's not um

1278
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,160
It's not the best but it certainly works perfectly well

1279
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,200
It's absolutely beautiful game

1280
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:28,120
So we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards unless an NPC kindly bumps into them

1281
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,320
So we can get as close as we want. We can like creep on the walls

1282
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,440
Cece he just turned around there if I wasn't creeping on the wall

1283
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,440
Even the game's like uh, you should maintain your distance. You're a bit too close, but we can like creep

1284
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,440
Creeping

1285
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,760
Okay, and you can also blend in but I am not controlling the movement of this crowd

1286
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,400
The crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered

1287
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,640
While concealed in a crown like this guards can walk by me

1288
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,640
I can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as long as I am

1289
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,360
100% in the achievements in skyrim, sorry

1290
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:24,040
I don't mean 100% in skyrim because that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors

1291
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,720
The achievements I have 100% at skyrim achievements

1292
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:33,480
Uh multiple times and I would absolutely love to share the experience with you and tell you about all the secret

1293
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,200
little bits I know

1294
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,800
And yeah, okay

1295
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,640
I'm also going to mention the multiplayer and brotherhood. I believe the servers are down

1296
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:50,200
Okay. Oh, whoa. That just came out nowhere. Hold on. Hold on. We weren't even at the we were not even at the section

1297
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Okay, we didn't even go

1298
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,440
We were

1299
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,480
And see I didn't kill civilians. Did I kill a human?

1300
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,280
Like a non-guard

1301
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,040
What is going on?

1302
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,440
Oh my god, sorry. The sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase

1303
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,240
It's supposed to start by the freaking did I kill him if I'm a citizen?

1304
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,600
Uh

1305
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,640
What just happened? I think I was too distracted. I apologize

1306
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,720
But don't worry. We can always replay and come back for 100%

1307
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,120
I can't believe I just killed a citizen

1308
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,320
I never make that mistake in this game

1309
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Sorry

1310
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,040
I too have lost family to the rope

1311
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,080
Treachery you called you cuddled off

1312
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
When you are what the fuck go down

1313
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,480
Sorry, you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen

1314
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,880
I was like, these are too many things going on right now. Okay, so

1315
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,400
This quest do you see how we are assigned someone with a name?

1316
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,400
That is because you're actually killing multiplayer characters

1317
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,320
That are in multiplayer. I know it sounds silly and I know it sounds bizarre, but

1318
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,720
When you could play Assassin's Creed brotherhood multiplayer

1319
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:40,120
You got to pick between the skins and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode

1320
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,360
100% for this one is just air assassination. Super simple and easy

1321
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:50,600
The guards do attack you but some turn into cowards once you kill multiple guards, which is a lovely

1322
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,480
PayPal support doesn't open for several hours

1323
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
Did I break PayPal?

1324
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,800
Oops

1325
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,160
Are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke PayPal?

1326
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,320
Wait, can none of the girls get donations right now?

1327
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,560
Uh, so you can be grabbed but as I said the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones

1328
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Like the ones with just a hat will turn into cowards, which is an absolutely lovely human detail

1329
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:25,400
Yeah, see the ones with those like beret type hats they turn into cowards

1330
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,720
Beautiful

1331
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:34,200
Beautiful detail. I think that is gorgeous to show human nature instead of the AI

1332
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:42,520
Just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die because you will I just think these are and this is 2010

1333
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:50,280
Development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even as far back as 2007

1334
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,240
Um, so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops

1335
01:17:53,720 --> 01:18:00,280
Because guards find you extremely sussy, but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now

1336
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,280
um

1337
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,080
But like for development that far back to like capture

1338
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:12,280
To even think outside the box to capture human nature like that definitely hats off to the development team

1339
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,520
Um, I know it is by ubi soft and there are some very there's a very unique

1340
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:25,160
Ending to this tale and Assassin's Creed brotherhood and I couldn't for the life of me

1341
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,880
There's a feather up on here by the way

1342
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,040
You can grab

1343
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,880
Sightings if you cite something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map

1344
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,360
Which is fantastic. So if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment. Um,

1345
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,320
But yeah

1346
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,520
This game has also been rated

1347
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,560
In the top 100 games of all time

1348
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,680
I believe it placed around 60th on recent 100

1349
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,400
Game ranking type things

1350
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:03,560
But Assassin's Creed brotherhood always makes it and I 100% agree for me it is first place, but I'm biased

1351
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:09,160
But absolutely deserved it. So we have met marquiovelli. This is marquiovelli. He was the guy

1352
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,320
Um, that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us not killing the spanyard

1353
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:22,280
Uh, and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know what's going on in roma

1354
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:27,160
We know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front of us right now

1355
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,480
So we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma

1356
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,320
Yeah

1357
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Borja hate we hate the borja

1358
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,440
I'm gonna burp is that okay

1359
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,760
That was me popping my lips. That was the actual burp. Sorry. Sorry to mislead you like that

1360
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,200
So you need to wait for a little second, uh, because if you go too quickly into the

1361
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,280
Blacksmith

1362
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,600
Uh, the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest

1363
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,840
So you're buying an armor and a small weapon

1364
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:26,920
This small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself

1365
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,920
Now you can survive that's right. That's right. I debated you didn't know. Yeah, you thought that pop was my burp

1366
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,920
And

1367
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:02,520
So for some reason even though you're right next to him he gets really quiet in certain voicelines

1368
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,920
Cruel beyond the magic

1369
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
The laws of men mean nothing

1370
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,800
He murdered his own brother who takes power. He knows neither danger nor fatigue

1371
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,880
Those who do not fall. I'm literally hugging him to get him to talk

1372
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,480
Jar of leeches head of the people

1373
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,560
What does he intend to do with his power?

1374
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,040
so again

1375
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:36,760
Eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now, but that's okay

1376
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
Okay, so we're starting to learn

1377
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:01,080
That the Borgia has overtaken roma and is completely messing it up for the people

1378
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:09,320
And mark you avail is obviously not very happy, but we have to do what the current laid-out rules are

1379
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,280
and

1380
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,080
Yummy jar of leeches

1381
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,080
The cuttlefish eat leeches. I feel like they probably do

1382
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,080
I'll talk after this bit

1383
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,680
Water check

1384
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,040
large

1385
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,840
Okay

1386
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,400
Now to very quickly bring you up to speed

1387
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:07,000
The Borgia are forbidding us in this section to use the stables and other areas of development

1388
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Also, this is the most fucking annoying

1389
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:16,440
Thing to get 100% on hold on. Oh get off the horse. I hate when they go on the horse

1390
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,800
Oh, no, I've made it so much worse. Okay. So this captain you have to grab him and put him in that

1391
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,800
Um

1392
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,720
Uh, oh my god, that freaking citizen was in the way. I didn't want to strike in case

1393
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,440
I can't see because of the camera angles

1394
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,840
By the way, this game aged really well aged really well. I promise it aged well

1395
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,960
No

1396
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,680
Right. I am going to no. He's on it. No

1397
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,960
This couldn't have gone any worse

1398
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,600
Please I've never had this issue in this game before

1399
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:56,920
Right, just grab him grab him and push him. Fuck him. You can kill

1400
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,960
Right. No, right. We're not 100% in this right now. I'm literally bright red and embarrassment of this gameplay

1401
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,640
We're fuck you

1402
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,360
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you

1403
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:17,640
Please get off the horses. I hate when they're on the horses. All right, maybe I can do it. Hold on

1404
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:25,160
Oh my god, I can still 100% it. Okay. You need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding and push him in it

1405
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,120
Yes

1406
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,480
Whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body

1407
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,280
He has insane amounts of money on his person

1408
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,560
That was terrible, but we resurrected it

1409
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:46,920
The reason and you have to kill the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100% on this

1410
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:53,160
Borgia tower. My god. I have never attracted those other four guards before

1411
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,280
I've never had them jump on freaking horses before

1412
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
That was terrible

1413
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,680
But we did it we got 100%

1414
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,760
Oh my god, I'm my face is bright red. I'm like, oh my god

1415
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,720
Oh, I forgot to burn the tower off for goodness sake. Okay. We need to call

1416
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,840
Not the tower. Oh my god. I'm getting so flustered. Oh, right

1417
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:26,520
So we've just reclaimed this district. So you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the

1418
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:33,000
Borgia, they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of roma. Okay

1419
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,880
wait

1420
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:43,160
I'm an idiot. Marquia Valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet. Please pardon me for jumping that tower

1421
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,560
I'm skipping ahead of the game

1422
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,840
Right out my way out my way out my way out my way

1423
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,480
The guards make peep you here, but they don't actually get you. Okay. We are now giving instructions

1424
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,560
Oh, I might need to take my hoodie off I'm sweating and embarrassment

1425
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,800
I was like, oh my god, you guys are gonna think I've never played this game before. I'm like, no

1426
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:14,040
It's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never follow you inside as long as you keep moving

1427
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,200
Yeah, the guards will never go for you

1428
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,640
Um

1429
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:24,600
Literally xio is exhausted. He's climbed this tower three times now. He's like Jesus woman. Give me a break. Okay

1430
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,120
You can ignite to the Borgia tower

1431
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
Like so

1432
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,240
Oh, because all the kill-out

1433
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:56,120
Okay, now this is another interesting part of the game, which you can renovate districts to have an income

1434
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:04,520
The controller vibration on the literally uh, it's crazy

1435
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,880
Okay, we have just renovated the stables. We now have access to horsey-worsies

1436
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,120
Yeah

1437
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,960
No

1438
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,320
So we will jump on a horse. Thank you horse VTuber. We love you

1439
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:27,960
He does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so he's not talking to us right now

1440
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,440
but basically he's like

1441
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,080
You can't just do what you want. It's xio. It's dangerous. Roma have been here

1442
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,240
The Borgia have like

1443
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:42,520
Settled their ways the people are scared basically too long didn't read. Thank you marcia valley for your input

1444
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,880
Uh, it always bugs out. He should be talking to us like right now

1445
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,760
You always use the white and gray horse here, I'm gonna say something

1446
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,240
Nope, here we go

1447
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,480
Oh, he mad at us

1448
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,240
Yes, yes brotherhood of the people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry

1449
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,880
Also, you should always go behind the NPC because that'll happen

1450
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
The audio is bugging out

1451
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,720
Wait, can you guys not hear the game?

1452
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,080
Eh

1453
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,560
I will wait that he can't be Torio. I need to get contact there. It sounds fit

1454
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,360
Give me a bad one. Eh

1455
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,960
Why oh

1456
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:11,320
Input what you can turn this feature off. I never fucking asked you to turn it on you twat

1457
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
Fuck off right

1458
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,840
Is it still crunching is it the game that's crunching or me that's crunching

1459
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:25,400
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. It's chase mission. It's a chase mission

1460
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,720
It's the game that's crunchy. What the frick why have to be crunchy?

1461
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
Oh

1462
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,320
Hold on

1463
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Why are you crunchy?

1464
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,720
Okay, I'm opening up the game. I'm gonna muck around with the audio sentence. Um, you know

1465
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,360
Mission failed. We'll get him next time

1466
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:54,360
All right, why would you be crunchy even though I didn't change a single thing?

1467
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,360
Am I gonna have to close the game and open it back up again?

1468
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,600
Yeah, this isn't gonna do anything

1469
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,320
Okay, okay, we're closing the game

1470
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,080
We're closing the game

1471
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:15,080
Abort memory. Oh my god. We're in the middle of a freaking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No progress. It's gonna be lost sure useless

1472
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:23,480
You naughty boy. Why would it be crunchy? I got a notification and the thing was like I am changing

1473
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:29,640
Your input and I dismissed it because I never told it to do anything and I just freaking did it. I'm gonna burp

1474
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,640
Who goes there by the pope identify yourself?

1475
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,160
I said close game

1476
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,160
Did I not say close game?

1477
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,880
Would you like to would you like to close perhaps?

1478
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:46,520
Yes, yes, you may close the game. Yes, that's as perfectly fine. You're allowed to

1479
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,240
uh, right close

1480
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,280
That

1481
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,240
Maybe I just need to do desktop audio capture

1482
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,280
This is plausible

1483
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
And this is probable

1484
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:05,720
All right, okay. Hold on. I'll down. I'll down. Look come on. No streamer's gonna go without unhinged

Close okay, it's opening

1487
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,200

1488
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,920
Oh

1489
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,520
Mm-hmm

1490
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:29,320
Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's loading the logo and we can't see it. Yeah. I'm just like, let me just

1491
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,720
Calibrate the game real quick

1492
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,160
Just a few technical difficulties

1493
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,320
Ah

1494
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,880
Also me this game stood up to the test of time clearly fucking not

1495
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:47,560
Can you lovely jubbly peeps? Can you

1496
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,600
Can you hear there? Is that crunchy? No

1497
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:59,320
Is that still crunchy if not, you're just gonna have to hear my desktop audio instead

1498
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,800
Sounds good. Okay. Why is game not on stream stream scream?

1499
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:20,760
Uh game. Hello game game. Would you like to show up, please? Is it because I'm not is it because I'm not in game?

01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,720
Mm-hmm. Oh

1508
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,720
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure

1509
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:55,960
Assassin's Creed brotherhood is like really problematic to capture in window and I've just fucked it up because I closed it there

1510
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,360
Oh

1511
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,080
Oh

1512
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:06,600
Thank fucking god, I thought I was gonna have to end the stream to like get it to start back up again

1513
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,320
Don't ever do that to me again

1514
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,680
Oh my goodness. Oh shit, right chase chase chase

1515
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,840
Uh, I used to kill this guy all the get time and not understand why

1516
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,040
I'll go at least

1517
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,600
That in your life

1518
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:33,960
Rip your ears. Is it too loud? Sorry the guards don't like me yet. They're pushing me away. Don't push me. I'll push you

1519
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,360
Stream it. Yes me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh

1520
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,640
Thank god. I was so worried

1521
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,720
My heart feels full of relief. It is so bootyful

1522
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,680
Um, obviously because of it's an older game you can see the distance rendering

1523
01:33:54,200 --> 01:34:01,240
Not loud just the scream was ear piecing. Oh, okay. Do apologize for that. Sometimes I get a little bit excited

1524
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,440
But I'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear

1525
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:12,360
Not now Sean not now Sean go away. Get back here. Give me my money back

1526
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:17,880
Okay, there we go. We made it

1527
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,720
Did you liberate your money from our friend?

1528
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,920
Week

1529
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,880
They are up and time with work. We'll have a few dozen more depends on the the

1530
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,080
Subject six you mentioned. We'll do that at the end. I don't want to do subject

1531
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,480
Now where is my contact Vinicius? He should have already intercepted the letter

1532
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,280
follow me

1533
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:49,640
Okay, we are now riding our horses to roma. Uh, marquiovelli's just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people

1534
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:54,680
And it's he goes. Yeah, I believe in the people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us

1535
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,680
But we got it back. That's fine. That's the main thing

1536
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:04,360
But it's he is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an ordinary citizen

1537
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:08,120
who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has

1538
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,600
Um, just had an absolutely awful time and you've gone. Hey

1539
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,320
Do you want to get back at your oppressors?

1540
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,200
And then they go, uh, cc because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes

1541
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,800
They'd say see you and then the good part that

1542
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,080
The best part I would argue about this game starts up from there

1543
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,320
Okay, so we're just following horsey horsey around

1544
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,400
Uh, I love you excelene because I'm like you don't worry. I'm like you in general

1545
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,400
But these are just one of the games that I'm like

1546
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,920
I love everything about

1547
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,360
Sees the means of the projection mi amici

1548
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,600
Astroni can relate to being a precious gosh steady on

1549
01:35:55,640 --> 01:36:01,480
Thankfully I was born in a good timeline, but uh, if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate

1550
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,040
Scottish people many a time

1551
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,280
However, uh, the

1552
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,440
Romans built a wall called hadrian's wall

1553
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:15,080
Because they weren't interested in going any further into scotland

1554
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,960
They said now you guys can keep it. We're not interested in invading. Yes

1555
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That's true. That's actually science

1556
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,160
Leave my thieves alone you foul beast. Oh that was a bit steady on it

1557
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,360
It's here. What was that? It's so you're supposed to like jump on them

1558
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:40,280
Okay, well we got countered so I'll just be up. Let's just kick the thief

1559
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,400
I've never had these issues. Oh my god performance. I say

1560
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,880
I can't get up one in three men

1561
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,400
Time me at the term the baths. Okay, we'll find you the baths. Okay, we're about to do a major tutorial part coming up

1562
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,680
But don't worry. It's like a good part

1563
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:05,720
Um, so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway through this. We're currently in the coliseum

1564
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,080
Uh

1565
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:12,600
Coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now. This is very accurate to probably what it looks like going

1566
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:21,000
One in three men, but one in one colfish. How dare you? I assure you my bony

1567
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,800
bony can

1568
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,920
My pecker

1569
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:32,840
Um, it's so easy to get to get engorged

1570
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:42,600
Oh my god, I'm actually gonna announce it any engorgers anyone getting engorged right now. Yeah. Yeah, I bet you are

1571
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,320
Okay

1572
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,920
This part if we can do it flawlessly first time so I don't need to be embarrassed

1573
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:56,040
however, the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so

1574
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:03,080
First things first take out your wee knife. Know the big knife. Take out your wee knife. Okay

1575
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,960
For this part that comes up

1576
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:11,320
Because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me river and moon walked into that sequence there

1577
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:21,080
We are about to encounter a second enemy not the border

1578
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,480
Romulae

1579
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,440
Let's see if I can do this without messing up

1580
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:35,400
Okay, pause you have to reselect your small knife because the game always

1581
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:41,400
Right if I don't get hit I am blessed by the gods because you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit

1582
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,440
I hate when they attack that blinking means they're attacking

1583
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:55,960
And you can if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't tell if they're about to okay

1584
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,400
We got the 10 in a row serial killer achievement. Oh

1585
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,440
We did it 100% of that

1586
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,360
Oh

1587
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,360
That a bit always stresses me out my heart rate is

1588
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,040
Okay, this is a tutorial sequence

1589
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,160
This is called the

1590
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,400
layers of romulus

1591
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,480
Guy or Romulae if you you want to get techie speaking but Romulus

1592
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,680
Wow

1593
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,080
I swear she killed them all with one knife

1594
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,560
So this is timed. Okay. We're on a timer

1595
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:37,480
Um, you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes

1596
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:42,680
Because we will have to come back in 100% this section because in order to get the 100%

1597
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,640
Um time

1598
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,120
Is what this one is. So we're just gonna

1599
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:54,200
Speed on by we're gonna do a little speedy Gonzalez. I am not going to read chat for eight minutes

1600
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:59,480
It takes me about seven minutes to do the sequence. The timer is eight minutes. I apologize chat

1601
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,680
I can see you rating my burp in the corner of my eye

1602
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:08,200
You must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time

1603
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:10,440
Um

1604
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,880
It is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time

1605
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,600
Um, but normally I finish

1606
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,960
Roughly 40 seconds to one minute early

1607
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:27,960
Um, unfortunately this game is a bit funner. I've just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame, but

1608
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,080
Hey ho, it's what happens

1609
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,160
uh

1610
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:37,880
Yes, obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the I don't know how compose the music or

1611
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,000
Do is commission to compose the music very

1612
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,080
Very good

1613
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:48,440
Okay, I can read you for like one second. She hates us. No, I don't need to do the time sequence

1614
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:55,320
I finished early. Oh, I finished early. All right. You want to tell me tell you how early often

1615
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,720
I think I've said this before but um

1616
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:05,080
My record is like one minute and like 54 seconds

1617
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:12,360
Roughly and the only reason I know why is because that's how long the preview was for the video

1618
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:20,920
It was a free preview. I'm just gonna admit it. Sorry, but if you guys are like, I'm so nervous to talk to her in chat

1619
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,920
I am

1620
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,920
absolutely not destined

1621
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,600
uh

1622
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,600
to be

1623
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,880
professional

1624
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,400
or whatever

1625
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:36,440
But uh, yeah, that's actually true story. I could probably find the video and share it

1626
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,640
um

1627
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
If you really wanted to see how good that

1628
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,560
Um, we're under a timer so we are just gonna kind of

1629
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:53,960
Right, okay

1630
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,400
You need to look for the open gate and I get it wrong all the time

1631
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,800
But open gate and then take a no. Oh my god. I get it wrong all the time

1632
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,240
Do you know how many times I've freaking played this game and I do that every single time?

1633
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,800
You'd think I'd learn honestly

1634
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,600
One day I'll learn

1635
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,800
But I have a fun factoid

1636
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:20,600
That I will tell you later once we get to that part of the thingy

1637
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,800
But uh, this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed on this channel

1638
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,560
Uh, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on this channel in particular

1639
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:39,160
Um, because I um have very much tizm this game into submission and

1640
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:45,800
I don't know should I just ruin it? You know what if you're here right now, I think I'm allowed to ruin it

1641
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:50,680
So my birthday is the 10th of october

1642
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:54,120
Um, oh you must always grab this light

1643
01:42:54,840 --> 01:43:01,240
The game will pretend like you can do it. So october 10th is my doughnut on and you'll never guess what date

1644
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:06,920
Uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th. So we're playing it on my doughnut on

1645
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:15,640
Um, and I get to nerd about the game all over again, and I'm already beaming with happiness just thinking about it

1646
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,400
I was like, oh no, no, no, no. I'm going to subject you this twice

1647
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,600
You you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it

1648
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,280
Um

1649
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,800
We're getting close to the

1650
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,640
Main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the sequence comes in

1651
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:43,560
I'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because I've not really had I don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section

1652
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,800
Once you've killed all the romuli guys, then

1653
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,040
Uh, not once have I had the game crash on multiple playthroughs

1654
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:57,720
Um, this game was literally made for me for real for real like actually though like I mean, how did they know? Like, oh my god, this is

1655
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,720
Um for safety, I just follow this. I think you maybe can jump off

1656
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:09,400
There's a fire, but uh, I'm not risking the run. I do not want to play this like

1657
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,920
Section again. It's not boring

1658
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:22,040
Hmm, I'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching. They're not um

1659
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:29,000
Obviously every game section you have a preference for me being timed to claim about isn't

1660
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:33,560
But I understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like

1661
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:41,320
Not to panic the player, but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas, then it might

1662
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,320
be quite

1663
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,320
boresome

1664
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:51,480
Any boresoms? There's a flag to the left. We will not be collecting it. There's also a treasure box up ahead again

1665
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:55,320
We're not going to be collecting it. We are trying to get our eight minute timer

1666
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:00,760
Uh, we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot sit there. This is the grand hall

1667
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,760
This is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it

1668
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:11,480
But uh, I've done it quite a lot. So the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game

1669
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,920
Um

1670
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:23,320
I always mess this bit up as well. You need to look for this one in order to get inside

1671
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,880
This section

1672
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,480
um

1673
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:33,800
Now assassins creed was made long before the yellow paint

1674
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:41,560
So they use candlelight and fixtures. I'll show you one section that really highlights the the old candle fixtures

1675
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:45,320
Um, we're about to break this so don't be shocked

1676
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,680
I'm quite loud at the breaking

1677
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,760
Bit loud, isn't it night?

1678
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:55,080
Yes, so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been

1679
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:01,080
They know they've made it awkward. So you saw those treasure boxes. You see that flag there again

1680
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,960
We're just gonna ignore it. We're here for the speed run and we're not

1681
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:09,160
I actually don't know what the speed run of this game would be. I assume it's probably like under three hours

1682
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,200
The first time I played this it took me so long to figure out where I had to go. You have to go on the chair

1683
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:20,600
Literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam. Do you know how long it took me to find this beam as a child?

1684
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,880
Like I started asking my mum for help because my mum plays tomb raider

1685
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,240
and

1686
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,200
And she was like then you look at me straw day and I'm like mum

1687
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,680
You're small like I'm a child. You can you must be able to see

1688
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:38,760
You must also grab a lot and to to like save yourself

1689
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,400
See, this doesn't look like you should be able to grab it. But if you hold b you can get it. Sorry. I play xbox controller

1690
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,280
Uh, I don't know what it is for like ps

1691
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,680
uh four

1692
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:53,240
Is it triangle? No triangles. Why?

1693
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,840
um

1694
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,480
And we're almost there. We're doing good for time. We've not actually made any mistakes yet

1695
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:09,160
Like such as falling off falling off is the oh man. Is she fell off? Okay. Okay, dude. You're done. Um

1696
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:12,440
It's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences

1697
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,520
uh

1698
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:19,320
Don't worry the game does try to resurrect you. So this is the freaking jump that I've

1699
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:24,920
It's freaking humongous and it's so no you cannot make that in real life

1700
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,200
But we are perfect for times

1701
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:33,480
Um, and when you pick up the objective the timer stops

1702
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:37,320
So you couldn't theory go back and get all the stuff you missed

1703
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:42,280
However, I am much more happier to continue on with the campaign

1704
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:46,520
But this is a tutorial section that's part of the main quest line

1705
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,160
um for the layer of

1706
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,000
Romulus which there are six total

1707
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,360
And it unlocks you special armor. Uh, I personally don't actually go

1708
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,240
Right, we're gonna pick it up. We're gonna pick it up

1709
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:07,480
So we're picking it up now. So the timer has now officially stopped. We are no longer under the eight minute timer

1710
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:15,320
So I leave my family's armor here one of the finest sets ever made may you who finds it

1711
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:18,520
Receive strength and battle change of handwriting

1712
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,960
We have taken it and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers

1713
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:31,160
It shall be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it

1714
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,800
And we have a picture of the armor that we may unlock at a later time

1715
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:42,200
Again, I don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough. It's not necessary. It's a bit time consuming as well

1716
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,960
It's probably like an extra hour

1717
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:48,440
So the timer is paused if I pause the game time remaining 133

1718
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,600
So yeah, we can pick up all these treasure boxes because we're gonna need it

1719
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,480
you get florins in this game and

1720
01:48:56,360 --> 01:49:01,000
The campaign actually requires you to have 3,500 florins at one section

1721
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:07,000
Um, and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond because we cannot invest in like

1722
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,920
Properties for example that part comes very soon

1723
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,280
um

1724
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:21,320
How kind of them to write in clear, uh, yeah detail for us to read their, uh, evil plans basically, but there we go

1725
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,440
Ancient roman tomowers. Mmm

1726
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:28,600
Would you like to taste my ancient roman tomow?

1727
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:36,840
Tomato at golden boy achievement unlock. So we've done one as one layer of Romulus

1728
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:45,480
I'm gonna head off. Thank you for hanging. Please don't worry. I believe she be is coming up in an hour

1729
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,400
No in 10 minutes. Who's coming up next?

1730
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,480
I'm going to take a drink

1731
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,600
Is that where the ketchup? No, you're done. You're done. Ben. You're not bad

1732
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:07,560
In nine minutes. Yes. Okay, when she be goes live, please do tell me I will always recommend you guys go watch my gen mates

1733
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,720
Because because I'm an endurance streamer. I'd rather you support them

1734
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,800
Are you also an older?

1735
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
Okay, this is a beautiful quest

1736
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,280
It's a beautiful quest. It has include revelation. Yes, you play a much older etio

1737
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:38,200
I think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and it's like

1738
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:44,040
They really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this

1739
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,680
um

1740
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:50,600
See you tonight when mercy rates into you. Honestly though

1741
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,440
Guelph etio

1742
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:04,600
Brotherhood is etio in his prime for you for it. He's like 42 or 41. I believe in this game a bit of an old man, but hey

1743
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
Other bombs

1744
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,800
Okay, we're about to unlock the next sequence. It's so good

1745
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:21,320
So the map of roma is massive, but there's guards everywhere

1746
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,720
So he's telling us if you use the aqueducts, you can move about real quick

1747
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,960
So we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to island tebarina

1748
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:35,320
And this is where the assassins are based on on the map in roma

1749
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,440
When mercy airdonstream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story

1750
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,480
Honestly, oh my god, azurid. It's so well on her 2.0

1751
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:55,800
She's fantastic with all her yapping. I think someone said yeah procorn and I was like, well, that's pretty smart. I like that

1752
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,040
He's not really in this at all

1753
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:10,360
Fabio, I feel like he might have been dlc content or something. He has two seeds in this game. And yeah

1754
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,200
I don't know what

1755
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,640
I'd rather confuse

1756
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,920
Her voice is sick

1757
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,440
Gee willikers. I wonder why I picked azura. I think we are ready for such an effect for the model

1758
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,080
Do you know for instance where the borja troops took katharina's forza?

1759
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:40,120
What are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple of Eden?

1760
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,160
How could you have lost the apple?

1761
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,400
So you do not know what goes on with our enemies

1762
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:50,440
Do we at least have an underground here to work with no underground network found

1763
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,760
Our mercenaries are ensnared in illusory love. He doesn't even talk to me

1764
01:52:55,480 --> 01:53:01,000
We have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals. Oh my god. It's she be you're in my game

1765
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,800
But the madam there is a lot rather attend parties than further of cause

1766
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,760
What about the city steves?

1767
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:12,120
Do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us?

1768
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,440
I do not know why

1769
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,760
What are you going to do to make some friends make some friends?

1770
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,480
such a good line

1771
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:25,800
Because we're about to make three different allies of different districts. We're about to make friends with the thieves

1772
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,120
We're about to make friends with the hoes. We're about to make friends with the mercenaries. Let's go

1773
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,400
It's very good

1774
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:37,000
We also unlock notoriety in this as well

1775
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,040
um

1776
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:45,160
And we also unlock having little uh things achievement unlock from in ruins

1777
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,680
Make friends with the hoes to the window

1778
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:58,280
The fighter the lover and the thief to the sweat drop off my boss. Oh skeet skeet mother

1779
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:02,360
Oh skeet skeet god. You want a scottish cover of that song?

1780
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,080
Right we are going to do the eagle point

1781
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:11,000
Right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around island tibirina

1782
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:15,480
Please

1783
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:22,840
Right, so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason

1784
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:29,960
For the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety. So guards are going to start harassing us a bit more

1785
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:33,960
Um heralds are going to start talking about the devious

1786
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:41,640
Uh acts that xio has committed and we're also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies

1787
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,440
You didn't falsify your testimony to me

1788
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:51,080
We've also been introduced to the bank. Um

1789
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:54,760
Where we can

1790
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:59,480
Get money for investing in the city every 20 minutes

1791
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:04,840
We will get our little twint or cup from investing in these places

1792
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:07,480
um

1793
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:12,360
And we have withdrawn four to eight florins. We are rich. We're rich. We're rich

1794
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:14,920
Any you played that game?

1795
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:18,760
Have you heard about that game that that one game about the the guys that dig in the mines? Right?

1796
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:25,000
We're going to go to sorry. I didn't want to learn the lore of the bridge. Sorry bridge. Not interested

1797
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,400
We're going to go to the hose first

1798
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,280
Cause there's thousands of liars

1799
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:38,680
Um and do this quest line. This is the campaign quest that requires florins in order to progress

1800
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:47,160
However, you can get a very I think you get roughly 2000 florins for doing this quest if you loot the bodies of

1801
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,040
the

1802
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:55,240
What the heck this place is bourgeois. Should we just destroy rest ever just going to go kill the captain?

1803
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:58,760
I hope he's not a coward because cowards run

1804
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,800
Oh, he's not a coward. Okay. We're gonna

1805
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:06,200
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me. Have you heard about this? Have you seen about this? Please don't shoot me?

1806
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,280
Please don't shoot me. I don't have much

1807
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:11,640
I don't have much uh healing vials on me

1808
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:17,160
Stop shooting me at least fight me like a man

1809
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:22,760
Come in my face and say what are you you just completely dodged that right?

1810
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:25,080
We're going to heal and we're going to loot this guy

1811
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:32,520
We're going to unlock this area because see how the the map is red. That's because the bourgeois one is

1812
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,160
Joined by this guy. Okay

1813
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:40,920
This looks bad with how much red is on screen. I will get hit. There's absolutely no doubt in my head

1814
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,160
We're going to get hit but it's fine. We're going to deal with it

1815
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:47,400
We get the big guys first because these you want to kill the big guys in sequence

1816
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:54,120
Okay, no, we just attracted the attention of that guard over there, which is such a shame. No, we attracted more attention

1817
01:56:54,360 --> 01:57:00,760
Okay, the camera angle gets really bad under here. Oh, no, we attracted more guards not again. It's happening again

1818
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,880
I can't see I can't see

1819
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,040
Stop it. Stop it. No more. No more. Okay. We're fine. We're safe

1820
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:12,920
No, not the horse. Leave me alone. I hate when they go on the horses

1821
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,680
Okay, okay, air assassinate the horse guy. Okay, we did it. We did it. Okay smooth move smooth move

1822
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,920
No, get off the horse

1823
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,320
Get off the horses, please

1824
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:29,240
You're getting you're getting billeted. Boom. That's right. Get off. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, and then we're gonna stab him

1825
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:36,760
Okay, yeah, the horse is beating him up getting violence getting violence. Get him horse beat him up. Yeah, horsey

1826
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:41,320
Yeah, okay, we're getting a horse feature bar. Let's go. Come on, horsey

1827
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:43,720
Beat him up horse. Beat him up. That's right. Trap alone

1828
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:50,120
Okay, we're just gonna kick him to death. Okay. I was remembered to let the body of the guards

1829
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:53,080
That was amazing. I've never had the horse help me before

1830
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,440
Oh, that's fantastic

1831
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,080
Oh in the best of kids

1832
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:04,200
Uh, there might be an archer on the other side, but it's not a big deal at this point because we have

1833
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:08,360
Got the thing uh, right. How do I get up here?

1834
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,600
Um, we are going to unlock what's called a leaping glove

1835
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:18,680
Um, which means we can do very very big jumps. Uh, unfortunately we can't do it at this section of the tower

1836
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,520
So we're gonna have to drop down and reclaim it at a different area

1837
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:28,680
We unlock that in sequence four. I think at the end of sequence four. I can't remember

1838
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,720
Um, but it means we can jump things

1839
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,320
Very easily and it makes claiming much faster because right now it's a wee bit slow, but it's fine

1840
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:39,640
Um

1841
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:43,880
Time to work. Please enjoy your work. Thank you for hanging out. I'll appreciate you

1842
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,040
I believe she be is going live right now. She be caught him boom

1843
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,840
If anyone would like to

1844
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,240
Depart deeply departed

1845
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,000
I'm sure that's the song

I am the one the only one don't need a gun to get respect up off the street

1847
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:03,080
My enemies your enemies we wet them up like a canteen

1848
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:11,240
Uh, right she be sorry. I'm getting very distracted. She be caught and bum is going live. I am going to get uh

1850
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:21,080
Yes, she be is going live. Yeah, uh

1851
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:25,720
Management, can you post she be's link? Please do not be afraid to join she be stream

1852
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:31,640

1853
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:37,800
Please do support my, uh, lovely gen mate. She's fantastic. She's incredibly witty

1854
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:40,440
Uh, witty on that

1855
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,920
Dave give me your money. Oh

1856
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,640
That's really embarrassing

1857
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,440
He just

1858
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:56,840
He just grabbed over the barrel and rolled over. Okay. We're not even it's okay. We don't need the money. It's fine. It's fine

1859
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,400
It's fine

1860
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:05,800
Okay, yes, please feel free to check out sheepsters. Uh, I'm just doing brotherhood for the rest of the day

1861
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,120
so have fun enjoyer and

1862
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,560
Uh, uh, oh, this is dead end. I always forget the section

1863
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:17,960
Uh, normally recruitment's actually spawning those sections and they're so annoying to try and get them do a barrel roll literally

1864
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:25,400
Yes, oh, I'm getting I'm getting shanked. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm getting picked up by thieves. Right. This wasn't supposed to this

1865
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,400
This isn't a part of the

1866
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,160
Leave me like, wha

1867
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:32,680
For these skinny agile guys, you must take out your small weapon drapes

1868
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,560
Swords as well work, but um, yes

1869
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:39,800
He had so you have to wait until they attack you basically because they're so agile it's such a

1870
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,680
And then you can do that

1871
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:48,520
Oh my god, oh, I don't want the guards to see me with this body. We're just going to go straight into the memory

1872
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,240
Don't want the guards to make the bodies on me

1873
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
It was fun hanging

1874
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,400
Have fun with sheepster

1875
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,040
Bye bye. Thanks for hanging

1876
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:11,000
Molly stream drift. Ayuto. That means help in attack. Ayuto. Ayuto

1877
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:20,520
Oh my god, she got her look at her nose. She got a nose job. Look at that peak on that nose. That's beautiful

1878
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,680
I will get her back

1879
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:27,720
Beautiful beautiful. Oh, I really need to pee. Not gonna lie

1880
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,600
kind of need to pee

1881
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,640
um

1882
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:34,360
Maybe after I finish this act we can go pee

1883
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,800
If you see top left it says like I've got 5 000 florins, but I need 2.5

1884
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,920
It must be 3k for the banker uh sequence, but that's not yet the banker comes later

1885
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,480
Um banker is a later act

1886
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,800
We are currently doing the lover the thief in the fighter

1887
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,200
um

1888
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:58,440
Okay, now that I've noticed I need to pee. I really need to pee. Um

1889
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:03,640
Uh brain psychology. Have you heard of this? Uh, do you want to maybe not?

1890
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:09,720
I'm a bit rude. We are just going to run. Normally you can just take a horse over this section, but I find

1891
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:12,840
They've spawned a wee bit too much

1892
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:17,320
People to like walk around and the horse really struggles to go in between

1893
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:22,920
Like the streets, especially if there's narrow sections, whereas xio can just straight up jump over

1894
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:25,320
Uh, so we will be just doing that

1895
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:29,640
Self-fulfilling prophecy

1896
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,640
I need to pee

1897
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:38,520
Oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time, but we like affect the water like flush system

1898
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,160
Why did you take out the sword xio? I

1899
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:46,760
He just poked him in that eye xio. That was that was a lot. Oh

1900
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:53,320
Whoopsies. I actually didn't mean to do that. I literally just smacked my mouth. I didn't mean to kill him

1901
02:02:53,400 --> 02:03:00,600
I'm sorry. You're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and I've just like literally made made her a widow

1902
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:04,040
Oh

1903
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:07,160
Don't really feel good about that one. Uh, so this is a bourgeois on

1904
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,640
It's actually really annoying

1905
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,200
Do we do the bourgeois on before we do this?

1906
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:22,120
Oh, no, we won't I can't be arsed. We'll come back to this zone. It's a lot easier when you have recruits

1907
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,680
Have you come for the whore?

1908
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:27,320
close enough

1909
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,480
It's what happens at football halftime. Oh, I heard that

1910
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:37,160
What? Oh my god

1911
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:43,880
I don't remember this part right again. No way. Did you see the four things behind me? Soldiers are about to board this boat as well

1912
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:49,480
Okay, you must loot the bodies. Oh, I forgot to loot the bodies. Oh, that's fine. Oh

1913
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,320
Why are the freaking

1914
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,400
Energy pro, okay

1915
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:05,080
So we're gonna look at the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique items like elephant ivory

1916
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:08,440
Uh, 200 coins. I thought it was a bit more than that

1917
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:14,200
Yeah, vlad then paler coins. Um, these items can be traded at shops for special items

1918
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:17,640
Who goes there identify yourself? Um

1919
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:26,920
And after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards

1920
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:33,480
They are very vital to a later campy a later sequence

1921
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:40,120
Uh, actually the banker sequence, uh, which I previously mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay

1922
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:44,920
You can also get favors done by them. I don't mean like that because they're courtesans

1923
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,240
I mean like

1924
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:52,600
So the base price to hire a group is 150 florins, but if you wow them

1925
02:04:53,080 --> 02:05:00,760
Uh, you can get a discount rate of 75 florins. I've made that sound so weird. I know but it's the gameplay

1926
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:09,160
Um, the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves will pickpocket naturally as you walk through clouds

1927
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:16,520
But it's a little bit more. It's not awkward to get the thieves favor. They just have a few more unique. Um

1928
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,840
A few more unique things you have to do

1929
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:25,640
I will explain it when we once we unlock it. We're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more sense

1930
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:32,040
Um, but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood

1931
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:36,200
Allies which are assassin allies and they will help your gameplay

1932
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:40,920
if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just not there with it with time in and

1933
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,400
Like things if the games are going too fast and you're like, I can't keep up

1934
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:50,680
This is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls

1935
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,080
because once you unlock assassin recruits

1936
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:59,160
Your life is so much easier from there. It's it's bliss. It's a dream

1937
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:06,040
It's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress and that these are my kena games

1938
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:12,680
Okay, I don't want to feel stressed out. Uh, if I don't hit that you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here

1939
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:19,480
Uh, 75 for a whole group of them. Damn. No wonder strongy only was 100 for the ASMR

1940
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:23,000
Booth, could you imagine if a con would let us do that though?

1941
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,800
I think we'd get kicked out

1942
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:29,240
I'm not gonna lie

1943
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:36,280
Not that I'm insinuating anything would occur in the booth, but I feel like

1944
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:41,720
Things may go hand quickly

1945
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:44,760
Uh

1946
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:48,520
Oh, is there sister and her mom they're in roma now

1947
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,520
You cannot close I need your help

1948
02:06:56,040 --> 02:07:03,320
Good morning. Good. Good morning. Good afternoon and good evening. Oh, yes. Good morning. Good afternoon. No, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. There we go

1949
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:05,480
That's

1950
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:08,520
This is different. What alternative do you have?

1951
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:13,160
So claudia is currently she be cotton bum because she's about to run a brothela

1952
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,640
I've been on the blooming rose

1953
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,360
Why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research

1954
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:24,680
These are the hairstyles

1955
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,200
at the time

1956
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,680
Good morning. Good evening. Good night. Did I say the wrong way?

1957
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:31,560
far

1958
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,600
I'm a wee bit slow

1959
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:38,280
So we are now about to renovate this lovely location

1960
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:44,840
And our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans

1961
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:50,760
Uh, the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that. Um

1962
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,800
There's a flag at the top. You can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly

1963
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:58,840
Um, but we're about to go inside

1964
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:00,520
but

1965
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,520
Jen too called the blooming rose

1966
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,080
honestly

1967
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:08,600
There are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd

1968
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,880
We were talking about like actually coming to physical cons

1969
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,280
Rosa infior

1970
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
Um

1971
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,400
Okay, this

1972
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,720
The border make it difficult for claudia's girls

1973
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:35,320
There are several things you could do that would aid them

1974
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:43,880
You can do side quests for the brotella with your mom or whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

1975
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,760
No

1976
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:49,480
No, she assigns you a quest

1977
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:56,520
You do not do a quest with your mom and they get okay

1978
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:59,480
Ah

1979
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,160
Apologies

1980
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:06,600
Right. Okay. So as I was talking about you can kind of level them up. You can be given assignments

1981
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:10,840
So right now it costs 150 florins to highlight to hire a group of girls

1982
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:12,600
um

1983
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:16,200
Send 10 guards distracted hide bodies

1984
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,440
poison

1985
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:24,040
Assassinate from blind spots assassinate from behind smoke bomb with not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later

1986
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:30,280
But you can do these and gain favor with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier

1987
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,080
um

1988
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:35,480
Right next we are going to

1989
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:43,000
Actually factually do the mercenaries, which is this one. I'm just highlighting it on the map. So I don't get confused

1990
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,400
Yes, it is very far away

1991
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,200
Um, however

1992
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:50,920
Well, we can just

1993
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,040
Run there

1994
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:56,360
I think I can't take a horse and I cannot take the aqueduct because

1995
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,320
As soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map

1996
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:07,400
Which is fine because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing things

1997
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:10,520
So yeah, horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through

1998
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,880
Though this is a lost memory of the girl that got away, but we're not going to do it right now

1999
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,640
We're going to do it at the end. I do apologize if you're really interested in the story

2000
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:22,360
uh, what's her name?

2001
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,920
Christina is her name

2002
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,480
Um, but that sad part comes in later

2003
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:35,240
Uh, it is a very unfavorable and sad memory. So I like leaving it to the end. I'd rather just focus on the happy times

2004
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:39,320
Hey, only 500 more meters to go

2005
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,920
Uh, Christina, I knew it was Christina

2006
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:50,440
Yeah, this game as much as I'll meme about the render distance like as soon as you get closer to someone

2007
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:51,880
I've just

2008
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:53,880
Added so much time going this way, whatever. Um

2009
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:59,880
I'm like, I'm trying to find the main freaking road, but I can't find it. It's really annoying

2010
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:02,840
Okay, I found the main road and I'm about to go off it. Yippee

2011
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:08,920
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I swapped him out a sword. Oh, this entire zone's red and I'm not strong enough to kill him

2012
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:12,120
We are

2013
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:17,320
Then we just run through the area to save us time to be honest

2014
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,400
No, no, I'm not stopping. You can't make me go away. You stink

2015
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,960
Stinky stinky guard

2016
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:30,760
We'll come back once we unlock recruits. Um, I can't get over your accident. Thanks. I spawned in with it

2017
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:37,480
Uh, if you'd like to visit Glasgow, please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles in the UK

2018
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,840
Um

2019
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:44,840
Maybe I should do that. Maybe I should like plan a trip if you ever came to Scotland

2020
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:47,880
And I'll be like you should go here and you should go here because I've been here and I've been there

2021
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,560
um

2022
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:51,560
That'd be cute

2023
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:53,560
um

2024
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,560
The order is an acquired taste. Oh, yeah

2025
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:01,320
Stinky, uh-oh stinky. Okay. These are the French

2026
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:08,280
What do we think of the French? What do we think of the French? We think they're fish. They smell. Sorry

2027
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,480
There's like a football chant. That's like, what do we think of the French? I can't remember it

2028
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:15,480
But it's like, what do we think of the French?

2029
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,800
What do we think of the French?

2030
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:22,120
And Glasgow is nice while you visit it glad you didn't get stabbed

2031
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:29,640
The one of the highest rate places to get stabbed. However, rate is one of the friendliest as well in Europe

2032
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:32,040
Of all of Europe. I don't know

2033
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,280
But

2034
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:39,240
Okay, we made it. We made it. We are about to meet Bartolomeo

2035
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,880
the

2036
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,200
owner, I guess of the mercenary guild

2037
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:54,840
Water check

2038
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:56,600
Bartolomeo

2039
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:01,400
You have to meet my wife Bianca. Oh, no, fantasy. Yeah, Bianca's a sword. Sorry

2040
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,360
His sword of his name is Bianca

2041
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:09,400
Did you check behind the table? Okay, that's a reference to Assassin's Creed one. Just so you know

2042
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:18,920
Pantasy day. Ah, don't mind the bad dude on Chantay

2043
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:24,360
I still haven't harassed Amy with my French, uh, Scottish French accent

2044
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:31,960
I should force her to make an ASMR French collab with me, but I like purposely put my accent

2045
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,280
On and she's just cringing in the corner

2046
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:41,400
Don't forget to stretch. Yes, uh, I will need to educate you guys

2047
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:46,840
On why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit who veins

2048
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,200
Our position is weak

2049
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:55,000
Then we can concentrate our forces on the French round

2050
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,560
Thank you for disclosing this to me Madonna Dalviano. It is the least that I can do to help her

2051
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:07,160
So I will educate you right now my lovely jubblies

2052
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,040
Did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from

2053
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:16,680
Hemorrhoids, which is a failure of a vein in your booty hole

2054
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:21,880
As office workers because they sit down for long periods of time. So I always recommend

2055
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:28,840
Stretching often or standing up. We are all about to go for a pee break and I recommend you all get up with me

2056
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:35,960
Um, sorry that I never explained that mission there if you kill only the captain you get 100 percent super simple easy

2057
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,960
And you can also pick up a flag on the way

2058
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,640
Uh, so yes, uh, we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes

2059
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:47,240
So I will recommend we stretch roughly every two hours

2060
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:51,560
Um, I have no idea how long I've been streaming for but we should probably do it soon

2061
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:57,880
Um, the guards will not harass you at this area. It's super easy and you can pick up this a lot of treasure box. It's full

2062
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:07,080
Yes, um, uh, it's quite interesting like the knee this sounds absolutely bizarre

2063
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:10,520
But the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting

2064
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:14,760
Because it's literally just what side am I supposed to climb up? I can't get up there

2065
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:21,160
Um, it's literally just a vein in your booty hole. That's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it

2066
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:26,840
It's just like adios I'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and

2067
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,160
You know put it on your butt and then it goes away

2068
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:34,280
It's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame. I've like heard stories like people who suffer

2069
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:37,400
Uh, you need to like get on operation on your butt

2070
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:39,000
but

2071
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,440
um

2072
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:42,440
Yeah

2073
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:43,960
I don't know. I just

2074
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:47,960
Sorry, I'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and stuff. So, yeah

2075
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:58,280
I am not expecting these topics of conversation and sorry, I do apologize. Do we go left or right here? I actually

2076
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:00,840
I think yeah, we were supposed to go left

2077
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,840
Okay

2078
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:07,320
The butthole Lord. Yes, you you will have the healthiest booty hole

2079
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:10,040
Uh, enjoying my streams

2080
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,960
because

2081
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:13,960
We will have healthy butts together

2082
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,880
Uh

2083
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:19,480
Okay, first synchronize the viewpoint and then ignite the board of tower

2084
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:23,640
Do not ignite the board of tower first because the viewpoint will

2085
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:29,080
Not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again. Once you have done a tower

2086
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:31,160
You never have to go back up it. There is no

2087
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:36,760
Treasure chests added on top of the tower. There are no flags added on top of the tower

2088
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:39,480
um

2089
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:41,480
yes

2090
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:47,480
Don't worry. I love every second of your conversation. Yeah, I do like my conversational topic

2091
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:54,520
Uh, the game will always give you a way up fast if uh, they've kind of put you in a thingy

2092
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:58,840
Because they literally leave you in the water after that sequence and I was like, okay, then I guess

2093
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:04,040
We will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse, but a

2094
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:08,200
A really strange developmental fact is

2095
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:13,320
Um, depending on the horse's color depends on its speed in the game

2096
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:17,960
The lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is

2097
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:24,280
And then obviously it goes up to all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game

2098
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:30,280
I don't know why the developers did it like that. Um, but I noticed it as soon as I like started playing the game

2099
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:33,880
I was like, huh, why did they do this? It seems like such a random thing

2100
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:35,640
um

2101
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:38,440
But we're on a dark brown horse, which is the second fastest

2102
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:44,280
So we got here lickety split, but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one

2103
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,640
Uh, yeah, it'll be so slow in comparison

2104
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:52,200
Now that the popes dogs have fled we're talking about horses still, right? Yeah

2105
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:59,320
It's dread play the game. I will show you literally. I don't know why the devs don't know

2106
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:02,600
Well, that's a true fact. Oh, I don't that's group

2107
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:10,840
Oh, yeah, I'm all I can got restricted and I had to pass like a 10

2108
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:15,960
Second like 10 captures and I can't be bothered doing it. So my account's just restricted right now

2109
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:17,320
I'm so freaking lazy

2110
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:19,320
It like makes me do like these 10

2111
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:25,160
Things over and over and I failed it the first time and I'm like go ahead and stop playing

2112
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:33,160
Like, you know, Phil will I'm a human all I did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it blocked my account again

2113
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,880
I've done it like three times now. I keep getting it like

2114
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:42,120
Horses are like cars red cargo first

2115
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:52,440
Again, uh, same thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper

2116
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:58,440
I don't know if they get more effective cannot prove that. I don't know if they get more aggressive and successful

2117
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:04,120
Bit silly in it. Yes, it's silly

2118
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:08,360
BRB got walk home. Please do not get snatched on your way home

2119
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,200
The red ones go faster

2120
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,520
So

2121
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:29,800
Oh, we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well you get some florns on the side super easy super quick

2122
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:33,800
If you unlock your assassin signals and do these really fast, not problem

2123
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:43,160
Uh, we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time

2124
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:44,920
Okay

2125
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:51,320
Now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because if you see the meters

2126
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:57,720
It says we're 1000 meters away. We go to the island Tiberina. That's the closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment

2127
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:02,040
Yeah, it wasn't kind of the market

2128
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,240
Is that that might be true

2129
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:11,640
I actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you under your the higher like tier you are with them

2130
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:14,600
We

2131
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:16,680
If

2132
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:22,520
Jesus almost just killed myself from that board there. You're goodness. All right. They came out near we have

2133
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:27,960
We do have to run for this but again, unless I take this guy's horse. You don't want mine now

2134
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,480
Thank you very much

2135
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:34,760
Please okay, my way

2136
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:39,400
So this is the problem if the if you gallop through crowds the horse will fall over

2137
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:42,600
But if you just sprint through crowds the horse won't fall over

2138
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:46,200
Um, literally we committed grand theft horse

2139
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:48,120
Say

2140
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:53,800
Apologies to that guy. He probably spent thousands of florns on the horse and I've just ran away with it

2141
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:56,360
And you get to keep the horse

2142
02:20:57,480 --> 02:21:02,120
Uh, I've still not unlocked targets. So we're not gonna do that. We're just gonna swim across the water really quick

2143
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:08,280
We the pirate ship always stays after you have done that. I don't know why

2144
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:15,560
But the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission. So it's not like a massive waste

2145
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:21,960
So we are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we call on it

2146
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:26,840
It's gonna try and okay. There we go. We're out of range. So we can spawn in the horse at any point

2147
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,400
But uh, it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't

2148
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,760
So you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side

2149
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:41,320
Fuckin hell this horse is zooming. My god. What kind of hay did we give it?

2150
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:48,040
It's so fat. Why are we going so fat? I need to help it. Oh my god

2151
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:54,840
That was dangerous. Oh, that was dangerous. Like didn't even got a helmet on. He's not even got any crash pads on

2152
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:59,000
I'm surprised to see you. This is Laval pay the owner of the tea skilled

2153
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:02,360
Horse doping honestly

2154
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:07,000
The answer you always do you want to put my spies to work

2155
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:10,040
Sippy check

2156
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:15,640
No, thank you. The horse be like gotta go fast. Should have made it blue like sannic

2157
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:18,440
a serious allegation

2158
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:22,120
Bang bang

2159
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:24,280
Give a wee baggie to the horse

2160
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:26,520
Wee baggie is slang for

2161
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:29,800
I also know he abandoned you right before the

2162
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:34,600
Yeah, I think you can you can get the rest from there. He is an assassin

2163
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:37,240
Not a traitor

2164
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:41,400
I am not convinced. What a wee baggie means

2165
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,200
Care to accompany me

2166
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:54,360
So Laval pay thinks that marquia velly is a traitor to the assassin's guild

2167
02:22:54,600 --> 02:23:00,680
Which is the reason why Laval pay refuses to communicate with marquia velly

2168
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:05,800
Can I get a horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get

2169
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:09,560
Let's go

2170
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:13,400
Right, let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way

2171
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,440
um

2172
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:21,880
After this we gain notoriety unfortunately, which means they're going to be

2173
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:28,920
Posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too a bit too much and they're always like above

2174
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,840
Money

2175
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:36,440
How we are we're at six thousand that's not honestly, that's not bad

2176
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:40,280
Um, we are going to try and get a crossbow ball

2177
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,840
You can unlock a crossbow ball just like the archers

2178
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:50,120
But you need to pay for it and I think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings

2179
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:57,080
Like boot. I keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example. Um, it does like

2180
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:02,760
It adds up over time, but it kind of is a bit difficult

2181
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:08,120
It's better to like save your money for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after

2182
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:14,280
Oh, you like my twitter picture. Yeah. Yeah, I totally made it myself

2183
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:18,280
I did not

2184
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:20,840
I didn't make it at all. I yanked it

2185
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:23,560
Okay, okay

2186
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,560
This pay attention

2187
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:28,680
Look at his body and look at him holding his arm

2188
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:33,080
Please make note of this as his and what sounds crazy

2189
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:37,720
But i'm going to talk about reusing assets and how genius it is in video game development

2190
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:45,000
Okay, so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm. Please keep this in your mind. Okay. Let's see if I can shoot everyone

2191
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:47,240
You first

2192
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,800
Right you next

2193
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,720
Right you next

2194
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:53,720
Okay, you know

2195
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,040
How about you? Okay. Oh

2196
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,000
Oh

2197
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Hey, let's go, baby

2198
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:09,640
Do you guys see the behind of the scenes and lord of the rings where gimley's like right you first right you next you'll come to me

2199
02:25:09,640 --> 02:25:13,080
I'll beat you up right you next right you next. That's basically what we just did

2200
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,320
Okay, now this section is actually super easy. It was really hard at first

2201
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:21,560
We might get caught because i'm it's he gets lost so quickly

2202
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:28,440
But basically you have to hide here and then we're going to wait for a group to walk up

2203
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,120
And then they will see that group there

2204
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:35,560
That's coming towards us. We hide in that group and then that's it

2205
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:39,160
We've done this section of the game, but please make a note of his body

2206
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:42,040
How he's holding his arm and he's kind of hunched over

2207
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,480
Because i'm going to show you a reused asset you might not know about

2208
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:50,920
Wait, why why is that group highlighted? Hold on a minute. Am I supposed to be with the other? There's too many groups

2209
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,600
Please

2210
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,600
Please okay you

2211
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:01,640
Okay, I hate this bit because the tree gets in the way. Yes, you heard me right the tree gets in the way and breaks up the group often

2212
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:04,600
But we're just gonna blend in

2213
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:09,720
Don't look at us guards. We're just citizens. I'm a monk

2214
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:14,040
Amen, amen. I don't know what monks say

2215
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,400
And then

2216
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:19,400
Oh, excuse me

2217
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:21,480
You are right there and he's like

2218
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:25,880
That could have desynchronized because he got caught on those people. I'm not even kidding

2219
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:33,400
Analysing asset analizing

2220
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:37,080
Will this asset be reused later? Yes, it will

2221
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:43,240
You know how to disappear

2222
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:57,800
Okay, we are going to take a pee break right after we've done this bit because I need to pee

2223
02:26:58,040 --> 02:27:00,040
He he he

2224
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:03,560
And i'm gonna get more water because i'm out of water already

2225
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,280
So these are witnesses

2226
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:10,040
We lose 75 percent notoriety if we do that

2227
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:12,840
And we are also going to complete a thieves challenge

2228
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:20,760
Which is drum roll, please is to pickpocket 500 florins and a really quick way to do it is by this

2229
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:23,560
You pick bribe him 500

2230
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,720
And then yank

2231
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
Easy come easy go, baby

2232
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:36,600
Uh and then oh, I still have notoriety. Um, that's not supposed to happen. It's supposed to disappear at this point

2233
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:43,400
Excuse me whilst I kill this other witness. Oh, no, there's guards. You know what? I can deal with the guards. Yank

2234
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:50,040
Ah

2235
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:54,840
I'm a good citizen. I promise. I'm just a scary scary monk

2236
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,800
You've got the wrong man

2237
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:03,080
Everyone else wears hoodies. Okay, it's not just me. Oh, I'm like running into more enemies

2238
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:12,200
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold the phone. Hold pause. Pause. Pause. Oh pause pause pause

2239
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:17,080
We did it. We did it. We snuck on him. Oh my god, we snuck up on him

2240
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:22,520
Oh my god, it's normally so hard to do talk about opportunistic killing my goodness

2241
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:25,640
Okay, we've just secured her like a third board to tower

2242
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:29,960
Oh my goodness. I can't believe the timing just happened

2243
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:37,400
Oh, that was perfect timing. I could not have asked for better. Oh my god, I could not have asked for better

2244
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:39,800
Is he still trying to oh he just drowned. Okay

2245
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:43,000
Oh, that was amazing. I'm so happy with that

2246
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:50,280
Okay, we're gonna burn this tower. There are a few archers on the roof, but uh, they're not too much of a bother

2247
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:52,600
All right, you can just kind of you know

2248
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:56,440
Unfortunately, you do have this one's a bit more awkward. You have to like

2249
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:01,320
You have to like kill him and then you have to go up there and kill this guy too

2250
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:06,360
And it's a bit annoying to navigate. Whoopsie. Oh, wow. I made that jump

2251
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:10,440
There's a guard down there, but you don't have to kill him if you don't

2252
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,800
Get down. No

2253
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:17,320
I will take your get down get down. Oh my god

2254
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:22,360
Oh

2255
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:27,320
You know that song that Japanese one you heard of this you heard of that thing

2256
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:33,880
Oh, maybe if we get 3d models, we can all do that trend get down

2257
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:43,800
Right, we need to find the synchronization point for the map boom synchronization

2258
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,240
Yeah

2259
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:51,000
I used to watch a lot of hadsunimiki MMDs

2260
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:55,160
Like dance and stuff and that was the first ever exposure

2261
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:01,400
Pretty much I got

2262
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:06,040
So I have another sipping tin of cola

2263
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:13,240
Oh, my ankle just cracked. I don't know if you heard that

2264
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,760
If I got picked up in the make my ankle just cracked

2265
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:20,040
Because I'm sitting on my 15th

2266
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:26,200
I'm wiggling my toes right now. That's right. What are you going to do? You're going to try and stop me? Exactly. You can't

2267
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
I'm just a little toe wiggler

2268
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:37,960
Okay, uh, we'll get a horse. We'll complete this next but I think we have to defend the thieves guild and upgrade it

2269
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:43,080
And then that was I was done with DNA sequence three question marks

2270
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,560
Ah

2271
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,640
There are nine dna sequences in this game

2272
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:56,200
And they're all perfectly leveled out, but we are getting very close to being out of the tutorial section very very close

2273
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:59,400
I believe

2274
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,240
after act

2275
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:03,240
five

2276
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:05,960
We are officially a tutorial and his own

2277
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:09,640
What a knight of these has a toe wiggling street

2278
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:11,960
Listen to me. I know what we saw

2279
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:17,240
But you have nothing to fear from Machiavelli. What was the streaming page you watched mmds from?

2280
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:22,920
I just youtube like had to meet you dancing and like tato. I like tato

2281
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:29,640
Um, who else did I like? What are the thieves? Ah, what's the yellow one called?

2282
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:33,400
Goodness me I've forgotten her name

2283
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:37,480
I would like to know it not lin and brin to make sure the border just stay away

2284
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:41,320
Perhaps it could look like I forgot the yellow. No, not kagaman

2285
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:46,040
I like that idea. Teto hats and miko and the yellow one

2286
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:53,480
Okay, renovating the thieves guild. Oh, sorry. I just called on the horse by accident. Sorry horsey. Please don't come

2287
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:01,320
Um, am I gonna? Nero? Nero! Nero! I think her name is Nero

2288
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,280
No, it's not a boy

2289
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:09,880
Right type in hats and miko teto and it's like beep beep beep and it goes

2290
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:18,040
Nero! Akita! That's her. Yeah, like Akita

2291
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:22,520
Not Gumi. Uh, Gumi never really appealed to me. Sorry

2292
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,120
Nero! Nero!

2293
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:28,120
Yadomiku with a one-point help basically

2294
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:31,800
Uh, I like

2295
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:39,160
Ah, yes, I forgot. We also have gamba. It is a great source of income

2296
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:44,280
Especially, but we gamble all the money before I go for a pee just for the heck of it

2297
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:50,600
Your hair looks like water, man, melon, candy, watermelon, sugar

2298
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:59,400
I actually quite like it. Um, because Amy's ginger. She's our yinya. If you're scouts, she's our yinya

2299
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:04,200
So I didn't like want to have like orange orange. So I'm very vibrant in my clothes

2300
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:08,600
Okay, we're just gonna gamble the money and then we'll go for a pee

2301
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:14,120
Okay, what I yeah, but what I do though, I actually I've never played this game

2302
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:18,120
Oh god, what I do

2303
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,680
First rule rule the through the seven seven eleven suck a dick or a ball sack

2304
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:29,560
It wins the game without payroll

2305
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:35,640
I'm all in max wager have absolutely no clue. Let's go

2306
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,200
Did I win

2307
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:44,200
Did I lose that all

2308
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:54,200
Yeah

2309
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:56,680
Did I win

2310
02:34:03,160 --> 02:34:07,800
Oh, no, I'm just gonna have to play more assassin's creed with you guys then

2311
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:11,800
Oh, no

2312
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:14,200
Oh, well

2313
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:20,520
Okay, is this the end of the sequence? No, okay, we're gonna unlock the place

2314
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:28,440
Roma is doomed literally can't play landlord simulator in assassin's creed brotherhood. I am doomed

2315
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:32,680
The house always wins do not gamble

2316
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:38,040
Did I tell you that one time I got offered a lot of money to do a gamble at

2317
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:45,160
True story, uh, it was one of the biggest sponsorship offers I've ever received

2318
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:51,000
And I saw they offered the money first like in the email. They were like, this is how much we'll pay you

2319
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:53,560
um, and I was like

2320
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:59,800
Oh my god, I've never never been paid that much money before and then it was a gamble ad and I'm like, oh, that's that is why

2321
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,720
uh, so yeah

2322
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:11,960
How much money uh four thousand us dollars for a one minute advertising segment of a gamble advert a site

2323
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:14,920
The biggest offer I've ever had

2324
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:19,480
Uh, which was pretty insane. Uh, so we're just gonna finish the sequence and then we're all gonna be

2325
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:22,280
Yes

2326
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,720
and

2327
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:26,760
But will it pay for all the fallout? Yeah, literally, uh

2328
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:29,800
I was I'm like

2329
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:32,680
Obviously some people are

2330
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,400
You got it from a guard good guess

2331
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:44,280
To terrorize roma

2332
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:48,200
How do I find them? I can give you a general location

2333
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:55,080
I suggest looking for signs of distress nearby. Oh, perhaps you will uncover citizens. This isn't the end of the sequence

2334
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:00,600
I'm gonna wet myself. I'm not gonna lie. I've had like three glasses now

2335
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:07,480
Okay, I think I just need to hire two more recruits and then we can all go pee

2336
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:10,120
Claudia

2337
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:12,840
I have no idea

2338
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:19,320
I can do I can do I can do I can do virtue

2339
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:31,320
Okay, this is the claudia thing you must pay for mario stand

2340
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:39,640
I'll pee right now. I don't think I won

2341
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:44,600
I'm gonna do I'm gonna pee I'm not gonna pee

2342
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:55,720
Opportunity to assassinate the marizas will I take it? Oh, do not repeat your mistake

2343
02:37:08,280 --> 02:37:10,280
Okay

2344
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:15,480
It absolutely does not come across like that, but my brain

2345
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:27,320
Okay, it's this act almost done. Yes, we're gonna fix the aqueducts in roma as well. The briefings are right here

2346
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:34,360
Can I say something really bad

2347
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:39,080
I thought about being a don't a son reward a little

2348
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:42,920
apple juice or

2349
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:46,120
homemade slime

2350
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:50,840
I don't know if that's terrible or not

2351
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:57,240
But like I thought it would be funny if it was like you can have apple juice or homemade slime

2352
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:59,480
What would you like from this the cuttlefish?

2353
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:02,040
Um

2354
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:08,600
Because and it would be extra funny because I actually have really smelly apple juice

2355
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:11,960
So someone can inhale it and be like

2356
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:20,520
Okay, we did it fix her upper act four is when we get the brotherhood together officially

2357
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:25,320
I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll actually generate us income a den of thieves

2358
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:27,320
I have apps. I can't even remember what's in them

2359
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:33,800
Oh, no, is this when we go to the castello? I think this is a castello mission

2360
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:38,840
Right, I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll generate me some money in the background

2361
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:44,920
Please everyone, uh, get yourself new drinks if you need water or fizzy juice or whatever you may drink at the moment

2362
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:50,840
Um, please get up and stretch. I am with your peep. I will be roughly three minutes. I'm gonna maybe get a snack

2363
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:57,160
I actually boil this I boiled some eggs in preparation of this stream so I can grab a boiled egg and eat

2364
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:59,320
There's a snack

2365
02:38:59,560 --> 02:39:03,880
Because I don't have time to like make fit fit so I have boiled eggs. Okay, right

2366
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:06,360
I'm gonna let the game run in the background, but I'll meet my mic and all that jazz

2367
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,800
I'll open it like I'll open the game back up. So it's not just like pause pause, but I go pee

2368
02:39:27,160 --> 02:39:29,160
Oh

2369
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:59,160
Oh

2370
02:40:27,160 --> 02:40:29,160
Oh

2371
02:40:57,160 --> 02:40:59,160
Oh

2372
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:20,200
La carita

2373
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:29,160
Oh

2374
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:48,040
The dragon

2375
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:59,160
Oh

2376
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:29,160
Watch yourself

2377
02:42:57,160 --> 02:42:59,160
Oh

2378
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:01,160
Oh

2379
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,160
Oh

2380
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:33,160
Oh

2381
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:03,160
Oh

2382
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:29,160
Right I'm not being funny who here's a doctor because my piss was neon

2383
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:35,320
I'm like, is that really have bad and dehydrated?

2384
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:43,320
Oops, I'm currently eating a meat stick. I was gonna get the egg. Oh, I don't have enough money. Oh

2385
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:48,520
Glowing the dark honestly

2386
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:55,160
Right, we're gonna unlock the I keep wanting to call it the butchers the blacksmith

2387
02:44:55,160 --> 02:45:02,360
Did you guys pee and get water and stretch your legs instead?

2388
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:07,720
I don't even drink energy drink

2389
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:22,120
I'm eating meat and trying to play at the same time my mouth is stuffed full of meat. Oh

2390
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:24,200
Oh

2391
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:28,360
Beat your bars when they're trying to like do the most clippiest beat clip of ever hair

2392
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:31,640
Oh, my mouth is so full of meat

2393
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:39,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it. We get it. We know what game you're playing. It's fine

2394
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:48,920
Okay, I'm finishing up. Sorry for the people that don't like mouth sounds. I apologize

2395
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:58,120
Actually can't remember what happens in this sequence. My brain is blanking

2396
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:08,920
Well, it looks like I certainly should have taken the aqueduct because all right, we're going into the castello. Okay

2397
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:11,640
we're about to go

2398
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:19,000
See katharina of for Lee katharina. What's up for Lee? Um, she's currently stuck in a jail

2399
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:21,720
She's she got the jail. You know polis got um

2400
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:24,920
Say police and scott polis

2401
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:28,520
Actually, that's how you say it in uh gaelic as well. You say polis

2402
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:35,080
What are you eating? Uh, I said like a meat a stick of meat. Um, it's like a pepper ramy

2403
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:42,600
But it's called uh twizzle stick or something. Oh, shit. I don't want to get in trouble. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

2404
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:46,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Just part. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me part

2405
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:48,200
I

2406
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:50,440
That's what I didn't want to happen

2407
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,840
because I'm literally just trying to get into

2408
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:55,480
a memory right now

2409
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:59,800
Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything. Right. Well, that was your fault. You could have ignored me, but no no

2410
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:02,040
Oh, are they still looking for me?

2411
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:08,600
So that indicator means they're still looking but they've not been coded to come down the stairs or something because yeah

2412
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:10,600
They should have came down there, but they didn't

2413
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:13,240
Well, I ain't complaining. I never got in trouble. He

2414
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:16,200
Fuck you now. Do you see that flashbang?

2415
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:20,680
How does Haggis taste? I actually really like it. Um

2416
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:23,880
She whore of fourly

2417
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:32,440
I drinking lots of water to stop the neon

2418
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:45,560
Don't speak ill of the border

2419
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:49,640
It was Haggis. Haggis is a meat dish

2420
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:56,360
Keep your eyes on her eyes

2421
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:03,800
Girl spitting fire

2422
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:08,680
Haggis is a meat dish a native national

2423
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:12,840
It's not a national dish, I don't think

2424
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:14,600
Um

2425
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:16,840
Who goes there? Um by the pope, um

2426
02:48:18,680 --> 02:48:23,000
Sorry, I ain't and I had a bit of water. So that didn't work. Um

2427
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:25,880
It is

2428
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:28,840
I believe sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up

2429
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:34,840
Uh, and it's quite peppery and quite a peppery dish. Um, it's really nice

2430
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:41,880
Uh, you might have heard the phrase neeps and tatties. That means potatoes and turnip and it's just like a nice mash together

2431
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:47,320
It's really nice. I like it. Okay. So this one's like don't get caught but I couldn't be

2432
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:53,800
What will do the do not the don't get detected later because I actually don't even know how to do it

2433
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:58,360
So we're going to do it for the first time together. I've never done this section without being caught. So

2434
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:03,240
I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply

2435
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:08,360
Isn't Haggis a wee rodent? Oh, I is a wee animal. Um

2436
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:15,480
She cannot waver Haggis is mainly pork, is it?

2437
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:24,200
I don't think it's easily accessible like outside of the united kingdom

2438
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:31,880
Um, it is referred to as blood pudding. Oh, no, that's black. Uh, black pudding is different. Um

2439
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,320
For breakfast we do like, um

2440
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:41,400
It's a discus. So on the way I just a discus of um

2441
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:46,040
It's called black pudding, but Americans refer to as blood pudding

2442
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:51,800
But it is made of blood. So I do understand why they call it that. It's just we call it. It just sounds a bit barbaric

2443
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:54,440
But at the same time it's like, well, we are eating

2444
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:58,120
You know, I mean

2445
02:49:58,120 --> 02:50:00,120
No one cares

2446
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:05,320
Greetings greetings. You really say greens?

2447
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:07,640
Uh

2448
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:14,440
Right, let's kill him from above. Thank you very much. We are gonna have to come back on this

2449
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:20,120
Haggis is a savory pudding containing sheep's

2450
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:24,600
Sheep's pluck minced with chopped onion oatmeal

2451
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:28,360
Spices and salt mixed with stock and cooked with traditional

2452
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:32,680
I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go

2453
02:50:33,560 --> 02:50:37,240
I actually played this game so many times. I'm like completely sequenced out the weather

2454
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:44,120
But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section without being caught without a crossbow

2455
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:46,760
I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory

2456
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:53,160
Oh, no, go away. See that's the oh my god. No, no, no

2457
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,880
By the skin of our teeth

2458
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:00,680
Did that man not shoot?

2459
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:04,120
Oh my gosh

2460
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:07,640
By this skill

2461
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:12,280
By the skin of our teeth by our gamer skills as well. Yes, I give it to my gamers

2462
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:18,040
Oh my gosh, must have been the wind literally

2463
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:21,640
Their brother and sister by the way

2464
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:24,600
Oh

2465
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:32,440
How it looks so

2466
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:34,440
I'd rather like it open myself

2467
02:51:37,480 --> 02:51:40,360
Have you talked to the pope about the funds requested by my banker

2468
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:45,560
He is away from the castello. I do need some convincing when he returns

2469
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:48,440
That shouldn't be a problem

2470
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:51,400
I wish that was me for real for real

2471
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:57,560
It's a little time together

2472
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:01,160
Other conquests

2473
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:12,760
We'll be a thing of the past. I shout baby

2474
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:15,240
Oh

2475
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:17,400
Up at here yonking

2476
02:52:17,400 --> 02:52:19,000
We tag this up

2477
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:22,280
We tag the stream up to high heaven. We've got here yonking. We got kissing. We got

2478
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:25,080
Bendest

2479
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:27,080
A lot of things going on

2480
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:31,880
Uh, right. I'm not to go up. I think I'm just swing to the side. Yeah, surely

2481
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:34,920
Imagine if I went the wrong way

2482
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:40,280
Right now, right. So hold B and then yeah, you just grab on to everything you can kind of speak things of it

2483
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:43,240
And

2484
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:48,280
His ball was like one black thing shriveled up or something like that

2485
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:51,800
That spanyard guy

2486
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:55,160
Spanish were well then

2487
02:52:55,960 --> 02:52:58,840
To even get to that stage. Uh, not gonna lie. Not gonna lie. Uh

2488
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:03,480
Who goes there identify yourself

2489
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:06,840
What do we need to go up

2490
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:11,560
Square sausage. I miss square sausage if you didn't know

2491
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:17,560
In cheeky scotland for breakfast you do square sausage and it's literally a square of sausage meat

2492
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:24,360
And it's that wish it I have it on a roll way onion. How is the journey to roma?

2493
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:33,160
I can't remember your pathetic lucrezia. What did he talk about his plans for napoli? Did you like it?

2494
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:36,040
I can't remember. Perhaps you will remember this

2495
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:39,720
That's what you in your place

2496
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:41,720
Whamming on whamming violence

2497
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:45,560
It can't be

2498
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:48,360
Oh, you can put like tomato sauce on it's like tomato sauce

2499
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:50,680
fried onion

2500
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:55,320
In square sausage on a roll soon simple simple brave simple

2501
02:53:56,360 --> 02:53:58,360
Can you get more simple on that?

2502
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:05,320
Right on the hip as well like, uh, excuse me. Uh, sorry that actually really hurt and I need to say for it

2503
02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:07,960
Please that actually really hurt. Please don't do that again

2504
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:10,520
Lucrezia Borgia

2505
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:16,920
Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right you can be like not detected by the guards somehow

2506
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:19,720
Yeah, like literally he doesn't yeah

2507
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:25,240
So at least we know that for when we do play the 100 not detection segment

2508
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:28,440
And then there should be a guard to our left

2509
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:34,200
Well, we we don't need to not be detected right now. So it's fine

2510
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:38,040
The safe word is more

2511
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:41,080
What do you think is still it was being the safe word for

2512
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:44,200
a sheep's skate

2513
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:51,800
Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him and then that'll be how we won't get detected surely

2514
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:55,960
Yay castello crash

2515
02:54:59,880 --> 02:55:03,000
Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce

2516
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:07,000
Is a bit of harry polter sauce with hp

2517
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:09,960
It's that sauce or ketchup

2518
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:13,160
I'm gonna say something really dumb

2519
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:15,560
I don't know the difference between

2520
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:19,080
Tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup

2521
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:22,040
Ain't they the sale? Aren't they the same?

2522
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Aren't they the same?

2523
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:29,960
Phil's sink failed. Yes, we will be coming back to fully sink at later thing right now

2524
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:35,080
Um, oh my god that per guy. I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here

2525
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:38,040
um

2526
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:40,840
Brand one has sugar one doesn't

2527
02:55:42,360 --> 02:55:44,680
I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then

2528
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:50,280
Uh, this is this section can be a little bit finicky. Uh

2529
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,160
I want to sing it from the heavens

2530
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:03,480
Who knows what he would do these holes in loyal

2531
02:56:08,680 --> 02:56:10,680
He killed my my husband. Oh

2532
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:14,040
For real for real

2533
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:19,000
Nope ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients. Oh my god, not kidding

2534
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:25,960
She got a point ketchup has a ton of sugar. Okay, whatever the sugary one was. I like it. Okay, brain says yum

2535
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:32,120
Yes, oh

2536
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:34,200
She playing she said

2537
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:37,880
Guess what? I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here

2538
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:47,640
He loves me. No, I don't think he loves you him. Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff

2539
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:52,280
Hello

2540
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:54,680
Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes

2541
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:57,320
Wow

2542
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:00,920
Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack

2543
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:08,120
He would have enjoyed this guards

2544
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:15,800
Jump on you and say, oh, that's what happens in the ASMR booth. Well stays in the boost. Well happens with boost stays in the booth

2545
02:57:17,560 --> 02:57:22,840
I see that premium pass around your neck. Yank. I'm jumping on you. Okay. Thanks for supporting me

2546
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,840
All right, we're just gonna have to wait for these guys to attack because they are such a nightmare

2547
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:32,280
Literally it's just so much faster to let them attack and then

2548
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:38,440
Right, oh

2549
02:57:38,520 --> 02:57:40,520
I think I just next

2550
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:44,040
The jump scare

2551
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:47,080
Foxy jump scare

2552
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:50,360
Princesses from castles now

2553
02:57:51,320 --> 02:57:53,720
All right, all right, right

2554
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:58,920
So this is really awkward if Lucretia gets away like back to that starting station

2555
02:57:59,560 --> 02:58:03,400
She will spawn out of bounds and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it

2556
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:06,680
And you have to restart this section again. It's so annoying

2557
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:12,040
Uh, thankfully, uh, the last few times I've played this game. It's not happened

2558
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:14,360
But when it does happen is so annoying

2559
02:58:15,240 --> 02:58:17,560
Oh my god, it's so annoying Lucretia

2560
02:58:18,360 --> 02:58:26,440
Um, if you can get excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down and you just whacked me with that freaking weapon. Stop it

2561
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:29,720
You're upsetting me

2562
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:37,160
Don't upset me. Oh my god. Please do not do a finishing move if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move to look

2563
02:58:37,240 --> 02:58:39,240
Really good

2564
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:41,720
The passing was your hand was finished

2565
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:45,080
And their memories are raced

2566
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:47,320
Oh no, the tombstones are raced

2567
02:58:52,840 --> 02:58:57,160
Uh, see she does that see if she jumps out you have to go grab her

2568
02:58:57,800 --> 02:59:04,200
However, if the people are attacking you then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them

2569
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:09,720
Oh my god, is she actually getting away? I'm getting nervous. Stop. I'm getting nervous. Okay. No, she's she's saying so

2570
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:11,960
Stop it. Lucretia. Lucretia

2571
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:17,960
Hey, hey, calm down. Let me just kidnap you. I mean come on. Come on. Let me just kidnap you. Okay

2572
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:20,680
Let me just kidnap you

2573
02:59:21,880 --> 02:59:23,880
She like it really come on

2574
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:29,240
Look your man's no gaining any attention and look at me. I'm picking you up. I'm throwing you a boot

2575
02:59:29,240 --> 02:59:32,760
This is exactly what you're wanting. Hey, look at this. Yeah, I didn't face that

2576
02:59:33,320 --> 02:59:35,320
Didn't I? I don't face it

2577
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:37,320
But I'm willing to see them

2578
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:41,960
Okay, that's right. That's right. Just accept that

2579
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:46,760
This is so weird. I'm sorry

2580
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:55,160
My words are wasted. Hippocrita. No, no, come on

2581
02:59:57,080 --> 03:00:00,600
Okay, we did it. My words are wasted here. Hippocrita

2582
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:04,600
Salute, Lucretia. Just kidnap me, Strony

2583
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:09,800
Oh

2584
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:15,240
Crank sale. Those are some big words. You're not supposed to say that stuff. Oh bib sweat detected

2585
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:19,400
Strony be taking tips from mercy

2586
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,760
That's enough

2587
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:25,720
Can you walk? No

2588
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:29,240
Hey smart camera bin. Yes, we are going out the front

2589
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:32,200
Okay

2590
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:37,480
Do not be detected again another do not be detected, but there's two guards literally dead ahead

2591
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:40,680
How am I not to be detected by them when we play this for real?

2592
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:43,560
Did they come in here?

2593
03:00:43,880 --> 03:00:46,840
No, this cannot be. Did they actually come in here?

2594
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:51,640
Okay one

2595
03:00:52,120 --> 03:00:54,120
Is

2596
03:00:55,720 --> 03:01:01,720
No, okay, how am I supposed to deal with two of them at once when we do it for real?

2597
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:11,320
Uh, you better calm down hen. I'm rescuing you Christina. Didn't get on at me about taking so long. Where are you going?

2598
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:15,320
Catarina

2599
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:20,600
I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams. Oh, it's just absolute word vomit. I promise you

2600
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Absolutely, nothing makes sense

2601
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:28,520
Uh, my accent gets a little off the wee bit when I like whisper, but it's not really a big deal. Like I can make it like I can

2602
03:01:29,160 --> 03:01:31,160
enhance

2603
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:36,200
All about that

2604
03:01:37,320 --> 03:01:41,320
Yes, yes, yes, I know you gave me your hole so I'd protect you. It's oh

2605
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:45,560
Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye

2606
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:47,720
Bye

2607
03:01:47,960 --> 03:01:49,960
I do be a really skilled assassin

2608
03:01:51,640 --> 03:01:53,640
Ready

2609
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:57,800
Don't you dare

2610
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:04,760
He's just like me for real for real. He literally went

2611
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:10,440
We're actually it's an auditory confirmed

2612
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:15,160
Never do that to me again

2613
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:20,600
Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff. It's all torn at the bottom

2614
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:23,240
Oh, also you can walk on barrels

2615
03:02:23,800 --> 03:02:27,000
If you wanted to know that you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people

2616
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:32,360
It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it

2617
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:40,360
Okay, we pop you down there pet the eagle and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle all for you, mate

2618
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:42,920
and we just pick up the lady again

2619
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:45,720
And then basically

2620
03:02:46,120 --> 03:02:50,440
If you pop her down in the middle, I think you can access both gates without losing

2621
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:52,280
distance

2622
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:55,640
It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her

2623
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:58,280
But

2624
03:02:59,480 --> 03:03:00,760
Um

2625
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:05,800
No, I was gonna walk away. I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life

2626
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:13,160
How could you be such a silly you know, I think we actually might have to move her over. Whoa

2627
03:03:13,960 --> 03:03:15,960
Did you guys see what I just saw?

2628
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:22,920
Oh, leave me alone. No, no, you don't see me. I'm just going up the stairs. I'm just a tourist. I'm a fissure. Okay. I'm a fissure of the

2629
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:29,240
I thought I was gonna desync there. I got scared. I thought I was gonna

2630
03:03:31,400 --> 03:03:33,960
I saw her her panties

2631
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:39,560
And I didn't even have to pay anything. I saw them for free

2632
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:47,960
Wait, can that guy see me again? Oh, uh, I think we're gonna have to do the old uh ear assassination

2633
03:03:49,800 --> 03:03:55,080
All right, can we hey, uh, excuse me sir sir. I just moved over to do an ear assassination. Thank you

2634
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:58,200
Okay, there we go

2635
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:01,400
The audio is strange again. It better not be

2636
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:03,720
Why

2637
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:10,680
Why I literally nothing has changed

2638
03:04:13,080 --> 03:04:20,360
I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times. Okay, so it's gonna like pause and then open back up and pause and open back up

2639
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:27,880
There's a steak noise sound like a steak review

2640
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:33,160
If I have to close the game again, I will

2641
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:43,000
A decent warning like it sounds perfectly fine for me still there

2642
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:55,160
Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now it's still buzzing

2643
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:58,200
Do you know what buzzing means in scott's it means you're really

2644
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:08,360
A feature I know has this you can just restart the audio capture. I mean right hold on controversial move. I know

2645
03:05:11,640 --> 03:05:15,800
How does that sound does that sound normal?

2646
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:21,480
I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game

2647
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:29,720
Okay, I I can know you're literally gonna hear if one of the girls DM me on discord. That's the only thing

2648
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:35,640
Okay, let's get across rich risky. I know you're all gonna know that I'm

2649
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:39,320
I've I've arranged another ASMR collab

2650
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:43,640
Uh, like literally 30 minutes before the stream started

2651
03:05:44,200 --> 03:05:49,400
I like burst into someone's DMs on twitter and I was like, hey girls. Do you want to add me?

2652
03:05:50,360 --> 03:05:54,360
I thought I was talking to her about ASMR collab and I've already planned it

2653
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:58,520
It's not a big ASMR it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah

2654
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:03,080
Okay, uh, we have a timer. We basically just have to survive

2655
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:09,160
So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again, but it gets a bit iffy

2656
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:12,680
It's not the best. I will mess up

2657
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:18,040
And we're the enemies go away citizen. I don't want to kill anymore

2658
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:25,640
Uh, I'm going to try and kill the wee guys first because they grab me like that and ruin my streak

2659
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
Okay, sorry, I'm focusing

2660
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:35,400
See when they grab you it takes you out of your kill streak advantage and there's lancers as well

2661
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:38,040
I can see that lancer. I'm going to try and take him out in the kill streak

2662
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:40,680
okay

2663
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:44,120
I'm trying to get the lancer and it keeps all into the other guys

2664
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:47,080
Come on

2665
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:48,840
wee guy next

2666
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:55,320
Armor guy next I guess he's probably the best, but okay. I can't break his armor. So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy

2667
03:06:57,560 --> 03:06:59,000
Okay

2668
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:04,440
We're getting there. We're getting there 30 more seconds. Do not grab me. I hate when they grab me. Oh

2669
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,800
No, no, no, not the horse. Not the horse. Not the horse

2670
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:12,280
I said I'm hiding from the horse get me in the hay bale

2671
03:07:13,880 --> 03:07:18,440
I'm scared of the horses. I actually don't know how to take down horse guys

2672
03:07:19,720 --> 03:07:24,680
Ah, ouch. Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy. We've got seven seconds

2673
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:28,680
We just need to not get hit because we can run away in two seconds

2674
03:07:29,720 --> 03:07:32,040
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

2675
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:39,080
Oh my god

2676
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:45,400
Okay, so in this sequence you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map if you come on the roof

2677
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:49,800
Uh, you can basically run along it as much as you need

2678
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:57,000
Or if you don't like rooftop scaling there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range

2679
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:04,760
Bruh, bruh get off my roof. No

2680
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:11,640
Uh, and then if we disappear in the water, maybe I think we can hide in the water

2681
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:14,440
You can like literally hide in the water

2682
03:08:15,880 --> 03:08:17,880
I'm a call fish. Let's go

2683
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:20,840
Can they see me?

2684
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:22,360
I'm

2685
03:08:22,360 --> 03:08:31,400
Physically, yes, they can see me, but uh game development wise. No, they can't so uh, I enjoyed that do that again more game, please

2686
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:37,480
Okay, we're gonna kill this guy. Sorry. I'm sorry mate. Your time is up

2687
03:08:37,480 --> 03:08:39,480
Oh

2688
03:08:39,640 --> 03:08:42,200
I forget. Okay. If you scare away

2689
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:47,800
You won't be able to right. We're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site

2690
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:54,840
Um, if you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you. Um, and it is very oh the poster is down here

2691
03:08:54,920 --> 03:08:59,400
I have been I've been fooled. The egg is on my face. Uh

2692
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:02,280
right

2693
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:04,600
We need to now go back to

2694
03:09:05,560 --> 03:09:07,560
The island tied out

2695
03:09:08,120 --> 03:09:09,880
because

2696
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:11,880
Catarina's forces

2697
03:09:12,520 --> 03:09:13,560
and

2698
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:19,400
Then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it

2699
03:09:19,960 --> 03:09:23,080
And everything is so cool. Everything's so awesome

2700
03:09:25,080 --> 03:09:27,320
Uh, we're just gonna all right. Here we go yank

2701
03:09:28,600 --> 03:09:31,080
He said enough a young come on for her enough

2702
03:09:32,360 --> 03:09:34,040
enough

2703
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:36,040
Is it enough?

2704
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:38,040
Don't you not want to give more?

2705
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:46,360
Okay, this is the only problem when navigating what a horse you have to can

2706
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:51,240
You're like stuck to using whatever roads have passed out and it gets really um

2707
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,040
finicky

2708
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:56,040
It's a bit

2709
03:09:57,080 --> 03:09:59,080
You know what I mean? Is this a bank? Have I unlocked it?

2710
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:07,080
How would you bother you just gone down to it folks?

2711
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:10,600
If you come on the roof should you click?

2712
03:10:11,960 --> 03:10:14,440
I never even said that that was you that said that

2713
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:22,120
Normally, I'm the one coming out with the outrageous. Uh, I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank

2714
03:10:25,320 --> 03:10:29,800
Hey horse, can you come out here? Thanks appreciate it like oh, okay

2715
03:10:34,120 --> 03:10:37,720
Oh, we made 1.5 Florence

2716
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:40,280
That's pretty good

2717
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:44,200
I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that i'm hoping to get it by

2718
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:50,600
Uh, I don't know why we lost all our money. Don't know how it happened something something don't gamble at home people. Uh

2719
03:10:52,040 --> 03:10:54,040
But may have lost all our money in that

2720
03:10:54,280 --> 03:10:56,760
Uh, right where is the bridge?

2721
03:10:57,800 --> 03:10:59,800
Bridge is over here. Okay

2722
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,080
Got a stile in them peasants

2723
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:06,760
Horse is the first customer of the store for real for real

2724
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:09,480
Munching on that. Hey

2725
03:11:12,760 --> 03:11:14,760
Okay, we have made it to the island

2726
03:11:17,160 --> 03:11:21,640
Never gamble with your own money gamble with someone else's that's terrible. Don't gamble all

2727
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:25,080
Save that mula

2728
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:31,000
Get yourself a weave as ages from the corner shop. Maybe are we bakery? Are we scorn?

2729
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:37,640
Looking for it in the bank. What's the cesarean rodrigo?

2730
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:43,320
Cesarei rode out before I could get close to him and rodrigo was somewhere else entirely

2731
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:45,880
That is odd

2732
03:11:45,880 --> 03:11:47,880
rodrigo is normally at the castle

2733
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:50,760
Very odd indeed

2734
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,640
What a waste so levopey thinks

2735
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:58,360
That marky velly tipped off cesarean to leave the castle

2736
03:11:59,240 --> 03:12:01,240
So we're all suspicious right now

2737
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:08,840
Impossible cesarei commands a massive army in romagna. You would never reach. Thank you. I say we work here

2738
03:12:09,400 --> 03:12:10,520
What?

2739
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:13,240
They rode the borja's influence while restoring our own

2740
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:18,840
And in fact, I want to make it right now. Yes. We're doing it

2741
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:22,440
Machiavelli, meet me outside

2742
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:25,320
Take care of her

2743
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:31,000
We're doing it. We're about to get the brotherhood. Come on reeflings. I want to turn you guys into assassins

2744
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:34,200
I'm gonna turn you to deadly weapons

2745
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:38,040
The borja rob everything from the people to maintain power

2746
03:12:39,160 --> 03:12:41,160
What do you intend to do?

2747
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:46,120
We will recruit him to our cause. You cannot be serious to win this war machiavelli

2748
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:50,600
Win the loyal soldiers. Come on reeflings. You'd let me draft you right?

2749
03:12:52,760 --> 03:12:54,760
All right, let's get drafted

2750
03:12:56,040 --> 03:13:00,520
I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield. Okay. I'm healing you guys on the battlefield

2751
03:13:01,320 --> 03:13:03,320
with my

2752
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:08,040
Oh my god, the cutscene took so long that wait

2753
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:16,040
Whoa, I've never seen this happen for two recruits spawned and the cutscene took so long. They both died in the instance

2754
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:18,440
Oh my god

2755
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:21,560
All right, she's still alive. Let's save her. Oh my god

2756
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:28,840
It's shrek and no, no, no, no. We've just attracted more guards. This is terrible. She has incredibly low health

2757
03:13:29,080 --> 03:13:30,280
Oh

2758
03:13:30,280 --> 03:13:33,080
Goodness me. Oh goodness me. Oh goodness gravy

2759
03:13:34,120 --> 03:13:38,680
Please don't perish. I hope she doesn't perish because we're actually gonna have to okay. We she didn't perish like goodness

2760
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:42,200
Already sold my life

2761
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:44,680
What did you sell your life to?

2762
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:48,280
Sin

2763
03:13:49,800 --> 03:13:53,800
It's a lady assassin. You'll never guess what I do to the lady

2764
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:59,560
Okay, we're gonna open up the map and the map will tell us where the next recruit is so we can go recruit this person

2765
03:14:01,720 --> 03:14:04,760
And now we are about to unlock

2766
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:11,000
Assassin recruit signals, which means in the middle of a fight we can literally ask the game to help us

2767
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:13,800
And there's also a really fun minigame

2768
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:18,440
Where you can level them up and make them even stronger to the point where they can fight

2769
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:21,960
Incredibly strong enemies and it is so satisfying

2770
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:28,120
Watching their health bars go up. Oh, look, I have it already actually. I'm gonna use it for

2771
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:32,600
This citizen if I can get to them in time before they perish

2772
03:14:33,560 --> 03:14:35,560
and

2773
03:14:35,880 --> 03:14:40,120
Uh, here we go. Oh, it's another lady. Oh my god. We're like doing all ladies in this

2774
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:43,320
Assassin group. Oh, oops my bad

2775
03:14:44,040 --> 03:14:46,040
You can't really oh

2776
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:51,800
Oh, okay. Oh, hold on. Let me go. Let me get up. Okay. We're oh my gosh

2777
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:55,160
This has increased brotherhood more like the sisterhood

2778
03:14:56,120 --> 03:14:58,120
Am I right? Ha ha

2779
03:15:01,320 --> 03:15:04,680
Hopefully we can get a few guys in here. We need to repopulate roma. You know what I'm saying?

2780
03:15:06,520 --> 03:15:10,680
Uh, let's unlock the doctors because we can get more money in general

2781
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:16,520
The strong door calls for aid. Oh, me on Christmas like

2782
03:15:18,280 --> 03:15:20,280
Okay, I have a new lead base cure for syphilis

2783
03:15:21,320 --> 03:15:23,320
What did he say?

2784
03:15:25,480 --> 03:15:29,960
I don't think I've ever heard that. I've got a new lead base cure for syphilis

2785
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:32,760
I didn't know that was in the game

2786
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:35,640
That's outrageous

2787
03:15:35,720 --> 03:15:40,840
Right, we're going to go pick up this other assassin recruit because they're like a hundred meters away

2788
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:49,080
Uh, that's absolutely hilarious. Um, and we're also going to send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission

2789
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:56,360
Which is how you level up the assassins and you get a stupendous amount of money for it. Um

2790
03:15:57,400 --> 03:16:05,560
So I get 650 florns for six minutes. I send this person away for so this is your biggest money maker is sending your assassin recruits away

2791
03:16:06,120 --> 03:16:11,320
Um, so we may be able to get the crossbow ball if I dilly dally and do a few safe place things

2792
03:16:11,960 --> 03:16:15,400
Uh, or we can just brush through the it's not really brushing because

2793
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:18,440
It's just playing the campaign. But yeah

2794
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:22,920
I'll have to say nothing is true. Everything is permitted for real

2795
03:16:24,520 --> 03:16:30,040
I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction. Where's the citizen?

2796
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:35,080
Oh, they're already fighting. Oh the citizen might die

2797
03:16:36,360 --> 03:16:44,360
Oh, why is this building so tall? Oh, can I get them? Can I save you? I'm coming. I'm coming

2798
03:16:45,320 --> 03:16:51,720
I'm helping I'm helping okay. We got it. We got it. We got it. Okay. Good. Oh, no, there's more guards that come in

2799
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:53,880
Oh, I don't know how low his hp is

2800
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:59,400
The recruits. Oh the recruits. The recruits are so bad at the game as well. I'm so bad at the game

2801
03:17:00,440 --> 03:17:03,080
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. No

2802
03:17:03,080 --> 03:17:04,960
Oh, oh, oh, come on, you can do it.

2803
03:17:04,960 --> 03:17:08,160
Okay, oh, oh, we did it.

2804
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,240
I instantly, you want to pick up the recruit

2805
03:17:10,240 --> 03:17:13,160
because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.

2806
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:16,000
Mirigracia, Mirigracia, Mirigracia.

2807
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,920
And for the right reasons, it seems.

2808
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:20,760
Could you use another blade by your side?

2809
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:22,880
Weapon of instruction.

2810
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:24,280
Achievements, brotherhood.

2811
03:17:27,580 --> 03:17:28,720
If we had gamer score,

2812
03:17:28,720 --> 03:17:31,160
we'd probably have like 200 venerals.

2813
03:17:31,160 --> 03:17:33,680
Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.

2814
03:17:33,680 --> 03:17:35,040
We've done three places,

2815
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:37,440
so we're allowed to have three recruits.

2816
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:39,520
We've done four places, excuse me,

2817
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,600
so we're allowed to have four recruits.

2818
03:17:42,560 --> 03:17:44,120
I literally just remembered.

2819
03:17:45,760 --> 03:17:50,040
We can go to the main quest, which is down here.

2820
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:54,080
There's actually someone we can recruit over here.

2821
03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:55,680
Nah, we'll go to the main quest

2822
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:57,000
and we'll pick up recruits on the way.

2823
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,600
We've got a fill bar of recruits.

2824
03:17:58,600 --> 03:18:00,280
Unfortunately, they're very weak,

2825
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:01,680
so it's not very good.

2826
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:03,360
I'm chasing after you, my recruits.

2827
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:08,960
It's not very good to send them to battle

2828
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:11,080
without kind of leveling them up first,

2829
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:13,560
because your recruits can perish in a fight,

2830
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:14,640
unironically.

2831
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:19,720
Yeah, your assassins can die.

2832
03:18:19,720 --> 03:18:21,160
It's very dangerous.

2833
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:27,060
Across the bridges are our first mission.

2834
03:18:27,060 --> 03:18:28,800
These missions are all based around calling

2835
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:31,200
your assassin recruits in,

2836
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:34,240
but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds

2837
03:18:34,240 --> 03:18:36,760
to refresh from when they disappear,

2838
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:37,920
not from when you call them in,

2839
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:39,760
from when they disappear off the map.

2840
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:45,760
And some of the missions, they take a hot second.

2841
03:18:45,840 --> 03:18:49,040
It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,

2842
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:50,760
so the more Borgia towers you destroy,

2843
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:52,520
the more recruits you're allowed,

2844
03:18:52,520 --> 03:18:56,560
and you've got a maximum of three bars,

2845
03:18:56,600 --> 03:19:00,200
so six Borgia towers.

2846
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:02,160
Where the heck am I going?

2847
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:04,520
Oh, this one, I remember.

2848
03:19:04,520 --> 03:19:07,800
Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.

2849
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:10,320
Oh, my fatal.

2850
03:19:10,320 --> 03:19:13,000
This is another multiplayer character that we kill.

2851
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:17,280
We must follow the hose.

2852
03:19:18,480 --> 03:19:21,200
So they will point to where we need to go,

2853
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:23,680
but I have played this game many a time now,

2854
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:26,480
so you can't just keep running in general.

2855
03:19:27,320 --> 03:19:29,880
Running, running, running, running, running,

2856
03:19:29,880 --> 03:19:32,800
running, running, running, running.

2857
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:35,640
Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,

2858
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:38,960
and we should get a taity sum of money for doing so.

2859
03:19:39,800 --> 03:19:43,160
So running, running, running, running.

2860
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:45,320
I've actually never tried to break this sequence

2861
03:19:45,320 --> 03:19:47,920
and go outside of what the girls point you to.

2862
03:19:48,840 --> 03:19:50,840
Um, yeah.

2863
03:19:50,840 --> 03:19:54,080
So I've called my recruit.

2864
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:55,400
I don't know where she is.

2865
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:56,720
She's taking her sweet time, right?

2866
03:19:56,720 --> 03:19:57,720
There you go.

2867
03:19:57,720 --> 03:19:59,240
Get him!

2868
03:19:59,240 --> 03:20:01,800
And then we've 100% of that already.

2869
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:02,640
I'm going to shower.

2870
03:20:02,640 --> 03:20:05,040
Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.

2871
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:06,040
I'm teasing.

2872
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:07,160
Enjoy your shower.

2873
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:08,600
Don't forget to do your belly button

2874
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:09,760
and behind your ears.

2875
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:11,600
A lot of people forget.

2876
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:13,680
And make sure you soap all over,

2877
03:20:13,680 --> 03:20:16,400
even on your booty hole, soap cleans itself

2878
03:20:16,400 --> 03:20:18,480
due to the nature of it.

2879
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:24,320
Not that you're expecting a visitor any time soon, are you?

2880
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:25,040
Eh?

2881
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:26,360
What?

2882
03:20:26,360 --> 03:20:27,680
Ehehe.

2883
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:30,600
Um, do you get a lot of money if you loot?

2884
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:33,200
No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.

2885
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:34,800
Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.

2886
03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:38,800
Oh, oh, oh.

2887
03:20:38,800 --> 03:20:39,840
No, they're fighting.

2888
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:41,840
Stop fighting before I even get there.

2889
03:20:41,840 --> 03:20:43,480
My goodness.

2890
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:44,240
Stop it!

2891
03:20:44,240 --> 03:20:45,280
Stop it!

2892
03:20:46,280 --> 03:20:47,520
I'm coming to hell.

2893
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:48,360
Give me a second.

2894
03:20:48,360 --> 03:20:49,600
Let me cook.

2895
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:52,840
Oh my god, I've just invited even more guards to come over.

2896
03:20:52,840 --> 03:20:53,960
Oh, please don't.

2897
03:20:53,960 --> 03:20:56,520
I don't know how damaged it is.

2898
03:20:56,520 --> 03:20:59,000
Please don't do a cutscene.

2899
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:03,800
There's too many enemies around right now for this.

2900
03:21:03,800 --> 03:21:06,360
Oh, oops.

2901
03:21:06,360 --> 03:21:08,520
I am actually going to pick up these bodies

2902
03:21:08,520 --> 03:21:09,920
and put them in the hay bale.

2903
03:21:09,920 --> 03:21:11,920
Because if you put five in a hay bale,

2904
03:21:11,920 --> 03:21:14,000
you do a cortisol challenge.

2905
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:15,120
I'm just going to do this now.

2906
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:16,480
So I'm not going to talk to them.

2907
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:18,680
I'm literally going to save his life and then just be like,

2908
03:21:18,680 --> 03:21:20,520
excuse me, I'm just trying to hide the evidence of what

2909
03:21:20,520 --> 03:21:21,840
we've just committed together.

2910
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:30,800
Mother Mary.

2911
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:32,920
No, not the sword, the body.

2912
03:21:32,920 --> 03:21:34,840
No, the body.

2913
03:21:34,840 --> 03:21:36,520
Thank you.

2914
03:21:36,520 --> 03:21:37,760
No requiesce de parte.

2915
03:21:41,560 --> 03:21:43,880
And one more body should do it.

2916
03:21:43,880 --> 03:21:47,000
No, not the weapon, the body.

2917
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Taking up the trench.

2918
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:52,000
Taking up the trench.

2919
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:54,240
OK, there we go.

2920
03:21:54,240 --> 03:21:55,400
You know what always bothered me?

2921
03:21:55,400 --> 03:21:57,000
When you kill some evil bloke and then

2922
03:21:57,000 --> 03:22:01,720
Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe, he has.

2923
03:22:01,720 --> 03:22:02,960
Whoa, what was that?

2924
03:22:02,960 --> 03:22:04,960
Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?

2925
03:22:04,960 --> 03:22:06,240
Can you help me?

2926
03:22:06,240 --> 03:22:07,440
I would gladly fight for it.

2927
03:22:07,440 --> 03:22:09,160
The camera is so good in this game.

2928
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:12,680
Like it's so busy.

2929
03:22:12,680 --> 03:22:17,320
Do you guys remember the asset repeating?

2930
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:21,240
I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated right

2931
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:23,080
in this next quest.

2932
03:22:23,080 --> 03:22:27,720
So remember how he was holding his arm and he was injured?

2933
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:29,320
Well, guess what?

2934
03:22:29,320 --> 03:22:33,680
This is where they reuse the asset on this little crying kid.

2935
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:36,360
Don't worry, there's not a random kid crying in your headset.

2936
03:22:36,360 --> 03:22:39,240
It's part of the game.

2937
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:44,400
This is a shrunken down version of that guy that got injured.

2938
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:46,880
Not at this stage, but it's the same cause and all that.

2939
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:49,760
And when he walks away, you can see it.

2940
03:22:49,760 --> 03:22:52,560
OK, so stare at him.

2941
03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:54,640
We know you use reused assets.

2942
03:22:54,640 --> 03:22:55,560
You be soft.

2943
03:22:55,560 --> 03:22:56,040
We know.

2944
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:03,560
Sleepless.

2945
03:23:03,560 --> 03:23:07,480
You are scary, but you look very brave.

2946
03:23:08,480 --> 03:23:10,800
Can you bring my mama back?

2947
03:23:10,800 --> 03:23:12,240
Right, now watch him walk away.

2948
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:17,640
You think you can distract me, video game?

2949
03:23:17,640 --> 03:23:21,040
I'm on to your secrets.

2950
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:22,920
You might as well have me on the dev team.

2951
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:24,960
Look at this walk.

2952
03:23:24,960 --> 03:23:26,200
He's injured.

2953
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:28,000
I can see it.

2954
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:29,560
You can't hide that from me.

2955
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:31,520
I've played this game far too many times.

2956
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:35,880
That is the injured thief asset reused.

2957
03:23:35,880 --> 03:23:39,560
You can't get away from me.

2958
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:42,160
Honestly, I wonder if there is behind the scenes development

2959
03:23:42,160 --> 03:23:43,800
of Brotherhood, because I actually

2960
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:45,200
haven't consumed any of that.

2961
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:50,320
And if there is, I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.

2962
03:23:50,320 --> 03:23:53,600
Among other things, after looking at Marshmallow.

2963
03:23:56,600 --> 03:23:59,960
OK, we do have two assassin signals, which is really good.

2964
03:23:59,960 --> 03:24:03,840
But I should probably send the recruits away just to get

2965
03:24:03,840 --> 03:24:04,840
stronger.

2966
03:24:04,880 --> 03:24:07,200
But not right now, because we're in the middle of a secret.

2967
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:09,600
I'm just going to start upgrading stuff as I find them.

2968
03:24:13,760 --> 03:24:15,640
Injured thief number 312.

2969
03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:21,920
OK, camera angle, please.

2970
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:24,080
Ow, I just bumped into those guards.

2971
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:26,400
They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that.

2972
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:27,760
But I guess not.

2973
03:24:27,760 --> 03:24:30,640
Right, we have two assassin signals, which is good.

2974
03:24:30,640 --> 03:24:32,400
Actually, I'm going to send them a fight

2975
03:24:32,400 --> 03:24:38,840
to get some experience, because I need to get them strong.

2976
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:42,040
So we're just going to watch them do their thing.

2977
03:24:42,040 --> 03:24:46,320
Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.

2978
03:24:46,320 --> 03:24:49,640
Yep, take your time.

2979
03:24:49,640 --> 03:24:52,640
They get XP every time you call them into a battle or send them

2980
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:53,320
on missions.

2981
03:24:53,320 --> 03:24:54,840
It's not a problem.

2982
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,600
There we go, and the respawn.

2983
03:24:56,600 --> 03:24:57,960
It's all good.

2984
03:24:57,960 --> 03:25:01,000
We will keep another signal to do this mission, though,

2985
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:04,440
because to get 100%, you have to send your signal

2986
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:05,280
to kill the person.

2987
03:25:05,280 --> 03:25:06,920
Again, another multiplayer character,

2988
03:25:06,920 --> 03:25:08,760
which is why they're so designed.

2989
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:13,600
Out my way, you moth head.

2990
03:25:13,600 --> 03:25:14,920
I can't really remember.

2991
03:25:14,920 --> 03:25:18,840
He looks behind you on the bridge a lot.

2992
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:20,280
And I like to write on corners.

2993
03:25:20,280 --> 03:25:21,360
It's quite funny, actually.

2994
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:27,120
You don't ever use the recruits.

2995
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:27,760
Are you joking?

2996
03:25:27,760 --> 03:25:29,480
That's the best part about this game.

2997
03:25:29,480 --> 03:25:31,680
If you suck at video gaming, you can literally just

2998
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:35,200
call in the recruits to do everything for you.

2999
03:25:35,200 --> 03:25:38,920
He should start running in a second.

3000
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:40,920
No, around the corner, he runs, because we're

3001
03:25:40,920 --> 03:25:41,880
to go over there.

3002
03:25:48,120 --> 03:25:51,080
He's like, yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge

3003
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:53,800
that looks threatening to me whatsoever.

3004
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:57,760
Me just standing, not even hiding in the crowd or anything,

3005
03:25:57,760 --> 03:25:59,880
and stops.

3006
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:01,440
Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.

3007
03:26:01,440 --> 03:26:03,000
That's the biggest thing about tailing.

3008
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,000
If that NPC bumps them, they can turn around

3009
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:06,080
and look you right in the eyes.

3010
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:09,800
And you're like, oops, you're not really supposed to do that.

3011
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:11,920
He literally has a knife out.

3012
03:26:11,920 --> 03:26:14,680
And we're going to, I think he looks back here.

3013
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:17,640
And then, yeah, I remembered.

3014
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:18,680
He looks back here.

3015
03:26:18,680 --> 03:26:20,920
And then he looks back after he does a sprint

3016
03:26:20,920 --> 03:26:22,920
on top of the stairs.

3017
03:26:22,920 --> 03:26:23,920
You're getting all the strats.

3018
03:26:23,920 --> 03:26:25,840
So he doesn't look back anymore unless he gets

3019
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:28,720
bumped, which he shouldn't.

3020
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:29,640
No, he didn't.

3021
03:26:29,640 --> 03:26:30,040
He didn't.

3022
03:26:30,040 --> 03:26:33,000
That's good.

3023
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,720
And then he's about to break out in a sprint.

3024
03:26:35,720 --> 03:26:38,320
Hey, that's right.

3025
03:26:38,320 --> 03:26:40,360
And then you follow him.

3026
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:42,620
And then the game wants you to say,

3027
03:26:42,620 --> 03:26:47,360
ooh, I don't think he should have turned around at that point.

3028
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,400
No, he shouldn't have.

3029
03:26:48,400 --> 03:26:49,640
I don't know why he did.

3030
03:26:49,640 --> 03:26:52,160
He's not coded to turn around at that section.

3031
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:56,040
He's coded to turn around at the top of these stairs

3032
03:26:56,040 --> 03:26:59,880
unless the sequence broke.

3033
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:01,640
OK, the sequence broke because he's

3034
03:27:01,640 --> 03:27:03,520
supposed to do it at the top of those stairs.

3035
03:27:03,520 --> 03:27:04,200
My goodness.

3036
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:07,360
I thought we were about to desync there.

3037
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:08,640
Not a game.

3038
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:09,640
Not a game.

3039
03:27:09,640 --> 03:27:11,200
You gave me a heart attack.

3040
03:27:11,200 --> 03:27:15,280
We must ensure the kidnappings continue.

3041
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:18,360
No, there will be no kidnapping.

3042
03:27:18,360 --> 03:27:20,840
He, he, he.

3043
03:27:20,840 --> 03:27:24,240
Requies, got the badge.

3044
03:27:24,240 --> 03:27:27,800
Requies, got the badge.

3045
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:29,720
And look at his hook arm.

3046
03:27:29,720 --> 03:27:31,440
Yawing, using that for a design.

3047
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:37,240
I've got two sets of recruits.

3048
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:40,640
Can they hurt these guys without dying?

3049
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:45,080
I want them to get XP for fighting.

3050
03:27:45,080 --> 03:27:46,680
Can they do it without Persian?

3051
03:27:46,680 --> 03:27:47,720
I think they can.

3052
03:27:47,720 --> 03:27:49,600
But no one leveled up.

3053
03:27:49,640 --> 03:27:51,680
Not one person leveled up doing that.

3054
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:53,040
Nah, you're done.

3055
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:53,680
You're naughty.

3056
03:27:53,680 --> 03:27:54,840
Users supposed to level up.

3057
03:27:58,200 --> 03:27:59,400
Did I get into the multiplayer?

3058
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:02,920
No, I didn't actually.

3059
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:04,120
I can't quite remember.

3060
03:28:04,120 --> 03:28:05,880
I think it was like you hid among the, oh, someone

3061
03:28:05,880 --> 03:28:06,640
did level up.

3062
03:28:06,640 --> 03:28:09,400
We'll give her a weapon.

3063
03:28:09,400 --> 03:28:11,240
Look, we've got so many assassins.

3064
03:28:11,240 --> 03:28:15,320
I'm going to send them on missions.

3065
03:28:15,320 --> 03:28:18,360
Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.

3066
03:28:18,360 --> 03:28:20,600
It's just I've done it so many times.

3067
03:28:20,600 --> 03:28:23,160
You need to look for difficulty level one missions

3068
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:24,520
and then send the recruit on it.

3069
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:26,480
And it will automatically make them level two

3070
03:28:26,480 --> 03:28:32,720
so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.

3071
03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:35,520
The pigeon's eyes.

3072
03:28:35,520 --> 03:28:40,480
They're a bit, look, the game's from 2010.

3073
03:28:40,480 --> 03:28:43,720
OK, it's an older game.

3074
03:28:43,720 --> 03:28:44,960
I'm not going to steal a horse.

3075
03:28:44,960 --> 03:28:46,040
That's not nice.

3076
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:48,320
Committing Grand Horse, uh-oh.

3077
03:28:48,320 --> 03:28:50,160
But we'll do this.

3078
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:51,000
Have you played Unity?

3079
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:51,800
I haven't.

3080
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:55,320
I played Assassin's Creed, Ezio's storyline.

3081
03:28:55,320 --> 03:28:56,640
And then I played three.

3082
03:28:56,640 --> 03:28:59,120
And I didn't really enjoy it so much.

3083
03:28:59,120 --> 03:29:04,040
And then I played Black Flag.

3084
03:29:04,040 --> 03:29:09,560
But I suck at it because they changed the controls.

3085
03:29:09,560 --> 03:29:11,120
And I'm absolutely awful at it.

3086
03:29:11,120 --> 03:29:12,960
And I've never actually successfully completed it.

3087
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:15,920
I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

3088
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:18,880
I think I'm going to go on to the Tiberina Island.

3089
03:29:22,480 --> 03:29:23,640
I'll just use that bridge there.

3090
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:24,320
That looks right.

3091
03:29:27,240 --> 03:29:28,000
You enjoyed your night?

3092
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:29,600
I know Odyssey came out.

3093
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:30,600
I never played that.

3094
03:29:30,600 --> 03:29:33,160
The newer Assassin's Creed, I'm absolutely not familiar with.

3095
03:29:33,160 --> 03:29:34,560
At all, I do apologize.

3096
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:37,000
I mean, maybe we can play it for the first time together.

3097
03:29:40,280 --> 03:29:43,440
I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.

3098
03:29:43,440 --> 03:29:45,160
I know there's that Japanese.

3099
03:29:45,160 --> 03:29:46,680
Where the heck am I trying to go?

3100
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:49,000
Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.

3101
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:50,720
Talking and playing at the same time.

3102
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:52,720
I'm sorry.

3103
03:29:52,720 --> 03:29:55,120
Guess who we're about to meet?

3104
03:29:55,120 --> 03:29:56,000
Are you ready?

3105
03:29:58,880 --> 03:30:01,880
Ezio.

3106
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:03,360
Who are we about to meet?

3107
03:30:04,360 --> 03:30:05,360
Ezio.

3108
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:06,360
Come here.

3109
03:30:12,360 --> 03:30:13,360
Ta-da!

3110
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,360
Ezio.

3111
03:30:14,360 --> 03:30:15,360
Leonardo.

3112
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:17,360
Leonardo da Vinci himself.

3113
03:30:17,360 --> 03:30:18,360
Ta-da!

3114
03:30:18,360 --> 03:30:20,360
It is good to see you, friend.

3115
03:30:20,360 --> 03:30:21,360
Come here.

3116
03:30:21,360 --> 03:30:22,360
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

3117
03:30:22,360 --> 03:30:24,360
Hello, Leonardo.

3118
03:30:24,360 --> 03:30:25,360
Long time no see, buddy.

3119
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:27,360
The Gorge have commandeered my services.

3120
03:30:27,360 --> 03:30:29,360
Actually, they would have killed me,

3121
03:30:29,360 --> 03:30:31,360
had I refused.

3122
03:30:31,360 --> 03:30:33,360
So remember when Cesare said

3123
03:30:33,360 --> 03:30:35,360
the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?

3124
03:30:35,360 --> 03:30:38,360
It was crafted by Leonardo.

3125
03:30:38,360 --> 03:30:40,360
Because he's my friend.

3126
03:30:40,360 --> 03:30:43,360
Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.

3127
03:30:43,360 --> 03:30:45,360
You're also...

3128
03:30:48,360 --> 03:30:51,360
He wanted to chop that thing off.

3129
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:54,360
I don't think any of the modern Aces...

3130
03:30:54,360 --> 03:30:56,360
They don't have charm.

3131
03:30:56,360 --> 03:30:57,360
Yeah.

3132
03:30:57,360 --> 03:30:59,360
That apple.

3133
03:30:59,360 --> 03:31:01,360
Um...

3134
03:31:04,360 --> 03:31:05,360
Don't say that.

3135
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:07,360
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

3136
03:31:07,360 --> 03:31:09,360
You're making me scared now.

3137
03:31:10,360 --> 03:31:13,360
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

3138
03:31:14,360 --> 03:31:16,360
Is it hard?

3139
03:31:16,360 --> 03:31:19,360
I thought this game was pretty gamer-friendly.

3140
03:31:23,360 --> 03:31:24,360
You're making me...

3141
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:26,360
I'm starting to break out in a sweat.

3142
03:31:26,360 --> 03:31:28,360
We ain't even played the tank mission yet.

3143
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:31,360
Stop!

3144
03:31:31,360 --> 03:31:33,360
Is it bad?

3145
03:31:33,360 --> 03:31:35,360
360 hours for this stream?

3146
03:31:40,360 --> 03:31:41,360
I'm sweating.

3147
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:43,360
Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.

3148
03:31:45,360 --> 03:31:48,360
Did you know Leonardo would eventually like Twilly?

3149
03:31:48,360 --> 03:31:50,360
That's a true fact.

3150
03:31:51,360 --> 03:31:54,360
You're getting educated with me.

3151
03:31:55,360 --> 03:31:56,360
The tank mission?

3152
03:31:56,360 --> 03:31:58,360
Oh, you're making me nervous.

3153
03:32:00,360 --> 03:32:02,360
I'm getting scared.

3154
03:32:04,360 --> 03:32:08,360
Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?

3155
03:32:10,360 --> 03:32:11,360
I like to get the thing.

3156
03:32:11,360 --> 03:32:13,360
Okay, we have a long double blade.

3157
03:32:13,360 --> 03:32:15,360
We can now do double assassinations, which is one of...

3158
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:19,360
That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.

3159
03:32:19,360 --> 03:32:21,360
I already know what I'm doing.

3160
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:23,360
Fart and Donovan?

3161
03:32:24,360 --> 03:32:26,360
We're just unlocking new weaponry.

3162
03:32:26,360 --> 03:32:29,360
The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove, which is fantastic,

3163
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:35,360
to make jump-climbing much easier.

3164
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:40,360
I can't remember the tank mission.

3165
03:32:40,360 --> 03:32:42,360
I'm getting fucking nervous.

3166
03:32:42,360 --> 03:32:45,360
I'm making me scared for when we do it.

3167
03:32:45,360 --> 03:32:47,360
I was going to leave the missions all to the end,

3168
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:48,360
so we're doing story mode,

3169
03:32:48,360 --> 03:32:51,360
and then all the side quests, stuff tomorrow, and then 100% sync.

3170
03:32:54,360 --> 03:32:56,360
Right, I don't know where we're heading next.

3171
03:32:56,360 --> 03:32:57,360
Oh, okay.

3172
03:32:57,360 --> 03:32:59,360
800 meters!

3173
03:32:59,360 --> 03:33:00,360
That's so far away.

3174
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:02,360
I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.

3175
03:33:06,360 --> 03:33:10,360
We can take an aqueduct to...

3176
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:12,360
Where the heck are the aqueducts?

3177
03:33:12,360 --> 03:33:13,360
Okay, behind me.

3178
03:33:13,360 --> 03:33:16,360
We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,

3179
03:33:16,360 --> 03:33:19,360
and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.

3180
03:33:24,360 --> 03:33:27,360
I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.

3181
03:33:27,360 --> 03:33:30,360
It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.

3182
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:31,360
I'm getting nervous.

3183
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:32,360
I'm getting shaking.

3184
03:33:32,360 --> 03:33:34,360
Okay, I'm getting a bit funny.

3185
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:37,360
Where am I trying to?

3186
03:33:37,360 --> 03:33:38,360
I'm trying to teleport.

3187
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:40,360
Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,

3188
03:33:41,360 --> 03:33:45,360
and then I need to go to the mercenaries

3189
03:33:45,360 --> 03:33:48,360
on the map, and then we're going to do

3190
03:33:48,360 --> 03:33:52,360
the first of the Leonardo missions.

3191
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:53,360
Where the heck...

3192
03:33:53,360 --> 03:33:54,360
Oh, there.

3193
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:56,360
I'm literally right here.

3194
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:57,360
Here, right here.

3195
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:02,360
Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...

3196
03:34:02,360 --> 03:34:04,360
First Leonardo mission.

3197
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:06,360
I will do the others at the end,

3198
03:34:06,360 --> 03:34:08,360
because I think it takes far too long to do them,

3199
03:34:08,360 --> 03:34:11,360
in my humble opinion, although I can't remember them.

3200
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:16,360
The layer of Romulus are pretty good for climbing,

3201
03:34:16,360 --> 03:34:19,360
for those interested in clan.

3202
03:34:19,360 --> 03:34:20,360
Where's my horse?

3203
03:34:20,360 --> 03:34:21,360
I have summoned my horse.

3204
03:34:21,360 --> 03:34:22,360
Come here.

3205
03:34:22,360 --> 03:34:24,360
You're teasing me.

3206
03:34:24,360 --> 03:34:26,360
Okay, right.

3207
03:34:26,360 --> 03:34:29,360
We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.

3208
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:33,360
We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.

3209
03:34:33,360 --> 03:34:38,360
You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.

3210
03:34:38,360 --> 03:34:39,360
Act 7.

3211
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,360
So we might hit a boundary wall.

3212
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:44,360
I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.

3213
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:47,360
There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,

3214
03:34:47,360 --> 03:34:50,360
but I think I've done it right.

3215
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:52,360
Yes, the boundary wall right there.

3216
03:34:52,360 --> 03:34:56,360
So we are doing it right in quotation marks.

3217
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:58,360
Is it up or down?

3218
03:34:58,360 --> 03:35:01,360
Why are you sitting on the horse like that?

3219
03:35:01,360 --> 03:35:03,360
Explain yourself.

3220
03:35:07,360 --> 03:35:08,360
Okay, we did it.

3221
03:35:08,360 --> 03:35:09,360
We did it.

3222
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:10,360
We're here.

3223
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:12,360
I think we just have a really basic mercenary hire,

3224
03:35:12,360 --> 03:35:15,360
and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,

3225
03:35:15,360 --> 03:35:18,360
which I hate because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,

3226
03:35:18,360 --> 03:35:21,360
which makes it so much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt.

3227
03:35:21,360 --> 03:35:22,360
But it's fine.

3228
03:35:22,360 --> 03:35:26,360
Right, the mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.

3229
03:35:26,360 --> 03:35:27,360
Three, two, one.

3230
03:35:27,360 --> 03:35:29,360
Hey, that's right.

3231
03:35:29,360 --> 03:35:31,360
Come with me.

3232
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:32,360
Come with me.

3233
03:35:32,360 --> 03:35:34,360
You're going to beat these people up for me.

3234
03:35:34,360 --> 03:35:37,360
Thank you.

3235
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:39,360
And you just tell them to fight like that.

3236
03:35:39,360 --> 03:35:41,360
And that's how you utilize the mercenary recruit.

3237
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:43,360
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

3238
03:35:43,360 --> 03:35:47,360
I have a rogue eyelash again.

3239
03:35:47,360 --> 03:35:50,360
Okay, and then basically you just do all the work.

3240
03:35:50,360 --> 03:35:52,360
I can call my assassins and...

3241
03:35:52,360 --> 03:35:54,360
You know what? I'll do it for the XP.

3242
03:35:54,360 --> 03:35:57,360
Oh, I just unlocked an assassin.

3243
03:35:57,360 --> 03:35:58,360
I'll take it.

3244
03:35:58,360 --> 03:36:00,360
No, I can't do that.

3245
03:36:00,360 --> 03:36:02,360
Uh...

3246
03:36:02,360 --> 03:36:05,360
Oh, okay, done.

3247
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:08,360
Yippee!

3248
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:13,360
Okay, we now are going on a mission in a different location.

3249
03:36:13,360 --> 03:36:15,360
Map Retrieve from the Overseer.

3250
03:36:15,360 --> 03:36:20,360
I cannot read that fast, but thank you, Game, for having faith in me that I can read that fast.

3251
03:36:20,360 --> 03:36:24,360
But the truth of the matter is, I can't.

3252
03:36:24,360 --> 03:36:25,360
Don't do that.

3253
03:36:25,360 --> 03:36:27,360
Don't let that happen again.

3254
03:36:27,360 --> 03:36:29,360
Have a little drink of water again.

3255
03:36:29,360 --> 03:36:31,360
My voice is dying.

3256
03:36:31,360 --> 03:36:33,360
I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is,

3257
03:36:33,360 --> 03:36:37,360
or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.

3258
03:36:37,360 --> 03:36:39,360
All right.

3259
03:36:39,360 --> 03:36:42,360
I'll get with the machine gun.

3260
03:36:42,360 --> 03:36:46,360
So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.

3261
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:48,360
I have never done that before.

3262
03:36:48,360 --> 03:36:51,360
I always kill people.

3263
03:36:51,360 --> 03:36:53,360
And it's like really...

3264
03:36:53,360 --> 03:36:56,360
It's so much easier if you have the crossbow ball,

3265
03:36:56,360 --> 03:36:58,360
because, like...

3266
03:36:58,360 --> 03:37:04,360
For goodness sake, it...

3267
03:37:04,360 --> 03:37:08,360
Because the crossbow ball doesn't give your location away,

3268
03:37:08,360 --> 03:37:12,360
but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.

3269
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:14,360
I'm actually not wanting to move yet.

3270
03:37:14,360 --> 03:37:17,360
That's why, because they turn around.

3271
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:21,360
I'm gonna yank him.

3272
03:37:21,360 --> 03:37:24,360
I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy,

3273
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:28,360
if I'm being honest.

3274
03:37:28,360 --> 03:37:34,360
Maybe don't have to, question mark.

3275
03:37:34,360 --> 03:37:37,360
There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't need.

3276
03:37:37,360 --> 03:37:38,360
Oh, he's coming!

3277
03:37:38,360 --> 03:37:39,360
Are you joking me?

3278
03:37:39,360 --> 03:37:41,360
I've just missed him.

3279
03:37:41,360 --> 03:37:42,360
Just missed him.

3280
03:37:42,360 --> 03:37:50,360
We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.

3281
03:37:50,360 --> 03:37:53,360
There's two bullets.

3282
03:37:53,360 --> 03:37:59,360
Whenever there's a pigeon light, that means you can do a leap of faith.

3283
03:37:59,360 --> 03:38:01,360
Your enthusiasm, the game's cute.

3284
03:38:01,360 --> 03:38:05,360
It's just such a good game.

3285
03:38:05,360 --> 03:38:07,360
So, as long as he doesn't turn around.

3286
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:10,360
If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.

3287
03:38:10,360 --> 03:38:13,360
So don't run when you do these kind of things.

3288
03:38:13,360 --> 03:38:15,360
Or else the guards just...

3289
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:18,360
The AIs basically gonna be like, I have found you.

3290
03:38:18,360 --> 03:38:20,360
And then you're like, please don't do that.

3291
03:38:20,360 --> 03:38:22,360
I would like to be uncaught,

3292
03:38:22,360 --> 03:38:25,360
because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.

3293
03:38:25,360 --> 03:38:27,360
Right, so...

3294
03:38:27,360 --> 03:38:29,360
What is he running for?

3295
03:38:29,360 --> 03:38:33,360
Okay, this is a bit of an issue.

3296
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:36,360
There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,

3297
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:37,360
and that one up there.

3298
03:38:37,360 --> 03:38:39,360
I need to shoot both of them, basically.

3299
03:38:39,360 --> 03:38:41,360
But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.

3300
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:43,360
Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?

3301
03:38:43,360 --> 03:38:45,360
For real!

3302
03:38:45,360 --> 03:38:47,360
But they can't see me from this distance.

3303
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:49,360
I'm potent, but I'm not that potent.

3304
03:38:49,360 --> 03:38:51,360
Right, so we can do that, at least.

3305
03:38:51,360 --> 03:38:53,360
And then...

3306
03:38:53,360 --> 03:38:54,360
Maybe...

3307
03:38:54,360 --> 03:38:56,360
Wait, there's a guy there.

3308
03:38:56,360 --> 03:38:58,360
Oh, I don't like that.

3309
03:39:06,360 --> 03:39:07,360
Sorry.

3310
03:39:07,360 --> 03:39:09,360
This part, you can fuck up so easily.

3311
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:11,360
Okay.

3312
03:39:11,360 --> 03:39:13,360
Okay, we didn't fuck it up.

3313
03:39:13,360 --> 03:39:15,360
Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.

3314
03:39:15,360 --> 03:39:17,360
Okay.

3315
03:39:17,360 --> 03:39:18,360
Ta-da!

3316
03:39:18,360 --> 03:39:20,360
We have achieved the checkpoint.

3317
03:39:20,360 --> 03:39:22,360
We no longer have to sneak around.

3318
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:24,360
We can just do our thing.

3319
03:39:24,360 --> 03:39:25,360
Phew!

3320
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:27,360
I don't ever want to do that again.

3321
03:39:27,360 --> 03:39:30,360
She says as she has to do it again.

3322
03:39:30,360 --> 03:39:32,360
You can just drop down.

3323
03:39:32,360 --> 03:39:34,360
It doesn't cause any damage to you.

3324
03:39:34,360 --> 03:39:39,360
But the music creators for the speed-up song,

3325
03:39:39,360 --> 03:39:43,360
like, that is so terrifying.

3326
03:39:43,360 --> 03:39:45,360
It strikes blood into the hearts.

3327
03:39:45,360 --> 03:39:48,360
It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.

3328
03:39:48,360 --> 03:39:50,360
I mean, that's what hearts do.

3329
03:39:50,360 --> 03:39:53,360
They pump blood around and stuff.

3330
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:56,360
Get all oxygenated again.

3331
03:39:56,360 --> 03:39:59,360
Okay, this is the part I freaking hate,

3332
03:39:59,360 --> 03:40:02,360
because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.

3333
03:40:02,360 --> 03:40:05,360
You can literally go side-to-side and evade,

3334
03:40:05,360 --> 03:40:06,360
and you will still get...

3335
03:40:06,360 --> 03:40:08,360
Why are there people there?

3336
03:40:08,360 --> 03:40:12,360
Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably gonna get hit on, like...

3337
03:40:12,360 --> 03:40:15,360
I don't know how to not get hit.

3338
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:19,360
I've played this so many times.

3339
03:40:19,360 --> 03:40:21,360
Although I did evade all of those,

3340
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:25,360
so maybe my swirling is doing much better.

3341
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:27,360
Evasive maneuvers!

3342
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:29,360
Evasive maneuvers!

3343
03:40:29,360 --> 03:40:31,360
Ah! See? I don't get it.

3344
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:32,360
I'm literally going side-to-side.

3345
03:40:32,360 --> 03:40:35,360
I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.

3346
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:37,360
Like, if I get too close, the game's like,

3347
03:40:37,360 --> 03:40:39,360
you're not allowed to get that close,

3348
03:40:39,360 --> 03:40:42,360
and, well, sorry, you didn't really explain.

3349
03:40:42,360 --> 03:40:45,360
Like, pardon my French,

3350
03:40:45,360 --> 03:40:50,360
but je ne sais quoi, on what's going on, mate.

3351
03:40:50,360 --> 03:40:53,360
Okay, there we go. Next sequence.

3352
03:40:53,360 --> 03:40:56,360
This is actually pretty badass.

3353
03:40:56,360 --> 03:41:00,360
I can't seem to have to admit.

3354
03:41:00,360 --> 03:41:02,360
Blech!

3355
03:41:05,360 --> 03:41:08,360
Stabbed and throw SFX. Blech!

3356
03:41:10,360 --> 03:41:12,360
We will use the tactical camera,

3357
03:41:12,360 --> 03:41:15,360
because it's literally, like, if you're down in here,

3358
03:41:15,360 --> 03:41:17,360
it's, like, so close.

3359
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:20,360
And you can use the map to see who's coming up,

3360
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:22,360
so I can see there's one on the right,

3361
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:24,360
and then we're gonna swing back left,

3362
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:26,360
and then we're gonna swing back right.

3363
03:41:26,360 --> 03:41:29,360
You don't need to worry about the archers at all

3364
03:41:29,360 --> 03:41:32,360
in this part of the mission.

3365
03:41:32,360 --> 03:41:35,360
They don't hurt you. I've never been hurt in...

3366
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:38,360
But you can see left side again on the red dot map,

3367
03:41:38,360 --> 03:41:40,360
which I'm covering up! Lovely!

3368
03:41:40,360 --> 03:41:44,360
I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,

3369
03:41:44,360 --> 03:41:48,360
so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.

3370
03:41:48,360 --> 03:41:50,360
I do apologise.

3371
03:41:52,360 --> 03:41:54,360
Again, the horses always get up.

3372
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:57,360
Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.

3373
03:41:57,360 --> 03:42:01,360
You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.

3374
03:42:01,360 --> 03:42:03,360
You can get to it.

3375
03:42:03,360 --> 03:42:06,360
And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up.

3376
03:42:06,360 --> 03:42:08,360
God, that's really loud.

3377
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:11,360
Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.

3378
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:14,360
Um, yeah.

3379
03:42:14,360 --> 03:42:16,360
The horses are fine. Please don't worry.

3380
03:42:16,360 --> 03:42:19,360
All horses get back up in the game.

3381
03:42:22,360 --> 03:42:25,360
Ooh, if they aim a bit too close, they're gonna get me.

3382
03:42:28,360 --> 03:42:31,360
Ooh, am I gonna get away with that?

3383
03:42:31,360 --> 03:42:34,360
Shoot them down!

3384
03:42:35,360 --> 03:42:36,360
That wasn't bad either.

3385
03:42:36,360 --> 03:42:39,360
Wait, he got back up on the horse.

3386
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:41,360
You better stop!

3387
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:43,360
Stop!

3388
03:42:43,360 --> 03:42:46,360
Boom, boom, boom!

3389
03:42:46,360 --> 03:42:49,360
This is, like, sniper-similar, honestly.

3390
03:42:49,360 --> 03:42:50,360
Oops!

3391
03:42:50,360 --> 03:42:53,360
Oh, no, I'm gonna get shot. I messed up.

3392
03:42:53,360 --> 03:42:55,360
Ah, wait!

3393
03:42:55,360 --> 03:42:57,360
Hello? Rote? Esio?

3394
03:43:01,360 --> 03:43:03,360
Ugh.

3395
03:43:05,360 --> 03:43:07,360
Esio actually wanted to perish there.

3396
03:43:07,360 --> 03:43:09,360
He said, I like feeling pain.

3397
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:13,360
Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.

3398
03:43:13,360 --> 03:43:15,360
I don't have the best aim on analogue.

3399
03:43:15,360 --> 03:43:18,360
So, I'll try it.

3400
03:43:18,360 --> 03:43:21,360
But, yeah, this is the first mission.

3401
03:43:21,360 --> 03:43:23,360
It's the easiest out of them all.

3402
03:43:23,360 --> 03:43:25,360
This is still tutorial section stuff,

3403
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:28,360
because the Leonardo missions are main game.

3404
03:43:28,360 --> 03:43:31,360
So, this is technical tutorial.

3405
03:43:31,360 --> 03:43:34,360
We still go in there.

3406
03:43:37,360 --> 03:43:39,360
I'm trying to remember the axe.

3407
03:43:39,360 --> 03:43:40,360
Maybe axe.

3408
03:43:40,360 --> 03:43:43,360
This is the order.

3409
03:43:48,360 --> 03:43:49,360
Oh, can I hit the barrel?

3410
03:43:49,360 --> 03:43:52,360
Yeah, I can hit the barrel.

3411
03:43:52,360 --> 03:43:54,360
How many are there?

3412
03:43:54,360 --> 03:43:56,360
Okay, we've almost done the sequence,

3413
03:43:56,360 --> 03:43:59,360
and then we're back into the main game.

3414
03:44:00,360 --> 03:44:03,360
I might get another cola, actually.

3415
03:44:06,360 --> 03:44:08,360
My voice is feeling it.

3416
03:44:10,360 --> 03:44:15,360
I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.

3417
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:17,360
I'm not really sure.

3418
03:44:17,360 --> 03:44:19,360
Other than, like, be quiet five heads,

3419
03:44:19,360 --> 03:44:22,360
but, like, I want to stream.

3420
03:44:22,360 --> 03:44:24,360
I want to have a good time.

3421
03:44:24,360 --> 03:44:26,360
I have so much lost time to make up for it.

3422
03:44:26,360 --> 03:44:28,360
Like, you have no idea.

3423
03:44:28,360 --> 03:44:30,360
I saw you spawning.

3424
03:44:30,360 --> 03:44:32,360
I saw that.

3425
03:44:33,360 --> 03:44:35,360
I saw you spawning.

3426
03:44:37,360 --> 03:44:39,360
Hydration and practice.

3427
03:44:39,360 --> 03:44:42,360
I've been using my voice for years now.

3428
03:44:43,360 --> 03:44:45,360
Just speak smaller words.

3429
03:44:45,360 --> 03:44:47,360
Okay.

3430
03:44:47,360 --> 03:44:49,360
I work as a co-center agent.

3431
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:51,360
Water helps.

3432
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:54,360
Bang.

3433
03:44:55,360 --> 03:44:57,360
Oh, actually.

3434
03:44:57,360 --> 03:44:59,360
Hopefully none of the girls are in here.

3435
03:44:59,360 --> 03:45:01,360
I want to do a short with them,

3436
03:45:01,360 --> 03:45:05,360
so apparently girls can't make, like, good weapon sounds.

3437
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:07,360
Like, I'll make the sound of a gun,

3438
03:45:07,360 --> 03:45:09,360
so I'm going to ask all the girls to record

3439
03:45:09,360 --> 03:45:11,360
an audio of them making the sound of a gun,

3440
03:45:11,360 --> 03:45:13,360
and then we're going to put it in a short.

3441
03:45:13,360 --> 03:45:15,360
It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.

3442
03:45:15,360 --> 03:45:17,360
It's nothing serious.

3443
03:45:17,360 --> 03:45:20,360
800 yards from the location

3444
03:45:20,360 --> 03:45:22,360
of where I'm supposed to go, are you kidding me?

3445
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:26,360
So I was going to do a shotgun

3446
03:45:26,360 --> 03:45:28,360
and see if they come up with, like, pistols,

3447
03:45:28,360 --> 03:45:30,360
or maybe an AK.

3448
03:45:30,360 --> 03:45:32,360
Right, we've got quite a few levels up.

3449
03:45:32,360 --> 03:45:34,360
We've got a level three, which is fantastic.

3450
03:45:34,360 --> 03:45:37,360
We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.

3451
03:45:37,360 --> 03:45:40,360
They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.

3452
03:45:40,360 --> 03:45:44,360
I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.

3453
03:45:46,360 --> 03:45:49,360
I'm going to take the level three to go level up

3454
03:45:50,360 --> 03:45:52,360
Can I send them on level twos?

3455
03:45:55,360 --> 03:45:57,360
But the level two missions are quite long.

3456
03:46:01,360 --> 03:46:03,360
Wonder who's going to be the best?

3457
03:46:03,360 --> 03:46:10,360
I'm going with the classic shotgun, like the

3458
03:46:10,360 --> 03:46:25,240
this time over. Wow. Okay. I guess I will go back to the the mercenaries to use the aqueduct

3459
03:46:25,240 --> 03:46:32,440
there other than aqueduct there as well. Is that closer? I think so. You can rule your

3460
03:46:32,440 --> 03:46:40,120
roll your Rs if you're Scottish. I know some languages like at all don't use don't roll

3461
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:47,220
their Rs like I was gonna say something and my brain completely blanked I'm

3462
03:46:47,220 --> 03:46:54,280
now gonna pretend otherwise he he oh I'm out of bounds hard and what can I

3463
03:46:54,280 --> 03:46:59,880

3538
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:22,680
Frenchy true French fry French fries are European Frenchies the Swiss or the

3539
03:56:23,440 --> 03:56:30,160
and the cubaic was the cubaic cubaic

3540
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:42,520
honestly her cubaic wa is unlike something I've heard before and she says

3541
03:56:42,520 --> 03:56:45,800
she's not very confident in it but I'm like as long as you can form sentences

3542
03:56:45,800 --> 03:56:59,480
like the best I can say is like I can say I would like to say I can say I

3543
03:56:59,480 --> 03:57:12,040
which is I can say I don't think I know any more doing words in French any more

3544
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:23,400
verbs all the French fries are like oh okay here we go I'm back what did I miss

3545
03:57:23,400 --> 03:57:28,720

03:57:46,480 --> 03:58:01,480
French, uh, ver, juli, noir, blanc, blanc, uh, marron.

3549
03:58:01,480 --> 03:58:04,480
What a French.

3550
03:58:04,480 --> 03:58:06,480
Yes, yes.

3551
03:58:06,480 --> 03:58:08,480
Not the French ones, yes, yes.

3552
03:58:08,480 --> 03:58:11,480
With fish in the bags.

3553
03:58:11,480 --> 03:58:14,480
Yeah, what did you just make me say?

3554
03:58:14,480 --> 03:58:16,480
I can like kind of half read French.

3555
03:58:16,480 --> 03:58:18,480
I have no idea what I'm saying, but I can kind of read it.

3556
03:58:18,480 --> 03:58:20,480
Like with the letters and stuff.

3557
03:58:23,480 --> 03:58:26,480
The French aren't real, it's a line made up by the English.

3558
03:58:27,480 --> 03:58:30,480
Je suis monté, pardon.

3559
03:58:32,480 --> 03:58:35,480
I think chichons means boobah, chichons.

3560
03:58:37,480 --> 03:58:39,480
Uh, yes.

3561
03:58:39,480 --> 03:58:42,480
We will protect you.

3562
03:58:42,480 --> 03:58:44,480
Hello gentlemen.

3563
03:58:44,480 --> 03:58:46,480
May I please double assassinate you?

3564
03:58:46,480 --> 03:58:48,480
No, double assassinate.

3565
03:58:48,480 --> 03:58:50,480
Oh, don't be detected.

3566
03:58:50,480 --> 03:58:52,480
Don't be detected with the mission.

3567
03:58:52,480 --> 03:58:56,480
And the first thing I do is go up and kill some guys.

3568
03:58:56,480 --> 03:58:58,480
I'm not very smart, am I?

3569
03:58:58,480 --> 03:59:00,480
Oh well.

3570
03:59:00,480 --> 03:59:02,480
Eep.

3571
03:59:02,480 --> 03:59:05,480
A little over say, but hey.

3572
03:59:05,480 --> 03:59:07,480
It's fine.

3573
03:59:07,480 --> 03:59:09,480
Morning.

3574
03:59:10,480 --> 03:59:13,480
Good morning.

3575
03:59:13,480 --> 03:59:16,480
Good evening.

3576
03:59:16,480 --> 03:59:21,480
I really don't want to send my assassins on, like, the Lancers,

3577
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:25,480
but as long as they kill the right guy first, this should be fine.

3578
03:59:27,480 --> 03:59:31,480
Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining about his money issues

3579
03:59:31,480 --> 03:59:33,480
and how he hates the Borgia.

3580
03:59:33,480 --> 03:59:35,480
I'm talking right over at him.

3581
03:59:36,480 --> 03:59:38,480
Oops.

3582
03:59:38,480 --> 03:59:42,480
Well, thank goodness they came in then.

3583
03:59:49,480 --> 03:59:51,480
Uh, hello.

3584
03:59:51,480 --> 03:59:52,480
Whoa.

3585
03:59:52,480 --> 03:59:55,480
Yeah, see this, the citizens become assassins.

3586
03:59:55,480 --> 03:59:56,480
They get scared.

3587
03:59:56,480 --> 03:59:58,480
Why do you not do double blade?

3588
03:59:58,480 --> 03:59:59,480
I have a double blade.

3589
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:03,480
I'm pretty sure there's, like, busted to double blade stuff as well.

3590
04:00:03,480 --> 04:00:05,480
I really appreciate it.

3591
04:00:05,480 --> 04:00:09,480
A few different skills to do.

3592
04:00:09,480 --> 04:00:13,480
We should probably get rid of some of our noray.

3593
04:00:13,480 --> 04:00:15,480
This is where we start now.

3594
04:00:15,480 --> 04:00:16,480
We're doing 100% tomorrow.

3595
04:00:16,480 --> 04:00:20,480
We're just doing campaign mode right now.

3596
04:00:20,480 --> 04:00:23,480
Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.

3597
04:00:23,480 --> 04:00:27,480
Good time zone, everyone.

3598
04:00:27,480 --> 04:00:29,480
That's awful.

3599
04:00:34,480 --> 04:00:38,480
Uh, we may be able to get ignored.

3600
04:00:38,480 --> 04:00:39,480
Yes.

3601
04:00:39,480 --> 04:00:41,480
No.

3602
04:00:41,480 --> 04:00:44,480
I was gonna sneak by them.

3603
04:00:44,480 --> 04:00:48,480
I like how he's continuing to talk whilst being beaten up by a sword.

3604
04:00:50,480 --> 04:00:53,480
Are they not attacking him?

3605
04:00:53,480 --> 04:00:57,480
Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?

3606
04:00:57,480 --> 04:00:58,480
Can you attack him?

3607
04:00:58,480 --> 04:00:59,480
What's going on?

3608
04:00:59,480 --> 04:01:00,480
Oh my god.

3609
04:01:00,480 --> 04:01:03,480
Oh, they've attracted more guards.

3610
04:01:06,480 --> 04:01:07,480
What?

3611
04:01:07,480 --> 04:01:09,480
And now someone's grabbing the guard?

3612
04:01:09,480 --> 04:01:10,480
Hello?

3613
04:01:10,480 --> 04:01:11,480
Right, no.

3614
04:01:11,480 --> 04:01:12,480
This isn't my problem.

3615
04:01:12,480 --> 04:01:13,480
Sorry.

3616
04:01:15,480 --> 04:01:18,480
I don't know what is going on over there, but...

3617
04:01:20,480 --> 04:01:23,480
I don't think they will attack us.

3618
04:01:23,480 --> 04:01:25,480
They're so far away.

3619
04:01:25,480 --> 04:01:28,480
Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.

3620
04:01:28,480 --> 04:01:32,480
I think the AI was like, no idea who to target first,

3621
04:01:32,480 --> 04:01:34,480
so it was just going for like everyone.

3622
04:01:37,480 --> 04:01:40,480
As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.

3623
04:01:40,480 --> 04:01:42,480
I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.

3624
04:01:48,480 --> 04:01:50,480
That's the best I got for Spanish.

3625
04:01:50,480 --> 04:01:52,480
Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.

3626
04:01:53,480 --> 04:01:54,480
Hmm...

3627
04:01:55,480 --> 04:01:57,480
I'm trying to think of a better name.

3628
04:01:59,480 --> 04:02:00,480
Puta Matvee!

3629
04:02:00,480 --> 04:02:01,480
Oh wait, no, I did it wrong.

3630
04:02:01,480 --> 04:02:03,480
Puta Matvee!

3631
04:02:05,480 --> 04:02:07,480
That's my Espanol.

3632
04:02:09,480 --> 04:02:10,480
We're going...

3633
04:02:11,480 --> 04:02:13,480
Guards, guards, guards.

3634
04:02:17,480 --> 04:02:18,480
No, a horse.

3635
04:02:18,480 --> 04:02:19,480
Anything but a horse.

3636
04:02:20,480 --> 04:02:22,480
I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.

3637
04:02:22,480 --> 04:02:24,480
I don't want any horse problems.

3638
04:02:26,480 --> 04:02:27,480
Oh, the senator's under attack?

3639
04:02:27,480 --> 04:02:29,480
No, they should be attacking me.

3640
04:02:30,480 --> 04:02:31,480
How much health has he got?

3641
04:02:31,480 --> 04:02:34,480
Oh no, he's still like not even lost a square health.

3642
04:02:34,480 --> 04:02:36,480
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

3643
04:02:36,480 --> 04:02:38,480
Assassins help now.

3644
04:02:39,480 --> 04:02:40,480
Okay, we're good.

3645
04:02:40,480 --> 04:02:41,480
We're good, we're good.

3646
04:02:41,480 --> 04:02:42,480
And someone got promoted.

3647
04:02:44,480 --> 04:02:46,480
Smells like promotion, boys.

3648
04:02:47,480 --> 04:02:48,480
Can I...?

3649
04:02:48,480 --> 04:02:50,480
I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...

3650
04:02:51,480 --> 04:02:53,480
We're just gonna go for it, we're just gonna send it.

3651
04:02:54,480 --> 04:02:57,480
My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...

3652
04:02:58,480 --> 04:02:59,480
I'm dumb, so...

3653
04:03:04,480 --> 04:03:05,480
Time to get some sleep.

3654
04:03:05,480 --> 04:03:06,480
Please rest well.

3655
04:03:07,480 --> 04:03:08,480
Sleep well.

3656
04:03:08,480 --> 04:03:09,480
Sweet dreams.

3657
04:03:11,480 --> 04:03:12,480
Do you know other Italian words?

3658
04:03:13,480 --> 04:03:14,480
No.

3659
04:03:14,480 --> 04:03:17,480
Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.

3660
04:03:18,480 --> 04:03:20,480
Katso, to swear.

3661
04:03:21,480 --> 04:03:23,480
It's Emmy at piano.

3662
04:03:26,480 --> 04:03:28,480
Aw, is that me doing piano?

3663
04:03:29,480 --> 04:03:31,480
She tickling them ivories.

3664
04:03:31,480 --> 04:03:33,480
Thank goodness I have ivory skin,

3665
04:03:33,480 --> 04:03:35,480
because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.

3666
04:03:37,480 --> 04:03:39,480
They're attacking me anyway.

3667
04:03:39,480 --> 04:03:41,480
Then his friends take me to him.

3668
04:03:42,480 --> 04:03:43,480
I will bring you all the money you want.

3669
04:03:43,480 --> 04:03:44,480
I've not played this game.

3670
04:03:44,480 --> 04:03:46,480
I've played the game in Dutch once.

3671
04:03:47,480 --> 04:03:49,480
Just so to say, follow me in Dutch.

3672
04:03:49,480 --> 04:03:50,480
You say, volg me.

3673
04:03:53,480 --> 04:03:55,480
But yeah, not really.

3674
04:03:55,480 --> 04:03:57,480
It was just subtitles and stuff.

3675
04:03:59,480 --> 04:04:01,480
I knew it.

3676
04:04:07,480 --> 04:04:08,480
Why in Dutch?

3677
04:04:08,480 --> 04:04:10,480
I wanted to learn Dutch at one point,

3678
04:04:10,480 --> 04:04:11,480
but I gave up.

3679
04:04:13,480 --> 04:04:15,480
I only know Scots in English.

3680
04:04:18,480 --> 04:04:19,480
Family.

3681
04:04:21,480 --> 04:04:22,480
I will follow you to the banker.

3682
04:04:23,480 --> 04:04:25,480
Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages

3683
04:04:25,480 --> 04:04:27,480
to learn if you're English speaking.

3684
04:04:28,480 --> 04:04:30,480
It only takes apparently 40 hours

3685
04:04:30,480 --> 04:04:34,480
to get the basics in all that jazz.

3686
04:04:35,480 --> 04:04:38,480
20 Florence.

3687
04:04:38,480 --> 04:04:39,480
That was it.

3688
04:04:39,480 --> 04:04:40,480
In that chest.

3689
04:04:42,480 --> 04:04:44,480
It is a very goofy language,

3690
04:04:44,480 --> 04:04:47,480
but it's so easy to speak and learn.

3691
04:04:48,480 --> 04:04:50,480
If you're ever bored and you're like,

3692
04:04:50,480 --> 04:04:51,480
I want to do something,

3693
04:04:52,480 --> 04:04:53,480
just learn some Dutch.

3694
04:04:53,480 --> 04:04:54,480
Learn the animals.

3695
04:04:54,480 --> 04:04:56,480
The animals are quite funny,

3696
04:04:56,480 --> 04:04:59,480
because you can see how literal it is with animals.

3697
04:05:00,480 --> 04:05:02,480
The title is Shield Poddin,

3698
04:05:02,480 --> 04:05:04,480
which literally shielded,

3699
04:05:04,480 --> 04:05:06,480
and then padded.

3700
04:05:06,480 --> 04:05:08,480
Shield Poddin.

3701
04:05:12,480 --> 04:05:15,480
Got to learn German since my sister moved there.

3702
04:05:15,480 --> 04:05:17,480
Hallo, Leute, ha, was, geht?

3703
04:05:17,480 --> 04:05:19,480
To be good, ja.

3704
04:05:19,480 --> 04:05:20,480
Is das Gras road?

3705
04:05:20,480 --> 04:05:22,480
Nein, das Gras is groin.

3706
04:05:23,480 --> 04:05:25,480
There's some German for you.

3707
04:05:26,480 --> 04:05:28,480
Right, if we don't touch the floor,

3708
04:05:28,480 --> 04:05:29,480
we get 100%,

3709
04:05:29,480 --> 04:05:31,480
but it's a bit finicky, honestly.

3710
04:05:31,480 --> 04:05:34,480
So it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.

3711
04:05:36,480 --> 04:05:38,480
Ja, das Gras groin.

3712
04:05:38,480 --> 04:05:39,480
Ja.

3713
04:05:40,480 --> 04:05:42,480
Dein en maht ha.

3714
04:05:42,480 --> 04:05:45,480
Is a lovely lady, ja.

3715
04:05:48,480 --> 04:05:50,480
Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.

3716
04:05:50,480 --> 04:05:52,480
I'm not even explaining the game anymore.

3717
04:05:52,480 --> 04:05:54,480
I'm just having a good time.

3718
04:05:57,480 --> 04:06:00,480
Most English people have difficulty with the ch.

3719
04:06:00,480 --> 04:06:02,480
I assume that's what you wanted me to say.

3720
04:06:02,480 --> 04:06:06,480
Ja, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,

3721
04:06:06,480 --> 04:06:08,480
you say a loch.

3722
04:06:08,480 --> 04:06:09,480
Loch.

3723
04:06:09,480 --> 04:06:11,480
So, kinda, ja.

3724
04:06:11,480 --> 04:06:13,480
And then we also roll our r's,

3725
04:06:13,480 --> 04:06:15,480
like it's not girl,

3726
04:06:15,480 --> 04:06:16,480
it's girl,

3727
04:06:16,480 --> 04:06:17,480
girl,

3728
04:06:17,480 --> 04:06:20,480
so Scots kinda naturally have a buff

3729
04:06:20,480 --> 04:06:22,480
for other languages,

3730
04:06:22,480 --> 04:06:24,480
which is pretty handy

3731
04:06:24,480 --> 04:06:26,480
when you're trying to impress someone.

3732
04:06:27,480 --> 04:06:32,480
I think to say all day every day in...

3733
04:06:34,480 --> 04:06:35,480
All day, took one Taiwan,

3734
04:06:35,480 --> 04:06:37,480
all day every day in Vietnamese.

3735
04:06:37,480 --> 04:06:39,480
Nah, I don't think that's right.

3736
04:06:39,480 --> 04:06:40,480
Please perish.

3737
04:06:40,480 --> 04:06:42,480
Give me a clap, Papa.

3738
04:06:42,480 --> 04:06:43,480
What?

3739
04:06:44,480 --> 04:06:46,480
I'm gonna like clap them cheese.

3740
04:06:46,480 --> 04:06:47,480
Sorry.

3741
04:06:50,480 --> 04:06:52,480
Ja, this is just a classic tailing mission.

3742
04:06:52,480 --> 04:06:55,480
You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.

3743
04:06:56,480 --> 04:06:57,480
We are tailing the banker.

3744
04:06:57,480 --> 04:06:59,480
He currently has our juicy, juicy money,

3745
04:06:59,480 --> 04:07:02,480
which we do get back at the end of this mission.

3746
04:07:02,480 --> 04:07:06,480
I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,

3747
04:07:06,480 --> 04:07:09,480
and I was about to inhale a big inhale.

3748
04:07:11,480 --> 04:07:14,480
Khef me in clap, Papa.

3749
04:07:14,480 --> 04:07:15,480
Me spank me daddy.

3750
04:07:15,480 --> 04:07:16,480
Oh!

3751
04:07:17,480 --> 04:07:19,480
Khef me in clap, Papa.

3752
04:07:19,480 --> 04:07:20,480
There you go.

3753
04:07:21,480 --> 04:07:24,480
To the one Dutch person listening in right now,

3754
04:07:24,480 --> 04:07:26,480
he's having the time of his life.

3755
04:07:26,480 --> 04:07:29,480
He is absolutely on it.

3756
04:07:29,480 --> 04:07:31,480
He's like, I'll see your belief.

3757
04:07:31,480 --> 04:07:33,480
Oh, no, that's please.

3758
04:07:33,480 --> 04:07:34,480
How do you say thank you?

3759
04:07:34,480 --> 04:07:35,480
How do you say thank you?

3760
04:07:35,480 --> 04:07:36,480
Thank you, Bill.

3761
04:07:36,480 --> 04:07:37,480
He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.

3762
04:07:37,480 --> 04:07:38,480
Strawberry.

3763
04:07:38,480 --> 04:07:39,480
Thank you, Bill.

3764
04:07:39,480 --> 04:07:40,480
And his reactant.

3765
04:07:42,480 --> 04:07:43,480
It's me.

3766
04:07:46,480 --> 04:07:48,480
Like, I know like the other stuff,

3767
04:07:48,480 --> 04:07:50,480
like Iquil is like I won,

3768
04:07:50,480 --> 04:07:51,480
like Iquiline.

3769
04:07:54,480 --> 04:07:57,480
If you are a human, you say Iquiline.

3770
04:07:58,480 --> 04:08:02,480
If you are ainvral, Iquil...

3771
04:08:05,480 --> 04:08:07,480
Is he gonna get me in trouble?

3772
04:08:07,480 --> 04:08:08,480
I don't...

3773
04:08:08,480 --> 04:08:12,480
I think I can like kill this guy from the box.

3774
04:08:12,480 --> 04:08:14,480
What's inside the box?

3775
04:08:14,480 --> 04:08:15,480
Nothing.

3776
04:08:15,480 --> 04:08:16,480
I'm stuck.

3777
04:08:16,480 --> 04:08:17,480
Please get out.

3778
04:08:17,480 --> 04:08:20,480
Okay, that was funny and unique.

3779
04:08:20,480 --> 04:08:22,480
Please don't do that again.

3780
04:08:22,480 --> 04:08:24,480
I always forget how to navigate this part.

3781
04:08:26,480 --> 04:08:27,480
Are you a fish?

3782
04:08:27,480 --> 04:08:29,480
I'm a cuttlefish.

3783
04:08:29,480 --> 04:08:31,480
I'm a little piece of paper.

3784
04:08:31,480 --> 04:08:33,480
Because I do hypnosis.

3785
04:08:34,480 --> 04:08:37,480
But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.

3786
04:08:37,480 --> 04:08:39,480
Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out,

3787
04:08:39,480 --> 04:08:42,480
but like an actual free to view one,

3788
04:08:42,480 --> 04:08:43,480
like ASMR stuff.

3789
04:08:43,480 --> 04:08:45,480
Oh, can I need to get on that?

3790
04:08:45,480 --> 04:08:47,480
We got called again,

3791
04:08:47,480 --> 04:08:49,480
but it sounds terrible.

3792
04:08:49,480 --> 04:08:51,480
I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much

3793
04:08:51,480 --> 04:08:52,480
more stuff I need to edit.

3794
04:08:52,480 --> 04:08:56,480
And basically I need to wake up

3795
04:08:56,480 --> 04:08:58,480
and then work before stream,

3796
04:08:58,480 --> 04:09:01,480
because after stream I can't do anything.

3797
04:09:02,480 --> 04:09:03,480
I don't want to kill the...

3798
04:09:06,480 --> 04:09:08,480
Someone's up there.

3799
04:09:13,480 --> 04:09:14,480
I really don't want to kill

3800
04:09:14,480 --> 04:09:16,480
because if you put the bodies on the floor,

3801
04:09:16,480 --> 04:09:20,480
sometimes the bodies desync this...

3802
04:09:21,480 --> 04:09:22,480
Please stop.

3803
04:09:23,480 --> 04:09:25,480
Are you kidding me?

3804
04:09:25,480 --> 04:09:27,480
This thing was don't be detected.

3805
04:09:27,480 --> 04:09:28,480
I messed that up.

3806
04:09:28,480 --> 04:09:29,480
My goodness.

3807
04:09:29,480 --> 04:09:30,480
No, don't fall.

3808
04:09:30,480 --> 04:09:31,480
Okay, it's fine.

3809
04:09:31,480 --> 04:09:32,480
The senator's right there.

3810
04:09:32,480 --> 04:09:34,480
The banker's over there.

3811
04:09:34,480 --> 04:09:35,480
Well, failed anyway.

3812
04:09:35,480 --> 04:09:37,480
It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.

3813
04:09:44,480 --> 04:09:46,480
I know on Twitter on YouTube,

3814
04:09:46,480 --> 04:09:48,480
but I've got three ASMR videos I need to come out

3815
04:09:48,480 --> 04:09:51,480
and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.

3816
04:09:51,480 --> 04:09:52,480
Subscribblers.

3817
04:09:54,480 --> 04:09:56,480
Yeah, basically,

3818
04:09:56,480 --> 04:09:59,480
my stats say that I've been subscribed to

3819
04:09:59,480 --> 04:10:02,480
over 5,000 subscribers.

3820
04:10:02,480 --> 04:10:04,480
But obviously,

3821
04:10:04,480 --> 04:10:06,480
because we've been getting called,

3822
04:10:06,480 --> 04:10:08,480
it keeps going down again.

3823
04:10:08,480 --> 04:10:10,480
And I was like, oh, okay, I guess.

3824
04:10:10,480 --> 04:10:12,480
But, oh no, I can't leave.

3825
04:10:12,480 --> 04:10:13,480
Oh, I don't have to leave.

3826
04:10:13,480 --> 04:10:14,480
How do I get up here?

3827
04:10:18,480 --> 04:10:20,480
How do I get up here again?

3828
04:10:23,480 --> 04:10:25,480
Well, if you're the only streamer on YouTube,

3829
04:10:25,480 --> 04:10:26,480
it would be Twitch streams.

3830
04:10:28,480 --> 04:10:30,480
Not really interested in Twitch,

3831
04:10:30,480 --> 04:10:32,480
because of the arbitrary,

3832
04:10:32,480 --> 04:10:34,480
like, you're fine,

3833
04:10:34,480 --> 04:10:36,480
but you're not fine.

3834
04:10:36,480 --> 04:10:38,480
And, yeah,

3835
04:10:38,480 --> 04:10:40,480
whereas, like, YouTube, at least,

3836
04:10:40,480 --> 04:10:42,480
it's kind of like, there's definitely an open status quo

3837
04:10:42,480 --> 04:10:44,480
with YouTube.

3838
04:10:44,480 --> 04:10:46,480
And that's much easier to, like,

3839
04:10:47,480 --> 04:10:49,480
it's, you know,

3840
04:10:49,480 --> 04:10:50,480
darling,

3841
04:10:50,480 --> 04:10:51,480
hen,

3842
04:10:51,480 --> 04:10:52,480
you're stressing me out.

3843
04:10:52,480 --> 04:10:53,480
Get up.

3844
04:10:53,480 --> 04:10:55,480
Get it up.

3845
04:10:55,480 --> 04:10:56,480
Don't be nervous.

3846
04:10:56,480 --> 04:10:58,480
One in three men, get it up.

3847
04:10:58,480 --> 04:11:00,480
What do you mean I'm putting more pressure on you

3848
04:11:00,480 --> 04:11:02,480
to perform?

3849
04:11:02,480 --> 04:11:04,480
Get it up.

3850
04:11:04,480 --> 04:11:06,480
Maybe that would be a really funny audio.

3851
04:11:08,480 --> 04:11:10,480
Like, I'm absolutely desperate,

3852
04:11:10,480 --> 04:11:12,480
and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.

3853
04:11:12,480 --> 04:11:14,480
But I'm feeling that would be really unner-

3854
04:11:14,480 --> 04:11:16,480
Maybe for a meme audio, I can do that.

3855
04:11:16,480 --> 04:11:18,480
I don't think that would be a really funny audio.

3856
04:11:22,480 --> 04:11:24,480
I get, like, really aggressive,

3857
04:11:24,480 --> 04:11:26,480
like, come on!

3858
04:11:28,480 --> 04:11:30,480
I've never been auto-insub before.

3859
04:11:30,480 --> 04:11:32,480
A lot of people have been.

3860
04:11:32,480 --> 04:11:33,480
Yeah.

3861
04:11:33,480 --> 04:11:34,480
It's okay.

3862
04:11:34,480 --> 04:11:36,480
The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.

3863
04:11:36,480 --> 04:11:38,480
So, once I've finished the stream,

3864
04:11:38,480 --> 04:11:40,480
YouTube is gonna have to admit to itself

3865
04:11:40,480 --> 04:11:42,480
that I have 8,000-

3866
04:11:42,480 --> 04:11:44,480
8,000 hours.

3867
04:11:44,480 --> 04:11:46,480
No, I have 8 hours in Assassin's Creed,

3868
04:11:46,480 --> 04:11:48,480
and, yeah, people were, like,

3869
04:11:48,480 --> 04:11:50,480
actually interacting stuff on stream.

3870
04:11:50,480 --> 04:11:52,480
So, yeah, YouTube.

3871
04:11:52,480 --> 04:11:54,480
Strongly won.

3872
04:11:54,480 --> 04:11:55,480
YouTube zero.

3873
04:11:55,480 --> 04:11:57,480
And the girls have been absolutely fantastic

3874
04:11:57,480 --> 04:11:59,480
about the culling as well.

3875
04:11:59,480 --> 04:12:01,480
Like, they have been...

3876
04:12:01,480 --> 04:12:03,480
I asked them,

3877
04:12:03,480 --> 04:12:05,480
like, I do not expect the girls

3878
04:12:05,480 --> 04:12:07,480
to stream every single day.

3879
04:12:07,480 --> 04:12:09,480
I've told them countless times, the only reason I can do it

3880
04:12:09,480 --> 04:12:11,480
is because I have rotism, your honor.

3881
04:12:12,480 --> 04:12:14,480
But I did ask them, like,

3882
04:12:14,480 --> 04:12:16,480
hey, for the first week,

3883
04:12:16,480 --> 04:12:18,480
you're most likely gonna have the most views,

3884
04:12:18,480 --> 04:12:20,480
like, you'll kind of, like,

3885
04:12:20,480 --> 04:12:22,480
the deba...no, buff from debut.

3886
04:12:25,480 --> 04:12:27,480
And, like, all of them were like,

3887
04:12:27,480 --> 04:12:29,480
yeah, I'll give it my all, like,

3888
04:12:29,480 --> 04:12:31,480
I'll stream as much as I can in the first week,

3889
04:12:31,480 --> 04:12:33,480
and I'm, like, so freaking thankful and grateful,

3890
04:12:33,480 --> 04:12:35,480
and, like, I really think it will, like,

3891
04:12:35,480 --> 04:12:37,480
completely help with the culling

3892
04:12:37,480 --> 04:12:39,480
and all that jazz.

3893
04:12:39,480 --> 04:12:42,480
So this mission is bizarre.

3894
04:12:42,480 --> 04:12:44,480
You basically have to guess

3895
04:12:44,480 --> 04:12:46,480
the path of where you need to go,

3896
04:12:46,480 --> 04:12:48,480
and, of course, I haven't unlocked the map,

3897
04:12:48,480 --> 04:12:50,480
so I've freaking done it wrong already.

3898
04:12:50,480 --> 04:12:52,480
Is it this way?

3899
04:12:52,480 --> 04:12:54,480
But you're also timed as well.

3900
04:12:54,480 --> 04:12:56,480
Um...

3901
04:12:56,480 --> 04:12:58,480
Aw, and I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.

3902
04:12:58,480 --> 04:13:00,480
I think I have to go up the stairs.

3903
04:13:03,480 --> 04:13:06,480
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

3904
04:13:06,480 --> 04:13:08,480
No, right, I'm going the wrong way.

3905
04:13:09,480 --> 04:13:11,480
Yeah, so they get, like, suspicious of you

3906
04:13:11,480 --> 04:13:13,480
if you go the wrong way, and it's, like, um...

3907
04:13:13,480 --> 04:13:15,480
I'm sorry.

3908
04:13:17,480 --> 04:13:19,480
Oh, I know, like, the general idea,

3909
04:13:19,480 --> 04:13:21,480
but I don't know the right way, 100%.

3910
04:13:21,480 --> 04:13:25,480
I don't even remember going past these portons, honestly.

3911
04:13:27,480 --> 04:13:30,480
Um, I think we go right of the church.

3912
04:13:32,480 --> 04:13:35,480
And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.

3913
04:13:35,480 --> 04:13:37,480
My brain is telling me.

3914
04:13:38,480 --> 04:13:40,480
Goodness.

3915
04:13:41,480 --> 04:13:43,480
Yes, and then take a left under here,

3916
04:13:43,480 --> 04:13:45,480
and then the bridge that's up ahead.

3917
04:13:45,480 --> 04:13:47,480
Okay, I think we've already nailed it.

3918
04:13:47,480 --> 04:13:49,480
That is literally how much I've played this game.

3919
04:13:49,480 --> 04:13:51,480
Um...

3920
04:13:51,480 --> 04:13:53,480
The noise keeps putting me off,

3921
04:13:53,480 --> 04:13:55,480
but, like, I know where I'm going, okay?

3922
04:13:55,480 --> 04:13:57,480
Jeez.

3923
04:13:57,480 --> 04:13:59,480
Literally, this is the correct way,

3924
04:13:59,480 --> 04:14:01,480
in the games, like, I was suspicious.

3925
04:14:01,480 --> 04:14:03,480
No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.

3926
04:14:03,480 --> 04:14:05,480
I've played it enough to know this is the right way.

3927
04:14:05,480 --> 04:14:07,480
This is the way.

3928
04:14:07,480 --> 04:14:09,480
Anyone watch Mandalorian?

3929
04:14:09,480 --> 04:14:11,480
Grogu's adorable.

3930
04:14:11,480 --> 04:14:13,480
Grogu. See? There we go.

3931
04:14:13,480 --> 04:14:15,480
We did it.

3932
04:14:15,480 --> 04:14:17,480
Uh, yeah.

3933
04:14:17,480 --> 04:14:19,480
That's all we have to do.

3934
04:14:19,480 --> 04:14:21,480
And we have completed this section.

3935
04:14:21,480 --> 04:14:23,480
None...

3936
04:14:23,480 --> 04:14:25,480
More than an angry squirt.

3937
04:14:25,480 --> 04:14:27,480
Oh, yeah.

3938
04:14:27,480 --> 04:14:29,480
PayPal...

3939
04:14:31,480 --> 04:14:33,480
I don't know what's going on with the PayPal

3940
04:14:33,480 --> 04:14:35,480
and the business, because we literally submitted...

3941
04:14:35,480 --> 04:14:37,480
It has been established

3942
04:14:37,480 --> 04:14:39,480
for months.

3943
04:14:39,480 --> 04:14:41,480
Like, all the stuff we've established for months.

3944
04:14:41,480 --> 04:14:43,480
I think, unironically,

3945
04:14:43,480 --> 04:14:45,480
you guys were supporting, like, AC

3946
04:14:45,480 --> 04:14:47,480
and me so much

3947
04:14:47,480 --> 04:14:49,480
that PayPal's like,

3948
04:14:49,480 --> 04:14:51,480
this is suspicious!

3949
04:14:51,480 --> 04:14:53,480
And then the PayPal's now blocked.

3950
04:14:53,480 --> 04:14:55,480
So thank you for all the support you've shown

3951
04:14:55,480 --> 04:14:57,480
the girls already.

3952
04:14:57,480 --> 04:14:59,480
You literally got the account

3953
04:14:59,480 --> 04:15:01,480
suspended.

3954
04:15:01,480 --> 04:15:03,480
You've literally, like, so much support.

3955
04:15:03,480 --> 04:15:05,480
You've suspended being

3956
04:15:05,480 --> 04:15:07,480
able to support the girls' monetary.

3957
04:15:07,480 --> 04:15:09,480
Like...

3958
04:15:09,480 --> 04:15:11,480
Which is hilarious if you think about it.

3959
04:15:11,480 --> 04:15:13,480
Um, okay. We're just

3960
04:15:13,480 --> 04:15:15,480
tailing the guards.

3961
04:15:15,480 --> 04:15:17,480
This is the court's on mission I was talking about,

3962
04:15:17,480 --> 04:15:19,480
which is necessary to have them.

3963
04:15:19,480 --> 04:15:21,480
Um, if you avoid the guards as much as possible

3964
04:15:21,480 --> 04:15:23,480
to hold on to the group for as long as possible

3965
04:15:23,480 --> 04:15:25,480
because you have two sets

3966
04:15:25,480 --> 04:15:27,480
of girls

3967
04:15:27,480 --> 04:15:29,480
that will go out to distract guards.

3968
04:15:29,480 --> 04:15:31,480
But if you get too close to guards

3969
04:15:31,480 --> 04:15:33,480
and you didn't want to distract,

3970
04:15:33,480 --> 04:15:35,480
they essentially get wasted.

3971
04:15:35,480 --> 04:15:37,480
And it's about me

3972
04:15:37,480 --> 04:15:39,480
literally suffering from success.

3973
04:15:39,480 --> 04:15:41,480
Um...

3974
04:15:41,480 --> 04:15:43,480
I think

3975
04:15:43,480 --> 04:15:45,480
management managed to pay everyone

3976
04:15:45,480 --> 04:15:47,480
for the watch-alongs

3977
04:15:47,480 --> 04:15:49,480
in time before that happened.

3978
04:15:49,480 --> 04:15:51,480
Uh...

3979
04:15:51,480 --> 04:15:53,480
But I hope so, because there is a lot of money.

3980
04:15:53,480 --> 04:15:55,480
I think, like, the total for sponsors...

3981
04:15:55,480 --> 04:15:57,480
No! We lost a group to that.

3982
04:15:57,480 --> 04:15:59,480
To the hay bale.

3983
04:15:59,480 --> 04:16:01,480
Um...

3984
04:16:01,480 --> 04:16:03,480
I think the total of, like,

3985
04:16:03,480 --> 04:16:05,480
sponsorships was, like...

3986
04:16:05,480 --> 04:16:07,480
I don't mind talking about this.

3987
04:16:07,480 --> 04:16:09,480
It was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US

3988
04:16:09,480 --> 04:16:11,480
dollars mark for everyone, like, compiled.

3989
04:16:11,480 --> 04:16:13,480
Um...

3990
04:16:13,480 --> 04:16:15,480
The original budget

3991
04:16:15,480 --> 04:16:17,480
was, like, 20,000.

3992
04:16:17,480 --> 04:16:19,480
But hardly anyone

3993
04:16:19,480 --> 04:16:21,480
was replying

3994
04:16:21,480 --> 04:16:23,480
to the agency.

3995
04:16:23,480 --> 04:16:25,480
So shout out to Umi Plus

3996
04:16:25,480 --> 04:16:27,480
and shout out to

3997
04:16:27,480 --> 04:16:29,480
VNU agency.

3998
04:16:29,480 --> 04:16:31,480
Don't be surprised if you see us

3999
04:16:31,480 --> 04:16:33,480
collaborating with them.

4000
04:16:33,480 --> 04:16:35,480
They were fantastic

4001
04:16:35,480 --> 04:16:37,480
and lovely, and actually

4002
04:16:37,480 --> 04:16:39,480
gave us the time of day.

4003
04:16:39,480 --> 04:16:41,480
Um...

4004
04:16:41,480 --> 04:16:43,480
Yeah.

4005
04:16:45,480 --> 04:16:47,480
So don't be surprised if you see us

4006
04:16:47,480 --> 04:16:49,480
working with those girls, because their agency

4007
04:16:49,480 --> 04:16:51,480
was kind enough to give us the time of day.

4008
04:16:51,480 --> 04:16:53,480
Whereas, pretty much, everyone

4009
04:16:53,480 --> 04:16:55,480
else ignored us, so...

4010
04:16:55,480 --> 04:16:57,480
Yeah.

4011
04:17:01,480 --> 04:17:03,480
Happy it went well, yes.

4012
04:17:03,480 --> 04:17:05,480
The watch-alongs were a complete success.

4013
04:17:05,480 --> 04:17:07,480
Special thank you to everyone

4014
04:17:07,480 --> 04:17:09,480
who did them

4015
04:17:09,480 --> 04:17:11,480
and all of that jazz.

4016
04:17:11,480 --> 04:17:13,480
Uh...

4017
04:17:13,480 --> 04:17:15,480
I'm currently listening to

4018
04:17:15,480 --> 04:17:17,480
flirting in my ear, because I just heard

4019
04:17:17,480 --> 04:17:19,480
you say, Priest of Confession

4020
04:17:19,480 --> 04:17:21,480
or something like that.

4021
04:17:21,480 --> 04:17:23,480
Oh my god.

4022
04:17:23,480 --> 04:17:25,480
What happens

4023
04:17:25,480 --> 04:17:27,480
if we had a nun

4024
04:17:27,480 --> 04:17:29,480
design, okay?

4025
04:17:29,480 --> 04:17:31,480
But then, she had

4026
04:17:31,480 --> 04:17:33,480
a real design under it, but we

4027
04:17:33,480 --> 04:17:35,480
promote her as a genuine, completely

4028
04:17:35,480 --> 04:17:37,480
covered up nun.

4029
04:17:37,480 --> 04:17:39,480
And the promo artwork, her

4030
04:17:39,480 --> 04:17:41,480
voice lines are super conservative

4031
04:17:41,480 --> 04:17:43,480
and everything. And then on debut

4032
04:17:43,480 --> 04:17:45,480
she reveals her real design.

4033
04:17:45,480 --> 04:17:47,480
That'd be so cool.

4034
04:17:47,480 --> 04:17:49,480
I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud,

4035
04:17:49,480 --> 04:17:51,480
but I don't control the design, so

4036
04:17:51,480 --> 04:17:53,480
I'm allowed to say this stuff.

4037
04:17:53,480 --> 04:17:55,480
Um...

4038
04:17:55,480 --> 04:17:57,480
I've got none to do with it.

4039
04:17:57,480 --> 04:17:59,480
I love having no more responsibilities.

4040
04:17:59,480 --> 04:18:01,480
There's not going to be a Fond de la Buse

4041
04:18:01,480 --> 04:18:03,480
because I don't have that responsibility anymore.

4042
04:18:03,480 --> 04:18:05,480
Yay!

4043
04:18:05,480 --> 04:18:07,480
But admit it,

4044
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:09,480
you love Fond de la Buse.

4045
04:18:09,480 --> 04:18:11,480
I'm allowed to do it.

4046
04:18:25,480 --> 04:18:27,480
Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.

4047
04:18:27,480 --> 04:18:29,480
Did you like seeing the behind the scenes

4048
04:18:29,480 --> 04:18:31,480
of how we all looked?

4049
04:18:31,480 --> 04:18:33,480
I am very

4050
04:18:33,480 --> 04:18:35,480
interested in getting a Celtic design.

4051
04:18:35,480 --> 04:18:37,480
I'm going to say something

4052
04:18:37,480 --> 04:18:39,480
controversial, Karen.

4053
04:18:39,480 --> 04:18:41,480
I actually don't like having

4054
04:18:41,480 --> 04:18:43,480
booba out on Vichubama Do.

4055
04:18:43,480 --> 04:18:45,480
And not my thing.

4056
04:18:45,480 --> 04:18:47,480
And like the cleavage

4057
04:18:47,480 --> 04:18:49,480
and all that. No, not my thing.

4058
04:18:49,480 --> 04:18:51,480
No!

4059
04:18:51,480 --> 04:18:53,480
He got yo-inged by two of the

4060
04:18:53,480 --> 04:18:55,480
freaking girls. Are you so dumb?

4061
04:18:55,480 --> 04:18:57,480
Why would you do that?

4062
04:18:57,480 --> 04:18:59,480
Grrr.

4063
04:18:59,480 --> 04:19:01,480
Vee sucky,

4064
04:19:01,480 --> 04:19:03,480
my fave ages.

4065
04:19:03,480 --> 04:19:05,480
Bruv, it was

4066
04:19:05,480 --> 04:19:07,480
rough.

4067
04:19:07,480 --> 04:19:09,480
Development was rough.

4068
04:19:09,480 --> 04:19:11,480
I'm very happy I never have to develop

4069
04:19:11,480 --> 04:19:13,480
anything ever again.

4070
04:19:13,480 --> 04:19:15,480
Like it's completely off-handed.

4071
04:19:15,480 --> 04:19:17,480
I no longer have to do anything.

4072
04:19:17,480 --> 04:19:19,480
And it's such a good feeling.

4073
04:19:19,480 --> 04:19:21,480
Right, we're just going to hire

4074
04:19:21,480 --> 04:19:23,480
these courtesans to make sure

4075
04:19:23,480 --> 04:19:25,480
all is good.

4076
04:19:25,480 --> 04:19:27,480
But I think we're pretty

4077
04:19:27,480 --> 04:19:29,480
safe.

4078
04:19:29,480 --> 04:19:31,480
Make yourself flat.

4079
04:19:31,480 --> 04:19:33,480
Honestly, I might.

4080
04:19:33,480 --> 04:19:35,480
I might have costume or something.

4081
04:19:35,480 --> 04:19:37,480
Design.

4082
04:19:37,480 --> 04:19:39,480
Alternative outfit, that's how you say it.

4083
04:19:39,480 --> 04:19:41,480
Target is on the move.

4084
04:19:41,480 --> 04:19:43,480
I repeat.

4085
04:19:43,480 --> 04:19:45,480
Tango is on the move.

4086
04:19:45,480 --> 04:19:47,480
Alpha. Bravo. Charlie.

4087
04:19:47,480 --> 04:19:49,480
Delta. Echo. Foxtrot.

4088
04:19:49,480 --> 04:19:51,480
Gamma. Indigo.

4089
04:19:51,480 --> 04:19:53,480
I don't know if that's alphabet.

4090
04:19:53,480 --> 04:19:55,480
Right, right, right.

4091
04:19:55,480 --> 04:19:57,480
Girls, girls, put your arm down.

4092
04:19:57,480 --> 04:19:59,480
Put your arm down.

4093
04:19:59,480 --> 04:20:01,480
Into the hei bail we go.

4094
04:20:01,480 --> 04:20:03,480
The hei bail of shame.

4095
04:20:03,480 --> 04:20:05,480
A big plus for you.

4096
04:20:05,480 --> 04:20:07,480
Behind the scenes and the info.

4097
04:20:13,480 --> 04:20:15,480
Yeah, like, I really

4098
04:20:15,480 --> 04:20:17,480
not really bothered for secrets.

4099
04:20:17,480 --> 04:20:19,480
It's like, how do you do this?

4100
04:20:19,480 --> 04:20:21,480
Put a lot of money behind it.

4101
04:20:21,480 --> 04:20:23,480
Okay, how do you do that?

4102
04:20:23,480 --> 04:20:25,480
Put a lot of money behind it.

4103
04:20:25,480 --> 04:20:27,480
If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,

4104
04:20:27,480 --> 04:20:29,480
I'm going to say this to you.

4105
04:20:29,480 --> 04:20:31,480
Whatever you think it's going to cost.

4106
04:20:31,480 --> 04:20:33,480
Double it.

4107
04:20:33,480 --> 04:20:35,480
I then give it some more.

4108
04:20:35,480 --> 04:20:37,480
Whatever time you think it's going to take.

4109
04:20:37,480 --> 04:20:39,480
Double it.

4110
04:20:39,480 --> 04:20:41,480
And give it some more.

4111
04:20:41,480 --> 04:20:43,480
I had a lot of

4112
04:20:43,480 --> 04:20:45,480
issues with

4113
04:20:45,480 --> 04:20:47,480
like,

4114
04:20:47,480 --> 04:20:49,480
artists going

4115
04:20:49,480 --> 04:20:51,480
past deadlines.

4116
04:20:51,480 --> 04:20:53,480
So everything

4117
04:20:53,480 --> 04:20:55,480
slid back into me

4118
04:20:55,480 --> 04:20:57,480
and it was horrific for me.

4119
04:20:57,480 --> 04:20:59,480
Which is why

4120
04:20:59,480 --> 04:21:01,480
I don't have a lot of things done.

4121
04:21:01,480 --> 04:21:03,480
My ASMR audios are recorded,

4122
04:21:03,480 --> 04:21:05,480
but they aren't edited for you

4123
04:21:05,480 --> 04:21:07,480
that go on YouTube.

4124
04:21:07,480 --> 04:21:09,480
And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done.

4125
04:21:09,480 --> 04:21:11,480
But, you know, things happened and stuff happens.

4126
04:21:11,480 --> 04:21:13,480
But everything's been fantastic.

4127
04:21:13,480 --> 04:21:15,480
The reception the girls

4128
04:21:15,480 --> 04:21:17,480
received, I'm just so glad people are

4129
04:21:17,480 --> 04:21:19,480
loving on them and just so happy

4130
04:21:19,480 --> 04:21:21,480
with them.

4131
04:21:21,480 --> 04:21:23,480
Like,

4132
04:21:23,480 --> 04:21:25,480
it was not easy

4133
04:21:25,480 --> 04:21:27,480
because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.

4134
04:21:27,480 --> 04:21:29,480
It was not easy

4135
04:21:29,480 --> 04:21:31,480
to

4136
04:21:31,480 --> 04:21:33,480
assign people

4137
04:21:33,480 --> 04:21:35,480
a pre-made model.

4138
04:21:35,480 --> 04:21:37,480
I saw some people ask,

4139
04:21:37,480 --> 04:21:39,480
why don't they just create the models themselves

4140
04:21:39,480 --> 04:21:41,480
that they like?

4141
04:21:41,480 --> 04:21:43,480
I understand that I don't

4142
04:21:43,480 --> 04:21:45,480
do that. You have no idea

4143
04:21:45,480 --> 04:21:47,480
how freaking hard it is to coordinate

4144
04:21:47,480 --> 04:21:49,480
X amount of

4145
04:21:49,480 --> 04:21:51,480
modelers to come together, to come make a concept,

4146
04:21:51,480 --> 04:21:53,480
come to this, come to that.

4147
04:21:53,480 --> 04:21:55,480
I am not doing that approach.

4148
04:21:55,480 --> 04:21:57,480
Please do not think the viewer is going to end up doing that approach.

4149
04:21:57,480 --> 04:21:59,480
However, the girls are more than

4150
04:21:59,480 --> 04:22:01,480
welcome to... Hello? Hello?

4151
04:22:01,480 --> 04:22:03,480
No, we missed a...

4152
04:22:03,480 --> 04:22:05,480
We missed the opportunity

4153
04:22:05,480 --> 04:22:07,480
to assassinate them.

4154
04:22:07,480 --> 04:22:09,480
Bruh. Come back here right now.

4155
04:22:09,480 --> 04:22:11,480
My goodness. Come back here.

4156
04:22:11,480 --> 04:22:13,480
Oh, right. Well, just do it later.

4157
04:22:13,480 --> 04:22:15,480
Pfft.

4158
04:22:15,480 --> 04:22:17,480
Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?

4159
04:22:17,480 --> 04:22:19,480
I think the court is on its path and maybe

4160
04:22:19,480 --> 04:22:21,480
messed them up. Bruh, get right back here.

4161
04:22:21,480 --> 04:22:23,480
But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls

4162
04:22:23,480 --> 04:22:25,480
to tell me what they want for alternative

4163
04:22:25,480 --> 04:22:27,480
outfits and stuff. That's not a problem

4164
04:22:27,480 --> 04:22:29,480
at all.

4165
04:22:29,480 --> 04:22:31,480
But

4166
04:22:31,480 --> 04:22:33,480
to do a debut

4167
04:22:33,480 --> 04:22:35,480
that has input from the start

4168
04:22:35,480 --> 04:22:37,480
that's

4169
04:22:37,480 --> 04:22:39,480
being signed on in

4170
04:22:39,480 --> 04:22:41,480
development is like six months

4171
04:22:41,480 --> 04:22:43,480
in the making. No one wants to be

4172
04:22:43,480 --> 04:22:45,480
hanging about six months

4173
04:22:45,480 --> 04:22:47,480
waiting for their new job

4174
04:22:47,480 --> 04:22:49,480
to start. Yeno?

4175
04:22:49,480 --> 04:22:51,480
Oh, Mero. Hi, Mero.

4176
04:22:51,480 --> 04:22:53,480
How are you doing?

4177
04:22:53,480 --> 04:22:55,480
He has a gun.

4178
04:22:55,480 --> 04:22:57,480
Emi's gone live.

4179
04:22:57,480 --> 04:22:59,480
Okay. Emi... Oh!

4180
04:22:59,480 --> 04:23:01,480
Oops, I wasn't paying attention. Hold on.

4181
04:23:01,480 --> 04:23:03,480
I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.

4182
04:23:03,480 --> 04:23:05,480
Oh, no! The hay bale!

4183
04:23:05,480 --> 04:23:07,480
Oh!

4184
04:23:07,480 --> 04:23:09,480
My ankles!

4185
04:23:09,480 --> 04:23:11,480
The hay bale!

4186
04:23:11,480 --> 04:23:13,480
I missed... Oh, that's more guards!

4187
04:23:13,480 --> 04:23:15,480
I'm... I'm hiding in the corner.

4188
04:23:15,480 --> 04:23:17,480
There's so many guards around me.

4189
04:23:17,480 --> 04:23:19,480
I can carry it!

4190
04:23:23,480 --> 04:23:25,480
Oh, my God!

4191
04:23:25,480 --> 04:23:27,480
How did they all follow me here?

4192
04:23:27,480 --> 04:23:29,480
All right, I'm calling in the assassins.

4193
04:23:29,480 --> 04:23:31,480
You're stuck.

4194
04:23:31,480 --> 04:23:33,480
Oh, my God!

4195
04:23:33,480 --> 04:23:35,480
There is so many!

4196
04:23:39,480 --> 04:23:41,480
It ripped the ankles.

4197
04:23:41,480 --> 04:23:43,480
I know.

4198
04:23:44,480 --> 04:23:46,480
Oh.

4199
04:23:46,480 --> 04:23:48,480
Funny you come in here, Mero.

4200
04:23:48,480 --> 04:23:50,480
I was just talking about your agency.

4201
04:23:52,480 --> 04:23:54,480
I was seeing how Yumi Plus

4202
04:23:54,480 --> 04:23:56,480
is one of the very few

4203
04:23:56,480 --> 04:23:58,480
agencies that responded

4204
04:23:58,480 --> 04:24:00,480
to the watch-along offers

4205
04:24:00,480 --> 04:24:02,480
that VLR made.

4206
04:24:02,480 --> 04:24:05,480
Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.

4207
04:24:05,480 --> 04:24:08,480
We love Yumi Plus out here.

4208
04:24:10,480 --> 04:24:12,480
They found us in two seconds.

4209
04:24:12,480 --> 04:24:14,480
I was like pinned against that wall.

4210
04:24:14,480 --> 04:24:17,480
Like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.

4211
04:24:17,480 --> 04:24:19,480
Oh, what? Yeah.

4212
04:24:19,480 --> 04:24:21,480
Hardly.

4213
04:24:21,480 --> 04:24:24,480
We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.

4214
04:24:24,480 --> 04:24:27,480
And your agency and VNU

4215
04:24:27,480 --> 04:24:29,480
were the only two agencies

4216
04:24:29,480 --> 04:24:31,480
that were kind enough to respond to us.

4217
04:24:31,480 --> 04:24:33,480
Where are Claudia and Maria?

4218
04:24:33,480 --> 04:24:35,480
We can talk with the money.

4219
04:24:35,480 --> 04:24:37,480
They followed us all.

4220
04:24:37,480 --> 04:24:39,480
Sorry, I was trying to go to Amy's room.

4221
04:24:39,480 --> 04:24:41,480
I have good news for you.

4222
04:24:41,480 --> 04:24:43,480
I want you to go to Amy's stream.

4223
04:24:44,480 --> 04:24:47,480
If any mods, you get one

4224
04:24:47,480 --> 04:24:49,480
speaking permission.

4225
04:24:49,480 --> 04:24:51,480
Amy's stream link.

4226
04:24:51,480 --> 04:24:53,480
That's your only time you're allowed to talk.

4227
04:24:55,480 --> 04:24:57,480
Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?

4228
04:24:57,480 --> 04:24:59,480
I don't know, I've seen that before.

4229
04:24:59,480 --> 04:25:01,480
All those numbers.

4230
04:25:03,480 --> 04:25:04,480
No more talking mods.

4231
04:25:04,480 --> 04:25:05,480
Silence!

4232
04:25:05,480 --> 04:25:06,480
Silence.

4233
04:25:06,480 --> 04:25:07,480
Thank you.

4234
04:25:07,480 --> 04:25:09,480
But yes, please enjoy

4235
04:25:09,480 --> 04:25:11,480
watching Amy Bizzou.

4236
04:25:11,480 --> 04:25:13,480
I recommend you watch any of my gen mates

4237
04:25:13,480 --> 04:25:15,480
when they go live because I myself

4238
04:25:15,480 --> 04:25:18,480
am an endurance streamer.

4239
04:25:18,480 --> 04:25:21,480
And I will be here for many, many an hour.

4240
04:25:21,480 --> 04:25:23,480
I will be trying to finish the

4241
04:25:23,480 --> 04:25:25,480
campaign mode of this game.

4242
04:25:25,480 --> 04:25:27,480
So please, do not feel any type of way

4243
04:25:27,480 --> 04:25:30,480
if you go to watch any of my gen mates.

4244
04:25:30,480 --> 04:25:32,480
I absolutely appreciate it and love it.

4245
04:25:32,480 --> 04:25:33,480
Please always consider

4246
04:25:33,480 --> 04:25:35,480
liking and scrub-scribing

4247
04:25:35,480 --> 04:25:37,480
to their channels.

4248
04:25:37,480 --> 04:25:39,480
I would love to see them

4249
04:25:39,480 --> 04:25:41,480
get ahead of me sub-wise

4250
04:25:41,480 --> 04:25:43,480
because the girls

4251
04:25:43,480 --> 04:25:45,480
are fantastic and they have

4252
04:25:45,480 --> 04:25:47,480
so much potential

4253
04:25:47,480 --> 04:25:49,480
that I see in them

4254
04:25:49,480 --> 04:25:51,480
and I just want them to...

4255
04:25:51,480 --> 04:25:53,480
I did not want to take your horse.

4256
04:25:53,480 --> 04:25:55,480
Please get back on your horse

4257
04:25:55,480 --> 04:25:57,480
and leave me alone. I apologize.

4258
04:25:59,480 --> 04:26:01,480
We're still short of the crossbow.

4259
04:26:03,480 --> 04:26:05,480
Maybe we can make enough money

4260
04:26:05,480 --> 04:26:07,480
if we send the recruits.

4261
04:26:07,480 --> 04:26:09,480
We kind of need the crossbow

4262
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:11,480
for this mission that's coming up.

4263
04:26:11,480 --> 04:26:13,480
If you do not have the crossbow,

4264
04:26:13,480 --> 04:26:15,480
it is a heck on earth.

4265
04:26:15,480 --> 04:26:17,480
It's not a fun thing.

4266
04:26:17,480 --> 04:26:19,480
Mercy's laugh is so good.

4267
04:26:19,480 --> 04:26:21,480
You're running the content. You didn't say content too.

4268
04:26:21,480 --> 04:26:23,480
Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.

4269
04:26:23,480 --> 04:26:25,480
Today we do campaign mode

4270
04:26:25,480 --> 04:26:27,480
and like go back to like 100% stuff.

4271
04:26:27,480 --> 04:26:29,480
Yes, see look at that money.

4272
04:26:29,480 --> 04:26:31,480
A thousand florins,

4273
04:26:31,480 --> 04:26:33,480
thousand, thousand...

4274
04:26:33,480 --> 04:26:35,480
Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.

4275
04:26:35,480 --> 04:26:37,480
Sometimes you can drop the T-H

4276
04:26:37,480 --> 04:26:39,480
and make it an E.

4277
04:26:39,480 --> 04:26:41,480
So the number 30

4278
04:26:41,480 --> 04:26:43,480
becomes the number 30.

4279
04:26:43,480 --> 04:26:45,480
I don't know if you can even hear the difference

4280
04:26:45,480 --> 04:26:47,480
but yeah, with an F. Very.

4281
04:26:49,480 --> 04:26:51,480
Whoa, we have 15,000?

4282
04:26:51,480 --> 04:26:53,480
That's like so much money.

4283
04:26:53,480 --> 04:26:55,480
I didn't expect that much actually.

4284
04:26:55,480 --> 04:26:57,480
I'm going to send the assassins

4285
04:26:57,480 --> 04:26:59,480
on another contract just to get them

4286
04:26:59,480 --> 04:27:01,480
more XP

4287
04:27:01,480 --> 04:27:03,480
because obviously the higher

4288
04:27:03,480 --> 04:27:05,480
they are, the more

4289
04:27:05,480 --> 04:27:07,480
likely they are

4290
04:27:07,480 --> 04:27:09,480
not to fall in battle.

4291
04:27:09,480 --> 04:27:11,480
I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.

4292
04:27:11,480 --> 04:27:13,480
We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.

4293
04:27:13,480 --> 04:27:15,480
Right. Someone say gambling time?

4294
04:27:15,480 --> 04:27:17,480
Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream

4295
04:27:17,480 --> 04:27:19,480
for you to say gambling time?

4296
04:27:19,480 --> 04:27:21,480
Is she being a naughty?

4297
04:27:21,480 --> 04:27:23,480
Oh, there's a thief down there.

4298
04:27:23,480 --> 04:27:25,480
Oh, I did gamble

4299
04:27:25,480 --> 04:27:27,480
with all the money. No, we're not gambling

4300
04:27:27,480 --> 04:27:29,480
with the florins. I need it for

4301
04:27:29,480 --> 04:27:31,480
crossbow ball.

4302
04:27:31,480 --> 04:27:33,480
And then we're going to go and travel

4303
04:27:33,480 --> 04:27:35,480
to the barracks.

4304
04:27:37,480 --> 04:27:39,480
Come.

4305
04:27:39,480 --> 04:27:41,480
Crossbow ball.

4306
04:27:41,480 --> 04:27:43,480
Best in slot

4307
04:27:43,480 --> 04:27:45,480
which is BIS.

4308
04:27:45,480 --> 04:27:47,480
Best in slot or biz for short.

4309
04:27:47,480 --> 04:27:49,480
Any biz.

4310
04:27:51,480 --> 04:27:53,480
She's doing ASMR.

4311
04:27:55,480 --> 04:27:57,480
Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking

4312
04:27:57,480 --> 04:27:59,480
for that. Okay.

4313
04:27:59,480 --> 04:28:01,480
Yeah, it makes sense now.

4314
04:28:01,480 --> 04:28:03,480
You may enjoy Amy's ASMR

4315
04:28:03,480 --> 04:28:05,480
for no

4316
04:28:05,480 --> 04:28:07,480
particular

4317
04:28:07,480 --> 04:28:09,480
reason.

4318
04:28:11,480 --> 04:28:13,480
We gamble.

4319
04:28:13,480 --> 04:28:15,480
It's supposed to be ASMR.

4320
04:28:15,480 --> 04:28:17,480
Yeah, I wonder if she

4321
04:28:17,480 --> 04:28:19,480
did that ASMR.

4322
04:28:19,480 --> 04:28:21,480
She DM'd me.

4323
04:28:21,480 --> 04:28:23,480
She's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?

4324
04:28:23,480 --> 04:28:25,480
I'm like, you know what? Just go for it.

4325
04:28:25,480 --> 04:28:27,480
I said, I told her, don't breathe

4326
04:28:27,480 --> 04:28:29,480
while you do the licking.

4327
04:28:33,480 --> 04:28:35,480
What does she mean by this?

4328
04:28:41,480 --> 04:28:43,480
Miam, miam, miam. Hydration check.

4329
04:28:47,480 --> 04:28:49,480
But still no.

4330
04:28:49,480 --> 04:28:51,480
Gamble to impress

4331
04:28:51,480 --> 04:28:53,480
or discuss the course.

4332
04:28:55,480 --> 04:28:57,480
We have them in a retreat.

4333
04:28:57,480 --> 04:28:59,480
They seem to be getting closer.

4334
04:28:59,480 --> 04:29:01,480
What does that mean?

4335
04:29:01,480 --> 04:29:03,480
Ear licking.

4336
04:29:07,480 --> 04:29:09,480
Yeah.

4337
04:29:09,480 --> 04:29:11,480
Don't take any down close.

4338
04:29:11,480 --> 04:29:13,480
Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.

4339
04:29:15,480 --> 04:29:17,480
This is bizarre.

4340
04:29:17,480 --> 04:29:19,480
They spawned in so many enemies

4341
04:29:19,480 --> 04:29:21,480
for this section.

4342
04:29:21,480 --> 04:29:23,480
I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun

4343
04:29:23,480 --> 04:29:25,480
but, my goodness.

4344
04:29:25,480 --> 04:29:27,480
Hold on.

4345
04:29:31,480 --> 04:29:33,480
You can disengage from fights

4346
04:29:33,480 --> 04:29:35,480
by just running away and jumping.

4347
04:29:35,480 --> 04:29:37,480
For some reason, jumping makes the AI

4348
04:29:37,480 --> 04:29:39,480
cry. The AI will not swing for you

4349
04:29:39,480 --> 04:29:41,480
if you jump.

4350
04:29:45,480 --> 04:29:47,480
The other entrance.

4351
04:29:47,480 --> 04:29:49,480
Wait a minute.

4352
04:29:49,480 --> 04:29:51,480
That can...

4353
04:29:51,480 --> 04:29:53,480
It has a double meaning.

4354
04:29:55,480 --> 04:29:57,480
No, no, refling the other entrance.

4355
04:29:57,480 --> 04:29:59,480
The other one.

4356
04:30:03,480 --> 04:30:05,480
Now we destroy all

4357
04:30:05,480 --> 04:30:07,480
of the baddies.

4358
04:30:11,480 --> 04:30:13,480
I do love going on a kill street

4359
04:30:13,480 --> 04:30:15,480
because it's really satisfying

4360
04:30:15,480 --> 04:30:17,480
that everyone...

4361
04:30:17,480 --> 04:30:19,480
The baddies are running

4362
04:30:19,480 --> 04:30:21,480
signals from the field.

4363
04:30:21,480 --> 04:30:23,480
Oh, bonjour.

4364
04:30:25,480 --> 04:30:27,480
Come closer and say that.

4365
04:30:27,480 --> 04:30:29,480
Soon all of

4366
04:30:29,480 --> 04:30:31,480
Italia will be speaking to you.

4367
04:30:31,480 --> 04:30:33,480
Valic sensibilities.

4368
04:30:39,480 --> 04:30:41,480
It's so nice of them to wait

4369
04:30:41,480 --> 04:30:43,480
one by one to attack you.

4370
04:30:43,480 --> 04:30:45,480
I know they have such good manners, honestly.

4371
04:30:47,480 --> 04:30:49,480
Mommy,

4372
04:30:49,480 --> 04:30:51,480
want to explore that?

4373
04:30:51,480 --> 04:30:53,480
I read the funniest

4374
04:30:53,480 --> 04:30:55,480
thing ever

4375
04:30:55,480 --> 04:30:57,480
and

4376
04:30:57,480 --> 04:30:59,480
if you know, you know.

4377
04:30:59,480 --> 04:31:01,480
It was like,

4378
04:31:01,480 --> 04:31:03,480
what happens if you take my boy cherry

4379
04:31:03,480 --> 04:31:15,480
and it was like,

4380
04:31:15,480 --> 04:31:17,480
I'm playing Brotherhood.

4381
04:31:17,480 --> 04:31:19,480
I'm going to watch the stream later

4382
04:31:19,480 --> 04:31:21,480
until all of you

4383
04:31:21,480 --> 04:31:23,480
have fun watching.

4384
04:31:31,480 --> 04:31:33,480
Look at the speed of this horse.

4385
04:31:33,480 --> 04:31:35,480
These horses

4386
04:31:35,480 --> 04:31:37,480
are so much slower.

4387
04:31:37,480 --> 04:31:39,480
What did you mean by that?

4388
04:31:39,480 --> 04:31:41,480
Development team of Brotherhood

4389
04:31:41,480 --> 04:31:43,480
by making the white horse

4390
04:31:43,480 --> 04:31:45,480
the slowest

4391
04:31:45,480 --> 04:31:47,480
in the black horse the fastest.

4392
04:31:47,480 --> 04:31:49,480
What did you mean by that?

4393
04:31:49,480 --> 04:31:51,480
Do you want to elaborate? No?

4394
04:31:51,480 --> 04:31:53,480
No, okay.

4395
04:31:53,480 --> 04:31:55,480
Something rather odd.

4396
04:31:55,480 --> 04:31:57,480
Rather odd about that.

4397
04:31:57,480 --> 04:31:59,480
But then again, it could just be coincidence.

4398
04:31:59,480 --> 04:32:01,480
But then

4399
04:32:01,480 --> 04:32:03,480
is it coincidence

4400
04:32:03,480 --> 04:32:05,480
if you go up

4401
04:32:05,480 --> 04:32:07,480
to like,

4402
04:32:07,480 --> 04:32:09,480
the tan horse is faster than the brown horse

4403
04:32:09,480 --> 04:32:11,480
is faster than the black ones the fastest?

4404
04:32:11,480 --> 04:32:13,480
Hmm.

4405
04:32:13,480 --> 04:32:15,480
Hmm.

4406
04:32:17,480 --> 04:32:19,480
Should we be offended

4407
04:32:19,480 --> 04:32:21,480
by a game that was made 14 years

4408
04:32:21,480 --> 04:32:23,480
ago?

4409
04:32:33,480 --> 04:32:35,480
Don't let the game journalists

4410
04:32:35,480 --> 04:32:37,480
hear we are now.

4411
04:32:37,480 --> 04:32:39,480
It's candle to be.

4412
04:32:41,480 --> 04:32:43,480
I

4413
04:32:47,480 --> 04:32:49,480
I miss when they can gallop.

4414
04:32:49,480 --> 04:32:51,480
You can still gallop, you have to hold A

4415
04:32:51,480 --> 04:32:53,480
but the problem with galloping is if there's like

4416
04:32:53,480 --> 04:32:55,480
people in the way your horse can fall over.

4417
04:32:59,480 --> 04:33:01,480
Canceled on first game stream.

4418
04:33:01,480 --> 04:33:03,480
Wait, why would I get cancelled

4419
04:33:03,480 --> 04:33:05,480
if I point out what the development did?

4420
04:33:05,480 --> 04:33:07,480
Why am I getting, hold on a minute.

4421
04:33:07,480 --> 04:33:09,480
No, no, no, you can't cancel me.

4422
04:33:09,480 --> 04:33:11,480
You just do not reflect to failure agency.

4423
04:33:13,480 --> 04:33:15,480
I just scream that.

4424
04:33:15,480 --> 04:33:17,480
Right, this is my only gripe.

4425
04:33:17,480 --> 04:33:19,480
This is my only gripe

4426
04:33:19,480 --> 04:33:21,480
with this mission.

4427
04:33:21,480 --> 04:33:23,480
You get left at the gate here

4428
04:33:23,480 --> 04:33:25,480
only, I repeat, you get left

4429
04:33:25,480 --> 04:33:27,480
at the gate here only

4430
04:33:27,480 --> 04:33:29,480
to have to horsey your way

4431
04:33:29,480 --> 04:33:31,480
back to the villa when the last

4432
04:33:31,480 --> 04:33:33,480
mission just got you from

4433
04:33:33,480 --> 04:33:35,480
the barracks

4434
04:33:35,480 --> 04:33:37,480
to there.

4435
04:33:37,480 --> 04:33:39,480
I'm just going back to like what you just did.

4436
04:33:39,480 --> 04:33:41,480
That's my only gripe.

4437
04:33:41,480 --> 04:33:43,480
That's right with that.

4438
04:33:43,480 --> 04:33:45,480
On the end.

4439
04:33:45,480 --> 04:33:47,480
Oh, I should do ASMR

4440
04:33:47,480 --> 04:33:49,480
like just me going

4441
04:33:49,480 --> 04:33:51,480
for like 30 minutes ear to ear.

4442
04:33:51,480 --> 04:33:53,480
What was that noise?

4443
04:33:53,480 --> 04:33:55,480
Is that a door?

4444
04:33:55,480 --> 04:33:57,480
It sounded like, ooh.

4445
04:33:59,480 --> 04:34:01,480
Once inside, your men can overpower

4446
04:34:01,480 --> 04:34:03,480
the camp patrols, correct?

4447
04:34:03,480 --> 04:34:05,480
Yes, but especially if the patrols

4448
04:34:05,480 --> 04:34:07,480
are taken completely by surprise.

4449
04:34:07,480 --> 04:34:09,480
Yes.

4450
04:34:09,480 --> 04:34:11,480
My ankle.

4451
04:34:11,480 --> 04:34:13,480
I'm sitting on it funny. I can't believe it.

4452
04:34:13,480 --> 04:34:15,480
That person grunting?

4453
04:34:15,480 --> 04:34:17,480
Literally, man.

4454
04:34:17,480 --> 04:34:19,480
Cody, you're truly a man.

4455
04:34:19,480 --> 04:34:21,480
I'm going to burp. I'm so sorry.

4456
04:34:23,480 --> 04:34:25,480
Oh, that was a little maybe burp.

4457
04:34:27,480 --> 04:34:29,480
Should have been a frog feature burp.

4458
04:34:29,480 --> 04:34:31,480
It would have been very good.

4459
04:34:31,480 --> 04:34:33,480
Oh, it could have been a hypno frog.

4460
04:34:33,480 --> 04:34:35,480
Honestly.

4461
04:34:35,480 --> 04:34:37,480
Do you ever sit normally?

4462
04:34:37,480 --> 04:34:39,480
No.

4463
04:34:39,480 --> 04:34:41,480
I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.

4464
04:34:41,480 --> 04:34:43,480
Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.

4465
04:34:43,480 --> 04:34:45,480
And it's just me showing you

4466
04:34:45,480 --> 04:34:47,480
how badly I sit like the entire time.

4467
04:34:47,480 --> 04:34:49,480
I thought a foot cam stream during a

4468
04:34:49,480 --> 04:34:51,480
horror game would be funny because you can

4469
04:34:51,480 --> 04:34:53,480
watch me shake my ankles.

4470
04:34:53,480 --> 04:34:55,480
And I also have a thing where I

4471
04:34:55,480 --> 04:34:57,480
press my toes into the ground.

4472
04:34:57,480 --> 04:34:59,480
Like I literally have like little

4473
04:34:59,480 --> 04:35:01,480
indents on my toes

4474
04:35:01,480 --> 04:35:03,480
from where I press them into the ground

4475
04:35:03,480 --> 04:35:05,480
because of the way my toes like

4476
04:35:05,480 --> 04:35:07,480
form over on it.

4477
04:35:07,480 --> 04:35:09,480
I know it's interesting, but

4478
04:35:09,480 --> 04:35:11,480
you know.

4479
04:35:11,480 --> 04:35:13,480
Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.

4480
04:35:13,480 --> 04:35:15,480
And the rotism picks you.

4481
04:35:19,480 --> 04:35:21,480
We've got three so far.

4482
04:35:23,480 --> 04:35:25,480
That would actually be funny.

4483
04:35:25,480 --> 04:35:27,480
Okay, I'm down for it.

4484
04:35:27,480 --> 04:35:29,480
Okay, my guy's already gone.

4485
04:35:29,480 --> 04:35:31,480
How about if I send people on you?

4486
04:35:33,480 --> 04:35:35,480
I don't want to get caught because we can easily

4487
04:35:35,480 --> 04:35:37,480
100% this.

4488
04:35:37,480 --> 04:35:39,480
But the assassin recruits take so long.

4489
04:35:39,480 --> 04:35:41,480
Okay, thankfully they got caught in the

4490
04:35:41,480 --> 04:35:43,480
whoa.

4491
04:35:43,480 --> 04:35:45,480
We're getting action shots, like the horse.

4492
04:35:45,480 --> 04:35:47,480
Okay.

4493
04:35:47,480 --> 04:35:49,480
They're a new recruit.

4494
04:35:49,480 --> 04:35:51,480
Let them get up.

4495
04:35:51,480 --> 04:35:53,480
Is the other assassin going to try and

4496
04:35:53,480 --> 04:35:55,480
help or?

4497
04:35:55,480 --> 04:35:57,480
No.

4498
04:35:57,480 --> 04:35:59,480
Let them get absolutely lanced.

4499
04:35:59,480 --> 04:36:01,480
Right, I'll help them out.

4500
04:36:01,480 --> 04:36:03,480
Oh, she's losing health.

4501
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:05,480
I don't like that.

4502
04:36:05,480 --> 04:36:07,480
Right, go kill the other guy now.

4503
04:36:07,480 --> 04:36:09,480
No, I got these.

4504
04:36:09,480 --> 04:36:11,480
I got discovered because of that.

4505
04:36:11,480 --> 04:36:13,480
Okay, whoa, we need to help.

4506
04:36:13,480 --> 04:36:15,480
We need to help. They're too strong.

4507
04:36:15,480 --> 04:36:17,480
This guy's too strong.

4508
04:36:17,480 --> 04:36:19,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not the horse.

4509
04:36:19,480 --> 04:36:21,480
Not the horse. Not the horse.

4510
04:36:21,480 --> 04:36:23,480
In the boss. In the boss. Get him in the boss.

4511
04:36:23,480 --> 04:36:25,480
Hit him in the boss. Hit him in the boss.

4512
04:36:25,480 --> 04:36:27,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4513
04:36:27,480 --> 04:36:29,480
It's fine. I don't know how to go against the horse.

4514
04:36:29,480 --> 04:36:31,480
Please leave me alone.

4515
04:36:31,480 --> 04:36:33,480
I don't know how to deal with horses.

4516
04:36:33,480 --> 04:36:35,480
Okay, there we go.

4517
04:36:35,480 --> 04:36:37,480
Okay, we're dealing with the crossbow ball.

4518
04:36:37,480 --> 04:36:39,480
Jeez.

4519
04:36:39,480 --> 04:36:41,480
Rank 10 assassins are so good,

4520
04:36:41,480 --> 04:36:43,480
honestly.

4521
04:36:43,480 --> 04:36:45,480
We are very slowly

4522
04:36:45,480 --> 04:36:47,480
leveling them up.

4523
04:36:47,480 --> 04:36:49,480
I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.

4524
04:36:49,480 --> 04:36:51,480
Can I pick a fight?

4525
04:36:51,480 --> 04:36:53,480
Ooh, feather.

4526
04:36:53,480 --> 04:36:55,480
Look how daintily I jumped over that.

4527
04:36:55,480 --> 04:36:57,480
That was beautiful.

4528
04:36:57,480 --> 04:36:59,480
Are you okay?

4529
04:36:59,480 --> 04:37:01,480
Have you heard about this? Have you heard about this jump?

4530
04:37:01,480 --> 04:37:03,480
Hey, there we go.

4531
04:37:03,480 --> 04:37:05,480
We're going to upset these guys.

4532
04:37:05,480 --> 04:37:07,480
Wait, that's a barrier?

4533
04:37:09,480 --> 04:37:11,480
That's a barrier.

4534
04:37:11,480 --> 04:37:13,480
Can you jump over them?

4535
04:37:13,480 --> 04:37:15,480
I've never seen that before.

4536
04:37:15,480 --> 04:37:17,480
We're going to upset these guards on purpose.

4537
04:37:17,480 --> 04:37:19,480
So we can... Ouch!

4538
04:37:19,480 --> 04:37:21,480
I didn't expect that.

4539
04:37:21,480 --> 04:37:23,480
Oh, geez!

4540
04:37:23,480 --> 04:37:25,480
Oh, my goodness.

4541
04:37:25,480 --> 04:37:27,480
I just got double whammy right off the bat.

4542
04:37:27,480 --> 04:37:29,480
Oh, my...

4543
04:37:29,480 --> 04:37:31,480
Okay, I need to take the big guy.

4544
04:37:31,480 --> 04:37:33,480
Thank you, big guy,

4545
04:37:33,480 --> 04:37:35,480
for perishing.

4546
04:37:35,480 --> 04:37:37,480
Can't handle you.

4547
04:37:37,480 --> 04:37:39,480
Okay, how about that?

4548
04:37:39,480 --> 04:37:41,480
Yeah, big...

4549
04:37:41,480 --> 04:37:43,480
Oh, we need one more.

4550
04:37:43,480 --> 04:37:45,480
Who's going to perish? You are going to perish.

4551
04:37:47,480 --> 04:37:49,480
See, the horses are getting stuck here.

4552
04:37:51,480 --> 04:37:53,480
I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.

4553
04:37:55,480 --> 04:37:57,480
I predict a riot.

4554
04:37:57,480 --> 04:37:59,480
Ooh, do you not want to go down there?

4555
04:37:59,480 --> 04:38:01,480
Because it's such a nightmare getting out there.

4556
04:38:01,480 --> 04:38:03,480
How many steps is that?

4557
04:38:07,480 --> 04:38:09,480
I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.

4558
04:38:09,480 --> 04:38:11,480
I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.

4559
04:38:11,480 --> 04:38:13,480
I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.

4560
04:38:13,480 --> 04:38:15,480
I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.

4561
04:38:17,480 --> 04:38:19,480
Oh, I'll most likely do

4562
04:38:19,480 --> 04:38:21,480
like a full playthrough of Itu's

4563
04:38:21,480 --> 04:38:23,480
storyline.

4564
04:38:23,480 --> 04:38:25,480
Where am I going?

4565
04:38:25,480 --> 04:38:27,480
Have you seen this?

4566
04:38:31,480 --> 04:38:33,480
Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.

4567
04:38:33,480 --> 04:38:35,480
Ooh!

4568
04:38:35,480 --> 04:38:37,480
Right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.

4569
04:38:45,480 --> 04:38:47,480
That's a lot of guards.

4570
04:38:49,480 --> 04:38:51,480
Hmm.

4571
04:38:51,480 --> 04:38:53,480
Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?

4572
04:38:55,480 --> 04:38:57,480
Wait, we're going to get you.

4573
04:39:01,480 --> 04:39:03,480
And then we're going to just

4574
04:39:03,480 --> 04:39:05,480
sneak up here and kill you.

4575
04:39:07,480 --> 04:39:09,480
Okay, I'll take that.

4576
04:39:09,480 --> 04:39:11,480
Do you guys need help?

4577
04:39:11,480 --> 04:39:13,480
I'll give you a second recruitment beam

4578
04:39:15,480 --> 04:39:17,480
and let you guys fight it out

4579
04:39:17,480 --> 04:39:19,480
and I'm going to climb up here

4580
04:39:19,480 --> 04:39:21,480
and do this.

4581
04:39:21,480 --> 04:39:23,480
Do we skip up here?

4582
04:39:23,480 --> 04:39:25,480
I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.

4583
04:39:25,480 --> 04:39:27,480
I absolutely suck at it.

4584
04:39:27,480 --> 04:39:29,480
I am so sorry.

4585
04:39:29,480 --> 04:39:31,480
I cannot do it.

4586
04:39:31,480 --> 04:39:33,480
I've tried Beyond Belief.

4587
04:39:33,480 --> 04:39:35,480
I ended up watching someone else play it

4588
04:39:35,480 --> 04:39:37,480
just so I know the storyline.

4589
04:39:37,480 --> 04:39:39,480
Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.

4590
04:39:43,480 --> 04:39:45,480
I probably...

4591
04:39:45,480 --> 04:39:47,480
No, I'm doing variety,

4592
04:39:47,480 --> 04:39:49,480
but what I'll probably do running up to October 10

4593
04:39:49,480 --> 04:39:51,480
is

4594
04:39:51,480 --> 04:39:53,480
I'll play

4595
04:39:53,480 --> 04:39:55,480
Assassin's Creed 2

4596
04:39:55,480 --> 04:39:57,480
before it, then October 10

4597
04:39:57,480 --> 04:39:59,480
play Brotherhood again

4598
04:39:59,480 --> 04:40:01,480
and then after play Revelations

4599
04:40:01,480 --> 04:40:03,480
and then we'll get the full Ezio story.

4600
04:40:07,480 --> 04:40:09,480
Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode

4601
04:40:09,480 --> 04:40:11,480
and then the enemies get like a free hit on you

4602
04:40:11,480 --> 04:40:13,480
because there's nothing you can do.

4603
04:40:15,480 --> 04:40:17,480
I mean, I know why it does it

4604
04:40:17,480 --> 04:40:19,480
because stuff and things, but...

4605
04:40:23,480 --> 04:40:25,480
We're level 4,

4606
04:40:25,480 --> 04:40:27,480
we're kind of getting a little bit decent.

4607
04:40:27,480 --> 04:40:29,480
It's not the best.

4608
04:40:29,480 --> 04:40:31,480
We're really not that strong.

4609
04:40:31,480 --> 04:40:33,480
I'm just plumping it all into armor

4610
04:40:33,480 --> 04:40:35,480
because I get so nervous for them.

4611
04:40:37,480 --> 04:40:39,480
I don't want to do a level 4.

4612
04:40:39,480 --> 04:40:41,480
Maybe a 3?

4613
04:40:41,480 --> 04:40:43,480
Send 2 on a level 3

4614
04:40:43,480 --> 04:40:45,480
XP, which is like 100 each.

4615
04:40:45,480 --> 04:40:47,480
Yeah...

4616
04:40:47,480 --> 04:40:49,480
Oh, a second one? Okay, we'll do that.

4617
04:40:51,480 --> 04:40:53,480
That's some old saying to get...

4618
04:40:53,480 --> 04:40:55,480
Oh, my tummy rumbled.

4619
04:40:55,480 --> 04:40:57,480
My tummy rumbled.

4620
04:40:57,480 --> 04:40:59,480
Make me to get some...

4621
04:40:59,480 --> 04:41:01,480
Oh, my tummy rumbled again.

4622
04:41:01,480 --> 04:41:03,480
I don't know if that's getting picked up in the make,

4623
04:41:03,480 --> 04:41:05,480
but I think I'm getting a bit peckish

4624
04:41:05,480 --> 04:41:07,480
for actual things.

4625
04:41:07,480 --> 04:41:09,480
You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.

4626
04:41:09,480 --> 04:41:11,480
Sometimes you need more.

4627
04:41:13,480 --> 04:41:15,480
But...

4628
04:41:15,480 --> 04:41:17,480
There's so many jokes I can make,

4629
04:41:17,480 --> 04:41:19,480
but they're too easy. I'm just going to leave it.

4630
04:41:19,480 --> 04:41:21,480
Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.

4631
04:41:23,480 --> 04:41:25,480
It's 9000 Florence!

4632
04:41:25,480 --> 04:41:27,480
Who has 9000 Florence?

4633
04:41:29,480 --> 04:41:31,480
Unreal.

4634
04:41:31,480 --> 04:41:33,480
Unreal Engine.

4635
04:41:33,480 --> 04:41:35,480
Who has 9000 Florence?

4636
04:41:35,480 --> 04:41:37,480
Not me.

4637
04:41:37,480 --> 04:41:39,480
Yeah, to me, say.

4638
04:41:39,480 --> 04:41:41,480
You know what they say?

4639
04:41:41,480 --> 04:41:43,480
I'm in the pink.

4640
04:41:43,480 --> 04:41:45,480
All in the stink.

4641
04:41:47,480 --> 04:41:49,480
Who has 9000?

4642
04:41:49,480 --> 04:41:51,480
Okay, we're going to get smoke bomb.

4643
04:41:51,480 --> 04:41:53,480
Excuse me, excuse me.

4644
04:41:53,480 --> 04:41:55,480
I want a smoke bomb pouch.

4645
04:41:55,480 --> 04:41:57,480
Smoke bomb pouch?

4646
04:41:57,480 --> 04:41:59,480
Smoke bomb pouch, yes.

4647
04:41:59,480 --> 04:42:01,480
No, not the knife bell.

4648
04:42:01,480 --> 04:42:03,480
Okay, we have smoke bombs almost.

4649
04:42:03,480 --> 04:42:05,480
We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.

4650
04:42:05,480 --> 04:42:07,480
Okay.

4651
04:42:09,480 --> 04:42:11,480
I can't believe...

4652
04:42:11,480 --> 04:42:13,480
I actually don't get enough of a cut

4653
04:42:13,480 --> 04:42:15,480
or a split that I can't even afford to...

4654
04:42:15,480 --> 04:42:17,480
Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.

4655
04:42:19,480 --> 04:42:21,480
Yes, I will help you.

4656
04:42:21,480 --> 04:42:23,480
No, let me help you.

4657
04:42:23,480 --> 04:42:25,480
Oh, it's a lady. Oh, my lady.

4658
04:42:25,480 --> 04:42:27,480
We actually need to

4659
04:42:27,480 --> 04:42:29,480
smoke bomb.

4660
04:42:29,480 --> 04:42:31,480
Because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.

4661
04:42:31,480 --> 04:42:33,480
For...

4662
04:42:33,480 --> 04:42:35,480
Why?

4663
04:42:35,480 --> 04:42:37,480
What?

4664
04:42:37,480 --> 04:42:39,480
Why do they just get aggressive on us?

4665
04:42:41,480 --> 04:42:43,480
Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.

4666
04:42:43,480 --> 04:42:45,480
Ace Marbuth.

4667
04:42:45,480 --> 04:42:47,480
Who said that?

4668
04:42:47,480 --> 04:42:49,480
Who said that?

4669
04:42:49,480 --> 04:42:51,480
Just put them on a warning.

4670
04:42:51,480 --> 04:42:53,480
Whoever insinuates that the Ace Marbuth

4671
04:42:53,480 --> 04:42:55,480
is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.

4672
04:42:55,480 --> 04:42:57,480
Put them on a warning.

4673
04:42:57,480 --> 04:42:59,480
Don't.

4674
04:42:59,480 --> 04:43:01,480
Teasing.

4675
04:43:03,480 --> 04:43:05,480
I'm teasing.

4676
04:43:05,480 --> 04:43:07,480
I actually think I might need to get...

4677
04:43:07,480 --> 04:43:09,480
I like, I never notice that I'm like hungry

4678
04:43:09,480 --> 04:43:11,480
or NTP and then as soon as I notice it,

4679
04:43:11,480 --> 04:43:13,480
I'm like, ah!

4680
04:43:13,480 --> 04:43:15,480
I'm perishing, I'm perishing.

4681
04:43:15,480 --> 04:43:17,480
Mods.

4682
04:43:17,480 --> 04:43:19,480
File this man's tax return.

4683
04:43:19,480 --> 04:43:21,480
Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...

4684
04:43:21,480 --> 04:43:23,480
I have a funny short coming out about

4685
04:43:23,480 --> 04:43:25,480
like what you can get taxed back

4686
04:43:25,480 --> 04:43:27,480
in a beach of our agency.

4687
04:43:27,480 --> 04:43:29,480
You know my Donut-Thon rewards?

4688
04:43:29,480 --> 04:43:31,480
One of them is going to be

4689
04:43:31,480 --> 04:43:33,480
a length chart.

4690
04:43:33,480 --> 04:43:35,480
I get to submit that

4691
04:43:35,480 --> 04:43:37,480
for tax back

4692
04:43:37,480 --> 04:43:39,480
because it's

4693
04:43:39,480 --> 04:43:41,480
what I needed to do

4694
04:43:41,480 --> 04:43:43,480
in order to operate.

4695
04:43:43,480 --> 04:43:45,480
Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.

4696
04:43:45,480 --> 04:43:47,480
Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get

4697
04:43:47,480 --> 04:43:49,480
the full price of it back in taxes.

4698
04:43:49,480 --> 04:43:51,480
No, it just means like...

4699
04:43:51,480 --> 04:43:53,480
It's like, okay,

4700
04:43:53,480 --> 04:43:55,480
you can get like two dollars back

4701
04:43:55,480 --> 04:43:57,480
on your tax return.

4702
04:43:57,480 --> 04:43:59,480
I appreciate it.

4703
04:43:59,480 --> 04:44:01,480
But like, yeah, you can get taxed back on models,

4704
04:44:01,480 --> 04:44:03,480
get taxed back on equipment,

4705
04:44:03,480 --> 04:44:05,480
get taxed back on internet,

4706
04:44:05,480 --> 04:44:07,480
get taxed back on...

4707
04:44:07,480 --> 04:44:09,480
rent as well, I get taxed back on.

4708
04:44:09,480 --> 04:44:11,480
Paying your tax

4709
04:44:11,480 --> 04:44:13,480
the stream.

4710
04:44:13,480 --> 04:44:15,480
Oh, I don't even want to think about

4711
04:44:15,480 --> 04:44:17,480
taxes, honestly.

4712
04:44:17,480 --> 04:44:19,480
Although it was pretty...

4713
04:44:19,480 --> 04:44:21,480
pretty...

4714
04:44:21,480 --> 04:44:23,480
Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to like

4715
04:44:23,480 --> 04:44:25,480
get the full thing back.

4716
04:44:25,480 --> 04:44:27,480
Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax

4717
04:44:27,480 --> 04:44:29,480
back,

4718
04:44:29,480 --> 04:44:31,480
it sounds like they mean

4719
04:44:31,480 --> 04:44:33,480
you get the full thing back, which is not the case at all.

4720
04:44:35,480 --> 04:44:37,480
Everything is a business, right?

4721
04:44:37,480 --> 04:44:39,480
If you can justify it

4722
04:44:39,480 --> 04:44:41,480
100%

4723
04:44:41,480 --> 04:44:43,480
because I can imagine a vealer

4724
04:44:43,480 --> 04:44:45,480
got audited and I have to go like,

4725
04:44:45,480 --> 04:44:47,480
oh yeah, you know this special artwork

4726
04:44:47,480 --> 04:44:49,480
that was part of the business

4727
04:44:49,480 --> 04:44:51,480
because we're an entertainment business.

4728
04:44:51,480 --> 04:44:53,480
It would be hilarious.

4729
04:44:53,480 --> 04:44:55,480
ASMR girl Iris

4730
04:44:55,480 --> 04:44:57,480
Agent

4731
04:44:57,480 --> 04:44:59,480
interrogates you.

4732
04:44:59,480 --> 04:45:01,480
Wait, what am I doing?

4733
04:45:01,480 --> 04:45:03,480
Oh, right in the balls.

4734
04:45:03,480 --> 04:45:05,480
Wait, why did...

4735
04:45:05,480 --> 04:45:07,480
Oh, did I just

4736
04:45:07,480 --> 04:45:09,480
freak? Oh my god.

4737
04:45:09,480 --> 04:45:11,480
I'm sorry, I really just

4738
04:45:11,480 --> 04:45:13,480
like the last men.

4739
04:45:13,480 --> 04:45:15,480
Small

4740
04:45:15,480 --> 04:45:17,480
poles only, please, my goodness.

4741
04:45:17,480 --> 04:45:19,480
They're so hard to defeat.

4742
04:45:19,480 --> 04:45:21,480
The company

4743
04:45:21,480 --> 04:45:23,480
has an account and does everything legally.

4744
04:45:23,480 --> 04:45:25,480
Okay, dude.

4745
04:45:27,480 --> 04:45:29,480
Management. Actually, there's an account

4746
04:45:29,480 --> 04:45:31,480
and that's true.

4747
04:45:33,480 --> 04:45:35,480
Small poles only, so ogre.

4748
04:45:37,480 --> 04:45:39,480
Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.

4749
04:45:39,480 --> 04:45:41,480
That's for our later stream.

4750
04:45:43,480 --> 04:45:45,480
You tell it in like raw 4k detail

4751
04:45:45,480 --> 04:45:47,480
about the walkers.

4752
04:45:55,480 --> 04:45:57,480
Right, what am I supposed to do?

4753
04:45:57,480 --> 04:45:59,480
Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.

4754
04:45:59,480 --> 04:46:01,480
Okay, he's about to activate this next

4755
04:46:01,480 --> 04:46:03,480
thing.

4756
04:46:03,480 --> 04:46:05,480
I am now to perish the guards

4757
04:46:05,480 --> 04:46:07,480
of my own deck guild.

4758
04:46:07,480 --> 04:46:09,480
So this guy

4759
04:46:09,480 --> 04:46:11,480
can go first

4760
04:46:11,480 --> 04:46:13,480
and

4761
04:46:13,480 --> 04:46:15,480
then I can do

4762
04:46:15,480 --> 04:46:17,480
you.

4763
04:46:17,480 --> 04:46:19,480
And then, last but not least,

4764
04:46:19,480 --> 04:46:21,480
I can do you.

4765
04:46:21,480 --> 04:46:23,480
No.

4766
04:46:23,480 --> 04:46:25,480
Don't be silly,

4767
04:46:25,480 --> 04:46:27,480
it's your

4768
04:46:27,480 --> 04:46:29,480
aim on the guard, my goodness.

4769
04:46:29,480 --> 04:46:31,480
By the way, this came

4770
04:46:31,480 --> 04:46:33,480
deaf. What?

4771
04:46:33,480 --> 04:46:35,480
Hello?

4772
04:46:37,480 --> 04:46:39,480
Hello?

4773
04:46:39,480 --> 04:46:41,480
I got desynchronized, but I did

4774
04:46:41,480 --> 04:46:43,480
what you asked.

4775
04:46:43,480 --> 04:46:45,480
I did everything right

4776
04:46:45,480 --> 04:46:47,480
and I still lost.

4777
04:46:47,480 --> 04:46:49,480
Wait.

4778
04:46:49,480 --> 04:46:51,480
This isn't the original checkpoint.

4779
04:46:51,480 --> 04:46:53,480
We still, wait, we hit the checkpoint

4780
04:46:53,480 --> 04:46:55,480
and it let us go through.

4781
04:46:59,480 --> 04:47:01,480
Okay, okay, I'll take it.

4782
04:47:05,480 --> 04:47:07,480
Okay, next

4783
04:47:07,480 --> 04:47:09,480
guard checkpoint.

4784
04:47:09,480 --> 04:47:11,480
One to our left.

4785
04:47:11,480 --> 04:47:13,480
I might go kill him the new.

4786
04:47:13,480 --> 04:47:15,480
Good day to you.

4787
04:47:15,480 --> 04:47:17,480
Please stop walking.

4788
04:47:17,480 --> 04:47:19,480
Thank you.

4789
04:47:19,480 --> 04:47:21,480
Okay, there's a second guard

4790
04:47:21,480 --> 04:47:23,480
there.

4791
04:47:23,480 --> 04:47:25,480
I really want to get

4792
04:47:27,480 --> 04:47:29,480
I need them to

4793
04:47:29,480 --> 04:47:31,480
split up.

4794
04:47:31,480 --> 04:47:33,480
Focus, focus, there's a pizza on your

4795
04:47:33,480 --> 04:47:35,480
focus.

4796
04:47:35,480 --> 04:47:37,480
I

4797
04:47:37,480 --> 04:47:39,480
was too

4798
04:47:39,480 --> 04:47:41,480
in range. If I can time this right,

4799
04:47:41,480 --> 04:47:43,480
I'm not going to desync.

4800
04:47:43,480 --> 04:47:45,480
I did it.

4801
04:47:45,480 --> 04:47:47,480
Did you see that though? The AI

4802
04:47:47,480 --> 04:47:49,480
looked at me. Oh my goodness, right?

4803
04:47:49,480 --> 04:47:51,480
What way are you going Bartolomeo?

4804
04:47:51,480 --> 04:47:53,480
You're going this way.

4805
04:47:53,480 --> 04:47:55,480
That was the way.

4806
04:47:59,480 --> 04:48:01,480
I'm French.

4807
04:48:01,480 --> 04:48:03,480
I'm French.

4808
04:48:03,480 --> 04:48:05,480
I'm French.

4809
04:48:05,480 --> 04:48:07,480
I'm French.

4810
04:48:07,480 --> 04:48:09,480
I'm French.

4811
04:48:09,480 --> 04:48:11,480
I'm French.

4812
04:48:11,480 --> 04:48:13,480
I'm not Italian or an assassin.

4813
04:48:17,480 --> 04:48:19,480
I don't know how.

4814
04:48:19,480 --> 04:48:21,480
We didn't get desync to do in that

4815
04:48:21,480 --> 04:48:23,480
but we made it.

4816
04:48:23,480 --> 04:48:25,480
Right, we've got a guard on the

4817
04:48:25,480 --> 04:48:27,480
outside here.

4818
04:48:27,480 --> 04:48:29,480
I actually don't remember this part a lot.

4819
04:48:29,480 --> 04:48:31,480
You,

4820
04:48:31,480 --> 04:48:33,480
I've got two guards next to each other.

4821
04:48:33,480 --> 04:48:35,480
I don't like

4822
04:48:35,480 --> 04:48:37,480
Oh, he's coming this way.

4823
04:48:37,480 --> 04:48:39,480
Oh, there's a dead body.

4824
04:48:43,480 --> 04:48:45,480
It's fine.

4825
04:48:45,480 --> 04:48:47,480
Oh no, he's gone for the dead body.

4826
04:48:47,480 --> 04:48:49,480
I didn't think that through.

4827
04:48:49,480 --> 04:48:51,480
That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.

4828
04:48:51,480 --> 04:48:53,480
Phew, we did it.

4829
04:48:53,480 --> 04:48:55,480
The hard part is over.

4830
04:48:55,480 --> 04:48:57,480
Now it's for the easy part.

4831
04:48:57,480 --> 04:48:59,480
So we just walk up to this gate

4832
04:48:59,480 --> 04:49:01,480
and then we get to learn how French

4833
04:49:01,480 --> 04:49:03,480
people say Italian dog

4834
04:49:03,480 --> 04:49:05,480
which is

4835
04:49:05,480 --> 04:49:07,480
Italian.

4836
04:49:07,480 --> 04:49:09,480
Are you going to have any European

4837
04:49:09,480 --> 04:49:11,480
friendly streams?

4838
04:49:13,480 --> 04:49:15,480
Like, you mean

4839
04:49:15,480 --> 04:49:17,480
starting earlier than the time I stream

4840
04:49:17,480 --> 04:49:19,480
right now?

4841
04:49:21,480 --> 04:49:23,480
This is probably going to be

4842
04:49:23,480 --> 04:49:25,480
my stream start time until

4843
04:49:25,480 --> 04:49:27,480
Daylight savings

4844
04:49:27,480 --> 04:49:29,480
kicks in for some places.

4845
04:49:31,480 --> 04:49:33,480
Which part of France

4846
04:49:33,480 --> 04:49:35,480
are you from?

4847
04:49:51,480 --> 04:49:53,480
It's EU friendly.

4848
04:49:53,480 --> 04:49:55,480
It's 8pm.

4849
04:49:55,480 --> 04:49:57,480
It's a bit late if you're like

4850
04:49:57,480 --> 04:49:59,480
German ahead one.

4851
04:50:03,480 --> 04:50:05,480
Is this a European friendly stream?

4852
04:50:05,480 --> 04:50:07,480
Do we not like them?

4853
04:50:07,480 --> 04:50:09,480
No, we do. It's just time zones.

4854
04:50:09,480 --> 04:50:11,480
It's 4am when I start streaming.

4855
04:50:11,480 --> 04:50:13,480
So,

4856
04:50:13,480 --> 04:50:15,480
I'm trying my best.

4857
04:50:15,480 --> 04:50:17,480
But I'm an endurance streamer so

4858
04:50:17,480 --> 04:50:19,480
I do hit a lot of time zones.

4859
04:50:19,480 --> 04:50:21,480
And it's unlikely

4860
04:50:21,480 --> 04:50:23,480
that reeflings have

4861
04:50:23,480 --> 04:50:25,480
8 hours to set through

4862
04:50:25,480 --> 04:50:27,480
an entire stream.

4863
04:50:27,480 --> 04:50:29,480
Maybe if you work from home

4864
04:50:29,480 --> 04:50:31,480
or you're listening at work

4865
04:50:31,480 --> 04:50:33,480
but it's a bit dangerous listening at work

4866
04:50:33,480 --> 04:50:35,480
because sometimes I tease a lot.

4867
04:50:35,480 --> 04:50:37,480
Especially in ASMR streams

4868
04:50:37,480 --> 04:50:39,480
I tease quite a lot.

4869
04:50:39,480 --> 04:50:41,480
This is me just having

4870
04:50:41,480 --> 04:50:43,480
a really good time.

4871
04:50:43,480 --> 04:50:45,480
So, I'm pretty tame right now from Brotherhood.

4872
04:50:45,480 --> 04:50:47,480
Yeah.

4873
04:50:47,480 --> 04:50:49,480
If you live in Turkaya

4874
04:50:51,480 --> 04:50:53,480
Arcadijim

4875
04:50:53,480 --> 04:50:55,480
means friend

4876
04:50:55,480 --> 04:50:57,480
and

4877
04:50:57,480 --> 04:50:59,480
Turkay.

4878
04:50:59,480 --> 04:51:01,480
I think.

4879
04:51:05,480 --> 04:51:07,480
Arcadij.

4880
04:51:11,480 --> 04:51:13,480
I work from home

4881
04:51:13,480 --> 04:51:15,480
and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.

4882
04:51:15,480 --> 04:51:17,480
So,

4883
04:51:17,480 --> 04:51:19,480
I'm definitely going to be...

4884
04:51:19,480 --> 04:51:21,480
How can you focus on work and listening at the same time though?

4885
04:51:21,480 --> 04:51:23,480
I feel like I could...

4886
04:51:23,480 --> 04:51:25,480
Unless it's like background noise.

4887
04:51:25,480 --> 04:51:27,480
Arcadijim.

4888
04:51:27,480 --> 04:51:29,480
I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations

4889
04:51:29,480 --> 04:51:31,480
because it's set in Turkey.

4890
04:51:31,480 --> 04:51:33,480
Never learn.

4891
04:51:33,480 --> 04:51:35,480
Pfft.

4892
04:51:41,480 --> 04:51:43,480
These guys are like the hardest enemies you can kind of get.

4893
04:51:43,480 --> 04:51:45,480
But if you just jump at them

4894
04:51:45,480 --> 04:51:47,480
you can get away with it.

4895
04:51:47,480 --> 04:51:49,480
Oh yeah, you just got to break their stance

4896
04:51:49,480 --> 04:51:51,480
and just look that down.

4897
04:51:51,480 --> 04:51:53,480
That's back to me.

4898
04:51:53,480 --> 04:51:55,480
The trick is, I don't really work.

4899
04:51:55,480 --> 04:51:57,480
So, this cutscene

4900
04:51:57,480 --> 04:51:59,480
is a glitch that was never patched out.

4901
04:51:59,480 --> 04:52:01,480
This is a full edited cutscene

4902
04:52:01,480 --> 04:52:03,480
where he like, go get my wife.

4903
04:52:03,480 --> 04:52:05,480
It never loads.

4904
04:52:05,480 --> 04:52:07,480
It will never load in time.

4905
04:52:07,480 --> 04:52:09,480
I have no idea what it looks like.

4906
04:52:09,480 --> 04:52:11,480
Well, I assume it looks like him

4907
04:52:11,480 --> 04:52:13,480
screaming at you

4908
04:52:13,480 --> 04:52:15,480
and then he gets his sword and goes off screen.

4909
04:52:15,480 --> 04:52:17,480
It will never load.

4910
04:52:17,480 --> 04:52:19,480
It doesn't matter what you do, it never loads.

4911
04:52:19,480 --> 04:52:21,480
Unless like maybe someone went into the game data

4912
04:52:21,480 --> 04:52:23,480
and like I went into free camera

4913
04:52:23,480 --> 04:52:25,480
possibly

4914
04:52:25,480 --> 04:52:27,480
and then you could definitely do it.

4915
04:52:27,480 --> 04:52:29,480
I said small poles only!

4916
04:52:31,480 --> 04:52:33,480
We don't want them being...

4917
04:52:33,480 --> 04:52:35,480
No! You've ruined my screen!

4918
04:52:37,480 --> 04:52:39,480
Okay, we did it though.

4919
04:52:39,480 --> 04:52:41,480
It's fine.

4920
04:52:41,480 --> 04:52:43,480
Can I open the gate please?

4921
04:52:43,480 --> 04:52:45,480
Become anonymous to open the gate.

4922
04:52:45,480 --> 04:52:47,480
There's no one attacking me.

4923
04:52:49,480 --> 04:52:51,480
There's no one attacking me.

4924
04:52:51,480 --> 04:52:53,480
Right, that's what I thought.

4925
04:52:53,480 --> 04:52:55,480
I was going to say, there's literally no one attacking me.

4926
04:52:57,480 --> 04:52:59,480
You underwaste my lack of shame.

4927
04:52:59,480 --> 04:53:01,480
I'm pretty sick of stuff that worked before.

4928
04:53:03,480 --> 04:53:05,480
Honestly, whatever helps pass the time

4929
04:53:05,480 --> 04:53:07,480
like I'm sorry but work can be so mundane.

4930
04:53:07,480 --> 04:53:09,480
Like the best work days

4931
04:53:09,480 --> 04:53:11,480
are the times where you're super busy

4932
04:53:11,480 --> 04:53:13,480
because you blink and it's the end of the day

4933
04:53:13,480 --> 04:53:15,480
but you are shattered, that's the only problem

4934
04:53:15,480 --> 04:53:17,480
like you're absolutely exhausted

4935
04:53:17,480 --> 04:53:19,480
and it's really...

4936
04:53:19,480 --> 04:53:21,480
So you're actually

4937
04:53:21,480 --> 04:53:23,480
on a timer in this section

4938
04:53:23,480 --> 04:53:25,480
and I only have six crossbow bolts

4939
04:53:25,480 --> 04:53:27,480
which I do not like at all right now.

4940
04:53:27,480 --> 04:53:29,480
Um...

4941
04:53:29,480 --> 04:53:31,480
You can.

4942
04:53:31,480 --> 04:53:33,480
I might mess up the sequence.

4943
04:53:33,480 --> 04:53:35,480
I do it quite a lot.

4944
04:53:35,480 --> 04:53:37,480
Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back!

4945
04:53:43,480 --> 04:53:45,480
Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it.

4946
04:53:45,480 --> 04:53:47,480
You need to air assassinate him for 100%.

4947
04:53:49,480 --> 04:53:51,480
Hold on.

4948
04:53:53,480 --> 04:53:55,480
You have no clue how many arrows I need to kill in the day.

4949
04:53:57,480 --> 04:53:59,480
I'm respected.

4950
04:54:01,480 --> 04:54:03,480
Yeah, I'm straight respected and not purchased.

4951
04:54:11,480 --> 04:54:13,480
Oh, you should probably go to sleep

4952
04:54:13,480 --> 04:54:15,480
if you need to be up in six hours.

4953
04:54:15,480 --> 04:54:17,480
It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.

4954
04:54:17,480 --> 04:54:19,480
Digi, no!

4955
04:54:19,480 --> 04:54:21,480
Men need eight hours of sleep

4956
04:54:21,480 --> 04:54:23,480
where women typically need ten hours of sleep.

4957
04:54:23,480 --> 04:54:25,480
But yeah,

4958
04:54:25,480 --> 04:54:27,480
actually, don't risk your health.

4959
04:54:29,480 --> 04:54:31,480
Sir Shameless, they call me.

4960
04:54:33,480 --> 04:54:35,480
I'll be honest, all your girls

4961
04:54:35,480 --> 04:54:37,480
make my work day go by real quick.

4962
04:54:37,480 --> 04:54:39,480
It's lovely.

4963
04:54:39,480 --> 04:54:41,480
That's amazing to hear.

4964
04:54:41,480 --> 04:54:43,480
A.P. Gall confirmed the Lord.

4965
04:54:45,480 --> 04:54:47,480
What is sleep?

4966
04:54:47,480 --> 04:54:49,480
Baby, don't stream more.

4967
04:54:49,480 --> 04:54:51,480
Don't stream more.

4968
04:54:51,480 --> 04:54:53,480
No more.

4969
04:54:53,480 --> 04:54:55,480
What is sleep?

4970
04:54:55,480 --> 04:54:57,480
Streamer.

4971
04:54:57,480 --> 04:54:59,480
Oh my god, a VTuber streamer parody of that song.

4972
04:54:59,480 --> 04:55:01,480
Let's go.

4973
04:55:03,480 --> 04:55:05,480
Okay.

4974
04:55:05,480 --> 04:55:07,480
Then you can collect both of these chests

4975
04:55:07,480 --> 04:55:09,480
if you're fast enough

4976
04:55:09,480 --> 04:55:11,480
whilst it's telling you this act is over.

4977
04:55:11,480 --> 04:55:13,480
I swear they purposely did this

4978
04:55:13,480 --> 04:55:15,480
because no other act takes so long

4979
04:55:15,480 --> 04:55:17,480
to complete the sequence six.

4980
04:55:17,480 --> 04:55:19,480
Like the ending bit to tell you it's over.

4981
04:55:19,480 --> 04:55:21,480
I decided a long time to destroy

4982
04:55:21,480 --> 04:55:23,480
my sleep schedule.

4983
04:55:23,480 --> 04:55:25,480
Practically, gal.

4984
04:55:27,480 --> 04:55:29,480
Excuse me.

4985
04:55:29,480 --> 04:55:31,480
Forget Pali.

4986
04:55:37,480 --> 04:55:39,480
Worth it, feels good.

4987
04:55:41,480 --> 04:55:43,480
Sleep, what is that?

4988
04:55:43,480 --> 04:55:45,480
Oh, she caught me.

4989
04:55:45,480 --> 04:55:47,480
If I can remember this sequence,

4990
04:55:47,480 --> 04:55:49,480
we might have to

4991
04:55:49,480 --> 04:55:51,480
do...

4992
04:55:51,480 --> 04:55:53,480
Oh, that reminds me.

4993
04:55:53,480 --> 04:55:55,480
There's actually a thieves challenge

4994
04:55:55,480 --> 04:55:57,480
which is to dive

4995
04:55:57,480 --> 04:55:59,480
200 meters, which you can do

4996
04:55:59,480 --> 04:56:01,480
off the top of this building.

4997
04:56:01,480 --> 04:56:03,480
So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.

4998
04:56:03,480 --> 04:56:05,480
Ready, steady,

4999
04:56:05,480 --> 04:56:07,480
whee!

5000
04:56:07,480 --> 04:56:09,480
There we go.

5001
04:56:09,480 --> 04:56:11,480
That's a thieves challenge done right there.

5002
04:56:11,480 --> 04:56:13,480
Dive complete.

5003
04:56:13,480 --> 04:56:15,480
Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves.

5004
04:56:15,480 --> 04:56:17,480
Fantastic.

5005
04:56:17,480 --> 04:56:19,480
I enjoy that.

5006
04:56:19,480 --> 04:56:21,480
I need to level them up a bit more before they pick pocket

5007
04:56:21,480 --> 04:56:23,480
but we're getting close to the point where we don't

5008
04:56:23,480 --> 04:56:25,480
like

5009
04:56:25,480 --> 04:56:27,480
mula like that. Where'd any go on the map?

5010
04:56:27,480 --> 04:56:29,480
Where are we?

5011
04:56:29,480 --> 04:56:31,480
What's our heading?

5012
04:56:31,480 --> 04:56:33,480
Okay, we've liberated

5013
04:56:33,480 --> 04:56:35,480
that Borgia zone which is fantastic.

5014
04:56:35,480 --> 04:56:37,480
Where's the mission?

5015
04:56:37,480 --> 04:56:39,480
Is it south?

5016
04:56:39,480 --> 04:56:41,480
The mission's in the thieves guild

5017
04:56:41,480 --> 04:56:43,480
which doesn't have a Borgia place

5018
04:56:43,480 --> 04:56:45,480
on the way but we'll start

5019
04:56:45,480 --> 04:56:47,480
trying to get all the Borgia towers.

5020
04:56:47,480 --> 04:56:49,480
I'm just going to use the old

5021
04:56:49,480 --> 04:56:51,480
teleport feature.

5022
04:56:53,480 --> 04:56:55,480
Yeah, yeah.

5023
04:56:55,480 --> 04:56:57,480
And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way

5024
04:56:57,480 --> 04:56:59,480
to get leveled up a bit more.

5025
04:56:59,480 --> 04:57:01,480
Watching your streams of high level.

5026
04:57:01,480 --> 04:57:03,480
Can you stop that?

5027
04:57:03,480 --> 04:57:05,480
Try and make me blush.

5028
04:57:05,480 --> 04:57:07,480
I literally just memed my bot off

5029
04:57:07,480 --> 04:57:09,480
playing a really good game.

5030
04:57:09,480 --> 04:57:11,480
Okay, we've got level 5

5031
04:57:11,480 --> 04:57:13,480
so we're starting to get a bit...

5032
04:57:13,480 --> 04:57:15,480
weapons now just so they have a few

5033
04:57:15,480 --> 04:57:17,480
more things.

5034
04:57:17,480 --> 04:57:19,480
We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third

5035
04:57:19,480 --> 04:57:21,480
signal.

5036
04:57:21,480 --> 04:57:23,480
Can I send you guys?

5037
04:57:27,480 --> 04:57:29,480
I'm going to send everyone

5038
04:57:29,480 --> 04:57:31,480
for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.

5039
04:57:33,480 --> 04:57:35,480
Like to get them really levelled up from the start.

5040
04:57:35,480 --> 04:57:37,480
So if they do end up in a fight

5041
04:57:37,480 --> 04:57:39,480
it's not a problem.

5042
04:57:39,480 --> 04:57:41,480
Is it working?

5043
04:57:41,480 --> 04:57:43,480
Yes.

5044
04:57:43,480 --> 04:57:45,480
Have you been killing people

5045
04:57:45,480 --> 04:57:47,480
with your horse?

5046
04:57:47,480 --> 04:57:49,480
Maybe they do.

5047
04:57:49,480 --> 04:57:51,480
No.

5048
04:57:51,480 --> 04:57:53,480
No.

5049
04:57:53,480 --> 04:57:55,480
They're not buying it.

5050
04:57:55,480 --> 04:57:57,480
He's like...

5051
04:57:57,480 --> 04:57:59,480
He's out there.

5052
04:57:59,480 --> 04:58:01,480
He looks like the...

5053
04:58:01,480 --> 04:58:03,480
Oh no, the words aren't working

5054
04:58:03,480 --> 04:58:05,480
in my head.

5055
04:58:05,480 --> 04:58:07,480
Please don't shoot me.

5056
04:58:07,480 --> 04:58:09,480
He looks up and

5057
04:58:09,480 --> 04:58:11,480
he remembers.

5058
04:58:11,480 --> 04:58:13,480
Ooh, I love birds.

5059
04:58:13,480 --> 04:58:15,480
Not at the bird and

5060
04:58:15,480 --> 04:58:17,480
people die everywhere.

5061
04:58:17,480 --> 04:58:19,480
People die.

5062
04:58:21,480 --> 04:58:23,480
I don't know the words.

5063
04:58:23,480 --> 04:58:25,480
But like I know the tune and everything.

5064
04:58:25,480 --> 04:58:27,480
Mmm.

5065
04:58:29,480 --> 04:58:31,480
What's Johnny means?

5066
04:58:31,480 --> 04:58:33,480
The most important meal of the day.

5067
04:58:37,480 --> 04:58:39,480
Mmm.

5068
04:58:39,480 --> 04:58:41,480
Mmm.

5069
04:58:41,480 --> 04:58:43,480
We're going to not grab that thief

5070
04:58:43,480 --> 04:58:45,480
because he's already claimed the wall.

5071
04:58:45,480 --> 04:58:47,480
I never chase thieves.

5072
04:58:47,480 --> 04:58:49,480
If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.

5073
04:58:49,480 --> 04:58:51,480
I absolutely cannot be bothered.

5074
04:58:51,480 --> 04:58:53,480
That's probably the only thing in this game

5075
04:58:53,480 --> 04:58:55,480
that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.

5076
04:58:55,480 --> 04:58:57,480
It's just like if you wanted to pocket the money

5077
04:58:57,480 --> 04:58:59,480
and whatever item is on their persons.

5078
04:59:01,480 --> 04:59:03,480
What am I doing?

5079
04:59:03,480 --> 04:59:05,480
What?

5080
04:59:05,480 --> 04:59:07,480
You guys want to do kegels together?

5081
04:59:07,480 --> 04:59:09,480
Are you ready?

5082
04:59:09,480 --> 04:59:11,480
Hold for three seconds.

5083
04:59:11,480 --> 04:59:13,480
One, two, three, release.

5084
04:59:13,480 --> 04:59:15,480
You know what?

5085
04:59:15,480 --> 04:59:17,480
You know what I learned about guys?

5086
04:59:17,480 --> 04:59:19,480
I learned this a while ago.

5087
04:59:19,480 --> 04:59:21,480
If a guy wants to jump start

5088
04:59:21,480 --> 04:59:23,480
his Eiffel Tower, he has to close

5089
04:59:23,480 --> 04:59:25,480
his end.

5090
04:59:25,480 --> 04:59:27,480
Which is crazy.

5091
04:59:27,480 --> 04:59:29,480
A little twitch there.

5092
04:59:29,480 --> 04:59:31,480
A little twitch there.

5093
04:59:31,480 --> 04:59:33,480
A little twitch there I guess.

5094
04:59:33,480 --> 04:59:35,480
Crazy lore for guys.

5095
04:59:35,480 --> 04:59:37,480
Absolutely crazy lore.

5096
04:59:37,480 --> 04:59:39,480
I don't know

5097
04:59:39,480 --> 04:59:41,480
if I was too generic with that.

5098
04:59:41,480 --> 04:59:43,480
In order to

5099
04:59:43,480 --> 04:59:45,480
achieve sword art.

5100
04:59:47,480 --> 04:59:49,480
Oh, and also

5101
04:59:49,480 --> 04:59:51,480
when you go to the toilet,

5102
04:59:51,480 --> 04:59:53,480
you're a poor little...

5103
04:59:57,480 --> 04:59:59,480
What do we call them?

5104
04:59:59,480 --> 05:00:01,480
You're a poor little...

5105
05:00:01,480 --> 05:00:03,480
I don't know

5106
05:00:03,480 --> 05:00:05,480
double eyeballs can touch

5107
05:00:05,480 --> 05:00:07,480
the toilet and it's super cold

5108
05:00:07,480 --> 05:00:09,480
and uncomfortable.

5109
05:00:09,480 --> 05:00:11,480
I only learned that super recently

5110
05:00:11,480 --> 05:00:13,480
because I saw a meme about it and I was like

5111
05:00:13,480 --> 05:00:15,480
wait what?

5112
05:00:15,480 --> 05:00:17,480
You're a poor little guy.

5113
05:00:17,480 --> 05:00:19,480
They're going to retract

5114
05:00:19,480 --> 05:00:21,480
and save you. They get too cold.

5115
05:00:21,480 --> 05:00:23,480
They're going to go straight back

5116
05:00:23,480 --> 05:00:25,480
up to your belly button. No!

5117
05:00:27,480 --> 05:00:29,480
Kill all the attackers.

5118
05:00:29,480 --> 05:00:31,480
Sure, sure, sure.

5119
05:00:37,480 --> 05:00:39,480
Wait, why are we in this? Oh, it's a fight.

5120
05:00:39,480 --> 05:00:41,480
It's a fight. And I just sent

5121
05:00:41,480 --> 05:00:43,480
all my assassins away.

5122
05:00:43,480 --> 05:00:45,480
Wait, who's the...

5123
05:00:47,480 --> 05:00:49,480
Wrong guy.

5124
05:00:49,480 --> 05:00:51,480
Wrong guy. You're hurting the wrong guy.

5125
05:00:53,480 --> 05:00:55,480
Where are the enemies?

5126
05:00:55,480 --> 05:00:57,480
Got an enemy.

5127
05:00:57,480 --> 05:00:59,480
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

5128
05:00:59,480 --> 05:01:01,480
Enema, give them an enema.

5129
05:01:03,480 --> 05:01:05,480
Do not give them an enema.

5130
05:01:05,480 --> 05:01:07,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5131
05:01:07,480 --> 05:01:09,480
Whoa! That was so cool

5132
05:01:09,480 --> 05:01:11,480
that attack. The double splash over.

5133
05:01:11,480 --> 05:01:13,480
I really enjoyed that.

5134
05:01:19,480 --> 05:01:21,480
What? What? Where did that come from?

5135
05:01:21,480 --> 05:01:23,480
Eh, eh.

5136
05:01:25,480 --> 05:01:27,480
Go away.

5137
05:01:27,480 --> 05:01:29,480
They scare me. That's a renise.

5138
05:01:29,480 --> 05:01:31,480
Bad boy, bad boy.

5139
05:01:31,480 --> 05:01:33,480
Bad boy, bad boy.

5140
05:01:33,480 --> 05:01:35,480
Bad boy.

5141
05:01:35,480 --> 05:01:37,480
Oh, it missed.

5142
05:01:41,480 --> 05:01:43,480
Okay, let's get this big guard.

5143
05:01:43,480 --> 05:01:45,480
Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.

5144
05:01:45,480 --> 05:01:47,480
I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.

5145
05:01:47,480 --> 05:01:49,480
I think I'm going to have to get food and refill

5146
05:01:49,480 --> 05:01:51,480
in a second because I'm starting to

5147
05:01:51,480 --> 05:01:53,480
get a little bit delirious.

5148
05:01:53,480 --> 05:01:55,480
I'm going to get some egg

5149
05:01:55,480 --> 05:01:57,480
and I think I'll go ravioli.

5150
05:01:57,480 --> 05:01:59,480
Yeah.

5151
05:01:59,480 --> 05:02:01,480
Maybe a wee bit longer.

5152
05:02:01,480 --> 05:02:03,480
Maybe a three minute break.

5153
05:02:03,480 --> 05:02:05,480
Three whole minutes away from stream. I cannot believe it.

5154
05:02:05,480 --> 05:02:07,480
I cannot believe it. Absolutely unprofessional.

5155
05:02:07,480 --> 05:02:09,480
Unacceptable.

5156
05:02:11,480 --> 05:02:13,480
Oh, that makes sense.

5157
05:02:15,480 --> 05:02:17,480
Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed

5158
05:02:17,480 --> 05:02:19,480
and Brotherhood does really

5159
05:02:19,480 --> 05:02:21,480
quite work for the timing of the song.

5160
05:02:21,480 --> 05:02:23,480
She hates us now.

5161
05:02:25,480 --> 05:02:27,480
Hello.

5162
05:02:27,480 --> 05:02:29,480
How many hours?

5163
05:02:29,480 --> 05:02:31,480
Five hours? Oh, it's been five hours already.

5164
05:02:31,480 --> 05:02:33,480
I've been gushing about this game.

5165
05:02:33,480 --> 05:02:35,480
You know what, Reeflings?

5166
05:02:35,480 --> 05:02:37,480
Life's good.

5167
05:02:37,480 --> 05:02:39,480
Full stop. Life is good.

5168
05:02:41,480 --> 05:02:43,480
Got to do my thing.

5169
05:02:43,480 --> 05:02:45,480
We having a good time mimin' along.

5170
05:02:45,480 --> 05:02:47,480
I'm rambling away about any old shite

5171
05:02:47,480 --> 05:02:49,480
that passes my brain.

5172
05:02:49,480 --> 05:02:51,480
Life is good.

5173
05:02:53,480 --> 05:02:55,480
We're about to go get some juice.

5174
05:02:55,480 --> 05:02:57,480
I think I'll make a tea.

5175
05:02:57,480 --> 05:02:59,480
Yeah, I'll make a tea.

5176
05:02:59,480 --> 05:03:01,480
You'll get some food.

5177
05:03:01,480 --> 05:03:03,480
Maybe some snacky too.

5178
05:03:03,480 --> 05:03:05,480
I don't think I need to pee.

5179
05:03:05,480 --> 05:03:07,480
No pee yet.

5180
05:03:09,480 --> 05:03:11,480
Actually, I should probably get up so I'm not that far behind him

5181
05:03:11,480 --> 05:03:13,480
because he is like so far ahead of me.

5182
05:03:15,480 --> 05:03:17,480
Oh no!

5183
05:03:17,480 --> 05:03:19,480
I think he has perished.

5184
05:03:19,480 --> 05:03:21,480
But thieves are ours.

5185
05:03:21,480 --> 05:03:23,480
Yunkers, you're mine now.

5186
05:03:25,480 --> 05:03:27,480
They are...

5187
05:03:27,480 --> 05:03:29,480
I...

5188
05:03:29,480 --> 05:03:31,480
I don't really want to kick him to death.

5189
05:03:31,480 --> 05:03:33,480
Make it quick. See, don't make him suffer.

5190
05:03:33,480 --> 05:03:35,480
My goodness.

5191
05:03:35,480 --> 05:03:37,480
It's a bit morbid.

5192
05:03:37,480 --> 05:03:39,480
I think I'd rather make it quick

5193
05:03:39,480 --> 05:03:41,480
and painless, not drag it out.

5194
05:03:41,480 --> 05:03:43,480
Oh, he got the horse! How did he do that?

5195
05:03:43,480 --> 05:03:45,480
I don't know how he did that,

5196
05:03:45,480 --> 05:03:47,480
but do it again.

5197
05:03:47,480 --> 05:03:49,480
It looked like he did it with sort of.

5198
05:03:53,480 --> 05:03:55,480
Well, it's 1am, so I'll take my leave.

5199
05:03:55,480 --> 05:03:57,480
Please, rest well. Anyone who does have to rest

5200
05:03:57,480 --> 05:03:59,480
or to sleepie bye bye.

5201
05:03:59,480 --> 05:04:01,480
Please don't worry.

5202
05:04:01,480 --> 05:04:03,480
Odds are. I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.

5203
05:04:03,480 --> 05:04:05,480
I said it.

5204
05:04:05,480 --> 05:04:07,480
Yeah, it's true.

5205
05:04:07,480 --> 05:04:09,480
It's true. I might finish the campaign

5206
05:04:09,480 --> 05:04:11,480
and I might want to do some more. It's true.

5207
05:04:11,480 --> 05:04:13,480
It's true. The accusations are true.

5208
05:04:13,480 --> 05:04:15,480
So don't worry if you have to go to bed.

5209
05:04:15,480 --> 05:04:17,480
I might see you when you wake up.

5210
05:04:17,480 --> 05:04:19,480
So sweet dreams.

5211
05:04:19,480 --> 05:04:21,480
See you in the morning.

5212
05:04:23,480 --> 05:04:25,480
Jump off wall. Get kicked into wall.

5213
05:04:27,480 --> 05:04:29,480
The accusations are true.

5214
05:04:29,480 --> 05:04:31,480
I'm addicted.

5215
05:04:31,480 --> 05:04:33,480
But not as much as I'm addicted to you.

5216
05:04:33,480 --> 05:04:35,480
You guys might have the nicotine patch

5217
05:04:35,480 --> 05:04:37,480
on your head, but the truth is

5218
05:04:37,480 --> 05:04:39,480
under these bangs

5219
05:04:39,480 --> 05:04:41,480
or fringe,

5220
05:04:41,480 --> 05:04:43,480
I've got a nicotine patch too

5221
05:04:43,480 --> 05:04:45,480
and it's covering my entire forehead.

5222
05:04:49,480 --> 05:04:51,480
I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.

5223
05:04:51,480 --> 05:04:53,480
Whoa.

5224
05:04:53,480 --> 05:04:55,480
Okay, there we go.

5225
05:04:55,480 --> 05:04:57,480
This is the Roman bath house.

5226
05:04:57,480 --> 05:04:59,480
This is based on reveal, please.

5227
05:04:59,480 --> 05:05:01,480
They are public bath houses.

5228
05:05:03,480 --> 05:05:05,480
Okay, there's a lot going on. Hold on.

5229
05:05:05,480 --> 05:05:07,480
There's a lot going on. Hold on.

5230
05:05:07,480 --> 05:05:09,480
Big armor guy.

5231
05:05:11,480 --> 05:05:13,480
My notoriety is going

5232
05:05:13,480 --> 05:05:15,480
up.

5233
05:05:15,480 --> 05:05:17,480
I like how he just swings that air.

5234
05:05:17,480 --> 05:05:19,480
Can we get him while he's on the floor?

5235
05:05:19,480 --> 05:05:21,480
Get him on the floor!

5236
05:05:21,480 --> 05:05:23,480
Ow!

5237
05:05:23,480 --> 05:05:25,480
Get him on the floor!

5238
05:05:25,480 --> 05:05:27,480
Lavolpi!

5239
05:05:27,480 --> 05:05:29,480
Old man.

5240
05:05:29,480 --> 05:05:31,480
Put your Glex on.

5241
05:05:31,480 --> 05:05:33,480
Put your Glex on.

5242
05:05:33,480 --> 05:05:35,480
It's me!

5243
05:05:37,480 --> 05:05:39,480
He plays in the first danote.

5244
05:05:39,480 --> 05:05:41,480
He plays in the first danote.

5245
05:05:41,480 --> 05:05:43,480
That was definitely a VA.

5246
05:05:43,480 --> 05:05:45,480
They had used the law and they were like,

5247
05:05:45,480 --> 05:05:47,480
please just use any other voice.

5248
05:05:47,480 --> 05:05:49,480
It's going to be so obvious it's you.

5249
05:05:49,480 --> 05:05:51,480
So he had to go,

5250
05:05:51,480 --> 05:05:53,480
and play tonight.

5251
05:05:53,480 --> 05:05:55,480
Or a V sucking.

5252
05:05:55,480 --> 05:05:57,480
I don't have nicotine.

5253
05:05:57,480 --> 05:05:59,480
I have B.L.R.

5254
05:05:59,480 --> 05:06:01,480
That's so good.

5255
05:06:01,480 --> 05:06:03,480
Sleep is for the weak. I don't know.

5256
05:06:03,480 --> 05:06:05,480
Sleep is very healthy and apparently

5257
05:06:05,480 --> 05:06:07,480
you sleep regularly.

5258
05:06:07,480 --> 05:06:09,480
Then it's bad for your longevity.

5259
05:06:09,480 --> 05:06:11,480
And you might expire.

5260
05:06:11,480 --> 05:06:13,480
We don't really want...

5261
05:06:13,480 --> 05:06:15,480
I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.

5262
05:06:15,480 --> 05:06:17,480
I'm going to tell you the truth.

5263
05:06:17,480 --> 05:06:19,480
I'd rather you didn't expire.

5264
05:06:19,480 --> 05:06:21,480
So, please don't.

5265
05:06:23,480 --> 05:06:25,480
We're getting some strawny time though.

5266
05:06:25,480 --> 05:06:27,480
You're getting strawny time

5267
05:06:27,480 --> 05:06:29,480
for a very long time every day.

5268
05:06:29,480 --> 05:06:31,480
You're going to be sick of me.

5269
05:06:31,480 --> 05:06:33,480
Yeah.

5270
05:06:35,480 --> 05:06:37,480
Benenene.

5271
05:06:37,480 --> 05:06:39,480
Benenene.

5272
05:06:39,480 --> 05:06:41,480
The music's so good.

5273
05:06:41,480 --> 05:06:43,480
There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum

5274
05:06:43,480 --> 05:06:45,480
but we can get that at a later time.

5275
05:06:45,480 --> 05:06:47,480
Mananana.

5276
05:06:47,480 --> 05:06:49,480
Mananana.

5277
05:06:49,480 --> 05:06:51,480
Mananana.

5278
05:06:51,480 --> 05:06:53,480
We are...

5279
05:06:53,480 --> 05:06:55,480
We expire.

5280
05:06:55,480 --> 05:06:57,480
Survive for a moment.

5281
05:06:57,480 --> 05:06:59,480
Not only am I putting you at war,

5282
05:06:59,480 --> 05:07:01,480
I'm now expiring you manually.

5283
05:07:01,480 --> 05:07:03,480
You have been expired.

5284
05:07:03,480 --> 05:07:05,480
I literally glanced away

5285
05:07:05,480 --> 05:07:07,480
and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.

5286
05:07:07,480 --> 05:07:09,480
And I was like, oh, where is he?

5287
05:07:09,480 --> 05:07:11,480
Enemies. Enemies.

5288
05:07:11,480 --> 05:07:13,480
Enemies. Enemies.

5289
05:07:13,480 --> 05:07:15,480
Give them an animal.

5290
05:07:15,480 --> 05:07:17,480
Give the enemies an animal

5291
05:07:17,480 --> 05:07:19,480
for how much?

5292
05:07:19,480 --> 05:07:21,480
What the fuck?

5293
05:07:21,480 --> 05:07:23,480
I don't know.

5294
05:07:23,480 --> 05:07:25,480
I'm definitely using a quick

5295
05:07:25,480 --> 05:07:27,480
a quick five minute break for you guys.

5296
05:07:27,480 --> 05:07:29,480
I'll maybe read some Marshmallows

5297
05:07:29,480 --> 05:07:31,480
and we'll take a five minute break.

5298
05:07:31,480 --> 05:07:33,480
I'll eat and restore my

5299
05:07:33,480 --> 05:07:35,480
hydration levels and stuff.

5300
05:07:35,480 --> 05:07:37,480
Getting a wee bit delirious.

5301
05:07:37,480 --> 05:07:39,480
Just a wee bit.

5302
05:07:39,480 --> 05:07:41,480
Why is there so many guards this time?

5303
05:07:41,480 --> 05:07:43,480
I don't really recall this game.

5304
05:07:43,480 --> 05:07:45,480
Like this part having so many guards.

5305
05:07:45,480 --> 05:07:47,480
Look at this guy on the edge

5306
05:07:47,480 --> 05:07:49,480
over there.

5307
05:07:49,480 --> 05:07:51,480
Oh, what?

5308
05:07:51,480 --> 05:07:53,480
Are we all going?

5309
05:07:53,480 --> 05:07:55,480
Okay, he's stuck.

5310
05:07:55,480 --> 05:07:57,480
There. Okay, there we go.

5311
05:07:57,480 --> 05:07:59,480
All good. All good in the head.

5312
05:07:59,480 --> 05:08:01,480
She's got enemies on the brain.

5313
05:08:01,480 --> 05:08:03,480
Freudian slip.

5314
05:08:03,480 --> 05:08:05,480
Enemies. Enemies.

5315
05:08:05,480 --> 05:08:07,480
Sorry, I stuck them out.

5316
05:08:07,480 --> 05:08:09,480
It's like a really dumb...

5317
05:08:09,480 --> 05:08:11,480
Can I summon Leonardo?

5318
05:08:11,480 --> 05:08:13,480
I can. So on these benches

5319
05:08:13,480 --> 05:08:15,480
is where you can buy more of Leonardo's

5320
05:08:15,480 --> 05:08:17,480
inventions.

5321
05:08:17,480 --> 05:08:19,480
Um...

5322
05:08:19,480 --> 05:08:21,480
Is there a thing up there?

5323
05:08:21,480 --> 05:08:23,480
No, it's on the other side.

5324
05:08:23,480 --> 05:08:25,480
Leave me alone.

5325
05:08:25,480 --> 05:08:27,480
Leave me alone.

5326
05:08:27,480 --> 05:08:29,480
Never.

5327
05:08:29,480 --> 05:08:31,480
Never.

5328
05:08:31,480 --> 05:08:33,480
Leave me alone.

5329
05:08:33,480 --> 05:08:35,480
Leave me alone.

5330
05:08:35,480 --> 05:08:37,480
What did you ask the scrawny animal

5331
05:08:37,480 --> 05:08:39,480
marriage when?

5332
05:08:39,480 --> 05:08:41,480
You expect me to come in the middle

5333
05:08:41,480 --> 05:08:43,480
of the night? Do you think I would?

5334
05:08:47,480 --> 05:08:49,480
I drank a good stretch.

5335
05:08:49,480 --> 05:08:51,480
Right, we'll finish this sequence

5336
05:08:51,480 --> 05:08:53,480
because

5337
05:08:53,480 --> 05:08:55,480
I think this is a quick sequence.

5338
05:08:55,480 --> 05:08:57,480
I think we're already, like, pretty much getting through it.

5339
05:08:57,480 --> 05:08:59,480
We're about to claim the costumes

5340
05:08:59,480 --> 05:09:01,480
off of enemies.

5341
05:09:01,480 --> 05:09:03,480
Do you think my assassin recruits

5342
05:09:03,480 --> 05:09:05,480
have finished the mission?

5343
05:09:11,480 --> 05:09:13,480
So, Lavalpe is now convinced

5344
05:09:13,480 --> 05:09:15,480
Marquiovelli is a thief.

5345
05:09:15,480 --> 05:09:17,480
It is a traitor

5346
05:09:17,480 --> 05:09:19,480
because the events

5347
05:09:19,480 --> 05:09:21,480
are synchronizing up too much.

5348
05:09:21,480 --> 05:09:23,480
Cesare leaves the castle

5349
05:09:23,480 --> 05:09:25,480
when

5350
05:09:25,480 --> 05:09:27,480
he could have got tipped off.

5351
05:09:27,480 --> 05:09:29,480
Marquiovelli uses guards

5352
05:09:29,480 --> 05:09:31,480
to tell him secrets of the Borgia

5353
05:09:31,480 --> 05:09:33,480
and

5354
05:09:33,480 --> 05:09:35,480
Lavalpe finds it

5355
05:09:35,480 --> 05:09:37,480
just far too suspicious

5356
05:09:37,480 --> 05:09:39,480
and he's basically

5357
05:09:39,480 --> 05:09:41,480
telling us

5358
05:09:41,480 --> 05:09:43,480
if you do not put an end

5359
05:09:43,480 --> 05:09:45,480
to Lavalpe

5360
05:09:45,480 --> 05:09:47,480
to Marquiovelli

5361
05:09:47,480 --> 05:09:49,480
I'll do it myself.

5362
05:09:49,480 --> 05:09:51,480
Which is

5363
05:09:51,480 --> 05:09:53,480
scary biscuits and scary bean.

5364
05:09:53,480 --> 05:09:55,480
I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.

5365
05:09:55,480 --> 05:09:57,480
Oh my god, did you hear my voice there?

5366
05:09:57,480 --> 05:09:59,480
For you.

5367
05:09:59,480 --> 05:10:01,480
For you.

5368
05:10:01,480 --> 05:10:03,480
Would you still love me if I send it?

5369
05:10:03,480 --> 05:10:05,480
Like, oh.

5370
05:10:05,480 --> 05:10:07,480
I'm

5371
05:10:07,480 --> 05:10:09,480
wrecking and decking.

5372
05:10:09,480 --> 05:10:11,480
We're on sequence six.

5373
05:10:11,480 --> 05:10:13,480
Act six and

5374
05:10:13,480 --> 05:10:15,480
there's nine acts again.

5375
05:10:17,480 --> 05:10:19,480
Yes, I write you would.

5376
05:10:21,480 --> 05:10:23,480
Which was an accident.

5377
05:10:33,480 --> 05:10:35,480
Italy lore, Italy lore.

5378
05:10:43,480 --> 05:10:45,480
Can't believe it.

5379
05:10:45,480 --> 05:10:47,480
He said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.

5380
05:10:51,480 --> 05:10:53,480
I

5381
05:10:55,480 --> 05:10:57,480
have friends that try to tell me that

5382
05:10:57,480 --> 05:10:59,480
Assassin's Creed

5383
05:10:59,480 --> 05:11:01,480
this Assassin's Creed brotherhood isn't a good game.

5384
05:11:01,480 --> 05:11:03,480
There's so many kill mechanics

5385
05:11:03,480 --> 05:11:05,480
in brotherhood. Wish they didn't

5386
05:11:05,480 --> 05:11:07,480
steal the DLC though.

5387
05:11:07,480 --> 05:11:09,480
Yeah.

5388
05:11:09,480 --> 05:11:11,480
It's a shame.

5389
05:11:11,480 --> 05:11:13,480
DLC was really the height.

5390
05:11:15,480 --> 05:11:17,480
Oh.

5391
05:11:17,480 --> 05:11:19,480
He said no one else is allowed

5392
05:11:19,480 --> 05:11:21,480
I obey.

5393
05:11:21,480 --> 05:11:23,480
Oh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.

5394
05:11:23,480 --> 05:11:25,480
We obey.

5395
05:11:25,480 --> 05:11:27,480
We obey.

5396
05:11:27,480 --> 05:11:29,480
We obey Sheebie please.

5397
05:11:31,480 --> 05:11:33,480
Okay, now this horse

5398
05:11:33,480 --> 05:11:35,480
constantly gets turned around

5399
05:11:35,480 --> 05:11:37,480
so you really can't be too close to him like at all.

5400
05:11:37,480 --> 05:11:39,480
We obey Sheebie, we obey.

5401
05:11:39,480 --> 05:11:41,480
We do not question, we obey.

5402
05:11:45,480 --> 05:11:47,480
Just taking

5403
05:11:47,480 --> 05:11:49,480
our time with this guy because

5404
05:11:49,480 --> 05:11:51,480
he's so,

5405
05:11:51,480 --> 05:11:53,480
he spins around so easily

5406
05:11:53,480 --> 05:11:55,480
and you can desync so quick.

5407
05:11:59,480 --> 05:12:01,480
Taking our time.

5408
05:12:01,480 --> 05:12:03,480
Easy.

5409
05:12:03,480 --> 05:12:05,480
Use it.

5410
05:12:09,480 --> 05:12:11,480
This might be the longest hailing mission

5411
05:12:11,480 --> 05:12:13,480
they've actually put in the game.

5412
05:12:13,480 --> 05:12:15,480
Ah.

5413
05:12:15,480 --> 05:12:17,480
The entire act is just

5414
05:12:17,480 --> 05:12:19,480
hailing missions.

5415
05:12:19,480 --> 05:12:21,480
Now don't get me wrong,

5416
05:12:21,480 --> 05:12:23,480
I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.

5417
05:12:23,480 --> 05:12:25,480
If I complain about

5418
05:12:25,480 --> 05:12:27,480
gameplay I would rather suggest

5419
05:12:27,480 --> 05:12:29,480
something else that's supposed to happen

5420
05:12:29,480 --> 05:12:31,480
but if you consider all the different

5421
05:12:31,480 --> 05:12:33,480
types of mechanics

5422
05:12:33,480 --> 05:12:35,480
or subjects

5423
05:12:35,480 --> 05:12:37,480
that's put in the game, for example

5424
05:12:37,480 --> 05:12:39,480
like the lair

5425
05:12:39,480 --> 05:12:41,480
of Romulis

5426
05:12:41,480 --> 05:12:43,480
or Leonardo's missions

5427
05:12:43,480 --> 05:12:45,480
these are completely alternative.

5428
05:12:45,480 --> 05:12:47,480
If you're gonna be like

5429
05:12:47,480 --> 05:12:49,480
I don't really enjoy the hailing missions, I completely understand that.

5430
05:12:49,480 --> 05:12:51,480
I'm not dogging on your comment by the way

5431
05:12:51,480 --> 05:12:53,480
I'm just discussing it from

5432
05:12:53,480 --> 05:12:55,480
if you ever wanted to

5433
05:12:55,480 --> 05:12:57,480
review it. Oh by the way these guards

5434
05:12:57,480 --> 05:12:59,480
useless. Absolutely useless.

5435
05:13:01,480 --> 05:13:03,480
You can just walk straight in.

5436
05:13:05,480 --> 05:13:07,480
I think you can also walk past these two

5437
05:13:07,480 --> 05:13:09,480
if you get

5438
05:13:09,480 --> 05:13:11,480
into that hay bale, they just forget you exist.

5439
05:13:11,480 --> 05:13:13,480
They like think you're a far...

5440
05:13:13,480 --> 05:13:15,480
OOOH!

5441
05:13:15,480 --> 05:13:17,480
Woopsies! Woopsies! Woopsies!

5442
05:13:17,480 --> 05:13:19,480
Woopsies! Woopsies!

5443
05:13:19,480 --> 05:13:21,480
So it doesn't matter if the guards

5444
05:13:21,480 --> 05:13:23,480
spot me, it's not a problem.

5445
05:13:23,480 --> 05:13:25,480
Although if I run it does fulfill the

5446
05:13:25,480 --> 05:13:27,480
can you go in the hay bale?

5447
05:13:27,480 --> 05:13:29,480
Jeez, my goodness gravy.

5448
05:13:29,480 --> 05:13:31,480
It's evil. Are you okay?

5449
05:13:31,480 --> 05:13:33,480
I'm a little nervous now, honestly.

5450
05:13:35,480 --> 05:13:37,480
You can, if they stop looking at me

5451
05:13:37,480 --> 05:13:39,480
yep, okay, yeah.

5452
05:13:39,480 --> 05:13:41,480
You hardly have to kill anyone

5453
05:13:41,480 --> 05:13:43,480
in these kind of things.

5454
05:13:43,480 --> 05:13:45,480
The game is so forgiving, that's why I absolutely

5455
05:13:45,480 --> 05:13:47,480
adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

5456
05:13:47,480 --> 05:13:49,480
It is so forgiving.

5457
05:13:49,480 --> 05:13:51,480
Now don't get me wrong, you'll still get a few

5458
05:13:51,480 --> 05:13:53,480
things where they're like, that shouldn't have got me, but

5459
05:13:53,480 --> 05:13:55,480
yeah.

5460
05:13:55,480 --> 05:13:57,480
It's so forgiving. So if you hide in the hay bale

5461
05:13:57,480 --> 05:13:59,480
wait for this guy to come up and then

5462
05:13:59,480 --> 05:14:01,480
send in a... oh he doesn't come up.

5463
05:14:01,480 --> 05:14:03,480
Well wait for the guy to go

5464
05:14:03,480 --> 05:14:05,480
away and then... yep, there you go.

5465
05:14:05,480 --> 05:14:07,480
Boom! Cluster McCord.

5466
05:14:09,480 --> 05:14:11,480
Boom!

5467
05:14:13,480 --> 05:14:15,480
So...

5468
05:14:15,480 --> 05:14:17,480
he gets on a horse

5469
05:14:17,480 --> 05:14:19,480
you're actually supposed to go over here

5470
05:14:19,480 --> 05:14:21,480
to get on a horse

5471
05:14:21,480 --> 05:14:23,480
to continue to follow him.

5472
05:14:25,480 --> 05:14:27,480
But it's not really obvious

5473
05:14:27,480 --> 05:14:29,480
like most people would just chase on foot

5474
05:14:29,480 --> 05:14:31,480
which is completely doable

5475
05:14:31,480 --> 05:14:33,480
but for some reason they put the horses

5476
05:14:33,480 --> 05:14:35,480
a wee bit to the left and

5477
05:14:35,480 --> 05:14:37,480
uh, yeah.

5478
05:14:38,480 --> 05:14:40,480
It's a bit harder to

5479
05:14:40,480 --> 05:14:42,480
recognise, but yeah definitely this game

5480
05:14:42,480 --> 05:14:44,480
if you've never played Assassin's Creed before

5481
05:14:44,480 --> 05:14:46,480
I would actually...

5482
05:14:46,480 --> 05:14:48,480
you'd miss out on the plot of 2

5483
05:14:48,480 --> 05:14:50,480
which is the start of Itsu's story

5484
05:14:50,480 --> 05:14:53,480
but mechanic and forgiveness wise

5485
05:14:53,480 --> 05:14:55,480
if you're not really a strong gamer

5486
05:14:55,480 --> 05:14:57,480
Brotherhood definitely is one for you.

5487
05:14:59,480 --> 05:15:01,480
Ah my tummy's wumbling if you heard that

5488
05:15:01,480 --> 05:15:03,480
You probably can't over the gameplay actually.

5489
05:15:03,480 --> 05:15:05,480
The fact that you're passionate about the game

5490
05:15:05,480 --> 05:15:07,480
it's just...

5491
05:15:07,480 --> 05:15:09,480
you latch onto something, you can play a game

5492
05:15:09,480 --> 05:15:11,480
and you have absolutely no idea what to expect

5493
05:15:11,480 --> 05:15:13,480
and then you just adore it like a binding

5494
05:15:13,480 --> 05:15:15,480
of Isaac is another game

5495
05:15:15,480 --> 05:15:17,480
I didn't know what to expect

5496
05:15:17,480 --> 05:15:19,480
and like the first time I played it

5497
05:15:19,480 --> 05:15:21,480
I think I played it for like 5 hours and can't...

5498
05:15:21,480 --> 05:15:23,480
He did the turnaround thing

5499
05:15:23,480 --> 05:15:25,480
he's now supposed to do

5500
05:15:25,480 --> 05:15:27,480
and now he's chasing me!

5501
05:15:27,480 --> 05:15:29,480
Leave me alone!

5502
05:15:29,480 --> 05:15:31,480
Oh my god...

5503
05:15:31,480 --> 05:15:33,480
that was... that was gonna

5504
05:15:33,480 --> 05:15:35,480
he sinks so hard all because he freaking

5505
05:15:35,480 --> 05:15:37,480
turned around!

5506
05:15:37,480 --> 05:15:39,480
I knew you were gonna do that

5507
05:15:39,480 --> 05:15:41,480
I warned you guys

5508
05:15:41,480 --> 05:15:43,480
he always turns around in this tailing mission

5509
05:15:43,480 --> 05:15:45,480
he gets caught on NPCs

5510
05:15:45,480 --> 05:15:47,480
and spins around

5511
05:15:47,480 --> 05:15:49,480
and it scares me

5512
05:15:49,480 --> 05:15:51,480
every time I never expect that

5513
05:15:53,480 --> 05:15:55,480
he was chasing me though

5514
05:15:55,480 --> 05:15:57,480
I don't normally expect them to like turn around

5515
05:15:57,480 --> 05:15:59,480
and chase but I guess

5516
05:15:59,480 --> 05:16:01,480
if you're close enough they will

5517
05:16:03,480 --> 05:16:05,480
I'm also visiting your mom

5518
05:16:07,480 --> 05:16:09,480
Have a nice visit

5519
05:16:09,480 --> 05:16:11,480
sorry I was gonna say something really mean

5520
05:16:11,480 --> 05:16:13,480
but I refrained

5521
05:16:13,480 --> 05:16:15,480
I was gonna say

5522
05:16:15,480 --> 05:16:17,480
I saw her earlier the day

5523
05:16:17,480 --> 05:16:19,480
Oh he's done it again!

5524
05:16:19,480 --> 05:16:21,480
No way I'm reading chat! Don't do that again!

5525
05:16:21,480 --> 05:16:23,480
Don't do that again!

5526
05:16:23,480 --> 05:16:25,480
You're giving me a heart attack

5527
05:16:25,480 --> 05:16:27,480
Goodness me

5528
05:16:27,480 --> 05:16:29,480
This Johnny's off to visit his mom

5529
05:16:29,480 --> 05:16:31,480
Doing your mom!

5530
05:16:31,480 --> 05:16:33,480
You know he's strictly doing your mom!

5531
05:16:37,480 --> 05:16:39,480
So

5532
05:16:39,480 --> 05:16:41,480
Oh!

5533
05:16:41,480 --> 05:16:43,480
Please don't attack me

5534
05:16:45,480 --> 05:16:47,480
Let the recruits deal with the

5535
05:16:47,480 --> 05:16:49,480
Oh this isn't the right way!

5536
05:16:49,480 --> 05:16:51,480
This isn't the way to victory

5537
05:16:51,480 --> 05:16:53,480
to victory to victory

5538
05:16:53,480 --> 05:16:55,480
This ain't the way to victory

5539
05:16:55,480 --> 05:16:57,480
My assassins are now fighting it out

5540
05:16:57,480 --> 05:16:59,480
I hope they're leveled up enough

5541
05:16:59,480 --> 05:17:01,480
to deal with them

5542
05:17:01,480 --> 05:17:03,480
to deal with them to deal with them

5543
05:17:03,480 --> 05:17:05,480
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them

5544
05:17:05,480 --> 05:17:07,480
because I don't have any more recruits

5545
05:17:09,480 --> 05:17:11,480
Oh no I needed recruits to

5546
05:17:11,480 --> 05:17:13,480
100% this mission

5547
05:17:13,480 --> 05:17:15,480
Can I just stand about

5548
05:17:15,480 --> 05:17:17,480
and wait for them to reappear

5549
05:17:17,480 --> 05:17:19,480
because I am patient enough

5550
05:17:19,480 --> 05:17:21,480
to do that

5551
05:17:23,480 --> 05:17:25,480
Destruction! Destruction!

5552
05:17:25,480 --> 05:17:27,480
Hmm

5553
05:17:27,480 --> 05:17:29,480
Oh I want to play GTA 4 actually

5554
05:17:31,480 --> 05:17:33,480
I need to go

5555
05:17:33,480 --> 05:17:35,480
I want to go bowling

5556
05:17:35,480 --> 05:17:37,480
Oh they didn't come

5557
05:17:37,480 --> 05:17:39,480
They

5558
05:17:39,480 --> 05:17:41,480
One more minute

5559
05:17:41,480 --> 05:17:43,480
Oh look they've lost the health bar

5560
05:17:43,480 --> 05:17:45,480
See that's why I always put it into health

5561
05:17:45,480 --> 05:17:47,480
because they can make as many mistakes as they need to

5562
05:17:47,480 --> 05:17:49,480
Wait why

5563
05:17:49,480 --> 05:17:51,480
am I getting yellowed

5564
05:17:51,480 --> 05:17:53,480
Why am I getting yellowed

5565
05:17:53,480 --> 05:17:55,480
My assassin recruits are going ham

5566
05:17:55,480 --> 05:17:57,480
Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not

5567
05:17:57,480 --> 05:17:59,480
Right that's fine

5568
05:17:59,480 --> 05:18:01,480
I can be detected

5569
05:18:01,480 --> 05:18:03,480
Who is shooting?

5570
05:18:03,480 --> 05:18:05,480
What is going on over there?

5571
05:18:05,480 --> 05:18:07,480
Do you not need to reload?

5572
05:18:07,480 --> 05:18:09,480
Hello?

5573
05:18:11,480 --> 05:18:13,480
They just despawned

5574
05:18:13,480 --> 05:18:15,480
Okay well as long as they're not dead

5575
05:18:15,480 --> 05:18:17,480
I guess jeez

5576
05:18:19,480 --> 05:18:21,480
Strudy!

5577
05:18:21,480 --> 05:18:23,480
Why not name your

5578
05:18:23,480 --> 05:18:25,480
Bro

5579
05:18:25,480 --> 05:18:27,480
Someone in chat has named himself

5580
05:18:27,480 --> 05:18:29,480
Fondle of bosom

5581
05:18:29,480 --> 05:18:31,480
Frickin

5582
05:18:31,480 --> 05:18:33,480
I can't see it anymore

5583
05:18:33,480 --> 05:18:35,480
Did mods time you ever for that?

5584
05:18:35,480 --> 05:18:37,480
That's hilarious

5585
05:18:37,480 --> 05:18:39,480
I read that

5586
05:18:39,480 --> 05:18:41,480
Fondle of bosom

5587
05:18:41,480 --> 05:18:43,480
Gen 0 be sucky

5588
05:18:43,480 --> 05:18:45,480
I don't see it anymore

5589
05:18:45,480 --> 05:18:47,480
Mods timed out it was funny

5590
05:18:47,480 --> 05:18:49,480
Unless you were spamming then get bonked

5591
05:18:49,480 --> 05:18:51,480
I have to admit

5592
05:18:53,480 --> 05:18:55,480
I almost ran out of time there

5593
05:18:55,480 --> 05:18:57,480
I'm too busy reading chat

5594
05:18:57,480 --> 05:18:59,480
I literally sounded like a monkey there

5595
05:18:59,480 --> 05:19:01,480
I'm not even pretending

5596
05:19:01,480 --> 05:19:03,480
I almost ran out of time

5597
05:19:05,480 --> 05:19:07,480
Alright do not turn around again

5598
05:19:07,480 --> 05:19:09,480
I'm going to be so upset

5599
05:19:09,480 --> 05:19:11,480
I don't think he does it too much in this sequence part

5600
05:19:11,480 --> 05:19:13,480
I don't know

5601
05:19:13,480 --> 05:19:15,480
It's the ghost of Christmas pass

5602
05:19:19,480 --> 05:19:21,480
Oh my

5603
05:19:21,480 --> 05:19:23,480
Oh my

5604
05:19:23,480 --> 05:19:25,480
My voice

5605
05:19:25,480 --> 05:19:27,480
My voice

5606
05:19:27,480 --> 05:19:29,480
Literally can't right now

5607
05:19:31,480 --> 05:19:33,480
Oh he's getting really far head actually

5608
05:19:33,480 --> 05:19:35,480
Hold on sorry I'm just really enjoying

5609
05:19:35,480 --> 05:19:37,480
Reading chat with you

5610
05:19:37,480 --> 05:19:39,480
I apologize

5611
05:19:39,480 --> 05:19:41,480
Because I remember that people enjoy

5612
05:19:41,480 --> 05:19:43,480
When they get their stuff read out

5613
05:19:43,480 --> 05:19:45,480
I never did my high

5614
05:19:45,480 --> 05:19:47,480
thing

5615
05:19:47,480 --> 05:19:49,480
Could I do the high thing?

5616
05:19:49,480 --> 05:19:51,480
Like so sometimes

5617
05:19:51,480 --> 05:19:53,480
When I started upstream I would actually

5618
05:19:53,480 --> 05:19:55,480
Read everyone's name out just to try

5619
05:19:55,480 --> 05:19:57,480
To be super thankful

5620
05:19:57,480 --> 05:19:59,480
Maybe for the ASMR stream

5621
05:19:59,480 --> 05:20:01,480
We could try it

5622
05:20:01,480 --> 05:20:03,480
Because I understand

5623
05:20:03,480 --> 05:20:05,480
People want to hear their

5624
05:20:05,480 --> 05:20:07,480
Name be said by me

5625
05:20:07,480 --> 05:20:09,480
Because it's nice to be acknowledged

5626
05:20:09,480 --> 05:20:11,480
Let's not pretend

5627
05:20:11,480 --> 05:20:13,480
It's not nice to have

5628
05:20:13,480 --> 05:20:15,480
Strummer reply directly type thing

5629
05:20:15,480 --> 05:20:17,480
Orally generally discuss it

5630
05:20:17,480 --> 05:20:19,480
So maybe in the ASMR stream

5631
05:20:19,480 --> 05:20:21,480
As a one off I will try my best

5632
05:20:21,480 --> 05:20:23,480
To say hi to everyone

5633
05:20:23,480 --> 05:20:25,480
You there

5634
05:20:25,480 --> 05:20:27,480
Perish

5635
05:20:27,480 --> 05:20:29,480
That's a lot of enemies

5636
05:20:29,480 --> 05:20:31,480
I got enemies

5637
05:20:31,480 --> 05:20:33,480
I'm calling in my recruits

5638
05:20:33,480 --> 05:20:35,480
Okay let's get to the fight

5639
05:20:37,480 --> 05:20:39,480
Take this

5640
05:20:39,480 --> 05:20:41,480
And this

5641
05:20:41,480 --> 05:20:43,480
And that

5642
05:20:43,480 --> 05:20:45,480
And

5643
05:20:47,480 --> 05:20:49,480
I actually

5644
05:20:49,480 --> 05:20:51,480
I'm gonna heal up

5645
05:20:51,480 --> 05:20:53,480
And try and pick up a medicine vial

5646
05:20:55,480 --> 05:20:57,480
Real names or username

5647
05:20:57,480 --> 05:20:59,480
I would never encourage anyone

5648
05:20:59,480 --> 05:21:01,480
To use their real name

5649
05:21:01,480 --> 05:21:03,480
On the internet

5650
05:21:03,480 --> 05:21:05,480
I name yourself

5651
05:21:05,480 --> 05:21:07,480
Something funny

5652
05:21:07,480 --> 05:21:09,480
Or a meme or after

5653
05:21:09,480 --> 05:21:11,480
A video game for example

5654
05:21:13,480 --> 05:21:15,480
There's no way I'm getting

5655
05:21:15,480 --> 05:21:17,480
Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him

5656
05:21:17,480 --> 05:21:19,480
I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer

5657
05:21:23,480 --> 05:21:25,480
It's you you're aimbot

5658
05:21:25,480 --> 05:21:27,480
Your armor is not that good sir

5659
05:21:27,480 --> 05:21:29,480
I know for a fact your armor is not that good

5660
05:21:31,480 --> 05:21:33,480
Give me my crossbow bolt back

5661
05:21:33,480 --> 05:21:35,480
Right now I know you have some on your persons

5662
05:21:35,480 --> 05:21:37,480
Not the knife

5663
05:21:37,480 --> 05:21:39,480
It's not a knife

5664
05:21:39,480 --> 05:21:41,480
That's a sword

5665
05:21:41,480 --> 05:21:43,480
You gave me my crossbow bolt back

5666
05:21:43,480 --> 05:21:45,480
That's exactly what I thought

5667
05:21:45,480 --> 05:21:47,480
You're not that guy

5668
05:21:47,480 --> 05:21:49,480
I started doing a marathon

5669
05:21:49,480 --> 05:21:51,480
Imagine if you did Arkham Knight

5670
05:21:51,480 --> 05:21:53,480
I do play Batman and go play the Batman

5671
05:21:53,480 --> 05:21:55,480
Please don't stop

5672
05:21:55,480 --> 05:21:57,480
And look at me

5673
05:21:57,480 --> 05:21:59,480
Please don't stop

5674
05:22:03,480 --> 05:22:05,480
The assassin should kill that third guy

5675
05:22:05,480 --> 05:22:07,480
What is going on

5676
05:22:07,480 --> 05:22:09,480
Why is it so loud when you guys

5677
05:22:09,480 --> 05:22:11,480
Kill people

5678
05:22:11,480 --> 05:22:13,480
Okay now the whole

5679
05:22:13,480 --> 05:22:15,480
Of like

5680
05:22:15,480 --> 05:22:17,480
Roma knows that you're like shooting

5681
05:22:17,480 --> 05:22:19,480
Guns over there

5682
05:22:23,480 --> 05:22:25,480
Oh my god it's Fond de la Buzum

5683
05:22:25,480 --> 05:22:27,480
I can't believe it are you gonna like roleplay

5684
05:22:27,480 --> 05:22:29,480
Zero in chat

5685
05:22:33,480 --> 05:22:35,480
Damn hope to see it

5686
05:22:35,480 --> 05:22:37,480
Long as please

5687
05:22:37,480 --> 05:22:39,480
I am much in your debt

5688
05:22:41,480 --> 05:22:43,480
He acts on stage

5689
05:22:43,480 --> 05:22:45,480
One of my men will

5690
05:22:45,480 --> 05:22:47,480
I guess you would go through the live chat participants

5691
05:22:47,480 --> 05:22:49,480
Wait I can see a list of everyone watching

5692
05:22:49,480 --> 05:22:51,480
No that's only on Twitch

5693
05:22:53,480 --> 05:22:55,480
Like maybe at the start

5694
05:22:55,480 --> 05:22:57,480
Of this ASMR

5695
05:22:57,480 --> 05:22:59,480
As a one off cause like it's just not plausible to like keep up

5696
05:22:59,480 --> 05:23:01,480
But just as a thank you for like showing up

5697
05:23:01,480 --> 05:23:03,480
Still being here still meaming around

5698
05:23:03,480 --> 05:23:05,480
Um

5699
05:23:05,480 --> 05:23:07,480
I haven't played Assassin's Creed

5700
05:23:07,480 --> 05:23:09,480
But it seems similar to Arkham Knights

5701
05:23:09,480 --> 05:23:11,480
I

5702
05:23:11,480 --> 05:23:13,480
Wouldn't entirely disagree

5703
05:23:13,480 --> 05:23:15,480
Very agile

5704
05:23:15,480 --> 05:23:17,480
Um

5705
05:23:17,480 --> 05:23:19,480
Very agility based

5706
05:23:19,480 --> 05:23:21,480
Definitely

5707
05:23:21,480 --> 05:23:23,480
Um

5708
05:23:23,480 --> 05:23:25,480
You know hunting around

5709
05:23:25,480 --> 05:23:27,480
This 100% is just don't kill anyone

5710
05:23:27,480 --> 05:23:29,480
If you scoot your bot all the way

5711
05:23:29,480 --> 05:23:31,480
Along the coliseum

5712
05:23:31,480 --> 05:23:33,480
Absolutely no issues

5713
05:23:33,480 --> 05:23:35,480
You shouldn't run into any guards if you do

5714
05:23:35,480 --> 05:23:37,480
You can literally just hang off the ledge

5715
05:23:37,480 --> 05:23:39,480
I wish I had the climbing glove though

5716
05:23:39,480 --> 05:23:41,480
That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch

5717
05:23:41,480 --> 05:23:43,480
For this part of the

5718
05:23:43,480 --> 05:23:45,480
Section

5719
05:23:45,480 --> 05:23:47,480
But unfortunately

5720
05:23:47,480 --> 05:23:49,480
I don't have that where am I supposed to go

5721
05:23:49,480 --> 05:23:51,480
Uh

5722
05:23:51,480 --> 05:23:53,480
So the watch point is all the way

5723
05:23:53,480 --> 05:23:55,480
Oh my god that stance

5724
05:23:55,480 --> 05:23:57,480
It actually looks pretty funny

5725
05:24:01,480 --> 05:24:03,480
Okay

5726
05:24:03,480 --> 05:24:05,480
We're gonna go for this

5727
05:24:05,480 --> 05:24:07,480
What

5728
05:24:07,480 --> 05:24:09,480
Whoa I didn't even realize that guard could see me

5729
05:24:09,480 --> 05:24:11,480
What? How could he even see me

5730
05:24:11,480 --> 05:24:13,480
We'll go for the viewpoint

5731
05:24:13,480 --> 05:24:15,480
And then we will

5732
05:24:15,480 --> 05:24:17,480
Continue with this mission this act is getting

5733
05:24:17,480 --> 05:24:19,480
Very close to being finished

5734
05:24:19,480 --> 05:24:21,480
And then we will have a five minute break

5735
05:24:21,480 --> 05:24:23,480
I will read any marshmallows

5736
05:24:23,480 --> 05:24:25,480
So if you want to ask any questions

5737
05:24:25,480 --> 05:24:27,480
Or more than can

5738
05:24:27,480 --> 05:24:29,480
I did miss some like during

5739
05:24:29,480 --> 05:24:31,480
The 2.0 and

5740
05:24:31,480 --> 05:24:33,480
The exposing

5741
05:24:33,480 --> 05:24:35,480
Just because

5742
05:24:35,480 --> 05:24:37,480
Not that it wasn't good enough

5743
05:24:37,480 --> 05:24:39,480
But maybe it wasn't like on subject

5744
05:24:39,480 --> 05:24:41,480
Or didn't quite necessarily relate to me

5745
05:24:41,480 --> 05:24:43,480
Like for the 2.0

5746
05:24:43,480 --> 05:24:45,480
So I just sent it

5747
05:24:45,480 --> 05:24:47,480
I might give that a good week

5748
05:24:47,480 --> 05:24:49,480
But you're welcome to ask any questions

5749
05:24:49,480 --> 05:24:51,480
We will rehydrate

5750
05:24:51,480 --> 05:24:53,480
I'm getting a T

5751
05:24:53,480 --> 05:24:55,480
My voice is perishing

5752
05:24:55,480 --> 05:24:57,480
Where am I supposed to go

5753
05:24:57,480 --> 05:24:59,480
Over there

5754
05:24:59,480 --> 05:25:01,480
There is a feather on top

5755
05:25:01,480 --> 05:25:03,480
Of the Colosseum but I'm actually happy

5756
05:25:03,480 --> 05:25:05,480
To just climb up again okay that's where we're supposed

5757
05:25:05,480 --> 05:25:07,480
To go

5758
05:25:07,480 --> 05:25:09,480
Couldn't see it because of the

5759
05:25:09,480 --> 05:25:11,480
Render distance but that's okay

5760
05:25:11,480 --> 05:25:13,480
Because this is an older game

5761
05:25:15,480 --> 05:25:17,480
If you look at the three dots

5762
05:25:17,480 --> 05:25:19,480
Where it has time stamp and reactions

5763
05:25:19,480 --> 05:25:21,480
And option to pop out chat

5764
05:25:21,480 --> 05:25:23,480
It says participants I think it's just chatters

5765
05:25:23,480 --> 05:25:25,480
That have typed in chat

5766
05:25:25,480 --> 05:25:27,480
I was just going to get you all to be like hi

5767
05:25:27,480 --> 05:25:29,480
And then start reading your name

5768
05:25:29,480 --> 05:25:31,480
Ear to ear

5769
05:25:33,480 --> 05:25:35,480
Senor

5770
05:25:35,480 --> 05:25:37,480
I've been going away for the last hour

5771
05:25:37,480 --> 05:25:39,480
No you haven't missed a thing

5772
05:25:39,480 --> 05:25:41,480
I'm giving away we are on

5773
05:25:41,480 --> 05:25:43,480
A sequence

5774
05:25:43,480 --> 05:25:45,480
Six

5775
05:25:45,480 --> 05:25:47,480
Which is

5776
05:25:47,480 --> 05:25:49,480
My god

5777
05:25:49,480 --> 05:25:51,480
Why has thou forsaken

5778
05:25:51,480 --> 05:25:53,480
Mhmm

5779
05:25:53,480 --> 05:25:55,480
Mhmm

5780
05:25:55,480 --> 05:25:57,480
Right heading out

5781
05:25:57,480 --> 05:25:59,480
Thank you for hanging again

5782
05:25:59,480 --> 05:26:01,480
Anyone who is watching you've done so far

5783
05:26:01,480 --> 05:26:03,480
You've done well so far

5784
05:26:03,480 --> 05:26:05,480
It's five and a half hours

5785
05:26:05,480 --> 05:26:07,480
I don't want to expect you to be here for the film

5786
05:26:07,480 --> 05:26:09,480
Please rest when you can

5787
05:26:09,480 --> 05:26:11,480
And also

5788
05:26:11,480 --> 05:26:13,480
Emi is streaming ASMR live if you'd like to check that out

5789
05:26:13,480 --> 05:26:15,480
Emi Bezo she has linked below

5790
05:26:15,480 --> 05:26:17,480
In my description

5791
05:26:17,480 --> 05:26:19,480
Thank you so much

5792
05:26:21,480 --> 05:26:23,480
Uh

5793
05:26:23,480 --> 05:26:25,480
So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs

5794
05:26:25,480 --> 05:26:27,480
We are about to finish up the sequence

5795
05:26:27,480 --> 05:26:29,480
We just need to eliminate

5796
05:26:29,480 --> 05:26:31,480
These three guards that come up

5797
05:26:31,480 --> 05:26:33,480
And then deal with the poison sequence

5798
05:26:33,480 --> 05:26:35,480
And then I believe

5799
05:26:37,480 --> 05:26:39,480
That the sequence is over

5800
05:26:39,480 --> 05:26:41,480
We are getting

5801
05:26:41,480 --> 05:26:43,480
Very close to finishing

5802
05:26:43,480 --> 05:26:45,480
The campaign

5803
05:26:45,480 --> 05:26:47,480
Very very close

5804
05:26:47,480 --> 05:26:49,480
Just run all the way around the call

5805
05:26:49,480 --> 05:26:51,480
Until you get up to the hay bale

5806
05:26:51,480 --> 05:26:53,480
There is a treasure chest I always ignore

5807
05:26:53,480 --> 05:26:55,480
We can always come back for it later

5808
05:26:55,480 --> 05:26:57,480
There you go

5809
05:26:57,480 --> 05:26:59,480
You can instantly assassinate the hay bale

5810
05:26:59,480 --> 05:27:01,480
And oh it's four targets

5811
05:27:01,480 --> 05:27:03,480
Excuse me

5812
05:27:03,480 --> 05:27:05,480
Such a fakey gamer

5813
05:27:05,480 --> 05:27:07,480
Again crossbow bolts are

5814
05:27:07,480 --> 05:27:09,480
Completely silent

5815
05:27:09,480 --> 05:27:11,480
They will not

5816
05:27:11,480 --> 05:27:13,480
Allure anyone to what has happened

5817
05:27:13,480 --> 05:27:15,480
In the area

5818
05:27:15,480 --> 05:27:17,480
Which is very nice

5819
05:27:17,480 --> 05:27:19,480
Unfortunately I'm running

5820
05:27:19,480 --> 05:27:21,480
Rather low on crossbow bolts

5821
05:27:21,480 --> 05:27:23,480
We are going to wait for this last guy

5822
05:27:23,480 --> 05:27:25,480
To come out on his own

5823
05:27:25,480 --> 05:27:27,480
Because if you actually go in there

5824
05:27:27,480 --> 05:27:29,480
There is a high chance of him just like straight up

5825
05:27:29,480 --> 05:27:31,480
Turning around and looking at you

5826
05:27:31,480 --> 05:27:33,480
And then you have to replay this little section again

5827
05:27:33,480 --> 05:27:35,480
Don't recommend it up to you

5828
05:27:35,480 --> 05:27:37,480
But he will notice the body

5829
05:27:37,480 --> 05:27:39,480
And then you get the perfect kill

5830
05:27:39,480 --> 05:27:41,480
I'm going to loot his body

5831
05:27:41,480 --> 05:27:43,480
Just because again we are a bit low on crossbow bolts

5832
05:27:43,480 --> 05:27:45,480
What the fuck is

5833
05:27:45,480 --> 05:27:47,480
And then you just need to jump down

5834
05:27:47,480 --> 05:27:49,480
On this little

5835
05:27:49,480 --> 05:27:51,480
How do you call it

5836
05:27:51,480 --> 05:27:53,480
Hanging

5837
05:27:53,480 --> 05:27:55,480
Okay

5838
05:27:55,480 --> 05:27:57,480
Or just don't touch

5839
05:27:57,480 --> 05:27:59,480
Any of it and land on your ankles

5840
05:27:59,480 --> 05:28:01,480
Perfectly fine, don't need them

5841
05:28:01,480 --> 05:28:03,480
Just completely ignore everything

5842
05:28:03,480 --> 05:28:05,480
My goodness

5843
05:28:05,480 --> 05:28:07,480
You saw me reach my armor

5844
05:28:11,480 --> 05:28:13,480
Just fall to the floor

5845
05:28:13,480 --> 05:28:15,480
Literally splat

5846
05:28:15,480 --> 05:28:17,480
You may notice that our health bar

5847
05:28:17,480 --> 05:28:19,480
Is increasing even though I'm not

5848
05:28:19,480 --> 05:28:21,480
Buying any new armor or anything

5849
05:28:21,480 --> 05:28:23,480
That's because after every act

5850
05:28:23,480 --> 05:28:25,480
You unlock a new health bar

5851
05:28:25,480 --> 05:28:27,480
So it's not necessary to use your

5852
05:28:27,480 --> 05:28:29,480
Florence on

5853
05:28:29,480 --> 05:28:31,480
Armor but

5854
05:28:31,480 --> 05:28:33,480
If you definitely are new to the

5855
05:28:33,480 --> 05:28:35,480
Assassin's Creed it helps out so much

5856
05:28:35,480 --> 05:28:37,480
It's fantastic and please

5857
05:28:37,480 --> 05:28:39,480
Utilize the tailor's

5858
05:28:39,480 --> 05:28:41,480
Shops because tailor's shops

5859
05:28:41,480 --> 05:28:43,480
Have pouches that increase

5860
05:28:43,480 --> 05:28:45,480
How much medicine you can hold

5861
05:28:45,480 --> 05:28:47,480
How much throwing

5862
05:28:47,480 --> 05:28:49,480
Knives, how many crossbow bolts for example

5863
05:28:53,480 --> 05:28:55,480
I cannot recommend this game

5864
05:28:55,480 --> 05:28:57,480
Seriously

5865
05:28:57,480 --> 05:28:59,480
It's about 8 hours total

5866
05:28:59,480 --> 05:29:01,480
For campaign if you just ignore everything

5867
05:29:01,480 --> 05:29:03,480
If you want to have a good time and explore

5868
05:29:03,480 --> 05:29:05,480
You could easily pump

5869
05:29:05,480 --> 05:29:07,480
Maybe 16 hours

5870
05:29:07,480 --> 05:29:09,480
It's good

5871
05:29:09,480 --> 05:29:11,480
Good game

5872
05:29:11,480 --> 05:29:13,480
My knees could never do that

5873
05:29:13,480 --> 05:29:15,480
No, I don't think anyone's knees

5874
05:29:15,480 --> 05:29:17,480
Could have accomplished such a feat

5875
05:29:17,480 --> 05:29:19,480
Although I could have sworn

5876
05:29:19,480 --> 05:29:21,480
I saw some videos

5877
05:29:21,480 --> 05:29:23,480
Of like

5878
05:29:23,480 --> 05:29:25,480
You know in Portal 2

5879
05:29:25,480 --> 05:29:27,480
The apparatus that's on the legs

5880
05:29:27,480 --> 05:29:29,480
To stop any fall damage from occurring

5881
05:29:29,480 --> 05:29:31,480
I'm sure someone was developing that tech

5882
05:29:31,480 --> 05:29:33,480
At one point

5883
05:29:33,480 --> 05:29:35,480
Like maybe for super soldier

5884
05:29:35,480 --> 05:29:37,480
But yeah

5885
05:29:39,480 --> 05:29:41,480
Are you on steam?

5886
05:29:41,480 --> 05:29:43,480
Yeah, I'm playing on steam right now

5887
05:29:43,480 --> 05:29:45,480
I was gonna try

5888
05:29:45,480 --> 05:29:47,480
And do

5889
05:29:47,480 --> 05:29:49,480
Do an Xbox Game Pass

5890
05:29:49,480 --> 05:29:51,480
But it's not currently on it right now

5891
05:29:51,480 --> 05:29:53,480
So

5892
05:29:53,480 --> 05:29:55,480
We don't get the gamer score

5893
05:29:55,480 --> 05:29:57,480
You cannot say Pietro

5894
05:29:57,480 --> 05:29:59,480
Yeah

5895
05:29:59,480 --> 05:30:01,480
The wine he drank was poison

5896
05:30:01,480 --> 05:30:03,480
As I promised Cesare

5897
05:30:03,480 --> 05:30:05,480
Poison stinky

5898
05:30:05,480 --> 05:30:07,480
Can anyone look up

5899
05:30:07,480 --> 05:30:09,480
If Cuttlefish have poison

5900
05:30:09,480 --> 05:30:11,480
I don't know my lore

5901
05:30:11,480 --> 05:30:13,480
I did not come here to kill you

5902
05:30:13,480 --> 05:30:15,480
Maybe my poison can...

5903
05:30:15,480 --> 05:30:17,480
Oh, well I do ink, but is ink poisonous?

5904
05:30:17,480 --> 05:30:19,480
No, it's a deterrent

5905
05:30:19,480 --> 05:30:21,480
Cause I can be preyed upon

5906
05:30:21,480 --> 05:30:23,480
So ink is to hate me

5907
05:30:23,480 --> 05:30:25,480
I can be

5908
05:30:25,480 --> 05:30:27,480
Heck yeah I can

5909
05:30:27,480 --> 05:30:29,480
You know see my teeth

5910
05:30:29,480 --> 05:30:31,480
This was not in rehearsal

5911
05:30:31,480 --> 05:30:33,480
I wish I had aim like that

5912
05:30:33,480 --> 05:30:35,480
That's cool

5913
05:30:35,480 --> 05:30:37,480
Actually that's a really

5914
05:30:37,480 --> 05:30:39,480
I would

5915
05:30:39,480 --> 05:30:41,480
No

5916
05:30:41,480 --> 05:30:43,480
Maybe

5917
05:30:43,480 --> 05:30:45,480
Do you think we could set up axe throwing

5918
05:30:45,480 --> 05:30:47,480
At a VTuber convention?

5919
05:30:47,480 --> 05:30:49,480
I feel like that would be so fun

5920
05:30:49,480 --> 05:30:51,480
Legend of people

5921
05:30:51,480 --> 05:30:53,480
Like can hit the spot or not

5922
05:30:53,480 --> 05:30:55,480
I feel like it's so specific

5923
05:30:55,480 --> 05:30:57,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa Jesus

5924
05:30:57,480 --> 05:30:59,480
Pick him up, pick him up

5925
05:30:59,480 --> 05:31:01,480
Quite literally Jesus

5926
05:31:01,480 --> 05:31:03,480
Oh his health is going down

5927
05:31:03,480 --> 05:31:05,480
Cause of the poison

5928
05:31:05,480 --> 05:31:07,480
I've never noticed that before

5929
05:31:09,480 --> 05:31:11,480
Other way

5930
05:31:11,480 --> 05:31:13,480
Sorry assassin recruits

5931
05:31:13,480 --> 05:31:15,480
I'm gonna need you to like hurry up and perish

5932
05:31:15,480 --> 05:31:17,480
These people like right now Pietro is

5933
05:31:17,480 --> 05:31:19,480
Oh

5934
05:31:21,480 --> 05:31:23,480
That's a reefling

5935
05:31:23,480 --> 05:31:25,480
After I'm done with him in the ASMR booth

5936
05:31:33,480 --> 05:31:35,480
If you team up a company that does axe throwing

5937
05:31:37,480 --> 05:31:39,480
Me next

5938
05:31:39,480 --> 05:31:41,480
Me next

5939
05:31:45,480 --> 05:31:47,480
This is me giving you cola

5940
05:31:47,480 --> 05:31:49,480
To make you feel better

5941
05:31:49,480 --> 05:31:51,480
Give me the keys

5942
05:31:53,480 --> 05:31:55,480
The castello

5943
05:31:55,480 --> 05:31:57,480
Oh did I tell you that

5944
05:31:57,480 --> 05:31:59,480
After

5945
05:32:15,480 --> 05:32:17,480
It's the real traitor

5946
05:32:17,480 --> 05:32:19,480
It's not Marquia Valley at all

5947
05:32:21,480 --> 05:32:23,480
It's you

5948
05:32:23,480 --> 05:32:25,480
Random thief from cutscene

5949
05:32:25,480 --> 05:32:27,480
Oh no

5950
05:32:27,480 --> 05:32:29,480
No, no, no, no

5951
05:32:29,480 --> 05:32:31,480
Horse, please

5952
05:32:31,480 --> 05:32:33,480
Please

5953
05:32:33,480 --> 05:32:35,480
I can't chase my horse right now

5954
05:32:35,480 --> 05:32:37,480
I don't know

5955
05:32:37,480 --> 05:32:39,480
I think if I fail this section

5956
05:32:39,480 --> 05:32:41,480
If you jump you can jump past the guards

5957
05:32:41,480 --> 05:32:43,480
In the AI no longer targets you

5958
05:32:43,480 --> 05:32:45,480
I don't know why

5959
05:32:45,480 --> 05:32:47,480
I'm scared

5960
05:32:47,480 --> 05:32:49,480
I can hear the horse going

5961
05:32:49,480 --> 05:32:51,480
Please

5962
05:32:51,480 --> 05:32:53,480
Please

5963
05:32:53,480 --> 05:32:55,480
Please leave me alone

5964
05:32:55,480 --> 05:32:57,480
Leave me alone

5965
05:32:57,480 --> 05:32:59,480
Leave me alone

5966
05:32:59,480 --> 05:33:01,480
Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse

5967
05:33:01,480 --> 05:33:03,480
At least

5968
05:33:03,480 --> 05:33:05,480
Come here

5969
05:33:05,480 --> 05:33:07,480
Come Heather

5970
05:33:07,480 --> 05:33:09,480
Move on

5971
05:33:15,480 --> 05:33:17,480
Oh

5972
05:33:19,480 --> 05:33:21,480
That's awful

5973
05:33:27,480 --> 05:33:29,480
Where'd I go?

5974
05:33:29,480 --> 05:33:31,480
The green on the map

5975
05:33:31,480 --> 05:33:33,480
I can't remember the section very well

5976
05:33:35,480 --> 05:33:37,480
I think I can run

5977
05:33:39,480 --> 05:33:41,480
If we do not stop

5978
05:33:41,480 --> 05:33:43,480
Lavofi

5979
05:33:43,480 --> 05:33:45,480
No

5980
05:33:45,480 --> 05:33:47,480
To 100%

5981
05:33:47,480 --> 05:33:49,480
You're not to swim

5982
05:33:49,480 --> 05:33:51,480
No, don't pick

5983
05:33:51,480 --> 05:33:53,480
Jesus

5984
05:33:53,480 --> 05:33:55,480
Goodness

5985
05:33:55,480 --> 05:33:57,480
Gravy

5986
05:33:57,480 --> 05:33:59,480
Oh my god, I'm taking the long way

5987
05:33:59,480 --> 05:34:01,480
Around

5988
05:34:01,480 --> 05:34:03,480
Panic

5989
05:34:05,480 --> 05:34:07,480
What are you doing

5990
05:34:07,480 --> 05:34:09,480
Why would you randomly grab

5991
05:34:09,480 --> 05:34:11,480
That poor man's horse

5992
05:34:11,480 --> 05:34:13,480
Climb the wall

5993
05:34:13,480 --> 05:34:15,480
And steal

5994
05:34:15,480 --> 05:34:17,480
Please, that's a tamed machine

5995
05:34:17,480 --> 05:34:19,480
They stress me out so much

5996
05:34:19,480 --> 05:34:21,480
Please, I just want 100%

5997
05:34:21,480 --> 05:34:23,480
So I never have to do it again

5998
05:34:23,480 --> 05:34:25,480
Please, please, please

5999
05:34:25,480 --> 05:34:27,480
Why would you randomly take that poor man's horse

6000
05:34:31,480 --> 05:34:33,480
I get too stressed

6001
05:34:33,480 --> 05:34:35,480
I hate them

6002
05:34:35,480 --> 05:34:37,480
I hate them

6003
05:34:37,480 --> 05:34:39,480
Oh my god

6004
05:34:39,480 --> 05:34:41,480
This is good news

6005
05:34:41,480 --> 05:34:43,480
More than you know

6006
05:34:43,480 --> 05:34:45,480
I am once again in your debt, Ezio

6007
05:34:45,480 --> 05:34:47,480
What debt is that amongst friends

6008
05:34:47,480 --> 05:34:49,480
Trust one another

6009
05:34:49,480 --> 05:34:51,480
Yes

6010
05:34:51,480 --> 05:34:53,480
Thank you for relaying the message to me

6011
05:34:53,480 --> 05:34:55,480
That poor man's horse

6012
05:34:55,480 --> 05:34:57,480
Okay

6013
05:34:57,480 --> 05:34:59,480
Lavofi and Markioville

6014
05:35:01,480 --> 05:35:03,480
Now trust each other

6015
05:35:03,480 --> 05:35:05,480
It seems Jezu Cristo was

6016
05:35:05,480 --> 05:35:07,480
That is erected three days ago

6017
05:35:09,480 --> 05:35:11,480
Ta-da

6018
05:35:11,480 --> 05:35:13,480
Checkpoint reach

6019
05:35:13,480 --> 05:35:15,480
That's not the end

6020
05:35:15,480 --> 05:35:17,480
It is the end of that

6021
05:35:17,480 --> 05:35:19,480
We're just being teased

6022
05:35:19,480 --> 05:35:21,480
Crazy man's

6023
05:35:21,480 --> 05:35:23,480
Steal's horse jumps off and runs up wall

6024
05:35:23,480 --> 05:35:25,480
Literally if you hit

6025
05:35:25,480 --> 05:35:27,480
Like a graphic thing

6026
05:35:27,480 --> 05:35:29,480
Like this at an angle

6027
05:35:29,480 --> 05:35:31,480
Ezio refuses to climb

6028
05:35:31,480 --> 05:35:33,480
In the wall and it gives me a heart attack

6029
05:35:33,480 --> 05:35:35,480
Every time

6030
05:35:37,480 --> 05:35:39,480
Look, our thieves are in the

6031
05:35:39,480 --> 05:35:41,480
Our recruits are in the background

6032
05:35:41,480 --> 05:35:43,480
Look, it's you in the background

6033
05:35:43,480 --> 05:35:45,480
It's you in the cutscene

6034
05:35:45,480 --> 05:35:47,480
Not right now

6035
05:35:47,480 --> 05:35:49,480
I can't see them

6036
05:35:53,480 --> 05:35:55,480
It is pain

6037
05:35:55,480 --> 05:35:57,480
Claudia is going to become an assassin

6038
05:36:01,480 --> 05:36:03,480
We work in the dark

6039
05:36:03,480 --> 05:36:05,480
To serve the light

6040
05:36:05,480 --> 05:36:07,480
Yeah, absolutely

6041
05:36:07,480 --> 05:36:09,480
Cannot say any of those words

6042
05:36:09,480 --> 05:36:11,480
Do not ask me to recite that

6043
05:36:11,480 --> 05:36:13,480
I can say that part

6044
05:36:13,480 --> 05:36:15,480
We're in our training

6045
05:36:15,480 --> 05:36:17,480
Oh my god, look at you all reflames

6046
05:36:17,480 --> 05:36:19,480
There's so many of you

6047
05:36:19,480 --> 05:36:21,480
Like, reflames is my system

6048
05:36:23,480 --> 05:36:25,480
I'm reciting it right now

6049
05:36:31,480 --> 05:36:33,480
I offer the choice to you

6050
05:36:33,480 --> 05:36:35,480
Join us

6051
05:36:35,480 --> 05:36:37,480
Oh my god, they're going to hold hands

6052
05:36:37,480 --> 05:36:39,480
Yay

6053
05:36:39,480 --> 05:36:41,480
She's an assassin

6054
05:36:41,480 --> 05:36:43,480
If you get an assassin, you have to be branded

6055
05:36:43,480 --> 05:36:45,480
On your wedding ringer

6056
05:36:45,480 --> 05:36:47,480
Wedding finger

6057
05:36:47,480 --> 05:36:49,480
Where the ring goes

6058
05:36:51,480 --> 05:36:53,480
Is your sister single?

6059
05:36:53,480 --> 05:36:55,480
Hi, Claudia

6060
05:36:55,480 --> 05:36:59,480
You and I have not seen eye to eye on many issues

6061
05:36:59,480 --> 05:37:03,480
But you are exactly what the order means

6062
05:37:03,480 --> 05:37:05,480
We cannot promote it

6063
05:37:05,480 --> 05:37:07,480
You have led the charge against the Templars

6064
05:37:07,480 --> 05:37:09,480
And rebuilt this brother

6065
05:37:09,480 --> 05:37:11,480
Now we must put Ezio where he belongs

6066
05:37:11,480 --> 05:37:13,480
A refling

6067
05:37:13,480 --> 05:37:15,480
Oh my god, his reflames crowning me

6068
05:37:15,480 --> 05:37:17,480
As their Ushides

6069
05:37:17,480 --> 05:37:19,480
Ezio Auditore da Fivenze

6070
05:37:19,480 --> 05:37:21,480
You will now be known as Il Mentore

6071
05:37:21,480 --> 05:37:23,480
The guardian of our order

6072
05:37:23,480 --> 05:37:25,480
And our secrets

6073
05:37:27,480 --> 05:37:29,480
No, I can't be Kama Oshi

6074
05:37:29,480 --> 05:37:31,480
I don't mind Oshi, but Kama Oshi is impossible

6075
05:37:31,480 --> 05:37:33,480
To live up to, that's not possible

6076
05:37:33,480 --> 05:37:35,480
Remember, nothing is true

6077
05:37:35,480 --> 05:37:37,480
Everything is permanent

6078
05:37:37,480 --> 05:37:41,480
Where other men are limited by morality and law

6079
05:37:41,480 --> 05:37:43,480
Remember, everything is permitted

6080
05:37:43,480 --> 05:37:45,480
Everything is permitted

6081
05:37:47,480 --> 05:37:49,480
It's Ezio before or after, he is after

6082
05:37:49,480 --> 05:37:51,480
Altair is like

6083
05:37:51,480 --> 05:37:53,480
I don't even know what century Altair is

6084
05:37:53,480 --> 05:37:55,480
Why this sudden change of heart?

6085
05:37:55,480 --> 05:37:57,480
I'm a cameo assassin

6086
05:37:57,480 --> 05:37:59,480
I always should buy

6087
05:37:59,480 --> 05:38:01,480
I was the one who brought you to Roma

6088
05:38:01,480 --> 05:38:03,480
And the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello

6089
05:38:03,480 --> 05:38:05,480
What?

6090
05:38:05,480 --> 05:38:09,480
The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well

6091
05:38:09,480 --> 05:38:11,480
You just did not know it

6092
05:38:11,480 --> 05:38:15,480
Maestro Mattiavelli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone

6093
05:38:15,480 --> 05:38:17,480
He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo

6094
05:38:17,480 --> 05:38:19,480
Thank you

6095
05:38:19,480 --> 05:38:23,480
The decision is yours, not mine

6096
05:38:23,480 --> 05:38:27,480
Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think

6097
05:38:27,480 --> 05:38:31,480
Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?

6098
05:38:31,480 --> 05:38:33,480
Go kill them, Mentore

6099
05:38:33,480 --> 05:38:35,480
Finish what you start

6100
05:38:35,480 --> 05:38:37,480
Good advice

6101
05:38:39,480 --> 05:38:41,480
I'll tell you right about the book about you one day

6102
05:38:41,480 --> 05:38:43,480
If you do

6103
05:38:43,480 --> 05:38:45,480
You might wish you since day one just accept it

6104
05:38:45,480 --> 05:38:47,480
I don't get how

6105
05:38:49,480 --> 05:38:53,480
You tell me you consumed all of these content creators

6106
05:38:53,480 --> 05:38:55,480
And you're like

6107
05:38:55,480 --> 05:38:57,480
Yeah, that one

6108
05:38:57,480 --> 05:38:59,480
Out of them all

6109
05:38:59,480 --> 05:39:01,480
We have finished sequence seven

6110
05:39:01,480 --> 05:39:03,480
There are two more sequences

6111
05:39:03,480 --> 05:39:07,480
And then we've done the campaign

6112
05:39:07,480 --> 05:39:09,480
It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought

6113
05:39:09,480 --> 05:39:11,480
I've still got a couple more hours in me

6114
05:39:11,480 --> 05:39:13,480
Okay

6115
05:39:13,480 --> 05:39:15,480
When it clicks it clicks

6116
05:39:15,480 --> 05:39:19,480
You don't pick the Oshi, the Oshi does pick you

6117
05:39:19,480 --> 05:39:21,480
When you know you know

6118
05:39:21,480 --> 05:39:23,480
Wait, the game is really that short

6119
05:39:23,480 --> 05:39:27,480
If you ignore everything and do campaign only

6120
05:39:27,480 --> 05:39:29,480
Send it on the campaign then

6121
05:39:29,480 --> 05:39:31,480
On it's way

6122
05:39:31,480 --> 05:39:35,480
Pretty, you can wrap up

6123
05:39:35,480 --> 05:39:37,480
Real quick

6124
05:39:37,480 --> 05:39:41,480
I am going to destroy another tower

6125
05:39:41,480 --> 05:39:45,480
Because I want to unlock this third signal

6126
05:39:45,480 --> 05:39:47,480
And then we will

6127
05:39:47,480 --> 05:39:49,480
Actually, you know what

6128
05:39:49,480 --> 05:39:53,480
I'm going to send my assassins on a mission

6129
05:39:53,480 --> 05:39:55,480
I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea

6130
05:39:55,480 --> 05:39:57,480
And get some food

6131
05:39:57,480 --> 05:39:59,480
And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves

6132
05:39:59,480 --> 05:40:01,480
A little tea break

6133
05:40:01,480 --> 05:40:05,480
Let's send some of the wee

6134
05:40:05,480 --> 05:40:07,480
Like everyone for that one mission

6135
05:40:07,480 --> 05:40:11,480
No ideal, but it's fine

6136
05:40:11,480 --> 05:40:13,480
Can you 100% not?

6137
05:40:13,480 --> 05:40:15,480
You can, so that will be a level up

6138
05:40:15,480 --> 05:40:18,480
Right, everyone

6139
05:40:18,480 --> 05:40:20,480
I don't want to be too close to the pigeons

6140
05:40:20,480 --> 05:40:22,480
Because they literally go

6141
05:40:22,480 --> 05:40:24,480
In your ear

6142
05:40:24,480 --> 05:40:26,480
Hopefully that's not too bad

6143
05:40:26,480 --> 05:40:28,480
For ambience

6144
05:40:28,480 --> 05:40:31,480
Everyone, please do consider standing up

6145
05:40:31,480 --> 05:40:34,480
And getting your legs and blood flow going

6146
05:40:34,480 --> 05:40:35,480
Or wiggle your toes

6147
05:40:35,480 --> 05:40:36,480
If you're that lazy

6148
05:40:36,480 --> 05:40:38,480
Stretch your feet and pull them back and forth

6149
05:40:38,480 --> 05:40:41,480
So your muscles and your calves

6150
05:40:41,480 --> 05:40:43,480
Like come back and forth

6151
05:40:43,480 --> 05:40:45,480
Go for a peep, get some water

6152
05:40:45,480 --> 05:40:47,480
Some snacks, some juicy juice

6153
05:40:47,480 --> 05:40:49,480
Hypotenuse

6154
05:40:49,480 --> 05:40:53,480
And I will be back in roughly

6155
05:40:53,480 --> 05:40:55,480
Three minutes

6156
05:40:55,480 --> 05:40:57,480
I'm going to try and heat up ravioli

6157
05:40:57,480 --> 05:41:00,480
Like fast as anything

6158
05:41:00,480 --> 05:41:02,480
So I will be a moment

6159
05:41:02,480 --> 05:41:04,480
I would like to watch Emi while she does ASMR live

6160
05:41:04,480 --> 05:41:06,480
Her link is in my description

6161
05:41:06,480 --> 05:41:08,480
You can do that right now, okay?

6162
05:41:08,480 --> 05:41:10,480
I will do the old pretending to sleep

6163
05:41:10,480 --> 05:41:13,480
And then I'll open up the game again, okay?

6164
05:41:13,480 --> 05:41:15,480
So don't worry

6165
05:41:15,480 --> 05:41:17,480
Don't worry about it

6166
05:41:20,480 --> 05:41:22,480
It caused my eyes

6167
05:41:32,480 --> 05:41:34,480
It caused my eyes

6168
05:41:34,480 --> 05:41:36,480
It caused my eyes

6169
05:41:36,480 --> 05:41:38,480
It caused my eyes

6170
05:41:38,480 --> 05:41:40,480
It caused my eyes

6171
05:41:40,480 --> 05:41:42,480
It caused my eyes

6172
05:41:42,480 --> 05:41:44,480
It caused my eyes

6173
05:41:44,480 --> 05:41:46,480
It caused my eyes

6174
05:41:46,480 --> 05:41:48,480
It caused my eyes

6175
05:41:48,480 --> 05:41:50,480
It caused my eyes

6176
05:41:50,480 --> 05:41:52,480
It caused my eyes

6177
05:41:52,480 --> 05:41:54,480
It caused my eyes

6178
05:41:54,480 --> 05:41:56,480
It caused my eyes

6179
05:41:56,480 --> 05:41:58,480
It caused my eyes

6180
05:41:58,480 --> 05:42:00,480
It caused my eyes

6181
05:42:00,480 --> 05:42:02,480
It caused my eyes

6182
05:42:02,480 --> 05:42:04,480
It caused my eyes

6183
05:42:04,480 --> 05:42:06,480
It caused my eyes

6184
05:42:06,480 --> 05:42:08,480
It caused my eyes

6185
05:42:08,480 --> 05:42:10,480
It caused my eyes

6186
05:42:10,480 --> 05:42:12,480
It caused my eyes

6187
05:42:12,480 --> 05:42:14,480
It caused my eyes

6188
05:42:14,480 --> 05:42:16,480
It caused my eyes

6189
05:42:16,480 --> 05:42:18,480
It caused my eyes

6190
05:42:18,480 --> 05:42:20,480
It caused my eyes

6191
05:42:20,480 --> 05:42:22,480
It caused my eyes

6192
05:42:22,480 --> 05:42:24,480
It caused my eyes

6193
05:42:24,480 --> 05:42:26,480
It caused my eyes

6194
05:42:26,480 --> 05:42:28,480
It caused my eyes

6195
05:42:28,480 --> 05:42:30,480
It caused my eyes

6196
05:42:30,480 --> 05:42:32,480
It caused my eyes

6197
05:42:32,480 --> 05:42:34,480
It caused my eyes

6198
05:42:34,480 --> 05:42:36,480
It caused my eyes

6199
05:42:36,480 --> 05:42:38,480
It caused my eyes

6200
05:42:38,480 --> 05:42:40,480
It caused my eyes

6201
05:42:40,480 --> 05:42:42,480
It caused my eyes

6202
05:42:42,480 --> 05:42:44,480
It caused my eyes

6203
05:42:44,480 --> 05:42:46,480
It caused my eyes

6204
05:42:46,480 --> 05:42:48,480
It caused my eyes

6205
05:42:48,480 --> 05:42:50,480
It caused my eyes

6206
05:42:50,480 --> 05:42:52,480
It caused my eyes

6207
05:42:52,480 --> 05:42:54,480
It caused my eyes

6208
05:42:54,480 --> 05:42:56,480
It caused my eyes

6209
05:42:56,480 --> 05:42:58,480
It caused my eyes

6210
05:42:58,480 --> 05:43:00,480
It caused my eyes

6211
05:43:00,480 --> 05:43:02,480
It caused my eyes

6212
05:43:02,480 --> 05:43:04,480
It caused my eyes

6213
05:43:04,480 --> 05:43:06,480
It caused my eyes

6214
05:43:06,480 --> 05:43:08,480
It caused my eyes

6215
05:43:08,480 --> 05:43:10,480
It caused my eyes

6216
05:43:10,480 --> 05:43:12,480
It caused my eyes

6217

6400
05:52:36,760 --> 05:52:45,680
from like, is it Mardi Gras? Like that party that Americans have where you unveil yourself and you

6401
05:52:45,680 --> 05:52:50,160
get beats as a reward? Like, I think that's where that saying might have came from because that just

6402
05:52:50,160 --> 05:52:55,440
makes sense. Like, oh, I'm sweating my beats off because I'm like showing the goods so much and so

6403
05:52:55,520 --> 05:53:06,880
often. Right, where on earth has this captain? I really don't want to mess it up because if you

6404
05:53:06,880 --> 05:53:15,280
mess it up and he runs away in time, you have to wait until the following day. Oh, I think I know

6405
05:53:15,280 --> 05:53:21,120
who this one is. I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. No, see, oh, you know the guy

6406
05:53:21,200 --> 05:53:27,680
that can see you right now? I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him, but he can lock onto me.

6407
05:53:27,680 --> 05:53:39,760
See you stinky AI. Perish. Oh, beats of sweat that come off your head. Oh, you know what? Yeah,

6408
05:53:39,760 --> 05:53:45,840
now that you've said that, that makes more sense. Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is. Okay,

6409
05:53:46,560 --> 05:53:50,720
where's, yes, I knew it was this one.

6410
05:53:53,520 --> 05:54:03,040
Do we assassinate him from above is my question? I don't know. I normally have three signals at

6411
05:54:03,040 --> 05:54:08,560
this point, which means I can do a raining down effect. Did he really say where did I go?

6412
05:54:09,280 --> 05:54:18,080
Great. Right, if I can ear assassinate him, this isn't a problem. If I can lock onto him,

6413
05:54:18,080 --> 05:54:28,960
I am very tall up to lock onto him though. No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him. Yeah? Uh-huh.

6414
05:54:29,920 --> 05:54:41,120
No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, that was so good. Oh, and none of the guards want to defend. That's

6415
05:54:41,120 --> 05:54:49,840
hilarious. All the guards are like, that, that man just came out of the sky. We are not, we are

6416
05:54:49,920 --> 05:54:57,920
retreating right now. Does your room have per ventilation? That's horrendous ventilation.

6417
05:55:00,880 --> 05:55:07,840
Unfortunately, I'm renting. So I have like absolutely no input or like anything I could

6418
05:55:07,840 --> 05:55:20,400
really do about it. Rip in pepperoni. He craves the drop. Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted

6419
05:55:20,400 --> 05:55:28,880
because my tea's gonna get too cold and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm. I am going to ignite

6420
05:55:28,880 --> 05:55:40,480
the, gonna light this place up and then we're gone. Oh, you're edging me and not the good kind.

6421
05:55:44,160 --> 05:55:47,280
Are the windows open? No, the window's freaking broken.

6422
05:55:50,080 --> 05:55:54,720
Like the landlord has been really nice to me and he's like left me alone. It's not like one of

6423
05:55:54,720 --> 05:56:00,560
them annoying landlords that are like trying to like trail through your place all the time. But

6424
05:56:01,760 --> 05:56:08,240
obviously whenever you visit somewhere to rent and you like inspect it, you don't actually know

6425
05:56:08,240 --> 05:56:15,120
what's wrong with the place until you move in and like they're obviously, I discovered like

6426
05:56:15,120 --> 05:56:23,680
windows are broken, the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is, is not like ideal.

6427
05:56:23,680 --> 05:56:29,520
Are you guys okay if I hide in this table whilst I drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.

6428
05:56:29,520 --> 05:56:35,360
Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice. I might just drink it real quick. I apologize.

6429
05:56:43,680 --> 05:56:53,280
Oh, that shit's so good. It's apple banana, lychee mango juice smoothing. So I'm getting all my

6430
05:56:53,280 --> 05:56:59,280
fruit in one drink because I don't really, I don't really eat fruit that often. I like

6431
05:56:59,280 --> 05:57:03,760
waste fruit, so I feel bad. Oh my god, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.

6432
05:57:12,800 --> 05:57:16,320
Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged an ace marco club with this morning.

6433
05:57:17,040 --> 05:57:19,040
They've just showed up in chat.

6434
05:57:24,640 --> 05:57:32,640
It's very likely. That'll be my first official club with a VTuber. I've got DEMP on the list.

6435
05:57:33,360 --> 05:57:39,840
I'm hunting down everyone with 3DS. I'm serious about that goal. I'm arranging them all. We'll

6436
05:57:39,840 --> 05:57:45,200
make it nice and easy. Gonna be doing my best. So hopefully you guys eat good and you can sleep

6437
05:57:45,200 --> 05:57:54,400
to my soothing Scottish accent. That's right, wee laddie. Time to go to sleep. Are you tingling,

6438
05:57:54,400 --> 05:58:02,480
tingle, tingle, tingle. Oh my god, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.

6439
05:58:02,800 --> 05:58:11,120
I should actually do like 4 Scots accent on an ace marco club. That would be hilarious.

6440
05:58:14,000 --> 05:58:16,240
I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.

6441
05:58:19,600 --> 05:58:22,080
What should I eat first? Should I eat an egg? I think so.

6442
05:58:24,160 --> 05:58:26,640
I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.

6443
05:58:27,600 --> 05:58:36,400
To say something was delicious in Scots, you say it was braw and that was braw. That drink was

6444
05:58:36,400 --> 05:58:44,720
delicious. You keep mocking your accent. Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent

6445
05:58:44,720 --> 05:58:51,520
hot. I would say like hot accents like unironically like French Italian or normally like rated quite

6446
05:58:51,520 --> 05:58:57,200
highly. I have taken a bite of a meat stick. I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.

6447
05:58:58,240 --> 05:59:06,640
I need to eat. I want you to read Go The F to sleep in your accent. That'd be good.

6448
05:59:06,800 --> 05:59:12,160
Is Valley Girl scrawny real?

6449
05:59:13,120 --> 05:59:24,400
Hi guys. I'm so totally excited to be here. Yeah, I'm Valley Girl. I laugh at everything.

6450
05:59:25,920 --> 05:59:32,400
Yeah, that's the best you can. Yeah, you like that? Is that what you want? I'm scared.

6451
05:59:32,400 --> 05:59:42,080
I want to perish. Valley Girl scrawny. Say in it, brav. Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?

6452
05:59:46,000 --> 05:59:47,520
No, I don't think so.

6453
05:59:50,720 --> 05:59:58,400
No, I don't think so. I didn't think so. No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do in

6454
05:59:58,400 --> 06:00:08,560
order to keep the accent, but make it different. Brain kind of. You're not hypnotizing us. Scottish

6455
06:00:08,560 --> 06:00:15,600
accents are hot. I'm eating the meat. I'm now baiting the egg. I'm just going to touch it.

6456
06:00:15,600 --> 06:00:28,720
I just said fucking delicious. I have earned, oh my god, a bite of the egg and the meat at the same

6457
06:00:28,720 --> 06:00:40,800
time. I have earned this, okay? I have earned this. As I almost choke on it, hey ho, there's a first

6458
06:00:40,800 --> 06:00:48,640
time for everything. It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British. I don't know what the equivalent

6459
06:00:48,640 --> 06:00:56,080
is in America or it's a twizy stick in Australia. Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest. I've

6460
06:00:56,080 --> 06:01:08,080
been at this for hours. He's sleeping in the hay. Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth...

6461
06:01:11,040 --> 06:01:12,800
Ah, that's cool.

6462
06:01:16,800 --> 06:01:23,600
Like my mouth is closed right now, but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.

6463
06:01:30,000 --> 06:01:32,080
A slim gym, probably.

6464
06:01:41,520 --> 06:01:50,080
Would you like some sweet chili pea snack that's been baked?

6465
06:02:06,160 --> 06:02:08,080
Okay, open up.

6466
06:02:11,040 --> 06:02:20,160
Mm-hmm. I hope you guys stretched, because if you haven't stretched, that's you sat for six hours

6467
06:02:20,160 --> 06:02:26,080
and you're supposed to stretch. If anyone's in a wheelchair, you're exempt from these instructions.

6468
06:02:26,880 --> 06:02:31,360
Mm-hmm.

6469
06:02:37,200 --> 06:02:39,360
I stretched and all my limbs dislocated.

6470
06:02:42,400 --> 06:02:46,080
You're not going to fall for that one stare? Well, you're going to split, aren't you?

6471
06:02:46,400 --> 06:02:47,520
Ah, the stare.

6472
06:02:49,920 --> 06:02:52,880
Oh, my God. I don't know if I can read that out.

6473
06:02:55,440 --> 06:02:56,960
When is booty inspection day?

6474
06:03:01,280 --> 06:03:04,320
A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.

6475
06:03:04,480 --> 06:03:16,720
I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked. Two meat sticks and two eggs,

6476
06:03:16,720 --> 06:03:20,080
and I've got one meat and egg left, and I'm just munching on the peas.

6477
06:03:25,520 --> 06:03:30,880
Oh, my God. So for years, I had no idea what Charlie horse meant.

6478
06:03:35,200 --> 06:03:42,560
It's just called the pulled muscle, and I was like, what on earth is a Charlie horse?

6479
06:03:43,280 --> 06:03:48,960
Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie? Why is it happening to people? That's not possible.

6480
06:03:49,760 --> 06:03:54,880
I was like, it's crazy. And then I finally figured it out because I watched like a meme,

6481
06:03:54,880 --> 06:03:59,600
and the guy like fell over, and he was like, oh, oh, Charlie horse.

6482
06:04:00,400 --> 06:04:04,320
And like, because of his body language, my brain was like, oh, my God,

6483
06:04:04,320 --> 06:04:09,360
he's having a muscle spasm. That's what it means. Like,

6484
06:04:11,440 --> 06:04:16,240
oh, I need a burp. I'm so sorry. I'm eating, so it means I burp a lot. I'm jammy, if you don't like it.

6485
06:04:21,040 --> 06:04:27,920
I don't think a zero or mercy burp. I think they have manners and weren't raised in a barn like me.

6486
06:04:29,760 --> 06:04:38,400
I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.

6487
06:04:41,680 --> 06:04:44,960
Ooh, money. We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.

6488
06:04:47,280 --> 06:04:49,840
Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.

6489
06:04:50,880 --> 06:04:56,560
Was that a meme on Family Guy? I don't know what it was. No, those ones are the different ones.

6490
06:04:56,560 --> 06:05:00,800
I learned from Mercy the other day that saying be there, be square is because you won't be around.

6491
06:05:02,960 --> 06:05:08,800
Wait, what? Be there or be square is because you won't be around.

6492
06:05:11,760 --> 06:05:22,560
Oh, that's so smart. Like around in a circle. Yeah. And like, you won't be around in the area

6493
06:05:22,560 --> 06:05:29,440
if you're not there because you're a square. Yeah. Oh, I just got that too. That's good. I like that.

6494
06:05:29,440 --> 06:05:35,200
Mercy smart. Shawnee, it's not manners. It's your cuttlebone. You're just into buoyancy. Yes,

6495
06:05:35,200 --> 06:05:38,480
this is my first time on land. Sometimes.

6496
06:05:38,480 --> 06:05:50,720
I'm careful. You don't want to make me too smart. I'll start coming up with new names.

6497
06:05:50,720 --> 06:05:55,200
Fond de la Bism. I'm never going to live down Fond de la Bism and be sucky.

6498
06:05:58,480 --> 06:06:02,880
What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony specific? Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.

6499
06:06:02,880 --> 06:06:06,640
Well, we do it at the end of stream because we're actually really close to finishing the game.

6500
06:06:06,640 --> 06:06:09,760
Like, we're really close to finishing the game.

6501
06:06:16,720 --> 06:06:19,760
Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.

6502
06:06:37,120 --> 06:06:43,920
I'm sorry, but I'm going to suck my fingers. I know some people don't like it

6503
06:06:43,920 --> 06:06:59,760
matter-wise, but I don't have a napkin. That remains me. I need to make the audio.

6504
06:06:59,760 --> 06:07:04,480
Okay. I inhaled the meat and the egg and then I finished my tea and then we're going to get

6505
06:07:04,480 --> 06:07:20,400
straight back and finish the stuff. I need like more charcuterie snack stuff for longer streams

6506
06:07:21,280 --> 06:07:23,120
because I don't have time to actually make food.

6507
06:07:23,280 --> 06:07:34,720
Maybe a cold pasta dish? I can pre-make.

6508
06:07:36,640 --> 06:07:40,640
The crunchy thing is the meat stick. It's got like a skin on it.

6509
06:07:44,000 --> 06:07:44,640
That's the meat.

6510
06:07:53,280 --> 06:08:00,320
I've got protein from the egg and protein from the meat and fats.

6511
06:08:01,600 --> 06:08:04,160
And the pea snacks are carbohydrates.

6512
06:08:12,320 --> 06:08:14,880
Yum yum yum. I'm going to get tons of hydration.

6513
06:08:17,280 --> 06:08:22,640
That's way too crunchy to be. It is meat. It is meat. I promise you it's meat.

6514
06:08:22,640 --> 06:08:25,040
It's like an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.

6515
06:08:30,640 --> 06:08:35,840
Okay, all the food is finished. I'm now for the tea.

6516
06:08:41,200 --> 06:08:48,400
Honestly, depending on how fast we go, we might actually finish the campaign in less than two

6517
06:08:49,200 --> 06:08:52,640
hours, but I'm quite happy to like fart about and do the Borgia Towers after.

6518
06:08:52,640 --> 06:08:57,920
Maybe like so we can like streamline tomorrow for doing the DNA sequence run.

6519
06:09:07,680 --> 06:09:09,440
I'm gonna let a big burp. I'm sorry.

6520
06:09:12,560 --> 06:09:17,200
That was good. Such good food. I really needed that and I hit the spot.

6521
06:09:19,360 --> 06:09:24,000
Mmm, a battered Mars four hand counts room. It's a honey tea.

6522
06:09:25,840 --> 06:09:33,600
Sorry, it all comes back up. I was going to record is tomorrow like your girlfriend for like

6523
06:09:33,600 --> 06:09:37,360
forgets to turn off the make. So it's just me munching and crunching because some people

6524
06:09:37,360 --> 06:09:44,000
like really enjoy like other people's like munching sounds. I'm like, if you are telling me that I can

6525
06:09:44,080 --> 06:09:51,680
order McDonald's and eat it on the mic and people would like be happy with that.

6526
06:09:51,680 --> 06:09:53,920
Like, uh, you don't got to tell me twice.

6527
06:09:56,640 --> 06:09:59,360
Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack that's easy to prepare, great.

6528
06:10:00,400 --> 06:10:07,360
I can't believe it. I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy and look after myself.

6529
06:10:08,000 --> 06:10:20,320
Oh, cruel. Honey tea. You boil those per beat. No, I love to be. I get to buy my honey from like,

6530
06:10:21,840 --> 06:10:24,880
I like smaller shop and I like supporting them on their own.

6531
06:10:26,640 --> 06:10:33,840
I sip my tea. Oh, yeah. That's roasting. It's still quite warm. Not gonna lie. I thought it was

6532
06:10:33,840 --> 06:10:42,720
gonna cool. Be a bit cooler. I'm okay. I'm okay though. Right, we're gonna go and get our

6533
06:10:42,720 --> 06:10:54,800
wanted taken off of us. Put that on the Herald. Thank you very much. You're about to stand in

6534
06:10:54,800 --> 06:11:05,920
some serious matter. Chicken nuggies ASMR. There's eating 100 chicken nuggets. Still a challenge.

6535
06:11:07,520 --> 06:11:12,560
I feel like you starve me and I could probably do that like in one go.

6536
06:11:16,240 --> 06:11:21,920
Have I bought this bank over here? I haven't. Investments, people. Investments.

6537
06:11:22,000 --> 06:11:29,840
That reminds me several years ago back when Tumblr was an important platform that some vegans

6538
06:11:29,840 --> 06:11:38,640
actually thought bees were physical harm for their honey. Oh, vegans just doing their thing.

6539
06:11:38,640 --> 06:11:49,680
They're nice, I guess. I just, yeah, vegans are vegans. I completely understand like the stands

6540
06:11:50,000 --> 06:11:54,960
no one actually wants any animals to be hurt or all that jazz. I just, you know,

6541
06:11:56,240 --> 06:12:01,840
I ask have you ever seen a healthy looking vegan when they're like I've been vegan for five years?

6542
06:12:02,480 --> 06:12:09,280
They look ill. I had a close family member that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years

6543
06:12:10,000 --> 06:12:17,440
and when they finally started to eat meat again, they were like healthy overnight. I'm so sorry.

6544
06:12:17,440 --> 06:12:20,880
I apologize if anyone is a vegan here but please seriously take your supplements,

6545
06:12:21,600 --> 06:12:27,360
look at what you need to in order to get what you need because please be careful. It's very

6546
06:12:27,360 --> 06:12:33,760
dangerous. I don't, I'm actually being serious for like for one millisecond. It is incredibly

6547
06:12:33,760 --> 06:12:38,880
dangerous to genuinely choose to be a vegan and a lot of people don't realize until it's too late

6548
06:12:39,120 --> 06:12:50,960
that like you are, like if you really want to get into it, like there's the caveman times before

6549
06:12:50,960 --> 06:12:56,560
we discovered what cooking, what cooked meat could do for us and like it's like, you know,

6550
06:12:56,560 --> 06:13:02,640
once humans had access to cooked meat, the brain power of humans like went up. I can't

6551
06:13:02,640 --> 06:13:06,640
remember what all like the details and what it's called and all that but like this is what I've

6552
06:13:06,640 --> 06:13:10,400
been taught and like I genuinely believe it. I'm sorry but if you've ever looked at a vegan,

6553
06:13:10,400 --> 06:13:16,080
they just look like a husk of a human and I'm so sorry if it's offensive but like it's just my

6554
06:13:16,080 --> 06:13:19,440
opinion but I never said I was smart and my opinions don't reflect the agency. I'm sorry,

6555
06:13:19,440 --> 06:13:26,400
love you, bye. I'll stop talking. I'll stop talking. Okay, this border district, you have

6556
06:13:26,400 --> 06:13:33,760
to scale it from the rooftops. It is impossible. You have to do it via arrow storm. If you do not

6557
06:13:33,760 --> 06:13:40,880
do it via arrow storm, you're just like hurting yourself like it's so bad and you can get a

6558
06:13:40,880 --> 06:13:47,920
flag on the way so so literally drop down arrow storm instantly and just like that done.

6559
06:13:49,280 --> 06:13:54,240
Easiest, literally you don't even annoy any other guards that are in the vicinity. There is no one

6560
06:13:54,240 --> 06:14:02,960
on the rooftops as long as you have arrow storm unlocked which is what the um which is what the

6561
06:14:02,960 --> 06:14:07,600
three recruits so you need six previous Borja towers destroyed in order to get that but once

6562
06:14:07,600 --> 06:14:16,240
you've got it then you are you're smooth sailing through the game. If only Leafs had protein. Yes,

6563
06:14:16,240 --> 06:14:23,600
I know deeper green coloured vegetaibals are like really really good in general um what way

6564
06:14:23,600 --> 06:14:29,280
am I to go? That looks too big for me to yeah I don't have a glove yet. Okay this looks like the

6565
06:14:29,280 --> 06:14:40,240
way I need to go. Did anyone get their what is it what's that organ that blows up that was used

6566
06:14:40,240 --> 06:14:45,760
for grass eating? Like it literally kills you. I'll always forget the name of it. An appendix?

6567
06:14:45,760 --> 06:14:53,360
Did anyone get their appendixes removed? Did you get wrecked with your appendix?

6568
06:14:53,360 --> 06:15:02,960
Okay tea time. Rice and beans. I can cover you for the most. Yeah.

6569
06:15:07,280 --> 06:15:15,680
Yours burst? Oh you must have been deathly ill. If it bursts it can result in death

6570
06:15:16,480 --> 06:15:22,160
because it's just straight poison to your organs. Holy crap someone said my tonsils

6571
06:15:22,720 --> 06:15:34,000
they stole your tonsils. Give them back. I thought appendixes were for built. I thought appendix was

6572
06:15:34,000 --> 06:15:39,680
for when we used to eat like grass grass like back in the old day. I'm taking a sip of tea I'm gonna

6573
06:15:39,680 --> 06:15:48,320
try and finish out my my apologies. I hear gallbladder I'm scared my mum had a gallbladder issue

6574
06:15:48,320 --> 06:15:55,040
and so did my gran genetically I am predispositioned. Like one day on stream I'm just gonna start like

6575
06:15:55,040 --> 06:16:03,520
screaming and being like gallbladder gallbladder but uh hopefully that doesn't actually happen

6576
06:16:03,520 --> 06:16:05,680
but I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.

6577
06:16:08,800 --> 06:16:12,720
You can die of death did I say that? Yeah you can die of death.

6578
06:16:13,040 --> 06:16:24,000
I don't wish that pain. Wait you know how you know how you guys are guys? Um have you guys

6579
06:16:24,880 --> 06:16:31,520
ever passed the kidney stone? For anyone who drinks an energy drink have you passed the kidney

6580
06:16:31,520 --> 06:16:40,080
stone yes or no? I'm very interested in that I wanna know. Never maybe? Did you ever really

6581
06:16:40,080 --> 06:16:46,160
sort of pee pee at one time? We are not 100% what it is used for. These range from filtration

6582
06:16:46,160 --> 06:16:52,240
to breaking down fiber to appendix to a mystery organ. That's so cool. Like how do we not know?

6583
06:16:52,240 --> 06:16:59,280
We've got so much history. No. I hope I don't yeah it sucks. Oh.

6584
06:17:03,360 --> 06:17:08,240
I've heard stories from women that are like I've had a kidney stone and I've had a baby I'd rather

6585
06:17:08,240 --> 06:17:15,120
you know do the baby again and I'm like I see that's biology in play. Did you know

6586
06:17:16,080 --> 06:17:23,120
the brain actually tells women that their birth of their... Wait where the heck am I going?

6587
06:17:24,080 --> 06:17:28,720
Can I climb up here without the glove? I don't think I can climb up here without the

6588
06:17:28,800 --> 06:17:34,400
glove. Playing? No? Okay I can. I can. Jesus. I was like oh I've just missed out.

6589
06:17:35,520 --> 06:17:41,760
I love stronticolors and I heard her kidney stone perils. Oh my god. I do have peril. I have a

6590
06:17:41,760 --> 06:17:47,840
peril in a very special location. Hmm are you doing mersey? Are you streaming later?

6591
06:17:48,480 --> 06:17:55,360
Are you streaming and one hour, two hour, three hour mersey stream? Question mark.

6592
06:17:58,160 --> 06:17:59,920
I'm finishing my tea please pardon me.

6593
06:18:07,040 --> 06:18:08,720
I need a burp it's like stuck in my throat.

6594
06:18:14,480 --> 06:18:15,680
I have finished my tea.

6595
06:18:18,800 --> 06:18:22,880
Requiem. Requiem is the debate. Okay.

6596
06:18:30,160 --> 06:18:35,440
Is Azura... Is Mama Azu streaming the day? Wait where the heck am I to go?

6597
06:18:37,040 --> 06:18:40,560
Sounds like I need to go up here. Oh that's because I do need to go up here.

6598
06:18:40,640 --> 06:18:55,680
Only energy drink I've had is Calcius. Calessus? What? C-E-L. Calcius. Oh I got there in the end.

6599
06:18:56,640 --> 06:19:02,000
I got there in the end. You just gotta let me cook on some words okay? Some words are like huh?

6600
06:19:02,960 --> 06:19:10,480
Huh? And then you just gotta phonetically spell them out. Everyone is streaming right now aren't

6601
06:19:10,480 --> 06:19:17,360
oh my god overlapping corp I can't believe it. I literally tell everyone like go watch everyone

6602
06:19:17,360 --> 06:19:21,200
else's stream because I'm literally just sitting doing like an endurance eight hour stream type

6603
06:19:21,200 --> 06:19:27,840
thing. I'm just having a blast. But don't worry when you go live in Mersey I always recommend to

6604
06:19:27,840 --> 06:19:37,040
the girls please to go... No I always recommend to the brief links to give you a chance and check

6605
06:19:37,040 --> 06:19:43,200
you out. See we work because odds are I'm still gonna be streaming by the time you... Oh I wasn't

6606
06:19:43,200 --> 06:19:50,960
supposed to be discovered. Oh well so we over... It's fine we're doing it to... Look at that. Look at

6607
06:19:50,960 --> 06:19:59,840
that combat cam. Is that Azura live right now with that link? Or is that Imi? Or is that just

6608
06:19:59,840 --> 06:20:05,360
everyone's link all together? Silence discord mode. Oh you're not discord mode at all. YouTube mode.

6609
06:20:05,360 --> 06:20:09,200
I'm just kidding thank you for moderating for free I really appreciate it. Actually all the girls

6610
06:20:09,200 --> 06:20:15,440
really do appreciate it because it's kind of like one of those like jobs you know like the

6611
06:20:15,440 --> 06:20:20,480
silent unrecognized work but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone who like applied to be

6612
06:20:20,480 --> 06:20:25,040
a mod and like thank you for everyone just being like cool at the mods and all that shiz.

6613
06:20:27,040 --> 06:20:34,000
Really appreciate that. But then again, silence mutual. With all that said and all due respect.

6614
06:20:36,160 --> 06:20:42,080
Oh I'm just getting spotted by everyone right Azura. We're just in a big fight. Oh no they have guns.

6615
06:20:44,080 --> 06:20:49,360
Calling the assassins. Calling the assassins. Okay I'm not dealing with them all you can kill them all.

6616
06:20:51,440 --> 06:20:58,480
I'm not dealing with them. Whoa they literally... Is he going to see me enter in the castle? I think

6617
06:20:58,480 --> 06:21:04,160
he might. I simply have all say you tell the girls to watch the girls. No I said it wrong.

6618
06:21:04,160 --> 06:21:11,680
I said it wrong. They do it for free. I mean literally Azura and Imi are Azura's online as well.

6619
06:21:11,680 --> 06:21:19,280
Oh if there are any Azura delay she is officially online as well if you're an Azura delay watcher.

6620
06:21:19,280 --> 06:21:24,240
I ordered a fresh batch of la cadore la last night. I'm just going to go and get you out of here.

6621
06:21:24,240 --> 06:21:30,880
But the pope has taken it all. Where is the pope? He meets with Cesare. Strange. He did not tell me Cesare

6622
06:21:30,880 --> 06:21:40,240
had returned. Imagine being a Mortarator. Imagine... Okay now what? Sorry I'm starting to lose that

6623
06:21:40,240 --> 06:21:46,160
little bit. I was like imagine being a Mortarator. Okay now what happens? Danny did anything else.

6624
06:21:46,240 --> 06:21:49,520
I'm imagining. With my mind only I'm imagining.

6625
06:21:52,320 --> 06:21:54,640
Okay I'm getting a bit delirious. I think it's like...

6626
06:21:56,240 --> 06:22:00,720
Bro I know I said this like yesterday. We were so delirious during that group collab.

6627
06:22:00,720 --> 06:22:06,640
But I'm so excited for our official like group game collab together. I hope you guys like the intro.

6628
06:22:06,640 --> 06:22:14,640
I'm gonna script it when we start up the streams. And literally everyone's gonna be streaming it.

6629
06:22:16,560 --> 06:22:19,120
So you can see all six POVs at once.

6630
06:22:22,640 --> 06:22:29,040
Oh I'm burping away. You've been at this for six hours? Honestly.

6631
06:22:33,840 --> 06:22:40,080
You come here so I can assassinate you. That's right come closer. I can sense thine penis.

6632
06:22:40,640 --> 06:22:42,800
Okay sorry I shouldn't have said that. I like that.

6633
06:22:45,280 --> 06:22:50,000
I ain't gonna actually do this. I'm starting to lose a little bit. But hey hope. Such a sleep.

6634
06:22:51,600 --> 06:22:59,440
Let's go. Oh I don't know why I said that. I'm remembering just like. Oh I'm notorious.

6635
06:23:00,800 --> 06:23:09,120
I didn't lure my notarite. Oh it sucks. I almost got caught. Well actually it doesn't matter if I

6636
06:23:09,120 --> 06:23:16,480
get caught by him. He doesn't come. How do you not see me? I'm literally on a bookcase.

6637
06:23:18,960 --> 06:23:24,480
Okay so. God he's so armored out the woods.

6638
06:23:26,880 --> 06:23:31,200
I have something on my mind. Like all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good

6639
06:23:31,280 --> 06:23:36,240
time on the marshmallows. Oh whoops I wasn't supposed to jump down here.

6640
06:23:43,760 --> 06:23:47,680
Oh I'm getting in trouble. I don't remember all these enemies being here. I'm gonna have

6641
06:23:47,680 --> 06:23:54,160
to remember like when I'm doing the like do not be detected. Like you put that away.

6642
06:23:54,400 --> 06:23:58,320
I literally did lead and I shot first get wrecked.

6643
06:24:00,160 --> 06:24:04,560
There's Tony big enough for the both of us. Cowboy. Oh I got 6000.

6644
06:24:06,080 --> 06:24:11,360
We're getting so near the end of the game. What has happened here? I do not know what you mean.

6645
06:24:11,360 --> 06:24:17,360
I want to take. I take. If I want you to die.

6646
06:24:35,360 --> 06:24:36,160
That's his dad.

6647
06:24:41,840 --> 06:24:48,240
What reason could I possibly have to kill him? Was he plotting against me with my brilliant

6648
06:24:48,240 --> 06:24:55,280
treacherous captain general? I do not have to stand for this. The assassins murdered him.

6649
06:24:55,280 --> 06:25:02,000
Why did you not stop them? As if I could. It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.

6650
06:25:02,000 --> 06:25:09,520
It was yours. It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.

6651
06:25:09,520 --> 06:25:15,440
My accomplishments. Despite the constant interference of failures like you.

6652
06:25:17,360 --> 06:25:22,320
You are not going anywhere. I have the peace. Out of my way old man.

6653
06:25:24,000 --> 06:25:31,840
Get out of my way old man. I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.

6654
06:25:31,920 --> 06:25:34,160
Chesere the intent to poison you.

6655
06:25:40,880 --> 06:25:50,880
You will not listen to reason. Father do you not see. I can kill all of this.

6656
06:25:51,840 --> 06:26:05,840
If I want to leave. I live. If I want to take. I take. And if I want you to die. You die.

6657
06:26:06,880 --> 06:26:13,840
I'm so good. It's so good. Where is the peace of Eden? Stop. I know where it is.

6658
06:26:14,400 --> 06:26:20,320
And you did not tell me he had taken it. Chesere. It's me. It's me. Your queen.

6659
06:26:22,320 --> 06:26:29,680
You are my sister. None more. Where is it? You never loved me. You never loved me.

6660
06:26:30,640 --> 06:26:36,640
Where is the apple? Tell me. Tell me.

6661
06:26:37,440 --> 06:26:43,680
Oh. Voice acting so good. Tell me. Tell me.

6662
06:26:47,520 --> 06:26:54,880
Oh. It's just so good. It's just so good. Thank you for letting me freaking share this game with you.

6663
06:26:54,880 --> 06:27:02,080
Fun fact. You actually don't need to like hurt any. Oh no. No. Go over it. Oh. It's it. Oh you're

6664
06:27:02,080 --> 06:27:10,800
giving me a heart attack. It's the oh. It's the oh. Little sister. I owe. I owe. I owe.

6665
06:27:12,080 --> 06:27:17,440
Fucking all of us have no heart. It's like. Do you see that? They're related. Yeah. It's based on

6666
06:27:17,440 --> 06:27:27,040
history. I could see. I know where that bastard is going. I know where that bastard is going.

6667
06:27:28,000 --> 06:27:36,000
San Pietro. The pavilion in the courtyard. The pavilion in the courtyard. Hmm.

6668
06:27:40,320 --> 06:27:45,680
Exit through the front gate. Wait. Am I still going to get attacked by guards? Oh. Oh. Wrong way.

6669
06:27:45,680 --> 06:27:55,040
Oopsies. You've just got such a big palace. I'll come back for you later. See you later.

6670
06:27:55,200 --> 06:27:57,040
I like this.

6671
06:27:59,360 --> 06:28:00,160
Asasino.

6672
06:28:04,800 --> 06:28:11,040
I will come for you. Later. Later. Come for you later.

6673
06:28:15,280 --> 06:28:16,400
I just like doing that.

6674
06:28:16,400 --> 06:28:27,280
I'll come back for you later. Later. I'll come back for you later. Yes, I will.

6675
06:28:27,840 --> 06:28:33,440
Who's a good refling? Have you been a good boy? Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?

6676
06:28:37,520 --> 06:28:44,480
Oopsies. Oopsies. Oopsies. Wait. He was in my way. Am I supposed to just ignore him? I think I am.

6677
06:28:44,480 --> 06:28:51,680
I will remember that for when we redo the mission. Spiral scape. Right. So that you can grab this box

6678
06:28:51,680 --> 06:29:00,160
because the timer don't start until now. You have to leg it for this entire next section. Okay.

6679
06:29:01,440 --> 06:29:08,560
You have to do it for the entire next day. Fucking let's go. Well, you're stuck in the cut scene.

6680
06:29:08,640 --> 06:29:12,640
Give it a second. Let it cook. Let it cook. Let's go.

6681
06:29:20,320 --> 06:29:23,040
Don't worry. Leave a faith. Leave a faith. Don't worry. Don't worry. Leave a faith.

6682
06:29:23,040 --> 06:29:27,360
Promise. Promise. Ta-da. See? It's right there. And then if you go in the street of the pavilion,

6683
06:29:27,360 --> 06:29:32,400
it's the easiest way to navigate to the place. Okay. And then you need to do the jump thing. Jump.

6684
06:29:32,400 --> 06:29:37,520
And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion and just jump every time you

6685
06:29:37,520 --> 06:29:43,280
see an agility at the bottom of your screen. You just jump and they can't get you. Jump. See?

6686
06:29:43,920 --> 06:29:55,760
The AI unclogs you. Jump. Jump. Jump. And then you'll be perfectly fine. Jump. Now you might

6687
06:29:55,760 --> 06:30:01,200
have to fight them at the end. I honestly don't understand what the development team actually

6688
06:30:01,200 --> 06:30:07,760
wanted from you at this point. Please leave me alone. But oh, he almost touched me. He touched

6689
06:30:07,760 --> 06:30:14,960
my ankle. Oh, he's touching me. He's touching me. Okay. And then they opened up. And then we just go

6690
06:30:14,960 --> 06:30:20,560
inside. And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay. It's okay.

6691
06:30:21,520 --> 06:30:31,200
Okay. So we were... That's a lot of bad guys. Okay. We got one.

6692
06:30:34,560 --> 06:30:41,920
Oh, I'm getting ganged on. I'm getting ganged up. I don't like it. Take this. And this. And this.

6693
06:30:42,720 --> 06:30:51,760
And this. And this. Okay. Unfortunately, we are in range because of that yellow on the map,

6694
06:30:51,760 --> 06:31:00,080
but we might be able to stand here. It should time out because they're not supposed to actually

6695
06:31:00,080 --> 06:31:08,560
see us. There we go. There we go. Now, did you guys remember the pineapple? Did you remember the

6696
06:31:08,560 --> 06:31:15,360
pineapple? We did a little eagle vision. The pineapple is glowing.

6697
06:31:22,480 --> 06:31:28,560
I was right there. What? I was there all along. Excuse me.

6698
06:31:38,560 --> 06:31:42,560
Hydration.

6699
06:31:45,760 --> 06:31:48,480
That... Those armor clinking sounds. Good sound effect.

6700
06:31:50,000 --> 06:32:01,760
Gods! Gods! Oh, Chesery. Your time can't last. Not while I come in with the apple. Okay. So,

6701
06:32:01,760 --> 06:32:09,280
basically, just run. Wait, hold on. Let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy. I need

6702
06:32:09,280 --> 06:32:13,680
to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in. So I need to keep

6703
06:32:13,680 --> 06:32:27,120
going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay, let's go. It is just a waste of time trying to stop and

6704
06:32:28,080 --> 06:32:34,400
get rid of all these enemies. There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water

6705
06:32:34,400 --> 06:32:42,560
and swim like your life depends on it. They keep... They're jumping me. Get off. Get off.

6706
06:32:43,760 --> 06:32:51,360
Away. Naughty. No. If you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water.

6707
06:32:51,680 --> 06:32:56,880
Oh, I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong.

6708
06:33:06,000 --> 06:33:13,920
When the moon hits your high like a big pizza pie, that's a mooring.

6709
06:33:13,920 --> 06:33:31,920
And that's how you get away from that sequence. Jump on that boat and get out of there. You

6710
06:33:31,920 --> 06:33:38,000
do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies. Jump in that boat and you

6711
06:33:38,000 --> 06:33:44,000
are safe. Over and thank you.

6712
06:33:56,240 --> 06:33:58,000
When the moon hits your eye, that's a straw knee.

6713
06:33:58,720 --> 06:34:03,040
My men were to throw the zithi, but we might be the naughty. We am one.

6714
06:34:05,440 --> 06:34:10,960
It's blinding. Oh, my model's not reactive to what happens on screen. I need to put that back on.

6715
06:34:10,960 --> 06:34:13,040
I love that. That was like the funniest thing.

6716
06:34:13,200 --> 06:34:24,080
And my eyes. We do have no variety. A sight to see us known.

6717
06:34:28,880 --> 06:34:29,520
Flashbang.

6718
06:34:32,800 --> 06:34:36,080
I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without heart and I know you just

6719
06:34:36,080 --> 06:34:40,960
pop a smoke bomb and get in a crowded bench. I wonder that may be the solution.

6720
06:34:43,040 --> 06:34:53,040
At once. I do not care how. We cannot on our own, you must help us. I am here. Idiot. Idiot.

6721
06:34:55,840 --> 06:34:59,440
And then you will see how quickly the asasini fall.

6722
06:34:59,600 --> 06:35:17,120
Oh, right. So the apple is a bit funny. Do you see that white one? That white line means imminent death.

6723
06:35:17,920 --> 06:35:20,000
The yellow means under my control.

6724
06:35:21,680 --> 06:35:27,840
And so we want to basically the apple will take your health. So I have to wait until it restores

6725
06:35:28,640 --> 06:35:34,000
and then wait. And then it kills the people who we want to kill. And then the others are either

6726
06:35:34,000 --> 06:35:38,480
under my control or will fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it, you get it.

6727
06:35:42,240 --> 06:35:45,280
We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming

6728
06:35:46,880 --> 06:35:53,520
rose. Yes. Under stress.

6729
06:35:54,080 --> 06:36:00,720
Any anyone else under stress? Anyone feeling about A.K. needing a bit of a

6730
06:36:02,880 --> 06:36:04,400
I'm not gonna say it's too easy. Too easy.

6731
06:36:09,760 --> 06:36:14,800
So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden. However,

6732
06:36:15,760 --> 06:36:23,200
Ezio is a good, good boy and his DNA communes with the apple. So his bloodline

6733
06:36:24,000 --> 06:36:29,040
kind of has been chosen. I'm pretty sure the guy's around this corner, actually,

6734
06:36:29,040 --> 06:36:31,280
and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is.

6735
06:36:35,040 --> 06:36:41,200
Fail at the cardinal. I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it. You do not have

6736
06:36:41,280 --> 06:36:45,040
our access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the

6737
06:36:45,040 --> 06:36:50,960
apple of Eden. I will say one thing. The more, oh no, actually, it doesn't affect with the more

6738
06:36:50,960 --> 06:36:57,120
armor you have. Also, on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden.

6739
06:36:57,120 --> 06:36:58,320
I won't even let you take it out.

6740
06:37:02,800 --> 06:37:03,440
Take anything.

6741
06:37:03,680 --> 06:37:08,320
So we just need to follow him into the Colosseum.

6742
06:37:10,000 --> 06:37:18,160
Fuck it. No, no, I'm not here. No, no, you didn't see me. No, you're actually a liar.

6743
06:37:19,520 --> 06:37:26,320
And I, oh, you guards just spawned in. Don't lie. You just spawned in right in front of me.

6744
06:37:27,280 --> 06:37:28,320
Is it safe?

6745
06:37:49,520 --> 06:37:54,720
My bikini affairs have been mentioned enough. I've unbinded everything,

6746
06:37:55,360 --> 06:37:58,800
so there's no chance of accident or bikini show. I apologize.

6747
06:38:02,800 --> 06:38:05,760
Borgia? Mind Control Apple?

6748
06:38:13,360 --> 06:38:19,440
Okay, again, same thing. Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits,

6749
06:38:20,240 --> 06:38:24,160
but it's not very good at all. I'm trying. Okay, this isn't working.

6750
06:38:24,720 --> 06:38:29,920
Wait, he attacked me and he died? Did you see that? Right, I'm just calling in my recruits.

6751
06:38:29,920 --> 06:38:35,840
They're not very strong, but we'll try. We'll try. I don't normally like doing it because

6752
06:38:35,840 --> 06:38:41,760
recruits can definitely die at this section because of the overwhelming amount of enemies

6753
06:38:43,840 --> 06:38:49,200
that come in. But again, white mark around who you would wish to eliminate right off the bat,

6754
06:38:49,200 --> 06:38:55,840
and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around. So he's coming straight for me,

6755
06:38:55,840 --> 06:39:01,200
so once I've healed up again, you just need to do the white. You can also see the white line

6756
06:39:01,200 --> 06:39:06,640
on their, the horse knocked him out of range, so we'll need to try that one again.

6757
06:39:07,840 --> 06:39:15,200
So they're now fighting each other actually. But again, white line, I got him. Yeah,

6758
06:39:15,200 --> 06:39:19,520
I see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health. I really do not enjoy calling them

6759
06:39:19,520 --> 06:39:24,800
in on this mission. It is dangerous. You can lose recruits here. If they're not leveled up enough,

6760
06:39:24,800 --> 06:39:33,280
I really did not spend much. Where's the apple? Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me. Okay, we've got

6761
06:39:33,280 --> 06:39:39,600
two more to go, two more to go. Let him get up, let him get up. We'll go for him first because you

6762
06:39:39,600 --> 06:39:45,280
actually, no, we won't because my assassin recruit just did that. Oh, someone's low, not good, not

6763
06:39:45,280 --> 06:39:55,840
good. This is why I really don't want anyone to perish. Did he survive? I didn't get a notification

6764
06:39:55,840 --> 06:40:01,520
saying that one passed away. I think we don't know. I know very much of an ASMR enjoyer, but

6765
06:40:01,520 --> 06:40:08,320
Amy changed your mind. That's fantastic. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they

6766
06:40:08,320 --> 06:40:16,640
can interest you into something new. Johnny, Miss Ma, how are you doing? Have you been good?

6767
06:40:21,440 --> 06:40:28,720
We played assassin's recruit up in this house. We're literally about to finish the game after an

6768
06:40:28,720 --> 06:40:35,120
amazing gaming session. You can ignore the guards here. The campaign should take over once you approach

6769
06:40:35,120 --> 06:40:41,920
these guards here. So very good. Another time here. Did you stream today? Or have you streamed yet?

6770
06:40:44,400 --> 06:40:45,520
Or are you taking break today?

6771
06:40:48,080 --> 06:40:50,640
At least ASMR was great at Dozed off. That's fun to have.

6772
06:40:50,960 --> 06:41:02,400
So now we get our cool Avengers moment where everyone's with us helping us.

6773
06:41:04,240 --> 06:41:15,840
You can actually successfully kill all everyone in the sequence. Oh, I can't use my blades. I'm so

6774
06:41:16,160 --> 06:41:21,760
used to using them. You're still playing? Absolutely. We're just about to finish the campaign. I'm so

6775
06:41:21,760 --> 06:41:28,720
excited. Oh no, that recruit is so low. Oh, I feel like I need to help him. Oh no. Okay, okay, good

6776
06:41:28,720 --> 06:41:35,200
catch, good catch. Oh no, that. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6777
06:41:36,240 --> 06:41:43,760
I'm dead. I only have one HP. Oh, I needed to regen. No, I don't want any assassins to fall.

6778
06:41:44,560 --> 06:41:48,640
Stop attacking her. Stop. I don't have health to freaking use the apple.

6779
06:41:49,280 --> 06:42:00,240
Please gang up on him. Thank you. My goodness. Oh, no. Oh, please. Okay, yellow. Oh, someone's

6780
06:42:00,240 --> 06:42:10,960
going to pass away. I don't want anyone to pass away. Okay, so we've just finished that. Oh, no one

6781
06:42:10,960 --> 06:42:18,080
perished. Oh, wait, that was so lucky. So we've now finished the sequence and we're all waiting.

6782
06:42:19,680 --> 06:42:21,360
All five of us avenger style.

6783
06:42:21,360 --> 06:42:29,520
On your arm, Cezare Borgia, the Coletus troops must behind me. We will take back my city once and for

6784
06:42:29,520 --> 06:42:38,560
all. This is not your city anymore. By order of Pope Julius II, I arrested Cezare Borgia for the crimes

6785
06:42:38,560 --> 06:42:49,600
of murder, betrayal, and incest. No, no, no, no, this is not how it ends. James will not hold me.

6786
06:42:50,160 --> 06:42:52,720
I will not die by the hands of man.

6787
06:42:59,520 --> 06:43:03,680
Was the manner in which he said it. James will not hold me.

6788
06:43:04,400 --> 06:43:13,040
Didn't know that was a crime back then. Honestly, true question marks because all we hear about blood

6789
06:43:13,040 --> 06:43:20,480
lines is, uh, you know, about royals and that. So was it like royals are allowed to do it, but

6790
06:43:20,480 --> 06:43:23,760
the common people aren't allowed to do it, you know, as peasants?

6791
06:43:23,760 --> 06:43:33,840
I must go.

6792
06:43:38,640 --> 06:43:39,840
I need to leave. My people need me.

6793
06:43:39,840 --> 06:43:45,760
I built this brotherhood to last with or without me. What do you intend to do? Plant a seed.

6794
06:43:48,960 --> 06:43:55,120
This is goodbye. Then keep your money. I do not want it. We will see each other again. You have my

6795
06:43:55,120 --> 06:44:05,600
good luck. Take the money. Your meager salary. You will need it.

6796
06:44:06,320 --> 06:44:18,960
My patron has been arrested after all. You've got a lot for tuna. Oops.

6797
06:44:19,200 --> 06:44:29,280
There was a limit. Cousins and relatives seemed, okay, direct bloodline off.

6798
06:44:30,960 --> 06:44:40,800
Yeah. Oh, why is my tracking, is my, why is my tracking stopped? Hello?

6799
06:44:41,040 --> 06:44:48,160
Uh, uh, uh, is my PC dead or is it just my tracking has gave up?

6800
06:44:49,520 --> 06:44:51,040
Hey, you want to recalibrate real quick?

6801
06:44:56,400 --> 06:45:07,280
Uh, uh, uh, I need to play, but my thing is not working. Woo. Hello? No, it's not. I have my

6802
06:45:07,280 --> 06:45:14,000
iPhone on fire. Oh, my iPhone is burning. Uh, let me just pause that real quick. Oh,

6803
06:45:14,720 --> 06:45:26,000
did you see all of them? Uh, oh, okay, hold on. Uh, that, am I back up to sync? Okay. Uh,

6804
06:45:26,720 --> 06:45:38,560
just yeah. It's like in so fast there. Oh, oh, then a cannonball should appear. Yeah,

6805
06:45:38,560 --> 06:45:45,200
there you go. Cannonball and it got me as well. My iPhone's on fire.

6806
06:45:50,160 --> 06:45:54,720
Hidden blade only. Let's go. I'm a hidden blade. Some people enjoy the source. Some people

6807
06:45:54,720 --> 06:46:02,640
enjoy the heavy weaponry. Uh, a double assassin blade for me. I died there. I better not have died.

6808
06:46:04,960 --> 06:46:10,800
The phone's about to explode honestly. I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged,

6809
06:46:10,800 --> 06:46:18,480
like I've charged it, um, this entire time. Like it's got charger input, so.

6810
06:46:18,480 --> 06:46:29,600
Oh, the iPhone better get used to it. Uh, you better not be, uh, better raise the stamina levels for me.

6811
06:46:32,720 --> 06:46:41,040
Mm. The cinematic, uh, like when it does, like, the cinematic kill, it looks so nice on, like,

6812
06:46:41,040 --> 06:46:46,240
all the different weaponry. I have to admit. So, like, obviously not mad if someone prepares

6813
06:46:46,240 --> 06:46:55,920
something else. Not the whole. Oh, wait, no, I lied. I lied. I thought all the horsies got. No!

6814
06:46:59,360 --> 06:47:04,960
I completely forgot. I thought all the horsies got back up. Why would they do that at the end of the

6815
06:47:04,960 --> 06:47:11,920
game? Assume I'm allowed to be spotted. Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of the

6816
06:47:11,920 --> 06:47:22,000
ones where I shouldn't be spotted? No, I can be spotted. That's absolutely fine with me.

6817
06:47:22,960 --> 06:47:29,440
Ooh, but they're heavy. Heavy infantry. I'm trying to say they're heavy infantry. Right,

6818
06:47:29,440 --> 06:47:33,840
doesn't matter if I get spotted, so I'm just going to send it. Oh, I can't believe I forgot

6819
06:47:33,840 --> 06:47:41,040
about that horsey-warcy. I do apologize. I don't like when they do that. He's just taken an app.

6820
06:47:41,120 --> 06:47:46,160
He's just taken an app. I mean, I'd take one too. You know, he needs to sleep it off. He needs to sleep

6821
06:47:46,160 --> 06:47:53,120
off what happened. No, you've not seen me before, unless you know it's the only time.

6822
06:48:03,600 --> 06:48:08,800
The battery swelled up? Who are you doing? I left my Android phone on charge for a year and the

6823
06:48:08,800 --> 06:48:16,480
battery swelled, like, like, popped like a balloon-type swell? It's as dangerous.

6824
06:48:27,440 --> 06:48:29,120
Honestly, pretty brutal scene.

6825
06:48:29,120 --> 06:48:36,480
Huh. Leave me alone.

6826
06:48:42,960 --> 06:48:47,680
Unfortunately for this section, both factions will target you.

6827
06:48:51,680 --> 06:48:57,760
So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you.

6828
06:48:59,760 --> 06:49:05,120
Um, they will always sign, but you can't progress until they leave you alone. So

6829
06:49:05,120 --> 06:49:11,440
just, I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you. Okay, there you go. You just need to

6830
06:49:11,440 --> 06:49:17,440
wait for them to leave you alone. You need to water my battery. Make sure it's not too cool.

6831
06:49:21,760 --> 06:49:28,400
Yes, so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning siege tower. You're so smart. The

6832
06:49:28,400 --> 06:49:36,480
wooden flammable siege tower. I'm not sure about that one, Enzo. I like your accent. Thanks, Spondyn with it.

6833
06:49:39,360 --> 06:49:42,480
Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm.

6834
06:49:44,560 --> 06:49:46,560
Do we need to take the rooftops? I actually...

6835
06:49:47,840 --> 06:49:54,000
Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen. This section is the same,

6836
06:49:54,000 --> 06:50:02,800
where both factions will target you. You need to become anonymous. Can I hide behind this and

6837
06:50:04,560 --> 06:50:07,840
be left alone? Oh, is he gonna attack me?

6838
06:50:12,480 --> 06:50:19,120
Okay, okay. I was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like, why would they both

6839
06:50:19,120 --> 06:50:25,840
randomly target me? I have no fight with them? But I don't even know who they're. They're fighting

6840
06:50:25,840 --> 06:50:31,920
each other and they're the same. They have the same uniform on. They found the traitor.

6841
06:50:35,520 --> 06:50:40,160
I know what's wrong when I'm going to guess. Leave me alone.

6842
06:50:40,480 --> 06:50:47,360
Right, let's try again. This time, it's not on fire.

6843
06:50:49,760 --> 06:50:52,080
My world's on fire. How about yours?

6844
06:50:57,520 --> 06:51:02,800
The water's getting warm, so you might as well swim. I don't know the words. I can never remember

6845
06:51:03,360 --> 06:51:12,000
words. I can never remember words in order of actual songs. And then the best I can do is go,

6846
06:51:14,880 --> 06:51:21,280
the back streets. Hey, never go on. What you gonna say? What you gonna do? That's not the word.

6847
06:51:22,240 --> 06:51:30,000
Hey now, you're an assassin. Get your game on. Go play Caesar's gonna. His name's not Caesar.

6848
06:51:30,000 --> 06:51:43,200
Chasery's gonna die. Kicking in the balls. Oh, dear. Hey. That's right, baby.

6849
06:51:47,840 --> 06:51:52,720
So much to kill, so much to do, so much assassinating. On the spreadsheets,

6850
06:51:53,680 --> 06:52:00,800
never know when I'm gonna strike. Hey, don't know if it's good advice. Hey, so much to

6851
06:52:00,800 --> 06:52:08,400
pew, so much to do. Gotta disarm the guard. I can't do that, so that's fine. I'm taking out the double

6852
06:52:08,400 --> 06:52:20,480
knife. Trying to pistol whip. Try again with the tip. It's actually much easier just to shoot

6853
06:52:20,560 --> 06:52:24,240
Chasery. There, if you shoot him, you take a health bar.

6854
06:52:26,720 --> 06:52:34,240
And removing his armor. He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first.

6855
06:52:36,880 --> 06:52:43,920
You can't spam it. No, run at a time. He broke the armor. Oh, that's not good. Oh, that's not good.

6856
06:52:44,640 --> 06:52:46,720
Okay, I actually don't want that. I'm taking out my double blades.

6857
06:52:51,280 --> 06:53:00,880
Take this. Take that. And this. And take my knee to your boss. My knee to your boss.

6858
06:53:02,000 --> 06:53:08,240
Denny, wanna put my boss on your jaws. It's my knee. Oh, shit. Right. I'm actually

6859
06:53:08,240 --> 06:53:12,960
kind of messing this up. I may need to try hard. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get rid of these guards

6860
06:53:12,960 --> 06:53:18,320
first and then go for Chasery. But then, whoa, wait, wait, wait. You can't keep spawning new guards.

6861
06:53:20,240 --> 06:53:27,680
I mean, maybe you can, but like, you shouldn't. You should give me a chance to kill. Oh,

6862
06:53:27,680 --> 06:53:32,480
we're getting a bit crowded. We're getting a bit crowded in here. There aren't too many of yous.

6863
06:53:32,480 --> 06:53:42,640
This is starting to get a bit, he's gonna, can I do this? Okay, Chasery is, that's fine.

6864
06:53:42,640 --> 06:53:49,760
I expected that. Okay, Chasery's like one. Seriously, he's like one. Okay.

6865
06:53:51,440 --> 06:53:54,320
One more. Reload faster. Okay, there we go.

6866
06:53:58,640 --> 06:54:00,400
Actually, how much Nick armor do you have?

6867
06:54:00,400 --> 06:54:04,880
The throne was mine. Wanting something does not make it your right.

6868
06:54:04,880 --> 06:54:10,240
I love your mother, babe. That the true leader empowers the people he rules.

6869
06:54:10,240 --> 06:54:12,880
I will lead mankind into a new world.

6870
06:54:21,120 --> 06:54:26,160
No man can murder me. Then I leave you in the hands of fate.

6871
06:54:40,240 --> 06:54:45,200
The throne was mine.

6872
06:54:47,520 --> 06:54:49,520
What do you know? What do you know?

6873
06:54:52,960 --> 06:54:56,240
Get dunked on. I will lead mankind into a new world.

6874
06:54:57,040 --> 06:54:58,880
We take it literally in these parts.

6875
06:55:02,640 --> 06:55:06,800
You cannot kill me. No man can murder me.

6876
06:55:10,640 --> 06:55:15,840
The apple.

6877
06:55:21,920 --> 06:55:27,440
The vault. Oh my god, we're playing Borderlands 2. It's the vault.

6878
06:55:27,680 --> 06:55:39,760
So Ezio has put the apple of Eden away and the vault left behind by the gods.

6879
06:55:40,640 --> 06:55:42,240
So it's not in the hands of man.

6880
06:55:49,440 --> 06:55:52,160
We've got it. We're about to go to present day.

6881
06:55:52,240 --> 06:55:57,360
Gravity cleaves another victim. Full damage buff.

6882
06:56:11,040 --> 06:56:11,920
Perfect recall.

6883
06:56:17,920 --> 06:56:20,400
Oh my god. It's gold.

6884
06:56:21,360 --> 06:56:25,360
It's kind of why I'm saying it out now. I'll be quiet. I'm sorry.

6885
06:56:25,360 --> 06:56:26,240
I'm sorry. I'm getting too excited.

6886
06:56:32,160 --> 06:56:39,440
Like that European power grid. Ah yes, Italy. The only country in Europe you've got.

6887
06:56:40,720 --> 06:56:42,000
Problem is he's dead.

6888
06:56:42,000 --> 06:56:44,480
I can't believe we're stuck here.

6889
06:56:49,360 --> 06:56:52,160
A few cutscenes up ahead so I'll try and be quiet. I'm just getting so excited.

6890
06:56:52,160 --> 06:56:55,040
So I do apologize for talking over like so.

6891
06:56:56,400 --> 06:56:58,080
I'm just a bit of a silly belly.

6892
06:56:59,360 --> 06:57:01,120
Hey, maybe it has something to do with this.

6893
06:57:01,120 --> 06:57:12,720
A symbol matches the one on the door to the vault.

6894
06:57:14,080 --> 06:57:19,280
1419, 1420, 1421. What if they aren't dates?

6895
06:57:19,280 --> 06:57:26,160
1419, 1420. Oh my god. What?

6896
06:57:26,880 --> 06:57:30,320
God. Tell us already.

6897
06:57:30,320 --> 06:57:36,320
I am. I am. The tetragrammaton. The 72 names of God. You see?

6898
06:57:36,320 --> 06:57:40,640
They're all contained within three verses. Exodus 19 through 21.

6899
06:57:40,640 --> 06:57:44,800
And to get this your likeness, if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within

6900
06:57:44,800 --> 06:57:51,440
an equilateral triangle, their numerical values add up to the same number. 72.

6901
06:57:51,440 --> 06:57:53,200
Are you absolutely sure about this?

6902
06:57:53,840 --> 06:57:56,240
That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud, Rebecca. Yeah.

6903
06:57:56,240 --> 06:57:58,000
But I haven't lost the kicker yet.

6904
06:57:58,720 --> 06:58:03,680
Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72.

6905
06:58:04,800 --> 06:58:07,680
I think we have our password. Sean, go get the van.

6906
06:58:13,840 --> 06:58:20,400
We now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden.

6907
06:58:21,280 --> 06:58:24,400
I'm a Calibri again. Hold on.

6908
06:58:28,800 --> 06:58:31,760
Okay. I calibrated. No, my my friend.

6909
06:58:33,600 --> 06:58:37,200
You know everything. I really like this game.

6910
06:58:39,680 --> 06:58:40,720
That's right. I've seen your car.

6911
06:58:51,120 --> 06:58:56,320
Base the Assassin's Creed said women bad driver.

6912
06:59:02,320 --> 06:59:07,360
That's terrible. Dev team, you know exactly what you're doing for nothing.

6913
06:59:11,600 --> 06:59:13,840
There's a lot of dialogue up ahead, so try and be quiet.

6914
06:59:15,920 --> 06:59:17,680
Lucy, I'm making my way toward the entrance.

6915
06:59:18,640 --> 06:59:19,280
Okay, good.

6916
06:59:20,240 --> 06:59:23,440
Can you see any gladiators? My advice would be like it.

6917
06:59:25,040 --> 06:59:26,080
I'll keep that in mind.

6918
06:59:38,640 --> 06:59:40,720
I can't believe I'm actually going to hold the apple.

6919
06:59:41,760 --> 06:59:44,240
It's been a long time coming. You've earned it.

6920
06:59:45,200 --> 06:59:49,040
I wonder if it'll change things, whether it can tip the scales in our favor.

6921
06:59:49,920 --> 06:59:53,360
Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember.

6922
06:59:54,960 --> 06:59:58,240
I was going to say tip the scales. I don't know if they might pick that up, but it's a little bit.

6923
07:00:02,000 --> 07:00:02,960
What do you think we'll find?

6924
07:00:04,000 --> 07:00:05,440
Hopefully a map of a temple.

6925
07:00:06,480 --> 07:00:10,720
The apple's just going to give it to us. Is it? Yeah? Who's Elvis over there?

6926
07:00:11,680 --> 07:00:13,440
Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky.

6927
07:00:18,880 --> 07:00:22,240
On my first playthrough, I never found this for ages.

6928
07:00:23,360 --> 07:00:24,720
It's so slight and cheeky.

6929
07:00:28,720 --> 07:00:31,440
So much construction. This place is like a maze.

6930
07:00:32,320 --> 07:00:37,760
The hypergeum house, the cages of the gladiators, and the machines which raised them for the service.

6931
07:00:37,840 --> 07:00:41,280
The whole area you're in right now was originally covered by the arena.

6932
07:00:42,640 --> 07:00:43,280
Good to know.

6933
07:00:45,840 --> 07:00:51,280
So at the end of this, there's a quote from the gods.

6934
07:00:54,480 --> 07:00:56,160
And I said a message.

6935
07:00:57,920 --> 07:00:58,560
Oh wait, hold on.

6936
07:00:59,760 --> 07:01:03,040
My birthday! So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday.

6937
07:01:04,000 --> 07:01:07,600
Because it's October 10th in the present day!

6938
07:01:24,320 --> 07:01:29,920
Um, okay. If I don't move, the cutscene's not going to begin.

6939
07:01:30,560 --> 07:01:34,560
But I just want to say there's a quote from the god at the end of this.

6940
07:01:34,560 --> 07:01:35,840
And she says go forth.

6941
07:01:37,360 --> 07:01:42,560
And I may or may not have said be embraced by the six because of that quote.

6942
07:01:43,280 --> 07:01:45,200
And I hope you understand it when you hear it.

6943
07:01:47,280 --> 07:01:48,720
So be embraced by the six.

6944
07:01:49,680 --> 07:01:51,520
It's because it's all my love.

6945
07:01:54,240 --> 07:01:55,760
And the allure is the six.

6946
07:01:57,520 --> 07:01:59,040
Just wait for it, okay? Just wait for it.

6947
07:01:59,040 --> 07:02:00,080
I tell you, I tell you.

6948
07:02:00,080 --> 07:02:01,040
I show you, I show you.

6949
07:02:02,400 --> 07:02:05,040
But I hope the six have embraced you dearly.

6950
07:02:07,040 --> 07:02:08,320
Embrace those by the...

6951
07:02:08,320 --> 07:02:10,560
No! Set six! Number six!

6952
07:02:10,560 --> 07:02:14,160
Numero en dos tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

6953
07:02:14,720 --> 07:02:16,240
I know it's kind of hard just...

6954
07:02:29,280 --> 07:02:30,880
...to keep his path forward.

6955
07:02:30,880 --> 07:02:33,440
I'd save the world we leave behind.

6956
07:02:34,240 --> 07:02:34,880
Who are you?

6957
07:02:39,440 --> 07:02:39,920
Jino.

6958
07:02:41,040 --> 07:02:41,440
Nothing.

6959
07:02:47,760 --> 07:02:50,000
We're getting close boys to the end.

6960
07:02:50,000 --> 07:02:51,440
I don't want it to end, but...

6961
07:02:54,640 --> 07:02:57,600
That's been a fan past the cleanest campaign.

6962
07:02:57,600 --> 07:02:58,560
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

6963
07:02:58,560 --> 07:03:00,400
Daphne, I know what we'd go through.

6964
07:03:04,960 --> 07:03:07,200
I'm getting really close to getting chills

6965
07:03:07,200 --> 07:03:08,640
because I know what's up ahead.

6966
07:03:18,720 --> 07:03:21,920
In the beginning, we set our truths to parchment.

6967
07:03:22,640 --> 07:03:23,280
To stone.

6968
07:03:24,000 --> 07:03:25,360
To the memory of men.

6969
07:03:26,320 --> 07:03:28,080
These proved impermanent things.

6970
07:03:28,080 --> 07:03:29,200
Oh, sorry, my mouth's open.

6971
07:03:29,200 --> 07:03:34,640
Lens by fire. Lens by famine. Lens by blood.

6972
07:03:35,600 --> 07:03:38,240
All the world is in this and all the more.

6973
07:03:38,240 --> 07:03:40,960
Innocent and ignorant.

6974
07:03:43,840 --> 07:03:45,840
Oh, cleansed by fire.

6975
07:03:46,400 --> 07:03:47,600
Cleansed by famine.

6976
07:03:49,280 --> 07:03:51,200
Such like, good dialogue.

6977
07:03:52,160 --> 07:03:54,800
Just to show that history cannot last on parchment.

6978
07:03:54,800 --> 07:03:57,120
Like, it's just such a genius.

6979
07:04:12,640 --> 07:04:14,880
Yeah, you think you found an entrance after the, like,

6980
07:04:14,880 --> 07:04:17,200
the freaking floor the pavilion opens up?

6981
07:04:17,200 --> 07:04:18,640
Okay, yeah, entrance, okay.

6982
07:04:25,760 --> 07:04:26,240
Mm-hmm.

6983
07:04:28,400 --> 07:04:29,360
Oh, I'm getting chills.

6984
07:04:41,920 --> 07:04:42,560
Let me in.

6985
07:04:44,160 --> 07:04:44,720
I'm coming.

6986
07:04:50,320 --> 07:04:51,440
But on what can it last?

6987
07:04:51,440 --> 07:04:52,160
Took you long enough.

6988
07:04:53,520 --> 07:04:54,160
What is this place?

6989
07:04:54,400 --> 07:04:55,840
What happens if it didn't have to last?

6990
07:04:57,840 --> 07:05:00,400
What if we just enjoyed every moment we could get?

6991
07:05:07,840 --> 07:05:08,720
I like the ceiling.

6992
07:05:09,520 --> 07:05:10,480
Dude, you like the ceiling?

6993
07:05:11,280 --> 07:05:13,520
You are a fascinating traveling companion.

6994
07:05:13,840 --> 07:05:14,320
Mm.

6995
07:05:24,000 --> 07:05:26,400
Look how detailed this is.

6996
07:05:29,280 --> 07:05:32,800
Like, 2010.

6997
07:05:35,120 --> 07:05:37,440
Like, look how accurate it is.

6998
07:05:37,440 --> 07:05:39,440
Please, can we do history games?

6999
07:05:40,080 --> 07:05:42,160
Where we can all just nerd about history

7000
07:05:42,160 --> 07:05:43,600
and, like, the things...

7001
07:05:43,600 --> 07:05:46,080
Like, they even bother to do the text and stuff,

7002
07:05:46,080 --> 07:05:47,360
like, under the paintings to be like,

7003
07:05:47,360 --> 07:05:47,920
this is from...

7004
07:05:49,760 --> 07:05:51,200
Like, ah!

7005
07:05:52,880 --> 07:05:54,560
Ah, it's such a good game!

7006
07:05:58,960 --> 07:06:00,560
Just appreciate everything.

7007
07:06:00,560 --> 07:06:02,160
It's so good, it's so good.

7008
07:06:02,160 --> 07:06:03,840
I'm so glad I get to share the game with you.

7009
07:06:04,480 --> 07:06:06,720
And hopefully you maybe play on your own sometime.

7010
07:06:08,160 --> 07:06:09,520
You have to experience all...

7011
07:06:12,240 --> 07:06:13,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7012
07:06:18,320 --> 07:06:19,600
That guy is sassy.

7013
07:06:19,600 --> 07:06:21,360
Sean is a very sassy character.

7014
07:06:22,720 --> 07:06:25,120
A very British, uh, deadpan.

7015
07:06:28,160 --> 07:06:28,560
Wow.

7016
07:06:30,480 --> 07:06:32,000
Ready to speak to the gods?

7017
07:06:38,480 --> 07:06:38,800
Wow.

7018
07:06:42,160 --> 07:06:45,200
And now they are our final, vaulted hope.

7019
07:06:46,240 --> 07:06:47,520
You are they.

7020
07:06:52,160 --> 07:06:53,360
Hey, actually, I'm a he-him?

7021
07:06:54,400 --> 07:06:54,800
Sorry.

7022
07:06:54,800 --> 07:06:55,920
You have the best understanding.

7023
07:06:56,560 --> 07:07:00,480
But you broke our tools, or turned them against one another.

7024
07:07:01,360 --> 07:07:02,880
We have destroyed what we could.

7025
07:07:03,440 --> 07:07:05,280
Sealed away what we could not.

7026
07:07:09,120 --> 07:07:09,600
This is...

7027
07:07:10,480 --> 07:07:11,600
Destroyed what we could.

7028
07:07:11,600 --> 07:07:12,720
Sealed away if not.

7029
07:07:18,720 --> 07:07:19,220
What?

7030
07:07:20,720 --> 07:07:21,220
Oh shit.

7031
07:07:39,680 --> 07:07:40,400
The time...

7032
07:07:41,520 --> 07:07:42,560
Time he roads us.

7033
07:07:46,000 --> 07:07:47,040
We can distract him.

7034
07:07:47,680 --> 07:07:49,280
We can see past him.

7035
07:07:49,280 --> 07:07:51,200
He ain't left when he strikes right.

7036
07:07:51,840 --> 07:07:53,840
But his reach is so very long.

7037
07:07:54,480 --> 07:07:56,560
He's stamina unending.

7038
07:07:57,440 --> 07:07:58,880
We cannot evade his grasp.

7039
07:07:59,440 --> 07:08:00,240
Not forever.

7040
07:08:02,400 --> 07:08:02,880
Wow.

7041
07:08:03,760 --> 07:08:04,640
Here goes.

7042
07:08:04,640 --> 07:08:07,360
So she's telling us why the gods perished.

7043
07:08:07,680 --> 07:08:11,920
Because something constantly is getting them.

7044
07:08:13,200 --> 07:08:14,800
Just like Stony Stamina.

7045
07:08:16,000 --> 07:08:17,600
Yeah, I'm refling you like that.

7046
07:08:17,600 --> 07:08:19,120
My stamina's unending.

7047
07:08:20,640 --> 07:08:22,640
It's a shame you have a refractory period.

7048
07:08:28,640 --> 07:08:33,680
It must come in with the blood of me.

7049
07:08:38,160 --> 07:08:50,160
I'm... I'm shone in this one.

7050
07:08:53,600 --> 07:08:55,520
I'm holding onto the little knob in the middle.

7051
07:09:01,120 --> 07:09:02,080
Oh, we're doing it.

7052
07:09:03,040 --> 07:09:05,440
If you want to kill us, mate,

7053
07:09:05,440 --> 07:09:07,280
you're going to have to try a little harder than that.

7054
07:09:09,360 --> 07:09:09,840
Wow.

7055
07:09:10,880 --> 07:09:11,280
We're here.

7056
07:09:13,120 --> 07:09:13,840
Music.

7057
07:09:15,520 --> 07:09:17,760
And just the beautiful scenery.

7058
07:09:17,760 --> 07:09:18,560
The details.

7059
07:09:24,800 --> 07:09:25,600
Statues.

7060
07:09:26,640 --> 07:09:27,760
Sean's right, that is.

7061
07:09:27,760 --> 07:09:28,640
I'm always right.

7062
07:09:29,520 --> 07:09:30,640
About that dead end.

7063
07:09:31,520 --> 07:09:32,320
That never happened.

7064
07:09:32,320 --> 07:09:32,880
I was misquoted.

7065
07:09:32,880 --> 07:09:35,760
Music picks up and you can hear the voices.

7066
07:09:37,360 --> 07:09:40,960
Oh, just ethereal sounding voices.

7067
07:09:43,040 --> 07:09:46,000
Just in awe and just awe.

7068
07:09:47,280 --> 07:09:48,240
This not the door.

7069
07:09:48,240 --> 07:09:48,640
Is it?

7070
07:09:48,640 --> 07:09:49,440
Am I being pranked?

7071
07:09:49,440 --> 07:09:50,560
Why does this look like the door?

7072
07:09:52,080 --> 07:09:52,800
I'm being pranked.

7073
07:09:53,840 --> 07:09:55,440
There's really a secret behind that.

7074
07:09:55,440 --> 07:09:56,720
That kind of looks like there may be a secret,

7075
07:09:56,720 --> 07:09:58,080
but maybe it's just a reused asset.

7076
07:09:58,640 --> 07:10:00,480
But all the music.

7077
07:10:02,800 --> 07:10:04,240
You think it speaks English?

7078
07:10:04,880 --> 07:10:05,520
Just say it.

7079
07:10:06,240 --> 07:10:06,560
Okay.

7080
07:10:08,480 --> 07:10:09,200
72.

7081
07:10:11,360 --> 07:10:11,680
Wow.

7082
07:10:24,640 --> 07:10:26,240
After you, I think.

7083
07:10:28,080 --> 07:10:28,800
Music.

7084
07:10:32,800 --> 07:10:34,160
Now you guys have to see this.

7085
07:10:39,360 --> 07:10:40,160
There's ethereal.

7086
07:10:48,240 --> 07:10:49,680
The apple seems to be in the center.

7087
07:10:53,600 --> 07:10:55,200
Time to find out where those temples are.

7088
07:10:55,600 --> 07:10:59,200
Okay, no.

7089
07:10:59,200 --> 07:11:00,800
This is where the sad part comes in,

7090
07:11:00,800 --> 07:11:02,240
because I always mess up the sequence.

7091
07:11:04,000 --> 07:11:04,560
I'm really.

7092
07:11:12,400 --> 07:11:13,520
Always mess up the sequence.

7093
07:11:15,600 --> 07:11:16,080
The orb.

7094
07:11:25,600 --> 07:11:28,720
Big lady.

7095
07:11:31,840 --> 07:11:32,320
Knowledge.

7096
07:11:38,480 --> 07:11:39,360
Oh, no, wisdom.

7097
07:11:39,360 --> 07:11:40,000
No, knowledge.

7098
07:11:40,000 --> 07:11:40,240
Sorry.

7099
07:11:40,240 --> 07:11:41,120
Wisdom, wisdom.

7100
07:11:44,320 --> 07:11:44,800
Oh, no.

7101
07:11:47,040 --> 07:11:47,520
Close enough.

7102
07:11:47,520 --> 07:11:48,000
Fake gamer.

7103
07:11:55,680 --> 07:11:58,800
You hear the words, but you do not know.

7104
07:12:00,560 --> 07:12:02,400
I have played this game so many times.

7105
07:12:02,400 --> 07:12:04,240
I always end up failing the levers.

7106
07:12:04,240 --> 07:12:07,920
I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever.

7107
07:12:09,600 --> 07:12:13,200
I just literally, my brain said maybe one's highlighted

7108
07:12:13,200 --> 07:12:14,000
and the other isn't.

7109
07:12:15,040 --> 07:12:16,400
How many times have I played this game

7110
07:12:16,400 --> 07:12:17,440
and never done that before?

7111
07:12:18,320 --> 07:12:20,000
I always mess up on the levers.

7112
07:12:20,000 --> 07:12:21,760
It is hard to stay contained.

7113
07:12:21,760 --> 07:12:22,480
Right, I'll be quiet.

7114
07:12:22,480 --> 07:12:25,920
Knowing as we do, we wait for you, Desmond.

7115
07:12:26,480 --> 07:12:27,520
You will come here.

7116
07:12:28,160 --> 07:12:29,280
You will activate it.

7117
07:12:30,160 --> 07:12:32,640
You will not be late.

7118
07:12:34,080 --> 07:12:35,120
Did you hear any of that?

7119
07:12:40,800 --> 07:12:44,640
I sure do love all my friends equally.

7120
07:12:44,640 --> 07:12:46,560
I love Rebecca.

7121
07:12:46,560 --> 07:12:48,320
I love Sean.

7122
07:12:48,320 --> 07:12:50,480
And I love Lucy.

7123
07:12:50,560 --> 07:12:53,520
And I'm sure all will be fine.

7124
07:12:53,520 --> 07:12:54,320
Wait, where did I go?

7125
07:12:54,320 --> 07:12:54,820
Oh.

7126
07:12:54,820 --> 07:13:20,900
So where are the temples?

7127
07:13:21,860 --> 07:13:22,820
You want me to ask it?

7128
07:13:23,700 --> 07:13:24,900
Or think it or something.

7129
07:13:32,660 --> 07:13:34,420
You sure you asked it the right thing?

7130
07:13:35,460 --> 07:13:36,020
I know this.

7131
07:13:36,020 --> 07:13:37,060
I know that symbol.

7132
07:13:37,060 --> 07:13:38,660
That, that's a Phrygian camp.

7133
07:13:39,220 --> 07:13:41,140
It stands for freedom.

7134
07:13:41,140 --> 07:13:42,740
And that, that's a Masonic eye.

7135
07:13:43,380 --> 07:13:45,620
Now those two come together in only one place.

7136
07:13:46,260 --> 07:13:46,820
What's happening?

7137
07:13:48,020 --> 07:13:49,140
I can't move.

7138
07:13:49,140 --> 07:13:51,300
Your DNA communes with the apple.

7139
07:13:51,860 --> 07:13:53,220
You have activated it.

7140
07:13:54,420 --> 07:13:54,980
Let me go.

7141
07:13:55,700 --> 07:13:58,900
On the 72nd day before the moment of awakening,

7142
07:13:59,700 --> 07:14:03,860
you, birth from our loins and the loins of our enemies.

7143
07:14:03,860 --> 07:14:07,620
The end and the beginning, who we abhor and honor.

7144
07:14:08,420 --> 07:14:10,420
The final journey commences.

7145
07:14:11,300 --> 07:14:14,260
There is one who would accompany you through the gate.

7146
07:14:14,260 --> 07:14:15,860
She lies not within our sight.

7147
07:14:16,740 --> 07:14:19,060
The cross darkens the horizon.

7148
07:14:21,620 --> 07:14:22,100
Shhh.

7149
07:14:23,940 --> 07:14:24,340
What are you doing?

7150
07:14:25,620 --> 07:14:27,140
The path must be opened.

7151
07:14:28,980 --> 07:14:31,220
You cannot escape or part in this.

7152
07:14:31,220 --> 07:14:32,980
The scales shall be balanced.

7153
07:14:36,260 --> 07:14:36,980
Name the map.

7154
07:14:36,980 --> 07:14:37,700
Stop.

7155
07:14:37,700 --> 07:14:38,100
Please.

7156
07:14:39,220 --> 07:14:41,060
You know very little.

7157
07:14:41,060 --> 07:14:42,260
We must guide you.

7158
07:14:47,060 --> 07:14:47,700
Oh.

7159
07:14:47,700 --> 07:14:49,140
The Mason or struggle.

7160
07:14:51,620 --> 07:14:55,620
No.

7161
07:15:08,660 --> 07:15:09,460
It is done.

7162
07:15:10,420 --> 07:15:12,340
The way lies all before you.

7163
07:15:13,140 --> 07:15:15,540
Only she remains to be found.

7164
07:15:16,420 --> 07:15:17,700
Awaken the six.

7165
07:15:18,660 --> 07:15:19,620
Go.

7166
07:15:19,620 --> 07:15:20,100
Alone.

7167
07:15:21,300 --> 07:15:31,300
No.

7168
07:15:40,180 --> 07:15:41,380
Really don't like that.

7169
07:15:43,940 --> 07:15:44,980
Really don't like that.

7170
07:15:46,180 --> 07:15:50,020
For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers.

7171
07:15:51,300 --> 07:15:54,260
We were in Abstergo's headquarters.

7172
07:15:54,980 --> 07:15:59,460
And she broke us out because she was pretending to be a Templar.

7173
07:15:59,460 --> 07:16:00,900
She's actually an assassin.

7174
07:16:02,100 --> 07:16:04,660
And then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

7175
07:16:05,460 --> 07:16:07,780
Which is the sequel.

7176
07:16:09,540 --> 07:16:14,740
And she got identified as a double crossing agent twice over.

7177
07:16:15,780 --> 07:16:16,980
Which made no sense.

7178
07:16:17,860 --> 07:16:19,300
Because why would she break us out?

7179
07:16:19,540 --> 07:16:26,820
And if you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in Exio's story.

7180
07:16:26,820 --> 07:16:27,460
Oh yeah sorry.

7181
07:16:27,460 --> 07:16:28,740
In Desmond's storyline.

7182
07:16:28,740 --> 07:16:29,220
Shit.

7183
07:16:29,220 --> 07:16:30,340
He's gone into shock.

7184
07:16:30,340 --> 07:16:31,540
Put him back in the machine.

7185
07:16:31,540 --> 07:16:32,740
It's the only way to fix this.

7186
07:16:32,740 --> 07:16:34,180
But the Animus did this to me.

7187
07:16:34,180 --> 07:16:35,140
Am I the expert or not?

7188
07:16:36,260 --> 07:16:36,660
Do it.

7189
07:16:40,740 --> 07:16:44,660
The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because

7190
07:16:44,740 --> 07:16:50,420
she asked for like the revenue.

7191
07:16:52,180 --> 07:16:54,420
Not for like a payout for her voice.

7192
07:16:54,420 --> 07:16:56,660
But for the revenue split thing that they do.

7193
07:16:58,340 --> 07:16:59,780
I can never remember the word.

7194
07:17:00,980 --> 07:17:03,780
Like where you get like payouts constantly.

7195
07:17:04,500 --> 07:17:05,460
Like for your voice.

7196
07:17:06,820 --> 07:17:08,660
And royalties.

7197
07:17:08,660 --> 07:17:10,100
Yes royalties.

7198
07:17:10,100 --> 07:17:13,140
She knew she was onto something.

7199
07:17:13,140 --> 07:17:14,900
She was an Assassin's Creed 2.

7200
07:17:14,900 --> 07:17:16,180
Then she's in a second game.

7201
07:17:16,180 --> 07:17:17,380
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

7202
07:17:17,940 --> 07:17:19,700
And she said royalties.

7203
07:17:20,260 --> 07:17:22,980
And that end sequence was then created.

7204
07:17:23,620 --> 07:17:27,300
Because at no point do the gods speak of present day issues.

7205
07:17:27,940 --> 07:17:30,020
And if you listen to the gods words.

7206
07:17:30,660 --> 07:17:32,420
It was like you don't understand.

7207
07:17:32,420 --> 07:17:33,460
We need to teach you.

7208
07:17:34,020 --> 07:17:37,540
The gods should not interact with Desmond on that level.

7209
07:17:37,540 --> 07:17:38,260
Lore wise.

7210
07:17:38,900 --> 07:17:42,660
And because she wanted royalties killed her.

7211
07:17:42,660 --> 07:17:43,140
In plot.

7212
07:17:43,140 --> 07:17:45,300
And they said yeah well we don't need you anymore.

7213
07:17:46,340 --> 07:17:47,940
So thanks Ubisoft.

7214
07:17:47,940 --> 07:17:50,340
Absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline.

7215
07:17:52,740 --> 07:17:55,860
And yeah I hope your shareholders are happy.

7216
07:17:55,860 --> 07:17:57,300
Because you ruin it for the people.

7217
07:17:59,140 --> 07:18:00,260
But other than that.

7218
07:18:00,980 --> 07:18:02,980
Other than that really annoying fact.

7219
07:18:05,300 --> 07:18:07,220
Otherwise incredibly good game.

7220
07:18:08,740 --> 07:18:09,860
Incredibly good game.

7221
07:18:10,820 --> 07:18:13,860
I elect to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive.

7222
07:18:13,860 --> 07:18:16,740
And acting as an Assassin.

7223
07:18:16,740 --> 07:18:17,540
And all of that.

7224
07:18:17,540 --> 07:18:18,020
So yeah.

7225
07:18:28,100 --> 07:18:30,660
Oh and the VA for Rosa passed away.

7226
07:18:30,660 --> 07:18:31,540
I didn't know that.

7227
07:18:39,860 --> 07:18:43,860
But yes.

7228
07:18:43,860 --> 07:18:46,660
That is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

7229
07:18:46,660 --> 07:18:50,100
It's absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience.

7230
07:18:50,900 --> 07:18:58,180
If you ignore the very ending dialogue and occurrences.

7231
07:18:59,380 --> 07:19:01,540
But that was amazing game.

7232
07:19:01,540 --> 07:19:03,220
And I absolutely love Nerd and Abode.

7233
07:19:04,100 --> 07:19:05,860
I'm probably going to do the Borgia towers.

7234
07:19:05,860 --> 07:19:07,940
I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet.

7235
07:19:08,900 --> 07:19:11,540
So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now.

7236
07:19:11,540 --> 07:19:13,460
And their eyes are bulging out of their skull.

7237
07:19:13,460 --> 07:19:16,100
Because of how much they need to sleep right now.

7238
07:19:16,100 --> 07:19:17,540
I'm very sorry.

7239
07:19:17,540 --> 07:19:19,860
I'm really enjoying this game.

7240
07:19:19,860 --> 07:19:21,220
And yeah.

7241
07:19:22,100 --> 07:19:23,780
Are you still doing the second stream?

7242
07:19:23,780 --> 07:19:24,180
Yes.

7243
07:19:24,180 --> 07:19:26,980
So today I was to finish the campaign mode.

7244
07:19:26,980 --> 07:19:29,780
And tomorrow we're going to 100% this game.

7245
07:19:29,780 --> 07:19:32,980
Because I have never 100%ed this game before.

7246
07:19:32,980 --> 07:19:34,340
Always wanted to try.

7247
07:19:34,340 --> 07:19:35,300
Never did it.

7248
07:19:35,300 --> 07:19:38,900
I believe I may have 100%ed Assassin's Creed 2.

7249
07:19:38,900 --> 07:19:39,860
Achievement wise.

7250
07:19:41,380 --> 07:19:44,660
Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers.

7251
07:19:44,660 --> 07:19:48,020
But we can talk about that when we play it.

7252
07:19:48,020 --> 07:19:49,220
On June.

7253
07:19:49,940 --> 07:19:50,420
June.

7254
07:19:50,420 --> 07:19:51,780
On October 8th.

7255
07:19:57,780 --> 07:19:58,580
I'll keep going.

7256
07:19:58,580 --> 07:20:00,020
I've got a couple more hours in me.

7257
07:20:00,020 --> 07:20:00,420
Oh yeah.

7258
07:20:00,420 --> 07:20:00,740
Damn.

7259
07:20:00,740 --> 07:20:01,780
You got the stamina in it.

7260
07:20:06,260 --> 07:20:06,740
Hmmmm.

7261
07:20:07,540 --> 07:20:08,100
Yes.

7262
07:20:10,260 --> 07:20:12,180
All the feathers took so long.

7263
07:20:14,580 --> 07:20:16,100
Schedule set for October.

7264
07:20:16,100 --> 07:20:18,820
So my birthday is October 10th.

7265
07:20:19,460 --> 07:20:21,620
Which is when I will do my donathon.

7266
07:20:21,620 --> 07:20:25,780
And for my birthday I would like to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood all over again.

7267
07:20:26,340 --> 07:20:28,660
But I'm gonna play it utmost line.

7268
07:20:28,660 --> 07:20:34,420
So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2 campaign.

7269
07:20:34,420 --> 07:20:41,700
then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then Brotherhood on the 10th and the 11th

7270
07:20:41,700 --> 07:20:51,540
and then on the 12th and the 13th would be Revelations and we will complete its use storyline.

7271
07:20:52,740 --> 07:20:57,380
I'm not very well versed in Revelations, I have played it a couple of times but I'm not as well

7272
07:20:57,460 --> 07:21:03,700
versed so I probably can't Japanese about the best strategies for the game.

7273
07:21:06,180 --> 07:21:12,100
Are you doing the strong new passive and you present it? I don't know, I've been looking at

7274
07:21:12,100 --> 07:21:18,180
some ASMR challenges like the 8 hour ASMR stream challenge, maybe I might consider that although

7275
07:21:18,180 --> 07:21:24,500
my voice breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do.

7276
07:21:27,460 --> 07:21:30,260
You should watch Embers after Revelations.

7277
07:21:34,500 --> 07:21:40,340
I would make a reminder for those days. I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule

7278
07:21:40,340 --> 07:21:48,100
for this week um after the needy streamer overload I think it's like a two hour game

7279
07:21:48,100 --> 07:21:56,260
question mark um I actually need to go and buy the American candy um and those European

7280
07:21:56,580 --> 07:22:02,500
sweets because I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff uh because I'm

7281
07:22:02,500 --> 07:22:13,860
doing a hand cam stream. Um Strani, if mummy goat is our mum are you the granny? Don't look into

7282
07:22:13,860 --> 07:22:20,180
the lore too much of how velour came to be. Technically there are five children birthed from

7283
07:22:20,180 --> 07:22:28,260
my loins. Whispering's bad for your voice but yes I may or may not need a really big pee now that I

7284
07:22:28,260 --> 07:22:35,860
have just been aware of my bladder. I just sat on my foot uh like against well you know against what

7285
07:22:35,860 --> 07:22:40,900
and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation I'm like ah yes yes I believe I need to pee.

7286
07:22:41,540 --> 07:22:52,420
Oh mother mary virgin birth uh no sorry it was the reeflings doing oopsies.

7287
07:22:53,700 --> 07:22:58,820
That is the marabout going wild that's all I'm saying. I don't know how we got it we didn't get

7288
07:22:58,820 --> 07:23:07,460
kicked out of that convention. So I am taking drinkies of water which flows this track and

7289
07:23:07,460 --> 07:23:15,380
then puts my hypnosis on. But yes we'll take a very quick pee break. Um I might make a second

7290
07:23:15,380 --> 07:23:21,060
cup uh well be my third cup of tea but my second that I'll drink on stream with you. Uh I just need

7291
07:23:21,060 --> 07:23:26,580
water and drink I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me. I have been

7292
07:23:26,580 --> 07:23:36,100
satiated I thank you for letting me eat on stream. Stream elements is how we pitch child support.

7293
07:23:36,100 --> 07:23:41,540
Yeah I don't know what's going on. I unironically think you guys were given like so much money

7294
07:23:41,540 --> 07:23:48,180
collectively to the girls once the tip page was up that uh you guys broke the paypal uh

7295
07:23:49,860 --> 07:23:55,780
yeah. So thanks for giving us so much money that uh paypal is now investigating the account or

7296
07:23:55,780 --> 07:24:01,380
something I don't know. Uh but yeah if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch

7297
07:24:01,380 --> 07:24:07,300
they get 100% of the earnings. None of it goes to the other and all the girls will uh say that they

7298
07:24:07,300 --> 07:24:13,140
own the ubu market uh accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff we did not

7299
07:24:13,140 --> 07:24:20,660
touch it nothing to do with us. So yeah uh hopefully monetization on youtube stats

7300
07:24:20,660 --> 07:24:27,540
statistics uh update because my statistics were like yeah you have 80 watch hours and I'm like

7301
07:24:27,540 --> 07:24:34,180
are you sure about that? Are you sure youtube? Because I don't think so. All the merch is so

7302
07:24:34,180 --> 07:24:39,540
cute. I'm so excited for the keychain to arrive and I'll do tap tap tap play some more.

7303
07:24:46,500 --> 07:24:55,380
So dramatic. Unfortunately the credits go for a bit and they're unskippable but I do want to

7304
07:24:56,020 --> 07:25:05,060
special shout out to uh uh Alex Tremblay for the data manager. Shout out to Robert Mullen the

7305

7311
07:25:49,540 --> 07:25:53,940

7312
07:25:53,940 --> 07:25:59,620
give me like seven to eight business days to update your stats because I can apply for

7313
07:25:59,620 --> 07:26:06,260
partnership uh monetization like right now. Well I should be able to but the stats don't say I have

7314
07:26:06,260 --> 07:26:13,780
the watch time but I do have the watch time so uh but hopefully we can get our monetization streams

7315
07:26:13,860 --> 07:26:17,940
and then you know all that. I have no idea how long this PayPal issue is gonna last but

7316
07:26:19,780 --> 07:26:23,300
you guys gave literally and ironically gave so much money that they can't burst.

7317
07:26:25,700 --> 07:26:34,980
I have like 10 watchers alone. I miss adobe flash player. Binding up Isaac started on it but I never

7318
07:26:34,980 --> 07:26:38,980
actually played it at that stage. I only played it like a couple moves back.

7319
07:26:51,060 --> 07:26:57,780
I like the enemies in this game as well. Have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like

7320
07:26:57,780 --> 07:26:59,780
uh

7321
07:27:03,460 --> 07:27:12,820
I like as well uh the plot line that love Volpe is so like I know it's you Nicolo I know it's you

7322
07:27:12,820 --> 07:27:17,140
and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time. I like stories like that

7323
07:27:17,140 --> 07:27:24,420
because it's like no no you're wrong please but thank goodness we did the no swim part that was

7324
07:27:24,420 --> 07:27:30,500
awful grabbed a poor man's horse ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like

7325
07:27:30,500 --> 07:27:37,540
dived across this like bean of rope. Would you consider playing Binding of Isaac on stream?

7326
07:27:37,540 --> 07:27:45,540
Oh boy you're in for a treat. In November the uh official multiplayer for a Binding of Isaac

7327
07:27:45,540 --> 07:27:52,580
goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys. Um we will be streaming that game often

7328
07:27:52,580 --> 07:27:59,700
I am uh addicted to it. I've not before anyone asks have you done Dead God? No I've not done Dead

7329
07:27:59,700 --> 07:28:07,940
God. I currently am at like uh I think it's like 1,000 of 1% and it's stop that's where I'm at on

7330
07:28:07,940 --> 07:28:13,540
one fail. I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files but uh it definitely is going to be a

7331
07:28:13,540 --> 07:28:20,020
consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer

7332
07:28:20,020 --> 07:28:25,620
game of that week and then like we'll pick a different multiplayer game type thing um would you

7333
07:28:25,620 --> 07:28:38,660
be fantastic? Ooh Binding of Isaac is hardly it is a randomized kind of dungeon crawler but there's

7334
07:28:38,660 --> 07:28:45,700
a lot of interesting story in the background of it um I really enjoy it I actually want to make a

7335
07:28:45,700 --> 07:28:52,980
review on this game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and as well as Binding of Isaac and Call of the

7336
07:28:52,980 --> 07:28:59,060
Lamb basically I want to make like real game reviews but only on games that I think are 10

7337
07:28:59,060 --> 07:29:06,180
out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bringing up like how flawless the uh in

7338
07:29:06,180 --> 07:29:12,180
rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just

7339
07:29:12,180 --> 07:29:18,420
really stood out like I just really like anything would be so nice to try it like um as much as we

7340
07:29:18,420 --> 07:29:24,340
all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely uh thank you

7341
07:29:26,340 --> 07:29:32,260
please keep yapping I enjoy it if you like the Binding of Isaac I highly recommend Noeta I have

7342
07:29:32,260 --> 07:29:38,980
never heard of Noeta uh is it like Pixley like Isaac as well

7343
07:29:41,220 --> 07:29:47,860
from how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews uh I've got it as a

7344
07:29:47,860 --> 07:29:54,980
donathon like reward it would take a lot of effort though like I definitely think after my

7345
07:29:54,980 --> 07:30:00,420
donathon is finished I'll probably have a few shorter games back to back and the reason for

7346
07:30:00,420 --> 07:30:07,620
that is because I'll be like working on rewards um I I literally want to like fire the rewards as

7347
07:30:07,620 --> 07:30:17,380
soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that um Noeta runs can go for hours oh Isaac

7348
07:30:17,380 --> 07:30:24,660
runs are like one hour sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30

7349
07:30:24,740 --> 07:30:33,380
minutes with Isaac um yeah start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn

7350
07:30:33,380 --> 07:30:37,860
your your hypnosis you will like this game that's so good you will like this game you will like this

7351
07:30:37,860 --> 07:30:46,900

7356
07:31:16,500 --> 07:31:22,580
money on our persons this is a bit more money than uh I think you actually need it so it's

7357
07:31:22,580 --> 07:31:28,020
given capitalism it's so it's given capitalism so put it back and invest in properties and stuff

7358
07:31:28,020 --> 07:31:33,380
I am going to send the birds away sorry I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit
