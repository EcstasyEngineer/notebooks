for the girls to talk about the interview process with me uh basically if you're interested in Vealer I was the barrier okay I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content if you applied and I was like you and you know um it's a bit it's a bit awkward I'll say I'll say this part out loud it was a bit morally hmm because I was judging v-tubers that had way more streaming experience than me to be like oh you're worthy to come in or not and it's like hmm it wasn't a nice feeling kind of like being like no but can't want me um right okay questions most basic why are you called vealer now check out the v at the start virtual as most agencies start with a v for virtual okay and then the a okay now now put v and a together okay what do you get you get voice acting voice acting okay and the girls are doing amateur voice acting audios oh my god oh my god you did it you did it you put it together also wait wait wait hold on hold on let's read it together let's read it together v okay and then imagine if there was an imaginary dash allure allure as if the girls were alluring oh my oh my god put it together we've done it lads we've cracked the fucking case okay that's why it can't feel allure there's no other thing to it okay I thought it was pretty self like explanatory but it was okay it wasn't I was like ve allure okay ve allure but we got so many different pronunciations I think if you have an american you're like ve allure and it's like I never really thought about other accents saying it because obviously I want to accent but here you go um oh no questions why you call vealer how hand on are you with the talents the talents can do whatever the fuck they want they don't come to me for permission they don't have to come to me I want to do this I want to the only thing they come to me with this they go I want a project I want this I want that I want this asset then they come to me and I sugar mummy them and I'll be like there you go darlin all yours hen poppy pop girls do what they want they do not need permission for in real life hand cam streams for example none of that shit you guys have to understand we're all adults here I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child and they need permission from me to work okay because as it stands they're you know doing work and streaming and all that you do not need permission to okay so we don't do none of that shit around here one of the funniest comments I had seen so far was uh management's gonna run away with the money aren't we oh you've caught me you've caught me was the 8020 split showing

because obviously i had to order it in a round because i didn't know them yet there you go uh lore okay so this is this is super behind scene stuff so again squishy girl conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore story board looks like i'm giving you the hints so this is a zura for example so as you can see uh the script right away the earth was driven out baron and infancy then from dusk to darkness was the first family so this is called concept art for the lore that was given to tea temachi temachi i would say timati but that's my accent uh so that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of temachi watch oh temachi's in chat temachi temachi temachi let's go squishy girls in chat but you know he's coming he's coming okay but let's go temachi in chat so i'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold on hold on let me cook let me cook let me cook let me cook so to give you a very quick example i can only do it for my lore but here are the first three concept panels so gull did the concept panels along with the script so concept one two and three and then temachi saw it and then come oh it's a bit big hold on a minute hold on hold on uh uh uh it's very skull but let's be honest this is never gonna be professional anyway ship one so temachi comes back with the sketch and you know so literally we go from uh well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with the sketch absolutely beautiful garden beautiful beautiful and she and then with the approval of the storyboard and the sketch then the full images come through and these come through all layered these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was because temachi just worked so diligently so hard they were an absolute pleasure to work with i cannot recommend temachi enough for like you know i gave her a lot of work like i could i could you know i was insane work but as you can see from the finished result of the lores temachi and beautiful that i look five star meal all the michelin stars or however they do it actually i don't know how michelin stars work but yes so that's the behind the scenes of kind of the development of the lore so again squishy gull not only did he do the storyboard he also did the scripts in the background lores of the girls but i will come back to the development of the girls very shortly um if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls but again in order to help artists it's so to make things such a smooth process behind the scenes um having a concept artist to give the actual artists an idea of what you want helps so i hope i'm not spoiling the merch that's coming out but this is a zura a little aces concept these are concepts of the merchandise that you see on ubu market right now i'll talk about now um and then a little mersey and shibi and but yeah again these are just concepts a beautiful behind the scenes stuff it's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development okay now now you're going to start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly but um please please read please read thank you for reading uh if we need to hire talent managers we will open a position i am so thankful for everyone applying but for god's sake some of you are glowing for grooming the girls i i kid you not i've had some emails that are like hi uh i want to be a talent manager nay portfolio nay history nay evidence of anything nay like nay communication i'm so thankful you want to work for the girls i'm so thankful you want to groom them because you like them that much my guy this agency we groom you full stop that's the sense okay so nice try but if i need talent managers i'll post it on the website for the jobs that we need right okay this is where the cringe comes in this is where the really the developmental cringe comes in okay so i'm gonna read it out to you don't worry if you can't read neither can i but i'll try my best to read it out so when it comes to concepts okay as you'll notice these girls don't have names because because the girls started without names that's how it is so for the lore for girl one it was it was the best we got to hang out together we ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up i couldn't have asked for anything more that night it was a shame that the truth never came out that i could never tell my redacted that i love him before it was too late it's not fair now i'm some what and now i'm somewhere i don't recognize and i'll never see him again you'll still watch over me from where you are now though hmm wonder wonder who that is um but these are kind of description lores very quick description okay uh girl lore two um when there's no one around to spoil what am i gonna do with myself i've got no purpose if i don't have a a sweetheart to show my love okay yeah that was that was a zura that was a zura that's where she started from see a zura was giving more of a kind of servant goddess role but that definitely didn't really come into play um mersey ostempai i know you're around here you're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so i'd stop news flash baby i love you far too much to ever give up the chase isn't it fun when your heart is practically beaten out of your chest manik i'd do manic laughter but mersey absolutely fucking uh she mugs me with her laugh oh wait you're not senpai but you could be from the one so you know if you don't know mersey kind of you know you know how it goes with them four four four okay four i have you're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy i quit whoever made this game who even made this game and i read that wrong whoever even made this game in the first place what's the point in putting achievements in a game if only 0.2 percent of the player base can even achieve it screw this i'm going on a really a website okay now what's the category tonight oh let's do a random roulette our discord okay as you can see aces come a very long way okay that's not aces lore at all that's not a concept we're not even there okay lore five i cannot for the life of me understand how guys work how do their brains even function if only there is some sort of way i could get them to be truthful with me um and yeah so i always started with a hypno theme obviously i got to pick what the fuck i want to be because i was there from the start i was always gonna have hypno uh i just didn't know what angle we were going for and then uh i got conceptualized and wanting to kill all of humanity so yeah i didn't do that part by the way before you're like oh my god you're killing now uh no sorry i'm rubbing my face heat and then six um six uh it should be yeah um i've had it bunny boys are pathetic they can never keep up with me and i don't know why i bother wasting my time i just need something different human males surely can keep up with this stamina of my needs type thing okay so that's how the girls started okay they all started deeply departed so that's it all right okay this is a really fun this is i hated naming everyone i hated it i hated it the the reason why you don't see emmy bezu right now is because emmy bezu was named correctly azura you were a nightmare to name oh my god i went through so many names i literally came up with stacey milkerton azura you were so hard to name for no reason you can literally see how desperate i was getting through your name i was like stacey milkerton miss milkerton milfoo pillow show show means darling in french yeah right she's a goat god fawness inis milfoo inis milf shoe milf is in milf for you fondula fondula bosom azura daily which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay oh my god do you know do you see the techniques to fondula bosom as well that's because i approved that name for azura as fondula bosom what was i thinking oh right okay now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore mersey was originally stavitha brave brave what was i thinking and then if she was eastern european we were going to change it to slavitha what was that smoton and then i approved the name karam bit so instead of karam bit as a sharp weapon bit in french of a male is the literal translation so the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact i'm such a dumbass karam's name got past development so mersey was called karam until about a month ago it was awful absolutely awful don't let me cook ever again i'm not naming anyone after this right acy acy's a lie do you want to know what acy's real name was joy stick with an i acy was not developed as a polar bear i'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly her name was joy stick yes that's true now acy umka is russian unbelievably what are the odds because acy does speak russian but our concept did name was always acy we liked acy from the star okay we liked acy from the star so it was acy umka which i think means bear or paw and russian i can't remember it's one or the other something like that and then acy's show um for acy hot as in opposites but she was always going to be a polar bear uh and then we got bandar like bandar is that like a kind of mythological angle and then we got acy snow paws and i was like that's absolutely adorable i love it it's easy to remember like i know some people are dogging on the names like i'm sorry but we're in english speaking agency i don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and acy name like in japanese i just i'm like i'm not gonna remember it joy stick chod um me i was pretty quick i knew i was going to be strongy off the bat i knew i was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strongium it's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like it's a literal thing don't worry i was always going to be strongy but it was like i don't know where 365 i actually don't remember 365 at all don't remember it spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl that's because i approved it and then you know i was a cutler fish and i was like you know what strongy calls locket and boys and then she be because of her shabari rope she was always going to be she be like she be um and then we really liked cotton but obviously there's a you know cotton tails a vea so we didn't want to step on anyone's tail you know i'm shining um so we got cotton bud and then we got cotton more but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum and then we're like that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members of veal or have a tail she's a distant relative yeah honestly it's fine we were not wanting to step on anyone name wise but yeah as i said emi is not here because emi's name got nailed off the bat i don't care what anyone says i have never named someone more perfect than emi but i promise you i'm not naming anyone else after this because uh i people are kind of like oh why why the french route um i don't know i think it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like but clap along with me chat emi ac gb strongy merci that's a rough like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion okay so yeah um okay this is just a bit uh feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails uh the dev team get back to me a lot um if you are applying to be an editor some people do so submit it we're always kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself if you apply and be like hey i want to be an editor right and you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits bro we're not gonna reply you're wasting your time you need apply yeah do not apply with fondle it's crazy right right don't it right i know it was a bad name okay let me let me care um we've had some music creators reach out that's fantastic that do original songs so for the vealer members that want to pursue um singing uh there might be original songs coming out uh there's a few song covers i'm gonna try and i think shivi has an interest i'm gonna try and poke zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice is just for it and uh hot to the cleavage right enough to i tried my best but zura was hard to name but come on zura duly literally um goddess of milk if you will um oh this is the most embarrassing part the first name a concept for the agency was vee sucky and now we are all succubus and the motto would you survive if you met one of us like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow because i don't like when uh vtuber stories like all connect like me and icy would never meet because i'm in the water and she's on land type thing like i don't like when agencies like force the lord to come together so a concept of that and i was like no we're not so before anyone makes fun of veal lord veal lord terrible name we could have been vee sucky okay as in short for virtual succubus so uh i will not be taking any statements and things okay okay you're all done okay this is just a fun behind the scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works they are magnificent and made all of our loading screens as you can see these are just the concepts but they're still stunning and it's nice to see behind the scenes stuff but um mercedes was influenced by the joker being surrounded by knives in the batman scene unironically ac if you didn't catch ac's um loading screen is a bit melo melakoli melakoli um where the a the borealis that comes up lights up her thingy but hers is a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family mel melakolic isn't colic when babies are crying aurora borealis i always want to say ariola borealis and i'm like i'm pretty sure that means a nip but i'm trying i'm trying bruv uh she be nailed off the bat um i wanted everyone's mascot to be a part of the loading screen because i just find that stuff adorable and yes veal lord did premake all the mascots uh emmy uh elected to change hers absolutely fine no problems like we're not a dictating agency the girls can come to me and be like i didn't like that i want something else yeah that's fine um uh azura you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut um um but yeah this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god it's tempa fish uh surprise you know how on debut i was like i have ace more clubs planned with other vtubers yes well tempa fish is one of them um but yes this is just kind of behind the scenes art just to see how it comes together nah right okay okay this next step so everyone likes the designs yeah all the designs ten over ten aren't they oh we just love the design we did not we did not look like how we look no okay we do not look like how we look no yeah yikes now emmy and azura emmy and azura yeah uh i just yeah so as you can see ac isn't even in the lineup yet five is me uh i always had bunch uh double bunches in my hair so i have two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories but there's actually two bubbles but yeah sheebie was also with uh triple seas uh azura and thingy but then you know things changed so then the next lineup were like right change up next lineup acsies with us let's go um uh mersey's hair has changed so she no longer has drills uh i've changed a bit i've got like these weird spirals in my hair but i quite like that it's quite unique uh sheebie is still purple we're changing you but we do have ac developed okay we have ac developed now okay change again right body type change on sheebie uh strone complete change on strone mersey again still the wrong hair color and then next okay let's try again and as you can see heights were established and names were established but my height got changed sheebie's got changed azura became taller because we made her a giant test if you didn't know azura can be as tall as a skyscraper now there's not an definite height but yeah um mersey's coming out with a short very shortly about her being blonde you'll like it um and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time so sheebie got her hair spirals um her ears concepted and then i started to come to life um as you can see i have little shoesies on the shoesies got taken away why am i in a different style where i had to go a different concept ours because we were struggling at the time um and then eventually ac was getting developed so this that was her first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there as you see mersey's hair is still wrong they took your kicks i know they yanked my shoes give me them back actually oh my god i should be like right there we go so we're going to take it from the top the first girl developed uh what am i doing for time oh i'm actually not doing bad for time let's go let's go that's what i'm talking about um i was good i was good uh right we're going to take it from this top emi was the first conceptualized vealer girl okay but she didn't look like that at the start boom oh wait wrong one wrong one hold on hold on out wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on the wrong one don't don't like don't like no no no right there we go boom this is the first official concept of emi yeah that's what emi emi looks like at the start you can kind of see it the she's got the sneakers she's got the the hoodie the hair's orange but uh it's giving it's giving best friendo next door it's not giving emi isn't frankie oh honestly yeah i said squish her down make her a wee one so then we got her squished down uh we're starting to get her definitely getting her silhouette going on but no pins we do have her uh how you call them uh pumpkins in her hair have been established at this point yeah she got hydraulic pressed and then we're like and back to the drawing board go next what i was like hold on a minute hold on a minute we're cooking we are cooking by gas okay so we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art so then we gave her the old overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by recoloring them she got recolored uh there we go that was it that was it boom recolored and just like that there's emi that's emi there's emi there she is uh so gave her the old overwatch skin color change and boom and then there is some behind scenes banner this commission wasn't able to be finished em but i thought show it off anyway this is by papa perrito incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time due to life constraints however i know you won't be able to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyrim reference sweet mother sweet mother sent your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear it is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satan that was her reference for the banner okay up next azura or should i say they say milkerton uh here we go boom okay so that was her name hardy hardy hard yeah yeah i'm glad it name in so this was her banner concept that ended up becoming her loading screen this is our banner concept it didn't get finished but this is now her new loading fonder the bosom so development on azura was so simple it was easy peasy lemon so easy we had thick goddess straight from the bat we knew we wanted her thick we had horns concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next boom she's already there you know what's different but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest easiest design honestly so as you can see she's pretty much there so as we progress right something's not right with the legs right okay boom we've now got stirrup thigh highs you are welcome chocolate stirrup thigh high stye words and stuff okay right right what's what's missing hold on what's missing something's not quite finished with her markings yes that makes sense she's a goddess add them markings so nose arm thigh add them markings okay okay we're kicking work again we're kicking and then oh what was that did you see that did you see that change on the thigh boom little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous and then next next next what's next uh i think that's actually an older one there and i was just thinking that and then boom she got her toe rings added let's go toe rings and then we have azura there we go she was uh i was going to be a milk god night is it very very simplistic very easy very quick uh right please hold on to your hats because i present to you ac no not that that's that's ac uh yeah that was ac um enjoy okay ac was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer okay we kept the insomniatic vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate unless they're pregnant so if see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now okay she doesn't need to hibernate however please i would like to draw your attention to the pause see those neon blue pause they were supposed to follow her around polar bear pause oh okay so we took it from there we took it from there yeah that's actually that's where we started and then we got the polar bear pause added in these antenna things and it just wasn't a looking mate wasn't a wasn't a congealing and then look at that look at the bell the belly button please analyze the belly button for me because there's a little polar bear piercing on her stomach uh yeah originally she was to have a wee person and uh both the concept artist and i were like look it's not working out we're gonna need to be we're gonna need gonna need you to cook so whoa we're changing it up so ac had little little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable and the top of her shirt's all ripped up but she has like big baggy sleeves so it's getting very cute it does look a bit sleep whereas but she had a little piercing as well her little tummy pierce and we're getting a bit closer to ice save you know today and then okay we got another design we've taken away the long sleeve so we're not quite there yet we're not quite there yet hold on hold on okay okay we're getting a bit more primal now look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check okay gloves are on check well they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws mm-hmm so we had a little comparison and then whoa hold on hold on we have paws established we have an ace tape design established very bear esque and then yeah we got we got there so she has her insomniatic eyes on she has a toggle for insomniatic eyes but she's insomniatic but take a look at her feet they're so different she had open toe boots she had her little toes out but you can see she definitely has clothes at this part of development but she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing and and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage lane because she has a little something there emi is true petan but ac has just a just a little hint of something you know uh oh this shouldn't be in the middle of it but this was her banner concept because she's a little insomniac okay she's a little insomniac she's so tired she's up at 3am so this was her banner but it didn't get finished uh due to time constraints absolutely no fall of papaparito at all he was fantastic this very adorable banner and yeah as i said the name concepts and then this was her first model uh draft not model sorry like the the the the draft of the model and we were like or was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and squished um and then there's isy uh and yeah where she is that's isy cool she was definitely a bit more difficult in development just because we i gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist so that's on me so she took a wee bit longer to get there okay uh for mercy uh please remember her code name was karam i may accidentally refer to her as karam i've called her karam for an entire year please understand please forgive okay this was a banner that was supposed to be for mercy um it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was a bit insidiousness and in background and uh going on but yes so originally originally mercy had twin tails uh or drills kind of looking thing going on um but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift i believe it's a terminology for that um i stole her wig honestly um but yeah uh we definitely were really close to mercy right from the start but she was blonde would it be blonde i know um and then we showed her stomach and it was like okay okay okay and then we got blonde and alterations in comparison but now obviously you've seen her purple so she's purple you know what i'm saying her hair is purple uh but now that i see blonde mercy it does not like it looks wrong to me because it's like that's not how it should be looking um and then we got purple eyes here we're the purple beam right now and then boom we got her mercy starts i've not called her karan by accident in so long but yeah there you go she was relatively there she was there from the start honestly not too much of a issue you know you can see the comparison um shebe shebe i'm sorry to expose you like this this is the first sign of shebe i'm sorry okay we thought of a rabbit with her ears up okay we're sorry i'm sorry okay i'm sorry i'm sorry okay so you were supposed to have mercy no not fondle of booze i'm this is shebe cotton boom okay we didn't go with the design before anyone said we didn't go with the design relax who said finnaf bonnie that's awful don't speak for the rest of the stream we didn't go for the design so um azura was already established to be purple at this point so we were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed so she became like the stereotypical milk body type of double bander hips um and then but we're still purple and we were having i'll be honest this was getting really frustration frustration lovely this was getting really frustrating at this point in development shebe we had been cooking for a bit and we were really struggling like but then we had i don't think these are in order no they're not oh well hey ho so we were having color palette issues i liked the outfit i liked everything about it but the hair the color palette was just not working so i went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different pose and we went with two hairstyles let's say give me this hairstyle uh she looks like a fucking giraffe so no we didn't go with a bloody pony tail she looks like some sort of horse a cheval like umpard like i didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber we ain't the agency for you because i'm not interested in horse girls okay but we got the drills and if you didn't know shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom uh it's a very small detail very small detail come ride this pony honestly oh that's why you've got a raiden crop you're a secret horse vtuber all along shebe i can't believe it got you in 4k but yeah um as you can see the gear um it was always a part like the anklet the hand cuffs were always going to be a part of her design and then we got our first model back and we were like uh excuse me where's the thickness like give a sound like this and then you know came along and then hey oh it's so easy easy not it's not the main focus not the main focus okay this was her banner concept uh again banner concept my legs are long these are your banner concepts but uh unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production but this was to be the banner it's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too a bit too spacey a bit too spacey for youtube was here right my turn womp womp womp there's strong air womp womp there's me strong zoop there we are that's me at the start of development do you like it what do you think is it good is it peak quick i'm gonna very quickly go get a cool look because my voice is dying give me one second i know streamers are supposed to mute with the oh i just i don't know if you heard me stand on that but i don't streamers are supposed to mute i stopped my tool when i left the room that actually really hurt okay so yeah uh my development was different because i was allowed to dictate my design okay so we started with hypnosis and then i was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking ass you don't watch that you're done you're done okay so i was a squiddle and then so this design don't write this design off i want to develop this further i love the color scheme i love the bikini type thing going on um the only thing that kill oh wait i need to open my collar the only thing like i think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because i love those like cat ear looking things on me and i'll have my little shell on my hair at this point zelda looking ass no don't insult her i think it's really good i really like this design i like the color scheme with the browns and the kind of black thing going on it's good it's good you know lung cook lung cook so i originally wasn't going to have any booba basically because um but then that got changed because i technically have five children with emi and aise and azura and merese and shivi so i originally didn't have any chest size but then we retcon that because technically uh yeah very big on the dumpy so i had clocks for hypnosis to hang off i always had hypnosis from the star and then changed the color a bit but then i looked like an xbox so i was like and then it's me but that wasn't this shouldn't be here we're still a bit too early because uh there's one more design that we didn't finish off this is Celtic me um i definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because i know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but i'm just a wee bit Scottish but i try and annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me so yeah i don't talk the way like you know my accent but i'm definitely getting this developed further the hair uh i like big hair so i'm probably not going to keep that hairstyle going on but i had like a little ears going on little squiddle ears um but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit reny reny thorns but if you look at that this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism and that that definitely going to develop this because uh it's good but it wasn't what i wanted the the default to be the default that's the word and so yeah i got a thingy my hair probably changed that oh i got that foreign to the Celtic design oh my god i completely forgot well there's my Celtic there's my next outfit boys uh but yeah very very squiddle very Celtic here um yeah uh oh i'm on the wrong one hold on but yes um i was presented with my squiddle eyes here and i actually have a bikini toggle obviously i'm not gonna do it right now because there's not the time for it but i have a pair lesson i have tape over me but you see like i technically have tape over my bits my little bits but if i go back a few um yeah i really like this Celtic warrior one because i can just i'll just talk about the battle of bannockburn all the time because why not but yeah you can definitely see me starting to come to life here uh like the shell of my hair i did have two bunches but they weren't as big like i have really big bunches um got like and then my eyes so my default eyes were going to be swirls but then i got my squiddle eyes because i'm a cuttlefish i'm a cephalopod yeah and then i finally came to there's me uh and then of course finished models okay i'll tell you some hidden things i'm gonna tell you some hidden things now this is this is what agencies kind of have to deal with behind the scenes azura was conceptualized black okay as a chocolate to be tuber if you will okay however i came to the horrible realization i can't put a white girl on azura oh my fucking god so azura in development was made racially ambiguous now i apologize for such terminology but that's just how it is that's how the facts are so she was made racially ambiguous if you look back in some of the promotional models and artworks you'll notice how pale she was that's because we had to make her ambiguous okay then azura came aboard and i was like chocolate fire right now like get on it so yes her finalize let's zoom in a little bit on the finalized model just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design so if you didn't know very quickly azura is your mummy quite literally lower wise she's your mama she is the goddess of fertility on planet earth you heard that right but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family she wanted to stay among the humans so she has retained some of her powers as a god okay so she has the power of flight believe it or not so she's gonna fly on my deck um i shouldn't have said that i'm sorry she also has healing properties uh with her milk yeah uh she can also be a giant ass as tall as a skyscraper these markings are made from when she founded civilization she has painted nails painted toes she has toe rings on her index toes a little veil over her thigh highs veil in the head all it just hips for days like definitely kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity like that's the kind of thing going on so yeah definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous um we had quite a lot of issues i ordered the girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized there was a lot of issues with artists not understanding the white is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters you know those characters that have the like the thing on the front of them we got a lot of artwork of that and i had to send back and be like no she's a goat so go go uh not door like that thanks um asical she's got scars which is a very unique element to her she also has a mouth fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang okay mouth fang she has scars um she has ripped clothing um she also has steel toe capped boots so you know she's safe for work 100% safe for work character she got them steel toe boots on okay um what other attributes she has a tail oh yeah uh azura has a tail and i say has a tail um me oh look at me so i if you didn't know i am wearing a yukata as a nod to japanese culture because without japanese culture truly as v-tubers we would not be here right now let's not pretend otherwise oh i forgot my cover up over my cross i am so sorry i forgot about that part of my design uh i literally have okay i'm sorry i'm sorry but anyway i'm in a yukata uh it's pearlescent so it shimmers as i move my shells on my head also are pearlescent i'm so sorry i'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola oops but yes i'm a new cat as a nod to japanese culture um for my next alternative i almost likely do a scottish Celtic type origin uh we can see um uh squid eyes yep i am a cuttlefish i have cuttlefish eyeballs uh when we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers just have a regular pupil i sleep i'm sorry but it's like one of the most simplistic things you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber boring out i'm sorry that's just my opinion uh it was one of the first notes that i gave to the concept artist do not give me a regular pupil i will perish uh again same with like fingernail designs etc i have french tip uh manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails mercy also has band aids on her fingers for example um these small things like add up definitely um yeah like i this is just my opinion but i think the there's nothing too if a design gets too complex on a vtuber this is just my opinion as well my opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole it's just me being talking at mass okay but um like if the designs get too complicated like i don't know i can't remember what the fucking uh things call but like you know those japanese idol skirts where there's like three different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on i'm like if you start getting two things you're getting a fan art no one's gonna recognize you because you're x y z like i'm sorry but you can't tell me that our designs look any and remotely similar to clutter that's the word cluttered if the designs are too cluttered please think of the fan art literally like i'd say mercy is the most she doesn't have a cover up we'll enjoy mercy from here mercy is probably the most complex design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and all that jazz yeah got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay so finally one model that control the full design of uh so if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more bottom you go that's not even a full english sentence um if you didn't know her thighs got chunked up in development uh we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic and you there's no point don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels and stockings if it ain't broke don't fix it you don't need to do anything special anything unique any of that stuff it's not broke it's the perfect design i don't don't even talk to me okay um so obviously my voice is going hold on let me take another drink um i do apologize and say that uh azura and she be you're actually gonna get an update soon to cover up their tappas um because i think youtube are not very happy i tried to run ads on them and youtube said no no no no and i was like but i have my boobs out as well youtube so this is just discrimination against big titty girls um i don't know what else is she be designed was just perfect honestly um a lot of people are like hey wait a second why is she wearing the bbsm gear if she's supposed to be the dominant one called like i don't know is my response to that like like go and just go and just like enjoy the design are you joking me you look at this design and that and you complain about it i'm not a guy okay i didn't have a willy but if i had a willy i know for a fact this is a 10 out of 10 design okay it's aesthetics aesthetic like that's it like like you're done didn't you didn't you chat about me about these designs emi i'm sorry i had to get you asleep when i was doing this one uh because i lost your full picture somehow emi is a door ball i love her design she has a rat skull on her necklace and these little gemstones too she has nails on her thingy she's only of a only one in v allure that has a tattoo is it a tattoo or is it a marking because she did something funny with a book who knows uh didn't really develop that part of the lore so you guys can pick it's up to you a womb tattoo it lights up no it doesn't let it's not a one tattoo don't you look my daughter she also has adorable bandaid and freckles on her knee nose and on her weenie she got a knee bump no no let me make it better oh wait oh wait you're layered above me hold on wait wait i need to make it better i'll need to kiss her knee better hold on let me cook oh no poo poo me emi no no kiss a bit oh my hair is too big right i need a bald toggle right now yeah it's all better she also has a knife and blood on her sock if you didn't know that was knife and blood on her sock yes um look in terms of like sacrifice and people and stuff emi's like a little quirky like that okay like whatever she needs to do to get back and you know get her brother back and for the papegas out there you viewing are her brother watching her from afar okay or the papegas don't worry i'm papega too so right where are we is that everything no merch merch ay let's go we got merch baby all the girls descriptions for their newest 2.0s will have merch updates if you didn't know all of the prophets go to the girls vealer do not take a cut of the merchandise we don't put our little fingies in the merchandise so rest assured if you buy something off uwu market for my baby's all that money goes to supporting them a lot of the girls are interested in moving out so they can up their streaming time they are trying very hard i'm trying to support them in any way i possibly can and hopefully from what you've seen not even to cover the cost so uh uwu market em will take their cut or whatever their you know earning is and then whatever is left over is profit wise goes straight to the talent it does not go into vealers like accounts or anything like that so please seriously rest assured like this isn't some sort of money grab agency when you support your talent you support your talent like the talent okay you don't have to think to yourself oh if i give a hundred dollars are they gonna get seven dollars of it no that's not how it works here it's not called you guys don't even take two percent no the hundred percent march to the girls like come on wouldn't wouldn't you be like in your head wouldn't you be upset if you learned like oh i supported the my oh shi desu with a hundred dollars and they only made like five bucks because of how much they joined like you know what i'm saying so i'm just coming out and saying it 80 20 cut and guess what if the girls stay on another year it goes to a 15 cut for veal or because the girls do all the work actually that's a really good point i might talk about that um oh this is like oh i need to do my merch hold on like uh it's a strong merch tentacles tentacle power tentacle power um i am actually gonna get a keychain because i'm so excited i'm getting all the girls keychains now i'm gonna say something and it might filter a few people i'm okay with handcam streams i'm gonna make an ASMR video of me like tapping on all the keychains of the girls i'm gonna like molest them with my hands and so you know if you are into the vtuber immersion where you don't see any body parts i'm very sorry i'm not the vtuber for you but there's definitely veal the lure girl out there for you just not me uh yeah i'll be i'm gonna touch all the girls okay yeah this is my keychain i really like that this came out so good i really like um okay i think we can do the q&a section now uh i am going to link my marshmallow if anyone would like to ask a question in private because i do understand some people are a bit adverse uh are a bit embarrassed uh so ask any agency related questions here agency that's did i even send oh it oh and my toggles are all coming on because i forgot to unbind them from my keyboard you know what you know what if it wasn't a scoff you wouldn't be enjoying yourself i will take oh my god i can hear myself twice right let me pin that message right let's see what are the plans for membership streams versus patreon uh let me take my toggle off first um so if you want to support the girl on patreon you will get access to four audios i would like to comment on that um obviously i had to do a lot of preparing in advance it's five dollars to support your girl on patreon for four audios what we are doing is called undercutting the market if you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out at a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other v a's not only do you get streams from the girls not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free but we have undercut the market on patreon as well so if you would like to test the content that they produce on patreon i highly recommend supporting them over me because i post free stuff all the time you don't all worry about me okay so support the girls first uh it's called undercutting the market isn't a very nice thing to do but it's uh it is what it is now i did have a few concerns about the type of audios please understand and direct any disappointments towards me because um i did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts and roleplays but please understand i had to make sure i'm not putting them in a position where they are overstressed or overworked when it comes to balancing streaming and uh the roleplays now i have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome to talk about their experience on stream behind the scenes you know as long as not an nda hence i'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh this is how it works okay well let's say five dollars forever yes um i uh believe um i have no plans to raise the price i think five dollars um is an acceptable price i'm i'm very aware of the economy the state that the bloody hangs in and in order to support your oh she deaths that might be in vealer the maximum price you will pay per month i believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars for the maximum price of again all content that your oh she deaths produces okay so i wanted it to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your majority is supporting your talent it's not getting hogged up to the agency okay um what will the main content on the youtube channels be streaming we are v-tubers we're just regular v-tubers that offer the goods on the side uh but um please do not think we are trying to speedrun banning our youtube channels um there was a few misconceptions out there that we may do outrageous things please understand uh i'm trying to help these girls become content creators of their dreams help them achieve things that they've always wanted to do hell even get them a play button so as much as jerking der pintus uh on youtube would be hilarious content for three seconds uh i really don't want them to get banned so they're just gonna be my lovely v-tubing girls um yes we need you on stage at a v-tubing convention this is insane marketing and pray insane marketing what revealing that azure's codename with stacey milker in is insane marketing no absolutely no absolutely no that's amazing awesome oh yeah be sucky by the way instead of veal or be sucky oh you've oh i've got you right there no i'm talking the behind okay the behind the scenes stuff is all fun to kind of be like so obviously you've just met the girls i have known them for a year if that makes sense like these concepts and everything's been going on for a year want some be sucky the behind the scenes content was cringe cringe but peak thank you fondle a bosom um can't wait to see be sucky at off guy oh we got all right no it's not okay before before i say the story we got uninvited to a convention so the girl we got invited to a convention uh we were getting a free pass and then the girls not safe for work twitters went live and then nine hours later we got an email saying oops our convention is full uh we're not interested anymore but nine hours prior they were like yeah we're still interested uh we can set up a booth we can give you free pass to staff members and we got uninvited when the girl's not safe for like twitters went live um so yeah we kind of spend on that but whatever convention i don't have good news that we are going to a convention in 2025 um it will be remote i don't think uh i can physically show up i don't think anyone's can for safety or whatever although i don't want to that's the stream for me i'll i'll talk about the idea in the stream sorry my voice is getting fried right now can you hear it oh um no so the the bizarre thing was on our website we said from the start we're a bit naughty naughty and then the email does on the website like we'd love all your talents to come to our agency to our agency to our convention i was like heck yeah and then we really and then we do the thing that we said we were going to do on the website and they were like oh sorry we're fully booked me i'm like okay yeah yeah that's some fun behind the scenes oh don't know the watch alongs oh my god if you're a vtuber that has a management that deals with sponsorships you got cucked out of so much money so wow oh my god thank you to everyone who accepted the watch alongs i'm gonna burp i am so we offer 12 000 us dollars for a three hour react and a watch along got told nah they were like nah we don't want to we don't want to put your audio and video on screen denied seven thousand us dollar offer no response six thousand us dollar offer no response three multiple three thousand us dollars to sit and react for three hours to cute girls debut and no response so for those of you who did do the watch alongs thank you from the bottom of my heart because one you weren't greedy shits and two you actually gave us the time of day i'm very thankful so yeah uh yeah v and u thumbs up yumi plus thumbs up a lot of vtuber agencies didn't even respond to emails thumbs down like not even a courtesy email there was a lot of theories about why we didn't get a response but i completely get it i'm just freaking me man by the way before you're like oh my god i hate vtuber agencies no it's not how it works um but um off kai clashed with a lot of things i think i offered like 10 000 oh that was it i think i offered a 8 000 to someone and never got response but uh i'm telling you right now if you have a manager that is a barrier between someone saying to you hey i want to sponsor you yeah you got because there was i think we sent 40 managements emails out with the offer inside and like no response crickets and the fact that the 12 k one was hilarious because the original offer was 10 k and then they were like actually this feature were just 4 000 per hour so i was like fine raise our offer to 12 k and then we told her like little thing we're like yeah just react to the girls have uh audio and and they were like we actually recommend not having the video and audio on so more people go into the streams and it was like mate we're paying you 12 000 us dollars and you're you're not gonna do like what we kindly ask which is be a react nd andy for three hours like it was crazy i cannot tell you what goes on behind the scenes absolutely crazy crazy crazy but anyway sorry i was thinking to drink a cola uh when oh all our models have a sleep are you ready for my sleep i do hypnosis when i sleep anyway uh would you kindly be a react nd yeah so anyway thumbs up to everyone who did end up doing a watch i apologize to anyone um who submitted themselves and your price was too high i didn't even bother to haggle if your price was too high because i was like mate some i don't want to be mean but some of you had very interesting price points someone was like what's your average viewership 20 views and they asked for uh i think it was 700 us dollars and i'm like that's that's not how it works but thank you for your submitting yourself i appreciate it uh but yeah and also i am so sorry if you applied under the veal or giggled thingy and you said you would be you would do it for free anyway i'm sorry but i didn't reply because you said you'd do it for free so to apologize um oh my god are you ever gonna do a generation of guys uh no smile this is a whammon agency only i apologize we don't do that here um no i'm absolutely not an against male veechibers and stuff but the only reasons you know strawney can strawnatize is because strawney strawney has knowledge and experience and stuff so i will apply it to the girls and yeah but i'm not a guy as much as i would like to have a weenus i'm not a guy so i can't help guys can't help guys succeed sorry however i can appeal to guys you know but sometimes i say with a broken voice like yeah i'm sure you like this voice on you um strawney maxon honestly hold on i'm taking another drink i've got a 2.0 to thingy as well i think what we'll do is i'm gonna redirect into sheeby and then i'll pull up my uh my 2.0 where i'm just yapping about myself uh right i'm go any more questions i can right stop typing fondle of booza right enough i'm trying to look for questions um when can i buy a sheeby buba mouse pad so the girls birthdays are when they're going to do donathons and um i actually might do an open stream where we can all discuss it together azura is the first donathon don't worry azura if you're watching i'm gonna help you through it she doesn't really know what she's doing but i'll help her um i'm going to focus on public rewards i'm gonna burp again oh my god sorry sorry sorry i'm talking a lot um i'm going to be focusing on jenna so the chat going not something i go through you see i fell off my chair sorry um what was i saying uh yes we can work on donathon goes together i will help the girls through it because uh somewhere a bit unsure they've never done one before hell i've never done a donathon before uh definitely gonna focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just me personally uh i'm actually not going for anyone don't care what the timing is but um some like i've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5000 us dollars between like the next goal and i'm like going to be serious can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks or like another like one of the biggest jumps i saw i think was 20 000 us dollars i'm like you can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no we're not doing that here so i'm i'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards and all that thing uh i don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy um i'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent we got so much feedback on that i this is terrible and i can't believe i have to say this but we're not an agency built on corporate greed full stop that's the sentence we don't have corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of buying the models and getting the girls set up for stream is very low it does not cost a lot of money to actually tell the girls to go stream like it doesn't cost me any money right now to click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it i know in this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner we're not an agency for corporate greed i hope you understand that the 8020 split for this year the next year if the girl signs on the 15 like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams i know it's ambitious i know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate but i hope no strongy yaw fucking burn the yaw no yaw for me because i don't buddy want one i want the success of my daughters go subscribe to them go give them a chance okay i'm not having none of this corporate greed shit in my house get the fuck out of here without anyway that's just my two cents but yes um the reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing i'm gonna get started again oh wait i already said that did i already say that the company has been seeded the company is not in debt to banks the company is not indebted to the company has been seeded which means the money was already there it was just funneled into this one okay okay oh what about legal staff are you ready for this fit we don't even have a hr department we just sexually harass each other for fun yippee we don't have that kind of business setup is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me and report me if i say anything not sorry i keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick that's true well actually everyone gets paid that was another thing that came up actually um how this is this is actually not vtuber related this is just human related and it's like hey how do you get your um your employees to like work and it was like uh actually pay them above minimum wage like if you go to the girls and go would you rather okay maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management i don't run the social accounts or anything like that one guys one guys one guys okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i wasn't saying anything more okay okay i call i call most of the shots i call most of the shots right what was i saying oh right yeah if you're i think one of the it was like the most dumbest post was like i can't get my employees to work hard type thing and it was like uh yeah because you're paying the minimum wage maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees which is where the 8020 split came in as well because i'm really sick of seeing vtuber agencies just being really greedy and i was like well i'm the opposite and i get to call the shots so yeah 8020 time for a black no not the freaking wipe no the black text on the white background oh my god i'm being graduated already oh it was a good run it was a good run see you next year when i start up the next vtuber uh it's 3d content plan bro we need we just go out of the gates you need to give the girl some some money if you want to get 3d models because uh we spend a lot of money just get into this stage okay i'm going to be honest you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content vsucky 2026 let's go vsucky so that's why you guys stream on youtube instead of twitch so twitch and youtube is like pick the lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube you can manage accounts on we regret to inform you that strani calls me oh that's another thing yeah uh we don't have uh what's the word i've already forgotten the word because we don't do it what is it called when management put the talent on leave like forced leave what the heck is that word i don't even know what that word is shadow ban yeah we don't suspension we don't do suspensions at vlr so rest assured uh when your vtuber is self-suspent yeah we don't do that here the girls don't get suspended uh have this terrible thing uh it's called uh treating people like adults uh and yeah we don't do suspensions uh if the girls do a naughty naughty guess what i'm not their mum i'm not here at spank their butt and be like you're a naughty naughty girl uh so yeah see yeah the girls do what they want it's crazy it's like if you treat people like adults then they kind of act like adults it's a wild concept really truly crazy unless they're new what if she be suspending from the ceiling what are your plans uh for youtube membership whatever the girls want to do for membership they have complete control of i have i am not dictating any talents content at all i do not dictate it i do not tell them what to stream i do not tell them what to do so what they would like to do in their membership streams are completely up to them i do not dictate we don't dictate in this house we treat people like adults why act like an adult when fondle abyssal show them that fondle abyssal it was a bad name it was one bad name okay they were all bad concept names but give me credit for freaking emi bezu come on man that's such a cute name we emi bezu emi bezu you see or should i say in a french accent um karambit right you know what it was a bad name i admit it it was a it was a bad name viszaki the viszaki talent fondle abyssal stabitha marx oh god don't don't put me in the kitchen i know i'm a woman but don't put me in the kitchen to cook again because that was awful milk or tea right right right you're done you're done right hold on i'm gonna refresh marshmallow to answer any questions uh shebe cotton bum live in 30 minutes i repeat shebe cotton bum live in 30 minutes uh just so you guys can hold out oh i've been yankum avant a yanko all right um can't answer that one sorry uh any unique chat rules or behavior guidance guidance for this agency uh just let the vtuber talk and uh let the talent talk and if she doesn't like what you're saying she'll say it but like obviously because the agency is a bit more obviously the chat can be a bit more uh yeah don't put me no shebe's gone live in 30 i'm gonna raid into her and then i'm gonna do my 2 2.0 but i don't have to be professional in it like after the stream oh well i'm not being very professional right now i'm a burping into your mouth but um after uh i'm just memeing as myself i don't have to do any more official stuff why are you rating my burp i'm terminated in 30 minutes you better not be get down would it be okay to create fan comics and post online absolutely the girls love any fan art coming through is beautiful wait a hundred duck sized ryan reynolds or a hundred ryan reynolds duck sized to keep what what how is that agency related at all you're just bamboozling me um i know this may be jumping the gun quite a bit but based on how you think have you already thought about gen 2 possibilities oh that's a good question um uh for the donathons of the girls one of the goals will be revealing a concept art of gen 2 i understand we've just debuted but if i'm happy to be as open as you guys are interested so you're welcome to ask any questions but yeah one of azure's donathons coming up and you guys can vote to reveal a design if you want up to you knock yourself out um someone asked if it's possible we would have a branch um a branch of veller that didn't require the not-safer work audio parts in the nicest way i the cut wouldn't be the same i just i couldn't i can't see it working out everything is based on what i have learned over the span of many years of what is occurring tan cute and funny i bet she okay i will tell the plan later you can tell it on your screen if you want to um will the patreon uploads be dictated by the talents no the content is given by management i actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls if you have any audios that you don't like please direct your grievances with me at this stage and then you can grieve at the manager that's coming in because i can't be our stealing all the scripts um yes the girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible to get them to succeed and that is just the truth of the matter i understand that some of the audios might not play into the thingy but i can't have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear be in every single audio please be realistic with me that's not gonna appeal to the masses and at the end of the day uh these girls are wanting to move out they're wanting to save money for their futures they want to pay off debts possibly this kind of thing so please please be realistic with us okay thank you i do appreciate them um is there a way to submit scripts for the talents possible plausible at this point in time i do not have a system in place like that it is plausible in the future you'll have to let things things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to um how do you call it we need to like settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day um all that kind of thing um how likely are what our off club how likely are off collabs based on location you mean like the girls meeting up i can make it happen i get taxed back on their travel expenses i can make that should happen if they want um you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects uh how about showing face no i don't really recommend it for him well uh so isn't male collabs you'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are uh wait ain't gonna be any males on this how do you pronounce violour well i'm scottish so the word like alluring you're alluring violour but violour but if you ever come from a different place yeah like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine the girls don't need permission for that uh you'll never see my face fill stop and i'm a feature yeah i'd say probably face stuff is like i'll never i'll never stop the talent but um um oh this is a good question have you started the agency on its own or did you get any sponsors or investors nope so when the agency was becoming an agency uh there were actually multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing the last thing i want is anyone meddling with my girls so absolutely not i rejected them all i have absolutely no interest in anyone else having anything to do ownership wise other than knowing that the girls are in my good hands okay uh there was also whispers of like oh you can sell this this business on if it gets big eh and let me stop you right there i trust myself with these girls i do not trust anyone else with these girls so thank you for your interest in your acquisition your investment however if you want to invest how about you invest in some merchandise official violour i'm just throwing away eh but yes don't worry eh why go with patreon over other locations it is safe to link patreon on youtube as long as everything is behind of paywall there is a large established market on patreon if there is ever anything to happen there are multiple websites that can be utilized in case please do not worry okay there are many reasons behind um developmental wise but i hope it's kind of here eh what are your plans for the future of violour um for me personally it is helping the girls achieve their dreams a lot of them were interested in 3d models um definitely do that there's a few that are interested in a few song covers i'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song but my goals are the girls goals um and if you mean my actual personal goals i'll talk about that in 2.0 but my goals are the girls goals yeah i want to help them be successful and be happy um yeah good life we'll give you the inspiration to make violour um corporate greed hate we hate corporate greed that's my sense and i keep seeing people say welcome back did you used to be a feature bar before this um i'm strawny cuttles let's leave it at that okay i'm strawny cuttles and i'm very happy to be here and if you're a fan of me you may like to refer to yourself as a reefling and it's a good life okay and thank you guys for being respectful and letting me let me be strawny much happy uh petition to name your Celtic alternative your scotl fish out that's really creative right sorry i should have should have read that should have read that as a as a strawny and let's see if there's any questions um i think that's all the agency questions unless i'm refreshed and there's like a billion more oh that's a lot more questions that just came through if an agency um we've got 20 minute timer for shibir shibidi toilet sorry i'm sorry that if emmy didn't say that if emmy didn't say shibidi toilet i would never have said that myself i'm so sorry it was emmy blame emmy it was emmy she started it she started it oh my god i never even told you the funniest thing so uh we had like we were together for two months before we debuted and the weirdest thing ever was like uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other i was like right let's go play among us together for the first time uh so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us so i'm going to recalibrate my little hold on my mic okay there we go my mic's a bit better than my mic um yeah we had to like do four something like for your game let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around each other yeah we played like whiplash um this game where like you can i can't remember the title of it but it was like really good it was fun um sorry i just had a little jackbox that was it we played like jackbox together and stuff um are the girls free to collab whoever they want yes asterix as long as i've no got a willy i don't care who they collab with they can go nuts for all i care why are the girls so cute is that part of your hypnosis have i trained you trained you to like the girl uh how open to marriage suggestions are you from friends like design ideas and such go for it but the you know this this agency's kind of i'm gonna i need to word my words carefully word my words carefully i am i need to word myself carefully but most like i want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback whereas like i want to say like hey we've literally just started of course we're gonna fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong but like we're open to suggestions like oh i think this is a good idea i think that's a good idea you know like i want to say that so um someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account oh fucking course did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep a very very very hard concept for some people to comprehend but yeah the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept i know truly mindfongling who came up with mersey's design everything is by squishy girl the website is getting an update it's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot of information that's going to be in it so give us a a hot second to produce it um supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio can they apply for a video editor yeah uh clippers editors um i want to try and do a clipping program where you get money very like idle i'm not even gonna like say otherwise idle do a clipping program where if you clip the girl every thousand views you get a dollar type thing i'm quite interested in that style because you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side and obviously you don't need a wee bit of money to come back in before i can do something like that but i really do like the concept of it very good wellness very good wellness um i like it very much uh sorry i'm just i'm just reading some of the questions i can't say out loud as i read it because it's you know um sorry i'm reading i'm reading just in case uh hold on hold on i'm reading i'm reading i'm reading you guys are just saying inappropriate stuff about sorry the the the the the comments are like i would do this to ac i would do this to me and i'm like but that's not a question about the agency how long did it take to get the hired selection progress process oh my god oh my god you've just activated my neurons so the the application pool was open for a month and then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or something you're gonna get an email and someone was like oh my god there's no way they're gonna go through all those applications in two days no you idiot you numpty of course we were going through the applications as they came in you genuinely thought that when they close is when agencies go through them come on rub those brain cells together you genuinely think that agencies close applications and then start going through them no add a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls goodness gravy goodness gravy some of the comments come on me i'm no very smart myself but the moon man you're taking my pass are there rules surrounding clipping the talents absolutely not go nuts knock yourself out thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping um will you ever hire programmers sadly i don't need a programmer let's just fix a battle royale tier system okay right i can i can talk about this so as the applications came in i found a girl that was suitable i would pick out the model for you and there was first place second place third place but the choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like emmy was emmy i see was i see you know like the choices were so obvious that it was like do the interview and you're in type thing i have a no bullshit apology apology i have a no bullshit approach to interviews so and the girls can talk about it if they so desire i basically went into the interview with them and i said eh right off the bat i said hey we want you as a talent you absolutely do not have to impress me in this call okay you don't have to impress me i want you already here's a list of stuff that you need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on okay did you have a lot of candidates for fondlet no a zero was the only like there was no one else for a zero if zero rejected that position i was up shit creek i'm not even fucking saying nothing yeah angry scottish is more um but yeah uh within like 24 hours people were emailed and that was it are you going are your models gonna stick sorry are you and the models stick to these avatar eh you mean like new outfits and stuff no the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever or 3d models perfectly fine with me um eh are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a boss funny you mentioned that i told them in the interview don't call me boss don't refer to me as your boss do not think of me as your boss i am not your boss don't ever place me above you mentally in your head i do not want that i am the creative director wink wink so they do not call me boss they do not call me superior yes she be called me boss mam and i was like no please don't ever like do that because i don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god i can't approach her i can't talk to her no i don't want that i don't like them i don't want anyone to ever think that i am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink i said it i said it um let me check let me have a refresh yeah um also at the end of the day i'm not really a boss anymore like now that debuts are over everything's like up to the girl the only boss thing really is like hey have you recorded that audio for patreon yes or no and then that's it there's nothing else to it um so yeah leader yeah uh basically just tell them like hey i did this and i'll show them stats and stuff and i'm like this is what i think you should do but they don't really ask for advice because uh i'll mention i'll repeat this again all the girls have more streaming experience than me so it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no i have full faith in these girls uh they are absolutely fantastic lovely everything i have absolutely no problems i have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all so yeah she goes live in eight minutes hold on let me get confirmation that i raid into shibis 2.0 um for those of you who would like to part ways and join shibis 2.0 please absolutely do uh i will also be doing my 2.0 at the exact same time but i am in uh i highly recommend you do shibers sheasters um because she is nothing but an angel and uh i would love you to support my daughters over me this is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth what's my 2.0 i'm i'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff but this is kind of more agency focus yeah um someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2 okay we debuted yesterday unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different um the we were a year away from my focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing where we go you know you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines give them a chance to like you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz yeah let's everyone cook first but it's it's a year away um that we're okay any questions on youtube because marshmallow drying up like my voice box honestly whose voice is it my voice um you've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls but how exactly do you recoup your investment me i keep 100 percent of what i mean uh yeah don't don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff but like this this is a big this is again not for greed this is for me to do my thing and i have five lovely girls who i also recommend and i want them to be able to do their thing and yeah let them cook man don't don't worry about the money okay don't worry about the money some things in life are more important than greed and i don't mean you're implying that i'm greedy because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but let's just have a good time like i'm playing assassins creed tomorrow i'm going to tell you about that some of the developmental lore of that game i'm going to tell you a little tip bits about glitches that occur in that game i'm just here for a good time okay uh when was velar started uh it's been a one year development uh actually i'm gonna give you the name of the song the girls were uh i was the girls were consented but oh god this is the song sorry i just completely went off in my head this is the song the girls uh were birthed to one year ago this song so open that up in a oh should be started is we should restart it should be started okay okay are there any games that can't be played uh for legal reason no because we're not a japanese based company we don't have to worry about that copyright shit that other agents she's really fucking tied to it's not a rick roll yeah so that's the song that the girls were made to so you can give a listen to uh i am going to end the stream because she be caught in bum is streaming and she's going to talk about 2.0 i'm gonna boot back up my 2.0 where i'm just gonna ramble literally about everything um so thank you all so much for the interest in the agency please do support sheebie and don't be afraid to like and subscribble subscribble i know i'm not a squid but skub squibble do you know what i'm trying to say how would you spell that skub squibble please skub
