1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in this

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No time to wait for my days, of all the time

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right, this is British lore

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh wait, hold on

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I have no idea what it's like even it says I'm online yet

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No it doesn't, oh this is the thing

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Whenever I look back on a board, I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But when I look back on the board, and all that, it's all fine

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All fine

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The fine line

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right, where are we? Nope

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Nope, not yet

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Not playing the game yet

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Coming at you with a fried voice

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you, Dule Lover for becoming a member in case that did not register

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She loves it, she loves it

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I had to do some bit of background work

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's the background work you ask?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I put Shabby Cotton Bum's memberships live

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But she might not say your name during the stream though

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Shabby Cotton Bum, maybe I should be a bit bigger

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Cause I'm kinda talking

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's shocking

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hold on, I'll actually go weave because BOOM!

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon little reeflings

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is on the agendination for week three?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, let me talk you through it, okay?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So we're starting off strong with the ASMR stream

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
At the usual time

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute pause

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch along

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Which is none other than the first Transformers movie

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
With Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are playing Zelda Minish Cap

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Because for member stream, we are going to be doing the forbidden tear list

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ooooooh, not the way you want the big yin

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I get to answer it honestly this time

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then the rest of the day on Wednesday

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It is the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know it's shocking, hold on, wait

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Chat, you'd let me stretch

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why the frick frack diddley-dack?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Does it not let me stretch chat?

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh my god, let me stretch you

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why is it locked?

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brev, brev

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm trying to explain

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What am I doing? Anyway

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh my god

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Eh, you be next

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you for coming on member

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh my god, is that the mascot for um

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WeleuVeton Inc

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm so sorry

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Chat, her name evades me right now

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
From hololiveleuVeton Inc

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh my goodness

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Anyway

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Um, we are going to do old school runescape on Thursday

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, and now my chat's broken completely

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, thanks OBS

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, really, thank you

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Please don't ever cook again

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, it finally worked

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Inna, yes Inna

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Chat, yeah

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, it's fixed, I can actually read chat now

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Inna, yes Inna

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In my hole, thank you

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Um, let's see

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So then we're going to do old school runescape

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
However, check it

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with WeleuVeton Inc

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And guess what?

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's with Mercy

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I should have picked any kind of yandere

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I got Mercy

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And we're going to be playing Goose Game

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We're going to be playing it at her time

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we're only going to do a little bit of runescape

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Um, so a couple hours of runescape and blabbing away

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because I want to give Mercy my all

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She's not ready for the rotism, your honor

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Memberships are showing up to me on mobile

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you, Omar and Simpson

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It still doesn't display properly

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Even though I have the full chat up

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because we are redirecting into her

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
In a self-made cosplay of sheebie

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yep, that's a full sentence

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let me check them out by discovering the alternative twiers

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you don't know what the alternative twiers are

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Feel free to check out who the accounts are following

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wanted to make the collab super easy for her

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I am going to have to rest and snort

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Some...

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Shouldn't have said that

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to be taking lots of cola

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to start lagging a little bit there

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ain't I meant for you either

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't have to give me money to tell me this

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You just realise that, Omar

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You don't have to give me money to type things in chat

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Scotland forever

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, erm...

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Count up for the life of me, find it

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I bought a new heart rate monitor

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because my other one was bust

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Erm, and it's already gone

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I think I'm about to purchase the third one

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Lucky me

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Erm, I'll probably...

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I send a cure package to the girls

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like, for Donothons, me just looking in my...

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Others have cute mascots

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have a cute Scottish girl

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Did Brian talk?

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Did Brian say...

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, did Brian say anything there?

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh shit, I didn't see that

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Aren't...

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Others have cute mascots

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We have a cute Scottish...

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Girl

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you for the five iron reaper

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I appreciate it

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, I never heard that

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sorry, I have my headset muted

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because I have the freaking game sound in the background

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's so loud

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wait, what?

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, wait

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We're playing Nero

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Erm

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you didn't see

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
On a game called Don't Starve

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's exactly AC's lore

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because she had to hunt for her food

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, rather curious

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Rather curious, aren't they?

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Erm

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What else? Elden...

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, Elden Ring the DLC

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Elden Ring the DLC, okay?

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It launches on Friday

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm like 99% sure

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Erm

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We have a lot of areas to clear anyway

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And I am under the impression

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We have to perish the enemy

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's at the top of this elevator

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In that graveyard

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Unironically, Ryan Goslin was the one

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That vanquished him

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because I couldn't do it, I kept getting attacked

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So the refland's on a freaking debuff

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like a severe debuff

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Whilst I was running away from this boss

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All came flying in

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I'm like 99% sure that was a Ryan Goslin kill that one

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Erm

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I do say shortcaller

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now, I do have a shortcaller

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're gonna test it out at the start of stream

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If I can handle it

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will permit my reflings to zap me

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Every time I cause us to die

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Erm, I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Whenever we get near an enemy

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I need you to open your eyeballs for me, okay?

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because members' ASMR stream starts one hour earlier

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Than my usual start time

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The reason for that is

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Imi, Azura, Mercy, Strawny

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are doing a four man uno collab

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that I can't get away from Mercy this week

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm already entangled in her snare, you know

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Erm, and then

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So that's two streams that day

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Erm

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then and then and then

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sorry, I did apologize for your head

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I didn't get a good sleep last night

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Again

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Erm

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm getting very tired

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Actually, I'll tell you something really bad

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I had to take sleep medicine the other day

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But whenever I take sleep medicine

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have problems going number two, okay?

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then I hurt my butt going number two

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So if there's anyone that wants to help kiss it better

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then Elden Ring part two

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We again will have a full endurance on that

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am literally weaving so much content in between this as well

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because I'm also starting up my thank you series

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
My one ASMR video pair 1000 views thank you series

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I am absolutely delighted

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And exhausted to learn that I

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My scheduled uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've already reached 7000

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Which means the debt of six is still to be paid

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Erm

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm very thankful

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But oh man I'm tired

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Erm

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
After this stream today

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm actually going to record three

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Collab ASMR's from my side

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because three girls have given me their side

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Erm

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I need to edit that

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Unending ASMR's

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Back to back to back

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Erm

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's so many replays now

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I know I'm busy

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
My mum is very busy

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Erm

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you didn't know

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
AC's meme ASMR has gone live

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is sniffing ASMR

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you like that trigger

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mercy's ASMR has like

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I got a fucking cat here in my mouth all the time

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Erm

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah you really do get used to it when you get cats honestly

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Erm

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're just like oh that's just another part of the video

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Erm

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mercy has released Yandere ASMR

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Erm

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Please if you absolutely despise the meme ASMR's

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I got them to create

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well guess who fucking created them for them

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Me

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So if you hate them

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't be like

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Mmm

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This video is stinky

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Be like

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mmm

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Strongly stinky

290
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because she came up with a concept

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay

292
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So don't

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you didn't like it don't worry

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not like it's the only ASMR video

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They're ever going to produce for free on YouTube

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like fucking relax

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
For one

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Erm

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Haha

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm sorry

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm literally fighting imaginary people

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
One person has said that at all

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I know for a fact no one has said that

304
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I'm like already swinging on behalf of the girls

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like don't say nothing about my girls okay

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Erm

307
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But yes

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mercy's ASMR actually I was influenced by

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I had already created this over a year ago

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I think this was before the creator of Yandere Sim

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Got outed for all of his

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Erm

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm 32

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have so much power over me tweets

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Or whatever the tweet was

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't remember the ins and outs of it

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Erm

320
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you didn't know

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In Yandere Sim

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's a mechanic

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Where in order to lower your craziness levels

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You need to laugh

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You need to laugh very loud and very startling

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And if anyone is around you while you laugh

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It alerts them

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I was like

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How did I do that for Mercy

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I did an intro

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Setting up the plot

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She comes and finds you type thing

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then she laughs like a maniac

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Ear to ear in the mic

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I absolutely love it

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I absolutely love it

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I think that's cause I knew about

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I've never actually played Yandere Sim but

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Preemptive defense is a good strategy

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Literally just smashing people's skulls in

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No one has said a thing to me

346
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But the rage has already taken over

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Erm

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The only discord group with speedrun pan records

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Honestly

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Also

351
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh did Emi release it?

353
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So

354
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I went the complete meme route for Emi

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But Emi isn't quite with me

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
On the same page

357
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Which is fine

358
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's completely fine

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She has complete control

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So I was like

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Upload it if you want it

362
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh wait she did upload it

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay

365
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So she kept the thumbnail the same

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I wasn't gonna like it

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay okay okay

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So she's called the video

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Alleyway Tingle Dealer

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR

373
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's good title

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I like that title

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
My title was

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
VTuber Sells you

377
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Tingles in an alleyway

378
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think or something like that

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We did have to

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The artist at the time drew AC

381
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Emi

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Sorry they're twins

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Drew Emi

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Not Pattan

385
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So we had to put a little

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Sutton Sutton over

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I loved the 30 minute Japanese one

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm glad you enjoyed it

389
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That is basically

390
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What unscripted

391
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ASMR

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Turns it into

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If I don't have a script

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will yap my head off

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So Emi also has her meme ASMR

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now that she's monetised

397
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Which is fan-tiddly-astic

398
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The next

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Meme ASMR is Shibi

400
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission

401
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
To do it once

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Once your monetisation stream

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I know professional streamer by the way

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Once your monetisation stream

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Has finished

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
My dear Shibi

407
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Would you like me to upload and

408
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Pub

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is it publish?

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No

411
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Like upload and

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Put live your

413
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Meme ASMR

414
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You guys are gonna freaking love the plot

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I came up with Shibi

416
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Shibi's plot was so unique

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I had to go away and record folly sounds

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Which is rare for me

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because I have a massive bank

420
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Of sounds that I can

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come from

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It was great

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You were loving the ear mass

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh you like the 7 girl collab

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh yeah

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You like 7 of us being together

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
7 whole neckos

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well if you're excited for that

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's another

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Next week

431
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There's another 7 man collab

432
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ohhh

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm gonna have to edit it

434
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The work never ends

435
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know what you're saying

436
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Anonymous

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I loved ASMR you did with DTW

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And the rest

439
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh thank you

440
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was so hard to put together

441
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know she's such a busy person

442
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was so excited to see this one

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh I'm glad you like it

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you for the tip Anonymous

445
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes

446
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
7 man

447
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No 7 person collab

448
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
With another girl

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
VA

450
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Surprise surprise

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You've already guessed what channel it's going on

452
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
There's no way in heck you don't know who it is

453
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And then after that

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
For next week

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's another 7 man collab

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I need to put together

457
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The work never ends

458
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But the work is good

459
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's like that good kind of stress

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wait I'm gonna need confirmation

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Right think of one VA

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That I talk to all the time

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And burst in this chat all the time

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Thank

466
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's who's next

467
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The next one after that

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I actually did a watch along of us

470
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Because I have the artwork so I can edit it

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But then the fourth

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
7 man collab

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm waiting on this animator

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
To animate the artwork

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And the worst part is

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well actually

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's not the worst part

479
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The animator that I usually use

480
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are like

481
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh I've just had a wedding

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I'm like

483
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh my god congrats

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Meanwhile

485
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
My stuff has been

486
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Unedited

487
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And the deadline has slipped

488
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Almost 2 weeks now

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I'm like congrats on your wedding

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But your honeymoon phase is over

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Please get off of her

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And let her have some rest

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay

494
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And do my work

495
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Thanks I paid you for this

496
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So can you just do it

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That'd be great

498
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because

499
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm currently fricking

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Waiting on

501
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh mama yunya

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's so proud

503
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No not mimosa

504
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No I do have a collab with mimosa

505
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But that's a one on one collab

506
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm jumping on her

507
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I said mimosa you're mine

508
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's actually another member

509
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Of yunmi plus as a 3dio

510
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I need to write the plot

511
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And send it to her

512
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And another piece of work

513
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That I have to do

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
By the way

515
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And shibi has

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Finally got a new short

517
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Pro shibi only has two shorts

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
She finally has a third

519
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And all of harem are

520
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000

Because strony gave shibi

529
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The script of praise

530
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So the reason why you hear shibi

531
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Praise you

532
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In that short

533
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is because of strony

534
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So all of harem

I'm looking after you

540
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not only did I get her

542
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000

547
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Sin star

548
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000

Collab

554

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
My dad

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is coming home

557
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000

My dad's coming home

561
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Our father-in-law

562
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh do you want to meet

563
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Your dad-in-law

564
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm not getting him

565
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
To come on stream

566
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Because he'll be like

567
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hi reeflings

568
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Hi full legal name

569
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000

570
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So he's not coming on stream

571
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No having it

572
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But yes

573
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My dad

574
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Coming home

576
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For two weeks

577
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh my god

578
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't believe

579
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Her dad is coming home

580
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes all of her dad

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Collectively is coming home

582
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I thought

583
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
About a few stream

584
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000

I don't know if maybe

595
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That would be funny

596
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or I don't know

597
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If people wouldn't like that

598
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm going to make a video

599
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000

Their name actually didn't change

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Just the spelling

670
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000

00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm like oh

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
One of my meme videos

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Like I got a meme video

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That went a bit viral

682
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And he was like

683
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's for me

687
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's for me

688
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Not for you

689
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Can you tell him that

690
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
A yeah video of me

691
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
ASMR whispering into a

692
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Five hundred dollar microphone

693
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Was because I was begging

694
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
To hold a pee pee

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Can't tell him that

696
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Nah my dad knows

697
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He doesn't know the channel

698
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But he knows like

699
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Because what pays bills

700
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's still pretend

701
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's still pretend

702
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I wonder if my dad sounds like me

703
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh his accent's even stronger than mine

704
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Way stronger

705
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
One day we'll get to call

706
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We'll get him to call his Radish sons

707
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Do you want me to get him to say that?

708
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I could do that usually

709
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wait wait wait

710
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Does your dad talk in Scots too?

711
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We are so bad

712
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh yeah no my dad's like

713
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Got a harsher accent than me

714
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So my mum

715
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
My mum told me not to speak in slang

716
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But my dad does

717
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Cause he is a

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I mean he just speaks slang

719
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But my mum doesn't

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I don't really do it

721
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Cause is your dad single?

722
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No

723
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh my god

724
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Are you trying to be my mum?

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What is going on here?

726
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Hold on a minute

727
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hold on a minute

728
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Refling

729
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What's going on?

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000

Wait let me read that

734
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Thank you anonymous for the tip

735
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
anonymous said

736
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Introducing a refling to her dad

737
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
As her boyfriend

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And he's sitting there all

739
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Staring at that and it does

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Not to hurt his co-

741
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No!

742
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
My dad's like

743
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Super nice and approachable

744
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You don't need to be scared of my dad

745
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Honestly

746
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like he'd be like

747
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh are you looking after Shawnee?

748
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And then you go

749
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah

750
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
In your voice

751
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Cause you're like

752
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Scared of him

753
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then he'll go

754
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Is she happy?

755
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then you go

756
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I think so

757
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
In your wee voice

758
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Cause you're trembling

759
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then after that

760
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh good that's it

761
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
My dad

762
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Me and my dad

763
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Are on the same page where

764
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
As long as my dad's happy

765
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm happy

766
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
As long as I'm happy

767
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
My dad's happy

768
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's nice

769
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's super

770
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Super duper simple

771
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Like that

772
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's just

773
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Nice

774
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's nice to do that

775
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Reflings are happy

776
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm happy

777
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If

778
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm happy

779
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Reflings are

780
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Wait did I say the same thing today?

781
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm happy

782
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Refling happy

783
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Refling happy

784
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm happy

785
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes like this

786
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think she's happy

787
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
She cusses me out regularly

788
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
With a smile on her face

789
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh that's terrible

790
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What is the Scottish shotgun

791
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And how's it different?

792
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't know

793
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There's haggies in your face

794
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Instead of pellets

795
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Papastrone looks like

796
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The dad from How to Train Your Dragon

797
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Wait hold on

798
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Let me

799
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
How to train your dragon

800
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That exhibition

801
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No

802
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
My dad doesn't

803
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
No he doesn't have beard

804
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No beard

805
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
All the way

806
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He doesn't have beard

807
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But he has

808
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Not stubble

809
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
All the way

810
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He

811
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Want to

812
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Actually I'll tell you

813
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is really funny

814
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
One time

815
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
My dad tried to grow a beard

816
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And I was mortified

817
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I was like

818
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh

819
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
No

820
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's my mom's single

821
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
No

822
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You're teasing me

823
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Refling

824
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
How do you think your dad would respond

825
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If

826
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Refling said

827
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Your daughter calls me daddy too

828
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Would I call you daddy?

829
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I wouldn't think I'd call you daddy

830
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Like

831
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In my accent

832
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Daddy's pretty

833
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Jarring and cringe

834
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Like

835
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh yeah I like that daddy

836
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Mmm yeah

837
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Like no

838
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Do you want me to tell him

839
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you want me to tell him

840
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Like

841
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh dad by the way

842
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The refling's call me mummy

843
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't think he's going to get it

844
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If I explain it

845
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh my god

846
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't think he's going to get it

847
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think he's going to be like

848
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What

849
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh I don't think he's going to

850
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Confend that

851
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That would be amazing

852
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh yeah daddy

853
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Give me your space

854
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hey sausage

855
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Literally no

856
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It doesn't work

857
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000

Oh you been like

859
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think every VTuber calls you mummy now

860
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I have to admit

861
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It is an absolute cheat code

862
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Code

863
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If any VTuber is like

864
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You know

865
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Code name mummy

866
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000

867
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh I'm cool with you

868
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hot a f

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Rande

883
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000

892
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't know how

893
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Three of us has ended up doing feet

894
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Related celebrations

895
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Which is absolutely hilarious for monetization

896
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That three of us has ended up showing our feetsies

897
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That is hilarious

898
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I will not be taking any statements

899
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Because oh my god

Wait

906
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Scottish VTuber that tries

907
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Way too hard to prove that they're like a Scottish VTuber

908
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We don't need to know if your mum is single

909
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Anonymous

910
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We don't need to know if your mum is single

911
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We have the only mum

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A little behind the scenes fact

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
At Ville or headquarters

920
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000

Not all of them

928
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000

You supported so much at the start

937
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You broke the code

938
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And now some funds are on hold

939
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because there's so much money coming in

940
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It was actually a snowberry that did it

941
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So shout out to the snowberries

942
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You broke

Imagine thinking

956
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That listening to Strowney

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Saying mommy and daddy and I think

958
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Accent isn't hot

959
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That would drive

960
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That would be crazy

961
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I get real close to you

962
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm looking in your eyes

963
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Is that what you should be saying?

964
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh my god

965
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Do you know those convention

966
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Signs

967
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Those VTuber conventions

968
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Where they like hold a sign

969
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And it's like five dollars to get stood on

970
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Bro

971
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
50 cent for me to smash

972
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
My arse on your face

973
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How about that

974
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
One cent for me

975
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
A whispered daddy in your ear

976
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
How about that?

977
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay

978
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We're gonna do a thing

979
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
At this VTuber convention

980
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Called undercutting the market

981
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You offer your goods

982
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
At an unbelievably discounted price

983
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now I know undercutting

984
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Normally implies

985
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There's going to be a raise later on

986
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We ain't raising none of the prices

987
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The prices you see

988
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Are the prices you get

989
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Pills out 20 bucks

990
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Take all my change

991
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's a steal

992
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Shawnee really undercutting the market now

993
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm like 99% sure

994
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I saw a cosplayer meme

995
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And she genuinely had a sign

996
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That said like five dollars

997
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
To be stepped on

998
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And she was like

999
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I made like four hundred dollars

1000
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
In a day type thing

1001
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm like

1002
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So many different

1003
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So I guess for that much

1004
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We are getting married

1005
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
With 50 children

1006
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Michi chunky bird

1007
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you for the

1008
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Is that Poland?

1009
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't know what that is

1010
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Pozka?

1011
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So I guess for that much

1012
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We're getting married

1013
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
With 50 children

1014
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Nah, no children

1015
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Did you see Azura's alternative artwork?

1016
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
She did break all

1017
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What?

1018
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Azura did what?

1019
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't know she was down like that

1020
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I didn't know she was down like that

1021
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I was like

1022
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
She drew that of her own

1023
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
She drew that

1024
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yes

1025
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Azura's an artist

1026
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If you didn't know

1027
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Literally all the girls have some sort of

1028
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Drawing

1029
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
History

1030
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Background

1031
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
KFP Spidey

1032
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Again with the five gifted

1033
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your

1034
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Face

1035
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
In your face

1036
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh my god we need to play Kung Fu Kiosk again

1037
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But I'm so bad at it

1038
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Tornado

1039
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Your doodles are so cute

1040
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh no

1041
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know how to draw

1042
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Actually I could show

1043
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh I should have shown it on the

1044
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Handcam stream

1045
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I tried to learn to draw

1046
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And I was consistent for like

1047
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Five days before work

1048
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Just got far too much

1049
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I couldn't keep up with work naturally

1050
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And the only thing

1051
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I was wanting to draw

1052
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Was the girls

1053
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So I have like

1054
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Terrible pictures of me drawing the girls

1055
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Like way back a couple of months ago now

1056
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Sadly life got in the way

1057
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But I actually do genuinely think

1058
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If I ever hit

1059
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The Jenga with the five gifted

1060
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Memberships

1061
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Thank you

1062
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Congrats to those who caught it with your

1063
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Face

1064
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
In your face

1065
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Sorry

1066
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm really

1067
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If you didn't know

1068
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
There's a character called

1069
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Candy Roll in Kung Fu Kiosk

1070
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Her and Sweet and Sour

1071
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Were my favourite characters

1072
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And when my voice gets squeaky

1073
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Internally

1074
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Not externally

1075
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But internally

1076
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because of the

1077
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You hear yourself differently

1078
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
From out loud

1079
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I sound like

1080
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Candy Roll

1081
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
When I get really high pitched

1082
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And

1083
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I know all her voice lines

1084
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Was it

1085
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Echo Lillia

1086
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
When you repeat

1087
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What you've heard

1088
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And she's like

1089
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Kits my candy ass

1090
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I just love her

1091
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I love her so much

1092
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
She's just like

1093
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Ten out of ten characters

1094
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh my god

1095
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Gentoo Roller Skates confirmed

1096
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Sorry

1097
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Some sort of

1098
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Girl on Roller Skates

1099
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't care

1100
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Bimbo!

1101
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh my god

1102
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
We don't have a Bimbo

1103
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Wait

1104
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What would the Bimbo be?

1105
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Maybe like a Bimbo

1106
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That lures your expectations

1107
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And then does something

1108
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Zenil Warrior

1109
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Thank you for coming

1110
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
A member

1111
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Roller Skates

1112
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
A Bimbo maid

1113
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I would need something

1114
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
A bit more than a maid

1115
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I feel like a maid is very default

1116
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't know

1117
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A maid

1118
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
A Bimbo maid

1119
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That is quite nice though

1120
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Bimbo maid is cute

1121
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Because then she can

1122
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Spill stuff on you

1123
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
All the time

1124
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And then before you know

1125
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Bimbo

1126
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Possum

1127
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000

1128

1129
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Remove this man's testicles

1130
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Possum

Possum

1137
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
As in the thing in the

1138
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That goes

1139
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Anonymous

1140
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm so conflicted about who you're

1141
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Who is my favourite in violour

1142
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Please hypnotise me

1143
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Please hypnotise me to stay loyal to you mummy

1144
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Keep that thought in mind

1145
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Not for what you think

1146
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Because next week

1147
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
We may or may not be rating

1148
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
A very unique audio roleplay

1149
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Paul Lott

1150
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That involves me

1151
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And the girls

1152
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Maybe that kind of script

1153
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Perhaps sea queen script

1154
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Might solidify

1155
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Who your choice is at the allure

1156
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I am not a jealous mother

1157
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I assure you

1158
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I wish to share all

1159
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
All the goodness

1160
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
All the spice

1161
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I have clear ideas

1162
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
A possum are kind of cute

1163
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
A masochistic maid is

1164
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Metta

1165
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But it never goes out of the meta

1166
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I was debating on when to get membership

1167
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And then I decided

1168
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If it's not on the day

1169
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Strongly offers

1170
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
50 cent butt smashes

1171
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
What day will it be

1172
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Honestly do you think conventions

1173
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Would let us get away with that

1174
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask

1175
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And I'll have a little wig

1176
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So my hair is the same

1177
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But like

1178
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I feel like no one can stop

1179
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're like

1180
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh what you gonna do

1181
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
A reefling lies down on the floor

1182
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I quickly butt bash him

1183
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And then get back up again

1184
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Like is that kickable to get out of the corner

1185
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I feel like that's like such a baby thing

1186
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Like oops

1187
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I tripped and landed on my reeflings face

1188
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Oh no

1189
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Nah that'd be amazing

1190
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Depends I guess

1191
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because it'd be really weird

1192
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Messaging the convention and being like

1193
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Hey

1194
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Am I allowed to

1195
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Fall on the faces

1196
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Of reeflings

1197
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Question mark

1198
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Am I allowed

1199
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Well if they allowed stepping

1200
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Because then you can start to argue

1201
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Like oh but you allow other

1202
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
VTubers to step on them

1203
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Did you know that is also

1204
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Bexley bestifying

1205
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So why is it

1206
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
When I trip and fall on a reeflings face

1207
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
With my

1208
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
My arms

1209
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's unacceptable

1210
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But if I step on them

1211
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's acceptable

1212
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh my god convention

1213
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Talk about having double sided

1214
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Is it because I'm Scottish

1215
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Convention

1216
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You can't do that

1217
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You can't show that you

1218
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Believe in the British Isles

1219
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Sorry the

1220
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You need Kingdom over Scotland

1221
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh my god convention

1222
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You don't believe in the independence of

1223
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Scotland

1224
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Convention

1225
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You can't say that stuff at

1226
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Low

1227
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah anyway

1228
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah albalfobia

1229
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh my god exactly

1230
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Sends like asking for trouble

1231
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Well good thing my name's

1232
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Johnny because we're making it double

1233
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's right me I was

1234
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The name

1235
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Sorry I was kidding

1236
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Going on a

1237
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Team rockets

1238
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Blasting off again

1239
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Oh wait that's not what they sound like

1240
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That sounded like cream

1241
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Please be careful not to fall

1242
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
What

1243
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
What's

1244
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
As

1245
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Team rockets blasting off again

1246
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's kinda there it's kinda there

1247
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah yeah

1248
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Convention what do you mean

1249
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So there's a possibility

1250
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
In a certain timeline that

1251
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I may or may not

1252
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Be able to make it to our convention

1253
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I would love to do that

1254
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But the only problem is

1255
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We have a bomb

1256
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I'd actually need to hire

1257
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A bodyguard

1258
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Two bodyguards or one bodyguard

1259
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Bro I'm gonna be so embarrassed

1260
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Messaging security is like

1261
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
A private security comment being like

1262
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Hey I basically need

1263
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Two security persons

1264
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
To follow me around a convention

1265
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Is that fine

1266
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like for bodyguard

1267
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Well I feel like the reeflings would bodyguard me pretty much

1268
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So like any shitters would like

1269
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know get eaten up

1270
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I thought this

1271
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Thumbnail said backshot

1272
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Bro you've been on the patreon a lot too much

1273
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Okay that bodyguard

1274
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
All me three four

1275
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Four is quite a lot

1276
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's because you're Scottish

1277
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Nearly

1278
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Nearly even

1279
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
United with the UK

1280
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I've spotted no I can't read that

1281
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Five might be a good number

1282
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Five little reeflings

1283
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah paychecks a paycheck

1284
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Literally

1285
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The bodyguards just watching me

1286
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Like sit on everyone's face

1287
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Being like what have I been hired for

1288
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I thought it was a convention

1289
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
For like weebs or something

1290
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Like not understanding this like for retubers

1291
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We'd probably get weirder requests

1292
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Eh plausible

1293
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
True blood reeflings would be natural bodyguards

1294
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I think you'd have to hire professional security

1295
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah no that's not the planet

1296
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
A sniper too

1297
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Steady I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off

1298
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay and what is this

1299
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
France when Star Wars got released

1300
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Did you know

1301
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That in France when Star Wars got released

1302
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Was the last public beheading

1303
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What if they are also reeflings

1304
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The bodyguards

1305
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I don't think bodyguards with a full time job

1306
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Have enough time to

1307
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Listen to me Japanese

1308
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
About anything and everything that comes to my head

1309
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What yeah it's true

1310
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The year that Star Wars came out

1311
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Which is

1312
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
19

1313
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
7

1314
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
What

1315
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Year did first Star Wars

1316
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
1977

1317
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Was the last year there was a public

1318
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Execution in France

1319
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And also just happens to be the year

1320
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That Star Wars first came out

1321
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The evening

1322
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I've been at home

1323
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I have a full time job

1324
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I can hear you yapping and so why not

1325
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
How though

1326
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Aren't you getting distracted at work

1327
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Can I give you a bone bone at work

1328
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
When we do the ASMR stream please

1329
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The thought I have that kind of power

1330
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's too much power

1331
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Unlimited power

1332
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Speaking of Star Wars

1333
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Unlimited power

1334
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I was freaked me out that scene

1335
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You have done that to me at work

1336
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego

1337
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's like one of my favourite friggin concepts

1338
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh my god should I write a joystick

1339
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
About doing it at work

1340
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And being subtle

1341
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
No I don't want you to get fired

1342
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't want to encourage such behaviours

1343
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That you didn't get fired

1344
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
As much as you may despise

1345
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Work as a whole

1346
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's good for routine for the brain

1347
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's good for socialisation

1348
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's good for keeping you active

1349
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And the neurons firing

1350
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Maybe capitalism won a little bit there

1351
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But maybe reduce it to a 4 day work week

1352
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
4 day work week and not putting up to 10 hours

1353
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Cause that's outrageous

1354
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And then

1355
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
For those who choose to not

1356
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday

1357
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well

1358
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Cause that's not common

1359
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
In all countries

1360
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Anyway before the tinfoil

1361
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Hat goes back on

1362
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's been 44 minutes already

1363
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Guys why didn't you tell me to start the game

1364
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Are you squidding me right now

1365
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sheepy goes live

1366
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And tea mountains

1367
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And hour and five

1368
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Showing her thighs and feet

1369
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I have taken so long and been so distracted

1370
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Right let's turn on this desktop audio

1371
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So you guys can hear what I hear

1372
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And let me turn off my background theme

1373
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
This is what I hear in buckshot

1374
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay we're just going to jump into it

1375
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hopefully that's not too loud

1376
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Testing

1377
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
No that's too loud

1378
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Let's get my schedule off stream

1379
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Schedules we're very thankful

1380
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's been 45 minutes, start the game

1381
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh now you tell me

1382
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I might have to put brightness up

1383
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I noticed that in my Crash Bandicoot stream

1384
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The brightness was so not bright

1385
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But on my screens it was bright

1386
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Hold on hydration

1387
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
V-B-N-Y

1388
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
V-N-N-Four

1389
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Hold the scape tag

1390
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh

1391
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Oh my god we're Germans

1392
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Germans like to rave

1393
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Abandoned buildings for some reason

1394
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Can I get a light mate

1395
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You got any hint on ya

1396
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You got wee baggie on ya

1397
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
No right we'll just keep going then

1398
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Please sign the waiver

1399
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Please sign the waiver

1400
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
What's my name

1401
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh my god my name is

1402
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's me

1403
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's you

1404
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Dealer

1405
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
One live round

1406
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Two blanks

1407
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I insert the shells

1408
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
In an unknown order

1409
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh my god this back

1410
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like the faded background music

1411
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Shotgun

1412
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Shooting yourself with a blank

1413
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Skips the dealer's turn

1414
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
If there's two blanks

1415
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I shoot myself

1416
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I shoot myself

1417
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Okay, okay, okay

1418
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Statistically we're now at 50-50

1419
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We're at 50-50

1420
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'd rather give it to him

1421
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Shooting yourself

1422
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
No I want to shoot him

1423
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I shoot the dealer

1424
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
50-50

1425
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm sorry mate

1426
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Oh no

1427
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
He's gonna sh

1428
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
A defibrillator

1429
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Careful now

1430
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Defit a live

1431
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Three rounds

1432
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Two blanks

1433
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Odds are what

1434
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They entered the chamber

1435
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
In a hidden sequence

1436
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Free live

1437
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I want to shoot

1438
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Sorry, three live, two blank

1439
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Okay, now it's 50-50

1440
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Two live, two blank

1441
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay, okay, that's good

1442
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's good because now it's two live

1443
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
One blank, okay

1444
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I am shit at this game

1445
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You're lucky I left you with a charge

1446
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Get up and on

1447
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The night is young wait, do you want this?

1448
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Okay

1449
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Do I need to turn the brightness up

1450
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
On stream?

1451
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Bruh

1452
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The game

1453
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Is it bright enough for you guys?

1454
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Sorry, I'm gonna read chat

1455
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
No it's good, it's good, okay thank you

1456
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I don't know why but Crash Bandicoot was so dark

1457
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Wait, is he the one that read me then?

1458
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Welcome back

1459
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Hi

1460
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I thought this game took like 20 minutes to

1461
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
One live round

1462
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Two blanks, okay

1463
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
The odds are in my favor for a blank

1464
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So I'm gonna

1465
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Okay, okay, safe

1466
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And then again the 50

1467
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Surely I wouldn't lose the 50-50

1468
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The second time around

1469
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Are you serious?

1470
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
What the heck, I thought this was an easy game

1471
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Careful now

1472
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, goodness me

1473
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Right, three lives, two blanks

1474
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I used up all my luck

1475
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
On my daughters, that's what's happened

1476
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Right, three lives, shoot the dealer

1477
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay, the game is feeling kind

1478
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Because there's now two live and one blank

1479
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The game is trying to let me win now

1480
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm just gonna keep shooting

1481
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Okay, okay, we did it

1482
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We did it, we did it

1483
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
See, I do not gamble

1484
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I have absolutely no interest in gambling

1485
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And on the way to one replay

1486
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You did it

1487
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Let's go

1488
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's make this a little more

1489
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Interesting

1490
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair

1491
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm sitting on my toes

1492
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Two items each

1493
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
More items before

1494
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Every load, every load

1495
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
This is my kind of game

1496
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh, sheebie

1497
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You didn't tell me you were a part of this game

1498
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Sheebie

1499
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You do not

1500
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Sheebie

1501
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Four

1502
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
One live, one blank

1503
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yes

1504
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So what do you do?

1505
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Dealer

1506
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Skips the next turn

1507
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Does that mean if I sheebie him up?

1508
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I can just shoot both into him

1509
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And win

1510
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yeah

1511
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And then I get to shoot again

1512
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it

1513
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm getting it, I'm getting it

1514
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So we win

1515
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Take that

1516
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Okay

1517
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Now what?

1518
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Oh, I get more items every round

1519
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Okay, you should come round

1520
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Oh, beer

1521
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Meh

1522
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
What was that? No, no, no, come back out

1523
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
What was that? It said God

1524
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
A magnifying glass

1525
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
What was that? It said God

1526
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Two

1527
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, it's a 50-50 again

1528
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
50-50 again

1529
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
What does beer do?

1530
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Racks the shotgun

1531
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
EJX

1532
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Current shell

1533
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Racks the shotgun

1534
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Check the current round in the chamber

1535
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Whoa

1536
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's a blank

1537
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So I'll shoot me

1538
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Rack equals pump

1539
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I'll pump you in a minute

1540
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Don't you worry

1541
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't know if that means the same

1542
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But in Scots that means I'm gonna do

1543
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah

1544
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Okay

1545
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, I did a blank

1546
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So two to one

1547
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Okay

1548
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay

1549
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, per dealer is going down

1550
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But I don't wish him any ill

1551
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, he just looks creepy

1552
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But I don't... He's taking a cigarette

1553
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You know, a cigarette

1554
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What? Cigarettes are bad for your health

1555
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh

1556
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah

1557
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
To health

1558
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Bro

1559
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
He heals up and does double damage to me

1560
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You wet fart

1561
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Release me

1562
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh, I've lost this

1563
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know what kinda

1564
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I don't know what kinda stuff

1565
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
be going on

1566
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Sure, I'll take that and that

1567
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
What?

1568
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Two blanks, three live

1569
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, I'm not winning this one

1570
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Oh

1571
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This is such a creative game

1572
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'll give it though, I like this

1573
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's live

1574
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting

1575
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's so satisfying

1576
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I like how it's not too loud

1577
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I need to lower in-game volume

1578
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Or it's all good to go

1579
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Again

1580
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Okay

1581
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's fine, all good

1582
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Should've cuffed him first

1583
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Can I do multiple items per round?

1584
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Wow, I got two blanks

1585
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The game's feeling nice to me

1586
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Right, I think I can just shoot him

1587
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Cause there's only one left and it's live

1588
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah, take that

1589
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You wet fart

1590
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay, we're back on an even playing field

1591
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay, what items, what items

1592
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
What a curious game

1593
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
God, okay

1594
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
All I'm getting is handcuffs and beer

1595
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
50-50

1596
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Right

1597
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Right, I'll handcuff him

1598
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Please take these handcuffs

1599
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, it's a harem

1600
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Right, eject the current shell

1601
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It's 50-50, this will change the odds

1602
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Out of 50-50

1603
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Shit!

1604
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Wait, okay, so it's live now

1605
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The odds are more likely it's a live round

1606
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, we're doing it

1607
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We have probability

1608
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Okay, now it's likely

1609
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
to be blank because

1610
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
the odds are now one live to

1611
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
two blank or three blank

1612
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Oh, I don't like this part

1613
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay, okay

1614
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine

1615
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Right, and now it's again

1616
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
back to being live

1617
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Unless

1618
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Put the gun down

1619
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's not gonna change my mind

1620
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Live

1621
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
No!

1622
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm not gonna make every blank

1623
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Aw, he knows what's inside

1624
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Very interesting

1625
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Yeah, I'm not surprised

1626
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's a 1v1, careful now

1627
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh no

1628
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I don't know what

1629
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't even

1630
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I genuinely do not know what's

1631
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
in this

1632
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There's no point in racking the shell

1633
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Is there?

1634
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Cuff him, everyone says cuff him

1635
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Right, I'll listen to the replays

1636
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Cause you guys are smart

1637
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Right, I've cuffed him

1638
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And then I'm gonna

1639
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Okay

1640
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, I just ended the round

1641
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What?

1642
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Yes, I'll absolutely take that

1643
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, and a ciggy

1644
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Giazawi

1645
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Whoa, the odds are very high

1646
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
for a live round

1647
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Sorry, look

1648
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm not the smartest, right

1649
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff pass

1650
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yes, nicotine

1651
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No, it's not good

1652
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I actually did it

1653
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
A blank, right

1654
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Okay, okay

1655
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Me

1656
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Okay, that's good to go

1657
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Okay, so now it's like

1658
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
5 to 1

1659
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
We're just gonna shoot

1660
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
What a curious game

1661
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'm very intrigued by this

1662
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm intrigued by the dev team

1663
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm intrigued by the graph

1664
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
One reflying, and on one

1665
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah

1666
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Long last, we arrive at the final showdown

1667
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No more defibrillators

1668
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
No more blood transfusions

1669
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Now me and you

1670
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We are dancing on the edge of life and death

1671
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Eh

1672
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Eh

1673
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Four items each

1674
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Handcuff

1675
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Handcuff

1676
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Magnifying glass

1677
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Handcuff

1678
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm starting to forget about my feet going on

1679
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Eh

1680
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You know the drill

1681
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Is he gonna handcuff me?

1682
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
If I handcuff him

1683
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I can double

1684
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I can double shoot

1685
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And the odds are he's gonna get shot

1686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Okay, there you go

1687
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Okay, we're doing it

1688
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Uh

1689
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Doesn't tell you what his health actually is

1690
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But he's

1691
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So we can just double

1692
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Oh no, they're both blank, aren't they?

1693
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Ah, yeah

1694
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Wait, no

1695
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh no

1696
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I messed up, hold on

1697
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm so dumb

1698
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah, okay, right

1699
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And then fresh start and two new items

1700
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
What we get, what we get

1701
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Show me the money

1702
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
We got beer

1703
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
More handcuffs

1704
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, a beer

1705
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
More handcuffs

1706
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Four live, four blank

1707
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
50-50

1708
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Handcuff

1709
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That gives me two in a row

1710
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Uh

1711
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Eject one to make seven on the board

1712
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Odds our lives

1713
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000

1714
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000

1717
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

1718
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000

1719
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Four live

1720
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Wah

1721
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Can't give him that

1722
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Can eject again

1723
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Wait, no, wait

1724
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
What did I just do? Sorry

1725
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Three live, three live

1726
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
One blank, shoot

1727
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah

1728
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Cuff him

1729
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Oh, could I cuff there? No, he's still cuffed

1730
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Okay, now he's uncuffed

1731
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
He's gonna eject

1732
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Two live

1733
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
One blank

1734
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Handcuffed though

1735
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Health revivals

1736
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh, no

1737
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Ah

1738
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Eject alive

1739
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Two live remaining

1740
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Son of double for two health

1741
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
No

1742
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Three health total taken

1743
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Two live

1744
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Ah

1745
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
This game is good

1746
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
This game is good

1747
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh, I like this game

1748
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Hold on

1749
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Okay, we got a health, we got a peak

1750
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
We got two peaks, a health and a cuff

1751
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Three live, two blank

1752
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Okay

1753
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
We're gonna cuff

1754
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
We're gonna heal

1755
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We're gonna heal

1756
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Because we do need a cheeky bit of health

1757
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Because it is

1758
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Three live, two blank

1759
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Did we take a peak

1760
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Or did we

1761
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Wait, no, just taking a peak matter

1762
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
If he's cuffed

1763
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Well, because yeah

1764
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It doesn't matter

1765
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
No, it doesn't

1766
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
That's what

1767
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Two blank

1768
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, dear

1769
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh, dear

1770
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Right, doesn't matter if he's cuffed

1771
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You can just double shoot, doesn't matter what the results are

1772
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Right, what I've already forgotten

1773
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
What we're at, is it one live, two blank

1774
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Or two live, one blank

1775
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Heals, he's got two heals on the board

1776
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And he's got double son off

1777
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Now it's two live, one blank

1778
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Sugar, did you

1779
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah, he's gonna shoot me

1780
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
No, for two health

1781
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
He's gonna shoot me for the son off

1782
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Oh, this is

1783
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
My odds

1784
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Wow

1785
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Gosh

1786
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Wow, hopefully I can get some

1787
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Cigarettes

1788
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Right, cuff

1789
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Wait, why cuff?

1790
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's two blank now

1791
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's two blank now

1792
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah

1793
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
That's why I shouldn't have cuffed

1794
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Remaining ammo, zero

1795
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
They're both blank

1796
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm not right, I need to focus up

1797
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I need a piece of paper or something

1798
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It was a 1v1

1799
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Right, items, cuffs

1800
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Peak, peak

1801
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Oh, we've got a double son off

1802
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
If we peak, we could get a double

1803
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Four to two

1804
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Four

1805
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
To two

1806
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Cuff him

1807
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Let me know what's going on under the hood

1808
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Let me double up

1809
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
The damage under the hood

1810
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Beautiful

1811
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
This is acquire two HP damage

1812
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, that was satisfying

1813
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So now we are three live

1814
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Two blank

1815
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Now it is a two in three

1816
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Oh, dear

1817
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear

1818
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Cuff

1819
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Oh, he just released the blank

1820
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Oh, no, this can't be

1821
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
This can't be

1822
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh, dear, I am

1823
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
On life support, I believe there's

1824
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Unless that's it

1825
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I don't know

1826
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Okay

1827
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Well, I'm handcuffed, he's won

1828
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I've lost the odds game

1829
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Oh, no

1830
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Strummer bad

1831
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm handcuffed

1832
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Are you ready?

1833
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Yeah

1834
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Well, I can

1835
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Hopefully there's a heal

1836
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Double damage

1837
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Double damage

1838
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Double damage

1839
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh, what are these

1840
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Live, live, live, live

1841
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Five, live, three

1842
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Goodness me

1843
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Heals don't work anymore

1844
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh, you can't even heal anymore

1845
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Oh, that's why the game is giving me critical damage

1846
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Let's see what I'm working with

1847
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Blank

1848
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Well

1849
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Five to three

1850
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So now it's five to two

1851
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And then

1852
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
We'll just check again

1853
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Okay, live

1854
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And then we'll do double damage

1855
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Unfortunately, the odds are not in our favor

1856
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But, hey-ho

1857
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So that's four to

1858
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Two

1859
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
We're not gonna make it

1860
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Unless he throws

1861
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
We ain't gonna make it

1862
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh wait, what?

1863
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Wait

1864
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Are you saying there's a chance?

1865
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
If it's in the chamber, are you saying

1866
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
There's a chance?

1867
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Against all odds?

1868
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What?

1869
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
What?

1870
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
What did I do with it?

1871
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh my gosh

1872
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh my gosh

1873
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
From the brink

1874
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
What a fantastic game

1875
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Oh my goodness

1876
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Congratulations

1877
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And on shots fired

1878
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
24 shells ejected

1879
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
54 doors kicked

1880
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
4 cigarettes smoked

1881
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
2 millilitres of beer drank

1882
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Total cash

1883
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
23

1884
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
What a fantastic game

1885
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Where's any button to exit?

1886
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Wow

1887
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Double or nothing unlocked

1888
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Wow

1889
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Are these the developers?

1890
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The symbol?

1891
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
By computer game

1892
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
by Mike Kaluub

1893
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Nika

1894
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
What a fantastic game

1895
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
The visuals

1896
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
The direction

1897
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Did we go again?

1898
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Did we go again? Double or nothing?

1899
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
How did I do double or nothing?

1900
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Is it just start?

1901
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Just start

1902
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Start then click the pill bottle

1903
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Wow

1904
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Oh it's changed

1905
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's changed

1906
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Because of our progress

1907
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'll click the pill bottle

1908
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Consume pills may impair your ability to drive

1909
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But reflings I don't want you to go

1910
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Consume the double or nothing

1911
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh no the guy's gone

1912
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Bye strongy

1913
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
What an amazing game

1914
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Please sign the waiver

1915
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yes

1916
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Let's do it

1917
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I am blown away by this game

1918
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Sorry

1919
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I know how to spell your name

1920
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Sorry I didn't mean to misspell it

1921
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It was a genuine mistake

1922
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Double damage

1923
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Handcuff

1924
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Mobile phone

1925
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
What are you?

1926
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
One live to blank

1927
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
A mysterious voice gives you

1928
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
insight from the future

1929
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Swap the polarity

1930
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I think we'll just cuff

1931
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and double shoot

1932
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
If both of the blanks happen

1933
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
to be in there

1934
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Wow I have rubbish luck

1935
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
That's fine

1936
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Now it's a 50-50

1937
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
If I shoot a blank at him

1938
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I'm going to be

1939
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Should I go all?

1940
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Not looking

1941
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Okay rough start

1942
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Double or nothing

1943
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It was a double start

1944
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Okay

1945
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Two health already

1946
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
We've just gotten started on this

1947
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
He's got health up

1948
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Hydration check

1949
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Okay we can pump one out of the chamber

1950
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
We can heal and we can swap

1951
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Another polarity

1952
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Wow

1953
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Interesting curious

1954
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Again with a blank

1955
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I am going to

1956
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Puff one out of the chamber

1957
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
To see what the odds are

1958
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Okay now it's 50-50

1959
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So I'm going to heal up because we already know what it's going to happen

1960
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And then

1961
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
We're going to saw

1962
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
it off

1963
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And we're going all in on double damage

1964
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
against him

1965
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Dealer

1966
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Use the phone

1967
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Right I'll use the phone

1968
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Sorry it's the phone about the current round

1969
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
or the next round

1970
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Oh my god he's doing

1971
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Double damage against me

1972
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That's so bad

1973
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Right I'll do the phone my apologies

1974
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I thought the phone was like for the next round

1975
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Careful now

1976
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Careful re-flowing

1977
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Re-flowing

1978
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Wouldn't want to be dancing to death

1979
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Let's see you

1980
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
What is you

1981
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Okay

1982
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Ring ring hello

1983
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Three lie four blank

1984
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
The game is trying its best to help me right now

1985
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
A mysterious voice

1986
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
How smart

1987
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Do you think I am

1988
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Reflings to be able to

1989
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
retain the information

1990
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That on the sixth shell

1991
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's blank

1992
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
How smart do you think I am

1993
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
What is this a pipe bomb

1994
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Steal an item

1995
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And use it

1996
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Well

1997
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh no

1998
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Oh that's exactly what happened

1999
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
They put adrenaline directly

2000
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
into your bloodstream

2001
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
What was that medicine box

2002
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I wonder what this is

2003
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I don't have it yet

2004
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
There's nothing I can do

2005
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Other than cuff them

2006
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and double shoot

2007
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
What

2008
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That also means the fetus isn't going to be blank

2009
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I just need to send it

2010
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Sorry I can't

2011
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
No okay

2012
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So it means like these next few are live

2013
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Gotta go straight to cuff and meet

2014
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Okay

2015
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Okay I've definitely messed up this one

2016
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
What is that

2017
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
A medicine packet

2018
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
He takes a pill

2019
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh I healed

2020
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Okay that's fine, cigarette or pills heal

2021
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I know

2022
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I've lost

2023
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I've lost

2024
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh no

2025
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Who is he calling literally

2026
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Aw that's such a shame

2027
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Wait

2028
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
He put the polarizing effect on

2029
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Oh no I'm gone

2030
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Sorry

2031
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Right I didn't know how the phone worked

2032
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Not that it probably would have helped

2033
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh by the way the fifth one's a blank

2034
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Oh thanks for that mate

2035
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Let me just add it into my fucking calculator

2036
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And have the largest IQ

2037
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And my brain goes three-sided

2038
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
You know the average person who can only retain

2039
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Like freaking what

2040
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Four bits of information at a time

2041
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Like come on give me a chance game

2042
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Let me write it down, give me a wee piece of paper

2043
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And I'll write it down just like this

2044
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
He kicked the hell out of this cuttlefish

2045
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Literally I'm calamari right now

2046
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
By all accounts right

2047
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Let's try that again

2048
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Pump one out of the chamber

2049
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Adrenaline burst, health and double damage

2050
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Okay

2051
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Okay we can work with this

2052
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Four before

2053
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Two live, three blank

2054
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
What do I do with that information

2055
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I don't know

2056
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
If three blank should I shoot myself

2057
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Or should I make the odds known

2058
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
If it's 50-50

2059
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Three blank, two

2060
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
50-50 double damage

2061
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Let's go

2062
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
50-50 double damage

2063
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Two blanks in a row

2064
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Possibly

2065
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh yes

2066
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Okay, okay, okay

2067
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Okay

2068
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
He's gonna pump it out

2069
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Now it's back to 50-50

2070
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank

2071
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yep and then one health damage on me

2072
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect

2073
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And let me win

2074
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But that's slightly different

2075
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Okay, okay, that's good

2076
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Let him get up, let him get up

2077
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Good shot

2078
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Are you squinting me right now

2079
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Cooper

2080
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Brian, Blasterman

2081
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Thank you for the five

2082
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Cooper and yes I will Blasterman

2083
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Okay two blank one live

2084
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I have nothing

2085
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
What's that

2086
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Medicine, steal his medicine

2087
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I think I'm gonna steal his health

2088
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Prevent him from healing up

2089
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Give me that

2090
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Give me that

2091
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
What does it do?

2092
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Why did my head just

2093
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Two blank one live

2094
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Two blank one live

2095
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Okay

2096
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Medicine is 50% chance one damage

2097
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And two heal

2098
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh wait is that

2099
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Okay we are classic 50-50

2100
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
If we get this

2101
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
We have won the first round of doubler nothing

2102
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Dealer

2103
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Oh that was a clean round

2104
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That was a clean round of odds

2105
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Very clean

2106
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And on wins, okay

2107
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm taking medicine again

2108
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Because I didn't realise I could hurt myself with it

2109
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Okay

2110
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Oh great

2111
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Fucking tiddlywink spawn

2112
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
No I'm not taking that

2113
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Okay what are the rounds

50-50 full eight

2117
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Okay

2118
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Remove one from the chamber

2119
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Let me know my odds

2120
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
4-4

2121
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
3-4

2122
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
3-3

2123
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
6 total

2124
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
4th shell live

2125
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Ray

2126
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Can I just take his fucking heal then

2127
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
6

2128
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
4 is life

2129
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
6 total 4 is life

2130
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
6 total 4 is life

2131
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So I have to

2132
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It's most likely a blank

2133
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You know that

2134
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
If 4 is live in that sequence

2135
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
There are most likely 2 blanks before it

2136
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Wait

2137
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Am I an idiot

2138
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Did I not take a heal

2139
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Did I not take a cigarette

2140
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Am I being dumb

2141
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Did I not

2142
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
2

2143
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Is your max

2144
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You can't over heal

2145
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Oh

2146
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Fuck

2147
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Fuck

2148
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Fuck

2149
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Fucking just shoot him

2150
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This is not gonna work well

2151
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
No

2152
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
No

2153
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
No

2154
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Why is he doing polarizing

2155
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Meh I suck at this game

2156
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Let me go again

2157
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
We've got time for another

2158
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Why is this game

2159
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Ah fuck he's suck at this shite

2160
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
The only thing I'm good for sucking is willy

2161
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Not this game

2162
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Get me in that room

2163
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000

2164
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000

2165
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Please sign the waiver I consent

2166
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Your gacha luck is not great

2167
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I've actually never played a gacha game

2168
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Call in a friend

2169
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Polarizing in the seat

2170
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Right I'm glad we can get a peek

2171
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Right let's try this again

2172
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's okay

2173
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
It's okay

2174
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I'm gonna take a peek

2175
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
What have we got

2176
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Alive

2177
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I am gonna steal

2178
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
His sawn off and give him 2 damage

2179
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Now I'm aware he has a heal there

2180
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
No I'm not

2181
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I'm gonna steal his heal

2182
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Fuck off

2183
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Your cigarettes are mine

2184
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Awww you can't over heal

2185
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
The reeflings just told you

2186
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
That mere moments ago that you can't over heal

2187
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
In this game mode and what do you do

2188
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Reade it over heal

2189
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
You could have had him down to 2

2190
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
You could have had him on the ropes

2191
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
But no no

2192
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Okay 50-50 odds

2193
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
He's getting insider knowledge

2194
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Did you know

2195
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Celebrities calling the paparazzi

2196
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
To tell them ahead of time

2197
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Where they're gonna

2198
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Right

2199
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
3 lives

2200
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
2

2201
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Blank

2202
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And he's gonna hurt me

2203
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Real good

2204
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
3 lives 2 blank

2205
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
3 lives

2206
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000

2207
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
2 blank we won blank 3 lives

2208
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Boom

01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
That's right take that you stinky stinker

2210
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
No 2 lives

2211
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
1 blank

2212
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yeah I'm not surprised

2213
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm not surprised

2214
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
That's okay

2215
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Let him get up

2216
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So now there is no blank

2217
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
How can that not count

2218
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Awww

2219
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That was even again

2220
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Okay it's fine we're back

2221
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Right now

2222
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
There's no blank yeah there's nothing now

2223
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Okay let's try that again

2224
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Not gonna take that

2225
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Might use that

2226
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Double or nothing double or nothing

2227
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Double that dammit

2228
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Okay 50-50

2229
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It's 50-50

2230
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
The only thing I can do is call in a pow

2231
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I don't

2232
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's 50-50

2233
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Let's give him the damage

2234
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Let's go let's brain hell

2235
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
When I said brain hell

2236
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I didn't mean like wind

2237
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Literally all he

2238
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
He felt was a little

2239
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Wait

2240
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Awww

2241
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000

01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Alright so that's blank

2243
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Very

2244
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Interesting

2245
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
What are you stealing

2246
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Give it back

2247
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Oh you can have that

2248
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Please hurt yourself with it

2249
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm gonna make it

2250
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm so bad at this game

2251
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Careful now

2252
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm trying to be careful but I suck

2253
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Okay

2254
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
If I eject this one

2255
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself

2256
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I'm removing this one

2257
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
The next one is blank

2258
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So I'm just gonna

2259
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Play it safe and do that

2260
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
He is using developer luck

2261
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Remaining ammo

2262
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Oh my god you guys try to help me so much

01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Double saw it off at least

2266
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Why did I get two turns in a room there

2267
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Wow

01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000

What is he doing

2272
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Polarizing

2273
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Okay

2279
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Let me try again

2280
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Let me get up

2281
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I'm afraid

2282
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm very afraid

2283
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The force was a blank

2284
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah that's why I shot myself with it

2285
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Sorry this must be painful

2286
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I'm so sorry

2287
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I'm not very smart

2288
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart by playing connect 4 with me

2289
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
In old school runescape

2290
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Anon

2291
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
You know what

2292
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Yeah that's right

2293
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Call me big willy

2294
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Cause I got a big massive willy

2295
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
One

2296
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Right

2297
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Let's try hard

2298
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
It's time to try

2299
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Not two irons or he only got two as well

2300
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Big willy

2301
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It's a 50-50

2302
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Let's try again

2303
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If it's a 50-50

2304
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I could just win by doing this

2305
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But he can do the save to shoot me

2306
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But he can still

2307
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
He can still hurt me

2308
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Cause the first one wasn't

2309
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Wait what

2310
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh if you shoot yourself you get to play a second turn

2311
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's finally starting to make a little bit of sense

2312
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Health?

2313
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But I can't overheal so don't get jealous

2314
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Whoa

2315
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Why so many irons

2316
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh he got loads of irons too

2317
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Two life three blank

2318
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Three

2319
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Three blank

2320
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
No it's 50-50

2321
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
No

2322
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It's

2323
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Oh god

2324
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I can't use my brain and talk at the same time

2325
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Just let me see what it is

2326
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Please

2327
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Okay

2328
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
So if I shoot myself

2329
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I get to go again

2330
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And then I get to double shotgun

2331
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Barrel you

2332
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Am I doing it?

2333
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I think I'm doing it

2334
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Why is my luck so poor

2335
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
There's all life now

2336
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
What does polarize do?

2337
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
You could have inverted

2338
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And then sawn for the win

2339
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Wait that works backwards as well

2340
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
If I know it's blank

2341
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Polarize it to change it

2342
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
This must be the most painful place

2343
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Or you've ever seen

2344
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I even think we're going to be able to do it

2345
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
In time for Shibi's monetization stream

2346
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Okay

2347
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I didn't realize polarizing

2348
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Swapped

2349
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The

2350
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Oh shit I did not pay attention

2351
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
To how many live in

2352
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
You know

2353
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
If I know it's a blank use polarizing

2354
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Got it

2355
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
If I know it's a blank use polarizing

2356
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Okay it's alive

2357
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It's alive

2358
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So I am going to

2359
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Steal your double damage

2360
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Steal his saw

2361
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Steal his double damage

2362
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
If I know it's a blank

2363
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Polarize

2364
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
If I know it's a blank

2365
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Polarize

2366
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
You've already finished the game

2367
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
This is infinite mode

2368
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Wait it's the same

2369
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Right he's on one health

2370
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
He's gonna

2371
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Sawn a friend which is fine

2372
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
He's gonna

2373
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
He's gonna cuff me

2374
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Zadim

2375
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Oh yeah you want to

2376
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Cuff me up

2377
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Right he's healed which is fine

2378
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
We're no one even Steven

2379
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
What was that

2380
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Adrenaline he's healing again

2381
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Oh you could

2382
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yes

2383
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Hello

2384
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Why would you do that

2385
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Question mark

2386
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Did you mean to do that

2387
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Okay please

2388
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Take a xp

2389
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I hear a health down health down

2390
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Aha

2391
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Oh yeah

2392
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Oh no he's done polarizing

2393
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh no

2394
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh no

2395
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Ow

2396
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Oh no

2397
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I don't know what it is

2398
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I don't know what's left

2399
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Oh I do know what's left

2400
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So if I blank myself

2401
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Oh polarize

2402
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Polarize you stupid women

2403
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
You

01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Polarize

2405
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Polarize

2406
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Polarize the blank

2407
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oh my god I was so

2408
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I freaking clicked it and my brain was like

2409
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Wait a minute you were supposed to do something

2410
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Freaking polarize

2411
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000

2417
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Inspect element

2418
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Inspect element blank

2419
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Blank found

2420
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Polarize effect added

2421
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Polarizing

2422
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And then what

2423
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Shoot myself or shoot him with polarize on

2424
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Shoot him with polarize on

2425
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Man she sure is pretty

2426
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah that's all I got going for me

2427
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
This feature of model is adorable

2428
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Okay shoot him

2429
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
We did it

2430
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I was so sorry

2431
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Shoot um right we did it

2432
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Willy wins

2433
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Big Willy wins

2434
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Imagine if this is the run I went on

2435
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And it's the one I call myself Willy on

2436
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Right

2437
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Okay let's see what we're working with baby

2438
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Rejection

2439
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Calling

2440
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Focus right

2441
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Uh

2442
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
For help on big Willy 50-50 odds

2443
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Okay

2444
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He can see he can cuff and he can double damage

2445
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Maybe the phone

2446
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Can tell me if what's first

2447
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
If not I'll just use the magnifying glass

2448
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
That's absolutely nothing

2449
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Can you not pick like the second bullet

2450
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So I'll actually remember

2451
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Right I don't have polarizing

2452
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So I can shoot myself for free

2453
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
That's one

2454
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
So odds are

2455
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I can just shoot him

2456
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Nooo

2457
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Are you fucking kidding me

2458
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
High odds of being

2459
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Live literally the seventh shell is blind

2460
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So and

2461
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
And two bullets have been utilized

2462
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
This is the third bullet

2463
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Being utilized

2464
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Right

2465
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So the odds of this one being live

2466
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Are high again

2467
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh no

2468
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Okay

2469
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Is that four shots now

2470
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So then five and six are live

2471
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Five is live

2472
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So

2473
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What

2474
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
What

2475
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Does this game want from me

2476
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
What does this game want from me

2477
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
My odds

2478
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I know you can't rely on odds

2479
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
That's just how odds work

2480
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
My odds are

2481
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Astronomically

2482
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Right Willy's definitely

2483
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We can't even do it as Willy

2484
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
We have to go back to our roots

2485
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Cause this clearly isn't working

2486
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
It wants you to suffer

2487
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
My poor Willy

2488
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
My poor Willy got blown off

2489
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Right

2490
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I'm actually

2491
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I'm like do I get a piece of paper

2492
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Cause I might

2493
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
These are good items

2494
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
What are the odds

2495
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Give me a 50-50

2496
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
We've got a 50-50

2497
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I can't overheal past two

2498
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
If it's

2499
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
50-50

2500
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Let me see

2501
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
What's

2502
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Or eject

2503
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I might be able to

2504
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Eject 50-50

2505
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And tell me what's up

2506
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Right taking it out alive

2507
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So if we're gonna get a blank

2508
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
We're gonna steal the polarizing

2509
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
No it's live

2510
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I really don't have a double

2511
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Oh sugar but he has the polarizing

2512
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Well next to a blank

2513
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So if he uses polarizing

2514
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Then he's won

2515
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I think

2516
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
No he can only do one damage to me this round

2517
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Okay okay

2518
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Steal the car

2519
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I don't think

2520
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
That would have

2521
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Bro

2522
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Bro it's not looking good

2523
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Why is this game so hard

2524
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I just need you guys to like

2525
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Send me your gaming footage

2526
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
So I just commentate over it

2527
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Cause this is getting so bad

2528
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Careful now

2529
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
All I've been told this game is careful now

2530
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Careful now

2531
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Careful now

2532
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Yeah yeah yeah

2533
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
They're both blank we know

2534
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
We know they're blank

2535
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Well at least I

2536
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Have a cigarette

2537
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Right

2538
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Two live three blank

2539
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
But he doesn't have a polarizing

2540
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So blank actually means

2541
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Blank in this game

2542
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I'm gonna steal his

2543
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Cigarette

2544
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
No

2545
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Can I get a vase

2546
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Three blank two live

2547
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Can I get a vase

2548
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So the three blank are up ahead

2549
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
So odds are

2550
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
This is blank

2551
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Can I steal his health

2552
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I don't want him to heal

2553
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Yeah this is blank

2554
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's my guess

2555
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Oh for fuck's sake I keep being greedy

2556
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Right this is blank sorry

2557
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I'm guessing but

2558
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah okay odds are

2559
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Right I'm happy with that

2560
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I'm happy with that

2561
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Right we're gonna take a peek

2562
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Blank again wow

2563
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Blank again

2564
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And then the rest are live

2565
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
In a room

2566
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Well unfortunately he's gonna get a lick in on me

2567
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
How do I suck so badly

2568
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I'm not being funny I'm getting

2569
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Absolutely rolled

2570
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm getting

2571
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Just

2572
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
They're making a mockery out of me

2573
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
They're making an absolute mockery out of me

2574
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Does this guy even have a name

2575
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Okay phone a friend

2576
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Adrenaline

2577
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal

2578
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Right it's a 50-50

2579
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You need to start comboing the items

2580
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Oh I'm too dumb for that though

2581
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
That's actually

2582
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
An injection into

2583
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
That

2584
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Adrenaline into your heart

2585
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Which basically forces it to go

2586
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Blank

2587
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I'm just shooting

2588
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So anyway I start blasting

2589
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Cause I'm unable to keep up with them

2590
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Right there we go boom

2591
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Oh wait I actually won out of just pure frustration

2592
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
We won that round

2593
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Anyway start blasting

2594
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
We did it we made it to round 2

2595
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Of double or nothing

2596
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I've still yet to make it to round 3

2597
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Okay let's see what we get

2598
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Cough, double

2599
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Damage, adrenaline

2600
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Not medicine

2601
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Medicine that's not really medicine

2602
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Too blind

2603
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Does he have a polarizer he does

2604
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Phone and a friend

2605
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Wow okay

2606
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Steel

2607
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Polarizer

2608
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Shoot him

2609
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Steel polarizer

2610
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Shoot him

2611
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Yes

2612
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Steel polarizer

2613
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Shoot him

2614
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Steel and then shoot

2615
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Okay

2616
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Then he'll shoot blank on me

2617
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Cause we know it doesn't have anything in it

2618
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And then double sawing off

2619
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Oh he's healing

2620
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Okay

2621
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So let him shoot

2622
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That's just fine cause it's blank

2623
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Oh

2624
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Forgot he can get an extra turn

2625
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
If he shoots himself

2626
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I keep

2627
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I keep forgetting the mechanics

2628
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Of this dumb game

2629
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Why is it he is allowed to heal

2630
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And he's allowed to do this

2631
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And he's allowed to do that

2632
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Don't you know the video game rules

2633
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Only I'm supposed to be able to do

2634
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
All the things that help me win the game

2635
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I never thought that far ahead

2636
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I never thought in the first place

2637
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That should be my sentence I don't think

2638
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Right what was that 50-50

2639
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Right at least we can heal first

2640
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Watch your enemies

2641
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Hand closed

2642
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Hordeshell

2643
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Live round that gives me nothing

2644
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Thank you don't ever speak to me again

2645
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
What's in the chamber

2646
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Blank

2647
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I don't have a polarizer

2648
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
So I can officially shoot myself

2649
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Bunk

2650
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Right and then

2651
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And then what

2652
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I mean that means all Tsar

2653
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
It's a double

2654
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Cuff him

2655
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Okay and then what

2656
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And then

2657
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
The best I can do is just guess

2658
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I'll say it from this one

2659
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
So is this the third

2660
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Wow

2661
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
This is why I don't gamble

2662
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I have no interest in gambling

2663
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact

2664
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Because it's a Gamba game

2665
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Or something like that

2666
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I actually don't know if Genshin Impact

2667
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Is a Gamba game but

2668
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Yeah

2669
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Remaining ammo

2670
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
The fact you're trying to help me

2671
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And it doesn't help because I'm so dumb

2672
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It doesn't help

2673
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I'm too dumb to be helped

2674
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
You guys are just going to have to send in

2675
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Your gameplay and I'll commentate over

2676
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And pretend that I'm playing

2677
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That seems like a plan

2678
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Surely

2679
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm not, I'm losing it

2680
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
New round

2681
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Let's see what we've got

2682
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Let's see what we're working with

2683
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Two lives, three blanks

2684
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Okay, okay, okay

2685
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Oh yeah

2686
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
A burner

2687
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Just show me if it's good or bad

2688
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It's good

2689
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I don't have a polariser though

2690
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Clink

2691
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And there's four in the chamber left

2692
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So let's talk to the phone

2693
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Because the bass ain't listening

2694
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay

2695
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That means the odds have increased

2696
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
That this is a live round

2697
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
So we're going to say

2698
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Funk it

2699
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And we start

2700
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Blasting

2701
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Okay, we know next is blank

2702
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
But he doesn't

2703
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
He doesn't have a polariser

2704
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Either

2705
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Hold on

2706
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Oh

2707
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Good or bad

2708
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
We know this is blank

2709
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
But we know that this is live

2710
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And now he knows it's live

2711
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And he's got a double

2712
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
It's ogre

2713
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's ogre

2714
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
And he's cuffing me

2715
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Bro

2716
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Wait what

2717
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Now it's live

2718
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Oh my goodness

2719
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Golly

2720
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
If you are like me in small brain

2721
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
This game ain't for you

2722
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I've got one more in the tank

2723
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Because she's actually getting ready to go live

2724
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
We've got one more

2725
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Come on

2726
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
That's it, you know what

2727
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I'm getting a piece of paper out for this

2728
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I'm writing down

2729
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
This freaking piece of paper

2730
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Writing on in this game

2731
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I'm going to call in

2732
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
This freaking

2733
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I'm going to call in the big guns

2734
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Which is me writing on a piece of paper

2735
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
To write down the odds

2736
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
To write down what there is

2737
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
To write down what to do

2738
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
If we do not win this one

2739
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
This settles it

2740
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
That you guys are just far too smart for me

2741
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And you have picked the most

2742
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Our worded oh she

2743
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
There possibly could be

2744
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Right

2745
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Pull out items

2746
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Magnifying glass

2747
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Health

2748
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
No don't want meds

2749
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I'm not taking my meds you can't convince me

2750
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Right

2751
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
What's in the chamber

2752
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Two live

2753
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Three blank

2754
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
And then I'm going to do it

2755
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Like hangman on my piece of paper

2756
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So the odds are already

2757
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Not

2758
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
The best

2759
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I am going

2760
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
To

2761
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Seal his phone

2762
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I'm going to steal his phone

2763
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
No

2764
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Yes

2765
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yes I'm going to steal his phone

2766
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
To get the intel

2767
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Fifth shelf blank

2768
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Okay so for hangman

2769
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
There's now a B on the fifth

2770
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
One

2771
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
For blank

2772
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
We are going to see what's inside

2773
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Because either way we're doing damage to this round

2774
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's a blank so we're going to apply the polarizing effect

2775
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
We're going to put B on the first

2776
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Hangman section as well

2777
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So we're polarizing to make it hurt

2778
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
The dealer

2779
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Is being shot with the polarizing effect

2780
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Resulting new damage dealt to the dealer

2781
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Okay

2782
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Okay

2783
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
So first one's blank

2784
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Last one's blank we now know this

2785
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
That's perfectly fine

2786
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper

2787
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And playing hangman

2788
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I do not fully understand this game

2789
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Neither am I that's why we're playing hangman

2790
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
He is now inspecting

2791
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
He claims

2792
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
The contents are very interesting

2793
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
He shoots me

2794
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
With a live round

2795
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
The second position is live

2796
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
We are now on a 50-50

2797
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
On the contents of the gun being live

2798
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Or blank, we cannot ascertain

2799
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
We can heal up

2800
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But we cannot ascertain what is inside

2801
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
This truly is a 50-50

2802
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
He drank a beer

2803
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
What did I miss it? Two and three were live

2804
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
So we know it's a blank

2805
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Wait

2806
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
But none of us have a polarizer

2807
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
So this round can be complete

2808
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So we need to start a new freaking round

2809
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
In hangman game

2810
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Goodness gravy

2811
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
All blanks

2812
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Okay

2813
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
A BBL

2814
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby

2815
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Right

2816
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Let's play hangman over again

2817
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Let me, what is the ratio

2818
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Three live four blank

2819
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Three live

2820
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Four blank

2821
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Full of seven on hangman

2822
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
One, two, three, four, five

2823
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Seven, I have adrenaline

2824
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
To call in

2825
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
For information

2826
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Which we're gonna do

2827
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Right

2828
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
You can yoink the yoink

2829
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Right, position second shell

2830
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Blank, hangman

2831
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Second is B blank

2832
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Oh sugar I just dropped my pencil

2833
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
If we handcuff

2834
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
And we are going to act like

2835
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
The first one is live

2836
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Okay

2837
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
We are going to treat it as live

2838
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
We do not know and we cannot ascertain

2839
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
If that information is true or not

2840
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
However we can shoot ourselves for

2841
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Okay that was a blank

2842
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
We know the second is a blank

2843
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So first two are filled out Bs

2844
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That leaves two blank and three

2845
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Live on the board

2846
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
We are going to shoot ourselves to give ourselves another round

2847
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Sadly

2848
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
There are now

2849
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Five pieces

2850
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Remaining

2851
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
And we cannot ascertain the knowledge

2852
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
So we're going to treat it as alive

2853
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
This truly is a 50-50

2854
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
We're gonna treat it as alive cause the odds are it's alive

2855
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
You know what I'm just gonna go fuck myself then

2856
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
You know what

2857
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Because that's the thing with odds

2858
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
That is the thing with odds

2859
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
That is the thing with odds

2860
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Yeah

2861
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Yeah it could literally

2862
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
You can flip a coin ten times in a row

2863
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
And statistically never get heads

2864
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Ten times in a row

2865
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But that's the thing with odds they are not reality

2866
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Yeah yeah

2867
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah yeah

2868
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Yeah

2869
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Yeah yeah

2870
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That's right another

2871
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Sorry I'm addicted

2872
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I'm addicted I like this approach sorry

2873
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
The hangman approach is quite fun

2874
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm addicted I can't stop right

2875
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We've got ten minutes to speak on this

2876
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Come on

2877
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Ten minutes

2878
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Oh my god come on

2879
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Please sign the waiver I will

2880
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Anything for you dealer let me do it again

2881
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Again again again again

2882
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Ah

2883
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Okay

2884
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Let's do it

2885
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Let's do it

2886
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Uh

2887
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Right

2888
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Let's go

2889
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Who goes there

2890
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Identify yourself

2891
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Three live

2892
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Four blank

2893
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Three live

2894
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Four blank

2895
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Seven hangman

2896
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Okay

2897
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
We have adrenaline

2898
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
We are going to get

2899
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Intel from this adrenaline

2900
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I assume we can only use adrenaline

2901
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Once again right the intel is

2902
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
The intel is

2903
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Third shell live route

2904
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Okay

2905
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Can we do double adrenaline

2906
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Hello

2907
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Double adrenaline

2908
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
That's cheating

2909
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Blind shit

2910
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh we have a polarizer

2911
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Okay that's perfect

2912
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
If we hand cuff

2913
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Or does that leave

2914
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That's two live on the board we don't know

2915
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
About three live on the board we don't know

2916
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Tell you what we could do

2917
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Hand cuff

2918
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Polarize

2919
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Shit

2920
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Discard

2921
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
The current unknown

2922
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Because we don't know what it is

2923
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
And I don't trust it

2924
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
So we're just gonna discard it

2925
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Okay we're just gonna discard it

2926
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
It doesn't really matter

2927
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Okay so we can write down blank in second

2928
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
So now there's two blank and two live

2929
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
The odds are straight back to 50-50 again

2930
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
We are going to shoot

2931
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Okay okay so now there's one blank

2932
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Remaining and two live on the board

2933
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
He's gonna eject a blank

2934
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So all remaining are now live

2935
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Shit

2936
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And he's gonna do

2937
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
He's gonna do three health damage in the sequence

2938
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Wait

2939
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Yeah no

2940
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Sorry sorry sorry

2941
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Then blank was the fifth there and then it's two live

2942
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Remaining now

2943
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Sorry my apologies

2944
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Two live remaining

2945
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Unfortunately he will get a lick

2946
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
In on us but that's fine

2947
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
That's fine

2948
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Do you feel so big brain now

2949
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
No I'm cheating by playing hangman and writing it down

2950
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
That's how hard this game is for me to conceptualize it

2951
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
In my head

2952
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I cannot do this in an

2953
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Abstract

2954
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Concept

2955
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't have the ability to do this

2956
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I have to write everything down

2957
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
We've got insight

2958
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
We've got two insights

2959
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Fantastic

2960
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I'm not gonna do it for this round

2961
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
He's got a polarizer

2962
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
No he doesn't

2963
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I might as well shoot then

2964
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Shouldn't I

2965
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
There's no point in using this stuff

2966
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It's a 50-50 I might as well just shoot

2967
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
There's no point

2968
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I've got two phones

2969
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
One for the veiler

2970
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
No use the phone

2971
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
No get info

2972
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
But wait wait wait hold on

2973
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Hold on

2974
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
What's the point in me using the phone

2975
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Right now because it's 50-50

2976
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
If it's a blank

2977
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Oh wait

2978
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Yeah idiot

2979
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
If it's a blank then he can't get a lick in on me

2980
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Sorry

2981
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I'm so slow

2982
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
It takes me a moment to remember

2983
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
The way this game plays

2984
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I'm so sorry

2985
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
We are on to the second round

2986
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Okay

2987
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Okay okay okay big brain time

2988
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Big brain time

2989
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Winkles

2990
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Becoming more wrinkly in your brain

2991
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Your smooth piece of chicken breast

2992
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Brain is no magnifying

2993
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Three live three blank

2994
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Three live three blank

2995
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Hangman of six

2996
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Okay

2997
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Insider knowledge

2998
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Yes please

2999
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Third shell

3000
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Blank

3001
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Okay

3002
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Yonkers

3003
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I would like insider knowledge

3004
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
From the adrenaline burst

3005
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Okay

3006
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
What are you gonna tell me

3007
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Fourth shell

3008
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Blank

3009
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Okay

3010
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Now that leaves one blank

3011
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Unknown

3012
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
The odds

3013
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Is now one in four

3014
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Of the current shell

3015
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Chamber being a blank

3016
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I think I want to shoot

3017
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
So anyway

3018
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I start blasting

3019
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
The odds of one in four

3020
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Yeah okay that's what I like to see

3021
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Live one in four

3022
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
We are going

3023
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Okay he's gonna heal up that's perfectly fine

3024
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
He is gonna be able to see what's inside

3025
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And he does have a polarizer

3026
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
So I'm gonna have to be cautious of that

3027
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
He's gonna check it out

3028
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
What do you see

3029
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Very interesting

3030
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Okay

3031
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Oh he's shooting it's alive

3032
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Okay

3033
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
So the next two we know are blank

3034
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
So we can blank it up to high heavens

3035
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Okay

3036
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Blank

3037
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Bonk

3038
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
And then blank again

3039
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Thanks to our insider knowledge

3040
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
And it worked

3041
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And blank again

3042
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Then we are going to drink the beer

3043
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
To inject the second last bullet

3044
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Because we will be able to

3045
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
If this is blank

3046
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Or if it's live so that was live

3047
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
So that means the remaining one is blank

3048
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
So we can just shoot ourselves

3049
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Bonk okay all good

3050
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
All good in the hood right new round

3051
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
We do

3052
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Insider

3053
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
The game knows we are playing hangman

3054
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
The game knows what we got

3055
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Four live four blank

3056
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Four live

3057
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Four blank

3058
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Hangman one two three

3059
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Okay I don't have enough room on the paper

3060
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
One two three four five six

3061
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Seven eight sorry I need to re-write that

3062
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Because I put it at really awkward bits

3063
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Right

3064
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Let me know what's the update

3065
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Let us know what's going on here

3066
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Third shell live

3067
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Perfect

3068
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Let me know what else is going down

3069
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Obliet

3070
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I didn't realise he could do that

3071
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Yeah

3072
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I didn't know he could do that

3073
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Like thanks

3074
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Right I'm going to

3075
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Against my better judgement

3076
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I'm still going to take this

3077
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Because it's so much better and more valuable

3078
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
To know what's coming up

3079
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Fifth shell live

3080
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Okay okay okay

3081
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
We only don't know where two are

3082
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
That leaves me to believe

3083
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So the odds are now

3084
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
What

3085
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
One in three that this is blank

3086
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
No that's not correct

3087
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I want to shoot myself

3088
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Against my better judgement

3089
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I'm going to claim this as a blank

3090
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Because statistically it should be

3091
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Okay

3092
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
We did it

3093
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Okay we have a second round now

3094
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
There are

3095
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Three blank

3096
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
What does this mean

3097
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Cigarettes I can't heal up

3098
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I don't think

3099
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
In Minecraft

3100
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
In Minecraft

3101
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Unknown second live

3102
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I don't know

3103
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Shoot or not

3104
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Your max is HP 4

3105
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Let's have a wee quick

3106
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
We'll start mull over this

3107
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Thank you

3108
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
My apologies

3109
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I thought this was like you couldn't heal it

3110
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
A 4 4 4

3111
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Should we get a cigarette

3112
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Smoker and gen 2

3113
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Apparently that's a really big kink

3114
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That I didn't know about

3115
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
A wham and smokes a ciggy

3116
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
No

3117
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I don't know what it's going to be

3118
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
You know what

3119
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
If I shoot myself

3120
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
It's actually going to not be that bad

3121
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Okay we know this one is live

3122
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So we can shoot

3123
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
A double shot

3124
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I get so excited to like

3125
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Utilize

3126
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
We would have gone on to the next round

3127
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Oh we would have gone on to the next round

3128
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
If I wasn't so

3129
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Freakin quick shorty

3130
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Okay

3131
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
He just ejected alive

3132
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So it's live live live actually

3133
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Wait what

3134
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Oh

3135
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Thanks for letting me go to the other round

3136
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Even though I messed up I appreciate you dealer

3137
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
The game must know

3138
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I'm like sweating so hard

3139
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
We finally made it

3140
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
To round 3

3141
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Okay

3142
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Okay

3143
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Hangman ain't got nothing on us

3144
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Okay

3145
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Medicine

3146
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Polarize

3147
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
That's fine

3148
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
2 live 2 blank

3149
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
2 live

3150
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
3 blank sorry

3151
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Sorry number

3152
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
We have no insider information

3153
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
We have odds which is blank

3154
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
The odds

3155
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Stepulate this is a blank

3156
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
So I shouldn't theory put the polarizing

3157
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
On and shoot myself

3158
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
We have to go with odds

3159
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
We have no choice shoot the dealer with polarizer

3160
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
On

3161
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So that was a blank

3162
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So now it's 2 to 50 50

3163
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Perfect and he can see what's inside

3164
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Very interesting

3165
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Live okay

3166
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
The odds are now 1 live

3167
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
2 blank

3168
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Wow

3169
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Wow

3170
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Wow

3171
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
If I take the medicine I expire

3172
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Because my odds are not good enough

3173
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
This is it

3174
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I either win this game mode

3175
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Or get it on whatever we pick

3176
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Now the odds are

3177
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
This is blank

3178
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Swallow the medicine

3179
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I'll swallow it

3180
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Because you asked me to

3181
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Refling

3182
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Ah!

3183
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Refling

3184
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Ah!

3185
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Forever tame because she be live with celebration

3186
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It was worth it though

3187
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I died doing what I love the most

3188
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Guzzling refling's ink

3189
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I perished doing what I love the most

3190
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Okay

3191
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
So I don't feel that bad

3192
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
That was so good

3193
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
That was fantastic

3194
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I can 100% see us revisit in this game

3195
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
In a membership stream

3196
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I don't like replaying games that I may have already done before

3197
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
But thank you

3198
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
So so much for that

3199
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Fantastic experience on this game

3200
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Another 10 out of 10 game

3201
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Shout out to the developer

3202
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
That is like such a fun little odds game

3203
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
So goofy

3204
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Incredibly entertaining

3205
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And the graphics

3206
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
As well as the design

3207
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Visual design is absolutely

3208
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Beautiful

3209
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Some people might not enjoy

3210
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
The poly

3211
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Looking art

3212
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Art style is the word I'm looking for

3213
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
The art style

3214
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Right

3215
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
We are going to redirect

3216
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Into none other

3217
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Than she be cotton bum

3218
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
For her

3219
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Psycam

3220
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Membership monetization celebration

3221
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Wherever the Frick Frick didle-a-dack

3222
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Tic-tac-patty-whack-nick-nack

3223
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I am going to make sure

3224
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I am redirecting into her

3225
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
But that was fantastic

3226
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
In that game with me

3227
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
That was so good

3228
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
We will definitely hangman this game at a later date

3229
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Because

3230
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Gosh golly gee

3231
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
That was just amazing

3232
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
We finally started

3233
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
It started to click at the end

3234
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I need to redirect into Sheepsters

3235
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Cause that didn't work properly

3236
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Thank god I checked that

3237
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000

Yes thank you so so much

3239
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000

02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
For an ASMR stream at the regular

3243
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Time and then 15 minutes later

3244
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I will swap all my equipment

3245
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Back over to my regular streaming equipment

3246
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And we will have a membership

3247
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Watch along of transformers

3248
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
And don't be greedy

3249
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000

3250
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
