1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
I got the echo effect on, be honest right now. I like to sound like I got the echo effect on.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,480
Oh my god, oh that was supposed to be a censor.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,640
All right hold on, I'll down, I'll down, I'll down. I need to get my live chat.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
Oh I haven't even got freaking stream elements up in case someone do knows. Hold on, start

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:36,000
that. I'm sorry, I apologize to anyone who does not like real body parts or immersion

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,720
bros as you all know. Oh I can hear myself. Oh get that, close that stream right now.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,840
Hold on, hold on, let me cook, let me cook, let me cook. I'll get you up to date, I just need to.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm so upset, I'm not. Just to see, just so you know, I couldn't get to your freaking thing to work

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,720
so I had to draw it on a piece of paper. So it's literally on a piece of paper. This says,

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,600
oh my god, I get it now. And then this one says, I got lotion on my tinnacle, I got lotion on my,

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,800
mm-hmm. And then this one is just neutral B tier, it's a guy going, I mean, it's all right.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,440
And then this one is, it's the biggest piece of ever. And then this one says cast it into

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:39,360
Mount Doom. And this freaking webcam doesn't, oh focus, what I told it to. So yeah, it's been,

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
it's been a bit of a nightmare to get here but Ken, what we're here now. So let me, let me just

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,400
check. Okay, I can officially see tips. So if you would like to tip, I will see it. And I can

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,440
actually read it out. Oh my freaking mouth, there's an calibrated hold on, let me, let me enolize.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,080
Okay, much better calibration. Okay, the Gura sensor, true. It's big fish, look,

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,200
so I got Gura. And then, and then look who I got, look who I got, you ready for this?

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:22,400
Who's this? It's Pyro Pops. It's Cinder's plushie of Pyro Pops. And look, it, you came in a little

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:31,520
color. Look, look at that little adorable little Pyro Pops. And look, it's even got the hurt ears

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,920
and everything in the design. And then this one, are you ready? Let me reach, big reach,

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:48,320
big heel reach. Look, it's strawberry, darling straw. You know, darling straw, this is her mascot.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,040
Got a little bowl, and got a little butt. Sorry, a bunch of the webcam's rubbish,

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,720
but it's probably, oh, it's glitching. But yeah, look, I got Pyro Pops and a straw,

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,880
plushie, and I got Gura, and I got a few other things on the way, but they're not here yet,

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,360
it's totally not over market. Check out the link in the description for the merch down below.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,480
Your nails are so shiny, right? Right, right, before we get into the actual taste testing,

28
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,280
do you know how they freaking destroyed my toe? So if you didn't know, when you get a manicure

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,360
and a pedicure, you have to get cut around here. They like cut all your skin away here, right?

30
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,360
They cut into me, and this one doesn't have like all this on it. So I just, yeah, I got manicure

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,600
and a pedicure. I'm not beating the sweaty feet allegations because I don't know if you can hear

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,760
this, but yeah, like the paper's lifting with my feet. But yeah, I got manicure and a pedicure

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,600
for the monetization stream. However, it's not going to stop me. I mean, look at,

34
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm a real girl now, huh? I'm so feminine. I'm so feminine. You're going to be eating

35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,760
with your feet on the table. You sure you want to stick your feet on it? What are you talking about?

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,240
Okay, let's, let's get into the first thing. We are going to be trying there.

37
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,040
Okay. So basically, I have to manually freaking draw what tear I'm putting I am in as well. Like,

38
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,280
it's just, it is what it is. So we're going to try a little Nerdy's. Anyone else? I don't find

39
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,200
it nerd. It says pill tab here. I'm pulling and I'm ripping the box apart. It's not looking good.

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,720
It says one and two on the side. Oh no, it's a logic puzzle we're feeling. It literally says,

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,480
where's the webcam? Oh, focus on this is terrible. It says, okay, we can't even, it's a puzzle.

42
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Okay, there we go. We're in. We're in. Yep, this is how you're supposed to do it. Oh,

43
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,960
there's two different colors. Oops. Wait, what's, okay, hold on. Let's just take

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,240
our part. You know, oh my God. Okay, okay. Okay, there's two little sections. We have two

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,960
clores. Choose your clore, any clore. Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna have pink.

46
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,320
Oh, oh, that's sweet. It's purple, the same flavor.

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Oh, that's so sweet. It's almost sour. Oh, is this supposed to be sour?

48
00:05:49,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Grape and strawberry. Okay. Um, oh, uh, grape is not for me at all. I will allow, I will allow,

49
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,360
um, uh, I'm gonna put it in a, I mean, it's all right. Hold on, we're like manually,

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
I don't know. Now everyone knows I can't draw straight balls. Okay, what do nerds look like?

51
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,320
I mean, it's all right. And then the packaging is pink and purple, but I don't have a pink and

52
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,480
purple pencil. Yeah, the grape flavor is very diverse. Yeah, strawberry is my preferred over

53
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,520
grape. Yeah, I'm definitely strawberry gang, straw, straw. Draw the little guys. Oh, they have like

54
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:49,040
a schnozer. Okay, hold on. And then they're butt and then their feet. And then their eyeballs.

55
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,400
And then their little happy face. What do we think? What do we think of my nerds?

56
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:10,400
That wasn't too bad. I love it. Oh, you want to see, you want to see the, oh, right. Okay, hold on.

57
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,680
There's like so much I wanted to show in this stream, like so, so much. I was originally gonna wear

58
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,240
this outfit for you guys, but then I was like, oh, I can't because YouTube is reviewing my channel.

59
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,120
But I got, so if you didn't know, the white on my outfit is pearlescent, like it's rainbow-esque.

60
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay, it's pearlescent. So I got that. And then this is like, this is what the white on my costume

61
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,240
is. It's pearlescent. I don't even see it that well. I don't wear it. Be careful, American

62
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
sweets are super sugary. I'm not gonna eat like, eat, eat everything. But you know what I'm gonna

63
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:57,920
wash it down with? A fucking can of, oh no. Little, little ASMR moment. This is what,

64
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
I'm sorry if you don't like hand sticks. I'm afraid I have hand sticks.

65
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,320
With all my might as I shake car battery juice, the national drink of Scotland, Scotland is the

66
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:22,160
only country in the whole wide world, the whole wide world that has number one sales, not cola.

67
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
So cheers, come pie.

68
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,960
Insert bagpipe noises here. That's so good. I've not had that in ages. Right, let me put it down.

69
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,880
The reason why we're sipping into the iron brewers, I put it on the table over there because I'm

70
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:50,800
gonna knock it off. We have two drinks to try from America. Oh, if you have a can on your desk,

71
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,080
that's 355 milliliters, also known as 12 fluid ounces. This is what my hand looks like holding it.

72
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,480
My fingies don't even get like up there. I'm getting a lot of condensation though.

73
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:14,720
We're gonna try cream, soda, A and W as the condensation. Okay, ready. We're gonna try the

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,840
drinks first. Oh my, oh such a girl. This is not hand sweat before anyone starts making fun.

75
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay, you guys, come pie.

76
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
Yes, that is a drink. Okay.

77
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,640
It's not, I mean, it's not right. It's not that, it's actually not that bad. I wouldn't reach for it.

78
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
Oh, I missed tips. I'm so sorry. I'm such a bad streamer. Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip,

79
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
just as a promise. I have some iron brew with me and I just had some. No idea how to describe

80
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,520
the taste, but it tastes better than it smells. Might have to get more of this going forward.

81
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Yay, thank you for the tip. Zion, thank you for the tip. When you have to be a good Christian

82
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,880
man on Sunday but cuddles the stream and you do what you have to do and chin in with some one

83
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,120
earbud while Mass is going, when can the reeflings taste the Scottish sweets? Honestly, thank you

84
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,800
for the tip. I can't believe you're in church right now. Take me to church right now. I'm putting

85
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,000
all the drinks up on this little shelf because there's a 100% chance I'm going to knock over.

86
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,240
Honestly, that wasn't that bad but I wouldn't go out my way to have it. I feel like everything's

87
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,960
going to end up being neutral. Right, what was that? That was A and W and it's like on its side

88
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:46,240
like this. A and W, like that. And then it's got like a little logo. It's like two circles.

89
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:57,600
I mean, it's alright. Okay, now we're trying American Dr Pepper. 150 calories per serving.

90
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,640
So not for the full can. Oh no, the serving size is a can. Some things do that where the

91
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:13,360
serving size is a lie. It's a false profit. Okay. Get the aroma, that's right. Get the aroma in

92
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:30,000
your palate. Yes, yes, have it. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, oh, it's going to be, you guys drink that stuff?

93
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
What is that flavor? I don't even know what the flavor is. There's something wrong with it anyway.

94
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh, I should see my head bobbing up and down. Oh, that's my head there. See that? That's that's

95
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,440
the headset, Mike, but I'm going to talk to you through that, Mike. That's moody.

96
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Dr Pepper Gaming, 23 flavors. Is that why there's 20? Oh my goodness. Right. I'm sorry to my Dr

97
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,640
Pepper fans. It's not cast it into the fires of Mint Doom. I'm more or I guess it's technically

98
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:14,720
correct. What does the front look like? A Dr Pepper. And then what's got 23 flavors? Oh my

99
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:24,080
god, 23. She's not the one she's talked to Pepper. Yeah, that, my brain was like nothing.

100
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,640
Right. Y'all want a kiss? Oh, sugar. I never thought this far ahead.

101
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh god, I never thought this far ahead. No, the packaging. I'm getting trolled. The

102
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,160
fucking thing came open. It's not open. I'm getting trolled. Hold on. I never brought a knife. I never

103
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:57,120
thought to broaden what? No, your troll. Oh, there we go. Oh my god. These are like those kisses.

104
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,080
I remember there were so many memes online that are like, oh, you should, you should what?

105
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,280
It was like, oh, ask your crush if she wants a kiss. And if she says no and rejects you,

106
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,160
just pull out a Hershey's kiss from your pocket. And then all the comments were like, oh, what?

107
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Is this a, is there a joke on the back? No, there's not. Okay, there's not a joke on the back.

108
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:30,960
It's not fortune cookie. Okay, gobble, gobble. Oh, it's hard. Wait, is it hard? Oh no, I had it

109
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:43,360
in the fridge. That's why it's hard. Why is it? I do have a napkin to remove food from my mouth

110
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,280
that I no longer wish to have in my mouth. So I do apologize if people don't like that.

111
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,960
It melts in your mouth. The cocoa percentage is a bit better.

112
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:09,200
I think I can swallow it. Oh, that's better. Oh, I'm fine. I'm chewing through it.

113
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:22,880
It stuck to my teeth. Okay, okay. Oh, I would not have a second one. I'm so sorry. I wouldn't.

114
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,120
All right, we'll see how it ambidextrous. All right, let me just draw in the second box. Hold on.

115
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,920
Easy, easy, easy.

116
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
By the way, I got manicure and pedicure. Did you see?

117
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,680
Oh, I also know the Vietnamese strats. So Boss Lady was the one,

118
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,000
there was two ladies working on me at once. What was that? A kisses. So there was two ladies working

119
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:10,400
on me at once and it turns out it was the boss and she was telling me about her visa and she was

120
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:18,400
like, oh, I had two children so they can't kick me out and I was like, you're smart. And she was

121
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,080
like, yeah, if they want to kick me out, they have to take me to family court. And I was like,

122
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,880
she's telling me the Vietnamese strats. I'm like, you're an actual five head for that. So we're

123
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,560
having to be giggle about that. So I definitely recommend what they call, I think they're called

124
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,400
chop shop nail bars when it's just like a bunch of girls and all that. So there was two women working

125
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,480
on me and the women that was kindly working on my feet, she didn't speak any English, which is fine.

126
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,080
So we never spoke or anything, but I spoke a little bit to the owner because she was doing

127
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:59,120
the manicure. And basically, so I paid and then I went away and I got some cash out so I could

128
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,120
give them a tip. And I gave the one that didn't speak English a tip and she was like, thank you,

129
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,840
thank you. And I'm like, yeah, you worked hard. I couldn't really use a lot of words because I

130
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,920
knew she didn't understand what they meant. But she was so lovely. Honestly, they worked so hard

131
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,800
in these like nail bars. And then I gave the owner a tip as well. And because I was like, just thank

132
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,000
you for being so nice because I walked in and I was like, I need French tip manicure, pedicure. I

133
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
had don't know what it is because she was like, do you want gel? Do you want this? And I'm like,

134
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,720
I don't know what any of this means. And she was like, it's okay, I look after you and her amazing

135
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,040
accent. And it was amazing. So I had a very good time. It was really relaxing. They started

136
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,720
like massaging my feet. And I was trying so hard. Right, right. This is the truth. Okay. So they

137
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,200
massaged this bottom part of the feet. All right. But with someone touches the bottom of my feet,

138
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,880
my feet go, I start to spread my toes. So I was like, no, stop, stop. She's trying to work on my

139
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:07,920
feet. But my toes were like, so I was like trying to sell my body. I was trying to tell my body,

140
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,720
stop moving. This poor woman is trying to like massage my feet and give me a relaxed experience.

141
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,520
And all my toes want to do is go, like, no, just relax. But anyway, it was a really good

142
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,600
experience. It was really relaxing. The chair started vibrating. I started sweating as well in

143
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,480
the chair. It was like vibrating me up and down. I was like, oh, right. This is all I hear about

144
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,680
from you Americans watching right now. I don't know what summer patch kids is, but all I hear

145
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,520
about it is how good they are. It says sour, then sweet. If it's a gummy, like chewy, I love chewy

146
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:57,920
sweets. So this is actually going to go quite down well. They look adorable. These are cute ones.

147
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,600
I like the look of these. So they're chewy. This will hurt your teeth. It is gummy. They're okay.

148
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
Ready? Bottoms up.

149
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay, we had a good start, but...

150
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,000
Y'all eat this shit. Where did the flavor go? One earth? Wait, there was so much flavor

151
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
at the start and it's all gone. It tastes like nothing. It just like gels them.

152
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:45,200
Where's your flavor? Oh, it's so plain. I don't think I want to swallow this. Hold on a minute.

153
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,680
What the heck is even in here? Sugar, sugar, corn syrup, modified corn starch, contains less than

154
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,480
two percent citric acid. What the heck is the flavor in? Artificial flavors, titanium,

155
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,400
dioxide for color. There's literally nothing in it. What on earth? Wait, I'm not swallowing that.

156
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:16,640
Sorry, I don't trust it. I don't trust it. It's too suspicious. It's too suspicious. I'm sorry.

157
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,280
That tasted flavor. I'm sorry to anyone who like silver patch watermelon. You're done.

158
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,080
Your taste buds are cooked beyond belief. Nothing happened. You get the burst of sugar at the start

159
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,960
and then nothing happened. So I do apologize to silver patch kids. Right, we're just going to

160
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,280
draw this little mask out here. So he's got his little head and then he's got his wee arm out to

161
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,280
the side and he's holding the watermelon and he does this and he goes down and does this and

162
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,640
this and then he does that and then he goes like this and then he and then back to the head

163
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,360
and again the ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. And then he doesn't really have features. There we go.

164
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
Silver patch kids, I'm so sorry but nothing happened when I bit into that which is

165
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,240
rather strange. It's odd. Sweet taste, the carcinogenic that a bloody old knot. Oh speaking

166
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,360
of carcinogenics, neon blue. I got access to neon blue peeps. Now I'll tell you this.

167
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,920
What's her face? Trisha Payes is an influencer and she ate these on camera and made them look

168
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,480
like the most delicious thing ever. Wait, why are you saying no to peeps? Are they bad? But they're

169
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,760
gleaming and green and fat free. Fat free just means it's all in the sugar. They're like neon

170
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,080
blue. I don't know how to explain to you how neon blue these are but these are neon. They're horrible.

171
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:58,160
Oh no. They look so adorable. I'm eating sheepsters right now. Oh, well come with me. Am I gonna,

172
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,240
all right, vote someone if I'm gonna spit this out or not. From your guys's reactions I'm getting

173
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:18,320
nervous. But look how cute he is. He's very sticky. Oh my. I'm scared.

174
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:34,880
I think I'm gonna gag. Am I gonna gag? I'm so sorry. I'm actually quite scared of it. I'm scared

175
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:46,960
of the bunny. I'm so sorry. I think I didn't spit that out. I apologize. Okay, I got taste. I actually

176
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:55,120
don't think it's that bad but I'm genuinely scared of it. I'm scared of this. Chewing on foam kind

177
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,000
of quality. Yeah. Does it taste awful as everyone? It doesn't taste bad but I'm scared to swallow it

178
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,480
but I never tasted anything that was bad. I'm just scared. Yeah, it didn't taste bad so it's

179
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:18,560
going in. I wouldn't eat it of my own violation again. Volition, violation. So it's going into the,

180
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,280
it's not, it didn't make it here. What does it, what does the box look like? Where's the box? Oh,

181
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,080
peeps doesn't really have much of an icon. It's just kind of peeps. Volition, vial, of my own

182
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,080
violin. I would not eat this again. Peeps. And then it's just got a circle. Oh, again,

183
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,440
I messed it up and an underling. Ta-da! Oh yeah, it's all coming together. Oh, pardon me, I'm burping

184
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,040
out. Oh, I never even thought that I could throw up this stream but it's now just occurred to me

185
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,640
the likelihood of me throwing up is actually very high. Can I get a TWS check if throwing up on

186
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:03,520
streamers allowed? Yes or no? Right, going on the back, sweeps, shriek-p-d-p-p-d's. I've got Twinkie!

187
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,080
And there's literally a zombie movie that's all about the dang twangie. So please, we'll

188
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:22,400
live up to the hype of the twinkie. Yeah, please. I mean, zombie land. Oh yeah. Okay, we're doing a

189
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,080
twangie. Oh, it's all coming apart. Uh, itadakimasu!

190
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,320
Okay, a sponge cake. We can manage that. What about the filling?

191
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
I've stuck my tongue in the filling, as you can see by the evidence of the in-groove.

192
00:23:44,880 --> 00:24:00,800
Okay, I'm tasting it. It is going in the it's all right tier. Okay, it's going in the it's all

193
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,440
right tier. That's not bad. I wouldn't say that was bad. Twinkie is just sponge cake and cream.

194
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,280
It's going in the, well, anything. I actually don't know what the brand of Twinkie looks like.

195
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:23,440
And this just says hostess on it. We will create one, and then it stands for

196
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,080
two. There we go. New logo for Twinkie right there. And then we'll put it in.

197
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,560
We'll just do like the actual size. There we go. Twinkie. That's the new logo for Twinkie.

198
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,640
It'll be interesting to see how your hands keep on ticking. I've got Twizzlers, which is

199
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,880
Eric Cartman is my only exposure to Twizzlers. I'm pretty sure he was munching them in one of the

200
00:24:50,880 --> 00:25:00,560
plots. Also, I got rinsed for all of this food. It cost me 53 zollas. Oh my god, they're sticky.

201
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:11,040
Wait, they're not? Oh, there is an artificial scent that has just came from this. Oh my god,

202
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,880
it's not come from fucking hell. I actually haven't used my strength, you know? Okay, hold on.

203
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Oh my god, it's so sticky. Like, oh.

204
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,200
What is this? They're decent. It's very artificial scent has entered the room.

205
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,520
What is it? It's artificial cherry flavour?

206
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,720
Why does everything say a low fat snack that makes sugar turns into fat? Why is everything

207
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:58,080
marketed like that? It's so dumb. Oh, I'm tasting it. I'm tasting it. In my mouth,

208
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,560
those two little samples that were on my finger.

209
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,240
It's like edible scentless candle. These are sea bomb sticks. They're health candy because

210
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,280
everything in America is high fat. Big sugar. Americans believe fat is bad, but sugar is what

211
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,320
makes fat. Fat isn't bad for you. It depends on what kind of animal fat is good for you. For

212
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,640
example. Oh, everything is good for you in moderation. I'm still tasting that.

213
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,200
I don't think I would eat this of my own violin. Violin again. Okay, I'll say that. Do you guys

214
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,600
want that? I don't think I could finish it. Do you guys want to take over here and

215
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,400
you finish it for me? Yeah? Okay, there you go. All yours go. Yeah, the focus does not work on

216
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,520
this webcam very well. It's all yours. You can have it. I would... Oh, it's back again. I thought

217
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,240
I wiped it on the napkin. It's already back. Oh, you spat it out too? My pretty little baby bird.

218
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,480
I would not put that in my mouth again. No, I don't apologize to any Twizzler fans.

219
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,280
And then it says pool. Oh, I just noticed that pool and peel. Anyone else pooling right now?

220
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,720
Because I'll be peeling something back later. This joke doesn't work because I'm doing an American

221
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,360
stream and you guys get something stolen from you at birth, but let's not get into that.

222
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,480
How about some Jolly Ranchers?

223
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,000
Any Jolly Ranchers?

224
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh, jeez, you need the freaking strength to open anything. My god, do you guys

225
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,440
even get into these? Right, what clore? Choose your clore. Any clore? What are the clores? Right,

226
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,600
we've got a red, we've got a yellow, we've got an orangue. Orangue. We've got green.

227
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,880
So any other colors or clore colors?

228
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:18,240
Okay, I think there's four colors. We've got lime green, hard candy mango,

229
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:29,520
and golden pineapple and fruit punch. No way, there's no blue. Wait, I've got Jolly Ranchers

230
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,640
tropical. Is that the wrong one? Did I mess up? Wait, hold on, hold on. No, there's definitely no

231
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:47,760
blue in here. Unless my elf eyes deceive me. And the wise words of Orlando blue himself.

232
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,760
Don't bite them. Suck them. Oh yeah, you want me to suck on the sweet? Right, well I do a pool.

233
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,880
Hold on, let me, you guys can vote what flavor I try. Let me, for those of you participating at home,

234
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:13,920
please feel free to use the starter poll. What's this called? Jolly Rancher? I've spelled that

235
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:23,520
wrong, but that's fine. We've got fruit punch and it's red. We've got mango, which is orangue.

236
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:36,720
We've got yellow, which is pineapple yellow. Or last but certainly not least green, green

237
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,120
lime. For those of you playing at home, folks, feel free to go into the comment section where you

238
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:51,440
will see a poll pop up on your screen. That's right, you, the viewer, can decide if what the streamer

239
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:05,280
eats. Let's see. Oh, fruit punch red. Okay, okay. Je comprende. I just realized it's using my old

240
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:14,160
freaking description sense or red gang raise up. Okay, so someone says don't bait it, just suckle on

241
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:22,080
it. Is it suckling ASMR? I'll suckle on something in a minute. That is so red. Holy crap. That's like

242
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:30,080
red of a pencil and that's the sweet red. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky.

243
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh, very strong, very strong flavor, but let it cook, let it marinate, give it a chance.

244
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,360
Yes. That is very strong. That is very strong flavor. I'm not even going to

245
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
be getting otherwise. What the fuck? That's so fun.

246
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:16,000
Is it sour? It's just overwhelming. I think my British, my British beans, I just want bread

247
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
and butter and cheese and ham.

248
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:36,320
How fried is America's taste buds? Are your taste buds fried at all? That is so strong.

249
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:45,200
They're all fried. Yeah, I like savory flavors. This is probably the worst for me.

250
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,960
American taste buds are 99% sweet. Okay. The British can't, yeah, the British palate

251
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
definitely can't. I can't. This is very, this is too much. I can't eat this.

252
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:08,480
Mm-hmm. I feel like an old lady sucking on a hard boiled sweet. Oh, you just,

253
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,320
you just be a good wee grandson. I'm bracing myself on my chair. I'm not even going to

254
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,400
pretend otherwise. My other hand is on my chair and I'm bracing myself for these sweets.

255
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Well, if anyone else wants to take over, you're more than welcome to. I have had adequate tasting

256
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,640
and the aroma of the sweet has came through. So if anyone would like to take over, go.

257
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,840
All yours, baby. All yours because I like my fingers so they're not sticky.

258
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,200
Have a little, have a little napkin for dabbing my fingies. Meals and calls.

259
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,520
Right. That was overwhelming and I wouldn't put it back in my mouth again. I'm sorry. A lot of

260
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,280
things. I wouldn't say cast it into the fire. That's not like rejection, but I just wouldn't.

261
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:09,040
What's the logo of jolly ranchers? It's just a big J-O-L-L-Y-O and then a Ruh and then a Ruh

262
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,560
and then a N and then a C-H-E-R. It's so hard to like jump between the two. And then it says hard

263
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:24,320
candy. Okay, that's close enough. Our list so far. Do you think anything can even become

264
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,280
A-T here at this rate? I'm getting nervous. I don't, I don't think it's going to work.

265
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,880
It's not looking good. I will post this in high quality after the stream under the tweet because

266
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,400
I actually tweet for once. I just don't like Twitter. Twitter is for doing something very

267
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,920
nefarious on and then closing it 10 minutes after. We'll go that movie. Is this not in the Goonies?

268
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,960
That movie Babe Ruth. Right, because the guy wanted a baby roof.

269
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,080
We need some more, some Reese's. I never got Reese's pieces, should have. Reese's pup, Reese's pup.

270
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,760
Eat em up, eat em up, eat em up, eat em up. Reese's pup.

271
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:15,520
Oh, there's a big ass peanut bar. Thank God I'm not allergic to peanut bar. I had no idea what was

272
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,120
inside this. Thank God I don't have a nut allergy. That could have went terribly wrong.

273
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:37,280
Mmm. Honestly? Not bad. I can't believe it. I think we've done it. I think we have an A-T here.

274
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm not bad. We're even taking a double bait ladies and gentlemen. That's right.

275
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:52,320
Oh, a peanut. Just for me. We have an A-T here. Okay. I can put that on the A-T here.

276
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,120
I hope I'm not choking. I better not be. Let's see. We've got an A-T here on...

277
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,360
Who are you? Babe Ruth. Oh, maybe I'm choking a little bit. Hold on. I better not be freaking

278
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,680
allergic to peanuts. Are you joking me? Hold on. Let me get iron bro. Not like I'm broken,

279
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,760
resurrect a situation. Literally, I don't need to go to A&E. Cheers.

280
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,240
Okay. I think the peanut was getting stuck in my throat. I'm not actually allergic.

281
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,560
Oh, that is farted. Did you hear that fart? I didn't fart. The thing farted before

282
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:42,240
reducing. We did it. We have... Iron bro doubles as an epipen. True. True. Right. We've got

283
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:51,520
mate and ache. Original fruits. Chewy assorted fruit fans. I like chewy fruit. Oh, push

284
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,880
here to open. Oh my god. Oh my goodness sake. How do you push it? Oh my... Wait. Is there like

285
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,880
an outline or am I being pranked? Right. Am I being pranked? This is push to open. I'm...

286
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,880
Look at the red on my finger. Tell me I'm not pushing right now. Tell me I'm not pushing right now.

287
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,120
I'm getting freaking pranked by these. What am I supposed to do? What... Oh, I missed.

288
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,320
What am I supposed to do? Push here to open. Well, I'm bloody trying. Right. Fuck you. Honestly.

289
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,240
That's... Right. Anyway. Plore is true to plore. Oh, these are jelly beans. Oh, I'm gonna like these.

290
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Um, I'm trying. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. S tier. We've done it. We've done it. We've done it, ladies and

291
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:48,560
gentlemen. Jelly bean. We've got fruit flavor. Come on. What more do you want? Mate and ache.

292
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,960
Come on. I knew I was gonna like that. I looked at that and I knew I was gonna like that right

293
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,160
away. I mean, look at that. Look at that beautiful people. Should I just leave like little sweets

294
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:03,680
everywhere? Just a little chip. Oh, what's that? I'll try the green one. Okay, maybe not the green

295
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,080
one as an ache to your... You want the green one instead? You guys can have the green one,

296
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,320
but I'll have the other ones, okay? Mm-hmm. All right, green one didn't taste that nice.

297
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:28,480
Me singing the praise. Okay, we've got milk duds not to be confused with milk ducks. Okay,

298
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,640
don't get it twisted. It's instructions. Okay, we're going for it. Candy made with chocolate

299
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:46,400
and caramelia. Any caramelians? Oh, caramel... Wait, caramel dancing. Whoa. Wait, there's no

300
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:55,680
protective film? Like, at all? There's no protective film in the box or that the candy is in?

301
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Monca S? Shouldn't there be a protective film? Question mark? Question mark? Oh, I'm scared to

302
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,000
eat this now. I'm going to take half, okay? All right, no, I can't. There's caramel.

303
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,720
You know what the British candy called rebels is? Rebels, maybe?

304
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:38,960
Mm-hmm. I don't hate it. It's not S tier, but I think it's A. I think that's the second

305
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,360
A tier. I like that. I would eat... I would put another piece in my mouth again. See, if I wouldn't

306
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:53,280
put... Or maybe it's B tier, I don't know. A or B. I've got lotion on my tentacle, or I mean it's

307
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,280
or... I've not got lotion on my tentacle right now. Sorry. Sorry for the milk duds. Milk.

308
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,800
It's stuck on my teeth, by the way. I just want you to know. Do you guys want any? Hold on. I got

309
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:16,800
it kind of hard. There you go. It's really stuck on my teeth. Holy crap. It's really, really stuck

310
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,800
on my teeth. I think I'm just gonna have to give up chewing and just put it on the...

311
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,760
But that isn't that bad. Not a good look, LaLa. Oh, that's really stuck. Where's my water?

312
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,640
I bought a water. I bought a water. I brought a water. Hold on.

313
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,120
Need it. Oh, please don't fall on it. Please don't fall on it. Please keep it inside. It's okay.

314
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,920
Oh no, no, don't. It's fine. It's fine. I'm okay. Wait, how fast am I getting through these? I think

315
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:01,600
I've like practically already done them all. Right. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on...

316
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,480
Oh, I still got the wires twisted now. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on one of these

317
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,440
flavours of crisps because they're so overpowering, but I think it's the tackies.

318
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:23,200
I can't remember. I think the tackies I'm to finish on, so we'll try chi-o's.

319
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,200
Chicky bit of chi-o's. They are flavoured. Flame it. Please don't, please don't throw up.

320
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,720
There shouldn't be this much trap wind. I'm getting nervous. Okay, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. It's

321
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,560
fine. It's it. That was the bag farting because my hands are sweaty if you heard that. See, little

322
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:57,280
my hands are nicest. Get the flavour up that nose. Big ol' sniff it a whiff. All right, hold on.

323
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:08,960
Let us take... They're like red. Okay. Bottoms up, yeah.

324
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:22,480
Is that cheese? Is that cheese and hot? High taste?

325
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,960
I think... Is that cheese? Yeah, that's cheese. I need to do the spice. Hmm.

326
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,120
Burning my tongue a wee bit. Not like flavour burn, like actual burn.

327
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:52,160
What do we think? That's honestly... Would I eat it again? Maybe?

328
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,120
All chi-o's have cheese. It's in the name. Oh, chi-o's. Am I saying them wrong? Chi-to's. Oh,

329
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:08,720
no, it is chi-to's. Cheese-to's. No, yes. Okay, they all have cheese and I've got it.

330
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,320
Honestly, that's not that bad. That's not that bad. I think I would actually eat that again. I

331
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,320
might finish this off. Hold on. That's gonna get an A tier for me. What are they? Cheese-to's.

332
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,240
Cheese-to's. There we go. Cheese-to's.

333
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,960
Living out. Did I put down the other ones that I just tasted? Yeah. I'll put the crisps on the floor.

334
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,240
Honestly, I could be that. Right, I believe this is the last

335
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,320
sweet I have to taste test and then I could just show you stuff around my room.

336
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,640
Because Shibi doesn't go live until two minus one hour in a little bit. Okay, are we ready?

337
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:58,880
Let's, let's see what's inside. Oh, these are like red as well, like chi-to's. Oh, they've got like

338
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,480
little tiger stripes. Are they supposed to have tiger stripes on them or is mine just carcinogenic

339
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:19,600
for free? Okay, ready, steady. Oh, they're like natural rolled over.

340
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:49,600
Oh, okay. Okay, my brain has decided. What the frick is even in this?

341
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,240
Oh my gosh, it's not even in English. Ingredients.

342
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah, I, I, that is so freaking, that is overwhelming. I think that might be a

343
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,800
Mount Doom. You know that. I don't know how that's edible. I think we have two Mount Dooms.

344
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:26,880
Love the Italian accent. Yep. I'm so sorry. That's a Mount Doom. I can't, that's inedible.

345
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,600
The flavor is overwhelming. There's nothing, there's nothing. Wait, what is the front?

346
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:40,000
The packet looks like, hold on. Oh, it's just a logo, geez. Has anyone got any? What does that say?

347
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,680
I don't even know what flavor Fuego is, but.

348
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,160
My heart, I'm so sorry. That, there's so much flavor. It's like not even pleasant.

349
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:06,640
Fuego means fire in Spanish. Oh, it means hot. Okay, je comprends. Sorry to any Italian,

350
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:15,120
Italian, sorry to any, uh, Espanol, you know, Viva la Mexico. Um, I think we're done. I can't see

351
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,360
any more sweets. I don't have any more sweets. I've eaten them all. Right, what did we rate?

352
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:28,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Okay, the only one that

353
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,200
made it was a chewy jelly bean, and then a baby Ruth, which is a peanuts, and then the Cheetos,

354
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:43,440
Cheetos, hot. Oh, I just completely skipped on doing that H. Let's see if you can see a bit better.

355
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:51,040
Yeah. And then we see, is that, I think that's from the Cheetos that I was touching. Nerds is,

356
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:59,520
it's all right. A and W, uh, creaming soda. Call me a soda because I'm about to make you cream.

357
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:09,680
Twinkie with their new design logo, milk duds, uh, and then in the, this is the biggest piece of,

358
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,720
it's not really, it's just I can't eat it. The Dr Pepper, Nacropeper with the 23 flavors,

359
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:24,880
kisses. Yeah, that was an experience. What the heck does that even say? Peeps. Oh, it says

360
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,720
peeps, but I hid the pee. Peeps, I was actually scared to swallow, but I didn't actually taste

361
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:40,160
bad. This is Twizzlers, pool and peel. And then this is Jolly Rancher's Heart Candy, that was

362
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:47,920
again overwhelming. And then the D, which is the mysterious, mysterious watermelon flavor

363
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,160
that disappeared the moment you literally put it in your mouth. Like you taste the flavor,

364
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,480
the moment it enters and then it's gone. And then unfortunately, Fuego, uh, Takis, uh, are just

365
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,560
overwhelming to the point that you do not even have any taste buds by the time you've finished

366
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:10,560
actually eating any of these American snacks. Did you enjoy the poison? I absolutely did. I

367
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,960
missed half the stream, but I'm gradually making it. We've got an S tier. That's all I wanted out

368
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,360
of this. We've got an S tier. Again, if you're wondering why I'm not using an actual tier maker,

369
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,040
it's because I was too pepego, so we're doing it by hand. That's right, ladies and gentlemen,

370
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:30,720
I'm so professional. I did this by hand. Okay. Oh, your voice seems better, by the way. It is

371
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:39,200
slightly better. Um, I did have a T before stream to try and hydrate. Oh, oh wait, hold on.

372
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,840
Oh, oh, excuse me. Sorry. I just need to get that pencil one moment, please. Just need to

373
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,600
grab the pencil. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes. Okay. I've got the pencil. That's what

374
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,480
I needed it for. Oh, did I tell you I got manicure and pedicure, by the way? Oh,

375
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,960
I can show you my little tism. I don't know if I've told you this yet. So if you look

376
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,200
right here, as you'll notice, these, all these red marks, and then you'll notice right here,

377
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,080
it's because I do this all the time, all day long. I do this. I shove my feet in the ground,

378
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:26,640
I sit on my feet. So I have a perma, like little indent on my, my toe bone right here.

379
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,120
And then right here, yes, because I always do this and curl my feet up, my little, my little feet.

380
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm a toe curler, smiggle, literally smiggling out here. But yeah, that's all the food I have to

381
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,280
review. But I maybe have some fun, cool things to show you. Do you want to see the ASMR that goes

382
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,840
like it goes bloop bloop bloop? Oh my god, I didn't want to show feet. Oh, I did it

383
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,960
stuff for free, like and subscribe, by the way. But yeah, like I go, it's so pretty. This is what's

384
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:10,000
blooping in your ear when I do all my ASMRs. Like I put the, I did this, I put this on your ears

385
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,440
as well. If I put this on your ears and go, I woke up still in bed. I love you,

386
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:24,000
mummy. Your nails are so pretty. Thank you. You like that? You like that? Oh, I had a ruler. So

387
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,280
you guys, if you guys have a ruler, I got a ruler so you can, you know, if you want to measure your

388
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:40,640
hand and you can see how my hand matches up to you, you know? So if your hand from here to here,

389
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,880
okay, is, oh god, you guys do inches, don't you? Oh no, I never thought this through. What the heck

390
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:53,520
is this? That's centimeters. Oh no, this is centimeters. Oh no, I didn't think this, this part

391
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:03,440
through. Okay, so what size is your hand in centimeters chat for no particular reason? What

392
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,600
size is your hand in centimeters? Just if you ever wanted to know.

393
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,200
What the heck is a centimeter? My pronouns are USA.

394
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:27,520
Google translate centimeter. Go, go, go. Someone says 6.5 centimeters for no particular reason.

395
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:37,280
Wait, 6.5. Hold on a minute. You're, if you're 6.5 centimeters, you're here. Okay, 6.5 is here

396
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:49,360
and it's my hand. Maybe it looks nicer. Someone says 10. If you're 10 centimeters, you're here.

397
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,440
If you're 10 centimeters, this is outrageous, truly. Oh, you've got such big hands. Why has

398
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,600
everyone got such big hands? Someone says 8.5, 8.5 is here. Man, you guys got massive hands.

399
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:12,080
The width of you, someone says 21. Yeah, right, 21. This entire ruler is 15 centimeters, so I doubt

400
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:21,120
you're freaking 21. That's, that's a, we're hit, we're hit with a, if you are, so this is 15 centimeters

401
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:30,000
long. So if you're 13, your hand, your hand is 13 centimeters. We're doing this. Okay, we're doing

402
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,880
this if your hand's 13 centimeters. This one's it. So yeah, that's absolutely awful. Right, right.

403
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:52,240
So here's zero and here's 10 centimeters. You already knew it was coming. Let's go. Look at that

404
00:51:52,240 --> 00:52:00,880
manicure. Look at that manicure. Wow. So there's 10 right there. Look at my toe. Oh my god. I look

405
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:12,480
so feminine right now. Are those my toes? Are those my toes? What else do I have to show you?

406
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,360
That I'm mildly interesting. I might be doing more hand cam streams in the future.

407
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,840
Because look what I got. I got fake nails that look like me.

408
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,840
Wow, little straw nails. Oh, look at the things. These are like, oh, hold on,

409
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,680
hold on, aim bot. These are like little fake nails that you do this. You just put them on.

410
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,360
Look, I'm, oh my god, I'm strawing cuttles. She's eating with her feet. I've already ate,

411
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:46,880
mercy. I'll finish the tier rating. I'll quickly catch up. Make an acme, oh my god,

412
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:54,400
I get it now tier. I got lotion on my tentacle is baby, Ruth and Cheetos, hot. I mean, it's all

413
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,880
right. It's Nerds, A&W, Creaming Soda, Twinkie with the new logo and Mike Duds,

414
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:09,520
Milk Duds, pardon me. It's the biggest piece that is Dr Pepper. Kisses, Peeps, Twizzlers,

415
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,560
Pull & Peel, Jolly Ranchers, Hard Candy. That was overwhelming. And then cast it into the fires

416
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:21,040
of Mount Doom itself is Watermelon Catch Kids and Tacky's Fuego.

417
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,880
I'm sorry, that's my tier rating. I was like so freaking

418
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,320
thingy. I feel like Peeps is rated too high, but yeah, I'm gonna, if you don't like

419
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,640
hand cam streams, I'm sorry, but I just, I'm gonna fuck a little bit. And this is the part where you go,

420
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:52,240
ooh. But yeah. So, why else do I have that's even mildly interesting? Oh, I like collecting

421
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,520
seeds of many varieties. Would you like to see my seed collection? Oh, I don't mind showing some

422
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,880
of it. I've not added a lot of seeds recently because I've been so busy with work, but I like

423
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,120
collecting seeds. I think they're really cool. It's my seed collection. Though it's not finished

424
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,920
or labeled, I need to go back and label them all. But I have loads of seeds and I like collecting

425
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:22,160
seeds. You know, everyone's got a weird hobby. Mine's collecting seeds. But there you go. These are

426
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:31,760
all my seeds. And there we go. All these sample sizes of my seeds. I do have other bigger ones.

427
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,120
I don't grow plants because I have to rent, but one day maybe I will not have to rent and then I

428
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:44,160
can have my CDs. But those are my seeds. And they're all super cool. So the thing about seed

429
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,280
collecting is you have to make sure they're dry or else your specimen will actually mold because

430
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,320
if they don't dry, then they mold. And it's not good for obviously you don't want moldy samples.

431
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:03,440
But yeah, these are pepper seeds. And sorry it's not labeled. Australians call them capsicum,

432
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:12,880
but these are peppers. The British call them. Like again, I can tell that these are wild Irish

433
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:23,840
seeds just from I and I just collect seeds. I like them. You can see the difference in the

434
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,240
seeds as well. It's absolutely stunning seeing what nature provides. Because look in this jar,

435
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:36,800
for example, look how unbelievable. Do you see those dots? Those are entire seeds that grow into

436
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,240
big magnificent plants. And then compare them to the size of this seed. Isn't that amazing the

437
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:51,520
diversity of plant life? And the seed as well. Also, some seeds can be the vessel that they carry to

438
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:57,520
the next location for the plant to spawn. So you can get these are wind seed carriers.

439
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:08,480
Which is crazy because obviously in comparison, these are wind carriers. And then these aren't

440
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,240
wind carriers at all. They have to be taken away via animals such as birds. Like when birds feast

441
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,760
on berries and the seeds inside it and they swallow it and then they fly away and poop.

442
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,600
That's how the new plant emerges because there's no direct competition. Whereas if you get seeds

443
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,000
that have direct competition with one another, that's how you lower the odds of success. Like

444
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,720
honestly, it's beautiful and fascinating when you look into the world of seeds. And yeah,

445
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,040
I just think it's really cool. And you can get some that are so similar. See, these are both

446
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:43,120
wind carrier seeds. They both get carried by the wind. They look very similar, but there is a

447
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,920
differentiation between them. But flowers steal each other's thing. As they develop in, you know,

448
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:59,040
the rising of emergence, it's really fascinating stuff in my opinion. But it might not be that

449
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:05,680
interesting from a stream point of view. But yeah, these are my samples. So let me just put them back

450
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,800
on the shelf real quick. The fact that I actually picked one up doing that, I don't know if you can

451
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:19,040
see that. Wait, let's see, I picked one up. But yeah, those are my seed samples. I am planning on

452
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,560
getting a lot more, but it's currently winter in Australia, which means my samples are very limited.

453
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:30,800
I gather these naturally by going through spring or by going through walks and just doing that kind

454
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:39,440
of thing. Like, for example, on one of my walks, I got a chestnut. If you didn't know this is, you

455
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,680
know, those big chestnut or conkers, you might call these conkers if you're old school British.

456
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:53,760
But I also have bigger sample sizes as well in these, where I just took an entire sample of the

457
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,920
stem with the seed pods inside. I can actually take the sample out because my hands aren't too

458
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,880
sweaty. I'm not going to ruin the sample. Oh, it's not even going to come out. I don't want to break it

459
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:14,560
apart. Ah, well, those brown bits are the seed pod. And then you can see where the stem it grew from.

460
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,960
And you can actually see where the flower is budded. So if you didn't know, seeds don't form

461
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,920
until pollination occurs. And that's what flowers are for. It attracts insects to come to the flower

462
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:38,000
and merge the pollen and the stem. And it's absolutely fantastic stuff. It really is. And it

463
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,720
helps with plant variety and genetics. Like, and the fact that the seeds you can't tell, I've not

464
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:51,760
labelled this one yet, but I know what it is. This turns into a big, humongous red flower. And you

465
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,120
would never be able to guess that from the sample of the seed pods. So you have to break open these

466
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,920
seed pods in order to get access to them. These like little bits that you see coming off, those aren't

467
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,320
the seeds, those are the outside of the pod. But inside is the seed housed right now inside these.

468
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,120
So I'm not going to break those open when I put them into a sample jar, because I don't need to do that.

469
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,760
But yeah, that's one of my hobbies. So it looks like little buds. Yes, humongous. Well,

470
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:28,560
education. Did he talk me plants? Yes, the ovum. And, uh, goodness me, I've forgotten the name of

471
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:35,840
the stem. Oh, I've forgotten the name of it. But it's very important to have plant genetic variety,

472
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,520
which is why pollinators do such a fantastic job, such as bees, wasps. Yes, even wasps are

473
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:52,880
pollinators and tons of tiny little bugs, so many tiny little bugs. But to increase genetic diversity,

474
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:00,320
which gives resistance to plants perishing, that's why it's really good for all these little bugs to

475
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:09,520
mingle amongst all the flowers and all of that. Bats to pollinators? I didn't know that. But yeah,

476
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,000
I guess they can be. This is the doorbell hoax sector I'm talking about. It's just in my...

477
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,320
Well, none of the food section. We've still got an hour to ramble, but I'm not even prepared

478
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,600
anything else. I actually thought it would take a lot longer, but I kind of steamrolled that,

479
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:29,680
didn't I? I don't really have anything interesting to show. Oh, this was the toy that makes the ASMR

480
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:37,040
noise really good. But if I go like that against the ear...

481
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,400
You did speed and run at it. Yeah, fun nerd now over hobbies. Just keep rambling, please.

482
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:58,800
This is what... What could we put this as a substitute for? Huh? We wouldn't say this resembles

483
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:07,600
any body part. Would we... Take the... I actually don't have anything else interesting to show. I

484
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,320
showed everything at the start of the stream. I showed you the outfit I wanted to wear. I mean,

485
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:18,400
I could open it up if you want. I thought that... Oh, I should have hit there. Oh dear. I can't

486
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,080
believe it. I can't believe I'm not ginger. But yeah, this was the outfit I wanted to wear,

487
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,360
but then I realized I can't freaking do it because it's not the... Oh, we can even assemble it right now.

488
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,680
Come together. Yeah. There we go. See, there's one little cuttlefish ear. It's not a cat ear. I

489
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,360
don't want to hear any allegations that it's not cat ear. I'm with the Pintis. Exactly.

490
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:57,840
But yeah, if I can get it in. Oh, that won't fit. Oh no, the fabrics ruffled up.

491
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:09,600
Squishy cuttlefish plushy merch when? I don't know. Soon, maybe? If the U-Woo market sales go good,

492
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:16,080
soon. If they don't go so good, maybe not so soon. There's my cuttlefish ears. As you can see,

493
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,280
I'm shimmering like my pearlescent outfit. And then this is the bow for the bow.

494
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,480
As you can imagine, it doesn't really leave much to the imagined. I can't even figure out what way

495
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,640
this goes. Okay, that looks like I'm supposed to put... Yeah, so that's the front. And then that's

496
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:41,920
where I put my... Wait, is that the front? Oh. Oh, that's the front. Yeah. So as you can imagine,

497
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,840
there's a reason why I couldn't put this on today. But that doesn't mean we can't do it another time.

498
01:02:47,840 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm just doing the buttons at the gravitational area. Just do that, and I'm gonna assemble the

499
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,840
costume. Yeah. Okay, so that's the bottom of it. And this bit goes around my neck. So it's like I'm

500
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,440
collared. And then this, what is this? This is just extra fabric. Is this for my feet?

501
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:26,080
Is this for my feet? This can be for hands. There's no hand. It is! Hold on.

502
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,240
You know what time it is. There's no way this is for my feet, but I think it is.

503
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:45,280
Oh. Oh, that's a terror. Oh, there's no way that's for my... Yeah, that can't be for my feet because

504
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:52,400
they ain't non-six. But that won't look like a massive rubber. That's awful. No, that can't be

505
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,400
for my feet. But what would it be for? It's a dead end. It's literally a dead end inside. I think

506
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,720
it is for my feet, but obviously it's just cheap quality. Because yeah, this is not... This is my

507
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:11,120
hand in it, no. Oh my god, it looks like the Gryffindor. It looks like the Sorting Heart from

508
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:19,360
Frickin' Harry Potter. I don't know. Well, you're not twice. I'm cutting eye out. Yeah. Okay, maybe

509
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,600
it was good that I tested it out. That was not gonna work. Oh, but then I have... Oh, maybe I knew

510
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,640
it wasn't gonna work. Oh my god, past me. You've done amazing because this is what the other thing was.

511
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,640
I was gonna try it. It's supposed to be

512
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,240
pearlescent, but I guess just the top is the pearlescent charm.

513
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,040
Sleathering. You would have done well. Sleathering. Hold on. Let me just...

514
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,200
My feet are sweaty, so it means stuff gets stuck to them, which is not very pleasant. Hold on.

515
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:03,760
Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.

516
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,480
You can kind of see the toes done too.

517
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,800
I don't know. I can like see the bit that made out. I'm supposed to do like that probably.

518
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,960
Who said our god is an awesome god? Are we singing Gospels out here?

519
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:34,400
Okay, that's enough giddy-fitting. Giddy-fitting? That's not a word at all. I will do that another day

520
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,920
for this costume, although maybe it might not be a live stream and it might just have to be

521
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,840
pictures or something if you guys want to take a Donothon reward. I don't know. I still need to

522
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:51,680
figure out Donothon rewards. Azura is the first to have a Donothon at the other headquarters.

523
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,160
I need to help her coming up with some stuff because we're going to be doing lots of group

524
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:08,160
activities. Wait, I just thought that was her hand, but it was her foot. I thought I just

525
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:19,760
been on a glove now. Take me to church. Have I done... I have eaten all the American food.

526
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,680
I have nothing more interest in the show. Oh, maybe... Okay, so this was my concept that I had.

527
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,080
Give us a soul flash, but it would be so wrinkly because I have to like turn my foot up in order

528
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:41,760
to give you a soul flash. So this was my concept for an ASMR series, okay? So we could do it on

529
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,600
Pyro Pups. Well, I was going to do it on the girls mascots first if we managed to get plushies of

530
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,000
them. And it was going to be like this ASMRs for Pyro Pups only, for example. And it would be like

531
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,600
because Cinder is on fire because she's so hot type thing, I would get the microphone. So you'd

532
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,280
see the microphone. So like, hold on, I can literally give you a live example. So the microphone,

533
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,040
like it would be a hand cam type thing, but I wouldn't do it live. I would make like an actual

534
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,440
professional video out of it. And it would be like, so because Cinder's always hot, Pyro Pups need to

535
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,200
cool down because of how hot she makes them. So I would do like with a little spray bottle and I'd

536
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:29,040
go like ear to ear. And then like that was and then whatever was related to and like, I would say

537
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:34,400
some lore about Cinder like, oh, Cinder started streaming last year on this day. And since then,

538
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,440
like she's had this collection come out and she's been able to achieve this and she's done that. So

539
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,720
it'd be like ASMR for those who are in the fan base. And I teach you lore about the person. And

540
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,040
then like, I would relate to it as well and be like, because Pyro Pups are such good boys, they

541
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,280
also deserve head pat ASMR and like pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat, you know?

542
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,560
Like that. When did you do that? I've not done it, but this is my theory for like an ASMR type

543
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:07,920
series that I could do. And like, if a creator's come out with a plushie, so like again, this is

544
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,280
Darling Strobe's plushie. And I'd be like, oh, so Darling Strobe started her journey five years ago.

545
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:20,400
I think it was roughly five years ago. No, I don't think hers was as long. And like, I would just

546
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:27,760
tell Facts about the creator and I'll be like, oh, she's been making ASMR videos since 2021 or

547
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,400
something like that. And like, she's really found a good groove and she uploads like that kind of

548
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,800
thing. And then because Strobe's so cute, we would like, I would offer it a little strawberry and

549
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,280
then I would double over it and go yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. And then when I get the girls

550
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:48,640
plushies, I'll like all do like super maxed out. And then I can tell behind the scenes stuff about them.

551
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,520
And Mercy gave me permission to say this, but if I get the snippets plushie,

552
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:59,600
do you want to know what Mercy put on the end of her application that also helped strengthen

553
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,880
her application to Veiler? She put, I have autism and she went, she got in.

554
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:12,000
She put, I have autism. At the end of that application, it says, uh, is there anything you

555
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,280
want Veiler to know about you? And she goes, I have autism. And I was like, oh, and you come,

556
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,280
and you come. Gotta look after the fellow artists. So then she comes.

557
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,480
So yeah, please don't, uh, please don't think Veiler ain't gonna take a look at you because

558
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:32,880
you're autistic. Nah fam, the spearheads fucking got the combo of everything going on. So don't

559
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,280
you worry. Uh, but yeah, I was going to like do like a smart, that way everyone's plushies.

560
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:43,440
And then it also means if there's any creator that has a plushie that wants to send me it,

561
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:49,440
so I do like a, like a series on them as well. I'm more than open to it. I can get a PO box.

562
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,160
So if you are a creator without plushie that you can reach out, but obviously don't do it right

563
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,600
now because I'm not even started the fricking series. I was going to start the series off with

564
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,760
the girls plushies because like I would have to do like research on others. Obviously it's really

565
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,160
easy. I can just bomb the dns and be like, Hey, what do you want me to say? Uh, our type thing.

566
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,600
Um, whereas like for other creators like I have to do my research. Okay, I have to do my research.

567
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,640
And obviously like if it's she beats plushie, for example, this is the, this is the ASMR you're

568
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,040
getting right right on the, right on the face. I hope strobe doesn't jump in the stream. Oh my

569
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:33,600
goodness. She's going to be like, what are you doing to my plushie? Um, but yes, I can send you

570
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:43,040
but yes, um, I wanted to do it like really in character and all of that jazz. So I might do

571
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,720
a series like that. And I think the ASMR would be pretty Pog not going to lie. I think it would be

572
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:57,600
how one says a poke champ. Oh my gosh. I can't believe it. Darling strobes plushie knows how to

573
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:09,360
highland dance. Fogger is champed for years even. She's enjoying, I'm sure. Oh, well feel

574
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:18,640
strong and kill seas. Oh yeah. Not that kind of seed sample. Don't send that kind of seed sample.

575
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:27,200
That's a bio hazard for one. Did you know that swimmers can last up to 48 hours in the,

576
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:38,160
the womb? Which is why you need to be careful and wrap your willy. Don't be silly. You don't want

577
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:44,800
to pay child support. Don't give her the opportunity to leech your income. Be a child support. Don't be

578
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,160
silly. Wrap your willy. I'm just turning this into a mascot now. Well it's not my mascot, it's not

579
01:11:52,160 --> 01:12:12,880
a re-film but. Was it a Mike and Ike? Just life advice, I know. Thank you for the message

580
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:19,120
plushie. I know Darling strobes plushie. I've completely forgotten. The fan base evades me,

581
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:25,440
the name of her fan base. Her darlings? Possibly? Very plausible, it could be her darlings.

582
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:31,520
But yeah, I know Senders is pyro pop. I could definitely do that series once we, oh my god,

583
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:40,080
what happens if they kissed? Oh this is boy slumber parties versus girl slumber parties.

584
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:52,640
I've not really been such a child. I've not like had a chance to actually play with toys

585
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,000
many a year. I'm sure that's not a surprise to anyone. But yeah, this is so cute and like

586
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,600
how much detail. Also, I didn't know this. When you order for makeshift, it literally tells you

587
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,960
like how lucky your batch is. Like Hellhound, I don't know if you can read that, hold on.

588
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,320
It says, oh hold on, where's camera? Hold on, find camera, find camera, come on, you can do it.

589
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:23,360
Hellhound, Wolf plushie by Cinder. Only 697 made, but it doesn't give me my number I don't think.

590
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:32,560
Just says it's official merch. Oh wait, what? Okay, they're called, if you're a darling strobe,

591
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:42,080
you are a Snickers? Like the bar? And you've only got 294. There's only 294 of these made and I have

592
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:49,360
one. So yeah, I was hoping to do an ASMR series like that. So it's kind of like ASMR and VTuber

593
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,200
orientated, which I thought was really cool because I don't think I've seen anyone do that before.

594
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:07,600
That's what her mascot is called, we're learning. But yes, I am hoping to be a cheeky cheeky and

595
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:15,280
possibly get the girl's plushies for their birthdays and then I can start up that series.

596
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:21,760
And it would be really cool because like I would literally open up a like form and other VTubers

597
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,880
if they wanted to be a part of the series, literally all they have to do is send me their

598
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,080
mascot, like a plushie of their mascot and I'll do the rest of the cooking. And I would think it

599
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,840
was like a cool way to get like more VTubers like involved and it's a way that I can kind of interact

600
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,920
with VTubers because I get like, not nervous, but I don't like reaching out because I'm a dirty dirty,

601
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,360
whereas I don't know if the girl is and I'd rather not like force that barrier. Like the barriers

602
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:56,080
being crossed between like Yumi Plus, like they're all super cool, honestly. Like I feel comfortable

603
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:05,200
with Yumi Plus and all that and the VNU girls, I'm all comfy because of all that jails. But yeah,

604
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,960
like I don't really want to reach out to creators in case they're like, I don't want to be associated

605
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:18,480
with you. Yeah, that's cool. I get it. I need mascot plushies and Fumos. What's Fumos?

606
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:26,240
Yumi Plus has been awesome so far. They have. They have. I would like the format and it would be

607
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:32,400
really cute. Yeah, like kind of like just like a little rundown on your mascot and all that jazz.

608
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:45,760
Just as a warning to the harem in T-minus 40 minutes, your supreme is live. Did you guys like

609
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:53,200
my hypnosis yesterday? Yeah. I didn't really expect to do any of that, but that was a very good

610
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:58,720
suggestion. I loved it. Oh, wait, sorry. Do you guys want to, if we're just talking, if we're just

611
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:04,640
talking, hold on. Let me just, if we're just talking away. Yes. Oh, yes. Kiss my feet.

612
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,600
You can literally see where I've been pushing in on my toe there. I do this all day, every day,

613
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:23,440
all day long. If I sit on my feet and all that jazz. Yes. This is my finished tier list. Let's

614
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:28,960
just, sorry, let me just point out the different sections of the, excuse me, excuse me, coming

615
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:36,480
through. So this right here, if you can point it correctly, so this is the S tier, which was

616
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:44,400
this is the A tier. Oh, no, it was Mike and I. Pardon me. Then the A tier, which is, I can't even

617
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:50,640
read my writing from here. Baby Ruth. And then the Cheerios, the Cheetos, not the Cheerios,

618
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:58,240
that's actually British food. And then for B tier, nerds. Do you guys, do you guys even have the

619
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:04,160
ability to do this with your feet or is this like, like, I literally have full ambidextory?

620
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,520
Like, I can literally have full ambidextory with my, my grippers.

621
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:22,480
Oh, shit. What happened? Oh, did something break? Oh, no, I didn't. I thought it did.

622
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,120
Okay, it's all good. Yeah, you can do that. Yeah. But can you write, hold on, wait,

623
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,400
can I write the refling's name? Hold on. Hold on. Let's see if I can write your names.

624
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,360
Well, I'm going to write refling, not your names in particular, but that could be a really funny

625
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:44,240
stream if you really wanted that. Hold on. Okay, it needs to be a bit longer. Hold on.

626
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:48,880
If you, if you weren't here at the start, the lady cut my toe so I actually don't have any,

627
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,320
a little harder than I thought. Right, R. Oh, that didn't even, oh, that's not even,

628
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,640
okay, there's the start.

629
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:08,160
And he used all my brain. Okay, hold on. It may actually be easier if I do this. Hold on. Hold

630
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,520
on. Hold on. I got this. Let me click. Let me click. I know you can't see the angle. Let me,

631
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,960
oh, it's not going down. This is terrible, honestly. Signed feet merch win, honestly.

632
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:25,200
Right. Oh, we're getting there. Oh, that's such a good R. I'm not even kidding.

633
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,960
Okay, that was an interesting E. That was an interesting E. Let him cook, let him cook.

634
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,880
Okay, that's the same problem with that E, but don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

635
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:43,840
Don't worry. Up, up, and then down again. Yes, yes, and then an I.

636
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:54,960
And then up again, up again, gently, gently. And then an N. Okay, so down and then along. Okay, so

637
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:01,680
on the paper. Yep, and then up a little bit. Yep, and then along. Oh, and then down. Oh,

638
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:10,960
and then a G with all my might. Oh, and down. One big down, one big swoop, one big swoop.

639
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,520
There we go. Every flu. Oh, wait, we need to do the dot on the I. Hold on. Right about here.

640
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,360
Okay, there we go. Hey, replay.

641
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:33,600
I don't even know how I did that, honestly. Ta-da! Look, R-E-E. Wait, I didn't do the F on the...

642
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:44,240
That's about your name wrong. I did. That's about retelling. Wait, R-E-E-F. I forgot the F. Hold on,

643
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,080
I forgot the F. Let me try again. Let me try again. I was getting really distracted, but okay.

644
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:55,600
Okay, we need to just... Oh, hold on. Okay, hold on. You just hold that tight. Froggy likes that bad boy.

645
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:02,080
So do the F, and then it's got to be a flick at the back. And then, and... Oh, there we go. Oh!

646
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:10,160
Tell me that isn't like neat. I literally just drew cursive with my feet. Please clap, seriously.

647
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,920
I just drew cursive with my feet. Reefling. You can see that clear as day.

648
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:22,640
It is so good. Recovered F in the chat, which was right. I can't believe I did that. There we go.

649
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:28,240
That is amazing. I've got so much skill. I do. I've got so much skill in my little toes.

650
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:39,120
I was actually putting insert golf clap. Yes. But yes. That's me goofing around. That's all my

651
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:45,440
ideas. Oh, you can see my headset again. Oh my gosh, I am a real... I can't believe it. My immersion

652
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,560
is gone. It's out the window. I do not... I actually think for some reason my feet will probably be

653
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:56,160
better right in with my right foot instead of my left. I feel like if I wrote with my left foot,

654
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:00,160
you wouldn't actually be able to see any... Oh, I just dropped the pencil. Hold on. I'm just gonna

655
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:08,240
pick it up with my toes because I'm so... See, this is left foot right, and I'm not sure it's gonna work.

656
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,840
Oh, no, it's not gonna... Uh-oh. I don't see. No, you're not even gonna be able to see it.

657
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,400
Oh, jeez. No, that actually hurts to write on the left foot for some reason.

658
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:28,560
There, that's my R on my left. It's so good. If you can do this, what else can you do?

659
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,200
I don't know. Where's the ruler? Hold on. Where's the ruler? Where'd it go? Oh, there's a

660
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:45,760
sample here. Let me take a little sample at why not. These are called bendies. These are...

661
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,000
They actually use hook seat technology. I think there's four ways of seat dispersal,

662
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,720
and these bendies are called hook. They hook to the fur of the animal who's been near the plant.

663
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:04,560
Uh, don't be afraid to... Don't be afraid to focus in on the seed. Come on.

664
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:11,600
Oh, well, I try. They've got little hooks on them. It's pretty impressive, honestly.

665
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,000
Anyway, that's just me and my obsession with the seeds. What about you? What's your weird collection?

666
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,680
Look at the mess I've made. There's just chaos on this desk, right? I'm not even kidding. Let me just...

667
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:38,160
Like a huckleberry. Write in a feet script with feet as well. What, you want me to type on the

668
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:45,040
keyboard next? I mean, I could. You guys are going to see my gamer keyboard. You want to see my

669
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,080
gamer keyboard? It lights up. Hold on. Let me put the book on the floor. Our tier list is out the window.

670
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:57,200
Uh, excuse me, Giro. I'm afraid due to the nature of the medical emergency, you're gonna have to go up there.

671
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,080
Oh, no. Is the wire pulling? Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I don't think... I can't

672
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,480
pull the wire any further, I don't think, and I can't really remove the webcam because of the way I've

673
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:15,760
set this up. Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I've literally have chat open. What do you

674
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:23,760
want me to type? You want me to type PogChamp, right? Okay. Oh, I missed. Hold on. I think I'm

675
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:41,440
missing everything. Oh, shit. That did not work at all. That did not work at all. I thought I nailed

676
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:50,240
that. I'm not gonna lie. I thought I nailed that. I did not at all nail that. Like, not even close.

677
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:58,880
Not even close. Okay, give me another word that's short to try. I'll like really try hard it, okay?

678
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:06,080
The gripper. Literally, oh, you can't see it, but I like do this on the end of the table.

679
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:12,560
What do you want? You want cuttles, right? Really try hard. Okay, I can't even see it. Okay.

680
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,920
I can tell I'm like inputting so much other stuff.

681
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:30,560
Did that work? Did I miss? I did it! I freaking did it! Let's go, baby.

682
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,160
Just like that. Honestly, give yourself some practice on something new. If you've never

683
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:44,720
typed with your toes before, all it takes is a second chance and you nail it, apparently.

684
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,680
Oh, yeah. This is my keyboard and this is my mouse mat. Can you tell who's on the mouse mat based

685
01:24:51,680 --> 01:25:00,800
on the hair? I ain't clean it, but it's, it's Jinx from, from the hit TV show, Arcade,

686
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:07,120
or League of Legends if you play League, but I like Jinx. It is Jinx. God, you guys are really

687
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:13,520
good at that. What the heck? No, I don't think there's anything else I can show really. Yeah,

688
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:21,200
maybe although, you know, look, look, it's the, the thingy. This is, so I bought the technology

689
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:27,600
that lets me do all this, but I never use any of it because I'm a bad VTuber. I'm a naughty VTuber.

690
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,560
This is what I'm supposed to do like mid-game. I'm supposed to be like,

691
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:40,240
let me change real quick, but yeah, it's not happening with me. Sorry, but I ain't not good,

692
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:46,000
but this is like how I control my hypnosis. So have you never seen like the behind the scenes

693
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,720
on a VTuber? This is what it looks like. This is what I'm supposed to do, but I never do it.

694
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:59,840
I've got a bikini toggle. Well, let's not do that. Oh, that's a tipper. I will hold you in

695
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,840
my hand. What did you say? Is Brian talking? I don't think Brian's talking right now.

696
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,120
There's no Brian in the stream. I don't know why. Oh, oh, I missed another tip from a random

697
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:18,960
refling, some random refling tip that said, I heart feet, narrow tip. Thank you for the tip,

698
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,920
said feet dexterity level 100. Just unlocked literally a little bit of a, but yeah, if you've

699
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,720
never like seen the behind the scenes of a VTuber before, like I'm happy to show like, I don't

700
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:34,800
mind. Like, you know how I always complain about calibration? This is why, this is why I calibrate

701
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:41,040
to and like, there's my spit pile. Look, this is very spit out all my stuff. Look, there's my half

702
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:48,000
chewed up foods, half twizzler. That's the caramel one. That's my peep. Yeah. And then that's James.

703
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:55,360
Hi, James. Hi, hi. But yeah, I don't really mind showing the behind the scenes of it.

704
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:03,120
It's just, just what it is. I don't bother me. No. So yeah, this is when I'm taken. I'm like, oh,

705
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:11,360
yeah. Oh, yeah, I took that. So good. Oh, my freaking, my preview of my live stream just died.

706
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:20,160
And I thought I just died, but I didn't. Indirect kiss on the food. Do we have the same desk? I

707
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:27,520
built this desk myself. I needed a really wide streaming desk and it costs like $400 to get it.

708
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:33,760
So I bought wood and I painted it and then I attached legs. So it's an extra wide desk. It's

709
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:43,520
like super wide, super wide, super wide. This is literally just turning into a handcam stream,

710
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,880
right? What game, what game we playing? You know the streamers that like only show their hands?

711
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:57,600
Oh, also, let's play also. Oh, oh, oh, let's get it. Actually, you paint wood, that could look

712
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,680
but yeah, she could build as furniture with a perfect way she'd be

713
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,240
playing the Binding of Isaac. Oh, my gosh, should we?

714
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,360
Yeah, maybe, maybe I should maybe not make the focus on the keyboard of this stream.

715
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,520
You know, let me just move that back over there. You go over there. There you go.

716
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,400
Oh, it's bumping on something. It's not. Oh, I broke the legs on this keyboard.

717
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:35,360
Do you feel in? See, funny you mentioned in a full Elden Ring placer with feet. I was actually

718
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,760
going to do a foot cam stream to show how much I don't have my feet on the ground. I'm currently

719
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:46,640
sitting on my feet yet again. And I thought it would be funny to play a game where I show feet,

720
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,640
because like when I get stressed, my feet also go like that with my toes. Like I have a lot of

721
01:28:50,640 --> 01:29:01,680
emotion in my feet. Maybe. Oh, I do have something to show you. I can do this. It's a special shoutout.

722
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:07,760
I'm allowed to do it. So the artist is, I can't freaking, I need my glasses on so badly right

723
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:16,400
now, is LinkedIn Art. And I can also say this before anyone cries. I also say special thank you

724
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:24,880
to Dapper Bucket who commissioned the artwork. But for next week's streams, I have Elden Roll,

725
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:31,600
Elden Roll, nice enough. No, I have Elder Scrolls, Skyrim part one and part two. There's

726
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,840
are two back-to-back endurance streams for full achievements. We're going to get them together.

727
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,920
Hopefully I can do it on Xbox Game Pass and then we can get our first 1000-gamer score.

728
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:46,880
If not, then we'll play Vanilla. Then we have our classic ASMR stream which will be short.

729
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:56,800
And then we have the first indulge gen-mate stream. All six of us are going to be on Power

730
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:02,080
Watch Simulator and there's going to be a little plot line to go along with it, okay? You're not

731
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:07,840
ready for what that plot line is. But there'll be a reason why we're playing that game as our first

732
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:16,560
gen-mate thing. And then I am jumping back on Old School Runescape to beg you guys to give me

733
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:24,960
fish again. And then we're playing Crash Bandicoot Warped which is an old childhood game. I only

734
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,240
remember playing the China Mission when you're a cocoa and you ride the tiger. I used to play

735
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:35,840
over and over again. And I actually don't remember finishing the game or what it's about. I just

736
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,160
remember cocoa. So we're going to be playing that. And then Buckshot Roulette is my tiny, tiny stream.

737
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:50,080
I am aware that Buckshot Roulette is a very short game. So I might just do a foot cam stream if my

738
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:56,080
toes look good, if they don't. When are we getting a cavio play through? Not yet, but soon to end.

739
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:03,760
But yes, there are three Endurance streams which are the Elden Rings and Old School Runescape.

740
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,840
Crash Bandicoot, I believe, can be finished in eight hours. So it's technically not an

741
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:15,760
Endurance. That's just the average Joe's work shift. So Buckshot Roulette can be pretty fun if

742
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:23,440
you go for high scores. Okay, I've never played before. Someone says Veeler running out of funds

743
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,080
in the first month so the girls banded together to open a sexy power wash car company. You know what?

744
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,320
If you're just going to guess what the freaking plot was that I was going to make,

745
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:40,000
at least don't guess it correctly. You've ruined it now. You've ruined the collab. How dare you?

746
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,840
The whole point of that collab and the reason I picked that game first, I was going to start the

747
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,880
game with all of them lined up and I was going to be so serious. And I was going to be like,

748
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,640
look guys, the income that Veeler are making is not looking good. We're going to have to open up a

749
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:01,840
side business and we're going to call ourselves like the e-girl washers or something like that.

750
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,080
If you're going to guess it, don't you brand it. You brand the whole reason we're going to play that

751
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:13,920
game. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? But only the reeflings that are in here are going

752
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,280
to know you're only you guys are going to know. You're going to know the secrets. But yeah, Buckshot

753
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,840
Roulette is going to be teeny tiny. I might add feet cam just to spice it up a bit and you guys

754
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:29,840
can tell me off every time I sit on my feet as I currently sit on my feet. Crash Bandicoot,

755
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:36,000
eight hour old school, endurance 12-ish roughly. My voice can keep up. Power wash, super short.

756
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,960
I don't know if I'll do a pop-up stream. It's plausible. It's very plausible. I might do a

757
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,160
pop-up short stream. I don't, I'm not going to ask for more than two hours from the girls

758
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:54,160
collab wise. I don't want to like force them to, you know, do that kind of stuff because they're

759
01:32:54,160 --> 01:33:01,280
probably a busy one to do their own thing. Keep your feet on the ground. Literally, I can't help

760
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:06,240
it. Look how red my feet get. I don't know if you can tell but they're all red here because I've been

761
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:13,920
like doing that again. I can't, oh, oh, oh wow. Okay. All right. Just got a little sensor thing

762
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,760
going on that it do excuse me. Hold on a minute. Just, oh yeah. Yeah, you like that.

763
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,960
Look at that. Empty. It's true.

764
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:32,800
We love the story. There's a bandaid on one of them because unfortunately the nice lady that

765
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:39,520
was working on my feet cut it open by accident. If you didn't know, when they prepare your toes,

766
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:45,520
they literally take out these clippy caliber things and clip away the skin around your toe

767
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:51,760
and I started bleeding. So I said, it's okay, don't worry, but please don't do anything to it.

768
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,640
There's no point in putting this on it whilst I'm bleeding out. So I just said do, no, everything

769
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:02,320
else. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, it's terrifying. Well, I've heard some horror stories about people

770
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:10,160
like freaking losing their feet because of like chop, chop. So I'm probably not going to get this

771
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:16,480
done often. I do have what's called gel on it. If anyone is so inclined to know what this is called,

772
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:23,120
these are called gel and she literally baked my fingers. She put them under a UV light. So if I

773
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:30,640
get like any skin issues, it's because she baked my freaking fingers like to activate the gel.

774
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:35,120
You're supposed to go back to the place to get it removed, but I think I'm just going to grow it

775
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:40,800
out because I don't want any more chemicals like it was the smell of the chemicals that they were

776
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:48,560
using on my nails was very, it was rather pungent. It was rather pungent and I really do not

777
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,240
feel like any more chemicals after eating all those American sweets. I do apologize. I've had

778
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,760
enough chemicals for one day or for one week. So I'm just going to grow these out naturally. It's

779
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:05,520
probably going to look really bad. Oh, I've got 10 out of 10. Don't remove the gel at home. It's very

780
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,680
dangerous. Yeah, I was just going to let them grow out and cut it off. I assume it's fine to

781
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:14,160
let it grow out and cut it off because I'm not really going to be doing. Hopefully I'll get

782
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:19,440
monetization soon because the whole point of me getting this was to do a monetization stream

783
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:26,320
that's similar to this, but a bit different. That's right. I thought ahead enough to make it

784
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,720
similar, but different. Oh wait, similar, but different.

785
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,680
But yes, I love this. Are you squiddin' me right now? Oh, I heard that. Love all the streams

786
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:46,720
so far. So glad you're back. You and all your gen mates are on point. 10 tenths. I heard that.

787
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:54,240
Did you guys hear that as well? You did. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Eternity. What a name.

788
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:02,800
Eternity. Thank you for such kind words. Yeah, me and my gen mates are amazing. Oh,

789
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,360
also, this is how I make jokes. Right, someone quickly give me a joke that I can steal. Quick,

790
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,880
quick, quick, because this is what I do when I steal your jokes. Okay? That's what I do when I

791
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,800
steal your jokes. Brian's back. We did miss Brian, but thank you very much for the tip again,

792
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:27,840
Eternity. Eternity. A man walked into a bar. You think he would have seen it?

793
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:30,960
Wait, did that play?

794
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,880
Wait, it didn't play?

795
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:51,360
Okay, I don't think it's working right now. Something's not quite right. Something's not quite

796
01:36:51,360 --> 01:37:00,240
set up. I'm not sure why. Okay, just imagine this one goes, and then this one, if it's a good joke,

797
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:08,320
then this one, if it's a bad joke, and then this one, if crickets. Okay? I don't know why. Sometimes

798
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,720
something's working. Sometimes other times it doesn't work. Oh, sugar. I'm going to make sure

799
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:18,880
I'm redirecting into Sheevee. Oh my god. Oh my god, you can see me typing. Oh my god, wait, hold on.

800
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:26,320
Is it cool? Like when you can see streamers' hands. Hello, reflings. How, oh, I'm getting embarrassed.

801
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:37,920
Is it going? And then that's right. I'm taping and streaming live. What are you going to do about it?

802
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,440
Nothing.

803
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,440
No, not really.

804
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:58,000
You're so silly. You're so goofy. Oh, that was right. You're so goofy. Are you challenging me?

805
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,920
I don't know how you learn how to tape in school, but in primary school, you had to do this. Like,

806
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:11,280
at first as a child, you do this, but then they teach you, like each hand takes over a certain

807
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:17,920
section, so you're just like, blah, blah, blah. Do you watch keyboard when typing? Right, this is me

808
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:24,320
not looking. The only way I can prove it is by looking up with my Vtuber model. Like, oh, okay.

809
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:29,600
Let me just get the star position. I am, oh, I pressed caps lock. Sorry. Wait, no, I didn't. Hold

810
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:39,440
on. Sorry. Sorry. I am not looking at the keyboard right now, but that's because I'm a dirty, dirty

811
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:48,240
neat that never left the house for two years. So I am kind of used to typing a lot. Sorry,

812
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:54,080
but it's just the truth. Oh, wait, I spelled the truth wrong. Wait, wait. There we go.

813
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah. Yeah, so I can tape without having to look. I don't know what it looks like, probably.

814
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:11,840
She's just like me. My gran always gets amazed whenever I tape in front of her without having

815
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:17,600
to look. She's like, hey, do you do that, strongy? I'm just like, I don't know. We grew up with

816
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,840
technology. You grew up with like coal fires. That's like as far as your technology went,

817
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,440
a little coal fire in the corner of the house. Main or grammar mistake. I went, no,

818
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,960
do a taping restream. Wait, I can beast you guys and taping?

819
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:40,160
How do I do a taping restream? Is there like a website for it? I was going to do, I was going

820
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:54,800
to verse you guys in chess. Like 1v1 me and chess. 10 fast fingers. All right, I'll check it out.

821
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,360
10 fast fingers. You should be taping up the dev overkill. It's hilarious. Wait, chess would be

822
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:06,000
so cool. Yeah, it would be a chill stream, a long stream, snipe day. I would love to 1v1 you guys

823
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:15,440
in chess. Before you're like, are you a chess champion? Oh, no, I am not. I suck.

824
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,560
But I also swallow.

825
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,640
But yeah, we probably 1v1 in chess would be funny.

826
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:39,840
I literally, I am a chess box champion. Right, let me 100% make sure I'm raiding into

827
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:47,840
sheepsters after this stream because I am rubbish and I'll mess it up. Hold on.

828
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:56,720
Come on, YouTube. Give me monetization so I can do my pop-up stream. I'm waiting for it.

829
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:09,920
Oh, she's playing vampire of masquerade bloodline. I might need to sit and count for that stream

830
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:17,040
on ironically. I'm doing collab study. I'm actually doing collab scripts. I keep saying, oh, I'm gonna

831
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:27,520
do collab scripts, collab scripts, collab scripts. And then I never do them because I get distracted.

832
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,840
It took, and oh, there's like literally food on the back of my hand right now. Oh my god,

833
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,920
and I knew you told me, how embarrassing, there's just food on the back of my freaking hand. Do

834
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,280
you like my, do you like my meat sticks? Do you like how you can see my meat sticks?

835
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:44,400
Some people hate that, but I don't know, it's just like, can you see your meat sticks at home?

836
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,800
YouTube, please. I want to use that most honestly. I want to use them too. I've got my

837
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,840
most waiting for that meat stick. What are they called? These aren't the ligaments, what are they

838
01:41:53,840 --> 01:42:00,080
called? What are they called? What if I'm freaking name the tendons and the ligaments? Yeah, those

839
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:07,120
are my meat sticks. So hot. You like meat sticks? One potato, two potato, three potato, four.

840
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,400
Right, I have still not correctly redirected into she because you guys are distracting me.

841
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:16,560
Stop distracting me. This is terrible. I'm just going to start talking through my hands.

842
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,920
Stop distracting me. You're so naughty. Stop it. That's your end point. You're in,

843
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,800
getting closer to you. I'm getting so, you can see the chocolate on my finger again.

844
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:38,480
And there, this isn't even, get off me. Yes, you're right there. You're a terrible influence.

845
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,040
Terrible.

846
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:52,240
Did you lick my finger? Refling, you just lick my finger. You're terrible.

847
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,640
But yeah, this, this is my hand. I do apologize to those who,

848
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:02,480
get filler, get filler, get filler. Don't enjoy when a YouTuber has hands, but

849
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:08,640
I don't know what to tell you. Like I also got the, got the feet toes up. Look at that spread. Look

850
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:15,760
at that spread. Why does, why does that toe, my pinky toe does not come out very much.

851
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:26,560
Spread. Whoa, my pinky toe. Hold on a minute. Whoa. Wait, wait, why does my pinky toe not spread?

852
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,280
Whoa, wait, when I go to spread my toes, my pinky doesn't.

853
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,400
Ah, it like so crooked.

854
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,240
There you go. I, I must ask you a question.

855
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:47,760
Why is this one like having the time of its life over here? Holy crap.

856
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:53,440
Could you imagine the grip strength I would have on you? Where's the ruler?

857
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:58,320
I'll repeat my, imagine the grip strength. I'll snap it in half in between these toes.

858
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,760
What does that even mean? I don't know. I'm starting to lose the plot. I think the,

859
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:13,360
the American can die is getting to me. It's all, it's all the red numbers. It's the red 40.

860
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:22,240
It's going, it's getting to my head. I can't stand it. I'm being taken over. Oh, who say can, who say.

861
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,760
Red 40 strikes again. I can't believe it. I'm turning American.

862
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:34,880
I'm like leaving you. I can't believe I actually thought this was a, um,

863
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:40,800
a fortune teller thing. I was convinced there was going to be like a joke on the other side or

864
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:46,640
something. You're going crazy. I like, I can't believe it. All it took was a few American sweeties

865
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:52,960
and I'm going, the numbers. What do they mean? Right. I don't know. I don't know what you guys

866
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,520
want me to do for like these last 10 minutes. I feel, I feel a bit out of my comfort zone,

867
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,320
but not in a bad way. Just in a, I'm really unprepared. Like I thought we were going to be

868
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,520
at this for a very long time, but we're not. Do you want me to tell you what? I'll just,

869
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:13,520
I'll just caress this. There you go. Oh, little ASMR orb. Watch to do your orb, orb. I see. Yes,

870
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,800
yes. I'll just caress it. Oh wait, maybe I should get the second one so it's a bit more,

871
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:30,080
a bit more. Yes, we'll caress these. One week review of the company. You want me to review

872
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:35,520
via lure? How do I review it? Everyone's doing great. They're all having fun. I'm going to even

873
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:41,040
review it. Everything's going fine. We've got an exciting thing coming up, but I'm not allowed to

874
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:48,800
talk about it. Boom. But you know, God respect the, God respect the hustle. Spur the moment ASMR.

875
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:55,920
Employee performance report. Bro, what do you want me to say? Oh yes, all the girls literally

876
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,080
streamed every single day. What more could I ask for? Seriously? What more could I have asked for?

877
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,240
Visucky coming up. All right. Okay. You want the DLC expansion of Veila already? The Visucky DLC

878
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:18,480
to go live? Okay. Not enough burps, honestly. Lord's milk. Nice keyboard. Thanks. Thanks. Oh my

879
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:30,800
God. Wait, I can still type in chat. Thank you for being so kind about my keyboard. You're so nice.

880
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:41,520
Woo. I'm a real, I'm a real streamer. Totally not breaking a VTuber code of conduct.

881
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:48,640
I was at VTuber code of conduct 101. Don't show that you, do you see this little mark here?

882
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:57,440
That was from the toothbrush when we brushed our teeth on stream. All of the toothpaste leaked

883
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:03,680
down my toothbrush. Do you want to brush our teeth? Let's, let's brush our teeth. Oh my gosh,

884
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:08,080
that's like the perfect time to do it. Hold on. We need to go brush our teeth. We're helping.

885
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:35,600
All right. People are wondering why I mute when I leave the room. It's because the toilet is right

886
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,920
there and I really don't want to hear, like, I don't want to give you a chance to hear me,

887
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:48,000
like, do a big old, a big old job. I am not going to lie. I actually had a tick to hear you as a part

888
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,720
of this stream. And obviously the Americans have been bubbling up and help out. I'm currently using

889
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:59,440
my floor towel and I have a floor towel for how sweaty my feet are. Oh, has everyone got their

890
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:08,640
make tootie brush? Look, this is my tootie brush. It's so, so fancy. Oh, so fancy. I don't put it

891
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:14,480
on because it makes a really loud noise and I don't want your perspective to be, what we try and do

892
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,640
this thing together. I'm going to need to borrow your toothbrush. Okay.

893
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:28,080
Okay. Does it vibrate? Yeah, I like it vibrate. It's like, oh, that just put water everywhere. That

894
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:33,920
was very, oh, oh, rather silly of me about how, so I have to snap it in to put my thing into,

895
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,320
but we're just going to manually brush our teeth. Okay. So this is day two of 21, even though I've

896
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:55,360
not done it consistently. I'm brushing away the red 40. Red 40 ain't got nothing on me.

897
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:07,200
Oh, I forgot about the moment. This thing just keeps on getting fired. What do you mean? I've

898
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:17,120
been sweet and then I get, I have done. You need to get behind your teeth as well, like behind your

899
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:26,800
front teeth and behind your broken front teeth. Just after this stream, I don't want to get up. Okay,

900
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:35,040
even though after this move. Oh, yeah. We're brushing our teeth right here. Sing gangsters'

901
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:49,440
parodies. I don't actually know the words that well.

902
01:49:49,760 --> 01:50:03,840
Okay, I've gotten wet everywhere.

903
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:16,640
What's your favorite American song? Something from Green Day, probably.

904
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:26,240
Uh, I like the schizophrenia Green Day song. I can't remember how it goes.

905
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:38,720
I like the holiday. What would the schizophrenia one be? He's in the scene as well, as opposed to a

906
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:54,960
scene as well. One, two, one, go! Lay down your arms, and through the sky, one, two, one, go!

907
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,360
Oh, there's a new single out by Atadashi Gakko. Wait, hold on, I need to spit.

908
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:10,240
This is my sweaty feet towel. Would you like it? Instead, it's gonna be my toothbrush. Oh,

909
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:15,040
shit, that just went everywhere, don't it? Oh, that wasn't the objective, but hey,

910
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:22,720
oh, it's like all over me as well. I have so much spit. I don't know if you guys like salivate a

911
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:29,840
lot. Oh, it's on my desk. Oh, sorry. Oh, thankfully the camera's actually out of my hairs in the way,

912
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,960
so you don't have to look at my freaking spit on the desk, clean, twat bag. Oh, well, here you go.

913
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:43,520
Oh, yes, oh, yes, the hood reads in the first place for the... Oh, it's all over the back of

914
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:49,120
my hand as well. My god, that really actually got everywhere. Jesus. Some of us salivate a lot,

915
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:53,520
some of us don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. It's even on the keyboard, is it?

916
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:01,760
It actually is as well. I'm sorry. I get really salivated whenever something enters my mouth,

917
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:10,560
so teeth brushing with something. I've actually covered that other thing, actually. I'm sorry.

918
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:15,600
I just have to use my sleeve. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know I'm gross and minging, okay?

919
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:19,040
Look, deodorant's optional. If I'm not going outside, I'm not wearing it.

920
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,520
Oh, I should probably do that smelly thing, because all my gen mates did that smelly thing.

921
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:33,600
Okay, we are soon to read into ShoeBee in two minus seven minutes. Cease your heresy.

922
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:43,840
Would be disgusted. Look, I was raised in a barn. That's all I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

923
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,000
Hear that chat? She's self lubricating. Oh, you can't say that. You made me read that out loud.

924
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:58,560
The AFK bubble. Yeah, you like my AFK bubble? Any AFK? Yeah, give filler, give filler, give...

925
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,320
In a barn, is she, Jesus?

926
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,320
She's...

927
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:16,320
I feel like I don't have anything else interesting to show. Like, this is it. I'm not that interesting.

928
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:23,200
I'm sorry. Okay, out of raw interest and no more. Where's my pencil? I've already lost it.

929
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:30,400
Excuse me. You're gonna have to move out the way. Okay. How many?

930
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:36,240
Right. What are... Right, this is four centimeters.

931
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:47,360
Four centimeters. Okay, then we'll do the next one. This is eight centimeters for no... Oh,

932
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:52,080
you guys can't see that. Sorry, sorry. I keep forgetting the camera's like, not my eyeballs.

933
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:56,800
I know that's crazy, but the camera's not my eyeballs. This is eight centimeters long.

934
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:05,040
Oh man, I think... This is 12. This is 12. That's ridiculous. I don't know why I'm...

935
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,760
That's 12. Oh, you can't see it. It's so freaking late.

936
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:22,720
Yeah. How many pickles can you show? What's she measuring? 16.5. That's all fours.

937
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:26,160
You guys are not out here for that much, holy shit.

938
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:38,880
16.5? Shut up. I'm sorry. What? That can't be. This... This ruler is 15. I'm sorry,

939
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:49,120
I refuse to believe that. What? No way. My reflins are packing. I mean, actually, hold on.

940
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:53,440
I don't know. The marshmallow's beg to differ.

941
01:54:55,120 --> 01:55:03,200
19-0-5. No, I don't believe yours. I don't believe yours. That's outrageous. That is so much blood

942
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:16,560
flow. Like... I don't... That's... I'm still going. Like, I'm still going. There's no way. I refuse.

943
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:24,720
17! No. I'm... I'm still going. I'm claiming like a monkey with hands. There's no way. I refuse.

944
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:32,960
You guys cannot be that packed. How does that work? Don't you know, like, get lightheaded or something?

945
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,240
That is outrageous.

946
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:45,520
No. Why are we measuring our hands like this? Wink, wink. We're measuring our hands.

947
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,320
Like that.

948
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:02,160
How do you do this? 14. That seems more reasonable, but that's still a bit outrageous. I have to admit.

949
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:08,800
14 is that. That is still really...

950
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:17,520
I don't know. Hold on. I'll redo 12. I'll redo 12 so we can actually see it because I can't actually see

951
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:26,160
that with my eyeballs. Oh, why? What? Why did that not show up? I wonder because of the green undertone.

952
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:40,160
Hmm. Yeah. My goodness. Now convert that all into inches. I don't know what any of this means in inches.

953
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,920
So I love to hear you pronounce different words with your accent.

954
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:55,920
Apparently I say dual wield quite satisfactorily and strawberry is quite satisfactory and ghetto.

955
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:08,080
This girl. 2.5 centimeters is one inch. So two point... All right, hold on. Do it like this.

956
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:13,120
Do it like this. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick. So from here,

957
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:22,960
one inch, 2.5 so then that makes that two inches. 2.5. So that's three. That's two. That's one.

958
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:30,800
What does that mean? Five and then plus two is ten. It's four inches. Yeah. And then we'll

959
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:36,880
halfway. That's five. Then we'll halfway again. That's six.

960
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:44,080
Yeah, I'd say you're, you're, woohoo. Let's go. Woohoo.

961
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:51,280
You're good to go. You start. This is, this is getting painful. This is getting,

962
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:57,280
we've had enough at this stage. I will, I will teach you a very fun fact. Maybe a later date.

963
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:08,400
But as a woman, I had to go see a woman doctor and I got diagnosed with a clam. Okay, let's just call

964
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:23,520
it Tate Clam Syndrome. Okay. So this, woohoo. This, this is, oh, oh, you're hurting me. Like,

965
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:36,640
so, yeah, this is, so higher than this. Our lure. Yeah, I'll get to go.

966
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:51,120
Yeah. I mean, I don't mind. I think if we end up doing bands,

967
01:58:51,600 --> 01:59:02,560
streams, I'm happy to show you my, my figurines and I will show you why I have a certain type of

968
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:10,400
figurine from a super underground elite video game that no one's heard of. Okay. And I'll,

969
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:17,360
I'll show you why I have a certain type of figurine and I'll explain it in a lot more detail.

970
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:22,160
But apparently, none other than Shibi Cottonbump has just gone live. So we're going to end it there.

971
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:26,800
Are we happy? Are we satisfied with the hand cam? Have I done enough fan services? Everyone happy?

972
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,000
Do you have any last requests? Any last requests before I go?

973
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:42,000
Remember a game. Yes. Today is trying to stream we learned. Yeah. Ending on a high note. It was fun.

974
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,880
Yeah. Everyone happy. Thank you for stream. Okay. I did everything. I did everything. No

975
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:51,360
requests. Okay. I'm happy. Everyone happy. Peace sign and stick out your tongues model.

976
01:59:52,960 --> 02:00:01,920
I can do that. Flip me off. Yeah, you like that? See, some people, some people bring this in.

977
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:10,720
Wrong. This is wrong. It's, it's back to back L's. Okay. You need, you need to give them the L back

978
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:16,160
to back. That's how you do it. Okay. You want hand holding? How do I hold your hand?

979
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:25,520
I hold it like this. If I ever see you at a convention, it's over. This is how I'm holding

980
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,000
your hand. Oh, or like this because apparently you guys are absolutely humongous. So I'm just

981
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,040
going to hold onto your thumb. Do you just be walking around the convention?

982
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:48,560
I don't know. Got you. End with a heart. I'm, some do that, but then the fingers in the

983
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:55,600
background are in the way. So I'm, I'm all in like this. Okay. I'm all in some do this. Like it's

984
02:00:55,600 --> 02:01:00,080
supposed to be the love heart from the bomb. I don't know if you can tell, but this is supposed

985
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,200
to be the bottom of the heart. And then it goes like, Oh, well, I ran out of room there, but you

986
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:11,200
get the point. Is there any other way of hearts? Do your middle finger if you really wanted.

987
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:15,120
I'm starting to make stars and stuff up in the touch.

988
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,720
Wait, that's a heart sign. This is a heart sign. It's the bottom of the heart here. So it's supposed

989
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,920
to be like bottom of heart and then tee tee. That's a heart sign.

990
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:36,640
You can do the hand heart. I do feel, I feel, full stack. I think there's another way to do it,

991
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:46,000
but I actually don't know. I did feel stack. I thought the thumb and the finger made the heart.

992
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:52,640
Like that? What? Like that? The thumb and the finger make the heart?

993
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,520
Well, no, you guys are learning how my brain is slow. It's not looking good.

994
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:08,720
But yeah. Isn't it because the two tips of the fingers form a heart? What? What are you smoking?

995
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,960
We've made a, we've made a, we've made a diamond.

996
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:20,880
No, the one you said was a bomb. Oh, wait, this is the love heart part. And then it like crosses

997
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:27,840
over obviously because that's how fingers work. Huh. Interlocked fingers. Yeah, you like that?

998
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:36,560
Yeah, they really do it for you. Like Flappy Bird. Oh, wait, what's that thing where

999
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:42,960
you do that and then spin it? What? Wait, hold on. I'm sure there's a thing where you spin it.

1000
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:47,200
Oh, there it is. Diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy. You used to have a thing where it was like,

1001
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:54,080
oh, it's a boy. Diddy, diddy, diddy. I can't remember. Can you do a shadow pop it?

1002
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,000
Oh, wait, dogs have two eyes.

1003
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:08,800
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1004
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:18,000
Scuff dog. How else are you supposed to do it? Very big underbate. Look, he's a, he's a pug. Oh,

1005
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,680
wait. Oh, no, that's what a dog looks like.

1006
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:23,520
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1007
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:30,400
Someone says, you're Australian chat, bro, you're about to be redirected in the

1008
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:36,240
sheebie yeti-like. Yamest it. Hand shadow stream. I don't know. How would I do a rabbit?

1009
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:41,120
So those are the ears. Where's its face? I don't know, how does its face feel like?

1010
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:53,200
Wait. That's too hard. This is too hard for my brain. Okay, I am going to let you raid into

1011
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:59,840
sheebie's pantalones. I've had a really fun hand cam stream. That's the first time I've

1012
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:03,360
ever done something like this. I hope you enjoyed it too. And if I get monetized,

1013
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:10,000
then you will begin something similar, not the same. Similar, not, not the same.

1014
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:17,360
Similar. Okay. Similar. Yeah, you're like, I got my nails done. Did you see? You notice

1015
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:24,880
it's showing off my nails? Got them dead. Okay, you loved it. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't

1016
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:28,880
know what to do, honestly. I was like, I don't really know what you guys want. Like,

1017
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:33,120
we'll review these sweets. And now I have tons of sweets that I don't like. Do you think I could

1018
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:36,560
send them to the girls and pretend that they're a cure package, but really I just don't want to

1019
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:44,640
eat anything? Okay, that was so fun. Thank you so much. I'll see you all tomorrow for

1020
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:55,920
oh wait, it's Elden Ring for Foostroda. And I'll teach you all the strats on how to get 100%

1021
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:00,720
achievement playthrough. Whoa, is that as bad for you as it is for me when I see the preview?

1022
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:07,120
My hand, like, just teleported. But I hope you enjoy my French tips. You know,

1023
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:17,520
a ha ha, wee wee baguette for my, oh wait, hold on. French tips. Yeah. Thanks to the stream,

1024
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:22,720
Elden Ring. That keeps saying Elden Ring. It's not Elden Ring yet. Elden Ring is the motor. No,

1025
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:27,520
next week. It's Elden Scrolls. I keep getting Elden Ring and Scrolls messed up right now.

1026
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:32,880
Yeah, these are French tip nails. That's what these, this is the style. They paint the white

1027
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:39,120
on it, but it's like my natural nail color and everything. It's called French tip. You know why?

1028
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:46,000
Because I'm French and I'm giving you the tip the night, boys. Right, enough, enough.

1029
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,760
Sheeby's live. Please enjoy Sheeby to your heart's content. Thank you so much for watching me rate

1030
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:55,440
American sweeties. Where the heck did that come from? That just flew out of nowhere. I got afraid.

1031
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,240
I thought it was a spider. Thank you so, so much for stream. I will stop rambling because I'm

1032
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:04,160
holding you up. I'm holding the line of command. Please enjoy Sheeby to all your might. I will

1033
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:09,120
see you tomorrow for two endurance back-to-back streams. So get ready to strap in. If not,

1034
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:11,840
I will get strapped on. See you tomorrow.
