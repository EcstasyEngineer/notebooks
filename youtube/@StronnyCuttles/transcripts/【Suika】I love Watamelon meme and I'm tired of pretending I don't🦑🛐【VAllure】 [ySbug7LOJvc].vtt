WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Oh wait, how do you fit me in life?

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't know what to pop it, ah good morning, I see it, it says I'm up, I'm sorry I'm up,

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
good morning, good evening, good afternoon, we've learned, hiya, America, hiya, hiya,

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
I literally just woke up right, and then I quickly scrolled Twitter whilst I've got like

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
literally one thirty seconds to my name after like booting up the stream and everything

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
and Emmys like, wait actually you know what, I can freaking quote it and I can let you listen to

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
hold on let's find, oh my god I don't have any DMs with Emmys on Twitter, oh my god proof that there's

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
inciting at me allure, right are you ready for this, her most recent tweet that I just saw,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
wow I'm so happy I'm not three hours into a shift at the cash register dealing with old people

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
complaining that the newspaper got ten cent more expensive, I love my job, also Emmys

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant, get fucking pregnant you precious little slut, get pregnant

01:15.000 --> 01:25.000
yeah, damn straight you love your job either one, we're playing Wata Melan

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
and I love the Wata Melan meme, no the meme is not overused is I had email notifications on and just got here

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I hide them for hours playing Suika or Suika or Suikobliat

01:37.000 --> 01:47.000
so yeah, I have email notifications on I'm still late, why would you have email notifications on, that's so curse

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
but I feel okay today please don't worry, I looked at Marshmallow, I'm so sorry for worrying anyone

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I did not, I've never played this game before, no

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
I am so sorry for stressing anyone out, I'm gonna quickly read the super chats I missed yesterday

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Sada, thank you for the extended membership and their message was face

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
like the capital D face

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Veeler Lover, how the hell can she be a tease when she's still out of breath

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
because on my dying breath I will be a tease

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Nero2276, thank you for the super chat, is this the bite of Vsucky?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
is this the bite of 87?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
good reference, anonymous

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I've once heard that females can have miniature inking from work out, this is true

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Stony's panting sounds like she's recording an audio, no no no

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
it is true, women can experience a floor firework if you will, a floor muscle firework

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
thank you for that tip anonymous and then anonymous said good job mami

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
good job Riflin, you did amazing, now give us

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
now give us you a nice little, oh massage all over your body, I'll take it honestly

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm ironically a bit small, small, so are

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
but today we are testing if in fact it's true or not

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
if this game truly has VTubers in a chokehold

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
jesus, that's blind and first thing in the morning, can we change?

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
Aladdin, Prince of the Fabulous, he's drowning in water

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I do not know the words

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
can we stop blinding myself, oh my god can you load faster

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I thought this was like a tiny little indie game, honestly

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
are you squidding me right now?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
thank you for the super chat really legend

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
so what I'm hearing is I have to look for a VOD, if you'd like to

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
okay first off cute adorable, Kawaii-nee

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
single player plays, well that's the only option I've got

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
apparently the DLC's behind the paywall

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
are you squidding me right now?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
still didn't even have the fill thing, I'm not kidding

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I've got a cup of tea to wake me up

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
oh my god reeflings

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
reeflings, I have something that I need to keep for you guys

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
only you guys are allowed to know this

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
don't leak it anywhere or I can't keep leaking stuff

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I found artwork of someone that like drew

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
that draws feet, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
okay

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
and I commissioned them to draw everyone's feet in the allure

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
okay and I was so fucking excited to get that

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
turned down the game I think a bit

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
anonymous, thank you for the tip

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
hi story, I can't believe you and Emmy are going back and forth with our no-

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
no, no, no, no, Emmy's first

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I bet it would be fun to see pinpals versus re-

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
that's not how, personally that's not how I do it

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I actually want the girls to be ahead of me

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I've kind of said this before

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
I've put advertisement money behind the girls

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
but I've not done it myself

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
the only exception was the trailer

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
because all of us for debut had to generate some kind of hype

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
and unfortunately Shibi and Azura's big fat yunkers

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
stopped their ads from running on their trailer

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
which is quite upsetting

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
but I personally do not do it like that

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I am not here to outdo my genmys

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I actually want them all to succeed

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
and be ahead of me

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
so when Emmy went ahead

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I was absolutely ecstatic

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I truly was ecstatic

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
and she's still ahead

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
which I'm very happy about Shibi

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I've given an ASMR script too

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
which she will be recording

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
soon to end

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
when she's not at her grand-pappy

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
parents house

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I think that's where she is

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
boobs

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm trying to draw, I saw you draw Emmy too

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm okay

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
is your sweat toggle still on?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
it is!

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
thank you Reefling

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I couldn't see that

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
thank you Reefling

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
oh my god I'm such a professional streamer

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I also managed to get my order changed

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
before it came through

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
so the dog bowl and the dog collar

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
are gonna say the right things

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I don't know how you noticed that

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
from so far away

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I would have played the entire game sweating

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
literally

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I hope you liked my silly drawing

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
are you joking? I'm yonking at making ASMR

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
right, how to play Suika

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
use the

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
yes

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
or up and down to move

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
no we're not doing up and down that's terrible

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
we'll use the less stick

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
next press the A button to drop the fruit

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
uhhhh

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
okay I guess

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I didn't read the rest of the thing

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
right

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
okay

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
hold on

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm just getting used to the mechanics

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
if you will

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
okay

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
hold on let me get up let me get up

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
let me go up

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
so this is what had VTubers

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
in a choke hold for how long

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
this

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
am I addicted yet

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
the answer sadly is no

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm not I'm not sure if I'm gonna get addicted

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm unsure

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I have yet to form an opinion on such a game

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
what's going on here it still has a

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
choke hold on VTubers does it actually

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
well I see

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
someone very

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I think someone might have

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
gone on her throne and got her switch

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I said to her

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
oh I'm playing this game

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
and I'll recommend it to you

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
ooh we got a lemon

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'll recommend it to you if you're

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
wanting

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
recommendations because I'm trying to help her pick a few games

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
that are more her style

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
oh fuck that one up

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
oops

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
so I need what pray that

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
they're just gonna randomly touch each other

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
okay I guess

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
oh no I can't reach the orange one

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
over the mandarin

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
oh god I think I'm like

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
really I think I'm screwing this up

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
sorry wait hold on a minute

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm messing this up so badly

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
oopsies I still loving

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
what kind of games do I see

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I see needs a casual experience

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and no I don't mean that and then

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
so do you

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
relax

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I just mean that I see likes a game

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't have to swear on

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
okay or is a familiar game so I'm putting the list together

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I didn't mean competing against

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
oh sorry anonymous I apologize

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I did not mean to paint your

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
tip in that light my apologies that was my fault

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I just think it would be fun

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
to make a challenge of viewer fans

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
just like Emmy did were pin pals so everyone can

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
get ahead of you

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
did she tell you the challenge she did

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
yes there's actually

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
this is inside her knowledge

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
fucking strongy stop leaking inside

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
your knowledge challenge impossible

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I am going to do a meet and

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
oh I got you a pink thing

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
what's a pink fruit

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
that's that big a melon

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
maybe there's a pink melon

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
but it's not the water melon

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
um

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm literally impossible

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
for me not to leak in company secrets

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
it's just a big peach oh it's a peach

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
it's my booty

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
fuck you booty fuck you bitch

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
um sorry that was

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I think that's a meme of some kind

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
um

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I am not strategically playing this game

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I actually don't know what I'm doing

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm just having a good time okay

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
no touch yay

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
oh you can touch

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
touch touch yes yes

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
oh my god okay hold on a minute

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
hold on a minute hold on a minute

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I think I'm starting to understand

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
again VTubers I might

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
have to issue a public apology

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I might have to

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
issue on a public apology hold on

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
a minute

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I might have to do it

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
um right okay company secrets

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
getting leaked in 4k

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm having a meeting with the girls

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
and I'm telling them like hey this method

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
seemed to really work for me so if you

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
want to offer free audios

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
on Twitter in exchange for like

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
milestones I'm happy with that

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
like I have so much ASMR

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
debt and audio debt

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
on Twitter coming up but once

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
it's finished like I might

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
do something like that and be like

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
oh for I don't even know how many

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
for 15k subscribers I'll do this

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
outrageous thing okay see now I'm

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
starting to block myself

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm not really

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
sure what to do

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I mean I'll just go for it I mean

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
it's alright it's just a fun little

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
goofy game it's actually

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
oh no oh no this can't be right

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
go move over please

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
yes oh well I didn't

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
expect that one to move actually

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
oh we got the pitch

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
oh

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
head empty drop that motherfucking

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
apology arc inbound already I prefer

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
the company leaks in the form of puzzles

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
okay I'll keep that in mind

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
okay I'm gonna say something

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
there may or there may not be

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
a very high quality artwork

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I purchased for the 10th

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
10,000 subscriber milestone

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
so once all the girls hit 10,000

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
subscribers there may or may not

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
be an adorable artwork of us all

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
if I've not already leaked it I probably

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
have already

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I prefer company leaks

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
in terms of the juices

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I mean

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
you know I'm here

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I leak literally everything about the

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I can't help it I get so excited

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
but I'm so upset because we actually

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
have

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
something

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
am I gonna block myself? I think I am a

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
little bit

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
we actually have something I'm not allowed to leak

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
right now and all I'm gonna say is it is torture

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
sorry but I'm not even being dramatic

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
when I say that it is torture

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
oh it's so cute

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
what's like the average score

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I wonder if I should like oopsies

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I mean maybe it's better it got pushed

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
over

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
stop leaking

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
damn fine can't help it

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
yeah we have to get everyone to 10k

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
happy pineapple literally

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
what's that pineapple been so cute for

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
the average is 1,800

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
are you wearing clothes in the artwork

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
uh

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
no really not really

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
no not in the artwork

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
no average score is 2k

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't know your main goal at least

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
at least get one watermelon

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
literally it's the best meme I don't know

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
why people are sick of it I don't care I get spammed

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
everywhere I love watermelon

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
okay let me finish my cup of tea

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
whilst I leak company

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
secrets as I always do

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
the clipping program

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
has been green lit for $2

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
per 1000 views

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
there is a cap

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
at 100k

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
so the maximum money you could make

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
from a clip is $200

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
however if that clip

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
for some reason like blew the fuck up

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I need to rate it out

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in a specific way where it's like you get more

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
money if it blows up but it has to reach a

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
milestone so like 250k

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and then you'd get a payout for that

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and clips are like obviously clips

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
need to have a timer on them

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
however we do have exceptions for

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
algorithm clips so clips that get

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
picked up in the algorithm mean

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
they weren't picked up at the start but maybe

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
3 months down the line it randomly got

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
we have an exception for that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
so I am in the

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
process of

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
hold on I can play one handed

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and drink tea and leak company secrets

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I love this game

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
oh I missed

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
oh no

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
can I like force it to touch that one

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I can wait this is

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
actually physics simulator hold on

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
something's going on over there

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I'll pop you there

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
a strongy snail

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
veal or snowden honestly

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
can't hold me back

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
youtube is currently cracking down on clip channels

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
yes that's why we wanted

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
to offer

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
money and exchange

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and now you have to get except

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
oh no

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I need those cherries to kiss

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
draft hmm

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't think I can get the cherries to kiss

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
unless I can I push the yellow

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
thing away

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
ooh

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
why am I like

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
this

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
they're moving everything's moving

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
okay

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
hold on a minute

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
yes I got approval for that so I need to

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
write it yesterday I was writing the

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
script

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
it's currently my longest script

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
oh god I've messed this up

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
how are you supposed to like

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
can you plan ahead mentally

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
maybe you can

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
maybe you can plan ahead mentally

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
what if I do this

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
nothing's touching right I'm being

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
a bit silly like spreading everything out like this

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
if only

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
they could touch

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
well that bought me some time

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
right if those two pink ones

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
can just touch each other

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
are you squidding me right now

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
stuff's happening

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm not even paying attention thank you

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Gavabond for becoming an extended membership

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
update on Mercy and Azura's emotes

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Azura's getting too fixes

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Mercy's getting too fixes and then they will be up

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and then I will order the

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
order the missing emotes

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
for everyone those little love hearts

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
you see these are place holders

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
for the emotes that the girls can unlock

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
thank you to any support that is shown

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
via membership to the girls

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
whether it is gifted or purchased by yourself

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
it is

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
are you squidding me right now

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I forgot I had this happy moment

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
thank you Rekima for this

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
oh shit why not

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
oh stuff's poppin

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
stuff's poppin

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
are you okay though

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
there's like such a big gap down there

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
oh come on

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
go a little to the right

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
no go to the right

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
no no I need to push it to the right

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
come on go to the right

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
oh wait why aren't you touching

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
are you being so for real right now

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
you better touch right now

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm sorry for being great

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
DEMPA you have a wrench

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
you don't can

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
you've seen the meme rebecca's take away shop

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
edgin and my sakeer game

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
more likely than you think

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
she's approaching the end of her run

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
oh I'm messing it up

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I mean it doesn't look that bad

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
if I could get the pink ones to touch

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't know

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I mean for the first attempt

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
like you have to give it to me sorry

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
but this is a good first attempt

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I think it's a good first attempt anyway

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
so what do I need

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
you put my little strawberries together

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
put these together

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
oh no I messed

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
up then you look

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
then you look I'm embarrassed

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
okay there we go

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
can the cherries touch? why is nothing wanting to touch each other

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
are you allergic to each other

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
do you have a fruit allergy

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
can I like drop it to push it over

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
come on

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
split them apart

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
it's come on physics similar

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I saw this game's actually not that bad

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm sorry vTubers

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't know why I doubt you guys

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
literally I want to play supermarket simulator so

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
badly

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
but no one's gonna enjoy it

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and I'm like

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
doesn't Suica

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
have a button that bounces them

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
stop

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
it says move A for drop

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
X for menu

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Y for ranking

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
switch ranking

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I don't have that

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't even have the melons yet

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I mean

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
no I've only had a pineapple

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
but my score is over a thousand

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
so for my first attempt

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I'm

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
oh

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
that's not good

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
that's not good at all

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
oh no

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I didn't look at the life cycle

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
of the fruit properly

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
oh no wait

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
why did I do that

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
can things start

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
touching please

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
can things start shoving

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
each other out of the way

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
oh no it's ogre

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
what did I get

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
1360

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
that's so good

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
okay let me write that down

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
hold on write that down

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
that's not that bad

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm not even mad so I was

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
right high score

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
1360

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
it's okay groups you

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
what was the context

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
it keeps track for you

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
oh did I not even need to pin it

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
oh okay

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
monthly daily overall

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
right you have entered

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
the ranking

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
okay

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
did I just restart

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
right we got

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
we got a pineapple on our first attempt

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I don't know where I went horribly wrong

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
no

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
why are you going all the way over there

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
stop being so dramatic honestly

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
don't roll away

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
do I make myself clear

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
don't you dare roll away

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I literally went halfway

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
across the map

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
vealer's suica arc

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I think emmy has a switch as well

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
so

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
she wants a cam stream

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
like so whenever I finish a game

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
always taping like a little review

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
in the discord and I'm like hey guys

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
this was a two over experience

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
this is what happened in the game

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
it was just a fun and a goof and a gaffe

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
basically and I'm like I'm sure

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
they're probably sick of it they're like

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
oh we get it strongy

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
shut off about your damn game

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
but like always review them and I'm like

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
oh if you want a chill game experience

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I was picking my schedule

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
for when my dad goes home

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
and to avoid all the depression

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and I picked lego lord of the rings

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
to cheer me up

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
so don't be surprised

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
when you see lego

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
rollie pollie's away literally

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
strongy vs emmy suica

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
addition yes suica

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
or suica

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
yes I'm literally between lego lord

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
of the ring I'm so excited

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
we will eventually see

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
strongy in a steam

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
game review

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I wanted to do an indie game review

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
series where we give like

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
indies a shot because like

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
sometimes all you need is

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
like you know what

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
you know what an example is among us is an example

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
of like someone

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
picking up a game if you didn't know

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
among us came out and it wasn't

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
even that popular like at all

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
and

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I don't know if that's a terrible idea

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
oh I've done it now

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I've done it now that was a

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
terrible idea don't ever do that again

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm sorry are you squidding me right now

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
touch

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
touch

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
touch

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
touch touch

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
more people need to

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
write reviews on streams from the

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
perspective of a streamer the

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
veiler game jam when

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
real or

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
steamer game

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
be sucky to be

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
sweet

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
is lego lord of the rings the same level of quality

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
as old star wars yes

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I literally

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
this sounds really sad but I remember

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
where all the items are hidden and everything

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and the maps are so what we're going to do

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
when we play lego lord of the rings is

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I'm going to play through the entire campaign

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and then we're going to go back and pick up

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
all the stuff because I know where everything is

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
why am I throwing am I throwing

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
why did that work out the game

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
just let me throw

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
oh my god I love when the game lets you throw

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and it like bails you out randomly

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
pansley gameplay oh yeah

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
pansley's go up

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
august 1st the girls get access

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
actually on the last day

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
of this month

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and it's up to them how much they want to do

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and they keep 100% of their cut

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
because veiler did not specify they had to stream

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
on that website so we don't take anything

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
so if you want to support them you may support

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
away have you tried

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
shadow of mordor

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I thought I did I looked at gameplay

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I think I must have played a demo or something

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
so we're actually going to play that

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
for the first time yeah we got pizza already

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
we're going to play

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it's technically for the first time but I am

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
familiar with the mechanics I mean we'll find out

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
on the day when I play honestly right let me finish

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
this team before it gets freaking freezing cold

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
well anyone be posting links

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
the names are already taken exactly

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
as found so you don't really need to dig

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
you'll see them and use their alternative

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
twers anonymous thank you for the tip

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I was rewatching

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
the yumi plus concert reaction and the thought

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
came to my head I can imagine

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
scrawny going on a hype rock rampage

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
singing

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
songs by my chemical romance

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
she be caught in bumps sounds like she would

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
enjoy singing R&B

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
we were we're going to talk

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
about it in the meeting

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't think it would be cute

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
but I did not know this

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
emi has insane

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
stage fright when it comes to singing

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I didn't know

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I thought she was joking

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
em because she like put a little

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
cute message because we have dm's

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
with yumi plus like all the girls in yumi plus

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
they're all sorry let me finish my tea holy crap

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I can't keep rambling it's going to go freezing

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
what do you think of bandsley versus patreon

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
patreon is a staple

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
income source whereas bandsley is not for the girls

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
so I obviously

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm biased if you want to support the girls

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
doing it via patreon

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I've got an azeria update actually

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I need permission to talk about it

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
if she's still with it or not hold on

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
are you cool with me

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
talking about

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I actually have a collab

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
with azeria today so I hope you're not sick of her

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
because I get to play with her today

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
okay

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know a good place to put these down

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't even did I do that

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I feel like the game did that for me

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I feel like the game has like a tiny little

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
magnet that gives you a

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
who goes there a few pixels of like relief

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
because that's insane

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
what's going on here

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I've got

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
apparently azeria shorts

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
are about to come through tomorrow and I'm freaking

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
humping this screen

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
because azeria has like hilarious shorts

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
coming through

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
emmy oh my god right sorry

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I keep mentioning emmy

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
she like she'll send me shorts

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
and it's literally emmy and denpa talking

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
about cheese

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
and I'm like emmy what do you want me to do

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
with this clip how am I supposed to turn it

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
into something that's appropriate

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and she's

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
she's just fucking she's amazing

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
she's a hoot in a hauler to work with

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I don't care what anyone says sorry but

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
literally my little sister is so

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
freaking adorable

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't care

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
literally so in the discord

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
this is just straight up leaks at this point

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
in the discord there's a channel where the girls can submit clips

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
so if you guys clip anyone's stream at any point

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and you give it a title

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
she'll be able to she'll send it to me

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and then I'll send it on to Nedder

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
as I said she's got a song cover coming out soon

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm just waiting for a few things to finalize

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and then it'll come out

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
although I think it might be delayed unfortunately

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
it was supposed to come out when she was away on holiday

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
but oh my god sorry let me finish this tea

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I've still not finished it

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
it's gonna be frozen

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
that's straight tea

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
that was a rubbish tea

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
cute daughter emmer's honestly

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
nah I love all the girls

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
they're actually like so fun to work with

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I don't care what I like literally they're just

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
ooh right

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I'm needing it to take a laugh

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
thank you vealer lover for the tip

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000

am I gonna get

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
emmy can do no wrong

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
whilst I was writing the pregnancy script ASMR

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I could have sworn at one point

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
she sounded like freaking iron mouse

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
she made a voice and it sounded just like her

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and I was like

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I didn't know you could make that voice

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
monster supremacy

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
juice to go up

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
but it is

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
we got the melon between the water

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
this has got the same

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
tension as bobble bubble

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
oh is that another game

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
you don't run into many surely

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
surely not

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
you've got a decent set up

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
not too many fruit trapped underneath

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
oh I'm not to trap them underneath

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
trap them underneath

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
mmm the bigger the fruit

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
are surprisingly

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
late in the physics

I'm learning

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I'm learning right pop

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
why are you going down

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
it keeps pushing the honey do

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
up but I'm not really wanting it

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
to be up

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
not really wanting it to be up

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
if I'm being honest

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
it's kind of ruining the flow

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
of my gameplay

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
actually I'm ruining the flow

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
of my gameplay I'm currently

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
sabotaging myself what is this

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I mean

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
it's alright I would say the game

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
is fun when you're winning

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
but when the game looks like you're not really getting

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
anywhere it's just kind of like

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
actually gonna write a letter for you

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
so that I get to read but I'm only allowed to

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
read it when he's away I'll probably end up crying

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
impressive she stayed

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
relatively calm you having fun

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
it's amy it's alright

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I don't know

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
maybe it's just kind of one of those games

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
because I just remember

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
it came out and

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
everywhere you looked

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it did not matter who you looked at

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
they were sitting on this game challenging

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
each although that was actually probably the fun

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
of it challenging each other to like

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
oh if you get

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
cherries please touch

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
if you get like

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
X amount of

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
you know

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
addiction yes basically

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and the lyrics limit biscuit

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Lauren unironically rames the word here

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
with the word here literal

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
lyrical crime

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
yeah the competitiveness

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I just remember everyone was like oh this is

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
my score beat it and then everyone was

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
like today we're going to be in the score

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
and I think that's where

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
the fun of it came in

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I don't know maybe I'm allowed to set it

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and then I'll challenge the girls because I know

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
emmy's got a switch

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
ac just got a switch

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
oh that was it oh my god sorry the minute though

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
it's a bit satisfying hold on a minute this game

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
hold on hold on I was a bit hasty in my review

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
that was rather satisfying

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
um

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
oh I just blocked myself off

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and it doesn't matter because it just

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
bounced halfway across the map that's fine

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I didn't want that anyway

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
um

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
oh okay we've got a peach

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
we've got a peach

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
ah

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I just got the watermelon on my third attempt

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
stop you guys

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
someone said that they said they were playing a game

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
alongside me and they had

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
beat it like three times over by the time

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I won my first attempt at it I can't remember

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
what game it was and I was like

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
are you literally sniping the game

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and doing like ten times better than me

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
um I was absolutely

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
he hot and at the

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
concept you're just doing like way better and being like

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
right hurry up streamer come on

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
strongy we're waiting for the result

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
um

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
okay

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
we're gonna match you

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
watermelon for melon honestly

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
right I've got two peaches

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I don't know how to make them kiss

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
see I don't know how to just

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I keep doing that I keep going

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
oh there's enough room there's not enough room

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
strongy please please

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
there's not enough room

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't know why something

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
oh I don't know sometimes it'll

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
move in the oh come on

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
no

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
say it ain't so

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I will not go

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
turn the lights

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
oh they kiss

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
was it valid true it might have been

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
it might have been because I checked

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
my marshmallows after stream and you guys always

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
say such nice things I'm so sorry to worry

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
you guys again I had loads of marshmallows

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that were like are you alive

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I literally passed out after stream

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I was so weak

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
in frail

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I had this fruit juice in the fridge

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
so I opened that up and like

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
took a few sips and then passed out

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and I think it was like low I hadn't

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
had anything to eat I'd just

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
woken up I didn't stretch I haven't

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
exercised in ages

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
um like all of those factors

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
came together at the same time

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
and it was like ooh shouldn't have done that

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
by the way

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I had a really fun time on the stream though

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
like I enjoy Ring Fit I like

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
that it's different I like that I can move around

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I think it would be a lot more

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
effective if it was a 3D stream

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
like a 3D model stream

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
things are gonna have to start

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
kissing or I'm gonna be in trouble

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I think I'm in trouble things aren't kissing

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
okay but again same

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
problem things aren't kissing

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
unless we

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
force them to kiss

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
no I'm just

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
creating a gap and now I've created a problem

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I've created a monster

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
nobody wants to see Marshall no more

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
he's top level

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Ring Fit can never harm you again

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
well like everyone was like

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
oh my god your heart rate and I'm like

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
oh wait I've not told you the lore here

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I haven't

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
like an abnormal heart rate it's faster

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I'm a hamster

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
too long didn't read

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I'm a hamster okay don't worry

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
about my heart rate it's normal for me

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
it's not normal for you but it's normal for me

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I'm on how am I messing

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
this up so badly I'm on

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
like observations and if I ever

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
have any concerns about my heart I'm just

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
no what am I doing

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
what am I doing

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
right stop rambling

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and start try hard and I'll make myself

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
clear

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
oh my god I'm in so much trouble

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I was like

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
dad say Privyat she's Russian

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and he was like

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Privyat Privyat

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and I was like oh not really

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
echoes of monkey noise

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
in the distance honestly

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
see I like when it does it

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
by itself

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000

I dare you to kiss little purple grapes

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
actually

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I believe in red grapes

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
superiority over green grapes

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I said what I said it's like red apples

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
red apples are sweet

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
green apples are sour

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
grandaddle

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I like when it randomly pops

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I'm like ooh what was that

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I have to go now be back later

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I'm being trolled

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I just suck at this game

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
honestly

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
you know how about I just accept the fact I suck

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
how about that

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
instead of try hard and being upset

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
every time I do

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I'll come on

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
no

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
no

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
please rotate

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
a little to the left

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
okay

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
okay

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
okay

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
something's moving

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
are you squidding me right now

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
okay

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
throwing for content

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
the fanbases would be upset

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
no all the girls are fine

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
what the

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
no I'm not gonna die

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I promise literally the doctor

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
cleared me and she was like

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
if you have any concerns just come back in

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
because I was saying like I have loads of palpitations

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and all that

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
and I have a faster resting heart rate

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
heart rate and she was like you're just a hamster

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
smell

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
okay

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
at least

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I need you the other game but I've completely

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
balls it up

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I don't know what the secret method or tactic is

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
but I have yet to figure it out

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm not throwing for content I'm just dumb

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
okay those are two separate things

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
these are two issues we're having to deal with

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
at the same time I'm just

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
incredibly dumb okay

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
thank you

I found the secret

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
oh he found the secret chat

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
sounds like cheating to me those are

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
sukyo paths

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
people with a lot of patience

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
are practice

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
honestly don't know how you can do that without a cheat

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
yeah that seems insane some people are that

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I mean I'm sure there's

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
probably some sort of hidden method

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
right there boom get right

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
okay and then just shove everything

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
to the side of this

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
okay

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
yeah

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I don't know how to do this

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
put the cherry there then it can come

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
off the wall baby

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
oh no I blocked off that strawberry

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I wasn't using oh

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
are we going to do that

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
but how it did

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I can't remember

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
sukyo is a drug in Japan

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I wonder if it's because it's like such

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
a nice casual experience like you don't

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
have to try hard it's not like you log in

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you like waste all your like progression

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
or whatever it's not like that

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
it's just like you can open it up

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
sit down and have a

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
just some casual fun honestly

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
so I was a bit folk or so mean about casual gamers

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
but

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
casual gamers are eating well sorry they are

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
like

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
maybe we were too hasty

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
maybe we shouldn't have judged

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I can't tell if gimli just meowed

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
or there's

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
a note in this game that sounded like a cat meowing

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
in my brains like gimli

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
right we'll put the orange here

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
cause we're gonna get I know oh well

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
talk about hashtag predictions

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
okay there's an orange there

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
then we do that

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and then we do this one

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and then we do this one

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and then put orange here

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and then we've got yellow

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
it's like match three games in facebook

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
mums stop that

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
that's a little too real

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
remember when the statistics came out about

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
who's the biggest populace in gaming

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
and it was like

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
because of like games like farmville

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
and candy crush

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
women overall are like the biggest

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
player base

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
because of those statistics

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I remember reading it and it was like

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
oh my

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
what happened

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I don't know what happened but I'll take it

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
and it was like oh my god

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I can't believe it

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
it was like women over four

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
are the biggest gamer

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
literally and I was like holy shit

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
we need to like level up gamers

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
holy crap

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
that's so cute

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
okay we already got telly

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
we orange

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
becomes other orange

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
then orange and orange becomes cherry

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
becomes lemon

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
let them get up

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
let them get up

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
right we're gonna put the purple here

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
and then we're gonna put the orange here

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
and then we're gonna put the grape here

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
you're not grape you're a strawberry

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
oh no I don't want to

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
separate them too much and then two oranges

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
make a telly and then an orange

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
okay I think I'm getting the order

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
things a little bit

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
it'd be better

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
but

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I'm getting it maybe

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I'll speak a little too soon but if you

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
wow

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
you're not a real gamer if you don't speak too

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I'm strategising

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
only match two if you dare

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
my mum was really good at tetris and when she found the tetris battle royale game

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
she was hurt honestly

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I would know my mum plays

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
those whenever she has downtime

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
and developed a worse gaming addiction

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
than me

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I think the sims doesn't count as games

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
oh that is the hot take

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
kinda used to be like that

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
where I was like oh that's not a real game

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
but then I was like you know what

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
let people have fun

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
like

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
if people are happy playing a game I'm just happy

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
they kinda have like something

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
they have something like downtime wise

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I think I don't know I just think it's sweet

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I just think it's nice

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
okay

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
what did that do for me

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
exactly

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
that is exactly

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
why I didn't want to put that damn cherry there

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
it's pushing the peach up though

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
okay

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
okay some things are

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
moving

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I don't know if I want to put it inside there

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
that's what she said

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
don't say such things

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
it's first thing in the morning in refland

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
don't say such things

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
okay there I think that was probably the better idea

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
rather than to separate

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
oh no

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
put the orange there

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
all according to plan

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I can't believe we're literally strategizing

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
on a freaking fruit game

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
right if those two

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
cherries can kiss up there

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
that would be cute

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
what was if he kissed

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
what was if he did wiggle of kitten

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the sims isn't giving every girl all 400

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
US dollars worth it

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
bruh I think his are paid for the DLC

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
and I was like are you joking me

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
just fucking message me next time a DLC comes out

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
oh wait she said hi to me

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
she said hi to me in the end

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
okay

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
one second

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
okay everything's fine

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I thought something went

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
exploded no I'm just kidding

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
right let's try again focus up

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
we are gamers

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
we know how to game

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
for the most part

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
stop giving me the wee ones

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
please

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
if I wanted them to go there

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I would have put them there

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
not the cherry that accidentally

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
fell down there blocking

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
the big apple

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
come on

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I thought this game was supposed to be easy

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
your gamers still have leveled up

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
gain strategizing well I've literally just backfired

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
in 4k how dare you curse me

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
right now

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
literally just backfired horrifically

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
right you too

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
finally right if those peaches can kiss

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
please kiss

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
they look like mochi balls

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
mochi balls mochi balls

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
mochi balls

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
gotta catch them all

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
that's not what that is

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
right okay

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
okay okay

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
okay let them get up let them get up let them get up

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
stop

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
giving me cherries and strawberries

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
sorry I'm about to become cherries in 4k

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
it keeps giving me the wee ones

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
which makes my game harder

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
stop

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
getting me the wee ends

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
right I'm gonna put this here

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and then I'm gonna roll

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
oh well I literally ruled the orange thing

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
right

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
what does that mean

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
what does it mean

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
will someone please

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
think about what it means

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
okay there's things moving

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
you're allowed to move

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I give you permission to move

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
just as I give you permission to breathe

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
right that's gonna create an apple

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
on the top left

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
if that apple kisses a lemon

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
it becomes a peach which kisses that peach there

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
so that's fine

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
so we're gonna put an orange here

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
on purpose

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and then we're gonna roll

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
for an orange

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
wait

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
oh

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
why am I born like

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
this

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
okay there we go there we go

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
sorry I did it I'm so sorry

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I don't know why I'm born like this

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I don't know

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
why I'm born like that

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
seriously I literally say the strategy out loud

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
and then my brain's like do you want to do this

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
and I'm like sure

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
no

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
stop

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
how did I get them to touch

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
oh my god

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
actual strategy I can't believe it

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
thinking about and planning your next move

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
helps

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
this can't be true

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
no I was gonna hope

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
they would touch the orange in time

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I can't believe it

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
wait things are moving

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I need things to settle before I can start planning

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
is that cantaloupe it is

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
the thing is

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
why this game gripped the beach

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
you're for nearly a year what a melon

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and then I'm allowed to go okay

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that's when I have permission

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
we are purely morals living

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
in a world for a single cow

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
fish

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000

or is it hard to get

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
because of who I am

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
gen

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
when strawnee realises she wants to like

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
apple to become

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
yellow

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
stop giving me cherries

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000

I'm just like spamming them down I'm like

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
what do you want from me

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
okay I should probably be strategizing

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
right now but right I'll strategize

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
with that move okay and then watch this

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
uh-huh or yeah or yeah oh sugar

I want to do an apple with it well

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
not gonna lie I think this

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
runs over

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
unless

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
unless

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
okay we've got a bit of breathing room

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
but not enough

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
a thousand years of strongy don't

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
be able to grow as big as a whole

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
are you joking I ain't got that kind of money

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I ain't got that kind of money partner

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
she gaming it may be over

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
on the bright side high score

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
it is look at my high score it's

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
2000 I've not had 2000

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000

to push them apart

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
oh I think it's over I can't

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
really see a strategy

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
nope it's a straw

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000

for this one though it gives me a round

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
of applause for my terrible attempt

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
but this time

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000

we start we start we start

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
before stream has to end surely

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
surely

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
surely

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
surely green eggs and ham

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that I actually need to strategize

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I kind of don't want to use my brain though

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
ummmm

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
kind of don't want to use my brain

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
nah

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
right we want to shove those

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
together

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
right just fine bomb that's

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000

then you there

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
sorry I'm actually sweating

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
betting on a 5 hour stream

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
no I can't

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
see normally this would

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
devolve into a 5 hour stream naturally

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
but cause my dad's here

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
we're going out today

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
to a cafe again

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
mommy's mail in live

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
what just happened I believe

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
thank you Kaidon I hopefully believe too

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I do not believe

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
but I believe oh no did I just break

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
my game

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
did I just break my input

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
no did I just break my input

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I broke my I broke my input

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
are you serious

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
no I broke my input

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
cause I'm freaking streaming off the end

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
gato hold on

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
hold on hold on hold on

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
look at another music just

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
like casually caressing us in the background

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
hold on hold on hold on

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
hold on hold on hold on

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
nope that's not it

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
hold on I can't believe I broke that are you serious

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
why are you if I broken the L gap

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
where the fuck is it

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
why are you acting like

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'm not doing input right now

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I have no idea

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I'm gonna close it and open it again

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and if it doesn't pop up

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I think the stream's over unironically

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
hold on

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
um

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
open

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
oh my god

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
oh my god I'm so smart

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
but now it's not full screen

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
why is it not full screen

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
hold on let me make it full screen

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and then I'll show off

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
alright how the fuck did I make this full screen

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
you can totally see I'm having to

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
right so the way the freaking L Gato

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
works is in order for me to see the gameplay

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I have to capture it be a fucking

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
movie what maker

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I know I was so scuffed

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I was so scuffed I was the only way I could figure out

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
how to be able to see my stream

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
whilst I play the game

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and capture it to you at the same time

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
but it's not freaking full screen anymore

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I think I'm just gonna have to manually capture it

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
don't look don't look

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I know I know it's got

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
stop stop looking hold on let me fix it

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000

really scuffed mechanics just to record

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000

any bleeding hearts want to defend themselves

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
from the accusations are you just gonna take it

thank you for the tip

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Bob

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
they're not pre-recorded

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
stop

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
thank you tiny spiny

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
wait what stream did we think it was pre-recorded on

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
thank you Bob for stealing my panties

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I'm not wearing pantyloons as well

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
see Bob actually knows I'm wearing pantyloons

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
it's so weird wearing clothes

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I'm gonna say I've actually

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I've kind of gotten used to wearing clothes at this point now

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
but it is rather odd

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm not really that used to it yet

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
okay

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
purple can go there

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but strawberry and cherry has to go over here

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and then this is all gonna pop

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
oh my god I'm actually using my head for once

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
ah

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
if I put too strawberry

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
on this side

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
that will become a purple thing and it'll be happy

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
oh well nope I've just

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
absolutely messed myself up doing that

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
nice one

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
you want to try that again? no? do you just want to ruin the entire gameplay?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
yeah okay well as long as you're having fun

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
yeah thanks brain

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
no

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
the game knows exactly

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
where I put that

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
the game knows exactly

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
where I put that

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
right

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
okay that was actually really lucky

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
okay okay okay

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
let him get up

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
right we're gonna put this over here

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
and then we're gonna put the orange one right here

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and then we're just gonna throw all the stuff down here

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
until we get what we want

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
okay we're here for something in particular

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
we're not gonna go until we get it

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
do I make myself clear?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
exactly that's what I want

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
boom boom boom boom

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
oh you can kiss

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
it's okay don't be shy

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
yeah it's only a save for work

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
are you sure AC is the feral one?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
honestly oh we actually got a cantaloupe

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
like so early on

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I guess the baby pit

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
strategy

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
the kiss

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
a few of you have been

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
confessing in my marshmallow that you get a bone bone when I kiss

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and I'm like you shouldn't have told me that

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I've got too much power now

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
okay

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
you've given me too much power

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
you have

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I did not put it on that say

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
don't

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
things are popping

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
probably lack under rapid

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
right that's clearly not gonna touch

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
anything but that is there

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
who's leaking

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
what is marshmallow?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
marshmallow is a way you can anonymously talk

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
to me

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
and leave me like questions about stuff

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
you want me to answer

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
or things you would like me to do for the girls

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
that kind of thing

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
or stuff that you would like to look out for

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
or look forward to

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
or stream suggestions as well

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
you can like straight up tell me what you want me to play

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
a lot of

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
reeflings may not realise that you guys

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
actually I can't believe I'm gonna say this

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
your guys' opinion

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
squeezed me quite strongly

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I'm not gonna lie

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
you guys

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
opinionated

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
wait we're actually on a decent run

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
sorry don't jinx it

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
if I put a cherry here

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
that's fine

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I'm gonna have to sacrifice

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
oh I need to think

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I'm actually having to use my

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
oh no things start moving my plan goes out the window

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
right

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
oh my god right okay okay it's fine

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
it's fine

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
just let it happen

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
okay I think this is gonna have to

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
be the sacrifice side now

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
unless I put the orange one there

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
no why would you do something

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
like that

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
why would you betray me like that

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I'm strategising so hard right now

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
and this is how you repay me

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
this is how you repay me

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I'm actually getting trolled in this game

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
we have influence

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
reeflings stay winning

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
wow that's a big one

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I'm proud to admit I'm one of those fellow reeflings

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
against a sudden richness

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I don't know if you're littered

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I mean you're littered but

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
right

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
if I put these two down here

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I get an orange okay

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I need one more orange and then that

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I'm having to sacrifice this entire

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
side

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
ah right

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
oh I'm having to sacrifice

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
this entire side for a payoff

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
hopefully

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
okay we got yellow what did yellow become

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I need a second yellow

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I'm in trouble

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
okay orange I'll take it

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
then a cherry

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and then a mix

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
okay we've got an apple

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
we just need one more apple and then the peaches

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
will kiss

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and then life will be hunky dory

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I repeat life will be hunky dory

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
any hunky doryers

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
no

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
oh is that gonna be

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
are we gonna be okay

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I think we're okay

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I think

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
okay

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
draft hold on

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
am I gonna have to roll for an orange

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
on the left side

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I'm gonna roll

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
for an orange

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
unless the game does that

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
which you're not really supposed to do that

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
because I wasn't actually planning on you doing that

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
it's three game for me and I'm

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
not sleeping till you get a war

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
the pressure jeez I ain't that good at the game

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
alright we've got an orange

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
we're gonna pop it right here

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and we're just

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
gonna do the throw method

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
because we need to roll for an orange

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
okay it's starting to backfire

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I repeat it's starting to backfire

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
okay okay okay okay okay

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
yeah

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
see this game

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
see this game

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
see this game

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I literally did so much

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
effort and work

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
to get nowhere and in the end

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
it didn't even matter

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
right there right and then go down go down

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
go down no no

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000

sucking towards each other go touch each other

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
right now jeez

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
oh that peach

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
the throw method

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
doesn't work

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I tried so high

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
r slash no context

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
wait what is

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
kiss kiss no no

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
the peach

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
isn't as heavy as Johnny's peach

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
real true

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
evidence to back up

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
right here

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I've just thrown this again

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
worked out we would have been laughing

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
but we're not laughing we're crying

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
can we just can I get like an extension

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
can I like download a mod that extends the box

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
by like five pixels

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
literally give me a tiny bit more room to breathe

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I'm not even kidding

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
oh I'm not even using my brain anymore

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
oh that's right in brainless

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and I'm fucking up the entire

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
gameplay

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
have done it

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
now I've done it now

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
right kiss

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
kiss what are you

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
okay

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
right okay okay okay it's fine

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I literally you know that little

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I sounded like one of those

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
sand mammals from

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Star Wars please tell me

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
you guys heard that too the wee thing that goes

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
wow

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I've forgotten what they're

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
called yeah clap clap kiss

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
oh I kill me

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
they're not called one for that so the hairy

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
tusky things that look like

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
um

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
willy mammoths but different

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
this is probably been said before

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
but the hair pattern activating when the avatar

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
bugs is kinda crazy oh it's my sleep toggle

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
are you ready

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
this is my sleep toggle

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
when I go to sleep

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I hypnotize you so you don't attack me

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
because I'm a cuttlefish and I'm actually quite edible

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
if you want to get really technical

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
but that's my sleep

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
but I can put I can manually put my hair

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
on my hypno pattern

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
hi I'm

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I'm a cuttlefish by the way I know

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I don't know hypnosis often but I promise

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I'm working on it I just need time

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I'm working on my hypnosis stream

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
did you just leak that you're doing a stream

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
dedicated to hypnosis yes I did

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I'm writing a script

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
for it so I don't mess up though

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
okay let's sweat

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
let's sweat I wanna make you sweat

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I will say one thing against this game

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I am gonna slander this game slightly

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
so if this is your favourite game please do close

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
your ear holes

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
it's only fun when things are going

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
your way but when things aren't going your way

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
it's just frustrating

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
oh my god

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
actually that just

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
reminded me I saw a comment on my YouTube

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
this morning someone went

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
this is the most casual Elden Ring player

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I've ever seen and obviously

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
it was a stream where I was summoning all you guys

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
in to do the work and I'm like

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
oh well yeah that's kind of the point

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I get to have fun with my reeflings

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I was giggling I'm sure

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
they were like oh my god let's see if this VTuber

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
is any good at Elden Ring

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
maybe and like hi reeflings

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
can the reeflings do it

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
oh you can do it like halfway across the map

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
with my crossbow ball spraying

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and missing everything

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
honestly I was giggling away

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I was like brrr you've come to the wrong streamer

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
if you're looking for skills

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
literally making reeflings play the game for it

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
whilst I'm like shoving food in my face

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
my favourite is that a reefling

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
gave me that crossbow ball that sprays

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
and then I missed all my shots

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
but won

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
and like you guys were giving me like

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
runes to level up in that

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I think when we go back to Elden Ring

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
we'll play the base game to activate Ranny

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and then

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
we'll go and do the DLC

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
and enjoy it because I was kind of speedrunning through it

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I didn't mean to speedrun through it

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
but just like

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I knew we were up against the Vaude

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
at 12 hours so I'm like

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
okay what's next show me what's next

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
reeflings type thing

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
but I think we need to maybe slow it down

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and enjoy ourselves

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
like I said we're not in a major rush

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
as if those are crisscross applesauce

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and right now

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
right I've got orange

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I'm wondering

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I bet you if I just spammed down the middle

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I'd actually get more points than

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
when I actually try hard in the game

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I'm looking forward to more Elden Ring

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I'm glad you are

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
yeah

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I am looking forward to

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
doing the DLC

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
more of it because

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I don't actually know what's up ahead

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
all in all in those

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
like the classic lines like put these

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
full of shambushes to rest

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
just popping in real quick

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I'm doing shit but I'm in the game

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I'm doing absolutely amazing in real life

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
although I'm a bit sad because

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
my dad's going home

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
soon and it feels like we've not

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
really done anything fun together

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
like we've been to cafes

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
we've been on a few car journeys

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
but like the weather's

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
absolute rubbish

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
like it is rubbish

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
we're capital R

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
so we haven't really been able to do anything

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and it just feels

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
not like it's a waste because he gets

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
like a holiday offer working that

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
but yeah it's just a bit

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
he wants me to learn to drive

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
like excuse me

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
every time

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
do you not see my amazing bike out there

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
that bike cost me like

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
300 dollars and it doesn't

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
cost any fuel

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I don't have to do maintenance I don't have to pay road tax

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
like I'm sorry but why would I learn to

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
drive when my bike gets me from A to B

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
so I'm actually a bike simp I don't care what anyone says

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I'm here for my bike

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I love my bike I love riding bikes

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
okay I said it

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I said it I love

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I freaking love my bike I do

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
it makes me happy

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
okay

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
so no it's those papa cuttles

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
but I'm legit not learning to drive

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I'm reading I miss trains

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
she's just like me for real for real

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I'm sorry I'm like so much fun on my bike

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and like I get to feel the wind through my hair

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and I get to like I don't know

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I think I appreciate it because I'm aware that like

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
not everyone's in good enough health to like ride

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
a bike and I get to like have a fantastic

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
time like the wind sweeps

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
through my hair I get from A to B like so fast

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I don't have to like

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
be on like I don't go on roads

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
because it's too dangerous for me to be on a road

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
so as illegit as even on the bike I would get

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
mowed down in like milliseconds

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
and because I'm just so bad

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
oh that was I didn't even

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm just rambling I'm being honest

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I'm not really playing right now

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
like I'd literally get hit by a car

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
so quickly if I was on the road so I'm not

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and I go on the pavements okay I said what

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I said I go on the pavements what you're gonna do about it

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
fart exactly

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
look

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
it wouldn't be me if I wasn't

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
messing it up every two seconds that's when

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
you know it's legit gameplay for me

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I get paid to bike you get paid

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
to bike to work

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
is that a thing what can't

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
well don't dox yourself but

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
what country would offer that

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
what country would offer cycle to work

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and get paid

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I've not heard about it in Scotland

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I'm not heard about it in Australia either

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
the Netherlands it's default Germany

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
no

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I know sorry sorry

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
reflink don't want to

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I'm mailman

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Netherlands

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
okay so here's a dodge

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I'm so sorry

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
reflink but not you being the most stereotypical

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I ride a bike and I'm dodge

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I'm so sorry

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
but that you can get more stereotypical

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
than that that's hilarious

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
oh bless your cotton socks that's amazing

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
oh you must be so healthy though

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
some German companies do it but it's really rare

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
sound fish not to be confused

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
with them for this

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
thank you for becoming a member and to support

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
your profile picture is terrifying

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
it looks like a shark that's like angry

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
why is this got muscles

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
why is it got musclies

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
my guess is courier

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I've been watching oh my god

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I've been making my dad watch delivery videos

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I watch a guy

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I think his name's like

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
London eats or something like that

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
and he like does episodes where he

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
oh I've randomly got peach

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
he like does episodes where he like

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
cycles around London delivering

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and he shows you like how much money he makes

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and I just find it fascinating that like human

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
powered stuff can like result in money

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I don't

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
so I find a lot of concepts

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
hard to like accept

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
not accept but to make heads

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I'm completely messing this up

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
focus right purple that's fine

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
purple can go there wait what's going on

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
something things are moving around

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
why is the peach being shoved up

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
did that help

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
or did that hinder I think that might have hindered

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I'm not gonna lie

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I think I might be in trouble

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
no I was gonna

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
put that in there

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
oh my god sorry

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
no

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
this game is such a

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
troll

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
please push it over

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
please push it over

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
no just

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
throw trying to push it over

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
it's fine

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
it's a child's game

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
don't ever

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
don't ever play that

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
mp3 file again to me

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
what was that

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
don't the disrespect

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
of this game

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
the disrespect to go

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
no

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
don't ever play that game again

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
that sound again to me how dare you

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
right I'm gonna just do

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
a method okay I'm just gonna do a method

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
please

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
you didn't like the clapping so it did that instead

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I am going to spam

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
and see if I can get more than 1,300

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
points just I'm just gonna

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
test it out I'm sure it's been tested a billion

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
times before

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
applause for 1,200

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
but a minimum for one

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I'm just gonna test it out

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I'm just gonna test it out let me test

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
okay

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
testing testing

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I'm just spamming it

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I mean stuff is

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I was joking about

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I would be better off just not even thinking

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
and putting it through but

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
the allegations

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I might not be beating them

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
things are

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
things are mashing together by accident

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
she's gonna cry when she gets

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
not we've already got a peach

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
bruh

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
bruh

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
okay okay I think it's gonna stop

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
working because we've got a variety going now

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
but

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
we're at 300 points without

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
even saying bruh

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
we're at

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
500 points without trying I swear

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
if I beat my record doing

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
a tactic like this

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
we're almost at 600

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
we're at 600 points

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
okay okay

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
okay it's fine

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
we're at 700 but we're literally

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
almost half of my record

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
by not trying

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
hold up

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
is this for real

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
why did this kind of work though

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
why did this kind of

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
work though

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
right

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
will I actually try and play

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I literally got

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
1000 not trying are you serious

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
is this like a secret method

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
that I've just discovered or is this like

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
everyone already knows this

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
okay things are

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
bruh

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
bruh

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
am I gonna make

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
more score

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
am I gonna beat

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
my record no

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
no tell

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
it's not true

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
it's not true

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
okay

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
okay right I was gonna say

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
right I'm kinda glad that I threw there

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I didn't mean to throw I meant to push that apple to the side

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
so it would come together

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
no way

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
no way

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
that was amazing

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
oh my god

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I'm not gonna lie

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I think that might have actually

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I'm sorry

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I'm so sorry

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
can I try that again I wanna try it again

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
but put it in the corner

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
blame RNG

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
honestly I wanna put it in the corner

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
this time

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
1300 points to spam

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I was literally

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
200 off my third place

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
no way this is the

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
freaking methods

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I refuse

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
just spam it down

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
and like here's me try hard

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
in trying to strategize and you're telling me

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I can just spam and then deal with it on the other end

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
random chance the only thing in this world

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
that is fair and biased

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
it won't be as effective in the corner

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
because there's less randomness for the fruit

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
to sort by size

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
it could be a viable strategy until you get

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
a certain fruit then

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
you can be more strategic

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
accidental

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
sort and strike

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
literally the game's just dealing with itself right now

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
the game's like here let's help out

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
what we at

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
300 okay it looks like the corner doesn't work

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
but the middle seems to work way better

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
yeah the corner isn't

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
like I'll move over

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
if it's gonna

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
no way

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I'm stunned

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
that's

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
that's outrageous

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
sorry that's legit outrageous

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
okay I'll move

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
to the other corner just not to throw

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
like ray of the end

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
okay

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
and then this one

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
then kiss okay

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
then put it in the middle

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
put the wee ones to the side

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
and then put what one they are

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
and that one they are

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and put it in a window

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
wow

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
oh my god good rng hello

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
well terrible rng because it decided to do that

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
to me I feel personally

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
attacked by this rng

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
please do not ever cook again

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
thank you right

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
if we get an apple

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
can you say apple

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
apple

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
uhhhh

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
just need an apple

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
just need a wee

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
a wee orange

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
will do it to be honest

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
okay yeah an orange like that

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
will do it

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
and then

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I guess take I don't want to risk it

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I'm doing the method where I throw everything

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
down the side until I get what I want

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
and of course the apples can't touch now

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
so that's like

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
the apple

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
the apple

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
the apple

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
actually I'm doing a karaoke stream

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
soon I hope you're ready for it

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
my dad literally leaves and then I start streaming

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
out the wazoo again I'm gonna be so depressed

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
so

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
hey apple stop that's what's been

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
literally tearing on the tip

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
of my tongue for ages

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
and I don't want to start it because my brain's gonna start it

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
cut an ear with oh I didn't mean

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
to put that down well

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
hey

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
literally one of the first thing I notice

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
when I got sent to stream of yours is how funny

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
we're not hating your frustration when bothered in a game

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
oh me just raging

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
in the game this is unplayable

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I can't play this

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
yeah yeah that's my streamer right there

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
actually the terrible thing

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
that's funny though I'll take it

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
things are moving

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
things are moving

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
things are moving

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I promise I'm not throwing I just don't know

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000

I mean it's the same on both sides really

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
other than that one's a blockade

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
but

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
it's my blockade to make

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
um

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
things are moving slightly

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
things are experiencing gravity

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
the laws of

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
gravity

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
in the world

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
is turning

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
inside out

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
you

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
200 degrees

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
that's not the words at all

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
and hard to see

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
so don't

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
stop the fruit

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
now

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
don't

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
stop kissing fruit together

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
because they're having a good time

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
having a good time

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
maybe no

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
that probably wasn't what I wanted

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
keep kissing little

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
fruits and then you will be

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
rewarded beyond your mortal comprehension

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
yeah oh

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
things are getting a bit stuck around this

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
kind of loop

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000

I'm so sorry

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I'm trying to think but it's hard

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I'm having to use my brain for once

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I'm tempted to try the spam method

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I'm so so I'm so tempted

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
is it your banana reflex

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
that's right I will kiss you

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
with the theme song of this game in the background

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
slaysaber I really

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
sorry some people hate it but I'm like

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
it's so fun to pretend to have a wee winky

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
sorry like

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
you can't even tell me you didn't want my winky

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I didn't believe you

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I promise I'm actually using a method right now

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
this is real I'm using a method

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm tempted to actually just spam

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
until the industry I'm not even kidding

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
this is so fun I love this spam method

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
because I don't actually have to use my brain

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
or be tactical

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
sorry this is a gameplay that I'm here for

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
not having to think

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
not having to think look all of us can just

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
ink and none of us have to think

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
that's the way I like it

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
stop being so blatant

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I've been so blatant recently

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
why am I getting limited ads on some of

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
my streams

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I don't mean this

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
no wonder you like Sigmund Freud

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000

okay I think I've boled

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I think I've bolzed it up

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I've bolzed up my tactic

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
unless the game said

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
sorry I shouldn't use that

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
blasphemous terms

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
uh

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
then again Jesus hung out with slag so

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I won't take any slander

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
that's hilarious

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
stop right stop I'm getting too excited playing this game with you

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I'm actually getting like hype as fuck

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
for playing but not playing at the same time

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
kiss

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I'm not even trying

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
how

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
how

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I'm not even trying

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
how

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I mean I'm loving it I'm here for it

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
if I put the orange theirs are gonna bounce off

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
yeah it bounces off of course it does because why wouldn't it

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
okay okay okay

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
oh no I could have

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
oh no this can't be I messed up

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
but it's okay

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I mess up often but just because you mess up

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
it doesn't mean you're not allowed to keep trying

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
like geez

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
don't judge yourself so heavily remember

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
you look at yourself through a lens heavier

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
than anyone else ever does

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
only you'll notice things that make you cringe

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
but people will never think about it in their life ever again

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
so don't be afraid to be cringe

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
it's okay big bros you can tell

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
me how much you

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
sorry

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
that was so specific

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
right

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
what happens here okay that's fine

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
we can deal with that

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
okay that's fine and then we're gonna put an orange here

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
then we're gonna put

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
a thing

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
literally the big bros been worried about

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
engaging with Amy and I'm like

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
bro I literally made her

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
well I made her lore

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
but everything else she does

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
is by her own accord

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I do not tell the girls to do nothing

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
so

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I don't know why you're cringing

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
be free be yourself

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
to be cringe is to be free unironically

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
as I said you're the only person

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
that will ever care

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and look at yourself through

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
such a severe lens

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
just enjoy life

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
literally unironically you'll know

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
please mr. Apple

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
you do this to me every time

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
you actually do this to me

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
every time I'm starting to think it's

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
are you

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
that can't be right I'm being

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
trolled

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
well someone better

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
start moving because I'm not playing

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
another go

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
someone better start moving

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
because it's no me

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
okay

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
okay

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
aha

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
aha

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I'm in trouble

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
a strover actually

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I do like damn apples

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
oh

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I was actually pretty good

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I'll give you that

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I was actually pretty good

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I blinked in the box got filled

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
these are just high player strats

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
your brain just can't comprehend

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
how MLG Pro

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
what's up scrawny

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
me sucking at this game

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
what's that

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
no stop showing me the rankings

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I'm getting embarrassed how much I'm being

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
outplayed by these rankings seriously

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I mean

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
there's nothing I can do

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I've made everything worse

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
okay

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
right one more give me one more chance

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
surely I can get watermelon

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
before the industry surely

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
no don't play that

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
freaking SFX I don't know fucking far

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
SFX I don't even know what I would call that

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
right

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
this method clearly works I don't care

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
what anyone says oh my god they're stacking

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
so pretty

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I actually enjoyed the way they were stacking

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
just one more just one more

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
give me one more just one

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
more chance

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I don't know the words

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
but don't that's not gonna stop me

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
far

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
hard

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
scored.mp3

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
literally you could have done worse

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
honestly this method works

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I think I just suck that this method

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
works so well for me

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I mean obviously

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
naturally things will start

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
pop a lock in so I guess

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
like it's only bound to happen

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
but it's just like

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
use brain

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
or just have fun

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
spamming

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
and things work out in the end

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
okay maybe not this one the RNG on this one

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
maybe maybe not

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
oh no they oh

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
oh

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
okay I'm happy

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
please get the watermelon I want to sleep

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
no no replaying you can go to sleep

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
there's no way I'm getting the watermelon

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I want the watermelon

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
oh yeah it's all coming together

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
it's working what do you mean

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
okay it kind of

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
doesn't work near the end where I have less room

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
yeah unless like things

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
start doing that then

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I mean things are shuffling about though

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
like maybe I just need to give it time to like

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
talk about

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
well stuff is happening

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
wow

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
like things are

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
popping and locking

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
you know

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
that's what I should do just spam it at the start

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
and then actually try hard at the end

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
being like oh yeah no no I was trying hard in the whole time

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
what are you talking about

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I was trying hard in the whole time

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
this is pure skill

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
sorry I'm watching myself play on OBS

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I'm not even looking forward like this

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I'm like that's not a view

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
who let her cook

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
it's working okay I'm not in the kitchen all the time

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
but it's actually working for real

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
so it's

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
yeah okay it's working until it's not

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
don't play the far I will

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
literally mute the in-game audio

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
don't think I won't

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
maybe spam to halfway or the first pineapple

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
okay okay okay okay I'll hear you

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
I'll hear you that might work

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
right until we get the spam until we

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
get a pineapple

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
okay spam until

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
we get pineapple and then I'll take over

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
and actually use my brain deal

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
deal

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
okay pineapple I'm coming

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
for you

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
RNG gods

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
you better be with me

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
okay they actually

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
kind of are with me for real

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
nothing like accidentally

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
bumping off of each other

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
there's a bump in right we've got

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
cantaloupe we're about to get peach

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
oh until unless I did that

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
then that was a bit selfish of me but hey

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I'm late no don't worry

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm gonna redirect

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
shebeaz away shit

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I'm not gonna redirect I'm redirecting to

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
me even though it's like

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
three hours away

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
it's a zero maybe if a zero's waiting room's

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
off I'll redirect into a zero's waiting

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
room because we're gonna play

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
forever early if she comes online

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
she's not online right now

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
she's passed out sleeping

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
mama azuz currently

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
me me me me

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
me me me

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
maybe I should

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
like let it relax

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
into stuff because I just blocked

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
myself from doing something there and I'm like

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
if I let it relax

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
then

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
yeah

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
also have a collab with AC coming up

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I convinced her to play a puzzle game with me

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
she's like no I don't want to play a puzzle

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
game and I'm like

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
oh but it's easy AC don't worry

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I'll carry you through and she's like

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I'll find them strong

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
even so I've got that

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
to look forward to

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
and then

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I just need to collab with Shebe and

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Emi and then I've at least done a one on one

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
collab with everyone and viewer

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
which was my goal

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
and

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
okay I balls

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
that up no

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
why does it work sometimes

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
and then other times it doesn't

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
things are rubbing and touching

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
but nothing's popping and locking you know what I'm saying

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
wait

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
something's happening whoa

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
okay

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
we're moving

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
now if the peaches can kiss

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
do it kiss right now

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
no it's pure aren't you

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
lowly monster

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
why is AC on the make

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
she's so adorable

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I love her

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
okay okay we got pineapple as I said

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I'm trying to try harder now

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
and orange so we want it to land on top

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
of the apple which of course

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
due to how small brain

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I am that didn't work

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
that's okay

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
now we have an orange

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
next which we're actually

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I think we're forced to play it

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I think we're forced to play it here to make an

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
apple oh no

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
but it's not heavy enough

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
no

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
no

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
please yes okay

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
no what

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I don't think we can do anything

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
I think we're just in trouble

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
oh

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
hold on

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
can I get you to like

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I'm gonna have to put it in the middle

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
if I put

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
an orange

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
here

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
of course it gives me a freaking orange

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
after that are you serious

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
it gives me two

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
the RNG gods clearly

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
hate me it's okay you can

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
see it with your chest

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
right let's try that

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
this isn't gonna work

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
it's ogre

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
it's ogre

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
no why is this game so hard

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
why is this so hard

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
the game just pushed me out

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
no it's gonna play the freaking it

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
right one more try one more try one more try

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
it literally pushed me out

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
any far on me

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
it literally pushed me out

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
apple but I didn't know you had

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
a bikini toggle oh did you just

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
see my short

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I do have a bikini toggle

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
and

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
you guys weren't supposed to know

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
about it until later but I had the key

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
bindings on my keyboard and I

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
flashed stream like twice

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
in a bikini

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
which was ridiculous

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
because everyone was like

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
someone commented they're like oh yeah you totally meant

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
that by mistake

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and I was like no motherfucker

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
if I meant that on purpose

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I would have done it on debut for the easy

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
fucking clips and clicks like

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
you're welcome you know that's when

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
you know it's not fucking staged because I

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
cannot tell you how many vtubers I've seen

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
that staged a debut and then

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
all of a sudden oh no

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
my clothes disappear

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
oh it was an accident

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
and it's like obviously for fucking clicks

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
like doesn't it be so obvious

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I'm sorry

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
but I don't know if it's because I'm Scottish and I'm so cynical

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
sometimes

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
but it's so fucking obvious when someone does that

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
tactic and I'm like bro you're actually

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
you're actually so obvious

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I don't know why we're pretending otherwise

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
fine just say you're doing it for clicks

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
that's how you have you play the freaking

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
like vtuber game

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
like bro

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I just found it it took so long to

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
realise oh you guys don't watch my

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
speaking of Overwatch the new character came out

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
now I don't normally met I don't normally

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I haven't played it this year honestly

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
um

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
that was a primal scream

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
oh I did not mean

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
brainwrote so far by like

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
tiktok acting or something

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
if you're like oh my god you meant that you planned that

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
is called Juno

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
and she's a pilot

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and she's a healer

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
anyone wanna play

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
and I'll be your heal slot

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
outrageous behaviour stop talking

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
right now

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I don't know when she comes out

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
but she got announced

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
um

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
we have a pineapple

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
honestly

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
well I think we can do like 10 lobbies

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
together as well in Overwatch

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
sorry I know people like to shiz on it

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
but I mean

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
it's kind of a good game to stream

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
snipe on

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
did I mess that up? I did

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
that's okay

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
it's okay cause I like ruining the game

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I constantly throw by accident

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
now if you wanted to claim

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I'm thrown on purpose

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I'll say that you've got some merit cause I'm so

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
freaking dumb that I keep doing it

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000

I have four apples

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000

before I start spamming down new stuff

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
oops that was me

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I'm just so silly

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
like that honestly I just love the way I throw this game

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
every time without fail by accident

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I just throw

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
do you just love it when you watch a streamer and she keeps throwing the game

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
honestly it's so satisfying

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
you never find better gameplay

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
when it comes to throwing the me

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
okay we got an orange

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
that's what I want to see

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
orange go down

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
good

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I'm gonna start on this side a bit

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I'm messing this up

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
horrifically

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
another orange

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
oh it pushed it over

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
okay I'm aim bon

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
aim bon oh yeah that's right

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
what are you gonna do about it

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
aim bon

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I'm literally doing a 360 no scope on these fruits

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
don't take a

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
if those could have kissed that might have gone a bit better

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
but hey ho

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
we believe are we gonna score a touchdown

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
kill grape play

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
no no like that

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
praise the sun and the suika

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
is this the run

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I don't know

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I'm try hard and so

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
right I'm gonna get rid of that

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I want an apple there so it's just bing ching

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
now I'm gonna have to throw a little bit

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
to get where I want to go

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
okay

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
put a cherry there

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
and we'll put an orange

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
and then that should turn into an orange

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
oh well this is

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I think I'm gonna have to put this one over here

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
that's fine uh huh

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000

and all the girls stay pretty

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
for a white guy

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
you know it's kind of hard

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
just to get along today

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
shit

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
they asked for a 13 yeah

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
instead they drew a 31

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
they say he's trying too hard

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
and it's not quite him

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
that's a pretty thing

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
give it to me

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
whoo please don't push me out

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
that's not very nice you're giving me a heart attack

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
I'm stressed

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I'm stressed

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I'm stressed I've just resorted to singing now

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
actually stressed in 4k

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
okay

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
uh huh

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
um

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I think I'm out of room

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
and I can't make anything kiss

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
if those peaches could have kissed

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I mean

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
shit

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
that actually wasn't that bad

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
for the last attempt though

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I'm not even mad like I'm not

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
sorry but my chair can't be mad at that

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
yeah

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
there's not much I can do at this stage

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
it's ogre

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
it's actually ogre but

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
god damn did we have a good run

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
yeah god that was a good run

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
and I got second place

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
that was my second place record

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
that was good

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
that was so good

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I'm not even mad

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I'm not even mad I'm raging

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
but I'm not even mad that was so good

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
clap clap clap

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
that was really wasn't that bad

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
right how would I rate suika

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
um

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
if you want my honest opinion

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I'm not gonna be playing this again on stream

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
if you want my honest opinion

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I'm not gonna be playing this off stream either

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
it's fine there's nothing wrong with the game

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
there's absolutely nothing wrong with the game

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
it's just slightly too casual

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I don't know

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I say that as if I don't literally get you carrying me

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
in Elden Ring but

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I have to admit even I'm like

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
I'm squinting me right now

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
I'm squinting me right now

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I'm squinting me right now

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
it'll settle with looking at your premade ones

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
my premade melons how do

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
how do

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
right so sheebie isn't on but emi might be on later

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
let me just check

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I'll redirect into her

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
if she isn't on

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
then I will

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
nope she's not on

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
then Azura I will redirect

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
into Azura's room

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
yes okay she does have it off

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
now we might be an hour early

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
but if she's still asleep then it'll be the usual time

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I know literally sheebie's on vacation

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
so I can't redirect her to her

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
emi's just came back she's getting into the swing of things again

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
there's nothing until you collab with Azura

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
okay yes

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
how are you doing

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
sorry that was a stretch I don't know why I made that so weird

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
maybe I'm just

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I'm a freak

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I'm a weird

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
joke I'm a bit of playdough

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I'm getting ready for carry

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
okay now I'm even freaking got the stream up

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
in the waiting room for it up

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
right I'm gonna redirect into Azura's POV

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
of the collab that's in two hours

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I'm gonna go lie down for a nap

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
mummy did you ever talk about needing permission for a short

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
yes oh right

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
okay so reflins be completely

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and wholeheartedly honest

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
you can either use Marshmallow for feedback or not

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
so on the

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
vealer youtube channel

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
the announcement trailer got 100k views

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
the reason

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
that it got picked up in

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
the algorithm

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
is because it was reported

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
by a news channel which

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
is ran by a male

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
and obviously we follow idle culture

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
now I was going to do a behind the scenes

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
talking about how

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
why your

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
VTuber goes nuts when they make the news

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
is because there's a clear correlation

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
of being on VTuber news

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
and then like the views or whatever

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
now I was gonna do a breakdown

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
short about it however

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I didn't want to do it if it would upset anyone

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
so I do want you to be honest

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I don't want me to talk about it

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I'm more than happy to just

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
bend that short idea

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
but it is talking about VTuber news

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
and in particular one

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
that is ran by a guy

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
which is why the vealer

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
announcement trailer of the agency

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
got trending if you can see on the website

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
it's literally got almost 100k views

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
so I just

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
didn't want to do anything that upsets you guys

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
but I was gonna talk about why your VTuber gets excited

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
and then I was gonna show like correlation between

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
the

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
video getting traction

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
where it got mentioned

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
and then why VTubers are so thankful

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
to be mentioned on the news

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
it's alright wait why would we get upset

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
ran by a guy mail on stream

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I know we're teasing but I just don't want to do

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
anything that would upset you guys

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
but please do use Marshmallow as well

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
if you'd rather give anonymous feedback

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
that's more than anything

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I'm here for you

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
you do you

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
just because it's a bit more of a behind the scenes

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
on the VTuber aspect than it is

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
about anything else of that degree

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
it sounds okay

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
now if I did it

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
anyone would freak out about that has bigger problems

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
person that sounds like I see no issue

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
yeah it's more like a behind the scenes

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
angle it's not like oh my god

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
slob on the knob like it's nothing like that

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
nah I'm the opposite girls

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I want to see men

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
hmm

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
it's okay right as long as you guys are sure

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I'll make sure it's completely

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
above board to the best my ability but again

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
you can use my

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Marshmallow as well for a bit of feedback

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
but it's not focused

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
around that it's the

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
the subject title is

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
why do VTubers get so

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
excited being mentioned in the news

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
and then I was going to explain

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
the Vealer trailer got trending

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
and then I was going to ask some VTubers

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
that have been in the news

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
if they had a correlation

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
as well

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
that knob might sound cool

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
you're overthinking it

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I just don't want to upset anyone

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
what is Marshmallow

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Marshmallow is in the link below

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
in the description below

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
and you can send me anonymous

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
remarks now if you don't have Firefox

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
which has an auto translate thing

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
you can add on

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
it's in Japanese

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
in Japanese

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
so what I'm hearing is

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
if you do something newsworthy

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
and have some evidence that mentions

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Vealer

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
basically Vealer made the news for the first agency

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
and then the trailer

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
got trending because it got mentioned

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
it wasn't trending before

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
originally I was putting advertisement money to show it off

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
but then it wasn't needed

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
go for it the behind the scenes stuff is the best

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
as long as you guys are okay

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I wonder what news it was

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Sky News Australia? No

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I still think there are people who think

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
she talks to Marshmallows during her free time

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I talk to my Marshmallows

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
I read my Marshmallows

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
actually I do have a request for you guys

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
to send me

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
to send me stuff

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
um

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
um

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
um

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
um

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
um

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
what kind of stuff?

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
um

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
when

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I want to make some twitter

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
audios

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
but I need motivation

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
and record again

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
so if you ever wanted to send

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
some stuff

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I mean you can't

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
and then I could use it

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
okay

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I will leave it there

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I'm gonna redirect into Azur's little waiting room

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
please do watch Azur's P.E.O.V

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
um

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
actually you can watch us both at the same time

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
to see what we're dealing with

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I'm an idiot you can literally watch them both at the same time

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
since we're only talking to each other

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
um

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
as long as it's not for Gamba

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
nyaaa

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
what's wrong with Baltro?

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I like Baltro

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Baltro's good

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Baltro good game

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
alright

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I'm not being funny

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
but the girls get

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
so much more hate words

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Marshmallows than I do

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I get like one or two

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
just because I've not been posting on my alt twitter

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I think if I start posting on my alt twitter

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
then

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
you know I'll start to reap the rewards

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
if you will

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
um

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
so give me let me cook

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
I've got a few things cooking

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
but yeah if you wanted to be

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
motivational for no particular reason

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
in like a weeks time

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
feel free to use marshmallows

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I'll keep one on the burger and Gamba

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
and I'll respond to them to get traction

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
how dare you I can't believe it

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
right I'll do a compilation soon TM

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I just can't do it right now

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
cause then you really want to start describing

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
about how I want to be collared and leashed

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
and like walked around like a dog and then my dad's like

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
what are you doing?

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
and I'm like nothing nothing nothing

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
and I'll start like closing down all my tabs in a panic

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
yeah no don't really want to

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
don't really want to do that

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
rather weird rather strange

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
okay

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
um

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
I will redirect into Azura

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
but we're both going to be online at the same time

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
we're either going to be an hour early

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
or the hour specified

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Azura is asleep right now so I'm not going to

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
you know wake up Azura

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I'm not going to be like batter

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
batter entire room like Azura

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
time to do puzzle

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
like no she's asleep

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
if she's asleep she's asleep

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
either regular time or one hour earlier

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
okay but don't worry

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
might not be the hypest thing but honestly

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
pretty coo-ai-ne out there

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
maybe we should do a drunk stream where I can't

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I'm not allowed to go offline until I get a war mill

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
maybe that would be a funnier twist

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
but thank you very much little reeflings

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
