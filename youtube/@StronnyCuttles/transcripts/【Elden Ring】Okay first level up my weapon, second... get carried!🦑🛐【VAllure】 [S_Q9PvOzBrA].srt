1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,760
I've done something, I've done something I shouldn't have done, okay, oh shit, I should

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,480
have shot them, sorry, I'm going to be in a game, I'm going to hit the frat one thing

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,240
and I've just gone off of it, like a dumb boom

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,440
okay, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,600
good morning, good evening, good afternoon, my name is Dronecuddles and I'm here to try and

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,240
entertain you to the best of my ability, all things considered, um, I may or may not have

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,600
only had four hours of sleep because I have issues sleeping at the moment, okay, there's a bit

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:14,560
of a swap today, um, I do not have an intention today of streaming 12 hours, oh what, it's not

9
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,960
sustainable if you can't get sleep, oh well, now that I've learned that, yeah, actually you're kind

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,120
of right, reeflings, oh no, uh, you actually need to unironically, apartment a bed, um,

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,320
I did not get much sleep, so I have decided instead of doing endurance, kind of, you know, fly

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,040
through the DLC, I would very much like to get the coconuts with you, so I've able to source

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
where the, um, the coconuts, which is, hello, please help, thank you, wonderful, apologies,

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,160
you're beautiful, let's go, and my beloved, I cannot source the location of the DLC Pratt,

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,200
they're called Prattles, I believe, no, they're called a Prattling Patez, but we all know it's a

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,680
coconut, let's be honest, why no sleep, uh, look on what's been uploaded, that's why no sleep,

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
I started working on another audio, and I've an announcement, Patreon is getting fed the

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:27,840
moment I go offline, uh, my plot is pit, job, my armpit, the plot is my armpit, okay, and then

19
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,840
we're writing the fourth plot live so you guys can literally see how, like, the script, and then

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
you'll hear the finished edit, like, result type thing, but, uh, yeah, for some reason, I picked

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,840
armpit, I can't even remember what you even said in the script, but, um, you got to sleep and drop

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,520
the bread for, I'm still a biohazard at the moment as well, um, all I produced was a singular little,

23
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:03,600
you know, one could argue it was the size of a gold nugget, um, but I would very much like to do

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
the crack, crack, the prattling coconut, sorry, my brain isn't here, I'm, I do apologize, let's

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,160
have four hours, I was like, I'm doing stuff, I'm currently waiting on a fucking contract, um,

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,000
from a bloody company, so I've got the girl's good news, and they're just, they're fucking

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
being at all their sweet time, like, they're in no rush to seal the deal, whereas I'm like, this is

28
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,880
an, wait, what, my mouse and my, oh, okay, my, uh, like, this is a big deal for the girls,

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,480
because it's yet another revenue income, so, blah, blah, blah, I know, boring, boring, boring,

30
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,800
business, business, business, that's what it's like behind the scenes, it's all boring, boring,

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:55,520
boring, business, business, business, okay, located in Stormfoot Catacombs, which is in the cliff

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:04,480
side, northwest of the church of Ella, why is my cursor, is the church down here, yeah, okay,

33
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
the first coconut is to the left, of course you guys are more than welcome to stream snap, let's

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,760
be honest, oh, maybe I should change the name of the stream, people are gonna be like, oh, I'm

35
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,840
leveling up the L3, so I can play with her, okay, hold on, let me get my pizza, but yes, it's gonna

36
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:30,240
be a two hour stream, I have a collab tomorrow as well with Yumi Plus, and hold on, I'm gonna do a

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,320
coconut little, little coconut gathering, and I'm gonna like do it in green, because we are harvesting,

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:55,200
like real farmers, I'm literally just gonna be doing nice and easy today, two hours, I'm redirected

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:04,720
into Shibi, she's doing a drawing stream, because Shibi has some doodling art, I'm pretty sure,

40
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,840
just show me her art, am I going first? No, I don't think she showed me her art in an interview,

41
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,760
but she does, she's able to do stuff, can we have the three reflands on a beach with coconut trees,

42
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,760
okay, the first, hello, prattling, no, we're gonna try and do that, if we've got enough time,

43
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,200
obviously, I think we may or may not blast through these catacombs, but as long as we've all got the

44
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:43,600
same coconut, that's amazing, I had something to tell you that was exciting, out of the ASMR

45
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,920
collab, and I've already forgotten, hello, yes, that's the one we're going for, okay, we need to

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,120
locate it at Stormford Catacombs, which is the closest just north west of the church, we are

47
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,200
going to take that very literally, and just jump over here and look for a cavern this way, I can't

48
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,680
jump, okay, sorry, okay, hold on, I need to go around, sorry, that's embarrassing, I can't make that

49
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:18,000
jump, I'm too weak, I'm too weak, right, north west, oh, we have our head and we've got a beacon,

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the ASMR collab was really good, I loved it, it's not putting much, it's so early, it's too strong,

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
bro, it's literally my favorite, oh, are these guys that tell you where the Prattland coconut's at?

52
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520
Can we get down here safely? I'm not sure about, wait, that was a bird, I thought it was a reefland

53
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,640
that just launched themselves, I'm like, ain't not a bit early to be launching ourselves off a

54
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:53,040
cliff first thing in the morning, and I believe AC had concluded an ASMR stream today, I love how

55
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,360
you guys literally like the beacons that go on door, I'm just following, I'm like okay, I'm here

56
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:11,200
for war, what's going on? I have good news and bad news, bad news, Emmy's away on holiday, good news

57
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,160
is I can edit Emmy and AC's collab together, because I've got all the pieces of the Puzzlemer,

58
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
wow, okay, we're here, we're here, oh no, I'm gonna have to resummon you all,

59
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,440
wait, that doesn't count, wait, okay, maybe I need to be a big girl and travel on my own,

60
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,760
and then summon inside the cavern, literally clapping like yeah, we have to go already,

61
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:39,440
you literally just got in, Emmy gone for two, now there is content for Emmy, I've got plans

62
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
that there's gonna be like something every three days, at least whether that's a short,

63
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,480
look how dark inside it gets when my refunds leave, I hear it here, okay, so there's a

64
00:07:50,480 --> 00:08:03,920
prattling coconut in here, just summon a singular gate, oh is there a hit 5k, that's fantastic,

65
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,480
I think AC's literally about to do it around the corner, oh no, this can't be, wait, can I not hire

66
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:22,640
you guys, hire, I really hope this next game has seamless co-op, if only, that's asking for too

67
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,480
much, hold on a minute, that's asking for a bit too much, you mean you want help to play your

68
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:37,680
FromSoft game, hmm, no, unlikely, you're not allowed to, you will be given 20% less damage,

69
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,960
boss gets 20% more, and you're freaking healing flasks to nothing,

70
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,120
when do we expect the collab, so some, if you want to know the behind the scenes,

71
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
oh fuck, that's what I need you guys for, holy shit, how could I forget,

72
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,520
reeflings, all we need holders rise up, there's been a bit of an update

73
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:11,040
that may or may not shape what happens with gen 2, but what happens in here stays in here,

74
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,040
did I make myself clear, you guys have done fantastic, I'm pretty sure no one's done anything major,

75
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I need, I need influence, I need interest and I need descriptions, I need attributes of some

76
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,400
milf body type and a lollipop body type, I need some sort of influence, there's been a bit of

77
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:49,840
development, and two designs have been rejected in both categories, and I'm needing to start somewhere

78
00:09:49,840 --> 00:10:00,320
fresh, now I did think harpy, harpy with a knee hands and wings instead, which is a bit advanced

79
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
for a modler to be honest, she'd probably end up being the most expensive to rejuice,

80
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,560
I snapped her attention at reeflings, dragon, oh that's right, sorry, dragon and then the color scheme

81
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,320
was based after the big dragon and avatar, she's definitely like possessive,

82
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:33,760
and calls fan base her treasures possibly, that's a good one, I wrote that down, yeah remember

83
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,320
that, okay, we're also consider a harpy, maybe she's egg obsessed, I'm actually kind of down with

84
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:51,920
an egg obsessed lollipop harpy, maybe she would call her fan base like, oh what would you, egg,

85
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,760
eggie, maybe call them, how about a female knight in armor, see the major thing about armor is the

86
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,400
pride, is can no one, can I not summon in here, sorry, can I not summon in here, hold on a minute,

87
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,000
I ain't laughing no more, no one's summonable, nestlings, hatchlings, yeah that kind of thing,

88
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:19,760
maybe we can kind of go the eggbound route, hatchling, right so we've got dragon and harpy

89
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,840
for a little bit more body type, so they don't have an interest in a lollipop cheerleader,

90
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:35,520
number one, bimbo lollipop cheerleader or bimbo milk cheerleader,

91
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,400
so bimbo cheerleader and then I'm going to put candy roll from kung fu keel,

92
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:02,080
did you activate the summoning, oh did I nullify it, oh I nullified it, sorry,

93
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,640
wait I heard that, oh no no no, okay there we go, right, oh no,

94
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,200
um alamia milk,

95
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,920
rushing under the gate, um alamia milk, come on, let me, we need pointed side ears,

96
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm going to put that there and line me up for a mouth, because I like the pointed side ears and

97
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,680
I like the, you know the teeth and you know how it goes, like alamia milk, technical related,

98
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,240
I think the odds are I may or may not be getting some sort of technical alternative of the future,

99
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,080
if you want a bimbo cheerleader, um look at Nike,

100
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:56,240
and a harpy milk, actually you're fucking right, everyone goes harpy we won, but no one goes harpy

101
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,960
big yin, you're actually right, harpy milk, like and she would be clumsy, she'd be calling,

102
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:14,080
she'd be clumsy, harpy milk, hmm and then maybe her stick can be, she's always egg burning,

103
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,360
you need to help her lay eggs, like a freak, so then there's people on a birth, yeah you're

104
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,640
fucking welcome, I even consider you, you're welcome, okay let's see what the deal is,

105
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,880
whoa, okay we're going swinging,

106
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,800
yeah yeah yeah, I'm here to entertain all, don't say, don't say I don't feed you well over here,

107
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,280
when any other agency would reject you, they hated him, they hated her, because she spoke

108
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,960
the truth about the value of it, having true diversity, when it comes to an array of um,

109
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,920
alternative content, it's funny just because you're vanilla, or you shouldn't, wait,

110
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,080
did you not watch the membership stream, oh crap hold on,

111
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
okay thank god I'm one shotting,

112
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:16,080
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, wow why is there so much fire,

113
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
oh yeah I'm back here,

114
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,960
oh we already did it, oh okay that one went by very quickly, right we'll finish the dungeon though,

115
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,440
we'll finish the dungeon though, um okay that was a lot quicker than I thought, obviously because

116
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,760
we're like mega overpowered here, and the reflins are doing it all for us, oh there's one more,

117
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,400
uh strone, it's because if only you knew, oh no, oh no this can't be,

118
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,320
uh right is anyone got any milf suggestions that I can work on,

119
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,920
uh I think I'm gonna see if I can get that dragon,

120
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,480
out of all, I'm feeling the dragon the most on the missing section,

121
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,040
what you're completely leaking any development plans, nope that's not how it works, it's not how

122
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:21,120
it works, I am literally all six girls at the agency, why do you think my voice is sore, I just

123
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:33,600

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,720
impaler's hathacones, which is northeast, northeast shore of the weeping peninsula,

weeping peninsula, they're just here to catch me, I swear to god we're in the space, go to

149
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:14,720
where on earth south of the map castle mourn rampart, south of the map castle mourn rampart,

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:30,320
going to maintain this voice so I am easily accessible to everyone who listens, yeah, a bit of a,

152
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,160
a bit of a ditzy English wife moment, don't you want to wife me, I'm so English, I love the way

153
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,280
the British empire crumbled, even though it put sentry, why the fuck did you crumble it, you had

155
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:59,760
can't be spun in, oh no, what is she saying, what do you think of my dark elf, oh man,

156
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,160
melfer pop, if you see a suggestion say melfer pop so I can visualize it in my head

157
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:17,520
with my little thumb print, I regret what I have done exactly, don't ever, don't ever

158
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,400
ask for a different accent again, I'm just kidding, you're not in trouble, but if you were you'd be

159
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:36,560
bent over my knee right now, pop, pop, pop, is there only one good refling, only one good

160
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:44,880
refling to chit chat to chit chat to, wow, I'm sorry, a little mushroom, lollipop, funny you

161
00:20:44,880 --> 00:21:07,520
mentioned that, that's really, uh right I'm just, I'm just envisioning in my head

162
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:16,240
what, with your suggestions, I think right bimbo tier leader is out, although that's kind of that,

163
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,120
the window to opi loli, oh pe, well who the fuck, oh pe, pe ie, lollipop,

164
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,160
Celtic warrior, I have terrible news, I'm the Celtic warrior, I'd be the one that fit that the best,

165
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,920
oh shit you just taken one, oh wow you walloping his ass, I'm helping, I'm helping

166
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,960
oh shit he's still alive, oopsies, I thought once he's knocked off that, let me let me drink

167
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,320
the milf anglerfish, well I was just thinking if we did a milf lamia and obviously they would

168
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,840
have to be, oh I just spawned them in game, I just spawned them in, get me my reflings back,

169
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,360
right now I'm too scared for one more, even though I'm like super level, like I'm, I think I'm

170
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,800
exponentially leveled up right now, a southern bell milf, I see that, the problem with those

171
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,600
kind of things is you'd need someone to fill the role and I have to admit we were playing it very

172
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:32,800
risky having a zeroes design created, because someone has to fill a role and if you're looking for

173
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:40,880
like a southern sweetheart actor, oh it's my cherry pie, oh my cherry pie, like and then you

174
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:48,640
then you get a cherry pie that applies, it's like oh you're up shit for me, dark elf milf, I'd even

175
00:22:48,640 --> 00:23:06,240
fill the role for you, have I, I'd actually, I think this, dark elf milf, what's her angle,

176
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,280
will you need me to give me more, what's the dark elf angle other, other than she looks fucking,

177
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
I want to rub oil all over her and lick it off manually,

178
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,000
okay do you know where to go, I actually don't know where to go, sorry let me check it out,

179
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,200
located in the impaler's catacomb, right, impaler's catacomb, okay I've definitely not

180
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,640
discovered what the heck it is then, do you know where to take me, do you have impaler's catacomb on

181
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:45,680

183
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,960

184
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:07,040
messing up, excuse me, what did he say, okay I hope that's like a, how do you call it, right

185
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:18,800
there's something up here, something up here, okay I'm super overleveled, I'm super overleveled,

186
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,720
I don't need to be scared, I am super overleveled, I do not need to be scared,

187
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,400
the reeflings are gonna help me and then I'll be prepared, oh Mr. Reefling, hold my hand,

188
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:42,800
bum bum bum bum, I hope you don't mind my sweaty fucking hands, bum bum bum bum, they don't stop

189
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,360
sweating, it's kinda embarrassing, you can actually get both hooks in your hands if it's a bed,

190
00:24:49,600 --> 00:25:00,000
bum bum bum bum, if you did an angler fish, literally hook, line and sinker on our forehead

191
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,680
would be quite a funny moat, have I got you yet, hook, line and sinker,

192
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,200
that's what the moat or the angler fish would be, where the fuck am I going,

193
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,480
wait I think I've actually downly discovered it, hold on wait guys I'm getting on my memory,

194
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm getting on my memory, have I been here before, well I've not been here in this game,

195
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,960
surely my rawtism your honor, oh my god I'm actually so smart, I'm actually so smart,

196
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,720
I've been a whole freaking year, get me in here, okay if you technically make a, if you technically

197
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,160
make a velar girl you can link your stories because also a hard piece thing to make fishermen think,

198
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,920
no I do not like, I fucking, do not, hold on let me finish this,

199
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,160
um I, wait why would it be nullified, there's someone here, well Jen too,

200
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,520
have someone who's good at singing, actually some of the girls are looking to develop,

201
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:13,680
they're, they're singing, geez reefland, um I, I'm not going to specifically hire someone just

202
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,280
because they can sing because at the end of the day you gotta be a drummer and you gotta be able

203
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,120
to give us the notes while you, oh you know when you have your little firework at the end of the day

204
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,280
um that's where we need the, the pipes to come in, that's when we need the pipes to come in so

205
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,720
you know just because you can sing it doesn't mean you're getting in, you know what I'm saying, like

206
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,120
yeah, yeah I mean it's cool and all but like, now the, now what would be interesting is if you

207
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,800
know how to do parody songs and shit, that is different, it's, wow, oh I missed, I missed that

208
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,440
so embarrassed, okay we're super leveled up, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, we're super leveled up,

209
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,040
um yes if someone applied then they're like hey I do like parodies, I know how to write them, I

210
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,760
know how to edit them, then that is a very big asset um because not only could I help promote

211
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,680
them like their own content, like I can put like money into their parodies, I can put money into

212
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
like whatever they do type thing so it's really good like a different advertising type thing for

213
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,560
them whereas like if you're like yeah I can sing but I actually don't know how to like

214
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,080
make parodies in it or that kind of thing, that's like oh well you can do song covers,

215
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,480
don't get me wrong, that's good and all but it's quite valuable being able to kind of

216
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,640
have more of a skill set beyond I can sing, is that, I don't, oh no are we in trouble,

217
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:53,520
we're playing, we're playing, I wasn't prepared, what do we do, we play wait we go underneath

218
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:08,400
what, oh what are you doing, we go whoa whoa wait whoa what do we do, oh no

219
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:18,800
is this the troll room, are we being trolled right now, down, down, down we go down me, oh no, okay hold on

220
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,800
oh everything you're suspecting, no farmer's slave girl, are you joking me, I can't tell if

221
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:38,400
you're trolling or not, what you want someone that is like a fucking, what, what part are you

222
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,880
supposed to, to exactly, oh we got him, we got him, we got him, we got the coconut, uh but

223
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,360
coconut, uh but coconut, okay we already got the second one, oh my god there's so many items here

224
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,640
to scavenge, are you a fake wolf, no you're real,

225
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,320
mommy's dying, no there's a lot more going in place, I'm, I think, uh

226
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:17,200
there's a lot more coming up, um I'm gonna get feedback from the girls very soon TM if they

227
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,520
think they'd benefit from like a manager type thing, obviously, oh my god people and there's

228
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,240
so many, just climb, just climb, just climb, there's so many, they keep coming, um a pirate, no we're

229
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,200
not doing pirate, I'm so out of it, fucking, Mercy got memed on at one point for being a pirate, I'm

230
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,600
like oh my god, I think she's got both of her eyes relaxed, it's what she could be in the dark

231
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
right

232
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,840
yes I'm gonna see if the girls think they'll benefit from a manager, but the thing is because we're

233
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,360
so hands off, it's like well what do you need to manage, you get to dictate all your games,

234
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,600
you get to dictate all your streams, you get to dictate absolutely everything you do, the only,

235
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,760
and hell you can even write scripts if you want, if you hate the scripts you're being provided with,

236
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,640
like it's kind of that scenario where it's like a manager normally will like tell you what to do

237
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,280
and it's kind of like well we've actually done the opposite of that on purpose, why is there baby

238
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:23,120
gargoyles as well, that's cheating, oh that's so creepy, please don't do that again, you understand

239
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,960
me, oh okay that's fine, it's fine, I'm a brave, I'm a brave soldier, mummy's bravest warrior,

240
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,760
mummy's bravest warrior, okay okay we're good, we're good, okay thank you for your service,

241
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,680
okay we've already got the second one, let's go, an ex Nazgul rider, okay now you've got my

242
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,600
attention, now you speak in lord of the rings, no I'm not fucking getting she love commissioned,

243
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,560
we can't do insects, I'm happy to tell you the insider and all the things but if you

244
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,080
fucking become an insect like I'm sorry but you're just, you're kind of nerfing yourself because

245
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,880
people genuinely have like insane arachnophobia and stuff and again like if you're a VTuber that

246
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,360
only has one eye, like a mono eye or like like 18 billion eyes on your model, again people don't

247
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:17,520
like that, I saw how brains work, right thank you, uh tomb ward catacomb, located in catacomb in the

248

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,280
um more fish themed girl, leave math fishy to see out of this, right sorry what was in the

252
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:01,440
uh in the cliff south of the church in south of the church

253
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,360
bug lovers are like 0.1% yeah it's like I don't want to give someone something I think would

254
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,520
actually severely nerf them or doesn't have like the cliff south of the church

255
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,880

257
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,480
an extremely controlling AI moment um actually I'll let you on the inside your knowledge

258
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,120
having AI or anything close to it design wise where you'd actually tag it as AI

259
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,400
eh your content gets nerfed into the ground so don't we're there heck are you going behind that tree

260
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240

263
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,440
create and come up with a unique fantasy creature oh god no it's so it's one thing to commission

264
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,000
inspiration is a whole other kind of fish to commission something that has not even been

265
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,840
concepted before that is when you're like you are asking for like hell on earth development

266
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,520
um absolute heck on earth development

267
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,280
sorry I'm just looking at the notes you guys are giving me a roman matron very elegant

268
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,000

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,960
we can't for anyone who is lurking and you're like why does the agency not bring on IPs

321
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,800
I would never actually want someone to sell me the IP because that is yours it should belong to you

322
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,480
and I don't think and I know some people like well you can just do basic adoption IP you have to

323
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,280
hand over so many rights because in theory if you come aboard but you still own your IP I then

324
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,400
have to ask you to get promotional art of you like to do promotional things with your character

325
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,720
does they make sense can he make sense in like the way the business is set up so honestly just

352
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,800
um

353
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,200
would I say emmy was concepted to be

354
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,040
her mother

355
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,240
I would see

356
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,520
I would actually say they're actually both of them concepted to be

357
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,480
subbed with a few barriers in the way how about we say that so

358
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,760
and emmy doesn't necessarily like anyone outside of her big brother and she's very subdued

359
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,680
um when she gets access to you um I don't I don't know if I said this you know her banner on

360
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,160
twitter the one where she's hugging the hoodie so that's your hoodie and her book is open she

361
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:41,360
basically just communed with you and um whilst you're hoodie um because she still has the ability

362
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,880
to talk to you even though you're dead through the book and through like her her powers that she's

363
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,400
gaining over time like she's a she's you're still able to talk to one another like

364
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,280
I don't know I'm only seeing six I mean if you

365
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,520
that's how you feel she she and if that's how you feel I'm gonna argue thank you for getting me

366
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,600
and her 2.0 it has her wear in the big brochure yes if you didn't know the hoodie that emmy wears

367
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,280
and her fresh jays are actually your clothes because she wants to be closer to you at all times

368
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:35,840
and um she had to stitch back whoa who's farting a storm up in here um she after your little incident

369
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:42,480
with that went terribly wrong she stitched back your hoodie um okay both of us missed that was

370
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,680
rather embarrassing um and that's why her hoodie has little stitch marks and stuff all over it

371
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:55,760
and then those are your fresh jeans um yeah a dummy orc lady

372
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:09,520
so I do like that I don't know if giving a green skin to someone is the wisest of ideas

373
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,200
okay where are we going did they go the wrong way

374
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,840
you that was an honest mistake oh no we're here we're here you did it we fling you did it you

375
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:28,640
gated me okay inside is the wonderful coconut no don't whimper because you have to go it's fine

376
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:37,040
wait how are you whimpering while you do that move away him dummy blue troll a muscle girl

377
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:45,600
uh I did have her concept but her design got rejected by me I'm happy to talk about it um

378
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,880
if the concept artist is happy I'm waiting on the other concept artist to give me a few things

379
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:04,400
at the moment um but she's been a bit radio silent um and I'm not really sure what

380
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,360
right I'll see if any of you guys can spawn in but I don't know like because I'm like

381
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,960
insanely over leveled or something the game's just like uh yeah you don't need anyone in

382
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,000
I'll see if anyone pops up maybe I'll just hire Shrek stop that's what I'm saying like I don't I

383
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,440
wouldn't want to give someone a green skin like I think someone's like oh by a lollipop fucking

384
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,600
goblino and I'm like you're I want to give models that will give people success I don't want to

385
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,480
hand over models where I'm like oh my god I actually don't think you have a good angle here you know

386
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,640
when you say a design is rejected what does that mean it means I've given a prompt to the concept

387
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:56,800
artist the concept artist has given me something either I want to develop further but then as the

388
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:05,280
renditions kept happening nothing was it didn't go the way it just wasn't working out so um that's

389
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,560
a rejection when I when I say like okay do not develop any further this isn't working out that's

390
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:18,320
a rejection I've also done a straight up rejection where um a concept has been given um and I didn't

391
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:26,320
I was I wasn't interested in developing it at all because it just was not doing anything now this is

392
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:34,000
where the two concept artists come together because one is male one is female and I actually think

393
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,160
that's a really important development factor because oh male guys female guys blah blah blah

394
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,800
but it's important to see how two people can take the same concept and end up with something different

395
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,120
an ax a little girl I'm pretty sure there's an ax a little girl in another agency oh I heard that

396
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,320
isn't it how only one oh sorry I just said then people do love goblin girls I know but

397
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,840
I'm going to be honest if I signed up for an agency and they handed me a fucking green little

398
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,920
goblin girl I have and then I got to see my other gen mates designs I have to admit I think I'd be

399
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:25,040
pretty salty the Loch Ness monster you'd need a you'd need a scott wait finally they come through

400
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:34,800
oh for goodness sorry I keep sitting down sorry sorry wait can I get you can I get you an eight

404
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,320
goddess of destruction is there is kind of a part I'm not really wanting to feel opposite

405
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,400
I don't want to give a design where it's like all these girls are intertwined because of

406
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,840
some hams you know some hams and I don't want like the girls to be intertwined like lower-wise

407
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:22,720

You're beautiful!

550
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,540
Located in the southwest side of the hermit village.

551
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:11,540
Hermit village, any hermit villagers?

01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,540
So, hermit village.

556
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,540
Hermit village?

557
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,540
Hold on.

558
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,540
Uh, hermit village, northeast of the craft.

559
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,540
Man's shack?

560
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,540
Is this the wrong one?

561
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,540
Southeast of Volcano Manor.

562
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,540
Southeast of Volcano Manor.

563
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,540
Hermit village is in the swamp.

564
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,540
It's in Mill, Gilmore, west of the map.

565
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,540
Where I've not explored yet.

566
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,540
Like this?

567
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,540
Is it where I've not explored?

568
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,540
What about an angel lollipop?

569
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,540
Kind of defeats the purpose.

570
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,540
Defeats the purpose of wee bit.

571
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,540
Yeah, you didn't reach it yet.

572
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,540
Okay, okay, okay.

573
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,540
There's only one thing for it then, lads.

574
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:23,540
You guys are going to be walking me where we need to go.

575
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,540
What have I got so far?

576
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,540
I've got a lamia, but I'm going to have to be honest.

577
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,540
I think Dark Elf Milf has beaten her.

578
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,540
A milf, hard-faced, since it's always done the opposite.

579
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:44,540
But I don't know how that would play out.

580
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,540
I've got a blacksmith muscle milf.

581
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,540
I have a plant pheromone milf.

582
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,540
And for lollipop, I have a possessive dragon.

583
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,540
Then...

584
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:02,540
No, I had a harpy, but I think I'm getting that riddle.

585
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,540
And then I've got a cheerleader opi, but...

586
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,540
I can't really see it.

587
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,540
Sorry, my notes are down to the left here.

588
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,540
The tracking went off.

589
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,540
How did the fairy get rejected?

590
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,540
I can't really see it.

591
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,540
Why?

592
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,540
I think we just have to...

593
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:32,540
I'm happy to show the behind the scenes once everyone is out and shown and all of that.

594
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,540
And the girls can probably talk about it.

595
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,540
I look like this.

596
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,540
But I could have looked like this.

597
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,540
This is my original concept.

598
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,540
My prompt got completely changed.

599
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,540
AC's prompt got completely changed.

600
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:51,540
She was actually supposed to be a neat gamer.

601
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,540
And her name was going to be Joystick with an eye.

602
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,540
I know, I don't know why, but...

603
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,540
What about a lollipop with a rat queen?

604
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,540
Wait a second, what? The blacksmith was half-orc.

605
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,540
So she didn't really have green-green skin.

606
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,540
But she still has muscle.

607
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,540
I don't know, I'm going to submit the ideas to the concept art.

608
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,540
See what it comes up with.

609
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,540
And we'll see.

610
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,540
Stop you! Stop you!

611
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,540
Covering before me or whimpering.

612
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,540
Pick your poison, whimper or cower.

613
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,540
Hopefully you guys know where we're going, but I'll just take your word.

614
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,540
Let's get to it, to it.

615
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,540
Let's get this party started.

616
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,540
Let's get them 40's popping.

617
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,540
Let's break their poison, miss them.

618
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,540
Oh, they can't handle our damage.

619
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,540
When we start swinging,

620
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,540
our swords do all the thinking.

621
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:49,540
These enemies like to be with me.

622
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,540
I suck on their...

623
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,540
Their...

624
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,540
Their souls.

625
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:59,540
We buy crab sticks,

626
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,540
and we pay no rent.

627
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,540
The world's gone on fire.

628
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,540
The air-trees wait.

629
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,540
I can't do it anymore, it's too hard.

630
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,540
I'm trying to swing into it, but it's hard.

631
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,540
No, MC Stoney in the house.

632
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,540
Cotton bum used to look so chubby in her design.

633
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,540
What was she supposed to see?

634
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,540
So she was always going to be a bunny rabbit.

635
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,540
And we...

636
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,540
We knew we wanted our body type that was a considered alternative.

637
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,540
Because every agency, you look, everyone's a stick.

638
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,540
So we were like, right, we're going to have at least one design that ain't a stick.

639
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:42,540
Like the default stick type thing.

640
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,540
Which we did get.

641
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,540
And if you didn't know, I see an Emmy.

642
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,540
Emmy's Patan.

643
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,540
But she's actually quite flat in the hips as well.

644
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,540
That's on purpose.

645
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,540
Whereas AC, I mean, she's all hips.

646
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,540
Like we wanted variant body type.

647
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,540
Whoa!

648
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,540
Hold on.

649
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,540
We got some spanking to do.

650
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,540
We got some...

651
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,540
Hello?

652
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,540
Has he targeted me? I don't know, can I spank him?

653
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,540
No, I don't know.

654
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,540
Hold on.

655
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,540
Are you aiming for the refling under the map right now?

656
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,540
Where the heck is he?

657
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:30,540
Whoa, yeah, where's the Tabarina guy?

658
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,540
I'm helping, I'm helping.

659
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,540
I'm doing nothing, I'm doing nothing.

660
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,540
But I'm helping.

661
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,540
Where is he?

662
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,540
I don't know where the main boss is.

663
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,540
Literally not even in the fight because I don't know where the boss is.

664
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,540
As if he pulled me.

665
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,540
Oh, that's one of these.

666
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,540
Oh, I did just buy that.

667
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,540
Oh, yeah!

668
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,540
Jeez, I'm not dealing with him.

669
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,540
Oh, there he is, there he is, I found him.

670
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:09,540
What do you mean it's not this big glowing man?

671
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,540
Oh, that was freaking heal.

672
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,540
Don't you blow that horn!

673
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,540
Don't you blow that horn!

674
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,540
Wait, it's done.

675
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,540
Whoa, where did you guys come from?

676
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,540
Oh, we got a death root, I can feed it to the dog.

677
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,540
I guess we'll just keep going because these guys just keep going.

678
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:40,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't know where to go.

679
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,540
Was it that thing back there?

680
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,540
I'm pretty sure I saw it, hold on.

681
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,540
Hold on, let me get on, let me get on Mio's.

682
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,540
Let me get on Mio's.

683
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,540
Ooh, something's making noise.

684
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,540
This guy.

685
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,540
Show me the way.

686
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,540
A pixie would be cool.

687
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:07,540
The collabs, she's like literally just a tiny thing in the corner

688
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,540
that would actually put comical.

689
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,540
Up the hill?

690
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,540
Up the hill in between north and west, okay.

691
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,540
A pixie?

692
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,540
I can't say I've ever seen a pop lamio.

693
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,540
Ah, he's going to put, maybe.

694
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,540
And she'd have a wee, tiny tail.

695
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,540
Honestly, that'd be pretty cute.

696
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,540
I'm sorry, that'd be adorable.

697
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,540
Wait.

698
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,540
Oh, there's a great sight.

699
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,540
Hello.

700
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,540
Oh, okay, okay.

701
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,540
What was it like?

702
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:20,540
Oh, well, we're going to keep on, keep on moving up.

703
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,540
Is this it?

704
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,540
Okay, this looks like I've ever seen one.

705
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:39,540
Right, I think I've got some suggestions to work on.

706
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,540
Eh, doing a little cringey prompt thing.

707
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,540
Wait, I don't need to do that.

708
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,540
Nullified.

709
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,540
Okay, I'm in wide-harm cackles.

710
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,540
Is that where I'm supposed to be?

711
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,540
I hope I'm supposed to be.

712
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,540
A salamander girl?

713
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,540
You a salamander?

714
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
A salamander?

715
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
A big Sally?

716
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,540
Call her Sally the salamander.

717
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,540
Everyone will remember her name real easy.

718
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
In kind.

719
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,540
A cyclope for all?

720
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,540
No, absolutely not.

721
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:26,540
Eh, real one of each of us have two fucking eyeballs.

722
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,540
That's literally it.

723
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:32,540
It is very, like, if you do not just straight up have a face,

724
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,540
it, like, you know, you use some alternative type stuff.

725
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,540
Eh, but Mercy has two eyes.

726
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,540
Shut the fuck up, Mercy has two eyes.

727
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,540
Stop arguing with me.

728
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,540
Where you got, what are you...

729
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,540
Wait, I'm in the wrong place?

730
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,540
Oopsies, I'm in the wrong place, sorry.

731
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,540
Okay, let's try that again.

732
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,540
I'm in the wrong place.

733
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,540
I'm being sent away.

734
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:57,540
I'm being excreted from these purses.

735
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,540
I'm in the wrong place.

736
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,540
No, let's go up right here.

737
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,540
I feel like I'm on my way.

738
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,540
It's all the way to the left, I guess?

739
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:31,540
Sorry, I may be, uh, being a bit Papiga as I usually am.

740
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

741
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:43,540
I think I've gone the complete wrong way.

742
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:51,540
I've gone the complete wrong way or have I missed on this?

743
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,540
I'm being reassigned.

744
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:59,540
Sorry, I think I need to go back if there's nothing here.

745
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,540
Oh, I think I've gone the wrong way.

746
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,540
Are you squiddling me right now?

747
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,540
You are just like my GF.

748
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,540
She hides in the back while I do all the work.

749
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:15,540
Then says, we did it after I'm done defeating the boss.

750
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:19,540
Myself, hand over mouth, hand over mouth, hand over mouth.

751
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,540
Hand over mouth.

752
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,540
What, you just let my girlfriend, she hides in the back while I do all the work.

753
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,540
Oh, right, okay, I get it now.

754
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,540
Look, princess carrying through games is universal experience, okay?

755
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,540
Thank you for the five kill more, combine.

756
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:36,540
I get it now, I get it now, but it's fucking true though.

757
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,540
Sorry, let me reread the location.

758
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:44,540
Located, uh, in milk game more.

759
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:50,540
Wait, did I not get a grace site?

760
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,540
Did I not get a grace site?

761
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,540
Is this the one?

762
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,540
Fuck it, we're going in deep.

763
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:59,540
I'm going horseback, baby.

764
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,540
Yeah, this is milk.

765
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:07,540
So then we're going to keep going north and see what happens.

766
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:12,540
There must be a shack ahead.

767
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,540
Stinky poopies.

768
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,540
Ow!

769
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,540
Oh, I'm so sorry, Viman.

770
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,540
Sorry, Torren, I'm a terrible right.

771
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,540
I actually don't have my license.

772
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,540
I'm sorry, I just ride a bike usually.

773
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,540
I'm not used to this.

774
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,540
Ah!

775
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,540
See, is there only one?

776
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,540
Yeah, okay.

777
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:35,540
Whoa, I hear something.

778
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,540
What is it?

779
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:44,540
A bug!

780
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,540
What's up ahead?

781
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,540
I don't recall.

782
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:50,540
I see enemies, I see a lot of enemies.

783
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:56,540
I see enemies.

784
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,540
Save point.

785
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:03,540
Castello.

786
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:07,540
Is that you?

787
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,540
Can you please hurry?

788
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,540
Can you please hurry?

789
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,540
The void people are there?

790
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,540
Oh my God.

791
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,540
Oh my God.

792
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,540
Oh, there's another one.

793
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,540
Get away.

794
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,540
Get away, you bum.

795
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,540
Get away, you bum.

796
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,540
Are we?

797
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,540
Are we with you?

798
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,540
Oh my God, I can't see.

799
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,540
I can't see none.

800
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,540
I actually can't see none.

801
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,540
I'm sitting down.

802
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,540
I'm sitting down.

803
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,540
It's fine.

804
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,540
Is it this one?

805
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,540
It's not this one.

806
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:32,540
Johnny, you said the first thing you said you had to issue with your marshmallow.

807
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,540
Has it been fixed?

808
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,540
Nah.

809
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,540
Oh, sorry.

810
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,540
Wait, wrong one.

811
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:41,540
I meant to put Mully on so I can actually see and get out of this cave.

812
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,540
Nah.

813
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,540
See you.

814
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,540
Yeah.

815
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,540
Oh my God.

816
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,540
Oh my God.

817
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,540
Right.

818
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:59,540
If you need to tell me anything that's important, question mark.

819
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:08,540
Then fucking let me know via...

820
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,540
I shouldn't...

821
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,540
I shouldn't...

822
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,540
I shouldn't...

823
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,540
I shouldn't swear.

824
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,540
I mean, I can be swear, but...

825
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:20,540
Okay, now they drove from the sky.

826
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,540
That cannot feel good.

827
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:27,540
I regret to inform you that it does not feel good to drive from the sky.

828
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,540
Okay.

829
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:29,540
Volcanic stone.

830
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:33,540
Hmm, I wonder if we're going to an area that has volcanic activity.

831
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,540
Trillium mystery.

832
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:40,540
I remember really liking volcanoes when I was younger.

833
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,540
Well, I had to to in a minute, but I didn't have to.

834
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,540
It went away.

835
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,540
It goes to the sun.

836
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,540
Ooh, what are you?

837
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:50,540
Fireproof dried liver.

838
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,540
Does that mean you can't receive marshmallows?

839
01:20:54,540 --> 01:21:04,540
No, no one has access to their marshmallows right now.

840
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:16,540
Oh, there's a map here.

841
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,540
I mean, that's not even going to help.

842
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,540
I've still not came across this bloody village yet.

843
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,540
This bloody village.

844
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,540
Hold on.

845
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:27,540
Hold on.

846
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,540
Let me just put a little more.

847
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,540
Something's gone for me.

848
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,540
He has triple sprain.

849
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,540
Come on.

850
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:35,540
That's about OP.

851
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,540
I don't have triple sprain.

852
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,540
Oh, the jellyfish will lead me.

853
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:43,540
The jellyfish are always at a cavern or is that a grief site?

854
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,540
Oh, no.

855
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,540
Oh, no, this can't be.

856
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,540
There's no gravestone here.

857
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,540
Sugar.

858
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:53,540
Wait, am I going the complete wrong way?

859
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,540
What am I?

860
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,540
Who or what is fighting?

861
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,540
Something's fighting over there.

862
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,540
Just follow the path.

863
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:06,540
Oh, sorry.

864
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,540
I thought it was one of the things.

865
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:10,540
Who is fighting who?

866
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:12,540
Surely you guys are.

867
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,540
Oh, no.

868
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,540
Wait, there's actual fighting.

869
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:20,540
I'm so used to everything just going for me.

870
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:25,540
It's incomprehensible that there's actual fighting going on.

871
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:35,540
It seems like we're on a battlefield.

872
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:41,540
I'm getting XP for doing nothing.

873
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,540
What were you?

874
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:47,540
Reefling?

875
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,540
Reefling is coming here?

876
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,540
Oh, no.

877
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:55,540
This means it's a boss fight.

878
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:00,540
Are they coming for me?

879
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Okay.

880
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,540
I think they forgot I existed, which is what I like to hear.

881
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,540
Is there a dragon ahead?

882
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,540
Is there any reeflings able to make it to this really random location at this part of the

883
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,540
map that I haven't unlocked yet?

884
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,540
Uh-huh.

885
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,540
And Mt. Gililmower or whatever.

886
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,540
So we can go wallop a dragon.

887
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,540
Do you think I'll lose?

888
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,540
There is a high probability I'll lose.

889
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:29,540
Very high probability.

890
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,540
Okay.

891
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,540
Do you think we can do it, Reefling?

892
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,540
Just me and you?

893
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,540
No pressure?

894
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,540
Do you think you can do it?

895
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,540
Oh well, we'll go back up.

896
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,540
That's a good thing.

897
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,540
We'll go back up.

898
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,540
Okay, we'll go back up.

899
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,540
Let's go.

900
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,540
Is there any no-nos?

901
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,540
Insects, mutants, ogres?

902
01:23:53,540 --> 01:24:03,540
So anything that would give the girl a debuff?

903
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,540
I don't want to hear it.

904
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:12,540
Like, you have to remember that there, like, you can't give someone a...

905
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,540
Stop your whimpering!

906
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,540
We're going to defeat the dragon.

907
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
Can we stand in the lake fire?

908
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,540
Or is this dragon going to be, like, in the ear of Wolverine

909
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,540
and just, like, annihilate us all in one go?

910
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:27,540
Oh, speaking of the dragon.

911
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,540
Uh, oops.

912
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:30,540
Hold on.

913
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,540
Hold on.

914
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,540
Uh, that's not good.

915
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,540
It's not actually supposed to put your health down.

916
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,540
Whoa.

917
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,540
Whoa!

918
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,540
Okay, I think the lag is, like, terrible right now.

919
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,540
Well, I'm helping.

920
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,540
I'm helping.

921
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,540
I'm getting rolled.

922
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,540
I'm getting rolled.

923
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:51,540
I'm rolling out of the way.

924
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,540
I'm rolling out of the way.

925
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:58,540
I don't know how.

926
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:01,540
Please let me heal.

927
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,540
Oh, I got hurt by...

928
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,540
I got spanked by a spot.

929
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,540
And maybe you should have put a fire-resistant talisman on,

930
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:12,540
but that's not on me.

931
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,540
Wait, you can't hurt him?

932
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,540
Or am I just getting really bad taimans?

933
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,540
Okay, we did it.

934
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,540
We did it.

935
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,540
We did it.

936
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,540
We did it.

937
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Um...

938
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,540
Dragonheart.

939
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,540
Dragonheart.

940
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:29,540
More like this dragon farted and boosted.

941
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,540
Dun dun dun.

942
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,540
A debuff.

943
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:35,540
Wait, am I using the word the wrong way around?

944
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:38,540
A debuff is a negative, a buff is a good.

945
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:41,540
Can you walk on lava?

946
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,540
Whoa, whoa.

947
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,540
Wait, what?

948
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:50,540
Can I walk on lava?

949
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:55,540
Wait, I'm taking damage.

950
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,540
Is torrent taking damage?

951
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,540
Wait, no, this can't be.

952
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,540
Wait, no.

953
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,540
What?

954
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,540
What?

955
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,540
I'm going crazy.

956
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:11,540
Okay, it is hurting torrent.

957
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,540
Is that a dead end over there?

958
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,540
Sorry, torrent.

959
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,540
I'll keep your vetoes.

960
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,540
He's off.

961
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
There you go.

962
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Is this a dead end or not?

963
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:24,540
No, it's not a dead end.

964
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,540
Nothing?

965
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:26,540
Yeah, nothing off-putting.

966
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,540
You can't eat someone a model and be like,

967
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,540
oh, sorry, we actually don't know if people will overall

968
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,540
enjoy your model.

969
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:34,540
But good luck though.

970
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:35,540
Good luck in your success.

971
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,540
We'll do everything, but then you're on your own.

972
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,540
Smile.

973
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:45,540
If I hand over a shirt, that's a pillow.

974
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:53,540
Someone in my group defeated the shard bear.

975
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:54,540
Go, reeflings, go.

976
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:58,540
I'm so proud of you.

977
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:02,540
You're doing it.

978
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:07,540
That's the bear that AC literally defeated in our

979
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:08,540
lore video.

980
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,540
Feel old yet?

981
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,540
This is a piece of cheese.

982
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:17,540
You know those memes that are like, feel old yet?

983
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:21,540
This is this person you saw this many years ago.

984
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:25,540
I like hate those memes so much.

985
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:30,540
So the only version I enjoy is when it's like absolute

986
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,540
nonsense and it's like feel old yet?

987
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,540
This is a piece of day old salmon.

988
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,540
Those are the only ones I can tolerate.

989
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,540
A debuff is a disadvantage.

990
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:59,540
Can you like, let me be in your hand?

991
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,540
Maybe not in that context, in terms of like,

992
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,540
actual preference of the character.

993
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,540
I've just been in terms of like,

994
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,540
design and stuff, debuff.

995
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:13,540
But not how the, what?

996
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:17,540
No, I've unlocked these guys.

997
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,540
Oh, we made it to hermit village.

998
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,540
Okay, now what?

999
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,540
Now what?

1000
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,540
Now what?

1001
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:27,540
Oh, I don't like those guys at all.

1002
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,540
I can't stand them.

1003
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,540
I can't stand them.

1004
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,540
Am I in trouble?

1005
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,540
Oh my, oh my.

1006
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,540
Oh my!

1007
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:38,540
I'm actually going to perish.

1008
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,540
I'm actually going to perish.

1009
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,540
I'm getting freaking annihilated.

1010
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,540
Sit down.

1011
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,540
Sit down.

1012
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,540
Sit down.

1013
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,540
Touch it, touch it, touch it.

1014
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,540
Oh my god it's charging up.

1015
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,540
It's actually charging up to go for me.

1016
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,540
Just charging up to go for me.

1017
01:28:51,540 --> 01:29:10,540

1033
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:19,440
an insect or spider is a debuff and right I'm not gonna sound like an ass hat and I mean

1034
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:30,840
absolutely nothing when I say this but name one bug vtuber right now I'm gonna be honest

1035
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:50,400
and say I can't and I don't mean that in a nasty way but right so and all those names

1036
01:32:50,400 --> 01:33:04,920
you've all just typed I recognize one yeah it's not like an endless list it's like you guys have

1037
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:11,120
repeated two of the same names over and over like I don't mean it in a bad way and I'm sure it's

1038
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:16,080
probably gonna frustrate people but you have to like is there no other reason that can come in

1039
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,880
oh and like I'm sure it's gonna frustrate people like oh my god you didn't make the exact

1040
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:29,960
design I wanted but like please be realistic like one like if I'm gonna get shit for like telling

1041
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,240
like the behind the scenes stuff like I'm happy to shut up and just like quiet but like the fun

1042
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:40,800
part is that we can do these discussions and I can be like look I'm gonna be honest bug vtuber

1043
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:48,360
is a debuff it might be hard to imagine it is not like a good thing like the reason why you know

1044
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:56,080
and the Visho Joe bug is because well fucking Visho Joe and also they came with like an absolutely

1045
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:05,240
insane amount behind like if you mean I mean like actual insect and that's the only insect I

1046
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:09,240
think someone was saying a moth or whatever but that's not like if you're talking like insect

1047
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:17,120
like centipede arachnid type star oh it was like actually in the village

1048
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:31,680
late when you consume content well so all of you can actually do this right now when you

1049
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:37,320
consume content you can literally look into the success factors of what Lake has made someone

1050
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:43,920
and like as you start to analize and kind of get past the point of you cute girl that's why she's

1051
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:49,640
successful it's like no motherfucker look harder and it's like there's one bug girl that you guys can

1052
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:55,320

1183
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:46,920

01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:44,520
I'm not gonna get lost hold on wait I've been in this place before I have no recollection of this

1190
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:51,240
place but I've been in this place before as long as I'm going up I think I'm going the right way

1191
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,000
okay yeah because we killed those guys that is really early okay I think we're good

1193
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:11,480

01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,480
you should go to chadows hero grave oh god I've not learned the names of these places

1195
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:24,040
chadows hero grave sure wait

01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,000
wait why is it doing it like that

1197
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:38,040
this is a dragon area oh chadows hidden grave

1198
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,920
if you push too much we'll have to contact your cats to tie you up and put you in bed

1199
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:52,760
honestly I don't know if any reeflings are at this section though well I heard I heard a noise

1200
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,560
it sounds like one of them is it's about enemy reeflings got enemies got a lead enemy oh I saw

1201
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:06,760
that one don't worry I'll get you back in we're just don't rely on reeflings for two minutes

1202
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:11,720
challenge impossible damn straight it's impossible I don't want to be on what one I'm too scared

1203
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:18,520
this game is it's literally a horror game when I can't spawn you guys in I can't remember what

1204
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:25,080
section yesterday I couldn't have you guys in I was dying a day kidney handle it

1205
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:34,120
kidney handle it at least I have a reefling to help me through the scary bit

1206
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:39,800
no I don't rub it in my face we're trying to get it does that not work

1207

1209
01:52:54,280 --> 01:53:02,280
instead beautiful right and then last but not last morning coconut that's literally what we're

1210
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:14,680
calling it oh no it's not it's whimpering we're getting the whimpering one do you get

1211
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:21,720
spooked easily in horror games I can hardly play them I don't actually play them like in my in my

1212
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:27,880
in my free time I don't play horror games let's get to it uh is there no other reefling that can

1213
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:36,520
join are we too high are we too high in the dlc yeah I think we are okay um okay gating light we

1214
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:44,360
have a torch actually I think that playing you would have been saying because the bosses would

1215
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:49,880
have a normal health but I can get to your point scary monsters yeah I don't like when it's all on

1216
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:55,560
me like it's why I really enjoy Assassin's Creed brotherhood because like even if you're bad you

1217
01:53:55,560 --> 01:54:01,080
have things to rely on you to help you like get through the game like you can use the crossbow

1218
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:05,880
for stealth and all that and you can call on your assassin recruits like it's a nice oh my god there

1219
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:11,880
might not be a spider on my foot I don't know why I feel sorry I literally felt something on my foot

1220
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:21,880
and I was like oh spider uh no it's actually just a reason hitting hitting I'm having a stroke

1221
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,880
literally my life that's it right now

1222
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:33,000
I mean Elder Ring does have spirit ashes and but is it the same

1223
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,960
I got jumped in you're not sitting on your feet no I'm sitting with my legs pressed against the

1224
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:46,040
desk so my feet are on the chair right now I can't sit on them at the moment uh due to the

1225
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:53,400
minor loss of a body part um there will not be any feet sitting on for quite a while

1226
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,360
but I can sit with them up at least which I'm happy about

1227
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:05,640
there's no reefing spirit ashes just not the same I'm not gonna make it

1228

1232
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,140

1237
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:12,040
confirmed my little tentacles why you're all in here hello uh is there anyone here that

1238
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:17,080
haven't had a chance to join in yeah I wish you needed to get in made you feel like you've not

1239
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:24,600
had a chance oh oops sorry how can we kiss you to better we can't see it you want to kiss my

1240
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:29,640
mangled gory toes sure okay I think you too haven't had a chance to be in yet

1241
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:37,000
uh but oh my god this is so weird this is like the last thing we're doing and then

1242
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:42,520
we're literally going africate oh no wait who do you think coming

1243
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,400
is it my connection or is it your connection be honest

1244
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:55,080
it's probably the servers and overlord no I got inappropriate activity

1245
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,880
it's so weird

1246
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:08,120
I'll get enemy reflux gaden like uh but yeah I'm like

1247
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:16,360
the good thing is I think I'll be able to go to the shops and buy myself like actual food

1248
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:22,760
because I've been having to rely on like takeaway for quite a while now and I think

1249
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:29,800
that's also not helping with my four-day loaf of bread because that tiny little thing I produced

1250
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:40,280
yesterday I'm probably on day five in all honesty um takeaway is good but I am not looking after

1251
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:45,320
myself because I'm like having so much fun streaming like I said like as soon as I click go live I

1252
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:51,320
don't feel stressed I feel excited I want to share the plans I want to share like the things

1253
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:58,680
like Azura has just hit over 5 000 subscribers ac is like just shy of it if you're not subscribed

1254
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:04,680
to ac snowfalls her link is in my description and then literally in under a month all members

1255
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:11,640
of VLR have hit 5 000 subscribers which is just insane for a new like we um

1256
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,760
I'm

1257
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:21,080
carful like that is it car is it carful is it really a corporation if they can do what they

1258
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:27,560
want for the most of the part for the most part wait I can't see anyone else

1259
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:39,640
I'm gonna try and I know I want to be selfish but I'm trying to beat this area you want me to come

1260
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:46,360
yeah everyone's been monetized everyone's about to hit at least 5k there's like ASMR

1261
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:51,480
collabs on the way like I'm just so excited for all these wee things to finally come out

1262
01:58:51,480 --> 01:59:01,160
um I got to see the video game animation um there I'm gonna say it might still come out in July

1263
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:09,480
near the end I'm not sure how fast this animators working but um like the games come in the games

1264
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:14,360
free access and all that jazz so don't worry are you working him with that

1265
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:27,400
the corporation ran by an anti-corporal it's enemy levels of funny honestly though

1266
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:35,400
stop whimpering great come on let's go let's go let's go time to have 6k hours oh no the the maximum

1267
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:41,160
if you want to unlock all the wee thingies and they're very small like if you're

1268
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:48,280
you know if not everyone is your flavor and in the agency then you're probably only gonna play

1269
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:59,320
through it once um what's going on here not that way I guess um but if everyone is your flavor

1270
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:09,160
or you just have a genuine curiosity then um you can probably you're the full unlock play

1271
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:15,960
time would be an hour um but it would be mildly repetitive other than the new voice playing

1272
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:22,040
here and there to take a different order of things um it's not it's not anything major

1273
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,400
so this is a warrior door

1274
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:38,440
and then I can spoil all the behind the scenes of what it's like to make a video game

1275
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,520
are you ready

1276
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:46,120
oh

1277
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:53,160
wait why does it call it that oh he looks so sad he's blue

1278
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:59,320
amidst a blissful lamentation what's lamentation

1279
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:12,760
what's lamentation I will be putting 100 hours into it you can it would be too repetitive

1280
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:19,320
literally if you unlock everything then there's nothing else there's no like hidden secrets before

1281
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:24,440
anyone's like oh my god strongy such an elite gamer that she would put in hidden secrets if you do

1282
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:28,760
this in this order no there's none of that do not torture yourself thinking there's any hidden

1283
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:33,080
secrets everything is there oh sorry replaying

1284
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,640
uh we got a key okay

1285
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:50,440
blissful lamentation is just a funny word for why would they put that in the game

1286
02:01:50,840 --> 02:02:01,160
a way to hear strongy every day and some scenes gonna play an extra two no it's not that

1287
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:09,080
like please like remember first of her attempt at like commission oh my god reflin are you okay

1294
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:44,840

1301
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:31,080
oh reflin I don't need to

1302
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:40,680
uh a completion bar no but it will be very apparent like what you can unlock and what

1303
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:45,800
replaying would do so you're not wasting your time if you play it and you're like not sorry

like you will not waste your time in the game you'll either like it you won't like it you'll

1307
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:15,560
instantly after the first instance of it which is not even five minutes you will completely

1308
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:21,160
understand what the game is and if you want to continue you most certainly can to unlock scenes

1309
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:28,040
and if you don't want to continue you don't have to it's completely optional it's a and it's a free

1310
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:33,480
game so it's not like oh I've wasted my time and if anyone memes and be like oh but sorry I wasted
