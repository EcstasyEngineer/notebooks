58
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,640
what did you why did you choose vealor instead of remaining independent Azura and Azura said

59
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:40,480
I saw a great opportunity and vealor entrusted in our vision the support a company can give its

60
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,880
talent is a great starting point oh thank you Azura really you're far too kind but how important

61
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,880
was the amount of freedom with content creation being open to discussing pls etc for you I don't

62
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,240
really want to discuss my pl but I'm happy that I get the freedom to talk about some aspects of

63
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,360
life even when wanting to create new memories and the future for myself oh sure that's so kind of you

64
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm glad that you enjoyed that uh we're an agency that doesn't acknowledge your fucking brand new

65
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,720
out the out the out the package okay thank you Azura I appreciate that and what platform did you

66
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:31,200
want to make content on prior to being a part of vealor Azura since I originally streamed on Twitch

67
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:40,000
I wanted to make the move to youtube and continue making content there including shorts and I actually

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,280
speaking of shorts Azura sorry to interrupt you I've just ordered four shorts of you right now

69
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,160

there doesn't entirely get removed after a few days like twitch box okay thank you Azura okay

74
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,640
but what inspired you to create content or content in general for that matter Azura

75
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,960
I've always had a feel for voice acting and always wanted to take part in some kind of way

76
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,800
the many voices that approached me were compliment towards my voice and how I should pursue it

77
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,680
which piqued my curiosity in the air however the many voices claimed my voice is extremely

78
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:59,920
erotic oh so when the opportunity appeared it felt like it was meant to be oh wow I agree with

79
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,960
that I am sure people did compliment you I have no doubts about that Azura I absolutely no doubts

80
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:15,920
at all um is there any content you're particularly interested in making well that would be the

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,720
awesome raw place oh Azura all right I also look forward to being in other opportunity oh is that a hint to the video game Azura

82
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,400
Azura is that a hint to the video game I don't know by the way before anyone's like oh new viewer

83
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,400
here I thought stroney was a mix of strong and funny oh um for anyone who's like uh did you

84
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,840
look over the girls answers and stuff uh I think I fixed one sentence and it was in mercies

85
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,040
that's it I've not changed any all these answers are what they actually said I fixed one sentence

86
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,320
in mercies which I actually didn't tell her about sorry mercy yeah fuck you stroney that's not what

88
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm fighting myself here okay stop stop okay uh do you have any uh other content creators advice on

89
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,520
how to navigate uh creating uh alternative content on the internet especially when it comes

90
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:21,920
safely navigating it because I miss the word safely there if it's a view tubing related and you wish

91
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,560
to keep your identity private try not to share too much information that could put you at risk for

92
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,480
but it's perfectly okay to be honest and do things that make what

93
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,400
don't oh don't force your side I fucking can't read in my own interview yeah is there are you okay

97
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,320
yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable and the rather open up slowly okay I'll open you

98
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
up slowly Azura thank you uh right what was the next question uh what do you hope to bring or

99
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,360
change in the view tubing landscape Azura I don't think I can change much of anything but I would

100
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:32,960
hope that people can see more person of color talent in the image oh I like that thank you thank

look she's my baby girl okay she my she my doll face she my doll face

117
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,160
mm-hmm okay we're currently reading Azur's interview from a acapella media look at them

118
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:42,720
I just revealed a bit of secret lore about um the uh design uh the promotional artwork this was

119
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,720
ordered before the designs were finalized because look Azur doesn't have her nails painted and one

120
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,160
of the biggest giveaways is her headband if it has floating jewellery that's actually uh that's

121
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,800
actually a massive giveaway on if uh the artwork was completed or not at that point um they forgot

122
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,520
about the jewellery on their toes oh yeah actually yeah that was another big thing so you can tell

123
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:19,280
what stage of panic in production we were at depending on what the thing was but now everything's

124
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:27,920
made correctly um oh oh my god the tea is steaming up my glasses I forget glasses steam up

125
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,840
okay I've had my tea right back to the questions uh Azur can I keep question yet of course

126
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Stroney okay thank you Azur um right what's one thing you want people to remember about you

127
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,720
individually or as a generation I may not be the first but I started with almost nothing

128
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:59,280
I did the best I could and achieved very little I just want to show others that it's very possible

129
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,240
and you shouldn't give up I still have a long way to go yes um I I think me and Azura are completely

130
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,080
on the exact same page when I say this um I see a lot of potential in Azura which is why she's Azura

131
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:24,000
um you know I I see myself and the girls to different degrees and Azura was definitely

132
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,200
and I don't think this is an insult in any way I think she completely 100% gets what why I say this

133
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I think Azura is the the version of me that I see that I needed a helping hand or a gating hand

134
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,800
and once you know things settle down and everything I'm going to try and get her moved out with her

135
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,360
donathon that's coming up next month which is actually really exciting it comes up in August

136
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm going to try and get her moved out and then things can kind of I think it's upwards and onwards

137
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:58,160
for Azura after that the underdog yes I I I'm a sucker for my underdog I always root for them

138
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,720
and I think Azura has insane potential she just needs a few things to occur

139
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,080
and then I I think she's got it she's absolutely she's got nothing to worry about

140
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,400
um but we just need to first get her moved out and then I can just nuke her brain on all the

141
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,200
secrets and behind the scenes stuff okay my little pad of one yes uh right um what do you want to

142
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:37,920
represent in the v-tube sphere Azura I'm not I just I know I'm just another voice but I want to do

143
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:45,680
so much more with that voice I always thought my voice was very no it's not I Azura I picked you

144
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,680
because you said I need more gold in your goddamn voice I was about to cross off your damn stream

145
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,200
you're a league player you but maybe I can find something that can truly represent in the beach

146
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,040
on the sphere yes um Azura humble max and literally I everyone knows why I picked them

147
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,600
I told them I said it on debut and I told them like one on one like hey this is why you got picked

148
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,040
or type thing um now you have to remember this is the first time Azura has ever been in any kind

149
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,200
of spotlight kind of had this attention so please don't be afraid if the girls may have said something

150
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
that wasn't the kindest to themselves they're not all confident you know they can't all be

151
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:38,160
just absolutely arrogant like myself um so if you see if you see a reply and you're like oh that's

152
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,800
a wee shame just remember these some of these girls have never achieved anything close to what

153
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,000
they've achieved in the very first month of the very first month at Vilaura they have not achieved

154
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,400
that and they're at their time as a content creator so very yes we will grow and blossom their

155
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,600
confidence just as the beautiful nasturtiums blossom you know stroney you're just being truthful

156
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,000
to yourself as an arrogant okay one more question for Azura and we have finalized Azura's interview

157
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,680
mm-hmm uh Azura is there any event in VTubing history that is incredibly significant to you

158
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,440
there isn't one that particularly stood out to me but I suppose seeing the rise of Vilaura

159
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,360
already coming out with the person of color talent right off the bat was incredibly nice

160
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,600
as well as management being open to more person of color designs behind the scenes

161
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:50,640
and developments was very reassuring it wasn't a publicity stunt now I have a oh boy do I have

162
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,320
some information about gen 2 to leak to you motherfuckers uh yeah you're not ready for what

163
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,440
occurred yesterday with the development team oh boy right that is uh beautiful Azura Dooley

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,360

167
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,120
exams etc so I'm having to rotate gracefully between each girl to try and give them a fair

168
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,600
amount of shorts um but we're not quite there yet but thank you so much for that interview

184
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,880
instead of remaining independent um i already had a previously good experience with them

185
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:38,400
and from that day why does it sound like a zero i always for fuck hold on let me pull up ac right

186

now hold on let me pull up ac stream so i can fucking mimic tear her right now hold on pause

189
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,720
you hello i already have a pretty a previously good experience with the investor and from that day i

190
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:10,240
always had a good impression of her so when i heard of the plans she was making i wanted to take

191
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:18,560
part of it so much because i knew i'd feel safer under her wing and the concept of vealor i'm trying

192
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,880
just to appeal the last to me being an indie was also very lonely to be in a group of girls that

193
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,680
are degenerates like me i'm not right though like working all together to reach her dream sounded like

194
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:41,520
the perfect place for me oh that's so lovely ac i'm so glad that you feel comfortable around

195
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,640
us all being degenerates okay for the next question my little icicle how important was the

196
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,040
amount of freedom that content creation being open with your pl etc was for you it was pretty

197
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,600
important it was it make me nervous and overwhelmed if i had to rethink everything i say in fear of

198
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:08,000
getting in trouble for it okay i just like to be comfy and to talk about whatever without worrying

199
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,360
about that stuff oh i'm yeah no it honestly it's fine i'm not gonna pretend that you've never streamed

200
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,800
before ever in your life okay i'm losing it's almost like i'm losing my mind hearing all these

201
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:27,600
voices um okay uh what platforms did you want to make content on prior being on vealor my little

202
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:35,440
icicle pretty much all of them are the known ones like twitch and youtube and twitter and patreon

203
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,600
et cetera all right okay okay what inspired you to create content or just content in general

204
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:52,320
for that matter hold on i need to refresh oh my name is icicle i have always done things on the

205
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:00,720
creative side or have many ideas i wanted to bring to life seeing the things that people would create

206
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,320
or do puts a fire in me you know what else is in her today the fucking dad does

207
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:19,520
stop running a train oh my god thank you back to you ac that's far wait hold on what's your

208
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:27,200
voice again it's no pause that's far to want to try and create those things myself everything

209
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,320
expires me from music to art to poems to movies to animation god damn ac you pull from a love

210
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,600
inspiration um are we sure stroney is a cut official not apparent do you have any advice

211
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,960
for other content creators to navigate the field safety be careful with how much you share of your

212
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,880
identity it sometimes makes you feel off or uncomfortable oh if something makes you feel

213
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,480
off or comfortable don't engage with it and in general just don't do the 18 plus content

214
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,400
if you think you might regret it later uh she really said if you're born a slag be a slag

215
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:16,000
ac oh my god right okay uh you might regret later once it's on the internet it's there forever

216
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,640
i would only advise going into it if it's something you're very passionate about and should enjoy

217
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:29,280
want to do it long term oh my god ac you're hilarious oh my god right what do you hope to

218
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:37,760
bring or to change in the v-trip and landscape well we've all seen 3d concerts like the big ones

219
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,640
where people can watch in person it is my dream to achieve something similar but in a form of a

220
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:52,640
3d 3d dj party with all of the violor oh that's fucking adorable she actually did say this in her

221
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,640
application to us um i'd make for such a cool thing to experience with more interaction dancing

222
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,800
and lots of fun oh she's so cute she put this in her application i really made it stand out because

223
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,480
now if anyone's lurking that just happens to have applied you know there's a lot of reasons

224
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,360
obviously again it was like 64 candidates the one model so it wasn't easy but um

225
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:26,160
3d dj party madness no no no no no no no every strongy streamer's like i'll have a viola

226
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,480
reading it now um what was this one oh yeah um like some people didn't really have much goals

227
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,920
or aspirations etc they're just like i'm just happy to do my thing and i was like that's good

228
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,720
and all but it was good to have like a someone come in with like a really strong goal like this is

229
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,560
what i want to achieve like she's got something to work towards which is quite nice uh but i say

230
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,400
i'm not finished uh asking you the question so what do you want to represent in the v-tribe

231
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,080
sphere and just for those of us at home how does your voice go in? tarot polar bear from tarot polar bear

232
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,920
it's a bit tough for me to think of that because i don't think there's anything i really represent

233
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:10,080
besides myself oh you're so humble the closest thing i can think of is to represent is being

234
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:18,080
yourself the most authentic version of you is the ideal version the right people will see that

235
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,760
in you even if you take some years i had i'm losing it i had many nights where i cry oh

236
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,920
hey so what the fuck i had many nights where i cried or was worried that i'm not it's not going to

237
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,400
happen but it did and now i'm here and i'm the most fulfilled i've ever been yeah after that stream

238
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:45,840
don't give up yes i see you're very fulfilled right now thanks for that dad as i see you there

239
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,720
what's one thing you want people to remember about you individually or as a generation

240
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,640
i think what i'd like people to remember about us as a generation is that even if we are a

241
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:13,680
whore all of the girls have a lot of personality they are talented they're sweet they're incredible

242
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,800
people that deserve to achieve their dream and i also think that it'd be sweet and a bit funny

243
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:30,560
that the corpo with the horse is the one who ended up being the most wholesome and entertaining

244
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
what oh my god i see i can't believe you said that i lied

250
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,880

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,560
about being open up to discussing pl's top priority i wouldn't be here if they didn't allow me to be

282
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:55,440
open about my pl it is not her voice at all um right like scottish also wait that's deep also

283
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,280

288
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,120
eh what platform do you want to make content or what can't what platform did you want to make

289
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,920
content on prior revealer um i made content on twitch and tiktok and instagram and twitter

290
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,200
and youtube and patreon prior fucking hell you've got you're stacked out of the wazoo obviously most

291
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,080
of it was just reposting stuff from one platform to the other to reach a brighter audience okay thank

292
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,960
you emmy um but what inspired you to create that kind of content okay what is pl means previous life

293
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,960
so um other kind of personas you might have made content under etc like again when you join

294
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,280
veal or you get a whole new persona given to you eh what made you inspire inspire to make that kind

295
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,920
of content they listened to a lot of blue dot i mean did you actually put on an interview you did

296
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,280
well this is published okay i also consumed a lot of erotic literature so i had a lot of fun

297
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,000
creating my own scripts too okay that's actually the same i never thought i'd actually be creating it

298
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,680
because i naturally sound like the erm actually about t which is the least sexy thing imaginable

299
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,000
but that's where the voice acting comes into play i know i i didn't know you voice acted for

300
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,560
krema sonic heroes so i mean here we are um is there any content you're particularly interested

301
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,760
in making i want to make more art i just have to find the time and energy and some inspiration

302
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,200
you heard your pen pals you heard your big bros gi or some inspiration off you pop

303

their interviews and then i'm like doing my default voice do you have any advice for other

305
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,800
content creators i want to safely navigate the 18 plus field just hide your identity and don't

306
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
become close personal friends with the people that consume your content it just gets too dangerous

307
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,720
okay so keep yourself safe please wow you really do sound like krema i know how tempting it is to

308
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,840
get close but you're playing with fire what do you hope to change or bring in the v-tubing

309
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,360
landscape i mean okay i don't really hope to bring or change anything right out here with the goal

to get to know me better while the allure may be uh agency first of its kind in the end i auditioned

349
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,800
due to detail's dream resonating with me there are many factors at play as well i was reaching my

350
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,560
dreams with my friends those who made it into other corporations so that i could stamp aside them

351

362
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,880

363
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,520
want to keep it on the down low with veal or the freedom with content creation is more lenient

364
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,240
and i get to play the games i want and everything is more streamlined for more crucial things don't

365
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,480
get it twisted though i still get told no sometimes and that's a little good for me because sometimes

366
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,520
my ideas are bad or would be a brand risk oh wait no a bad risk that's why management is there oh

367
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,080
thank you mercy for answering that yes i can't believe it you actually got told no when did

prior to veal or fensley oh man uh once fired you to create that kind of content or that content

371
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:28,000
in general mercy i used to be an actor i actress whoops i've been unlucky for a lack of better

372
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
words for a while now i'm probably the most inexperienced of the group as this is my first

373
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,880
time really creating that kind of content to me it's a return to form while still exploring my

374
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:50,000
more sensual side haha it's been great fun also a roguet i play a roguet yeah oh wow mercy what the

376
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,200

377
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,360
safety you learned in high school and i mean it that's really important i cannot stress enough

378
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,920
about how important it is to do your new diligence to keep yourself safe also if you do want to do

379
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:25,280
some if you don't want to do something say no yes that is very true please bring up any issues with

380
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,440
any things you might not want to do in an audio with us and make you finding his central side

381
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,680
children what do you hope to bring or change in the vtube and landscape mercy i hope feel or shows

382
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,360
that we are just like any other vtuber agency just with spicier content on the side that content is

383
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,680
by choice and if you want to interact with it i hope the taboo of being a not safe or vtuber goes

384
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:58,560
away because in the end like all other vtubers we just want to make you smile and entertain you

385
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,520
whoa steady on mercy steady on again you're really getting into the character there um

386
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,440
so can you read mario maros in mickey moise's voice as well you want that that's terrible is there

387
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,840
anything is there any alt content you're particularly interested in making in mercy mouse

388
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:24,640
mercy mouse i'm still discovering what i like and don't like so i'm exploring all facets of the

389
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,760
alternative content i'd like to try experimenting with the medium a little more but we're all we're

390
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:40,080
still in the beginning stages so taking it slow is okay okay but what do you want to represent

391
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,560
in the vtuber sphere mercy let us know let us know your thoughts this is a thought-provoking

392
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,840
question i suppose that i want to be at least someone who is seen as safe to work with even

393
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:02,000
though i make that kind of content as well i it doesn't define me and means i'm some what

394
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,040
it doesn't define me and means i'm some sort of rabid animal that cannot control my urges hot

395
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,840
i've losing it i'm actually going schizophrenic right now it was one thing that you want people

396
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,880
to remember about you mercy individually or as a generation my laughter and my personality but

400
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:48,320
vtuber history uh to you as a whole i suppose that the debut of hololive english really brought

401
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,000
out about the forefront of vtuber into an international audience as a whole it's no longer

402
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,160
a medium that is pretty niche it's becoming more and more acceptable i agree with that there was

403
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,720
very interesting discourse discord discourse around a year ago that was like vtuber's dying

404
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,120
i don't know if people still say that but i don't think people under oh my hands just farted if you

come come i'm gonna give sorry i'm gonna give you a shot but let's be honest it's not happening

421
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:03,360
because her voices aren't hello hi there hello sweetheart hello my name is she be cotton bomb

422
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:10,640
i'm my name is she be cotton bomb you're mistress i'm the mistress i guess it's right jesse from

423
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:20,480
pokemon let's go as you twerk the bum dominatrix of via lures the first agency of oh i've just noticed

424
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:28,800
the misprint oops um that's my bad my bad chief um via lures the first oh wait that's the question

425
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,040
asked me asking it to her via lures the first agency of this kind she be why did you choose it

426
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,080
instead of being an independent as you twerk it's nice having the freedom of being an independent

427
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:47,280
reach over but i longed for a group of people that i could see as sisters and have a a consistent

428
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:54,240
collab partners with similar likes i'd also follow the roadmap of via lures for over a year

429
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,680
and shared a lot of the same aspirations as the creative mind behind it all strut stop you're

430
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,240
making me blush the fuck the fuck you're making me blush what the heck i also wanted to grow as a

431
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,920
creator and learn more about the industry and i couldn't do that without a little bit of help

432
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:19,520
now i have the resources amazing gen mates new knowledge and still manage to have talent freedom

433
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,000
i'll stop it you're blowing art you're blowing air up my arse like that i'm gonna get an eagle

434
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,240
stroke could these girls have stroke the agency anymore i didn't even direct them they did this

435
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:38,720
themselves okay how in she be was reading the question to herself because uh because good dogs

436
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,920
don't speak hey whoa i'm a dog what's going on here are you starting to insinuate so your

437
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,280
sponsor ash that's that's how that's how i do a prompt get into the voice okay how important

438
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,280
was the amount of freedom on content creation being open to pl etc for you i was ash who twerk i was

439
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:04,560
extremely attracted to the fact that feel lower broke a lot of standard reach over roles but pl

440
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:11,120
discussion wasn't a deal breaker for me also if i went in to sign the contract and felt like my

441
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:19,120
rights as a creator were being taken away um in any fashion i would never have signed on yeah

442
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,520
they all say that it's the most pathetic contract i've ever seen uh no matter the agency i do have

443
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:32,800
to say ash out of professionalism i still double checked with my management to ask permissions

444
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,480
because it's always good to make sure i mean that's pretty much melted away at this point that was

445
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,560
probably right at the start when the girls were unsure how much they're allowed to do

446
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,560
but i had to keep reminding the girls like hey you don't need permission go go don't need permission

447
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,560
go there can i tweet this go send it as long as it's on the right twitter account send it you

448
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,120
don't need permission but this was written a bit earlier so some of the stuff is about me

449
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:02,960
how can you not stroke the agency when instead of working for the agency the agency works for them

450
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,160
honestly sorry my glakes have got a fucking me mark on them right ash from pallet time come on

451
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,280
no no no ash uh jesse from pokemon come on i can do this i can do this okay and then no more accents

452
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:23,920
okay um ash would work it's really refreshing however to still feel like an indie you'd have

453
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,840
a team that has my back and supports me with whatever creative endeavor i've put my silly mind

454
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,720
to oh she be stop it my little sheepster's room oh sorry i'm covering up chat sorry sorry sorry chat

455
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:44,000
sorry i'm dumb oh hold on a bit uh what platforms did you want to make content prior to join

456
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,600
in v alert so when you were just doing your thing i was always the casual twitch streamer oh not

457
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:56,080
twitch andy and i hoped someday i could go full time adjusting to youtube has been interesting

458
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:03,440
but i don't mind it it's probably funny for me to say but i was never going to do anything

459
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:13,200
my pl like i'm doing now what's that corruption arc yeah you're welcome ash i wasn't going to

460
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:20,080
make a patreon or even consider fansly i see this reincarnation and my previous version of myself

461
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:29,360
as almost two sides of the same coin i can be your angel or your devil it's very cool to learn how

462
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,840
other platforms function and how you can develop and expand your audience alongside your main platform

463
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:44,480
oh wait did she see the angle oh my god is that why it was spelled weird i can be your angle or your

464
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,360
devil bro i thought i was like why the f*** did she spell it like that but everything else was

465
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:56,720
spelled correctly my dumb ass didn't read it right uh so she stares what inspired just make that kind

466
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,280
of content or that content in general just content in general okay it is the meme it's definitely the

467
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,680
i can be your angel or your devil uh i've always wanted to be a content creator since

468
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:15,200
watching youtubers like jenna marbles markiplier i'm not even saying that i wanted to have the same

469
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,680
positive effect on viewers that watching my favorite content creator had on me and still do

470
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:29,760
as for the erotic content i've always been indifferent about it i have dabbled extremely

471
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:37,760
briefly in the past in the raw and erotic content what it really got nowhere so i never

472
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,200
continued with it ash and now i have to learn and improve from the best of the best i'm not

473
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,000
uh is there any other content you're particularly interested in making

474
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,520

475
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,160

498
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,040
into a character's voice you can give yourself a prompt that is my prompt to do jesse from pokemon

499
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:48,880
i can't do it naturally and what do you hope to bring or change in v tubing landscape i hope that

500
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,880
companies consider the transparency of our splits and make adjustments accordingly in favor of the

501
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:02,640
talents if they have the profit v tubing is an ever-growing industry and towns deserve a bit more

502
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,080
for the work that they oh my god preachy be are we taking down the high table together and i

503
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:16,720
i'll take them the high table with you any day okay what's one thing you want people to remember

504
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:23,600
about you sheepsters individually or as a generation of dealer as a company we're breaking the status

505
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:31,520
quo of what it means to be a corporate vtuber you can allow and manage alternative content

506
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,080
you can talk about your pl if you want and you can have a human relationship with your talents

507
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:47,600
instead of treating them like far oh oh tell her is she be like fodder and still be a successful

508
00:58:47,600 --> 00:59:08,720
company as a generation a group of girls that just want to have a group of girls that just

509
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:14,720
want to have fun make you happy and we appeal to all if not many in some way shape or form

510
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:24,560
and then you can hire unknown oh that's so cute and and sorry and that you can hire unknown talent

511
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:34,240
there's a few gems out there oh my god i'm gonna agree a few of us were complete nobodies but

512
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:43,440
someone saw our potential no it gave us a chance what the fuck i'm saying no that's so sweet i'm

513
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:53,680
thankful for that as myself your favorite girl failure scuff dorky scuff dorky dog always root

514
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,120
for the underdog i'm not kidding always root for the underdog hold on let me let me recalibrate my

515
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,520
model i'm looking a bit funny i'm looking a bit skew if okay there we go recalibrate oh

516
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:12,400
oh blow and smoke up your butt is supposed to be our job literally let me repeat that last

517
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,840
bit uh you can hire unknown talent there's a few gems no there's lots of gems out there it just

518
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:25,440
ain't easy the problem it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy unhidden gem thinks

519
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,240
they're not good enough to apply to vtuber agency don't apply don't get shown off type thing

520
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,680
it really can be as simple as that there's like a lot of like i remember we got emailed on the

521
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:45,120
website after closing applications and someone was like i'm so sorry i've missed the window because

522
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,240
i didn't feel like worthy enough to apply and it was like bro you missed your deadline if we can't

523
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,800
we can't make exceptions but it's like don't hold yourself back seriously the talent pool is massive

524
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,200
it is like it's beyond comprehension how many little hidden gems are out there and they just

525
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,160
need a running start they just need like that exposure they need someone you know with the money

526
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,920
that can be like okay here's shorts right upload them right here's a bit of advertisement money

527
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,520
in this here's in that yeah it's a self-propagating issue where the lack of confidence is your work

528
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:24,400
yeah the imposter syndrome yeah and fear of rejection as well as absolutely humongous barrier

529
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,200
for some people it really is um you know i'm not gonna sit here and be like oh i don't experience

530
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:36,000
that so i'm not gonna you know be say xyz about it um it is this is a big thing anyway uh sorry

533
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:54,400
a confident dump but that you can still make 18 plus content and still be a normal streamer on

534
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:01,200
common part horrors some have the idea that lute tubers are coomed brain 24 7 and flick their

544
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,320
lute tubers she pushed the boundaries of 18 plus content but still displayed herself as a cute and

545
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:19,520
talented streamer a normal human being but also a friendly vtuber with a unique approach to 3d

546
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:26,960
i can safely say she is a pioneer in not only on say so content creation but audience interaction

minutes and never did it any longer so obviously the first question did not apply to me vealour is

560
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:05,920
the first agency why did you choose it nope man man's was pre-selected so that question does not

561
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,880
apply to me so i had to get creative and give myself an alternative question and i've already

562
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,040
lost the damn magazine hold on i have found the magazine okay how did you attract independent

563
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:25,920
v-tubers to vealour is the only question substituted for me okay so first getting our name out there

564
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:33,440
was a challenge but we got incredibly lucky on youtube and the algorithm tapped into the reveal

565
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:42,640
trailer the announcement of vealours all the way back at new years is just shy of 100 000 views on

566
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,440
youtube okay and i'm going to discuss that in a short because there's a reason why i got picked up

567
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:56,160
in the algorithm then the vealour website stated what we wanted i cooked on that website okay i set

568
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:02,000
it straight up i said this is the cut this is the expectations there was no oh i don't know what i'm

569
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,560
signing up for oh i don't know i don't know no we set it off the bat so the people that did apply

570
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:13,360
knew what they were getting into okay so there really wasn't a struggle like as i said the talent

571
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:20,160
pool was pretty big considering new vtuber agency founding members uh quite a few different rules

572
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,720
most vtuber agencies are like eh you didn't have to make content prior to applying yeah they shove

573
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,960
your shit in the bin if you don't have any evidence so okay and yet there's people still asking

574
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:41,680
questions honestly that's not i'm wearing marathon runners why yes of course you don't sound like strawny

575
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:47,760
how dare you what you want to make my accent harsher okay so how important was the amount of freedom

576
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:56,080
content discussing pls etc although i confess it's not traditional and may lead to a few people not

577
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:01,920
enjoying what vealour have to offer he'll offer probably i'm no here to pretend that gen one

578
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:08,720
indulges made up of people who have never streamed before is this what you want yeah actually all of

579
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,320
the girls had more streaming experience than me this is true so it was quite funny going through

580
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:20,240
applications in that sense it was rather humorous it was humorous okay uh thank you strawny for the

581
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:27,200
next question what platform did you want to make content prior to vealour right youtube has always

582
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:34,000
been a staple for many eyes and i have found overall that their rules are mostly fair bad the

583
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,800
bloody uh this this age terribly this age terribly we all have warnings for breathing in an ear

584
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:49,920
anyway twitch however seems to have issues with using rules to punish some but not others it is

585
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:58,560
more of a pick the lesser of two evil situation twitter or x is much more for an overall promotion

586
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,480
and connecting with other vtubers for collaborations i'm afraid personally i'm just no suited for

587
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,040
twitter outside of that and i'm just i'm shy on twitter what inspired you to create alternative

588
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:22,720
content or content in general i never personally okay had any issues where it's just another media

589
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:29,680
source you either wish to consume it and seek it out or you just deny at all i suppose in my case

590
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,480
due to how comfortable i am where i find it quite fascinating to learn about what people enjoy and

591
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:42,320
challenge myself to give them what they want and that's true i like i like when you guys tell me

592
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:48,480
something outrageous and i'm like bet all right let's do it let's do it let's do it we need a scotland

593
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,360
forever okay i'll make scrawny say scotland forever at the end of the interview okay um

594
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,680
is there any content you're particularly interested in making it in the all alternative version

595
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,720
i have always had a secret fascination about hypnosis but i am well aware of the safety concerns

596
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:15,040
that come first it is with this new breath of life that the allure has offered me that i can finally

597
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:21,840
go down this rabbit hole and see what happens this is actually true um i've always enjoyed hypnosis

598
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:27,440
but being absolutely terrified to make it do you have any advice for people who might want to come

599
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:35,760
into safely creating a content of an alternate variety delete everything related to your legal

600
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:46,560
name and social media under it that is rule one okay chase louise from there be on the side of caution

601
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,680
now sadly you are an adult and you are responsible for your actions no matter how foolish they may

602
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:01,040
have been in the moment please do not think however you will be the only numpty on planet earth

603
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:08,560
to make a mistake that is only natural so do not be harsh on yourself you will say and do stupid

604
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:15,840
things that is life okay relax no that's serious all right okay thank you started streaming 69 minutes

605
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:25,520
ago i am oh yeah what do you hope to bring to or change in the vtubing landscape on the surface

606
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:32,800
on the surface the answer would be that the western vtuber agencies are those agencies

607
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:40,560
that wish to appeal to these western agencies also understand that comes with culture changes

608
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:48,800
for example more freedoms of course the scottish person says more freedoms you can take my life

609
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:59,120
but i can't take my freedom honestly most freedoms less restrictions as a whole on vtuber agencies

610
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:07,120
stop being greedy gifts and pay your talents what they earned you did not earn that wake up

611
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:13,200
you didn't earn it you weren't the one streaming you weren't the one putting the hours in pay your

612
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:19,920
talents higher than 50 percent that's all i'm fucking asking stop doing less than 50 percent

613
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:28,560
it's disgusting thank you anyway that's me um anyway now that i've passed that along uh oh you

614
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:35,360
got a bit passionate there strony i do apologize okay okay let's go next um what's one thing that

615
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:42,800
you want people to remember about you individually or a generation individually it is uh is to be

616
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:51,280
yourself unironically and unapologetically as a generation well who better to indulge in than us

617
01:11:53,200 --> 01:12:02,480
oh thank you get it because our uh our gen name is indulge oh oh sorry was i not to explain it

619
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,360

620
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:25,840
to be accepted into the vtuber community okay i could have easily uh what's going on here pan up

633
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:01,600
saying to that sorry okay uh that you didn't have to know everything to be accepted by the vtubing

634
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,840
community i could have easily have been chewed up and spat back out but instead was welcomed with

635
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:13,600
open arms for my curiosity and wanting to learn more it has led to various uh humorous moments

636
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:20,400
such as tisker which is short for tisker it now is being called tisker in my community because

637
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,560
i didn't know what it meant and again i didn't know what that so meant and you guys were just so

638
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,480
nice and taught me everything um and i think it's because like you know you can uh yeah did you

639
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:36,960
take yeah and fucking okay you're done i still say tisker though literally tisker mentioned any

640
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:47,120
tisker yeah um we say instead of tisker or tskr tisker um is there any significant event in vtubing

641
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:55,120
that is incredibly important to you um the uprising of creator-owned vtuber agencies is upon us now

642
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:01,760
okay um socks agencies a fantastic example yumi plus i think is technically an example

643
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,200
um having someone at the helm that has had experience of what and knows what it's like

644
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:15,840
um to produce content and uh knows what to expect is very exciting i can't wait to see more agencies

645
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:22,480
come out that are like that and you never know viola might just collaborate with them i sure it is

646
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:31,760
i hope you're okay yes we are uh it should wink wink but yes um i think creator-owned vtuber

647
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,280
agencies are fantastic because they're realistic and like they know what's up they're like i've

648
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,280
made content before i know what like kind of strange you're under um kind of like is a split

649
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,400
hollow live collab no what i don't have you think i have contacts for hollow live the fuck

unless one of the girls just like fucking exponentially blows up ma ma ma um although that

01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,760
i just blasted into it uh it was maybe we'll come you know we'll come back to come back to it okay

701
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,600
uh moment i love you replaying i love you did you like me doing all the impressions it's a very

702
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:58,560
deep question what are oh hold on right hold on hold on what are some ways companies can

703
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:06,400
companies set up right whoever sent this question one using spell check and two i can't read properly

704
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:12,800
what are some ways companies can set up stuff so the company itself can protect their talents

705
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:21,840
fun set aside for legal concerns taxes content eight screenshots platform liaisons

706
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:28,960
anti anti stuff teaching the ropes um i think just being realistic like if you have been a

707
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,320
content creator and then you're behind the scenes you know what the girls are up against like um

708
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:39,040
obviously we shut down the marshmallows for quite a bit because like a few of the talents

709
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:47,120
were having issues and like i guess that was like a measure to basically we took on we got the girls

710
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,760
feedback and we were like nah forget this you're done so um and we were like right everyone off

711
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,520
marshmallow right now don't reply don't do nothing we're fucked up we made a mistake

712
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,040
sure do love when the xbox servers are done have the servers down

713
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,960
okay if another idiot comes up with mirrors i'm gonna play doom in real nah

714
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,200
ah barely audible oh did i do a tiny little burp there i wasn't paying attention

715
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:19,040
um taxes again don't actually spend the money until you paid the tax you should always hold 30

716
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:25,920
percent back uh i guess if you want tax uh content aid so uh that's like collaborations with people

717
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:33,280
outside of the agency um that's like putting advertisement money in shorts for example so

718
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:40,320
we do something that i don't think any other agency really offers we pay for the shorts to be made

719
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:46,080
for the talents we make the thumbnails for them their schedules all that we try and give them at

720
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,640
least stuff possible they're obviously the only overwhelming problem is like i took a while to

721
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:58,320
find the editors and get settled with the editors like um a few of them couldn't do it a few of them

722
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:04,720
uh now currently have ongoing in real life obligations which caused a massive backlog

723
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:12,880
like that's why irisa is my personal clipper because um i was just having so many issues

724
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,640
and at the rate the shorts were being made it was like at one point one person was making all the

725
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:26,480
shorts and it was like no that's just not viable at all um but azura is next to get shorts and

726
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,200
then shebe's getting a batch and then i think by that point we will have four people who can make

727
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,160
clips on at the same time but a lot of in real life stuff happened in their lives which caused a

728
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,720
massive backlog and it's caused an issue because i would have wanted a lot more shorts out by now

729
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,360
i don't know for me it's a respect thing there are people at least try to treat them as proper

730
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:52,880
human beings and not circus freaks uh communication is key um what are you saying

731
01:24:53,680 --> 01:25:00,640

and i don't spot it where's hold on hold on

791
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:46,640
easter egg in emi's interview she used the phrase keep yourself safe kiss your sister where

792
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,640
keep yourself safe

793
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,920
on the internet safety part

794
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,440
don't compare some friends of people consume quite a certain keep yourself safe please

795
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:19,280
i don't i don't actually think that's an easter egg i think that's actually just

796
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,520
uh what she meant like genuinely keep yourself safe i don't actually think that's an easter egg

797
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,040
because she said please if it was an easter egg it would be keep yourself safe

798
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,760
no i think she may or may not have actually actually i don't think that's an easter egg

799
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,880
this month was fantastic thank you for everything you did and that you're doing

800
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,840
seeing how excited and happy you are makes me feel so good and honestly inspires me oh yeah

801
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:52,720
can you say how can you keep up with everything i think i would die in two seconds um so

802
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,760
i basically don't experience what people explain burnout to be

803
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,720
and the reason i don't experience it is thanks to autism i don't know how i got lucky with that

804
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:08,400
kind of autism but i did um i basically now don't get me wrong i can get frustrated and fatigued

805
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:14,720
but when i go to bed and then when i wake up it's like a fresh new day like let's go again

806
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:20,720
and one of the best things that i am able to do is i say to myself as long as i do one thing a day

807
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,680
so after i finish stream i say to myself i'll do one thing a day if that's editing an audio

808
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:31,280
collab if that's you know writing a script collab or something like that um as long as i do that

809
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:37,280
then you know we're on the up and up that's all i need to do um just one thing a day um maybe i can

810
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,680
impart that wisdom to you with that phrase and just say one thing a day doesn't matter how big

811
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:47,040
or small it is like if you are a bed rotting max or that one thing a day can literally be brushing

812
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:51,360
your teeth and then roll back in a bed one thing a day that's it all you got to do one thing a day

813
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:59,280
um that's uh the reason why i can do it to end others might not be able to

814
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:06,160
uh can we send save for work bibbutes on marshmallow yeah how does catbox work also

815
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,880
um it's like a website you put your link in it and then you send me the link here

816
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,560
what's the news on a new set of emotes uh any og sands

818
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:31,360

819
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:37,600
mercies have been ordered i noticed a lot of hearts yeah one thing a day has been my philosophy

820
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:44,000
for a long time then you have fantastic philosophy unironically it is a bed rotting max or yeah like

821
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
you can get pheromone max or see that's myself not beating the high wisdom allegations that's not

822
01:34:50,000 --> 01:35:00,480
wisdom mythic pool honestly mythic pool not to some combination honestly um depression max and

823
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,000
yeah if you're depression max and you're one thing a day literally make your bed brush your

824
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,880
teeth get a glass of water something like that that's that's all you need to do the new ic emotes

825
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,080
are amazing yes emmy's are up next up on the chopping block um i will be putting placeholders

826
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:21,280
in their emotes so you'll notice a ton of hearts um that is because emmy has eight hearts that's

827
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,480
because emmy i say sorry has eight hearts that's because she can already order eight more emotes

828
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,200
thanks to all the membership uh tier support that you guys are showing her so she's already got

937
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:04,960
probably isn't that good but the future seems pretty gloom so i'll stick right here in this timeline

938
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:12,560
uh uh you know born too late to see something born too early to see the future born in the same

939
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:21,440
timeline the strony calls a hungry jacks or mackers uh i get the absolute a screaming

940

950
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:30,320
this concept called the asmr booth and it's it's growing arms legs it has hair it's probably got

951

brain cells at this point um basically i get to tingle you in person and put a mask on you and

952
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:44,640

have the talents discussed uh in uh alternative collab audios yes uh next month is when the

982
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:21,360
first alternative collabs come out um it is a tip please understand that some of the girls have

983
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:27,920
only just started doing solo audios so to already jump into a collab audio is quite a high stretch

984
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:32,160
so please don't be weird and like this is so disappointing you think that's gonna be the only

985
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:41,600
one they'll ever make please i'm gonna i'm gonna throw up an anger shadow box and over here okay

986
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:49,200
rip i'm on speakers i'm so sorry please lower your volume of me that was uncalled for i think my

987
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:55,040
heart beat went up all of a sudden why is it that round pizzas come in square boxes for transport

988
01:54:55,040 --> 01:55:02,560
mains um if you have a square box sitting on a car seat for example um it is more likely to stay

989
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:07,440
put and stay steady so transport much easier yes yes but if it was a circle imagine that thing rolling

990
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:12,720
around in the back seat get in that thing would be trashed by the time it got delivered um or you

991
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:18,880
took it back home if you go and pick up your what the fuck is that noise oh it's my chair sorry my

992
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:28,960

993
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:36,640

994
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:40,400
that because it's related to the girls tea did you guys ever decide whether you're gonna use

995
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:46,480
bansley or not uh the girls can stream on it this month uh if they want to smile um i'm not

998
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:04,720
never used the streaming service uh vealer has made me think about getting into v-tube and what

999
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:11,040
advice would you give someone delete all that shit delete every lick of your legal name online

1000

tell your parents that you're earning money um or your family that you're earning money uh just in

1002
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:29,520
case they turn on you i've had so many horror stories of um girls telling me they told their

1003
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:35,280
family they earned money and now they're in a horror situation where like they're the breadwinner

1004
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:42,480
the family type thing a it's different if you want to offer the money but get in delete yourself

big tips if you want to work hard and get a lot of stuff done okay um do you is you need to feel

01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,920
your body this sounds ridiculous but it's true if you're using your brain and you're thinking and

1027
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:28,000
your strategic doing strategies and all that you genuinely need to feel your brain in order to do

1110
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:40,960
even censor that word uh unique merchandise uh that violor might get uh in the future um once

1111
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:46,480
all the girls hit 10 000 subscribers i'm going to contact a company and see if they will entertain

1112
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:56,720
it the problem with trying to get uh a collaboration is they need we need to provide evidence of sales

1113
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:04,240
for them to even bother with what we're gonna ask for so i'm gonna wait until we're all 10 000

1114
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:10,240
subscribers i don't know if we're gonna get a shared one that might be the only way where all

1115
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:20,560
our faces are on the same package um but if we do get it the girls will be releasing a free public

1116
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:28,080
audio that would complement this unique merchandise we may or may not get

1117
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:37,520
