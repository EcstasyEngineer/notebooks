0	14000	This is my favorite kind of ASMR, so if you can bear with me and ask your cup of tea,
14000	19000	I have a hell of a lot of tingles to show you.
19000	26000	I'm basically, I'm not really gonna be editin' out any like bumps and stuff so the audio's
26000	34000	more organic cause some people really like the rambling aspect and like the more, it's
34000	41000	not genuine but when you like hardcore edit something and make it like so professional
41000	46000	sometimes it can lose its charm because like you can hear me bump the microphone or for
46000	52000	example that noise you heard that was my thighs cause I'm currently like sitting on a chair
52000	62000	my legs up like not on the floor but I have an immersive array of kind of like ASMR tingles
62000	69000	to take you there, it's just kind of a little cutesy video I guess you can jump in the background
69000	76000	but like you'll, you'll hear like this kind of noise in the back cause that's my table
76000	85000	and it holds like over, I'm lookin' at it right now, it's probably got like 20 different
85000	92000	tingly things and that's with items because with ASMR you can use your bobo bobo boys
92000	100000	for tingles like repeat triggers or you can fall into the mic like see or I can actually
100000	107000	tap the mic like this or you can do ear goping like I get you know there's so much you can
107000	115000	freakin' do it it's amazing but I saw, I would literally surprise go one by one and just
115000	125000	kind of do a little ear cleaning with a brush this is just a generic, it's actually a brush
125000	137000	that came with Clean Your PC set and thank you to the radio microphone that I have
137000	146000	the silicone ears, they actually sound pretty accurate to what you would hear like if you
146000	153000	press your actual ears and in real life you can hear the do do do like da da da da
153000	165000	hopefully I'm making sense but this is just this generic, general ear brush and you know
165000	173000	everyone, instead of everyone chase, everyone has different tingles so I may do something
173000	181000	that's not really for you but this is kind of a quick, fire type of ASMR session so
181000	189000	don't you worry if you're like that sounds awful strongy, it's a lot to say awful
189000	195000	or maybe I should do a guest tingles, okay you'll never actually guess what this is
196000	200000	hear it, okay this is against your ear
204000	213000	if anyone said sponge, congrats I'm coming down, yeah because I don't even know how you would guess that's a sponge
219000	222000	honestly it just sounds like a crisp packet
226000	236000	did you tingle, did you, did you, did you, that's right, tingle harder for me
239000	245000	and okay, like I'm gonna be honest, you guys are probably like, you should probably use
245000	251000	grips all the time and a bloody should because this is for hands, I get too excited
252000	257000	and then I break the freaking sound barrier because I'm gonna have to put a filter on this audio
257000	262000	so I'm not like going to lift what other tingles have I got
262000	274000	okay, listen to this right, this is, this is on here, it's a cotton ball but if I shove it in your ear canal
274000	276000	listen to this
281000	293000	please help me you're tingling
302000	308000	some people as fast as them are does well sometimes
308000	313000	but I feel like I've, I've, I've attempted to make it in the past right
313000	323000	but whenever I've done it I feel like I'm taking the best because like it's more supposed to be like nice
323000	328000	and slow and relaxing here
328000	330000	so if I just shove up and go
333000	337000	how the fuck are you supposed to tingle for that, like honestly come with me
337000	348000	anyway, do you hear this, this is a plastic, plastic, uh, a silicon ball
348000	352000	there's tons of other silicon balls inside it
352000	356000	and if I press it against your ear it sounds like you're under water with me
356000	359000	yeah look, because I'm a gottlefish, uh uh uh, okay
367000	369000	oh yeah
369000	372000	it's like a chair, I don't know what it is
380000	383000	you like my putting that against your ear
384000	386000	hmm
394000	395000	oh yeah
395000	398000	I admit I cooked with that one
398000	400000	I found it in the thrush shop
402000	406000	and I think I must say it's also a smartest use
406000	413000	it's always like I actually don't want to use that sound so when I look for one
413000	419000	and I found out, I think this is probably like one of those 10, 10 tingles for me
419000	425000	there's some tingles that are like, sorry I'm gonna have to stand up to grab the next item
425000	429000	because, what the fuck was that noise?
430000	432000	so many
432000	435000	oh, I'll tell you all the popular ones
435000	438000	hair brushing is always popular
438000	443000	this is my, the pins on the brush, like peep peep peep
443000	447000	do you remember when Emmy's code name was pins?
447000	448000	hey hey hey
448000	451000	you guys all guessed she was a fiddle
452000	455000	but she's my fiddle doll
459000	460000	wow
462000	465000	do you remember when my code name went inks?
469000	472000	and then I call all you comments that are like
472000	477000	oh it's gonna be weird getting used to your name being so droney
477000	482000	but I feel like it just made sense
482000	486000	because obviously I got to name everyone
487000	490000	and I quite like literal names
490000	493000	this is just me being like babaga
493000	499000	but if like, feature verse come out and their names are like
499000	505000	you know, bag of gaijin at the end when their English is being feature verse
505000	508000	and my name is gonna remember your name
508000	511000	oh, and then this is me being really hypocritical
511000	514000	because obviously I started naming them after French, right?
517000	520000	just a quick front there
520000	523000	I'm called Coles because I'm a Coles
523000	527000	she be is literal because she's Shabari
527000	530000	she be, and then Colvin Bump because she has a tail
530000	533000	so she has Colin on her bum
536000	541000	Emmy bees, oh, you know what, I've just said the most hypocritical thing
541000	544000	because Emmy's name is Japanese and French
544000	548000	her name means family because
548000	552000	you know what, I'm gonna speak it back to the ASMR
552000	557000	because this is just me being a silly dude with
557000	562000	okay, so you can have like
562000	567000	earphones on the microphone like
568000	574000	but there are also
574000	579000	tools and apparatuses to make such a noise
579000	583000	so either this will be too fast to enjoy
583000	587000	but you
587000	592000	trying to make it too loud
593000	597000	that's actually a really big behind the scenes thing
597000	602000	that I have to like stop talking
602000	607000	and then do the tingle and then lure over the actual video
607000	612000	because some tingles are just far too loud
612000	615000	to do at the same time stalking
615000	618000	and then again it takes away from the organic appeal
618000	622000	of the video but like it's just kind of
622000	625000	the cookie crumbles in the nicest way
625000	628000	I'm bumping fucking everything by the way
628000	631000	okay
631000	634000	so you hear me touch this
634000	637000	sounds better all along
637000	640000	what could it be
640000	644000	oh, fuck that up
644000	647000	it's like one of them frogs
650000	654000	he's actually a bit loud
657000	661000	look, I'm not really a big fan
661000	665000	I can tap a slow feet with a wood
665000	669000	and the wee wood thing actually likes that much more than
669000	672000	what the perky was designed for
672000	675000	the hail, you know what
675000	677000	unironically though
677000	680000	that's life, like you could be
680000	682000	you're responding to do one thing
682000	685000	but you're better at another thing, you know
685000	689000	so don't feel the pressure to be this thing that you're not
689000	691000	wow, we're getting philosophical
691000	695000	and I'm smacking a wooden frog with a stick
695000	698000	but I'm actually being for real though
698000	700000	that's actually kind of true because I'll say this
700000	702000	over and over again
702000	705000	I have problems reading and writing
705000	709000	my entire income and job is being paced around
709000	711000	reading and writing
711000	713000	so like, I'm not ever embarrassed about it
713000	717000	like, if you've ever watched me in a live stream
717000	720000	whenever I'd write something I have to read it for it to clear
720000	724000	like, if I wanted to spell A.C.'s name
724000	729000	her name is an I-C-E-Y
729000	732000	her name is I-C-E-Y-A
732000	735000	like, I would say it
735000	738000	I'm like, I'm not even embarrassed about it
738000	740000	who gives a rat's fucking arms
740000	743000	oh, this is a Japanese ear cleaning tool
743000	748000	I love, love, I love this trigger so much
748000	752000	don't worry, I'm gonna subtitle this video
752000	756000	I love this trigger so freaking much
756000	759000	it's so good and fluffy
759000	761000	and like, you can hear
761000	764000	as well, actually, while I've got you here
764000	768000	I'm gonna show you the difference between an ear cleaner
768000	771000	and a Japanese tool, if I'm not mistaken
771000	774000	ear cleaner, okay, got it, got it, got it
774000	776000	okay
787000	789000	hold on, hold on
796000	800000	okay, I have three different things on my hand right now
800000	803000	this is Japanese ear cleaning tool
805000	810000	right
810000	813000	and then this one is
813000	815000	I want to do your most comment
815000	818000	this one's an ear cleaner
818000	822000	this is a Q-tip to Americans
822000	825000	you see how it's different
827000	831000	and then one more ear cleaning thing
831000	834000	this is a cotton pad
834000	838000	which is used for makeup removal in the ear
843000	846000	now an argument
846000	849000	okay, I just realized
849000	852000	I'm leaving your other ear out, forgive me
852000	854000	I'm so focused
855000	858000	but to hear the deepness
859000	862000	that was the cotton pad
862000	865000	I prefer deep ASMR sounds
865000	868000	I find them relaxing
868000	870000	and all that jazz
870000	873000	but I will say the Japanese ear cleaning tool
873000	875000	is so superior
875000	877000	like, I can't even find any
877000	880000	and that's like, I would give it a 10 out of 10
880000	882000	definitely
884000	887000	oh, there's another 10 out of 10 organ I was saying
887000	891000	this is just like, literally a dropper bowl
895000	897000	yeah, peach
897000	899000	I don't have any liquid in that
900000	903000	maybe you can help me along with like
903000	905000	that's terrible, that's terrible
905000	908000	this is for tingling, this is for peachy
908000	911000	peachy 13, okay
911000	914000	we have some people who like
914000	917000	medical sounds, like medical role play
917000	920000	and the level dropper bowl is like a pretty good
923000	926000	because like, sometimes an ASMR sound
926000	930000	doesn't even have to be something that is a tool of it
930000	932000	where the heck is me
933000	935000	and I've lost me glove
935000	938000	I've got a little glove that I like to use
938000	941000	I think it makes like a really good sound
941000	945000	like, tell me, tell me it doesn't sound like you're in the nurse's office right now
945000	947000	like, come on
948000	950000	if I can get a one
954000	957000	are you ready for your prostate in my chin?
959000	962000	but yeah, I definitely like the latex
962000	965000	but like, in combination with the dropper
966000	969000	got to feel it mercy actually
969000	972000	no fingerprints, no traces left
973000	976000	got this, this is just me
978000	980000	just promoting everyone
980000	983000	then he made me, I think they blow off
983000	984000	unless
986000	989000	can I take your tapping on glove on?
996000	998000	I think it does look like a nice
998000	1001000	I'm a bit, I'm a bit biased, a bit partial
1001000	1004000	I wouldn't say latex gloves are a 10 out of 10 tingle
1004000	1007000	but I would say they rank awfully high
1009000	1011000	okay, this one
1011000	1013000	I hope you didn't hear that
1013000	1015000	I hope I didn't ruin it
1016000	1018000	this one's a 10 out of 10
1019000	1021000	how
1024000	1026000	how much 10 out of 10
1029000	1031000	the problem with these
1031000	1033000	is you have to do it slowly
1033000	1035000	but you're against gravity
1036000	1039000	because like, if I just do it really quick
1039000	1041000	that's not tingly, is it?
1041000	1043000	get a t-fuck if it's tingly
1049000	1052000	must not make such a sound right now
1052000	1055000	did you hear that turtle for?
1061000	1064000	but here you have to slow
1071000	1074000	it's definitely a good one
1075000	1077000	isn't it?
1077000	1079000	one more
1089000	1091000	I want to read, baby
1093000	1097000	what is all this going to do, ASMR or is that a purple one?
1098000	1101000	no, this is lab ASMR
1101000	1103000	of course I'm purple
1104000	1106000	okay, actually
1107000	1109000	that was so loud
1109000	1112000	don't worry, I'll edit it in post-production
1112000	1114000	so it doesn't break your ears
1114000	1116000	but that broke my ears
1116000	1119000	because I can hear myself into the microphone
1119000	1122000	I use a Tascam to capture it
1122000	1124000	I'm in a recording booth
1124000	1126000	but it's such a waste of fucking money
1126000	1129000	but you can still hear me
1129000	1131000	I've put earmuffs on you
1135000	1137000	Vicky
1137000	1140000	I like this sound
1141000	1144000	I like this sound because it's so soft
1151000	1154000	I think the deeper noises
1154000	1157000	this is an example of a deeper noise tingle
1158000	1160000	that definitely has my
1160000	1162000	appreciation
1164000	1166000	because
1168000	1170000	when it's like soothing and deeper
1170000	1172000	like this is my theory
1172000	1174000	but you didn't have to believe me
1174000	1176000	you didn't have to, it's just me
1176000	1178000	because it's just me, the original
1180000	1182000	but I think ASMR
1182000	1184000	is also locked into
1185000	1187000	you don't want a baby to come soon
1187000	1189000	and you have to like
1189000	1192000	get soothed by like really loud noises
1192000	1194000	and all of that
1194000	1196000	I think that comfort
1196000	1199000	possibly is linked to the
1199000	1202000	comfort that ASMR can bring
1202000	1204000	not the tingles, not the tingles
1204000	1206000	but the comfort
1206000	1208000	which is why these deeper noises
1208000	1211000	are so unbelievably soothing
1211000	1213000	because that was
1213000	1215000	literally the first like
1215000	1217000	state of
1217000	1219000	just pure bliss, you know
1219000	1221000	like when you were in your most
1221000	1223000	tummy
1223000	1225000	you didn't have to pay taxes
1225000	1226000	you didn't have to
1226000	1228000	like any work
1228000	1230000	or even a concert
1230000	1232000	you just sat there
1232000	1234000	and you were like
1234000	1236000	who should give you all the nutrients
1236000	1237000	and you passed like shit
1237000	1239000	to the political court
1239000	1241000	I mean god
1241000	1243000	what could you ask for more in life
1244000	1247000	but that's my Thomas theory what I know T
1247000	1249000	I just don't know much about
1249000	1250000	you know what
1250000	1252000	just because you don't know something
1252000	1253000	doesn't mean you can't
1253000	1255000	you can't make a statement
1255000	1257000	that's wrong and loud ok
1257000	1259000	I raised my case
1259000	1261000	this is where I make my stand
1261000	1263000	I'm looking over the mic now
1263000	1265000	to see if there's other triggers
1265000	1267000	I've messed up on and there is
1267000	1269000	if I can teach it
1269000	1271000	don't make me
1271000	1273000	just making you notice
1273000	1275000	ok I know I did brush in earlier
1275000	1277000	but I actually have another brush
1277000	1280000	compared to this brush I used earlier
1280000	1282000	like right
1282000	1284000	but this is a makeup brush
1284000	1286000	this one and it's so much softer
1290000	1292000	so soft
1294000	1296000	I do that's another point as well
1296000	1298000	so you don't have to only use
1298000	1300000	some more trigger
1300000	1302000	doing two at the same time
1302000	1304000	is like so good
1305000	1308000	so that's one with a brush
1308000	1310000	and the other just
1310000	1312000	my hand going over the ear
1313000	1315000	and I'm going
1317000	1320000	I'm not that good at doing triggers
1320000	1322000	I have a really spitty mouth
1322000	1324000	like I'm self-failing on and off
1328000	1330000	so it makes it a bit hard to do
1330000	1332000	like so then vocal
1332000	1334000	like talking ASMR because my mouth
1334000	1336000	always clicks like
1336000	1338000	with spit
1338000	1340000	and I don't think it's very easy
1340000	1342000	and I know I don't get me wrong
1342000	1344000	there's things called D-Clicker
1344000	1346000	which it first can like use to get rid of
1347000	1349000	but mine is like
1349000	1351000	so fake it's wrong I just rather
1351000	1353000	restart my whole sentence
1353000	1355000	you've never noticed there's like
1355000	1357000	none in this video in particular
1357000	1359000	but probably much more likely in other videos
1359000	1361000	there'll be like a cut
1361000	1363000	my mood just slightly shifts
1363000	1365000	because I've had to resource it
1365000	1367000	because my mouth won't stop
1367000	1369000	going go go go go
1369000	1371000	and clicking
1371000	1373000	wait please give me a break
1373000	1375000	I'm tired
1375000	1377000	I'm tired boss
1377000	1379000	okay what else
1379000	1381000	I'm pretty sure I saw a few others
1381000	1383000	um
1383000	1385000	alright
1385000	1387000	that was a good one
1387000	1389000	alright
1389000	1391000	one is like some professional
1391000	1393000	um
1393000	1395000	okay this one is
1395000	1397000	a cup
1397000	1399000	like it's literally just a plastic ass cup
1399000	1401000	but the reason why I like it
1401000	1403000	is because
1403000	1405000	if I put it over your ear
1412000	1414000	that sounds like fucking shit
1414000	1416000	it sounds so much better in person
1416000	1418000	I'm just gonna have to come here
1418000	1420000	to show you how much that was awful
1421000	1423000	okay this is an old
1423000	1425000	plastic phone case
1425000	1427000	so
1427000	1429000	you know you can do fingerprint
1429000	1431000	it's more like this is just my finger
1431000	1433000	being pressed against it
1435000	1436000	like in like the
1436000	1438000	the center of my skin
1438000	1440000	um or
1440000	1442000	obviously you can do your little nails
1442000	1444000	against it
1444000	1446000	and uh
1446000	1448000	just
1448000	1450000	whatever your amounts is
1452000	1454000	I hope this has been enough for
1454000	1456000	I feel like I've just yapped a bit
1456000	1458000	I'm so unmasked in our time
1458000	1460000	I'm just
1460000	1462000	I'm just gonna have to lure and edit the volume
1462000	1464000	under the case that I've made an ASMR audio
1464000	1466000	and the reality is
1466000	1468000	it's just another yap this from
1468000	1470000	here's truly
1472000	1474000	honestly I prefer to act quite
1474000	1476000	like this one
1476000	1478000	when I say it's a 10 out of 10
1478000	1480000	I think you know what
1480000	1482000	I've had fake nails on and like
1482000	1484000	the would hit a bit better
1484000	1486000	cause
1486000	1488000	cause fake nails like give that availability
1488000	1490000	of just sounding
1490000	1492000	better in more
1492000	1494000	but
1494000	1496000	I also have this
1496000	1498000	fluffy thing that I can put on
1498000	1500000	against the
1500000	1502000	ear
1502000	1504000	ear
1504000	1506000	but yes I'll talk to you on that
1506000	1508000	so you'll be able to sound like
1508000	1510000	often on my ear
1512000	1514000	and thank you
1518000	1520000	all of you baby
1526000	1528000	I'll listen to some people like
1528000	1530000	when they can hear my breathing
1530000	1532000	so
1532000	1534000	I don't
1534000	1536000	fuck
1540000	1542000	I guess breathing can be so
1542000	1544000	like I used
1544000	1546000	to get my eyelashes done
1548000	1550000	and the lady obviously had to be in
1550000	1552000	close proximity
1552000	1554000	and she would just be turning and I'd
1554000	1556000	like
1556000	1558000	because she was just like near me breathing
1558000	1560000	and I'm like I'm at a weird door
1560000	1562000	for getting tingles from breathing ASMR
1562000	1564000	but
1564000	1566000	it is what it is
1566000	1568000	you don't pick the tingles
1568000	1570000	the tingles pick you
1570000	1572000	what else am I going to
1572000	1574000	I'm sure of course I don't know
1574000	1576000	sorry I was scratching my thigh there
1578000	1580000	I have some like
1580000	1582000	it's not really
1582000	1584000	not tingling this is a
1584000	1586000	plastic pouch
1586000	1588000	it has a little click
1588000	1590000	oh that size is breaking
1592000	1594000	my sound barrier
1594000	1596000	oh dear
1596000	1598000	that one didn't
1600000	1602000	if you didn't know the task gun
1602000	1604000	will flash red
1604000	1606000	like
1606000	1608000	if I'm being too loud
1608000	1610000	it's like oh my god your tingles
1610000	1612000	are out of control lady
1612000	1614000	and so I know
1614000	1616000	when I'm being a bit too loud
1616000	1618000	but I can't see the task gun
1618000	1620000	in like every recording session
1620000	1622000	it's just not possible because of my setup
1622000	1624000	although I don't know if I should record
1624000	1626000	on my pc
1626000	1628000	but
1628000	1630000	yeah I'm toying
1634000	1636000	maybe you like plastic
1636000	1638000	fingerprints
1640000	1642000	actually sounds pretty sticky
1642000	1644000	actually kind of like that
1644000	1646000	yeah you like my sticky
1646000	1648000	fingers being on you
1660000	1662000	now there is
1662000	1664000	an ASMR
1664000	1666000	this noise
1666000	1668000	is really hard to capture
1670000	1672000	I have
1672000	1674000	two
1674000	1676000	wooden ear picks
1676000	1678000	but wooden ear picking ASMR
1678000	1680000	is really fake and hard to capture
1680000	1682000	it's just because
1682000	1684000	it sounds like I'm
1684000	1686000	fingering your ear or something
1690000	1692000	this one actually do have to like
1692000	1694000	focus a little bit on your ear
1696000	1698000	but either this is
1698000	1700000	good or just kind of sounds like
1700000	1702000	I'm brushing some around on my ear
1702000	1704000	but
1704000	1706000	I promise
1706000	1708000	I have two wooden ear picks
1712000	1714000	oh I can maybe
1714000	1716000	add tweezers
1716000	1718000	hold on
1718000	1720000	some people like tweezers
1720000	1722000	sounds but
1722000	1724000	that's the only sound they make
1724000	1726000	they don't like make a natural sound
1726000	1728000	I think
1728000	1730000	for visual ASMR
1730000	1732000	I would make some visual ASMR
1732000	1734000	and I can show you many
1734000	1736000	else
1736000	1738000	cause I like
1738000	1740000	my nails so
1740000	1742000	yeah for you
1748000	1750000	well yes
1750000	1752000	mister
1752000	1754000	your ears are delightfully clean
1754000	1756000	but there's nothing
1756000	1758000	that
1758000	1760000	is bad what
1760000	1762000	sounds I'm going with here
1762000	1764000	try to see your ears are clean
1764000	1766000	but I'll just clean them further
1766000	1768000	which makes no sense
1768000	1770000	but that's okay
1770000	1772000	I'm allowed to be dumb
1772000	1774000	and I
1774000	1776000	forgive myself
1776000	1778000	yeah
1778000	1780000	you like the way those ear picks and tweezers
1780000	1782000	feel that's right
1782000	1784000	no
1786000	1788000	I mean
1788000	1790000	I would say I did a decent
1790000	1792000	thing over here
1792000	1794000	how long have we been recording for
1794000	1796000	I have no idea
1796000	1798000	how long have I been there in minutes
1800000	1802000	I've been yapping for 30 minutes
1802000	1804000	why have you left me yapping for so long
1804000	1806000	what the hell
1806000	1808000	how has it been 30 minutes
1808000	1810000	oh my god I've got problems
1810000	1812000	seriously
1812000	1814000	I mean maybe it's less
1814000	1816000	but because I had to edit some stuff
1816000	1818000	I hope
1818000	1820000	I'm leaving my tummy noises in
1820000	1822000	so
1822000	1824000	hopefully
1824000	1826000	you're asleep by now
1826000	1828000	and if you're not then
1828000	1830000	I'll be hearing so many awful eyes away
1830000	1832000	and
1832000	1834000	I'll just put it away
1834000	1836000	for a little bit
1836000	1838000	I don't know
1838000	1840000	okay
1840000	1842000	wait I'm sure I had a few more tangles
1842000	1844000	wait don't go yet don't leave
1844000	1846000	I want to show you more
1846000	1848000	okay
1848000	1850000	I see
1850000	1852000	I said I see
1852000	1854000	no I say
1854000	1856000	I said I say snow pose
1856000	1858000	I said I see visually
1858000	1860000	okay I'll call it three more triggers
1860000	1862000	and then I'll let you go
1862000	1864000	okay I'll let you go
1864000	1866000	you do it in the ear
1866000	1868000	okay
1868000	1870000	okay you heard me move one of them
1870000	1872000	but don't
1872000	1874000	this one
1874000	1876000	it's like a little
1876000	1878000	water thing
1878000	1880000	and I can just
1880000	1882000	that went on my face
1882000	1884000	I didn't realize it was pointed on me
1884000	1886000	so
1886000	1888000	I can't do it against the ears a little bit
1888000	1890000	but you know
1890000	1892000	no one wants to put water in your very
1892000	1894000	expensive equipment
1894000	1896000	this equipment was expensive
1896000	1898000	was it worth it? I don't know yet
1900000	1902000	but yeah
1902000	1904000	oh yeah
1904000	1906000	oh I can do it
1906000	1908000	oh
1908000	1910000	yeah
1910000	1912000	oh you feel so refreshed
1912000	1914000	listen up to this ASMR
1914000	1916000	okay the other one
1916000	1918000	this one's quite loud so I might not talk
1918000	1920000	too much during it because I'll need to lower
1920000	1922000	the volume
1922000	1924000	but I got
1924000	1926000	pop rocks I'm not going to do it
1926000	1928000	but like I'm going to shake the packet
1928000	1930000	of the pop rocks
1952000	1954000	I'm not being funny I was so
1954000	1956000	unbelievably loud
1956000	1958000	okay last angle
1958000	1960000	and this one's a 10 out of 10 for me
1960000	1962000	okay
1962000	1964000	you can totally hear it actually
1964000	1966000	oh oh oh
1966000	1968000	are you ready?
1968000	1970000	see
1982000	1984000	so
2012000	2014000	so
2034000	2036000	why did you think I was
2036000	2038000	double ASMR
2038000	2040000	and it's like what's one of my top 10s as well
2040000	2042000	but if you're not asleep by now
2046000	2048000	I'm not sure what I can do
2048000	2050000	um
2050000	2052000	I could keep down that tingle
2052000	2054000	until you are asleep
2054000	2056000	would that be fine?
2056000	2058000	like I wouldn't talk anymore
2058000	2060000	because I feel like if I keep talking
2060000	2062000	this was keeping you awake
2062000	2064000	cause you're like what's the next tingle straw
2064000	2066000	right
2066000	2068000	I'll make you a deal
2070000	2072000	you close your eyes
2072000	2074000	you're nice and comfy
2074000	2076000	I will keep
2076000	2078000	tickling you
2078000	2080000	to prove that tickling ASMR
2080000	2082000	is like one of the superior triggers
2082000	2084000	because like breathing
2084000	2086000	is good and all like
2090000	2092000	but I think
2092000	2094000	tickling in this case
2094000	2096000	I just need to prove it's superior
2096000	2098000	so I'll let you go now
2098000	2100000	but thank you
2100000	2102000	for listening to me rub
2102000	2104000	for the 8 minutes
2104000	2106000	since I eat always there
2106000	2108000	5 minutes
2108000	2110000	okay
2110000	2112000	jesh
2112000	2114000	my shh
2114000	2116000	okay I'll let you go
2116000	2118000	and I'm going to do a double ASMR
2118000	2120000	and I'll see you on the other side okay
2120000	2122000	bye
2122000	2124000	I'm gonna let you do a smart ear kiss
2124000	2126000	just one kiss
2126000	2128000	okay
2128000	2130000	but what ear should I do it on
2130000	2132000	this one
2132000	2134000	I feel biased to this ear
