So I'm gonna try and be a bit tamer, cause I don't want to scare her.

That's relax.

495
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,080
It's a dead name reference.

496
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,040
That's a dead name reference.

497
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,040
Relax.

498
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,040

My apologies.

500
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,960
I just, she is fine, she's fine.

501
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,960
People couldn't give less of a shit, me being hyper.

502
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,840
Um, right, who, who is that, okay, thang, that was a really good game.

503
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:21,600
Remove from group, and then we'll go to page number three, one, two, three, four.

504
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,240
And then, and then we'll do page four, and then we'll do page one, then we'll do page

505
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,840
two, and then elementary P. You can still call Mikri, it's okay, you forgot about me.

506
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,040
I wonder if other members will be able to laugh at how toxic you get your game.

507
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,480
I don't, I don't think that, I would say one thing about being a steamer, you do not have

508
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,480
time to watch.

509
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:51,560
It's, it is so hard to watch, like, ah, now before anyone calls me a fake, um, oh it's

510
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,440
pro gamer, not programmer, pro get a meh error.

511
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,160
Hey mama glad I could help as much as I could, I'm just going for BTW.

512
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,760
Yeah, you did it, you fucking are rolling a wrecking a deck and dredging karma, thank

513
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:13,440
you for the super chat, um, yeah, that, what was I saying, I had a point, oh, um, you

514
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,320
could do custom 5v5 if you want, I think we might have to do that, so I want to give

515
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,280
everyone the opportunity to play like an actual game together, like live game against people.

516
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,320
Um, right, what is this team going to be called?

517
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:33,840
You go, you're, we're team nuca cola because I have a cola, don't mind me, nuca cola.

518
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,480
So, ah, I'm just going to play for as long as I can, I'm going to try and get everyone

519
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:44,320
in a game with me, like in a public match, however, if like we're getting to like ever

520
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:50,320
six and I'm starting to be like, I'm needing to go for a bath, I'll throw us into 5v5 and

521
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:56,400
then I'll start commentating because I'm about to unlock comms on game number 10,

522
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,120
who goes there? I'm burping and I'm not even drank the cola already, okay?

523
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:12,960
Um, why the eight hours ago someone sent a marshmallow, I just took a big job and I feel

524
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,600
and I feel good, do you know this feeling that feeling of pure bliss and happiness after taking

525
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,280
a nice job? I feel amazing, I could conquer the world right now. Sir, that was prostate

526
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:30,960
simulation. You said that with full confidence, that was prostate stimulation. What the fuck?

527
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,560
What the fuck? It hit it on the way out, that's why you feel euphoric.

528
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:48,080
What? Oh my god, what's a jobby? Jobby is a slang for poop in Scots. A jobby is what you do

529
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:53,200
when you finish work and then you sit on the toilet for 30 minutes in your home, that is a jobby,

530
01:02:53,200 --> 01:03:00,400
a post-work jobby. You guys are turning Scots, I'm telling you, I'm starting to get more Scottish

531
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:08,240
slang in my marshmallows. No, it's true, it's true. Well, I hope I'm not late. Nah, the party

532
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:20,240
just getting started. Deeply departed, the party's getting started. I was still wondered where I've been.

533
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,880
Okay, come on, come on, find us that lobby. I don't know what my ping was last game but I

534
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,000
couldn't blame the ping because I was just, I was just doing so good. The Scotification is

535
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,240
taking, it actually is though, like how's the hypnosis going? Oh yeah, I know everyone's Scottish

536
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,920
and I was like, well, that's not what I asked and I was like, no, it is what you asked. Well, we

537
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:51,760
take a look at what we can... Is this fire? New Frontiers Season 12 news. Oh, I like her voice.

538
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,360
It is nice to meet you. What is she?

539
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:07,840
What's her accent? Oh, I thought Hanamura was back. I said Clash Map.

540
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,040
Wait, they have Team Deathmatch?

541
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:23,520
New Clash Map. Wait, it's not Capture Point? They never changed them? I thought they were bringing

542
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,640
them back. What's the Clash Map?

543
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:47,360
Oh, I like that music from the background. Do you hear that? She's an alien. Her accent is Martian.

544
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,800
Future is pissing me off. It keeps lagging the stream and she is mean. I mean, ah, it's Mercy.

545
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,920
Oh, wait, no, she's Canadian. Sorry.

546
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:11,040
That one is Mer. Poland? Is that Poland? Poland Mentioned?

547
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,240
Poland Mentioned? What color? What flag was that?

548
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:31,040
Oh, it's Indonesia. Oh, sorry. It's Indonesia. Sorry. My apologies. There's only any posters.

549
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:43,680
Right, okay. What am I going to do? I've played Zarya, so obviously I need to play some...

550
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:51,120
What am I going to do? Okay, we'll play characters that I've not played.

551
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,120
And then you can see how bad I am with the characters that I don't play in general.

552
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:06,160
The deadlock game. My name is McCree and I'm here to fix you. I wish McCree sounded like Mater.

553
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,120
Right, how do I... No, wait, hold on. It's been a while. Hold on. I'm trying to find my...

554
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,200
That's the logo. No, how do I do my communication wheel? Okay, I'm up. Oh, there we go.

555
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:24,320
My ping is 250. I should not be on DPS. I should be a... I should be a little Mercy heal bot.

556
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:33,600
Where did you go? 260 ping. I'm just aiming. I'm just aiming in the general vicinity.

557
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,800
There is... I am not able to shoot that far out of the sky.

558
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:49,920
I don't even hit one thing yet. Who is that? That's not a tank. Oh, that's a new tank. Go away.

559
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,960
Go away. Oh my god, this is terrible. What is he doing?

560
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:07,040
What is that? There's red stuff going on. Oh my gosh. No! Oh my god, there's no way.

561
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,080
So, we're not winning. I think I'm going to swap to Mercy. I'm not even kidding.

562
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,200
If no one's on Mercy, warning, you know, Reflins, I'm on Mercy.

563
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,960
Bruv. Nothing's happening. I'm just here for a good time. Is this, like, drop, fall off as well?

564
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,120
Did they change his, like, damage fall off? Bruv, make me a little heal slot. I kid you not.

565
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,200
I'm taking the L. I'm taking the L on this map, and I'll be a little slag for you, because what is this?

566
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:41,440
What is this? I'm better. I'm literally better doing this than fucking aiming. Oh god,

567
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:49,120
our tank is down. Monka is. Monka is. I'm trying. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my god,

568
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,160
I can't wait to be Mercy, and I don't have to think. What is this? Who is? Go away. I'm scared.

569
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,760
Oh my god, Junkrat does not care. He's going for it. Junkrat said,

570
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,920
feel busy. What's going on up here?

571
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:15,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. Right, I have. What? How did, wait, Juno looks so funny doing that.

572
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:22,960
Bruv, I'm actually going to have to aim. Bruv, come on. I'm having to aim and, like,

573
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,200
Bruv, the fall off. Bruv, I might as well be Widow.

574
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,600
Oh, buddy, hope not. Oh my god, I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

575
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:47,440
I see an enemy too. What's going on? I'm spraying. I'm spraying. This is the, this is the gameplay.

576
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:04,400
I didn't know what was happening. I'm sorry. Oh no, no, no. Leave me alone, please. I'm just

577
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,080
a shame. I agree with you. Perfect. Leave me alone, please. What? I'm on fire. Oh my god,

578
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,160
he has Dragon's Breath. That's not against the Jeeves convention, so I'll let you have it.

579
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,680
Oh, get the tap off. Tap off. I repeat. I hit him once. I hit him once. I did my job. I did

580
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:24,480
my job as DPS. I hit him once. That's all I had to do. Come on. You know the rules. You know the

581
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,360
rules. That's all I had to do. Hit him once. The fire perished herself.

582
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:36,960
Okay, look at that aimbot. Gorgeous. I don't even know how I've not died yet. I'm not,

583
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:46,320
bruh, please. Tank, you better get back. You are going on a suicide mission over there, as am I.

584
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:07,360
Oh, not to... Oh, sorry. I didn't even know the... I'm sorry. This is not for me, right? I'm going

585
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:14,480
to stay on McCree. No. Can I go to Torbjorn? I'm going to Torbjorn because Torbjorn has a turret

586
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,960
that can automatically hit the enemy, so I don't have to aim. So then the pink problem is solved.

587
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:28,960
Five head. Five head. I don't have to aim when it's like this, so I'm going to put it right

588
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,240
back here, so it's really annoying, and the enemy team can't get it, and then I'm going to have

589
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:41,600
my ultimate and like... Hold on, let me focus up. Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah.

590
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:50,560
Drank swalalala. Drank swa... Oh, yeah, piss. Oh my god, but my wee... Oh, my turret's down. No.

591
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,880
My five head move. Get your wood off my screen right now.

592
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:06,160
Last time, I'm speedish. Oh no, are they going to push it? I don't have my ultimate. I can't stop it.

593
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,880
I don't have my... I don't have my ultimate. Hold on. Pop that right there. No. I reached it. No.

594
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:24,160
No, I reached it. We messed up. We did a booboo. Oh my god, sorry, but I'm going to have to stick

595
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:29,440
to Torbjorn. Give me Australian servers and give me D.Va right now. You know exactly what's

596
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,840
going to happen. You know it. You know, they're scared to give me the low ping, because they

597
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,520
know exactly what happens when I have low ping. I should have fucking asked, okay.

598
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:46,400
Right, we must group up together, and by group up together, I mean stuff and things. That's right,

599
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,480
Farrah, I dare you to fly again. I dare you to fly. Would be a shame if you flew up in the sky,

600
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,320
wouldn't it? Yes. I think she was waiting to get healed.

601
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,320
No, leave the payload alone. Go away. That's not even hurting anyone. Oh, that's right. I'm

602
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:15,040
applying real pressure. This is some real pressure. I'm actually the tank. I'm actually the tank.

603
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,520
I'm going for Mercy's ankles. I'm backing up. I'm backing up. I repeat. I'm backing up. I'm

604
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,960
getting the fuck off his. Oh my God. And then my tank comes in clutch. Oh, what? Was that not

605
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:31,520
behind that? Or am I going mental? Was it fire? Was it incinerary? It must have been incinerary.

606
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,040
Okay, I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm coming. I'm coming back. I'm coming up the

607
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:47,440
stairs. The payload might be moving, but my turret is shmoving. Oh, actually, absolutely. Annihilium.

608
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,960
Oh, oh, that's what I like to see on the stairs. Soldier on the stairs. Soldier on the stairs.

609
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,760
Okay, I missed every shot. That's embarrassing. Don't look. Don't look. He never saw that.

610
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,080
That was embarrassing. Hydration check.

611
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,120
What's your ID? Damn, what are you? Fucking bartender? It's pinned. Sorry, I'm being cheeky.

612
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,800
It's pinned in the chat. You can see it above. This deep ruggle. Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

613
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,680
Here he comes. He comes. Oh, yeah, you're going to ult, Pharah. Oh, yeah, you're going to ult.

614
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:35,200
What? Are you joking? Are you serious? Wait, so Mogas. Mogas is ult. Bro, I can't touch that.

615
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:41,840
I literally can't touch that. Maybe now. Maybe now. Maybe now. I'm stalling. I'm stalling.

616
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:49,760
I'm stalling. I'm kind of doing okay. I'm kind of stalling. I might have ultimate. No,

617
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,600
my turret's down. Maybe I should have put it further back in the hotel, and then it would have

618
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,800
been a bit more of a boulder. Ooh, they might be able to hold it. They might be able to do it.

619
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,880
Oh, no. Drag it right back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up. Back up like how I back

620
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:15,040
up on your tentacle. I'll be twerking on that shit. Okay, okay. Let's get right into the being an

621
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:22,080
annoying enemy. Right, they're going to destroy my turret. That's fine. I'm going to set up my

622
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,600
two rel to be at the back of the hotel. That's the weak casino bit, all right? Which means when

623
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,400
they cross this corner, we are going to artificially give them more space than we should. But when they

624
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,920
turn that corner, there's no way they're going to be hitting that shit, okay? The only thing

625
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:46,080
that can be hitting is me hitting your mom's sweet ass. Good night. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

626
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,280
Let's spray them down. Okay, there's a soldier above, which I can't do anything about because

627
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:58,320
my fucking tank. Right, okay. Turns out Reflin's no what's up, so I'm going to replace the turret

628
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,560
here. D.Va is halfway across the map. That's okay. We're going to support her and her choices,

629
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,600
even though their spawn is right there, darling. That's right, Reflin. Their spawn is right there.

630
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:16,960
So they spawn back. Yes. Okay, my turret is getting hits from, again, a few licks in far back as well.

631
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,120
Soldier going above for the ultimate. Soldier going above, above for the ult.

632
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,720
I told you, I fucking told you. And she said, no, we're back. No, this is my choice. It's my choice

633
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:35,760
to ult. Okay, we have, we have, we have, we're going to stall. We're going to stall the 60 seconds.

634
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,240
We're going to say hello at the mercy because we're not, we're not mean to mercies. I once too

635
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:45,680
was a mercy. I too was a mercy once. Okay, we're going to replace her turret. That was, sorry,

636
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,760
but that was actually such a good we turret place. An ultimate choice from me. Now, unfortunately,

637
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:58,800
Larry is in the enemy spawn. Reflin felt a bit cocky. That's all right. We do have D.Va bomb.

638
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:07,440
We do have Reinhardt, Shatter combination coming up. We have Junkrat, Tyre as well. Okay, the

639
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:20,480
mercies down. Stop it. Oh my gosh. Browie clutched up. Oh, overtime. Sorry. Wait, hold on. The game

640
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:27,200
was, I was waiting for it to be like, okay, there we go. Fucking app. Bravo. Bravo. We are unstoppable.

641
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,640
The play of the game right there. Brov, sin, get on. Even though I'm not allowed to talk and chat

642
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:42,400
because I'm a new player. Oh my God, let's see how good I did. Come on, show me it then. Come on.

643
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,280
All right, first take down the soldier that was going to ult from high up. Next fucking

644
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,320
ink all over the map. I was going to say the other version of the word, but I had to control myself.

645
01:16:53,440 --> 01:17:00,320
Six minutes on Torbjorn is all I need. Bidum. Wait, hold on. I've got Bidums. Thank you. Thank you.

646
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:06,160
I'll be here all week. Oh, thank you. I know. I know. GG. Oh my gosh. Right, okay.

647
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,680
Oh, we've got Ana. Right, I'll play healer next game. I'll play healer. Get me on Ana.

648
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:17,440
Did he make me boot it up, brov? I actually get on it. Right, okay. We are now going to

649
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,920
pull from page four. Right, remove from group. Sorry, this is taking me forever to like brain

650
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:30,320
right now. Remove from group. Because who's watching? I'm just an average replay with an average

651
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:39,440
live. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then page four. Or is it three? I've taken from three. So page four now.

652
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:46,560
One and menu two and menu three and menu four and menu. Okay. Have I had any of these refunds

653
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,280
before? No, most of them I have not.

654
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,320
You don't look like you're from page four. You think you could sneak on in there? Huh? You

655
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:04,800
think I wouldn't notice? Yeah. You must wet your turn, Mr. You must wet your turn.

656
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:12,880
I saw you. You're sneaky. Right, two moon. Oh no. Someone timed out.

657
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:24,480
Who timed out? Get in here. And then Woody got in. And then who got in? Woomy. As in filling

658
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:33,120
up my... And then are you going to time that? Come on, Vanderland. Can I join please? Yes,

659
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,000
everyone is getting a turn. But there's only four at a time that I can... I can only handle four

660
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,960
refunds at a time. You know, the tentacles start getting a bit too out of control. You know what

661
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:57,680
I'm saying? Gotta keep the tentacles down. I like it. Yes, have you been in? No, you haven't.

662
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:05,200
Wait. Oh, fuck. All right. Okay, fine. No, you need to wait your turn. Bend over. Spank. You need

663
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,880
to wait your turn. I'm trying to give people a chance on the pages because I'm... Please don't

664
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,720
worry. I'm streaming a heck of a lot. Right. Okay, we've got our team. Our team name is gonna be...

665
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:25,600
It's gonna be what? It's gonna be Dart because I unlocked Anna's

666
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:34,640
darts, okay? Your download's halfway there. Halfway there. We get spanked if we join early.

667
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:42,080
Literally bend over. Team Cuntlefish. Is that because I... Oh my god. As in... You mean like as

668
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:54,800
in I'm serving, right? Surely. As in I'm serving. I'm just being so good. Can I join next game?

669
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:01,920
It's random how you get added. You just gotta be patient. And before anyone goes,

670
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:08,640
streamstipe... I literally do a streamstipe game every week. It's vermin tide the other week.

671
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:14,800
Next week is Elden Ring. The week after that, it's Deep Rock Galactica. The week after that,

672
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:21,360
it's the Minds of Moria. Denny, you come greeting me saying, Mummy, does they want to play with me?

673
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,600
Can we play Halo 2 instead? I might be able to do a streamstipe for Halo.

674
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,240
It would be incredibly hard though because there's only so many set missions.

675
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,800
I'm not sure how Halo would work out streamstipe. Unless we played the multiplayer

676
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,680
on Halo 5 or whatever game it is. There is a Halo multiplayer although I've never played it before

677
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:54,080
The missions? Yeah, you can call up missions in Halo. I love your accent. I bet you do.

678
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,160
You're like that Scottish twang to every word I'm saying. You're like, why does she

679
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:03,600
annunciate it like that? You want to know why? Spawnd in this country. Caught Scotland.

680
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,320
It's right above England. Next door at Ireland. Cross the wee bit of water. Northern Ireland as well.

681
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,920
I should do an arcade? No, I'm currently forced to do a quick play

682
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:22,240
roll queue because I haven't unlocked all the modes yet. Why, do you want to do an arcade?

683
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,640
Stormy didn't know that Halo had multiplayer? I mean...

684
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,760
Can you say water? Yeah, that's how I say water.

685
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,320
Wait, does she play with other people in Elden Ring? Yeah, you can invade me in Elden Ring.

686
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,640
We play together in Elden Ring. So what happens is if I suck at a game but then I can summon you

687
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:48,560
in to help me, then we play it together, okay? And that's exactly what we've been doing with Elden

688
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,320
Ring because there was a new DLC that came out but I had to take a break from it because I was a bit

689
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,640
too quick and there wasn't enough free ones to carry me. Well, actually, no, that's a lie. There

690
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:04,480
was enough free ones to carry me. But people... I was getting marshmallows saying like, I can't

691
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,240
carry you because I'm not that far ahead yet and I don't want to like... I still want to enjoy the

692
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,920
Come on, three minutes. I'm humping my screen. God, I've not been funny. I've never had so many friends

693
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:32,240
before. See, in 53, I've never had so many fucking friends before. Yeah, damn. You ever seen a friends

694
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,600
list of friends before? That's kind of... It's kind of nearly naughty. Not gonna lie.

695
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,000
I'm kind of nearly naughty.

696
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:56,080
Oh my gosh. Oh my god, Ray Anatame. I'm sniping from halfway across the map. It's up to you guys

697
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:01,280
what you want to be. Have fun. Have at you. Well, I just got home from falling off the stairs so

698
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:10,480
can't play. What? Do you need to go to hospital? You don't got any head damage, right? You don't

699
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:21,760
got a concussion. You'll be alright, right? No blood and stuff. If you ever sustain an injury,

700
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:27,280
especially if you walloped your head like a big knock to it, don't be shy to show up to the

701
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:33,840
the old accident and emergency. That's rather dangerous. My friends list is full of scammers.

702
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:40,480
Wait, what? How do you... Oh, I didn't know I meant to do that. Hey, do I need to turn down

703
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:51,040
in-game audio or anything? Or... What a booze. Oh my god, it is German Reflings. Hello. Oh my god,

704
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,120
got the tunes. I don't have an emote. Hold on. How do I dance? This is my best I can do to enjoy

705
01:23:55,120 --> 01:24:04,080
your music. I better not be copyright or cry. Oh my god. Oh, we've got sneaky Sombra. We've got a

706
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:17,360
bit of a switch up. Okay, we've got enemy. Oh, dear. We've got... Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.

707
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,920
Hold on a minute. Get me on that floor. Get me on that floor. Get me on that floor, right?

708
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:33,440
Where's the other refling? There's a reefer? Don't fret. Don't fret. I'm not. Okay. Okay. Oh my god,

709
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,640
it's been a while since I've done Anna. Can you tell? Fuck it. I'm just eating that naive.

710
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:42,400
I didn't hit no one. Right, I'm just going to break the rain shield and heal my rain.

711
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:49,040
Oh my god, they're going to fucking come for me. Oh my god. They're doing the toy behind

712
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,560
strat. Right, hold on. I can do this. Hold on. I'm reloading. I'm scared they're going to start

713
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:05,440
looking at me. Oh, not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. I'm healing. I'm healing. I'm healing so hard.

714
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:14,560
Oh no, no, no, no. The enemy fucking bastard. The fucking Baptists took your heal. I could have

715
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:26,640
saved you. I let you down. Wait, how did you respawn so fast? Am I going mental or did you

716
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:35,840
respawn like so fast there? Fuck you, bitch. Who gets the nano? I don't know. Maybe I'll just,

717
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,040
I will go with my instinct. Right, I'm destroying the shield. Fuck you, go sleep.

718
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'm throwing an aid. I'm helping. I'm helping. I'm healing. I'm healing. I'm healing. I promise you

719
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,200
I was healing. I'm so sorry. I promise you I was healing. Okay, we're out here. Right, Lucy was

720
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:03,120
unironically saving my ass, though. Other reflins, I can't get you out there. I promise I was

721
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,520
healing you. Oh my god, the reflins off of Reinhardt. He really said your kills were that shit, bitch.

722
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,160
Oh my god, they're doing the turret, but this is my message.

723
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:20,080
I do have a nano, but I need to break that shield. Maybe that, we need to do the Torbjorn

724
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,920
turret strat, sorry, but if we get up, oh my god, I literally cannot keep up.

725
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:35,200
Right, back up, back up, everyone. I mean, if you want to attack them, I'm done for it.

726
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,720
Right, I'm getting the turret, the turret. There we go. He's doing what I always want to do with

727
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:46,480
the turret. Am I nanoing? I don't know, fuck it. Someone got nanoed. Enjoy it. It's not my problem.

728
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:51,920
It's not my problem. It's your problem. Look, I'm enabling you to do your crazy thing. I'm just

729
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:59,760
doing it from back here. That's all. Oh, she doesn't. I'm healing. I'm healing. I'm at the Fidget

730
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,960
Spinner, don't worry. This is called the Fidget Spinner. Back in my day on Overwatch, this map

731
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,600
is called... I'm somehow able to heal you. I'm throwing a nade. I'm not sure if it's going to

732
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:18,480
hit you, but I'm healing. Oh, the ping. Oh, I just put the equipment to sleep. I repeat,

733
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:26,960
I just put the mechanical equipment to sleep. I deserved it. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, that's so...

734
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,840
Don't even need me. Don't even need me.

735
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:39,600
Gorgeous. Oh, team kill. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. I'm fucking healing. I'm fucking healing.

736
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:49,200
Call me a custard because I'm absolutely creaming, okay? I hear lots of footsteps.

737
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,760
Okay, I'm going to try and break Reinhardt's shield whenever he puts it up.

738
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,720
Fuck you, Arissa. I'm throwing a nade. I'm helping. Oh, that was far too high. You want to lower that

739
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:13,280
a bit, darling? Hold on. Reloading. Reloading. Oh, I'm recharging so hard right now.

740
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,480
Hey, Arissa, stop it. I'm trying to heal from afar for a reason. Don't give me that look.

741
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,240
Don't give me that look.

742
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:39,280
Hold on, I'm healing. I'm healing so hard right now. Oh my god, five player kill streak. Hold on,

743
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:49,520
a hydration trick. We flexing on the mid game. Are they changing? No, they're sticking to their

744
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:57,760
guns. Yeah, they've probably got a few ults coming in. Someone's asleep. Someone's asleep. She

745
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,000
sticks away from attack dogs. Bro, I made that joke as well. I was like, oh, five kill streak.

746
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:10,880
I'm getting a care pack in. Yeah, fuck it. Go. I'm trying to heal. I'm healing so fast.

747
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm half getting burnt, half not. Are we winning? I don't know if we're winning this fight or not.

748
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:28,320
Uh, back up. Back up. Okay, go. It's fine. Just going.

749
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:37,600
Oh my god, that looks so weak. Caracal. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay, we can do this. We can do

750
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,480
this. We can do this, Starland. Come on. You've got it. I believe in you so hard right now,

751
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:48,960
Reflins. I believe in you so hard. We so have this. We are, oh, oh, oh, oh, cheeky, cheeky. We are

752
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:54,480
so javelin right in my heart. Oh my god. No, I actually believe in you so much. You can so do

753
01:29:54,480 --> 01:30:01,120
this. I believe in, I'm coming. I'm coming around. I'm coming around the corner when I come. I'm dead,

754
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:06,720
so you only have one heal, but I promise you, you've got it. Lucio, Lucio red, right through

755
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,200
the wall. Lucio through the wall. Get right. Let me be handle. Oh, let me be handle.

756
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,920
I never have an original thought. It's okay. Neither do I honestly. I might as well just be

757
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,160
right. Deva is de-mecked. Warning. Deva is de-mecked. Okay, I'm throwing an aid. Hopefully it's not too

758
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:32,640
high. No. No, this cannot be. Oh no, no, no. I'm reloading. I think someone's coming for me,

759
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:41,920
but not in the good way. No, no, no, no, baby. No. Oh, it's the ping. I'm blaming the ping. I'm

760
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,880
blaming them. I'm off. I'm off. I'm away at the park. I'm away for a wee ride. I'm away for a

761
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:53,600
ride. I'm taking the time off my ride. Sombra, bro. Sombra, you're in so much trouble. Please be

762
01:30:53,600 --> 01:31:01,120
careful. Be careful. I need the tanks coming. I need to be back. I need to be back. I must,

763
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,040
I must play safe. I'm helping, I'm helping the team so much though. Right, I'm breaking the

764
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,480
rain shield, breaking the ranch shield. I'm breaking the ranch shield.

765
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:25,120
Fuck it. Go in. Someone do something. Oh my god. Sombra, you're, right, someone, all right, fuck it.

766
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:34,640
Okay, and then Tarbjorn. Tarbjorn. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's right. Make him regret being born,

767
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:44,480
baby. All right, who can I hit? I feel a warm, me after the reef. Bro, there's too many. It's too

768
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:54,880
easy. It's too easy. Hey there. Hey, is that your stream sniper cone? Sin and sister. Did

769
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:01,280
you make a fucking side account? No way. Right, Sin's getting in. Oh my god. Streamer has a bias.

770
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:07,200
Damn right. Streamer has a bias. Make him regret being born. Make him regret being born. There's

771
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:12,400
no tanks. There's no tanks. Don't let him, don't, don't give him an inch. Don't give him an inch.

772
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:19,120
Give me five instead. You know what I'm saying? How did that miss the heal and the three enemies

773
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,080
in the jet? Oh, hold on. I can't, I can't heal you. I can't see it. You need to go for that healing

774
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:31,120
pack. I can't see it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Get that, get that Torbjorn. That's right. Stagger him. When

775
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:38,000
you delay a kill on purpose, it's called a stagger. Not to be confused with swagger,

776
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:48,080
jagger. The hit sung by Sherloid, sung by Sherloid. Which one are you? Did uh, oh my god. Sorry,

777
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:56,080
I missed everything. Erchar! Erchar! Get him! Okay, thank you. I'm safe now.

778
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:04,000
I love life. I'm safe. Nothing can hurt me. Hold on. Okay, a few things can hurt. A few things can

779
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:10,080
hurt. Uh, why is this a rip? No, sorry, Kereco. You're getting all it says. You're not going down.

780
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:17,120
I refuse. Kereco's staying up. Is that? No. See this Torbjorn? More like, more like,

781
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:25,920
sorry, I really get it. I love this game. I've not brainwrote it in for long. And now I get to

782
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:35,360
force you to brainwrote on with me. Okay. Okay, let's go. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, 30 seconds.

783
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,960
30 seconds. The comeback is real. The comeback is real. Now you're not allowed in the group.

784
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:47,760
You have to wait to be invited. You have to wait. You must have patience. Patience. Patience. I'm a

785
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:59,360
world of Warcraft Panda. Patience. Okay. Get him. Oh my god. Get the Torbjorn! Torbjorn! Focus on Torbjorn!

786
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,040
Brainheart! Brainheart! I'm getting out of the way of the stun.

787
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:11,920
Bonk. Get out. Get out. Get the Rusa! Get the Rusa! Melee! Fister! Fister horse!

788
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,800
Oh my gosh. Call me Mr. Hansy. I'm fisting that horse.

789
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,960
You ever wonder why your subconscious does those things to you?

790
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,680
Bleh. Bleh. Forbidden Lord.

791
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:34,880
Right. Don't spam Invite me, please. I don't want to do it like that.

792
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,200
Oh my god. Is this one of us? It is! It's a rifling! Hit him with a bomb!

793
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,080
Hit him with a... Right. Your dunsel.

794
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:55,040
Um... Oh no, I didn't mean to do that. Hold on. Continue cause... Thank you. Oh got

795
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:01,600
Hanzo! Right. I'm Hanzo next game. Hold on. Don't spam Invite. That's not how you do it.

796
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:12,080
Thank you so much. Arigatou gozaimasu. And then boom. And then boom. And a bat boom being

797
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:20,400
we need... Did you play? No. You need to let me Invite you, darlings. I need to be fair to

798
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:26,400
everyone. We're Sin. And me. I need to be fair to everyone. Also me. Sin getting this fucking game

799
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,400
right now. Right. Sin... Did I even write your name down? Right. Who? We did T and W.

800
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:40,400
Did we do Ws? I've got a Zed. I'm not done a Zed in the film. Purely on the basis that your name

801
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:45,760
begins with Z. Then we'll go back to the start. D and D. I've not had you.

802
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:56,560
Fox robot? Have I had you? No. No I have not. Wait what? Did someone come in that? I didn't...

803
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,000
Rev, you need a wait or you're gonna get blocked? I'm not being funny. You need a wait or you're

804
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:12,560
gonna get blocked. I'm no... I'm no doing it like that. Okay. Fox robot. D and D roles. We both have

805
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:20,240
new account. So we're going to... Never get to watch how good Sin is in 4K. In literal 4K.

806
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:28,000
And then Sin. And then together we're going to be called Sin's imps. Tee hee imp pits. Ta-da!

807
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:38,720
Team Sin's imps. Right play. Go. Oh! We can do roll queue? Right. I'm hands... 18 fucking minutes!

808
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:51,840
Fuck. No. Bro. 18 minutes if I pick DPS. I thought this game wasn't dead. I thought they just released

809
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:58,960
Juno! Sin is grand master. Yeah grand master at debating. Thank you. I'll be here all week.

810
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:11,200
Okay well. Dead game. Literally 18 minutes. 18 minutes! Grand master shagging your nan.

811
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,680
That was good. That was good. I'll give you that one.

812
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:22,400
Quickly has a hidden MMR. So that's why it would take so long to match you up to someone with the same skill.

813
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,800
Why would it already give an estimate that's the other side of the team which is already full?

814
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:34,720
Really? I require a video right now. Damn. It's two minutes for me. Does it? Well it's actually...

815
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:40,400
Hold on a minute. Hold on. My fellow Americans. It's only saying that because I'm in Australia.

816
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:48,240
But you guys aren't in Australia. I'm playing Hanzo. Get wrecked. I don't know what Sin wants to play.

817
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:55,680
I'll find out in a second. Sin is gonna go tank or healer. Come on. Make your choice,

818
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:05,840
Fox robot. Make your choice. Sin 100% Adiva main. Doesn't she have a Adiva chair?

819
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:13,280
Ah yes, Hanzo. Master of bull job. Whoa! Hold on a minute there. I have to go tank or heal.

820
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:21,040
You two little DPS all walk. Wait. Should I stop D&D role? D&D, your account better not actually

821
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,080
be new. We're about to judge your profile. You locked in D8...

822
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:34,320
You locked in... Are you? What?

823
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:41,840
Why have you done? How do you do it? What? Wait, what does my profile look like then?

824
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,880
Oh my god, I look like an e-girl. Oh my god! I'm so very clearly a freaking e-girl. Look at the

825
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,200
line-up. Get my head, my head. I mean, not to brag about 42 minutes in Unranked.

826
01:38:55,040 --> 01:39:01,360
What in Sim? Level one on a hero. What? I'm gonna unlock Perks on them? Yeah, I don't think so.

827
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,280
Nah, I want you on Hanzo. Oh my god, I said the port.

828
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:09,120
You are Zarya. Maybe they're trying to find a full party to fight you. Do you want Sin and

829
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:13,120
voice chat? Oh, I could just straight up Discord call you. Do you want to be in a Discord call?

830
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:19,920
Do you want to be in a Discord call? Oh, no, not a good time. It may not be a good time. Hold on a minute.

831
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,400
Whoopsies! I have tons of DMs out of my face.

832
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:39,200
Let's see if I make collabs. All right, hold on. Where is she?

833
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:53,520
Where the fuck is- There you are. I'm typing to- I don't know if you're appearing offline on Discord.

834
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,160
Why are you always hiding? Wow, something.

835
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,680
Oh, you made the end face. You made the- Oh.

836
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:14,080
Oh, you made the end face. Okay, okay, let's see if we can hear Sin. And don't fucking-

837
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,960
Don't- Wait, I can't- Hello?

838
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,960
Oh, you're quiet. Wait, hold on. Let me bust you. Test.

839
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,240
I have my shite. I literally sound like I'm playing CSGO with this fucking microphone right now. Holy

840
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:31,200
shit. I sound like I'm playing-

841
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:43,760
This is like a CSGO mic. Oh my god, it's ready. This microphone was fucking 10 quid.

842
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:49,200
Do you have- Do you have skin, bro? Bro, do you have skin? Bro, give me skin.

843
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:53,200
What about the echo on your make-up tone? Geeky and all.

844
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,200
Um, don't act like you don't want more of me.

845
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,200
Bro, of course I'm-

846
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,200
Don't act like you don't hear me twice in your ear, too.

847
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,200
Oh my god.

848
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,200
Wait, sorry. Oh my god.

849
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:17,200
No, no, don't- No, no, no, it's because I'm reading DMs. I've missed out all the DMs from the girls because I never looked at this-

850
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,200
I nearly left a call out of embarrassment.

851
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,200
No, I'm sorry.

852
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,200
I'm sorry.

853
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,200
Wait.

854
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:31,200
Uh, sorry. It's fucking- I didn't look at anyone's DMs because I was so excited to play Overwatch this morning.

855
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Uh, and it's just all the girls are-

856
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,200
Is this Discord kitten?

857
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,200
Yeah, I can fucking hear my echo like mental.

858
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:41,200
Zarian, thank you for the five. Oh my god, is that Sin's sister Discord kitten? Love you.

859
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,200
Are you at Discord? Wait, they call you Discord?

860
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,200
Bro, I'm gonna go Mercy now and I'm gonna just fuck at you the whole time.

861
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Stop!

862
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,200
I'll go like, oh, missed a shot, missed a shot.

863
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Oh, oh, oh my god, but you can play the heal slag game.

864
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,200
Bro, we were- right, not to leak any member's content.

865
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:05,200
Apparently, there's an entire, like, GitHub thing that, like, goes with a above sense wink-wink.

866
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:11,200
And literally, as you heal, you get rewarded and if you resurrect, it goes like 100% on Mercy and shit like that.

867
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,200
I was fucking hee-ho and I was like, bro, we're doing that right now. So, actually-

868
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,200
I'm up right now.

869
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:21,200
Yeah, the truth is me- the truth is me and Sin genuinely have it right now. Hold on.

870
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,200
I wanna hear that.

871
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
Oh my god.

872
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,200
It's literally down my throat.

873
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,200
It's fucking- I'm fucking neon blue. They changed the damage.

874
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,200
I'm deep-throating this bad boy.

875
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,200
Well, well, well, how do you got crumbs in it?

876
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,200
Oh my god, not to-

877
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,200
It's kind of like a cheeky little cheeto when I'm gaming.

878
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:42,200
A cheeto? Not cheese and onion baked walkers, Chris.

879
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,200
Mmm, you know what I mean? I smokey bacon breath, mm-mm.

880
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:51,200
Smoky bacon is actually right. If you've not got the opportunity to try crisps from the fucking UK-

881
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:54,200
Do you know what is- bro, I can't hit in the air. Are you joking?

882
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:57,200
And my ping is 200. I don't know what your ping is.

883
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,200
She missed the shot.

884
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,200
Literally. Every time I miss a shot, I have to spank myself.

885
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,200
Oof, I'm not gonna survive by the end of this.

886
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,200
I wish that- I wish I was that mic.

887
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,200
Oh my god, they won you a deep throat, yeah.

888
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,200
Johnny, you seem like you're frazzled.

889
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,200
You seem like you're frazzled, gal.

890
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,200
Yumi, I assure you it's just frazzled.

891
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:21,200
Banged! Oh my god, she's in the ground!

892
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,200
What the fuck?!

893
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:25,200
What are you?!

894
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:29,200
Bro, is that a refling stream sniping? Why are you all over the house?

895
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,200
Are you dead?

896
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,200
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm getting pr-

897
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:38,200
I'm getting pr- oh my god, I'm coming!

898
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,200
I mean-

899
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,200
Every time you miss a shot, I have to fucking pray!

900
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
I'm- I've been there a breath already!

901
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,200
Oh my god, I'm actually getting kills though, a wee bit.

902
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,200
Like, they're walking into my arrows.

903
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,200
This is actually going really well, sorry.

904
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,200
They keep walking into my- they keep walking into my arrow!

905
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,200
I'm walking on sunshine.

906
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Oh my god, it's after- it's after me again.

907
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,200
It's after me again.

908
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200
What is it?!

909
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,200
What is it?!

910
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,200
Where did it go?!

911
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,200
Carrying me harder!

912
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,200
Carrying me harder!

913
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,200
Carrying me harder!

914
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,200
It keeps coming back!

915
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
She got it! She got it!

916
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
What the fuck is it?!

917
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,200
Right, get out of here. Sorry, I don't know what that round ball is.

918
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
Sorry, I'm saving my res for scrawny.

919
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,200
I- oh.

920
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,200
No, no, res.

921
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,200
Did Eva just try and eat my late dragon?

922
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
Oh, oh, I'm getting whacked.

923
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
No, get off that petal.

924
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
Get off that platform.

925
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,200
I'm- I'm de-platforming you.

926
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,200
You're getting cancelled, literally. I'm de-platforming you.

927
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,200
What is this ultimate?!

928
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,200
Oh my gosh!

929
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,200
Oh my god, I'm like- I'm picking up-

930
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,200
I'm picking up another e-girl.

931
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,200
I'm picking up another e-girl.

932
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,200
I'm picking up another e-girl.

933
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
I'm your e-girl! I'm your kitten, yo!

934
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
Did you ever see-

935
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,200
Mommy, daddy!

936
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,200
Did you ever see those TikToks?

937
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,200
That were like-

938
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,200
bark for mommy if you want to heal

939
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,200
then overwatch.

940
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,200
And then it's a guy going like-

941
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,200
You know what?

942
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,200
Why am I-

943
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,200
No, I need to change up now.

944
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,200
Can you fly to me?

945
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,200
You're not going to get the heals, sweetie.

946
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Until you learn how to hit one shot.

947
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,200
Until you deserve it.

948
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
You have to show me.

949
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,200
This opportunity-

950
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,200
I'm missing all my shots.

951
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
I'm hiding, sorry. I'm hiding.

952
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,200
I don't know who's with me.

953
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,200
We're dead, Astro, I'm so sorry.

954
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,200
We're so dead.

955
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,200
I'm not good enough for this.

956
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Oh my god, we survived.

957
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,200
Wait, I survived, you died.

958
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,200
It was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

959
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,200
It was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

960
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,200
I'm sorry, it had to be this way, but-

961
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
Right, D.Va.

962
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,200
Orph! Orph! Orph! Orph!

963
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,200
Oh my god, I'm meowing.

964
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,200
Meow, meow!

965
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,200
Why did I go ear?

966
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,200
Cats don't go ear, I assure you.

967
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,200
Meow, meow.

968
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,200
Ornian!

969
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,200
Did you know in Japanese frogs say

970
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,200
Kero Kero?

971
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,200
Bro, I'm actually getting-

972
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,200
I'm actually getting fucking kills though.

973
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,200
What's going on?

974
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,200
What's going on?

975
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,200
Right, I'm not getting kills anymore. I got a bit too excited.

976
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,200
Alright, I got another one.

977
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Look at that shot!

978
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,200
Bro, get the freaking

979
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,200
mole wrap.

980
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,200
VTuber.

981
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,200
Confirmed for Gen 4 by the way.

982
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,200
Are we winning?

983
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,200
Is this approaching final destination?

984
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,200
Wasn't that a hit movie?

985
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,200
Someone is stuck in front of that.

986
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,200
Oh, I'm hiding behind a corner.

987
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
Sauce, I'm hiding behind a corner.

988
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,200
Bro, what's going on?

989
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,200
Wait, did they nerf? Did they boost hands?

990
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,200
All my shots are hitting, but I'm not actually-

991
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,200
Oh my god, she's coming for me.

992
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,200
She's raging at me, Sauce, but you're going down hen.

993
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,200
Oh, oh!

994
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,200
Oh!

995
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,200
Hold on, I'm coming!

996
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,200
I'm coming, I'm de-platforming!

997
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,200
Right, close enough, I'll take it.

998
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,200
Right, I'm using dragon!

999
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,200
Imagine dragons!

1000
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,200
RIDI AWAKEN!

1001
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,200
RIDI AWAKEN!

1002
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,200
Oh, oh, oh!

1003
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,200
Oh, oh!

1004
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,200
Fuck you!

1005
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,200
Let me just type in

1006
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,200
fucking-

1007
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,200
That was so fucking good.

1008
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,200
That was so fucking good.

1009
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,200
Oh, I got clean again!

1010
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,200
Let's go!

1011
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,200
Let me endorse some sin.

1012
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,200
I'm literally on blue.

1013
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,200
Oh, look at that aimbot.

1014
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Look at that aimbot.

1015
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,200
Are you ready? One more for good luck!

1016
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
Boom!

1017
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,200
Only took me 10 shots per kill.

1018
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,200
Oh my god!

1019
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,200
Wait, I'm not-

1020
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,200
Stop the count!

1021
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
Right, are you coming for another one?

1022
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,200
Are you satisfied?

1023
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,200
Okay, one more for the roads.

1024
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
I'm sorry, friends, we're taking a spot.

1025
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,200
Okay, come on!

1026
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,200
I'm playing for hours, it's fine.

1027
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,200
I'll try to get me back in then.

1028
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,200
Right.

1029
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,200
Right, where are you?

1030
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,200
Where are you?

1031
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,200
Then, right, one more.

1032
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,200
And then, who have I not looked at?

1033
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,200
I've not looked at Ss, so actually...

1034
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,200
Squishy, are you getting in?

1035
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,200
Have I had a T in? I've not had a T.

1036
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,200
Submissive!

1037
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,200
Right, will we just do a full S gang?

1038
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,200
Hold on.

1039
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,200
I'm looking to see if I've got any more Ss.

1040
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,200
Then you come.

1041
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,200
Sniper?

1042
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,200
I can look at your stream just to see how that makes sounds.

1043
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,200
Oh my god.

1044
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,200
I can hear myself in the background.

1045
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,200
Yeah, that's right.

1046
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,200
We're gonna be called S gang.

1047
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,200
PG.

1048
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,200
Paid actors, are you joking?

1049
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,200
Sorry, but we're actually rolling and smoking.

1050
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,200
I don't care what I'm doing.

1051
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,200
We're doing so good.

1052
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,200
And considering I've not played the game in literal years yet,

1053
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,200
but I'm humping the screen.

1054
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:02,200
I've got an embarrassing confession to make that I still play Overwatch in 2024.

1055
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,200
Wait, casually, how often?

1056
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,200
I still play every night!

1057
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
Oh!

1058
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,200
Do you actually?

1059
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,200
I'll be your heel slut this time, how about that?

1060
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,200
Oh my god!

1061
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,200
I'll be your heel slut.

1062
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,200
I'll be your heel slut. Hold on, let me add these.

1063
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,200
Right, I'm walking in DPS.

1064
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,200
No.

1065
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,200
Everyone's...

1066
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,200
No pressure.

1067
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,200
And then I'll boot root and then I'll be in all fucking pre-recorded.

1068
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,200
We're getting paid to die for her.

1069
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,200
Literally died for me and the enemy team.

1070
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,200
I have like 10 Overwatch accounts.

1071
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
This one's dead. If you check my account, this one's dead.

1072
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,200
Dead.

1073
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,200
I mean, not like to brag, but if you're going competitive,

1074
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,200
I'll be in season 5.

1075
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,200
Look at my support rank.

1076
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,200
I'm not good.

1077
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,200
I'm Overwatch League.

1078
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,200
I'm Lichu Overwatch League.

1079
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,200
Oh my god, that makes sense.

1080
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,200
It's awful in that frame.

1081
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,200
Oh my god.

1082
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,200
Sorry.

1083
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
Oh my god, she's doing work.

1084
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,200
I'm Lichu, I'm fucking...

1085
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,200
I did not realise how many DMs I had

1086
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,200
until I opened it up to get you in a call.

1087
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,200
I was like, ooh, the girls have been waiting on me.

1088
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,200
Tee hee.

1089
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,200
Tee hee.

1090
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,200
Tee hee, not my problem soon.

1091
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,200
T-9 is like what, two weeks?

1092
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,200
Tee hee.

1093
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:24,200
And then I'm getting a manager.

1094
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,200
Uh...

1095
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,200
No, no.

1096
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
Alpha Foxy.

1097
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,200
I only won it.

1098
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,200
Bro, one of the editors

1099
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,200
got back about AC's scripts.

1100
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,200
The fucking scriptmaster.

1101
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,200
I shit you not, the scriptmaster.

1102
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,200
Oh wait, what?

1103
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,200
Oh, AC took it

1104
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,200
out of contact.

1105
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,200
Huh.

1106
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,200
This is why you can't even stream and

1107
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,200
fucking do the same thing.

1108
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,200
Why they all get patched.

1109
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,200
They'll get ding-dong ditched.

1110
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,200
Tee hee.

1111
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,200
This is just way more important,

1112
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,200
you know, like you can wait in the queue

1113
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,200
no longer.

1114
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,200
Right, okay, I'm back.

1115
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,200
Re-mail and stream.

1116
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,200
Mail and stream is the fucking editor.

1117
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,200
That's why there's man in manager hen.

1118
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,200
Got noticed by noon.

1119
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,200
Oh, you can't be saying that.

1120
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,200
That's an inside thought, that'll get you cancelled soon.

1121
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,200
That'll get you cancelled.

1122
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,200
Oh no, what am I gonna do about Natalie?

1123
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,200
No, that would be pure bogging.

1124
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,200
You know how we

1125
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,200
collabed on Dead by Daylight, like a wee bit ago?

1126
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,200
Yes. How long ago was that?

1127
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,200
Hold on, I'm analising.

1128
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,200
Um, well,

1129
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,200
let's just clock me last had Shark Week and then...

1130
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,200
You know why I ask?

1131
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
I'm a fucking ketchup packet right now.

1132
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,200
Oh fuck!

1133
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
Right.

1134
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,200
I was so fucking embarrassed but now that you've said it,

1135
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,200
I'm like, you know what,

1136
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,200
I'm in pain. I'm on painkillers right now.

1137
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
I'm sore.

1138
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,200
You're right, kitten.

1139
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,200
You're right.

1140
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,200
Who are you? You're Ash?

1141
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
You're Ash, okay.

1142
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
Oh my god, they've changed this game so much.

1143
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
Hi, Reefland.

1144
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
Hi, S Gang. See, I'm Stronny.

1145
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
We're all S's.

1146
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,200
Snapeham, Scuttlefish,

1147
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,200
Submissive, Sinning, Sister,

1148
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,200
Squashy, like, come on!

1149
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
Right, where are you?

1150
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:36,200
The Monthly Collab,

1151
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,200
brah.

1152
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,200
Am I allowed to ruin what happened in Blake in 2 weeks' time?

1153
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,200
I may or may not be doing that collab with

1154
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,200
them and two other YouTubers.

1155
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,200
There's something going on in the water.

1156
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,200
You just comfort me so much, okay?

1157
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,200
You just... I've never played this

1158
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,200
freaking map. I am literally

1159
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,200
heal-bought so hard. I'm just going to fly.

1160
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,200
Okay.

1161
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,200
Oh my god!

1162
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,200
Oh!

1163
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,200
Oh!

1164
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
Hold on, any heal, Reefland? Keep her up.

1165
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,200
Where are you?

1166
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,200
Wrong one.

1167
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,200
Okay.

1168
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,200
Oh!

1169
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,200
Who are you?

1170
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,200
Who are you?

1171
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,200
Sorry, right.

1172
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,200
I'm making Scottish references

1173
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,200
that are hilarious.

1174
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
So there's, like,

1175
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,200
random... I don't know.

1176
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
It's, like, chance. It must be food.

1177
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,200
Whoa! There's a freaking trampoline!

1178
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,200
Oh my god, Sos.

1179
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,200
I'm actually... excuse me.

1180
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,200
Oh yeah, trampoline!

1181
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
Trampoline!

1182
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Enemy over there.

1183
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,200
Why is that not pinging?

1184
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,200
There's a Pharah over there.

1185
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
Oh my god, speaking of pockets...

1186
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,200
Look at all Pharah, bitch.

1187
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,200
Sorry. Literally, there's two hit scans.

1188
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,200
There's two hit scans and they're sitting on Pharah.

1189
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,200
Trampoline!

1190
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,200
Trampoline! Please don't get headshot.

1191
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,200
I'll cry. Oh no, I have res. It's fine. Get headshot. Go crazy.

1192
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,200
Just give up.

1193
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,200
Give up.

1194
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:08,200
Oh! Oh!

1195
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,200
I'm not getting caught out, though.

1196
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,200
I'm not getting caught out.

1197
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,200
Oh, Echo! Echo's going to make a difference!

1198
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,200
Wait, they went...

1199
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,200
Bro.

1200
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,200
The Echo's in this distance.

1201
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,200
Chat off, Mamek.

1202
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,200
Oh my god.

1203
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,200
You're so fucking way!

1204
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,200
Fuck's sake, I wish I had your brain, honestly.

1205
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,200
I'm just all in, Sos. I'm all in.

1206
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,200
Yeah.

1207
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,200
Oh.

1208
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,200
Oh, I got an achievement. I got an achievement.

1209
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,200
Well...

1210
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
Oh, I'm resin. I'm resin in front of the hands though.

1211
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,200
What a cheeky sod I am.

1212
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,200
No, I said I'm going for the hands off, right. Got it.

1213
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,200
Got me, sticker.

1214
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
Thank you, the Bailor.

1215
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,200
Oh, you tingling over.

1216
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,200
Oh my god, please.

1217
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,200
Go ahead.

1218
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,200
Bro.

1219
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,200
Oh! Moira! Moira, I'm coming.

1220
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,200
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1221
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,200
In one. In one.

1222
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
I'm doing it. I'm doing it in a bit.

1223
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,200
I just found my one.

1224
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,200
It's fucking easy.

1225
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,200
Bro.

1226
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
Sos, but there's nothing...

1227
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,200
They can't even do nothing about this heel slag, okay?

1228
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
They get nervous.

1229
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,200
They start quaking in the lobby when they say mercy on

1230
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
Scuttlefish, okay?

1231
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
They say mercy. They say default pose.

1232
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
Hit them with the default level 3.

1233
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
Yeah. Look at those heels.

1234
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
2.8

1235
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,200
K heels.

1236
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,200
Took me a second there.

1237
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,200
That was 2.7.

1238
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,200
I'm still the better mercy though.

1239
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,200
I'm still better, okay?

1240
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,200
It's not a pinky thing, but it both happened and died, you know?

1241
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,200
Have I actually not?

1242
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,200
Bro, I kept you up so much that we didn't die.

1243
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
That's that new character.

1244
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,200
I'm creeping around.

1245
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
I can smell you.

1246
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
I'm creeping around.

1247
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,200
That's right.

1248
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
Bark for heels.

1249
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,200
You're just slugging.

1250
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,200
You're just turning into a fucking Chihuahua.

1251
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,200
Where are you?

1252
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,200
Where are you?

1253
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
Where are you?

1254
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,200
Oh, right. I found you. Sorry.

1255
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,200
I'm staring at you.

1256
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,200
I had no idea what was going on.

1257
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,200
I was just having a good time.

1258
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
Amora will come to me for healing

1259
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,200
and we'll be normal in the enemy team.

1260
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,200
Thank you.

1261
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,200
That venture does not gear rats ours.

1262
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,200
She said not my problem.

1263
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,200
Hold on.

1264
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,200
No way.

1265
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,200
Oh no!

1266
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,200
It's all coming down.

1267
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,200
I need to heal.

1268
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,200
I need to heal as much as I love being a healer.

1269
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
Oh my God.

1270
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,200
Teleporter.

1271
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,200
Symmetra teleporter.

1272
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,200
Symmetra teleporter.

1273
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,200
True.

1274
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,200
I'm Jennifer Coolidge.

1275
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,200
I'm getting pissed on by Moira.

1276
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,200
I'm going to get in peace.

1277
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,200
I'm going to damage again.

1278
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,200
Adventure damage time.

1279
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,200
But not to be confused with the hit TV show Adventure Time.

1280
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,200
Because I booted up my PC

1281
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,200
to play Overwatch

1282
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,200
when my reef lands.

1283
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,200
Adventure Time.

1284
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,200
Sorry, that's the best I got.

1285
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,200
Where is my little Ash?

1286
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,200
I'm having him.

1287
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,200
I don't trust that.

1288
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,200
I feel like someone's about to ult.

1289
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,200
I'm preemptively ulting in exchange of someone ulting.

1290
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,200
Oh my God.

1291
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,200
Okay.

1292
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,200
That was cheeky.

1293
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,200
Oh my God!

1294
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,200
Literally team kill.

1295
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,200
I feel like we're trolling so much

1296
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,200
and it's going really well.

1297
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,200
Oh my God.

1298
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
You can't sit.

1299
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,200
That's so toxic.

1300
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,200
Since sister cancelled.

1301
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,200
I'm literally so tired.

1302
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,200
It's so easy.

1303
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,200
Easy clap.

1304
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,200
Oh my God! They're coming behind!

1305
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,200
I can't.

1306
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,200
I can't.

1307
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,200
I'm fucking somewhere!

1308
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,200
Right, I've got the hands though.

1309
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,200
I've got the turrets.

1310
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,200
Okay.

1311
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,200
They were no match.

1312
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,200
I got an achievement for that as well.

1313
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,200
They were genuinely

1314
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,200
no match.

1315
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,200
Wait, what did we do to them?

1316
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,200
Oh my God.

1317
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,200
I feel so bad.

1318
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:50,200
I want to type like,

1319
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,200
have good luck in your next games or whatever

1320
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,200
but I'm not even got comms yet.

1321
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,200
Wait, like me! She's British!

1322
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,200
Let's go.

1323
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,200
Excuse me?

1324
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,200
Oh!

1325
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,200
Oh yeah!

1326
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,200
We got the sticker.

1327
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,200
We got the sticker as well.

1328
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,200
Oh my God, 5 minutes on mercy bro.

1329
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:12,200
I'm actually sorry. I'm so good at this game.

1330
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,200
Oh my God, I'm level 3.

1331
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,200
Reward is a premium.

1332
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Yeah, I'm not paying for a fucking reward. Jesus.

1333
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,200
Oh God! Junkrat!

1334
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,200
Right, I'm doing DPS now.

1335
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,200
Okay, thank you so so much.

1336
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,200
Oh my God, she's leaving.

1337
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,200
Right, I'm going to leave her boys.

1338
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,200
I'm leaving.

1339
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,200
Oh, that was it.

1340
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,200
She's already left the call.

1341
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,200
That was it.

1342
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,200
That was the...

1343
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,200
I mean, that was fucking fun. I enjoyed it.

1344
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,200
Me and Senna are a fucking broke.

1345
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Maybe we should start fucking being...

1346
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,200
Yeah, damn, buddy.

1347
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,200
Overwatch professionals.

1348
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,200
Why were we getting so lucky?

1349
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,200
We ate the mic for a goodbye.

1350
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,200
Right, who...

1351
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200
Who the fuck has not been in?

1352
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,200
I maybe should have done this alphabet.

1353
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
But then I wouldn't be able to name your teams very well.

1354
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,200
I feel like

1355
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
there's a lot of years that I've been waiting

1356
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,200
and I'm so worried that I'm going to time out

1357
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,200
because

1358
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,200
you guys don't have time to like

1359
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,200
wait to play.

1360
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,200
Because it's not a weekend, is it? It's a weekday.

1361
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,200
I wanted to give...

1362
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
Oh, it's technically the weekend for me.

1363
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,200
And smoked.

1364
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,200
I wish there was...

1365
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Bastion logo, really?

1366
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
It's Friday.

1367
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,200
Wait, has everyone finished work in the world yet?

1368
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,200
I don't need to be...

1369
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,200
I don't need to be pan, okay?

1370
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,200
Right, Chuggy.

1371
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,200
Right, one from page one.

1372
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
One from page two.

1373
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,200
Caraca.

1374
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,200
You respect it and that's why I'm getting confused with you.

1375
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
One from this page.

1376
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,200
Piano man, you've

1377
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,200
definitely not written your name down.

1378
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
And then...

1379
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,200
Do you want to try again, Van der Leyen?

1380
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,200
Because we couldn't get you in.

1381
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
Right, who...

1382
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
Alright, okay.

1383
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,200
We've got Van der Leyen.

1384
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,200
I think maybe that's how I should do it.

1385
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,200
I should just do one from each page.

1386
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,200
And then that's the best way I can do it.

1387
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,200
I don't know what country that is, but...

1388
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,200
Oh!

1389
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,200
No, you can't come in. I don't know why.

1390
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,200
That was Funko long three, I was sub.

1391
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:16,200
Yeah?

1392
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,200
Neko voodoo.

1393
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,200
Thank you for the

1394
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,200
super chat. Did you enjoy it?

1395
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
Did you enjoy it?

1396
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,200
It popped off.

1397
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Capital...

1398
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
Right, okay. Who is...

1399
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,200
the K page? Right, you could get...

1400
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,200
Kalker, you've not had a shot.

1401
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,200
And who...

1402
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,200
Reserved someone on page four?

1403
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,200
No, Van der Leyen was page four.

1404
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,200
Who's page three?

1405
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,200
Piano man, so page one, who didn't come in?

1406
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,200
Who didn't come in?

1407
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,200
Did I pick someone from page one?

1408
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,200
A14N.

1409
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,200
I don't think I recognize you, darling.

1410
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,200
Okay.

1411
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,200
A14N.

1412
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,200
And together, we make the screamers.

1413
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,200
Screamers, and then in brackets, while we ink.

1414
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:10,200
I'm sorry for being so loud this stream.

1415
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,200
I'm just really happy.

1416
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,200
I apologize.

1417
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,200
If it...

1418
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,200
I apologize if this type of stream ain't your thing.

1419
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,200
I'm just really happy.

1420
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,200
Right, I'm playing Junkrat.

1421
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:24,200
So...

1422
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,200
You guys can bicker between yourselves.

1423
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,200
What rules do you want to play, but I'm playing Junkrat.

1424
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:30,200
You having fun and being loud is the best.

1425
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,200
I'm almost tempted to hop on in the soft.

1426
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:36,200
Oh my, thank you for the 10 gifted memberships.

1427
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,200
Thank you.

1428
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,200
Congrats to those who caught it with their face.

1429
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,200
Wait a minute, hold on a minute.

1430
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
I just had a vision.

1431
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,200
I can't.

1432
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,200
I'm pretty sure I was like one membership off of getting...

1433
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,200
Wait, is it gonna...

1434
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,200
Oh, it's probably not gonna register right away.

1435
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
I'm pretty sure I was like one gifted

1436
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,200
membership off in your moat.

1437
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,200
Wait.

1438
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:06,200
No.

1439
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200
What?

1440
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,200
Oh, so it's unlocked the next one,

1441
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,200
but it's not letting me add it.

1442
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:16,200
Hey, up Mars, up Mars.

1443
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,200
Okay, we're doing it.

1444
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,200
You're and Mummy so happy.

1445
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:24,200
Devices have...

1446
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,200
Yeah, literally, you need to turn down the volume in this room.

1447
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:28,200
Cause once I start popping off, it's bloody ogre.

1448
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,200
It's bloody ogre.

1449
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,200
Your energy is incredible.

1450
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,200
It's just brain raw.

1451
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,200
It's just overwatch brain raw.

1452
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,200
I'm glad that you enjoyed them.

1453
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,200
Too many moats in two and a half.

1454
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:52,200
As I said, I'm happy to keep fucking going.

1455
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:54,200
I am really...

1456
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,200
I'm a happy being right now.

1457
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:58,200
I don't think...

1458
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,200
I plan on stopping anytime soon.

1459
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,200
Um...

1460
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,200
I'm just...

1461
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,200
fucking checking the comments.

1462
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,200
Of course the Scott uses a potato

1463
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,200
as an example of a hardy vegetable.

1464
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,200
Um...

1465
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,200
Actually...

1466
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,200
Ireland.

1467
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,200
Um...

1468
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,200
Makes for a solid background noise.

1469
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,200
I am screaming my head off,

1470
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:24,200
but I'm glad I can help you focus on something.

1471
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,200
Uh...

1472
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,200
Wow, thanks so much.

1473
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,200
You'd think the company would pay for that kind of thing,

1474
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,200
but they say the members pay walls

1475
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,200
to filter people like me.

1476
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:36,200
Hullary.

1477
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,200
People are gonna fucking believe the shit you start spouting.

1478
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,200
Got to play so I can

1479
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,200
go to the vet appointment.

1480
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:48,200
Happy?

1481
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,200
Getting hydration checked.

1482
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:52,200
Yeah, I'm chugging that cola.

1483
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:54,200
I'm on rat do junk because I just unlocked them.

1484
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,200
I'm Aussie.

1485
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:58,200
Plenty of bombs to go around.

1486
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,200
Plenty of bombs to go around.

1487
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,200
Would you still love me if I

1488
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,200
sounded like this?

1489
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,200
Fucking hell, can't get A's.

1490
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,200
Fly, my good friend.

1491
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,200
Fly, my good friend.

1492
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,200
Thank you, crazy jet.

1493
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:14,200
Thank you, crazy Jesse

1494
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,200
for the super jets.

1495
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,200
No, you were not like...

1496
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,200
Ha!

1497
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:24,200
Hobby door.

1498
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:28,200
Oh my god.

1499
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,200
Oh, hitting with it.

1500
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,200
Oh, that was vivid.

1501
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:34,200
VV fucking VTuber.

1502
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,200
VV collaboration with Diablo.

1503
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,200
VV, VTuber.

1504
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:40,200
You know what I mean.

1505
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,200
You guys saw the outfit.

1506
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,200
You did. You know exactly what I mean.

1507
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,200
We're spamming.

1508
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,200
Right, if anyone decides to go in there,

1509
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,200
they're getting caught.

1510
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,200
Aussie is my favourite English accent.

1511
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:54,200
Oh!

1512
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:56,200
Someone's on the point, not to...

1513
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,200
Right, I'll deal with it.

1514
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,200
Fuck!

1515
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,200
Fuck, this is what I fucking hate about

1516
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,200
tracers, they're so weed.

1517
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,200
I still tickle their balls more than like...

1518
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,200
I'm just trying to get her with my mines.

1519
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Oh!

1520
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,200
Oh, that's true. Oh!

1521
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:18,200
Oh my god, the hansels are fighting back.

1522
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:20,200
The hansels are fighting back.

1523
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:22,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I fucked up that one.

1524
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,200
That was on me.

1525
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,200
Mummy dabong!

1526
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,200
Vividly ASMR. Yes!

1527
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,200
She did a collaboration with El Diablo

1528
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:32,200
and it looks like that Moira skin,

1529
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:34,200
but I'm sure it's based after like an actual character in the series.

1530
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:36,200
Right, oh my god, look at the damage I'm doing.

1531
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:38,200
Oh!

1532
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:40,200
Oh, that's right. That's right. You need to suck up my bombs.

1533
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:42,200
Oh, I got one hit.

1534
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,200
That's the best I got.

1535
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,200
Okay, hansel's going to try and snipe me again.

1536
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,200
Honestly, fair, valid.

1537
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,200
I'm spamming. I'm spamming.

1538
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,200
I got a kill. I got a kill.

1539
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,200
Don't mind me, darlings.

1540
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,200
Don't mind me.

1541
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,200
That's right. I'm going to pop that right there.

1542
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,200
Shh! Don't sell anyone.

1543
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:04,200
Their tracer shacks are cousin on the weekend.

1544
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,200
Oh, you're getting a bit...

1545
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,200
Getting a bit of regen.

1546
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,200
That's all right. You don't like to be regen.

1547
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,200
Oh, diva bomb? Question mark. Diva bomb soon.

1548
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,200
Oh, I'm dead.

1549
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,200
Oh, I'm alive.

1550
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,200
I'm dead. Oh, I'm alive again.

1551
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:20,200
I'm watching TV.

1552
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,200
We're doing it. We're doing it.

1553
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,200
We're doing it. We're doing it.

1554
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:26,200
We're doing it.

1555
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,200
I can hear footsteps.

1556
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,200
I can hear footsteps.

1557
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,200
I knew it. I knew it.

1558
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:34,200
I knew it, you slag.

1559
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,200
That's right. You better recall.

1560
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:38,200
Diva bomb! Diva bomb!

1561
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,200
I knew it. I knew it.

1562
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,200
You better recall. Diva bomb! Diva bomb!

1563
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,200
Possibly! Possibly!

1564
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:46,200
He's coming up the stairs.

1565
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,200
Okay. Okay.

1566
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,200
Uh-huh. Tell him how you really feel.

1567
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,200
Tell him how you really feel! Right. I'm dead. It's fine.

1568
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,200
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

1569
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,200
I did really bad. That was really poor movement.

1570
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:00,200
If I was...

1571
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:02,200
You red! How?

1572
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:04,200
If...

1573
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,200
If I do, like, peeky stuff like that...

1574
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,200
Right, I'm out of here.

1575
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:10,200
Up! Up! Get me in the air so Mercy can get up in the air as well.

1576
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:12,200
Up! Up! Get me in the air so Mercy can get up in the air as well.

1577
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,200
If I do peeky stuff like that,

1578
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,200
I... Trigger!

1579
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,200
Trigger!

1580
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,200
Oh my god. I'm so sorry.

1581
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,200
I'm so sorry. I'm... I promise I'm...

1582
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,200
I'm helping. I'm getting out of here.

1583
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,200
I'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of here.

1584
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,200
I'm spamming. I'm spamming.

1585
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,200
If you can't tell,

1586
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,200
Junkrat really isn't my main source, but I didn't play him.

1587
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,200
I don't know... Another of these particularly bad

1588
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:36,200
or anything of that nature

1589
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,200
didn't really go for it.

1590
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,200
I just kind of... I just kind of suck, you know?

1591
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:42,200
I just kind of suck, you know?

1592
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,200
Sometimes you swallow on a hero

1593
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:46,200
and sometimes you suck on a hero.

1594
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,200
I'm afraid I ain't eating this time.

1595
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,200
I'm afraid I ain't eating this time.

1596
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,200
Oh, Mercy! Careful!

1597
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,200
Jumping off the map!

1598
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,200
She's not down there, is she? No.

1599
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:58,200
Right, okay. Right, we can now go in there, spawn and fuck him up.

1600
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,200
Oh, come on. I got one hit.

1601
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,200
I'm doing terrible with the aim.

1602
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,200
What is my... 90%

1603
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,200
25 I throw, I get one hit.

1604
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,200
Present for ya!

1605
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,200
And no one's doing a back cap.

1606
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:16,200
Although...

1607
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,200
Oh, shit!

1608
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,200
Look, I got the kill.

1609
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,200
I got the kill.

1610
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,200
That's the main thing.

1611
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,200
That's the thing.

1612
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,200
Get in there, Moira. Get in there.

1613
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,200
Oh my god, I have my ultimate. Holy shit, we're down. Holy shit, we might lose this.

1614
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,200
Holy... Holy cycle.

1615
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,200
Better to pee in the sink than sink in the pee.

1616
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,200
Unless... I heard that.

1617
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,200
You need to get a rest, Eva.

1618
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:46,200
Get a rest!

1619
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,200
Get a fucking rest, Arlen.

1620
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,200
Get a rest! Get a rest. No, you're actually upsetting me.

1621
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,200
Fuck you, bitch.

1622
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,200
No, get a rest. Oh!

1623
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,200
I bet you were going to be on this side of the map now!

1624
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:58,200
Get off my payloads!

1625
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,200
Get off my payloads!

1626
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:02,200
Stop being so obvious!

1627
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,200
Get off my payload, you wimp.

1628
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,200
You wimp, fart!

1629
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:08,200
Get off my payload!

1630
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,200
I am the tank. I am the tank.

1631
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:12,200
The only tank.

1632
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:14,200
Right, I am very worried about a back cap.

1633
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,200
So we're going to put a trap right there.

1634
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,200
That was a little too close to the wall.

1635
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:24,200
Fucking predicted!

1636
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,200
Actual predicted, sauce.

1637
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,200
But you want to try again, Tracer?

1638
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,200
Look, I'll put it here this time.

1639
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:32,200
So you can see it this time.

1640
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,200
Yeah, you want to try and do a back cap?

1641
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,200
Again, nice try.

1642
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:38,200
Nice try. Right, I'm going to spam over the castle

1643
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:40,200
and pray I get a hit or a kill.

1644
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:42,200
Maybe, I don't know.

1645
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,200
Rough.

1646
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:46,200
I don't have any voice lanes to spam yet.

1647
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,200
What is it? See?

1648
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,200
Tick tock.

1649
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,200
Me after stream from my brain rot.

1650
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:54,200
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

1651
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,200
Come at me!

1652
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,200
Oh!

1653
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,200
Oh, behind again!

1654
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:02,200
No, no, no. I saw you, you wee slag.

1655
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:04,200
No, no, no, no, no. Come here.

1656
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:06,200
Come here, you wee slag.

1657
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:08,200
If you want a piece of this.

1658
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:10,200
If you want a piece of this.

1659
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,200
Oh, she's in the trap.

1660
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,200
No, she made it out of the trap.

1661
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,200
I can't believe it.

1662
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,200
Sometimes...

1663
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:20,200
No, we're not doing this.

1664
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:22,200
I don't care if I have 200 ping.

1665
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,200
You're getting abs.

1666
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:26,200
You're getting wrecked! I don't care!

1667
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,200
Get trap mined.

1668
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:30,200
Get bombed in the air.

1669
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,200
Don't care.

1670
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,200
I'm Junkrat.

1671
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,200
I'm having a good time.

1672
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:38,200
MLG pro.

1673
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:40,200
Hit him with a 360 and the stamp.

1674
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:42,200
That's right.

1675
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:44,200
That's right. That's my Luke sensitivity.

1676
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,200
Hit him with that.

1677
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:48,200
Okay.

1678
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,200
The payload just destroyed my...

1679
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,200
thingy mobile bar.

1680
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,200
That's my rude.

1681
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,200
I'm just doing that preemptively in case

1682
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,200
an enemy comes around the corner.

1683
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,200
Because I ain't tolerating that.

1684
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:02,200
Okay, I may get headshot by...

1685
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:04,200
Head behind! Behind!

1686
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,200
They're coming up the stairs!

1687
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,200
Yeah, you're not the only one...

1688
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,200
Right. Sorry, I really don't like...

1689
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,200
Chase them!

1690
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,200
Because they can redo their health thingy, which I hate.

1691
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:20,200
Oh, you want it again?

1692
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:22,200
You want this again, journal?

1693
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:24,200
Ah, fuck you up.

1694
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:26,200
You may come from Mars, but you ain't got a clue

1695
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:28,200
how gravity works on air.

1696
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:30,200
Motherfucker!

1697
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,200
Soz.

1698
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:34,200
But you ain't touching me.

1699
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,200
You are not touching me.

1700
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,200
I still think we can win.

1701
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,200
No, no. I know we can win, Junkrat.

1702
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,200
Hold it together.

1703
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,200
Hold it together.

1704
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,200
Hear me, baby. Hold it together.

1705
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:50,200
Oh my god, all the Overwatch brainroads coming back.

1706
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:52,200
All the voice lines.

1707
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:54,200
That was a Torbjorn voice line.

1708
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,200
Shh.

1709
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:58,200
Behind you!

1710
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:00,200
Right, stop down to that tracer.

1711
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,200
I'm gonna cry.

1712
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,200
Stop down to the tracer. I'm greeting.

1713
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:06,200
Just in case.

1714
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,200
We gotta give her a few on the stairs.

1715
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:10,200
Right, I'm gonna... Unfortunately, I've got 30.

1716
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,200
I'm gonna need a few cheeky hits.

1717
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,200
I have to admit, I'm gonna need a few cheeky hits.

1718
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,200
Oh, oh, we got a cheeky on Mars.

1719
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,200
We've got a cheeky on Mars.

1720
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:20,200
I can't believe the healers are down.

1721
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:22,200
That's all we need.

1722
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,200
Mars is gonna try and go for the rest, but we're gonna get her sweat.

1723
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:26,200
Oh fuck.

1724
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,200
I was gonna say, but we're gonna...

1725
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,200
Oh no, our mercy goes down.

1726
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,200
Due to my foolishness, just like that,

1727
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:34,200
I take my own team down.

1728
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:36,200
I take my own team down.

1729
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:38,200
Due to my overcockiness, my foolishness,

1730
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,200
my ambitions, I must lay them to rest

1731
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,200
like Morgan Elden Ring.

1732
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:44,200
I must lay my foolish ambitions to rest.

1733
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,200
I'm in trouble! Piss! Piss!

1734
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,200
Piss! I do have ultimate, but I can't touch.

1735
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,200
I can't touch. You're gonna have to stall on point.

1736
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:54,200
You're gonna have to touch the pill!

1737
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:58,200
Right, okay, we still have a full section.

1738
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,200
Don't worry. Let's regroup.

1739
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:02,200
Don't panic, get it. Get it. Why are you panicking?

1740
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,200
Reflins.

1741
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:06,200
Reflins, don't panic.

1742
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,200
We can still win this.

1743
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:10,200
They have two minutes to push the full payload.

1744
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:12,200
We just need to group up and be a hashtag team.

1745
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,200
And now, if I get wig snaked by Hansel,

1746
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:16,200
because I went around this corner,

1747
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,200
that's on me, okay, darlings?

1748
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:20,200
But it's not over.

1749
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:22,200
It's not over until the tank comes in.

1750
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:24,200
I'm about to ult their fucking assholes so hard.

1751
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,200
Okay, well, speaking of ults...

1752
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:34,200
Okay, that's all we needed.

1753
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:36,200
That's all we needed. We're using a lot of ults,

1754
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,200
but that's okay. We're allowed to be overze...

1755
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,200
We're allowed to...

1756
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,200
We're allowed to...

1757
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,200
We're allowed to...

1758
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,200
Yes!

1759
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,200
Okay, and now this is the best bit about Junkrat.

1760
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:50,200
You can literally spam from here.

1761
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,200
You can spam from here.

1762
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,200
Oh, you can spam.

1763
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,200
And then you'll get a few cheeky hits.

1764
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:58,200
See, look, 14% ult charge.

1765
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,200
Thank you, crazy Jessie,

1766
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:02,200
for the super charge. Everyone panic.

1767
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,200
They better panic, because I'm on the enemy team.

1768
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:06,200
You know what I'm saying?

1769
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:08,200
Oh, do you want to come through this whole tracer?

1770
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,200
No, get right. Get out of here.

1771
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,200
I don't want to see you.

1772
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,200
I don't want to see you in your tight, gorgeous little pants.

1773
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,200
I don't want to see that.

1774
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,200
No, no, tracer. Leave my mercy alone.

1775
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,200
I don't want to see that, darling.

1776
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:22,200
We have been here before.

1777
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,200
Oh, my God, that mercy is floating in the air.

1778
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:26,200
I'm missing everything.

1779
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:28,200
200 p...

1780
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,200
Am I there? No!

1781
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,200
I did not really need to die.

1782
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:34,200
I believe in you.

1783
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:36,200
I believe in you.

1784
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:38,200
Okay, we do have a race.

1785
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:40,200
Mercy's down!

1786
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,200
Okay, oh no.

1787
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:44,200
Okay, we need a regroup.

1788
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:46,200
Stop fucking wasting.

1789
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,200
I need to put my heart rate monitor on,

1790
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:50,200
just to prove to you that I'm not doing this on purpose.

1791
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,200
This is actually my heartbeat,

1792
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,200
and how excited I am right now.

1793
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,200
I need to be careful. I don't want to peek too much.

1794
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,200
Okay, we've got EMP down.

1795
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:00,200
No, yes! Mercy down. One healer down.

1796
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:02,200
The second DPS.

1797
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,200
He can't approach. It's too much.

1798
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,200
It's too much. I didn't win again.

1799
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,200
The ink!

1800
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,200
Victory once again.

1801
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:12,200
Cannot handle a cheeky endorsement here and there.

1802
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,200
Don't mind if we do.

1803
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,200
They can't handle us.

1804
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,200
We twiddler mustaches.

1805
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:20,200
That's not one of us.

1806
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,200
No, it's not. Get out of here.

1807
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,200
You're not one of us!

1808
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,200
Go away. I don't want to see your play of the game.

1809
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:28,200
I don't know you. You're not a wiefling.

1810
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:30,200
Unless you're a wiefling that's stream sniping somehow,

1811
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:32,200
then that's different.

1812
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,200
Don't make your heart explode, honestly.

1813
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,200
It's me!

1814
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:38,200
And Junkrat.

1815
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:40,200
I didn't unlock a new character, so I guess...

1816
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,200
It's tank time!

1817
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,200
GG!

1818
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,200
Thank you for the GG.

1819
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:48,200
Right, okay.

1820
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,200
At the fortnight.

1821
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,200
Metal pass.

1822
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:54,200
I can't show you where my house is.

1823
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,200
And I believe I might be sure.

1824
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:58,200
Cause I need you there.

1825
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,200
Cause I'd like to watch you mate.

1826
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:02,200
Metal pass.

1827
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:04,200
Metal pass.

1828
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,200
Okay.

1829
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,200
Right, one person per page.

1830
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:14,200
Is Captain Crusher been in?

1831
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,200
Captain, have you been in here before?

1832
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,200
I don't see no Captain Crusher.

1833
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,200
God, we have five pages.

1834
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,200
Hand kill.

1835
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,200
Hearthstone.

1836
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,200
You got taken off the roster, didn't you?

1837
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:28,200
You did.

1838
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:30,200
And you come.

1839
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:32,200
Uh...

1840
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:34,200
Next page.

1841
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,200
A paying...

1842
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:38,200
Hello?

1843
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,200
Have I had pain killer?

1844
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:42,200
I don't think so.

1845
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,200
I don't think I've had you.

1846
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:46,200
Okay, you guys are just sitting on buzzers.

1847
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:48,200
So that's actually unironically helpful.

1848
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,200
Uh, bettable.

1849
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,200
I don't think I've had you either, Darwin.

1850
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:54,200
I'm checking my list.

1851
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:58,200
I'm trying to see which reef win has been laid.

1852
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:00,200
But I don't think anyone...

1853
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,200
If...

1854
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:05,200
I would like to respectfully ask all reeflings.

1855
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,200
If I invite you when you've already had a chance.

1856
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:13,200
Please don't accept or please leave respectfully.

1857
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,200
Just because...

1858
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,200
If you're having fun playing with me.

1859
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:21,200
I want to extend that fun to all reeflings.

1860
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,200
And I want to make sure everyone gets a chance.

1861
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,200
So we're going to call this team fun and fair.

1862
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,200
Because we're the fun and fair team.

1863
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:32,200
Aw, yes.

1864
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:34,200
I'm checking my list.

1865
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:37,200
Right, I unlocked Roadhog so it's my turn for tank.

1866
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:41,200
And I get 100 exp to the battle pet.

1867
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,200
They have a battle.

1868
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,200
Is that a premium?

1869
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,200
Right, so they're free for everyone.

1870
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,200
Then there's rewards, challenges,

1871
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,200
and then upgrade to premium with a winky...

1872
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,200
They really said, you know you want to...

1873
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,200
You want to give us more money.

1874
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,200
Even though I paid the base fee of Overwatch.

1875
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:59,200
That's right, give them.

1876
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,200
I'm all mine. Hi, reeflings.

1877
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,200
Kolker, thank you for the 10 gifted memberships.

1878
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:07,200
Congrats to those who caught them with your...

1879
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,200
Face.

1880
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,200
Thank you, Kolker.

1881
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:13,200
And my for the 10 gifted.

1882
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,200
Very kind, very kind. Please enjoy the emotes.

1883
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,200
Activates my super dodge.

1884
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,200
Right, continue.

1885
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,200
Show tutorial?

1886
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,200
Sure, show me the tutorial on how to look at the battle pass.

1887
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,200
Knock and go.

1888
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,200
Welcome to the Overwatch Battle Pass.

1889
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:31,200
The Overwatch Battle Pass rewards you for playing...

1890
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:33,200
Play games to get more.

1891
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,200
Okay, thank you for your tutorial.

1892
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,200
Don't care.

1893
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:38,200
Can I please leave?

1894
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:40,200
Oh my god, sorry, that cut the queue.

1895
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:43,200
Sorry, I didn't realize me mucking about on that would cut the queue.

1896
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:45,200
Sorry, right, pick a rules, pick a rules.

1897
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:48,200
Choose a rule, any rule, any rule is yours, really.

1898
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,200
Cause I'm gon' play...

1899
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,200
Roothog.

1900
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,200
Of course it kicks out the game when you...

1901
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:56,200
At the prospect of you spending some money on them.

1902
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,200
They're like, oh, hold on a minute, you're not loud enough.

1903
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,200
You ain't not loud enough in there.

1904
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,200
They said, wait.

1905
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,200
Hold on a minute.

1906
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:06,200
Is it pause?

1907
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,200
Is it pause?

1908
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:12,200
Just as a check, I believe my Shibidi Weepidees...

1909
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:14,200
No, not that word.

1910
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:17,200
Maybe live right now with a shooter.

1911
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:24,200
Shibidi is live in four hours with an ASMR collab.

1912
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:27,200
Okay, Amy might be up next.

1913
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,200
I'm not sure.

1914
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:31,200
My purr embers isn't feeling very well at the moment.

1915
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,200
She might be up today.

1916
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,200
No, she's not.

1917
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:39,200
And then Azura is off.

1918
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:42,200
And then Mercy...

1919
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:46,200
Mercy Mooties.

1920
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:51,200
Is on a...

1921
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:54,200
Oh, I have the floor today.

1922
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:58,200
Well, don't mind if I fucking do it.

1923
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:03,200
Don't mind if I fucking do it.

1924
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:07,200
You mean I can play Overwatch all day long,

1925
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,200
without steamrolling over my gen mates

1926
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:13,200
and being hyper shit?

1927
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:17,200
I mean, I don't know.

1928
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:19,200
To me, it sounds like a treat day.

1929
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:23,200
I don't know, but maybe a cheeky Macca's breakfast?

1930
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:25,200
I don't know.

1931
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:26,200
I've got a cola.

1932
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,200
I've got painkillers in my system.

1933
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:31,200
I have the floor, so I don't feel mildly bad

1934
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,200
for streaming for longer times.

1935
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,200
Just read AC later.

1936
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:39,200
My stream is actually getting changed tomorrow.

1937
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,200
I can't do the exercise stream because...

1938
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:48,200
So I have to change it to a smaller stream.

1939
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:55,200
I think we might play the demo for Card Shop TGM.

1940
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:59,200
It's literally the exact same as Supermarket Simulator.

1941
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,200
It's my favourite kind of thing.

1942
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:06,200
So tomorrow's Ring Fit stream will be delayed until next week because...

1943
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:11,200
And I'll also delay Cult of the Lamb

1944
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,200
because that's a longer one as well.

1945
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:17,200
And, you know, some people, like myself,

1946
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
suffer for 48 hours and then you feel fine.

1947
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:22,200
So I just need to, you know, anyway, any spawn camp.

1948
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:24,200
Instead of playing a game together,

1949
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:26,200
how about I play with you?

1950
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:29,200
I'm pretty sure I got your buttons all mapped out

1951
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:32,200
in which ones to push at the right moment.

1952
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:35,200
Oh my god, wait, what's that T-shirt?

1953
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:40,200
T-shirt, gamer, play with me, like buttons, PNG, please.

1954
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:43,200
I'm gonna stick that on my VTuber model so fast.

1955
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,200
I found it, but is that a PNG?

1956
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,200
It's not.

1957
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,200
Okay, hear me out.

1958
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:56,200
I know that...

1959
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:00,200
It's not a PNG, but I might...

1960
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:06,200
I know it's not a PNG.

1961
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:09,200
I know, but come on.

1962
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,200
Should I just leave it on?

1963
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,200
I'll just sit in the corner here like this.

1964
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,200
I know it's not a PNG.

1965
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:18,200
I know, I'm sorry.

1966
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:21,200
Yeah, do you want this?

1967
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:25,200
Okay, Roadhog time, Roadhog time.

1968
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,200
It's perfect. Yeah, you like that.

1969
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:30,200
Jubilee's easy.

1970
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,200
Okay, where am I?

1971
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:36,200
Ah, I need to put something on my head that's from an overwatch character.

1972
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,200
It's so hard to think PNG.

1973
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:41,200
What, who has something in their hair?

1974
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:45,200
What character has something in their hair that's easy to stick on my head?

1975
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:50,200
Why can't you do Ring Fit, Yuntemaut season?

1976
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,200
All I'm saying is that when Sin shows up,

1977
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,200
the world starts to...

1978
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,200
The Bluetooth device is connected when Sin shows up.

1979
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,200
Okay, are we ready?

1980
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,200
Now, unfortunately, the likelihood of us losing goes up quite exponentially when I'm sitting on the tank.

1981
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,200
I'm not even kidding.

1982
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:16,200
I'm not even kidding.

1983
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,200
I'm not even kidding.

1984
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,200
Okay.

1985
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:25,200
That must be her portal, that Juno portal thing.

1986
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,200
More like Sink sister.

1987
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:33,200
That's perfect, perfect.

1988
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,200
Okay, right, Roadhog.

1989
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:40,200
I have... Oh, wait, you said he has a trap now.

1990
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
I knew he was an offend, boys.

1991
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,200
Okay.

1992
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:46,200
What the fuck are you doing?

1993
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:48,200
Hold on, can you leave?

1994
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:50,200
Oh, I missed.

1995
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:57,200
I've never gone against him before, and I'm scared.

1996
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:59,200
Okay, thank God you guys are clutching up for me,

1997
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,200
because, certainly, no me that's clutching up.

1998
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,200
I did not know what was going for me.

1999
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,200
I have 750 health, I've changed it.

2000
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,200
Hmm.

2001
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:10,200
I'm afraid tanks might no longer...

2002
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:13,200
I'm good at... I'm fine with Zarya.

2003
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:16,200
I'm not gonna lie, I hate Roadhog.

2004
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:21,200
Wait, where's my right click?

2005
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2006
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,200
Did I not have a right click anymore?

2007
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,200
Did I not have a right click?

2008
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:33,200
Is it gone?

2009
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:36,200
Did they take it?

2010
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,200
Never forget what they stole from you.

2011
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:42,200
What? Or is my controls messed up?

2012
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:44,200
His right click is gone?

2013
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:49,200
Wait, so I just... I just spam like this the entire time?

2014
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,200
What the...

2015
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:57,200
Frick, Frick, Diddly-Duck, Tic-Tac, Paddy-Wack.

2016
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,200
So, did I have like a longer shoot then?

2017
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:07,200
Was it longer?

2018
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:09,200
Sorry, I just left the engine on.

2019
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:11,200
And I missed! That's embarrassing.

2020
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:13,200
I'm so sorry, I just let you die.

2021
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:16,200
I'm dumb. It's not because I hate you.

2022
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:18,200
I don't know what I'm doing.

2023
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:20,200
Wait, how do I heal?

2024
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:23,200
Oh, this one. Why the Frick would it be that one?

2025
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:26,200
Who? Where?

2026
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:29,200
I can't get you, you weebam.

2027
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:32,200
Oh my gosh!

2028
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:34,200
I'm so sorry, I'm backing up, I'm backing up.

2029
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,200
No, I'm not, I'm going in, I'm going in.

2030
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:38,200
Reflin's going in, boss deep, so am I.

2031
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:41,200
Right, I missed, I missed, sorry. Roadhog is not the character for me.

2032
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:43,200
I can't either, I'm shy, sir.

2033
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,200
No, no, no, I needed to reload.

2034
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:53,200
Unlucky, unlucky.

2035
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:56,200
I still don't know what Juno's ult is.

2036
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:59,200
Oh, she's one HP in a dream.

2037
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,200
No, no, no, no, no, what's going on here?

2038
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:04,200
If you want to fight, fight me.

2039
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:08,200
Shit, I'm in trouble.

2040
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,200
I don't know what to do!

2041
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,200
Where's the Mercy? Fuck you, Peach!

2042
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:16,200
But if it's me, that's the Mercy.

2043
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:20,200
Please be nice to me, I'm just an innocent little Mercy.

2044
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:24,200
Hold to heal, literally, um, this is very...

2045
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,200
That's what your hook is for.

2046
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,200
I do make a good hooker, don't I?

2047
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,200
Oh, right, no I don't, because I keep missing them.

2048
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,200
Oh, get her, get her!

2049
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,200
Oh, she got greedy, she got greedy!

2050
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:44,200
She said I wanted that right, oh!

2051
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:47,200
We cheeky enemy, we cheeky enemy to the left.

2052
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:50,200
Oh, we cheeky enemy, we widow, we widow.

2053
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:53,200
No, I said I'm going for her, fuck you.

2054
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,200
Okay, I'm gonna just push the payload.

2055
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,200
Unfortunately, right.

2056
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:01,200
So the reason why, uh, who come when I do that?

2057
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:05,200
What the fuck, I healed like my, oh my...

2058
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,200
No, I'm trying to stun him from doing anything.

2059
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:12,200
Right, and then Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy!

2060
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:15,200
She popped out, oh!

2061
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:18,200
Oh my god, he's gonna all, I don't know what it's all is, I'm scared.

2062
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:20,200
I hate that kid!

2063
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,200
Right, I'm not playing Roadhog ever again, sorry.

2064
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:25,200
I can't, I can't do it, I can't do that, I'm too shy, so...

2065
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,200
I'm too sheba.

2066
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,200
Don't call me a sheba, you know?

2067
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:31,200
Because that's a random deal.

2068
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:34,200
What was that being?

2069
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:38,200
Right, I don't know how to play, but...

2070
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,200
Almost deathless, almost.

2071
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:47,200
It's because the reflins do pay extra attention to me, though.

2072
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,200
Like, there's no doubt about it.

2073
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,200
Okay, we can kind of cut across this section.

2074
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:54,200
Who goes there?

2075
02:28:55,200 --> 02:29:00,200
I don't know what is fire.

2076
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:03,200
I'm gonna just spray to distract.

2077
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:05,200
No, I miss.

2078
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,200
I miss.

2079
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:09,200
Beat up the tank, get rid of the tank.

2080
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:11,200
As soon as you get done with the tank, you're fine.

2081
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:12,200
Mercy!

2082
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:13,200
Yes.

2083
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,200
I'm sombra.

2084
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:18,200
Oh, I'm still in gear, are we cheeky headshot?

2085
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:19,200
Aye, that's what you get.

2086
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:21,200
That's what you get, you fandom.

2087
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:23,200
Oh!

2088
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,200
Oh!

2089
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:26,200
Well, I gotta wee hint though.

2090
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,200
I gotta wee...

2091
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,200
I gotta wee lickin', so I gotta wee assist.

2092
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:35,200
I forgot you don't really...

2093
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,200
Yeah, literally, I'm like, I'm...

2094
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,200
I'm gonna have my own soon, surely.

2095
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:44,200
Where's my health?

2096
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
Oh no, that's a friendly.

2097
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:48,200
That's a friendly.

2098
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:50,200
Hold on, wait, the echo...

2099
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:51,200
No!

2100
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,200
Why am I so bad at hooking?

2101
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:54,200
So, I used to be really good at Roadhog.

2102
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:57,200
Not to be biased or anything,

2103
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,200
but I actually used to be really good at Roadhog,

2104
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:03,200
and I feel like I don't know the length of his hook or anything.

2105
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:07,200
I sucky sucky, I do sucky sucky,

2106
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,200
and I do sucky sucky.

2107
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,200
Right, fuck it, go and just...

2108
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:12,200
Fuck outta here!

2109
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:14,200
Right, Mercy, you're next to me, bam.

2110
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,200
You wanna be in the front line so bad,

2111
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,200
get the fuck out of my face.

2112
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:19,200
Get up!

2113
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,200
Right, okay, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

2114
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:23,200
I'm afraid the reef ones,

2115
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,200
I'm gonna have to ask yous to clutch up.

2116
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:27,200
Very, I know it's selfish.

2117
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:30,200
I can't do it, I can't do Roadhog, I can't do it.

2118
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:32,200
It's a dilithium, crystals can't,

2119
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:34,200
and they just can't do it.

2120
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:36,200
Well, there's two alive, but...

2121
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:39,200
Oh, Genji's all in, he's getting heals off the break.

2122
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:40,200
He gets one, he gets two,

2123
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:43,200
a healer and a DPS is down, he does perish.

2124
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:45,200
Oh, sorry, fuck, I forgot it,

2125
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:47,200
I don't have a long range hit anymore.

2126
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,200
Go and stop it, go and knock it off, honestly.

2127
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:52,200
Right, yes, yes, yes, we get it.

2128
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,200
Oh no, I'm trapped, what will I ever do?

2129
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:57,200
Heals, heals, heals, heals, heals.

2130
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,200
Okay, right, Juno time, Juno time,

2131
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:03,200
I don't know what Juno does, I'm just maling, I'm maling.

2132
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,200
We don't make her in the back, we don't make her in the back.

2133
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:07,200
Okay, Bob got me, that's fine.

2134
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:11,200
Oh, this is a hard one.

2135
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,200
I'm gonna say it,

2136
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:15,200
we're actually having a fight for this victory.

2137
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,200
I don't know the length of his hook,

2138
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:21,200
I feel like it's a lot shorter than I thought it was.

2139
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,200
I wouldn't be surprised if they shortened,

2140
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:27,200
you know, they gave me a little cheeky circumcision, you know.

2141
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:29,200
Look, we were all thinking of it.

2142
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:31,200
Okay, we're all thinking of it.

2143
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:35,200
Right, stop, right, I'm literally,

2144
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:39,200
my middle finger is hovering off of my right mouse button

2145
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:42,200
because I keep thinking it's a long range when it's not.

2146
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:43,200
He's off.

2147
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:48,200
Okay, one DPS down, Juno in the air, Juno in the air,

2148
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:51,200
Juno in the air, Juno getting hit, Juno got hooked,

2149
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:53,200
reloading on Juno.

2150
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:57,200
I'm doing absolutely terrible against Juno, absolutely terrible.

2151
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,200
I somehow got her, going on Ash, going on Ash,

2152
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:02,200
reloading on Ash's face.

2153
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:06,200
Pushing, I think we've won this, right?

2154
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:08,200
We've won this, sorry.

2155
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:11,200
I think, footsteps, footsteps above.

2156
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:16,200
I feel really bad about that.

2157
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:18,200
Wait, stop pushing, yes, yes!

2158
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:20,200
Oh, we did it!

2159
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,200
It continues, it continues.

2160
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:28,200
We're actually so energy, so I'm not playing Roadhog again.

2161
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,200
That was terrible, I did not enjoy that.

2162
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:34,200
Catalyst, more like, loserless.

2163
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:39,200
Because even though you tried your best, it was not enough.

2164
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:41,200
Reloading on Ash's face.

2165
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:46,200
Oh yeah, more like.

2166
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:49,200
Well, you already know the joke, I'm not gonna say it.

2167
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,200
Oh my god, that's me when I pheromone max.

2168
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:54,200
Oh, I stink so good.

2169
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:57,200
Right, continue, close, change roles, cancel.

2170
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:59,200
Right, I did not mock a new hero.

2171
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,200
Thank you very much.

2172
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:03,200
One more thumb group.

2173
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,200
Yeah, dang, that's a lot of friends.

2174
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:11,200
Right, who?

2175
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:15,200
I'm now on the other page now, I'm opening up the page like a book.

2176
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:19,200
Who has been waiting a while?

2177
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:22,200
I'm trying to see who has been waiting a while.

2178
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:25,200
I feel like you've all been waiting a while.

2179
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:30,200
I feel like you've all been waiting a while and I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.

2180
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,200
I'm trying, I'm trying.

2181
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:35,200
Right, hold on, let me just consult the list.

2182
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,200
Well, I still do one from each page.

2183
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:40,200
I'll still do one from each page, okay?

2184
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:42,200
Chuggy cheese?

2185
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:44,200
I definitely have not had you.

2186
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:48,200
Greta T, you've not been in either.

2187
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:53,200
No tails and blah blah blah, I've not had you because I can't even say your name.

2188
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:55,200
Jess have had you, two moons have had you.

2189
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,200
Technical ninja?

2190
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:01,200
No, I've not had you.

2191
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:09,200
Again, if I have had you, please be super respectful and leave in case I make it whoopsie whoopsie.

2192
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:12,200
A bit of matcha, a bit of green tea.

2193
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:19,200
Okay, we're going to be called the Zen team because we're so relaxed, we're so well behaved.

2194
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:25,200
I just realised I'm not ever posting the pictures of all the scribbles when I write down all your names.

2195
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:28,200
I should maybe do that and just be like, that's me.

2196
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:32,200
Right, this is called the Zen team because I'm going to be relaxed and I'm not going to shout in excitement.

2197
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,200
I'm going to be calm.

2198
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,200
I'm going to be wise.

2199
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:43,200
I am also going to play either healer or DPS.

2200
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:47,200
I don't want to touch tank or a 10 foot pole, it scares me, okay?

2201
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,200
This is, we are peace.

2202
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:53,200
This is about going to be the craziest game so far.

2203
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:54,200
How?

2204
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:57,200
No, we're in our peace.

2205
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,200
Awe.

2206
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,200
Awe.

2207
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,200
Right, I'm going to take the shirt off.

2208
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,200
That came off really quickly.

2209
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:06,200
I did not expect it to come off that quickly.

2210
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:08,200
Right, hold on.

2211
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:09,200
You.

2212
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:10,200
This.

2213
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:11,200
This.

2214
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:13,200
One.

2215
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:18,200
Okay, we did it.

2216
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:19,200
I'm looking forward to the game.

2217
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,200
No.

2218
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:22,200
I am peaceful.

2219
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:24,200
I'm chaotic.

2220
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:31,200
I think I would like

2221
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:34,200
to do that.

2222
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,200
I think, sorry, sorry.

2223
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:39,200
Just, just fucking looking around.

2224
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:41,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2225
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,200
What else is, so let me look up other words for peace.

2226
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:47,200
Other words for peace.

2227
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:49,200
We are tranquil.

2228
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:50,200
We are calm.

2229
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:53,200
We are restfulness.

2230
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:56,200
What the fuck is restfulness?

2231
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:59,200
We are peace and quiet.

2232
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:07,200
Quiet. This is what Google's telling me by the way. We are, we are quieted. What the fuck is quieted?

2233
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:08,200
Quieted.

2234
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,200
Quieted.

2235
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:10,200
Melancholy!

2236
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:11,200
Quieted.

2237
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:17,200
Quieted. I've never heard that. A state of silliness, calmness, and quiet in a, wait, what?

2238
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:24,200
Oh, sorry. A state of stillness, calmness. I don't know why I said that, but I did.

2239
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:30,200
We are silent. We are soundlessness. We are harsh. We are noiseless.

2240
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:34,200
We're also illiterate. We absolutely are.

2241
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:41,200
Thank you the beauty lord for the super chat as well. Like I said, he, we're in a state of silliness. We are in a state of silliness.

2242
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:45,200
Okay, we're searching, we're searching. Hold on, I'm trying it.

2243
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:49,200
My microphone seems to be getting looser and looser and it makes me so nervous.

2244
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,200
Oh, you're gonna hear his plunk and everyone's gonna be like, she has a butt plug in.

2245
02:36:52,200 --> 02:37:00,200
And it's like, no. Literally the Christopher Walken scene. No. I don't wanna. I don't have one.

2246
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:06,200
Melon stream. Beat em up. Recess box, recess box. Beat em up, beat em up, beat em up, beat em up.

2247
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:09,200
Beat em up, beat em up, beat em up, beat em up, beat em up.

2248
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:16,200
Are you squidding me right now? I don't know, are you squidding me, Brian?

2249
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:28,200
Oh, I know that's what I'm saying. I feel bad if yous are waiting, but like, I'm no, right, I'm gonna be controversial.

2250
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:34,200
I'm gonna say something controversial. Yes, we're all hating on me when I was like, I wanna play Overwatch, right?

2251
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:39,200
But then when I put up Overwatch, all of a sudden I've got 63 pals.

2252
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:47,200
Now, hold on a minute. You cannae make fun of me for picking Overwatch if I've got 63 pals sitting.

2253
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,200
So, I don't know, one of us is telling Fiborino's and I ain't me.

2254
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:55,200
One of us is telling Fiborino, you're making fun of me for my Overwatch choice?

2255
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:59,200
You tell him Fiborino's.

2256
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:05,200
Look at my boobs and tell me if I picked a bad game or not.

2257
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:09,200
Hmm? Look? Did I pick a bad game, be honest?

2258
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,200
Look at my...

2259
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:23,200
And tell me I picked a bad game.

2260
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,200
Almost.

2261
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:27,200
Oh god, it kinda looks like I have a penis.

2262
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:31,200
Cause you know how guys have a V? If you don't show the whole picture.

2263
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:33,200
Okay, let me go see mine again.

2264
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:35,200
No giant test time, that comes later.

2265
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:40,200
So yeah, then he'd be coming at me.

2266
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:43,200
Hmm, it's funny, Overwatch 2 is such a bad stream snipe game.

2267
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,200
I'll stream snipe your prostate, how about that?

2268
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:48,200
That's what I'll stream snipe.

2269
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:52,200
Sorry mama, you couldn't pay me enough to play Overwatch.

2270
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,200
F Blizzard.

2271
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:55,200
They got acquired though.

2272
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:58,200
Doesn't that redeem them if they got acquired?

2273
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:01,200
They got acquired by Microsoft.

2274
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:06,200
Personally me, I'm mega hard, but over there they're Microsoft.

2275
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:11,200
Thank you for the super chat, but they got acquired.

2276
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:13,200
My bad, Overwatch is the best game ever.

2277
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:15,200
Thank you, thank you for admitting it.

2278
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,200
Sorry, but I can only get hypnotized by the eyes.

2279
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:21,200
Wait, hold on, hold on, I got it.

2280
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:26,200
No, that's not my hypnosis eyes at all.

2281
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:28,200
Stop, that's not my hypnosis eyes.

2282
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:29,200
Okay, sorry.

2283
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:34,200
You want to play Overwatch with me?

2284
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:37,200
Stop, I was like, that's not my hypnosis.

2285
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:41,200
I still have all the sound effects from that other stream.

2286
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:42,200
Hold on.

2287
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:44,200
Damn boy, were you just frying chicken in there?

2288
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:45,200
Chicken in there?

2289
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:51,200
I want she be to dub that meme, I'm not even kidding.

2290
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,200
I want her to dub it.

2291
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:54,200
You know what, I'm fucking DMing her right now.

2292
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:57,200
I'm literally not, I'm gonna give no context.

2293
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:02,200
Haha, you piss loud as fuck, copypasta.

2294
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:05,200
That's it, that's all I'm sending her.

2295
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:09,200
She will have no other context, for she does not know my name.

2296
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:12,200
Okay, we, oh I'm DPS.

2297
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,200
Alright, time to be French.

2298
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,200
Oh wait, that was Elvis Presley.

2299
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:19,200
That was not a French laughter.

2300
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,200
I'm sorry, Elvis Presley.

2301
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:23,200
Let me retry that game.

2302
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:26,200
Salut, ça va, messieurs?

2303
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:31,200
Je jouais, je jouais 8 mecs.

2304
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:33,200
Hello?

2305
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:36,200
Une balle, une meur.

2306
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:43,200
Mmm, discord.

2307
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:44,200
It's a piggy!

2308
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:47,200
Oh my god, pig girl confirmed for Gentoo because it's so cute.

2309
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:50,200
Chicken, oh it's the hololive chicken girl from Austria.

2310
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:52,200
She always has her boobs out.

2311
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:59,200
That's the only time I see artwork of her is her Austrian flag on her chest and her tits around.

2312
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:01,200
I said what I said.

2313
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:03,200
That's the only time, man.

2314
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,200
No, that's a perfect shot!

2315
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:08,200
How did you fucking arsehole?

2316
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,200
Sorry if anyone's...

2317
02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:22,200
Give me the opportunity to snipe!

2318
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:26,200
Oh yeah, oh yeah piss, oh yeah piss.

2319
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:28,200
There's a ball and spawn.

2320
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,200
Someone's missing a testicle, there's a fucking ball and spawn!

2321
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:34,200
Right, hold on.

2322
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:36,200
Hold on, let me get the shot.

2323
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:38,200
I missed.

2324
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:39,200
Hammond!

2325
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:40,200
Oh my god, no!

2326
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:44,200
Oh my god, I want to play Widowmaker for one game.

2327
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:45,200
Please.

2328
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:47,200
Where are they?

2329
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:48,200
I hear them.

2330
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,200
Oh my god, I got a half shot, I'll take it.

2331
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:51,200
I missed.

2332
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:52,200
I took a shot and I missed again.

2333
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:55,200
Okay, hold on, let me get on this platform.

2334
02:41:57,200 --> 02:41:58,200
I missed again.

2335
02:41:58,200 --> 02:41:59,200
Fucking hell, red!

2336
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,200
Get me off it, sorry, I need to rotate, I'm getting off Hammond.

2337
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:05,200
I'm getting off Widowmaker, I'm not French, I'm sorry I lied to you like this.

2338
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:14,200
Everyone is a terrible pick for me other than, what's his name?

2339
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,200
Right, I've not played Reaper, I've not played Reaper.

2340
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:19,200
Widowmaker's just for the cake.

2341
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:22,200
You're not gonna, oh my ping's 250!

2342
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,200
Oh my god yes, I'll blame the ping!

2343
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:29,200
Oh the ping, it's totally not my absolute kaka aim.

2344
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:31,200
My duty kaka aim.

2345
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:33,200
Oh the ping.

2346
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:35,200
It's just so frustrating, you know?

2347
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:38,200
Oh shucks, it's not my aim whatsoever.

2348
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:44,200
Okay, okay, hit him with the Hammond, hit him with the, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2349
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:46,200
Okay.

2350
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,200
Ooh, I already got on fire.

2351
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:52,200
Only been on him for five seconds, already on fire.

2352
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:54,200
Oh yeah, you're jumping off the map?

2353
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:55,200
Are you scared?

2354
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,200
Right, I'm off, sorry.

2355
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,200
I'm off for a cheeky heal, bye.

2356
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,200
Okay, we did it, we did it.

2357
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:03,200
We're winning, so as we're winning now, I'm on someone that kind of know how to play.

2358
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,200
Come back, come back, come back baby, come back.

2359
02:43:06,200 --> 02:43:07,200
Wait, hold on, I'm out.

2360
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:09,200
Ooh, ooh!

2361
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:11,200
Oh there's a soldier above!

2362
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:12,200
Oh yeah, bleed it.

2363
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:13,200
Oh yeah, bleed it.

2364
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:14,200
No, that's it, I'm coming for you.

2365
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:15,200
I'm coming for your soul!

2366
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:17,200
That's right, you're no killing my Moira

2367
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:20,200
and thinking I'm gonna tolerate that behaviour.

2368
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:23,200
I'm taking big chunks, alright.

2369
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:25,200
Ooh, ooh, turn around.

2370
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:27,200
Right, no, no, I'm coming for you.

2371
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,200
I'm coming for you!

2372
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,200
Alright, she's won.

2373
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:34,200
You can do the rest, you can do the rest.

2374
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:36,200
You can do the rest, you can do the rest.

2375
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:39,200
I did what I had to do, I did what I had to do.

2376
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:42,200
Put me in, oh sorry, I need to be zen.

2377
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:44,200
I forgot, I'm on the camp team.

2378
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:49,200
Death, death heals me.

2379
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:53,200
Death is a nice cold coffin where my body can rest.

2380
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:56,200
For I am calm, I am collected.

2381
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:59,200
I love what I'm able to do.

2382
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:01,200
Piss!

2383
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:03,200
Piss, no!

2384
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:06,200
I mean, oh how unfortunate.

2385
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:09,200
Sometimes fate has other things on my mind.

2386
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,200
Experience tranquility.

2387
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:13,200
Why I'm calm, collected.

2388
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:14,200
I have my ultimate.

2389
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,200
Wait, come, don't go in!

2390
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:17,200
Don't go in, you silly Billy.

2391
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:19,200
We're supposed to go in together.

2392
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:20,200
You have no got heals, darling.

2393
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:21,200
What you doing?

2394
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:23,200
What you doing?

2395
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:25,200
Then he start, then he start making me get raging at the refunds.

2396
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:27,200
Then I think I want to start raging at you.

2397
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,200
Then he be silly Billy.

2398
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:29,200
Right, look at that.

2399
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:31,200
Do you see that HP damage I'm doing from across the map?

2400
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:34,200
I hear someone.

2401
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:40,200
Right, I'm going to ult on the payloads.

2402
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:42,200
I'm in boys.

2403
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:43,200
No, fuck you.

2404
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,200
Fuck, fuck, I'm out of range.

2405
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:51,200
I mean, oh my god, no.

2406
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:54,200
How did I do it?

2407
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:55,200
Right, I said I'm going hands-on.

2408
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,200
I'm just so MLG.

2409
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:57,200
No, no, I'm going Tarbjorn.

2410
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:59,200
No, I'm going tracer because I'm fast.

2411
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:00,200
I'm fast as fuck boys.

2412
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:02,200
I'm coming on point.

2413
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:07,200
Tranquil, peace.

2414
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:09,200
I love Zinnia.

2415
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,200
I love Nepal.

2416
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:12,200
I love the lore that monks are robot.

2417
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:13,200
I hear footsteps.

2418
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:14,200
I hear footsteps.

2419
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:16,200
Oh, I missed the staircase.

2420
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:18,200
That was a wee bit embarrassing.

2421
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:20,200
I'm British.

2422
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:22,200
Hi, I love tracer.

2423
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:24,200
Tracer here.

2424
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:26,200
Tracer here.

2425
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:28,200
Tracer here.

2426
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:31,200
No, he went and got heals to be bobagged.

2427
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:34,200
No, I didn't hear Ken who he's shooting at because it's not me.

2428
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,200
Oh, he's shooting at you, sauce.

2429
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:39,200
I just don't want to let him have an ult from above.

2430
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:42,200
I'm in.

2431
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:43,200
I'm in.

2432
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,200
I'm stuck.

2433
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:46,200
I'm still reachable.

2434
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:49,200
No, sauce, I'm going in.

2435
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:51,200
I'm going in.

2436
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:52,200
I'm going in.

2437
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,200
I finally got him.

2438
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,200
Did we win?

2439
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:57,200
I'm just letting you guys carry me.

2440
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:01,200
I've been carried.

2441
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:03,200
I literally didn't do anything.

2442
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,200
Mommy, you're getting too Zinnia.

2443
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,200
You're going in the opposite direction.

2444
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:09,200
I mean, bro, I'm getting carried hard.

2445
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,200
Oh my God.

2446
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:14,200
Let me just sip my matcha.

2447
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:15,200
My green tea.

2448
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:17,200
Oh my God, I can sing.

2449
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:18,200
Ready?

2450
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:23,200
No, no, no, no, no.

2451
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:29,200
Tracer's here.

2452
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,200
This is my song.

2453
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:31,200
Oh, yeah.

2454
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,200
Tracer here.

2455
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:34,200
I'm ready to suck and fuck.

2456
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:38,200
I'm too hyper playing this game with you.

2457
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:39,200
I need to stop.

2458
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:43,200
Oh, wait, this is a Torbjorn map.

2459
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,200
Are you ready?

2460
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:45,200
This is a Torbjorn.

2461
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:46,200
No, hold on.

2462
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:47,200
Let me change my hero.

2463
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,200
This is a Torbjorn map.

2464
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:50,200
Trust this is Torbjorn map.

2465
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:56,200
Bro, if you've not seen the artworks of Tracer,

2466
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:58,200
I don't know what to tell you.

2467
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:00,200
The Monkey Paw Curls, MonkaS.

2468
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:01,200
Oh, yeah.

2469
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:04,200
It's a Symmetra, but she's not Symmetra.

2470
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:12,200
I'm being a bit.

2471
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:13,200
I'm being a bit.

2472
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:16,200
My turret's up, though.

2473
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:17,200
That's the main thing.

2474
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:20,200
As long as my turret's up, I'm helping my teammate.

2475
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,200
It does not matter that I died.

2476
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:24,200
It does not smath her.

2477
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:26,200
No, nata ma.

2478
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:27,200
I can't speak French.

2479
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:29,200
I keep pretending I can, but I can't.

2480
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,200
Everyone has seen Tracer's artworks, bro.

2481
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:33,200
There's some animations of her.

2482
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:36,200
There was one where she was getting plapped by Roadhog,

2483
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:38,200
and Roadhog was like fucking massive with his belly,

2484
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:39,200
and I used to like,

2485
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,200
religiously go on it all the time.

2486
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:43,200
I don't know if I could find it again.

2487
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:48,200
I just really like what I saw, you know what I'm saying?

2488
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:49,200
Right, hold on.

2489
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,200
Let me get rid of that.

2490
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:52,200
No, Zinnia.

2491
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:53,200
Don't try and destroy my turret.

2492
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:54,200
I'm going to be mad.

2493
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:00,200
Okay, so they are getting no Symmetra!

2494
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,200
Bleed it!

2495
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:03,200
Her wee pissy pissy.

2496
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:07,200
Wait, my turret doesn't recognize her turret?

2497
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,200
Are turrets ignoring each other?

2498
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:13,200
Roadhog kind of base.

2499
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:16,200
Look, I'm in a fat bastard.

2500
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,200
I don't care.

2501
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:18,200
I'm going to see who it is.

2502
02:48:20,200 --> 02:48:23,200
He had a big round tummy,

2503
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:25,200
and it was Tracer on top,

2504
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:28,200
and she was like lowering herself, I think.

2505
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:30,200
I don't know if I can find it, but...

2506
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:33,200
I pick on someone your own size.

2507
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,200
I'm tiny.

2508
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:37,200
No!

2509
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:38,200
I'm doing so bad.

2510
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:39,200
Holy moly moly.

2511
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,200
Right, my ultimate is going to clear this off a bit.

2512
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:49,200
A wee bit.

2513
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:52,200
Are you fucking serious?

2514
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:54,200
See these wee hamsters?

2515
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,200
Extermination on site.

2516
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:57,200
Oh my god, I died.

2517
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:58,200
Right, I have my ultimate.

2518
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:59,200
It's okay, I have my ultimate.

2519
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:00,200
We can bring it back.

2520
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,200
Group up.

2521
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,200
Group up.

2522
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:03,200
Right, do I need to shout at them and group up?

2523
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,200
That's like getting fucking...

2524
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:06,200
Can I talk to them in game?

2525
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:07,200
Hold on, can I talk?

2526
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,200
Am I allowed to talk to them?

2527
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:11,200
They're not even in the...

2528
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:14,200
My microphone has been completely new player experience.

2529
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:17,200
I still can't talk to them.

2530
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:18,200
I want to shit them up.

2531
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:20,200
I want to start screaming at them in game.

2532
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:22,200
I said what I said.

2533
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:25,200
I want to scare them.

2534
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:27,200
Why?

2535
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:29,200
I want to be like,

2536
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:30,200
BOOM!

2537
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:33,200
Right, I need the team to come together.

2538
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,200
I need the tank.

2539
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:36,200
I need the tank.

2540
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:37,200
What?

2541
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:39,200
Hammond the Bam.

2542
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:40,200
Hammond?

2543
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:42,200
Yeah, it is Hammond, right?

2544
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:43,200
He's a wee hamster.

2545
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:44,200
Hammond the Hamster.

2546
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,200
He's trying to knock us off the mag Brigitte.

2547
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:48,200
We must be careful.

2548
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:58,200
I may have used my ult a bit preemptively.

2549
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,200
Look, I'm stalling, okay?

2550
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:00,200
It's called stalling.

2551
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:01,200
I'm actually not...

2552
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,200
I'm totally wasting my ult.

2553
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:04,200
I know.

2554
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:06,200
I got two.

2555
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:07,200
I got two.

2556
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:12,200
I don't know if Lucio can touch.

2557
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:15,200
I think if they...

2558
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:16,200
Hold on.

2559
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:17,200
I think if they can touch, we've got it.

2560
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:20,200
No, Myra.

2561
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:22,200
No.

2562
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,200
I can't believe it.

2563
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:26,200
I can't talk completely.

2564
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:31,200
Right, I'm putting it here.

2565
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:33,200
Oh, no.

2566
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:34,200
I almost got the freaking...

2567
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:35,200
What's her name?

2568
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:37,200
Oh, right.

2569
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:38,200
We lost this one, but that's okay.

2570
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:40,200
That's okay.

2571
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:41,200
That's okay.

2572
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:42,200
We're team Zen, okay?

2573
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:46,200
Zen also means to balance, okay?

2574
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:48,200
And we will balance the ying and yang.

2575
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:52,200
We will win one and we will lose one, okay?

2576
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:54,200
And just because...

2577
02:50:54,200 --> 02:50:57,200
Because of you.

2578
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:00,200
Is it okay if I post on you?

2579
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:02,200
Yeah, I'm literally a streamer.

2580
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:04,200
To focus on fat bastard.

2581
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,200
Stop.

2582
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:06,200
I don't know.

2583
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:07,200
Hold on.

2584
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,200
Let me check my marshmallows in case

2585
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:10,200
one of you's have found it already.

2586
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:11,200
We will watch it live.

2587
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:12,200
I don't care.

2588
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,200
It was so good because it has a big belly in it.

2589
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:16,200
Love me a big belly.

2590
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:19,200
T-shirt.

2591
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:22,200
Oh, you made me a fail for the t-shirt.

2592
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:25,200
A wreathling made me a t-shirt?

2593
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:27,200
I have to say, I swear if I look at your bobby,

2594
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,200
when I open up this link, you're so done.

2595
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:31,200
Oh my god, I messed it up.

2596
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,200
Sorry, low IQ.

2597
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:33,200
I messed it up, right?

2598
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,200
Let me get...

2599
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:35,200
Put me back in, coach.

2600
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:36,200
Put me back in.

2601
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:37,200
Yes.

2602
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:39,200
Check your quest.

2603
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:40,200
Welcome to Overwatch.

2604
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:41,200
Okay.

2605
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:45,200
So, I'm going to show you where you're to put your turret.

2606
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,200
Oh, piss!

2607
02:51:46,200 --> 02:51:47,200
Hammond is ruining it.

2608
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:49,200
If you put your turret here,

2609
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,200
they have to like get put in the way.

2610
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:54,200
They're destroying my turret already.

2611
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:55,200
They better not be.

2612
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:57,200
But like, see how if they cross over,

2613
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:59,200
they get hit by my turret?

2614
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:02,200
Uh...

2615
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:04,200
No.

2616
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:05,200
I'm going to leave it up.

2617
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:06,200
See how it's bothering them?

2618
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:09,200
They're not focusing on damaging my teammates

2619
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:11,200
because of this turret being up.

2620
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:13,200
Hey, oh, my turret almost got someone.

2621
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,200
Yeah, there you go.

2622
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:16,200
Oh shit, we're losing though.

2623
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:19,200
So, I can hide behind...

2624
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:21,200
See, I can hide behind the drum

2625
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:23,200
and we can take the point until...

2626
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:27,200
Right, so Zen's just hiding by the stash.

2627
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:29,200
We're in the best position right now.

2628
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:31,200
Literally, turret set up.

2629
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:32,200
Naifos, name us.

2630
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:34,200
I can hear a Symmetra turret though.

2631
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:36,200
I don't know where it is.

2632
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:41,200
Please be super safe and alive.

2633
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:43,200
Torbjorn is there.

2634
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:46,200
Torbjorn's come down.

2635
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:48,200
Torbjorn's fucked up her moira.

2636
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:50,200
Okay, this could have gone better.

2637
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:51,200
Okay, we do have one kill.

2638
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:52,200
I'll take it.

2639
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:53,200
If I can get the Sim,

2640
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:54,200
I should be okay.

2641
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:57,200
If I can get her to cross into my fucking turret...

2642
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:01,200
I hate when they have brain cells.

2643
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,200
I mean, no.

2644
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:06,200
It is good to have challenges in life.

2645
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:09,200
You will prosper as a person through hardship.

2646
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:16,200
Do you play Team Fortress 2?

2647
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:17,200
I've never played it before.

2648
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:19,200
We can play it for the first time together, if you like.

2649
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:26,200
Right, and now we're going to do...

2650
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:30,200
Oh, no, he put the turret where I was going to put it next.

2651
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:33,200
No, that's stinky.

2652
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:35,200
That's the victory.

2653
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:37,200
Oh shit.

2654
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:38,200
I'm cut.

2655
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:42,200
Probably...

2656
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:43,200
There we go.

2657
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:44,200
See?

2658
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:46,200
See how we almost, like,

2659
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:49,200
debated her into coming into my turret.

2660
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,200
Okay.

2661
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:52,200
Sorry, I just hammered the air.

2662
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:53,200
I got rid...

2663
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:54,200
I'm getting excited.

2664
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:55,200
Spank.

2665
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:56,200
Spank.

2666
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:57,200
Right, I'm spanking the refland.

2667
02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:58,200
One spank.

2668
02:53:58,200 --> 02:53:59,200
Where's another refland?

2669
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,200
I need to spank a Rissa.

2670
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:01,200
Right, spanking Rissa.

2671
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:02,200
Boom.

2672
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:03,200
Take that.

2673
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:04,200
Take this reaper.

2674
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:05,200
Okay, reapers try hard,

2675
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:06,200
so maybe we won't spank them right now.

2676
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:07,200
Hold on, Ana, you need to spank.

2677
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:08,200
Spank.

2678
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:09,200
Right, we're backing off.

2679
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:10,200
We're backing off because enemies are respawning.

2680
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:11,200
Enemies are respawning!

2681
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:12,200
Don't panic.

2682
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:13,200
Oh, no.

2683
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:16,200
What happens if my turret destroyed the balls

2684
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:18,200
and rendered your all...

2685
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:19,200
Oh, no, Ana died.

2686
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:23,200
Oh, my God, I'm being pinned against the wall by a Hammond.

2687
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:24,200
Oh, yeah.

2688
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:26,200
Fucking hell, when did the Hamsters get so strong?

2689
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:28,200
Right, Moira's getting mass occurred.

2690
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:32,200
Uh, I can't even keep you up.

2691
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:33,200
I'm out.

2692
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:34,200
I'm out.

2693
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,200
I don't know where...

2694
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:36,200
I'm out.

2695
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,200
300 ping, by the way, wink, wink.

2696
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:44,200
If you round it up, it's 300 ping.

2697
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:45,200
Like, come on.

2698
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:47,200
Give me the benefit of the doubt.

2699
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,200
Okay.

2700
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:49,200
Okay.

2701
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:50,200
Uh-huh.

2702
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:51,200
Hit him with a...

2703
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:52,200
Hit him with a clear in the area.

2704
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:53,200
That's right.

2705
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:54,200
Hit him with a clear in the area.

2706
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:55,200
We're going for the Zen.

2707
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:56,200
We're going for the Zen.

2708
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:57,200
He's exposed.

2709
02:54:57,200 --> 02:54:58,200
He's vulnerable!

2710
02:54:58,200 --> 02:54:59,200
He's vulnerable!

2711
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:00,200
Unless he hits me, he's not vulnerable.

2712
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:01,200
See?

2713
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:03,200
Okay, fuck it.

2714
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:06,200
Come on.

2715
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:07,200
So he...

2716
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:08,200
So the Zen now can't...

2717
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:09,200
Yeah?

2718
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:10,200
Yeah, you're gonna ult?

2719
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:11,200
Yeah, you're gonna ult?

2720
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:13,200
Yeah.

2721
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:14,200
Yeah.

2722
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:16,200
You're gonna ult and waste it

2723
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:19,200
so you can't utilize it for your team when you need it most?

2724
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:22,200
That's right.

2725
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:23,200
That's right.

2726
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:25,200
Oh, you thought going on top of the drum was gonna work?

2727
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:26,200
Sorry.

2728
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:27,200
I've played this game before.

2729
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:28,200
I hate to break it to you.

2730
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:29,200
I'm sorry.

2731
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:30,200
It...

2732
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:31,200
It pained...

2733
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:33,200
It hurt me to put that...

2734
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:35,200
That previous gamer knowledge.

2735
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:36,200
Ana...

2736
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,200
Ana...

2737
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:38,200
Ana on her own, Mohammed.

2738
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:39,200
Fuck it!

2739
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:40,200
Come in!

2740
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:41,200
Come in everywhere!

2741
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:42,200
I'm splurging!

2742
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:43,200
I can't take it anymore.

2743
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:44,200
It's just too much.

2744
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:47,200
Damn right, I'm powered up.

2745
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:48,200
Uh...

2746
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:49,200
Right, I'm getting everyone.

2747
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,200
Okay, so they expect...

2748
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:53,200
I guess where they expect my turret to be, not in the shrine.

2749
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:55,200
So the turret is now going in the shrine.

2750
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:56,200
Turret in the shrine!

2751
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:57,200
Turret in the shrine!

2752
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,200
No, fuck!

2753
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:01,200
Myra, are you serious, young lady?

2754
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:02,200
Well, anyway.

2755
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:06,200
That's right, team Zen.

2756
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:09,200
Oh, peace and tranquility all over your face.

2757
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:12,200
Oh, peace and tranquility is everywhere.

2758
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,200
Gee, motherfucking...

2759
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:16,200
Gee...

2760
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,200
Achievement unlocked.

2761
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:21,200
Oh, yeah.

2762
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:22,200
Blackjack.

2763
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:23,200
Oh, yeah.

2764
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:24,200
Blackjack.

2765
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:25,200
What does it mean?

2766
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,200
I don't know, but I'm just glad it's having a good time.

2767
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:28,200
Ooh!

2768
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:31,200
A little cheeky, all off the map, and Byra mental kill.

2769
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:32,200
Not bad at all.

2770
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:34,200
Good, good feel be.

2771
02:56:34,200 --> 02:56:35,200
Mm-mm.

2772
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:36,200
Mm-mm.

2773
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:37,200
Mm-mm.

2774
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:41,200
Right, we're gonna check what I need to do in order to...

2775
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,200
Um...

2776
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:45,200
How do I see?

2777
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:46,200
Unavailable...

2778
02:56:46,200 --> 02:56:47,200
Wait, what?

2779
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:48,200
So can I talk in group now?

2780
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:49,200
Hello?

2781
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:51,200
I think...

2782
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:52,200
Hello?

2783
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:54,200
I think I can talk in group now.

2784
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:00,200
I think I can start screaming at the refunds.

2785
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:05,200
Like, not to get political, but I think I can start screaming at yous in game.

2786
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:09,200
Am I gonna be scaring yous?

2787
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:10,200
I mean, I kid.

2788
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:11,200
Right.

2789
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:13,200
Becks, you're literally in a competitive game.

2790
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:15,200
I'm not gonna throw you out of that.

2791
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:16,200
Broly, have you had a chance?

2792
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:19,200
I'm opening up my map, my agendination.

2793
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:20,200
Broly not had a chance.

2794
02:57:20,200 --> 02:57:23,200
Oh wait, I wrote your name before you could have accepted.

2795
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:24,200
Because you may not accept.

2796
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:25,200
Oh my gosh, may not accept.

2797
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:26,200
I see.

2798
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:27,200
Um...

2799
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,200
Mm-mm.

2800
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:29,200
And the next page...

2801
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:30,200
Mm-mm.

2802
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:31,200
Mm-mm.

2803
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:32,200
Mm-mm.

2804
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:34,200
And the next page...

2805
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:35,200
Um...

2806
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:36,200
Is there...

2807
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:37,200
Easy...

2808
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:38,200
Isn't...

2809
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:39,200
I'm gonna say...

2810
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:41,200
That's a name, isn't it?

2811
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:42,200
Ziko.

2812
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:43,200
That's a name.

2813
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:44,200
Oh yeah!

2814
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:48,200
Excuse me.

2815
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:50,200
Did I give you permission to speak?

2816
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:54,200
Do you think I'm gonna scare them?

2817
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:56,200
I don't wanna scare the refunds.

2818
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:58,200
Are they gonna be scared to talk to me?

2819
02:57:58,200 --> 02:57:59,200
They might be.

2820
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:01,200
Uh...

2821
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:02,200
Oh yeah.

2822
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:03,200
Oh yeah.

2823
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:04,200
Right, who's not had a chance?

2824
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:05,200
Sprung Cobra?

2825
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:08,200
I don't think you were a part of the F team, were you?

2826
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:09,200
Mm-mm.

2827
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:10,200
No, you weren't.

2828
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:12,200
Sprung Cobra.

2829
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:13,200
I'm from...

2830
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:15,200
Sip it, ret hot and go,

2831
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:16,200
Yahoo!

2832
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:17,200
Beah, beah, reeah.

2833
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:18,200
And then...

2834
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:20,200
Page four...

2835
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:24,200
You've got an X in your name.

2836
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:26,200
I've not had you in.

2837
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:28,200
And together, we will make

2838
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:29,200
the microphone blowers.

2839
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:31,200
Cos do you remember in dead lobbies,

2840
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:33,200
if you got annoyed at the enemy team,

2841
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:34,200
you're just blowing your mic,

2842
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:35,200
so we're called the blik...

2843
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:37,200
the MIC blowers.

2844
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:38,200
Mm-mm.

2845
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:40,200
I'm running out of air cos I'm talking so much,

2846
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:41,200
cos I'm so excited!

2847
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,000
Right, wait, can I scare them?

2848
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Boo.

2849
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Okay.

2850
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:47,560
But don't talk.

2851
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:48,560
Because mail on stream.

2852
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:51,920
Wait, no, you can put, but don't talk.

2853
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,920
You're not allowed to talk.

2854
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:56,600
Right, I've not unlocked any new heroes yet, but I'm allowed to talk, okay?

2855
02:58:56,600 --> 02:59:00,160
I'm blowing the mic, but I'm blowing it right now.

2856
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:01,160
You're not allowed to talk.

2857
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:04,440
But I'm allowed to talk to you and make demands, okay?

2858
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:05,440
They will get a fear-boner.

2859
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:06,440
Are you scared?

2860
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:07,440
Are you scared?

2861
02:59:07,440 --> 02:59:08,440
Oh, that's embarrassing.

2862
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:13,440
I just whistled when I said that.

2863
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:15,440
Do we mail on stream each other?

2864
02:59:15,440 --> 02:59:16,440
I whistled.

2865
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:19,440
I know they heard that whistle because I fucking heard it.

2866
02:59:19,440 --> 02:59:20,440
It was piercing.

2867
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:21,440
It was ear-piercingly loud.

2868
02:59:21,440 --> 02:59:22,440
I'm scaring you.

2869
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:24,440
I'm giving them the heebie-jeebie.

2870
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:28,440
I should start interviewing and be like, so when did you become a reflin?

2871
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:30,440
Prove you're a reflin right now.

2872
02:59:30,440 --> 02:59:33,080
Prove you're a reflin right now.

2873
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:36,800
What is my favorite type of meat?

2874
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:40,560
There's actually two answers to that.

2875
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:41,560
Come on.

2876
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:44,800
Are they going to be too scared to say anything?

2877
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:47,880
They're not saying anything.

2878
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:50,120
I think I've terrified them.

2879
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:52,800
Are they just sweet shit in themselves?

2880
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:53,800
Chicken.

2881
02:59:53,800 --> 02:59:54,800
Yeah, but you're not talking.

2882
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:55,800
I don't know.

2883
02:59:55,800 --> 03:00:00,800
Do you?

2884
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:01,800
Two types of meat.

2885
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:02,800
Chicken and a reflin, exactly.

2886
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:05,800
I was going to say calamari because your tentacle counts as well.

2887
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:06,800
Oh, wait.

2888
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:07,800
Hold on.

2889
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:08,800
Hold on.

2890
03:00:08,800 --> 03:00:10,800
The reflin sent me a PNG.

2891
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:11,800
Fuck!

2892
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:15,800
The reflin sent me a PNG.

2893
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:18,800
Oh, my God.

2894
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:19,800
Oh, my God.

2895
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:23,800
I'm getting links to the Roadhog thing as well.

2896
03:00:23,800 --> 03:00:24,800
Wait.

2897
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:25,800
Where's the P...

2898
03:00:25,800 --> 03:00:27,800
I need the PNG.

2899
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:28,800
Oh, my God.

2900
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:29,800
Are we in Australia?

2901
03:00:29,800 --> 03:00:30,800
Real, I'm sure.

2902
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:33,800
I'm going to have good ping for once.

2903
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:34,800
Please.

2904
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:39,800
Oh, you did PNG it for me.

2905
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:40,800
Hold on.

2906
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:41,800
Fucking fire.

2907
03:00:41,800 --> 03:00:44,800
I'm not giving fire a try.

2908
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:45,800
Hold on.

2909
03:00:45,800 --> 03:00:46,800
How do I do this fast?

2910
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:47,800
All right.

2911
03:00:47,800 --> 03:00:48,800
Test me.

2912
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:49,800
He put on.

2913
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:50,800
Hold on.

2914
03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:51,800
Put on the shirt.

2915
03:00:51,800 --> 03:00:52,800
Oh, no.

2916
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:53,800
Don't make me bigger.

2917
03:00:53,800 --> 03:00:54,800
Make the shirt.

2918
03:00:54,800 --> 03:00:55,800
There we go.

2919
03:00:55,800 --> 03:00:56,800
Okay.

2920
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:58,800
I'm a real gamer now.

2921
03:00:58,800 --> 03:00:59,800
Okay.

2922
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:00,800
Okay, we did it.

2923
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:01,800
What is this?

2924
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:02,800
Prepare to attack.

2925
03:01:02,800 --> 03:01:03,800
Oh, no.

2926
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:06,800
This is the new game mode I'm not really familiar with.

2927
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,800
Okay.

2928
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:08,800
Oh, my God.

2929
03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:11,800
It's so not put on me correctly.

2930
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:15,800
It rotates off of me so much.

2931
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:16,800
Right.

2932
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:17,800
I'll fix it after this game.

2933
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:19,800
I'll fix it after this game.

2934
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:20,800
A little more man on stream.

2935
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:21,800
Well, you better win.

2936
03:01:21,800 --> 03:01:22,800
No pressure.

2937
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:23,800
Okay.

2938
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:24,800
Right.

2939
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:25,800
Farah looks the exact same.

2940
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:29,800
I don't seem to not recognize anything from Farah.

2941
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:30,800
Okay.

2942
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:31,800
I'm linking Farah.

2943
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:32,800
What's this?

2944
03:01:32,800 --> 03:01:33,800
Oh, wow.

2945
03:01:33,800 --> 03:01:34,800
I have mobility.

2946
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:39,800
I have a mobility shot for the air.

2947
03:01:39,800 --> 03:01:42,800
Now hold on a minute.

2948
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:43,800
Let's go.

2949
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:44,800
Bruh.

2950
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:45,800
I'm so sorry.

2951
03:01:45,800 --> 03:01:46,800
Me.

2952
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:47,800
Oh, my God.

2953
03:01:47,800 --> 03:01:48,800
Me just got me.

2954
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:49,800
Right.

2955
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:50,800
Oh, my God.

2956
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:57,800
Farah has like a wee mobility thing now.

2957
03:01:57,800 --> 03:02:02,800
I need to try and get him in the crossfire.

2958
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:06,800
I don't want him to reflect and hit me, but I'm trying to get...

2959
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,800
Jeez.

2960
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,800
You guys are aggressive.

2961
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:09,800
Get him.

2962
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:11,800
The reflings are no calling it.

2963
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:13,800
I'm just going to aim down.

2964
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:14,800
I worked.

2965
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:15,800
I worked.

2966
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:16,800
I'm beating him up.

2967
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:17,800
Beat him up.

2968
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:18,800
Beat him up.

2969
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:19,800
Beat him up.

2970
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:20,800
Recess pass.

2971
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:21,800
Recess pass.

2972
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:22,800
Beat him up.

2973
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:23,800
Beat him up.

2974
03:02:23,800 --> 03:02:24,800
I don't have to be tranquil anymore.

2975
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:25,800
Okay.

2976
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:26,800
I'm allowed to be excited.

2977
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:27,800
I'm so excited.

2978
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:30,800
I just can't hate it.

2979
03:02:30,800 --> 03:02:31,800
I know.

2980
03:02:31,800 --> 03:02:32,800
I know.

2981
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:33,800
I know.

2982
03:02:33,800 --> 03:02:34,800
Something.

2983
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:35,800
Oh, I'm going to have ultimate soon.

2984
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,800
Right.

2985
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:37,800
Enemies are going to have ultimate soon as well.

2986
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:38,800
Just to warn you, it's my darlings.

2987
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:39,800
I'm backing off.

2988
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:40,800
Back off if you can.

2989
03:02:40,800 --> 03:02:41,800
Back off.

2990
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:42,800
I'm scaring them.

2991
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:43,800
I'm getting just back up a little bit.

2992
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:44,800
I'm going to give them fucking...

2993
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:45,800
What is it called when you get scared of someone?

2994
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:46,800
But like, you want to keep into...

2995
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:47,800
Is it...

2996
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:48,800
No.

2997
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:49,800
What's the...

2998
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:50,800
It's just...

2999
03:02:50,800 --> 03:02:51,800
It's just...

3000
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:53,800
But like, you want to keep into...

3001
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:54,800
Is it...

3002
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:55,800
No.

3003
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:56,800
What's the...

3004
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:57,800
It's the stockman syndrome.

3005
03:02:57,800 --> 03:03:01,800
I'm going to give them stockman syndrome.

3006
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:02,800
My poor babies.

3007
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:03,800
They don't deserve this.

3008
03:03:03,800 --> 03:03:04,800
Moira, can I...

3009
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:05,800
You know what?

3010
03:03:05,800 --> 03:03:07,800
Am I allowed to scream at the healers?

3011
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:08,800
Do you think they'd like it?

3012
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:09,800
Oh!

3013
03:03:09,800 --> 03:03:11,800
I wonder why I didn't get a heal.

3014
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:14,800
Moira's fucking gobbling them off and spawning.

3015
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:15,800
I'm coming for you, Reflin.

3016
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:16,800
I'm just kidding.

3017
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:17,800
You don't discipline me.

3018
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:20,800
Please understand if I ever insult you, it's for funsies.

3019
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:21,800
Wait!

3020
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:24,800
You have a boost coming out of spawn now?

3021
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:26,800
Uh, hold on a minute.

3022
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:29,800
That's kinda hashtag smart.

3023
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:32,800
I'm coming in!

3024
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:33,800
I'm...

3025
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:34,800
I'm helping!

3026
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:35,800
I'm helping!

3027
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:38,800
Stop healing them, Jesus.

3028
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:39,800
Where's Allari?

3029
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:40,800
Allari!

3030
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,800
Allari!

3031
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:42,800
Allari!

3032
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:43,800
Right.

3033
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:44,800
Me!

3034
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:45,800
Me!

3035
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
Me!

3036
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:47,800
Me next!

3037
03:03:47,800 --> 03:03:48,800
Me next!

3038
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:49,800
Me next!

3039
03:03:49,800 --> 03:03:51,800
Uh, pick the...

3040
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:52,800
Ozzy!

3041
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:53,800
Ozzy!

3042
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:54,800
Ozzy!

3043
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:55,800
Right, and then me!

3044
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:56,800
Then me!

3045
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:57,800
Maino heal!

3046
03:03:57,800 --> 03:03:58,800
Maino heal our wall!

3047
03:03:58,800 --> 03:03:59,800
Maino wall our heal our ice!

3048
03:03:59,800 --> 03:04:00,800
Okay, and then Ozzy!

3049
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:03,800
I need to console...

3050
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:04,800
I need us to be...

3051
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:06,800
To share our one brain cell.

3052
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:09,800
I need us to share the brain cell.

3053
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:12,800
Where the fuck did he go?

3054
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:13,800
Where the fuck...

3055
03:04:13,800 --> 03:04:14,800
Right.

3056
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:17,800
Okay, we're in trouble.

3057
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:19,800
I've not got it.

3058
03:04:19,800 --> 03:04:20,800
Sorry.

3059
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:21,800
I fucked up.

3060
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:22,800
I'm so sorry, darlings.

3061
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:23,800
I'm trying.

3062
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:24,800
I'm going...

3063
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:25,800
Get the Junker Queen.

3064
03:04:25,800 --> 03:04:26,800
Okay.

3065
03:04:26,800 --> 03:04:27,800
Genji next.

3066
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:28,800
Wherever the fuck he is.

3067
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:29,800
Yes.

3068
03:04:29,800 --> 03:04:30,800
Yes.

3069
03:04:30,800 --> 03:04:31,800
Yes.

3070
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:32,800
The brain cell!

3071
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:33,800
We're sharing the brain cell!

3072
03:04:33,800 --> 03:04:34,800
We're doing it.

3073
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:35,800
Okay.

3074
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:38,800
Maino heal after she comes out so we can all throttle her.

3075
03:04:38,800 --> 03:04:41,800
Our wall doesn't count as a heal.

3076
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:42,800
Okay.

3077
03:04:42,800 --> 03:04:43,800
Next point.

3078
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:46,800
Uh, look on the map where it is.

3079
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:47,800
Over here.

3080
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:48,800
Over here.

3081
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:49,800
Okay.

3082
03:04:49,800 --> 03:04:51,800
We will now waddle our way to the next point.

3083
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:54,800
Swarm intelligence, actually, though.

3084
03:04:54,800 --> 03:04:57,800
And before anyone says, oh my god, you're tryharding.

3085
03:04:57,800 --> 03:04:58,800
Uh, yeah.

3086
03:04:58,800 --> 03:05:02,800
I don't play video games to fucking lose, you moron.

3087
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:03,800
Oh my god, that was so mean.

3088
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:04,800
I didn't mean to say it like that.

3089
03:05:04,800 --> 03:05:06,800
That came out a lot meaner than I wanted.

3090
03:05:06,800 --> 03:05:09,800
I wanted it to be humorous, but that came out really mean.

3091
03:05:09,800 --> 03:05:10,800
I'm so sorry.

3092
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:12,800
I just, like, winnin' in games.

3093
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:13,800
Like, I don't wanna...

3094
03:05:13,800 --> 03:05:15,800
Oh, I was purple so you couldn't have healed me.

3095
03:05:15,800 --> 03:05:16,800
It's okay.

3096
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:17,800
Like...

3097
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:21,800
I hope that didn't come off meaner than I meant to say.

3098
03:05:21,800 --> 03:05:24,800
I didn't mean I didn't play video games to mean.

3099
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:25,800
I'm done.

3100
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,800
Like, I enjoy winning.

3101
03:05:27,800 --> 03:05:28,800
Don't get me wrong.

3102
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:32,800
A good bot spanking, like, you know when it's close and you get your bot spanked and it's

3103
03:05:32,800 --> 03:05:33,800
like, oh yeah.

3104
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:34,800
Oh yeah.

3105
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:35,800
I'm raging.

3106
03:05:35,800 --> 03:05:36,800
Ken, what do I mean?

3107
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:37,800
Oh my god, leave my reclines alone.

3108
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:38,800
No, sorry.

3109
03:05:38,800 --> 03:05:39,800
I'm laying down cover fire.

3110
03:05:39,800 --> 03:05:41,800
I'm laying down cover fire.

3111
03:05:41,800 --> 03:05:42,800
Get me in there.

3112
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:43,800
Put me in, coach.

3113
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:44,800
No, no, no.

3114
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:47,800
If you wanna be out here, I'm gonna bump you about.

3115
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:49,800
I'm farming heals.

3116
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:53,800
I'm farming, not heals, all on her.

3117
03:05:53,800 --> 03:05:54,800
Oh!

3118
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:55,800
Right.

3119
03:05:55,800 --> 03:05:59,800
I'm glad he killed me because I actually pressed Q there.

3120
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:00,800
I'm not gonna lie.

3121
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:01,800
Right.

3122
03:06:01,800 --> 03:06:04,800
We need our group hive mind to come together because it's not working.

3123
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:05,800
My brain's not working.

3124
03:06:05,800 --> 03:06:10,800
And my brain needs to come together.

3125
03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:11,800
Be more mean.

3126
03:06:11,800 --> 03:06:12,800
It's hot.

3127
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:15,800
I feel like it's scary.

3128
03:06:15,800 --> 03:06:18,800
I mean, shit, if you're asking for it.

3129
03:06:18,800 --> 03:06:19,800
Right.

3130
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:20,800
I'm not going in.

3131
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:21,800
So I'm not going in.

3132
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:22,800
They can have that point.

3133
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:23,800
No!

3134
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:26,800
I never did that.

3135
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:28,800
Thank you, chair and the bail.

3136
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:29,800
I'm hiding.

3137
03:06:29,800 --> 03:06:30,800
Oh my god.

3138
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:31,800
They heard me.

3139
03:06:31,800 --> 03:06:32,800
They heard my rocket propellers.

3140
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:33,800
I'm hiding.

3141
03:06:33,800 --> 03:06:34,800
Yella is more.

3142
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:35,800
It helps.

3143
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:38,800
I feel like I'm gonna accidentally say the R word.

3144
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:42,800
If I really get, you know, like, it's just gamer talk.

3145
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:43,800
Okay.

3146
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:44,800
New objective.

3147
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:45,800
Wait.

3148
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:47,800
I need to say something mean.

3149
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:48,800
Open your eyes.

3150
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:50,800
There's a new location.

3151
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:54,800
I must sound absolutely chaotic for them on the other side because there's a stream delay

3152
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:55,800
as well.

3153
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:56,800
So they hear it twice.

3154
03:06:56,800 --> 03:06:58,800
I don't know how to be mean.

3155
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:00,800
Oh, you fucking idiot.

3156
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:01,800
Bonk.

3157
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:02,800
War insult.

3158
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:05,800
Give me insults to say to them.

3159
03:07:05,800 --> 03:07:06,800
R word season.

3160
03:07:06,800 --> 03:07:07,800
Oh god.

3161
03:07:07,800 --> 03:07:08,800
They're all coming from behind.

3162
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:11,800
As opposed to coming from the front.

3163
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:15,800
You'll need to type insults in chat.

3164
03:07:15,800 --> 03:07:16,800
Okay.

3165
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:20,800
Come to me and I'll heal you.

3166
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,800
I'm so sorry.

3167
03:07:21,800 --> 03:07:23,800
She literally pirouetted into my fucking hole.

3168
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:25,800
I'm so sorry.

3169
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:26,800
Okay.

3170
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:27,800
Okay.

3171
03:07:27,800 --> 03:07:28,800
Oh my god.

3172
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:29,800
I can't.

3173
03:07:29,800 --> 03:07:32,800
I can't keep dying.

3174
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:33,800
Weakling.

3175
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:34,800
That's right.

3176
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:35,800
Ooh.

3177
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:36,800
Ooh.

3178
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:39,800
Did you just come in here from World of Warcraft?

3179
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:41,800
Oh my god.

3180
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:43,800
Never played this game before, have you?

3181
03:07:43,800 --> 03:07:44,800
Ooh.

3182
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:45,800
Ooh.

3183
03:07:45,800 --> 03:07:46,800
I'm hitting them where it hurts.

3184
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:48,800
I'm hitting them where it hurts.

3185
03:07:48,800 --> 03:07:49,800
Okay.

3186
03:07:49,800 --> 03:07:52,800
Your life is as valuable as a summer ant.

3187
03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:53,800
Oh, that's a really...

3188
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:55,800
That one's harsh.

3189
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:56,800
Right.

3190
03:07:56,800 --> 03:07:58,800
Well, if we lose this fight, I'll say the ant lane.

3191
03:07:58,800 --> 03:07:59,800
Right.

3192
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:00,800
I'm going for the healing.

3193
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:01,800
Right.

3194
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:03,800
So they don't have a heal from that.

3195
03:08:03,800 --> 03:08:04,800
I'm going...

3196
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:06,800
I'm trying to get Elaria, but she cannot.

3197
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:07,800
Elaria evade in me.

3198
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:09,800
You know what I'm saying?

3199
03:08:09,800 --> 03:08:10,800
Oh my god.

3200
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:11,800
Me, go away.

3201
03:08:11,800 --> 03:08:12,800
Not now, me.

3202
03:08:12,800 --> 03:08:13,800
Me, no.

3203
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:19,800
I'm about to start screaming.

3204
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:21,800
I can't stay alive this fucking game.

3205
03:08:21,800 --> 03:08:25,800
Caracall, you piece of fucking shit.

3206
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:26,800
I need a set.

3207
03:08:26,800 --> 03:08:27,800
We all need a set.

3208
03:08:27,800 --> 03:08:28,800
Right.

3209
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:29,800
Get me.

3210
03:08:29,800 --> 03:08:30,800
Me behind.

3211
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:31,800
Me behind with Genji.

3212
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:33,800
And she gets the heal.

3213
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:36,800
I can't eat fucking data.

3214
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:37,800
I'm getting redone.

3215
03:08:37,800 --> 03:08:38,800
No, so is...

3216
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:39,800
I'm coming out.

3217
03:08:39,800 --> 03:08:41,800
I'm coming out.

3218
03:08:41,800 --> 03:08:44,800
And I'm going to let you know.

3219
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:46,800
Your life is as valuable as a summer ant.

3220
03:08:46,800 --> 03:08:47,800
That's what you get!

3221
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:51,800
You walk into my bullets and you think you're going to win?

3222
03:08:51,800 --> 03:08:52,800
Fucking...

3223
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:53,800
Like...

3224
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:54,800
Just...

3225
03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:55,800
Oh, right.

3226
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:57,800
I need glasses for a blind man.

3227
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:01,800
Fucking dozen buzhing zhoush.

3228
03:09:01,800 --> 03:09:02,800
Someone else!

3229
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:05,800
Right, we're winning.

3230
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:06,800
We're winning.

3231
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,800
I refuse to lose this.

3232
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:11,800
I actually refuse to lose against the fucking me when I'm a pharaoh.

3233
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:12,800
Don't care.

3234
03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:13,800
Die.

3235
03:09:13,800 --> 03:09:14,800
Perish.

3236
03:09:14,800 --> 03:09:16,800
Genji, Genji, Genji, Genji.

3237
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:17,800
Right, brain cell this.

3238
03:09:17,800 --> 03:09:18,800
Brain cell this.

3239
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:20,800
I'm going to start screaming.

3240
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:21,800
Typical nation.

3241
03:09:21,800 --> 03:09:23,800
I made it to the live stream house, Johnny.

3242
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:24,800
Please lower your volume.

3243
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:26,800
I'll need to put a big warning at the top of the screen.

3244
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:29,800
Lower your volume now before it's too late.

3245
03:09:31,800 --> 03:09:32,800
Okay.

3246
03:09:33,800 --> 03:09:34,800
Okay.

3247
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:37,800
Instead of R, we'll just say any other word like refunded.

3248
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:40,800
You fucking refling!

3249
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:43,800
Right, Genji won.

3250
03:09:43,800 --> 03:09:45,800
I did what I had to do.

3251
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:49,800
Right.

3252
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:50,800
Alright, okay.

3253
03:09:50,800 --> 03:09:51,800
Yes!

3254
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:52,800
Yes!

3255
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:53,800
Go in the attack!

3256
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:54,800
Go in the attack!

3257
03:09:54,800 --> 03:09:55,800
Fuck!

3258
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:57,800
Oh, I got to play the game.

3259
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:58,800
Hem with the uh.

3260
03:09:58,800 --> 03:09:59,800
Hem with the pirouet.

3261
03:09:59,800 --> 03:10:00,800
Hem with the uh.

3262
03:10:00,800 --> 03:10:01,800
Right, okay.

3263
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:02,800
We did it.

3264
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:03,800
I got to play the game for that.

3265
03:10:03,800 --> 03:10:04,800
I got to play the game for that.

3266
03:10:04,800 --> 03:10:05,800
I don't care.

3267
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:06,800
I got to play the game.

3268
03:10:06,800 --> 03:10:07,800
We are not losing.

3269
03:10:07,800 --> 03:10:08,800
Oh, my God.

3270
03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:09,800
Look at that.

3271
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:10,800
Oh, my God.

3272
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:11,800
You're a real Overwatch player.

3273
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:13,800
You have a Christmas skin.

3274
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:15,800
Oh, God, they're coming.

3275
03:10:15,800 --> 03:10:16,800
Oh, wait.

3276
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:17,800
I hear them.

3277
03:10:17,800 --> 03:10:19,800
Suck the Genji off wherever he is.

3278
03:10:19,800 --> 03:10:20,800
I don't care when he is.

3279
03:10:20,800 --> 03:10:22,800
Alright, they're all coming from there.

3280
03:10:22,800 --> 03:10:23,800
You hear them?

3281
03:10:23,800 --> 03:10:24,800
You've got directional sound.

3282
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:27,800
Unless you're a death reaper and you have to use the AI to know what I'm saying.

3283
03:10:27,800 --> 03:10:28,800
I'm so sorry.

3284
03:10:28,800 --> 03:10:30,800
It's wrong, like, all the time.

3285
03:10:30,800 --> 03:10:32,800
I'm attacking from afar.

3286
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:35,800
I need to use my distance to my advantage.

3287
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:36,800
Fantastic.

3288
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:37,800
Me.

3289
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:38,800
Me.

3290
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:39,800
Okay.

3291
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:40,800
I'm starting to lose my voice, but that's okay.

3292
03:10:40,800 --> 03:10:41,800
That's not going to stop me.

3293
03:10:43,800 --> 03:10:44,800
Okay, new objective.

3294
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:46,800
Okay, I wasn't paying attention.

3295
03:10:46,800 --> 03:10:47,800
New objective.

3296
03:10:47,800 --> 03:10:48,800
We're going to fucking find her.

3297
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:50,800
I'm salivating, not from my mouth.

3298
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:55,800
We're actually so fucking good at this game.

3299
03:10:57,800 --> 03:10:59,800
Oh, that's actually really good.

3300
03:10:59,800 --> 03:11:01,800
Bro, I need to take my clothes off.

3301
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:02,800
I'm sweating.

3302
03:11:02,800 --> 03:11:03,800
I'm getting so excited playing this game.

3303
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:08,800
I'll take my clothes off after this round.

3304
03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:11,800
Get too excited.

3305
03:11:11,800 --> 03:11:12,800
No!

3306
03:11:12,800 --> 03:11:13,800
Not freaking Sombra!

3307
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:14,800
Are you joking?

3308
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:15,800
Are you joking?

3309
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:19,800
Yes.

3310
03:11:19,800 --> 03:11:22,800
If you're happy and you know what, clap your hands.

3311
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:27,800
I'm sad.

3312
03:11:27,800 --> 03:11:28,800
Oh, where are you?

3313
03:11:29,800 --> 03:11:30,800
There is more to learn.

3314
03:11:30,800 --> 03:11:31,800
What a voice line.

3315
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:32,800
Hit the level.

3316
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:34,800
Let's go.

3317
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:35,800
We need to group up.

3318
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:39,800
We need to group up like the groupies you are, reflings.

3319
03:11:39,800 --> 03:11:40,800
That's right.

3320
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:43,800
You've got backstage passes and I'm dragging you.

3321
03:11:45,800 --> 03:11:46,800
Right, we need to group up.

3322
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:48,800
We need to group up.

3323
03:11:48,800 --> 03:11:49,800
Don't fucking go in.

3324
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:50,800
Group up!

3325
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:53,800
You will pocket me.

3326
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:55,800
Oh.

3327
03:11:56,800 --> 03:11:57,800
No, no.

3328
03:11:58,800 --> 03:11:59,800
Okay, we're ready.

3329
03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:01,800
I'm ready for a motion.

3330
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:02,800
I'm ready for a motion.

3331
03:12:03,800 --> 03:12:04,800
That's a SpongeBob reference.

3332
03:12:05,800 --> 03:12:06,800
Oh my God.

3333
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:07,800
Oh my God.

3334
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:09,800
Oh my God.

3335
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:11,800
Open!

3336
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:12,800
Get away!

3337
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:13,800
Get away!

3338
03:12:14,800 --> 03:12:15,800
He's gone.

3339
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:17,800
He's gone and moistened his fucking knife.

3340
03:12:17,800 --> 03:12:18,800
Get him.

3341
03:12:18,800 --> 03:12:20,800
The UK government's going to get you.

3342
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:22,800
You're not allowed a knife like that.

3343
03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:23,800
Right, we're actually going to...

3344
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:25,800
No, we can let them win this one.

3345
03:12:25,800 --> 03:12:26,800
Okay, let them win.

3346
03:12:26,800 --> 03:12:27,800
Regroup.

3347
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:30,800
I'm getting lightheaded from how much I'm screaming.

3348
03:12:31,800 --> 03:12:33,800
Okay, I'm going to get some water.

3349
03:12:33,800 --> 03:12:34,800
Actually...

3350
03:12:35,800 --> 03:12:36,800
Okay.

3351
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:37,800
It's okay.

3352
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:38,800
It's okay.

3353
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:39,800
I know how to shoot.

3354
03:12:39,800 --> 03:12:40,800
I know how to shoot.

3355
03:12:41,800 --> 03:12:42,800
Okay.

3356
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:43,800
New objective.

3357
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:44,800
I don't...

3358
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:45,800
I'm really not even paying attention, to be honest.

3359
03:12:45,800 --> 03:12:46,800
I'm in the air.

3360
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:47,800
Bye.

3361
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:48,800
His all is not my problem.

3362
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:49,800
I'm off.

3363
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:52,800
His all is not my problem.

3364
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:53,800
I have flay.

3365
03:12:53,800 --> 03:12:54,800
I'm...

3366
03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:55,800
Doomfist!

3367
03:12:55,800 --> 03:12:56,800
Doomfist!

3368
03:12:56,800 --> 03:12:57,800
Doomfist!

3369
03:12:57,800 --> 03:12:58,800
Okay.

3370
03:12:58,800 --> 03:13:00,800
And then objective to the objective.

3371
03:13:00,800 --> 03:13:01,800
Huzzah!

3372
03:13:01,800 --> 03:13:02,800
Huzzah!

3373
03:13:02,800 --> 03:13:04,800
We're walking to the objective.

3374
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:05,800
Huzzah!

3375
03:13:05,800 --> 03:13:06,800
Huzzah!

3376
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:08,800
We're fucking walking.

3377
03:13:08,800 --> 03:13:09,800
We're almost there.

3378
03:13:09,800 --> 03:13:11,800
We're going to kill that anyone.

3379
03:13:11,800 --> 03:13:16,800
And one by one they'll dissipate the enemy.

3380
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:19,800
There's a somber behind us.

3381
03:13:19,800 --> 03:13:20,800
Huzzah!

3382
03:13:20,800 --> 03:13:21,800
Huzzah!

3383
03:13:21,800 --> 03:13:22,800
Doomfist!

3384
03:13:22,800 --> 03:13:25,800
Get the tank off the fucking point!

3385
03:13:26,800 --> 03:13:27,800
Get that motherfucker!

3386
03:13:29,800 --> 03:13:30,800
Oh!

3387
03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:31,800
Oh, hold on.

3388
03:13:31,800 --> 03:13:32,800
Let me get the point.

3389
03:13:32,800 --> 03:13:33,800
Oh, sorry.

3390
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:34,800
Okay.

3391
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:35,800
Gorgeous.

3392
03:13:35,800 --> 03:13:39,800
I'm going to need to get some oxygen back in because I'm starting to get lightheaded.

3393
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:40,800
The boot alert.

3394
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:43,800
I'm so bad you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside of it.

3395
03:13:43,800 --> 03:13:48,800
I'm so dumb I could not tip water out of a boot if the instructions were written on the soles.

3396
03:13:49,800 --> 03:13:50,800
Hold on.

3397
03:13:51,800 --> 03:13:52,800
That was...

3398
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:53,800
No!

3399
03:13:53,800 --> 03:13:54,800
No!

3400
03:13:54,800 --> 03:13:55,800
Wrong sound effect!

3401
03:13:55,800 --> 03:13:57,800
It's supposed to be clapping because it was good.

3402
03:13:57,800 --> 03:14:00,800
You're intoxicity has inspired me.

3403
03:14:00,800 --> 03:14:01,800
I'm redamling.

3404
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:02,800
Exactly.

3405
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:03,800
Okay.

3406
03:14:03,800 --> 03:14:04,800
Oh!

3407
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:05,800
It's going to ult right there.

3408
03:14:05,800 --> 03:14:06,800
Oh my God!

3409
03:14:06,800 --> 03:14:07,800
You cheeky fucking cow!

3410
03:14:07,800 --> 03:14:08,800
You absolute...

3411
03:14:08,800 --> 03:14:09,800
Oh!

3412
03:14:09,800 --> 03:14:10,800
Oh!

3413
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:12,800
What can I say to insult her?

3414
03:14:12,800 --> 03:14:15,800
What can I say to insult Sombra?

3415
03:14:15,800 --> 03:14:16,800
You...

3416
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:18,800
You're...

3417
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:19,800
You're...

3418
03:14:19,800 --> 03:14:20,800
You're so invisible.

3419
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:21,800
Mmm.

3420
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:22,800
That's right.

3421
03:14:22,800 --> 03:14:23,800
I sure showed you.

3422
03:14:23,800 --> 03:14:24,800
I showed you.

3423
03:14:24,800 --> 03:14:25,800
That's right.

3424
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:27,800
Okay.

3425
03:14:27,800 --> 03:14:29,800
You're going to play Marvel Rivals?

3426
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:30,800
I think we're going to play it together.

3427
03:14:30,800 --> 03:14:34,800
I don't know when it comes out but the beta got like really well done.

3428
03:14:34,800 --> 03:14:36,800
They used the old reliable.

3429
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:37,800
Where's the point?

3430
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:38,800
Oh!

3431
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:39,800
It's here.

3432
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:40,800
Oh my God!

3433
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:41,800
I was not paying attention.

3434
03:14:41,800 --> 03:14:42,800
Tee hee!

3435
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:43,800
Right.

3436
03:14:43,800 --> 03:14:44,800
Are you ready?

3437
03:14:44,800 --> 03:14:45,800
I'm going to jump scare them.

3438
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:46,800
She perroed!

3439
03:14:46,800 --> 03:14:48,800
I knew that was coming!

3440
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:49,800
Okay.

3441
03:14:49,800 --> 03:14:50,800
There's two of them.

3442
03:14:50,800 --> 03:14:51,800
Okay.

3443
03:14:51,800 --> 03:14:52,800
They're kind of on point.

3444
03:14:52,800 --> 03:14:53,800
I'll weave it.

3445
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:54,800
But she perroed into that.

3446
03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:55,800
That was funny.

3447
03:14:55,800 --> 03:14:56,800
Right.

3448
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:57,800
Sorry Sombra.

3449
03:14:57,800 --> 03:14:58,800
You're going to first.

3450
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,800
I actually hate you.

3451
03:14:59,800 --> 03:15:00,800
Yes!

3452
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:01,800
Yeah.

3453
03:15:01,800 --> 03:15:02,800
I literally cannot stand you.

3454
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:03,800
I cannot stand you!

3455
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:04,800
HACK SOMEONE ELSE!

3456
03:15:04,800 --> 03:15:05,800
Because it's not me!

3457
03:15:05,800 --> 03:15:06,800
I have a firewall!

3458
03:15:06,800 --> 03:15:11,800
And I have a pie hole too which I highly recommend.

3459
03:15:11,800 --> 03:15:12,800
Oh!

3460
03:15:12,800 --> 03:15:13,800
So good.

3461
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:14,800
Right.

3462
03:15:14,800 --> 03:15:18,800
Let me readjust the shirt.

3463
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:19,800
Right.

3464
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:20,800
Wait no.

3465
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:21,800
I got play of the game.

3466
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:22,800
Let's see it.

3467
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:23,800
Give me play of the game.

3468
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:24,800
I know.

3469
03:15:24,800 --> 03:15:25,800
Show me what I want to see.

3470
03:15:25,800 --> 03:15:26,800
Replay!

3471
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:31,800
You took my fucking play of the game!

3472
03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:32,800
Also me.

3473
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:34,800
Why is my voice so sore tomorrow?

3474
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:41,800
I don't know why my voice is so sore.

3475
03:15:41,800 --> 03:15:42,800
You.

3476
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:44,800
You only won our wording.

3477
03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:45,800
GG.

3478
03:15:45,800 --> 03:15:46,800
G.

3479
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:48,800
We're actually so...

3480
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:49,800
Oh my god.

3481
03:15:49,800 --> 03:15:50,800
I'm almost live.

3482
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:51,800
Not to brag but I'm almost level 4.

3483
03:15:51,800 --> 03:15:52,800
Right.

3484
03:15:52,800 --> 03:15:56,800
Let me take off my clothes because I'm a swan.

3485
03:15:56,800 --> 03:16:00,800
If anyone would like to lick up my belly sweat you're more than welcome to.

3486
03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:03,800
It's also in my inner thighs pretty badly.

3487
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:06,800
There's much more comfortable to do than that.

3488
03:16:06,800 --> 03:16:08,800
That's much more like it.

3489
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:10,800
Headset back on.

3490
03:16:10,800 --> 03:16:14,800
Let's get our team together ladies and gentlemen.

3491
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:15,800
Oh!

3492
03:16:15,800 --> 03:16:18,800
Time to be symmetrical.

3493
03:16:18,800 --> 03:16:19,800
All right.

3494
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:22,800
I'm playing symmetrical next game.

3495
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:26,800
And thank you for backing out everyone because it makes us go a lot faster.

3496
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:28,800
Who goes there?

3497
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:30,800
You must have wondered.

3498
03:16:30,800 --> 03:16:31,800
Right.

3499
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:34,800
Hasn't had a shot next.

3500
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:39,800
Chair have not sat on your face.

3501
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:43,800
DC packed.

3502
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:44,800
Did I?

3503
03:16:44,800 --> 03:16:46,800
Did I write your face?

3504
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:50,800
You should play pro league baseball with how well you throw.

3505
03:16:50,800 --> 03:16:52,800
That's rude.

3506
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:53,800
I know.

3507
03:16:53,800 --> 03:16:55,800
Are you squidding me right now?

3508
03:16:55,800 --> 03:16:57,800
You fucking bitch.

3509
03:16:57,800 --> 03:16:59,800
When is the good game playing in the start?

3510
03:16:59,800 --> 03:17:01,800
You fucking arsehole.

3511
03:17:01,800 --> 03:17:04,800
We've been rolling and smoking and on.

3512
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:08,800
You little motherfucker.

3513
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:11,800
You little bitch.

3514
03:17:11,800 --> 03:17:13,800
I'm doomed.

3515
03:17:13,800 --> 03:17:14,800
I'm doomed.

3516
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:16,800
Has d-pack had a chance?

3517
03:17:16,800 --> 03:17:18,800
DC packed.

3518
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:20,800
I don't remember writing that out.

3519
03:17:22,800 --> 03:17:25,800
I'm checking the notes.

3520
03:17:25,800 --> 03:17:27,800
I don't think you've had a chance.

3521
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:28,800
No.

3522
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:30,800
But you're in a game.

3523
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,800
I can't invite you while you're in a game.

3524
03:17:32,800 --> 03:17:37,800
Has these notes played?

3525
03:17:37,800 --> 03:17:39,800
These notes.

3526
03:17:39,800 --> 03:17:41,800
These notes.

3527
03:17:41,800 --> 03:17:43,800
These notes.

3528
03:17:43,800 --> 03:17:49,800
I must have wondered where have them been.

3529
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:51,800
Frosty feet.

3530
03:17:51,800 --> 03:17:53,800
You've not had a shot.

3531
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:56,800
I'm going to kill myself.

3532
03:17:56,800 --> 03:17:57,800
Bye.

3533
03:17:57,800 --> 03:17:59,800
Real good game.

3534
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:02,800
What the fuck?

3535
03:18:05,800 --> 03:18:06,800
Right.

3536
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:07,800
One shot myself.

3537
03:18:07,800 --> 03:18:08,800
Didn't expect that.

3538
03:18:08,800 --> 03:18:10,800
We're going to be called team shot myself.

3539
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:13,800
Because I did not expect the fucking voice comms.

3540
03:18:15,800 --> 03:18:16,800
Right.

3541
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:18,800
Right next.

3542
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:20,800
I'm playing Symmetra.

3543
03:18:20,800 --> 03:18:22,800
Because I just unlocked Symmetra.

3544
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:24,800
So you guys can squabble between yourselves.

3545
03:18:24,800 --> 03:18:26,800
I was struggling so hard to pay on 300 ping.

3546
03:18:26,800 --> 03:18:28,800
Was that on my server?

3547
03:18:28,800 --> 03:18:30,800
No, that wasn't on my server.

3548
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:32,800
Did somebody send board you?

3549
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:34,800
No, that was a replay.

3550
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:35,800
Oh, my shirt.

3551
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:36,800
I need to fix my shirt.

3552
03:18:36,800 --> 03:18:37,800
Hold on.

3553
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:38,800
No.

3554
03:18:38,800 --> 03:18:39,800
Oh, it's stuck.

3555
03:18:39,800 --> 03:18:41,800
Why is this?

3556
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,800
Hold on.

3557
03:18:42,800 --> 03:18:44,800
I need to, like, re-add it.

3558
03:18:44,800 --> 03:18:46,800
Okay.

3559
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:47,800
Hold on.

3560
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:48,800
Hold on.

3561
03:18:48,800 --> 03:18:50,800
I have the PNG of the shirt.

3562
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:51,800
No.

3563
03:18:51,800 --> 03:18:52,800
Wait, what?

3564
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:53,800
What is it?

3565
03:18:53,800 --> 03:18:54,800
I just downloaded it.

3566
03:18:54,800 --> 03:18:55,800
Okay, there you are.

3567
03:18:58,800 --> 03:18:59,800
Right.

3568
03:18:59,800 --> 03:19:00,800
If I look straight.

3569
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:01,800
Oh, ignore my funny.

3570
03:19:01,800 --> 03:19:03,800
If I look straight and then I pin it.

3571
03:19:03,800 --> 03:19:05,800
Like this.

3572
03:19:05,800 --> 03:19:06,800
I'm looking.

3573
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:08,800
Well, my model's looking straight.

3574
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:09,800
I'm going to pin it.

3575
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:10,800
Right.

3576
03:19:10,800 --> 03:19:11,800
Okay.

3577
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:13,800
I don't even need to pin it.

3578
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:14,800
It's so perfect.

3579
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:17,800
It's so, it's so good.

3580
03:19:18,800 --> 03:19:19,800
Okay.

3581
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:20,800
Oh, fuck.

3582
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:21,800
Okay.

3583
03:19:21,800 --> 03:19:23,800
I just need to look dead ahead.

3584
03:19:23,800 --> 03:19:24,800
Okay.

3585
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:26,800
I'm not tilting my head at all.

3586
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:28,800
Broly legend.

3587
03:19:28,800 --> 03:19:30,800
Thank you for the super chat.

3588
03:19:30,800 --> 03:19:31,800
The booty lord.

3589
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:32,800
Thank you for the super chat.

3590
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:33,800
Count quispy.

3591
03:19:33,800 --> 03:19:36,800
You couldn't hit water if it fell out of a bowl.

3592
03:19:36,800 --> 03:19:37,800
If it fell...

3593
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:38,800
If you...

3594
03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:39,800
Oh!

3595
03:19:39,800 --> 03:19:40,800
I misread it.

3596
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:41,800
Sorry.

3597
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:42,800
Count quispy.

3598
03:19:42,800 --> 03:19:43,800
Let me try that again.

3599
03:19:43,800 --> 03:19:46,800
You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a bowl.

3600
03:19:46,800 --> 03:19:48,800
Because I'm hydrophobic.

3601
03:19:48,800 --> 03:19:50,800
Most fishes are actually.

3602
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:52,800
I think that's how...

3603
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:54,800
Because there's something about fishes.

3604
03:19:54,800 --> 03:19:56,800
They have like a swim bladder as well.

3605
03:19:56,800 --> 03:20:00,800
That like kills them if they go upside down or something.

3606
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:02,800
I had to work for that one.

3607
03:20:02,800 --> 03:20:04,800
I'm so sorry.

3608
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:05,800
For legal reasons.

3609
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:06,800
Ronnie's wearing running shorts.

3610
03:20:06,800 --> 03:20:08,800
Like what marathon runners wear?

3611
03:20:08,800 --> 03:20:09,800
I never even thought about that.

3612
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:10,800
Oh my God.

3613
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:12,800
Marathon short runner cosplay when?

3614
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:13,800
Right now?

3615
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:17,800
Did you know that having a brain can cause...

3616
03:20:17,800 --> 03:20:18,800
Brain cancer?

3617
03:20:18,800 --> 03:20:19,800
Thank...

3618
03:20:19,800 --> 03:20:22,800
Thank God you guys are safe.

3619
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:23,800
Oh my God.

3620
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:26,800
I really like to even say that one.

3621
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:28,800
I'm coming right now.

3622
03:20:28,800 --> 03:20:30,800
I'm a grade A trash talker.

3623
03:20:30,800 --> 03:20:32,800
I was raised on COD lobbies.

3624
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:33,800
Yeah.

3625
03:20:33,800 --> 03:20:36,800
What do you know about MW21V1 on Rust?

3626
03:20:36,800 --> 03:20:37,800
Oh!

3627
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:38,800
Everyone says that was such a good map.

3628
03:20:38,800 --> 03:20:40,800
But I don't remember much of it.

3629
03:20:40,800 --> 03:20:43,800
Maybe I can 1v1 these on Rust as well.

3630
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:45,800
Because we're going to 1v1 on Ches later I think.

3631
03:20:45,800 --> 03:20:47,800
If I'm up for it later in the week.

3632
03:20:47,800 --> 03:20:49,800
I might have to delay it yet again.

3633
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:50,800
Who did I...

3634
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:51,800
Symmetra.

3635
03:20:51,800 --> 03:20:53,800
This is going to be the worst freaking map for her.

3636
03:20:53,800 --> 03:20:54,800
I can just tell.

3637
03:20:57,800 --> 03:20:58,800
We build anew.

3638
03:20:58,800 --> 03:20:59,800
Oh!

3639
03:20:59,800 --> 03:21:00,800
It's a Christmas fashion.

3640
03:21:00,800 --> 03:21:01,800
Right.

3641
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:02,800
What are the fits?

3642
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:03,800
Fit check.

3643
03:21:03,800 --> 03:21:04,800
Fit check.

3644
03:21:04,800 --> 03:21:05,800
What we got?

3645
03:21:05,800 --> 03:21:06,800
We've got a summer beach.

3646
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:07,800
Right.

3647
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:08,800
We've got default mercy too.

3648
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:09,800
We've got Juno default.

3649
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:11,800
She probably doesn't have enough skins out.

3650
03:21:11,800 --> 03:21:12,800
Right.

3651
03:21:12,800 --> 03:21:13,800
Oh!

3652
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:14,800
She's got like a...

3653
03:21:14,800 --> 03:21:15,800
Really...

3654
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:16,800
Oh my gosh.

3655
03:21:16,800 --> 03:21:19,800
I would like one Tuck Pokey.

3656
03:21:19,800 --> 03:21:21,800
I've never played this map before.

3657
03:21:21,800 --> 03:21:23,800
It's up to you guys to carry me.

3658
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:24,800
I know it's just...

3659
03:21:24,800 --> 03:21:25,800
It's remade Hanamura.

3660
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:28,800
But I don't know why they didn't just...

3661
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:29,800
I'm sure.

3662
03:21:29,800 --> 03:21:30,800
And now I'm cold.

3663
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:31,800
That I've taken my clothes off.

3664
03:21:31,800 --> 03:21:32,800
I can't believe it.

3665
03:21:32,800 --> 03:21:33,800
How does this work?

3666
03:21:33,800 --> 03:21:34,800
Oh!

3667
03:21:34,800 --> 03:21:35,800
I could have put a teleport down.

3668
03:21:35,800 --> 03:21:36,800
Sorry!

3669
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:38,800
Alright.

3670
03:21:38,800 --> 03:21:40,800
I'm going to put one there.

3671
03:21:40,800 --> 03:21:42,800
And here.

3672
03:21:42,800 --> 03:21:46,800
Basically, I just want to catch them off if they go too far.

3673
03:21:46,800 --> 03:21:51,800
Because you want to make it annoying to turn around and hit you.

3674
03:21:51,800 --> 03:21:54,800
Like you want to be an annoyance.

3675
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,800
So...

3676
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:00,800
Oh!

3677
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:02,800
You can't hold it for as long as you want.

3678
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:03,800
Curious.

3679
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:05,800
Oh!

3680
03:22:05,800 --> 03:22:08,800
That Ash was one HP in a dream.

3681
03:22:08,800 --> 03:22:10,800
So now that we have point,

3682
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:13,800
I am going to push up with my turrets.

3683
03:22:13,800 --> 03:22:16,800
So if they dare to come around the corner,

3684
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:18,800
they get creamed on by my turrets.

3685
03:22:18,800 --> 03:22:20,800
And then that way we...

3686
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:21,800
Oh!

3687
03:22:21,800 --> 03:22:22,800
Sugar!

3688
03:22:22,800 --> 03:22:23,800
I wasn't tall enough to get the reins thing.

3689
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:24,800
Right.

3690
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:25,800
We'll do then.

3691
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:28,800
And if you didn't know on Symmetra,

3692
03:22:28,800 --> 03:22:29,800
you...

3693
03:22:29,800 --> 03:22:31,800
What is this game mode?

3694
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:32,800
Is this not capture the flag?

3695
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:34,800
Objective D?

3696
03:22:37,800 --> 03:22:38,800
I hear it.

3697
03:22:39,800 --> 03:22:40,800
Have what?

3698
03:22:42,800 --> 03:22:43,800
No.

3699
03:22:44,800 --> 03:22:46,800
Oh, well, everyone's dead.

3700
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:47,800
I'm out.

3701
03:22:47,800 --> 03:22:48,800
Bye.

3702
03:22:48,800 --> 03:22:49,800
I'll go for a cheeky kill, why not?

3703
03:22:49,800 --> 03:22:50,800
I'm so dead.

3704
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:51,800
I'm like actually so dead.

3705
03:22:51,800 --> 03:22:53,800
But with a frying pan,

3706
03:22:53,800 --> 03:22:54,800
I am so dead.

3707
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:56,800
Oh, this reins going to ram me.

3708
03:22:57,800 --> 03:22:58,800
Okay.

3709
03:22:58,800 --> 03:23:00,800
I don't know how I survived that.

3710
03:23:01,800 --> 03:23:02,800
Wait, so...

3711
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:05,800
What?

3712
03:23:05,800 --> 03:23:07,800
They're getting Objective Delta?

3713
03:23:08,800 --> 03:23:09,800
What?

3714
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:10,800
I want to use my ult and...

3715
03:23:15,800 --> 03:23:16,800
I loved him.

3716
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:19,800
He was like 9.

3717
03:23:19,800 --> 03:23:20,800
Fucking dealing with that.

3718
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:24,800
Let's get this all leveled up.

3719
03:23:25,800 --> 03:23:26,800
Okay.

3720
03:23:26,800 --> 03:23:27,800
Okay.

3721
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:31,800
So, now that we've been captured the D,

3722
03:23:31,800 --> 03:23:33,800
what happens after that?

3723
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:34,800
I don't...

3724
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:35,800
I'm not...

3725
03:23:35,800 --> 03:23:37,800
I'm not sure what happens after this.

3726
03:23:38,800 --> 03:23:39,800
Ow!

3727
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:40,800
Don't hurt me.

3728
03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:43,800
How...

3729
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:44,800
You go to B?

3730
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:47,800
I said it's to go to...

3731
03:23:47,800 --> 03:23:48,800
What is this?

3732
03:23:53,800 --> 03:23:54,800
Oh!

3733
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:55,800
I got pinned.

3734
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:58,800
Oh, dear.

3735
03:23:58,800 --> 03:23:59,800
Okay.

3736
03:23:59,800 --> 03:24:00,800
But that's okay.

3737
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:01,800
It's okay.

3738
03:24:02,800 --> 03:24:03,800
My three turrets are up,

3739
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:05,800
so hopefully they're helping my teammates.

3740
03:24:05,800 --> 03:24:06,800
Wink, wink.

3741
03:24:06,800 --> 03:24:08,800
The one turret that's just chilling out.

3742
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:10,800
Uh...

3743
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:11,800
Right.

3744
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:15,800
So, we need to stop them from capturing Echo.

3745
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:18,800
Hmm.

3746
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:21,800
This is a rather curious game mode.

3747
03:24:22,800 --> 03:24:24,800
Does it come back to Delta?

3748
03:24:27,800 --> 03:24:28,800
I don't...

3749
03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:29,800
I don't know if it happened...

3750
03:24:29,800 --> 03:24:30,800
Okay, wait.

3751
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:33,800
Oh!

3752
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:37,800
Oh!

3753
03:24:38,800 --> 03:24:39,800
How...

3754
03:24:39,800 --> 03:24:40,800
You...

3755
03:24:40,800 --> 03:24:41,800
Right.

3756
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:42,800
Just so you hate me.

3757
03:24:42,800 --> 03:24:43,800
Just so you hate me,

3758
03:24:43,800 --> 03:24:45,800
because why am I getting singled out?

3759
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:49,800
How curious.

3760
03:24:49,800 --> 03:24:51,800
You play to five points.

3761
03:24:51,800 --> 03:24:55,800
Wait, so this game could keep going back and forth for ages?

3762
03:24:56,800 --> 03:24:58,800
Because if we can't reach the end...

3763
03:24:59,800 --> 03:25:00,800
Whee!

3764
03:25:04,800 --> 03:25:05,800
Uh...

3765
03:25:05,800 --> 03:25:07,800
I don't know if happened.

3766
03:25:11,800 --> 03:25:12,800
Right.

3767
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:14,800
Fuck it, I'm going up here.

3768
03:25:14,800 --> 03:25:16,800
Right, let's see what the deal is.

3769
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:20,800
Okay.

3770
03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:21,800
Yeah, yeah.

3771
03:25:21,800 --> 03:25:22,800
I'm a big scary Symmetra.

3772
03:25:22,800 --> 03:25:23,800
Ooh!

3773
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:24,800
Ooh!

3774
03:25:24,800 --> 03:25:25,800
I'm so...

3775
03:25:26,800 --> 03:25:27,800
I can't stop dying!

3776
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:28,800
Sorry!

3777
03:25:28,800 --> 03:25:30,800
I'm being a bit of a silly Billy.

3778
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:32,800
Right.

3779
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:33,800
They're not going to capture it.

3780
03:25:33,800 --> 03:25:34,800
They're not going to come on point.

3781
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:37,800
So, we'll go to Echo now.

3782
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:42,800
I'm at the height of my performance.

3783
03:25:45,800 --> 03:25:46,800
No!

3784
03:25:47,800 --> 03:25:49,800
Well, I'm glad I survived.

3785
03:25:50,800 --> 03:25:52,800
I'm glad I have you on my side.

3786
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:54,800
So...

3787
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:56,800
Right, I'm not going in if my tank's dead.

3788
03:25:56,800 --> 03:25:57,800
So, I said it.

3789
03:25:58,800 --> 03:25:59,800
I'm not going in if my tank's dead.

3790
03:25:59,800 --> 03:26:02,800
I'm going to use my ultimate to get us in.

3791
03:26:05,800 --> 03:26:08,800
Well, I'm going to need my tank before I can move in.

3792
03:26:08,800 --> 03:26:09,800
I ain't fucking moving in.

3793
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:13,800
Sorry, I'm not expecting Hammond to dolphin dive on that point as well.

3794
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:15,800
That seems a bit ridiculous.

3795
03:26:15,800 --> 03:26:18,800
So, we go back to fighting for this one.

3796
03:26:18,800 --> 03:26:19,800
Like...

3797
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:21,800
Oh dear.

3798
03:26:21,800 --> 03:26:22,800
Oh dear.

3799
03:26:23,800 --> 03:26:24,800
Ha ha!

3800
03:26:24,800 --> 03:26:25,800
Get right by my turrets.

3801
03:26:25,800 --> 03:26:26,800
Ha ha!

3802
03:26:27,800 --> 03:26:29,800
I bet the turrets are annoying you.

3803
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:31,800
Oh yeah, that's right.

3804
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:33,800
Get lezered, get lezered.

3805
03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:34,800
Pop, pop, pop!

3806
03:26:34,800 --> 03:26:35,800
Get lezered, get lezered!

3807
03:26:37,800 --> 03:26:39,800
So, this is it.

3808
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:41,800
This is the game for the next two hours.

3809
03:26:41,800 --> 03:26:42,800
We're stun-multed.

3810
03:26:42,800 --> 03:26:43,800
Right.

3811
03:26:43,800 --> 03:26:45,800
So, we can capture Delta again.

3812
03:26:47,800 --> 03:26:49,800
So, I don't want to use my ult on this point

3813
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:51,800
because we seem to be taking...

3814
03:26:51,800 --> 03:26:52,800
Right, I take it back.

3815
03:26:52,800 --> 03:26:53,800
Sorry.

3816
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:56,800
I take it back.

3817
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:58,800
This Reign must be getting so annoyed.

3818
03:26:58,800 --> 03:27:01,800
He's like, I'm the only one that's destroying these fucking turrets.

3819
03:27:04,800 --> 03:27:05,800
I'm...

3820
03:27:05,800 --> 03:27:08,800
I don't want to friggin' nano Reign on my R-sheet.

3821
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:09,800
Right, there.

3822
03:27:09,800 --> 03:27:10,800
What?!

3823
03:27:10,800 --> 03:27:11,800
How did Zyn do that?

3824
03:27:11,800 --> 03:27:12,800
That was so good.

3825
03:27:12,800 --> 03:27:15,800
That honestly saws, but that was well played by Zyn.

3826
03:27:15,800 --> 03:27:16,800
I'm not even mad.

3827
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:17,800
Right?

3828
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:21,800
Okay.

3829
03:27:21,800 --> 03:27:22,800
Literally my first death.

3830
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:25,800
It wasn't, but I'm just gonna pretend it was my first death.

3831
03:27:25,800 --> 03:27:26,800
Right.

3832
03:27:26,800 --> 03:27:27,800
So, they're gonna capture that.

3833
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:28,800
That's fine.

3834
03:27:28,800 --> 03:27:30,800
So, they now have to come through here

3835
03:27:30,800 --> 03:27:32,800
to get this next point, right?

3836
03:27:33,800 --> 03:27:34,800
That's fine.

3837
03:27:34,800 --> 03:27:35,800
I can handle that.

3838
03:27:36,800 --> 03:27:37,800
I can handle that.

3839
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:39,800
Right.

3840
03:27:39,800 --> 03:27:40,800
Let them come.

3841
03:27:40,800 --> 03:27:41,800
Let them come.

3842
03:27:41,800 --> 03:27:42,800
Literally.

3843
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:44,800
Not like that!

3844
03:27:44,800 --> 03:27:45,800
Not like that!

3845
03:27:45,800 --> 03:27:46,800
Not like that!

3846
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:47,800
Don't...

3847
03:27:47,800 --> 03:27:50,800
She's gonna blow up my friggin' things on the side.

3848
03:27:50,800 --> 03:27:51,800
Right.

3849
03:27:51,800 --> 03:27:52,800
Do that then.

3850
03:27:52,800 --> 03:27:54,800
Oh, they can still see that turret.

3851
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:55,800
Right.

3852
03:27:55,800 --> 03:27:56,800
I'm gonna have to do it like this.

3853
03:27:56,800 --> 03:27:57,800
Right.

3854
03:27:57,800 --> 03:28:00,800
They won't let me set up on my point!

3855
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:03,800
The best I can do is this.

3856
03:28:06,800 --> 03:28:08,800
Come on, come on, come on!

3857
03:28:11,800 --> 03:28:12,800
I don't want to know, Reaper.

3858
03:28:12,800 --> 03:28:14,800
I do not want to know.

3859
03:28:14,800 --> 03:28:15,800
Oh, my God.

3860
03:28:15,800 --> 03:28:16,800
I'm so sorry.

3861
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:17,800
I'm so sorry.

3862
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:18,800
I'm doing so bad.

3863
03:28:20,800 --> 03:28:21,800
I was doing alright,

3864
03:28:21,800 --> 03:28:23,800
but I've certainly lost it.

3865
03:28:23,800 --> 03:28:24,800
I've lost Mimojo.

3866
03:28:24,800 --> 03:28:25,800
I've lost Mimojo.

3867
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:27,800
Right.

3868
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:28,800
Let me...

3869
03:28:28,800 --> 03:28:31,800
Let me entertain you.

3870
03:28:31,800 --> 03:28:32,800
Sorry.

3871
03:28:32,800 --> 03:28:33,800
I should really...

3872
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:36,800
Wait, we have to do this now?

3873
03:28:39,800 --> 03:28:40,800
Oh, no.

3874
03:28:41,800 --> 03:28:43,800
We're like the monkey

3875
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:45,800
from Planet of the Apes.

3876
03:28:45,800 --> 03:28:46,800
Oh, no.

3877
03:28:47,800 --> 03:28:48,800
We're losing.

3878
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:51,800
Okay.

3879
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:52,800
Let them...

3880
03:28:52,800 --> 03:28:54,800
I've set up my two rails.

3881
03:28:54,800 --> 03:28:56,800
I've got my wee cheeky ultimate.

3882
03:28:56,800 --> 03:28:58,800
If they want to go for me, they can.

3883
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:01,800
Because that's kind of the...

3884
03:29:01,800 --> 03:29:03,800
And then we just need...

3885
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:06,800
Oh, my God.

3886
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:08,800
We're gonna be in this game for hours.

3887
03:29:08,800 --> 03:29:10,800
I hope you're ready for the long haul.

3888
03:29:13,800 --> 03:29:14,800
Oh.

3889
03:29:17,800 --> 03:29:19,800
Oh, these are a friendly ham and thing.

3890
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:20,800
Right.

3891
03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:21,800
I'm going for the rein.

3892
03:29:22,800 --> 03:29:23,800
I'm reloading.

3893
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:25,800
I'm going for the ana.

3894
03:29:25,800 --> 03:29:26,800
No, I'm not.

3895
03:29:26,800 --> 03:29:27,800
I'm getting pinned.

3896
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:29,800
Didn't ask for it.

3897
03:29:30,800 --> 03:29:31,800
Yeah.

3898
03:29:31,800 --> 03:29:32,800
Sorry.

3899
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:34,800
I'm really letting the refunds down for this one.

3900
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:35,800
Mmm.

3901
03:29:37,800 --> 03:29:39,800
I'm letting the refunds down.

3902
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:45,800
To whoop your arm.

3903
03:29:45,800 --> 03:29:46,800
To whoop your arm.

3904
03:29:48,800 --> 03:29:50,800
I'm so sorry, refunds.

3905
03:29:51,800 --> 03:29:52,800
No, no, no.

3906
03:29:52,800 --> 03:29:53,800
Just go back.

3907
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:55,800
No.

3908
03:29:55,800 --> 03:29:56,800
I'm so...

3909
03:29:56,800 --> 03:29:57,800
I need to go someone else.

3910
03:29:57,800 --> 03:29:58,800
Sorry.

3911
03:29:58,800 --> 03:29:59,800
I need to go someone else.

3912
03:29:59,800 --> 03:30:00,800
I can't win on them.

3913
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:02,800
I can't let the refunds down.

3914
03:30:03,800 --> 03:30:04,800
Oh, no.

3915
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:05,800
We're bent to...

3916
03:30:05,800 --> 03:30:06,800
Wait.

3917
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:08,800
I just see the five tabs on the star.

3918
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:09,800
No, no, no, no.

3919
03:30:14,800 --> 03:30:15,800
Mm-hmm.

3920
03:30:24,800 --> 03:30:25,800
Oh, forgive me.

3921
03:30:25,800 --> 03:30:26,800
I threw...

3922
03:30:26,800 --> 03:30:28,800
I thought we had it.

3923
03:30:29,800 --> 03:30:31,800
I'm going to blame it on the fact I need to pee.

3924
03:30:31,800 --> 03:30:33,800
I'm so sorry, refunds.

3925
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:35,800
I'm so sorry.

3926
03:30:35,800 --> 03:30:37,800
I need to pee, so I'm going to go pee.

3927
03:30:37,800 --> 03:30:38,800
I'm going to blame it on my pee.

3928
03:30:38,800 --> 03:30:39,800
My bladder's so full.

3929
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:41,800
My bladder's so full.

3930
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:45,800
Is that a refund?

3931
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:55,800
The rain did not like me.

3932
03:30:55,800 --> 03:30:57,800
I think the rain knew that once I got set up

3933
03:30:57,800 --> 03:30:59,800
I was doing enough damage to mess them up.

3934
03:30:59,800 --> 03:31:00,800
Right.

3935
03:31:00,800 --> 03:31:01,800
Oh, my God, right.

3936
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:02,800
Change role.

3937
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:04,800
Oh, I really want to win on Sim though.

3938
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:06,800
I'm tempted to play her next game.

3939
03:31:06,800 --> 03:31:08,800
Right, I'm going to go for a very quick PPE.

3940
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:10,800
PPE and caca land.

3941
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:11,800
No, not caca.

3942
03:31:11,800 --> 03:31:12,800
Just pee.

3943
03:31:12,800 --> 03:31:14,800
I promise, just pee-pee.

3944
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:23,800
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3945
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:24,800
Hold on, hold on.

3946
03:31:24,800 --> 03:31:25,800
Pee-pee time, pee-pee time.

3947
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:26,800
I got pee-pee time.

3948
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:27,800
Please enjoy Juno in the background.

3949
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:29,800
My throat is like razor blades.

3950
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:31,800
I've been screaming far too much recently.

3951
03:31:37,800 --> 03:31:40,800
Actually, can I make a cup of tea for my throat?

3952
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:41,800
I have just realized how freaking sore it is.

3953
03:31:41,800 --> 03:31:42,800
I'm going to make a cup of tea.

3954
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:45,800
I'll be a minute, like three minutes to boil the kettle.

3955
03:31:45,800 --> 03:31:46,800
Okay, and pee.

3956
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:48,800
Everyone stretch, get up and pee, and then we'll go again.

3957
03:32:11,800 --> 03:32:12,800
Okay.

3958

4044
03:46:16,840 --> 03:46:23,000
and it goes hear me baby hold it together and for some reason every time I

4045
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:27,440
used to ink his that voice line would play in my head so I'd be inking and

4046
03:46:27,440 --> 03:46:32,640
then all I hear is hear me baby hold it together every time I inked and this

4047
03:46:32,640 --> 03:46:36,400

04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:54,640
really nice that I get to play it with you and like I think because obviously I

4222
04:05:54,640 --> 04:05:58,800
have old knowledge of the game so it's not like I'm confused playing it or I'm

4223
04:05:58,800 --> 04:06:03,120
like oh like I know I don't understand the new heroes that well or the maps but

like at the end of the day I got them a core mechanics you know that's the main

4225
04:06:07,280 --> 04:06:14,880
thing and like it's just nice to have familiarity and playing like it feels

04:08:23,120 --> 04:08:26,440

4250
04:09:03,600 --> 04:09:09,000

4251
04:09:09,000 --> 04:09:18,320
right get ready to move out okay at least okay no no no this is really good

4252
04:09:18,320 --> 04:09:23,360
for me in particular because I have a lot of twists that I can do this stuff

4253
04:09:23,360 --> 04:09:26,600
and like annoy them with oh my god rematch or just say you love me just

4254
04:09:26,600 --> 04:09:33,960
so you want to make out with me okay this is good it's good that we're in the

4255
04:09:33,960 --> 04:09:38,520
section of the map because once I lay down my turret it is very awkward to

4256
04:09:38,520 --> 04:09:48,340
kill them as I take a chug of tea harassing is a strong job exactly we

4257
04:09:48,340 --> 04:09:52,880
need to put the turrets in locations where they have to essentially do a u-turn

4258
04:09:52,880 --> 04:09:57,960
so if the payload gets pushed up not big deal I've always wanted to play this

4259
04:09:57,960 --> 04:10:03,160
game my body keeps telling me no the reason why I can't say yeah but I kept

05:12:43,560 --> 05:12:48,800
is this what I'm supposed to do I don't I don't know what I'm doing I'm going I

4775
05:12:48,920 --> 05:13:01,240
don't know I'm going I'm going out over I think I did okay normally when I see a

4776
05:13:01,240 --> 05:13:04,520
play of the game from a Genji he's doing a lot more like dashing in the air

4777
05:13:04,520 --> 05:13:08,920
maybe that's what I was supposed to do in that instance that could have gone

4778
05:13:08,920 --> 05:13:16,040
worse but it didn't that's what's to focus on that could have gone terribly

4779
05:13:16,080 --> 05:13:25,000
wrong what's your name bob so they calling you Bob stop playing you know that

4780
05:13:25,000 --> 05:13:30,080
I'm known for the Bob okay I'm gonna just let my team do everything your dash

4781
05:13:30,080 --> 05:13:34,040
resets when you get killed ah that makes sense why they're always like jumping

4782
05:13:34,040 --> 05:13:41,120
about the map jump up jump up and get down I hear footsteps and they ain't

4783
05:13:41,120 --> 05:13:53,040
friends oh I'm scared I'm scared oh no wait why would you get Winston I'm not

4784
05:13:53,040 --> 05:13:59,040
good no I can't tell the Winston he's gonna kill my mercy you thought I can't

4785
05:13:59,040 --> 05:14:05,680
oh my god did they increase Winston's attack that feels so quick oh no he

4786
05:14:05,720 --> 05:14:11,720
damaged me from the job I don't know I'm trying to get there fast enough but

4787
05:14:11,720 --> 05:14:18,520
I'm too slow and double jumping we have no ults either right okay we'll take the

4788
05:14:18,520 --> 05:14:28,600
L on this one but but we'll be okay there is a Winnie Winnie the poo

4789
05:14:29,480 --> 05:14:41,920
oh that was an accident well it wasn't an accident I tried oh that's another

4790
05:14:41,920 --> 05:14:45,400
overwatch thing you know that voiceline you just heard he where he goes the

4791
05:14:45,400 --> 05:14:49,600
advantage is mine because of his accent I had no idea what he's saying and I

4792
05:14:49,600 --> 05:14:53,920
thought he says the adabanteum is mine and I was like I don't know what adabanteum

4793
05:14:53,920 --> 05:14:58,440
is it must be the currency inside the overwatch or something because yeah I

4794
05:14:58,440 --> 05:15:02,720
was too daft to even have a clue what it meant it was him saying the word

4795
05:15:02,720 --> 05:15:08,400
advantage and I'm I'm rather slow and the reason why I didn't know what he was

4796
05:15:08,400 --> 05:15:12,080
saying is because they didn't have subtitles for eons they did not have

4797
05:15:12,080 --> 05:15:15,960
subtitles and overwatch and they added it and then I could finally read what

4798
05:15:15,960 --> 05:15:20,160
they were saying I don't know what it's called when you can like never

4799
05:15:20,200 --> 05:15:26,520
understand what's being oh god oh that Winston bubble just saved her I don't

4849
05:22:20,240 --> 05:22:28,880
and then I'm gonna pitch us against each other and I'm gonna be in one of the teams so obviously

4850
05:22:28,880 --> 05:22:36,640
you have a chance to destroy me in game you're welcome don't worry we'll win I'm lying

4851
05:22:37,520 --> 05:22:40,480
oh so thanks to our tank that range you really held the lane for us

4852
05:22:42,640 --> 05:22:52,800
what as Genji are you trolling I didn't I did not do good as Genji Genji's very squishy but

4853
05:22:52,800 --> 05:23:02,320
faster than agile yeah I'm more of a dwarf build myself mummy's feeding like we say winning

4854
05:23:13,840 --> 05:23:19,600
we can listen to music without well playing games together it takes some setup

4855
05:23:22,960 --> 05:23:23,600
um

4856
05:23:29,040 --> 05:23:34,720
if I make a twitch again and add a bubble bolt we can listen to music together apparently when

4857
05:23:34,720 --> 05:23:43,520
we game oh and you guys can add what you want to hear oh my god yeah because it would be set for

4858
05:23:44,080 --> 05:23:45,520
hmm

4859
05:23:49,200 --> 05:23:50,240
I see I see

4860
05:23:54,240 --> 05:23:56,160
that that wouldn't go in there

4861
05:24:00,080 --> 05:24:04,720
I think that would work out yeah we definitely try that we're on a roll we couldn't try that

4862
05:24:04,720 --> 05:24:11,600
watch together maybe watch together would be a bit easier and then I'll get you guys to submit

4863
05:24:11,600 --> 05:24:17,840
your songs and then I'll make sure my audio is separate but obviously I'm gonna do karaoke I mean

5083
05:52:07,940 --> 05:52:15,460
wind in okay tracer's gonna see me she's gonna see how juicy I was looking what

5084
05:52:15,460 --> 05:52:23,100
tracer and a Winston rather diving that quite the diving oh I'm gonna stay I'm

5085
05:52:23,100 --> 05:52:26,540
gonna stay but I can't go with the tank at this moment in time because of this

5086
05:52:26,540 --> 05:52:32,940
tracer she's gonna tracer might try and dash over to me to get the kill on me

5087
05:52:32,940 --> 05:52:39,500
it's very plausible yeah she's really I'm in a rather difficult position I need

5088
05:52:39,500 --> 05:52:46,420
to get out of this position that's what she said I'm needing I'm needing to be

5089
05:52:46,420 --> 05:52:54,380
with a reefland I can yeah yeah not she's coming I need to fucking be

5090
05:52:54,380 --> 05:53:00,420
preemptive oh that's so unfortunate I'm sorry I'm sorry that was my

5091
05:53:00,420 --> 05:53:07,820
positioning that was my positioning oh what happens is I kept dragging the

5092
05:53:07,820 --> 05:53:11,660
tracer with me in the Winston at one point was also trying to get on me I

5093
05:53:11,660 --> 05:53:17,660
kept dragging them like so when my teammate scatter when the reefland

5094
05:53:17,660 --> 05:53:25,220
scatter it actually helps out immensely because yeah because it means I

5095
05:53:25,220 --> 05:53:29,820
can I can ping about the map I can jump yop yop yop yop but the problem is I

5096
05:53:29,820 --> 05:53:40,020
just can't eat whoopsie who is that who is that not I know you're gonna be putting

5097
05:53:40,020 --> 05:53:49,220
up unique situation I mean we just need to win a fight and not push it any

5098
05:53:49,220 --> 05:53:55,340
further and we'll win do you know what I mean oh my god I just floated over that

5137
05:58:44,820 --> 05:58:49,380
so nervous when I said it cuz I was getting memed on and I genuinely thought

5138
05:58:49,380 --> 05:58:56,620
and I genuinely thought it two hours until an Emmy stream always any I thought

5141
05:59:12,300 --> 05:59:22,060
trolling me thank you for the revised did I heal you in game I was gonna say I

5142
05:59:22,060 --> 05:59:26,140
thought I was the only one that had a story to do but yeah I was worried

5143
05:59:26,140 --> 05:59:28,780
cuz when I said I wanted to play overwatch because then you're always

5144
05:59:28,780 --> 05:59:33,620
like oh no I'm gonna show up and play I've been proven wrong but I got plopped

5145
05:59:33,620 --> 05:59:39,660
with love pop pop pop pop pop I've been plopped so hard

5146
05:59:43,620 --> 05:59:47,860
that's right overwatch is fun you better the minute you better confess that you

5147
05:59:47,860 --> 05:59:52,660
judged the game too harshly games I think that's probably one of the major

5148
05:59:52,700 --> 05:59:58,140
factors if you find yourself tired of multiplayer games in particular I think

5149
05:59:58,140 --> 06:00:04,300
it is now you're not to blame or anything for this factor but if you have

5150
06:00:04,300 --> 06:00:09,380
someone you can connect with on that game that makes the world of difference

5151
06:00:09,380 --> 06:00:14,660
for the multiplayer experience like I was fucking screaming and I mean I think

5152
06:00:14,660 --> 06:00:19,180
I'm still partly screaming through my games I just I'm so excited I'm so much

5153
06:00:19,220 --> 06:00:24,300
fun playing with you like it makes the world of difference to play the game

5154
06:00:24,300 --> 06:00:28,620
that's multiplayer experience you know when we lose the game I'm not like oh my

5155

5158
06:00:43,940 --> 06:00:51,620

5746
07:17:53,680 --> 07:18:00,680
Really annoying. Annoyingly cute. Annoyingly submissive.

Drinking my peach tea before work. I'm drinking my skinny can of spray. Full sugar.

07:19:07,680 --> 07:19:11,680
It's so funny watching you react to changes in Overwatch 2.

5759
07:19:11,680 --> 07:19:16,680
It's nice to see how evil powers in you find out something new.

5760
07:19:16,680 --> 07:19:24,680
Thank you Alan for this review. Yes! The heroes I'm not, I'm not even played Malg.

5761
07:19:24,680 --> 07:19:31,680
Whatever his name is. This one. Where are you?

5762
07:19:31,680 --> 07:19:37,680
I think I might have played Junker Coon.

5763
07:19:37,680 --> 07:19:43,680
I definitely have not played him though, not played him.

5764
07:19:43,680 --> 07:19:49,680
I don't know, obviously I played it custom with you. Venture, she's new as well.

5765
07:19:49,680 --> 07:19:53,680
Sojourn, I think I've been Sojourn and then Junker Queen.

5766
07:19:53,680 --> 07:19:59,680
But when Sojourn came out I was already limping off of the game.

5767
07:19:59,680 --> 07:20:05,680
Alari, I don't really recall you too much darling.

5768
07:20:05,680 --> 07:20:11,680
Life? He wasn't in the base game, I can tell you that much.

5769
07:20:11,680 --> 07:20:13,680
He wasn't in the base.

5770
07:20:13,680 --> 07:20:17,680
Rematron, I do remember when he came out because he was like,

5771
07:20:17,680 --> 07:20:21,680
Oh my god Rematron! He looks like Zenyatta!

5772
07:20:21,680 --> 07:20:25,680
Oh my gosh! And he's like the good monk and he's like a bad monk.

5773
07:20:25,680 --> 07:20:30,680
Basically. So Mo is Dutch by the way, always have fun.

5774
07:20:31,680 --> 07:20:35,680
He really be like...

5775
07:20:35,680 --> 07:20:40,680
That's how he picks up the leaves.

5776
07:20:40,680 --> 07:20:45,680
I really don't like Venture, they make me not just looking at them, they're so specific.

5777
07:20:45,680 --> 07:20:50,680
They added a guy called Sigma, yeah this is the only Sigma I know.

5778
07:20:50,680 --> 07:20:53,680
Wait, let's listen to his voice lines.

5779
07:20:56,680 --> 07:20:59,680
I truly hate that voice line.

5780
07:21:01,680 --> 07:21:04,680
Is he not going to Dutch?

5781
07:21:09,680 --> 07:21:12,680
Who would pay for this?

5782
07:21:16,680 --> 07:21:21,680
It's better to pee in the sink to sink in the pee, amen Sigma.

5783
07:21:24,680 --> 07:21:27,680
Neil?

5784
07:21:27,680 --> 07:21:31,680
Oh, I thought it was going to be a bit more like...

5785
07:21:31,680 --> 07:21:33,680
You know him? But it's just Neil.

5786
07:21:33,680 --> 07:21:35,680
You are my starlight.

5787
07:21:35,680 --> 07:21:38,680
You are my starlight.

5788
07:21:38,680 --> 07:21:43,680
You are my starlight, my only starlight.

5789
07:21:43,680 --> 07:21:47,680
You keep on shining when the sun's early.

5790
07:21:47,680 --> 07:21:49,680
Sorry my voice is fucking stuffed.

5791
07:21:49,680 --> 07:21:51,680
Is there no Netherlands?

5792
07:21:51,680 --> 07:21:53,680
Can you ask me to ex...

5793
07:21:53,680 --> 07:21:55,680
Frohle kerstfeest.

5794
07:21:55,680 --> 07:21:57,680
What?

5795
07:21:57,680 --> 07:21:59,680
Frohle kerstfeest.

5796
07:21:59,680 --> 07:22:01,680
Frohle kerstfeest, or what?

5797
07:22:01,680 --> 07:22:03,680
Feine kerstdagen.

5798
07:22:03,680 --> 07:22:06,680
Feine kerstvaarten, what?

5799
07:22:06,680 --> 07:22:08,680
Feine kerstdagen.

5800
07:22:08,680 --> 07:22:10,680
Feine kerstdagen.

5801
07:22:10,680 --> 07:22:12,680
Glorious.

5802
07:22:12,680 --> 07:22:14,680
Many find the universe.

5803
07:22:14,680 --> 07:22:15,680
Do me a normal, eh?

5804
07:22:15,680 --> 07:22:17,680
And then you'll do me crazy enough.

5805
07:22:17,680 --> 07:22:19,680
Do you do me crazy enough?

5806
07:22:19,680 --> 07:22:21,680
Do you do me normal?

5807
07:22:21,680 --> 07:22:23,680
No.

5808
07:22:23,680 --> 07:22:24,680
What?

5809
07:22:24,680 --> 07:22:25,680
Do me normal, eh?

5810
07:22:25,680 --> 07:22:27,680
And then you'll do me crazy enough.

5811
07:22:27,680 --> 07:22:29,680
I can't do that one.

5812
07:22:29,680 --> 07:22:32,680
Who lives on his head, has to stay out of the sun.

5813
07:22:32,680 --> 07:22:35,680
Who lives on his head, has to stay out of the sun.

5814
07:22:35,680 --> 07:22:36,680
What?

5815
07:22:36,680 --> 07:22:39,680
Who lives on his head, has to stay out of the sun.

5816
07:22:39,680 --> 07:22:41,680
Stay out of the sun.

5817
07:22:41,680 --> 07:22:42,680
Close your eyes.

5818
07:22:42,680 --> 07:22:43,680
I know it!

5819
07:22:43,680 --> 07:22:45,680
Yeah, I knew this one.

5820
07:22:45,680 --> 07:22:46,680
I've got it.

5821
07:22:46,680 --> 07:22:48,680
Ah, he conveyed it.

5822
07:22:48,680 --> 07:22:50,680
Ah, he conveyed it.

5823
07:22:50,680 --> 07:22:53,680
Wait, what's to the Spanish ones?

5824
07:22:53,680 --> 07:22:55,680
Sombra.

5825
07:22:55,680 --> 07:22:56,680
Your turn.

5826
07:22:56,680 --> 07:22:57,680
Give us some Spanish.

5827
07:22:57,680 --> 07:22:59,680
Where's the fun in playing fair?

5828
07:22:59,680 --> 07:23:00,680
Who wants to buy?

5829
07:23:00,680 --> 07:23:02,680
Feliz Navidad.

5830
07:23:02,680 --> 07:23:04,680
Feliz Navidad.

5831
07:23:04,680 --> 07:23:06,680
I know who's been naughty.

5832
07:23:06,680 --> 07:23:09,680
I know who's inked without permission.

5833
07:23:09,680 --> 07:23:11,680
Same voiceline.

5834
07:23:11,680 --> 07:23:13,680
I can be nice.

5835
07:23:13,680 --> 07:23:15,680
What's up, Pex?

5836
07:23:15,680 --> 07:23:18,680
What's up, Pex?

5837
07:23:18,680 --> 07:23:20,680
Try and keep up.

5838
07:23:20,680 --> 07:23:21,680
I've got some sun.

5839
07:23:21,680 --> 07:23:23,680
You're taking these berries.

5840
07:23:23,680 --> 07:23:25,680
Assusta me pantheon.

5841
07:23:25,680 --> 07:23:28,680
Assusta me pantheon.

5842
07:23:28,680 --> 07:23:30,680
Assusta me pantheon.

5843
07:23:30,680 --> 07:23:32,680
Assusta me pantheon.

5844
07:23:32,680 --> 07:23:34,680
Ah.

5845
07:23:34,680 --> 07:23:36,680
Mess with the best and die like the red.

5846
07:23:36,680 --> 07:23:38,680
You're squishing a bug.

5847
07:23:38,680 --> 07:23:41,680
I think you're in over your...

5848
07:23:41,680 --> 07:23:44,680
All the information you have to pay.

5849
07:23:44,680 --> 07:23:46,680
Good one.

5850
07:23:46,680 --> 07:23:47,680
Good one.

5851
07:23:47,680 --> 07:23:49,680
You're just like...

5852
07:23:49,680 --> 07:23:51,680
De pelos.

5853
07:23:51,680 --> 07:23:53,680
Oh, it sounds like she's saying de pelos.

5854
07:23:53,680 --> 07:23:54,680
De pelos?

5855
07:23:54,680 --> 07:23:56,680
De pelos.

5856
07:23:56,680 --> 07:23:58,680
Mmm, muy bien.

5857
07:23:58,680 --> 07:24:00,680
De pelos.

5858
07:24:00,680 --> 07:24:01,680
Mmm, sí, sí.

5859
07:24:01,680 --> 07:24:02,680
I'm so bilingual.

5860
07:24:02,680 --> 07:24:03,680
Tri-lingual.

5861
07:24:03,680 --> 07:24:04,680
Quad-lingual.

5862
07:24:04,680 --> 07:24:05,680
Quintertingual.

5863
07:24:05,680 --> 07:24:07,680
I tried.

5864
07:24:07,680 --> 07:24:10,680
Who else speaks a lingual that you guys know?

5865
07:24:11,680 --> 07:24:12,680
German?

5866
07:24:12,680 --> 07:24:13,680
German.

5867
07:24:13,680 --> 07:24:15,680
Yeah, German.

5868
07:24:15,680 --> 07:24:16,680
Let's go.

5869
07:24:16,680 --> 07:24:18,680
Build a pyramid?

5870
07:24:32,680 --> 07:24:34,680
Is there no German?

5871
07:24:41,680 --> 07:24:43,680
Wait, there's no German voicelands?

5872
07:24:47,680 --> 07:24:48,680
Mmm.

5873
07:24:49,680 --> 07:24:51,680
The Throne of Venus.

5874
07:24:51,680 --> 07:24:53,680
Wait, have I played that?

5875
07:24:53,680 --> 07:24:54,680
Bro, send me up on that.

5876
07:24:54,680 --> 07:24:55,680
Oh, no, this is an actual game.

5877
07:24:55,680 --> 07:24:56,680
Sorry, we're not against the reflands.

5878
07:24:56,680 --> 07:24:57,680
Hold on a minute.

5879
07:24:57,680 --> 07:24:58,680
Hold on a minute.

5880
07:24:58,680 --> 07:25:00,680
We have to actually use teamwork to play this

5881
07:25:00,680 --> 07:25:01,680
because I don't know what this is.

5882
07:25:01,680 --> 07:25:02,680
T.

5883
07:25:02,680 --> 07:25:03,680
T.

5884
07:25:03,680 --> 07:25:06,680
Zen has some of the best voicelands.

5885
07:25:06,680 --> 07:25:08,680
I dreamt I was a butterfly.

5886
07:25:08,680 --> 07:25:10,680
In some Spanish countries, they have their

5887
07:25:10,680 --> 07:25:12,680
their way of saying a specific item,

5888
07:25:12,680 --> 07:25:14,680
place, or person, or anything to German.

5889
07:25:14,680 --> 07:25:16,680
It's not actually German.

5890
07:25:16,680 --> 07:25:18,680
You just don't want to pay for a clutch.

5891
07:25:18,680 --> 07:25:20,680
What does that even mean?

5892
07:25:27,680 --> 07:25:29,680
Right, actually.

5893
07:25:29,680 --> 07:25:31,680
Am I allowed to just mercy heal beam

5894
07:25:31,680 --> 07:25:32,680
for the last of this?

5895
07:25:32,680 --> 07:25:34,680
I mean, like, come on.

5896
07:25:34,680 --> 07:25:36,680
I've been a good girl, okay?

5897
07:25:36,680 --> 07:25:37,680
It's been seven hours.

5898
07:25:37,680 --> 07:25:39,680
We've been having a carry-on together, okay?

5899
07:25:39,680 --> 07:25:40,680
I've been a good girl.

5900
07:25:40,680 --> 07:25:42,680
I've been a good girl.

5901
07:25:42,680 --> 07:25:45,680
I'll behave, I promise.

5902
07:25:49,680 --> 07:25:50,680
I'm gonna just mercy heal.

5903
07:25:50,680 --> 07:25:51,680
Look at these skills.

5904
07:25:51,680 --> 07:25:53,680
I know it's such invigorating gameplay.

5905
07:25:53,680 --> 07:25:54,680
I don't know why.

5906
07:25:54,680 --> 07:25:56,680
I just find it really satisfying having to manage

5907
07:25:56,680 --> 07:25:58,680
everyone's health and, like, keep everyone alive.

5908
07:25:58,680 --> 07:26:01,680
Like, I actually get throbbing after a good fight

5909
07:26:01,680 --> 07:26:03,680
that I kept everyone alive, which we would have lost

5910
07:26:03,680 --> 07:26:05,680
otherwise if it wasn't for my decision-making.

5911
07:26:06,680 --> 07:26:08,680
Like, I didn't mean to be a weirdo, but...

5912
07:26:09,680 --> 07:26:11,680
I said it, like, you asked.

5913
07:26:11,680 --> 07:26:13,680
Well, no one asked, but you asked.

5914
07:26:15,680 --> 07:26:18,680
I do hate when the maps are so open.

5915
07:26:18,680 --> 07:26:21,680
Well, that diva can perish.

5916
07:26:26,680 --> 07:26:27,680
Well, we're doing it.

5917
07:26:27,680 --> 07:26:28,680
We're doing it.

5918
07:26:28,680 --> 07:26:30,680
I don't know if Alari's a bit of a DPS or not.

5919
07:26:30,680 --> 07:26:31,680
I'll...

5920
07:26:31,680 --> 07:26:32,680
I'll...

5921
07:26:32,680 --> 07:26:33,680
I'll...

5922
07:26:34,680 --> 07:26:35,680
...

5923
07:26:35,680 --> 07:26:37,680
B-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d

5924
07:26:39,680 --> 07:26:41,680
Aw, I wanted to scar.

5925
07:26:42,680 --> 07:26:44,680
What is she actually on, sis?

5926
07:26:45,680 --> 07:26:47,680
Ooh, my God. It's the ABC maps.

5927
07:26:47,680 --> 07:26:48,680
Okay, right.

5928
07:26:48,680 --> 07:26:50,680
We need to progress up, I guess.

5929
07:26:55,680 --> 07:26:56,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5930
07:26:56,680 --> 07:26:58,680
You know whee, come on.

5931
07:26:58,680 --> 07:27:04,680
We do need to get forward, but how?

5932
07:27:04,680 --> 07:27:08,680
Right, let's go.

5933
07:27:08,680 --> 07:27:11,680
The diva has forgotten.

5934
07:27:11,680 --> 07:27:20,680
I think we're just going to have to lose this on like the next point because we're fighting on it.

5935
07:27:20,680 --> 07:27:25,680
Unless I'm mental enough. I don't know what.

5936
07:27:25,680 --> 07:27:30,680
I'm just feeling quirky. I just felt a little bit quirky.

5937
07:27:30,680 --> 07:27:36,680
If you don't get the balls to do something, something will work out.

5938
07:27:36,680 --> 07:27:42,680
Venture is Canadian? Mexican?

5939
07:27:42,680 --> 07:27:48,680
I didn't know what her thing in my barber was, but that's really interesting.

5940
07:27:48,680 --> 07:27:53,680
It's nice when they do mixes.

5941
07:27:53,680 --> 07:27:57,680
It's not just one or the other. I guess probably the difficulty would be finding a voice.

5942
07:27:57,680 --> 07:28:03,680
Although saying that Junkrat is American, like the voice actor for Junkrat.

5943
07:28:14,680 --> 07:28:16,680
They're getting you, they're getting you.

5944
07:28:16,680 --> 07:28:20,680
You're on your own, Junker Queen. Please be careful.

5945
07:28:20,680 --> 07:28:24,680
Junker Queen, you're on your own. We can't restock Junker Queen. Can you make it back?

5946
07:28:24,680 --> 07:28:26,680
Oh no.

5947
07:28:26,680 --> 07:28:29,680
Refling, no.

5948
07:28:31,680 --> 07:28:34,680
Don't do that. That was rude.

5949
07:28:37,680 --> 07:28:41,680
I'm trying. I'm breaking free.

5950
07:28:41,680 --> 07:28:47,680
We'll need to wait for Junker Queen to come before we move in.

5951
07:28:47,680 --> 07:28:50,680
I don't know if I can raise that, bro.

5952
07:28:50,680 --> 07:28:53,680
I don't know if I can raise that. That's right in front of them.

5953
07:28:53,680 --> 07:28:56,680
Maybe, maybe.

5954
07:28:56,680 --> 07:28:58,680
Let's go.

5955
07:29:00,680 --> 07:29:02,680
No, you've...

5956
07:29:02,680 --> 07:29:06,680
By a freaking molecule.

5957
07:29:06,680 --> 07:29:08,680
Maybe.

5958
07:29:08,680 --> 07:29:13,680
Well, we're already set up for this fight on this point at Point Delta.

5959
07:29:13,680 --> 07:29:16,680
You know what? Maybe it works out in here.

5960
07:29:16,680 --> 07:29:22,680
Where did your house go? I don't have res, I'm sorry.

5961
07:29:22,680 --> 07:29:24,680
I don't have res. Oh my god, the...

5962
07:29:24,680 --> 07:29:30,680
Not the diva actually doing what she's supposed to, which is mowing down the healers.

5963
07:29:30,680 --> 07:29:32,680
How frustrating.

5964
07:29:37,680 --> 07:29:39,680
I don't know how I kept you alive.

5965
07:29:39,680 --> 07:29:42,680
Unfortunately, I sacrificed myself for that, but we did...

5966
07:29:42,680 --> 07:29:44,680
I mean, that could have gone a lot worse.

5967
07:29:44,680 --> 07:29:48,680
I bet my soul sucked at me. That Mercy was like, nah, I'm not having that.

5968
07:29:48,680 --> 07:29:52,680
Hey, Mercy, that Moiro's like, nah, I'm not having that.

5969
07:29:52,680 --> 07:29:55,680
I like playing support. I'm not the best at getting kills,

5970
07:29:55,680 --> 07:29:57,680
that makes me feel useful when I play.

5971
07:29:57,680 --> 07:29:59,680
Bro, that's literally me, because I just can't aim for the life of me.

5972
07:29:59,680 --> 07:30:02,680
I'm like, this is going too fast for my brain to keep up.

5973
07:30:02,680 --> 07:30:05,680
I'd rather just...

5974
07:30:05,680 --> 07:30:07,680
Oh my god, please.

5975
07:30:09,680 --> 07:30:13,680
Oh my god, it does not feel like...

5976
07:30:13,680 --> 07:30:15,680
That's it, I'm looking up the patch notes.

5977
07:30:15,680 --> 07:30:17,680
I need to know what healing per second I do.

5978
07:30:17,680 --> 07:30:20,680
I think I'll pick Moiro next game, probably that deal.

5979
07:30:20,680 --> 07:30:23,680
Unusualizing system.

5980
07:30:29,680 --> 07:30:31,680
Refling said, didn't you mind me?

5981
07:30:31,680 --> 07:30:33,680
I'm out.

5982
07:30:33,680 --> 07:30:35,680
Okay, the Ana got healed, which is good.

5983
07:30:35,680 --> 07:30:37,680
And then...

5984
07:30:37,680 --> 07:30:42,680
We're kissing, we're kissing, we're safe, we're safe.

5985
07:30:42,680 --> 07:30:44,680
She better not try and...

5986
07:30:44,680 --> 07:30:46,680
Damn, she does not like us.

5987
07:30:48,680 --> 07:30:50,680
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

5988
07:30:53,680 --> 07:30:56,680
I don't, I don't know what I'm doing.

5989
07:30:56,680 --> 07:30:58,680
I think, I think it's time.

5990
07:30:58,680 --> 07:31:00,680
I think it's time to go Moiro.

5991
07:31:00,680 --> 07:31:02,680
It is time.

5992
07:31:03,680 --> 07:31:04,680
It's time to be toxic.

5993
07:31:04,680 --> 07:31:07,680
No, but Stronny, you had your ultimate.

5994
07:31:07,680 --> 07:31:11,680
Wait, I thought the ultimate was 30% if you had it full.

5995
07:31:13,680 --> 07:31:17,680
When they changed that, I could have sworn they made it

5996
07:31:17,680 --> 07:31:19,680
so you had, you get to keep your ultimate,

5997
07:31:19,680 --> 07:31:22,680
because they were like, we're addressing the problem

5998
07:31:22,680 --> 07:31:24,680
where people don't want to swap their characters

5999
07:31:24,680 --> 07:31:26,680
because they don't want to lose ultimate,

6000
07:31:26,680 --> 07:31:29,680
but it's costing them like precious time basically.

6001
07:31:30,680 --> 07:31:33,680
They reverted the 30%.

6002
07:31:35,680 --> 07:31:38,680
I mean, I get that you shouldn't be like...

6003
07:31:39,680 --> 07:31:42,680
You don't want to go and leave me alone.

6004
07:31:42,680 --> 07:31:44,680
What's going on?

6005
07:31:44,680 --> 07:31:46,680
Bro, I can't keep up.

6006
07:31:46,680 --> 07:31:48,680
I suck at this game and I'm dead.

6007
07:31:48,680 --> 07:31:51,680
I am sucking terribly.

6008
07:31:51,680 --> 07:31:53,680
Sorry, we've won.

6009
07:31:53,680 --> 07:31:55,680
I'm sorry, I'm being an anchor.

6010
07:31:55,680 --> 07:31:58,680
I think maybe, am I allowed to blame it

6011
07:31:58,680 --> 07:32:00,680
on the endurance screen?

6012
07:32:00,680 --> 07:32:03,680
I'm going to be honest, I only scheduled into play

6013
07:32:03,680 --> 07:32:05,680
two hours of this, but I got a wee,

6014
07:32:05,680 --> 07:32:08,680
not me and Genji did the exact same thing.

6015
07:32:08,680 --> 07:32:11,680
Both of us are like, that's strange, we can't get up.

6016
07:32:14,680 --> 07:32:16,680
It was nerfed.

6017
07:32:18,680 --> 07:32:20,680
It's like going back to an old playground

6018
07:32:20,680 --> 07:32:23,680
and they took away the swings and feels like that.

6019
07:32:24,680 --> 07:32:26,680
Yeah, I didn't expect to play so long,

6020
07:32:26,680 --> 07:32:27,680
but I'm having such a blast.

6021
07:32:27,680 --> 07:32:29,680
I was like, more, more, more, more, more.

6022
07:32:29,680 --> 07:32:31,680
Obviously, it's really fun when I unlock a new character

6023
07:32:31,680 --> 07:32:34,680
just to play it like, just because.

6024
07:32:36,680 --> 07:32:38,680
See this diva constant, oh, I'm just walking,

6025
07:32:38,680 --> 07:32:41,680
I'm so sorry, Ana, I'm so sorry.

6026
07:32:42,680 --> 07:32:44,680
I'm so sorry.

6027
07:32:45,680 --> 07:32:47,680
I'm so sorry.

6028
07:32:54,680 --> 07:32:56,680
I'm tryharding.

6029
07:32:58,680 --> 07:33:00,680
I mean, at least we got this.

6030
07:33:01,680 --> 07:33:04,680
Oh, leave my Ana alone.

6031
07:33:05,680 --> 07:33:07,680
There we go.

6032
07:33:07,680 --> 07:33:10,680
Right, is this a comeback?

6033
07:33:10,680 --> 07:33:13,680
Hashtag, come on, oh fuck.

6034
07:33:13,680 --> 07:33:16,680
Man, I hate divas because they always eat my balls.

6035
07:33:18,680 --> 07:33:22,680
That was my healing, like, don't be so rude, you know?

6036
07:33:22,680 --> 07:33:25,680
If we could get rid of that diva, honestly.

6037
07:33:26,680 --> 07:33:29,680
Honestly, get rid of that, yes.

6038
07:33:29,680 --> 07:33:31,680
No.

6039
07:33:31,680 --> 07:33:35,680
I fated, but because of the lag it didn't register,

6040
07:33:35,680 --> 07:33:38,680
you literally heard the audio queued me fading.

6041
07:33:38,680 --> 07:33:41,680
Because I knew what I had to do next.

6042
07:33:41,680 --> 07:33:43,680
You wouldn't mind if divas sucked your ball,

6043
07:33:43,680 --> 07:33:45,680
I bet you wouldn't.

6044
07:33:46,680 --> 07:33:48,680
I'm so sorry.

6045
07:33:48,680 --> 07:33:50,680
You wouldn't mind if divas sucked your ball,

6046
07:33:50,680 --> 07:33:52,680
I bet you wouldn't.

6047
07:33:52,680 --> 07:33:54,680
I bet to leave for work, Nateshift,

6048
07:33:54,680 --> 07:33:56,680
have fun as well, get some dobes,

6049
07:33:56,680 --> 07:34:00,680
yeah, thank you for playing, if you say.

6050
07:34:00,680 --> 07:34:04,680
And thank you for farting, if you farted.

6051
07:34:04,680 --> 07:34:06,680
Oh wait, shit, this is the last point.

6052
07:34:06,680 --> 07:34:08,680
Whee!

6053
07:34:12,680 --> 07:34:15,680
I wouldn't let me get one alive, but I did stall.

6054
07:34:15,680 --> 07:34:17,680
I did what I had to do.

6055
07:34:17,680 --> 07:34:19,680
Sorry, Weflins.

6056
07:34:19,680 --> 07:34:21,680
I'm definitely not so awake.

6057
07:34:21,680 --> 07:34:24,680
My fellow Weflinks, I am not awake.

6058
07:34:27,680 --> 07:34:29,680
My fart work.

6059
07:34:29,680 --> 07:34:31,680
I'm going.

6060
07:34:31,680 --> 07:34:33,680
Are they doing it? Wait, hold on.

6061
07:34:33,680 --> 07:34:36,680
I'm doing a healing orb, bouncing it on that wall.

6062
07:34:43,680 --> 07:34:46,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6063
07:34:46,680 --> 07:34:49,680
Oh no, don't make me the last one on this point.

6064
07:34:49,680 --> 07:34:51,680
Oh wait, the Weflins are doing it?

6065
07:34:51,680 --> 07:34:53,680
Oh my god.

6066
07:34:53,680 --> 07:34:55,680
No pressure.

6067
07:34:56,680 --> 07:34:58,680
No pressure.

6068
07:34:58,680 --> 07:35:00,680
No pressure.

6069
07:35:00,680 --> 07:35:02,680
Oh my fellow Americans.

6070
07:35:02,680 --> 07:35:04,680
Sorry, that's really stuck in my head right now.

6071
07:35:04,680 --> 07:35:05,680
It's my brain worm.

6072
07:35:05,680 --> 07:35:07,680
Oh no, it's an ear worm.

6073
07:35:07,680 --> 07:35:08,680
I don't have worms in my brain.

6074
07:35:08,680 --> 07:35:11,680
I have worms for brains, but I don't have a worm in my brain.

6075
07:35:11,680 --> 07:35:14,680
Right, I need this diva DMect.

6076
07:35:14,680 --> 07:35:17,680
I'm going to see her tiny little tight bodysuit.

6077
07:35:25,680 --> 07:35:29,680
No, you have to be kidding me.

6078
07:35:29,680 --> 07:35:32,680
I needed, I needed a kill.

6079
07:35:32,680 --> 07:35:34,680
I needed a kill, right.

6080
07:35:34,680 --> 07:35:36,680
Oh my gosh.

6081
07:35:36,680 --> 07:35:38,680
The comeback.

6082
07:35:38,680 --> 07:35:41,680
Scraped off my teeth.

6083
07:35:41,680 --> 07:35:44,680
Because I think we have the comeback.

6084
07:35:45,680 --> 07:35:47,680
No.

6085
07:35:49,680 --> 07:35:51,680
No way.

6086
07:35:51,680 --> 07:35:53,680
Reflins.

6087
07:35:54,680 --> 07:35:56,680
That was fantastic.

6088
07:35:56,680 --> 07:35:58,680
Fucking GG.

6089
07:35:59,680 --> 07:36:01,680
Oh my gosh.

6090
07:36:03,680 --> 07:36:05,680
Oh my gosh.

6091
07:36:07,680 --> 07:36:09,680
Oh my god, that was so good.

6092
07:36:09,680 --> 07:36:11,680
I don't know how you did that.

6093
07:36:11,680 --> 07:36:14,680
Because I was such an anchor that entire game.

6094
07:36:17,680 --> 07:36:19,680
Oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you.

6095
07:36:19,680 --> 07:36:21,680
What the fuck?

6096
07:36:21,680 --> 07:36:23,680
You guys are so good at this game.

6097
07:36:23,680 --> 07:36:25,680
This is how I should just cheat in multiplayer games.

6098
07:36:25,680 --> 07:36:29,680
Oh my god, next you can carry me on that game that got review bombed

6099
07:36:29,680 --> 07:36:33,680
because Sony told the dev team to make you like

6100
07:36:33,680 --> 07:36:35,680
sign up with a phone number to play or something.

6101
07:36:35,680 --> 07:36:37,680
No, what was that?

6102
07:36:37,680 --> 07:36:39,680
What was the thing about Helldiver?

6103
07:36:39,680 --> 07:36:41,680
Are you squidding me right now?

6104
07:36:41,680 --> 07:36:43,680
I'm going to continue.

6105
07:36:45,680 --> 07:36:47,680
S-S-A-O-D-A

6106
07:36:47,680 --> 07:36:49,680
S-A-O-D-A

6107
07:36:49,680 --> 07:36:51,680
Thank you for the extended membership.

6108
07:36:51,680 --> 07:36:53,680
Hey, Stronny, I took the liberty of tweaking the 66.

6109
07:36:53,680 --> 07:36:55,680
It was better.

6110
07:36:55,680 --> 07:36:57,680
Let me copy and paste that code.

6111
07:36:57,680 --> 07:36:59,680
I'm going to go very quickly for a piss.

6112
07:36:59,680 --> 07:37:01,680
I'm going to go for a piss.

6113
07:37:01,680 --> 07:37:03,680
I'm going for a piss.

6114
07:37:03,680 --> 07:37:05,680
I think there is one Reflin.

6115
07:37:05,680 --> 07:37:07,680
Who was it?

6116
07:37:07,680 --> 07:37:09,680
Oh my god, please?

6117
07:37:09,680 --> 07:37:11,680
Can I just... Please let me see what I was...

6118
07:37:11,680 --> 07:37:13,680
Right, no, no, not German time.

6119
07:37:13,680 --> 07:37:15,680
Go to sleep.

6120
07:37:15,680 --> 07:37:17,680
Right, so that was...

6121
07:37:17,680 --> 07:37:19,680
I don't know. Who's that?

6122
07:37:19,680 --> 07:37:21,680
You came in. I thought you came in.

6123
07:37:21,680 --> 07:37:23,680
It was Boyd and Billy that didn't get...

6124
07:37:29,680 --> 07:37:31,680
Uh...

6125
07:37:31,680 --> 07:37:33,680
There's like two more.

6126
07:37:33,680 --> 07:37:35,680
Care about the battle pass?

6127
07:37:35,680 --> 07:37:37,680
Couldn't be less of a shy sort.

6128
07:37:37,680 --> 07:37:39,680
Um...

6129
07:37:39,680 --> 07:37:41,680
Okay, now they've gone a bit.

6130
07:37:41,680 --> 07:37:43,680
My poor Reflit.

6131
07:37:45,680 --> 07:37:47,680
Hidden Squid? Was it you that never got a game with me?

6132
07:37:49,680 --> 07:37:51,680
I'm going to admit there was someone with this profile picture

6133
07:37:51,680 --> 07:37:53,680
that didn't get a chance. Was it you Hidden Squid?

6134
07:37:53,680 --> 07:37:55,680
Oh, not to... I think it was you.

6135
07:37:55,680 --> 07:37:57,680
Fuck it again. I think it was you.

6136
07:37:57,680 --> 07:37:59,680
Joy?

6137
07:37:59,680 --> 07:38:01,680
I don't remember writing joy down.

6138
07:38:03,680 --> 07:38:05,680
Joy?

6139
07:38:05,680 --> 07:38:07,680
Have you played with me?

6140
07:38:11,680 --> 07:38:13,680
You're in a game right now, so I can't invite you.

6141
07:38:15,680 --> 07:38:17,680
I just need to make sure...

6142
07:38:19,680 --> 07:38:21,680
Oh my god, you're open mic.

6143
07:38:21,680 --> 07:38:23,680
He's going to fart down the mic.

6144
07:38:23,680 --> 07:38:25,680
Boyd Ranger, you never got a shot with me, did you?

6145
07:38:25,680 --> 07:38:27,680
No, you didn't.

6146
07:38:29,680 --> 07:38:31,680
Um...

6147
07:38:31,680 --> 07:38:33,680
Wink, wink?

6148
07:38:33,680 --> 07:38:35,680
You playing this tutorial?

6149
07:38:35,680 --> 07:38:37,680
Wink, you never got a chance to play with me, I don't know.

6150
07:38:41,680 --> 07:38:43,680
Please do not fart down the mic.

6151
07:38:43,680 --> 07:38:45,680
You have open mic on this one.

6152
07:38:45,680 --> 07:38:47,680
I can hear you cutting about in the background.

6153
07:38:47,680 --> 07:38:49,680
Don't fart, they're going to hear it.

6154
07:38:51,680 --> 07:38:53,680
Um...

6155
07:38:55,680 --> 07:38:57,680
I'm just checking. I think Joy

6156
07:38:57,680 --> 07:38:59,680
is the only one

6157
07:38:59,680 --> 07:39:01,680
that I can see online right now that hasn't had a shot.

6158
07:39:01,680 --> 07:39:03,680
Right, I'm going to very quickly go for a P,

6159
07:39:03,680 --> 07:39:05,680
okay?

6160
07:39:05,680 --> 07:39:07,680
Helldiver is still good.

6161
07:39:07,680 --> 07:39:09,680
Sony required to have PSN again.

6162
07:39:09,680 --> 07:39:11,680
Oh yeah, that was a bit bizarre.

6163
07:39:11,680 --> 07:39:13,680
I remember that.

6164
07:39:13,680 --> 07:39:15,680
Okay, let me go for a quick PP.

6165
07:39:15,680 --> 07:39:17,680
I'll be a moment.

6166
07:39:17,680 --> 07:39:19,680
I'll be quick again.

6167
07:39:29,680 --> 07:39:31,680
Thank you.

6168
07:39:59,680 --> 07:40:01,680
Thank you.

6169
07:40:25,680 --> 07:40:27,680
No, I didn't wash my hands.

6170
07:40:29,680 --> 07:40:31,680
She saw me when I came out,

6171
07:40:31,680 --> 07:40:33,680
and she was like,

6172
07:40:33,680 --> 07:40:35,680
and I was like, give me another hour, Gimli.

6173
07:40:39,680 --> 07:40:41,680
She's gone, I'm already back.

6174
07:40:41,680 --> 07:40:43,680
I know anyone.

6175
07:40:43,680 --> 07:40:45,680
Right.

6176
07:40:45,680 --> 07:40:47,680
Who did I try and get in there?

6177
07:40:49,680 --> 07:40:51,680
It was Joy, you're in a fucking...

6178
07:40:51,680 --> 07:40:53,680
Right, that's it, you're getting whispered.

6179
07:40:53,680 --> 07:40:55,680
Do you want an yes-lag?

6180
07:40:55,680 --> 07:40:57,680
I don't even...

6181
07:40:57,680 --> 07:40:59,680
Oh no, I can't call you a slag.

6182
07:40:59,680 --> 07:41:01,680
Right, do you want an refling kiss?

6183
07:41:01,680 --> 07:41:03,680
Exo exo exo exo?

6184
07:41:03,680 --> 07:41:05,680
You need to

6185
07:41:05,680 --> 07:41:07,680
ditch your current

6186
07:41:07,680 --> 07:41:09,680
lobby

6187
07:41:09,680 --> 07:41:11,680
for me

6188
07:41:11,680 --> 07:41:13,680
to invite you into the group.

6189
07:41:15,680 --> 07:41:17,680
Oh, wait, because I called you a slag?

6190
07:41:17,680 --> 07:41:19,680
No, I didn't call you a slag.

6191
07:41:21,680 --> 07:41:23,680
I don't know.

6192
07:41:23,680 --> 07:41:25,680
Maybe the server didn't like that.

6193
07:41:25,680 --> 07:41:27,680
I don't know, the server didn't like that.

6194
07:41:27,680 --> 07:41:29,680
And thank you for the extended membership

6195
07:41:29,680 --> 07:41:31,680
again and the lobby code,

6196
07:41:31,680 --> 07:41:33,680
CODA.

6197
07:41:33,680 --> 07:41:35,680
Call him a slag.

6198
07:41:35,680 --> 07:41:37,680
That's all I'm going to say.

6199
07:41:39,680 --> 07:41:41,680
Wait, it doesn't...

6200
07:41:41,680 --> 07:41:43,680
Wait, can I not send any...

6201
07:41:47,680 --> 07:41:49,680
Can I not...

6202
07:41:49,680 --> 07:41:51,680
Can I not call any...

6203
07:41:51,680 --> 07:41:53,680
What?

6204
07:41:53,680 --> 07:41:55,680
Did he just fart?

6205
07:41:55,680 --> 07:41:57,680
Did you fart in my fucking movie?

6206
07:41:57,680 --> 07:41:59,680
Am I chat banned?

6207
07:42:01,680 --> 07:42:03,680
What's an internal problem, 7000?

6208
07:42:03,680 --> 07:42:05,680
I'm getting nervous.

6209
07:42:05,680 --> 07:42:07,680
How have I been chat banned?

6210
07:42:07,680 --> 07:42:09,680
I didn't do anything.

6211
07:42:09,680 --> 07:42:11,680
I think it's on your side.

6212
07:42:11,680 --> 07:42:13,680
Do this, press escape options social.

6213
07:42:13,680 --> 07:42:15,680
Escape

6214
07:42:15,680 --> 07:42:17,680
Options

6215
07:42:17,680 --> 07:42:19,680
Social

6216
07:42:19,680 --> 07:42:21,680
Next chat.

6217
07:42:21,680 --> 07:42:23,680
On, on, on, on...

6218
07:42:29,680 --> 07:42:31,680
I never can message you that you're a bunch of slags.

6219
07:42:37,680 --> 07:42:39,680
No, fuck!

6220
07:42:43,680 --> 07:42:45,680
He blew on the mic, perhaps.

6221
07:42:45,680 --> 07:42:47,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mic blew.

6222
07:42:47,680 --> 07:42:49,680
Aw, I can't call you slag.

6223
07:42:49,680 --> 07:42:51,680
Magic getting a DM from your Oshi in the game?

6224
07:42:51,680 --> 07:42:53,680
Cog, what the hell?

6225
07:42:53,680 --> 07:42:55,680
Right, how...

6226
07:42:55,680 --> 07:42:57,680
Is there anyone else that hasn't had a chat?

6227
07:42:59,680 --> 07:43:01,680
I'm analizing, other than...

6228
07:43:07,680 --> 07:43:09,680
I'm just taking, if not, I'll just get randomly shown.

6229
07:43:11,680 --> 07:43:13,680
Did you play your own game, so I assume you played?

6230
07:43:13,680 --> 07:43:15,680
With me, I'm not sure.

6231
07:43:15,680 --> 07:43:17,680
I can't remember.

6232
07:43:17,680 --> 07:43:19,680
All the dates are blurring together.

6233
07:43:19,680 --> 07:43:21,680
I'm gonna get you in, because you literally waited from the start.

6234
07:43:21,680 --> 07:43:23,680
I'm pretty sure you waited 7 hours

6235
07:43:23,680 --> 07:43:25,680
just to play with me, and I feel really bad.

6236
07:43:25,680 --> 07:43:27,680
Tee hee, I feel terrible.

6237
07:43:27,680 --> 07:43:29,680
She's calling other reeflings slangs,

6238
07:43:29,680 --> 07:43:31,680
God, I wish that were me. Oh, no, I can call you a slag right now.

6239
07:43:31,680 --> 07:43:33,680
I assure you.

6240
07:43:33,680 --> 07:43:35,680
Oh, you just stopped playing?

6241
07:43:35,680 --> 07:43:37,680
Literally, I was like...

6242
07:43:37,680 --> 07:43:39,680
No, I'm not doing it. Get me out here.

6243
07:43:39,680 --> 07:43:41,680
Right, we'll play this game...

6244
07:43:41,680 --> 07:43:43,680
or not.

6245
07:43:43,680 --> 07:43:45,680
Who's taking a job at a time?

6246
07:43:45,680 --> 07:43:47,680
Oh, no, he did join you.

6247
07:43:47,680 --> 07:43:49,680
Oh, no, he did time out.

6248
07:43:49,680 --> 07:43:51,680
Are you coming in or not?

6249
07:43:51,680 --> 07:43:53,680
You literally waited for, like, Iber.

6250
07:43:53,680 --> 07:43:55,680
Iber, Iber, Iber, Iber, Iber.

6251
07:43:55,680 --> 07:43:57,680
He's away for a job at a bit, yeah.

6252
07:43:57,680 --> 07:43:59,680
He's actually doing a big fat and nasty shite.

6253
07:44:01,680 --> 07:44:03,680
Do you want us to see if he...

6254
07:44:03,680 --> 07:44:05,680
Yeah, whisper to me if you can.

6255
07:44:05,680 --> 07:44:07,680
Who'll be moaning?

6256
07:44:07,680 --> 07:44:09,680
Right, okay, let's go.

6257
07:44:09,680 --> 07:44:11,680
I'm gonna play...

6258
07:44:11,680 --> 07:44:13,680
Oh, no, I can't play Moog.

6259
07:44:15,680 --> 07:44:17,680
I hate it here.

6260
07:44:17,680 --> 07:44:19,680
Okay.

6261
07:44:19,680 --> 07:44:21,680
Oh, I heard myself in the background.

6262
07:44:23,680 --> 07:44:25,680
I can hear myself in the background.

6263
07:44:25,680 --> 07:44:27,680
You have open mic on, by the way.

6264
07:44:27,680 --> 07:44:29,680
I can hear myself in the background.

6265
07:44:29,680 --> 07:44:31,680
You're still on, I saw you when I went to sleep.

6266
07:44:31,680 --> 07:44:33,680
Rise and shine.

6267
07:44:33,680 --> 07:44:35,680
Rise and shine.

6268
07:44:35,680 --> 07:44:37,680
Rise and shine.

6269
07:44:39,680 --> 07:44:41,680
Because...

6270
07:44:41,680 --> 07:44:43,680
We're playing with the refloons.

6271
07:44:43,680 --> 07:44:45,680
Like, I like mushroom snippets, okay?

6272
07:44:45,680 --> 07:44:47,680
It fills my soul, okay?

6273
07:44:53,680 --> 07:44:55,680
Wait, what?

6274
07:44:55,680 --> 07:44:57,680
Sorry for bullying you in Overwatch, but I was lashing out.

6275
07:44:57,680 --> 07:44:59,680
Not only because I'm not able to call you a puppy.

6276
07:44:59,680 --> 07:45:01,680
I didn't hear a mic.

6277
07:45:01,680 --> 07:45:03,680
But also because you called me a fakeling.

6278
07:45:03,680 --> 07:45:05,680
I had to correct you.

6279
07:45:05,680 --> 07:45:07,680
My headset just came out.

6280
07:45:07,680 --> 07:45:09,680
Oh my god, I can't hear anything.

6281
07:45:09,680 --> 07:45:11,680
Oh my god, hold on.

6282
07:45:17,680 --> 07:45:19,680
Quick, then.

6283
07:45:19,680 --> 07:45:21,680
Mic check, okay.

6284
07:45:21,680 --> 07:45:23,680
Okay, I can hear that.

6285
07:45:23,680 --> 07:45:25,680
Jeez, couldn't whisper.

6286
07:45:25,680 --> 07:45:27,680
Okay, I wonder if it's because my account's new.

6287
07:45:27,680 --> 07:45:29,680
They're like, hmm, this is a box.

6288
07:45:29,680 --> 07:45:31,680
Wait, did I not select...

6289
07:45:31,680 --> 07:45:33,680
Oh sorry, did I not select sometime?

6290
07:45:33,680 --> 07:45:35,680
Everyone pick a rule, pick a rule.

6291
07:45:35,680 --> 07:45:37,680
Any rule is yours.

6292
07:45:37,680 --> 07:45:39,680
Danes are working, but yours aren't.

6293
07:45:39,680 --> 07:45:41,680
Mommy, you might need to look at that.

6294
07:45:41,680 --> 07:45:43,680
How strange.

6295
07:45:43,680 --> 07:45:45,680
My milk isn't connected.

6296
07:45:45,680 --> 07:45:47,680
Oh wait, it finally works.

6297
07:45:47,680 --> 07:45:49,680
Oh my god, the refloons!

6298
07:45:49,680 --> 07:45:51,680
I did this!

6299
07:45:51,680 --> 07:45:53,680
I'm just gonna make my own sense.

6300
07:45:53,680 --> 07:45:55,680
They have, like, no idea what happens until I start

6301
07:45:55,680 --> 07:45:57,680
squirming down the mic.

6302
07:45:57,680 --> 07:45:59,680
Excuse me, wink, wink.

6303
07:45:59,680 --> 07:46:01,680
I did a rule, young man.

6304
07:46:01,680 --> 07:46:03,680
I did all.

6305
07:46:03,680 --> 07:46:05,680
Wink? No.

6306
07:46:05,680 --> 07:46:07,680
No, you've no selected it.

6307
07:46:07,680 --> 07:46:09,680
You need to click, you need to confirm it.

6308
07:46:09,680 --> 07:46:11,680
The big orange one.

6309
07:46:11,680 --> 07:46:13,680
Click all and confirm.

6310
07:46:13,680 --> 07:46:15,680
Ah, that's what I thought, bend over.

6311
07:46:15,680 --> 07:46:17,680
I had to confirm it, holding up line of production.

6312
07:46:17,680 --> 07:46:19,680
Come on, I've got XP to farm.

6313
07:46:19,680 --> 07:46:21,680
Oh, you've never played?

6314
07:46:21,680 --> 07:46:23,680
Nope.

6315
07:46:23,680 --> 07:46:25,680
The first Overwatch was better.

6316
07:46:25,680 --> 07:46:27,680
How can you not play?

6317
07:46:27,680 --> 07:46:29,680
You have no idea what you're about to be in for.

6318
07:46:29,680 --> 07:46:31,680
And before he gets the fucking tank.

6319
07:46:31,680 --> 07:46:33,680
Oh no.

6320
07:46:33,680 --> 07:46:35,680
It's Ogre.

6321
07:46:35,680 --> 07:46:37,680
It's Ogre.

6322
07:46:37,680 --> 07:46:39,680
It's actually Ogre, if he gets phone tank.

6323
07:46:39,680 --> 07:46:41,680
But not in a bad way, just so you know.

6324
07:46:41,680 --> 07:46:43,680
You have no idea what you're about to get in Nile, it kind of way.

6325
07:46:43,680 --> 07:46:45,680
He's going to the factory.

6326
07:46:45,680 --> 07:46:47,680
I literally, I just couldn't believe this game's shit.

6327
07:46:47,680 --> 07:46:49,680
Why does anyone play it?

6328
07:46:49,680 --> 07:46:51,680
It's nothing.

6329
07:46:51,680 --> 07:46:53,680
Stony, please.

6330
07:46:53,680 --> 07:46:55,680
I haven't had to make the phone.

6331
07:46:55,680 --> 07:46:57,680
Hmm?

6332
07:46:57,680 --> 07:46:59,680
Wait.

6333
07:46:59,680 --> 07:47:01,680
Favorite character in Overwatch, go.

6334
07:47:01,680 --> 07:47:03,680
The one that I come to the most, thank you.

6335
07:47:03,680 --> 07:47:05,680
I play Paladin.

6336
07:47:05,680 --> 07:47:07,680
Hopefully that trash is over.

6337
07:47:07,680 --> 07:47:09,680
Paladin? Wait, you're a world of Warcraft?

6338
07:47:09,680 --> 07:47:11,680
Yeah, buddy.

6339
07:47:11,680 --> 07:47:13,680
Oh no.

6340
07:47:13,680 --> 07:47:15,680
He's the best.

6341
07:47:15,680 --> 07:47:17,680
I've never got a chance to play World of Warcraft.

6342
07:47:17,680 --> 07:47:19,680
My mother thought it was...

6343
07:47:19,680 --> 07:47:21,680
I was going witchcraft in it.

6344
07:47:21,680 --> 07:47:23,680
I was against Jesus, wasn't it?

6345
07:47:23,680 --> 07:47:25,680
Eh, kind of.

6346
07:47:25,680 --> 07:47:27,680
Oh my god.

6347
07:47:27,680 --> 07:47:29,680
Wait, but wouldn't...

6348
07:47:29,680 --> 07:47:31,680
Which is weird, because her friends was a witch,

6349
07:47:31,680 --> 07:47:33,680
but she wasn't okay with me playing World of Warcraft.

6350
07:47:33,680 --> 07:47:35,680
She was fine with me playing Wizard 101, I guess.

6351
07:47:35,680 --> 07:47:37,680
His mom would think I'm an absolute slag.

6352
07:47:37,680 --> 07:47:39,680
Wait, are you not going to get in trouble talking to me?

6353
07:47:39,680 --> 07:47:41,680
You know, girls like me?

6354
07:47:41,680 --> 07:47:43,680
You're the least weird girl I have ever encountered.

6355
07:47:43,680 --> 07:47:45,680
Wait, what?

6356
07:47:45,680 --> 07:47:47,680
I mean, that's...

6357
07:47:47,680 --> 07:47:49,680
No.

6358
07:47:49,680 --> 07:47:51,680
Did I take that as a normie comment?

6359
07:47:51,680 --> 07:47:53,680
Did I just get called a normie?

6360
07:47:53,680 --> 07:47:55,680
Oh my.

6361
07:47:55,680 --> 07:47:57,680
Me?

6362
07:47:57,680 --> 07:47:59,680
Normie?

6363
07:47:59,680 --> 07:48:01,680
Don't mind if I do.

6364
07:48:01,680 --> 07:48:03,680
Ugh.

6365
07:48:03,680 --> 07:48:05,680
Let's do it.

6366
07:48:05,680 --> 07:48:07,680
Right.

6367
07:48:07,680 --> 07:48:09,680
It's attack.

6368
07:48:09,680 --> 07:48:11,680
Right, I'm going to show you the power of attack, Targaryen.

6369
07:48:11,680 --> 07:48:13,680
No, I'm going to try McCree.

6370
07:48:13,680 --> 07:48:15,680
Sorry, okay, I should do it.

6371
07:48:15,680 --> 07:48:17,680
I dead named him.

6372
07:48:17,680 --> 07:48:19,680
I swear, if I hear one,

6373
07:48:19,680 --> 07:48:21,680
we're going to fart in the background.

6374
07:48:21,680 --> 07:48:23,680
I'm going to cry.

6375
07:48:23,680 --> 07:48:25,680
Certified normie, literally.

6376
07:48:25,680 --> 07:48:27,680
Oh my god, we're at Lysha State.

6377
07:48:27,680 --> 07:48:29,680
Did he just win me already?

6378
07:48:29,680 --> 07:48:31,680
You're pretty good.

6379
07:48:31,680 --> 07:48:33,680
Oh my god, your profile picture is so cute.

6380
07:48:33,680 --> 07:48:35,680
It's when Jerry ate the cheese

6381
07:48:35,680 --> 07:48:37,680
and it becomes cheese shaped.

6382
07:48:37,680 --> 07:48:39,680
Thank you for becoming a member.

6383
07:48:39,680 --> 07:48:41,680
You're pretty good.

6384
07:48:41,680 --> 07:48:43,680
I'm not good at Overwatch,

6385
07:48:43,680 --> 07:48:45,680
but I'm going to be pretty good at physics.

6386
07:48:45,680 --> 07:48:47,680
Astrony, we all call him McCree.

6387
07:48:47,680 --> 07:48:49,680
Okay, right, I'm not getting cancelled, thank you.

6388
07:48:49,680 --> 07:48:51,680
Literally, I called him McCree

6389
07:48:51,680 --> 07:48:53,680
for the three years that I played Overwatch.

6390
07:48:53,680 --> 07:48:55,680
Please forgive, I'm sorry.

6391
07:48:55,680 --> 07:48:57,680
It takes me a while to adjust.

6392
07:48:57,680 --> 07:48:59,680
Oh my god, this microphone's going to snap off.

6393
07:48:59,680 --> 07:49:01,680
I'm going to snap this freaking twig.

6394
07:49:03,680 --> 07:49:05,680
Right, okay.

6395
07:49:05,680 --> 07:49:07,680
I need to get the aimbot up.

6396
07:49:07,680 --> 07:49:09,680
Okay, I missed completely.

6397
07:49:09,680 --> 07:49:11,680
I actually have decent things.

6398
07:49:11,680 --> 07:49:13,680
I'm not sure I'm supposed to spam it like this,

6399
07:49:13,680 --> 07:49:15,680
but I'm going to do it anyway.

6400
07:49:15,680 --> 07:49:17,680
Man, we've got a DMG.

6401
07:49:17,680 --> 07:49:19,680
Stuff's happening.

6402
07:49:19,680 --> 07:49:21,680
It's not happening by me.

6403
07:49:21,680 --> 07:49:23,680
Ah, sure you, I'm missing all my shots.

6404
07:49:25,680 --> 07:49:27,680
Okay, Ryan's barrier's about to go down.

6405
07:49:29,680 --> 07:49:31,680
Oh, your zen just got sniped.

6406
07:49:31,680 --> 07:49:33,680
Oh, I didn't even notice him there.

6407
07:49:35,680 --> 07:49:37,680
Oh, he was hiding in the wee subway car.

6408
07:49:41,680 --> 07:49:43,680
Oh my god, we didn't consume enough brain rot, TikToks.

6409
07:49:43,680 --> 07:49:45,680
Right, okay.

6410
07:49:45,680 --> 07:49:47,680
I can roll and it'll reload, and I've got a flashbang.

6411
07:49:47,680 --> 07:49:49,680
I don't know if it's magnetic anymore.

6412
07:49:49,680 --> 07:49:51,680
I just remember it being a magnetic thing.

6413
07:49:51,680 --> 07:49:53,680
Okay, right, no, that's not my problem.

6414
07:49:53,680 --> 07:49:55,680
Sorry, that's above my pay grade.

6415
07:49:55,680 --> 07:49:57,680
I'm going to wait until the refunds come right back.

6416
07:49:57,680 --> 07:49:59,680
We're in Mario's place.

6417
07:49:59,680 --> 07:50:01,680
They have drone delivery by the slice.

6418
07:50:01,680 --> 07:50:03,680
What, by the slash?

6419
07:50:03,680 --> 07:50:05,680
Please, video megastore.

6420
07:50:07,680 --> 07:50:09,680
Mihai!

6421
07:50:09,680 --> 07:50:11,680
Mihai, Mihai, Mihai.

6422
07:50:11,680 --> 07:50:13,680
Sorry, Mihai, 7.69.

6423
07:50:13,680 --> 07:50:15,680
Thank you for the extended membership, Reinhardt Supremacy.

6424
07:50:17,680 --> 07:50:19,680
You love Reinhardt?

6425
07:50:19,680 --> 07:50:21,680
I'm sorry, Anna, just...

6426
07:50:21,680 --> 07:50:23,680
Right, no, I've had enough.

6427
07:50:23,680 --> 07:50:25,680
I've had enough, right.

6428
07:50:25,680 --> 07:50:27,680
Who do I need to play?

6429
07:50:29,680 --> 07:50:31,680
It's going to have to be Torbjorn.

6430
07:50:31,680 --> 07:50:33,680
I'm sorry, the reason why I like Torbjorn so much

6431
07:50:33,680 --> 07:50:35,680
is survivability.

6432
07:50:35,680 --> 07:50:37,680
If I put myself in a really silly, billy place,

6433
07:50:37,680 --> 07:50:39,680
I can literally just press E

6434
07:50:39,680 --> 07:50:41,680
and get myself out.

6435
07:50:47,680 --> 07:50:49,680
Like...

6436
07:50:49,680 --> 07:50:51,680
Okay, hold on, hold on.

6437
07:50:51,680 --> 07:50:53,680
I can't even disappoint my refunds just because I'm...

6438
07:50:53,680 --> 07:50:55,680
No!

6439
07:50:55,680 --> 07:50:57,680
Right, fuck it, Hammer Time.

6440
07:50:57,680 --> 07:50:59,680
Discord, Hammer Time.

6441
07:50:59,680 --> 07:51:01,680
I just shit on my ass

6442
07:51:01,680 --> 07:51:03,680
and I put it on my face

6443
07:51:03,680 --> 07:51:05,680
because I need me

6444
07:51:05,680 --> 07:51:07,680
to press.

6445
07:51:07,680 --> 07:51:09,680
There's no way I just did that.

6446
07:51:09,680 --> 07:51:11,680
That was ridiculous.

6447
07:51:11,680 --> 07:51:13,680
Okay.

6448
07:51:13,680 --> 07:51:15,680
No, the hands...

6449
07:51:15,680 --> 07:51:17,680
Hands up, no.

6450
07:51:17,680 --> 07:51:19,680
Ash, go away!

6451
07:51:19,680 --> 07:51:21,680
Right, I'm backing off, I'm backing off.

6452
07:51:23,680 --> 07:51:25,680
It's so annoying.

6453
07:51:25,680 --> 07:51:27,680
Would you like a cold refreshment?

6454
07:51:27,680 --> 07:51:29,680
I want to ink.

6455
07:51:29,680 --> 07:51:31,680
I need to be able to ink in a minute.

6456
07:51:31,680 --> 07:51:33,680
I think that's what I need to be able to do now.

6457
07:51:33,680 --> 07:51:35,680
Right, we've de-mexed the diva.

6458
07:51:35,680 --> 07:51:37,680
Honestly.

6459
07:51:37,680 --> 07:51:39,680
Okay, I died,

6460
07:51:39,680 --> 07:51:41,680
but the ping saved my ult.

6461
07:51:43,680 --> 07:51:45,680
That would have been a decent...

6462
07:51:45,680 --> 07:51:47,680
That would have been a decent ult.

6463
07:51:47,680 --> 07:51:49,680
Oh!

6464
07:51:49,680 --> 07:51:51,680
The resentful of like,

6465
07:51:51,680 --> 07:51:53,680
appreciation.

6466
07:51:53,680 --> 07:51:55,680
I'm so sorry.

6467
07:51:55,680 --> 07:51:57,680
Okay, it's a hur.

6468
07:51:57,680 --> 07:51:59,680
A stone.

6469
07:51:59,680 --> 07:52:01,680
Uh, we better

6470
07:52:01,680 --> 07:52:03,680
in my life.

6471
07:52:03,680 --> 07:52:05,680
A wee bit of jelly in my life.

6472
07:52:05,680 --> 07:52:07,680
A wee bit of refland in my life.

6473
07:52:07,680 --> 07:52:09,680
A wee bit of tentacle in my life.

6474
07:52:09,680 --> 07:52:11,680
A wee bit of rape in my life.

6475
07:52:11,680 --> 07:52:13,680
I'm starting to lose it.

6476
07:52:13,680 --> 07:52:15,680
But not in a bad way, just in a...

6477
07:52:15,680 --> 07:52:17,680
I can feel myself get

6478
07:52:17,680 --> 07:52:19,680
very, very quite contrary.

6479
07:52:19,680 --> 07:52:21,680
Mary had a little one.

6480
07:52:21,680 --> 07:52:23,680
PING!

6481
07:52:29,680 --> 07:52:31,680
PING! Please, I'm begging ya.

6482
07:52:31,680 --> 07:52:33,680
I'm begging for a PING.

6483
07:52:33,680 --> 07:52:35,680
I'm just going to blame PING,

6484
07:52:35,680 --> 07:52:37,680
even though this is the best ping I've had.

6485
07:52:37,680 --> 07:52:39,680
180 latency.

6486
07:52:39,680 --> 07:52:41,680
Eating that bad.

6487
07:52:41,680 --> 07:52:43,680
I'm going to be honest, this is crazy.

6488
07:52:43,680 --> 07:52:45,680
I'm losing it.

6489
07:52:45,680 --> 07:52:47,680
A little bit.

6490
07:52:47,680 --> 07:52:49,680
But not in a bad way.

6491
07:52:49,680 --> 07:52:51,680
It's going to be weird.

6492
07:52:51,680 --> 07:52:53,680
I don't have any

6493
07:52:53,680 --> 07:52:55,680
gen mates to redirect into.

6494
07:52:55,680 --> 07:52:57,680
A wee bit of...

6495
07:52:57,680 --> 07:52:59,680
How can you come?

6496
07:52:59,680 --> 07:53:01,680
Mods, you know what to do.

6497
07:53:01,680 --> 07:53:03,680
Bruh, you're just...

6498
07:53:03,680 --> 07:53:05,680
You're begging for a...

6499
07:53:05,680 --> 07:53:07,680
Oh!

6500
07:53:07,680 --> 07:53:09,680
Right, one DPS down. Take your time.

6501
07:53:09,680 --> 07:53:11,680
Take your time. We've got it.

6502
07:53:11,680 --> 07:53:13,680
We've won this fight. I'm not even kidding. We've won this fight.

6503
07:53:13,680 --> 07:53:15,680
Right, I'm going to help put that up there for them.

6504
07:53:15,680 --> 07:53:17,680
That's a point.

6505
07:53:17,680 --> 07:53:19,680
Now get over it.

6506
07:53:19,680 --> 07:53:21,680
In there.

6507
07:53:21,680 --> 07:53:23,680
Okay, yeah.

6508
07:53:23,680 --> 07:53:25,680
As soon as you get your turret down at an advantage point,

6509
07:53:25,680 --> 07:53:27,680
it's ogre. Hydration check.

6510
07:53:31,680 --> 07:53:33,680
No!

6511
07:53:33,680 --> 07:53:35,680
Oh my god.

6512
07:53:35,680 --> 07:53:37,680
Right, momed down.

6513
07:53:37,680 --> 07:53:39,680
There we go.

6514
07:53:39,680 --> 07:53:41,680
There we go. We've got three minutes.

6515
07:53:41,680 --> 07:53:43,680
Maybe a cross platform raid.

6516
07:53:43,680 --> 07:53:45,680
A cross platform raid.

6517
07:53:47,680 --> 07:53:49,680
Oh!

6518
07:53:51,680 --> 07:53:53,680
That was rather rude, don't you think?

6519
07:53:55,680 --> 07:53:57,680
Nino, nino, nino!

6520
07:54:01,680 --> 07:54:03,680
Ah, this is a bit...

6521
07:54:03,680 --> 07:54:05,680
It's a bit too much.

6522
07:54:05,680 --> 07:54:07,680
A bit much.

6523
07:54:07,680 --> 07:54:09,680
Oh!

6524
07:54:11,680 --> 07:54:13,680
Hit one of the 360.

6525
07:54:13,680 --> 07:54:15,680
Just in case I'm playing the game, you know?

6526
07:54:15,680 --> 07:54:17,680
Go ahead and hit one of the 360.

6527
07:54:17,680 --> 07:54:19,680
Just in case it's me.

6528
07:54:19,680 --> 07:54:21,680
Just in case it's me.

6529
07:54:21,680 --> 07:54:23,680
The strontius I'm taking over.

6530
07:54:23,680 --> 07:54:25,680
I can brainwrote on this for hours.

6531
07:54:25,680 --> 07:54:27,680
I was so surprised since then she still plays this game.

6532
07:54:29,680 --> 07:54:31,680
I didn't think...

6533
07:54:31,680 --> 07:54:33,680
She played it.

6534
07:54:33,680 --> 07:54:35,680
But you learn something new every day, you know?

6535
07:54:37,680 --> 07:54:39,680
Time to let off some feet.

6536
07:54:39,680 --> 07:54:41,680
That's what I'm coming for.

6537
07:54:49,680 --> 07:54:51,680
Well, I didn't really...

6538
07:54:51,680 --> 07:54:53,680
get what...

6539
07:54:53,680 --> 07:54:55,680
Didn't he mind me likes?

6540
07:54:55,680 --> 07:54:57,680
Oh, didn't he mind me?

6541
07:54:57,680 --> 07:54:59,680
Oh, Zen, you cheeky boy.

6542
07:54:59,680 --> 07:55:01,680
Best I can do is repurpose European servers

6543
07:55:01,680 --> 07:55:03,680
at 1,500 ping-mini.

6544
07:55:07,680 --> 07:55:09,680
Literally.

6545
07:55:09,680 --> 07:55:11,680
Tiny spanish literally.

6546
07:55:11,680 --> 07:55:13,680
Honestly, I don't mind because you guys are carrying me.

6547
07:55:13,680 --> 07:55:15,680
That's the main thing.

6548
07:55:15,680 --> 07:55:17,680
Mummy, can we raid in the fire?

6549
07:55:17,680 --> 07:55:19,680
Of course you can get in the fire truck!

6550
07:55:19,680 --> 07:55:21,680
Beep beep!

6551
07:55:21,680 --> 07:55:23,680
I hear footsteps.

6552
07:55:23,680 --> 07:55:25,680
Oh, it's there.

6553
07:55:25,680 --> 07:55:27,680
Alright, I'm gonna...

6554
07:55:27,680 --> 07:55:29,680
I hear footsteps.

6555
07:55:31,680 --> 07:55:33,680
Oh!

6556
07:55:37,680 --> 07:55:39,680
What's going on?

6557
07:55:43,680 --> 07:55:45,680
Ash is up there, but I can't seem to get her.

6558
07:55:45,680 --> 07:55:47,680
Oh, she got healed.

6559
07:55:47,680 --> 07:55:49,680
Oh dear.

6560
07:55:53,680 --> 07:55:55,680
My turret is getting engaged, so I can't put it down.

6561
07:55:57,680 --> 07:56:01,680
My turret keeps getting engaged.

6562
07:56:01,680 --> 07:56:03,680
Congrats, wins the wedding.

6563
07:56:03,680 --> 07:56:05,680
But seriously though, right there.

6564
07:56:05,680 --> 07:56:07,680
Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.

6565
07:56:07,680 --> 07:56:09,680
You got team kill!

6566
07:56:09,680 --> 07:56:11,680
Right before the end!

6567
07:56:11,680 --> 07:56:13,680
Oh, that's diabolical.

6568
07:56:13,680 --> 07:56:15,680
Diabolical, that was fantastic gameplay.

6569
07:56:15,680 --> 07:56:17,680
Oh, diabolical.

6570
07:56:17,680 --> 07:56:19,680
Oh, and I've got enemy achievement as well.

6571
07:56:19,680 --> 07:56:21,680
GG, oh my god.

6572
07:56:21,680 --> 07:56:23,680
World Traveler, have I played enough of the map?

6573
07:56:23,680 --> 07:56:25,680
Oh my god.

6574
07:56:25,680 --> 07:56:27,680
Yeah!

6575
07:56:27,680 --> 07:56:29,680
Oh, I've not seen that intro.

6576
07:56:29,680 --> 07:56:31,680
Why is she purple?

6577
07:56:35,680 --> 07:56:37,680
Yeah, poggers on the tanks.

6578
07:56:37,680 --> 07:56:39,680
Most of what?

6579
07:56:39,680 --> 07:56:41,680
Brog.

6580
07:56:41,680 --> 07:56:43,680
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, they had a few bangers.

6581
07:56:43,680 --> 07:56:45,680
Wait, it wasn't me.

6582
07:56:45,680 --> 07:56:47,680
I couldn't hear anyone.

6583
07:56:47,680 --> 07:56:49,680
Oh, I was trying to talk.

6584
07:56:49,680 --> 07:56:51,680
Oh, I got sigma.

6585
07:56:51,680 --> 07:56:53,680
Right, I'm on my sigma balls.

6586
07:56:53,680 --> 07:56:55,680
I was trying to turn off my SFM labs.

6587
07:56:55,680 --> 07:56:57,680
What does that mean?

6588
07:56:57,680 --> 07:56:59,680
Right, we're gonna play sigma notes.

6589
07:56:59,680 --> 07:57:01,680
And then we're gonna do one more custom.

6590
07:57:01,680 --> 07:57:03,680
Yeah, I couldn't hear anyone.

6591
07:57:03,680 --> 07:57:05,680
Oh, sorry about that.

6592
07:57:05,680 --> 07:57:07,680
No, GG's, you guys did amazing.

6593
07:57:07,680 --> 07:57:09,680
Thank you for the play.

6594
07:57:09,680 --> 07:57:11,680
I'm doing custom after this next one if you want.

6595
07:57:11,680 --> 07:57:13,680
Tee hee.

6596
07:57:13,680 --> 07:57:15,680
Awesome stream.

6597
07:57:15,680 --> 07:57:17,680
Oh, yeah, you'll like the stream.

6598
07:57:17,680 --> 07:57:19,680
I bet you'd...

6599
07:57:19,680 --> 07:57:21,680
I should get removed.

6600
07:57:21,680 --> 07:57:23,680
Get removed, get removed.

6601
07:57:23,680 --> 07:57:25,680
Do you know how long it's gonna take me

6602
07:57:25,680 --> 07:57:27,680
to delete everyone on the friends list?

6603
07:57:29,680 --> 07:57:31,680
This has not had a...

6604
07:57:31,680 --> 07:57:33,680
No, don't...

6605
07:57:33,680 --> 07:57:35,680
I'm not ready to select a role.

6606
07:57:35,680 --> 07:57:37,680
Stop, back out, I need to add.

6607
07:57:39,680 --> 07:57:41,680
You.

6608
07:57:41,680 --> 07:57:43,680
You.

6609
07:57:45,680 --> 07:57:47,680
I'm just checking.

6610
07:57:47,680 --> 07:57:49,680
I'm just checking.

6611
07:57:49,680 --> 07:57:51,680
I'm going nuts over

6612
07:57:51,680 --> 07:57:53,680
Hidden Squad.

6613
07:57:53,680 --> 07:57:55,680
I feel like you've not been in, but you might have been in

6614
07:57:55,680 --> 07:57:57,680
because I've tried to keep getting you in.

6615
07:57:59,680 --> 07:58:01,680
Woody?

6616
07:58:05,680 --> 07:58:07,680
Oh, Woody?

6617
07:58:07,680 --> 07:58:09,680
Probably, I think.

6618
07:58:13,680 --> 07:58:15,680
What's the matter, baby?

6619
07:58:15,680 --> 07:58:17,680
I don't know.

6620
07:58:17,680 --> 07:58:19,680
Right, okay, last game and then we'll do custom

6621
07:58:19,680 --> 07:58:21,680
and then we'll start fighting again

6622
07:58:21,680 --> 07:58:23,680
and then I'm gonna wrap it up because unfortunately

6623
07:58:23,680 --> 07:58:25,680
I'm getting a wee bit tired now.

6624
07:58:25,680 --> 07:58:27,680
Shawnee, did you know a group of cuttlefish

6625
07:58:27,680 --> 07:58:29,680
is called a snuggle? Is that real?

6626
07:58:31,680 --> 07:58:33,680
What is a group

6627
07:58:33,680 --> 07:58:35,680
of cuttlefish called?

6628
07:58:39,680 --> 07:58:41,680
It actually is called a snuggle.

6629
07:58:41,680 --> 07:58:43,680
They're so adorable.

6630
07:58:43,680 --> 07:58:45,680
Haven't been queuing at the same time

6631
07:58:45,680 --> 07:58:47,680
even if we play a whole stream.

6632
07:58:47,680 --> 07:58:49,680
I don't know, yeah.

6633
07:58:49,680 --> 07:58:51,680
Be honest, I did that with Reinhardt.

6634
07:58:51,680 --> 07:58:53,680
We got the dub, so 10 out of 10.

6635
07:58:53,680 --> 07:58:55,680
Gameplay, fantastic.

6636
07:58:55,680 --> 07:58:57,680
Beautiful, gorgeous, stunning.

6637
07:58:57,680 --> 07:58:59,680
I'm playing sigma balls, so everyone back off, okay?

6638
07:58:59,680 --> 07:59:01,680
I'm playing sigma.

6639
07:59:01,680 --> 07:59:03,680
The universe.

6640
07:59:03,680 --> 07:59:05,680
It sings for me.

6641
07:59:05,680 --> 07:59:07,680
All she believed, the universe.

6642
07:59:07,680 --> 07:59:09,680
Singing for me. All she believed.

6643
07:59:09,680 --> 07:59:11,680
All she believed.

6644
07:59:11,680 --> 07:59:13,680
Oh, thank you, Belle.

6645
07:59:13,680 --> 07:59:15,680
Oh.

6646
07:59:15,680 --> 07:59:17,680
A wee bit bring up, just a little.

6647
07:59:17,680 --> 07:59:19,680
Ooh, ah, just a little bit.

6648
07:59:19,680 --> 07:59:21,680
Ooh, ah, just a little bit more.

6649
07:59:21,680 --> 07:59:23,680
Oh, cuddly snuggly.

6650
07:59:23,680 --> 07:59:25,680
Right, I'm gonna

6651
07:59:25,680 --> 07:59:27,680
remove the gamer tag.

6652
07:59:27,680 --> 07:59:29,680
Unpin message.

6653
07:59:29,680 --> 07:59:31,680
Yeah, because we're wrapping up

6654
07:59:31,680 --> 07:59:33,680
stream after this one.

6655
07:59:33,680 --> 07:59:35,680
Wrap up stream just like how I

6656
07:59:35,680 --> 07:59:37,680
wrap up my

6657
07:59:37,680 --> 07:59:39,680
job for the sea.

6658
07:59:39,680 --> 07:59:41,680
What the fuck are you even on about?

6659
07:59:41,680 --> 07:59:43,680
I don't know.

6660
07:59:43,680 --> 07:59:45,680
I don't know.

6661
07:59:45,680 --> 07:59:47,680
I don't know.

6662
07:59:47,680 --> 07:59:49,680
Is there anyone I can redirect into

6663
07:59:49,680 --> 07:59:51,680
even though

6664
07:59:51,680 --> 07:59:53,680
I've been a naughty girl.

6665
07:59:53,680 --> 07:59:55,680
I've been

6666
07:59:55,680 --> 07:59:57,680
reluctant to

6667
07:59:57,680 --> 07:59:59,680
redirect into anyone that isn't

6668
07:59:59,680 --> 08:00:01,680
the allure. I'm like, I shouldn't

6669
08:00:01,680 --> 08:00:03,680
be like that because that's so mean.

6670
08:00:03,680 --> 08:00:05,680
I'll redirect into people that are doing

6671
08:00:05,680 --> 08:00:07,680
ASMR collabs with me. Fuck it.

6672
08:00:07,680 --> 08:00:09,680
If you're gonna be nice and do a cheeky

6673
08:00:09,680 --> 08:00:11,680
ASMR collab with me, I'll

6674
08:00:11,680 --> 08:00:13,680
redirect into people.

6675
08:00:17,680 --> 08:00:19,680
Oh, there's no time to waste

6676
08:00:19,680 --> 08:00:21,680
all my tears and tears.

6677
08:00:21,680 --> 08:00:23,680
Okay.

6678
08:00:23,680 --> 08:00:25,680
Sigma sounds like he's craving in a

6679
08:00:25,680 --> 08:00:27,680
short to 90%. Wait.

6680
08:00:27,680 --> 08:00:29,680
Hello.

6681
08:00:29,680 --> 08:00:31,680
I wish I was

6682
08:00:31,680 --> 08:00:33,680
waiting to put a refund on the spot

6683
08:00:33,680 --> 08:00:35,680
and be like, say something or do this

6684
08:00:35,680 --> 08:00:37,680
or do that.

6685
08:00:37,680 --> 08:00:39,680
Oh!

6686
08:00:39,680 --> 08:00:41,680
You know in the next custom

6687
08:00:41,680 --> 08:00:43,680
mode, should I make them bark for heels?

6688
08:00:43,680 --> 08:00:45,680
No, I'm a really rusty Genji.

6689
08:00:45,680 --> 08:00:47,680
It's been a long time.

6690
08:00:47,680 --> 08:00:49,680
So what you're saying is

6691
08:00:49,680 --> 08:00:51,680
Nanoboost got it.

6692
08:00:51,680 --> 08:00:53,680
Loud and clear. Nanoboost it is

6693
08:00:53,680 --> 08:00:55,680
even though I'm gonna play Sigma.

6694
08:00:55,680 --> 08:00:57,680
Should I

6695
08:00:57,680 --> 08:00:59,680
degrade yourself for me?

6696
08:00:59,680 --> 08:01:01,680
Bark like a dog for heels refund?

6697
08:01:01,680 --> 08:01:03,680
Hell yeah.

6698
08:01:03,680 --> 08:01:05,680
That's terrible.

6699
08:01:05,680 --> 08:01:07,680
That is terrible.

6700
08:01:07,680 --> 08:01:09,680
These are inside thoughts that

6701
08:01:09,680 --> 08:01:11,680
should never come to the light of day.

6702
08:01:11,680 --> 08:01:13,680
And yet here I am.

6703
08:01:13,680 --> 08:01:15,680
Plotting already. I've not even

6704
08:01:15,680 --> 08:01:17,680
got into the next lobby.

6705
08:01:17,680 --> 08:01:19,680
I really do like Juno's design.

6706
08:01:19,680 --> 08:01:21,680
I like how she's fully covered but it's

6707
08:01:21,680 --> 08:01:23,680
skin tight.

6708
08:01:23,680 --> 08:01:25,680
Vacuum sealed like space itself.

6709
08:01:25,680 --> 08:01:27,680
That kind of makes sense.

6710
08:01:27,680 --> 08:01:29,680
Bark, bark.

6711
08:01:29,680 --> 08:01:31,680
Rusty sword carrier.

6712
08:01:31,680 --> 08:01:33,680
I used to watch

6713
08:01:33,680 --> 08:01:35,680
ASMR videos of knife cleaning.

6714
08:01:35,680 --> 08:01:37,680
Like I would take a rusty knife

6715
08:01:37,680 --> 08:01:39,680
and they would like brush it down

6716
08:01:39,680 --> 08:01:41,680
with this liquid and then keep doing it

6717
08:01:41,680 --> 08:01:43,680
over and over until all the brush went away.

6718
08:01:43,680 --> 08:01:45,680
It's like my time.

6719
08:01:45,680 --> 08:01:47,680
Ah yes, Antarctica.

6720
08:01:49,680 --> 08:01:51,680
Hydration.

6721
08:01:53,680 --> 08:01:55,680
Form fitting.

6722
08:01:55,680 --> 08:01:57,680
Form fitting 10 of 10. Hold on.

6723
08:02:03,680 --> 08:02:05,680
Hold on.

6724
08:02:07,680 --> 08:02:09,680
Ooh.

6725
08:02:11,680 --> 08:02:13,680
Listen here.

6726
08:02:13,680 --> 08:02:15,680
I thought I was so scared.

6727
08:02:15,680 --> 08:02:17,680
Oh they did it here.

6728
08:02:17,680 --> 08:02:19,680
I muted it too.

6729
08:02:19,680 --> 08:02:21,680
And then I said in game, I said pretend

6730
08:02:21,680 --> 08:02:23,680
I farted down the mic and none of them

6731
08:02:23,680 --> 08:02:25,680
said anything.

6732
08:02:25,680 --> 08:02:27,680
Reflins, you're supposed to.

6733
08:02:27,680 --> 08:02:29,680
I'm ready to get into trouble.

6734
08:02:29,680 --> 08:02:31,680
You're not in voice chat, Reflin.

6735
08:02:31,680 --> 08:02:33,680
Two Reflins aren't in voice chat.

6736
08:02:33,680 --> 08:02:35,680
They're so shy.

6737
08:02:35,680 --> 08:02:37,680
Right.

6738
08:02:37,680 --> 08:02:39,680
Sigma doesn't look like he's changed.

6739
08:02:39,680 --> 08:02:41,680
No.

6740
08:02:41,680 --> 08:02:43,680
He looks the same.

6741
08:02:43,680 --> 08:02:45,680
The setup looks the same. Shield looks the same.

6742
08:02:45,680 --> 08:02:47,680
Big rock.

6743
08:02:47,680 --> 08:02:49,680
If you think you are graduating this overwatch gaming session

6744
08:02:49,680 --> 08:02:51,680
without kissing my rock, you're welcome.

6745
08:02:51,680 --> 08:02:53,680
He's the same.

6746
08:02:55,680 --> 08:02:57,680
What do you mean being a...

6747
08:02:57,680 --> 08:02:59,680
Okay.

6748
08:02:59,680 --> 08:03:01,680
Oh my gosh.

6749
08:03:01,680 --> 08:03:03,680
They're so aggressive.

6750
08:03:03,680 --> 08:03:05,680
What did we do?

6751
08:03:05,680 --> 08:03:07,680
The objective is a risk.

6752
08:03:07,680 --> 08:03:09,680
Oh my god.

6753
08:03:09,680 --> 08:03:11,680
Wait, it's...

6754
08:03:11,680 --> 08:03:13,680
It needs to take this.

6755
08:03:13,680 --> 08:03:15,680
Oh yeah, the flash sombra as well.

6756
08:03:15,680 --> 08:03:17,680
Oh my god.

6757
08:03:17,680 --> 08:03:19,680
I am the worst tanker this.

6758
08:03:19,680 --> 08:03:21,680
Oh no.

6759
08:03:21,680 --> 08:03:23,680
Oh no.

6760
08:03:31,680 --> 08:03:33,680
I think

6761
08:03:33,680 --> 08:03:35,680
the fartlings are shy.

6762
08:03:35,680 --> 08:03:37,680
My joke.

6763
08:03:37,680 --> 08:03:39,680
I can hear her.

6764
08:03:41,680 --> 08:03:43,680
Oh wait, I'm the tank. Hold on. I need to go forward.

6765
08:03:43,680 --> 08:03:45,680
Hold on a minute. It's me that has to go forward.

6766
08:03:45,680 --> 08:03:47,680
Not my teammate.

6767
08:03:47,680 --> 08:03:49,680
What are you doing?

6768
08:03:51,680 --> 08:03:53,680
Oh my god.

6769
08:03:57,680 --> 08:03:59,680
Get out of the sky!

6770
08:03:59,680 --> 08:04:01,680
Right, they've only got one healer

6771
08:04:01,680 --> 08:04:03,680
but we are down to DPS.

6772
08:04:03,680 --> 08:04:05,680
Oh my gosh.

6773
08:04:05,680 --> 08:04:07,680
I can't even figure it out.

6774
08:04:07,680 --> 08:04:09,680
I can't.

6775
08:04:21,680 --> 08:04:23,680
Can you shove your granny off of us?

6776
08:04:23,680 --> 08:04:25,680
I just thought you should know that.

6777
08:04:25,680 --> 08:04:27,680
That's very important.

6778
08:04:27,680 --> 08:04:29,680
That you know about that nurse room.

6779
08:04:33,680 --> 08:04:35,680
They are literally spawn campingers.

6780
08:04:35,680 --> 08:04:37,680
That is how bad I'm doing as my job is a tank.

6781
08:04:37,680 --> 08:04:39,680
This is why I didn't touch tank with a 10 foot pole.

6782
08:04:39,680 --> 08:04:41,680
I used to be so confident

6783
08:04:41,680 --> 08:04:43,680
when it was 6v6 on Zarya and Rain.

6784
08:04:43,680 --> 08:04:45,680
I would always be the way Zarya

6785
08:04:45,680 --> 08:04:47,680
and then they changed it

6786
08:04:47,680 --> 08:04:49,680
and now I'm useless.

6787
08:04:49,680 --> 08:04:51,680
The game is about to finish.

6788
08:04:51,680 --> 08:04:53,680
I don't have my ult.

6789
08:04:53,680 --> 08:04:55,680
I've literally not even done my ult.

6790
08:04:55,680 --> 08:04:57,680
I don't know what to do.

6791
08:04:59,680 --> 08:05:01,680
The universe!

6792
08:05:01,680 --> 08:05:03,680
The universe!

6793
08:05:03,680 --> 08:05:05,680
The universe!

6794
08:05:05,680 --> 08:05:07,680
It's singing!

6795
08:05:07,680 --> 08:05:09,680
Right, I'm getting off this.

6796
08:05:09,680 --> 08:05:11,680
Sorry, I need to go on Zarya.

6797
08:05:11,680 --> 08:05:13,680
I...

6798
08:05:13,680 --> 08:05:15,680
I don't know who to go for.

6799
08:05:15,680 --> 08:05:17,680
Diesel?

6800
08:05:17,680 --> 08:05:19,680
Hmm, sorry.

6801
08:05:19,680 --> 08:05:21,680
I just feel confident.

6802
08:05:21,680 --> 08:05:23,680
I'm having a six tonight.

6803
08:05:27,680 --> 08:05:29,680
I love that song.

6804
08:05:29,680 --> 08:05:31,680
My mum used to sing that to me.

6805
08:05:31,680 --> 08:05:33,680
I can't believe it.

6806
08:05:33,680 --> 08:05:35,680
I can't believe everything isn't just an instant win.

6807
08:05:35,680 --> 08:05:37,680
Much sing.

6808
08:05:37,680 --> 08:05:39,680
But we're going to do a custom game after this.

6809
08:05:39,680 --> 08:05:41,680
And I'm going to show you how it is.

6810
08:05:41,680 --> 08:05:43,680
I'm going to show you how it is.

6811
08:05:43,680 --> 08:05:45,680
You think my muscles are pretty.

6812
08:05:45,680 --> 08:05:47,680
Pretty weak.

6813
08:05:47,680 --> 08:05:49,680
Pretty weak.

6814
08:05:49,680 --> 08:05:51,680
I'm sorry, I'm so strong.

6815
08:05:51,680 --> 08:05:53,680
I'm going to go chase Neil Pulse on real and true.

6816
08:05:53,680 --> 08:05:55,680
She's such a girl's girl.

6817
08:05:55,680 --> 08:05:57,680
I'm a tank main but mainly

6818
08:05:57,680 --> 08:05:59,680
Rain, Ball, Winston.

6819
08:05:59,680 --> 08:06:01,680
I cannot even do nervous noises

6820
08:06:01,680 --> 08:06:03,680
for what comes next.

6821
08:06:03,680 --> 08:06:05,680
I can't even do

6822
08:06:05,680 --> 08:06:07,680
10% battery on heads.

6823
08:06:07,680 --> 08:06:09,680
You never charged it!

6824
08:06:09,680 --> 08:06:11,680
I can't believe you didn't charge our heads

6825
08:06:11,680 --> 08:06:13,680
to play with mummies.

6826
08:06:13,680 --> 08:06:15,680
Right, let's

6827
08:06:15,680 --> 08:06:17,680
see how we

6828
08:06:17,680 --> 08:06:19,680
figure out with it.

6829
08:06:21,680 --> 08:06:23,680
Right, I was hoping to get

6830
08:06:23,680 --> 08:06:25,680
a wee bit more, but I've just killed her

6831
08:06:25,680 --> 08:06:27,680
because I'm not even kidding.

6832
08:06:27,680 --> 08:06:29,680
I've just killed her because

6833
08:06:29,680 --> 08:06:31,680
of my selfishness.

6834
08:06:39,680 --> 08:06:41,680
I think I'm just

6835
08:06:41,680 --> 08:06:43,680
bad at being true.

6836
08:06:47,680 --> 08:06:49,680
I'm trying.

6837
08:06:49,680 --> 08:06:51,680
Okay, okay.

6838
08:06:51,680 --> 08:06:53,680
This is what I need.

6839
08:06:53,680 --> 08:06:55,680
Give me a wee bit of energy and watch what happens.

6840
08:06:55,680 --> 08:06:57,680
I'm unfortunately out of heals.

6841
08:06:57,680 --> 08:06:59,680
But I just need a wee bit.

6842
08:06:59,680 --> 08:07:01,680
I love your thumb.

6843
08:07:01,680 --> 08:07:03,680
Aw!

6844
08:07:03,680 --> 08:07:05,680
Aw, thank you

6845
08:07:05,680 --> 08:07:07,680
for the super chat.

6846
08:07:07,680 --> 08:07:09,680
I'm glad you like the thumb. Do you like that I'm Reinhardt

6847
08:07:09,680 --> 08:07:11,680
and then I've not played Reinhardt once for this entire

6848
08:07:11,680 --> 08:07:13,680
8-hour stream?

6849
08:07:13,680 --> 08:07:15,680
Do you find that cute? Do you find that adorable?

6850
08:07:15,680 --> 08:07:17,680
Do you find that

6851
08:07:17,680 --> 08:07:19,680
naughty?

6852
08:07:19,680 --> 08:07:21,680
Have I been a bad girl

6853
08:07:21,680 --> 08:07:23,680
because I've not played Reinhardt?

6854
08:07:23,680 --> 08:07:25,680
Thank you, FMV.

6855
08:07:25,680 --> 08:07:27,680
I'm very kind of you.

6856
08:07:29,680 --> 08:07:31,680
Bruh, we're getting massacred.

6857
08:07:31,680 --> 08:07:33,680
They're coming for...

6858
08:07:33,680 --> 08:07:35,680
They're coming for me.

6859
08:07:37,680 --> 08:07:39,680
Okay, let me...

6860
08:07:39,680 --> 08:07:41,680
Let's retry that again.

6861
08:07:45,680 --> 08:07:47,680
I'm the silly Genji.

6862
08:07:47,680 --> 08:07:49,680
I can protect you!

6863
08:07:49,680 --> 08:07:51,680
I can protect...

6864
08:07:51,680 --> 08:07:53,680
Right, go top left. Go here.

6865
08:07:53,680 --> 08:07:55,680
No, don't. There's a fucking...

6866
08:07:55,680 --> 08:07:57,680
Winston here.

6867
08:07:57,680 --> 08:07:59,680
Okay, I'm high level

6868
08:07:59,680 --> 08:08:01,680
for once. I can go for Juno.

6869
08:08:03,680 --> 08:08:05,680
Please, that Juno is so...

6870
08:08:05,680 --> 08:08:07,680
gonna get it.

6871
08:08:09,680 --> 08:08:11,680
I'm 100 energy

6872
08:08:11,680 --> 08:08:13,680
and can do nothing with it.

6873
08:08:13,680 --> 08:08:15,680
I'm about to...

6874
08:08:19,680 --> 08:08:21,680
I'm...

6875
08:08:21,680 --> 08:08:23,680
Right, no.

6876
08:08:23,680 --> 08:08:25,680
Don't let yourself give into that

6877
08:08:25,680 --> 08:08:27,680
mentality. I'm an asset

6878
08:08:27,680 --> 08:08:29,680
to my team.

6879
08:08:29,680 --> 08:08:31,680
Even if the tank is the most

6880
08:08:31,680 --> 08:08:33,680
pivotable...

6881
08:08:33,680 --> 08:08:35,680
Pivotable member

6882
08:08:35,680 --> 08:08:37,680
of the team, okay?

6883
08:08:37,680 --> 08:08:39,680
And I might be

6884
08:08:39,680 --> 08:08:41,680
being an absolute detriment,

6885
08:08:41,680 --> 08:08:43,680
but I'm a good girl, okay?

6886
08:08:43,680 --> 08:08:45,680
I'm trying my best.

6887
08:08:45,680 --> 08:08:47,680
That's the main thing, right?

6888
08:08:49,680 --> 08:08:51,680
Why is she doing that?

6889
08:08:51,680 --> 08:08:53,680
A bra.

6890
08:09:01,680 --> 08:09:03,680
I don't...

6891
08:09:03,680 --> 08:09:05,680
Bob, if you could go way right now,

6892
08:09:05,680 --> 08:09:07,680
that'd be great.

6893
08:09:07,680 --> 08:09:09,680
No, I think...

6894
08:09:09,680 --> 08:09:11,680
No!

6895
08:09:11,680 --> 08:09:13,680
They dead.

6896
08:09:15,680 --> 08:09:17,680
Genji, they dead!

6897
08:09:17,680 --> 08:09:19,680
Yeah!

6898
08:09:19,680 --> 08:09:21,680
A wee bit, it's fine.

6899
08:09:21,680 --> 08:09:23,680
Hello, Henry.

6900
08:09:23,680 --> 08:09:25,680
No, I'm Irish. I'm Scottish.

6901
08:09:25,680 --> 08:09:27,680
They don't have a Scottish Overwatch hero

6902
08:09:27,680 --> 08:09:29,680
yet.

6903
08:09:29,680 --> 08:09:31,680
Because they better.

6904
08:09:33,680 --> 08:09:35,680
Alright, I'm using all...

6905
08:09:35,680 --> 08:09:37,680
Fuck this.

6906
08:09:37,680 --> 08:09:39,680
Well, their healers

6907
08:09:39,680 --> 08:09:41,680
are down, so that's the good news.

6908
08:09:43,680 --> 08:09:45,680
They don't have heals,

6909
08:09:45,680 --> 08:09:47,680
but they do have tails.

6910
08:09:47,680 --> 08:09:49,680
I'm so sorry.

6911
08:09:49,680 --> 08:09:51,680
I can only say I'm sorry.

6912
08:09:51,680 --> 08:09:53,680
I can only say I'm sorry.

6913
08:09:53,680 --> 08:09:55,680
It's not happening.

6914
08:09:55,680 --> 08:09:57,680
I'm not.

6915
08:09:57,680 --> 08:09:59,680
I'm rubbish.

6916
08:09:59,680 --> 08:10:01,680
Right, get me off a tank. I'm never again.

6917
08:10:01,680 --> 08:10:03,680
Like, I don't know what it is.

6918
08:10:03,680 --> 08:10:05,680
As soon as you're born with XX chromosome,

6919
08:10:05,680 --> 08:10:07,680
boom, tanks are just impossible.

6920
08:10:07,680 --> 08:10:09,680
Healing, absolutely fine.

6921
08:10:09,680 --> 08:10:11,680
DPS, maybe.

6922
08:10:11,680 --> 08:10:13,680
Let's be honest.

6923
08:10:13,680 --> 08:10:15,680
But yeah, tanks just out of the fucking DNA.

6924
08:10:15,680 --> 08:10:17,680
Oh!

6925
08:10:17,680 --> 08:10:19,680
Oh!

6926
08:10:19,680 --> 08:10:21,680
Right, let me do the custom game mode.

6927
08:10:31,680 --> 08:10:33,680
What was the code?

6928
08:10:33,680 --> 08:10:35,680
I wrote it down. I wrote the code down.

6929
08:10:35,680 --> 08:10:37,680
For the custom lobby.

6930
08:10:37,680 --> 08:10:39,680
Right, get in my lobby.

6931
08:10:39,680 --> 08:10:41,680
Get in my...

6932
08:10:41,680 --> 08:10:43,680
No, don't read queue. Just continue.

6933
08:10:43,680 --> 08:10:45,680
Stop with everything. Stop! There's too much going on.

6934
08:10:45,680 --> 08:10:47,680
Right, I need to...

6935
08:10:47,680 --> 08:10:49,680
Come up to group here.

6936
08:10:49,680 --> 08:10:51,680
I need to remove group.

6937
08:10:51,680 --> 08:10:53,680
And then...

6938
08:10:53,680 --> 08:10:55,680
I need to play a custom...

6939
08:10:55,680 --> 08:10:57,680
Nice.

6940
08:10:57,680 --> 08:10:59,680
You didn't mean it, bless you.

6941
08:10:59,680 --> 08:11:01,680
Create.

6942
08:11:01,680 --> 08:11:03,680
Sentence.

6943
08:11:03,680 --> 08:11:05,680
Import code. Copy and paste.

6944
08:11:05,680 --> 08:11:07,680
Okay, lobby.

6945
08:11:07,680 --> 08:11:09,680
Make sure... Oh, my chat is on.

6946
08:11:09,680 --> 08:11:11,680
Right, and now what?

6947
08:11:11,680 --> 08:11:13,680
Fucking hell, you guys stream snipe fast.

6948
08:11:13,680 --> 08:11:15,680
Right.

6949
08:11:15,680 --> 08:11:17,680
And then we need six enemies.

6950
08:11:17,680 --> 08:11:19,680
Okay, we have one enemy.

6951
08:11:19,680 --> 08:11:21,680
I tried to join and invited instead.

6952
08:11:23,680 --> 08:11:25,680
Oh, I think...

6953
08:11:25,680 --> 08:11:27,680
Wait, can you guys not see it unless you're coming like this?

6954
08:11:29,680 --> 08:11:31,680
It mustn't be.

6955
08:11:33,680 --> 08:11:35,680
What is Johnny's balance?

6956
08:11:35,680 --> 08:11:37,680
I'm so sorry. I'm literally about to go offline.

6957
08:11:37,680 --> 08:11:39,680
This is my last match.

6958
08:11:41,680 --> 08:11:43,680
I'm so sorry.

6959
08:11:43,680 --> 08:11:45,680
You have such bad timing.

6960
08:11:45,680 --> 08:11:47,680
I've been playing for eight hours.

6961
08:11:47,680 --> 08:11:49,680
I'm sorry.

6962
08:11:49,680 --> 08:11:51,680
Develop memory glands.

6963
08:11:51,680 --> 08:11:53,680
What?

6964
08:11:53,680 --> 08:11:55,680
I'm silver five, so you go to the game trust.

6965
08:12:01,680 --> 08:12:03,680
I did the same thing.

6966
08:12:03,680 --> 08:12:05,680
Whoopsies, the last match.

6967
08:12:05,680 --> 08:12:07,680
I'm so sorry. Whoever gets in, gets in.

6968
08:12:07,680 --> 08:12:09,680
Whatever will be, will be.

6969
08:12:13,680 --> 08:12:15,680
I think he hasn't played left.

6970
08:12:15,680 --> 08:12:17,680
I don't know.

6971
08:12:17,680 --> 08:12:19,680
Is it Chuck E. Cheese?

6972
08:12:19,680 --> 08:12:21,680
I think it might be you that's not played.

6973
08:12:21,680 --> 08:12:23,680
Right, we're just going to do it.

6974
08:12:23,680 --> 08:12:25,680
Everybody, let's get to it.

6975
08:12:25,680 --> 08:12:27,680
Whoever's in the team's in the team.

6976
08:12:27,680 --> 08:12:29,680
Whoever's not...

6977
08:12:29,680 --> 08:12:31,680
Not a spectator.

6978
08:12:31,680 --> 08:12:33,680
I'm sorry.

6979
08:12:33,680 --> 08:12:35,680
Would you say...

6980
08:12:38,680 --> 08:12:40,680
It's going to take me so long

6981
08:12:40,680 --> 08:12:42,680
to unfriend everyone.

6982
08:12:42,680 --> 08:12:44,680
But I've never seen my friends look so full before.

6983
08:12:44,680 --> 08:12:46,680
That was actually, I have to admit, that's actually really cool.

6984
08:12:46,680 --> 08:12:48,680
I've never seen it so full before.

6985
08:12:48,680 --> 08:12:50,680
Feel like my...

6986
08:12:52,680 --> 08:12:54,680
Not my belly, because I'm not eating.

6987
08:12:54,680 --> 08:12:56,680
Holy shit!

6988
08:12:56,680 --> 08:12:59,680
I forgot to eat yesterday and to do.

6989
08:13:03,680 --> 08:13:05,680
I've only had liquid.

6990
08:13:05,680 --> 08:13:07,680
I ate a bag of crisps yesterday

6991
08:13:07,680 --> 08:13:09,680
because I forgot to eat

6992
08:13:09,680 --> 08:13:11,680
and I've started stream

6993
08:13:11,680 --> 08:13:13,680
and I forgot to eat

6994
08:13:13,680 --> 08:13:15,680
and it's been eight hours as well.

6995
08:13:16,680 --> 08:13:18,680
Oh.

6996
08:13:18,680 --> 08:13:20,680
I'm really not that wise.

6997
08:13:22,680 --> 08:13:24,680
I'm really not that wise.

6998
08:13:27,680 --> 08:13:29,680
I just...

6999
08:13:29,680 --> 08:13:31,680
That just hurt me.

7000
08:13:31,680 --> 08:13:33,680
Okay, let me go and match up.

7001
08:13:33,680 --> 08:13:35,680
I can't shite.

7002
08:13:35,680 --> 08:13:37,680
None of my friends are match.

7003
08:13:37,680 --> 08:13:39,680
I can't shite.

7004
08:13:39,680 --> 08:13:41,680
I'll eat.

7005
08:13:41,680 --> 08:13:43,680
I'll eat after this game.

7006
08:13:43,680 --> 08:13:45,680
Left shift, run.

7007
08:13:45,680 --> 08:13:47,680
Oh!

7008
08:13:47,680 --> 08:13:49,680
The turning.

7009
08:13:49,680 --> 08:13:51,680
Absolutely not.

7010
08:13:51,680 --> 08:13:53,680
What's E?

7011
08:13:53,680 --> 08:13:55,680
Burning heal?

7012
08:13:55,680 --> 08:13:57,680
I heal on the enemy.

7013
08:13:57,680 --> 08:13:59,680
Nearby allies take reduction damage

7014
08:13:59,680 --> 08:14:01,680
and heal by dealing.

7015
08:14:01,680 --> 08:14:03,680
What?

7016
08:14:03,680 --> 08:14:05,680
That's like a healer's pat.

7017
08:14:05,680 --> 08:14:07,680
Am I going mental?

7018
08:14:07,680 --> 08:14:09,680
What does this do?

7019
08:14:09,680 --> 08:14:11,680
I don't know.

7020
08:14:11,680 --> 08:14:13,680
I don't know.

7021
08:14:13,680 --> 08:14:15,680
What am I doing?

7022
08:14:15,680 --> 08:14:17,680
Wait, I need to...

7023
08:14:17,680 --> 08:14:19,680
Oh, you need to hold them both down?

7024
08:14:19,680 --> 08:14:21,680
Sorry, hold on.

7025
08:14:23,680 --> 08:14:25,680
I'm spraying.

7026
08:14:25,680 --> 08:14:27,680
Oh, I didn't mean to rush into that.

7027
08:14:27,680 --> 08:14:29,680
I'm so sorry.

7028
08:14:29,680 --> 08:14:31,680
I just ran into the enemy team.

7029
08:14:33,680 --> 08:14:35,680
There's no getting out of that one.

7030
08:14:35,680 --> 08:14:37,680
That was just...

7031
08:14:37,680 --> 08:14:39,680
That was just me.

7032
08:14:39,680 --> 08:14:41,680
If you shoot left,

7033
08:14:41,680 --> 08:14:43,680
until it's burning every shot,

7034
08:14:43,680 --> 08:14:45,680
the headshot...

7035
08:14:45,680 --> 08:14:47,680
What?

7036
08:14:49,680 --> 08:14:51,680
Huh. It feels very spray.

7037
08:14:55,680 --> 08:14:57,680
Damn, our D.Va don't give a fuck.

7038
08:14:57,680 --> 08:14:59,680
She can bolt.

7039
08:14:59,680 --> 08:15:01,680
You're coming.

7040
08:15:03,680 --> 08:15:05,680
A starkish powder.

7041
08:15:09,680 --> 08:15:11,680
Did I eat anything on the stream?

7042
08:15:11,680 --> 08:15:13,680
Did I chew anything?

7043
08:15:13,680 --> 08:15:15,680
I'm actually the better tank.

7044
08:15:15,680 --> 08:15:17,680
No, stop it.

7045
08:15:17,680 --> 08:15:19,680
No, I haven't eaten anything.

7046
08:15:19,680 --> 08:15:21,680
I've only had liquids.

7047
08:15:21,680 --> 08:15:23,680
Huge tip, don't die.

7048
08:15:23,680 --> 08:15:25,680
Five head, honestly.

7049
08:15:27,680 --> 08:15:29,680
Right, so I have mobility

7050
08:15:29,680 --> 08:15:31,680
to go like this.

7051
08:15:31,680 --> 08:15:33,680
Okay.

7052
08:15:33,680 --> 08:15:35,680
Oh, it doesn't go on forever.

7053
08:15:35,680 --> 08:15:37,680
It's not like Reinhardt.

7054
08:15:37,680 --> 08:15:39,680
Oh, no, they didn't.

7055
08:15:39,680 --> 08:15:41,680
Stop that robot.

7056
08:15:45,680 --> 08:15:47,680
I'm spraying.

7057
08:15:47,680 --> 08:15:49,680
I'm just spraying.

7058
08:15:49,680 --> 08:15:51,680
Is that an enemy widow?

7059
08:15:53,680 --> 08:15:55,680
When did you

7060
08:15:55,680 --> 08:15:57,680
become a widow?

7061
08:15:57,680 --> 08:15:59,680
Yeah, they have a widow.

7062
08:15:59,680 --> 08:16:01,680
Rub.

7063
08:16:01,680 --> 08:16:03,680
Speaking of the widow,

7064
08:16:03,680 --> 08:16:05,680
I think she just sniped me.

7065
08:16:05,680 --> 08:16:07,680
Another huge tip.

7066
08:16:07,680 --> 08:16:09,680
Shoot the other team right.

7067
08:16:09,680 --> 08:16:11,680
Left gun, burn,

7068
08:16:11,680 --> 08:16:13,680
right does crit.

7069
08:16:13,680 --> 08:16:15,680
End people's burning.

7070
08:16:15,680 --> 08:16:17,680
So I just combo them, right?

7071
08:16:17,680 --> 08:16:19,680
He heals you if you shoot burn at him.

7072
08:16:21,680 --> 08:16:23,680
Oh, my gosh.

7073
08:16:23,680 --> 08:16:25,680
I actually interspawn.

7074
08:16:27,680 --> 08:16:29,680
What do I do?

7075
08:16:29,680 --> 08:16:31,680
What do I do?

7076
08:16:31,680 --> 08:16:33,680
Oh, my God.

7077
08:16:33,680 --> 08:16:35,680
No, I can't leave this on a freaking law.

7078
08:16:35,680 --> 08:16:37,680
Are you serious?

7079
08:16:37,680 --> 08:16:39,680
I can't.

7080
08:16:39,680 --> 08:16:41,680
I can't even have this on a law.

7081
08:16:41,680 --> 08:16:43,680
Sorry, I don't, I won't tolerate it.

7082
08:16:45,680 --> 08:16:47,680
We're doing another one.

7083
08:16:47,680 --> 08:16:49,680
I refuse.

7084
08:16:49,680 --> 08:16:51,680
No!

7085
08:16:51,680 --> 08:16:53,680
Flynn!

7086
08:16:53,680 --> 08:16:55,680
You knew exactly what I was going to try and do.

7087
08:16:55,680 --> 08:16:57,680
Oh, my God.

7088
08:16:57,680 --> 08:16:59,680
Right now, going again.

7089
08:16:59,680 --> 08:17:01,680
I refuse to leave on a law.

7090
08:17:01,680 --> 08:17:03,680
Sorry, I can't carry.

7091
08:17:03,680 --> 08:17:05,680
No, you can't carry that.

7092
08:17:05,680 --> 08:17:07,680
I was doing absolutely terrible.

7093
08:17:07,680 --> 08:17:09,680
I'm playing characters.

7094
08:17:09,680 --> 08:17:11,680
What is that?

7095
08:17:11,680 --> 08:17:13,680
What is that?

7096
08:17:13,680 --> 08:17:15,680
A bug.

7097
08:17:15,680 --> 08:17:17,680
Why are you a bug in my Overwatch match?

7098
08:17:17,680 --> 08:17:19,680
A bug.

7099
08:17:19,680 --> 08:17:21,680
I'm doing backflips and stuff on this game.

7100
08:17:21,680 --> 08:17:23,680
Right, no.

7101
08:17:23,680 --> 08:17:25,680
Whoever was on the team, everyone out.

7102
08:17:25,680 --> 08:17:27,680
And the new ones in.

7103
08:17:27,680 --> 08:17:29,680
I'm not leaving on a freaking negative team.

7104
08:17:29,680 --> 08:17:31,680
No, I refuse.

7105
08:17:33,680 --> 08:17:35,680
How are you psychological?

7106
08:17:35,680 --> 08:17:37,680
Law or fear?

7107
08:17:37,680 --> 08:17:39,680
I'm not even kidding.

7108
08:17:39,680 --> 08:17:41,680
Right, if you're in, you're getting swapped out.

7109
08:17:41,680 --> 08:17:43,680
Oh, God, everyone's swapping.

7110
08:17:43,680 --> 08:17:45,680
Right, okay.

7111
08:17:45,680 --> 08:17:47,680
I'm out of play.

7112
08:17:47,680 --> 08:17:49,680
We're going to play King's Row and Winter.

7113
08:17:49,680 --> 08:17:51,680
Oh, my God, it's the Christmas.

7114
08:17:51,680 --> 08:17:53,680
I'm so excited to spend Christmas with you.

7115
08:17:53,680 --> 08:17:55,680
Oh, my God.

7116
08:17:55,680 --> 08:17:57,680
I can't wait to watch all the movies together.

7117
08:17:57,680 --> 08:17:59,680
I'm going to get so many snacks.

7118
08:17:59,680 --> 08:18:01,680
I'm going to be munching

7119
08:18:01,680 --> 08:18:03,680
like a little hamster.

7120
08:18:03,680 --> 08:18:05,680
How the fuck did you find it?

7121
08:18:05,680 --> 08:18:07,680
How did you find it?

7122
08:18:07,680 --> 08:18:09,680
I deleted it.

7123
08:18:09,680 --> 08:18:11,680
Right, how did I put enemies on that?

7124
08:18:11,680 --> 08:18:13,680
I haven't been in.

7125
08:18:13,680 --> 08:18:15,680
Who hasn't been in?

7126
08:18:15,680 --> 08:18:17,680
Who...

7127
08:18:17,680 --> 08:18:19,680
Who wasn't in?

7128
08:18:19,680 --> 08:18:21,680
Oh, God.

7129
08:18:23,680 --> 08:18:25,680
Would you woo me in?

7130
08:18:25,680 --> 08:18:27,680
Cheese, I think.

7131
08:18:27,680 --> 08:18:29,680
I pulled you in.

7132
08:18:29,680 --> 08:18:31,680
It's all blurring together.

7133
08:18:31,680 --> 08:18:33,680
Oh, my God.

7134
08:18:35,680 --> 08:18:37,680
Does that seem right?

7135
08:18:37,680 --> 08:18:39,680
I was in last game.

7136
08:18:39,680 --> 08:18:41,680
So who wasn't?

7137
08:18:41,680 --> 08:18:43,680
I've got...

7138
08:18:47,680 --> 08:18:49,680
You slag.

7139
08:18:49,680 --> 08:18:51,680
Oh, I said I was not.

7140
08:18:51,680 --> 08:18:53,680
All right, well, be careful with your words then

7141
08:18:53,680 --> 08:18:55,680
because you know I can't read.

7142
08:18:55,680 --> 08:18:57,680
Yeah, you better have panicked.

7143
08:18:57,680 --> 08:18:59,680
That's right, you better have panicked.

7144
08:18:59,680 --> 08:19:01,680
Honor system, are we happy?

7145
08:19:01,680 --> 08:19:03,680
Don't pull me, I was in last game.

7146
08:19:03,680 --> 08:19:05,680
Okay.

7147
08:19:05,680 --> 08:19:07,680
Honor system, was anyone here from last game?

7148
08:19:07,680 --> 08:19:09,680
Is it Sombra?

7149
08:19:09,680 --> 08:19:11,680
You can swap for me?

7150
08:19:11,680 --> 08:19:13,680
Did you have a shot last time?

7151
08:19:13,680 --> 08:19:15,680
I don't think you've had a shot.

7152
08:19:17,680 --> 08:19:19,680
Wait, there was another message.

7153
08:19:19,680 --> 08:19:21,680
I wasn't in last game.

7154
08:19:21,680 --> 08:19:23,680
Yeah, I was already in.

7155
08:19:23,680 --> 08:19:25,680
Okay, thank you for the honor system.

7156
08:19:25,680 --> 08:19:27,680
I said was me.

7157
08:19:27,680 --> 08:19:29,680
Isn't that Scottish for it was?

7158
08:19:29,680 --> 08:19:31,680
Yeah, but I can't read in general.

7159
08:19:31,680 --> 08:19:33,680
I've been reading words all day.

7160
08:19:33,680 --> 08:19:35,680
My brain needs to shut down.

7161
08:19:35,680 --> 08:19:37,680
Right.

7162
08:19:37,680 --> 08:19:39,680
Okay, we're going to win.

7163
08:19:41,680 --> 08:19:43,680
I asked Father Christmas

7164
08:19:43,680 --> 08:19:45,680
to bless me from above

7165
08:19:45,680 --> 08:19:47,680
to guide my reeflings

7166
08:19:47,680 --> 08:19:49,680
and my team

7167
08:19:49,680 --> 08:19:51,680
to enable us

7168
08:19:51,680 --> 08:19:53,680
to defend

7169
08:19:53,680 --> 08:19:55,680
successfully on Torbjorn.

7170
08:19:57,680 --> 08:19:59,680
Can't wait to finally spend Christmas with my mom.

7171
08:19:59,680 --> 08:20:01,680
I'm going to make you sing Christmas carols with me.

7172
08:20:01,680 --> 08:20:03,680
I'm going to make you sing Jesus music and stuff.

7173
08:20:05,680 --> 08:20:07,680
Oh.

7174
08:20:09,680 --> 08:20:11,680
Oh.

7175
08:20:11,680 --> 08:20:13,680
The bells of heaven are ringing.

7176
08:20:19,680 --> 08:20:21,680
It was such a joy knocking heads at the end.

7177
08:20:21,680 --> 08:20:23,680
That was you.

7178
08:20:23,680 --> 08:20:25,680
You knew exactly what I was going to do.

7179
08:20:25,680 --> 08:20:27,680
I was going to try and run on to the point

7180
08:20:27,680 --> 08:20:29,680
so we could stall for a bit more time.

7181
08:20:29,680 --> 08:20:31,680
Hypnotize the opposing reeflings

7182
08:20:31,680 --> 08:20:33,680
to let you win.

7183
08:20:33,680 --> 08:20:35,680
I'm not boisterous.

7184
08:20:35,680 --> 08:20:37,680
No, that's it.

7185
08:20:37,680 --> 08:20:39,680
You're getting my reeflings and the enemy team

7186
08:20:39,680 --> 08:20:41,680
you will not best me.

7187
08:20:41,680 --> 08:20:43,680
I'm winning. This is psychological warfare.

7188
08:20:43,680 --> 08:20:45,680
Oh my god!

7189
08:20:47,680 --> 08:20:49,680
That fucking Reinhardt!

7190
08:20:49,680 --> 08:20:51,680
Oh my gosh.

7191
08:20:51,680 --> 08:20:53,680
Oh my gosh.

7192
08:20:53,680 --> 08:20:55,680
Hold on.

7193
08:20:55,680 --> 08:20:57,680
I can't save you if you're up there.

7194
08:20:57,680 --> 08:20:59,680
Okay, there is a somber creeper around unfortunately.

7195
08:20:59,680 --> 08:21:01,680
Did you see that Reinhardt?

7196
08:21:03,680 --> 08:21:05,680
He was pressing double.

7197
08:21:05,680 --> 08:21:07,680
No, I don't think so.

7198
08:21:07,680 --> 08:21:09,680
Get out of here.

7199
08:21:09,680 --> 08:21:11,680
Get out of here.

7200
08:21:11,680 --> 08:21:13,680
Oh my god.

7201
08:21:17,680 --> 08:21:19,680
Reinhardt!

7202
08:21:19,680 --> 08:21:21,680
Stop!

7203
08:21:21,680 --> 08:21:23,680
My Christmas with the reef.

7204
08:21:23,680 --> 08:21:25,680
Do you think the Reinhardt won me?

7205
08:21:29,680 --> 08:21:31,680
Hold on a minute.

7206
08:21:31,680 --> 08:21:33,680
Reinhardt, stop coming for me.

7207
08:21:33,680 --> 08:21:35,680
You're throwing for your team.

7208
08:21:35,680 --> 08:21:37,680
You need time for your teams.

7209
08:21:37,680 --> 08:21:39,680
You're throwing.

7210
08:21:39,680 --> 08:21:41,680
Don't you want to win?

7211
08:21:41,680 --> 08:21:43,680
Huh?

7212
08:21:43,680 --> 08:21:45,680
Or are you really okay with Dom loss

7213
08:21:45,680 --> 08:21:47,680
from someone that's five foot three?

7214
08:21:47,680 --> 08:21:49,680
Ha ha.

7215
08:21:49,680 --> 08:21:51,680
Reinhardt, you wanted the smoke.

7216
08:21:51,680 --> 08:21:53,680
Oh my god.

7217
08:21:53,680 --> 08:21:55,680
I'm almost tied up with family most Christmas.

7218
08:21:55,680 --> 08:21:57,680
What I'm doing.

7219
08:21:57,680 --> 08:21:59,680
You don't want somber!

7220
08:21:59,680 --> 08:22:01,680
Oh!

7221
08:22:01,680 --> 08:22:03,680
Oh my god.

7222
08:22:03,680 --> 08:22:05,680
Get Reinhardt.

7223
08:22:05,680 --> 08:22:07,680
See all that hard work you put into that kill somber.

7224
08:22:07,680 --> 08:22:09,680
But I got Reinhardt though.

7225
08:22:11,680 --> 08:22:13,680
I got Reinhardt though.

7226
08:22:13,680 --> 08:22:15,680
I got a cheeky resurrection.

7227
08:22:15,680 --> 08:22:17,680
You might have got the erection.

7228
08:22:25,680 --> 08:22:27,680
Oh, that's from Sonic Heroes.

7229
08:22:27,680 --> 08:22:29,680
I know that reference!

7230
08:22:29,680 --> 08:22:31,680
Oh my god, Reinhardt!

7231
08:22:31,680 --> 08:22:33,680
Stop it!

7232
08:22:33,680 --> 08:22:35,680
Oh my god, that's what you get.

7233
08:22:35,680 --> 08:22:37,680
You naughty boy.

7234
08:22:37,680 --> 08:22:39,680
You're getting an absolute thank him.

7235
08:22:39,680 --> 08:22:41,680
Oh my god, please, I'm winning.

7236
08:22:41,680 --> 08:22:43,680
I'm sorry, but I'm winning this.

7237
08:22:43,680 --> 08:22:45,680
I don't care. I'm actually winning this.

7238
08:22:45,680 --> 08:22:47,680
I refuse to go offline until I win.

7239
08:22:47,680 --> 08:22:49,680
I don't care how many times you try and slam into me.

7240
08:22:49,680 --> 08:22:51,680
I don't care how many times you try and slam into me.

7241
08:22:55,680 --> 08:22:57,680
You know what, man, when I said that.

7242
08:22:57,680 --> 08:22:59,680
I actually didn't mean it.

7243
08:22:59,680 --> 08:23:01,680
Oh, surprise Reinhardt! Hi!

7244
08:23:01,680 --> 08:23:03,680
Hi, Reefling.

7245
08:23:03,680 --> 08:23:05,680
You know you won the smoke.

7246
08:23:05,680 --> 08:23:07,680
I'm burning everything.

7247
08:23:07,680 --> 08:23:09,680
Ah!

7248
08:23:09,680 --> 08:23:11,680
No, I'm joking!

7249
08:23:11,680 --> 08:23:13,680
I don't actually mean to come to me.

7250
08:23:13,680 --> 08:23:15,680
Don't do it.

7251
08:23:15,680 --> 08:23:17,680
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

7252
08:23:17,680 --> 08:23:19,680
Okay, hold on a minute.

7253
08:23:21,680 --> 08:23:23,680
Hold on a minute.

7254
08:23:23,680 --> 08:23:25,680
I'm getting... oh, don't tell them.

7255
08:23:25,680 --> 08:23:27,680
Don't let them know.

7256
08:23:27,680 --> 08:23:29,680
Don't let them know.

7257
08:23:29,680 --> 08:23:31,680
Don't let them know.

7258
08:23:31,680 --> 08:23:33,680
Don't let them know your next move!

7259
08:23:37,680 --> 08:23:39,680
Saved!

7260
08:23:39,680 --> 08:23:41,680
Saved!

7261
08:23:41,680 --> 08:23:43,680
Real.

7262
08:23:43,680 --> 08:23:45,680
Actually real and saved.

7263
08:23:47,680 --> 08:23:49,680
Oh my gosh, right, they're going to try and...

7264
08:23:49,680 --> 08:23:51,680
Come in through the building.

7265
08:23:53,680 --> 08:23:55,680
Sombra, you...

7266
08:23:55,680 --> 08:23:57,680
You're like a wet towel from...

7267
08:23:57,680 --> 08:23:59,680
Oh, that's like five days...

7268
08:23:59,680 --> 08:24:01,680
Five times used over.

7269
08:24:01,680 --> 08:24:03,680
That's what you are.

7270
08:24:03,680 --> 08:24:05,680
Oh, I can't get a raise.

7271
08:24:05,680 --> 08:24:07,680
I can't get a raise.

7272
08:24:07,680 --> 08:24:09,680
I'm coming.

7273
08:24:09,680 --> 08:24:11,680
I'm coming. Oh my god, he's literally right here.

7274
08:24:11,680 --> 08:24:13,680
Right here.

7275
08:24:15,680 --> 08:24:17,680
He's fucking here.

7276
08:24:17,680 --> 08:24:19,680
Is he not here?

7277
08:24:19,680 --> 08:24:21,680
Where the fuck's the rain?

7278
08:24:21,680 --> 08:24:23,680
Oh, he's back in the back.

7279
08:24:23,680 --> 08:24:25,680
Yeah, by, yeah, by, yeah, by.

7280
08:24:25,680 --> 08:24:27,680
Yeah, by, yeah, by.

7281
08:24:27,680 --> 08:24:29,680
Is it?

7282
08:24:29,680 --> 08:24:31,680
Right. No, they broke my turret!

7283
08:24:33,680 --> 08:24:35,680
Bro, the whole point of my turret is to do damage.

7284
08:24:37,680 --> 08:24:39,680
Oh my god, please.

7285
08:24:39,680 --> 08:24:41,680
Oh, come on.

7286
08:24:41,680 --> 08:24:43,680
I believe, I believe in the thing called love.

7287
08:24:43,680 --> 08:24:45,680
Just listen, listen to the rhythm of your heart.

7288
08:24:51,680 --> 08:24:53,680
If I do this...

7289
08:24:55,680 --> 08:24:57,680
High hopes for you.

7290
08:24:57,680 --> 08:25:01,680
You know, I'm starting to think they don't like my turret.

7291
08:25:01,680 --> 08:25:03,680
I don't know, I'm just getting like...

7292
08:25:03,680 --> 08:25:05,680
See that? See that?

7293
08:25:05,680 --> 08:25:07,680
I don't know.

7294
08:25:07,680 --> 08:25:09,680
I don't know if they can do it.

7295
08:25:09,680 --> 08:25:11,680
I'm being such an anchor right now.

7296
08:25:11,680 --> 08:25:13,680
Mercy is currently hovering above the point

7297
08:25:13,680 --> 08:25:15,680
to stop it from getting...

7298
08:25:17,680 --> 08:25:19,680
Oh my god, they're like...

7299
08:25:19,680 --> 08:25:21,680
There's two tanks and a healer.

7300
08:25:21,680 --> 08:25:23,680
I mean, maybe if they can...

7301
08:25:23,680 --> 08:25:25,680
Does she get the raise?

7302
08:25:25,680 --> 08:25:27,680
I'm about to, I'm about to ink.

7303
08:25:27,680 --> 08:25:29,680
No way, you get...

7304
08:25:29,680 --> 08:25:31,680
Oh my god.

7305
08:25:32,680 --> 08:25:34,680
Stop destroying my turret.

7306
08:25:34,680 --> 08:25:36,680
One, I'm...

7307
08:25:36,680 --> 08:25:38,680
I'm taking, I'm inking.

7308
08:25:38,680 --> 08:25:40,680
Get off my point, I'm inking.

7309
08:25:44,680 --> 08:25:46,680
I'm hotter than a furnace.

7310
08:25:46,680 --> 08:25:48,680
Right, that's right.

7311
08:25:48,680 --> 08:25:50,680
Oh, we did it.

7312
08:25:50,680 --> 08:25:52,680
Get beating, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

7313
08:25:52,680 --> 08:25:54,680
Get beating, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

7314
08:25:54,680 --> 08:25:56,680
Get beating, pop, pop, pop, pop.

7315
08:25:56,680 --> 08:25:58,680
Get beating, pop, pop, pop, pop.

7316
08:25:58,680 --> 08:26:00,680
Did she easy?

7317
08:26:00,680 --> 08:26:02,680
I missed a lot.

7318
08:26:02,680 --> 08:26:04,680
Nice to be able to feed her, you know.

7319
08:26:08,680 --> 08:26:10,680
Real...

7320
08:26:10,680 --> 08:26:12,680
I like the excuses.

7321
08:26:12,680 --> 08:26:14,680
Blame ping while you're at it.

7322
08:26:14,680 --> 08:26:16,680
Blame ping.

7323
08:26:16,680 --> 08:26:18,680
Say that your ping is like 100.

7324
08:26:18,680 --> 08:26:20,680
Or is it 15 or something?

7325
08:26:20,680 --> 08:26:22,680
Oh!

7326
08:26:22,680 --> 08:26:24,680
Cheeky bastard.

7327
08:26:24,680 --> 08:26:26,680
Oh my god, I won.

7328
08:26:26,680 --> 08:26:28,680
Right, now to start the endeavor

7329
08:26:28,680 --> 08:26:30,680
of deleting everyone.

7330
08:26:30,680 --> 08:26:32,680
Right, leave game.

7331
08:26:32,680 --> 08:26:34,680
No.

7332
08:26:34,680 --> 08:26:36,680
Yeah, leave the game.

7333
08:26:36,680 --> 08:26:38,680
Okay, now it is time to delete everyone.

7334
08:26:38,680 --> 08:26:40,680
If you are online,

7335
08:26:40,680 --> 08:26:42,680
it would make things a lot faster

7336
08:26:42,680 --> 08:26:44,680
if you could delete yourself.

7337
08:26:44,680 --> 08:26:46,680
Because I'm going to be here

7338
08:26:46,680 --> 08:26:48,680
for a little while.

7339
08:26:48,680 --> 08:26:50,680
Oh my gosh, and just like that.

7340
08:26:50,680 --> 08:26:52,680
Just like that.

7341
08:26:52,680 --> 08:26:54,680
Oh my god, oh my god!

7342
08:26:54,680 --> 08:26:56,680
They're doing it because it's registering.

7343
08:26:56,680 --> 08:26:58,680
It's registering.

7344
08:26:58,680 --> 08:27:00,680
Oh!

7345
08:27:00,680 --> 08:27:02,680
Oh, I'm out of a page.

7346
08:27:02,680 --> 08:27:04,680
Oh my. Thank you for helping.

7347
08:27:04,680 --> 08:27:06,680
Oh, you're actually...

7348
08:27:06,680 --> 08:27:08,680
You're doing it too fast, I can't keep up.

7349
08:27:08,680 --> 08:27:10,680
Deleting myself from mommy.

7350
08:27:12,680 --> 08:27:14,680
Okay, there we go.

7351
08:27:14,680 --> 08:27:16,680
I don't know how many are online, because I know some reflins went offline.

7352
08:27:16,680 --> 08:27:18,680
So don't worry if you...

7353
08:27:18,680 --> 08:27:20,680
Don't worry if you did your thing.

7354
08:27:22,680 --> 08:27:24,680
I hope I don't accidentally block someone.

7355
08:27:24,680 --> 08:27:26,680
I don't think I will.

7356
08:27:26,680 --> 08:27:28,680
Okay.

7357
08:27:28,680 --> 08:27:30,680
Oh my, you're doing it too fast.

7358
08:27:30,680 --> 08:27:32,680
I literally can't keep up. I need to pick up random.

7359
08:27:32,680 --> 08:27:34,680
Oh, quick, quick, who's going to win?

7360
08:27:34,680 --> 08:27:36,680
Me, I'm winning right now.

7361
08:27:36,680 --> 08:27:38,680
I'm winning, I'm winning.

7362
08:27:40,680 --> 08:27:42,680
I'm so sorry!

7363
08:27:42,680 --> 08:27:44,680
I'm so sorry.

7364
08:27:44,680 --> 08:27:46,680
I enjoyed it!

7365
08:27:46,680 --> 08:27:48,680
Everyone was like, oh my god, overwatch, I can't believe it.

7366
08:27:48,680 --> 08:27:50,680
I was like, no one's going to show up.

7367
08:27:50,680 --> 08:27:52,680
They're not going to...

7368
08:27:52,680 --> 08:27:54,680
I was going to say that completely.

7369
08:27:54,680 --> 08:27:56,680
I was like, oh my god, no one's going to show up.

7370
08:27:56,680 --> 08:28:00,680
Because only a few people are going to tolerate it for me.

7371
08:28:00,680 --> 08:28:02,680
And I'm like, aww.

7372
08:28:02,680 --> 08:28:04,680
But you also got to thank you.

7373
08:28:04,680 --> 08:28:06,680
I'm really appreciative.

7374
08:28:06,680 --> 08:28:08,680
I thank the next...

7375
08:28:08,680 --> 08:28:10,680
Just to give you a heads up, I thank...

7376
08:28:10,680 --> 08:28:12,680
The next Streams Night Game.

7377
08:28:14,680 --> 08:28:16,680
Might be left for dead too, but there's a sequel.

7378
08:28:18,680 --> 08:28:20,680
There's a sequel that you don't know yet.

7379
08:28:22,680 --> 08:28:24,680
Because it only got us today.

7380
08:28:24,680 --> 08:28:26,680
I'm so sorry.

7381
08:28:26,680 --> 08:28:28,680
For any reflin or whatever.

7382
08:28:28,680 --> 08:28:30,680
As I said, I don't use these account

7383
08:28:30,680 --> 08:28:32,680
unless it's for stream sniping.

7384
08:28:32,680 --> 08:28:34,680
Like, this is literally a brand new account.

7385
08:28:34,680 --> 08:28:36,680
I ain't even got the heroes unlocked.

7386
08:28:38,680 --> 08:28:40,680
He says so much, he wants this to later.

7387
08:28:40,680 --> 08:28:42,680
So, no!

7388
08:28:42,680 --> 08:28:44,680
That's absolutely not what I'm saying.

7389
08:28:44,680 --> 08:28:46,680
I'm saying name it overwatch.

7390
08:28:46,680 --> 08:28:48,680
I'm going to go Betty Bang.

7391
08:28:48,680 --> 08:28:50,680
Oh my god, do you like my shit?

7392
08:28:52,680 --> 08:28:54,680
You know if you remove my shit,

7393
08:28:54,680 --> 08:28:56,680
I did not realise how much my boobily mooglies wrote?

7394
08:29:02,680 --> 08:29:04,680
Why is it so... hold on.

7395
08:29:08,680 --> 08:29:10,680
Thank you.

7396
08:29:10,680 --> 08:29:12,680
Thank you.

7397
08:29:12,680 --> 08:29:14,680
I just want to do that.

7398
08:29:14,680 --> 08:29:16,680
I'm going to pop that right back there.

7399
08:29:18,680 --> 08:29:20,680
Yeah?

7400
08:29:22,680 --> 08:29:24,680
Oh!

7401
08:29:24,680 --> 08:29:26,680
With my Torbjorn old Torbjorn.

7402
08:29:26,680 --> 08:29:28,680
Ready to work.

7403
08:29:28,680 --> 08:29:30,680
Thank you, tiny spany.

7404
08:29:30,680 --> 08:29:32,680
Thank you, chair.

7405
08:29:32,680 --> 08:29:34,680
I don't think I've played this long with in real life people.

7406
08:29:34,680 --> 08:29:36,680
What? No!

7407
08:29:36,680 --> 08:29:38,680
That's such a shame.

7408
08:29:38,680 --> 08:29:40,680
I'll play with you then.

7409
08:29:40,680 --> 08:29:42,680
Deal. Thank you, chair.

7410
08:29:42,680 --> 08:29:44,680
Thank you, island. Thank you, boy.

7411
08:29:44,680 --> 08:29:46,680
I don't know what that bloop means.

7412
08:29:46,680 --> 08:29:48,680
Does that mean there's a friend request?

7413
08:29:48,680 --> 08:29:50,680
I'm getting nervous. I keep hearing that bloop.

7414
08:29:50,680 --> 08:29:52,680
No!

7415
08:29:52,680 --> 08:29:54,680
Spank!

7416
08:29:54,680 --> 08:29:56,680
No, I don't use this account. Stop it.

7417
08:30:00,680 --> 08:30:02,680
She hasn't eaten in two days.

7418
08:30:02,680 --> 08:30:04,680
Yes, I'm going to go eat.

7419
08:30:04,680 --> 08:30:06,680
I'm going to make...

7420
08:30:06,680 --> 08:30:08,680
I didn't actually end up making the soup,

7421
08:30:08,680 --> 08:30:10,680
so I think I might freeze all the vegetables

7422
08:30:10,680 --> 08:30:12,680
or use them for something else.

7423
08:30:14,680 --> 08:30:16,680
I have passed...

7424
08:30:16,680 --> 08:30:18,680
I can maybe make cheesy

7425
08:30:18,680 --> 08:30:20,680
chicken

7426
08:30:20,680 --> 08:30:22,680
and vegetable...

7427
08:30:22,680 --> 08:30:24,680
like, roast vegetable pasta?

7428
08:30:24,680 --> 08:30:26,680
I don't think so.

7429
08:30:26,680 --> 08:30:28,680
So anyone make you happy so we'll play anything with you?

7430
08:30:28,680 --> 08:30:30,680
Yeah, even if you lost brain cells playing with me?

7431
08:30:34,680 --> 08:30:36,680
Yeah.

7432
08:30:42,680 --> 08:30:44,680
Thank you, the pretty lord.

7433
08:30:44,680 --> 08:30:46,680
Yeah, I would argue that's probably right.

7434
08:30:46,680 --> 08:30:48,680
I might just quickly take marshmallow

7435
08:30:48,680 --> 08:30:50,680
in case there's anything I missed.

7436
08:30:50,680 --> 08:30:52,680
That was major.

7437
08:30:52,680 --> 08:30:54,680
But I just want to say thank you so so much

7438
08:30:54,680 --> 08:30:56,680
for playing stream snake games.

7439
08:30:58,680 --> 08:31:00,680
If I wasn't an intense agony right now,

7440
08:31:00,680 --> 08:31:02,680
I'd probably cry from just how much fun...

7441
08:31:02,680 --> 08:31:04,680
Oh no, if I think about it too much,

7442
08:31:04,680 --> 08:31:06,680
I'm going to cry. Hold on a minute.

7443
08:31:06,680 --> 08:31:08,680
Hold on a minute, you're going to make me cry.

7444
08:31:08,680 --> 08:31:10,680
Are you feeling...

7445
08:31:10,680 --> 08:31:12,680
Oh!

7446
08:31:12,680 --> 08:31:14,680
Right, I'm tearing up just thinking about saying

7447
08:31:14,680 --> 08:31:16,680
thank you for playing games with me.

7448
08:31:16,680 --> 08:31:18,680
I call you a weakling

7449
08:31:18,680 --> 08:31:20,680
to torment you.

7450
08:31:20,680 --> 08:31:22,680
I'm a weakling, I'm greeting at the fact

7451
08:31:22,680 --> 08:31:24,680
that you'd fucking play that game with me.

7452
08:31:24,680 --> 08:31:26,680
No!

7453
08:31:26,680 --> 08:31:28,680
I'm not getting sniffily.

7454
08:31:28,680 --> 08:31:30,680
I'm getting a wee bit sniffily.

7455
08:31:30,680 --> 08:31:32,680
But I'm really happy.

7456
08:31:32,680 --> 08:31:34,680
I really like being able

7457
08:31:34,680 --> 08:31:36,680
to play with you

7458
08:31:36,680 --> 08:31:38,680
and do stuff with you. No, I'm not crying!

7459
08:31:40,680 --> 08:31:42,680
It just makes me really happy.

7460
08:31:42,680 --> 08:31:44,680
Thanks for the fun games.

7461
08:31:44,680 --> 08:31:46,680
Beloved, have a great night.

7462
08:31:46,680 --> 08:31:48,680
Have a good night too. Thank you Roonex.

7463
08:31:48,680 --> 08:31:50,680
That's the solution.

7464
08:31:54,680 --> 08:31:56,680
Yeah, it's nice

7465
08:31:56,680 --> 08:31:58,680
that we get to do stuff together

7466
08:31:58,680 --> 08:32:00,680
and goof off.

7467
08:32:00,680 --> 08:32:02,680
I know

7468
08:32:02,680 --> 08:32:04,680
not a lot of VTubers

7469
08:32:04,680 --> 08:32:06,680
will ever get this kind of thing

7470
08:32:06,680 --> 08:32:08,680
for themselves.

7471
08:32:08,680 --> 08:32:10,680
And I'm just really appreciative

7472
08:32:10,680 --> 08:32:12,680
of that.

7473
08:32:12,680 --> 08:32:14,680
You know how

7474
08:32:14,680 --> 08:32:16,680
sometimes you see someone being successful

7475
08:32:16,680 --> 08:32:18,680
they've got this going on for them

7476
08:32:18,680 --> 08:32:20,680
they've got that going on for them.

7477
08:32:20,680 --> 08:32:22,680
I'm there, I've got my reef lens

7478
08:32:22,680 --> 08:32:24,680
I've got the best end

7479
08:32:24,680 --> 08:32:26,680
and we get to play goofy games together

7480
08:32:26,680 --> 08:32:28,680
I get to scream down the mic

7481
08:32:28,680 --> 08:32:30,680
playing Overwatch

7482
08:32:30,680 --> 08:32:32,680
telling you I forgot to make you bark down the mic for heels.

7483
08:32:32,680 --> 08:32:34,680
Okay, next time, next time

7484
08:32:34,680 --> 08:32:36,680
I'll make you bark down the mic.

7485
08:32:36,680 --> 08:32:38,680
Literally

7486
08:32:38,680 --> 08:32:40,680
this was supposed to be a two hour stream

7487
08:32:40,680 --> 08:32:42,680
and

7488
08:32:42,680 --> 08:32:44,680
it was just non-stop

7489
08:32:44,680 --> 08:32:46,680
you're also patient as well

7490
08:32:46,680 --> 08:32:48,680
no one says anything mean

7491
08:32:48,680 --> 08:32:50,680
no one's like

7492
08:32:50,680 --> 08:32:52,680
oh my god I had to wait

7493
08:32:52,680 --> 08:32:54,680
I hated that

7494
08:32:54,680 --> 08:32:56,680
and all I got was a 10 minute game with you

7495
08:32:56,680 --> 08:32:58,680
because we played it so quickly

7496
08:32:58,680 --> 08:33:00,680
or whatever, no one's

7497
08:33:00,680 --> 08:33:02,680
it's just so nice

7498
08:33:02,680 --> 08:33:04,680
and I'm really grateful

7499
08:33:04,680 --> 08:33:06,680
I really am

7500
08:33:06,680 --> 08:33:08,680
I have a very nice feeling

7501
08:33:08,680 --> 08:33:10,680
my heart is very full

7502
08:33:10,680 --> 08:33:12,680
that is the descriptive

7503
08:33:12,680 --> 08:33:14,680
my heart is very full

7504
08:33:14,680 --> 08:33:16,680
what I'm going to do

7505
08:33:16,680 --> 08:33:18,680
is go

7506
08:33:18,680 --> 08:33:20,680
offline and eat and probably pass out

7507
08:33:20,680 --> 08:33:22,680
tomorrow

7508
08:33:22,680 --> 08:33:24,680
the ring fit's going to be replaced

7509
08:33:24,680 --> 08:33:26,680
I

7510
08:33:26,680 --> 08:33:28,680
don't even know if I can do the members

7511
08:33:28,680 --> 08:33:30,680
stream chest because tomorrow

7512
08:33:30,680 --> 08:33:32,680
I'm going to feel a bit more sickly

7513
08:33:32,680 --> 08:33:34,680
whereas today I don't feel sickly yet

7514
08:33:34,680 --> 08:33:36,680
but no

7515
08:33:36,680 --> 08:33:38,680
I'll make you bark next

7516
08:33:38,680 --> 08:33:40,680
so thank you

7517
08:33:40,680 --> 08:33:42,680
reluctantly saying for this and for that

7518
08:33:42,680 --> 08:33:44,680
I'll make you bark next

7519
08:33:44,680 --> 08:33:46,680
I'm going to redirect

7520
08:33:46,680 --> 08:33:48,680
into

7521
08:33:48,680 --> 08:33:50,680
first super

7522
08:33:50,680 --> 08:33:52,680
first love proposal

7523
08:33:52,680 --> 08:33:54,680
first overwatch game

7524
08:33:54,680 --> 08:33:56,680
she's taken so many firsts in bleeding out

7525
08:33:56,680 --> 08:33:58,680
I can't

7526
08:33:58,680 --> 08:34:00,680
like as I said I'll play more free games

7527
08:34:00,680 --> 08:34:02,680
and I'll play different games of variety

7528
08:34:02,680 --> 08:34:04,680
in that

7529
08:34:04,680 --> 08:34:06,680
but yeah

7530
08:34:06,680 --> 08:34:08,680
thank you for letting me pop so many of your cherries

7531
08:34:08,680 --> 08:34:10,680
went quite nice

7532
08:34:10,680 --> 08:34:12,680
I am going to redirect

7533
08:34:12,680 --> 08:34:14,680
into

7534
08:34:14,680 --> 08:34:16,680

7535
08:34:16,680 --> 08:34:18,680
as always

7536
08:34:18,680 --> 08:34:20,680
please be respectful

7537
08:34:24,680 --> 08:34:26,680
I'll stop it

7538
08:34:26,680 --> 08:34:28,680
I'll literally go on about our word in you every single day

7539
08:34:28,680 --> 08:34:30,680
bruh

7540
08:34:30,680 --> 08:34:32,680

7541
08:34:32,680 --> 08:34:34,680
thank you internet battlefile

7542
08:34:34,680 --> 08:34:36,680
but come on

7543
08:34:36,680 --> 08:34:38,680
a good person

7544
08:34:38,680 --> 08:34:40,680
I'm going to our word you if you don't let me win next

7545
08:34:40,680 --> 08:34:42,680
I'm going to psychological warfare

7546
08:34:42,680 --> 08:34:44,680
next

7547
08:34:44,680 --> 08:34:46,680
good person

7548
08:34:46,680 --> 08:34:48,680
you see me with rose tinted glasses

7549
08:34:48,680 --> 08:34:50,680
and all the stuff I come out with

7550
08:34:50,680 --> 08:34:52,680
honestly short in behaviour

7551
08:34:52,680 --> 08:34:54,680
but lovingly

7552
08:34:54,680 --> 08:34:56,680
yes lovingly

7553
08:34:56,680 --> 08:34:58,680
why of course

7554
08:34:58,680 --> 08:35:00,680
hmm

7555
08:35:00,680 --> 08:35:02,680
hi mommy I saw that you had a stream title

7556
08:35:02,680 --> 08:35:04,680
giving reflins new gamer tags but you can't see it

7557
08:35:04,680 --> 08:35:06,680
yes I'm not doing it today

7558
08:35:06,680 --> 08:35:08,680
em

7559
08:35:08,680 --> 08:35:10,680
I'm on my sin sister season

7560
08:35:10,680 --> 08:35:12,680
how about we call it that

7561
08:35:12,680 --> 08:35:14,680
I don't tomorrow

7562
08:35:14,680 --> 08:35:16,680
it's very likely I'm not going to feel very well at all

7563
08:35:16,680 --> 08:35:18,680
normally I would

7564
08:35:18,680 --> 08:35:20,680
hide it but

7565
08:35:20,680 --> 08:35:22,680
fuck it

7566
08:35:22,680 --> 08:35:24,680
em I'm just going to be honest

7567
08:35:24,680 --> 08:35:26,680
I am very likely to be very sick tomorrow

7568
08:35:26,680 --> 08:35:28,680
so I think tomorrow is going to be a two hour stream

7569
08:35:28,680 --> 08:35:30,680
and I will reschedule everything else

7570
08:35:30,680 --> 08:35:32,680
em

7571
08:35:32,680 --> 08:35:34,680
as I always do the thumbnail

7572
08:35:34,680 --> 08:35:36,680
and the title of that ASMR rewards stream will also change

7573
08:35:36,680 --> 08:35:38,680
so please don't worry

7574
08:35:38,680 --> 08:35:40,680
our little fights they're cute so fast

7575
08:35:40,680 --> 08:35:42,680
oh that's so bad

7576
08:35:42,680 --> 08:35:44,680
wait what how did I

7577
08:35:44,680 --> 08:35:46,680
did I not delete everyone

7578
08:35:46,680 --> 08:35:48,680
how did that

7579
08:35:48,680 --> 08:35:50,680
the one refling

7580
08:35:50,680 --> 08:35:52,680
to rule them all what

7581
08:35:52,680 --> 08:35:54,680
wait how did you come

7582
08:35:56,680 --> 08:35:58,680
Danny

7583
08:35:58,680 --> 08:36:00,680
I'm so confused

7584
08:36:02,680 --> 08:36:04,680
how did the they do that

7585
08:36:06,680 --> 08:36:08,680
is there something I'm is there something I'm missing

7586
08:36:14,680 --> 08:36:16,680
what is she

7587
08:36:18,680 --> 08:36:20,680
wait it still says I have

7588
08:36:20,680 --> 08:36:22,680
42 friends on battle mate

7589
08:36:26,680 --> 08:36:28,680
ah

7590
08:36:30,680 --> 08:36:32,680
ah we have to move them one by one

7591
08:36:32,680 --> 08:36:34,680
oh if they're offline

7592
08:36:34,680 --> 08:36:36,680
offline it doesn't display

7593
08:36:36,680 --> 08:36:38,680
in overwatch I guess

7594
08:36:38,680 --> 08:36:40,680
it says I have 39 right hold on

7595
08:36:40,680 --> 08:36:42,680
hold on

7596
08:36:42,680 --> 08:36:44,680
I'm deleting them and then I'll take a screenshot

7597
08:36:44,680 --> 08:36:46,680
and show you my darlings

7598
08:36:46,680 --> 08:36:48,680
I don't want any green ones

7599
08:36:48,680 --> 08:36:50,680
as I said I make specific accounts

7600
08:36:50,680 --> 08:36:52,680
for stream sniping

7601
08:36:52,680 --> 08:36:54,680
I think it's left

7602
08:36:54,680 --> 08:36:56,680
I forgot to I haven't played it before

7603
08:36:56,680 --> 08:36:58,680
but there is a little nice little twist to it

7604
08:37:02,680 --> 08:37:04,680
my only concern is

7605
08:37:04,680 --> 08:37:06,680
I might not get to everyone

7606
08:37:06,680 --> 08:37:08,680
because of the twist

7607
08:37:10,680 --> 08:37:12,680
so the only thing I can say is

7608
08:37:12,680 --> 08:37:14,680
disclaimer

7609
08:37:14,680 --> 08:37:16,680
disclaimer

7610
08:37:20,680 --> 08:37:22,680
sorry it's just going to go on

7611
08:37:22,680 --> 08:37:24,680
can I rub my brain cells

7612
08:37:24,680 --> 08:37:26,680
enough together

7613
08:37:26,680 --> 08:37:28,680
to maybe come out with a sentence

7614
08:37:28,680 --> 08:37:30,680
I don't know

7615
08:37:30,680 --> 08:37:32,680
or are you just going to

7616
08:37:32,680 --> 08:37:34,680
listen

7617
08:37:34,680 --> 08:37:36,680
to the tone of my voices

7618
08:37:36,680 --> 08:37:38,680
I don't believe

7619
08:37:38,680 --> 08:37:40,680
everyone was mad that

7620
08:37:40,680 --> 08:37:42,680
Juno's wee video

7621
08:37:42,680 --> 08:37:44,680
didn't have the same

7622
08:37:44,680 --> 08:37:46,680
quality we said it cheaped out

7623
08:37:46,680 --> 08:37:48,680
we did it

7624
08:37:48,680 --> 08:37:50,680
stylistic

7625
08:37:50,680 --> 08:37:52,680
we didn't groom mommy she groomed us

7626
08:37:52,680 --> 08:37:54,680
I like how that's the first thing I read

7627
08:37:54,680 --> 08:37:56,680
when I'm doing my wee delete thing

7628
08:37:58,680 --> 08:38:00,680
can't wait to Karma

7629
08:38:00,680 --> 08:38:02,680
charge her

7630
08:38:02,680 --> 08:38:04,680
wait what's that

7631
08:38:04,680 --> 08:38:06,680
in

7632
08:38:06,680 --> 08:38:08,680
in the video game

7633
08:38:08,680 --> 08:38:10,680
Shrani don't force it up to stream tomorrow

7634
08:38:10,680 --> 08:38:12,680
oh no no no you don't understand

7635
08:38:12,680 --> 08:38:14,680
I will happily

7636
08:38:14,680 --> 08:38:16,680
come on stream

7637
08:38:16,680 --> 08:38:18,680
and have painkillers and all that

7638
08:38:18,680 --> 08:38:20,680
that's fine

7639
08:38:20,680 --> 08:38:22,680
I really want to push myself

7640
08:38:22,680 --> 08:38:24,680
I think tomorrow I can actually tweet out

7641
08:38:24,680 --> 08:38:26,680
all my thumbnails and be like

7642
08:38:26,680 --> 08:38:28,680
I've streamed every single day for 3 months

7643
08:38:30,680 --> 08:38:32,680
which is an absolute hoot in the hauler

7644
08:38:32,680 --> 08:38:34,680
I can't believe that

7645
08:38:34,680 --> 08:38:36,680
it doesn't feel like it

7646
08:38:36,680 --> 08:38:38,680
like

7647
08:38:38,680 --> 08:38:40,680
like being able to be like

7648
08:38:40,680 --> 08:38:42,680
I have

7649
08:38:42,680 --> 08:38:44,680
I just removed sin

7650
08:38:44,680 --> 08:38:46,680
was that supposed to keep sin?

7651
08:38:46,680 --> 08:38:48,680
I don't know

7652
08:38:48,680 --> 08:38:50,680
hmm

7653
08:38:50,680 --> 08:38:52,680
was that supposed to keep sin sister

7654
08:38:52,680 --> 08:38:54,680
or my friends list

7655
08:38:54,680 --> 08:38:56,680
I know you can't see

7656
08:38:56,680 --> 08:38:58,680
anything right now

7657
08:38:58,680 --> 08:39:00,680
but

7658
08:39:00,680 --> 08:39:02,680
well I mean sins removed too

7659
08:39:02,680 --> 08:39:04,680
okay

7660
08:39:04,680 --> 08:39:06,680
the worst punishment for

7661
08:39:06,680 --> 08:39:08,680
Shrani is not streaming bro I think it's throw up

7662
08:39:08,680 --> 08:39:10,680
if I couldn't

7663
08:39:10,680 --> 08:39:12,680
there has been some days

7664
08:39:12,680 --> 08:39:14,680
where

7665
08:39:14,680 --> 08:39:16,680
before I've slept I've been like

7666
08:39:16,680 --> 08:39:18,680
oh my god I'm not sure

7667
08:39:18,680 --> 08:39:20,680
but

7668
08:39:20,680 --> 08:39:22,680
or like I need a break

7669
08:39:22,680 --> 08:39:24,680
to take time off to do background stuff

7670
08:39:24,680 --> 08:39:26,680
or whatever

7671
08:39:26,680 --> 08:39:28,680
but then I just know for a fact

7672
08:39:28,680 --> 08:39:30,680
if I actually did take a day off

7673
08:39:30,680 --> 08:39:32,680
I would be so mad at myself

7674
08:39:32,680 --> 08:39:34,680
I would be livid

7675
08:39:34,680 --> 08:39:36,680
not to be confused with it

7676
08:39:36,680 --> 08:39:38,680
is Mars livid

7677
08:39:38,680 --> 08:39:40,680
yes I'm allowed to make that joke

7678
08:39:44,680 --> 08:39:46,680
yeah I just

7679
08:39:46,680 --> 08:39:48,680
I would not forgive myself if I took the day off

7680
08:39:48,680 --> 08:39:50,680
and

7681
08:39:50,680 --> 08:39:52,680
I feel like if I did take a day off

7682
08:39:52,680 --> 08:39:54,680
I would actually just wrought as well

7683
08:39:58,680 --> 08:40:00,680
rather than get the work done that I was

7684
08:40:00,680 --> 08:40:02,680
in quotation marks supposed to do

7685
08:40:04,680 --> 08:40:06,680
right yes last person there we go

7686
08:40:06,680 --> 08:40:08,680
okay here we go

7687
08:40:08,680 --> 08:40:10,680
I'm taking a screenshot and I'm gonna

7688
08:40:10,680 --> 08:40:12,680
you're gonna hear the bidu that's me

7689
08:40:12,680 --> 08:40:14,680
that's me I told you that's me

7690
08:40:14,680 --> 08:40:16,680
and my pp always goes bidu bidu

7691
08:40:16,680 --> 08:40:18,680
and then I'm gonna save the image

7692
08:40:18,680 --> 08:40:20,680
and then I'm gonna drag it into

7693
08:40:20,680 --> 08:40:22,680
Vtube studio because it's actually hell of a lot faster

7694
08:40:22,680 --> 08:40:24,680
I dragged something into Vtube studio

7695
08:40:24,680 --> 08:40:26,680
there you go boom

7696
08:40:26,680 --> 08:40:28,680
yeah you like that

7697
08:40:28,680 --> 08:40:30,680
that's the scuttlefish that's me

7698
08:40:30,680 --> 08:40:32,680
and then it says find new friends

7699
08:40:32,680 --> 08:40:34,680
to start your journey

7700
08:40:34,680 --> 08:40:36,680
and get everyone from the battle net as well

7701
08:40:36,680 --> 08:40:38,680
that's why that person came

7702
08:40:38,680 --> 08:40:40,680
online on overwatch

7703
08:40:40,680 --> 08:40:42,680
and

7704
08:40:42,680 --> 08:40:44,680
yeah there we go and now it says your friends

7705
08:40:44,680 --> 08:40:46,680
list is empty as well

7706
08:40:46,680 --> 08:40:48,680
sorry you can't see because of me

7707
08:40:48,680 --> 08:40:50,680

7708
08:40:50,680 --> 08:40:52,680

7712
08:40:58,680 --> 08:41:00,680
hurt anyone

there you go

7714
08:41:02,680 --> 08:41:04,680
it's like proper empty empty it doesn't register

7715
08:41:04,680 --> 08:41:06,680
we haven't got anyone on battle net

7716
08:41:06,680 --> 08:41:08,680

I had lots of fun hopefully

7896
08:47:10,680 --> 08:47:12,680
I can pick another game that you like

7897
08:47:12,680 --> 08:47:14,680
or a free game or

7898
08:47:14,680 --> 08:47:16,680
something in the future that we can play again

7899
08:47:16,680 --> 08:47:18,680
together

7900
08:47:18,680 --> 08:47:20,680
I will try and make some weekend stream snipes

7901
08:47:20,680 --> 08:47:22,680
as well because I do know the majority is only

7902
08:47:22,680 --> 08:47:24,680
available on the weekend but I do try and

7903
08:47:24,680 --> 08:47:26,680
stream a wee bit longer

7904
08:47:26,680 --> 08:47:28,680
when I do stream snipes to give you a chance

7905
08:47:28,680 --> 08:47:30,680
especially for those of you who sleep to me

7906
08:47:30,680 --> 08:47:32,680
or if you're Aussie

7907
08:47:32,680 --> 08:47:34,680
cause it's 4 am

7908
08:47:34,680 --> 08:47:36,680
but

7909
08:47:36,680 --> 08:47:38,680
you know we're doing good

7910
08:47:38,680 --> 08:47:40,680
okay I think you missed one

7911
08:47:40,680 --> 08:47:42,680

08:47:48,680 --> 08:47:50,680
Rui and Joy

7916
08:47:50,680 --> 08:47:52,680
would probably make team a motion

7917
08:47:52,680 --> 08:47:54,680
cause it kind of sounds like a motion you would give to someone

7918
08:47:54,680 --> 08:47:56,680
so that's another case

7919
08:47:56,680 --> 08:47:58,680
Cinco, Billy, Diddy

7920
08:47:58,680 --> 08:48:00,680
I just call you

7921
08:48:00,680 --> 08:48:02,680
uh

7922
08:48:02,680 --> 08:48:04,680
what would I call you?

7923
08:48:04,680 --> 08:48:06,680
Cinco? Like I said Cinco Cinco says

7924
08:48:06,680 --> 08:48:08,680
I'll call you pretty fly for a white guy

7925
08:48:08,680 --> 08:48:10,680
and then I have void rager

7926
08:48:10,680 --> 08:48:12,680
dot gar

7927
08:48:12,680 --> 08:48:14,680
it was like

7928
08:48:14,680 --> 08:48:16,680
mashin re

7929
08:48:16,680 --> 08:48:18,680
girl

7930
08:48:18,680 --> 08:48:20,680
I definitely did not say it right

7931
08:48:20,680 --> 08:48:22,680
that one was like

7932
08:48:22,680 --> 08:48:24,680
I guess I would call you team

7933
08:48:24,680 --> 08:48:26,680
team

7934
08:48:26,680 --> 08:48:28,680
team struggle bus

7935
08:48:28,680 --> 08:48:30,680
cause I'm pretty sure I struggled against you

7936
08:48:30,680 --> 08:48:32,680
when we played against each other

7937
08:48:32,680 --> 08:48:34,680
I'm like 99% sure I played against you

7938
08:48:34,680 --> 08:48:36,680
team

7939
08:48:36,680 --> 08:48:38,680
team

7940
08:48:38,680 --> 08:48:40,680
have you played Halo Infinite? Is that the multiplayer Halo?

7941
08:48:40,680 --> 08:48:42,680
if so

7942
08:48:42,680 --> 08:48:44,680
I might add it to the list of games that we're going to play together

7943
08:48:50,680 --> 08:48:52,680
I was on your team with tank

7944
08:48:52,680 --> 08:48:54,680
there you go

7945
08:48:54,680 --> 08:48:56,680
there you go tank

7946
08:48:56,680 --> 08:48:58,680
but maybe I'll just call you team health

7947
08:48:58,680 --> 08:49:00,680
cause we had so much health

7948
08:49:00,680 --> 08:49:02,680
you were tanking all the blues

7949
08:49:02,680 --> 08:49:04,680
team health

7950
08:49:04,680 --> 08:49:06,680
Halo Infinite is free player

7951
08:49:06,680 --> 08:49:08,680
doesn't crawl have multiplayer?

7952
08:49:08,680 --> 08:49:10,680
I don't know what crawl is

7953
08:49:10,680 --> 08:49:12,680
right I'm not going to stall any longer

7954
08:49:12,680 --> 08:49:14,680
cause I'm probably going to pass out if I don't actually eat

7955
08:49:14,680 --> 08:49:16,680
I love you lots

7956
08:49:16,680 --> 08:49:18,680
as I said I'm going to redirect into Maeve

7957
08:49:18,680 --> 08:49:20,680
as always please be super duper

7958
08:49:20,680 --> 08:49:22,680
respect for

7959
08:49:22,680 --> 08:49:24,680
we're all about the respect

7960
08:49:24,680 --> 08:49:26,680
I thank you so so much for everyone that stream sniped

7961
08:49:26,680 --> 08:49:28,680
everyone who was cheering us on as well

7962
08:49:28,680 --> 08:49:30,680
I know there's lurkers that are a bit too shy to join

7963
08:49:30,680 --> 08:49:32,680
but thank you for being a part of the fun

7964
08:49:32,680 --> 08:49:34,680
I really appreciate it

7965
08:49:34,680 --> 08:49:36,680
and I'll talk to you later alligator

7966
08:49:36,680 --> 08:49:38,680
and I'll see you in a while crocodile

7967
08:49:38,680 --> 08:49:40,680
as I said the thumbnail is going to change

7968
08:49:40,680 --> 08:49:42,680
for tomorrow

7969
08:49:42,680 --> 08:49:44,680
and the membership stream is going to be delayed as well

7970
08:49:44,680 --> 08:49:46,680
to make

7971
08:49:46,680 --> 08:49:48,680
way for

7972
08:49:48,680 --> 08:49:50,680
the card shop demo tcg

7973
08:49:50,680 --> 08:49:52,680
cause it's not out yet but we can play the demo

7974
08:49:52,680 --> 08:49:54,680
and I think it looks really cute

7975
08:49:54,680 --> 08:49:56,680
so we're going to give it a shot

7976
08:49:56,680 --> 08:49:58,680
thank you very much

7977
08:49:58,680 --> 08:50:00,680
I'm going to see you tomorrow

7978
08:50:00,680 --> 08:50:02,680
I'm going to eat and then

7979
08:50:02,680 --> 08:50:04,680
and then bath

7980
08:50:04,680 --> 08:50:06,680
and then sleep

7981
08:50:06,680 --> 08:50:08,680
and then deal with the day

7982
08:50:08,680 --> 08:50:10,680
something like that

7983
08:50:10,680 --> 08:50:12,680
okay

7984
08:50:12,680 --> 08:50:14,680
thank you again for playing with me and cheering me on

7985
08:50:14,680 --> 08:50:16,680
I really enjoyed today

7986
08:50:16,680 --> 08:50:18,680
so thank you for making me happy

7987
08:50:18,680 --> 08:50:20,680

7988
08:50:20,680 --> 08:50:22,680
you made this Scottish little squiddle happy

7989
08:50:22,680 --> 08:50:24,680
okay even though I'm a cuttlefish

7990
08:50:24,680 --> 08:50:26,680
I'll say squiddle just cause you know

7991
08:50:26,680 --> 08:50:28,680
Scottish squiddle, I love my alliteration

7992
08:50:28,680 --> 08:50:30,680

7993
08:50:30,680 --> 08:50:32,680
