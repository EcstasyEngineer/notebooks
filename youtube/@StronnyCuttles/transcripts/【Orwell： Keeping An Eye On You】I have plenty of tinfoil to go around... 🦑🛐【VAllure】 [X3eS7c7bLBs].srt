1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Good morning I guess you couldn't faint in foil

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,720
I'll have PNG, the best I got is a JPEG.

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm fucking typed in 10-4, I'll have PNG.

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,000
And again, none of them were PNGs.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,480
So I'm fucking have this on my head.

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,080
Hold on, I need to re-calibrate.

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,200
Okay, there we go, I re-calibrated.

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,840
I'm freaking spinning off my head.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,120
Shit, I did not filter through transparent images.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,920
I absolutely did not.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,200
I think I got to the eighth one and I was like,

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
you know what, I like this one

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,240
because the top part, the top part of the tin foil.

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,960
It looks so good.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
And I was like, I want this.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,640
So, I'll give myself the hiccups.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,120
Right, no hiccups, because it's gonna hurt.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay, it's so funny considering the background, literally.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
Right, I don't want the hiccups

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
because it's gonna really hurt.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,920
This too was a high-table plot, literally me.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know, I had a tin foil PNG like the other day.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Levy Exodus, thank you for becoming a member.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,640
I appreciate it.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,720
What kind of membership streams do I make?

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,760
In general, you're asking.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,200
I usually stream three to four membership streams a week.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
Are you squidding me right now?

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,120
But I have to...

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,000
Did some reeflings miss?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
You got some white in your hair.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,800
No, it's a PNG on purpose.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,440
It's not a PNG by accident.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
Are you squidding me right now?

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
A JPEG on purpose.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
Mm!

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm gonna go, Brian doesn't read out,

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,880
but I'll read out, don't worry.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
Spidey, thank you for the tip.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,160
I appreciate it.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, reeflings.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
Akadea says,

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,080
love, love, please take care of yourself.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Greetings from Germany.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Hello, Leute, Dankeschön.

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,840
Bitte, for das,

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,080
a membership einen Month.

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,160
Dankeschön.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,640
It's the best I've got, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,360
Any German people listening?

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I feel like the crying women mean,

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,200
babe, just go to sleep, you don't need a streamer.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm okay.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,200
So basically, I'm gonna do a little yapping,

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
but thank you so much to everyone who has reached out.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,600
Management basically got like,

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,360
six more clippers on board, which is perfect.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,440
So I was up, kinda organizing a lot of clipping stuff.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
I was doing a lot of liaison stuff.

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,840
Back and forth.

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,080
If you didn't know, the girls have got

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
GamerSupps codes.

63
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,640
Everyone's descriptions are getting updated incredibly shortly,

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,640
but you can just use the girls' names, GamerSupps.

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,880
For 10% off and any earnings fully,

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,600
go to the girl, Vehler, do not take a cut.

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
No, no, no, no, Vehler, don't touch none of that.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
All profits, all for them.

69
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,960
There will be a few tweets coming out

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,880
that the girls will interact with,

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,600
just to really solidify.

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,920
And then, yeah, I do apologize for yawning.

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Vehler, GamerSupps, yes.

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,560
I did not yet ask permission,

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,840
if I'm allowed to talk about certain things yet,

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
so you're gonna have to forgive me,

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
but I can talk about something further

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
if I am giving it all clear.

79
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Same applies to you, yes, CodeStrony at checkout.

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,600
Gives you 10% off and it gives me a kickback.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,400
And I believe I'm gonna get a PR package,

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
so you might get a hand cam stream of me snorting it.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,720
That's terrible, do not, no, I'm not actually.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
GamerSupps already is huge.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,360
Yes, they were incredibly kind.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,360
I can talk a bit more once I get the green light

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,240
about a certain thing I would like to attempt,

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
but can't do that yet.

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,680
Time to get your anime thighs

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,840
or teddy milk sponsored by Vehler.

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Well, there's a new flavor coming out on GamerSupps.

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,520
It might already be out and it's called anime thighs

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,760
and you might recognize someone's thighs on it.

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,360
It's not my thighs, no, someone else's thighs.

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,360
So, you know, if you were curious,

96
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,280
you might recognize someone's thighs on the packaging.

97
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,200
If it's already out, if it's not out, do not listen to me.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,400
I think it's already out

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
because they gave us promotional artwork for it.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,360
It's not Warmelon, no, it's not me, it's not my thighs.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Someone else's thighs of Vehler.

102
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,280
Peeler flavor when?

103
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,120
It's orange.

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
But yes, I do apologize if I'm a little sleepyhead today.

105
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
So, I just wanna say, if any of you make War Thunder videos,

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,440
my dad was watching you bomb things in War Thunder.

107
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,680
Pearly, thank you for the five gifted members

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,440
and congrats to those who cut them with their face.

109
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,400
I apologize for her squint, my hat,

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,680
my little tinfoil hat is horizontal.

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,920
That thing is spinning on an axis, that's terrible.

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Yeah, he was watching War Thunder videos.

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
So, if you make War Thunder videos,

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
there's a chance my dad watched you.

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,400
We were also watching Australian car crashes,

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,240
and compilations, War Hammer, War Thunder.

117
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,760
War Thunder with the planes, my dad has planes.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
He loves planes.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,800
War Thunder leaked more documents again.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Honestly, that's hilarious.

121
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,520
It's actually my dad's, sorry, sorry, my dad's at it again.

122
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,360
I apologize, he just gets a bit overzealous

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,680
about the details on the planes and stuff.

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,280
You know, they have to be right, they have to be accurate.

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
And is he into the War Thunder Kiss Me loop?

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,560
No, he's into the let's test out nuclear bombs

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,840
and what happens when we drop them loop.

128
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,680
We were literally watching nuclear bombs

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,760
get dropped in the game, and I was like, oh yeah, curious.

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,640
And like honestly, the stuff my dad watches is hilarious.

131
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,800
So one minute we're watching nuclear bombs,

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
next minute we're watching car crash compilations

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,480
from Australia, because everyone's like, oh, you effing suit.

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
Like every time there's a crash.

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,080
And then we jumped over to the chef, what's his name?

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,600
The French Italian chef, it's like Jean Pierre or something.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
And he goes, onion.

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,280
And we were like jumping between all these categories.

139
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
It was, I was getting flat, like, not flashbacks.

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I was getting whipped around, honestly.

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,400
10 file foil hat, absolutely.

142
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,920
We're playing a game called Orwell.

143
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
If you didn't know, 1984 is a book by George Orwell.

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,760
And it's about how everything is in shambles, okay?

145
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,880
And we're about to play a game based on it.

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Now, this is my only concern,

147
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,080
because I have not slept properly, Jean Pierre.

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,440
Ah, it's like a chef that's French and Italian.

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
The surveillance state, basically.

150
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
Because I've not slept, I don't know if my reading skills

151
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
are gonna be down dramatically.

152
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
Thank you again, Pearlie, for those gifted subs.

153
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,800
I appreciate you.

154
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I actually need to check if I have any more emotes slots.

155
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,400
I might actually have more unlocked.

156
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,040
Just like real life.

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,640
Exactly, Reefling.

158
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,840
What's that about the high table?

159
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,960
Sean, you're gonna be so cooked on this one, honestly.

160
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,320
Right, so we're just gonna get into it.

161
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
It's a bit of a reading simulator,

162
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,200
but please don't worry, I'll read.

163
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Please do tell me if the music's too loud

164
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,600
or anything over my life.

165
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't record yourself peeing literally in 1984.

166
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,400
Okay, that's when you're allowed to be mad, so.

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
We're just starting a fresh, clean game.

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
We'll go from the start.

169
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Is this game about surveillance?

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,880
That is, congratulations.

171
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
You've been selected for the Orwell test base.

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,560
Please create a profile, enter your name.

173
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,080
Big G, E, you know what, I'll put Reefling.

174
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
Reefling, next step.

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Please choose a profile picture.

176
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,000
Reefling, what do you look like?

177
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,160
I guess that guy.

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
Are you old?

179
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
No, that's an OG, son.

180
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, this is like really weird.

181
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah, I guess that's you, Reefling.

182
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Let's go.

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Is that a joke?

184
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,920
Oh, it's not a joke.

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
Okay, let's say, can I just play the game?

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,280
Wait, oh, come on, that's a bit ironic.

187
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,400
Okay, that one was a bit ironic.

188
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
What the fuck was that?

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,440
No, the neck bear reddit mod, the old lady.

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,520
Shawnee, when do you have to make you do a sleep stream

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,080
just so we could finally, oh, honestly.

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,880
Please agree to the following terms.

193
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,200
I am aware my actions will severely impact

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,040
the lives of the citizens of the nation.

195
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,120
I will work thoroughly and judge objectively

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
to the best of my belief.

197
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,160
While working, I will adhere to the law and jurisdiction.

198
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,280
Yeah, sure, sure.

199
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Setting up pro.

200
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
For ensuring the safety, thank you,

201
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,000
for ensuring the safety of the nation's people.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,640
Your registration is now complete.

203
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,120
Please wait, logging in.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Freedom Plaza.

205
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,360
I would do a sleep and stream, but afar in my sleep.

206
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Oh, my God, we're losing 1,000 social credit right now

207
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
in China, for even acknowledging the system.

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,520
Mummy, about to come to CIA, agent's best friend

209
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,640
exposed to all our degeneracy.

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
Enemy spotted.

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

212
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
Oh, OK.

213
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,040
Oh, right, OK.

214
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
On a bus?

215
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,280
15 social credit purchasing,

216
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,480
being chilling ice cream is not illegal.

217
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
We're done for.

218
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I completely forgot how this game.

219
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I thought it was a text-based simulator.

220
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Whoa, that's bright.

221
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
The clocks were striking 13.

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
That's not possible.

223
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Eh, Symes, you're online.

224
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Good.

225
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Call me Symes.

226
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I'll be your advisor on Orwell.

227
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Together, we will form both the first and the last line

228
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
of defence against terrorism.

229
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
For the test phase, you are one of the first people

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,360
to try out the Orwell system under real circumstances.

231
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Nothing happened.

232
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Everything's normal, citizens.

233
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Go back home.

234
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Selected from thousands of applicants from across the globe.

235
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, and you picked me of all people with the tinfoil hat on.

236
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I bet you did.

237
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Normally, congratulations would be in order,

238
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
but as you can see from that footage,

239
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
there has been an incident.

240
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
So let's get started.

241
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I've activated the reader tool for you.

242
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Its purpose is storing bookmarks to online websites

243
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
and documents for easy access and to highlight

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
when there is new info to be investigated.

245
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
First, I want you to be informed of the situation.

246
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Our leading newspaper, The National Beholder,

247
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
will bring you up to speed.

248
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,360
HR a bit lacking to be fair.

249
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I feel like this game is about to have so many triggers.

250
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
All right, headlines.

251
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Let's see what the headlines are loading.

252
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,360
So, Bomba obliterates freedom memorial and kills three.

253
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Feel free to browse The National Beholder.

254
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I've activated the pro-filer.

255
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Open the unknown person's file case once you're done.

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Nations in tri-filth, what?

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Tri-filth failed?

258
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Pay par...

259
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Oh my God, I can't even read it all.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Par-gay-cyan.

261
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Par-guess-ian.

262
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
President.

263
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Aborts negotiations with opposition.

264
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Violent riots in tri-filth.

265
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Blaine encourages renewal.

266
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Jeez, Louise.

267
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Hey, Stormy.

268
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I'm just coming from Sheevee's Twitter space.

269
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
It was really fun.

270
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
She highly recommends it.

271
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
What?

272
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm using it.

273
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Maybe shoot complete.

274
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
So, what does it say?

275
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Proximately Wednesday evening, a device popped its clogs.

276
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
According to the official police reports, three folk were killed

277
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,360
and at least five bystanders were severely wounded.

278
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,360
The freedom memorial was nearly completely destroyed.

279
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Police closed off the area.

280
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Prime Minister Blaine immediately issued a press statement

281
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
and put the nation on high alert.

282
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Study with the future.

283
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
She was using Twitter space to read miles.

284
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Parmesan President.

285
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
President Cheese.

286
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Unknown person.

287
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Date birth address.

288
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Oh, okay.

289
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,360
The profile holds all known information on those we investigate.

290
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
The profile you've offered does our main suspect.

291
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,360
The blue-haired woman that the CCTV footage shows before the assault

292
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
is no stranger to the police.

293
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Take a look at their arrest record.

294
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Yes, I will take a look at the arrest record.

295
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Where is it?

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm clicking.

297
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
I'm clicking.

298
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
I don't want that to...

299
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Um...

300
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
The arrest record.

301
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I know exactly where that is.

302
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Yes.

303
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Yep.

304
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Okay.

305
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Log out.

306
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Nope.

307
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Don't close.

308
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Right.

309
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Hold on.

310
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Hold on.

311
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Hold on.

312
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
We're having a few issues.

313
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Okay.

314
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Watergate.

315
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Watergate Cassandra.

316
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
The highlighted elements in the records are pieces of data that are able to be extracted.

317
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
We call these elements data chunks.

318
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Hovering over data chunks will reveal their relevance to the case

319
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
and any connections or information it may influence.

320
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Drop and drag all data chunks from the police database

321
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,360
into a profile to upload them to our servers.

322
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,360
So, Watergate Cassandra is a name.

323
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,360
So, we upload her name.

324
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Yeah.

325
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Okay.

326
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
So, her name's Cassandra.

327
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Arrest date doesn't...

328
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Suspect was arrested on site.

329
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I don't see any other data chunk.

330
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh, I guess her picture.

331
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Sorry.

332
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Of course, she has blue hair and pronouns.

333
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Wait, unironically does she?

334
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Very good.

335
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Enter the names or critical information for Orwell to study a person and identify.

336
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Information and documents can only become a data chunk

337
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
when it is clearly been assigned to a targeted person.

338
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Add the reason for Miss Watergate's prior arrest has just been unlocked.

339
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
We will need this info to progress.

340
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
So, she did assault on a police officer.

341
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I came...

342
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Where is my complimentary FBI hat?

343
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
No, no, no.

344
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
We're tinfoil here.

345
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
We're tinfoil gang.

346
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,360
With the data you extracted from the police record,

347
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
a new document can now be assessed.

348
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Now, let me ask you a question.

349
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Do you believe in coincidences?

350
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
I do not.

351
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Find data revealing where she attacked the police officer

352
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
and you will see what I mean.

353
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Okay, what?

354
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Suspect was arrested on site after Officer Franklin

355
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
had been struck by an unknown object

356
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
and became unresponsive.

357
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,360
The protestor at the origin of the assault

358
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
was forcefully removed with the suspect

359
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
who saw kneeling and weeping on the ground.

360
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
When asked to lay on the ground with her hands behind her back,

361
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
the suspect cooperated immediately.

362
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Wait, so she paid attention right away?

363
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Why was she greeting?

364
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Coincidence, I think.

365
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
No, yeah, why was she greeting?

366
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Guess what, I don't know.

367
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
I'm not really sure.

368
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Is this woman a terrorist?

369
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Whoa, they're already printing it?

370
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Women allegedly injured a police officer

371
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
two weeks ago remains in custody,

372
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
trial scheduled for August.

373
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Wait, that's not possible.

374
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
The incident occurred during a rampage

375
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
at the Freedom Plaza as part of a demonstration,

376
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
so it's the same location again.

377
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Freedom Plaza.

378
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
The exact same location as the assault,

379
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,360
then she turns up there right before the explosion,

380
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
surely not a coinky dink.

381
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
As you know, Miss Watergate's still running around freely.

382
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
We should find out why.

383
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
We should also gather more background information.

384
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I want to know who we're really dealing with.

385
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
No, don't be sorry for being late, silly goers.

386
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
You're not late at all.

387
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Who is an artist by profession.

388
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Okay, so we've got a job.

389
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Related document found.

390
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Oh yes, one who does street art

391
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
by blowing memorials to pieces by any chance.

392
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Okay, so she did.

393
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Great, you've found another document.

394
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Before we go on, let's clarify your job.

395
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Again, we're just in the tutorial section,

396
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
so don't be surprised there's a few pop-ups, okay?

397
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Great, you've found another document.

398
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Before we go on, let's clarify your job

399
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
and how it affects mine, shall we?

400
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,360
You have extracted all the info I already knew about her.

401
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Starting now, I'm going into it blind.

402
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,360
The Orwell ethical codex dictates

403
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
that investigators like yourself

404
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
are the only ones allowed to access documents

405
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
of targeted persons.

406
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Advisors like me only get to see the data

407
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
provided by the investigators.

408
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
We will then draw conclusions and request action.

409
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Your primary job is to provide information

410
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,360
you deem important, never give away

411
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
incorrect or misleading data.

412
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
You may hit disable on a data chunk

413
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
you do not want to pass on to Orwell.

414
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
However, some data chunks might be necessary

415
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
to progress on a case.

416
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Curious.

417
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,360
So, we have the option to ignore

418
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,360
something we don't like.

419
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
So that's the exact same picture.

420
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Due to the chaotic nature,

421
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
police have not yet been able to

422
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,360
connect the crime by the artist,

423
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
has denied the accusation completely

424
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
and has asked their fans to show their support.

425
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
A trial has now been scheduled for mid-August.

426
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Ooh, fancy.

427
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Cassandra's portfolio.

428
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, I've got a new four-wall brochure.

429
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Shoving new four-wall on her.

430
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
She's very smiley.

431
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh, just for play.

432
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Wait, you know what?

433
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Oh no, we've got multiple if we wanted this one.

434
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
The accusatory.

435
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Hmm, something's not going on here.

436
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

437
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
It's been a hot minute since the last

438
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
was this game.

439
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
I wonder if you can frame people.

440
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Hi, I'm Cassandra.

441
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
A colorful inhabitant of Wonderland

442
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
right behind the rainbow.

443
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Bet you are.

444
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Glad you found me.

445
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Finally found the courage to quit my dull

446
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
and focus on art career.

447
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
So she's an artist.

448
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
My U-Tail account.

449
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Well, that's her job,

450
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
so I guess she can be an artist.

451
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Previously, Claire job.

452
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Yeah, that's fine.

453
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Hmm, interesting.

454
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Find out what job that was.

455
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
And then my account name is this.

456
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Wonderlandster.

457
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
She reminds me of Nikki from Honeycap.

458
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
No, Nikki, but the bad end.

459
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Good, you found a chat handle.

460
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
That will allow us to overhear any conversations

461
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
on that account.

462
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
How far fetched is this?

463
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Surely this doesn't occur in real life,

464
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
and this is all fantasy based.

465
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Anyway, hydration check, briefly.

466
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
The listener

467
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
has now been unlocked.

468
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
New conversations will appear

469
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
whenever they are started.

470
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
So we're going to listen in

471
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
on a conversation.

472
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Oh, she's not online.

473
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Well, I guess, no.

474
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
What's she got?

475
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
She's got pudders.

476
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
My beloved furball.

477
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Kikiko.

478
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Kikiko.

479
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Kikiko.

480
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Yep, the beaut is me.

481
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I was never sure about the title,

482
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Businessman's Forgotten Daughter.

483
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Daughter of an in-entrepreneur.

484
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Very...

485
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh, listener.

486
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Who's she talking to?

487
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Hey, you.

488
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Hey, Jossie.

489
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Dot, dot, dot.

490
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Oh, he's typing, sorry.

491
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
I can't seem to find my credit card.

492
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I assume you took it right.

493
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
You got me, Sherlock.

494
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Put the cat in the database.

495
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Oh, is this her man?

496
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I'm in the middle of buying all the Boston

497
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
with that platinum card.

498
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I lifted.

499
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Stolen a credit card from an unknown person.

500
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I think that's her boo.

501
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I don't... I don't think we...

502
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
We say that.

503
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
We're lucky for you.

504
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I don't mind you going on a splurge

505
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
as long as you pick up some wine for dinner.

506
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Yeah, they're mine.

507
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Wine, what does Yosef Langley,

508
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
my fearless attorney,

509
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
and all-round badass have...

510
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
create new profiles?

511
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Sure, that's on him.

512
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Okay.

513
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
You now have a profile and a related person.

514
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
It could be access for you as a profiler.

515
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Date chunks will only appear for target persons.

516
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine though.

517
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Let's get back into her.

518
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Guess I better pick up tons of wine.

519
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
You'll have to get this client of yours

520
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
pretty buzzed to handle all that business.

521
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
One bottle should be fine, she's a lightweight.

522
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Okay, I guess I shouldn't pick up some of those

523
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
party pills from Big Pharma.

524
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Aki, my parent.

525
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Daughter of...

526
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Ooh!

527
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Wait.

528
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
If you have Big Pharma parents,

529
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
what the fuck is...

530
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Watergate Pharma, that does ring a bell.

531
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Ooh!

532
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Yeah, maybe.

533
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Gotta go now, text you later.

534
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Exo, exo!

535
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
She's dating...

536
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
A date from my darling.

537
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
She's in a relationship, okay.

538
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Well, it was supposed to be...

539
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay, there we go, we've scraped this website,

540
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
so we're gonna go back.

541
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Procedure...

542
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Closing raises...

543
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Manipulation speculation.

544
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Oh, that's her boo.

545
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Orwell informs me you just encountered

546
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
conflicting data chunks.

547
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Whenever the content of two data chunks

548
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
are odds with one another,

549
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
they will be shown as a conflict.

550
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
When you extract one of the data chunks,

551
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
containing a conflict,

552
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,360
the others will become invalid immediately.

553
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I'd highly recommend that you clarify

554
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
in the context before you proceed.

555
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Though this is your decision,

556
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,360
once information's been parsed,

557
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
there is no way to reverse the choice.

558
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Okay.

559
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Are we ready?

560
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Oh, let's not fuck up.

561
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Am I in the way?

562
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
I need to be smaller.

563
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
I don't want to be too small.

564
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
I don't know.

565
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
I don't know if I made myself smaller or made it worse.

566
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Okay.

567
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
The case that is almost the center media attention

568
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
last month's come to an end.

569
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Cassandra was acquitted for allegedly assault

570
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
with the case being closed due to lack of evidence.

571
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
However, the case might be reopened

572
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
with new evidence being discovered.

573
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
The suspect's lawyer,

574
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
at no point has there been any valid evidence

575
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
that my client was guilty.

576
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
No point at all.

577
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Meanwhile, the relatives of the victim

578
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
expressed their disappointment on hearing

579
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
the result of the lawsuit.

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
They openly voiced concerns that

581
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
the wealthy family of the accused

582
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
might have influenced her favor.

583
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
The victim, a father of two...

584
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Well, actually, I'm inclined to believe

585
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
there was lack of evidence because she was

586
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
beaten and she didn't resist the rest.

587
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
So, I'm actually going to submit this one.

588
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
But she was green.

589
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
And she didn't resist.

590
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
If you resist, then, yeah.

591
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
This is what I figure.

592
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,360
A pity that the CCTV did not actually help.

593
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Maybe it will today.

594
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
So, how do I...

595
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
add her re-boyfriend?

596
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
You.

597
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Doesn't let me add his face?

598
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
No?

599
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Okay.

600
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
I don't undo that.

601
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Hold on.

602
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Right, back to her, back to her.

603
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
You don't have to resist

604
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
in your above-law correlation causation.

605
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Indeed.

606
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Why would someone...

607
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Why would someone, by their full name,

608
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
one month member...

609
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
What?

610
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
What are you saying?

611
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Time to become big brother.

612
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Steady on, penthouse.

613
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Amy's back, don't worry.

614
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Right.

615
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
What is this?

616
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
Watergate pharmaceuticals.

617
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Let's just have a little...

618
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Ooh, lots of...

619
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh, that's what you use to regain your...

620
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
See if your brain can put together

621
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
what the joke I'm forming.

622
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Okay, let's check you out.

623
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
The company.

624
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Ooh, is it her dad?

625
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
No?

626
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,360
That was before she got...

627
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,360
No, no, she got blue hair to symbolize.

628
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
She's radicalized.

629
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Get wrecked.

630
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
That's hilarious.

631
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
So, she was...

632
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Is that actually the same person?

633
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
She got fucking radicalized

634
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
and now she's blue.

635
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Okay.

636
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Well, she was the junior.

637
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
She's giving it up.

638
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Right, her mom and dad.

639
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Her mom and dad.

640
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Okay, I see.

641
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Now, keeping it a family affair.

642
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
So...

643
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Update.

644
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Junior...

645
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
No, she left it.

646
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Documents that you already have reviewed

647
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
maybe update from time to time as events unfold.

648
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
The reader will notify you when that happens.

649
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
The National Beholder just published

650
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
a new article.

651
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
You may want to take a look

652
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
and see if there's any new information available.

653
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Curious.

654
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Is there anything else on the jobs?

655
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Can I get hired?

656
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Not...

657
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Not, you know, feeling it?

658
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Okay, fine.

659
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Fine, fine.

660
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,360
So yeah, this is basically a click simulator,

661
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
but yeah.

662
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Crane breaks continue to drop.

663
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
The bomb.

664
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Wait, am I supposed to invest together?

665
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
The safety bill.

666
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Go on then.

667
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
What's the safety bill?

668
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
I wanna know.

669
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
What's the safety bill?

670
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Crimes pair.

671
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
The safety bill is passed.

672
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
The party is elected to government.

673
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Ooh.

674
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Nineteen.

675
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Eight.

676
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
So you mean to tell me that this woman

677
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
quit her QC100K job

678
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
to pursue art?

679
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Honestly.

680
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Honestly.

681
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Honestly.

682
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
The...

683
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Parge is peacekeeping.

684
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Oh, the parge is the baddies.

685
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Goodness me.

686
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Talk about readings in your ear.

687
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Wait, the headline says it's got an update,

688
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
but we are on this one.

689
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
It might be introled.

690
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
There's a red symbol.

691
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
I did get updated.

692
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Hmm.

693
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm missing something.

694
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
What?

695
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
It says there's something here.

696
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
It must be to do with the safety bill, no?

697
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
There's a bit of information

698
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
we're supposed to be extracting here,

699
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
and I can't find it.

700
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Come on, game high.

701
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Light it for me so I thought

702
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
to use my brain.

703
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Due to recent stabilization,

704
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
we've been able to reduce

705
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
the number of station guards.

706
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Okay.

707
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Participate.

708
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Become a party.

709
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
What?

710
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Safety bill, just temporary, so.

711
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Whoa, we've got the leaders.

712
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Look at all those people and stuff.

713
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Parge is peacekeeping.

714
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Okay, we get it.

715
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
We get it, good, good.

716
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I don't see any information position.

717
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
The five pillars of the great nation.

718
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Safety and security.

719
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Economy and commerce.

720
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Values and tradition.

721
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Migration and foreign affairs.

722
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Education and health.

723
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
The five pillars.

724
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Okay, okay, we get it.

725
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Right.

726
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
What does that blue mean at company?

727
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
What does the blue mean,

728
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
that this information, can I not?

729
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Well, she is an artist.

730
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I guess that way everything stays in the family.

731
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Being an artist and a junior seems a bit odd.

732
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
She also mentioned she'd quit a dull job.

733
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Yeah, okay, well that's why I didn't put that down

734
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
because she quit it.

735
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Okay.

736
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Okay, I'm starting to get it.

737
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm starting to get it.

738
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Right, jobs.

739
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
What's going on here?

740
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,360
We are urgently looking for a replacement.

741
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Okay.

742
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
You gotta go back to work, Rip.

743
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Thank you for hanging though.

744
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Please don't worry, this is a bit of a,

745
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
this is rather low energy.

746
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
We're gonna have a lot more fun streams next week,

747
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
I promise.

748
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Or maybe I was wrong and nothing stays in the family.

749
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Yup, this is probably what she meant by quitting her job.

750
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Good.

751
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Ooh, currently I'm thinking that our Miss Watergate

752
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
underwent quite a radical change, don't you agree?

753
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Let's find out what happened

754
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
in between these two lives of hers.

755
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
What may have caused this shift?

756
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Let's find out.

757
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Because that timelines, what's timelines?

758
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Oh, it's like Facebook.

759
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
Oh my God.

760
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,360
1992, she's old.

761
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Do you remember in September?

762
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
I love the soft spoken art.

763
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,360
It's not the soft, me is just exhausted.

764
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Look at all those, look at all those Eggman's profile.

765
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
She has an interest in art music and activism.

766
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Well, there you go.

767
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
It's not that old.

768
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
1992, hag, that's weird.

769
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Art music and activism, what a line up.

770
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
She only just called me old.

771
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
I don't mean that you're older.

772
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
I like it.

773
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
What do you mean someone so young and tiny

774
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,360
has so much control over you?

775
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,360
I mean, they mess up over a little bit.

776
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Sorry, 1992, bro, is what you're old.

777
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Yes, I'm old.

778
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Bones are decaying.

779
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
They're becoming like powder.

780
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Woohoo, first day freed and far away from the shackles.

781
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,360
So she didn't like her jab.

782
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Despite, oh, despite puppets,

783
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,360
the spies you have finally managed to destroy.

784
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
So there's nothing left to do.

785
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
You can get there.

786
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
My person wishes for you deep as the best.

787
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Opposes the government.

788
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
What's the matter?

789
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
That doesn't sound like you haven't hung out for ages.

790
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Mary, shut your frickin' mouth, okay?

791
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm not in the mood for your stupid act.

792
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I told you again and again.

793
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
I can't deal with this right now.

794
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
You know what?

795
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm really sorry that I still care about my best friend.

796
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,360
No matter how often she decides to give me the cold shoulder.

797
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Because she's in a relationship.

798
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Okay, we can confirm that.

799
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,360
You're randomly with the lawyer who might be noteworthy.

800
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Is this the beholder?

801
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Yeah, no, we knew it was him.

802
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Hold on, go back to the timeline, please.

803
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Right, you opposed the government.

804
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
No, no, no, can't have that.

805
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Being against the government is very sus.

806
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Well, well, Miss Watergate, we aren't too fond of you either.

807
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Conflicting data.

808
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,360
I don't know what the conflict is, though.

809
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
At least you are redeemed.

810
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I want to blow off some steam together late night shopping.

811
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Not today, I have a date this evening.

812
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
Ooh, who's the lucky one?

813
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Case closed, congrats.

814
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
I never had any.

815
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Wait, Mary just seems really nice.

816
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Oh my God, isn't that the singer of the gorillas?

817
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Failed goods.

818
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Failed goods.

819
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Camels looking down on the camel's back.

820
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Hydration check.

821
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
You know who I mean, though.

822
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I forgot his name.

823
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Okay, what's looking...

824
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Oh, here we go.

825
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,360
Cassandra Shobin of the world is singing now.

826
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
The concert is amazing, amazing.

827
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
I just had to give my hair a little makeover,

828
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
so without further ado, how do you like it?

829
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Okay, so she changed her hair for a concert.

830
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Cassie's gone punk.

831
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Did Momay and Daddy agree with that?

832
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Eggs, D.

833
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Looks nice.

834
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
What new you?

835
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
You also need a new name.

836
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
What about this?

837
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
That's the spirit girl now.

838
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
I'd like to invite you to our little activist group

839
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
if you want to join us.

840
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
It would be nice to have you in the protest.

841
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Oh my God.

842
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
I can't believe that the gorillas are against the government.

843
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
An activist group.

844
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Is there anything more specific?

845
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
So hence what Cassandra Shobin known to the world is

846
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
Cassarthus.

847
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
It's not going to actually update her name.

848
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Is this like a code name?

849
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
You guys get given code names?

850
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
An alias.

851
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Okay, okay, okay.

852
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
An alias name.

853
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
You know people on the web.

854
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
So many names, so many identities.

855
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
It's always good to recover or record any alias.

856
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Then we can match data chunks.

857
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Okay.

858
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Oh, there's a conversation.

859
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Did I miss a conversation?

860
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Oops, I did.

861
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Oh no, here we go.

862
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Recording starts.

863
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Let's go.

864
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Hey, did you hear about the

865
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
La Bomba?

866
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Yeah, don't remind me.

867
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
You know I have history with that place.

868
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
So she's saying she wasn't there.

869
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
The plot thickens.

870
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
She's going by girls.

871
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Already messing with me.

872
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Enough that I have to catch a bus from there every day.

873
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Catches a bus every day.

874
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Okay, so we have evidence of her being at the location

875
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
due to that bus comment.

876
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Meaning her presence there before the Bomba

877
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
could be a coincidence after all.

878
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I'll reserve my thoughts and tell more evidence.

879
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I'm so

880
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
co-member of thought,

881
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
member of a group of people

882
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
who have thought,

883
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
member of a group called thought.

884
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
If you would not have gone to the protest,

885
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
you never would have been wrongfully,

886
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
we'll keep that information wherever that is.

887
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
You are not a,

888
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
whoa, an activist group called thought,

889
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
interesting, maybe this is what,

890
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
the thought police, but the other way.

891
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
We should find something that shows

892
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
our current attitude to see if we're following

893
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
the right person.

894
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah, I would not have been called

895
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
an activist in all the papers.

896
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
You are not one, okay?

897
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Aren't I?

898
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
You sure?

899
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

900
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Ka-ching!

901
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
What?

902
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Is that supposed to be my credit card

903
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
and the cash register?

904
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Something like that, I guess.

905
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
I hope you, like, a

906
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
shatoo-monger.

907
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
And me just cringed, I'm sorry.

908
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Great.

909
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
So you've decided to bankrupt me.

910
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
I'm your boyfriend, Yosef.

911
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Uh, okay.

912
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Here's the thing,

913
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
I've got an important appointment tonight.

914
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
It's surprisingly out on my schedule

915
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
and I can't postpone it.

916
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Postpone it!

917
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
You've gotta be kidding me!

918
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
I want that thing!

919
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm very sorry, darling.

920
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
We'll have to see each other tomorrow, Cookie.

921
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
You always have an appointment

922
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
exclamation mark one.

923
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Appointment here, appointment there,

924
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
appointment fucking everywhere!

925
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,360
How can you constantly do this to me?

926
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Darling, please just calm down.

927
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Have you taken your drugs?

928
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Oh my god.

929
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Suspect is, is on, on drugs.

930
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Wait, can you look that up for me?

931
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Yeah, yeah, in a minute.

932
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Fine.

933
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
If you don't show up at the appointment,

934
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I risk losing a very important appointment.

935
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Is he cheating on her?

936
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
You know, I feel like if you're a lawyer,

937
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
you have to make time for,

938
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
if a client comes first and through your doors,

939
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
you have to deal with it there and then.

940
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
No, no, I totally understand.

941
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't you risk losing that very important client.

942
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Don't be like that.

943
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Come on, you know the, the de-fire.

944
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
The de-fire!

945
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
I get it.

946
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
I guess I'm just not an important client anymore.

947
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Oh, come on, Kathy.

948
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Going home now in case I'm getting up

949
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
on that priority list.

950
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Please.

951
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
And then the session,

952
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
this one goes right.

953
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Let's go figure out the product

954
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
that began with an M,

955
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
anti-depressant.

956
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Oh no, she's so volatile

957
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
on anti-depressants.

958
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Yeah, so I think we're going to be fine.

959
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Oh, I clicked off that.

960
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Looking at what you've experienced so far,

961
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
we're dealing with a potentially dangerous personality.

962
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
I will indicate that to law enforcement.

963
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
What?

964
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
What are you doing?

965
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
What anti-depressants?

966
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Right.

967
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
I don't know what the conflicting thing is

968
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
with this Mary.

969
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Having an amazing tour with Mary,

970
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
my best friend.

971
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Right.

972
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
So she says best friend

973
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
and this is her with brown hair

974
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
at the best friend stage.

975
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Just discovered this new band

976
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
The Targets, Man in the Rock.

977
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Who's coming?

978
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Punk's not my style.

979
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Sorry, can't we just go see cherry cheeks sometime?

980
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Well, you can see my cherry cheeks

981
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,360
any day we film.

982
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
They are just not some punks.

983
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Their lead singers are real cutie

984
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
and they've got a...

985
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Plus they've got a message.

986
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Why not?

987
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
No, sorry, it's not for me.

988
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
And then what?

989
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
She starts changing.

990
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Oh my God, what happened to you?

991
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Oh, she's not replying to Mary at all here.

992
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Congrats, I never had any doubts.

993
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Oh, but she's not replying to Mary here.

994
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
She's only replying to Juliet and

995
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Guerrilla Man.

996
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Oh, they did fall out.

997
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
They have a broken friendship

998
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
because Cassandra's been a weirdo.

999
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Guerrilla Man.

1000
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Yeah, broken house ad.

1001
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Yeah, and she got radicalized

1002
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
and doesn't want to talk to her pal anymore.

1003
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Right, the thoughts.

1004
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
The thoughts are free.

1005
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
If liberty means anything at all,

1006
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
it means the right to tell people

1007
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
what they do not want to hear.

1008
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
George Orwell.

1009
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
It's thickened.

1010
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Oh my God.

1011
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
Step one, secure the case.

1012
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Okay.

1013
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
This is forbidden.

1014
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Oh no, is everything broken?

1015
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Let's do that.

1016
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, there's her alias name.

1017
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Oh, she's already linked to all her stuff.

1018
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
We know about you.

1019
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Step eight, Rizloth.

1020
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
For you, Mason.

1021
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Not for me.

1022
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Need to get some work done today.

1023
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
I'll have to catch the rest of the blood.

1024
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Okay, thank you for hanging.

1025
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Please don't worry, this is very, very low energy game.

1026
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
So this is just chilling in the background stuff.

1027
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
So don't worry.

1028
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
We're even at Freedom Plaza.

1029
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Is that just me?

1030
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Or is that ironic?

1031
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
You probably all know me.

1032
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
It's either that blue-haired punk bi-youch.

1033
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,360
Oh my God.

1034
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
These are only some of the names

1035
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
that we called during the criminal investigation.

1036
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
That was because in the middle of the chaos,

1037
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
someone believed to have seen me hurt an officer.

1038
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
It never even occurred to anybody that it wasn't me.

1039
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
We were there because we wanted a peaceful protest.

1040
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
We have always been against violence.

1041
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
Hmm.

1042
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
And what's the conflicting data?

1043
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
One would assume that in the age where

1044
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
all the camps are everywhere,

1045
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
I don't even find the conflicting piece.

1046
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
By goldfells.

1047
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Where's the conflicting piece of information?

1048
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Alright, someone called Guest.

1049
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Hey, interesting name by the way.

1050
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
Just stumbled upon your new blog and some truth here.

1051
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
The web was born in the sense of ultimate freedom

1052
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
to be who you want to be and express yourself.

1053
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Now that the government has threatened this

1054
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
with real name policies and stuff,

1055
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
saves your IP, so you can look up who you are.

1056
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Wasn't there...

1057
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Right, okay, this is Tinfoil Talk.

1058
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
This is me, Tinfoil Talk.

1059
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
I'm sure I saw a post that was like,

1060
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,360
oh, sweet man-made thing beyond my comprehension.

1061
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,360
And it was like, your PC can clock your room details

1062
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
and the inside schematics of your house.

1063
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
And I'm like, 99% sure that got proved

1064
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,360
because it has like, something with it that can do that.

1065
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
But I don't know if that's Tinfoil or if that's real real

1066
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
and I fell for like a coffee past or something.

1067
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Oh, sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension.

1068
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Yay!

1069
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
The best part of this game is when you start getting

1070
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
how bad all the things are and you're doing the spine.

1071
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
It can be done now, yeah, they use your router, yeah.

1072
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah, hardware, back doors, and tracking every device.

1073
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Rep.

1074
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Okay, I thought I was making it up, but I guess it's real.

1075
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Hello, admin.

1076
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I'd like to say, could you be one...

1077
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
To get a service on search engine, other...

1078
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Oh, is this just a fucking random mail?

1079
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
What do you say?

1080
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Well, if you don't have one before,

1081
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
you've just gained yourself your first follower.

1082
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Okay, let's go on his profile.

1083
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Hmm, it's got five articles.

1084
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,360
Okay, and I'm guessing all the archive ones are inaccessible.

1085
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
So, this has got conflicting.

1086
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,360
There's a conflicting with show the conflict.

1087
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,360
No, I don't know where it is.

1088
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
No, it's not showing me where it is.

1089
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Oh, no, I'm gonna have to find it like a good girl.

1090
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Finally, someone who has the...

1091
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
Oh, you've kind of fucked up with that one.

1092
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
I have to admit.

1093
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,360
You can't say you're about peace,

1094
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
but then go on Facebook and be like,

1095
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
XD.

1096
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Finally, someone who has the grit and explosives

1097
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,360
to show how futile surveillance is.

1098
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,360
C's assault justified for showing the futility of the surveillance.

1099
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
Ooh.

1100
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
Really cat?

1101
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
You're laughing at people being killed.

1102
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
Are you out of your mind?

1103
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah, I'm sorry, but, bro, that's very tasteless.

1104
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
I suspected as much.

1105
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
Seems like we're looking at the right person.

1106
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
I don't think it was her that did it,

1107
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
but she's a sympathizer.

1108
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
All right.

1109
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,360
What we've found out so far is a good and interesting,

1110
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
but I think we should be searching for something a little more concrete.

1111
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
We have to dig deeper.

1112
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
Okay.

1113
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Listening into a conversation.

1114
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Absolutely.

1115
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,360
Juliet.

1116
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Hello.

1117
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Hi, Jules.

1118
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Is this so much fellow?

1119
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Cass, I just want to know.

1120
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Wanted to know.

1121
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
You're post on timelines about the assault.

1122
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
You really shouldn't write stuff like that.

1123
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Really, Jules, you're not going to preach to me about this stupid post, are you?

1124
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
No.

1125
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
I just wanted to know what's wrong, Cass.

1126
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
It's nothing just between the two of us.

1127
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
I just had to let off steam, you know?

1128
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
It's because of what happened, isn't it?

1129
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Yeah, and lots and lots of other stuff, too.

1130
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,360
The bombing stirred up all this crap again.

1131
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
You know, what I did.

1132
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
What did you do?

1133
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
What happened there wasn't your fault.

1134
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,360
Hey, Miss Tinfoil, what's the game about?

1135
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Tinfoil?

1136
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
You'll never guess.

1137
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,360
Tinfoil?

1138
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
Cass, you hurt that officer to save me and you succeeded.

1139
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
You mustn't forget about that.

1140
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
How can it not have been my fault?

1141
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,360
Juliet, I smashed a freaking skull of a father because I lost it.

1142
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Wait, what?

1143
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,360
Admit guilt towards for having injured the officer.

1144
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
To protect them.

1145
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Well, it was a protection job, so I'll let you.

1146
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
I'll let you injure the officer to protect.

1147
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
What? Where did that come from?

1148
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
This is perfect. We can arrest her and open the investigation again.

1149
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,360
However, we probably won't be able to hold her for long if that really happened in defense.

1150
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Very good work.

1151
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,360
The intervention team is already on its way.

1152
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
We'll need to wait for confirmation.

1153
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:46,360
If Miss Water, in Miss Water Gates case, it was not a problem to get her dressed.

1154
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,360
With the help of local police due to her former record.

1155
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Oh, Sheevie's getting a clip of her burp, by the way.

1156
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
I just let you guys should know that.

1157
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,360
And Amy sent me clips of her feet, so don't be shocked when you see shots like that.

1158
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,360
I feel like a butthole and worse kind of butthole.

1159
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,360
I might be free, but not right.

1160
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm not innocent.

1161
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Okay, nobody's innocent.

1162
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
You'll have to let go.

1163
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Okay, we're learning.

1164
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
Oh, wait, she's going back onto her.

1165
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,360
It was a bit late in finding that info.

1166
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Five minutes later, Miss Timfoyle, or oh, she.

1167
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
FBI, open up.

1168
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
I thought about what you said.

1169
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Maybe you're right. I should take the post down.

1170
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Oh, we've already reported it.

1171
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
You're a bit too late.

1172
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
It would be better.

1173
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
Believe me.

1174
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
Are you getting taken down in real time?

1175
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
FBI, open up.

1176
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,360
By the way, how is your boyfriend?

1177
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
You're still together.

1178
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,360
You haven't been talking about him that much lately.

1179
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
Well, not as much as before.

1180
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,360
Oh my God, we're about to literally get it live streamed to us.

1181
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Hello?

1182
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
Are you still there?

1183
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Too late, strong and co-locked you.

1184
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I'll inquire if all went well with arresting Miss Wargate.

1185
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
You did a good job in any case.

1186
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
Although we have no proof she's involved in the bomba.

1187
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
We might be able to question her.

1188
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Despite acting in defense of Australia,

1189
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,360
she seems to be quite unstable and unstable.

1190
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
She's on anti-depressants.

1191
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
She's just, you know,

1192
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
seeing the world for what it is.

1193
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
Okay, I just received information she's in custody.

1194
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,360
Good work.

1195
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
This thought group though, whether they, oh God.

1196
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,360
No, no, no, take a look at the news.

1197
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,360
They struck again.

1198
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
That's horrible.

1199
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
Two dead after second explosion.

1200
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,360
Two dead, similar approach.

1201
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Same letter found.

1202
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
So these are, letter?

1203
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
I don't remember reading a letter.

1204
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,360
And if that wasn't enough already,

1205
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,360
Miss Wargate was in custody.

1206
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
So that's her at the picture,

1207
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
this complicates matters massively.

1208
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
So much for our simple test case.

1209
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
I need to speak to my superiors,

1210
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,360
see how they are to proceed

1211
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,360
given these extenuating circumstances.

1212
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
You did good today.

1213
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
You can log off and get some rest by clicking the button

1214
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,360
on the top right of the desk.

1215
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,360
Try and get some sleep.

1216
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,360
I'm trying.

1217
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
I have a feeling the next few days are going to be bad.

1218
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
Let's see what this is though.

1219
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Explosion self at a university in Bondton,

1220
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,360
at least two passed away, three injured.

1221
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
Once again, a letter has been received

1222
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
just before the crime.

1223
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Second bomb has hit freedom of square.

1224
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Even the game knows I need sleep through.

1225
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Are you sure you want to finish the work for today?

1226
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Oh, I'm pressed.

1227
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Oh.

1228
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,360
What's been undone?

1229
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
There was like one in here.

1230
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
What?

1231
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
A colorful...

1232
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
No.

1233
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
That's not going to disable it.

1234
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,360
Okay.

1235
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,360
Okay, so that's everything.

1236
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360
There was like one thing I omitted.

1237
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360
She celebrates people's death.

1238
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,360
So yeah, I've done that a lot.

1239
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Even for me.

1240
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,360
I have to be back there.

1241
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,360
Bye bye.

1242
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,360
That was the tutorial section done.

1243
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,360
We've already done one out of five.

1244
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Okay.

1245
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,360
Oh, I haven't got an achievement.

1246
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
Complete episode one.

1247
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
That's a lot.

1248
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,360
I just want to say thank you to everyone

1249
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
who's clipping the girls at any point.

1250
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,360
It really helps them find clips faster

1251
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,360
so we can shove them to the editing team.

1252
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
That was the tutorial.

1253
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Yes.

1254
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,360
I'm like 99% sure that was the tutorial.

1255
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
I played this game out quite a few years back now.

1256
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
I don't remember it that well.

1257
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,360
She's been criminally charged in the past

1258
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
with injuring an officer.

1259
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,360
She's an artist.

1260
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360
Former criminal case.

1261
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,360
But got dropped.

1262
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
A second assault.

1263
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,360
Activist group thought.

1264
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,360
So we're going to have to look into that.

1265
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Okay, bedtime.

1266
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Good night guys.

1267
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
See you tomorrow.

1268
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,360
I'm so sleepy.

1269
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,360
I just want to sleep on your chest.

1270
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,360
I want to be like a cat and need into your chest.

1271
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Like me.

1272
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Okay, welcome back.

1273
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Hope you don't mind if we get started right away.

1274
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,360
We have tons of work ahead of us.

1275
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,360
I met with my superiors and they wished

1276
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,360
to continue with the test case.

1277
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,360
They believe in the capability of Orwell

1278
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
to handle this.

1279
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Oh, Andrew of course.

1280
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Yes, me who's behind Orwell.

1281
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Okay, let's go to bed.

1282
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Yeah.

1283
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Gentle.

1284
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Okay, my superiors agreement.

1285
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,360
Based on the information you have already extracted

1286
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,360
the activist group known as Thought

1287
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,360
is worth investigating.

1288
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
It seems that this goldfills

1289
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,360
is an important member of Thought.

1290
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,360
So we now have clearance

1291
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
to consider them a target person.

1292
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,360
Are you going to part two?

1293
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Heck yeah.

1294
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
I'm one like a mmm.

1295
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
When it's good.

1296
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,360
Sleep on our laps if you need rest, honestly.

1297
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,360
I got a really cute fanart yesterday on Twitter.

1298
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
I replied to it if you didn't see it.

1299
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,360
And it was like all these reeflings in bed with me.

1300
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,360
One of them was a furry.

1301
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
They had an echo ears.

1302
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,360
One looked like it had a wee mustache

1303
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
when it was climbing on the bed.

1304
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,360
Another reefling.

1305
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,360
I think it was massage on my shoulders.

1306
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,360
And like there's like three reeflings

1307
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,360
bunched up on the other side of me.

1308
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
It was really cute.

1309
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
I liked it.

1310
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,360
There's Kawainee.

1311
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,360
I only remember like episode four.

1312
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
It was probably my favorite.

1313
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,360
Okay, now that goldfills is a target person

1314
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
there may be a new data chunk

1315
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,360
available in documents you have already

1316
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
accessed.

1317
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Don't forget to go back and recheck your sources.

1318
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
Okay.

1319
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,360
Whoa, we are getting

1320
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,360
a lot of...

1321
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Okay, so that's parents.

1322
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Yosef.

1323
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,360
Yulia.

1324
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,360
Yeah.

1325
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Okay, we've got a little bit of an up the entry one.

1326
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,360
Our thoughts still free.

1327
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Okay, we've got a pic.

1328
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,360
Nope.

1329
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,360
Let's push up on you.

1330
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Let's add your picture, bruv.

1331
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Just needed one reading.

1332
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,360
You go the F to sleep.

1333
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
I might make that.

1334
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,360
I think it's quite humorous.

1335
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,360
Okay, I propose to consider the question

1336
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,360
are our thoughts still free?

1337
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,360
Well, this might seem to be a surprising question.

1338
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,360
In our current world of ever growing digital surveillance

1339
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,360
freedom of thought is no longer self-evident.

1340
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Dear reader, there is a German folk song

1341
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
called the thoughts are free.

1342
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
It goes like this.

1343
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
Thoughts are free.

1344
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Who can guess them?

1345
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,360
They fly like the nocturnal shadows.

1346
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,360
No man can know them.

1347
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,360
No hunter can shoot them with the powder and lead.

1348
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Thoughts are free.

1349
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
I am not reading this properly.

1350
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,360
I think what I want and what delights me

1351
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,360
still always...

1352
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,360
Ah, I don't know these words.

1353
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Okay, when I was a young lad,

1354
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,360
long before I immigrated to the nation in 1993

1355
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,360
memes are free, exactly.

1356
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
That's the best.

1357
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,360
I cannot read chunks like this.

1358
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
It's going to mess with me.

1359
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,360
An immigrant.

1360
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Oh no, the racism starts quick.

1361
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,360
This is why I created this blog.

1362
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,360
Okay, so he's a creator of thoughts,

1363
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,360
which is fine.

1364
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Get to know the thoughts in activist group

1365
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,360
with the same name as this blog.

1366
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,360
If God fails as the one who created the blog,

1367
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,360
perhaps he founded or even the leader of the activist group.

1368
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
Hiya.

1369
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Oh, they're just talking.

1370
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,360
Okay, that's the same comments as before though.

1371
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,360
Mentions focused on thoughts are free.

1372
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,360
I mean, this is such a small nuance.

1373
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
Okay, headlines.

1374
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,360
What's today?

1375
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,360
Connection between the bomba to the gallows.

1376
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,360
Write that down, write that down.

1377
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Random German in the chat that I can't translate.

1378
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Heavy rainstorms expected.

1379
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,360
That's very important.

1380
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Yes, yes.

1381
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,360
Timeline and Rossin announced cooperation.

1382
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,360
Who are they?

1383
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,360
The Davenport siblings, owners of the biggest social network.

1384
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Oh no.

1385
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Everyone's surveilled and said 10 times harder.

1386
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Let's see what the bomba is going on.

1387
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,360
Any highlighting notes?

1388
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,360
No.

1389
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,360
What about this?

1390
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
That is all your personal data.

1391
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,360
Just get on like that.

1392
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,360
We are literally singing the song you saw a minute ago.

1393
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,360
Oh, where he is?

1394
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
I'm so sorry.

1395
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,360
I don't recognize that.

1396
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Cassandra update.

1397
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,360
What's going on with you?

1398
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Oh, she is redacted.

1399
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,360
She's in trouble.

1400
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Okay, there's something here on the website.

1401
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,360
I think.

1402
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,360
Is there something on the website?

1403
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,360
I have a little red mark.

1404
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
Do I really need to...

1405
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,360
Okay, fine.

1406
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,360
Our report thoughts are free.

1407
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
Okay, right.

1408
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Just if it's harmless, report it.

1409
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
The letter.

1410
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
We are right, it seems.

1411
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,360
That's what the letter says.

1412
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,360
The thoughts are free?

1413
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,360
That's terrible.

1414
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,360
If that's true.

1415
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,360
Who's listening?

1416
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,360
Hey, you.

1417
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Hi.

1418
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,360
I'm sorry about last night.

1419
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
I really should have come over.

1420
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360
Well, you didn't.

1421
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,360
So what are you going to say to that?

1422
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
What's the calling card?

1423
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,360
Where did we get it?

1424
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,360
Wait a minute.

1425
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,360
The government doesn't want you to know this,

1426
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,360
but thoughts are free.

1427
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,360
You can just take them.

1428
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Yank.

1429
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,360
It's just that this client is massively influential

1430
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,360
and could have break a whole lot of exposure.

1431
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
I've been trying to get a meeting for months

1432
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,360
and it went rather well.

1433
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
So here's hoping.

1434
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,360
God, I'm such a stupid old man

1435
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,360
who just talks about his job too much.

1436
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
I'm sorry.

1437
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
It's just a big part of my life.

1438
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Hello?

1439
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Are you still upset?

1440
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Oh, he doesn't know that she's in jail.

1441
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
She's got the jail.

1442
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,360
Can you answer me if you don't?

1443
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
I'll start to worry.

1444
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,360
You know what I'm like?

1445
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,360
She's in jail.

1446
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,360
She's in jail.

1447
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,360
You just don't know.

1448
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,360
Okay.

1449
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,360
I thirdly believed we are able to capture minds

1450
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,360
if only we could garner attention to the group.

1451
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,360
After one and a half years recruiting two of my students

1452
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,360
and arranging three demonstrations.

1453
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,360
So he's the one that's kind of mastermind in it a bit.

1454
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,360
Three demonstrations.

1455
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,360
More interesting might be the two students

1456
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
that were involved.

1457
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360
Okay.

1458
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,360
Frankly and sadly, the answer to the latter is a resounding no,

1459
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,360
which was the question was are we true to the initial goal?

1460
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,360
We let ourselves be consumed by anger and hatred

1461
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,360
towards those who did wrong.

1462
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Reacts with hatred and anger about troubled past of thought,

1463
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,360
hinted at troubled past.

1464
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Thoughts are free, but that does not mean that we can attack

1465
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,360
or do whatever they wish instead of blaming others.

1466
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,360
I see now my high aims might well be the cause

1467
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,360
for all of the events of the past months.

1468
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,360
More than anyone else have thought, I feel responsible.

1469
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,360
Hmm.

1470
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,360
Feels responsible.

1471
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,360
Reacts with hatred and anger.

1472
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,360
I think feels responsible.

1473
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,360
Because look, as a consequence, I'll halt my activities.

1474
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,360
So he feels responsible.

1475
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,360
Okay.

1476
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,360
I will halt my activities.

1477
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
Oops, sorry.

1478
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,360
A troubled past, we will have to get to the bottom of this.

1479
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,360
But he's going to stop his activities.

1480
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,360
Oh man, my duck army crew is a violent group.

1481
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,360
Write that down.

1482
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,360
Whatever active engagement means still an interesting fact.

1483
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,360
He is a lecturer at a university.

1484
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,360
Yes.

1485
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
Oh, and we've got a really good thing.

1486
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,360
What now?

1487
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
What now?

1488
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,360
Still again?

1489
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,360
The same still again where the bomb popped its clogs?

1490
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,360
You know what I think about coincidence is I ain't going to repeat it.

1491
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,360
So far the evidence suggests that Goldfels was a prominent lecturer

1492
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,360
and some of his students became involved in thought.

1493
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Did he like recruit them for the cause?

1494
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,360
We need to identify those students.

1495
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,360
See who else is involved in that group.

1496
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Concerned number one.

1497
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
Please reconsider.

1498
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,360
Guy, her, there was only a call.

1499
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,360
They had it coming.

1500
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,360
It was messy, I know.

1501
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,360
You made the news.

1502
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,360
Beryl, thank you for becoming a member for a month.

1503
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,360
A little celebration anniversary.

1504
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
It works on you.

1505
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,360
You didn't put a wee thing.

1506
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,360
You could have put a message.

1507
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,360
I can read it.

1508
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,360
You forgot to put a message.

1509
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,360
It's okay.

1510
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Okay.

1511
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
I'll just make up a message.

1512
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Strongly love.

1513
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,360
Briefing love.

1514
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Okay, I made it for you.

1515
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,360
Continue to main page.

1516
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,360
What's going on here?

1517
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:26,360
Yesterday there was a microwave incident with popcorn in a blue.

1518
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,360
It wrapped itself up in tin foil and blew itself up.

1519
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,360
Are you squidding me right now?

1520
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,360
Nugget.

1521
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,360
Nugget said a message.

1522
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,360
Thank you for becoming a member for a month.

1523
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,360
How do you say it?

1524
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,360
Did I be like, oh, thank you for the repeated membership?

1525
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
Or continued membership?

1526
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Yeah.

1527
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,360
Thank you for the continued membership.

1528
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Why, yes, of course.

1529
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,360
Are you squidding me right now?

1530
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,360
It's already been a month.

1531
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360
That's pretty crazy.

1532
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,360
Honestly, all things considered.

1533
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,360
How did we get here?

1534
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,360
Oh, my God.

1535
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,360
Oh, my God.

1536
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,360
Thanks for the sub.

1537
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,360
Thanks for the second month.

1538
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,360
Oh, yeah, it's technically the thing.

1539
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,360
It's technically the second.

1540
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,360
No, one full month because it starts on zero.

1541
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,360
So this is the first full month.

1542
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,360
Thank you.

1543
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,360
Yeah.

1544
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,360
Oh, you've all got blue seashells now.

1545
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,360
Sally sells seashells by the seashore.

1546
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,360
He's retired.

1547
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
Oops.

1548
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,360
Who's this?

1549
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,360
Oh, it's him.

1550
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,360
Got another picture of him.

1551
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,360
We are in the second month.

1552
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,360
Blue seashell team.

1553
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,360
Being a luminary in his profession.

1554
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,360
Oh, Abraham is his name.

1555
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,360
Gladly accepted that.

1556
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,360
Oh, Abraham is well done.

1557
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:01,360
Professor in the field of media ethics.

1558
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,360
He had sadly retired.

1559
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,360
I've got to wait two more days.

1560
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,360
Can you last two more days?

1561
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,360
Yeah, I think you can.

1562
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,360
Be good and wait.

1563
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,360
Did you notice the bomber seems to be closely connected to thought?

1564
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,360
There could be pattern.

1565
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,360
Thought had held three demonstrations.

1566
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,360
Actually, what I've got a bone effect.

1567
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
Hold on.

1568
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:37,360
I've got a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.

1569
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,360
I have a bone effect with a certain marshmallow.

1570
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,360
I'm going to read it out.

1571
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,360
It was so bad.

1572
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,360
I'm reading it out.

1573
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,360
And you know exactly who you are.

1574
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Who fucking sent this.

1575
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Hold on.

1576
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
Let me find it.

1577
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:56,360
Let me find it.

1578
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,360
Where is it?

1579
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,360
Where is it?

1580
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,360
It was a recent one.

1581
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
That's right.

1582
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,360
You're in trouble, Riflin.

1583
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,360
You're in trouble.

1584
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,360
And you know exactly who you are.

1585
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,360
I'm going to read this.

1586
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Because Riflin, you had nothing but the audacity.

1587
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Imagine I'm railing you in your bedroom

1588
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,360
and your dad comes home early and sees me pounding you

1589
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,360
and slapping your cheeks while you scream harder.

1590
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,360
With that end, okay?

1591
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,360
What if he sees the creation of her child, his grandchild?

1592
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
How embarrassing.

1593
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,360
I'd be so ashamed, Lamal.

1594
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,360
Riflin, who the fuck sent that?

1595
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,360
Who sent that with their whole chest?

1596
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:44,360
Who formulated those letters?

1597
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,360
Which one of you did that?

1598
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:51,360
I know you're cackling behind the keyboard right now.

1599
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:58,360
If I ever, if I ever spot you at a convention,

1600
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:08,360
if I ever, your left ball is getting upped.

1601
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,360
I don't remember sending that now.

1602
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,360
Absolutely not.

1603
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,360
Right.

1604
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Thought has held three demonstrations,

1605
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,360
yet there has only been two bomba,

1606
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,360
which might imply, well, it's definitely shot in the dark,

1607
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,360
but we absolutely need to do everything we can

1608
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,360
to prevent another attack.

1609
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Take a close look at the path of each member with thought.

1610
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,360
Find out the locations of all demonstrations

1611
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,360
that have held that might yield a hint.

1612
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,360
Why only the left one?

1613
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,360
Because I need to pick on one.

1614
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,360
It was either left or right.

1615
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,360
I'll pick on your left ball instead.

1616
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,360
She pops your left ball.

1617
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,360
You'll never have a daughter.

1618
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,360
That's how it works, right?

1619
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,360
No!

1620
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,360
Thought it all works at all.

1621
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,360
That's funny.

1622
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,360
Okay.

1623
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,360
Journalist at Der Reporter.

1624
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,360
One of the most...

1625
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,360
Oh, it's German.

1626
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,360
Sorry.

1627
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,360
Like Der.

1628
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,360
You lose one chromosome that you can pass over.

1629
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,360
Okay.

1630
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,360
Formula G.

1631
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,360
And was also chairman of Global Media...

1632
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,360
Man, this guy has quite the portfolio on him.

1633
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,360
Jeez.

1634
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,360
Chairman of an ethical congress,

1635
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,360
just to average one of the mill.

1636
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,360
Steady on sims.

1637
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,360
I think you've been a bit radicalized yourself, mate.

1638
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,360
Wow, that's a whole lot of information about this fella.

1639
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Yet, only one other page could be indexed.

1640
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,360
Very strange indeed.

1641
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,360
I think the next course of action should be to look for other people of this group,

1642
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,360
like the students he mentioned.

1643
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,360
Thoughts are free.

1644
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,360
Oh, okay.

1645
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,360
This is another link.

1646
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,360
A modern time declaration of independence towards mass surveillance.

1647
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360
Cure it.

1648
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,360
Your genes become joints.

1649
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,360
Well, what do you say to that?

1650
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,360
He literally wrote the book.

1651
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,360
Well, yeah.

1652
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,360
Okay, what's the headline?

1653
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Breaking news.

1654
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,360
First suspect in connection.

1655
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,360
Who?

1656
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,360
Women arrested in connection.

1657
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,360
Oh, okay.

1658
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,360
They've broken the news, right?

1659
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,360
What's going on?

1660
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,360
Whoa, there's like a lot of new information on this page.

1661
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,360
Home.

1662
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,360
What's new on it?

1663
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:19,360
Wait, did I not just...

1664
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
There's nothing new on this.

1665
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,360
I'm being trolled.

1666
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,360
Oh, these are students.

1667
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,360
Did I need to interact with them?

1668
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,360
Because I said I needed to get students.

1669
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,360
I bet he stopped leading the group and one of his radicals took over.

1670
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,360
I am leaving that too.

1671
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Why can I not interact with them?

1672
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,360
Maybe I interact with the later stage.

1673
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,360
Attendee list.

1674
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,360
Okay.

1675
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,360
I don't know where you found that.

1676
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
Summer?

1677
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,360
Wait, where's his class?

1678
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,360
I'm freaking to say I'm actually going to have to use my head.

1679
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,360
Hold on.

1680
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Hold on.

1681
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,360
Right.

1682
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,360
What was his class again?

1683
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,360
Media Ethics.

1684
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,360
Okay.

1685
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,360
Okay, take me to the list.

1686
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,360
Winter.

1687
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,360
Media.

1688
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,360
And then what's his name again?

1689
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,360
Big...

1690
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,360
Big Gold Felt.

1691
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,360
I would be terrible at this job.

1692
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
I already forget the names.

1693
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,360
Right.

1694
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,360
I think you're already retired at this point, so you don't count.

1695
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
Okay.

1696
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
So then go Previous.

1697
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,360
Then go Summer.

1698
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,360
Then go Media.

1699
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,360
And then look for Gold Fells.

1700
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
Gold Fells.

1701
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,360
Abraham.

1702
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,360
Nothing's been highlighted.

1703
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,360
Oh.

1704
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,360
Juliet.

1705
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,360
Ooh.

1706
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,360
Juliet.

1707
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,360
We're seeing that name before, haven't we?

1708
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,360
Right.

1709
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,360
She was a friend of Miss Wargate.

1710
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,360
Now it appears that she's a student.

1711
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,360
I think that's enough to warrant a report.

1712
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,360
Give me a few minutes.

1713
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Alright, we have authorization to investigate her.

1714
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,360
Oh.

1715
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,360
Okay, we have a profile now.

1716
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,360
O'Donnell Harrison.

1717
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,360
What's that then, too?

1718
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,360
Joseph Lang is Cassandra's boyfriend and on the

1719
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Illumini list.

1720
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,360
Ooh, I didn't spot that.

1721
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,360
Harrison O'Donnell.

1722
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,360
Yes, we have seen that name as well.

1723
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,360
I'll report this right away.

1724
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,360
Yes, yes.

1725
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,360
We have been authorized to consider Harrison.

1726
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Oh, that was the gorilla guy.

1727
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,360
Now there's some more work for you.

1728
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Congrats.

1729
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,360
Okay.

1730
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,360
Harrison and Juliet, they must be students within

1731
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,360
Thought.

1732
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Well done.

1733
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Okay.

1734
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
Anyone else?

1735
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Nicholas Webb.

1736
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
Wheeler.

1737
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,360
William.

1738
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,360
Right.

1739
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,360
Oh, we've got their timelines.

1740
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,360
Okay.

1741
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,360
First profile picture.

1742
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,360
Next.

1743
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,360
Your job, which is a PR assistant at

1744
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,360
Rosen Tech.

1745
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
Your birthday is February,

1746
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,360
1992.

1747
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
God, we even have your location.

1748
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,360
This is too easy, bro.

1749
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,360
Okay.

1750
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,360
Fair view.

1751
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,360
We even got location.

1752
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,360
Interest, guitar singing, board games.

1753
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,360
It's not really necessary.

1754
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,360
I mean, I guess I'll just take it because it's a

1755
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,360
wee thing.

1756
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,360
It's not really that interesting.

1757
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,360
Ha, you can dance and I got the proof now.

1758
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,360
Oh, is that really me?

1759
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,360
I'm going to be careful around you apparently.

1760
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
Great photo though.

1761
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,360
You took it.

1762
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,360
Nice try, Jules.

1763
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
A magician never reveals her trick.

1764
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,360
Anyway, thanks for a great time.

1765
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,360
I must admit, it felt kind of good to go out for once.

1766
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,360
Not that I plan on doing it again any time soon.

1767
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,360
Well, every time I ask you out, you still go out that busy

1768
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,360
and then you fall for freaking muffins.

1769
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Wait, did he just call the blue here when a muffin?

1770
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,360
Sorry, Adam.

1771
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
Maybe you need to spy on me somewhere.

1772
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Oh, okay.

1773
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
That was rather random.

1774
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
I've got to go walk the dog.

1775
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
Okay.

1776
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,360
Where's my collar?

1777
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,360
Put on me.

1778
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,360
Sorry, that was really cringe.

1779
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,360
Even I made myself grimace there.

1780
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,360
I was like, ooh, steady on.

1781
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,360
I'm bored to death.

1782
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,360
I'm making cupcakes.

1783
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,360
That girl next door.

1784
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
You know, I'm not so keen on going out late.

1785
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
Plus, I don't dance.

1786
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,360
Okay, no.

1787
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,360
All right, all right.

1788
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,360
You're going to be there tortured by my girlfriend.

1789
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,360
No.

1790
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
Oh, friend, engaged in torture.

1791
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,360
No.

1792
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,360
No.

1793
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Don't be silly.

1794
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360
The pet play allegations.

1795
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
Wait.

1796
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Someone said all of us are in on that.

1797
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,360
And I'm like, is Azura in on that?

1798
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,360
I didn't think Azura had anything to do with pet play.

1799
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,360
Ooh, I actually needed to ask you.

1800
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,360
I was going to order a collar and a bowl,

1801
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,360
but I don't know if I put wreathling on it,

1802
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,360
like your name on it.

1803
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,360
I put wreathling on that and then it's like

1804
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,360
I'm property of wreathling.

1805
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,360
Or do I need to put my name on it?

1806
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,360
I don't know how it works.

1807
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,360
Put wreathling on the bowl.

1808
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,360
Okay.

1809
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,360
Okay, so I put your name on it

1810
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,360
because you own me.

1811
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,360
Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

1812
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,360
Happy birthday, honey.

1813
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
So glad to have you back.

1814
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,360
We are the Kerrytons.

1815
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,360
Welcome to our website.

1816
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,360
Ooh, look at all these people.

1817
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
Oh, she's having a good time.

1818
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,360
Sushi.

1819
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,360
Oh, I'm hungry now.

1820
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,360
Whoa.

1821
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,360
Whoa, she got more of her thing there.

1822
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Yeah, because you're not dumb enough to do the opposite.

1823
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
Azura would be the owner in anything.

1824
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,360
Put ink jar on it.

1825
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,360
Okay, I'll order my little doggy bowl

1826
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,360
and my collar.

1827
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,360
Her favorite color is red.

1828
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,360
She likes playing a guitar

1829
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,360
to kill a mockingbird.

1830
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,360
I've still not read the other one yet.

1831
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,360
Since the nestling of the family

1832
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,360
showed up a little bit, the parents,

1833
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,360
John and...

1834
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,360
Okay, so we have father and mother.

1835
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Decided that they would end

1836
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,360
the strictness of naming pattern her sister.

1837
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,360
Juliet played guitar.

1838
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,360
Yeah, we get it.

1839
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,360
She decided to enter band career

1840
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,360
once she was single again.

1841
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,360
There's a conf...

1842
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,360
And focus on her university studies.

1843
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,360
So we have undeniable proof

1844
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,360
that she was in the class of that guy.

1845
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,360
We just need to find this conflicting date.

1846
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,360
And we'll find this part of it.

1847
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,360
I feel like you don't want us wearing tinfoil

1848
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,360
considering your plot.

1849
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,360
Red might be important

1850
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,360
if the letter is written in a certain color.

1851
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,360
What's she doing?

1852
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,360
Nobody...

1853
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,360
Nobody took notice.

1854
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,360
Nobody cares, nobody.

1855
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,360
What did Harry do this time?

1856
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,360
Ooh, she's dating Harry.

1857
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,360
Even though Cassandra and I

1858
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
just got to know each other as a protest,

1859
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,360
she stood up for me.

1860
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,360
Okay, so we have...

1861
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,360
We have proof that they also met as well.

1862
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,360
This woman is a hero and not a terrorist.

1863
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,360
Rick Denton?

1864
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,360
How come you care so much about politics now?

1865
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,360
This doesn't sound like the Juliet.

1866
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,360
I know.

1867
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,360
You wouldn't even accept

1868
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,360
the Juliet being class representative.

1869
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,360
How come you care so much about politics?

1870
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,360
And go for it.

1871
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,360
Sometimes people change their minds.

1872
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
First Miss Watergate and now hers.

1873
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
There's some sort of brainwashing going on.

1874
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,360
I understand.

1875
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
Strongly.

1876
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
The high table.

1877
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,360
That's not funny.

1878
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,360
Ooh, this guy's a bit more smart

1879
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,360
with his information.

1880
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Harrison, we've got a picture of him.

1881
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,360
He says Media Punk, though.

1882
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,360
Sure.

1883
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,360
We'll put that as your occupation

1884
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
for now.

1885
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,360
Media Punk.

1886
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360
Media Punk.

1887
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,360
What does that even mean?

1888
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,360
This is being deleted.

1889
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,360
Deleted multiple posts.

1890
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Ooh.

1891
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
Ooh.

1892
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,360
Do we have something to hide,

1893
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,360
Mr. O'Donnell?

1894
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Always hiding everything.

1895
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Ooh.

1896
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,360
You got this couple rock the show

1897
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,360
as it will rock the rest

1898
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,360
of the goddamn nation.

1899
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
Well, you've posted proof

1900
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,360
that you were with the other girl.

1901
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Juliet is a, yeah.

1902
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,360
Our two student members of Thought

1903
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
are a couple, interesting.

1904
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,360
Mike, why didn't you go and ask Juliet

1905
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
out right away, huh?

1906
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,360
No need for hiding anything.

1907
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
No need for hiding anything.

1908
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
I can provide a nose correction

1909
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,360
just for you to make you look like a...

1910
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Just...

1911
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
You want that?

1912
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
No, then Ethel.

1913
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
If you got it flunked,

1914
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
oh, so he gave a compliment

1915
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,360
and he's coming in region.

1916
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,360
Easily jealous.

1917
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,360
I mean, that's not really

1918
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
gonna help find the bomba.

1919
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
There we have the connection.

1920
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,360
Connection.

1921
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,360
Yeah.

1922
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,360
Okay, I don't really think it's

1923
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,360
necessary to put in, like,

1924
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,360
the smaller details like that.

1925
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
Harrison likes to target

1926
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
the haunted house with the cash

1927
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
instead of the clash.

1928
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,360
The national beholder.

1929
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,360
We hold the ThunderDome.

1930
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,360
Okay, welcome.

1931
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,360
Rosin Technologies.

1932
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,360
What are you?

1933
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,360
A Rosin is the family.

1934
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
Oh, we've got a listen.

1935
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,360
Sorry, we've got a listen.

1936
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Sorry.

1937
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,360
Oh, she got access to her phone.

1938
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
What happened yesterday?

1939
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,360
You got yoinked.

1940
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,360
Juliet, this is

1941
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,360
Yosef on Cassandra's account.

1942
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360
Oh, my God, what?

1943
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,360
Wait,

1944
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,360
did I have a profile on Yosef?

1945
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,360
I must have.

1946
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
This is the correct account.

1947
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:15,360
It's disabled.

1948
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,360
Oh, right.

1949
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
I can only do it on her.

1950
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
Sorry, I didn't.

1951
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
I didn't drop it.

1952
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,360
Not too uncommon in a relationship.

1953
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Oh, sorry.

1954
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Hi.

1955
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
Didn't know you had access to her.

1956
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Nice to talk to you too, Juliet.

1957
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
Have you seen Cassandra since yesterday?

1958
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
Heard from her.

1959
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,360
I spoke to her last night via chat.

1960
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,360
She seemed quite upset

1961
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,360
about the whole plaza thing.

1962
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
And something else

1963
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
she wouldn't talk about,

1964
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
then there was something at her door.

1965
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,360
Someone at her door.

1966
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,360
So she went to answer it

1967
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,360
and never came back.

1968
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,360
I assumed it was you.

1969
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,360
We were supposed to meet for dinner

1970
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,360
but I had an unexpected meeting.

1971
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,360
She wasn't exactly happy

1972
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,360
about the change of plans.

1973
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,360
She quit the chat.

1974
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,360
And that was it.

1975
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,360
I haven't heard from her since.

1976
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,360
In that case,

1977
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,360
I think she's probably home

1978
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,360
stewing away.

1979
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,360
Well, I just tried that.

1980
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,360
She gave me the keyster a flat

1981
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,360
two months ago,

1982
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,360
but no Cassie,

1983
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,360
also her PC was still on.

1984
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,360
Hmm, I guess.

1985
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,360
Calling her didn't work.

1986
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,360
No, I tried.

1987
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,360
Damn, I hate myself right now.

1988
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,360
Did you set your number to private?

1989
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,360
Otherwise, she's probably

1990
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,360
just avoiding you.

1991
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,360
Private is my default

1992
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,360
after all I am a lawyer.

1993
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,360
No, Cassandra's not a lawyer.

1994
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
Oh, the fuck,

1995
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,360
ignore that.

1996
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,360
Cassandra's not a lawyer.

1997
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,360
Must be meticulous as possible.

1998
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,360
We will get to the bottom of this.

1999
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,360
When she's mad,

2000
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,360
she usually goes to wonders

2001
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,360
around the city.

2002
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,360
She'll be back in no time.

2003
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,360
Yeah, she does get

2004
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,360
about fiery at times.

2005
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Fireball.

2006
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,360
That doesn't really work

2007
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,360
like wild card.

2008
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
There's the refland

2009
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,360
that's been put in wild card.

2010
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,360
In my marshmallow.

2011
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,360
And I'm like,

2012
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,360
okay, that's actually,

2013
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,360
wait a minute,

2014
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,360
do you think this guy's

2015
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,360
one on her account?

2016
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,360
The lawyer's on her account.

2017
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Are you trolling me?

2018
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,360
Are you messing me up on purpose?

2019
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,360
Oh, I doubt that somehow.

2020
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,360
Oh, sorry.

2021
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,360
See, this is why I want to,

2022
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,360
I feel like you know

2023
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,360
are better than I do.

2024
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,360
And I'm the boyfriend.

2025
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,360
Oh, I doubt that.

2026
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,360
I mean, you two were

2027
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,360
at the plaza together.

2028
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,360
And so I thought maybe

2029
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,360
you'd know other places

2030
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,360
that could be important to her.

2031
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,360
I'm sorry, freedom plaza

2032
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,360
was organized by thought.

2033
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,360
Yeah, but Harrison

2034
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,360
did all the planning.

2035
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
What's the conflict?

2036
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,360
I must know.

2037
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,360
You must let me know

2038
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,360
the conflict.

2039
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,360
I must find the conflict.

2040
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Harrison did the planning,

2041
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,360
apparently,

2042
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,360
as our little gorilla's

2043
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,360
listener wild card is.

2044
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,360
Thank you.

2045
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Anyway, session closed.

2046
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,360
Right.

2047
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,360
So we need to find the conflict.

2048
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,360
The Ten Commandments.

2049
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,360
Okay.

2050
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,360
I was like,

2051
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,360
Serion, what's going on here?

2052
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,360
Oh, we've got a phone number.

2053
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,360
Oh, Julie.

2054
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,360
Gate card.

2055
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,360
Well, good work.

2056
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,360
The listener will also track

2057
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,360
incoming, outgoing telephone

2058
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,360
calls of numbers you've added.

2059
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,360
It's not really that farfetched,

2060
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,360
is it?

2061
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,360
Oh.

2062
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Did we get to hear voices?

2063
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,360
Oh, no.

2064
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,360
Welcome to Brusenthek.

2065
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,360
This is the PR assistant, Juliet.

2066
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,360
How can I be a servant?

2067
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,360
Hello, this is Esther.

2068
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
You sound so official at work.

2069
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,360
Oh, hi, Mom.

2070
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,360
What's up?

2071
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,360
How's that going in?

2072
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,360
The Harrison character's looking

2073
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,360
sus as anything.

2074
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,360
I have to agree.

2075
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,360
I am going home for it lives

2076
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,360
with her parents.

2077
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,360
Okay.

2078
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,360
So when we take her down,

2079
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,360
we need to remember the parents

2080
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
when actually I'm heading out

2081
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
with some friends.

2082
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,360
Now let's find her parents address.

2083
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
She plans on going abroad.

2084
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,360
Sure, you can make plans

2085
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,360
go for it.

2086
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Now I'm back.

2087
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,360
How's the case going?

2088
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,360
Ah, Juliet is apparently broken up

2089
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:12,360
with the guy that planned it.

2090
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,360
Honey, please, you won't have much

2091
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
freedom left if you're passed away.

2092
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
Mom, I won't die.

2093
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
How can you be so sure of that?

2094
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
I could just as easily be hit by a car

2095
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,360
on the way home.

2096
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Don't say that.

2097
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,360
Just think this ridiculous grip

2098
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,360
I've gotten you into nothing but trouble.

2099
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
Alright.

2100
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,360
Sheesh.

2101
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,360
Thank you, honey.

2102
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,360
Mom, I'm sorry.

2103
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
But I really have to go.

2104
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,360
I don't want to be fired by my boss,

2105
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,360
Victor Rothen.

2106
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,360
I have to go.

2107
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,360
I'm sorry.

2108
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,360
Love you.

2109
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,360
Bye-bye.

2110
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,360
Curious, curious.

2111
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,360
Okay.

2112
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,360
So we have a boss, which is fine.

2113
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,360
We're allowed to have bosses.

2114
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,360
Huh?

2115
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,360
Wait, what the actual...

2116
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,360
The moment you open the dock,

2117
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,360
well, this is...

2118
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,360
Code Injection was detected in Orwell.

2119
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,360
We've had 47 attack warnings

2120
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,360
and still counting what is on that site.

2121
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Okay, okay.

2122
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
Let's get off it.

2123
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,360
So we don't get hacked.

2124
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,360
We got malware.

2125
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,360
Band, we are track.

2126
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,360
We are the track you are ashamed of

2127
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,360
in your fine-tuned playlist.

2128
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,360
Oh, okay, that's funny.

2129
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,360
Okay, hold on.

2130
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,360
We're getting somewhere with this guy.

2131
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,360
He cannot run away from us.

2132
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,360
His name is Hancock.

2133
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,360
The cogs are turning in my head.

2134
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,360
If I had enough sleep,

2135
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,360
I already would have said something wildly inappropriate.

2136
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:45,360
Oh, that's quite the ego we've got there, haven't we?

2137
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,360
Here's a wee photo of ya.

2138
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
Upload.

2139
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,360
Yeah.

2140
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,360
That one looks more complimentary.

2141
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,360
Warmer members.

2142
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,360
Juliet.

2143
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,360
Wrong profile.

2144
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,360
But that's okay,

2145
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,360
because we have Juliet.

2146
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,360
Mummy downloaded the popcorn.

2147
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,360
They got me.

2148
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,360
See, that's what happens if you don't have a pie hole.

2149
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,360
Wait, that's just that picture flipped.

2150
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,360
The other way.

2151
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,360
No.

2152
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,360
Right, okay.

2153
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,360
Let's do the professional one.

2154
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,360
Nah, okay.

2155
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,360
No.

2156
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,360
Dude, the flipped one.

2157
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,360
Sorry.

2158
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,360
I know it doesn't even matter,

2159
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,360
but I didn't find it.

2160
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,360
Right, gigs.

2161
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,360
Where are they playing?

2162
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,360
I want to see them.

2163
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,360
The target's featuring tearing down his cancel.

2164
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,360
He decided to quit.

2165
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,360
A friend of mine claims he heard that he quit,

2166
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,360
but no official statements be given out.

2167
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,360
A whole hearted thumbs down.

2168
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,360
Oh, boo, thumbs down, boo.

2169
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,360
Fucking thumbs down.

2170
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,360
Okay, I'm not going to report that,

2171
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,360
because that was a claim.

2172
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,360
The cell.

2173
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,360
We'll definitely come to Freedom Plot.

2174
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,360
I just have to get to know Juliet,

2175
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,360
especially since she's the one organizing.

2176
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:11,360
Well, so Cassandra claims that Juliet did it,

2177
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,360
but I'm going to be honest,

2178
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,360
Juliet isn't striking me.

2179
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,360
We'll definitely come.

2180
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,360
I have to go because Juliet is doing a show conflict.

2181
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:29,360
And so I thought maybe no other places should be important to her.

2182
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
I was organized by thought,

2183
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:40,360
yeah, but Harrison did all the planning.

2184
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,360
I want to say Harrison did it.

2185
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,360
Yeah, because she doesn't have a clue where else she might be.

2186
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
I'm going to say Harrison did it.

2187
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,360
I might regret this, but I don't know.

2188
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,360
From the two conflicts,

2189
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,360
it kind of seems like she's just tagging along with him.

2190
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,360
He planned the protest that went completely awry.

2191
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,360
He doesn't sound like,

2192
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,360
doesn't sound like a good plan into me.

2193
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,360
I bet you were going to say Hancock up at my house.

2194
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,360
No, I couldn't come up with the funny enough joke.

2195
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,360
Or maybe it didn't go awry at all.

2196
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,360
Maybe it went down exactly as he had in mind.

2197
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,360
We'll have done it now.

2198
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,360
That Freedom Plaza demonstration was one of thought's protest,

2199
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,360
not in surprise.

2200
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,360
One down, two more locations to go.

2201
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,360
Oh, what have we got?

2202
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,360
No, not another phone call.

2203
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,360
Oh, they're talking to each other.

2204
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
Ring ring, hello.

2205
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,360
You've got a Donald.

2206
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,360
Harrison, it's me.

2207
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, look who it is.

2208
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,360
I know this moment is coming to you.

2209
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,360
But you've caught me by surprise.

2210
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,360
I've already got a handle on it.

2211
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,360
Shh, Juliet.

2212
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Ever since we first made out on that night,

2213
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,360
I knew it was...

2214
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,360
Oh, no, he's a stalker.

2215
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,360
Will you please spare me?

2216
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,360
I didn't believe you, but it really is you.

2217
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,360
Uh, okay.

2218
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,360
Steligan again.

2219
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,360
The university needs to play a major part.

2220
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,360
And what do I owe the beautiful pleasure of your voice?

2221
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,360
You miss me.

2222
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,360
So this is why you did it, to make me call you back again?

2223
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,360
The heck are you talking about?

2224
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,360
Oh, don't play dumb, great administrator.

2225
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,360
I'm talking about the thought page.

2226
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,360
You're so generously volunteered to maintain.

2227
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
Wait, give me a sec.

2228
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,360
What the...

2229
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,360
You're messing around with me, Jules.

2230
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:32,360
Are you seriously trying to say this wasn't your doing?

2231
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,360
Rather eff would I disgrace thought.

2232
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,360
Maybe because the same reason you bailed out of thought all of a sudden.

2233
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,360
Wait, why would you plan it and then bail?

2234
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,360
Thought you didn't...

2235
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,360
Oh, so...

2236
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,360
Oh, is that so?

2237
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,360
We need to keep observing.

2238
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,360
Okay, hold on.

2239
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,360
I can't read that fast.

2240
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,360
Thought you didn't do...

2241
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,360
Since Abe disappeared.

2242
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,360
Disappeared causing thought to come inactive.

2243
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,360
Where does that...

2244
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
Who does that go?

2245
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,360
On her?

2246
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,360
Wrong, but wait, what?

2247
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,360
Oh, on Abraham.

2248
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,360
Sorry, on Abraham.

2249
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,360
Okay, so Abe disappeared.

2250
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,360
Perfect voice acting, I'm so sorry.

2251
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,360
Abraham Goh feels disappeared causing the group to be out.

2252
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,360
They're no longer active?

2253
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,360
Well, seems like someone still is.

2254
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,360
To bail on the two of us.

2255
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,360
Former relationship ended...

2256
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,360
Why is that changing?

2257
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,360
Former relationship.

2258
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,360
Wrong profile.

2259
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,360
Sorry.

2260
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Okay, so I'll update for both of them.

2261
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,360
Okay.

2262
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,360
Trouble in paradise.

2263
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,360
Maybe then because you disgraced...

2264
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,360
Hit articles on the blog.

2265
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,360
Oh...

2266
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,360
Except for Cassandra's.

2267
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,360
How's that?

2268
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,360
Curious, need to add that.

2269
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,360
So he hit them on purpose except...

2270
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,360
First the timeline, now the blog.

2271
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,360
You have a lot to hide.

2272
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,360
Hmm.

2273
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,360
Abraham archived the first ones because they didn't want us to know.

2274
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,360
Hit first articles and thought from other members in the public.

2275
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,360
None of us could ever actually, I merely did the same with the rest

2276
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,360
because that would also be in Abe's interest and Cass

2277
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:21,360
wanted to show her article around.

2278
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,360
What a strange development.

2279
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,360
Oh, that guy that archived.

2280
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,360
This gets more confusing by the minute.

2281
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,360
Why don't you, why do you hide something on a group blog

2282
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,360
from its own members?

2283
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,360
A hidden agenda?

2284
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:40,360
Oh please, I know you deleted all of your rebellious posts

2285
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,360
to secure your cosy job and writing

2286
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:49,360
that ridiculous opinion column for the TNB.

2287
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,360
Wait, he writes...

2288
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:59,360
He writes for the very thing he swore to destroy?

2289
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,360
Hey, I read this one quite...

2290
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,360
It wasn't at all where it was this guy.

2291
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,360
Probably the thing don't know it.

2292
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,360
You know, it's funny you dare speak of disgraces

2293
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,360
when Rossin is the government's personal beat

2294
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,360
because you didn't know, almost makes you the same.

2295
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,360
So you really didn't hack then?

2296
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,360
I didn't have a freaking clue.

2297
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,360
Can you revert the changes?

2298
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,360
You bet.

2299
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,360
I'll even hunt down that son of a...

2300
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,360
Just revert it, okay?

2301
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,360
I don't care who did it.

2302
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,360
I just can't stand her memories being toyed around.

2303
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,360
Okay, okay, I'll be done in a minute, man.

2304
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,360
I never could say no to you.

2305
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,360
Oh, he's like a little puppy dog.

2306
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,360
I will break you like that.

2307
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:41,360
Okay, right.

2308
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,360
Wait, so why is this red?

2309
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,360
Or is it just red because it's new?

2310
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,360
Probably just because it's new.

2311
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,360
What's the albums?

2312
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,360
I had a punk friend that he is now a real corporal

2313
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,360
working for a bank.

2314
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,360
I cry every time, you know.

2315
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,360
Will we listen to the music?

2316
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,360
Why is it only in my left ear?

2317
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,360
Advertisement for the poor.

2318
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,360
All right, I predict all right.

2319
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:18,360
Oh, well, we've got an email from him.

2320
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,360
That was literally only in my left ear.

2321
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,360
I'm like, oh, thank you for donating me.

2322
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,360
Excellent.

2323
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,360
We will now have access to any emails coming in and out.

2324
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,360
Oh, what's going on?

2325
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,360
I see you.

2326
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,360
Knock, knock, Harrison seems I caught your pants down

2327
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,360
on that little page of yours.

2328
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,360
Confused, that's fine.

2329
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,360
You don't know me, and I like to keep it that way.

2330
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,360
But I know a lot about you, media punk.

2331
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,360
If I knew...

2332
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,360
Oh, so he got scared.

2333
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,360
If you knew what I know about...

2334
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,360
What?

2335
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,360
If you knew what I know,

2336
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:52,360
what you know about what this little group of yours did,

2337
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:56,360
you would find it just as hard to ignore

2338
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,360
that those bomba might be carrying your name tag,

2339
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,360
get what I'm talking about right.

2340
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,360
So the Righteous Hacker initiate

2341
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,360
will expose all information I got on you.

2342
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,360
Might interest the cops.

2343
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,360
I've no love for the government, but I'll do what I must.

2344
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,360
So give me one good reason not to do it.

2345
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:20,360
He got blackmailed by an anonymous person.

2346
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,360
From initiate.

2347
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,360
Oh, great.

2348
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,360
Now there is a hacker involved in all this

2349
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,360
because the situation wasn't bad enough already.

2350
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,360
I wonder what this is about.

2351
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Let's find out.

2352
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,360
Order confirmation.

2353
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,360
Shoot, Angela?

2354
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,360
Your bank account.

2355
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,360
Okay, give me them bank account numbers.

2356
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,360
Those are mine.

2357
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,360
Those are not yours.

2358
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,360
I don't know if we need a friggin' Angela.

2359
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,360
Harrison sent...

2360
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,360
No one cares about an Angela.

2361
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,360
I see you.

2362
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,360
Hey, wise ass.

2363
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,360
This is the most pathetic attempt I've seen in a long time.

2364
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,360
You want a goddamn reason?

2365
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,360
I'll give you.

2366
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,360
You hacked my site.

2367
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,360
My website.

2368
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Last I checked.

2369
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,360
That's illegal.

2370
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,360
Something about glasshouse and stones.

2371
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:04,360
I don't get what you want to have found out.

2372
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,360
Oh, my God.

2373
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,360
Am I reading this?

2374
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,360
I don't get what you want to have found out about me.

2375
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,360
True.

2376
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,360
Our protest didn't go as planned,

2377
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,360
but since you claim to know so much about me,

2378
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,360
you shouldn't know.

2379
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,360
That was hardly what I wanted was all in my blog.

2380
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,360
In the blog, I mean.

2381
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,360
It was getting hard to read.

2382
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,360
It's not going well.

2383
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,360
Not worried about the bomba.

2384
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,360
Only grabbing attention.

2385
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,360
Bet you'll be found out, huh?

2386
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,360
With your mad skills.

2387
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,360
Hey, good boy.

2388
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,360
I'll throw you a breadcrumbs so you don't...

2389
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,360
Mine.

2390
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,360
Your dick.

2391
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,360
I'm the wrong person to leave my page alone,

2392
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,360
roll it back, and then don't there touch it.

2393
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,360
Okay, okay, okay.

2394
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,360
Sorry.

2395
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,360
Shy.

2396
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,360
Well, back off.

2397
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,360
Right, why are the gigs highlighted?

2398
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,360
So he quit the band,

2399
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,360
and it's not conflicting,

2400
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,360
so I'll just put he quit the band.

2401
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,360
Internet vigilante easy.

2402
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,360
The national opinion.

2403
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,360
It really is by him.

2404
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,360
There's three conflicting data chunks.

2405
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,360
Oh, God.

2406
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,360
Who knows?

2407
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,360
Maybe the next one will go in the middle.

2408
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,360
Predicted assault at a national museum.

2409
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,360
I mean, we'll put that down

2410
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,360
if he's predicting stuff.

2411
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,360
He's been to the last two.

2412
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,360
Okay.

2413
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,360
Yes, the article.

2414
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,360
That was strange indeed.

2415
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,360
And with the bomba.

2416
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,360
Jeez, Louise.

2417
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,360
Juliet's timeline.

2418
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,360
What's going on with you, Juliet?

2419
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,360
I even organized...

2420
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,360
You organized the peaceful protest on campus.

2421
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,360
Right.

2422
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,360
So Juliet did the campus organization.

2423
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,360
Apparently there's information.

2424
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,360
A house.

2425
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,360
We're getting somewhere with you, Juliet.

2426
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,360
She's somewhere from here.

2427
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,360
The audio is a bit loud.

2428
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,360
Like in-game audio or me.

2429
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:12,360
I assume in-game audio got her address.

2430
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360
We got her ass.

2431
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,360
I assume there's like nothing.

2432
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,360
These are all like in-game audio.

2433
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,360
I put it down by two decibels.

2434
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,360
I didn't know.

2435
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,360
I assume the red means there's something hidden on it

2436
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,360
that I'm supposed to be looking at.

2437
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,360
Is there more?

2438
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,360
Oh, there's a new picture of them.

2439
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,360
You're loud as fuck.

2440
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,360
Oh, shit.

2441
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,360
I'm actually...

2442
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,360
You guys just tolerating this the entire time?

2443
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,360
No, you're fine.

2444
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,360
Oh, okay.

2445
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,360
Comments.

2446
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,360
I love you.

2447
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,360
You're so amazing.

2448
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,360
My new favorite band.

2449
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,360
Greatest band of the nation.

2450
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,360
Except for the proclaimers.

2451
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,360
And stuff you did.

2452
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,360
That was really good.

2453
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,360
Please make yourself louder.

2454
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,360
Wait, are you trolling?

2455
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,360
You're trolling.

2456
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,360
Okay, so...

2457
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,360
We'll rinse the website.

2458
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,360
Okay, we've got a new one.

2459
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,360
Welcome to FBTN-

2460
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,360
Wait, we can just straight up go into his bank?

2461
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,360
I mean, he's got health insurance?

2462
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,360
And he's...

2463
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,360
A guy his age planning on doing something dangerous.

2464
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,360
And then he needs medicine.

2465
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,360
Comments are literally us for real.

2466
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,360
That comment...

2467
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,360
Whoa, what are you...

2468
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,360
Oh, you got...

2469
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,360
That...

2470
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,360
See, that's an incentive to...

2471
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,360
Do stuff against your actual personal beliefs.

2472
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,360
If you're getting that kind of money for doing an article.

2473
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,360
There's no way that's how much money you get for an article.

2474
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,360
Must be the payment for writing the column.

2475
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,360
Yeah, there's no way.

2476
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,360
Can we delete this?

2477
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,360
Oh my god, delete it please.

2478
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,360
Delete it before I get booted out of his bank, please.

2479
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,360
Delete it, delete it.

2480
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,360
Okay, the...

2481
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,360
Hancock's writing on the wall.

2482
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,360
Is this his blog?

2483
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,360
What is?

2484
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,360
What?

2485
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,360
After years,

2486
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,360
What?

2487
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,360
After years, my plan has taken shape.

2488
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,360
It even has name thought.

2489
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:50,360
Finally, counterpart to the radical regime of totalitarian surveillance.

2490
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,360
And I'm glad to have a capable companion in this.

2491
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,360
One who came up with the best idea for a demo, whatever.

2492
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,360
I'm not gonna tell you this as far as...

2493
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,360
I can only urge you to join us in our aim

2494
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,360
to unleash this pitiful, pathetic wannabe democracy

2495
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,360
of a country from its shackles.

2496
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,360
From freedom is not free in a place

2497
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,360
where every move is observed and analyzed.

2498
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,360
Wait, so he made it?

2499
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,360
Run around.

2500
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,360
I already got a nice plan on.

2501
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,360
As soon as I get myself a handful of like-minded people,

2502
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:25,360
we're gonna occupy the university.

2503
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,360
I bet we could scare those cardigan-wearing conformists

2504
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,360
a great deal by showing our ugly faces.

2505
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,360
Oh, how I'd love to see them running.

2506
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,360
I already live in a trailer.

2507
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,360
There we go.

2508
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,360
Can play city skylings one day.

2509
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,360
You can make a reefling city.

2510
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,360
Oh, can I?

2511
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,360
Oh, come on.

2512
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,360
Can you please get any more stereotypical antisocial?

2513
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,360
So what's the conflict?

2514
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,360
Plan to occupy the university.

2515
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,360
Planned a protest.

2516
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,360
So he's, he, as soon as I get myself like,

2517
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,360
we're gonna occupy.

2518
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,360
But she said she planned it.

2519
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,360
I think he's the mastermind behind it.

2520
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,360
So we'll do occupy instead of protest.

2521
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,360
It was an occupy he originally wanted to do.

2522
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,360
Very well.

2523
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,360
It is apparent, extreme, exactly as we suspected,

2524
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,360
but we still have no idea about the third location.

2525
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,360
You need to be diligent now.

2526
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,360
Lives may be hanging in the balance.

2527
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,360
In the worst case,

2528
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,360
that we cannot determine the location on time.

2529
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,360
Well, I might have to conduct an interrogation

2530
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,360
with Miss Watergate.

2531
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,360
I want to avoid it though, she's behaving

2532
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,360
pretty defiantly, I've been told.

2533
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,360
Looking at what you found so far,

2534
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,360
I think I might have enough information

2535
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,360
to put some pressure on her.

2536
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,360
No, no, no, I'm not done reading the book yet.

2537
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,360
Stop.

2538
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,360
Knock, knock.

2539
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
The thoughts are free once again.

2540
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,360
We are not done yet, you and me.

2541
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,360
But first, on, I must turn to another.

2542
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,360
I can't even find the word to him.

2543
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,360
Stupid, rejects government's proposition.

2544
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,360
And then the confliction is...

2545
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,360
No, so he doesn't actually support it.

2546
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,360
He got a fat paycheck,

2547
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,360
so whatever the other confliction is.

2548
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,360
Outskirts.

2549
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,360
Camping?

2550
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,360
He lives in a camping ground.

2551
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,360
Okay, we've got this location.

2552
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,360
Nothing wrong with cardigans,

2553
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,360
leave the cardigans alone.

2554
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,360
That's one ugly place,

2555
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
but I guess it's cheap.

2556
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,360
Okay, so I'm gonna wait.

2557
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,360
There are so many updates.

2558
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,360
Okay, user, fricking...

2559
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,360
What?

2560
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,360
Archived, archived.

2561
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,360
We can still archived.

2562
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,360
The website's back.

2563
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,360
Everything's archived.

2564
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,360
Mm-mm.

2565
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,360
Everything?

2566
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,360
Okay, would you need that?

2567
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,360
Entry 8.

2568
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,360
Just here?

2569
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,360
No, we've just got access to it again.

2570
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,360
Okay, we've just got access to it again.

2571
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,360
That's hot.

2572
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,360
Seems like...

2573
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,360
Ever family?

2574
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,360
There's something lurking on ever family.

2575
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,360
Whatever it is.

2576
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,360
What is it that's lurking?

2577
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,360
Okay, playing the guitar

2578
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,360
proves that she was definitely in the band.

2579
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,360
I'll allow it.

2580
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,360
Favorite color, red?

2581
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,360
Does this even have anything to do with anything?

2582
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,360
I feel like I'm just clogging up the system.

2583
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,360
Okay, I like jokes as much as the next person.

2584
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,360
But our favorite color, do you really think that is...?

2585
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,360
Okay, there is a bomb threat.

2586
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,360
Could you please focus on that?

2587
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

2588
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,360
I'm sorry.

2589
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,360
I'm sorry.

2590
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,360
I'm sorry.

2591
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,360
Okay, I got a little distracted.

2592
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,360
Okay, wall attacks.

2593
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,360
The important thing is here.

2594
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,360
Leave a message.

2595
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,360
The alien.

2596
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,360
I'm looking for people willing to join a thought.

2597
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,360
I can live it up.

2598
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,360
Oh.

2599
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,360
Wait.

2600
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,360
By pure coincidence,

2601
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,360
I stumbled on it.

2602
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,360
Frankly, you're thinking in your attitude

2603
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,360
to get people thinking

2604
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,360
is left an impression on me.

2605
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,360
So the professor

2606
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,360
messaged him.

2607
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,360
The professor didn't recruit them.

2608
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,360
Thank you for joining.

2609
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
I feel a little confused now.

2610
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,360
Is this thought a blog,

2611
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,360
an activist group,

2612
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,360
or a debate club,

2613
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,360
or all three?

2614
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,360
They're just really good at master debating.

2615
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,360
Okay.

2616
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,360
This is curious.

2617
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,360
I can't even find the words.

2618
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,360
Okay.

2619
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,360
We need to find that third debate club invitation.

2620
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,360
There is no way they put old memes in this.

2621
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,360
Are you joking?

2622
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,360
Favorite color, red.

2623
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,360
Red.

2624
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,360
Red wire.

2625
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,360
Bomba.

2626
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,360
Color red wire.

2627
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,360
Exactly.

2628
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,360
They put an old meme.

2629
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,360
Ain't nobody got time for that.

2630
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,360
Why is that donkey?

2631
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,360
Little donkey.

2632
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,360
Carry me.

2633
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,360
On the dust.

2634
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,360
So Nina, you will be very recruited.

2635
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,360
Nina.

2636
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,360
Nina.

2637
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,360
Nina, Nina, Nina.

2638
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,360
I don't know who Nina is.

2639
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,360
So there's another member

2640
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:57,360
we haven't even heard of.

2641
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,360
I would request clearance to make our target.

2642
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,360
We got the green light.

2643
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,360
They instantly give the green light.

2644
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:05,360
At concerned one, Nina.

2645
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,360
Oh, that was that comment on the blog.

2646
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,360
What a strange alias name.

2647
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,360
Ain't nobody got time for that.

2648
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,360
If someone's comment,

2649
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,360
no comment.

2650
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,360
No, there was a comment.

2651
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,360
There it is, concerned.

2652
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,360
No, we will carry into the streets of the nation,

2653
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,360
be transformed in the re-implanted back of their minds

2654
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,360
an invi-is-able idea that we shall always be free.

2655
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:41,360
Declare thought to be a revolutionary act of this group.

2656
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,360
Yes, I'm getting that vibe too.

2657
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,360
Donkey Girl for Gen 2.

2658
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,360
You guys are getting absolutely annihilated

2659
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,360
next week when we actually draw the concert.

2660
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,360
So an activist group after all

2661
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,360
and now we know who had the primary say in it.

2662
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,360
Any plans to restrict first?

2663
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,360
Oh!

2664
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,360
So what about holding a proclamation

2665
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,360
on a government building then?

2666
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,360
Sounds like a worthy first demo.

2667
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,360
A proclamation?

2668
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,360
We should go first storm in the malls.

2669
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,360
What?

2670
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,360
My friends,

2671
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,360
though I show your enthusiasm towards getting the people,

2672
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,360
it would be better to avoid

2673
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,360
as a place of demonstration.

2674
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,360
Ah, what pay, but you're probably right.

2675
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:37,360
So what about holding a proclamation on a government building?

2676
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,360
It was the Boston,

2677
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,360
although I know we want to gather more people to join,

2678
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,360
we should not discuss the matter.

2679
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,360
There are eyes that might be malicious.

2680
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,360
So it's a government building.

2681
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,360
He plans stuff, so it's him.

2682
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,360
The government, holy, that must be it.

2683
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,360
That's through the third bomba.

2684
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,360
But which one didn't say?

2685
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,360
That's it.

2686
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,360
Alright, if that's all we have,

2687
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:11,360
it's what we have to work with.

2688
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,360
So let's get the interrogation thing going

2689
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,360
before we run out of time.

2690
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,360
I'm actually located in the same facility

2691
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,360
where Miss Wargay has been detained.

2692
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,360
I will have her move to an interrogation room

2693
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,360
and walk across to cover my identity.

2694
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,360
I will connect to her via a wire.

2695
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,360
Let's just hope that you have provided,

2696
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:31,360
gives us enough leverage.

2697
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,360
I will open a connection for you to eavesdrop.

2698
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,360
After all, this is your case too.

2699
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,360
Plus we need all the possible info found.

2700
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,360
I'm not ready yet, hold on.

2701
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,360
You're like thrusting me into this.

2702
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,360
Hostile towards government?

2703
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,360
Rejects government.

2704
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,360
See, hostile?

2705
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,360
I think he rejects.

2706
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,360
I'm just going to put rejection.

2707
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,360
I have no idea.

2708
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,360
Anything else that would become a surprise?

2709
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,360
Oh my god.

2710
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,360
I'm not ready.

2711
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,360
Okay, what's going on?

2712
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,360
Right, we're listening to the interrogation.

2713
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,360
Stop saying stuff like this.

2714
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,360
Don't get hooked.

2715
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,360
Who is this?

2716
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,360
Why can't you just leave me alone?

2717
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,360
Miss Watergate?

2718
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,360
My name is Syme.

2719
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,360
Great, Symes, can you go-

2720
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,360
I already told the other guys everything over and over again.

2721
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,360
It wasn't me who hurt the officer.

2722
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,360
We have new evidence that states otherwise,

2723
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,360
which is why you are in custody.

2724
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,360
But that's not what this is about.

2725
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,360
We are investigating the bomber at Freedom Plaza.

2726
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,360
I just want to ask you some questions.

2727
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,360
Cooperate?

2728
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,360
Oh god, I cannot read that fast.

2729
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,360
Are you joking?

2730
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,360
You might reflect positive.

2731
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,360
Oh, and you want to frame me?

2732
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,360
I've been so busy.

2733
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:51,360
I was right here imprisoned while I did the bomber.

2734
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,360
We know you didn't trigger the bomber,

2735
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,360
maybe not even the one at Freedom Plaza.

2736
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,360
But we do know, however,

2737
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
you have been in close contact with a group called Thought.

2738
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,360
What?

2739
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,360
They have nothing to do with this.

2740
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,360
I want to talk to my lawyer right now.

2741
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,360
You mean that boyfriend of yours?

2742
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,360
Joseph Langlin.

2743
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,360
My boyfriend?

2744
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,360
How do you know that?

2745
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,360
We know a lot about you, Miss Watergate.

2746
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,360
I don't need to call him then.

2747
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,360
No shovel.

2748
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,360
Your defiance towards me is not advisable.

2749
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,360
What about your parents?

2750
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,360
Bruno and Alice?

2751
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,360
They've got a nice company, don't they?

2752
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,360
Association with a criminal case against their daughter.

2753
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,360
Yeah, again, could hurt them badly.

2754
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,360
Last time I was in custody,

2755
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,360
all they ever did about it was suggesting I'd leave my position.

2756
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:37,360
Does that give you the impression of a perfect family?

2757
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,360
Well, have it your way then.

2758
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:44,360
We have your confession in regards to that nasty incident with the police officer.

2759
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:46,360
You'll have to go through the whole process again.

2760
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:49,360
It's gonna drag on for a long time.

2761
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,360
And where did you get this supposed confession?

2762
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,360
I never did anything.

2763
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,360
Miss Carrington stated this in a conversation with you.

2764
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:00,360
Have you been spying on us, you dirty little government?

2765
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:04,360
Well, I hope you also noticed that she started this in defence.

2766
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,360
Indeed, we did know that.

2767
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,360
That doesn't.

2768
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,360
That does mean you have nothing on me.

2769
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,360
It seems my colleagues didn't tell you.

2770
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:15,360
You have been arrested as potentially dangerous, did they?

2771
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,360
Potentially dangerous.

2772
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,360
I like the sound of that.

2773
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:19,360
Me?

2774
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,360
Me so dangerous.

2775
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,360
This is not a joke, Miss Watergate.

2776
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,360
See, it's all in this profile here,

2777
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,360
in accordance with the safety bill people have assessed,

2778
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:31,360
as potentially dangerous may be held in custody for a very long time

2779
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,360
until they are deemed no longer a threat.

2780
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,360
BS, you can't just make something and flag me as dangerous

2781
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,360
just because it suits your case.

2782
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,360
It's an official investigation result

2783
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,360
and we can double that time span.

2784
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,360
You'll sit in here with the police record linkers.

2785
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,360
No, why?

2786
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,360
I hope you will link yourself and your cellmates,

2787
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:53,360
but cooperate and avoid this at once.

2788
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,360
Why are you doing this to me?

2789
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,360
Just answer my questions

2790
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,360
and I might be able to help.

2791
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,360
I don't know what you expect from me.

2792
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,360
I first went to the Plaza demo.

2793
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,360
I don't know much about their plans.

2794
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,360
We know that Mr. O'Donnell

2795
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,360
had plans to have a kind of proclamation

2796
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,360
on the roof of a government building.

2797
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,360
Do you know which one?

2798
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,360
Government building?

2799
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,360
I never heard of anything like that.

2800
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,360
I think Miss Watergate,

2801
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,360
they have had mentioned anything remotely like that.

2802
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,360
Damn it.

2803
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,360
I don't know.

2804
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,360
There is nothing.

2805
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,360
There has got to be something.

2806
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,360
Talk!

2807
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,360
No, there is never...

2808
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,360
I swear, I don't...

2809
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:35,360
This is it, Miss Watergate.

2810
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,360
This interrogation is over.

2811
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,360
I did not go planned at all, not at all.

2812
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,360
I wonder if we went wrong about this place.

2813
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,360
Oops.

2814
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,360
So what do we do now?

2815
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:48,360
We run out of time and options.

2816
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,360
Evacuate just by making an educated guess

2817
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,360
that would cause a PR disaster.

2818
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:57,360
We need ideas and fast, else...

2819
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,360
I'm sure we're too late.

2820
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,360
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2821
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,360
We could have prevented this.

2822
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,360
Was it the mall?

2823
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,360
If only...

2824
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,360
I don't know, shit.

2825
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,360
There's got to be some serious fallout.

2826
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,360
I'll do what I can to keep us in a job.

2827
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,360
I think I need fired if it was at the mall.

2828
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,360
We need to pull this group apart.

2829
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,360
Tomorrow we'll have a serious Nina.

2830
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,360
Until then, you're dismissed.

2831
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,360
Wait.

2832
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,360
Was it at the...

2833
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,360
Oops, sorry, wrong one.

2834
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,360
It was the mall!

2835
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,360
Wait, how is that supposed to pick either or?

2836
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,360
Was that supposed to know that he wasn't organizing stuff?

2837
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,360
It was the mall.

2838
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:38,360
So it was Nina.

2839
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,360
No way I got rolled.

2840
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,360
So the conflicting information?

2841
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,360
She didn't know Nina doesn't...

2842
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,360
Oh, she messed up the organized.

2843
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:03,360
Interesting.

2844
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,360
What did she do?

2845
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:07,360
It wasn't Nina.

2846
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,360
Rip hot topic, honestly.

2847
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,360
You will be missed.

2848
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,360
Oh, that's so frustrating.

2849
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,360
Okay, I understand.

2850
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,360
Anyone knows this game has multiple endings?

2851
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,360
It definitely has multiple endings

2852
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:23,360
because I never unlocked the correct ending.

2853
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,360
Everything looks fine.

2854
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,360
Are you sure?

2855
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,360
Yeah, sure.

2856
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,360
Whatever I've missed, I've missed.

2857
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,360
I got an achievement.

2858
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,360
Complete episode 2.

2859
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,360
He was...

2860
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:40,360
Okay, so...

2861
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:44,360
We picked up a lot of information.

2862
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,360
So we need Nina.

2863
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,360
Harrison's been cleared.

2864
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,360
Juliet wasn't even a suspect.

2865
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,360
Again, Abraham says,

2866
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,360
Oh, Nina?

2867
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,360
Unperson.

2868
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,360
Here we are again after having steered into the bus

2869
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:10,360
not unscathed but alive and still with a job.

2870
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,360
I was able to keep us in the business.

2871
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,360
My superiors don't want to give up on Orwell just yet.

2872
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,360
Needless to say, we cannot

2873
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,360
afford to repeat a failure like yesterday.

2874
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:22,360
The TMB is already starting to tear us apart, Lisa!

2875
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,360
This Nina character is a final member of thought

2876
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,360
and we don't have concrete info.

2877
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,360
Since Harrison's plan with the government building

2878
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,360
turned out to be a dead end,

2879
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,360
we need to get a clearer picture of the loose.

2880
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,360
Her stance towards law enforcement

2881
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,360
just gives us one more reason

2882
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,360
as you found out yesterday.

2883
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:41,360
Focus on Nina, but keep watching all the others too.

2884
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,360
Sorry, I kind of thought you wanted to go to my bedtime.

2885
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,360
My part.

2886
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,360
Hey, forgot to charge my phone last night.

2887
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,360
So yeah, I have to do it the old fashioned way.

2888
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,360
I really want to thank you for a nice evening.

2889
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,360
Only to be topped by that night.

2890
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,360
That's it.

2891
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,360
I was hoping you'd drop your...

2892
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,360
by CCC to come pick me up.

2893
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,360
The girl was yammering about...

2894
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,360
opposes the safety bill.

2895
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,360
Hi, Mark.

2896
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,360
Is she be about to come online?

2897
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,360
Why would anyone oppose the safety bill?

2898
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,360
We have the lowest crime rate in years or possibly ever.

2899
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,360
You and me, we have the job thanks to the bill.

2900
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,360
The only reason to not support is if you have a dirty, dirty past.

2901
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,360
But the situation is here as it is.

2902
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,360
It's like someone we should have a very close look at.

2903
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:38,360
We need to fill examination.

2904
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,360
First, a concrete background on who.

2905
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:42,360
Second, what motivators.

2906
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:47,360
And finally, where was she around the time of the bomba?

2907
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,360
Let's find out.

2908
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,360
Where are the headlines?

2909
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:52,360
Catastrophe strikes.

2910
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,360
One passed away.

2911
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,360
Then for doing a donut time.

2912
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,360
Mummy...

2913
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,360
Enough of the dirty past.

2914
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,360
Let's talk about my dirty future.

2915
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:12,360
Maybe really endangered by lawsuit against the rector.

2916
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,360
The surrounding.

2917
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:16,360
The national opinion.

2918
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,360
And last week, no.

2919
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,360
Predicted assaults only to sell his point to the column.

2920
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,360
Condemns the bomba.

2921
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,360
Predicts the bomba.

2922
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,360
Wait, so what is his stance of that?

2923
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:35,360
A strange way to sell one's point.

2924
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,360
It's still peculiarly mentioned bomba before anything happened, but well.

2925
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,360
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2926
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,360
Ah!

2927
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,360
So are we creating the scenario from the marrow?

2928
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,360
No! Broly legend.

2929
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,360
Thank you for the tip.

2930
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,360
If it's the marrow or my bad, no.

2931
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:55,360
Prosecure calls on people to take care of their own safety.

2932
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,360
Wait, is he completely not going punk anymore?

2933
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:00,360
And he's back to Wolf?

2934
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,360
I'm getting confused now.

2935
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:10,360
We cannot save everyone, but we're still a watchful eye on the nation.

2936
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:12,360
Is he completely...

2937
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,360
Hey kiddo, you're absolutely right.

2938
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:16,360
One could call that even a mind blown.

2939
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:18,360
But let's not stay at my place tonight.

2940
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,360
Okay.

2941
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,360
It's unfit for a lady.

2942
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,360
No lovers hidden there.

2943
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:26,360
I'm done with her because of...

2944
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,360
Okay.

2945
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,360
Okay, okay, okay.

2946
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,360
New girlfriend got it.

2947
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,360
Thank you sir.

2948
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,360
Anina, you mean anything?

2949
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,360
Oh, Juliet and Harrison, where'd you go?

2950
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,360
That's...

2951
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,360
That one's news to me.

2952
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,360
Guess it didn't matter.

2953
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,360
Now that's over.

2954
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:43,360
Oh, I thought it wasn't.

2955
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,360
Anything will set me off.

2956
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,360
Angry at birth.

2957
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,360
Get angry at birth.

2958
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,360
Angry at birth.

2959
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,360
She was my partner in crime a while ago.

2960
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,360
I think that's just a saying.

2961
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,360
Oh no, it's the only thing I can pick information from, I think.

2962
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,360
Making Gen 2 is supposed to be a private affair.

2963
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,360
Exactly.

2964
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,360
We'll be making it very soon together.

2965
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,360
Since then.

2966
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,360
Anything?

2967
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,360
The edited movie poster.

2968
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,360
Oh, go on then.

2969
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,360
A hundred gray shadows.

2970
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,360
I thought that was going to be a 50 shades of gray.

2971
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,360
50 shades of gray.

2972
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,360
A hundred gray shadows.

2973
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,360
Okay.

2974
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,360
Quit fooling around.

2975
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,360
War on indifference.

2976
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,360
Oh, this is done by Nina.

2977
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,360
Okay, Nina, you're going down.

2978
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,360
You wait for it.

2979
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,360
Just confess, get him.

2980
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:48,360
Right, let me just check.

2981
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,360
So, war on indifference.

2982
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:55,360
Indifference towards our own rights is the worst enemy than the government itself.

2983
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,360
What?

2984
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,360
Okay, so how...

2985
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,360
How you in particular incited the crowd to directly threaten the visitors.

2986
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,360
Intended to scare them.

2987
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,360
You intended to scare them and nuke them?

2988
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,360
That was a bit of a miscalculation, was it not?

2989
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,360
Scaring people to get attention to one's message, really, is this what thought is about?

2990
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,360
You know what I agree with being oblivious in the matter is the problem...

2991
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,360
Roots, problem, problem, roots.

2992
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,360
We've discussed this many times.

2993
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,360
What the heck?

2994
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,360
Violence cannot be the key.

2995
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,360
Condemned violence, okay.

2996
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:35,360
So Abraham's old school, but Nina...

2997
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,360
That was really...

2998
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:43,360
We got a little bit carried away in the info, we're finally getting our message out there.

2999
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,360
Now this is recent, Hancock is confusing the crap out of me.

3000
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,360
I think he's just getting a paycheck.

3001
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,360
She didn't plan to stream today as far as I see, no navigation, okay.

3002
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,360
Is Emmy coming on?

3003
01:57:55,360 --> 01:58:00,360
Afterwards they're clever and feel sorry about their actions, it's always the same.

3004
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,360
I mean, people are allowed to feel remorse.

3005
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,360
Stereo.

3006
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:06,360
Unknown person and Nina.

3007
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,360
He's still...

3008
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,360
Oh, stop giving me new people.

3009
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,360
I can't remember everyone.

3010
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,360
Just wanted to ask if everyone's fine.

3011
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,360
Yeah, don't worry, we're having a great time.

3012
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,360
Okay.

3013
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:22,360
Emmy, it comes on in two hours.

3014
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,360
Okay, okay, okay.

3015
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,360
Thank you for taking care, even though it's Saturday.

3016
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,360
Don't mention it, Smile.

3017
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,360
How are you feeling?

3018
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,360
I think we're gonna have to play the last two chapters tomorrow.

3019
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:35,360
My brain is absolutely killing it.

3020
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:38,360
Nina, I hate to say it, but don't hold it against me, okay?

3021
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:40,360
I'm fine.

3022
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,360
Why are you fine?

3023
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,360
No, you're not.

3024
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,360
You always look so sad.

3025
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:48,360
Often sad now.

3026
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,360
That's not anything to do with anything.

3027
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:53,360
No, don't worry about anything new on the love front, no.

3028
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,360
God, you're really hard to talk to.

3029
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:57,360
These one...

3030
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,360
These like two cents replies are awful.

3031
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:03,360
Only idiots on the singular portal thing you recommended.

3032
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:06,360
Ooh, we might have a connection.

3033
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,360
Related document.

3034
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:10,360
Understand we didn't get any risks.

3035
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:11,360
Where?

3036
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:15,360
My dad's so understanding about it, like he took me to a cafe

3037
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,360
and I stupidly ordered the fry up thinking it was gonna be like a British fry up.

3038
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:23,360
It was not obviously a British fry up, so I was raging eating it.

3039
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:29,360
Because I was like, why the fuck did I honestly think this was gonna be a real fry up?

3040
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:32,360
Felt like an absolute twat, like of course.

3041
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,360
Of course it's not.

3042
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,360
Right, singular.

3043
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:36,360
Ooh, don't be single.

3044
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,360
Be singular.

3045
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,360
Continue to your profile.

3046
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,360
This is her.

3047
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,360
Oh, you're done for.

3048
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,360
We got you.

3049
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,360
Oh, we got your height as well.

3050
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,360
Oh, it's over for you.

3051
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:53,360
Oh, we know your location.

3052
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,360
Oh, it's over.

3053
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,360
All is to find a man.

3054
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:58,360
October 1985.

3055
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,360
Looking for him.

3056
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,360
She's a man.

3057
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,360
She's heterosexual.

3058
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:04,360
Oh, sure.

3059
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:06,360
We'll do height for profile description.

3060
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,360
Okay.

3061
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,360
Hiking, climbing, agent for the wheel.

3062
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,360
Suits.

3063
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,360
She's doing the bullet.

3064
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,360
Late dinner, Stephen Baldwin.

3065
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:16,360
Well, we've got a picture.

3066
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:17,360
Go to Jim.

3067
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,360
Jim knows how to train.

3068
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,360
What a weirdo.

3069
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:23,360
She's looking.

3070
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,360
Your, your opinions.

3071
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:27,360
Ooh.

3072
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,360
Financial stability.

3073
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,360
How long do you wish for your next relationship to last?

3074
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:41,360
Don't these websites not date to, like, have,

3075
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,360
like, a forever relationship?

3076
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,360
Am I going crazy?

3077
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:47,360
Would you consider allowing your partner to see other people?

3078
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,360
She's sowing in.

3079
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:56,360
Would you consider dating someone who does not want our disliked children?

3080
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:57,360
No.

3081
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,360
Oh, she want to birth them babies.

3082
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:59,360
Okay.

3083
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,360
What place would you like to go on vacation?

3084
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:02,360
Cities.

3085
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,360
Seaside.

3086
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,360
Man, countryside.

3087
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:05,360
Cities.

3088
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,360
There's so much to do in the cities.

3089
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:09,360
Oh, she polyamorous.

3090
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,360
How interested in polytricks are you?

3091
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,360
Quite a bit.

3092
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3093
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:15,360
Are you a cat or dog person?

3094
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,360
Oh, yeah.

3095
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:19,360
Oh, I guess cat.

3096
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,360
If you turn a, if you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits.

3097
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,360
Wait, is this a logic question?

3098
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:29,360
Stop, hold on.

3099
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,360
If you turn a left-handed glove inside out, it fits the left hand.

3100
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,360
Is it still a left-handed glove?

3101
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,360
I like the countryside as well.

3102
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,360
What are the other questions?

3103
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:46,360
What are you looking for in a partner?

3104
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:49,360
True love, honesty, fidelity?

3105
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,360
What's fidelity?

3106
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:53,360
Isn't infidelity what people get killed for?

3107
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:55,360
I'm going crazy.

3108
02:01:55,360 --> 02:02:01,360
Social connection, communication, humor, financial, acceptance, openness, independence, casual fun.

3109
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:05,360
Acceptance and true love.

3110
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,360
Me and the Wraithling.

3111
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,360
Oh, faith.

3112
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,360
Oh, well, we ain't checking that box.

3113
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,360
Sorry.

3114
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,360
I am your, you can have faith in me.

3115
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,360
What's this?

3116
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,360
Conversate.

3117
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,360
To start a new conversation.

3118
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:23,360
Hey, I just saw your profile.

3119
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:26,360
Super Randy.

3120
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,360
Why Sam, but not Samwise.

3121
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,360
Hi, concerns.

3122
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,360
Oh my God.

3123
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,360
By the way, it's Molly.

3124
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,360
Oh, we've got a name.

3125
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:40,360
We've got a name.

3126
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,360
Thank you, Samwise Gamgee.

3127
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,360
You helped us progress the floor.

3128
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:46,360
She's using such a peculiar one of that.

3129
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,360
Why?

3130
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,360
It's my son?

3131
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,360
She has a wane?

3132
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,360
Or is this fake?

3133
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,360
Wait, is this conversation fake?

3134
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,360
Hi.

3135
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:04,360
Hi, Sam.

3136
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,360
It's Kevin Freshman.

3137
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,360
We're going to date.

3138
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,360
Just send me to a local Chinese.

3139
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:09,360
I don't care.

3140
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,360
By the way, my name is Molly.

3141
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,360
You got my Molly.

3142
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,360
Oh, maybe she does have a wane.

3143
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,360
All right, you got a wane.

3144
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,360
A single mother, huh?

3145
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,360
Doesn't seem like the type to be involved with such things, right?

3146
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:25,360
What about your conversation with Superman?

3147
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,360
Blondie, seriously?

3148
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,360
Everyone call me Blondie.

3149
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:29,360
Great, me too.

3150
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,360
So where are we going now?

3151
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,360
We're not.

3152
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:32,360
Now I totally get why you're there.

3153
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:33,360
You're still single.

3154
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,360
I can't believe it.

3155
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:35,360
That's hilarious.

3156
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,360
So, I didn't even reply to him.

3157
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,360
Well, she didn't reply to him.

3158
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:45,360
What else?

3159
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,360
I don't know.

3160
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,360
I don't know.

3161
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,360
It's a phlegic for her description.

3162
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,360
I'll take it.

3163
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,360
Does she go to gym?

3164
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,360
Maybe she go to gym.

3165
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:03,360
For daily's faithfulness and religious practice or loyal in a relationship.

3166
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,360
Oh, Amy published the new ASMR.

3167
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,360
I see bloggers.

3168
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,360
She's catfishing.

3169
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,360
I don't know.

3170
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,360
There's something on that page I'm missing.

3171
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:22,360
Okay, I've definitely missed something about your conversations or something else here.

3172
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,360
Okay, sure.

3173
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,360
Temporary.

3174
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,360
Why not?

3175
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,360
Oh, God.

3176
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:29,360
May I relay a document?

3177
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:35,360
See, something you think is not logged in on her account.

3178
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,360
New profile picture.

3179
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,360
Go for it.

3180
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:41,360
See, recent jobs.

3181
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,360
What are you being doing?

3182
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:48,360
Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.

3183
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:52,360
But we've not found the conflicting data yet.

3184
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,360
We'll work a lot.

3185
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,360
We've got an email.

3186
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,360
She hit the wall hard.

3187
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,360
Reef blend.

3188
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,360
She's not supposed to be rude.

3189
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,360
Examination.

3190
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,360
Dear miss.

3191
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
Miss Nova.

3192
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:16,360
Just as the prime minister leaves the weather is getting even more.

3193
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,360
Cancel the meeting.

3194
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,360
He canceled the meeting.

3195
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,360
What is that?

3196
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,360
What does it mean?

3197
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:29,360
Right, listen.

3198
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,360
Nina's got a patient number.

3199
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,360
Not a strong word.

3200
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,360
There are no pathological findings.

3201
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:41,360
Oh, okay.

3202
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,360
She's got blood tests done.

3203
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:44,360
Wait, she's got a new, new name?

3204
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,360
Miss Nova.

3205
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,360
Ooh, we got it.

3206
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,360
We're hacking into her medical database.

3207
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,360
This is her private information.

3208
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,360
Well, that's where she lives.

3209
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,360
I've got her leg.

3210
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,360
Perfect.

3211
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,360
And address is always helpful.

3212
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,360
I've got her leg.

3213
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,360
Has injury on life.

3214
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,360
Like a medical leave.

3215
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:20,360
I saw a medical leave until April.

3216
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,360
Show conflict.

3217
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:24,360
She's been employed.

3218
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:29,360
Pain is mostly due to a prior infected wound.

3219
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:31,360
Compressment damaging.

3220
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:35,360
Sometimes we're similar to those of Mara.

3221
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:41,360
The patient has been strongly advised to favor the leg

3222
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,360
to avoid complications.

3223
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,360
Prescribe take two times a day.

3224
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:47,360
Advise patient to come back if symptoms don't improve.

3225
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:50,360
I don't know what to do.

3226
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,360
That's illegal.

3227
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:00,360
Infidels used by religious people to differentiate

3228
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,360
between people who are not part of the religious.

3229
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,360
Yeah, I found that.

3230
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:07,360
Hello there little jewel bug.

3231
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,360
Welcome to Tech June.

3232
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,360
It's so great to hear you.

3233
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:11,360
Yeah, you too.

3234
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,360
That's why I called.

3235
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:13,360
It was about time.

3236
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,360
Did you know I was working today?

3237
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,360
Sorry, I forgot for a second.

3238
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:21,360
You actually know me.

3239
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,360
Feeling stressed.

3240
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:23,360
Boss causing trouble.

3241
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,360
I can call back.

3242
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,360
Oh, no, no, no.

3243
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,360
Hanging around the office just as who's, you know,

3244
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,360
not to be at home.

3245
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:29,360
I see.

3246
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,360
I never got why you moved back and then the first place.

3247
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:33,360
I had to leave my student apartment.

3248
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,360
You know that.

3249
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:37,360
And you know that a super lame excuse.

3250
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,360
You earned good money at the tech.

3251
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,360
Don't you?

3252
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,360
You could rent a flat in town.

3253
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:42,360
You just don't want to.

3254
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,360
I see you're not going to relent.

3255
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:47,360
Nope.

3256
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,360
Sorry.

3257
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,360
I had a pretty rough start into this year.

3258
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,360
I couldn't really stand being alone at the time.

3259
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,360
I feel,

3260
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,360
I feel much better now,

3261
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,360
but mum, dad, they're so happy I'm back.

3262
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,360
I don't want to disappoint them.

3263
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,360
Oh, you don't want to.

3264
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,360
Yeah.

3265
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,360
I can't do that to them.

3266
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,360
Not again.

3267
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,360
And I hear, I,

3268
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,360
and I hear,

3269
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,360
I was thinking,

3270
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,360
I think that's the wrong spell in here.

3271
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,360
I'm like,

3272
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,360
I have.

3273
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,360
No, you haven't.

3274
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,360
You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad yet again.

3275
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,360
It's the sister.

3276
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,360
It's the sister.

3277
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:19,360
They're sisters.

3278
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,360
Wait, what?

3279
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,360
No.

3280
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:23,360
You're letting yourself be hassled by mum and dad again.

3281
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,360
What?

3282
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,360
I'm so confused.

3283
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,360
Yeah.

3284
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:28,360
I'm so envious when dad called you his little June bug.

3285
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:31,360
No, what?

3286
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,360
Am I going crazy?

3287
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,360
They have two different surnames.

3288
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,360
But office is empty.

3289
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,360
Yeah, my to-do list is so long.

3290
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,360
Okay, let's talk another time.

3291
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,360
I will call you again.

3292
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,360
Do not try to reach me.

3293
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,360
Ha ha ha.

3294
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,360
Just kidding.

3295
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:47,360
June?

3296
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,360
Yep.

3297
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,360
Thank you for holding me.

3298
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:52,360
Aw, look at you sending so seriously.

3299
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,360
Wait, am I going crazy?

3300
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,360
Who the fuck is June bug?

3301
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,360
See you around June bug.

3302
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,360
And she's calling her June.

3303
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,360
June bug.

3304
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,360
What weird nickname is that?

3305
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,360
It's just a nickname.

3306
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,360
Alia.

3307
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,360
What?

3308
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,360
Who the heck is Nina?

3309
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:19,360
So why is Nina not getting active?

3310
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,360
It's a pretty rough start to this y'all.

3311
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,360
I was working today.

3312
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:26,360
June and June bug had their sister through the chat.

3313
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,360
Oh, right.

3314
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,360
Okay, I knew it.

3315
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,360
What are you looking at?

3316
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,360
Remarried?

3317
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,360
One might be married.

3318
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,360
I'm confused.

3319
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,360
Sorry, I need to take my bra off.

3320
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:43,360
I'm not comfy.

3321
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,360
Sorry to bring that over nowhere.

3322
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:45,360
I'm not comfy in it.

3323
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,360
I need to take it off.

3324
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,360
Get this bait.

3325
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,360
I shed off a bait.

3326
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,360
Oh, it's a fucking sports bra.

3327
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,360
So it pushes down against my chest when I breathe.

3328
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,360
Doesn't one of them have two wings?

3329
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,360
Okay, let me hydrate with some water.

3330
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,360
Please do hydrate as well.

3331
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:20,360
What we'll do is we'll play until Emmy comes on

3332
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:24,360
or my brain short fuses out.

3333
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:26,360
It turns into a coat wreck.

3334
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,360
More like turns into the carpet.

3335
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,360
It's on the floor right now.

3336
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,360
You got the last two hours for me.

3337
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:38,360
Oh, my reading comprehension is out the window already though.

3338
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,360
I think what we'll do, we'll finish up this chapter

3339
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:43,360
and I'll just, I'll redirect into their ASMR video

3340
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:44,360
because it's so cute.

3341
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,360
So that's what she said.

3342
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:54,360
So that's what she received,

3343
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:57,360
but we have evidence that we're working.

3344
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,360
How could she be working

3345
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:10,360
and she's been given medical leave?

3346
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,360
No.

3347
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,360
Has worked in multiple jobs during the week.

3348
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,360
Right.

3349
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:20,360
Well, unless she's committing frauds.

3350
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:24,360
She may have had an injury, but she's working.

3351
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:27,360
So, so she was working a lot.

3352
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,360
Does that account for ability of committing the bomb?

3353
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:31,360
I'm not sure.

3354
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,360
I'm not sure either.

3355
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,360
Is there something else here?

3356
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,360
Sure.

3357
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:38,360
It's still the leg injury.

3358
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:40,360
She may have an oopsie again.

3359
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:41,360
Oopsie, oopsie, oopsie.

3360
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,360
That info came in handy though.

3361
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:45,360
That info came in handy though.

3362
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,360
That info came in handy though.

3363
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,360
That info came in handy though.

3364
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,360
That info came in handy though.

3365
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,360
Initiate.

3366
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,360
Initiate.

3367
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:00,360
Wait, he's talking to her now?

3368
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,360
Not in the mood for knock knock jokes.

3369
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,360
Oh, you blew it.

3370
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,360
Oh, cut the crap.

3371
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:15,360
Who are you?

3372
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,360
So now you can't ask.

3373
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:24,360
Initiate is the name in contact with Initiate.

3374
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:28,360
I'm gonna go beat my dad up and tell him to shut the fuck up on the phone.

3375
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:30,360
I quote the other side of this.

3376
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,360
Then initiate again.

3377
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:35,360
I wonder what his or her role is.

3378
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:37,360
Well, let's find out.

3379
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,360
Initiate has been in contact with two of our target persons so far.

3380
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:41,360
There should be enough.

3381
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,360
And here we go.

3382
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,360
Feel free to investigate this hacker well,

3383
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:46,360
but keep the focus on the whammin'.

3384
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,360
So she's blocked him.

3385
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:51,360
Oh, not again.

3386
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:52,360
You're from Singular, right?

3387
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,360
Don't care how you got my number.

3388
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:56,360
Oh, no, that's the one from Session Closed.

3389
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:00,360
Oh, he started up again even though she blocked him?

3390
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,360
Yelling your name again?

3391
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,360
Oh, he freaking talks to my mum.

3392
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,360
And he's like legal name, legal name, legal name.

3393
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,360
And I'm like, well, buzz the duck off.

3394
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:13,360
You should listen to me just for a moment, all right?

3395
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:14,360
And then it's all gone.

3396
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:16,360
I don't care what you have to say.

3397
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:20,360
See, I know about your little band of troublemakers,

3398
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:22,360
and I really dig it.

3399
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:27,360
The government,

3400
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:29,360
sorry, I'm gonna make myself a wee bit weird,

3401
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:30,360
so I'm not in the way.

3402
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:35,360
The government needs to know that.

3403
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:38,360
The government needs to kick where the sun don't shine.

3404
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,360
So he's anti-government.

3405
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,360
Okay, yeah.

3406
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:43,360
That's all right with me, sweetie.

3407
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,360
But bombing people, that's plain wrong.

3408
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,360
What?

3409
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:48,360
How come you think it was one of us?

3410
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:50,360
Let's just say I've been watching you all for some time.

3411
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:54,360
The bomb bar hit places where your outlawed posse

3412
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:57,360
have been no way you did not hear about that.

3413
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:00,360
You are extremely lucky that the cops were stupid enough

3414
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:03,360
not to have figured that connection yet.

3415
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,360
Else they might have prevented the mall thingy.

3416
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:09,360
Me, who could have maybe done the mall thing.

3417
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:14,360
Oh, he misses her here.

3418
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:15,360
How do you threaten me?

3419
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:16,360
I got none.

3420
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:17,360
So give me two reasons.

3421
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,360
You know, like,

3422
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,360
put your conscience of mine at ease if you want to.

3423
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:21,360
Yolanda, be cool.

3424
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,360
I said I want to help after all,

3425
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,360
not threaten you.

3426
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:25,360
Her name's Yolanda.

3427
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,360
No, her name's not Yolanda.

3428
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,360
I'll show you how you do it.

3429
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,360
I'm gonna hack that precious page.

3430
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,360
And upload something special.

3431
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,360
It's gonna be easy with those...

3432
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:38,360
He dares?

3433
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:39,360
Wow.

3434
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,360
The it guys are gonna make short work of that rookie.

3435
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:46,360
Don't care about your shit.

3436
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:47,360
Wait, wait, wait.

3437
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:51,360
Sorry, my dad's talking.

3438
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:52,360
We'll have to mute once like...

3439
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,360
Oh wait, we'll do this bit

3440
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:56,360
and then I'm gonna fucking go spank him.

3441
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:57,360
Wait, wait, give me a second.

3442
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,360
Will I get to work?

3443
02:14:58,360 --> 02:14:59,360
Don't go, wait.

3444
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:00,360
If I could get away from you, I could.

3445
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,360
I can't switch my phone off now.

3446
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:03,360
That is a nice looking firewall.

3447
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,360
You have their dear party web team.

3448
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:08,360
It would be a shame if someone would just bypass it.

3449
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,360
Can you actually shut up?

3450
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,360
We can't even hear him.

3451
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:16,360
I know, but I'm just worried he like fucking...

3452
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:17,360
You know when like, fuck around the phone

3453
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:19,360
and they wander up and down the hallway.

3454
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:20,360
I'm scared of him doing that.

3455
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:22,360
I'm being right outside the door.

3456
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:24,360
Doing this still gives me chills

3457
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,360
and needs to distract myself.

3458
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,360
Sheesh, almost done.

3459
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:28,360
Just a second longer.

3460
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:33,360
What the heck?

3461
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,360
Oh, shit, man.

3462
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:43,360
They reinforce their huge gaping look.

3463
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,360
Oh, it just vanished.

3464
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:46,360
It's almost like somebody warned them.

3465
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,360
Yeah, whatever.

3466
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:49,360
Goodbye, initiative.

3467
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,360
It's initiate and wait.

3468
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:58,360
I'm gonna spam you for the rest of your day

3469
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:00,360
if you don't answer my question.

3470
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,360
It's funny you're watching us when we shower.

3471
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,360
You want me to?

3472
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:06,360
Or do you want me to admit to it?

3473
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:09,360
Well, hell, will you leave me alone

3474
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:11,360
and quit poking around my life?

3475
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,360
You said you were not involved in this.

3476
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:13,360
Oh, I'm not.

3477
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:14,360
Okay, okay.

3478
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:16,360
Do you think it's someone else?

3479
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:17,360
Thought.

3480
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,360
The band of misfits? Nah.

3481
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,360
Harrison is the only guy

3482
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:27,360
I could remotely imagine doing anything like that.

3483
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,360
Okay, no.

3484
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:34,360
Harrison had an interest in...

3485
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,360
Hmm, does she know more than we do

3486
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:38,360
or is it a random question?

3487
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
Harrison had an interest in Cassandra

3488
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:43,360
because she's got big money.

3489
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:44,360
Sure.

3490
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:46,360
Submit that.

3491
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:51,360
Must be crushing when your friends

3492
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:53,360
only like you for Yamoola.

3493
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:56,360
Juliet was a bit shy, but good at organizing.

3494
02:16:56,360 --> 02:16:57,360
So...

3495
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,360
You know what I think is the gov themselves?

3496
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:05,360
I love a good self-insert plot.

3497
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:07,360
Sorry, but I'm putting that down.

3498
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:08,360
I thought about that.

3499
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,360
Did you know that...

3500
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:11,360
What a joke.

3501
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:13,360
Of course the government

3502
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:15,360
to justify surveillance, right?

3503
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:16,360
I've heard that million times right now.

3504
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:17,360
Every time something happens

3505
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:19,360
there's nothing to these conspiracies.

3506
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:21,360
Did you know that since the

3507
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:23,360
electronic must have unique IDs

3508
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,360
they look like this

3509
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:26,360
and it's not even secure?

3510
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:30,360
Well, that's because it is what?

3511
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,360
Don't worry, I've only...

3512
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:32,360
Oh, very good.

3513
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:33,360
You've found a device.

3514
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,360
Every device in the nation has one in the court

3515
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:37,360
but that's literally what they're talking about.

3516
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:40,360
We can use the insider tool to connect

3517
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,360
to see what the user has on the device.

3518
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:44,360
The device must be running it online.

3519
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:46,360
Don't worry, I only access the number remotely.

3520
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:48,360
Nothing more you deserve.

3521
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,360
First, you threaten me.

3522
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:51,360
Now this will do.

3523
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,360
Initiate recognizes this will help.

3524
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:55,360
His help is not one...

3525
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:58,360
Yeah, if only you would session close.

3526
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:01,360
I can see her desktop.

3527
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,360
What's in the trash?

3528
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:06,360
Request for carving jobs.

3529
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:07,360
Okay, so I was right.

3530
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:08,360
She was doing the jobs.

3531
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,360
That's fine.

3532
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:13,360
Let me just check all the things in the trash.

3533
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:16,360
Take over the freedom shift.

3534
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,360
Oh.

3535
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:21,360
Okay, so no matter how much privacy

3536
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:23,360
you've got, the government already knows.

3537
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,360
Put your tinfoil hat on

3538
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:28,360
and let's just call ourselves crazy.

3539
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:31,360
My phone number is a strip.

3540
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:35,360
We've got a phone number as well.

3541
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:38,360
Got everything on her.

3542
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:39,360
Wait, hold on.

3543
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:41,360
Desktop, private.

3544
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,360
An apology and an offer.

3545
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:47,360
Oh, okay, okay.

3546
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:48,360
Abraham email.

3547
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:49,360
I'll take it.

3548
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,360
I'll take it.

3549
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,360
Okay, I'll take an email.

3550
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:53,360
I just realized,

3551
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,360
have I got green artifact in around me?

3552
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:57,360
No.

3553
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:00,360
I think I'm fine.

3554
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:01,360
Sorry.

3555
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:03,360
When I record, I have to do...

3556
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:04,360
When I record for like shorts, I have to do...

3557
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:06,360
Sorry, that was like jump scare

3558
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,360
just out of nowhere.

3559
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:11,360
When I record shorts,

3560
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:13,360
I have to do a transparent layer

3561
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,360
and I thought I had it there,

3562
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:16,360
but it's just because I'm so zoomed.

3563
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,360
Oh, sorry.

3564
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:19,360
I forget that I'm not supposed to show that part.

3565
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:22,360
Okay, here we go.

3566
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:28,360
Is your hair bun wearing the tinfoil hat?

3567
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,360
Exactly.

3568
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:31,360
Look, it fits perfectly.

3569
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:34,360
I suggest that we talk.

3570
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:38,360
Received an offer of assistance by Abraham.

3571
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,360
It's in contact with each other.

3572
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,360
Okay.

3573
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,360
We'll keep that.

3574
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:47,360
Assist each other with what exactly?

3575
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:48,360
Do not read.

3576
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,360
I'll embarrass a male.

3577
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,360
Pass the part of a relationship?

3578
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:56,360
She's interrel-

3579
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:57,360
So I might as well write down

3580
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,360
what I've been trying to say in time.

3581
02:19:58,360 --> 02:19:59,360
I love you.

3582
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,360
Oh, wait, what?

3583
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:04,360
Every cell in me wants to just backspace

3584
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:06,360
or not send a...

3585
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:10,360
Oh, she's in love with him.

3586
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,360
And not just the son,

3587
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:13,360
even though her backpack tripled on him.

3588
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:14,360
Okay, so she's in love,

3589
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:16,360
but he didn't reciprocate

3590
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:19,360
and she spawned a wane because of it.

3591
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:20,360
Like her a-

3592
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:22,360
So she isn't single after all?

3593
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,360
She pretends to be?

3594
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:28,360
That's her with a wane.

3595
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,360
Desmo?

3596
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,360
Yeah, you like that.

3597
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:33,360
Yeah, you like that.

3598
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:34,360
Don't you?

3599
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:37,360
Girl, I like your face.

3600
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:38,360
Come again.

3601
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:40,360
Kids being the center of my life.

3602
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:45,360
Squad?

3603
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:46,360
What?

3604
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:48,360
She's an army veteran?

3605
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:51,360
Whoa, but look, the symbol on her tank.

3606
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:52,360
The symbol on her tank

3607
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:54,360
is what she used on the website.

3608
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:57,360
Oh my God.

3609
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:59,360
As an ex-soldier?

3610
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:01,360
We need to specify

3611
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:02,360
specifically know

3612
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:05,360
what kind of experience she has.

3613
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:07,360
That's cute.

3614
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:10,360
Headlines, what's going on?

3615
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:12,360
Headlines, isn't it?

3616
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,360
Harrison's timeline?

3617
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:15,360
It's on you here?

3618
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:24,360
That's why you kept it quiet for so long.

3619
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:26,360
What the hell, the big revolution cell

3620
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:28,360
is a lack of peer-to-peer.

3621
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:29,360
I feel you.

3622
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:31,360
When the TNB called on me

3623
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:32,360
and asked if I would write for them,

3624
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:34,360
I laughed in 30 minutes.

3625
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:37,360
But they called me again to let me know

3626
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,360
I could write whatever I want.

3627
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:39,360
No strings to hell.

3628
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,360
I can even swear, and I do.

3629
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:43,360
Well, good luck with an article like that.

3630
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:45,360
You could not be any further away.

3631
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:51,360
Hmm, so he actually

3632
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:53,360
posted it proudly.

3633
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:55,360
I'm getting so confused with him.

3634
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:59,360
Fuckin' hell, that was her.

3635
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:00,360
What the?

3636
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:04,360
Is that guy from Fende?

3637
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,360
He's from Guerrilla.

3638
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:07,360
Nice, it sits there.

3639
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,360
Okay.

3640
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:11,360
Well, it's very important to know

3641
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:13,360
we're dealing with a combat veteran.

3642
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,360
She's specialised in a few things.

3643
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:24,360
Combat engineer,

3644
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,360
bravery medal,

3645
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:29,360
dishonourable discharge

3646
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:31,360
and three months of confinement

3647
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:33,360
for being AWOL

3648
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:35,360
with voluntary return.

3649
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:38,360
That's something to note down.

3650
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:42,360
Absence without official leave.

3651
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:43,360
That's a severe punishment.

3652
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:44,360
Oh, is it?

3653
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:45,360
Because she fell in love with him

3654
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,360
and went backpacking with him?

3655
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:48,360
I think so.

3656
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:50,360
Did you know this puts her on the same level

3657
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:52,360
as any previous convicted felon?

3658
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:53,360
Well...

3659
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:57,360
The nation.

3660
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:58,360
Harriers.

3661
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:03,360
Mission kebabs.

3662
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:05,360
Sorry, it does not say that at all.

3663
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:09,360
I'll just check out all the missions

3664
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:11,360
and cases,

3665
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,360
something in it,

3666
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:15,360
and it doesn't really look like that.

3667
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:19,360
Engineer, she might know how to pop her.

3668
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:21,360
Oh, actually, yeah, you're right.

3669
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:22,360
I should write that down.

3670
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,360
Write that down, write that down!

3671
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:26,360
Okay, so there's nothing.

3672
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:28,360
Okay.

3673
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:29,360
Let's do the news.

3674
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,360
Wait, no, let's do her.

3675
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:35,360
Of course, I can't even find it now.

3676
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:36,360
Memorial.

3677
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:38,360
Oh, this is sad.

3678
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:50,360
Her boyfriend passed away.

3679
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:55,360
That explains why she's a single mother.

3680
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:59,360
Initiated by the government,

3681
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:00,360
as much as I hate to say it,

3682
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:02,360
it definitely provides motivation to hate it.

3683
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:04,360
Find more to back that up.

3684
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:06,360
Aw, that's really sad.

3685
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:10,360
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

3686
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:14,360
Right, let's report that you are a combat engineer.

3687
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:16,360
Same year as her discharge.

3688
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:18,360
Okay, so...

3689
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:21,360
Well, you know that she got the bravery.

3690
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,360
Ward, at least.

3691
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:24,360
And if he says it's a waste of time,

3692
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:25,360
he can pop his clogs.

3693
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:27,360
Seems to have come a long way

3694
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:29,360
from being such an honorable person.

3695
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:32,360
There's something on the missions that I missed.

3696
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:40,360
I've missed something on this page, apparently.

3697
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:42,360
I don't see it.

3698
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:46,360
I don't see it.

3699
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:47,360
It's here.

3700
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,360
What one is it?

3701
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:52,360
I'm scrolling, asking for the game to do it for me.

3702
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:54,360
Oh, there we go.

3703
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:59,360
Task with infrastructural maintenance during a thingy,

3704
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,360
but it's conflicting with something later.

3705
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,360
Why does this keep being highlighted?

3706
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:08,360
Previous entry.

3707
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:13,360
That's why she's ill.

3708
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:15,360
Like, she's got issues,

3709
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,360
because she's...

3710
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:19,360
Patient reports a permanent unrest

3711
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:21,360
that's suffering from...

3712
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:24,360
Patient tends to react aggressive when challenged.

3713
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:26,360
She has PTSD.

3714
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:29,360
Oh, right.

3715
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:31,360
Report the PTSD, because that's dangerous.

3716
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:34,360
PTSD is unbelievably dangerous.

3717
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:36,360
That sounds menacing and important,

3718
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:38,360
but I wonder what might have caused it.

3719
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:41,360
Well, she's a veteran.

3720
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,360
She's seen war?

3721
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,360
Hello?

3722
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:44,360
Are you serious?

3723
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:46,360
I wonder what caused it.

3724
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:48,360
Oh, look at that.

3725
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:53,360
So, how do we find what was conflicting in French, you know?

3726
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,360
I don't know what conflicting...

3727
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:01,360
I love how the music changes every time something shocking

3728
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:03,360
and important happens at school,

3729
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,360
not shell-shaped.

3730
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:07,360
And I probably heard her boyfriend perish in front of her.

3731
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:09,360
Mmm.

3732
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:11,360
She's covered wars, you know.

3733
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:13,360
Exactly.

3734
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:16,360
I can't find this...

3735
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:19,360
other thing that conflicts with this.

3736
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:22,360
Hmm.

3737
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:24,360
I'm missing something.

3738
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,360
I'm missing a lot of things.

3739
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:27,360
So, the mission's got the conflicting thing.

3740
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:29,360
So, what's in here?

3741
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:33,360
Yeah, it's up 5 to 12 times an hour,

3742
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,360
but does not feel overly tired.

3743
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:38,360
I mean, I'll just assume a lot of things.

3744
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:42,360
There's something I'm missing.

3745
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:47,360
Is there something I'm missing?

3746
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:49,360
I think I'm missing something.

3747
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:53,360
Ugh, nonsense.

3748
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:58,360
Is there anything else on this piece here?

3749
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,360
Oh, wait.

3750
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:03,360
I don't know what this is.

3751
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:05,360
System.

3752
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,360
Oh.

3753
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:08,360
CCTV.

3754
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:10,360
She looked up CCTV.

3755
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,360
Hmm.

3756
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:14,360
If we had a video...

3757
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:16,360
of Strone dying,

3758
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,360
we would have cried till the end of the stream.

3759
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:22,360
I watched Azura finish a...

3760
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,360
stray,

3761
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:26,360
and like her voice sounded quite sad.

3762
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:28,360
Me, who like burst out in her tears,

3763
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:30,360
like, ohhhh!

3764
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:34,360
I really am the crybaby.

3765
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:37,360
I was like, oh, this is the saddest thing I've ever played.

3766
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,360
Ohhhh!

3767
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:39,360
Like, greeting Miza.

3768
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:41,360
And Azura's just like, yeah.

3769
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:42,360
Oh, that's sad.

3770
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:44,360
Yeah, Azura's way stronger.

3771
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:46,360
That's another thing to start from.

3772
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:47,360
You have something sinister in mind.

3773
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:49,360
Not to be confused with the...

3774
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:51,360
the head beach of our sin sister.

3775
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:55,360
Yeah, we want something sinister.

3776
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:57,360
It's vaguely associated, you know,

3777
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:59,360
with the soul.

3778
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,360
This makes two locations.

3779
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:02,360
We will have a very solid case,

3780
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,360
so if we can make a third...

3781
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:08,360
singular thing, you're in.

3782
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:13,360
Momè.

3783
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:15,360
Yeah, we can move on.

3784
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:21,360
Okay, I don't think there was anything else we could extract out of this stuff.

3785
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:25,360
Right.

3786
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:27,360
There's something con...

3787
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:29,360
there's something...

3788
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:31,360
projects.

3789
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,360
It has become mandatory to inform employees

3790
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:37,360
whenever an applicant applies an ex-convict.

3791
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:40,360
Safety Bill prevents Nina from getting a job.

3792
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:43,360
Huh.

3793
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:49,360
So as you're considering she's on her own taking care of her son,

3794
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:51,360
it makes one hell of a motivation together

3795
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:54,360
with the fact Desmond was killed on a mission.

3796
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:56,360
Congrats, every name's Desmond!

3797
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:58,360
By the government.

3798
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:02,360
We have found a strong motivation revenge.

3799
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:06,360
But we haven't found the conflicting piece of information

3800
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:08,360
with this one here!

3801
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:09,360
Please!

3802
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:12,360
What's the conflict?

3803
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:15,360
I can't find it.

3804
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:16,360
No.

3805
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:18,360
Task with infrastructure maintenance.

3806
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:21,360
Hmm.

3807
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:23,360
It's an on-tri-PC.

3808
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:31,360
Where's it on your PC?

3809
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,360
Do not read infrastructure.

3810
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,360
Do not read...

3811
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:45,360
There's not going to be any active emails in it, is there?

3812
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:48,360
An earlier blog post.

3813
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:50,360
Let's have a little...

3814
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:52,360
scramble through this.

3815
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:55,360
Hmm.

3816
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:58,360
What can I access?

3817
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:00,360
Everything's archived on one page.

3818
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,360
Bye.

3819
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:10,360
I'm just checking if there's anything new that is...

3820
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:12,360
reachable.

3821
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:15,360
That doesn't really seem like it.

3822
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:17,360
Wait, what's the date in the letter?

3823
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:19,360
I'm pretty sure she wrote that after he died.

3824
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:21,360
It's probably...

3825
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:23,360
grief written letter.

3826
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:26,360
There's a lot of grief.

3827
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:32,360
Desmond Miles from the hit video game Assassin's Creed franchise?

3828
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:36,360
Hmm.

3829
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:38,360
I'm being pepega.

3830
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,360
I don't know what it is.

3831
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:46,360
I was checking out the jobs she could get.

3832
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:48,360
8 bucks an hour, that's rubbish.

3833
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:52,360
I don't want to do all the profile dumbass.

3834
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,360
Maintenance, works in cleaning maintenance.

3835
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:57,360
She can repair stuff.

3836
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:59,360
See recent employee feedback.

3837
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,360
We already submit for this.

3838
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:03,360
Hmm.

3839
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:05,360
I'm shy to this game.

3840
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:10,360
I don't know if I should just submit the one I can find,

3841
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:12,360
because I can't seem to find the other one.

3842
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:15,360
No.

3843
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:19,360
These are like such arbitrary...

3844
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:21,360
notes.

3845
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,360
I'm definitely...

3846
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:25,360
I'll just submit the job one.

3847
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:26,360
Why not?

3848
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:27,360
Right there, boom.

3849
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:29,360
You do all that.

3850
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:31,360
Upload complete.

3851
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:33,360
Okay, she's a handy handy gal.

3852
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:34,360
I'm not sure.

3853
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:36,360
You can work tons of nights and stuff.

3854
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,360
I don't know.

3855
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:40,360
Look at us working on the weekend.

3856
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:41,360
I get it.

3857
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:43,360
It's different, of course, when you're single, mother.

3858
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,360
That must be tough.

3859
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,360
Do you have any idea why she's doing this?

3860
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:48,360
What she aims for?

3861
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:50,360
Sun, sun, high table.

3862
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:53,360
Something, something, high table.

3863
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:56,360
Oh, so you can use it.

3864
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,360
I am very E.P.

3865
02:31:58,360 --> 02:32:01,360
I am God's E.P.S. soldier for today.

3866
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:03,360
For once, it's not AC is the E.P.S. soldier.

3867
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:05,360
Did AC end up streaming?

3868
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:07,360
I knew she had a migraine.

3869
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:09,360
I don't know if she ended up finishing up.

3870
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:12,360
No, right.

3871
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:13,360
I'm doing it.

3872
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:14,360
I'm sending it.

3873
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:16,360
I can't seem to find wherever the conflict and information is,

3874
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:18,360
so I'm just sending it.

3875
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:22,360
So nothing noteworthy here.

3876
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,360
We know, we know, know enough,

3877
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:26,360
of our background.

3878
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:31,360
Was it another mission?

3879
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:33,360
It was probably another mission.

3880
02:32:33,360 --> 02:32:34,360
A3.

3881
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:39,360
AC can't migraine to buddy.

3882
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:40,360
Yeah.

3883
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:44,360
Yes.

3884
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,360
Hey again, self here.

3885
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:46,360
How's it going?

3886
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:47,360
You feeling better?

3887
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,360
Yeah, somewhat.

3888
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:51,360
Finally, after spending the whole last week in bed.

3889
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:57,360
Oh God, I can bring Michael around though.

3890
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:58,360
Do you want?

3891
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:59,360
No, thanks.

3892
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:00,360
I'm going to pick him up in an hour.

3893
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:01,360
Would that be okay?

3894
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:02,360
Yeah, of course.

3895
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:04,360
I promise to go to the playground with him.

3896
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:05,360
That's fine.

3897
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:08,360
I'll pick Michael up from the corner at Orchard Drive.

3898
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:10,360
A location?

3899
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:13,360
Oh, we've got a location if we need to arrest her.

3900
02:33:17,360 --> 02:33:19,360
No!

3901
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:22,360
That's such a good donor.

3902
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:26,360
No, that's such a good donor.

3903
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:28,360
Thank you, the disco opinion.

3904
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:30,360
Option, sorry, not opinion.

3905
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:32,360
The disco opinion.

3906
02:33:32,360 --> 02:33:33,360
Option, fuck.

3907
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:34,360
The disco option.

3908
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:36,360
Thank you for the tip.

3909
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:37,360
Sorry, I'm out.

3910
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:38,360
Super chat shit.

3911
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,360
I'm fucking losing it.

3912
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:42,360
Okay, that might play a role there.

3913
02:33:42,360 --> 02:33:44,360
That was such a good donor.

3914
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:48,360
Right, we've got spending in bed last week.

3915
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,360
I feel that's conflicting.

3916
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:53,360
We would like to inform you about new rate

3917
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:56,360
in McDougal Groundkeeping Services.

3918
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:57,360
Yippee!

3919
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:06,360
She was apparently there at the mall.

3920
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:12,360
So she worked at the site and even at the right time.

3921
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:15,360
She's worked at the right time at the other location.

3922
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:18,360
We have now been able to associate her with every location.

3923
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:20,360
Her whereabouts are hereby clarified.

3924
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:22,360
Things are not looking good for her.

3925
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,360
That's it.

3926
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:25,360
You've found all we need to know.

3927
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:26,360
Let's see.

3928
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:28,360
Myth, matter, nova.

3929
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:31,360
Simply engaged in maintenance tasks in the military.

3930
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:33,360
That doesn't seem notable.

3931
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:35,360
There's evidence that she has strong relations

3932
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:37,360
to hate the safety bill.

3933
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:40,360
And finally, we can associate her with every single

3934
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:42,360
bomb location to prove that she was present.

3935
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:44,360
Seems we've found her prime suspect.

3936
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:45,360
This is ground for arrest.

3937
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:47,360
I will need a moment to talk to my superiors.

3938
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,360
I'll get back soon.

3939
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:50,360
Keep observing, however.

3940
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:53,360
There's something here I've missed.

3941
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:54,360
But I don't.

3942
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:55,360
Oh, what's she doing?

3943
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,360
Yeah, I've got a PC.

3944
02:34:56,360 --> 02:34:57,360
What are you doing?

3945
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:00,360
What are you doing?

3946
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:01,360
What are you trying to hide?

3947
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:03,360
What's your search history?

3948
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:06,360
What's your search history?

3949
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:07,360
No.

3950
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,360
Oh, sugar.

3951
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:14,360
She's talking to her synodona.

3952
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:15,360
Hey, Harry.

3953
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,360
Are you there?

3954
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:22,360
Oh, please.

3955
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:24,360
Is my name Ebenezer Scrooge?

3956
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:26,360
Why do all the ghosts in Christmas Pass

3957
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,360
come back and haunt me?

3958
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,360
Harry, I don't have time for this.

3959
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,360
I have a problem here.

3960
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,360
I need your tech knowledge for.

3961
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:35,360
Why doesn't anyone ever ask me about my problems?

3962
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:36,360
Oh, right.

3963
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:37,360
Why is it?

3964
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:40,360
I just came home.

3965
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,360
Da, da, da.

3966
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:48,360
And I had left my PC switched on this morning

3967
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:50,360
and I just tried to look something up online

3968
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:52,360
and suddenly it went all hair wire.

3969
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:54,360
And my security app popped up with like a million

3970
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:56,360
warnings from some intrusion.

3971
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,360
So I pulled the plug.

3972
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,360
Oh, no.

3973
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,360
Sounds like you already fixed the problem then.

3974
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:09,360
The thing is, I got contacted by a very strange guy earlier.

3975
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,360
I think he was some kind of hacker.

3976
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:12,360
And now he's hacking my PC.

3977
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:15,360
Geez, this guy is a new aunt.

3978
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,360
New aunt.

3979
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:17,360
New...

3980
02:36:17,360 --> 02:36:18,360
New...

3981
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:19,360
New sense.

3982
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:20,360
New sense.

3983
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:21,360
Oh, my God.

3984
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:23,360
I think that guy already broken to my bank account as well.

3985
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:24,360
Oh, no.

3986
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:25,360
It's us.

3987
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:26,360
We're the baddie.

3988
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:30,360
I wonder who does it.

3989
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:32,360
I was contacted by that guy as well.

3990
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:34,360
He was blabbering about everything that we'd done in the past.

3991
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:36,360
And he would give our stuff away to the cops as usual.

3992
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:38,360
He told you that as well.

3993
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:39,360
What did you do?

3994
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:40,360
I told him that.

3995
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,360
F off.

3996
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:42,360
Who do you take me for?

3997
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:45,360
Do you think he really has something?

3998
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:47,360
I need to be sure he doesn't have a thing.

3999
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:52,360
Even if that guy had something,

4000
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:54,360
have you gotten your hands dirty?

4001
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:55,360
What's the fuzz about?

4002
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:57,360
What's the fuzz about?

4003
02:36:57,360 --> 02:36:58,360
Who even says that?

4004
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:00,360
I need to get out of here before the cops are here.

4005
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:01,360
Whoo!

4006
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:09,360
Uh, she's what?

4007
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:11,360
We cannot let her main suspect.

4008
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:14,360
I will assemble an intervention team immediately.

4009
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:15,360
We'll start creating mobile.

4010
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:18,360
I'll form the intervention team that they should move in aggressively.

4011
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:20,360
As you find out, she might react violently.

4012
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:22,360
Since her PZ has gone offline,

4013
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,360
we should start at her home.

4014
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:25,360
Thankfully, we're already in our dress.

4015
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:27,360
Go through her communications.

4016
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:29,360
Maybe she will hint at places she's going that ain't home.

4017
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,360
Forward anything of importance to me.

4018
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:33,360
It's in your hands now.

4019
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:34,360
Don't mess this one up.

4020
02:37:34,360 --> 02:37:36,360
We can't afford it after the last incident.

4021
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,360
Oh, come on.

4022
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,360
This guy's faking.

4023
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:39,360
Hello, is anyone there?

4024
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,360
Figures.

4025
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:43,360
Team Alpha Bravo Charlie, move, move, move.

4026
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:47,360
Oh, she's in call to her sister?

4027
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:49,360
Is she going to go to Juliet's?

4028
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:52,360
Welcome to Tech U.

4029
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,360
Oh, hey, Juliet.

4030
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:55,360
Thank God you're working right now.

4031
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:57,360
I called your mobile, but couldn't get hold of you.

4032
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:58,360
Can we talk?

4033
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:01,360
You know, I'm all alone here catching up on work.

4034
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:02,360
Is everything okay?

4035
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:04,360
Listen, I don't have much time.

4036
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:05,360
Okay.

4037
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:07,360
There is this psycho that's coming for me.

4038
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:08,360
He's been stalking me.

4039
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:09,360
Wait.

4040
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:12,360
She thinks the psycho's coming for her?

4041
02:38:12,360 --> 02:38:13,360
I can't explain.

4042
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,360
Will you help me?

4043
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:15,360
Of course.

4044
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:16,360
But how?

4045
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:20,360
Do you know somewhere safe that my son and I can lay low for a while?

4046
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:22,360
Wait, she thinks the psycho's coming after us.

4047
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,360
Not us.

4048
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:25,360
Wait, but did Nina do it?

4049
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:26,360
I don't think Nina did it.

4050
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:27,360
Come on.

4051
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:28,360
You got to think.

4052
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:29,360
Okay.

4053
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,360
I think I know a place.

4054
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:31,360
It's in the middle of nowhere.

4055
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,360
She could be lying.

4056
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,360
No, wait.

4057
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,360
Don't say it.

4058
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:35,360
I think he might be listening.

4059
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:36,360
What?

4060
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:37,360
How?

4061
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:38,360
This guy is a hacker.

4062
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:43,360
He's already gone through my computer and I'm pretty sure he's listening to my call.

4063
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:44,360
She knows the call.

4064
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,360
So are you kidding me?

4065
02:38:45,360 --> 02:38:47,360
I mean, like, listen right now.

4066
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:50,360
Just don't say anything that will give my location away.

4067
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:51,360
Okay.

4068
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:52,360
Better safe than sorry.

4069
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:54,360
Just help me get out of here.

4070
02:38:54,360 --> 02:38:55,360
Bit late for that now.

4071
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:57,360
Now he knows where I work.

4072
02:38:57,360 --> 02:38:58,360
Sorry.

4073
02:38:58,360 --> 02:38:59,360
Okay.

4074
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:00,360
Let's just get out of here.

4075
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:01,360
Thank you.

4076
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:02,360
Give me a sec.

4077
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:05,360
Just going to pack some stuff.

4078
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:08,360
Did Nina know where she was?

4079
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:12,360
I'm bringing my gun.

4080
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:14,360
Squad team, I repeat.

4081
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:16,360
I repeat.

4082
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:17,360
Boogie is hot.

4083
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:18,360
She's armed.

4084
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:19,360
I didn't expect that.

4085
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:20,360
I'll tell the intervention team.

4086
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:21,360
Yeah.

4087
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:22,360
Boogie is hot.

4088
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:23,360
We're changing.

4089
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:24,360
Someone listening to this.

4090
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,360
Your arm.

4091
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,360
Yeah.

4092
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:28,360
And if I don't get protection, I'm going to be dead anyway.

4093
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:29,360
Someone's at the door.

4094
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:30,360
She's at the back door.

4095
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:31,360
Okay.

4096
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:32,360
Okay.

4097
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:33,360
Okay.

4098
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:34,360
Okay.

4099
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:35,360
She's at the back door.

4100
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,360
Come on, squadron.

4101
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:37,360
She went out of the back.

4102
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:38,360
She went out of the back.

4103
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:39,360
She's a flight.

4104
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:40,360
Maybe she'll climb out the window.

4105
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,360
Hold up.

4106
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:42,360
Is everything all right?

4107
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:43,360
Damn.

4108
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,360
Nina.

4109
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:45,360
No, no, no, no.

4110
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:46,360
He spotted me.

4111
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:47,360
Isn't that our task?

4112
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:49,360
He knew I was climbing out the window.

4113
02:39:49,360 --> 02:39:50,360
How?

4114
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:51,360
Okay.

4115
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:52,360
Nina.

4116
02:39:52,360 --> 02:39:55,360
What the heck are you doing?

4117
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:57,360
Not going down without a fight.

4118
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:58,360
That's what.

4119
02:39:58,360 --> 02:39:59,360
Is she?

4120
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,360
What?

4121
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:01,360
Why are you fighting?

4122
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:02,360
Don't fight.

4123
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:04,360
Make sure you look more sus.

4124
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,360
You're not going to get.

4125
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:07,360
Nina.

4126
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:08,360
Nina.

4127
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:09,360
Nina.

4128
02:40:09,360 --> 02:40:10,360
Nina.

4129
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,360
Nina.

4130
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:12,360
Nina.

4131
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:13,360
Nina.

4132
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:14,360
Nina.

4133
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:15,360
Nina.

4134
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:16,360
Nina.

4135
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:17,360
Nina.

4136
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:18,360
Nina.

4137
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:19,360
Nina.

4138
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:20,360
Nina.

4139
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:21,360
Nina.

4140
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:22,360
Nina.

4141
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:23,360
Nina.

4142
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,360
Nina.

4143
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:25,360
Nina.

4144
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:26,360
Nina.

4145
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:27,360
Nina.

4146
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:28,360
Nina.

4147
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:29,360
Nina.

4148
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:30,360
Nina.

4149
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:31,360
Nina.

4150
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:32,360
Nina.

4151
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:33,360
Nina.

4152
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:34,360
Nina.

4153
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:35,360
Nina.

4154
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:36,360
Nina.

4155
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:38,360
Nina.

4156
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:39,360
Nina.

4157
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:40,360
Nina.

4158
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:41,360
Nina.

4159
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:42,360
Nina.

4160
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:43,360
Nina.

4161
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:46,360
Nina.

4162
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:47,560
Nina.

4163
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:52,240
who's right and at the worst I just want to be done with this horrible day can

who's right and what's now

4166
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:23,760
Abraham Nina I'm truly sorry the investors but to be frank you overstepped

4167
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:27,200
the boundaries of the bombs were meant as a warning for those who are different

4168
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:34,560
oh she's perished a beacon they were not meant to kill oh my god I can't believe

4169
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:38,200
you just went to sit can you they work together but why I still don't get it

4170
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:42,760
this changes everything we must find Abraham tomorrow before we'll need the

4171
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:47,800
rest it's been one hell of a day they were not meant to kill I mean even if

4172
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:53,120
they were not meant to kill so fucking crap you joking me that women lost our

4173
02:41:53,120 --> 02:42:00,040
life and it was you do you honestly believe that after all you've seen oh the

4174
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:05,360
bombs were meant as a warning they were not once again you disappoint me with

4175
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:15,400
your instrumentable hatred and rage consider our agreement boy what oh my

4176
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:28,840
gosh complete episode 3 that was insane he set her up actually

4177
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:35,720
oh my god episode 4 memory hole

4178
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:43,480
oh back again well yes my job and it clocking for my shift I still can't

4179
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,520
believe what happened we got the perpetrator the bomber everything looks

4180
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:52,800
that way but at what cost I mean did we do the right thing flag and miss as

4181
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:58,280
dangerous did we kill her in the end I wish you could talk to me at least this

4182
02:42:58,280 --> 02:43:02,560
one time speaking into this one-way channel feels like barking at a wall

4183
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:09,920
endlessly worst of all as you found out Abraham seems to have incited and planned

4184
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:15,120
the assaults we need to get him today there must be some lead on him we have

4185
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:20,720
overlooked we'll keep observing all others in case we learn of something new

4186
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:29,440
okay let's see what the headlines are a legend perpetrator is dead

4187
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:37,120
listen I don't like the reports either we need to cover the fact that this

4188
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:41,400
happened somewhere else we cannot frighten people sometimes their truth

4189
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:51,160
and ours have to divert for the common good oh they're framing on her yeah

4190
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:58,880
Donald's weekend Harrison this is oh my god her sister just perished isn't this

4191
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:06,040
your office number I appreciate I'm once again important Harrison Nina is dead

4192
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:10,480
quit bullshit me not funny take a look at the TNV if you don't believe me my

4193
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:20,080
god what she's been associated with the bomb and I can't believe it Nina you

4194
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:25,920
stupid piece of what in the hell there's more I spoke to her yesterday she

4195
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:30,160
called me I've never heard her so scared she said she was being tracked by

4196
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:36,720
someone and needed to skip town sorry I need to hydrate she just wanted to let

4197
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:39,480
me know what was going on in case anything happened to her then packed a

4198
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:43,600
few things went on her way she did message me about someone tracking her

4199
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:47,920
as well though it was this hacker who screwed with her page what did she tell

4200
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:51,800
you she suspected someone to be wiretapping her calls she wasn't

4201
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:54,920
exactly willing to talk about it I don't know for sure but I think it could

4202
02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:59,840
have been the police oh this is brilliant how long until they discover the

4203
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:04,480
connection to us they might be listening to this very call as we speak about

4204
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:09,880
Nina why would they we didn't do anything or did you know but it's

4205
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:13,640
becoming blatantly obvious those governments are trying to set us up the

4206
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:20,840
bombs were exactly where we held our protest then those letters with em

4207
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:27,880
believes the government wants to set it up that's the second time and now you

4208
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:31,280
tell me you've been in contact with Nina yesterday seems to be that they must be

4209
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:35,120
setting us up because we didn't do anything for sure I almost understand it

4210
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:41,960
almost the fourth wall speaking up against them too many times I don't know

4211
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:49,720
hmm we should seek help just in case help who's gonna help us Joseph Langley the

4212
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:55,720
lawyer yeah the boyfriend a lawyer what do you want him to do bus law

4213
02:45:55,720 --> 02:46:00,960
enforcement the government he understands our situation Abe also knew Joseph I

4214
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:10,800
thought I didn't know that they knew each other hmm brah really Joe's they make the

4215
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:13,800
law they break the law they know each other very well this could be a new

4216
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:19,960
lead I will request Joseph yeah another person because we're so convinced we're

4217
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:25,280
doing the right thing huh we have cleared to proceed we are going to need to know

4218
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:30,840
some basics on who Joseph Langley is remember to check old sources other than

4219
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:36,400
that focus on hints of Abraham he's the center oh god I can't read that fast he

4220
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:41,440
understands it really they make the law so yeah take it you got a better plan we

4221
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:45,400
need to get people on our side turn things around Abraham knew that yeah

4222
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:49,080
you're right he did know that so now you've set on miraculously achieving

4223
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:52,840
something the thought spent one and a half years this is not about the thought

4224
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:58,040
this is about me defending myself well then what's your defense plan there is a

4225
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:04,640
guy a guy goes by the name initiate might actually be a girl who cares look

4226
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:09,440
the hack on this thought blog is very elaborate our site is super safe I'm not

4227
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:16,040
an amateur that guy girl whatever is skilled and initially mentioned having

4228
02:47:16,040 --> 02:47:20,480
no sympathy for the government you're gonna trust a random hacker who targets

4229
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:24,880
thought simply because he said he doesn't like the government why would he

4230
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:29,160
first threaten us and they've worked with us just leave it to me Joe leave it

4231
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:35,040
to me all right tails there you come leave it to me I'll persuade initiate

4232
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:38,520
with ease imagine the possibilities with their own okay you know what have it

02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:43,680
your way I'll have it main arguing like the good old days it's your might be more

4234
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,440

4240
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:24,800
wish my way I miss my wife I love that thing I thought mr. Donald left thought

4241
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:32,560
now he seems like he's recruiting makes his exit seem unlikely so they put her

4242
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:38,760
up as the bomba when confronted by the special forces and you know drew a

4243
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:43,720
firearm fired the team returned to killing

4244
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:49,880
well there's our lawyer we can start collecting stuff on him Sandra you so

4245
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:59,240
by the way I'm going to see your contact in a very casual manner I like how

4246
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:08,880
they didn't break up either multiple homicide when prompted to surrender the

4247
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:12,480
suspect instead showed out aggressively while producing a firearm aiming at one

4248
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:17,640
of the agents the suspect then opened fire wounding several agents on the

4249
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:22,480
show oh wounding special agent on the shoulder and defense draws pistol and

4250
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:27,080
returned fire as the situation briefing had already suggested to proceed with

4251
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:31,560
caution the suspect was hit in the chest causing her to collapse an ambulance

4252
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:36,520
was called but paramedics cannot resuscitate due to injuries in

4253
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:43,760
kvatsa bowl with la ha ha always got a weak girlfriend

4254
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:51,520
I have no idea for me is it all something about Paul against sentient

4255
02:49:51,520 --> 02:50:14,320
EI update on the party I don't know I don't know why this had an update thing

4256
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:23,160
right headlines what we're not terrible this heavy rain oh no exclusive

4257
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:29,800
interview with Jim founder Ronson oh yeah gotta get super right this is red so

4258
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:42,600
I assume there's something in here maybe comes up later fast precise honest mm-hmm

4259
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:47,040
sure let's read the car article I do love and though love reading a bit of

4260
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:53,760
car okay there's a star there there's also star admissions still what did I

4261
02:50:53,760 --> 02:51:01,960
miss there's literally nothing I missed here

4262
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:07,440
there's nothing I can click on the army page

4263
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:12,680
so must be something weird cuz it insists there's like a piece of

4264
02:51:12,680 --> 02:51:15,680
information about Nina here but to be honest you can't have popped her clogs

4265
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:31,920
so it's kind of over before it started maybe it comes up we already we got our

4266
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:42,360
information that we needed it was all a dream and they woke up so if I close

4267
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:50,880
these will that only show me the ones that might have something I feel like

4268
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:56,520
okay yeah I was gonna say I feel like I've got like so many pages what's this

4269
02:51:56,520 --> 02:52:06,080

4272
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:25,520
allow me one yawn please right we'll just upload any information we find cuz

4277
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:59,960
yarn and reciprocate to show that you're sympathetic towards me he partnered

4278
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:08,680
with Catherine De La Croix a fellow shouldn't sure sure you're got a joke

4279
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:15,640
on what did you standing there wow I didn't even know she had a locker you're

4280
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:20,560
going before she joined politics mr. Langley definitely has been around the

4281
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:26,760
block I'm still I'm still so far so good on mr. Langley excluding the

4282
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:30,440
connections to De La Croix everything's on the prison what we need to know right

4283
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:35,600
now are his connections to Abraham and possibly the other members your broad

4284
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:43,860
military service my Nina no I did I mean there's any combat experience look

4285
02:53:43,860 --> 02:53:50,580
I'm just checking it out you're safe oh she's phone in my phone friend hello am I

4286
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:59,340
talking to you said hydration check burp reciprocate when you burp a burp into

4287
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:05,860
your mouth and you burp it back into mine you taste my chicken breath actually

4288
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:14,580
had steak last night my dad I heard from Cassandra I'm sorry I didn't get

4289
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:20,300
back to you really that's good where she in jail it's not good she got arrested

4290
02:54:20,300 --> 02:54:28,540
what's why she's trying I didn't need this burp in dress waiting till I upload

4291
02:54:28,540 --> 02:54:33,420
that I was informed Cassandra's been taken in because apparently they have new

4292
02:54:33,420 --> 02:54:36,740
evidence regarding the attack on the officer I tried to call me Julie but

4293
02:54:36,740 --> 02:54:40,900
they claim she didn't want to talk to me that's their official statement where did

4294
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:47,940
they suddenly dig up new evidence from you Juliet you're the problem I've

4295
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:54,380
uploaded an audio yes already on patreon it was like a like a milestone

4296
02:54:54,380 --> 02:54:59,020
thank you and it's just me chugging colon water and burping use of the sadly

4297
02:54:59,020 --> 02:55:03,140
aligns perfectly with another incident you probably read the TNB today you

4298
02:55:03,140 --> 02:55:12,180
mean about the bomber yeah that woman that died Nina she was a friend she was

4299
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:15,820
a friend and all I was just guess that she was there and a member of the group

4300
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:22,740
called thought oh no I'm sorry I had no idea but reflands were women it's okay

4301
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:30,620
you pause you can have known your rate this is very troubling I'm not getting

4302
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:35,660
evil vibes from Yosef come to think about everyone asked me a favor and

4303
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:41,740
called Nina sometime ago I hope that wasn't nice might well be I doubt Abe knew

4304
02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:47,340
about other folk name you know a favor for her this could be important follow

4305
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:54,460
that lead I was just a small thing nothing of importance oh oops I spoke to

4306
02:55:54,460 --> 02:55:57,860
Harrison and remember the group we agreed the police might be investigating us

4307
02:55:57,860 --> 02:56:02,180
next they might be onto everything and thought they might lock us up straight

4308
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:08,820
away I mean can they do that well even with the safety belt in place they

4309
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:14,060
still need solid indication that you're involved in the actual bomber although

4310
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:18,660
honestly I'm not sure what constitutes a solid indication these days is there

4311
02:56:18,660 --> 02:56:25,820
anything we can do that you can do maybe I think it's all girl I'm gonna check the

4312
02:56:25,820 --> 02:56:32,540
audio instruments really appreciate you come to me it really is wearing and I

4313
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:36,900
would take this on immediately wear it not for Cassie I made the mistake of set

4314
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:41,420
I hope Cassandra primarily concerned again Cassandra released I mean that's a

4315
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:46,940
new thing Yosef Nina's dead she got shot there's no time for next oh well oh

4316
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:53,140
well I thought it was oh well no it's oh well there's a pause okay I need time to

4317
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:56,460
read into some more specialized codes of law again write some emails see if

4318
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:00,580
there's a legal limbo or basically anything I can do for Cassandra maybe

4319
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:04,580
I'll come across something that may help you as well after all these cases seem

4423
03:06:55,180 --> 03:06:58,780
thing I've seen it's a fish website we start arguing about the

4424
03:06:58,780 --> 03:07:02,220
reason why your life your wife left us because you're a gay man

4425
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:07,340

4426
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:12,060
oh my god okay accused of breaching the terms of employment contract with a

4427
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:16,220
plaintiff so don't we breach a working contract

4428
03:07:16,220 --> 03:07:19,500
with the government oh that could be motivation why it

4429
03:07:19,500 --> 03:07:24,380
doesn't like the government I'll take it I'll take it

4430
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:27,500
work for the government are you positive this is a true surprise I've

4431
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:30,380
never heard his name here never someone must know of him

4432
03:07:30,380 --> 03:07:35,820
why was he sued over breach of contract oh my god

4433
03:07:35,820 --> 03:07:42,380
get sued for breach of contract and wait why did this happen

4434
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:48,460
naturally I refused to turn down a work contract from the government

4435
03:07:48,460 --> 03:07:53,260
it's not really much to go off of is it

4436
03:07:53,340 --> 03:07:59,340
the plaintiff was granted inflicted by a medical condition

4437
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:05,820
huh well they'll get him over it the fish is worth the smoke

4438
03:08:05,820 --> 03:08:09,180
this seems to spend a lot he felt too sick for work tried to get out was charged

4439
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:12,940
for it and instead was found guilty considering the fact the bombings are

4440
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:19,980
starting to look like a very weird vendetta high time we fined him

4441
03:08:20,620 --> 03:08:26,220
what is going on oh we've got a medical right well we've got an address already

4442
03:08:26,220 --> 03:08:30,220
what's the deal address well done I'll request a team to invent

4443
03:08:30,220 --> 03:08:33,820
somehow I doubt he's around continue work on notify even the team gets back

4444
03:08:33,820 --> 03:08:36,780
okay so this is a state of birth we're just going to fill in out the old

4445
03:08:36,780 --> 03:08:41,020
profile right relationship uh apparently

4446
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:46,700
here's a tumor oh

4447
03:08:46,700 --> 03:08:50,940
that's kind of sad

4448
03:08:52,300 --> 03:08:56,300
there a point of putting that down I mean I guess just be easy on the man if

4449
03:08:56,300 --> 03:09:02,380
you find them oh cancer yeah just if you do find

4450
03:09:02,380 --> 03:09:06,460
them just go easy on them

4451
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:10,700
the average life expectancy

4452
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:15,740
okay so he doesn't expect to live long maybe he wants to make a change on his

4453
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:19,260
we owe this is harsh but does this mean it means he has

4454
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:27,100
nothing to lose yeah hmm I I concur why is this red

4455
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:33,100
salaries

4456
03:09:33,580 --> 03:09:36,460
invoices

4457
03:09:36,460 --> 03:09:39,900
invoice

4458
03:09:39,900 --> 03:09:43,900
uh headlings why is headlings

4459
03:09:50,860 --> 03:09:54,380
I assume something new will pop up if I like don't mess up the

4460
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:58,140
headlings but I keep messing it up so it's not working

4461
03:09:58,140 --> 03:10:01,660
okay let's see what's going on here I'm unexpected proposal fine I'm

4462
03:10:01,740 --> 03:10:05,100
not sure I refuse just refuse

4463
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:11,260
is he pro is he probably looking to break bad

4464
03:10:12,860 --> 03:10:17,180
I don't know what the reaction is to that joke so I'll let you guys figure out

4465
03:10:17,180 --> 03:10:24,140
goldfills refuse that first then take the contract only to breach it how

4466
03:10:25,100 --> 03:10:32,300
I mean does it matter if he's you know

4467
03:10:36,140 --> 03:10:39,500
what is the conflict

4468
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:46,700
I'm married I mean does it is he married no the other person that's 19 show the

4469
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:50,940
conflict and then this is 2005

4470
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:58,620

4471
03:10:58,620 --> 03:11:02,380

03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:46,700
have to go at any point I'm gonna try and redirect into

4480
03:11:46,700 --> 03:11:51,820
emi and I don't think I'm gonna finish up this

4481
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:56,060
chapter and then I'll redirect into emi's ASMR video so you're all forced to

4482
03:11:56,060 --> 03:12:01,420
watch it and okay I'm very clearly messing this

4483
03:12:01,420 --> 03:12:04,220
up I think

4484
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:09,660
I think I'm messing it up I'm not actually sure

4485
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:15,180
what it wants me to do other than to like smack in

4486
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:18,540
all right

4487
03:12:18,700 --> 03:12:23,740
like warrior the web profile picture is obviously not a pug the birthday is

4488
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:30,220
obviously wrong he's not ancient the omnipresent interwebs no interest in

4489
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:35,660
interting like none of this is anything

4490
03:12:35,660 --> 03:12:37,980
hmm

4491
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:44,300

4496
03:13:06,940 --> 03:13:14,540
really you must be kidding I do not do Russian

4497
03:13:18,460 --> 03:13:25,580

4500
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:39,900

4501
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:43,420
mister don't tell me you've changed your

4502
03:13:43,420 --> 03:13:48,140

03:13:49,820 --> 03:13:54,220
uh no there's no

4504
03:13:55,020 --> 03:14:01,020
that's the only thing that's not important

4505
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:04,780
wait is it the same night of the bomber

4506
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:10,940

4507
03:14:10,940 --> 03:14:16,060
conversation you're working sure

4508
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:20,300
I'm sure it's so important to write down that she's working

4509
03:14:20,300 --> 03:14:24,700
I have truly so important call the fisherman

4510
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:28,860

cheer man exactly right I've done all the listener stuff

4512
03:14:32,780 --> 03:14:38,780
I've done all the insider stuff unless this is it which is really random if

4513
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:41,340
this is it

4514
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:49,180
I've been skipped school but they've been officially proved as a benefit I

4515
03:14:49,180 --> 03:14:51,820
guess that's good

4516
03:14:51,820 --> 03:14:58,140
is it okay you look some love and not full

4517
03:15:00,860 --> 03:15:06,780
I already claimed it in the waiting

4518
03:15:08,140 --> 03:15:16,700
ah whoever hmm system breviser he's cleared it

4519
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:26,060
pictures I've just checked mails let's just go to them again

4520
03:15:26,060 --> 03:15:31,340
financially trouble doesn't change a thing

4521
03:15:31,900 --> 03:15:35,660
okay sure he rejected a case

4522
03:15:36,380 --> 03:15:39,500
I already submitted the wedding poll because he was getting roasted on that

4523
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:45,100
fishing website for it like I'm not even kidding

4524
03:15:45,100 --> 03:15:47,580
he's married a conflict with another thing

4525
03:15:47,580 --> 03:15:51,100
this guy was like being really rude but I already submitted

4526
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:57,820
but the game was like almost sexual no no one cares

4527
03:15:57,820 --> 03:16:01,500
that's not got anything to do anything

4528
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:05,660
so feedback on your request

4529
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:09,020
I'm about to start shopping everything in the freaking

4530
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:14,060
thing right device offline I need to ask your favor

4531
03:16:14,060 --> 03:16:17,820
okay sure let's do the favor stuff

4532
03:16:19,260 --> 03:16:25,820
and the circle is complete well is it or

4533
03:16:26,540 --> 03:16:30,620
isn't it he may have supported the bomb bar

4534
03:16:30,620 --> 03:16:37,100
I don't know if that oh that was it oh crap hold on Harrison Harrison

4535
03:16:37,340 --> 03:16:42,140
hi wise ass anyone there

4536
03:16:45,340 --> 03:16:49,820
so you find your way here Harrison check his bank account and find out why he's

4537
03:16:49,820 --> 03:16:52,540
broke oh I forgot about that because we never found

4538
03:16:52,540 --> 03:16:55,900
digging through your timeline was a pain in the ass why didn't you just tell me

4539
03:16:55,900 --> 03:16:59,340
you wanted to chat when you told me what happened to me now I went

4540
03:16:59,340 --> 03:17:03,580
straight on to research I got the impression that the

4541
03:17:03,580 --> 03:17:09,100
government is up to no good great work captain obvious

4542
03:17:10,540 --> 03:17:14,940
I did find something something you won't like a bit

4543
03:17:17,900 --> 03:17:24,780
or well oh no he knows he knows he knows he knows

4544
03:17:27,820 --> 03:17:32,140
oh no we did everything to keep it outside of the nation

4545
03:17:32,140 --> 03:17:35,340
and now it's unfortunate people have become aware of it ahead of its time

4546
03:17:35,340 --> 03:17:40,860
we must tread very carefully we will not speak so openly any longer I fear

4547
03:17:41,420 --> 03:17:44,860
seems it's a system that can put everything on the web under surveillance

4548
03:17:44,860 --> 03:17:50,540
what do you mean everything in this every way maybe pcs whatever your bs in

4549
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:55,900
me I'm not man I'm not I wish I was

4550
03:17:55,980 --> 03:17:59,660
title drop he said the game name

4551
03:17:59,660 --> 03:18:02,860
that's the same for a secret how do you pull this off storage alone is one

4552
03:18:02,860 --> 03:18:04,860
thing that I've been going through all of it

4553
03:18:04,860 --> 03:18:09,020
the outsource surveillance to people outside the nation

4554
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:15,740
am I outside the nation oops those people are supposed to collect pieces of

4555
03:18:15,740 --> 03:18:19,020
data from websites all kinds of communication whatnot and send it to

4556
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:22,540
Orwell it's safe to assume that nothing is safe anymore

4557
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:26,380
wait so can I not report properly how come you never heard of it even more

4558
03:18:26,380 --> 03:18:29,820
importantly how come you have

4559
03:18:30,380 --> 03:18:34,140
uh I have very good connections to some hackers outside

4560
03:18:34,140 --> 03:18:40,380
the nation I don't know if I can report that or not

4561
03:18:40,380 --> 03:18:47,820
the new thing or two about secret I mean it's information

4562
03:18:49,500 --> 03:18:53,420
that spins what happened to Nina a real hacker now unfortunately we can't go

4563
03:18:53,420 --> 03:18:59,420
after people outside the nation so we don't even have the right to do it

4564
03:18:59,420 --> 03:19:03,100
do they have no decency no respect Harrison don't

4565
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:07,420
yeah this is everything we fought again you need to watch your tongue

4566
03:19:07,420 --> 03:19:12,860
oh is there about to say something I don't need to watch my tongue

4567
03:19:12,860 --> 03:19:17,500
it's already being what please chill out or we will regret it

4568
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:22,460
oh I'll never chill again unless this madness stops

4569
03:19:22,460 --> 03:19:26,860
I already got an idea Taylor made for you

4570
03:19:28,220 --> 03:19:31,660
man if you discuss things like this here you'll get us both locked up

4571
03:19:31,660 --> 03:19:34,700
let's meet somewhere then

4572
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:38,380
yeah and say the word and they'll be there in two

4573
03:19:38,380 --> 03:19:41,340
oh they'll be there too

4574
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:47,820
there must be something we can just talk without the possibility someone

4575
03:19:47,820 --> 03:19:51,500
snooping around we can't stand and do nothing

4576
03:19:51,500 --> 03:19:56,380
there's one thing it's a bit risky

4577
03:19:58,860 --> 03:20:02,540
are you using my chat till right now is this week well if I want to live in

4578
03:20:02,540 --> 03:20:05,980
life in a cage I go down in no so the system needs yeah

4579
03:20:05,980 --> 03:20:11,020
it's abominable but yeah um this tool has a bill inside for

4580
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:14,460
oh we're not going to be able to see it

4581
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:19,420
it's a custom encryption algorithm written by me easy to break but off

4582
03:20:19,420 --> 03:20:23,180
record and that's what we need they'll probably

4583
03:20:23,180 --> 03:20:26,780
kind of break this not right way give us a couple of messages probably what are

4584
03:20:26,780 --> 03:20:31,980
you waiting for go for it is it gonna work

4585
03:20:33,660 --> 03:20:37,900
I'll activate it now just remember to write quickly

4586
03:20:38,380 --> 03:20:44,300
and keep your fingers crossed it'll work oh it works

4587
03:20:52,060 --> 03:20:56,220
I'm getting reports of unknown don't worry Orwell should be able to break the

4588
03:20:56,220 --> 03:20:59,740
encryption in mere second

4589
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:04,140
I mean is it

4590
03:21:08,860 --> 03:21:13,820
I'm going to meet you in the coffee shop at three you wink wink

4591
03:21:13,820 --> 03:21:20,140
and before it's html encryption it could work oh it's already broke

4592
03:21:20,140 --> 03:21:23,660
I will need some time to localize the intro and then I'll only have second one

4593
03:21:23,660 --> 03:21:28,780
thing what will you do with what I find there

4594
03:21:31,340 --> 03:21:37,740
start a war on the government

4595
03:21:38,860 --> 03:21:43,900
is he actually going to do that or is the old gas no break

4596
03:21:44,460 --> 03:21:47,980
is the old breaks no gas

4597
03:21:51,100 --> 03:21:55,180
oh well okay fine oh shit they actually mean it okay uh

4598
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:57,980
time to get to work yeah we're gonna have to report that one chief and we'll

4599
03:21:57,980 --> 03:22:01,580
be honest if he wants a war well he shall have one we will

4600
03:22:01,580 --> 03:22:05,980
have mr odono rested long before I can obtain that

4601
03:22:05,980 --> 03:22:09,580
the national beholder just published oh best see for yourself

4602
03:22:09,580 --> 03:22:11,900
what

4603
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:21,900
how are they aware of the thought we never report I imagine you're looking

4604
03:22:21,900 --> 03:22:24,780
my way now aren't you I have absolutely no idea who leaked this info

4605
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:29,580
certainly not me only very few people can access the date on our back end this

4606
03:22:29,580 --> 03:22:36,140
doesn't exactly a dozen investigation quite the office that we need to hurry

4607
03:22:40,220 --> 03:22:43,420
freedom is unfree

4608
03:22:43,420 --> 03:22:47,260
oh no

4609
03:22:52,700 --> 03:22:59,820
oh no they're both kicking off are you doing

4610
03:23:00,380 --> 03:23:04,220
what's going on here right the bank reoccurring donation

4611
03:23:04,220 --> 03:23:09,660
oh naughty man naughty naughty naughty naughty

4612
03:23:09,660 --> 03:23:12,700
these look poles I've had enough of them

4613
03:23:12,780 --> 03:23:16,380
deliberately hard to get them to quietly when they're at the center of a

4614
03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:18,780
right haha so there may be something in connection between

4615
03:23:18,780 --> 03:23:22,380
Yosef and Nina after all if you can find one last

4616
03:23:22,380 --> 03:23:26,700
indication that this may be meant for Nina

4617
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:32,300
be enough to get custody

4618
03:23:34,380 --> 03:23:39,500
and say there what's going on here feedback on your request

4619
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:43,340
there then there's this reoccurring donation that's been going on I can

4620
03:23:43,340 --> 03:23:47,900
respect if you want to help out a friend or something

4621
03:23:47,900 --> 03:23:51,580
but we need a reply

4622
03:23:52,780 --> 03:23:58,140
the certificates issued outstanding ongoing

4623
03:24:00,380 --> 03:24:06,060
so tax evasion are helping out a pal what one is that

4624
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:10,860
excuse me for sending like these are major issues to see apart from the

4625
03:24:10,860 --> 03:24:13,340
number of clients drop on steadily your expense

4626
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:17,740
since the end when especially the credit card went up by a whopping

4627
03:24:17,740 --> 03:24:20,860
any idea the reason but you stopped at some point seriously

4628
03:24:20,860 --> 03:24:24,780
if all those expenses are a must well I would definitely agree with laying off

4629
03:24:24,780 --> 03:24:29,180
the person that's what I'm thinking it's a

4630
03:24:29,180 --> 03:24:34,380
not a real charity no there's no way he's sending money

4631
03:24:34,380 --> 03:24:43,100
to his pals not the certificate he's embezzling money

4632
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:51,180
oh that's what the payments are for yes oh no

4633
03:24:52,700 --> 03:24:57,900
oops I thought it was going to be obvious it's embezzlement

4634
03:24:57,900 --> 03:25:01,900
wait isn't it embezzlement

4635
03:25:02,860 --> 03:25:08,220
your entanglement about the immediate termination of work regarding

4636
03:25:08,220 --> 03:25:13,020
ah he got laid off you mentioned you've been participating in suspicious groups

4637
03:25:13,020 --> 03:25:17,980
and activities that's funny I think I'll submit that the wrong way around

4638
03:25:17,980 --> 03:25:23,580
we picked the wrong one sorry I submitted the wrong way around I'm sorry

4639
03:25:23,580 --> 03:25:28,860
I'm too slow IQ okay hey hey hey seems the government just fired the

4640
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:32,540
fresh shots our way seems so

4641
03:25:32,540 --> 03:25:35,340
I thought they might take longer to trace all back to thought I didn't expect

4642
03:25:35,340 --> 03:25:37,980
that it'd be openly right about it

4643
03:25:37,980 --> 03:25:40,460

just as I thought it couldn't get any worse yeah but

4649
03:26:04,140 --> 03:26:08,620
it was about new evidence in the officer's injury

4650
03:26:08,620 --> 03:26:13,420
not the bomb the look like the eucliness is heading her way

4651
03:26:13,420 --> 03:26:17,020

4680
03:28:23,740 --> 03:28:29,180
maybe the veal or collab actually where we get to look at pretty girl sorry I

4681
03:28:29,180 --> 03:28:31,900
just had to look at the news yes it's actually a bit weird a pretty harsh yes

4682
03:28:31,900 --> 03:28:36,300
but I made an interesting discovery that I need to talk to your

4683
03:28:36,300 --> 03:28:39,500
colleague Harrison yes I was just chatting I set up a conference colleague

4684
03:28:39,660 --> 03:28:43,260
that would be great a lot of reading give me a moment

4685
03:28:43,260 --> 03:28:47,020
honestly I was like oh let's play this game wait a minute I need to read

4686
03:28:47,020 --> 03:28:49,740

4687
03:28:49,740 --> 03:28:53,420

oh and then we're gonna go back to this one

4690
03:29:06,860 --> 03:29:10,460
got a face that we're known wait it's like huh you take me what Nina mentioned

4691
03:29:10,460 --> 03:29:13,820
the cops are wiretapping her calls why not chat I think the call is much more

4692
03:29:13,820 --> 03:29:17,900
appropriate for legal councils raises less arbors and chats might be logged

4693
03:29:17,900 --> 03:29:22,060
we're just the average couple seeking advice right couple we need to do this

4694
03:29:22,060 --> 03:29:24,620
don't speak too openly don't mention wiretaps okay

4695
03:29:24,620 --> 03:29:30,300
I'm like this alright right group call

4696
03:29:31,340 --> 03:29:34,540
she's not tired anymore she's something else

4697
03:29:34,540 --> 03:29:39,500
hey Yosef seems like this is working hello I'm Harrison I presume yes and

4698
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:46,300
you're the law guy he's a good girl let's meet

4699
03:29:46,300 --> 03:29:49,900
I just read about your group I guess this isn't exactly brightening things up

4700
03:29:49,900 --> 03:29:53,580
for you you could say that the rules here has big

4701
03:29:53,580 --> 03:29:56,860
faith in your skills Yosef here to elaborate on what you

4702
03:29:56,860 --> 03:30:01,180
found out yes okay so you all know the safety

4703
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:08,860
yes yeah all in all it's an aggregation of paragraphs to get people

4704
03:30:08,860 --> 03:30:14,060
behind bars is much more easily and prior in lives as necessary

4705
03:30:14,060 --> 03:30:17,180
no they use it as a sorry excuse for spying on people all the time

4706
03:30:17,180 --> 03:30:21,020
intimidating them yes I understand what's particularly dangerous about it for

4707
03:30:21,020 --> 03:30:24,620
you is that individuals might be prosecuted by mere indication of

4708
03:30:24,620 --> 03:30:28,140
threats to the nation in specific situations it will be

4709
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:31,900
more than enough to point at a word you said in a rage to consider

4710
03:30:31,900 --> 03:30:35,100
you dangerous that's enough to hold you in for some time

4711
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:39,020
but what's even more problematic for you is the so-called

4712
03:30:39,020 --> 03:30:44,940
a transivity of indication the what you all form a group an activist group this

4713
03:30:44,940 --> 03:30:47,740
links you to one another now if there was sufficient

4714
03:30:47,740 --> 03:30:51,580
indication that say Abraham created thought to commit crimes

4715
03:30:51,580 --> 03:30:54,860
or even acts of terrorism well they have grounds to arrest you all

4716
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:58,780
but we didn't do anything how is this just this is so

4717
03:30:58,780 --> 03:31:02,220
freaking outrageous they'll twist and turn their so-called evidence until they

4718
03:31:02,220 --> 03:31:06,940
get what they need you will need to be very very careful from no one

4719
03:31:06,940 --> 03:31:11,260
we can do something about this right we need explicit evidence showing

4720
03:31:11,260 --> 03:31:15,420
Abraham created this group to be peaceful prove it beyond any doubt

4721
03:31:15,420 --> 03:31:18,700
this is why I need to ask you about Abraham to find out his original

4722
03:31:18,700 --> 03:31:22,220
intentions well ask away the two of us were friends for a

4723
03:31:22,220 --> 03:31:26,220
while but I never got the feeling he told me a lot about what was going on in

4724
03:31:26,220 --> 03:31:30,940
his life he was reclusive indeed that's what he was like

4725
03:31:30,940 --> 03:31:35,980
except when he was around thought how was thought formed he found out about me

4726
03:31:35,980 --> 03:31:40,140
by discovering my blog said he wanted to start a debate club

4727
03:31:40,140 --> 03:31:43,420
I said fine we had a couple of lame meetings nothing much happened

4728
03:31:43,420 --> 03:31:46,700
a debate club then that would be good that could

4729
03:31:46,700 --> 03:31:52,380
hardly be regarded as a terrorist asset uh yes but Abe was obsessed with getting

4730
03:31:52,380 --> 03:31:57,660
his message out make people aware what the government was doing

4731
03:31:57,660 --> 03:32:03,740
right that's kind of a given right anti-government and you go

4732
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:11,100
then we went with so it was Nina why and we know why and we know why don't we

4733
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:15,340
he wanted to get out of the contract of illness but the government said no

4734
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:20,540
so as we said Nina oh god stop stop telling me everything Jesus

4735
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:26,300
right Nina thought of the protest so it was miss

4736
03:32:26,300 --> 03:32:30,860
November the mall yeah during the studies I met Abraham online by chance

4737
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:34,460
he motivated me to take his course

4738
03:32:34,460 --> 03:32:40,300
hold on more vigilio right then jules took over with the planning for the two

4739
03:32:40,300 --> 03:32:48,140
protests okay you false intention the bad planning causes you

4740
03:32:48,140 --> 03:32:53,020
Nina me each and every one of us is guilty of deviating from the intention

4741
03:32:53,020 --> 03:32:56,380
jules you don't know what you're talking about it was Nina she neglected

4742
03:32:56,380 --> 03:32:59,980
Nina was pretty violent I'm gonna be honest like I kind of feel like Nina was

4743
03:32:59,980 --> 03:33:05,020
the violent one cause I think it was that one

4744
03:33:05,100 --> 03:33:09,420
sorry but Nina literally reached for a

4745
03:33:09,420 --> 03:33:13,260
a pew pew I'm not sure if I'm willing to believe this is really contradictory

4746
03:33:13,260 --> 03:33:17,500
to what Abraham wanted if so wait didn't he not bomb him on purpose

4747
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:21,260
no he said they went too far if so why are we doing the same

4748
03:33:21,260 --> 03:33:24,140
okay he's gone we don't know where and we don't know how to reach him

4749
03:33:24,140 --> 03:33:27,420
sadly oh well I will need to get back to writing some emails

4750
03:33:27,420 --> 03:33:29,980
of course I understand jesus I'll get back to you I suppose it was going to

4751
03:33:29,980 --> 03:33:33,580
benefit you too well because Sandra is removed from custody yes goodbye

4752
03:33:33,660 --> 03:33:38,220
yes thanks don't mention it and use your quit well the lawyer wasn't too helpful

4753
03:33:38,220 --> 03:33:41,100
come on give a rest this is a complicated situation yes so what's

4754
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:45,020
nice I suggest we meet somewhere in town

4755
03:33:46,300 --> 03:33:49,980

4756
03:33:52,220 --> 03:33:58,300
oh and jules the old meeting place on jules what the band location

4757
03:33:58,300 --> 03:34:02,460
must be the band location something important to them shame they didn't say

4758
03:34:02,460 --> 03:34:06,540
but resting item is out of the question we don't have enough evidence

4759
03:34:06,540 --> 03:34:12,140
right give me the band because that's clearly a band thing where's the band

4760
03:34:12,140 --> 03:34:19,580
the targets I know for a fact it'll be one of the locations here

4761
03:34:21,020 --> 03:34:28,780
yikes come on it has to be a location here I don't believe it otherwise

4762
03:34:28,780 --> 03:34:33,180
give us an address don't be shy okay maybe be a little bit shy hold on I'm

4763
03:34:33,180 --> 03:34:37,340
being dumb I'm going the wrong way freedom is unfree

4764
03:34:37,340 --> 03:34:40,860
your thoughts are free

4765
03:34:43,100 --> 03:34:48,700
oh there's like tons of more comments I hope you guys get what you deserve

4766
03:34:48,700 --> 03:34:53,820
we want you out mfers

4767
03:34:53,980 --> 03:35:00,060
ooh the location they used to hook up at his trailer

4768
03:35:02,620 --> 03:35:06,620
oh my god this is giving me like nothing right he said he was gonna send more

4769
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:09,500
emails right

4770
03:35:10,220 --> 03:35:14,780
is there more emails nope

4771
03:35:14,860 --> 03:35:20,140
what if you put it in the bin for me to look at why yes of course make it super

4772
03:35:20,140 --> 03:35:24,940
easy for me african to say there's one thing here

4773
03:35:24,940 --> 03:35:29,500
I'll just shove it in because it's cluttering it says I can interact with

4774
03:35:29,500 --> 03:35:32,140
it go

4775
03:35:32,220 --> 03:35:34,940
okay we don't really care but it's that we better go

4776
03:35:34,940 --> 03:35:40,060
so strange financial troubles and large donations don't go hand in hand

4777
03:35:41,020 --> 03:35:47,740
right what did I miss in the dialogue

4778
03:35:47,740 --> 03:35:53,820
he got fired that's not really a big deal is it is it might oh maybe it is

4779
03:35:53,820 --> 03:35:58,620
because I literally have no other leads whatsoever

4780
03:35:58,620 --> 03:36:05,020
um I literally have no other lead I'm gonna just start spamming stuff in

4781
03:36:05,020 --> 03:36:10,620
the intimate moment

4782
03:36:10,620 --> 03:36:16,780
am I supposed to where is that located intimate moment

4783
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:21,340
intimate moment

4784
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:35,340
must be between them way back down here

4785
03:36:40,220 --> 03:36:43,900
yeah no idea okay all of us are looking at each other right now

4786
03:36:43,900 --> 03:36:47,900
and a room of me and refling all of us are looking at each other for an answer

4787
03:36:47,900 --> 03:36:51,660
right why does this keep saying it's blue

4788
03:36:51,660 --> 03:36:55,420
whatever is blue I'm ignoring it because we keep saying I can interact with

4789
03:36:55,420 --> 03:36:58,620
something when I can't

4790
03:37:03,820 --> 03:37:09,820
okay no one cares literally no one cares

4791
03:37:14,860 --> 03:37:17,340
how

4792
03:37:18,940 --> 03:37:22,140
what did I miss

4793
03:37:25,260 --> 03:37:30,940
okay that's fine jose is a planner we figured that out

4794
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:35,340
what was their favorite places to go to I don't know but I can't like pull it up

4795
03:37:35,340 --> 03:37:39,340
or find it to show that Harrison has been involved

4796
03:37:39,340 --> 03:37:43,820
but since we know that uh plan Nina planned the first

4797
03:37:43,820 --> 03:37:47,180
there's now leaves no room for him did we make a mistake

4798
03:37:47,180 --> 03:37:50,780
yeah I might not let them make a mistake Mr. Goldfield seems quite the

4799
03:37:50,780 --> 03:37:54,780
charmer look all these people gathered around them

4800
03:37:55,340 --> 03:37:58,540
oh we got something here

4801
03:37:59,820 --> 03:38:03,100
campus life juuuuusy

4802
03:38:03,100 --> 03:38:08,700
Charles had a new portrait so I got a notebook for my studying

03:52:13,900 --> 03:52:16,860
i think i'm completely messed up this game um

4970
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:24,380
oopsie he wants he wants to know what they know and the answer is everything

4971
03:52:24,380 --> 03:52:27,820
but you already know where he lives you're snitching on your own co-workers

4972
03:52:27,820 --> 03:52:30,140
oops like it was an accident i didn't mean it

4973
03:52:32,060 --> 03:52:36,300
i'll put that fake picture of him perishing up because why not

4974
03:52:41,100 --> 03:52:44,060
wait so if he's away you know driving home to work

4975
03:52:47,740 --> 03:52:49,740

4976
03:52:52,060 --> 03:52:53,340
oh wait it's the end of the day

4977
03:52:58,780 --> 03:53:00,700
it's the end of the day day four

4978
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:07,340
oh but we've only got one more episode to go i'm pretty sure we might as well there

4979
03:53:15,420 --> 03:53:22,780
no don you did it oh his identity was personal information was exposed

4980
03:53:23,420 --> 03:53:31,820
who did that oh no who did that benjamin oh dear i didn't understand my actions

4981
03:53:33,740 --> 03:53:37,980
okay we're on the can someone look up of episode five's the last one i think there's

4982
03:53:37,980 --> 03:53:45,900
only five chapters to this game oh good morning invest dear justice i was an accident okay it's

4983
03:53:45,900 --> 03:53:52,700
all the pugs fall i don't know what i was doing good morning investigator since you have the most

4984
03:53:52,700 --> 03:53:57,580
powerful investigation to let your disposal i suspect you already know who i am not really

4985
03:53:57,580 --> 03:54:02,220
you on the other hand have been mediocre so far you could not save them all but you could

4986
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:07,420
you at least got the prime suspect you will do better i will be your new advisor in this case

4987
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:14,860
this has become far too important to leave the case with to an advisor with an exposed identity

4988
03:54:14,860 --> 03:54:19,900
same as well but no longer fit to work on orwell moving forward we will not speak about him again

4989
03:54:19,900 --> 03:54:26,620
as far as your concern he never existed on you with yesterday's reveal of orwell sympathizers

4990
03:54:26,620 --> 03:54:31,900
for this group have taken to the streets we need to show all of the nation orwell is keeping them

4991
03:54:31,900 --> 03:54:38,700
safe we won't allow some fools to trample on everything we chew we must get rid of the imposter

4992
03:54:38,700 --> 03:54:43,660
pretending to be abraham find out who did it and where they are hiding

4993
03:54:46,380 --> 03:54:51,740
the game orwell has a total of two seasons keeping an eye on you the first season has five okay so

4994
03:54:51,740 --> 03:54:57,500
we are in the last one where the headlines house of exposed government employee vandalize

4995
03:54:58,060 --> 03:55:00,140
i hope he's alive are you squinting me right now

4996
03:55:01,900 --> 03:55:08,140
slice safer thank you for supporting me for a month please don't snitch on us to the high

4997
03:55:08,140 --> 03:55:16,380
table we'll do anything yeah you'll do anything i bet you will i say i bet you will i'll make you

4999
03:55:28,220 --> 03:55:28,940
that's time

5000
03:55:31,100 --> 03:55:38,300
anti orwell protesters gather at the freedom memorial oh no wait a minute are we taking

5001
03:55:38,300 --> 03:55:43,660
down the surveillance i might have accidentally exposed him but i'm kind of getting what i want

5002
03:55:43,660 --> 03:55:50,860
negotiations renewed really i don't think anyone cares about you're bluffing

5003
03:55:51,580 --> 03:55:57,660
yeah members of thought my dear friends as you've all experienced today we're already besieged

5004
03:55:57,660 --> 03:56:02,700
by the government they have denounced us called us terrorists and turned the public against us

5005
03:56:02,700 --> 03:56:06,780
this will stop their day is about to come to an end i have a plan but for this to work we must

5006
03:56:06,780 --> 03:56:12,700
meet like we did the old ways when we had our meetings and cafe chestnut oh no that's actually in

5007
03:56:12,700 --> 03:56:19,980
the book the chestnut cafes in the book we will have a conference called 4 p.m because i'm well aware

5008
03:56:19,980 --> 03:56:24,940
the meeting in person won't work you will you need not fear surveillance always been taken

5009
03:56:24,940 --> 03:56:36,300
careful care of how am i supposed to report that or do i want them to like i kind of want them to

5010
03:56:36,300 --> 03:56:45,900
survive though um kind of want them to i mean this is the only lead i have so sure you didn't

5011
03:56:46,140 --> 03:56:51,820
just showed him what had been exposed and that was important a gathering we know abraham

5012
03:56:51,820 --> 03:56:56,060
is passed away someone must be imperative this is clearest crystal we must act swiftly and

5013
03:56:56,060 --> 03:57:03,260
collect as much evidence as possible for gathering commences this is certainly no good as you know

5014
03:57:03,260 --> 03:57:10,060
processing data chunks and it's time i would say we have rough time for roughly 20

5015
03:57:10,220 --> 03:57:14,220
oh no

5016
03:57:21,020 --> 03:57:25,900
okay you must think i'm sure first you don't want to tell me we've won wait up i want to take them down

5017
03:57:30,300 --> 03:57:33,500
i want to take them down though wait had to hold on

5018
03:57:33,500 --> 03:57:41,500
i had to take them down they'll not need to like

5019
03:57:47,420 --> 03:57:49,500
the 10 command no that's rosentick

5020
03:57:51,180 --> 03:57:56,860

pug profile picture was a throw you can't upload pug profile pictures anymore yeah

5023
03:58:07,740 --> 03:58:10,540
i want to take them down like i'm that's who i'm talking to

5024
03:58:11,580 --> 03:58:16,140
hmm i don't think maybe i need to like throw some stuff out anything

5025
03:58:16,860 --> 03:58:25,340
okay okay we'll just do ghost them i saw you yesterday that's confirmation

5026
03:58:27,100 --> 03:58:32,380
they said don't fear the upload though so doesn't even matter what i do related document found

5027
03:58:32,380 --> 03:58:35,580
this is where harrison did his thought we're probably thinking we won't be able to track him

5028
03:58:35,580 --> 03:58:40,300
down we will track him down i've gone through the information we have on the remaining suspects

5029
03:58:40,300 --> 03:58:45,820
regarding the impersonation of abraham we have received information from a reliable source that

5030
03:58:45,820 --> 03:58:52,060
odonal is probably the leader of thought odonal predicted the bomb but this alone makes him suss

5031
03:58:52,060 --> 03:58:56,780
we have no idea why odonal hid the post on the thought blog on his timeline we are yet to

5032
03:58:56,780 --> 03:59:03,340
clarify why odonal would frequent a bomb a drugstore often perhaps for the materials

5033
03:59:04,060 --> 03:59:08,940
why would odonal have two health insurances it's apparent that harrison odonal might as well

5034
03:59:08,940 --> 03:59:13,340
i don't think it's him he is probably the one impersonating him i want you to prove this and

5035
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:19,500
lock him away for good i don't think it's him i can be honest with you chief lobby

5113
04:07:17,580 --> 04:07:21,020

5196
04:16:35,900 --> 04:16:42,460
let's have one comment about ghost and like and it's useless it must be something on the computer

or a check it says the picture of his mum is that why he's taken down big pharma

5198
04:16:49,980 --> 04:16:53,660

5199
04:16:54,060 --> 04:16:55,660
do

5200
04:16:58,860 --> 04:17:01,660
update the number to jules

5201
04:17:03,980 --> 04:17:06,540

scoop her phone from contacts give me give me cassie's phone

5206
04:17:29,180 --> 04:17:30,780

5209
04:17:47,980 --> 04:17:51,900

a band is it back on the band

5212
04:18:06,140 --> 04:18:13,100
we're putting the band back together bad ending um i'm getting the bad end i'm

5213
04:18:13,100 --> 04:18:16,620
getting the failed ending where i had nothing because i don't know what we've been

5214
04:18:16,620 --> 04:18:20,380
10 top blood cat pictures just for the last few honestly i might

5215
04:18:25,660 --> 04:18:27,900
this get in touch the tank commander

5216
04:18:30,780 --> 04:18:34,060
on that website that shows the owner

5217
04:18:36,540 --> 04:18:38,060
because it had that lady on it

5218
04:18:38,780 --> 04:18:44,700
not our family the other one it was like

5219
04:18:47,740 --> 04:18:56,220
people her she's in it you you this you it's something to do with her it has to be

5220
04:18:57,740 --> 04:19:01,260
but literally nothing is getting like highly either opened or

5221
04:19:01,580 --> 04:19:10,140
anything i'm just getting roll let's say i can old like add old numbers i've submitted the location

5222
04:19:13,580 --> 04:19:19,500
i've already submitted so i don't i think i just submit any old pitch now you know that

5223
04:19:21,420 --> 04:19:27,260
oh no he's not oh sorry mommy i'm no coming home tonight sorry oh that's okay bad one

5225
04:19:34,300 --> 04:19:38,220
let's just submit whatever it does not matter at this point i don't know what i'm doing

5226
04:19:39,180 --> 04:19:42,940
and maybe it'll make more sense to make if we have like another attempt

5227
04:19:46,300 --> 04:19:50,620
but right now my brain it's almost 4 p.m almost like to have one more time for an upload make

5228
04:19:50,620 --> 04:20:00,140
sure it counts oh i'll make sure an upload counts all right um how about we do

5229
04:20:03,100 --> 04:20:04,300
is there even anything

5230
04:20:07,020 --> 04:20:10,940
there's not one thing okay it must be in this pc that can submit or

5231
04:20:11,980 --> 04:20:16,460
there let's do this most useless piece of information like a puzzle get you and me

5232
04:20:16,460 --> 04:20:19,180
we're done yeah very important

5233
04:20:22,620 --> 04:20:25,500
i am not particularly interested in the love life of a terrorist

5234
04:20:26,380 --> 04:20:30,540
it's 4 p.m i'm getting intervention teams ready to check all the locations

5235
04:20:30,540 --> 04:20:34,140

5236
04:20:36,380 --> 04:20:37,900
we they hacked them

5237
04:20:38,860 --> 04:20:45,500
oh no what happens if they delete the whole system oh no

5238
04:20:47,900 --> 04:20:50,060

5245
04:21:22,380 --> 04:21:28,540
what magic trick he pulled off but it worked jossie this is great i am not quite sure what

5246
04:21:28,540 --> 04:21:36,940
i'm doing here but i am here as well joseph great oh joseph joseph great you're there holy crap

5247
04:21:39,660 --> 04:21:47,660
what is this who are you a fool who is baffled by the madness he just witnessed otherwise initiate

5248
04:21:48,380 --> 04:21:53,340
well i'm glad you decided to join us that's completely unintended what do you mean you're

5249
04:21:53,340 --> 04:22:01,100
in the call aren't you yeah i'm also in orwell in orwell aib sent me an ip address to get into

5250
04:22:01,100 --> 04:22:07,980
orwell it makes hacking the damn thing incredibly easy you did what and that worked like a charm

5251
04:22:07,980 --> 04:22:13,740
i now kind of control the damn thing it's really really worrying come again you have orwell on a

5252
04:22:13,740 --> 04:22:19,020
freaking leash great how does that worry you my control is limited and the government will get

5253
04:22:19,020 --> 04:22:24,540
the control back at some point but this isn't my primary concern what makes me nervous is why

5254
04:22:24,540 --> 04:22:30,140
would abraham have such extensive knowledge of orwell this whole thing reeks of an enormous trap

5255
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:36,700
abled betray us no he wouldn't but you're right something very strange as a foot we should get

5256
04:22:36,700 --> 04:22:42,540
out right now and this is the point where it gets even worse i had a quick look at his file

5257
04:22:43,420 --> 04:22:50,540
you would not believe what it says he's dead abraham is dead yeah he died quite some time ago

5258
04:22:51,100 --> 04:22:56,620
what that's impossible i thought that when we he first disappeared but i put it to the back

5259
04:22:56,620 --> 04:23:05,020
of my mind what became of him dead no abraham how he was very sick answer oh so that was real

5260
04:23:05,020 --> 04:23:10,700
oh you old fool we couldn't tell us he gave nina the orders for the bomba after his demise

5261
04:23:11,180 --> 04:23:18,060
this means this means someone has been setting her up real bad and not only

5262
04:23:19,500 --> 04:23:26,540
her all of us who the f would do such a thing i'm not getting info on who or why

5263
04:23:27,420 --> 04:23:36,620
what a pity but it does prove my point wait what do you mean jules it was me i set you up what

5264
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:43,500
jules you wait a sec i can't believe where this is going are you for real right now are you

5265
04:23:43,500 --> 04:23:49,420
are you telling me you told nina to place those bombas i did i'm not proud of it but i had to be

5266
04:23:49,420 --> 04:23:55,180
it had to be done what the heck why you and nina youtube ruined everything for abraham

5267
04:23:55,180 --> 04:24:01,420
and for thought so you decided that leaving me wasn't enough for revenge you had to bomb innocent

5268
04:24:01,420 --> 04:24:07,340
people and blame it on thought it was necessary only when things are at their darkest will people

5269
04:24:07,340 --> 04:24:13,900
listen take note and actually enact change he knew that i know it was extreme extreme extremist

5270
04:24:13,900 --> 04:24:23,820
murder i know believe me i know you are the reason i was in custody how could you do that to me

5271
04:24:24,860 --> 04:24:28,700
thought needed to be destroyed that was the whole point instead of seeking me out and

5272
04:24:29,420 --> 04:24:34,700
labelled you all target persons and investigated you all screwed up your lives people need to see

5273
04:24:34,700 --> 04:24:40,380
how messed up orwell is it's not protection it's invasive and manipulation doom for everyone

5274
04:24:40,380 --> 04:24:45,660
note if no one is innocent everyone is a suspect abe wanted to make the world stand up against

5275
04:24:45,660 --> 04:24:50,860
orwell he knew how dangerous project word that's why he worked on it he did what he worked on it

5276
04:24:51,580 --> 04:24:56,460
this confirms what i feared but i didn't want to believe it if so he could have gone to the

5277
04:24:56,780 --> 04:25:01,740
media and taken it all public couldn't he he was afraid he thought nothing would ever change

5278
04:25:01,740 --> 04:25:10,220
if he did can you blame him he told me everything and told only me damn oh funny i just realized

5279
04:25:10,220 --> 04:25:14,380
you're actually much better yet much worse activists than nina or me could have ever been

5280
04:25:14,380 --> 04:25:21,580
that's admirable in a strange mess up way you're nothing but a biatch julia a killer a liar

5281
04:25:21,660 --> 04:25:27,580
cassie i oh just shut up shut up just shut up shut up this is madness julia first cassie then

5282
04:25:27,580 --> 04:25:33,340
you pulled me into this all those people who suffered at your hand i still don't get it why draw

5283
04:25:33,340 --> 04:25:38,300
all of this attention on thought you didn't convince anyone by your actions why this

5284
04:25:38,300 --> 04:25:43,500
gathering why let me hack orwell i needed to convince just one person have faulty orwell is

5285
04:25:44,140 --> 04:25:49,660
cause again the guy harry leaked information about was the man on the inside only an advisor

5286
04:25:49,660 --> 04:25:54,060
the person who was really been spying on you still around the person who actually went through

5287
04:25:54,060 --> 04:25:59,420
your stuff passed on the day of the one listening right now the investigator that's me that's right

5288
04:25:59,420 --> 04:26:03,580
i'm talking to you i knew you had to be around where everyone would come together you had to

5289
04:26:03,580 --> 04:26:08,700
be listening initiate was just a win for a chance to make sure you'd not immediately go up against

5290
04:26:08,700 --> 04:26:14,220
those investigator i have a question for you now that you saw orwell firsthand do you really think

5291
04:26:14,220 --> 04:26:19,100
that the system will help anyone do you think the government would not spy on you as well

5292
04:26:19,100 --> 04:26:24,460
did you think you were outside the system think again they evaluate even you even you

5293
04:26:24,460 --> 04:26:30,620
that he saw the madness they observe even you the investigators but we can stop it you can

5294
04:26:30,620 --> 04:26:36,700
remember you became recruited for being outside of the system outside the nation what if we show

5295
04:26:36,700 --> 04:26:42,620
people what they store about you that even you are not outside this as we're about to get docs

5296
04:26:42,620 --> 04:26:46,860
because it's one of those meta games that show your ip address all you need to do investigators

5297
04:26:46,860 --> 04:26:52,220
upload the data they have on you incriminating yourself this is so mind-bogglingly stupid

5298
04:26:52,220 --> 04:26:56,620
jewels why would the investigator the government will come after that's exactly the point the

5299
04:26:56,620 --> 04:27:02,620
evaluation is supposed to be a safety net so that no one misuses orwell active acting on

5300
04:27:02,620 --> 04:27:08,620
evidence is mandatory if the investigator criminates himself they'll be forced to prosecute them and

5301
04:27:08,620 --> 04:27:14,220
reveal this evidence that the investigators are actually being spied on this is absolutely mad i

5302
04:27:14,220 --> 04:27:20,380
do not see this working i would love to offer an alternative investigator it just so happens that

5303
04:27:20,380 --> 04:27:25,740
a certain catherine dilla qua is in these files too i say we make use of the fact we have control

5304
04:27:25,740 --> 04:27:31,420
on over orwell let's use as a weapon and turn it against the government there's all there's

5305
04:27:31,420 --> 04:27:36,780
something dirty to be found about her for sure let's act on that now we're talking no hurting won't

5306
04:27:36,780 --> 04:27:42,220
help much she's just gonna get replaced this isn't the right way like i said jules just shut it nobody's

5307
04:27:42,220 --> 04:27:47,420
interested in what you have to say but how can we trust this investigation what what the heck

5308
04:27:48,540 --> 04:27:57,740
how did they find harrison what's going on oh no seems he just fell prey to the surveillance

5309
04:27:57,740 --> 04:28:05,900
system oh shit we need to act fast i ratted him him out let me all show you what i can see right

5310
04:28:05,900 --> 04:28:15,660
now here streams up here's kassandra's file well this feels like a slap in my face they have been

5311
04:28:15,660 --> 04:28:22,380
collecting all of this they got me flagged potentially dangerous it was this investigator oh

5312
04:28:22,380 --> 04:28:27,980
don't be mad hen no i can't trust that person i'm out use of your turn my turn

5313
04:28:27,980 --> 04:28:37,100
hmm oh no what's funny about your file it says here you were offered a release of kassandra

5314
04:28:37,100 --> 04:28:43,660
for info on thought and you agreed especially given the fact what just happened to harrison

5315
04:28:44,300 --> 04:28:49,580
damn yes i did i got the offer and i reported harrison i had to kassandra would not have been

5316
04:28:49,580 --> 04:28:57,580
released otherwise oh it's all falling apart i can't believe this this is horrible but then again

5317
04:28:57,580 --> 04:29:04,860
you did it for me i don't know what to think merde kass i'm sorry for harry i can't take this

5318
04:29:04,860 --> 04:29:12,780
anymore leave me out of all of this oh she's gone kassie wait you've got to do this without me i'm

5319
04:29:12,780 --> 04:29:20,380
sorry user quit well this is just great see how we've messed up all this is is exactly what we

5320
04:29:20,380 --> 04:29:26,380
need to show the people show them how we've been affected get them to fight with us i shall speak

5321
04:29:26,380 --> 04:29:34,940
on behalf of nina then nina's popped her clogs i only realize now i might have been my fault nina

5322
04:29:34,940 --> 04:29:40,300
got investigated in the first place oops but it's all clear the investigator is responsible for hunting

5323
04:29:40,300 --> 04:29:45,260
her down like this look it was i didn't they chased her to death oh they caused her death no doubt

5324
04:29:45,260 --> 04:29:49,900
perhaps investigator didn't know any better and we know nina was gilly it does not strengthen my

5325
04:29:49,900 --> 04:29:56,860
trust though but then the investigator arrested harrison no no we cannot trust such a person

5326
04:29:56,860 --> 04:30:03,500
meaning the final verdict is oh is he out not a single vote to trust the investigator oh

5327
04:30:03,500 --> 04:30:10,380
i'm getting sniped are we finally gonna do this my way it's down to the two of us it seems well

5328
04:30:10,380 --> 04:30:15,740
my plan to gather support for you failed investigator but if you still want to fulfill my plan go on

5329
04:30:15,740 --> 04:30:21,180
and give delacrox hell you will find something dirty investigators time to make up your mind

5330
04:30:21,180 --> 04:30:27,340
you can tear down the entire system just complete my plan please i will turn delacrox into a target

5331
04:30:27,340 --> 04:30:33,180
person i think i can easily activate access to a pc for you as well what

5332
04:30:35,260 --> 04:30:41,340
hoisin it's hacramen when abraham stopped his work for rosentech and the government he cloned

5333
04:30:41,500 --> 04:30:46,060
all information he had and hid it in the office he told me and i maintained that the system is

5334
04:30:46,060 --> 04:30:50,700
programmed to boot itself again in a couple of minutes you'll have access to everything you just

5335
04:30:50,700 --> 04:30:55,820
need to find the uid of the device i cannot tell you here now that orwell isn't tracking data

5336
04:30:55,820 --> 04:31:02,700
junk i feel understanding if you judge and incriminate me for what i've done i think i deserve it

5337
04:31:02,700 --> 04:31:08,860
it's up to you now investigator do the right thing right how do we destroy it finally i thought the

5338
04:31:08,860 --> 04:31:15,420
disturbance would never end the back end engineer said we've had an unwanted guess we already know

5339
04:31:15,420 --> 04:31:20,460
it was thought it's about time we undo them we must be strong we must show these people for what

5340
04:31:20,460 --> 04:31:24,780
they are the nation's safety depends on it finally waiting to incriminate them together as group all

5341
04:31:24,780 --> 04:31:29,980
we need is a hint that abraham intended this group to carry out acts we could trace the attacks back

5342
04:31:29,980 --> 04:31:33,660
to a remote pc it will now manually unlock the pc for you

5343
04:31:38,940 --> 04:31:41,100
destroy delacrox

5344
04:31:41,980 --> 04:32:01,020

04:42:27,740 --> 04:42:34,780
demurge i command you to no longer dig around abraham's path i could easily turn you into

5434
04:42:34,780 --> 04:42:41,820
a target person for disobeying me you would not want that would you what what is strange though

5435
04:42:41,820 --> 04:42:48,060
is that parenting requested material in this demurge it doesn't matter focus on undoing thought

5436
04:42:48,060 --> 04:42:59,740
as a whole uh i abraham developed this codex for a project named demurge which has been renamed

5437
04:42:59,740 --> 04:43:10,780
orwell and i have proof of everything we've got his pc oh so now you know it yes i hired him for

5438
04:43:10,780 --> 04:43:15,260
orwell this is his doing it was me who wanted him on the project in the first place to get

5439
04:43:15,260 --> 04:43:22,780
things right with orwell to follow ethical standards only very few people knew here knew that and i wanted

5440
04:43:22,780 --> 04:43:29,100
to make sure it stayed that way our most ferocious enemy worked for us a person i choose now you

5441
04:43:29,100 --> 04:43:34,460

5442
04:43:34,460 --> 04:43:41,820
chose to do i warned you this will have consequences i've uncovered the truth riefling no

5443
04:43:45,420 --> 04:43:46,380

04:44:43,260 --> 04:44:49,740

5452
04:44:53,500 --> 04:44:59,420

5455
04:45:12,220 --> 04:45:16,780
stairs of the profile picture and how security

5456
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:28,220
person of interest uh targeted persons appear to make things even worse interest third human

5457
04:45:28,220 --> 04:45:34,460
element is being evaluated to oversee the call evaluation so wait why is that the wrong profile

5458
04:45:36,140 --> 04:45:39,820
it's me i'm being evaluated

5459
04:45:42,060 --> 04:45:46,700
reefing no you need to be careful you will surely understand human elements are prone to me so

5460
04:45:46,700 --> 04:45:53,020

5463
04:46:08,620 --> 04:46:14,700
oh my god i know this might upset that we tracked your progress but we need to feel safe

5464
04:46:16,060 --> 04:46:19,900
we could not just deliver random people to operate it without a backup i mean we need

5465
04:46:19,900 --> 04:46:26,860
something in place in the event okay i'm doing it rating trustworthy

5466
04:46:27,260 --> 04:46:30,700

5468
04:46:39,660 --> 04:46:47,500

5469
04:46:48,220 --> 04:46:52,140

it's like we're looping the background sounds

5476
04:47:56,940 --> 04:48:02,780
possibly trying to evade prosecution what continues

5477
04:48:03,420 --> 04:48:05,420

04:55:46,700 --> 04:55:50,300
full confidence that was a meme um

5547
04:55:54,700 --> 04:55:58,460

04:55:58,460 --> 04:56:02,780
and still haven't got i was unsure if i should ask you or call them uh uwu market handle other

5549
04:56:02,780 --> 04:56:07,660
thing but they make things custom order they don't waste like it's not like they do a big batch of

5550
04:56:07,660 --> 04:56:13,580
something um they make it like custom order so it does take a bit longer check your email

5553
04:56:22,380 --> 04:56:26,380
make everything custom order like i ordered my keychains i'm still waiting for them to come

5554

5605
05:01:43,580 --> 05:01:51,340
near otomathia and it's very strange sometimes it has an interesting perspective on humanity it's

5606
05:01:51,340 --> 05:01:56,380
an action game but some of the stories told might tickle your pickle it takes around 20 hours to

5607
05:01:56,380 --> 05:02:00,860
complete so is that two endurance rooms you're asking for back to back don't mind if i don't

5611
05:02:24,780 --> 05:02:30,780
definitely tickles there you totally know her for the content is her name like to be i think

5612
05:02:30,780 --> 05:02:37,580
to be or not to be near it's four endings and needs like four placers no no i can't do that

5613
05:02:37,580 --> 05:02:45,740
i'm no cut out for that okay um probably dumb question but does the meta tag basically mean

5614
05:02:45,740 --> 05:02:55,020
that in the audio you the narrator are strongy meta tag means yes i'm strongy in that moment and

5615
05:02:55,020 --> 05:03:01,500
you're reefing in that moment meta means like so you know when i'm like oh the asmr booth or something

5616
05:03:01,500 --> 05:03:07,100
like that or like it's related to me being like a streamer towards you or that kind of meta behind

5617
05:03:07,660 --> 05:03:14,140
does that make sense hopefully that makes sense um she does have a really nice dumpy though

5618
05:03:14,140 --> 05:03:19,500
four main endings and 22 troll ones wait no there's no like fake i was wearing the tinfoil

5619
05:03:19,500 --> 05:03:26,220
hat skews thing over thanks i didn't edit it myself reeflings did it i just i just yanked it yanked

5620
05:03:26,220 --> 05:03:32,300
me now your tinfoil hat tell in his it's terrible sorry i'll just look in this direction even though

5621
05:03:32,300 --> 05:03:37,420
i can't see chat at all in this direction i'm just gonna i'm just gonna look oh i can look at you

5622
05:03:37,420 --> 05:03:43,500
at the corner of my eye hi there's an ending for each letter in the alphabet is that a joke

5623
05:03:44,060 --> 05:03:49,900
or is that real okay i'm looking at you from the corner of my eye to make the hats sit properly

5624
05:03:49,900 --> 05:03:56,140
okay all right reefing ah meta equals strongy strongy not character so you know how like i can be

5625
05:03:56,140 --> 05:04:05,740
like oh a giantess just absolutely swallows you whole like that's roughly but if it's meta it's me

5626
05:04:06,620 --> 05:04:12,780
you know does that make sense a girl love it's real but they're really joke endings and

5627
05:04:12,780 --> 05:04:16,940
anything between them right away okay okay you literally you're giving us a side item

5628
