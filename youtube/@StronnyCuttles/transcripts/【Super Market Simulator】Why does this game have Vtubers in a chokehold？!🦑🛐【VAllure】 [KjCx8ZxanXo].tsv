2445040	2452120	little guy I pay taxes did you know that when you're fucking when you know when
2452120	2458160	supermarkets prompt you to donate don't ever do it they claim that as their
2458160	2462440	taxes because they get a tax rebate on a donation and they put it against the
2462440	2468040	taxes they should be paying but because they're a freaking conglomerate thank you
2468040	2472080	for supporting a small business do appreciate you oh oh big order thank

2482400	2490080	tax loopholes so whenever fast food joint that is massive or a supermarket
2490080	2495480	that is massive goes would you like to donate to the starving children no but
2495480	2499600	not for that reason okay you're allowed to donate in general but not via the
2499600	2506120	supermarket because they use it as a freaking tax rebate okay so don't don't
2506120	2511320	support via the supermarket if you want to support in general that's fine but
2511320	2515400	say now let them kids starve they're literally guilt-tripping you let them
2515400	2524680	motherfuckers yes if you really wanted to donate to directly to charity but the
2524680	2527760	biggest way I think the biggest way you can help out the community is

2728780	2733820	How much is a fridge? Furnit your... shelves?
2734540	2739420	A display fridge? A fridge single. Another $200?
2740540	2744060	Oh that's quite a tall order, sorry. But like, look at my... how...
2745020	2749900	I'm to get a fridge on flour alone. Good morning. Please tell me you don't want anything out of the...
2750700	2754940	Okay, that's fine. You're allowed pasta. I... I give you permission to have pasta.
2756620	2758940	Thank you for your custom. Here's a dollar change.
2758940	2766940	I don't sell cheese! There's no indication of cheese being sold in the shop.
2767980	2774060	You're not allowed to ask for products, ma'am, that we don't sell. Miss, get back here. I will fistfight
2774060	2779500	you in the back in the parking lot. Get back here. We don't sell cheese. There's no indication we
2779500	2783980	should be selling cheese. Do you know what my license is? Are you the person I bought the
2783980	2791180	freaking license from? Relax. It's not that serious. It honestly isn't. Oh, I can't even find the cheese.
2791180	2795420	Yeah, nay, shite. There's nay fucking fridges. Of course there's nay cheese. Do you know how hot
2795420	2798780	it is outside? Like, honestly, the whole world doesn't revolve around you, ma'am.
2800300	2805260	Strong behavior. I didn't know... I didn't know they were allowed to be demanding, like,
2805260	2808700	oh, but she could sell cheese. Now, it'd be different if they were like, oh, I can't wait
2808780	2815180	for you to expand to sell cheese, but oh, there's nay cheese. Of course there's nay cheese. Are you
2815180	2820940	gonna pay for the fridge? It's 200 quid. I've not got 200 quid via flour sales unless you want to,
2820940	2825660	like, open up a bakery and use me as your supply chain. Sure, you can complain then,
2825660	2831740	but are you freaking kidding me? Like, honestly, that absolute cheek of some folk.
2833420	2837980	Good afternoon, sir. Sorry about that outburst. I was just talking to my co-worker on the headset.
2837980	2844940	I promise I wasn't having a random mental health breakout burst. Right, we are gonna need more
2844940	2851020	products. Just shove anything in here. Right, we can't sell cheese because everything needs water.
2851020	2862060	Eh, I need a shelf apparently. No, not right now! Okay. Could you imagine a customer and we're just
2862060	2868620	going, you can take your money back by right-clicking on the bills on the cash register. Oh, did I make
2868620	2875340	a mistake? I don't know. Change a dollar. Did I make a mistake? Couldn't find the sliced bread.
2875340	2884620	Yeah, because I don't sell it! Jeez. Jeez, you guys are like so needy, honestly. Right, bread?
2885420	2893260	You want bread? What, you want cereal? Cereal's $41? Oh my lord, I don't have that kind of money.
2895740	2902140	Oh my god, I need to hire someone else to do the machines, honestly. Insufficient change.
2903260	2911660	How do I put it back? Put it back. Put it back. Close checkout, approve. Back. How do I put it back? Oh no.
2912620	2921340	What? What do you need? Giving $7? Right, hold on. Let me do it like this. Sorry, sorry. Hold on.
2921340	2926860	Bink, won't bink. Okay, sorry. I hadn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Couldn't find the milk. Fond de la bosom.
2929020	2934300	Tomato tomato. Just, just enjoy the stock for what it's worth, honestly. I ain't got time. I don't have
2934300	2939500	time. I need to hire someone else to do this. Reflens, will you come work in a convenience store
2939500	2944540	with me? I need your help. I don't have time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The cheese. Why is
2944540	2949580	everyone addicted to cheese? I thought you were all lactose intolerant by like 50% of the nation
2949580	2955820	become, who knocked over my packages? I thought everyone becomes lactose intolerant like so quickly.
2955820	2960860	Okay, drop. Just shove it on the floor. Good afternoon. Hello, thank you for your custom.
2960860	2965820	You would like $2 change. Oh, here it is. Thank you, veiler lover for the extended membership. Just
2965820	2972140	imagine these are needy reeflings waiting for your next audio, honestly. Everyone like excited
2972140	2978860	for the next audio and then it's me with a dick. Oh, everyone was like absolutely like, oh, so
2978860	2984780	disappointed. Oh, thank you for the exact change, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Who is knocking over
2984780	2994700	my packages? Please don't do that. Can I restock? No, I put it on the bottom shelf. I suck. No,
2994780	2999260	I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Gee, shove
2999260	3007740	on the floor. Hello. Good afternoon. Bing, bing, bing. All yours. All yours, baby. I'm restocking
3007740	3013500	whilst on the job. I'm actually so good at this. Sorry. I'm such a good multitasker. Did you know
3013500	3018700	that it is a common misconception that women can multitask more, but actually it's just practice
3018700	3023740	behavior because yeah, you can't, I don't sell tea. I didn't know they could be so cheeky and ask
3023740	3028620	for stuff I didn't even sell, honestly. I've got nothing but the cheek you lot do, honestly,
3028620	3032540	honestly, honestly. I'm on to you. I'm on to you. Didn't think I'm on to you. Sorry, I need to clean
3032540	3037100	up the storage. Excuse me, sir. Sorry, just a moment. Just a moment. Can you run in this game?
3037100	3041100	That'd be really helpful. Don't ding that bell. Don't ding the bell on the register. I'm just
3041100	3048540	about to be there. Please give me a second. Thank you. Buy a boh here. I bet him buy a boh here.
3048540	3052540	I know you couldn't find the bottled water because it's in a package that you'll never know about.
3054140	3054460	No.
3059580	3066780	I'm just buying everything. Okay. I'm here and the lights are getting Friday nights and the lights
3066780	3076300	are low. Hold on. I need to put the lights on. It's so dark, my lady. That audio is not my cup
3076300	3081260	of tea, but I'm still gonna listen to it. Are you even though you don't like it? Thank you.
3081900	3086780	It's not for everyone. It's not for everyone, but I do have some outrageous
3086780	3091660	audios coming out soon. Thank you, Broly Legend for the tip and for giving it a shot. I mean,
3091660	3095980	some people are like, so they're like, I would never listen to this. It's disgusting. I'm like,
3095980	3100780	bro, relax. I'm literally pretending to have a willy. It's not that serious.
3102780	3107260	What do you mean you don't want me to clap your cheeks? If reeflings come work for you,
3107420	3112460	you require good benefits. You can't provide those right? Winking face.
3113420	3119740	What kinds of benefits would you like anonymous is the question? I mean, there's not as long as
3119740	3128140	you don't report it to HR. There's not much that I'm not happy with, you know? $9, $5, 1, 1, 1, 1. Boom.
3129660	3135580	If I read cheese one more time, I'm gonna shove cheese up someone's arse.
3137420	3141340	Let's just very quickly purchase all this shit and then I can put it on the shelves.
3143660	3147660	Oh, no, let's stay open because there's a customer. Open.
3150300	3153580	I was anything but disappointed with the latest audio,
3153580	3159740	Mama. In fact, I was elated that I had the house to myself so I could use my new figureine to it.
3160300	3163660	No. My figureine died, though, and I have to try again another day.
3164380	3164860	No.
3167820	3169020	Your figure died?
3169020	3175900	I would love to work in your store, Mama. I'll handle the heavy packages as long as you handle my heavy package.
3176620	3180860	You don't even have to pay me. I just want to ogle at my little seed.
3182220	3185820	Okay, that was actually really good. I'll give you that. That was really good.
3186780	3190780	God, some late night shoppers, huh? Burning the midday oil. Go home.
3191980	3200700	Jeez. Oh my. What? How? It must be because they're spawning around the corner.
3202300	3206620	Jeez, you guys don't love your families? My goodness. Thank you so much. Anonymous.
3207900	3213580	I have really weak wrists and hands, so unironically, I will take that help. I'm so freaking weak.
3213660	3218780	I'm a weakling, okay? I'm a weakling. A weak little seaweed. It's shocking behavior.
3220540	3225180	The Rizzler. Thank you. Orvon Biscuit as well. How did it die is my question.
3227340	3236300	And what? How did it die? It's got a... Not that word. It's got a battery in it. Is that my question?
3237260	3245180	What was that meme that it's like, oh, so a woman can have a d-d-d-d-d-9000, but if I have a d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-x
3245180	3251180	elemental pee, I'm the weird one. What is that meme that has just reminded me of that meme? I can't
3251180	3255500	remember it though. Family who sent them to the corner. Oh my god, my mom used to send me the
3255500	3259740	corner shop to get cigarettes all the time. Actually, I will say one thing about the Belgians.
3260460	3265500	You guys are so nice, because I didn't have my ID in this Belgian lady. Let me buy cigarettes.
3265500	3269020	And she was like, you look too young. And I'm like, hee hee, but I'm from Scotland though.
3270300	3273180	I was like, I'm from Scotland, so no one's going to get you in trouble.
3273820	3277740	And like, I literally started speaking to her and I was like, yeah, I don't speak Dutch. I'm not
3277740	3287660	from here. I literally just need cigarettes. Smile. Thank you, Maycule, for becoming a member. I
3287660	3294060	appreciate it. I'm sorry for butchering your name. Please forgive me. Right, tomorrow we can purchase
3294060	3299900	the fridge. So our beloved package of, that's just, that's being chilling in the corner. Right,
3299900	3305340	we can have cheese tomorrow. Okay, let's go to bed. Oh wait, no, do we have bills?
3307180	3315820	Alone? No, we're not taking out a loan. We hate the banks. Oh my god, 67 cents. Wait, every day
3315820	3324700	it's gonna cost me 20 bucks. Judy, that's rough. I don't make 70 bucks on every purchase. Right,
3324700	3333820	new name, new date. Stop, I'm getting ready to write that plot. Stop, you're getting me ready
3333820	3337740	to write that plot. Oh, don't think I won't do it. Don't think I won't write that plot. That's
3337740	3341740	absolutely hilarious. Oh, I like a little guard as well. I don't even notice I've got a little guard
3341740	3347900	to protect me from the customers from this side. I will literally thank you for the tip and honest.
3347900	3352940	I will write that. Please don't think I won. I'm literally, I love like freaking plots that we do
3352940	3358540	together. It's my favorite thing. This woman truly will do it. Do it, you won't know boss. Shake bag
3358540	3366060	if you didn't. Shake bag if you didn't. Don't throw it at us with a good time. Hello, any customers?
3366060	3373420	Are you my first customer? Actually, I've never even, we must be in New York because those things
3373420	3379580	like the fire exit things always look like they're from New York. Oh, we have a customer. Are you
3379580	3387820	squidding me right now? Hi, mama. I just tuned in. I just wanted to say you stole my heart during
3387820	3394060	yesterday's stream when you read my morrow before you logged off. Turning on your hypno eyes and
3394060	3399580	talking about control was so unbelievably hot. Now I really want to ink in your clown.
3401980	3405180	I mean, I can make something like that. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, honestly, I can.
3405180	3410780	Don't think I won. Yes, it had a battery. I thought it would work better than the unpowered ones I
3410780	3415420	tried in the past, but didn't find enjoyable using them by myself. Oh, we're getting a live review.
3415420	3418300	I need mommy's help to enjoy my cheeks being clapped.
3420220	3422940	That is terrible. Amazing. Thank you.
3427340	3430300	Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous and out of on biscuit.
3432060	3438540	No, so obviously, I can't really make anything and I can't record new ASMR until my dad goes away,
3438540	3442540	but he goes away next week. I'm actually going to be so depressed. So don't be surprised when I
3443340	3447180	when I stream and for like 12 hours, and then I'm like, I don't want to go offline because
3447180	3451420	I don't want to be sad in my emotions the moment I go offline because like I'm never sad when I'm
3451420	3457820	like streaming to you. And like I'm always happy like just like having the time of my life. So I
3457820	3462300	just know I'm going to be so depressed, but I'm happy on stream. But as soon as I end stream,
3462300	3468300	like it's literally going to be that meme where it's like with the music, like I'm not going to
3468860	3472860	I'm not going to be having a good time next week, but you guys will make it that have a good time.
3474140	3479100	And you know, I know you guys will make a good time. So I need just as needed as we fling.
3479900	3483420	I mean, I think that's why we work so well together. We fling. I mean,
3483420	3488140	you know, you don't report me to HR. We do some things in the break room, you know,
3489020	3493740	I don't report you for something, something, something, something, something.
3494300	3498700	I am happy to help you in the shop. And as payment all I ask is that you give me some
3498700	3503980	cream like you did in the recent order. Honestly, do you want some creamer for your
3503980	3509980	coffee in the morning at my supermarket? We'll call it. What would we call it? Oh, you can't rename
3509980	3519660	it. Oh, I thought what is city gates? City gates. Um, I what would we name the shop though? If we
3519660	3527180	had one. Squid ink. A dollar for you, madam. Thank you for your custom. Right. We're at 100
3527180	3533900	bucks. We just need a few more sales, please. Squirts. You want, you want this supermarket
3533900	3545020	to be called squirts? Oh no, this can't be. You can see ink. Coldstone creamery. I'm not sure
3545020	3551820	we're going to get a wave. Although, can we make one of those cringy American ads? Jones, barbecue
3551820	3559260	foot massage. And then our version is like, uh, Strone and Reflings, Inc. Emporium or something
3559260	3566700	like that. I don't know what we'd call it. Ink mark. Well, like ink mark. Strone and Reflings,
3566700	3574380	ink mark. Come on down to get your things. Come on down to get your things. We're anti-capitalist,
3574380	3579980	but we still have to participate in society. But it's okay because our prices are lower than
3579980	3589740	the monopolies. That's our theme song. It's like the worst jingle you could imagine. And everyone's
3589740	3599500	like, why did they put ads into this? This is awful. Honestly. Thank you. Oil, oil, oil. I know
3599580	3605660	you Americans like your oil. Take it. Take all my oil. Right, $137. We're almost there. Thank you
3605660	3615820	for your purchases. $17. Oh, nope. I almost messed up so bad. Sir, you have no idea how much I
3615820	3620540	about overcharged you. You're so welcome. I was on it. Are you squidding me right now? You charged
3620540	3627020	him $0.09? Hi, Mama. I remembered you once said that Reflings are able to hypno you just like
3627020	3633340	you can hypno us. Yes. Can you teach us how? A mind broken straw knee would be amazing to see,
3633340	3639020	to see our cheeky little less get addicted to Reflings ink. I'm already addicted to,
3639020	3642460	you only send a man of marshmallows. I demand marshmallows.
3645820	3652460	So technically you can hypnotize me at any time, but in my head, I've done it that you prefer to do
3652460	3658300	it via a mirror because you like when I do it to myself, like it's more satisfying for you
3658300	3662460	that way. I'm not going to run out of freaking things. Thank you for the hypno.
3663900	3669580	Top tier servicing. No matter how big or small, we work until you're satisfied.
3671660	3675020	And I don't think the work is talking about the average nine of five.
3675420	3686780	Call it ink and drink. Thank you. Lars the dude for the tip. Yeah, I'm not convinced you're talking
3686780	3691900	about the average nine to five work. I think we're talking about another kind of work. You know what
3691900	3704860	I'm saying? How's the weather in Australia? Are you okay Reflings? Did you get a little
3704860	3711900	nervous typing that out? Thank you for letting me pop your super cherry. Oh, no, no, you're,
3711900	3715900	I said that wrong. I said that wrong. Sorry. Other me. Thank you for letting me pop your
3715900	3721740	super cherry. No, you're super cherry. I'm so sorry. That sounded like an insult. I didn't mean
3721740	3736060	it like that. It's winter. So it's cold. It's cold. Okay, eight dollars. Did that charge anything
3736060	3739660	for that? Did I just let you walk out for free? I think I did. I think I messed that up.
3741100	3748140	Your mega chair, your super mega cherry is main boy. You're not getting away from me that easily.
3752540	3757420	Right. Okay, we're done. We can buy a fridge. I assume I can buy a fridge or do I need to do it in
3757420	3765020	the morning? Here is the fridge. A mini fridge. Okay. Oh crap. I have to do it in the morning.
3767660	3770220	We'll also add a product into it. What are we missing?
3772860	3779100	Oh my God, please. You're welcome to buy anything you like. Buy everything. Yes, yes. Okay, I'll
3779100	3784140	take it. Three items are better than one. You know what I'm saying? Thank you for your custom. I
3784140	3791340	couldn't find sushi, even cheese. How come you didn't mention that you can speak French? Because I
3791340	3798140	can't. I can say like one or two sentences and I can throw stuff together. It's pretty much it.
3798780	3805660	I can't actually speak French. I can say like, oh, je voudrais, you know, tabit. I can ask for
3805660	3813180	your cock. I can ask for your horse in French. To say butt in French, you say cool. Thank you,
3813180	3818860	dindle shit, 500. What a name for the super chat, by the way. You're super chat cherry.
3820300	3823420	Yeah, to say your butt, you say mon cul. Are you squiddling me right now?
3824940	3830620	So, Strani, if we already have the capability to hypno you, does that mean we can turn on mind
3830780	3836540	broken Strani whenever we want? Do we snap our fingers? Say a certain phrase?
3837580	3842860	Um, so if you've ever looked, ah, you know what? I'll show you. This is my loading screen. Look at
3842860	3846860	you in the loading screen. Oh wait, this is my ending screen. I know you can still hear me in this,
3846860	3856380	but yeah, you can. See how you're on my head right now in here? Wait for it. Wait for it.
3856460	3866140	Look at you. Look at you on the top of my head. Ready, steady. We both have hypnosis.
3866140	3872860	Look, you have the hair thing like I do. Yeah, you got the little hair thing,
3872860	3879580	little hypnotic thing. Yeah, it's real. That's you. You can do that to me and I can do it to you.
3880460	3884620	I forgot which gaming thing I was on. Like I'm on this one. Oh, where's my game?
3886940	3894060	Well, we're not doing that again. That was scary, please. That scared me. Right,
3894060	3900140	we've got a fridge and we've got 13 bucks so we can order bread and then tomorrow we can purchase it.
3900140	3906540	Okay, and it's only $2 for delivery. That's fantastic. Closed. New day. New day. Right,
3906540	3912540	we're going to very quick. Products found expensive, so is, but no from the, not from around here,
3912540	3921580	partner, not from around here. Right, hold on. Give me the fridge right now. It's a fridge. Oh my
3921580	3933580	head, rotate with mouse wheel. Okay, can I slot you right here? Oh my god. Display is full. Wait,
3933580	3941420	the fridge is tiny. She said she was 12. Sorry, I said it like that. Hold on. Open. No, draft.
3943500	3947740	Some products went down in price but you didn't follow. How dare they? They're making,
3947740	3951580	they're making a mockery of me. They're making a mockery. Right, I only have two dollars. Right,
3951580	3958140	let's set a price for the water. Water. Market price is $2.13, so we'll do two bucks. What are you?
3960220	3964700	We need to lower the oil. Of course, I invest in tons of oil in the games like, yeah, we're
3964700	3969180	going to just artificially lower the price. Right, bread's up at four bucks. Yeah, nine.
3969340	3975180	What's flour? Okay, flour's fine. Flour's fine, don't worry about it. Okay, hydration check,
3975180	3986940	reeflings. Hydration check. Hydration.
3987180	4001340	I'm gonna burp okay. Open your mouth, reefling. Open wide. All yours, baby. Good boy for opening
4001340	4006860	your mouth. It's fucking disgusting. That's actually disgusting. You know what, you know what
4006860	4011500	the worst part is when I do something like that, like a gag like that? Oh, hit me on one.
4011500	4016460	Hi, I'm a first-time customer for this establishment and I was wondering if you
4016460	4022380	sold any exotic items. Maybe a dog, collar, and bowl. Sound familiar, Stronny?
4024220	4030300	Okay, if you didn't know, I may or may not have an alternative Twitter account, okay,
4030300	4038460	and I may or may not have purchased a collar. Oh, give me that back. Oh, you know what,
4038460	4045500	fuck it, you can have it for free. Thanks for your custom. I may or may not have bought a dog
4045500	4051660	bowl and a dog collar with your name on it because you own me. So some people were like,
4051660	4061420	oh, you need to put like Stronny on it. But if you own me, I should technically have your name
4061500	4072300	on me. So I have a bowl coming with your name on it. And that's, I don't know if the collar's
4072300	4077340	going to say property of refling or just refling. I hope it says property of refling because I'm
4077340	4084300	going to come so fucking hard whenever I, you guys are getting the audio where you can literally
4084300	4090620	hear it like jingling on my chest. Or maybe I should put it on and then you can hear me put it on.
4091900	4099420	I like it. Bit bread, bit bread, a little dollar change for you ma'am. Stronny, what? No, Ms. Mano,
4099420	4107260	you're not supposed to be here. Ms. Mano, Ms. Mano, I'm just, I'm confessing, Ms. Mano, I'm confessing.
4108300	4115500	The accuser, purchase a new section in your computer. I heard all that. No, Ms. Mano,
4115580	4121500	that's even more embarrassing. Oh, I'm just gonna, I need to expand growth.
4133020	4141900	I could probably change it. I have enough time. Did I goof? Shit. Did I mess that up? Am I supposed
4141900	4152220	to be strong on it? Am I that brain dead? The answer, yes. I unknowingly pulled up to the freaky
4152220	4158540	store apparently. Stop. No, this is Squid Mart. Welcome to Squid Mart where all your needs are
4158540	4167900	met. Are you okay? Ma'am? Oh my God, is she okay? Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am? What do you need?
4168540	4171420	Are you being assigned? I think she's been assigned something on the shelf.
4172700	4180300	I'll help the AI. Don't worry, I'm here. Oh, oh, she, I didn't know they had, you know,
4180300	4185100	crackheads in this game. That's terrible. Do not use such derogatory terms for people who are
4185980	4191020	afflicted with the older addiction. That's terrible. I don't think she's feeling that good,
4191020	4201660	I'm gonna be honest. Oh, my needs, go on. Can't make up her mind. Thank you, tiny spiny for the
4202460	4206860	tip. Okay, I will get that changed. There's more than enough time. I promise there's more than
4206860	4211900	enough because I only just did it. So I'm sure I can like change it because it gets custom made and
4211900	4215740	they had like a big warning that was like, oh, you need to give us like plenty of time.
4221100	4228060	And vitamins to ensure our inks of THR best quality and potency. You only get two days a month after
4228060	4236700	all. Squid mark for all your inking needs. Not you guys learning. Oh, reluctantly saying that was
4236700	4243180	such a good bit. I love that. Not you guys learning about ovulation. Thanks to me. Oh, are you guys
4243180	4249020	okay? God, there's two now. What have I done wrong? I'm not sure what I've done wrong, if I'm being
4249020	4253660	honest. Right, the light's going on now. So this place isn't freaking dark. And you just put it on
4253660	4261580	all the time. Damn, you and Belgan called it. She's undecided on what's a better product.
4261580	4265420	Bro, they're literally, I don't, the AI is having a hard time with the oil right now.
4266060	4273020	I'm not really sure why. Come on, AI. Look at them heels though, heels. Oh, and they put in
4273020	4277740	height differences. Honestly, this has been quite a decent bit of, considering this is early access,
4278380	4284860	I mean, I would say it's pretty polished. Am I, am I going crazy? I know I shouldn't encourage,
4285500	4297580	but if it's not like a mega-cabillion thingy, I don't think it's actually a bad rate. If you
4297580	4303980	two, are you two, can you get out of me right now? Don't listen to them. I like property of
4303980	4308780	reefling on the collar. I can imagine giving it a little tug and pull you in for a deep,
4308780	4315260	passionate kiss and a hard spank to your cuttlefish arse. Be a good little pet for me, strongy.
4315260	4319580	Are you squiddin' me right now? Right, well, I get two versions. I can get two versions. No cheese,
4319580	4327660	one star review. Stop. I'm working on the cheese, okay? A customer's out the, you guys weren't there
4328620	4335500	for ages. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I can't read chat. Oh, no, no. Fuck it. Take it. Take the change.
4335500	4340940	You're welcome. Oh, you're going to complain after I give you extra change? Go away. Thank you so much.
4340940	4351420	Red flame kraadin. Kraadin? Where are you from? Kraadin. Red flame kraadin. What? Why do I think
4351420	4354540	you're European? That's right. I've sussed you out. I'm coming to your house. What are you going to
4354540	4360700	do about it? I can just shortchange that person. You're selling a product without... Oh, and you
4360700	4366060	would buy four of them. I've not set the price. Oh, jeez. How do you do this? Oh my god. Oh my god.
4366060	4370220	I've not set the price. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese.
4370220	4374940	I've not set the price. Cheese. Three bucks. Go. Of course you'd buy the fucking cheese.
4377180	4383740	I've not set the price. Your mum, yeah? Customer Greg? No way your name is actually
4383740	4388860	customer Greg. Please tell me you changed that to do that super chat. Is your name actually
4388860	4397820	customer Greg? That's your online handle. That's hilarious. Thank you for your one star review.
4397820	4402620	I'm trying my best, okay? Couldn't find the black... That's what I think about you, honestly. I'm fucking
4402620	4407820	getting tired of this shit. Everyone's so needy for a product I don't sell and they should have no
4407820	4417660	indication that I freaking sell it, honestly. Snowberries. Skippity. Why did you put on skippity?
4417660	4426140	That's going to be stuck in my head now. No, don't type that. Hi, snowberries. How is acicle stream?
4426140	4432700	Was she having fun with you? Was she tormenting you? Was she teasing you? Was she pleasing you?
4433420	4439580	That's what I like to hear. How could this delicious brat be so
4441180	4450860	gorgeous? Yeah, actually it's the other way around to do. I think the tormenting was the other way
4450860	4458300	around. You tormenting my precious little acicle? How dare you? Unless she likes it and that's
4458300	4465980	different. Well, there's cars in this game. I mean, in all honesty, what do they have to do
4468380	4476540	to polish off this game? I mean, the method seems to work of the shop. Am I going crazy
4476540	4480060	and saying that this game really isn't that bad? Storage? I'm not going to bother with that. Just
4480060	4485260	seems like $800 for nothing. I don't know. Maybe it comes more... Is this a staff room?
4485260	4490860	Unironically, is this a toilet? This is where me and the reeflings go after a long day.
4493580	4498540	It's just a helping hand. It's levitating. Look at that PC. What are the specs?
4499260	4505660	There's a 1080 inside that for ordering stuff? Why do businesses get all the tax rebates? Why
4505660	4510140	can't I like an average show? I was in the snowys earlier and I came over here when your stream
4511100	4517580	started because I haven't seen a second of a velar stream before today. Oh, no. Oh, no. You picked
4517580	4523900	the worst. Don't start with me. Start with anyone else in velar. I'm the worst fucking choice to start
4523900	4528780	your velar experience with because I'm wildly inappropriate at all times. Are you squinting
4528780	4533580	me right now? Wildly inappropriate at all times. Since you seemed so excited about the property
4533580	4539340	of reeflings part, maybe the caller can say that and the bowl has your name so you know it's your
4539340	4545420	bowl that we let you use when you're hungry for ink. Either way, it's about what gets you going more.
4547740	4556300	I think, why is it 55 bucks for that? Better be a big moneymaker. I think we're gonna get both.
4556300	4561340	You're super wholesome. Oh, yeah. I'm the one of the few Americans who can understand the Scottish
4561340	4569420	accent. Like, I'm very lucky that you guys can understand it, but I do confess you're not gonna
4569420	4580620	like this part reefling. I purposefully annunciate more. I'm sorry. I do. It's just a tooth. Oh,
4580620	4585340	shit. I hate when I do that honestly. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, that was a lot of product.
4585340	4592220	Do you sell puppy tails? I need the plug type in three different training sizes. My cuttlefish
4592220	4596380	puppy girl is getting uppity and needs some correction via banal training.
4600300	4607020	Okay, I may actually be buying that soon as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I'm going to be
4607020	4615980	buying that soon. I need a new one. Okay, I need a new one. Thank you Anonymous for the tip and
4615980	4622300	thank you Zarian as well. I might be getting that product. All right, I didn't want to be outrageous,
4622300	4627820	but I kind of want to show you guys all the things I want to buy in like a week's time,
4627820	4632460	but it's going to be really bad. Like, it's going to be really fucking bad. Excuse me, Ms.
4632460	4639100	where do you keep the cucumbers and the lube? Why you ask for no reason? I'm sure. Hold on,
4639100	4649660	Anonymous. I'm sure I've seen that meme that is like by bomb bombs, by a cucumber and by lube and
4649660	4655820	then look the cashier dead in the eyes while you do it. Are you squinting me right now? For no particular
4656300	4662940	reason. Does this mean Stronny will be getting a tail soon? To go with the collar, we need to make
4662940	4668140	sure the collar is nice and tight around her neck so you can always feel like reeflings are
4668140	4672140	gripping your throat and telling you to behave. Are you squinting me right now? I'm trying to do
4672140	4676380	my job here, not get away. What the fuck's going on? Hi, Stronny just wanted to let you know I walk
4676380	4681980	my dog every day, but it makes me sad because I wish it was in his tent. Oh my god. I'm going to need
4681980	4687900	a slippery caution, slippery one wet sign on the floor in a minute. What the fuck? We're not getting
4687900	4693820	sued, okay? We're not getting sued because someone had a little fumble. I'm not having it. Whoa, what
4693820	4698060	did I just give you? Ten bucks? Okay, that was really lucky. I still don't know how to retract
4698060	4703820	the money. I've yet to figure it out. Stronny, if you put them on throne, would be happy to buy it
4703820	4711820	for you? Oh, I don't know. I find it so hard to accept gifts like that. I don't know.
4712940	4718940	Like, I don't mind buying it. Am I weird for considering you're fairly normal and wholesome?
4718940	4725580	I mean, for the most part, you know, we've been chaining, don't you mind? I don't think, um,
4726700	4731980	flower is too expensive. I'm so sorry. My flower does not reflect today's prices. No, it does not
4731980	4739500	get aim. Two dollars for the flower. I apologize, my good sir. All yours, no change. Thank you for
4739500	4748540	your exact card. Yes, 19 dollars. Awesome degeneracy is what my wife and I call it,
4748540	4753740	honestly. Stronny with a short color refill. Well, I have a short color stream coming up
4753740	4758940	very quickly. So basically, there's going to be multiple streams for a little while.
4761660	4769180	So don't be surprised if some of them are outrageous. I'm literally going to have to explain
4769180	4775900	to my dad that I'm doing a ring fit stream. So whatever he overhears, if he is awake, he is to
4775900	4784620	ignore because I'm going to be like a bus of ass. I have not exercised since debut. No, I am not
4784620	4790780	exaggerating. Bro, I'm getting you stuck in, man. Give me a chance to have some freaking stock. Right,
4790780	4797420	we need more stock of something. I don't know what yet. Cheese, milk, dark roast coffee is how
4798220	4803260	right. We'll get eggs as well. We've not had eggs. I'm getting a variety. I promise I'm getting
4803260	4809580	a variety. I promise. This puppy cuttlefish is going to need a muzzle to keep her quiet when
4809580	4818700	reeflings breed her like a bitch in heat. I'm at my job and you're in my earpiece telling me these
4818700	4822700	kinds of things. How am I supposed to look these customers in the eye and say have a good day?
4822860	4829820	I am trembling. I am quaking at this till right now. I'm trying my hardest to focus.
4831500	4837180	I am trying my hardest to focus and I'm quaking right now. It must be placed in a fridge. Okay,
4837180	4843580	that's fine. Oh my god, that is so sad. Pop that there because I want to make sure,
4844540	4849020	I want to make sure, okay. Mummy, now you know how all the reeflings who listen to you at work
4849580	4853660	still, it's still my favorite thing. Sorry, I'm making an audio for it. I don't care. I'm sorry.
4853660	4858140	I'm sorry. I don't care. I need to make an audio for it. I need you. I have a matey.
4858140	4866300	Don't buy the coffee. I've not set the price. Nine dollars. That's a big profit. Three dollars
4866300	4874940	per unit sold. I'm doing it right now. Whoa, this is our biggest freaking thing ever. Thank you.
4875900	4883660	Thirty two dollars. The pleasure is all mine. I assure you the pleasure is all mine. Why is
4883660	4890780	of course. Cheeky dollar change. All yours sir. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa. Okay, let's get that
4890780	4895340	light on. I can already see it getting dark. Don't think I don't know your games. Not again.
4896540	4901180	Why are they struggling? Are you squiddin' me right now? With a pathing. What's the problem? The next
4901260	4908380	day, still no cheese. No, no, no, no. Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. Okay, cheese, cheese, cheese. Boom.
4908380	4913020	Cheese is in the cart. Cheese, cheese is in the front door. Freeze, cheese is in the front door.
4913020	4916700	Oh my God, what are you talking about? I have no idea. Customer Greg, I have absolutely no idea what
4916700	4921740	you're talking about, my good sir. Look at that. You even have two shelves of cheese. Your claims
4921740	4928060	of not having cheese, unfounded customer Greg. How dare you? Completely unfounded. I have absolutely
4928060	4934700	no, your accusations against my store. I ask you instantly to remove your one-star review and a
4934700	4942300	trip advisor to my freaking supermarket. It is unfounded and it is damaging the sales
4942300	4946940	and my profit margins. Change, no change, exact change. Thank you, good sir. Couldn't find the
4946940	4951020	cereal. Yeah, you're right. You can't find the cereal. You want to know why? Because there's
4951020	4955900	none in stock. Boom. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know what you
4955900	4961980	mean. Thank you, customer Greg. And thank you Anonymous for all the tips. You guys are playing
4961980	4969020	with fire because the efficiency of the gameplay is about to severely go down if you keep this up.
4969020	4974780	Okay, card. Yes, $19. Thank you, good sir. All yours. Oh, thank you for your costume. No,
4974780	4980620	appreciate it. Your change. $50, $20. Go. Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you. Cheese. Yes,
4980620	4985020	cheese. Take the cheese. There's customer Greg right there in the making. There he is. He's
4985020	4989900	picking up some products. Oh, there you go. There's your cheese. Yep. Thank you. Please remove
4989900	4995420	that terrible review you left on the supermarket. Would appreciate it. I'm going to start slacking
4995420	5000940	off at work. Slacking off. Oh my God, that should be the name of the title. Slacking off with your
5000940	5011900	co-worker at work. Oh my God. I love it. Don't worry about being late, you goofy goober. You have
5011900	5017340	a sheebie ace of art to look forward to. Be kind, reeflings. Over exposure to work times,
5017340	5023420	mud can lead to premature ink ejaculation. It's a serious issue and affects one in every five
5023420	5028540	cephalopods. Are you squiddin' Maria? It's okay, my little cephalopods, I believe you. I can imagine
5028540	5034940	Strani as a puppy girl. I mean she has the tongue belicking, of course. And she did tell us yesterday
5034940	5040380	that her cervix is good for doggy. Stop! If you don't use juice, cetentical bone, you are gonna
5040380	5047100	have to bake like a good puppy. Are you squiddin' me right now? Stop! Strani, you are a good girl.
5047100	5052540	Stop! But don't worry, even if you misbehave, we'll still take you on walkies. You'll just have
5052540	5057500	to be muzzled, blindfolded, and have an egg vibing in the clam for correction purposes.
5058380	5064700	I am interested. You can't be saying the stuff in my head, peas. We're getting explicit 50
5065420	5075820	nine. I can't focus on the numbers, Mason! Me next. Thank you anonymous and reluctantly seen.
5075820	5082140	Stop it! You're making me embarrased. God, you guys are really having... Why is it only women
5082140	5087660	have problem with the shelf? I'm starting to think something's going on here. What are the odds that
5087660	5093420	both women are known for window shopping and they can't decide on what product to buy at the stage?
5095340	5102780	Stop. How is this on YouTube? Why? We're in a supermarket. What are you all about?
5102780	5108140	We're in a supermarket. Excuse me, miss, you seem to have a wet patch. It is in aisle one,
5108140	5117340	it had an odd taste to it, and also it smells like clowns. No! Strani, I think we need to get a
5117340	5125180	clicker to help you stay motivated while working and be a good girl. No! Stop it! Thank you,
5125180	5131260	anonymous and rent desolation. Stop! Right, I didn't focus. You're getting redirected into
5131260	5137100	Sheebie's ASMR anyway, so she gonna keep you going. Right, I'm sorry but what is going on here?
5139980	5146220	Seriously, three of you make up your mind. Your husbands are at home wondering where you are
5146220	5149740	and you're just going nuts over the oil. There must be something wrong with the shelf.
5149740	5158780	I don't know. Can I push it forward? Carry? Okay. I'm just gonna move it forward.
5159980	5168140	No, it didn't make them adjust. Huh. What? What's wrong with the pathing? I don't see it.
5168140	5177740	It must be the product then. Hmm. User confusing me, ladies. I don't know what's the matter.
5179420	5183740	I'm afraid I don't know what the matter is. Right, I'm gonna try and sell out of my product to buy
5184460	5192220	the next upgrade to expand the shop. They're bugging. Yeah. They're bugging? I don't know what's going
5192300	5207660	on with them. Oh crap, we have bills to pay. Oh, come on. We're like all the way down again.
5208700	5213420	This game is actually hard. Sorry, I said it. Last time you bought Flour, it fixed.
5214060	5218540	Are they wanting Flour? Is that why everyone's having a hard time? I'm gonna try and sell out
5218540	5223820	my product so I can expand the store. If everyone buys everything that I've got right now, then boom,
5223820	5231500	we can do the next objective. We will never make money at this rate. Typical Scottish corner
5231500	5236940	shop, actually, though. Our money. That game literally made the game wants us to take along
5236940	5244540	because we don't do that here. No, we don't borrow from the banks. We blow them up. Stop.
5244620	5250940	Refling. You can't say that out loud. But you were thinking it. All right, hydration check,
5250940	5252380	refling. You need hydrate.
5257180	5261740	Honestly, the begging girlfriend ASMR made you laugh your ass off. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
5261740	5266380	It was so fun to come up with. I came up with everyone's meme ASMR ideas,
5266940	5271580	but I didn't want to risk anyone's channel. I came up with that idea myself and I was like,
5271580	5279180	okay, I'll risk my channel by saying something silly like that. It popped off. It might hit 100K,
5279180	5285660	which is insane. It's insane to say your first uploaded ASMR video might get 100K views.
5289340	5293980	That's insane. I actually think we're gonna be... Oh, thank you for all your...
5294860	5298380	Your... Yes, thank you, custom. Thank you. Love you.
5300780	5303260	The gamble has played off, honestly.
5304540	5310300	You did this to yourself, Strone. I remember you once challenging reflings that if they wanted
5310300	5316300	to dominate you, they'd have to do a lot better. Now we have finally found your weakness, Puppy
5317020	5317740	No!
5320860	5326540	No, no, no, no. I literally just got tingles. Like, my body literally reacted to that. What the
5326540	5332940	fuck? No! Thank you, anonymous, but no! Stop. I'm trying to freaking run a supermarket.
5333660	5342700	Le supermarché. J'ai travaillé. Le supermarché, mes yeux. Non joué dans la
5343420	5348700	travailler. I'm fucking trying so hard to say stuff in French. Bro, right, relax. I don't
5348700	5357740	know what's going on. We're gonna need to move it. Can you guys let me put it down before you
5357820	5367500	come over and glitch out again? How do I take the stuff off the shelf? It's messing up my game.
5369660	5374220	How do I take the stuff off the shelf? Okay, you know how I said the game's polished? I take
5374220	5385900	it back. I take it back. The game's not polished. The women are stuck again. I'm trying. I'm trying.
5386540	5394860	I'm trying. I think the game needs a little bit more work, but overall, we're getting there.
5395660	5399100	There's definitely something glitched out on that shelf. I'm gonna see if I can take the
5399100	5404700	stuff off it, like the products off of it, maybe. I don't really know what the issue is.
5405900	5412700	$24! All yours, sir. Thank you. We need $350 before the end of the day. And because you
5412780	5416700	are all being assigned here, I think we're getting less customers as well,
5416700	5420780	because the game can't assign too many customers at work. She's hypnotizing that.
5420780	5424620	They're baffled by the low prices. They can't comprehend.
5426380	5433580	I think you need an empty box to remove stuff. Right, okay, let's grab a box. We'll just buy
5433580	5445420	whatever. It's on cheap. Right, bread. Let's go. Purchase. Let's go. And then... No! Just wait a second,
5445420	5454380	please. Close through, drop, take. Are you squiddin' me right now? The box doesn't match the size,
5454380	5458300	are you jokin'? I bet you all it would take is a surprise slap to her arse or an extreme shock
5458300	5463260	to her collar. And she would be whimpering and panting and drooling at the mouth for her eflings.
5463740	5467980	I must have them hypno eyes rolling in the back of your head ahead of our style.
5471500	5472380	What am I even s-
5477500	5479180	What do I even see?
5484860	5490540	What was I supposed to see? Thank you, Rufeland, for the tips.
5494380	5499580	And on to the mid-today, clearly. I thought I'm the one that's supposed to be coming up with
5499580	5507500	the scenarios, not you. Right, oil. Buy it and then get fricking rid of it off the dang shelves.
5507500	5513340	Okay, yes, yes, yes, thank you. Thank you, Ruf. So got another week.
5514700	5520460	Man, I'm sick of this TTS spam. I want to watch a Stranny Cutler stream, not Brian's, each.
5520460	5524940	Are you had enough of Brian? Brian! Right, Brian, that's enough out of you, young man. Do you-
5524940	5530940	Did I make myself clear? Brian, no more. Okay. All right, as Brian dealt with, don't worry,
5530940	5537820	I got you, Rufeland. Right, you, all. How do I put it in? Take. See you all glitching out.
5538780	5542540	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they all- Right, I'm leaving this
5542540	5547420	box here in case it's glitchy, because what the heck was all that about, honestly? Oh, it's getting
5547420	5554860	dark in the shop. Ah, it's getting dark. I'm scared of the dark unironically. Are you squidding me
5554860	5565660	right now? This place is too small and crowded. Two stars. Are you helping me? Are you- Wait,
5565660	5571500	are you helping me gameplay-wise via role-playing as a customer?
5572460	5581820	Are you helping me gameplay-wise role-playing as a customer? I think you are, because we do need
5581820	5596220	to expand. We just need the 350. Thank you, customer Greg's- Wait, what? There's no way.
5596780	5606700	There's actually no way. I'm $1 short from expanding. This is meta. This is why I like
5606700	5615260	backseat gaming. That is so creative. That is so creative. I can even do that myself. Oh my gosh,
5615260	5622780	right. Management, growth, section two. Purchase this section to expand. There we go, we did it.
5622860	5631500	Oh my gosh, that is hilarious. Thank you, customer Greg's fucking way to dollars change,
5631500	5635020	ma'am. Thank you. Couldn't find- No, you're not going to find nothing in this shop.
5636620	5648220	Look at it. Oh my god, our scene got upgraded. It's getting so big. Yay. Okay, I need to push
5648220	5655100	the products back on the shelf. This is not backseat and you are in a video game. No, because
5655100	5659420	some features don't like it when you tell them what to do and I'm like, please help me so much.
5659420	5665100	Thank you again for the tip. That was so creative. Customer Greg's wave, that's hilarious.
5665820	5672700	Honestly, hilarious. Right, we're going to push some stuff back. We need to- I wonder if you can
5672700	5681340	buy the supermarket radio. Right, all the frozen products are going to go along this- well,
5681340	5685500	or cold products, I guess. I'm going to keep the boxes in case something glitches out again,
5686140	5691980	because that was a bit of a nightmare to fix. Nice, it's not an average customer shop anymore.
5691980	5700140	It's not. Look how big the windows are as well. We are up. We- oh my god, sorry. Can I just say
5700140	5704060	the serotonin boost of like physically seeing your shop getting bigger because all of your
5704060	5712140	hard work paid off? I love these kind of games. Oh my god. I love these kind of games. I said it.
5712140	5715580	I said it. I'm sorry. I don't care. I said it. Right, what's the next objective? Oh, we haven't
5715580	5719580	been assigned one. Right, what are the bills? I'll pay the seven dollars. I can't pay rent.
5720140	5726140	Stronny be a good girl. Roll onto your back and I will give you a some tummy rubs. Then if you
5726140	5732940	keep being good, maybe I will give you this bone. No! You called yourself Stronny's trainer!
5734380	5742860	Reef- wait, we only have oil. Reef-ling! You can't- oh, maybe that could be a nickname for you guys.
5743420	5745100	You can be my personal trainer.
5749100	5758300	Could we get away with that? Could we? Should we? I don't know. Right, if I bought one of everything,
5758300	5765180	how much is that? Are you squidy? We can do 200 bucks. Remember, Stronny, if you want something,
5765180	5770380	you are going to have to bark for it. A good girl likes you knows that you can't speak English.
5770700	5776700	Years are done. Years are done. No more. Anonymous. Thank you. Me no, thank you.
5776700	5782220	Hey, I'm far in the back of this seat. Maybe keep a box for each product in the
5782220	5789500	storage for any more glitch shelves? Good girl. Okay. What is this? Is this a break room?
5789500	5794860	Are you squidin' me right now? Is this a break room? I got a bowl with her name on it so she can
5794860	5802860	shlop. Shlop oman na ala corn on the cup. This should give me hate. I only have oil to sell.
5802860	5810380	This is literally an American supermarket now. America kanya! TTS was a mistake. Stop! Thank you,
5810380	5821420	Tharia. IBW. Anonymous. Are you squidin' me right now? Knock, knock, mom, are you okay? Why are you
5821500	5831020	salivating in front of your monitor? This puppy salivating. Okay, everyone is buying oil.
5831020	5836700	Literally. Yeah, I know you can't find nothing. I ain't got no stock. Everyone please purchase the
5836700	5845180	oil at your next convenience, okay? Because we are running low on the market prices lower than
5845260	5849180	three bucks. Okay, hopefully it changes as well. Oh my god, I think we're gonna have to like...
5852780	5857580	Oh, there's a customer. You spawned out of nowhere. You were not even in my shop a moment ago.
5859020	5864060	Please. Okay, everyone. Okay, yes, just buy oil. Thank you. This is helping so much. I'm not even
5864060	5869100	kidding. Please continue to buy oil. Does someone say oil's American screeching?
5876140	5882380	I have a really funny clip of Azura, actually. Thank you Momo for the tip as well. I have actually
5882380	5888780	a really funny clip of Azura. I might send it to her and see if she will let me post it.
5889580	5897020	It was us before we did the group collab on debut. She randomly starts singing the American
5897100	5901660	national anthem, but Azura's got some lungs on her. She's like,
5904620	5908220	and I'm like in the background. I'm like, make check, make check, and she's like,
5910940	5916300	I'm like, Amy, Amy, make check, make check, just so we can hear you. It was really funny,
5916300	5920940	so I'm gonna see if she's happy with me post it because it was hilarious. I'm like being super
5920940	5925340	serious. Like, oh, that was good guys, right? Make check, mercy, make check, check, check,
5925340	5934620	and then buy the drones early night. It was absolutely hilarious. So, okay, I'm gonna have to
5934620	5942220	buy some product. That isn't like a squadillion dollars because, right, 64 bucks. Yeah, just,
5942220	5947740	yeah, one oil. Yep. I know you can't find anything, sir. You're gonna, you'll never guess why because
5947820	5955020	we don't have anything in stock. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. We need an American flag
5955020	5965660	bikini cookout, Azura. I think that is a fantastic alternative outfit for Azura. I actually fully
5965660	5970300	agree with that. I'm not even kidding. I actually fully agree. I want to see those bedonkers bedonking
5970300	5974540	in an American bikini outfit. I'll take it. You can sing pretty damn well too though.
5975420	5980940	Well, I got Emmy, we finally got Emmy's song cover, which I've not paid the guy for yet.
5980940	5983740	Actually, sorry, if you're watching right now, I will pay you after the stream,
5984620	5988220	and I just need some time to nap after the stream, and then I will deal with the rest.
5990620	5996540	Gonna grill them dogs, honestly though. Are you squidding me right now?
5998140	6003340	Just thinking about how a strong themed Tenga would go hard, and so would I.
6003420	6010060	What's a Tenga? Oh, that's the wrong number. Thank you, Tharia, for the tip, or the super
6010060	6014380	trot. I don't know if I have to say super trot tip. I don't know. It's the same thing. What's a Tenga?
6015660	6019980	It sounds like a Konga. Konga, Konga, Konga, Konga. Tenga, Tenga, Tenga.
6023420	6026940	Tenga is an honor hall. Oh, I've been singing about it.
6027900	6032140	I've been singing about it.
6041660	6050140	Okay, then. That's what it's called. I've never heard that terminology.
6050860	6056620	Oh, you've just absolutely messed me up. Give me that back, and then put it down there.
6060220	6066700	She's a degeneracy built into her blood. No, why did I buy more oil? We have more than enough oil.
6066700	6071100	I'm gonna have to hire a reflin to go on the checkout, because this is getting tricky.
6071100	6075580	This is getting tricky. Insufficient change. Oh, what?
6075820	6082940	Giving six bucks. Okay, make it four, and then do 120, then one. Jeez.
6083900	6090460	Sorry, sir. I can't count, but thank you for giving me the patience to count. Kind of blue.
6090460	6096620	Come on, I need to restock here. Stop buying stuff. Give me a freaking moment to breathe. No
6096620	6103980	change. Thank you. Change two dollars. Thank you. Please, I need to like quickly buy stuff like
6103980	6111340	right now, because everything is so empty. I'm literally just buying anything.
6112060	6116220	Please. I don't know. Bread? I've not had bread in a while. Go. Boom. We love bread.
6116220	6123020	Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love bread around these parts. She's an oil. Change. Oh my God.
6123020	6128140	Sorry. I love this game. I'm addicted. I'm not gonna lie. I think I could easily play 12 hours of
6128140	6130780	this. I'm not sure anyone wants to actually sit and watch 12 hours of this.
6134540	6139580	I didn't take this phone like the good girl you are. Reflex where I played Supermarket Simulator.
6141980	6147020	I didn't know the flubber aisle really got you going. Hey, Stronny, if you are a puppy girl,
6147020	6155820	what breed would you want to be? I haven't thought that far ahead. I don't know.
6156140	6164460	I have black hair, so this is an interesting TTS room. Literally, I'm like, is the bakery aisle
6164460	6170860	really getting you going that good? I mean, shit. I'll take it. I'm glad that you guys are enjoying
6170860	6177980	it. Thank you so much. Stronny's trainer and anonymous. I am working on the stock issues,
6177980	6183100	man. Please have patience for the love of God. I just get paid minimum wage. I just show up and
6186380	6193020	I'm trying. I'm actually getting stressed by my virtual job. I can't believe it. I can't handle
6193020	6199580	stress. Oh, God, the packages, please. Will someone please think of the packages? Milk is only two
6199580	6208220	dollars? What? I'm coming, please. Wait. I was gonna say three dollars seems a bit more,
6208940	6214780	a bit more economy related. Oh my God. I'm actually getting stressed. I can't keep up.
6214780	6219980	Actually, unironically, can't keep up. Oh my God. I need help. I need help. I need an adult.
6219980	6226620	I need an adult. Wait. I'm the adult. No. I don't have time for all of this. Right. We've got sugar
6226620	6230140	again. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. All right. All
6230140	6236780	right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. Ninety. Why would you
6236780	6244540	give me such big number of change? The milk is French. Wait, is it? Does it say delay on it?
6245260	6253580	Does the milk say delay? Milk semi-skilled. Boulay. What? It is French. Well, zero isn't French.
6255500	6260540	Okay. We're gonna unpack everything that we purchased. I have no idea what we purchased.
6260540	6266940	I was just busy panicking, but okay. Not to ruin it. Right. Close your ear canal if you don't want
6266940	6274140	to hear a spoiler on what one of the zero shorts are. She played supermarket simulator and one of
6275100	6279500	the things she said was like, do you want my milk basically? Because she was selling milk product.
6280620	6284620	But it was like such a good clip and it's getting made and I'm so excited for it to come out.
6286140	6290460	A British woman selling French product. Disgusting, honestly. What will they think?
6291660	6296940	Is there a Boulay? No. Don't call her that. I'm just kidding me right now.
6298540	6303260	If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oils. Omega.
6303260	6311100	Wait, what does that mean? Azu Ryuji. Oh, come on. You need to make your names easier for me to say.
6311100	6319740	What is that? Azu Re Ya Uji. Thank you for, thank you for letting me take your cherry yonk.
6319740	6325340	My cherry now. What are you gonna do about it? Yonkers. My super chat cherry now.
6325660	6332620	I'm fucking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fond de la bosom. Well, you should have heard of one of
6332620	6337180	the names. Right, I can tell you later but I can't tell you right now. Cover myself in oil?
6337180	6344780	What? If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oil. I'm to cover myself in oil?
6345180	6356780	Hard-ass names, honestly. Oil up. Stronnycuddles oiled up when? Right now. I technically already
6356780	6361340	made that ASMR but I got taken down but I'm gonna put it back up on September because it wasn't
6361340	6368300	the clapping that got the video taken down. It was the breathing in the ear. Yes, that is true.
6368300	6373900	How much is cheese? Cheese is three bucks. How much is pasta? Pasta is three dollars.
6373900	6380380	How much is bread? Bread, I am overcharging for bread. Very big. Very big overcharge? No, I will
6380380	6393500	not say why. Right, tea. I made a good profit from, we've not got, I think we need another fridge.
6393500	6402540	You know that. Oh, there's a thing as a double fridge. Oh, I mean, where are the floors? Oh,
6402540	6407020	we can change the floor? I mean, I'm not really fussed for changing the floor. I'm not sure that's
6407020	6412860	gonna make a difference to sales, is it? Unless the carpet is like absolutely minging, I think we're
6412860	6421020	okay just to leave the carpet as it is. Right, pay my bills, pay my rent. I can't pay rent. Hiring,
6421100	6426780	right, what's going cashier? One, automated checkout, daily wage, 80 bucks, hiring cost,
6426780	6436780	100, complete checkout. What? Complete checkout, it requires store level 10. I can't hire you
6436780	6446140	refling until store level 10? It's an old troll science comic. Oil floats on water. So to fly,
6446140	6450780	you cover yourself in oil, wait for it to rain, then you can fly for free.
6451580	6456700	What? How was I supposed to get that reference? Thank you, tiny spiny. There's no way. Hire a
6456700	6463580	reef stalker. Oh, that's actually pretty good. I'll take that. Please understand that algorithm is
6463580	6467820	unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the concept of breathing. Literally, though. Pass the three
6467900	6475100	bucks outrageous, honestly. How? Right, so I can't hire anyone yet. That's fine. Storage, I don't want
6476300	6484060	customization. Oh, I can change the name by cost, money. Change entrance. No, thank you. I'll take
6484060	6493660	my tight clamp and elsewhere. Growth, right. Section three, four. So this is for the sigh. How much?
6494620	6503660	How can I make this much profit selling eggs? How big can this game get? Product license. Peanut
6503660	6513660	butter, flour. Oh my, this game is like way bigger than I first imagined. Banknot, market,
6513660	6517500	furniture, a new shelf maybe? How much is a shelf? 100 bucks?
6517900	6524060	Maybe a shelf for more, although the... Oh!
6527100	6534700	A checkout. Right, a checkout means we can hire a reflin at level 10. Okay. Okay, let's just focus
6534700	6541660	on getting our money up. Okay, we can do that. Clamps to take, you need industrial pliers.
6541660	6547260	Stronny, your bakery always gets me going. I will eat all of your cake. Once I am done,
6547260	6553340	all that will be left is some cream. Are you... Are you fucking naming Stronny's cake on us, sir?
6553340	6559100	That's amazing. Thank you for the tip. The bakery, the bakery's not open. All we have is sugar. We
6559100	6564380	don't even have flour. I'm out of flour already, literally. No, even started and I'm out of products.
6564380	6571500	Where's flour? Go. Order. Oh no, there's something else in here. $60. Let's just get the
6571500	6577820	flour in. Let's just get it in. Okay, a yolk now. Hee hee hee. Oh, I do have flour. Right,
6577820	6582220	I'm just blind. I'm sorry I'm blind. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Okay, I'm blind.
6583580	6589100	Grilla's out of cake. Stronny provides the egg for the bakery. Did you know you spawn in
6589100	6594620	with like 10,000 eggs and literally only like 100 or viable or something silly like that?
6595180	6601100	There's like some, honestly, I could talk about like pregnancy and ovulation cycle and all that.
6601100	6608780	Speaking of ovulation, thank you very much for your custom goods, sir. Oh no, the conversation I'm
6608780	6614780	having in the headset, it's just with my co-workers. They're locked in the room right now in the staff
6614780	6620220	room. I just don't have access to my co-workers yet. It's fine. No, no, don't report me for the
6620220	6624700	conversations. I know you can't find the cereal. I can't afford the cereal. That's why you can't
6624700	6630780	find it, sir. Okay, I can afford it this time. Okay, you just spend your time at the shelves
6630780	6635420	a lot, but no, no, no, don't go to the- thank you. They're so quick. Like, they honestly didn't
6635420	6638860	give you like, I'm sorry, but you can actually see me restocking and trying to do all these
6638860	6644780	jobs at the same time. And they're like, servicing now, please. I don't know your marks. I'd be
6644780	6650380	too shy to say anything though. I don't know if that's the component, but like, you have no filter,
6650380	6656860	by the way. I know I'm aware. I'm sorry. I apologize. How do we restock your eggs? No, you
6656940	6663660	spawn in with them. You spawn in with all the eggs. You don't generate any new eggs at birth or
6663660	6670860	anything like that, like after birth or anything. You spawn in like that for genetic material. It's
6670860	6674860	actually really fascinating. I don't know. I don't know how you felt about the education stream
6674860	6680620	yesterday. I had a blast, okay? I'm gonna be honest. I had a blast. Sorry, I like education. I think
6680620	6686460	it's fun. And I didn't know if you guys knew I was gonna give you a little quiz at the end,
6686460	6693180	but I was like giggling away, kicking my feet under the table when I was making my wee thing up
6693180	6697900	for years. I was like, I'm gonna get him. This is how I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna
6697900	6702540	do that. Are you squeezing me right now? And I'll do that. I bet Stronny would love a refling
6702540	6707900	growling in her, like a predator ready to turn her into prey. Little pup will learn her place
6707900	6713420	under her alpha refling. What? The list, how wet is the fabric of your chair from this teasing?
6713420	6725820	Stop! I'm in the supermarket! Les supermarchés! Arrête! Arrête! J'attends la fucking supermarché,
6725820	6732940	man. Fucking hell, reflins. Why are we all, why are we so, what happened? What, is it filming?
6732940	6737740	Why are we all so revved up? Give us a week. Give us a week. Give us a week, okay? A week and then
6737740	6743980	it all starts up again, okay? Because we, something's going on with us right now. It is a film.
6745180	6750220	It's a full moon, clearly, because what's going on? No, I'm just purchasing stuff. Please,
6750220	6756860	give me a sec. I swear the game makes them teleport as soon as you look away for a millisecond.
6756860	6762300	Out my way, ma'am. You're in my way. Right, coffee. Oh my god, that's so satisfying the way
6762620	6768540	they stalk. Oh, I just walked into them. Okay, small age happy break. If us
6768540	6774380	reflings were to work in your store, what type of uniform would we have? Just the hat or would
6774380	6783740	we have a little shirt as well? Would you have a shirt? I don't think I'm a uniform. That's a
6783740	6791340	good question. I need an easy access uniform. I said what I said. I don't care. I'm sorry. I said
6791340	6796700	what I said. I need an easy access. That's it. That is how I will deal with the nine to five.
6796700	6800220	Most people need alcohol at the end of the day to deal with their nine to five.
6800220	6804140	Some people need smoke cigarettes for the nicotine hit. Some people, you know,
6804140	6808540	recreational drugs to deal with the nine to five at the end of the day. I just need easy access.
6808540	6815340	That's all I'm asking. Velcro? Velcro? That would be hilarious. I'm sorry. That's absolutely
6815340	6822620	hilarious. Velcro all constantly like every 10 minutes, all you hear is and then in the break
6822620	6833020	room, just every two seconds. That's honestly hilarious. I let you weren't you were not even
6833020	6838060	approaching this till I swear you were not even approaching this. There's no way and it's getting
6838300	6845500	No, stop. I'm just turning the lights on, please. Turn the lights on. Why is there so many
6845500	6851580	customers? Apologies, Mamalaz-Riflin saw a cute supermarket worker working the cash register
6851580	6857900	and we couldn't resist. See her blush. Stop. Okay, that was a compliment. So I'll take it.
6860060	6865740	Why is there so many customers? What's going on? Don't you all have like wife and kids to go home to
6865740	6870780	juice? What do you mean you're getting milk to go home? Thank you Anonymous for all the tips.
6870780	6875500	You're all called anonymous, but I don't want to grip you together. I will thank you individually.
6875500	6879660	Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. I'm under the counter.
6879660	6883500	It's raining some strange liquid and I'm hearing some wild shite.
6885420	6893900	You're not hearing anything. This place is empty. Needs more items. Three stars. Okay. Okay. Okay.
6893900	6899580	We're getting up. There we're getting up. Wait, wait, that's a new, you're making new
6899580	6906220	YouTube accounts because that's your first super chat registered on the account. There is no way
6906220	6914460	you're going to all that effort. You're making new YouTube accounts to stream snipe in game.
6914620	6925740	Thank you customer Gregson. Oh my God. That's amazing. Momo, thank you for the tip as well.
6925740	6933820	There's strange liquid stuff. Oh my God. How are you going to such efforts?
6935660	6940220	Right. I'm just going to completely sell out a product. I know I should probably order before.
6940300	6946940	Order. Have you guys been on TikTok to that Scottish Chinese shop? I'm so sorry to
6946940	6952540	completely derail with brain rot. So on TikTok, there's this Chinese Scottish shop
6952540	6959740	and she like packs the orders, but she's got a funny accent. So she goes, come pack this customer's
6959740	6966460	order with me. This family needs 100% discount and some special treatment.
6967420	6974220	Yeah. Oh, thank you. This family needs 100% discount honestly though. Order. Yes,
6974220	6981900	fucking sin sister knows what it is. It's Becca's takeaway. And she's like, come with me today to
6981900	6988060	pack this customer's order, but it's like a vocal fry on order. So it's like order.
6989660	6994780	Because it's not really that common to have a vocal fry in Scotland. It's rather,
6995420	7000460	it's very Americanized if you will. Oh my God. Don't talk about America Challenge failed yet
7000460	7005420	again. Honestly, I can't believe it. Right. What have we got? I definitely need in a much bigger
7005420	7013740	fridge. I'm needing a bigger refrigerator. Right. We are going to preemptively pay all of our rent
7013740	7020140	issues. I don't feel like I'm making any profit. Am I going crazy? But I feel like I'm like losing
7020140	7027660	money somehow. Like I'm struggling to pay these bills. Me and Strone are going to do an
7027660	7034220	really Scottish tourist stream and we're going to go to a mukbang at Becca's. But I'm packing this
7034220	7039900	order for two v-chippers. Would you guys still love me if I had a vocal fry?
7040220	7048380	Okay. Wait. How can I do a vocal fry on a Scottish accent? Order. Good afternoon, Henry
7048380	7059500	Flings. I hope you're doing well. I could not maintain that. That's hideous. Right. Let's buy
7059500	7068780	the big wall of ours. What have we got? $200? Oh, we're doing math with my order. Oh my God.
7068780	7072940	That's awful. Please do not speak for the rest of the stream. I'm sorry. Thank you. Are you
7072940	7080460	squiddin' me right now? Wow. At this point, forget the ASMR booth. Just open a store staffed by
7080460	7086300	Reeflings. Okay. You can stay in the break room and be in charge of Team morale. We may be hard,
7086300	7093100	but you can take it. No need to be a good girl. You can be our bad girl. Wait, but would that
7093100	7097660	actually boost morale? Like, unironically, you know how like businesses are all like, I'm trying to
7097660	7105100	boost the morale of the staff without increasing their wages or whatever. I'm like, I feel like
7105100	7110140	that might work. You know, just me sitting in the staff room being like, how are the sales good?
7110140	7117580	And then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. This is the most inappropriate conduct a store has ever.
7118620	7123580	I think business would be booming though, you know? And like, as like, as a customer,
7123580	7129580	you come in and then like, all you hear is like muffled like, like behind the door is like,
7129580	7133500	is everything okay back there? It's just like, yeah, we're just expanding the shop. We're drilling.
7134460	7136940	We need to drill holes in the walls. So that's what that noise is.
7138700	7142460	Thank you, Zarian, for the tip. I think I've seen that video on a certain way. So,
7143980	7150140	Chinese, Scottish, YUMMY. I miss a Chinese. Right. I'm going to buy all the products tomorrow
7150140	7154700	and I'm going to go crazy and stack all the motherfucking jobs. Products found expensive,
7154700	7159900	products not found. Right, relax. Right, we can't all fricking, right. I know the market price is
7159900	7168460	changing. I'm sorry, but I ain't got time. Okay. Order. Oh, you can-
7174700	7179340	I mean, you're not wrong. You're not, I didn't realize you can run in this game.
7179340	7184300	Oh my gosh. How long have I been on this game for? And I didn't know you could fricking run.
7184300	7194220	Look how fast I am. Are you serious? You can run in this game the whole time? I am so fast.
7197900	7203580	I am so fast. Is this a joke? Oh, I can't sell the egg. Sorry.
7204060	7210300	Right. I am so fricking fat. Oh my god. Wait, why did I buy so many fridge stuff? I don't have room
7210300	7220540	in the fridge. Everyone watching the products expire. Oh my gosh. I didn't know you could move in this-
7220540	7224220	Oh, open, open. I was wondering why the customers aren't coming. Wait, how do I clean the outside
7224220	7230060	of the shop? It's dirty. Oh my god. This is not, this is not raising my beleveliness.
7230060	7233980	Oh, whatever that word is in Japan, beleveniminess. Oh, if we're going to say
7237420	7241980	belevenus, that's the word belevolne. What is that word?
7243420	7252780	Your belevolence. Your belevolence? Benevolence. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Right.
7252780	7259260	Change 30 bucks. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on the oil. Okay. I'll order oil, jeez.
7260620	7264780	I'm trying. I'm trying. Okay. I have time. I have time because I can run.
7265900	7270940	Bruh. Why did I not figure out you could run? Can you crouch? No, you can't crouch. Are you
7270940	7274220	squiddin' me right now? Okay, you can't crouch. It's fine. It's fine. No, don't bug out.
7277820	7282060	I feel out of place here as a sub. You're allowed to be a sub.
7283340	7287980	I'm pretty, I'm pretty alright. I mean, if you've listened to the new Patreon audio,
7287980	7294300	ain't no way you're a, you're a dumb in that audio. Look at the state of this place.
7294300	7302140	Riefland should be picking up the boxes. I'm going back to Tescos, honestly. Benevolence. Benevolence.
7302140	7307900	Okay, that sounds right. That sounds correct. I wish, I'm going to have to order, order
7308860	7313260	freakin' tea so I can put these away again. I don't know. There seems to be something about
7313260	7317820	the bottom, like, left or, I don't know. Sliced bread is too expensive.
7319900	7324620	Okay, I agree with you. I'm sorry. I agree. I do agree. I agree. I agree. I'm sorry.
7325740	7329420	Look, the prices change every day. Isn't it funny how the prices change every day,
7329420	7333340	but they continue to go up and they never go down, even though there might be moments in time
7333340	7337660	where things aren't as expensive as they should be. Isn't that curious? Curious, curious. Yeah,
7337660	7343100	that's what I think about you. Right, bread. We need more bread. Bread, bread, bread, bread.
7343100	7348380	Oh my God, fast. I'm fast as fuck, boy. Oh my God, sorry. This is so sad. It's fine to re-stock as
7348380	7356700	well. I'm so fast. I'm so fast. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so fast. Sorry. This is the most
7356700	7360460	efficient shop. Sorry. Sorry. I need to unlock that break room, like, right now because the
7360460	7364620	reflins are waiting on my thoughts. Either the reflins are waiting on me or I'm waiting on them.
7364620	7368860	You know how it is around these parts, baby. Oh, I need the coffee box and tea box. Are you
7368860	7374300	squidding me right now? I need the tea. Give me the tea. No wonder Dad doesn't come here. There are
7374300	7379420	no items. No, no, there is. There is. I'm waiting for people to freaking buy this. Are you squidding
7379420	7384220	me right now? There's milk and water, but no one's buying. ASMR, Scottish Cuttlefish Attempts
7384220	7390860	to Learn Her Second Language, English. Stop! It's true. It's actually true. No, it's true. It's
7390860	7396620	true. Thank you, tiny Spanish. That's actually so true. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm working on it,
7396620	7401820	daughter. I'm working. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I need to fix the glitch
7401820	7406380	that's going on right now. I can't believe reflins are about to turn Strani into a free-use public
7406700	7411500	owner. Hold. I don't think we can say that. Can we say that out loud? I don't know.
7417100	7421740	Greg got a nuclear family. Literally, Greg is winning at life. Right, put all of this shit in
7421740	7429500	the box. Stop. Whatever it, stop. Literally, stop. Whatever you guys are doing, knock it off. I'm
7429500	7433980	getting fed up. I'm getting, I'm not putting anything bottom right because it seems to be some sort of
7433980	7438220	weird glitch. $12. Thank you, ma'am. Are you squidding me right now? I apologize for my remarks.
7438220	7444940	I was getting frustrated that none of... Bark, bark. Growl. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7445660	7455420	Now that add-on is being the Doug Customer Greg's daughter's dog. Are we role-playing as a
7455420	7460140	meta role-play as I'm getting advice to play this game? This is, this is getting insane.
7461100	7466700	It's just getting insane. This is amazing. Oh my god, look at the money rolling in now.
7468300	7472700	Oh, I need to hire, refland. I need to hire you so badly to get on the till. This is like,
7472700	7479100	it's never ending. It's never ending. There's so many of you. What's going on? Why? Because I fixed
7479100	7486140	the glitch, I think. Boom. Right, we've have $150. Can people start buying from the fridge?
7486140	7490540	My products are going to go, they're going to spoil. I'm not even kidding. I need a new fridge.
7493180	7497100	It's better to buy the 375. I don't have 375 though.
7499340	7502460	Thank you, Anonymous. I can't believe reliefans are about to turn strong in there for you.
7502460	7507180	Ah, no, I'm not reading that out loud. Stop it, Anon. Bad Anon. Spank.
7509100	7515260	Tell me when Shibi goes live, by the way, just because she's doing ASMR today.
7515260	7518460	And Shibi is so close to 10k and I'm so excited. I'm about to...
7521020	7526140	I'm so excited for my genmei's success. Please give love and support to my genmeis.
7526140	7529420	I'm so proud of them and they're so hardworking and I love them and I'm going to kiss them on the
7529420	7541420	mouth. Anyway, that's just me. Shibi's live. Oh, I think her supermarket enterprises might be over
7541420	7550220	with. I don't know. I'm going to record that. My dad guessed in each of her names shortly.
7551180	7555260	Right, I'll play another day. I'm totally not addicted to this game, by the way.
7555900	7560300	But yes, my dad is going home in like a week's time, so I'm going to be depressed. But the
7560300	7565980	good news is there's going to be tons of streams. But deep down, I'm going to be sad inside.
7566940	7574300	But you cheer me up. And I get to play loads of games with you again and I get to do all the
7574300	7579580	ridiculous plans again. And I get to record all the ASMRs because I have tons of people waiting
7579580	7586540	on me to do collab ASMRs. So there's going to be content out there. But the only exchanges that
7586540	7594460	my dad has to go on. But that's okay because that's how life works sometimes. Okay, let's
7594540	7602540	very quickly buy new stock. Can I very quickly do this? Stock, you, you just shove everything in.
7602540	7605820	Literally shove everything in. Are you squiddin' me right now? Please.
7615820	7619740	I think we're going to get in trouble. You guys are going to have to start substituting the way I
7619740	7624140	do. You guys are going to have to start substituting because I'm getting, stop buying milk! Oh my gosh,
7624140	7629340	stop buying milk. Stop buying refrigerated products. Please, I'm begging. Please, brain,
7629340	7635020	stop messing up so badly. Right, you. Right, you guys are going to need to start substituting
7635020	7637820	because I'm getting nervous for this board now. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous,
7637820	7640860	but I'm glad you enjoyed the boot although. Because not everyone does it. Some people are like,
7640860	7645820	oh my god, I hate it. I hate it. It's like, bruh, bruh! Let's just role play. Close your eyes. It's
7645820	7650780	not real. Close your ears. Close your ears. You're subjecting yourself to something you don't like.
7650780	7657500	Close your ears. Honestly, my dad literally listened to this conversation being like,
7657500	7663500	what the fuck is going on in that room? What do you mean I have product? No! You're not supposed
7663500	7667900	to do that. I'm glad you went flower all yours. And you gave me a perfect change. Thank you, sir.
7667900	7673980	Have a good night. Have a good evening. I appreciate you. Can I please? Why are people not buying?
7675100	7675580	I mean.
7675580	7680780	Strongly, I will gift so many memberships if one day you can do an alternative outfit of you as
7680780	7688460	a puppy girl. I'm begging you. I don't, I mean, so my donathon is coming up. I've said like,
7688460	7695500	my donathons more like group activity stuff or like free access stuff. I've got about free use
7695500	7703180	on my mind now. Like, accessible stuff. You don't have to pay to access it. If you guys wanted to
7703180	7708140	like, I'm not going to stop you from like picking out because Azura is going to pick out what she
7708140	7711740	wants to do for her donathon. I assume she's going to do the same thing she needs next after.
7718060	7725420	Strongly cut us oiled up in 4K is currently the search suggestion. Thank you so much for letting
7725420	7729500	me yank your boy chair. Wait, what? Did I not yank your boy chair like two minutes ago?
7729660	7735340	We are good fish, believe us, maybe. We are good fish. We're the goodest fish in all the land.
7735340	7742300	We just mind yourself swimming and stuff. Yeah, if you guys want to, as if I'm going to say no
7742300	7747500	to a fucking alt puppy outfit, if you guys want to, you know, you know, hit me up, dab me up.
7747500	7754380	Are you joking? I'll be a puppy VTuber. Are you joking? Like, literally, I will get the custom
7754380	7759180	collar and it literally says property of reefling and then I'll get a toggle and everything and
7759180	7763020	please don't think I'm not going to do that because I'm a laundry serious. Right.
7765260	7770860	Okay, let's do this and then pop that down and then let's sell these eggs because they are
7770860	7779820	literally rotting. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, eggs are only one. Free you zone a hole? No,
7779820	7783740	she's still in charge, but I'm about to make her into a Twinkie.
7784860	7788540	Reeflings, right, we're about to get in trouble. We're about, we're unironically about to get
7788540	7793740	in trouble. Stop it. I'm going to have to spank you, okay? You've been naughty right now. Oh,
7793740	7797900	hold on, hold on, right, put the cheese in, right, the cheese has probably expired like half a century
7797900	7803340	ago, but hey ho, and that's not going to stop us. Came back just in time for the pet play,
7803340	7807420	rip Vod. Honestly, I'm starting to get, I'm getting nervous for the Vod. If we can all
7807900	7816380	take a deep breath and get ready to be redirected into Sheebie's lovely.
7816380	7824380	Four dollars for eggs? Sheesh, don't mind if I do. I mean, honestly, this isn't that badly
7824380	7828860	stopped in all consideration. Right, we'll play one more day and then we're redirected into Sheebie.
7828860	7836460	No, I'm not addicted. Are you squidding me right now? Hey, are you guys hiring? I have no experience.
7836460	7841740	Unemployed Greg's grandson. Look, you have to start somewhere with experience. Don't you love it when
7842460	7846860	places require you to have experience, but they won't hire people who've never had experience
7846860	7853660	before? Isn't that a fascinating point of them being in a part of this society? Hmm, isn't that
7853660	7858380	curious that they make it really impossible for you to even get an entry level job without having
7858380	7863020	a freaking PhD in fucking Yunnan? Honestly, it's getting outrageous. Don't you just love that
7863020	7869420	part of society in the community at large? Don't you just fucking love it? Literally,
7869420	7873340	don't you love it? This is getting a bit too real, honestly. Are you squidding me right now?
7874940	7879740	Might be the cutest Twinkie I've ever seen. You think I'm a cute Twinkie?
7881980	7887180	Thank you as a Rijie for letting me pop your cherry again. I don't know why YouTube said
7887180	7892540	let me do it twice, but it did. Anonymous. Bit of strong eats. Oh, not whole. Oh my god. I think
7892540	7900220	I missed that. Oh, I didn't realize you called yourself that. Thank you, Momo. Thank you, Zion.
7900220	7906060	Thank you, unemployed Greg's grandson and Momo again. Literally five years experience for an
7906060	7910220	entry level job, like fucking calm down. Honestly, I could absolutely kick. I was going to say the
7910220	7916940	C word, but you're not allowed to say the C word. Graduate with a bachelor's degree, and I can't
7916940	7922860	even get an entry level retail job. Honestly, ma'am, why are you giving me that much change?
7922860	7927980	Don't do that again. That made myself clear. Don't do that again. Four bucks change. Let me think.
7927980	7934140	All yours. I'll always just go for the dollar bill. Searching for 10 years experience in a 25-year-old
7934140	7939980	is a while. Are you squidding me right now? It is. That didn't answer my question. Yes, I will hire
7939980	7943420	if you don't have experience because I'll teach you everything I can teach you.
7943740	7951740	Okay, now that's a tall order. Thank you for your custom search. This is our biggest order.
7951740	7960860	$29 reduced. Thank you. Thank you for your custom. That's our biggest sale yet. I can't believe it.
7960860	7967260	I can't believe having an array of products leads to people purchasing it multiple versions of it.
7967260	7971500	Shocking behavior. Honestly, shocking. Absolutely shocking. Good girl, strongy. I knew you could
7971500	7978220	be a good if you tried. Keep this up and I will give you a treat later. Okay, that's acceptable
7978220	7983660	because that's implications, but it's not going to get as bad. Yes, I will hire, I will teach you
7983660	7990860	everything I know, and then you can be, and I'll vouch for your CV. I saw, oh my god, I should get a
7990860	7995820	throwaway number that you guys can use for a CV, and then they'll phone up and they'll be like,
7995820	8001180	hey, Anon says that you worked, they worked for you for like a year. Can you tell us about their
8001180	8004780	experience and all that, and I'll just like straight up like guess you up. I'll be like,
8004780	8010060	yeah, he was absolutely fantastic. I cannot recommend the employee. I was really sad to see him go,
8010060	8015900	but unfortunately, because I, you know, I had a few complications with my health, I could no
8015900	8021900	longer employ him, but Anon's perfect 10 out of 10. I so want to do that. That'd be the funniest
8022700	8027740	thing ever. Like I'll give you an email. I wonder why Grandpa hates this place. No, Grandpa likes
8027740	8032940	it. Look, I've got tons of products. Like come on. So I actually, this, I'm doing really well,
8032940	8038140	so I'm actually doing so well. So I don't believe you. I don't believe you first, I think. I definitely
8038140	8044060	need like a double fridge though. This is getting like outrageously. Oh, I'm about to be able to afford
8044060	8051020	a double fridge. Don't mind if I do. Any references? Yeah, I'm the reference. She's such a sweetheart.
8051100	8054860	I'll get you guys on a job somewhere. I know exactly what they want to hear because,
8054860	8060380	you know, if you didn't know. Well, now you know, hydration check, refling.
8065340	8069500	I'm waiting for my application to be approved. I need to be level 10 before I can hire a
8069500	8076780	refling, unfortunately, Greg. Grigory. I wish I wasn't so scared. I would love to play Fanaf,
8076780	8080620	but I get very scared. I literally have a heart attack at the concept of the game.
8080620	8089100	So we shan't be playing Fanaf. But we can definitely watch the Fanaf movie.
8090540	8098060	Hear me out. Fanaf movie and a karaoke thing. Watch along. And we'll watch. I'll tell you what,
8098060	8103660	I'll get Emmy to play Fanaf, right? And then I'll watch her play it. And then we'll do the
8103660	8108220	Fanaf movie and then we'll do Fanaf karaoke. How about that? So I don't have to play it. I don't
8108220	8116860	have to be. It's just we shit in my panty loons. You know what I'm saying? Change 44. Oh my God,
8116860	8122060	I'm so smart. What? Oh, wow. Sorry. Business is actually booming. What do you mean a fully
8122060	8128220	stocked shop equals business booming? Because I can, I literally am so busy now.
8128940	8134700	Oh, are you squidding me right now? Are we flings? No, you spelled it wrong!
8134700	8136380	My flings, I missed hearing that.
8136380	8141340	Violetton, Violetton, the other spelling. We're under the water, Violetton. Violetton,
8141340	8147180	the other spelling, the other spelling, the other spelling. Honestly, it's genuinely not
8147180	8151340	a big deal. I literally paid for your concept and created you type thing. Nothing was a sign.
8151340	8157420	So literally saw his butt. But we spell it ee, r-e-e-fling. Thank you so much,
8157420	8163820	Violetton, for the 20. And it's nice to see you again. Nice to see you. Nice. Any old
8163820	8168860	refling, any new refling. Don't worry, you're all equally getting shagged. Shut the fuck up!
8169420	8174620	Sorry, I'm hyper. I'm really enjoying this game right now. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
8175420	8182540	I'm sorry. I'm enjoying this game thoroughly. It's the game. It's, it's the game. Okay, I'm so sorry.
8184300	8189500	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Right, we're gonna order,
8189500	8196700	I dare, the double fridge, and then we're gonna order some product. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm so sorry.
8197340	8203820	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Right, hold on, how do I do that?
8205100	8210780	Are you squidding me right now? You are? Yeah. Reflings are down bad. Uh-huh. Sorry,
8210780	8215820	Strani, we've been very bad boys. You have, yeah. Whatever could we do to make up for it,
8215820	8218620	underscore sweat, and then you just said that.
8219500	8225820	Like, like chat reflects the streamer, okay, and streamer reflects the chat.
8227020	8234620	So maybe, sorry, and thank you. I am so sorry. That was wildly inappropriate.
8235340	8239500	Me, when the stream gets taken down, like, ah, okay. Are you squidding me right now?
8239500	8244060	Truly, wholeheartedly. I'm sorry too. Sorry that we aren't in the straight line right now.
8244140	8248460	Like, it's locked. I don't know how to get into it. I think if we expand the store and
8248460	8251180	off and let me do that, I'm gonna very quickly buy some more products.
8255260	8261020	I like to sing, I like to dance, but I can't do it with a pew pew in my pants. Got focused.
8262780	8267180	Look, I'm working out, look, the reason why stock is low, you're gonna shit your pantyloons
8267180	8272940	when you realize stock is low because you guys are buying all the stock and I am a one-man army,
8272940	8279420	please. Lose, just buy the tea. Okay, he's actually buying like tons of tea though. Thank you.
8279420	8288060	Eggs and tea, that's what I like to sing. I'm down for apocalyptic. What? I'm down apocalyptic
8288060	8296140	for strong. What? Apocalyptic? What? Apocalyptic. Oh, apocalyptic is a word. Yes, it is a word,
8296140	8300300	actually. Now that you mentioned it, apocalyptic is a word. Okay, I'm done. I'm not speaking for
8300300	8305820	the rest of the stream. Whoa, I can't even speak English. Right, water. Pop it there.
8306700	8315020	Eggies. Pop it there. Okay. Whoa, I thought we were finished with customers. Jump scare,
8315020	8322220	honestly, geez. Down the apoliptical, honestly, isn't that a machine in a gym? The apoliptic is?
8323180	8335180	I cannot freaking speak right now. I'm starting and stammering. Someone clipped when I was very
8335180	8344220	kindly gifted like 10 memberships and I was like, I was just an absolute shambles. It was a shambles.
8344220	8349740	Right, let's clean this up. We've got a few, just a few deliveries, just a few deliveries. Right,
8349740	8353260	we'll clean all this up, we'll do one more date and then I'm redirecting into Sheebie and there's
8353260	8359260	nothing you can do about it. You're getting loved on by the bun. She got buns of steel, okay? You're
8359260	8363820	getting loved on by the bunny. She's an ASMR. Please subscribe. She's almost hit 10,000 subscribers,
8363820	8370860	which is freaking awesome. As I said, the girls are like, they're just so fantastic and they're so
8370860	8375420	excited to reach these milestones because it's like, that's right, Strani give up on speaking English
8375420	8383340	and just bark for us. Stop! Make sure you get a good reward. It's so anonymous. Stop.
8384940	8392620	I have another week to wait. I have a whole week. I can't do anything for a week. Knock it off.
8392620	8399340	I'll start barking orders at you. Thank you for the tip though. And Momo, thank you for the tip
8399420	8406940	with the pew pew. Any purers? Any self-identified purers? I pee. I pee my pants. Sorry. I don't know
8406940	8414060	why I always make that joke. I don't know. I find it funny. Yes, also Sheebie's dream. Well,
8414060	8418780	Sheebie said she wanted a play button. So I told all the girls I will do everything I possibly can
8418780	8425740	to achieve a play button for you goofy gibbers. So if you didn't know, I have fantastic news. If
8425740	8434540	you're a clipper, Veilure is coming out with a clipping program very soon TM. And the current,
8434540	8439980	now you do have to apply and be accepted for it. You can't just automatically get it overnight. But,
8440620	8449100	but for every 1000 views you get, we have, we are going to trial $2 per every 1000 views you get
8449100	8455020	in the clipper program because we want to say a special thank you for taking the time to go
8455020	8467980	through VODs and edits. So we're going to offer $2 per 1000 views and the ceiling price is 100k.
8468700	8475340	So for one clip you could in theory get $200. However, it does have to have an expiry date
8475340	8479740	because we can't like pay you out like three years after, you know, the clips are, you know, the girls
8480460	8486060	are, you know, um, but if the clip gets over 100k views, but it reaches like a next milestone,
8486060	8490700	you also get like a bonus on top, but it's not 2000 per views. Like cause I didn't,
8490700	8494780	I didn't want to insult why am I standing here? Bro, it's the end of the day. Right. One more day.
8494780	8498700	Well, just give me one more day. Just give me one more day. What do I need? I need cereal.
8499500	8507260	I need a lot. Right. What do I need cereal? There's already flour. I need oil.
8508220	8512220	Water? Are you squidding me right now? More cheese. Why not? We'll buy all that in the month.
8512220	8517500	Screw the two dollars. For every 1000 views I want licking the ear from mama.
8517500	8521740	Oh, well, I've got that coming out. I need to edit it. It goes on Twitter for free. There's going
8521740	8526620	to be tons of ear licking content on Twitter because I recorded tons of fun ear licking and
8526620	8534940	then it never happened. Day 12, store income. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, let's very quickly order this.
8535020	8543260	Order. Come on. Come on. Come on. I've never restocked harder in my life.

8547420	8553820	it. Let's do it. Oh, wait. We already have oil. Oh, I need cereal. Why did I buy that? I need
8553820	8559660	cereal. Cereal. Do we need bread? Be honest. Do we need bread? No, that's bread there.

8569340	8570300	Right. Let's buy more bread.
8572460	8574220	Oil. Hell yeah. Oil.
8576380	8583740	Like I always said, oil. Are you American? Thank you as Richie and Momo as well. There's
8583740	8588220	going to be tons that you're licking. I promise. Just let me cook in a week. Let me, there'll be
8588220	8594140	so much cooking in a week. You have no idea. Do you call fish? Do you call fish? Do you call
8594140	8599660	fish? Sorry. I got, I got effing on my mind because of that freaking storage room thingy.
8599660	8607260	Why are you paying so much? Go. At my face. Let her cook what's for dinner.
8610220	8614540	I'm a full fish. Wait, what was the statement? I forgot. Do you call fish even have a tongue
8614540	8619580	for licking? Eh, not really. It would really be all done by the tentacle of things. But I have
8619580	8633260	eight. What the shit? I showed my dad my mech assault stream and he said hi to you all
8633260	8638380	whilst we were watching the board. I was like, so those are the reeflands and they all say hi to
8638380	8647260	me and we're all having a giggle. He really liked the scene where I was panicking in the
8648540	8653420	mech assault map where it was like you pretend to be an enemy because you're going to soot
8653420	8658860	or basically. He was like laughing at that and he was like reading all your chat and he was like,
8659500	8664380	your chat, my chat. Sorry, I'm trying to do it from his perspective. He was reading it and he was
8664380	8668220	like, whoa, they're really interactive. And I'm like, yeah, like that's like the fun of streaming
8668220	8672140	is like you get to talk live. They get to read your comment because like I explain to him like
8672140	8682780	I got explained to him that I got explained to me that when the streamer reads out your comment,
8682780	8686780	like it gives you a little serotonin boost. Like you ready? She AFK. She has brain rot. It's over.
8686780	8690540	Strong is going to be cooking so much so there's barely going to be any loudest fucking eagle sounds.
8690540	8695340	Give me fuel. Give me fire. Give me that witch I desire. Oh, hi pops and we cry when she disappears.
8695340	8701820	Hi papa. Oh yeah. What did you think of everyone wanting to marry? He finds it but he loves it.
8701820	8710700	He loves it. He has one question for you. Celtic arrangers. You have to pick. That's his question
8710700	8721580	for you. Basically. Basically. Yeah. Read mine too. Yeah. Yeah. Take that serotonin.
8722140	8725420	Take that serotonin boost. That's right. I'm reading what you're saying. What you can do about it.
8727900	8731820	What was the question? Maybe Celtic? Yes. Ah, yes. The ball. I love sports games.
8731820	8737580	Exactly. Celtic. Celtic. True. Read mine too. It's a super nice. True. Exactly. Get serotonin boost
8738540	8742940	Celtic. Exactly. That's right. Get that serotonin boost. The streamer has said
8742940	8753260	Lord give me one more chance. I love that song. It's so good. As if I can do any of that. Get
8753260	8759100	serotonin. Get serotonin. Hey you. I want to talk to your manager. The other day when I was here
8759100	8766380	you didn't have any cheese. Also the eggs my friends son bought tasted to eggy. Some eggs tasted
8767340	8772460	to eggy. Karen your comments about my shop are unfounded and I do not appreciate them. Karen
8772460	8784060	please leave your review and go. Thank you so much for the tip. Karen. No way. No way you're on
8784060	8793100	another account. I'll buy this place to build a kanzio here. You want to what? I'll buy this place
8793100	8800700	to build a casino. You want a casino? No. Gamble bad though. Gamble only good in Baltic. In Baltic
8800700	8806780	and Baltral. Why did I say Baltic? Baltic means cold in Scots. It's like oh that's Baltic. That's
8806780	8814860	reason. A casino. Oh come on. Come on. Come on. Give customer Greg's son-in-law a chance. Okay he's

8849900	8855020	You think I'm not? You think this is a joke huh? Strip poker. Well it's called sounds like a high
8855020	8861820	stakes game. What does that mean? Is that a pun or is that like a sentence? I'm so sorry. I don't
8861820	8865740	have my brain on me right now. What's wrong? Couldn't find the cheese. You just bought the cheese.
8865740	8870940	Am I going crazy? Rewind the void. Did she not just buy the last cheese and then complain that
8870940	8879500	she couldn't find the cheese? Uh, Madame, you are the problem. Right, I'm not going to restock
8879500	8886140	because we're going to redirect into Sheepsters doing her VA some more. And then I'm not going to
8886140	8891340	play this offline but please don't be surprised if I go nuts for another version of this, like
8891340	8897980	another stream of this game. I'm sorry but this gameplay, money go up and then I can unlock a
8897980	8903180	refling and I can like sexually harass you at the till and stuff. Like come on, come on. That's
8903180	8910220	right, grab that war. Buy my products. You love the store. You love the store. Get off the stage.
8911500	8918620	100 bucks. Oh come on, be realistic. Be realistic. You're lucky I can do math. Oh I'm level 10. I
8918620	8922060	can hire a refling but I'm not going to have enough money to do it. But we'll do it again, okay?
8922620	8927020	I can afford, you can afford a cashier. Well I need to buy the thing as well. I actually,
8927740	8930220	you need to buy the cashier and you need to,

8942220	8949420	you all come at once? She says, she said, aha that's what she said. No seriously, why do you all
8949420	8955420	pile up? By the last moment please. I'm getting stressed. Thank you for your custom but I'm getting
8955420	8960620	stressed. Right there's one more, one more customer and I think we're done. What is it? Oh no it's 8
8960620	8966860	p.m. There's a whole flock of new customers about to come in. Mummy likes tycoon games. Look, I do.

8972540	8977900	this game called Zoo Tycoon and you can like make all the animals happy in it and I adore that game.
8977900	8981820	It's like such a simplistic one. I don't know if I can make a stream out of it though. I think it's
8981820	8986940	a bit too boring but I love it. Folk leave in their offices there's a lot of them. It's trying to
8986940	8996380	get more vague Rievelin. You will be so damn bad for Sukiya. Will I actually be Suika? Suika. Suika.

9026380	9031580	game. I get addicted to one. Like thanks to streaming, unironically I get to play games for the first
9032540	9041740	time and just see what I enjoy. In June I got to play a buckshot roulette and that was fun as heck.
9041740	9047100	I did not expect how fun that was going to be. I am humping my desk for when the multiplayer comes
9047100	9052860	out. I'm sorry I'm gyrating. I think we're closed. I think we're closed. Lights out. What a beautiful
9052860	9059980	store. I will come back. I hear birds tweeting in game. We'll just have a little
9061740	9063260	is that in game or is that real life?
9065820	9069580	It may be real life. I'm sorry. It may be real life. There's birds tweeting. I forgot it's morning.
9070140	9077180	I forgot. It's 6 a.m. sorry. I just want to take an investigation around here. Is there like
9077180	9084700	anything in particular or is it just kind of a map? Hmm it seems to be that. Reef flanks!

9114460	9120540	gameplay a bit. Dry cleaners! Wake up! My uniform's dirty because of my reef flanks.

9127660	9132380	Reef flanks I know you're in there. I didn't realize how big the map is like. Holy moly!
9133180	9137900	It's like an eight block. Oh there's a carcass. Uh sir?

9159820	9165420	way? Whoa! He just phased through that taxi. I too phased through the taxi. Are you squeezing me right now?
