0	22680	poor thing you need to rest it's okay we've got you now it's alright to let
22680	36880	yourself relax we're here to reassure you all right don't mind our fluffy tails in fact you
36880	46240	might find it quite pleasant to be wrapped up in between us don't you I can sense that your
46240	66120	head is running 100 miles a minute but just take a moment to breathe one big inhale and one big exhale
66120	90720	it's okay to take your time you know that right not everything has to be now now now no wonder you
90720	101960	feel so stressed when you put such an immense amount of pressure on yourself who told you to do
101960	116240	that do you listen to everyone it gives you terrible advice but I'm being serious when I say just
116240	127560	take a moment to calm down you need some good sleep so I'll just have to make sure that I put
127560	139960	you into the deepest slumber I can manage in that case you might even need me to tell she was
140360	151800	wrong you know about what she said you put too much pressure on yourself you also put too much on
151800	161520	your plate at the same time I know you like being the workhorse and you like getting to the other side
161520	169840	but that's gonna have an effect on you if you sacrifice your sleep for it that's sacrificing
169840	183920	your health do you understand me good then just take a moment and try your best to tune out what's
183920	194760	going on around you it's just us three together in this moment we're guddled up we're looking after
194760	207360	you hopefully on the other end of this conversation you can feel yourself slowly dressed in all of this
207360	219680	sleep it's been a while since you've had a nice rest I can tell by your eyes it's the biggest
219680	232080	giveaway you know they aren't cold the windows to your soul for nothing it's alright to close your
232240	244240	eyes even if you don't think you'll fall asleep you can still listen to our words or at least the
244240	258480	sounds that we make do you like being wrapped up in our tails it's very fluffy isn't it I love
258960	270240	seeing people's reactions to just how incredibly soft they are why don't I try to reassure you a
270240	285360	little while you focus on how soft how soothing our tails are it's okay to worry but don't worry
285360	298080	you're so sick you are allowed to make mistakes you're only human after all so far you've made it
298080	310240	through 100% of all of your bad days and that makes you so incredibly strong you've been able to push
310320	319760	through everything even when life gets hard and you always come out on top on the other side don't
319760	333600	you that makes you so very brave in my eyes sometimes you just need reassurance and that's okay
333600	348320	I'm glad to be able to do that for you it's a pleasure in all honesty so thank you for listening
348320	356480	to me the best way that we can support you right now is getting you to sleep I think
356720	367280	it may seem like a small act but a well-rested mind can help navigate what the world has to offer
368800	379840	sometimes it can be confusing why we have a negative experience you may think to yourself why me
380560	386160	why now I present to you a question
389040	395840	if everything in your life was good then would you really appreciate the good times
397920	405680	I think sometimes with the bad it makes the good times even sweeter
406560	416240	that's what I think anyway you might not agree or you might even be asleep by now
417360	427040	just from our whispers alone wouldn't that be adorable humans really do work themselves silly
428000	434240	then I should be extra mindful a pamper you in a pure bliss line
436880	442640	good night dear human get as much rest as you need
442640	460240	it's time to let it all go and enter the deep slumber
