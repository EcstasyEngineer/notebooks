O-re-blank

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
O-re-blank

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Is it time to feel sleepy?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Like how are you playing?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Are you sleepy, baby?

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
You're so cute when you're so sleepy

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
and you got your little morning voice on

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
but it's time to go back to sleep

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you Dominic for becoming a mempa

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Good morning little reflin, but you must be so tired

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
You should go back to sleep

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, you should go back to sleep

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Cos you're my tired baby

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
What do you mean you've never seen my bedroom since debut?

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
You're such a sleepyhead, of course you've seen my bedrooms and staples.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
You want me to tuck you in, in my little clam?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
My little clam bed, behind me.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
It's going to be not in my clam.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
Do you like the way the water wiggles in my bedroom?

02:22.000 --> 02:32.000
Do you find it tantalizing?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
My little reflex.

02:38.000 --> 02:54.000
Look, I have a little 3D on my desk and I have one in front of me too.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Do I need to turn up to make sense of the video?

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Or have I been a good streamer?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, do you like my decorational wall?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
I really have two things I can click.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay, you're on my table.

03:20.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm applying your Risky.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Refling.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Why is it when I go on YouTube,

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
my most recent short of me clapping with no hands, is my most popular content?

03:54.000 --> 04:06.000
What did you do?

04:06.000 --> 04:22.000
What did you do?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Hey girls, it's my most popular content.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
I think I even outpaced the video.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, I'm not apologizing.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Thank you to the doubter who made that clip possible.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
Arissa is my editor and she's hilarious.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
We haven't really spoken to each other at all

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and I just sent her an audio of me clapping and she said,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
yeah, I'll make it a short.

05:04.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm like, yeah, Arissa is a homie for sure.

05:14.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, you look so sleepy.

05:26.000 --> 05:40.000
You look so sleepy like this, I just want to eat you up all for myself.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
And you get all cute and whiny when you're tired as well.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Little boy.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
Is it hard to fight the temptation to fall asleep again?

05:58.000 --> 06:08.000
Especially when I rub on your ears.

06:08.000 --> 06:20.000
I made a little cup of tea.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
Go by hands all over your ears.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
And it's going ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Wow.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Thank you, Dr. Milmi Naman.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Wanna swim more, please?

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
For becoming a member.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
We have been strong and there's a brief stream after this one I need to be a week for.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
Do you know what we're writing about in that naughty stream?

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
We're writing about making honey tea.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
And by making honey tea, I mean honey and tea.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
So you guys get to tell me what you want me to say.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
So I think I'll be very interested in how am I feeling?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Ah, my sleepy baby.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
The reason why I'm role-playing that you're a sleepy baby so successfully

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
is because I woke up seven minutes before stream.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
But my little wreathling.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I did get some sleep, darling.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
I got lots of progress behind the scenes done.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
If I'm not mistaken.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
If, hold on, I need to check if it's even up.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I got lots of background work done.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And I want the video to stop, yeah?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay, well that didn't work.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I think tomorrow?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
There's going to be a seven man collab.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
That comes out soon.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I edited a seven man collab.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
I have secured a fourth highlight slash clipper.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
There should be a new short out on AC and Azura.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
There should be a highlight video out on Marisy.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Thanks to a shadowed or, I think there's a highlight clip of AC.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Thanks to shadowed or everyone's now at 5K.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Ah, my babies, they're growing up so fast.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I can't handle it.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
I will post the celebration 5K artworks

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and I need to find it.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I've lost it.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I commissioned it quite a while ago.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
The Marisy highlight video was good.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Did you like it?

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Where she was anky.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
But Jess, I am very thankful you guys let me get some rest.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
I fell back asleep for five hours

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
and then I woke up and then I worked all the way through until three hours ago

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
and then I lied down for a nap and my alarm got me up.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
And I was basically a zombie making myself a cup of tea.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
But it's okay.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
There's a Yumi Plus collab today.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
So I get to be the grumpy angry Scots in the collab.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And I'm so annoyed.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
One of the girls is from Australia

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
and I joked that I was gonna go to her house

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
and she was like, oh no, you can actually come to my house.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
And of course we don't live in the same zoo.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I hate it.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I could have had my first offline collab.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Like my first feature for offline collab.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Don't get me wrong, I'm bossy enough to show up at someone's door.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm looking funny.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
Madden Vastroni, will the girls pre-recorded SFW ASMR on Tron like yours?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
And will we see any collab on there as well from any other VA's?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I will hold on anonymous.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Let me reread that.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You crazy madman.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Why did you spell it?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Why did you spell it like that?

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Will we see pre-recorded like me?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And will we see any collabs?

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes, Shabby has a collab with a girl coming up.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
That's not in VA lore.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
AC and Emmy have their own collab that's going on YouTube on Emmy's channel.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
Um, Azura might be doing a collab with someone.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I need to set it up.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Basically, if it's an ASMR collab, I have to go set it up.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
The Shabby collab I didn't have to set up.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
But I'm very thankful for the situation that unfolded.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Because it means Shabby gets some time to shine.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Your first girl night ruined by Australia, honestly.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Aren't Dono's supposed to be off?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
I've put them super quiet.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Are they supposed to be off?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
I think if I was like, dry-eyed and

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
dreams of Strony kicking down the Rieveland store

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
for an impromptu and concession,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I think they're asking me, are we on Patreon?

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
What's Madienne, Mahath?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Is it a green?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Hi, Strony.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, the girls is...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
On Tron.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Not the movie.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
See, there's this movie franchise called Tron.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
And it's like about a bike that's blue.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm fucking delirious.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'll wake up shortly, hold on.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'll go drink my tea.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
I can start uploading all the audios on their Patreon as well.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
That will be a me job because I'm not making them to...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Well, they don't even have access to their Patreon, so...

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
That part's impossible anyway.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Thank you for your tip, and please give me some time to do that.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
But yes, it will all be archived on the year.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Appropriate Patreon, so...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm just trying to think of what work I have to do,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
and I bet it's just their meme audios at the minute.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Right?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Right?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Don't push too hard.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Tell me about it.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I finally got like...

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm so angry, but not in a bad way.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
But I'm just angry because...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I did a shorter stream,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
and I got so much work done behind the scenes,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
and I hate it.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I want to stream all the time.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
And because I know July is coming up,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
and my dad's coming over,

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm still so tired, I'm exhausted.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
I had bloodshot eyes yesterday,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
or, yeah, yesterday, which kind of freaked me out a bit.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But because July's coming,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and then I truly am going to do like two or four of our streamers max,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I'm like, I want to make up for it now

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
with all the content to offer.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Because I don't even know...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I don't...

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
If my dad is asleep,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't think I can even do ASMR because he snores.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
But he like, he like,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
snores, like shakes the house, snore.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Speaking of Patreon, your last audio was good.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Did you like it?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Did you like my armpit?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Could you do a stream when you chat and work on stuff in the background?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
You'll never guess what we're doing in two hours.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
We're writing a script that's actually work.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And if you guys like it,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
then we can do more.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay, I finished my cup of tea before it gets too cold.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I'm gonna put you down right here,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
and see what I'm gonna bubble you.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm gonna bubble you.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I was Mercy's latest audio written by you.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Sadly, yes.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
The girls' first two months of content is by me.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And also, please understand,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
I didn't actually know or have the girls,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
when I wrote them, I just had their characters.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So please don't be like,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
oh, this doesn't fit.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Please be so realistic.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
This is a, it's very big.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
It's not something that can be done overnight.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Are you like, gulping ASMR?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Wow.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
She said, wait, what was Mercy's recent?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I can't remember.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You don't like Mercy's?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Why, was there a problem with Mercy's?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Shoulda picked Mercy.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
All the audios I've written have been already.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Feels good, man.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I was really nervous about writing for Emi.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I was like, am I going too far here?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
And I was like, now fuck it, we're already going far enough.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
We created it, so we can just keep going.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Wow.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
What's her name?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Mercy?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Put it in there.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Girlfriend gets crazier in ovulation.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, yeah, I definitely wrote that one, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
You're trying to embarrass me with the scripts, aren't you?

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
Your girlfriend has been waiting so long for you to finally come home and pound her.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Whenever she ovulates, she just can't get enough of your tentacles.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, that's me that wrote that one, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Yes, that's very me that wrote that one.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
The girls have done great for the start of their contents.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
And please understand for a lot of girls,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
this is actually the first time they've ever wrote anything of this ed roll.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
They have recorded anything of this nature, okay?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
So please don't be overly critical.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Don't be that one person that's like, what the heck?

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
Your very first audio doesn't sound like someone who has produced audios for 20 years.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Outrage it.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Now shut the fuck up.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Shut up.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
You literally get four audios for five dollars.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Fucking name one other VA that does that.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
On top of that, they're streaming for free.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
On top of that, they're putting content around Twitter for free.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Like, sorry, I'm arguing with spirits again, but...

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Wait, unfortunately, yes, I did write that.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
The next month's stuff I wrote and then it starts to swap.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
We did have two temporary batches made not by me.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't know how it's gonna go for the girls.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I specifically...

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Sorry, this is just me going on behind the scenes round.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
I specifically commissioned a format.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
And I asked them to mimic the format because I said,

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
not only is this format the best, I will show you the format in the next stream, in the member stream.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I specifically said, do the format like this.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
The girls can record it super easily and they won't lose their place

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
and the editors know what to do when they get to certain sections, okay?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And they didn't do it.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And now I have, I think, eight scripts that are not in the correct format

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
and the poor girl has to figure out what to do.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Because there's no format at them correctly.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
And I'm like, I gave them the example, I explained the importance of the format, so, yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
I'm fighting the ghosts again, I honestly, um...

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
You're doing really well getting everything set up for the start.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes, that's what the...

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
That's what the situation was, was getting set up at the start.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
But thankfully now, oh, my mother was gone.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Thankfully now everything is like set up.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
So I don't have to do fucking anything, okay?

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
It is incredibly difficult and tiring to change someone else's format.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
Don't let the shadow people in your head get you, who's mad at the girls?

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
Well, we got one fucking fanny, and whoever you are, I don't know if you're listening.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
Eh, but we got one fanny, started criticizing the girls by sending a message on the website.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Didn't we eat an absolute fucking fanny?

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
And I'm not being funny, you know for a fact these girls I've never recorded before.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
They're like, eh, no, the deals are this, all the deals are that.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Fucking come complaining on the website, aye.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
So the development team can all fucking read this shit.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
As if I fucking passed on the message to the girls, like, didn't be a fanny.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
It's the first time they've ever recorded these types of audios before.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Like, I'm not having it, I'm not having it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Mummy's not happy.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Like, I just can't be yours to folk like that.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
So I'm kind of fighting ghosts and then I'm fighting one fucking mom.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
I shouldn't say that, but I really can't be yours when someone's like,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
what do you mean any girls aren't producing a 10 out of 10 audio

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
when they're very first day and fucking feel literally go get to fuck, man.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Get the fuck, go post your audio first and let us all dog pile it at once.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Like, go get to fuck.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Sorry, I'm like straight up fighting.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
You would be surprised how unbelievably fucking rude some fannies are.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Anyway, who is it? Oh, someone who obviously was anonymous on the website

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
leaving their dog shit feedback, honestly.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And the girls didn't produce a 10 out of 10.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Oh, I can hear the girls breathing in one of the audios.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, because they have a pair of fucking lungs on them, maybe.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
I'm so sorry, I hate to break it to you, but I've actually got two lungs.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Sorry that they didn't get an operation when they got one lung.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Or fucking speaking to a ventilator, like, go get a fucking grip, man.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Where's my pitchfork, honestly?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
We need your mommy to reach through it, so why?

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Is it weird when I get angry?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
The only time I get angry and start fighting is when someone's talking about the girls,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I'm like, alright then.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
I bet we'll all listen to you fucking knee-lungs McGee over there

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
bet you're on a fucking ventilator and a wheelchair, you little cripple bastard.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Because you can't even fucking form a thought.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
That's a fucking abstract concept.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
But we banned fucking Denny breathing the audios.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
They're breathing in the audios.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I'll get a fucking fuck off, mate.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Did you imagine complaining about breathing?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Ugh, what is this?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm sorry, you have to deal with it, but the silver lining is

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
that your frustration, we learn worse colors.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
We love keeping totally not to make our community worse, honestly.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Better to say most of them have been a bit dimples in their eyes.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I'll leave in a wee dislike.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
Ugh, you're breathing to make a little too hard to stream be.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Strong and hot when she is a little...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
No, let's just protect the mommy coming out.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Honestly, so I'm on the feedback, I'm like...

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm not being funny.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I wish I could do this.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
I wish I could bring the fannies on that say something negative, bring them on,

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
get them to say out loud their little criticism, and be like,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
no, no, no, no, no, say exactly how you said it before.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
And then I'll just fucking elate them on fire.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Not literally, I meant elate them on fire with being like,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
it wouldn't actually be fucking realistic out here.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
So first of all, like, one of the first assignments the girls got was

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
their microphones had to be delivered.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Half of these girls have been using these microphones for two seconds.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Okay, these girls have no experience with these microphones,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
and that's perfectly okay.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Everyone has to start somewhere, okay?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I popped their little microphone cherries on half of this shit.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Anyway, like, oh, no, sorry, I'm starting to get fat.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm not even doing ASMR.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
This happens every time.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh, and label it a fucking ASMR team.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And I just start getting fucking rigid in the middle of it.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Sorry, I'm actually one of them.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I like, when Strenny vints and anchors in around check,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
constant check, and my monkey brain is like,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Scorch!

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Light all of them on fire and maincraft.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yes, maincraft.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Strenny makes fun of a hate comment stream.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
I feel like the amount of swearing, if I even set up that stream,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
like, if I was, I don't know, I don't think we're,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I don't know what's gonna happen with Marshmallow,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
but it'd just be like, alright, haters, time for me to make content,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
for you to pay my bills, leave a hate comment about anything,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
about failure, and then it just turns into a skit,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
it's a funny cramp.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Like, there's no way in heck I would get through that stream

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
without being, like, absolutely screaming down the mic

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
in five minutes, being like, don't be so fucking stupid.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
How you fucking do it?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Do you honestly think this is how I worth finding things?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
How you fucking do it?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That's so dead, like, no.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Like, I'd absolutely, like, everyone would be like,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
what the fuck?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
How does someone so small have so much rage inside of her?

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
Getting protective of her children is extremely hot.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You'd probably get targeted for harassment

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
if I did something like that.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I mean, shit, we're getting harassed.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
We're fucking breathing in the mic.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Daileys get so post-it.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Nah, these aren't real strong, I take your words.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
That would actually be fine.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
We need art and all that sort of outfit.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
A strong ghost hunting, which is punching us.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Someone said, hire a manager to screen marshmallows.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
To spend money to get anonymous comments is pretty rough,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
if I'm being honest.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Dr. King, thank you for the membership.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I appreciate it.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
And then there's a few more.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I mean, you know the drill.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Clearly they've never seen a Chihuahua.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Oh, are you calling me a Chihuahua?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Because I'm we in region.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
I would listen to the veiler through your mic.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I don't even see them.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I don't own the company.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh no, she's shadowboxing again.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Type of YouTube admin, not you though.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Small being read.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I'll cover that for a manager.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Man, I must get in my tributes.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I hate it here.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Just be spending money to protect the girl's mental health.

27:53.000 --> 28:00.000
Well, so the upkeep of the company is like nothing next to nothing.

28:00.000 --> 28:07.000
But if it's like, oh, we need to pay a whole other person to go through these marshmallows.

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
Like, I know it's very nice being able to give like anonymous comments and stuff and feedback on that.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And like, don't get rid of them for now.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
But like, it's just another expense.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
And the whole set up of the 820 split is like, the girls can do whatever extra they want with the money.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
Because obviously the average agency is like 50 or less, I guess.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Not that kind of 50 or less.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I said the 50-50 or whatever.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You know what I mean?

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
They just transfer the cognate hazards to the person's people screen.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
You can relax by using all your rage while you have fun.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Wonderful firecrackers, sirens.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
The other has a very positive and tight-knit community, so far it's been good though.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
You know, their mental fortune is better than we do.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
It would lose a lot of charm, knowing that there's like a literally a third party.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, so that I would actually agree with that as well.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
Like, imagine being like, oh, I've sent my tentacotta mummy.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
And then it's like, it's some poor guy that we're paying.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
We're paying has to like, rate your tentacle.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Like, this is high enough quality.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
The man whimpered, here you go, Strani.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
The reefling whimpered, here's the link.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Can you listen?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
You can sit down, your mirrors are open.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Yes, yes, yes.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I just let things simmer first.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
I mean, do you want VLR management for your pack or your little tentacle?

30:06.000 --> 30:13.000
My morning voice, my woke up seven minutes before stream voice after the nap.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
Or pay like, let me see if I can tap your ears a little.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Anywhere.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Um, here in the afternoon.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
My tentacle is a Strani exclusive.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Sounds good.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
So I managed to get mech assault work in, so we're definitely on for a mech assault stream.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
Um, I'm taking a pause for a week on Elden Ring.

31:02.000 --> 31:15.000
Um, and just because we have two insurance streams over in Scape, to try and bash out these wines.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
But I'm getting nervous, I don't know if I can do it.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
I freaking saw Narissa from Hollow Live is doing prayer.

31:25.000 --> 31:37.000
And I think she's doing the altar as well with dragon bones and getting, and getting, uh, it's not Jailbirds for Narissa.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Wait, is it Jail? No.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Um, to like, run her dragon bones.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh mommy, I saw the new thumbnails there, correct? I want to use them as a desk, huh?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
I'd admit it, the real reasons, the reasons can help finish the DLC for you.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
All right, mech assault one and two, my child.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
They made a mech assault two.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I don't think they made a mech assault two.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
Okay, well we approve comments together on YouTube.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
RuneScape is, Strani is the RuneScape chance there.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, it's Jailbirds.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Ah, newest Jailbirds. That's right, I know my features.

32:16.000 --> 32:25.000
I was a very brave girl yesterday on Twitter, and I applied myself for one of those trends,

32:25.000 --> 32:36.000
where it's like, put your model, and we might do, it's by Frame and Ebay Shrimp,

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
and they're making Wim Tattoos, so I posted my full model view,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
which a lot of people don't get to see.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
It's on my Twitter, the link's in the description.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
If you just check out my replies on Twitter, you'll see it,

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
because yeah, I do not show the full view of my, is this room dark enough?

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Maybe the room is dark enough for me to get away with it, hold on.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
Hi, I'm Strani, this is my room.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
I don't show it often for reasons, but yeah, this is me.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
How did I do that?

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
You're supposed, no, microphone.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Sorry.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
The microphone's not supposed to go big.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
But yeah, I don't normally show that, because, yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
That was a brave girl, and, oh, that was a brave girl,

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
and like, put myself under one of those posts,

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
because I'm like, oh, hi, I'm Strani, I'm a weirdo,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
but thank you for the opportunity for the Wim Tattoos.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
Wim Tattoos, it's just a Scottish flag, honestly, if they even knew that.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
I'd be very surprised if they knew I was Scottish.

34:13.000 --> 34:21.000
And then I sent a VTuber, a message, a DM request for an ASMR collab,

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
but I sent it to someone that doesn't follow me, but that has open DMs.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
And they were like, oh, looking to make friends.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh, wait, I'm gonna do it.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
They were looking to make friends, and I asked for an ASMR collab.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I'm a fucking twat.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
She was asking to make pals, no fucking compatriots.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
Wim Tattoos that says, no got a fucking clue what that means.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It's a microphone now.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
I thought you were going to intentionally have them make cover of the area.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Ooh, I'm happy, I knew I was such a brave girl.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
But yes, we have a member's script writing stream.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
I'll see how it gets received.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
If it gets received well, that'll help out a lot.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm not even pretending, that'll help out so much.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
I have you guys script writing streams, because it looks so bad.

35:36.000 --> 35:45.000
But I made so much progress yesterday, and then I get to do the next seven group collabs.

35:46.000 --> 35:55.000
That may or may not be on a certain feature-proof ASMR account.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Peaches, it's peaches, I can't show up, it's peaches, I peaches.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
I mean, you can make friends over ASMR.

36:04.000 --> 36:11.000
I know that whenever I do a message for ASMR, I'm always super up front, and I'm just like,

36:11.000 --> 36:19.000
Hi, I'll make the collab, and I'll write it, and I'll edit it, and everything else that we don't buy me.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm a professional relationship type thing.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Don't forget about the stream delay during member's stream?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Yeah, you guys can tell me what you want me to put.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I'll do the b-paul thing, if you want to.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Me, I see a certain sense.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Wait, the seven man collab line up?

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Hold on, let me type in the name.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Oh, my stomach is-

36:56.000 --> 37:03.000
It's up, it's breaking up, okay.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
The girl's seven man collab is all those boo-boo-boo-boo.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
If you want to hear seven ASMR girls together, you can open that up and then pause on the side if you want.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
And leave it a like when you listen to it and stuff.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
Okay, so that's the second of four seven man ASMR collabs.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
The next one is peaches.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
As in dream of peaches, yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But you can open that up.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Yes, demon in me.

37:50.000 --> 37:58.000
I think the girls might make a solo ASMR roleplay with the look or something.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Because the art came out pretty good.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Unfortunately, Jaffa Redwood's colour blind and he keeps fucking me up.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
You can listen to that later, alligator.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Make sure to like and subscribe.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah, if you like ASMR, you can subscribe to me by the way.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I have lots of ASMR coming.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
Okay, I'm going to approve of comments on YouTube.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I will read them out to you.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
Four minutes ago, someone commented H on my short.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
That just came out, so I'll approve that.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
Someone posted on the Mamusa collab a sleeping emoji.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
We will approve.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
Someone on my debut, but posted double of hearts.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Feels good man.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
I have a treat for you all this Saturday.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
I hope you're ready for Saturday.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
There's a treat on everyone's channel on Saturday.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
So look out for that.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
It will be on everyone's channel and it will come out like 10 minutes apart.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
So you have to watch as they get released totally.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
That's how it works, right?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
What is approving comments?

39:34.000 --> 39:41.000
So when you comment on my channel, it disappears, but it doesn't really.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
It shows up in my little approval section and I get to read all the comments and approve them.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
So I quite literally read every single comment.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
Someone says, Microsoft, that brings back memories on my schedule.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Someone's saluted the clapping without hands.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
It's a more video because it got deleted.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
Someone said, power claps are over 9000.

40:09.000 --> 40:16.000
Someone says, you know you have a giant cake when you make this kind of noises down.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
That broke the sudden barrier.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I got you and enjoyed it.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Oh my lord, the cake is not a lie.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Nope, we aren't doing portal out here.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
It's all in the thighs safely.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
And then someone said rip to the actual original clapping video.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Am I working on more?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
I'm like, yes.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
So I see an Emmy haven't been approved and they're being made.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I've sent away Shibi's request.

40:54.000 --> 41:02.000
I need to get Azura to tell me what batch attend she wants and then I need to use my brain power.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
If someone can tweet me what my emotes were in batch 2, that'd be great.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
I don't have access to Marshmallow because someone did it on Marshmallow.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Let's see.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Why does listening to your talk make my head spin?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Is it because I'm Scottish?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Is it because it's weird here?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Words said a bit differently.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
I'm excited for Among Us with Yume Plus.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Oh, you're gonna hear the wrath of the Scots real quick and that's true.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
That's where one of them accuses me of being it when I'm not it.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
When someone accuses me of being it when I'm not it, I'm like absolutely screaming region.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
Me when I'm it but accusing someone else of it.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
I've got my latex gloves on.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Can you tell I've got a latex glove on?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
What's the tentacle on the wall for anyway?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It's totally decorational.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
We're not wearing functional hair again.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Okay.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
Today is Patra's day so you have three streams today

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
and you're already listening to one of them right now.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Good to me.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
I promise I'm a certified nurse.

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
I'm just checking out your ears to make sure you've got good tail in your ears.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
And what about this ear?

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
This ear clearly is deficient in tingles.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
I know what I can do in order to fix this.

43:23.000 --> 43:30.000
I will administer five cc's of tingles to hold your breath mister.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I'll save you.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Okay.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Wow.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
What are you gonna do with them glues?

43:56.000 --> 44:05.000
Nurse Ronnie's will the tingles result in a main break?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, main break.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Today's more script stream goes well.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
Maybe we can write a main break together

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
and I'll show you our hypnosis stuff.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
Okay, let me inspect your ear again for any tingles.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Wow.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay, you tingled a little bit.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Can you feel my breath on your ear?

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
We need to administer even more tingles.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
What can we do?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I'm looking.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Why?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I can clean them.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
I'd like me to pick up my handy-dandy tool

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
because you need to tingle or else you're gonna perish for some reason.

45:04.000 --> 45:12.000
In the world's 26th day, if you do not tingle once a day, you fall into a coma.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Surely she wouldn't make the break.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
If you were a nurse, I would always want to be sick.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Any chance the girls will play a game together?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Yes, we actually posted it in the discord.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
So, quite possibly.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Okay.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
I think you're tingling a little, so I'm returning to normal in this ear,

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
which is good news.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Very, very good news.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Wow, wow, wow.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
There we go.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
Slow and steady went to tingle it.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Breathing a little.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Please make me gentle.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
I have no idea how this among us collapse is gonna go.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
I was like, so when, if you didn't know, I'm gonna teach you.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Okay?

46:37.000 --> 46:47.000
I'm gonna teach you the insider knowledge, which is when you do group collabs or collabs of that nature,

46:47.000 --> 46:57.000
you show up one hour before this stream time to sort out any connection problems of a discord DM.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Always makes me nervous.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I'm like, oh god, the girls okay?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Okay, the girls are not dying.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
This is fantastic news.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
I love it when the girls aren't dying.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
It's my favorite thing.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
I was getting so nervous.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I'm like, why have I been ahead?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Every day I come.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Oh, sorry.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I should have finished that sentence there.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
Every day I come home and get stuck locked by VLR ASMR streams.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
Bro, can I say that every collab is so unlucky?

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
It's like every...

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Bro, I am still so mad at the pepper washer devs.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
Not only do they lock free play mode multiplayer behind the campaign,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
we can't even connect each other.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Am I made it safely?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Is she in the Bahamas or some shit?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I don't even know where she is.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
She just put on the team-up schedule.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I'm away and I'm like, as long as you're safe,

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
that's all that's important to me as long as you have fun.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
I actually don't know where she's looking like.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Amy's in heaven otherwise.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
It's like I can still hear her.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
What do you mean?

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm right here, big brother.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Amy, are you not supposed to be on holiday?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Oh, yeah, sometimes.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Amy, go be on holiday and relax.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
My main place would be...

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Sometimes I can still hear her voice.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
Amy, Amy, are you there?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Yeah.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Oh, who the fuck?

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm communicating with her right now telepathically.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Amy, what do you want to say to the pentpals?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Thank you for denying me.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Amy, Amy, you can't say that out loud.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
That's the quiet part out loud.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Maybe it's Jill.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
Amy, I'm sure.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It's like she never left.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Amy, is that you?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Is it so cold out here?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Ah, fuck it, why not?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Right, Amy, what kind of tingle do you want to do?

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
I don't have a fucking clue.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Alright, Amy, that doesn't help this collab.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Fuck it, we'll do something, alright?

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Have a boo, you kiss the pentpals.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
You know?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Well, that collab went well, don't you think?

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
That was the quickest and easiest collab in my life.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
Now I can clickbait this stream with Amy's shoulder on it real quick.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
There's just Amy and the Beast.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
There's just Amy and the Beast in the room with us.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
Strongly, the accident was a year ago.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
You have to let Amy go.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
No, not my little sister.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
I've pressed down on your ears a little bit.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
I've pressed on your ears a little bit, okay?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Amy, see me?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Went into a power washer.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
I think power washer would have to be a four-man collab.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
As soon as we got more than four people in the game,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
the game was like no avana.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
No one can collab with me at this time, ever.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I'll do it myself.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
I say, I say, come in for a minute.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
No, what do you want?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Strongly, I'm tired.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I just finished streaming.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
I see, I see, do you want to hear it again?

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I'm going to do some more ASMR.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
But Strongly, my voice is broken.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I can't.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Right, well, I tried.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I tried Snow Berries, but AC can't make it.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Strongly, you just went near all of these.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
That's it, I'll get Azura, and hold on.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Azura?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Azura?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
They're one, yeah.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
To do more ASMR with me.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
I look good when I'm pressing Azura, it's just a moment.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Oh wait, no, I said no.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Oh no.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Wait a minute, how am I typing in chat right now?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
This isn't possible.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
You're teasing us, are you?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
What the fuck are you typing in chat?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I don't stream at the same time.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
AC, how are you?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Do you got your phone out?

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
No.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Someone's pretending to be me on stream.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
The whole ASMR is stopped here, and there's already so much of it.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
AC is feeding the masses with ASMR.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
Literally, my impression of Azura is just...

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I can't.

53:22.000 --> 53:29.000
My sweet, bleeding heart.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That's a bit of it, I know.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Strongly is joystick there too.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Yeah, they're long with one little bit of it.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
As well as Karambit.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
And Strongly365.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Oh, the terrible one.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Hold on, I'll chat to the latex.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Azura's too mummy for you.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Would you mean my deadpan accent?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Can you do our mouth voice?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Would you, I mean, no.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I just don't stream, what's going on?

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I'm pretending to be all...

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
No, sorry, I'm proving that I'm all avirable right now.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
Amy was on stream earlier, you just missed it by a ball here.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Actually, she's just gone away on holiday,

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
she's just jumped on the plane, but she was in my room as I had to go.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh, it's Stacy Milka, and how can you forget?

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Wait, we'll see if I can get Amy again,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
even though she's on a plane right now.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Amy.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
What the fuck is Amy's voice again?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Hold on.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Big brother.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
It's actually just called V strongy, this company's a veil.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
It's not real.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Strongy can't hurt you.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Strongy with her 18 billion personas.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Azura's natural rasp is hard to nail.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Oh yeah, do you want me to fuck it?

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I'm gonna go put on Azura right now.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
Azura de ule de lu e.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
Okay, so I've typed in Azura de lu e, so over for you fuckers.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Let's see, live.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
Ah, Azura de ule de lu e.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
That's a new short out, let's go.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Right, let's see what her ASMR was.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Don't be afraid to talk in this video, Azura.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Okay, Azura actually doesn't talk much in her fucking reals,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
it's just a stray then.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
So I can mimic her voice.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Azura shy, geez.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I'm gonna have to spank her.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Hey Azura, you need to start talking in your streams more

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
so I can mimic you during an ASMR section of mine.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Thanks, that'd be great.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
You know what, I'm gonna put our trailer on,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
because I know for a fact she speaks in her trailer.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Get route, videos.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Trailer, let's go.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
I hope you still have room in your heart

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
for a coach goddess like me.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
For I am Azura de ule,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
and I hope you can join me soon

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
on some tantalizing discussions together.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
I'm just drew a copy in her trailer.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
I played it, I don't know, I mean,

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
I played it, I don't know.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Yeah, I know, I'm muted to death though.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Her late is short, should I give her her late is short ago?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Someone told me

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
my voice is so soothing

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
that I could read out a dictionary.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
So we're going to try today.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Says Veeler here.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I'm all of Veeler.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Okay, there we go.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Oh, that's good.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
What was that actually?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Are you guys just hyping me up?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Wait, are you guys being serious?

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Are you hyping me up or can I actually mimic Azura as well?

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
No Veeler, it's just, she is veeler.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Holy goat, you're actually pretty good looking impressions.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Oh, wait until you do that.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I'm going to hear Marcia's lovely impression.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I'm going to shit you up with her.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It's funny, Azura sounds like someone else.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
No, you're supposed to say I sounded like her.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Right today,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and that means

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
to make something better.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
You actually sounded like her.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Hype me up, hype me up, give me more delusions,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
give me more personas.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
Veeler will decide your fate.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I am Veeler.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Boy, better than expected.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Now try Mercy Modest.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Sorry, I'll try Mercy Modest.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Mercy Modest.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
I think Marcia's the only accent that doesn't compliment me.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Which is terrible.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
Right, let's listen to a short from Marcia.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Okay.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Sorry, don't send that easily.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Don't worry.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Oh, but she's like, I'm trying on solar.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
What's her trailer?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Debut and turn first?

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
What better story than that of a modest young student?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
No, she's not like that.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
Turn violent and dairy overnight.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Mercy's pretty unique, that's hard.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I didn't always look...

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
I've not gone up.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Mercy's too really difficult.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Mercy's really difficult.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
She...

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I can do Mercy's laugh like that.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
Sorry, that was really loud.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
So now you already have a mommy voice when you talk to yourself.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Someone was like, you're disappointed.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Mommy voice like, shit me up in your fucking...

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
On your...

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Elden Ring stream.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
They were like, scared of how disappointed I sounded.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Can we hear your best straw necks?

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Fuckin' thing.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I'm Scottish.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
Mercy's too yandere in my mic, unless you're also yandere.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Do your catchphrase.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
I'm Mercy Modest, and on my ass you will feast.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
That's not my kohei, just a manic laughter.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Gosh, Scottish girls make me melt.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Actually, too, will be.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Try Shavey.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Right, let's...

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Oh, I need a fart.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Attuded.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I just want to report for any bread breakers.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I'm technically on day five.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Give up for day five of having constipation.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Right, Shavey.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Shavey, get out of there, out in the open.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Okay, let's listen to her debut.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Oh fuck, she's deep voiced as well.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Like, I knew that about...

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Oh, hold on.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I'm Shavey Cottonbum, the madam of the sister...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Ah, fuck, I don't have that.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I hope I can take off a lot of boxes for you.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Such as ropes, milk, bunny.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah, I know, I get that.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
No shit dune challenge.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Starting at some point, it's gonna need to be scooped out.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Do you know why it's called the scooping room?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's because you scoop shit in it, you dumbass.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Sister location for Netflix hilarious.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And I won't have any other...

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
...literations.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Get to day nine and you can pretend it's just straight up gender.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Bro, my stomach is so big right now.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Yeah, you need to really deep for Shavey.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
You do a good mouth voice.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
You want a Scottish mouth? How do I do a Scottish mouth?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Well, I know how to do a Scottish mum.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Away and fucking clean your room.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That's a Scottish mum, but not a Scottish mouth.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Oh, darling, have you been naughty?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Or do you need to clean your room?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Or are you needing a mouth like me to come in and help you?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I can do lots for you.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Pinned over the bed and pick up all the stuff that's on the rack.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
For half a year some more, man.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Yeah, what do we do?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Join the animatronic family.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
We open the rail soon.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Your tummy's big, sorry, my bad.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
A circus baby.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Do you know why?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It's called the scooping room.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I just love the way she says it.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It's like, you fucking idiot.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Well, I wasn't ready for the mummy video.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I need to renew my passport.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Why do you need to renew your passport?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
What triggered in your head to need to renew your passport in this monster?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
How many days will you get before the doctor?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Oh, I just need to give my...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Not to be nasty.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But if you ever have trouble with your back door,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
just get a little enema kit.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Enema, enema, give them an enema.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I'm really stuck.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Because if you like playing in the back door,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
that's what you do.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Sorry, your mouth voice is too powerful.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
That's hostile.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It's just the facts.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Sorry, you're getting educated against your will.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Okay.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Oh, the face tracking thinks the ace cube,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the ace globe is my face.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Hold on, it's missing up a little bit.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Circus baby, you had to ask the Scottish scooping room

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
because you had to have a thing scooping in it.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's not that complicated.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Hey, Stroney, how's the stream don't...

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Don't, just don't.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
How's the stream don't...

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Sorry.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Just don't do it, stop it.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
24 hours fast though,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
if you have a lot planned, learn that hard way.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
No, you don't need to fast.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Minor spelling mistake.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Spotted everyone pointing that.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We're kidding, I'm teasing.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I think I might like the Scottish lady's voice,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
because I'm Scots.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Minor spelling.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Teasing, I'm teasing.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
My mouth is tracking to the ace globe.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You stop that.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Go to fuck, they sleep.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Go to fuck, they sleep.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Oh, I'm doing a song cover.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I might be able to do it

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and record the raw vocals after.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The Yumi plus, if I don't go too crazy.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Although basically whenever I finish streaming

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
for the day I go to bed now.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Because I got so much work done.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So much work done yesterday.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's recommended to fast if you go spelunkin'.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Have a mesmerizing time, everyone.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Wish I could stay for the script writing stream,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but I'm sure the time is fantastic.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It will be the stream will remain up,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
because we'll use substitutes like tentacle and ink.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And we're just talking about honey tea.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
That's all.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I just need to make a little bit of honey tea.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We'll have my sleep on.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Angry Scots talks you in a bed.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
See you, you're another one.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You never sleep at night, what's going on with you?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Like a frickin' insomnia.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Don't be up on that male twin and gummies

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
that all them Americans are on about all the faking time.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No, let me talk you in real nice and tidy

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and get your act up so you can faking go to sleep.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Because I've had enough of you been awake all day.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Faking clean the whole house.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Clean the whole bloody house and what do I get in the town?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Faking you coming over.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Cuttin' faking toast on the bunker.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
On the bunker, as if there's any plates available.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
As if you can't just use a wee bit of kitchen roll.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Do you know what the worst thing that really annoys me?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
That you do.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
See the fuckin' butter?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
See the fuckin' butter?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
When you make toast and then you use the knife

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
to spread the butter and then you put the knife back in the butter.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
So now the butter has fuckin' toasty bread

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
comes all over it.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Like it actually does matter to me.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Anyway.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
That's what Scottish Rage ASMR would sound like.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Ugh.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I'm frickin' struggling to find an artist as well.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
To do all my crazy things.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I've still not ordered the pregnancy artwork.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And...

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I want it to come out a really good way

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
but I don't have an artist to do it.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I want...

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
She's not acting anymore.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Strutting the record.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Twisted crumbs and butter are the worst.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I'm sorry about the butter.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
She's not acting anymore.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You know I'm not acting because my dad's coming over

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and that's exactly what he does.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
My mum used to get on it all the time for it

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and he used to be like,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
oh but I'm making toast for my breakfast

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
before I go to work.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Like he didn't see the issue with having crumbly

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
butter.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Alert of the classic lure pack fam.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
We love a bit of lure pack.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Pregnancy ASMR would be my best.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I know mum can cook literally tummy-sits

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and I'm saying how proud I am of you

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and I can't wait to see

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
everything you accomplish in the world

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and how you navigate that

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
and how big and strong you're gonna be

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
and I'm gonna look forward to

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
the sleepless nights that you keep me awake

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
after you're born because

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I know you're not always gonna be in the newborn stage

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
before I know it you'll be walking

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
you'll be babbling

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
you'll start having your own personality

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
and interest and it's gonna be so cute.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And then I'm gonna get all emotional

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
because I'll be like one day I'll hold you

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
and then I'll never hold you again

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
because you're all big and grown up

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
my little weifling, no.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But yes, I need to find an artist

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
that's willing to draw something like that.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
If not I might have to go to Fiverr

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
but Fiverr is always such a gamble

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and I don't want to gamble on the artwork

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
because it means so much.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
To make it.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
The one where we're the father and the child?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yes.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I'm not supposed to cry.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Stop it.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
No, don't cry.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It's supposed to be like a fun goofy day or something.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But yeah, if I get a good sleep

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
after the Yumi Plus collab

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
then I have a feeling

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that the next 2000 days

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
some more collab's gonna be up.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
There's no one available on Skib.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I have never used Skib

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
because apparently you can't even talk

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
to the person in the commission

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and I'm like,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
if I'm paying for something

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and I'm not allowed any corrections

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
unless I'm paying like a literally

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
cheapest chips for it

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I'm too scared to use Skib.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Like, per Emi

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
she wanted some artwork Skib

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
or something we're planning while she's away

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and then she was like,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
oh fuck it, I'll just draw it myself

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
because she was like,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
it's gonna get too much of a headache

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
because she was like,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
it's really unreliable

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
because she,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I think she's used it before

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
and it's unreliable or something.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
There's also Vegen.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I fucking hate Vegen.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's alright but I also hate it at the same time.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I really wanna take responsibility right now

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
what, forget me pregnant

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and being in my tummy at the same time?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
It's the reason that Skib's actually really cheap.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Oh, maybe,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
maybe I should look at Skib.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'd like to get the girls like artworks

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
just like here and there like,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I don't know if you saw,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I got Mercy this artwork.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It was just a doodle artwork

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
so it's quite cheap overall.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And it was her and Serenity together.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Why do you hate Vegen?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Because I thought so, since they were all,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
whenever I commissioned someone on Vegen,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I fucking messaged them on Twitter

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and asked for the commission

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
because it's such a fucking nightmare.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Trying to like send the request off.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I'd rather message on Twitter and be like,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
are you gonna accept this request?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
If yes, like please let me know

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and I'll say like, here's my username

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
on Skib, on Vegen.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Because I kind of be arse filling out

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
the fucking, fucking mile long essay

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
just for them to reject it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I get why it's set up like that

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
but I'm like, go and get to fuck honestly.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
We just got here,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
what are you people talking about?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
We're talking about making an artist request

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
because I don't really have an artist

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
that I want to draw me pregnant with a refling.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
There's no other way to say it.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I need to be drawn pregnant with a refling.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I'll always take responsibility

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
with a refling.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Why do you know all of my buttons?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I absolutely hate those.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It's terrible right now.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I'm cleaning your ear again.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Ah, because all the steps

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I was thinking of trying to draw in Vegen.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
This is good.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I think if you're a creator on it

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
it's very good.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Although there's been a lot of feedback

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
about how it's like next time

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
possible to get a refund.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
So yeah, oh my voice just cracked.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
All of the artists I've worked with

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
ended up adding me on Twitter

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
or Discord, it's just so much easier.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Honestly, the guy that made all our banners

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
he's called Waltz with me

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I'm like, would he be crazy enough

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
to draw me pregnant with a refling?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I think he might.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
If I give him a reference.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I think I might ask Waltz with me

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
to do the pregnant one.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I'm trying to be given that hot-tooth.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Why doesn't Jaferero want to draw pregnant with me?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I've been...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Jaferero has been

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
drawing me a bit manly

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the last few commissions

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
and they came to keep having to correct

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and be like, please stop drawing me

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
as a man.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Please stop drawing me if I was on Twitter.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And it's kind of got to the point where it's like...

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Yeah.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So I'm kind of looking to spread my artist wings

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
at the moment.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Try giving a reference.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Mysteries called Fish Peppers, I guess.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Yeah.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Waltz is good to work with.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
What?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
No, Jaferero would do...

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Oh no, he's like there for anything else.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And he's like, what do you want?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And I'm like this and he's like

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
okay, I guess.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But yeah, recently

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I've been getting drawn as a man

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
like a big thick neck, a big massive chin

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and I'm like

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
kind of corrected a few times

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and it's

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
it's not really

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
being changing.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And I'm just like

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
yeah.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
So yeah.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I'm going to try and spread my artist wings

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
a little bit.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Then

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm sure there'll be a few more things

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
from Jaferero Pop.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
They can all be winners, you know.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
The style changed a bit.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah, no, artist style changed all the time.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Which is not a problem

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
but

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
something that changes

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
outside of like

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
a barrel chest and huge arms

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
the princess carry.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I'm not sure

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
how many more to draw.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Yeah.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So I'll see if

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Waltz, I think Waltz is

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Japanese.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I don't know if you guys

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
know this but the Japanese

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
yen is crashing.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Like

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
absolutely crashing at the minute.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Maybe I should do skips

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
yeah, it's like completely crashing

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
at the minute.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
So maybe yeah, skips would be

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
way cheaper than usual but I've never used the

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
website before.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I hate

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
having to learn how to use

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
new websites.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
But

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I'm playing with the

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
ball crusher.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Wait, the yen's crashing?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Yeah, like I think against the dollar

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the yen just continues to go down.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Like it's something weird.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I don't know why.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's a really good time to buy Japanese stuff.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Wow.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Good time to visit as well.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Up in

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the Sakura Park

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I feel like we'd be so disruptive though.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
We need to be quiet. We need to whisper.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
It's been down since Covid but it's currently

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
at as low as it's like 50 cent time.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
The dollar.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
The what crusher?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
The ball crusher.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I have this like sensory toy

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and I squish it and stuff

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and it feels really nice to squish.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
So it is being dubbed to the

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
ball crusher.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Japan economy

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
nothing great. I wonder if the birth rate

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
of Japan is? I assume it's down as well.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Is there any first world

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
country that doesn't

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
have

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
a declining birth rate?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I want to say no. Maybe?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
No. America.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
America as opposed to birth rate?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Maybe.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I'm not sure.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Anything above one is good.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It is insufficient.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Time to leave to Japan and we'll be right to there.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Will we all go to Japan?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I don't know. Can you farm?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Yeah, you can farm in Japan.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But I don't think they have castellos the way

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Scotland has castellos.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Can you

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
choose a nicer name

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
than why I'm making you nervous?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Streamer has too much fun

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
playing with the ball crusher.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
ASMR.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
America is on the down

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
as well.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I can take care of that declining birth rate.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I remember there was a post

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
where it was like, I don't know if it was just

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
an onion headline. Probably was, let's be

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
honest. Of course that would fall for an onion

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
headline. It was like Japan's

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
declining birth rate

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
makes visas

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
for foreigners easier

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and then someone was like, step aside.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
This is a job for me.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I'll fix the birth rate.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
But that's the thing about

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
being a sperm donor. If you didn't

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
know, you're actually not allowed to

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
have more, you're not

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
allowed to have more than

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
20

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
children, but someone

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
recently, well not recently,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
it made the news like a year or so ago

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
in America, he'd use

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
different names at sperm banks, so he would have

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
like a massive lineage

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
and he got caught doing it. I don't know

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
if he got jail time for it, because you're not

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
supposed to pollute the pool like that

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
or else it would be like a Genghis Khan moment.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Everyone's like, huh, how strange.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
We're all seem to be related to Genghis Khan, I wonder why.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And it was like, my guy, have you

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
even hair to half the stuff that man did?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Sorry, you clean

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
your ears after all the filth I just

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
spoke there, hold on.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Okay, there we go.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Much better.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Can't be speaking about

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
that stuff right now, that's what we're

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
revealing.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
That one guy

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
that snuck around

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
dozens of places, yeah,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
so you didn't know about it.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Japanese birth rate

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
is so low that the previous prime minister

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
became a meme

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
for trying to boost the

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you would think

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
immigration would be easier to the birth rate.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I heard that Japan's racism

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
is pretty strong.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It's just

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
quite funny

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
since it's like, that kind of seems

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
like the solution.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
America's birth rate is only

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
because of immigration.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
One of our states, Alabama,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
has had its first statewide population

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
decline in the sense of

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
speak more filth.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
We enjoy it.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
There's a reason his lineage

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
spread far and wide.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Exactly.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
In a real article, Japan

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
released a dating app

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
for people who are looking for

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
committed relationships to get married

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and have children.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So like, the opposite

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
of any other

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Western countries

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
dating apps.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Imagine hundreds of years later

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and there are historians wondering

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
who this singular man

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
who has a 20-way pattern formed

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
or Japan is almost

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
allergic to immigration.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I used to watch lots of videos

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
from Japanese YouTubers.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
There's this girl called Shaila

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
in Japan, or Shadamander.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
It's kind of like her nickname.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And she talks about Japan a lot.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
She talks about running

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
a bed and breakfast series, which is

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
really cute. She renovated a house

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
into like a Neko

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
bed and breakfast and they were so

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
cute.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I find it quite sweet

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
and adorable.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Japan started using China to

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
increase the birth rate. That's sad.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Eh?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
You mean modern day?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Or do you mean

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
the history we do not speak of?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Shinzo Abe

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
is no longer asking.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That reminds me, I made a meme for

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Emi of that. I don't think she's ever posted it.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Before I met

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
the girls, I made like a few memes for them

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
each to post on Twitter if they wanted to

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
because I was like, I have no idea what they want to do

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
on Twitter. And one of the tweets

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
is a, one of the

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
meme pictures is Emi holding a gun

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and she's like, I'm no longer asking her

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
things.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Japan has multiple dating apps for gamers

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
and mates that are all owned and run by the

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
government.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
It's giving

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
date or you shouldn't have your hand

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
over it.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
A declining birth rate is a good thing.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Our planet can't sustain all of us.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I, I thought

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
our planet could sustain us is because

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
of what we do to it. Like, we can't

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
sustain. Not that we want

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
infinite growth of humans, but

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
like,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I thought

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
someone

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
draws vtuber's prego.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Are they cheap for this?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Are they gonna draw me holding my belly

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
all happy

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
in smiling and then a little

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
rifling attached to me in like a

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
little insane shot with a rifling

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
in the umbilical

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
card?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Are they gonna do it?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
You made memes for them?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.520
memes for them. I made memes, I wrote their ASMR scripts, I wrote some of the shorts.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:35.720
I think Amy's the only one that has shorts up that I didn't write like her story about

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.600
that haunted house and she got grabbed in the middle of her sleep as she slipped next

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:47.160
to her mum. She did some stuff that I didn't make. But everything else the girls have done

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.880
I made. And they're all kind of waiting on me, but I'm going to spank them and be like

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.760
ok, your debut period is over now, you need to start thinking about doing stuff for yourself

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.600
because I can't be doing it for everyone. But yes, I tried to set them up as best I

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.440
can and it certainly worked out. If we've all hit 5000 subscribers in our first month

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:15.560
that's fantastic. Pregnancy is kind of so wholesome, I don't know why it has a stigma.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.160
Probably because the child is a parasite on the woman. Did you know that the reason why

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.440
women forget that childbirth is so painful is because that's an evolutionary trait to

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.760
trick you into wanting more children. Even though it's the most traumatic experience

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.840
and most dangerous thing you will ever go through in your entire life as a woman.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:43.000
Eee-dee! Science Facts with Stormy. Would you like more science facts about pregnancy?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.920
The child, the body diverts as much nutrition to the child first or parasite as I like to

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.360
call it. Which leaves some mothers who lose their teeth, lose their hair, lose some of

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:05.360
their sight. Yeah, it's pretty rough if you want to be pregnant out here.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:17.240
Teach them how to fish. Biology 101. Yes, pregnancy is absolutely terrifying. If you

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:24.320
actually know what goes on behind, how easy it is to hemorrhage, die in childbirth. Even

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:32.200
C-sections, how it leaves you with a lifelong inability. Pregnancy also damages your bladder,

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.960
it also damages your back passage during the birth. You can quite literally create one

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:48.080
singular rip in between the panini and the baby. So yeah, don't, don't recommend pregnancy.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:53.000
Congrats if you want to go through it. It will turn your nips brown. That's the only thing.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:02.160
So if you're used to them being pink, don't be surprised. They change color. Life is just

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:10.440
suffrax and honestly, do not be a whammin' and do not get pregnant is my advice. I was

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.240
in the room when my youngest bro was being birthed. It's a horror for, oh, it is not

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:20.840
for the faint of heart. It is not. And like, if we're not memin' for a second, you know

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.360
how the meme's like, oh, would you rather get punched in the balls or birth a child?

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:36.040
And then like, oh, I'm a C-section baby. You're removed like a chipper. That's a fact

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:42.600
why I've never heard before. Oh, it's so dangerous. It's unbelievably dangerous. Wait,

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:48.880
what did I just come into? I'm currently ranting about how dangerous pregnancy is whilst trying

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:57.480
to harass an artist to draw me pregnant with you. So you're gonna be in my tummy and I'm

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:02.400
gonna make a weird ASMR where you hear my tummy sounds and I'm talking to you and saying

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:11.120
how much I love you and I can't wait till you should come out and achieve all these things.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:21.240
My nips are already brown. Well, then you make me a different race than me, then. Unfortunately,

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:27.640
I'm as pale as they come. My nips practically blend in, honestly. Sorry, this isn't an ASMR.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:39.640
I'm just fucking ranting about pregnancy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did you guys get DM'd

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.800
by that feature that wants you to draw a pregnant tooth? Trying to get around Vore, but still

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:53.800
want to use the sense that it's pregnant, eh? There's a reason diet and childbirth is a

01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:02.160
common trope. It is. You can also get a thing called coffin birth. If a mother who is, her

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:08.600
ego is pregnant when she passes away and so does the child, the buildup of guesses actually

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.480
expelled the child on that has been dubbed coffin birth. Just thought you should know.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:22.040
Not very nice. Aye. What's that? I'm just like an endless source of repeating things I've

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:34.040
heard or learned. Sheesh. Okay, let me actually do this. I'm sorry for freaking you about

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:39.480
the facts about me being pregnant after you made me pregnant. Refling, okay? I'll stop

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.480
scaring you. Thank you for being brave, your mommy's bravest soldier.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:13.480
ASMR. Let's learn each front name and I'm not ASMR, because let's be honest. Wow.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.800
ASMR.

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.800
Where's the Vore ASMR?

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:45.240
I wanted to do giant test 4 with a zero. I didn't write the script yet. Well, I

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.480
don't think I'll be writing the script the whole of this, right?

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:57.320
I could definitely do a siren. Vore's you. Giant siren, because I'm a siren. But I'm

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:03.160
actually a cowfish. See, I'm a siren that can't sing, so I had to use something else.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.800
And then I went for hypnotic abilities, so then I became a cowfish. I don't know.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.280
Don't ask about the lore. I didn't, I didn't come up with it.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.360
Is this what miski was here 24-7?

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:21.240
Creasy, I think I just found out what coffin birth was today. Get educated, get educated, get educated.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.320
ASMR.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.440
Millen right now forever. I would prefer wholesome siren to bad ending siren.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:55.640
Where I just fucking hypnose you and tear a mouth and then keeps you in your stomach so you can't sleep.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.640
All your bases are belong to us. Okay, you ready? I'm gonna, I'm gonna swallow you right now.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.800
And then this says you're going down into my tummy, okay?

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:31.640
You're in my tummy now. Do you hear my tummy?

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:47.480
There's my tummy. It's making lots of noises.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.480
So basically, that's what the pregnancy ASMR is going to sound like, but I'm just complimenting you on that side.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:15.080
Oh, this is what it sounds like when I'm pregnant and you're safe in my tummy too.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.960
Oh, my little reef egg.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.480
Hot dog. This place is magnificent.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:31.800
Okay, well, let's spit you back out of my tummy now.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.200
I shouldn't have swallowed you. Okay, I'll bring you back up.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.680
I'll bring you back up my tummy, but first, first what?

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:52.440
You get to listen to my heart, so I'm gonna do so.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.920
How much is the rent in here?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:20.280
Now, let's spit you out. You're already coming back up. You're back up in my heart now.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.880
I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.760
I don't want to go out the other way, exactly. Either I spit you out of my mouth,

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.400
or you come out the other way. Your choice. And I'm already on day five of being backed up,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.640
so you'll be sitting for a while.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:49.880
Wait, it's all cold. I don't even have any cold.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.000
Okay, I think I'm ready to spit you out.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.600
I'm replaying. There you go. See, it didn't swallow you for long.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.280
That just reminded me. I need to order artwork of me eating you like a Calamari

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.720
squid that's still alive. You know those Japanese fucked up mukbangs?

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.080
Oh, wait, no, is it South Korean? I think it's South Korean. Or is it Chinese?

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.720
Shit. I think one of them was a South Korean girl, and she was eating stuff alive.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.560
I just remembered I have to order an artwork like that as well.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.080
Oops, because I'm going to bore you alive.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.280
I've been on a mean way. I'm not going to chew, so I don't hurt you, okay?

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.960
Oh, you don't want to be back out here? You want to be back on my tummy again?

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.160
Oh, you should be.

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.720
That was a fun read. Did you enjoy it? You're all slimy now, though. Hold on.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.480
I think I need to... I'm going to wait for you down, okay?

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.680
Because you're all covered in musk, but I just need to...

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:27.000
Did you hear my tummy? My tummy's asking for you to go back and say you're very king, but right now...

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:36.040
What am I listening to? I just swallowed you, and then I just un-swallowed you.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.440
But now I'm cleaning the spit off of your ears.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.400
I'm sorry if you're used to AC's really cute ASMR.

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.760
Here, we get a little freaky around these poles.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.440
AC, how about you tell them?

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.680
Okay, so Strani's really fucking weird.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:05.000
I don't know why, but she just tries to make everyone happy,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.840
but it comes out with really inappropriate stuff.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.840
Thanks, AC, for that recap. I'll do it.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.120
You're welcome.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.840
Yeah, I do come out, actually. Thank you, AC.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.040
What?

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.240
I need to get more of the spit off of your insomnia. There's so much spit.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:59.320
Okay, I think you're dry. Oh, that's pretty good. My wife is here.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.720
That's good enough to do it for her.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.360
I don't know, kind of. Actually, I get to find out in my RuneScape stream what kind of stuff the

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.960
girls have been up to because I get to watch the girls. For Azura's one, I'm going to watch her

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.880
monetization stream. I'm going to see if there's like two hours each girl has done,

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:27.000
because if I watch two of her streams from each girl, that's 10 hours of RuneScape wings.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.160
And then I get to do a commentary on the girls.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:40.840
Yeah, I gave you a little species too. Just a test. Sorry if you hear me tell me.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.080
Just a test that it's a little dry. Yeah, you're dry.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:53.080
Okay, wow.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:09.080
When is Elden Ring the lore video watcher? There's lore videos on Elden Ring, aren't they?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:16.440
I love that you've collabed with Yunya. Well, it was probably a given, to be honest. It was

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.920
probably a given. All things considered.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:34.200
Shibi is coming online in 20 minutes, right? Oh no, it's going to be on my tummy.

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:51.320
Please tell me you're running the ASMR. You're running the experience.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.400
Did we finish the Elden Ring DLC? No, we're taking a break on it, because

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:11.560
I've fucked my health up, so I can't do any more endurance for a few days.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:21.640
She says, as she has, what's coming up? I've got mechisol, which is apparently eight hours,

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:28.760
but I don't believe it. And then I have membership ASMR, which is one tingle equals one clap.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:35.720
I thought that was quite creative myself. So you guys tell me whenever you tingle in the stream,

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:43.640
and then I clap. In that way. There is a Mama Yunya collab. Yeah, you're allowed to watch it

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.040
after I finish streaming, but if I redirect into Shibi, then you have to watch Shibi.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:56.120
Balthro, I don't know how long we're gonna go for, but I'm definitely gonna need to start being

01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:04.760
a bit kinder to myself with the endurance streams until my health gets back, because I've been

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:15.080
very silly. I'm not looking after myself. She says that she does three streams in a day, but

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:20.920
it's not hard to do three streams because it's two hours at ASMR, which I'm literally just about to

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.840
finish off. And then we're gonna write a script. I'm gonna go offline, make a cup of tea, get a

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.880
cola, and then we're gonna write a script together, and then I'll gauge if you guys enjoyed it. Like,

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:36.280
I'll do a poll at the end of the stream, and either you say you enjoyed it or you didn't enjoy it.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.480
And then I take a break, and then I put up with you, me plus, and I hope you're ready for the

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:48.120
scrunch break. It's only seven days while we talk about your period here. You aren't gonna

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.720
last clapping that much. I can do it by default. I don't have to do anything special to clap.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:01.960
Like, do I need to- did you not see the new short? Hold on, I'm gonna link a short in chat.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:11.800
Okay, I'm gonna link a short in chat. It is 20 seconds long. You are welcome to watch it right now.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.480
Okay. You may watch this short. I give you permission to watch it.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.400
I'll wait 20 seconds. I'll just do blooping ASMR for 20 seconds whilst you watch that short

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.520
that I've linked in chat.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:43.720
Wait, no VLR members streaming? Oh, no, it's gonna be. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute,

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.000
I forgot. People don't normally stream multiple times, and there's a lot.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.800
Once you're healthy again, keep looking after yourself. Challenge impossible. I want to play

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:58.520
Elden Ring. I want to get carried. Carry me, carry me, carry me, plop, plop, plop.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.800
I could totally make that audio.

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:07.720
Oh, I'm so tempted to make a Twitter audio now that I've said that out loud.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.840
Oh, I'm so tempted.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:22.040
I'm so tempted to literally, plop, plop, plop, and say get carried, carry me, carry me,

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.000
until fireworks. Oh, I shouldn't have said that because I don't want to do it.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.840
No hands clapping is a talent for sure. So now do you believe that in the membership ASMR

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:42.440
I can clap? Every time someone says I tingled when I do something, I tingle you, then yeah.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:48.920
Please carry me audio. Yeah, literally. Please make that Twitter audio. I just might.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:56.280
I just got what she meant by holding her jibblies. Yeah, my boobah. I need to hold them in place

01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.720
because when I jump up and down, they jump with me. Surprise. We all are just one person.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.040
Yes, please do it. Do it. You want no boss? No boss. That's how you say it in Scotland.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.680
If you either say the plate way, which is a double donut to your year, or you say

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.400
shake bag if you didn't, or you say date new boss.

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.840
What if the plopping gives tingles, infinite tingles? No, I have to actually do something.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:39.000
You can't just be like, I tingled because like I moved across the room.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.160
No, it doesn't work like that.

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.760
My stomach is making some cringey. You have a very particular skill set, yeah.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.240
I mean, I could do it right now if you want.

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.760
So this is a sample of what's going to be happening in the members ASMR. Hold on, let me just,

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.120
I'm not sure if I'm going to hear it if I don't know.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.240
Infinite tingle exploit. It's a video game. Oh, should I make a video game, but it's all

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:20.840
about clapping? Okay, hold on, I need to do it. My headset, I was actually hearing what the heck is

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:31.160
going on. I don't know if I'm jumping to the left though because I have to like pretty much

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:42.200
the jump to the left. That one's on the house. Okay, I'm completely in the chair again.

01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:49.160
How high can I jump? Not very. I don't have much of a vertical leap.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.360
Let me put this back on.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:01.640
What the heck?

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:05.880
I have a wet patch, what's it called?

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:15.000
She doesn't know, maybe if I had to move her in a video game, one would be like inking,

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.560
two would be clapping, three would be banshee screaming, and four would be

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.880
tea something. The tick damage on this glass. Okay, there's that back down again.

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:35.720
Sorry, add that, add that, go back on, it's quite cold.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.080
That's a great talent man, I can do it.

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.800
I think we've just discovered a terrible oversight by myself. I don't think I can

01:46:51.800 --> 01:47:00.600
redirect into a viewer member. Community, community? No, unity in shambles right now.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:07.480
Analytics, no not analytics. Redirect, is there anyone who can redirect online?

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:16.360
There's no one at UMI Plus online either. That's it, VNU, I'm looking at you next.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:26.440
Oh wait, Mero, Mero might be coming online. We Mero, listening to this while studying,

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.040
me studying hard, Tescare, small, grabbable.

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:40.680
What did you call me, a grabbable cuttlefish? I don't think I've ever been called a grabbable

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:51.720
cuttlefish, that's amazing. A grabbable cuttlefish. Okay, Mero's not coming online until a couple of

01:47:52.120 --> 01:48:02.120
hours. Thank you so much for the five fabry mathy, fabry mathy. Enjoy your studying,

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:08.120
sorry if I made it hard. Honestly, it's me, what's going to happen? The most vital thing I heard

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:14.120
about someone with the large butt, look at the arsonat, look at the arsonat thing, you know she

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:25.720
can shake, that's fucking mean. Oh my god, squeeze the cuttlefish, hold the cuttlefish,

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.160
get mesmerized by the cuttlefish, get mained broken by the cuttlefish.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:44.520
Okay, now there better be someone online at VNU headquarters, I'm gonna scream,

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:55.080
I'm going to subscribe to literally everyone right now, so it tells me who the heck is online.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:04.360
Okay, I'm gonna close, I'm gonna refresh my page, damn girl, you're shooting it.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:17.320
Oh, there's not one VNU girl online right now, what's going on at VNU headquarters, please?

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:25.480
I can't fucking handle it right now, so we're doing fucking that 4v maria that can never

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:32.840
spell right, 4v, 4v maria. So you can literally hear all that click, I'm like desperately trying

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:38.280
to find someone to redirect into because I don't want to like, it's not like I'm gonna waste,

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:44.840
wait maybe Rem's doing that ASMR thing. Oh come on Rem, okay I'm gonna refresh the page again,

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.920
surely there's someone we can redirect into, surely some of the other streamers online that

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:57.560
doesn't hate us as an agency, oh for fuck's sake not one of them's online, this has to be a joke.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:14.040
VNU and 4v maria didn't have one person online, that's not possible.

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.040
And of course mythos don't stream on YouTube because that would be too easy.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:37.640
No way, no fucking way, was it mythos, HQ really don't stream on you on this,

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:47.000
not the body don't. Oh no they do, question mark, wait hold on,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.200
pause the phone, why do I not think, why do I think they stream on Twitch?

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.040
Why did it, oh,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.080
VR, can't you see, oh sorry if you're gonna fucking call yourself sort of abstract,

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.320
didn't you expect dumbasses like me to understand what on earth is going on,

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:14.040
Rem, oh Rem comes online in nine minutes, okay I'm gonna ASMR the fuck out of you.

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.320
Okay we're gonna redirect into Rem, redirect to a surrounding couple, she's streaming right now I

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:29.000
think, literally, right, when I redirect into Rem, my little pumpkins please, don't be,

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:40.360
don't, don't, I'm comfortable with you because I love you, I don't know what other VTubers

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:45.720
comfortability levels are, like you know how we're complete djans out here, we're just saying,

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:53.320
we're allowed to be, but just, wait Rem isn't too, I don't say that,

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:58.120
no he's, Rem isn't, Rem isn't coming up, wait, what,

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:07.400
whoever that wiefling says that Rem is coming online in nine minutes,

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.560
no, no she's not, destroy that man,

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:19.480
doesn't Merrow stream in seven minutes, no Merrow doesn't, like you mean Merrow,

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.520
Merrow, it says Merrow's coming online at 12 p.m.

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.200
No, is it, can I read, is there anyone,

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:39.400
you could read strongly, she's live in seven, she is live in seven minutes on a member stream,

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:45.400
can't, can't redirect to our members, is there not one person, there has to be one

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:50.600
fucking streamer up right now, fucking, how desperate, wait, is it baked on,

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.240
mods, hang drawn for that wiefling, okay a bit dramatic, but no,

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:10.040
nope she's online at nine a.m, oh freaking the screw, mods smack that man silly,

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:15.400
you could read Maid Mint, is that not inappropriate of me to do that though,

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.760
she's playing out her words,

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:27.640
is that inappropriate to do, I don't know, I feel like it's inappropriate when it's like a big

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:35.800
Vtuber, they're just like, do you know Pillowdeer, oh Pillowdeer's an ASMR, hold on a minute, Pillowdeer's

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:42.120
an ASMRist, and she's playing Minecraft, why my darling, okay Pillowdeer's getting it because

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:50.840
she does ASMR, um, she does it, oh for fuck's sake she's playing Minecraft with that fucking

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.480
inappropriate server that I can't interact with, okay Mint Maid is, so Mint Maid is,

01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.960
congrats Mint Maid, I'm going to interrupt your stream with a host of randy wieflings,

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:08.200
oh goodness gravy, I'm trying, okay please do be super respectful when I redirect into Mint Maid,

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:17.160
and we got there in the end, we found someone,

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.200
there we go, there she is, Outer Wales, I've actually never played Outer Wales,

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:33.560
Fellas are good to play, Pillowdeer's super wholesome, yeah, and of course she's playing a

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:40.920
Minecraft server that I can't interact with, so out of respect I can't interact with, so I might

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:47.800
leave them to it, let them enjoy their thing, and so we'll redirect into Mint Maid, are you guys

01:54:47.880 --> 01:55:00.200
gonna be okay? Okay as long as you guys are okay, Outer Wales is incredible, we should keep our

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:07.720
tentacles for ourselves, yes please do behave, please don't be a goobie McGoober face,

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.040
and because you're not comfortable with your bed, I don't know how other streamers are,

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.400
like you know how streamers like, don't backseat game, I'm like,

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.240
literally just carry me through entire games, everyone's, different strokes for everyone's

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:27.640
different pickle or something like that, okay, okay, right, rest well little brieflings, I am

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.960
about to go make a cup of tea and get a cola, and then we'll do a membership brighten stream,

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:37.880
and we'll see if you guys like it or not, and then after that I will be taking a break, and then

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:46.200
I'll be back online for Yumi Plus, yumi yumi ye, yumi ye, yumi ye, sualalala, okay,

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:59.800
bye bye, see you later alligator, see you on mungus, okay, bye bye
