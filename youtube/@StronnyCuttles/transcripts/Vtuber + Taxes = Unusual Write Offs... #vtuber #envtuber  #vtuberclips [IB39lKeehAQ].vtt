Being a VTuber and having to do taxes can be very interesting.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.700
By definition, anything you have to purchase in order to run your business may be eligible for a tax write-off.

00:09.700 --> 00:16.900
Meaning that things such as a live 2D model, artworks, editors, advertisements, script writers, heck, even songwriters

00:16.900 --> 00:19.800
can give you a cheeky reduction in your overall tax bill.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.000
But wait, there's more.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Your internet and your electricity bill, even the rent if you live somewhere where you have a separate room to work in.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.700
It's also the exact same experience for loot VTuber activities as well.

00:30.700 --> 00:37.300
So yeah, I have looked my accountant in the eyes and claimed back artworks of a very unique variety.
