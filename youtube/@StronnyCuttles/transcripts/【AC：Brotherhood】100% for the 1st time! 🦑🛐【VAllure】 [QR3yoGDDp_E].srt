1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light on to the fucking tracking thing.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
About, like, one minute late, she hates us.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You stop that. You naughty Nellie.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You naughty soft fans.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You naughty ballbags. Actually, don't say that word.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's not, well, I mean, that's not the right word.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Uh...

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Um...

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello, I'm Marika. Hiya! Hiya!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh my god, what's that? We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support. Yay!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
PayPal unblocked this.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
supported, like, everyone with donos, and PayPal was like, halt, halt.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Uh, we're streaming. Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So you can support my daughters.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good morning. Good evening.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And most of all, good afternoon, Reflings.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Do-do-do-do..

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
How are you?

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,000
And you did? It was Aisi looking after you?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Did anyone touch your tummy? Don't lie, Aisi's best design element is her tummy.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Her navel, if you didn't know a belly button is also a refer to as a navel.

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I understand you can't hear the background music of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood right now, ask that meme-in.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,500
I apologize for being a whole 60 seconds late.

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late?

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Because I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it.

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in.

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
If not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship.

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
That's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
But it's been fantastic.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations, like I did yesterday, because I was absolutely awful.

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I just kept missing everything left and right.

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Everything left and right.

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Left and right.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Oh, that's not how I can read.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay, there we go.

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Woo, five hours of sleep and eight hours of work, and we're so bad.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Oh, please rest, okay?

47
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action.

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'll tell you something nasty.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Why can I not hear my game?

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Hello, headset?

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Headset?

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Headset, I know there's, hello?

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay, I cannot hear any sound, and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop.

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Are you fucking serious?

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
By the way, this game lives up to the test of time.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Are we being true?

58
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Why is it not coming out of desktop?

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Is this a fucking joke?

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
How could this have been so scuffed?

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I can't hear the game either.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Okay, fantastic, fantastic.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
No, seriously.

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
The tips link is messed up again.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Are you joking?

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
God, I'm so scuffed.

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now.

68
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Ah, hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens.

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay, I need to start clicking stuff.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio?

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I am totally not raging right now.

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Let's check, let's check.

73
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me cook.

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Because why would it not be detectable on desktop?

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
That's rule one of gaming.

77
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
So I've closed it, it's now closed, you can't see none of it.

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Also, I listened back, I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay.

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up,

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is.

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Uh, yep, again, no audio.

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,500
If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad.

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Why? I didn't do anything.

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,500
This is, I, Mercy has literally made a short about this exact scenario.

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,500
I cannot make this up, Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation.

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Um, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Game, audio, output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

88
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Manage input devices, manage output devices, sound mixer, is it a sound mixer?

89
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Input, yep, output, yep.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Why the frick, why the frick, frack, diddle-y-dack, tic-tac, pedi-wack?

91
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Would this not be coming out?

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this.

93
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm not even kidding.

94
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I can't believe this. Are you joking?

95
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Oh!

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
It only took me seven minutes to start the stream!

97
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Oh, 49% total synchronization.

98
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then, if I'm only at 49%.

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Literally, Mercy made a short about this.

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I cannot wait for the short to come out, so you guys can be like, oh my god, oh my god, she was right.

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Um, if you are not up to scratch, please do not worry,

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
because we have successfully finished campaign mode.

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment.

104
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We are now doing the kind of save quest-esque missions.

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,500
We are about to do a very sad mission for the Auditory family.

106
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Auditory, me, I'm still here. Let's see, let's see, Auditory.

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
But gom, morning, good afternoon, good evening.

108
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I hope, uh, oh, it's good.

109
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment,

110
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:45,500
but as always, when another member goes live, I will force you to go insane to her stream.

111
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh, okay, here we go.

112
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I do not normally do this, so I'm not too familiar with what happens next.

113
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh!

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I think AC is going offline.

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I see, in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Rome.

116
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
It's Leonardo. That's Leonardo's voice.

117
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Hmm.

118
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
What's happening?

119
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Etio seems to be remembering something. Something from 1506.

120
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative.

121
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,500
No, the missing data may be there. The piece of Eden is useless until we have-

122
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh, I don't remember much of this.

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Let him continue. Yes, William.

124
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Yes, William! Congrats if your name's William!

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Any Williams and her?

126
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Eh?

127
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Eh?

128
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
The Da Vinci?

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
The Da Vinci disappearing.

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Did you know?

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Oh, I remember!

133
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Leonardo!

134
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Good friend.

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I see.

136
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I see you reading Super Chess at the moment.

137
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
You're- Wait, she got monetized?

138
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
She couldn't have. I didn't link that.

139
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Sense accounts.

140
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you mean Donation?

141
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
No, they were doing- I was gonna say.

142
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
None of us have monetized these.

143
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success. We're from a mission.

144
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
It's gonna be the Mona Lisa.

145
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Acical!

146
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
My sleepy pee-

147
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
My sleepy acical.

148
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
How is strum?

149
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm so sorry, AC. I never managed to catch any of the-

150
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Snowberries!

151
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Any snowberries?

152
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Hi, snowberries!

153
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
We're currently talking to the historical icon, Leonardo Da Vinci.

154
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
He's a part of the campaign.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Get raided, get raided, get raided.

156
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.

157
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Are you squidding me right now?

158
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Thank you for the 20.

159
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Bajinga. What the fuck?

160
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
There's no way that says Bajinga.

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Did I read that right?

162
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I read it in the top corner.

163
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Thank you Bajinga for the-

164
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
What? You didn't even leave a message!

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Why are you called Bajinga?

166
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, now I can't read chat.

167
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh god, I'm so brain dead.

168
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

169
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Bajinga.

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Good morning.

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm glad you like icicles.

172
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
It's the woman.

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Did you see the guitar AC design for-

174
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
No, I didn't manage to catch her stream.

175
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios.

176
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
I told you those guys were lucky.

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Fortuna wishes she were as good as me.

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
John Jacomo.

179
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I do not answer to that name.

180
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Honestly, me is real.

181
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Better, but not good enough.

182
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes!

183
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm good to go.

184
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
She designed one for everyone.

185
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Oh, I need to watch that VOD then.

186
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon.

187
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios.

188
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I'm really struggling to know how to tag though.

189
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
If you didn't know.

190
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Of men.

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
You worship their misery?

192
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
No, mate.

193
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I actually prefer holes and no poles.

194
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Then he's swinging that way, but actually,

195
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
he's not an against a mate.

196
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait, is this DLC?

197
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Yeah, Pink's Hole.

198
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
It's not like main quest stuff.

199
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
This is like side stuff.

200
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Okay, ready to kill.

201
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
No reactive model today?

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Oh, I never put it on.

203
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I've got this though.

204
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
That's if I make a joke, I can do that.

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat.

206
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Hold on, hold on.

207
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Get the wee knife out.

208
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Wee knife and let them attack you.

209
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh, I can call them assassins.

210
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
So if I make a pun that I like,

211
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I can literally do that.

212
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Okay, the assassin's on the horse.

213
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm happy.

214
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Can you get off the horses?

215
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Oh, that was brutal.

216
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
No, you can attack me then.

217
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
There we go.

218
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Whoa, I missed that.

219
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Okay, there we go.

220
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Please God, do that as hilarious.

221
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun,

222
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
all you're going to hear is that all day long.

223
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Casually kills a dozen people.

224
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Apologize.

225
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Any apologizers?

226
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Man, let me burp.

227
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
No, sorry, let me raid the horse.

228
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Jeez.

229
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I didn't mean to say that.

230
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Literally what I was about to do.

231
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Why is he running?

232
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Nothing.

233
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I drink honey tea.

234
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I have a lovely honey tea.

235
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Just for me, some honey tea.

236
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And a game full of nostalgia.

237
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
And I'll play and ramble all day.

238
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,500
So I can enjoy the game with you.

239
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm not even, I don't know what the tone of the song is after that.

240
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Come with me.

241
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah, there you go.

242
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Wait, so what are you?

243
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I am a cuttlefish.

244
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm a siren and a cuttlefish.

245
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,500
But the problem with being a siren is I can't sing.

246
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,500
So I have to rely on my hypnotic abilities to steal the hearts of men

247
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
and then perish them in the war.

248
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I did not make my lore, by the way.

249
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,500
But in terms of who's the most evil out of all of us in Vealor,

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm pretty evil.

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
And then it goes Emmy, but Emmy isn't inherently evil.

252
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
She just really wants her brother back and she does stuff to entertain herself.

253
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Okay.

254
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
What tea?

255
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I drank some tea, so if I start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea.

256
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I would, oh you'd perish in my water willingly.

257
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Follow me.

258
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Follow me.

259
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
We are following, following the leader, the leader, the leader,

260
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,500
trailing behind the leader, going ahead of the leader,

261
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
the lead to lead to lead to lead to lead.

262
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Oops, oops, oops.

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section,

264
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
because they could spot me a mile away, but hey ho.

265
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Somehow things work out in the end.

266
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,500
It speaks volumes about Vealor, but the most evil person is not the god of the fish.

267
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
No, Azura created you.

268
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
She's your literal mother.

269
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
She created humanity as we know it.

270
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Like, so Azura is like the kindest.

271
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Mercy's just misdirected, okay?

272
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Mercy just, she just doesn't understand,

273
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
because she does genuinely love,

274
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,500
but sometimes that love results in your expiration date,

275
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
which is a shame, but she doesn't mean it, okay?

276
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
She's wholesome.

277
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
She's like a dorky yandere.

278
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,500
She lures your guard, and then before you know it,

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
the finishing act occurs.

280
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
And then, yeah.

281
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh, we're learning about catacombs that we can go in.

282
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Oh, this is the DLC called Leonardo's Diaries.

283
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I just remember that literally eight right now.

284
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I thought it was an auditory mission, but it's gone.

285
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Um...

286
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Taste my...

287
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Oh, no, we're just...

288
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
For size?

289
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Oh, I got a double A or something.

290
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Rick, wait, I'm going to get a quick drink of my tea.

291
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I apologize.

292
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Don't let her deceive you.

293
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
It's all just part of her plan to lure us into her watery graves.

294
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Oh my god, that was such a hard word to say.

295
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Watery graves.

296
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Yandere grapes.

297
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Terrible.

298
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Again.

299
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
We are jumping into the DLCs of Sasuke Brotherhood.

300
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
We've finished the main quest, and we are going to try and 100% this bad boy.

301
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Think I can do it?

302
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I have no idea.

303
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I did not look up what the tank mission is, so I'm getting scurred.

304
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
DLCs.

305
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Ah, delicious.

306
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Not...

307
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
You're true?

308
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Honey is very good for avoiding illness.

309
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
But Antelba...

310
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
And take back cereal.

311
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Sorry, that guy's talking at the same time, and it makes it hard to talk and think.

312
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Whoa, E.I.

313
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
E.I. Burger.

314
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm a beautiful fish.

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Oh, we should watch that movie.

316
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
The song is like...

317
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm a little little fish in the deep blue sea.

318
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Somebody help me.

319
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
No help.

320
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
No help.

321
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I've gone too far.

322
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I think I'm about to desync.

323
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Oh, no, they're just walking past.

324
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Okay.

325
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Walking behind.

326
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Out my way.

327
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Out my way.

328
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Oh, I'm on the floor.

329
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
No help.

330
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Strongly evil intentions through Cain's axe.

331
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Amy, Cain's intentions through evil.

332
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Yeah, basically, Amy just wants her brother back.

333
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
And she Cain to has a bit of fun with the spells, really.

334
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
That's how she was concepted.

335
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Oh, the Yoink Leonardo!

336
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I do not know.

337
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Katso.

338
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
What does he say?

339
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
I cannot read.

340
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Leonardo.

341
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Depente.

342
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Depente?

343
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
He wants us to examine art.

344
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I remember when Leonardo.

345
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
He was Leonardo.

346
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Back.

347
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
The every lovey painting's hung in the gallery there.

348
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
What do they have to do at their temple?

349
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You're the cuff, you're the cuss.

350
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh, it's Edgy girlfriend.

351
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Hey, thanks for doing the watch alone, baby.

352
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
God, I can be the cuss cull fish that ever did cull.

353
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Hope you're doing well.

354
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Thanks again for doing the watch alone.

355
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I appreciate you winking at you right now.

356
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
You got three deal?

357
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,460
a three-deal? You wanna do ASMR together? You're slayed in on my Twitter DM? That's terrible.

358
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,620
That's absolutely terrible. Please do not feel put on the spot. And anyway, I'm just, I'm just

359
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:51,460
moving around. I'm such a fiend. I'm a little ASMR fiend. Right, we're gonna keep doing a Leonardo

360
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:58,580
situation. So, if you didn't get any of that plot, Leonardo has been yoinked and he discovered

361
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:06,180
some sort of advantageous thing that would, oh pardon me, excuse me, come through. Sorry,

362
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,420
reading chat. I was reading chat, excuse me, I was reading chat, excuse me sir. Have you

363
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:17,540
heard about this? Have you seen this about chat? Yeah? Oh my god. Slayed in right now.

364
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,860
Yeah, slayed in my DMs. And then I'll, I'll do the rest of the work, okay? I got you covered,

365
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:31,300
babykicks. Biba, biba an ASMR fiend, you know? Oh, Catherine, not Catherine, Christina's coming

366
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:40,100
up. Oh right, we'll do Christina. So basically, we stalked her home and then we got a kiss. So

367
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:49,620
surely this isn't gonna get weird any further? Reading chat, obviously, a mistake to do. I

368
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:56,580
know literally doing it like in a game is so hard. Let's strongly lead my pleasure. I remember that

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,460
it's, yeah, it was a bit, it was a bit sus. I have to admit it's ill. It was a bit sus. Now, we, the girls

370
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,700
can do it to you. That's fine. You know, that's fine. By the way, around Christina, we're in

371
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:25,540
Firenze. Assassin's Creed 2 is like Firenze. Oh, this is so sad. Oh, this is so sad.

372
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:40,020
Mm. In Assassin's Creed 2, your family get hung due to treachery. This, this is really sad. This,

373
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't like this one. This is pretty freaking sad, honestly. Oh, I can't remember the past though.

374
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,460
Mm. This is very sad. So the girls, yeah, yeah, so we can do it to you, but you're not allowed to do it to us.

375
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,300
Come here, you fanny. Bunk. Oh, I missed, I missed. That was really embarrassing, actually.

376
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,980
Imagine someone coming to punch. Oh, I did it again. I'm like punching the air. This

377
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,820
can't be one air that's going on with him.

378
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,940
Assassin's Creed 2 is actually very beautiful, considering how old it is.

379
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:46,260
Mm. I don't want to speak because I don't know, for a fact. This might genuinely be the imported

380
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,820
map from Assassin's Creed 2. Where the heck am I trying to go? Swinging at his family.

381
00:24:52,820 --> 00:25:00,980
Sorry. To be honest, it was, it's his first day. Yeah, his first day, as you know.

382
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:08,500
What do you do? Only one thing to do. Kill them. No, don't do that. They did nothing wrong.

383
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,740
They follow orders unquestioning me. That makes... Unquestioning me. That's a very hard word.

384
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,100
I'll sneak behind their backs. That's a big word for scrawny.

385
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,740
Time if I have to. Carry them down to the river. Be careful.

386
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:32,580
Right, if I remember correctly, I can just do this. And there's one patrolling guard

387
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,340
that will desync you if you're not. Oh, he's up there. I can see him.

388
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,780
Oh, this is so sad. This is literally the bodies of my freaking family.

389
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,300
Oh, I've desynced already. Wait, am I not to kill these people?

390
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,660
Wait, did I desync if I kill them, Chris? Without killing any... Right, how did I do that?

391
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,980
Uh... Wait, he perished because he went in the water. Right, come in the water. Come in the water.

392
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,900
And you come. Come into the water. Come on. Good boy. Be a good boy. Into the water. Wee!

393
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,660
You love water, don't you? You love it. Into the water. Come on. Come on. He's a good boy.

394
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,940
He's a good boy that wants to come in the water. Yes! No! Jump in the water. Jump in the water.

395
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,260
Jump in the water. Come on. Oh, wait. Can I knock him out? Does it count if I knock you out?

396
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,460
Let me knock you out. Boom! Get in the water. Yeah, good boy. Get in the water.

397
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,460
Right, in the water. In the water. You too. You're next. In the water. Don't be throwing rocks at

398
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,740
me. That's no nice. Ha ha! Ha ha! Get pulled. Get pulled. In the water. Go! Good boy. In the

399
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:47,780
water. You go. Okay, we did it. We did it. Okay, now back to the sad part. This is my big brother.

400
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,020
And, yeah. This, honestly, it's pretty messed up. All things considered.

401
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,540
Poppy down there. Oh, his body just kind of ragdoll and...

402
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:11,060
It's so leaving their deaths to fate once again, probably. Oh, no. This was your wee brother.

403
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,460
It was actually so freaking sad in Assassin's Creed 2. So your mother, Maria,

404
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:27,700
she doesn't talk until you collect a hundred feathers because Pietro, the wee little brother,

405
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,740
was collecting feathers. And once you collect all 100 feathers, she finally speaks her first words

406
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,940
after the death of everyone. And it's just like such a freaking sad thing, genuinely. And then this

407
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:49,300
is your dad. Oh, it was so sad. Literally so freaking sad. Yeah, the feather quest. That's why

408
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:59,380
there's 10 feathers in this game. I guess it's a memoria. I have to leave the city. Christina, I

409
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,460
want you to come with me.

410
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,660
I want to. But I can't. My family.

411
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,460
So you can always be together, Christina.

412
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,580
It's you.

413
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:28,260
Actually so sad.

414
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,780
She doesn't... She doesn't come with those.

415
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:45,860
And Christina's ex, he was like true love. And then so sad. She's feeding corpses to the fishes.

416
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,300
That's true.

417
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,380
And there was no in-game map for the feathers. Do you want to hear the worst part about the

418
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:03,300
feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2? So my Xbox was in a different room from where the computer

419
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:10,500
was in my house. So I would have to scurry to the living room and memorize a location of a feather

420
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,220
and then scurry back through to my Xbox as a child. I was doing this back and forth.

421
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,620
My mum was like, what on earth are you doing, Strony? I'm getting worried about you.

422
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,780
And I was like, it's the feathers! The feathers, mum! The feathers! I need the feathers!

423
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,020
What do you need the feathers for? I was like scurrying back and forth.

424
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,100
And I did it once. I've never done it again. But we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2.

425
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,900
Which is our DLC.

426
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Allegedly, so the way I memorize things, I don't have a very good brain.

427
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,420
So I had to open my eyes really wide and order. Oh, it's the crit sale.

428
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:35,540
Wow. So after Chesery's date with fate, the crit sale got married off.

429
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,340
And Chanel lives on the countryside and hiding.

430
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,340
But yeah, I used to like have to, in order to memorize stuff, I had to open my eyes really

431
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,820
wide, which I know seems bizarre, but it's the only way I could do it. I just had to go like,

432
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,260
and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run to the Xbox and like where the location was.

433
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,740
It sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud, but it was the only way I could do it.

434
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,260
Like the like phones weren't like, well, I didn't have a phone.

435
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,620
Because I was a child and like, yeah, phones weren't like that.

436
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,380
This is really dangerous because I actually don't know which way. Okay, okay, that was lucky.

437
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,460
Eyes wide must take all information. I was literally like, sorry, can't speak. Don't talk to me.

438
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,100
And then I'd get another feather and then come back through and look at the next one.

439
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,220
And if you like pick up feathers on the way, actually being set a bit harder.

440
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:53,220
There are guards everywhere. La Crescia is, is that just a straight jump? I think so. Okay.

441
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,820
You don't hear a grown man fall into here. Literally, oh my back.

442
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:13,220
Yeah, you don't remember which feathers you pick up along the way. So it makes it even harder

443
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:21,460
because if you go to the area you think it, it was that, um, sorry, I got nervous. I'm about to go

444
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,860
the wrong way.

445
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,700
You're stuck on that side. No one will hear you. Are you ready? No. Stay where you are.

446
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,020
Let me through. You must wait until the Tukesa allows you to pass.

447
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,980
I can reach that, jeez. Another wind. Skyrim logic must be the best logic.

448
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:48,100
Sorry, is there, I think, no, there can't be flags on the DLC. That's not allowed. Whoa.

449
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,140
So that camera angle change, sheesh.

450
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Although I will say one thing about this DLC, this is so satisfying because, um,

451
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,860
you really won't get caught by the guards doing this. You can literally parkour your way through

452
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:11,220
it and the guards don't actually catch you, which I see is very satisfying gameplay wise.

453
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,500
What a satisfying yes.

454
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,580
Um, I do like the idea of, like, it so being able to, like, completely sneak undetected

455
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,660
without the fear of being detected.

456
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:31,220
Oh my god. Uh, I have terrible news, I need to pee already. Um, yeah, like, see, I love this.

457
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,380
This is, like, so satisfying. Like, I'm just quietly sneaking around.

458
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:44,500
Ooh. We're in the gardens of whatever that goddess name is and I've already forgotten

459
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,860
what the garden's called.

460
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,660
Okay, this is the bit where you can lose, I think.

461
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,220
Right, you can't climb the hedge, I guess.

462
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,820
Okay, okay.

463
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,500
As if they don't hear me fucking...

464
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,020
What was that supposed to do? I have no idea. Oh, I just went for it. Oops.

465
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,180
They are so dead. Oh, the cret. Honestly, this outfit, they're gonna...

466
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,180
Benesons.

467
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,220
Gentle.

468
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,060
Benesons Veechever?

469
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
History Veechever?

470
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,740
I'll redecorate that win.

471
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,940
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop!

472
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,940
I'm sorry.

473
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,940
She is home. Yeah, do you like her haze?

474
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,940
Go, we are really a ladies, man.

475
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,900
And one for someone who was special to me, Patrizio. He spends his time near Ilvatica.

476
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm not gonna lie, Riflin, if you did that to me yet, Mel.

477
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,180
I'll give it to you soon. Give it to me.

478
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,100
Guards!

479
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,740
Place the Vinci's Annunciation in a cart. Leave it outside the walls.

480
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,180
No.

481
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,020
Oh, lo bene. Now, close your eyes.

482
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,580
I don't remember what's happening.

483
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,580
There's no way. We killed her brother and...

484
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,780
No, we won the scene.

485
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:21,940
Oh. Oh, see, all you had to do was put your pole in the hole and now the guards are on.

486
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,660
So it was that simple. Come on.

487
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,420
You heard that doctor at the start. There's a cure for syphilis.

488
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,220
Oh, I don't know where to go.

489
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,420
Take up the stairs.

490
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,300
This is the most logical reason because why would you put the stairs at 12 o'clock?

491
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,140
Oh, I don't know where to go.

492
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,020
And there's a timer.

493
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,220
There's so many guards, so many guards inside.

494
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,260
We go back inside.

495
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,380
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

496
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,340
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

497
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,660
Okay, across, across the chandelier.

498
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,620
Unfortunate.

499
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,780
Door locked down.

500
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,820
Okay, okay, okay.

501
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,860
Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo.

502

Okay, and then wee.

505
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,460

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,500
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

507
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,060
Okay, we can do it, we can do it.

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,020
Come on, I say, come on, I say.

509
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,500
Don't be scared.

510
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,020
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to whistle that.

511
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,220
I just whistled because I was breathing like with a small mouth.

512
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,380
My pardon, my pardon, your pardon, I beg.

513
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,700
I don't say my pardon, you beg.

514
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,060
But you don't need to ask me.

515
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,260
Oh, did we do it?

516
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,140
Oh, was that it?

517
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,180
I was actually really quick.

518
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,080
What?

519
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,200
What?

520
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,860
One out of five pins.

521
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,460
Okay, we nailed that.

522
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,700
We nailed that.

523
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,020
We absolutely nailed that.

524
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,860
Who's pardon now?

525
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,980
That was, that was scary.

526
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,860
But we did it.

527
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,980
Only one minute and 57 seconds is fair.

528
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,260
Okay, that went so well.

529
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,580
Honestly, can you distract on a horse?

530
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,420

531
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,460

suppose the error lies in her Spanish blood I know it such untruth you so casually utter based

627
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,140
on little more than a name these countries these groups make such easy targets for the lazy

628
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:41,860
and ignorant you should tell her that the high and mighty duquesa putana I have changed my mind

629
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,420
that painting does not deserve to belong to anyone

630
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:56,100
I take the painting and examine it for clues be careful human hands aided by a fierce intelligence

631
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:02,660
made that treat it with respect go he casted London experience

632
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,180

635
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,780
he's literally faster than the speed that I can run at I'm not sure why the game is telling me

00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:40,020
careful you're desyncing yeah get arrow stormed get arrow stormed you deserve it you stinky stink

637
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:46,980
leave the Vatican district okay working on it's ill there was a poll there that you could have

638
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:53,780
grabbed to save the health of your ankles I'm not going to take responsibility for you being sore

639
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,940
because that was point blank it's ill that was point blank no excuse

640
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:09,700
I'm trying to escape this district it puts you like all the way into a certain section of the

641
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,420
map and then it's like oh by the way go all the way out of the section

642
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:22,420
and out and out shake all about you do the hockey pokey and you run around and that's what's all about

643
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:32,660
hey that's green let's start wasn't even I'm seeing viewer from your pentas have you

644
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:41,300
drawn your pentas a little too much the funniest thing I got a few maros I wouldn't say anyone was

645
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:48,420
like disgruntled I think they were surprised so out of all the four audios for sheebie three of them

646
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,100
are her in control and one of them is her not in the controlling position guess which one you

647
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:00,900
all voted well the majority voted for the one who was me and then I've got a few messages and I'm

648
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:07,780
like ah please I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better and we are working on making graphics

649
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:16,580
so you know what content is coming up and it just takes time like we're we're settling into everything

650
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:25,460
and obviously Emmy got a warning recently and sheebie's lower video got 18 plus so I think

651
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:31,460
we're actually debating about deleting it to try and ensure she gets monetization I would be

652
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:37,540
mortified for the girls if they didn't get like they were rejected from youtube monetization because

653
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:44,980
of me because member the girls didn't pick their designs and I would feel like so upset like don't

654
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,220
get me wrong there's still stream elements there's still patreon there's still like tips on stream in

655
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:55,300
general which is perfectly fine um heck I'm not supposed to go but I would like be mortified if

656
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,580
like they had to wait an entire month for monetization streams all because like I didn't think I had to

657
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,260
get a toggle to like cover up the cleavage

658
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,540
hmm

659
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,860
what do you normally need to do to get monetized 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours but your

660
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,660
channel can still be rejected um which is understandable like they need to go through the

661
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:40,420
content but like um hoping you know all things considered like if the girls are sitting doing

662
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,300
like game streams and all of that it's just another like yeah they're just gamers pass it on like

663
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:53,140
obviously before we could launch I could only spell out so much like don't be silly of course

664
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:59,620
like the girls aren't gonna be wait am I not to be detected I don't don't detect me I'm scared

670
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:38,260
one of those ones where they just keep spawning in more guys and it's just a waste of time

671
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:46,500
we're trying to 100% this I say that as if we don't have to like redo all of this again probably

672
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:53,460
to get 100% I actually don't know what oh no 100% was don't be detected or something that's impossible

do not let guards discover any dead bodies inside the restricted area these are I'm starting to get

757
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:50,100
worried about me 100% in this game I'm getting nervous I'm getting a little shaky what have I

758
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:58,660
gotten myself into now I'm confident in like playing the game in general 100% in it I have to

759
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:05,300
admit my confidence levels are diminishing the further into the game we get because it's starting

760
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:13,940
to get pretty like the ones where it was like don't take damage fine I can do that please leave me

761
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:24,820
alone no they're so aggressive watch out if they pass with their camera and their glasses

762
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:31,140
and they can't keep a lid the Vinci says

763
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,660

769
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:27,860

01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:37,220
can I be detect oh it can't be to take you oh I always did it I'm like I did okay don't let

right okay let's try that again so guard no detect oh

773
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:00,500
I'll try it but I feel like this is most likely a try hard replay section

774
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:07,220
because yeah his dead body's like literally ready to drop unless I'm gonna drop in the water

775

893
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,540
talk face to face with your idol and stuff and I think that's a really cute idea

894
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:12,820
there's an enemy up ahead so there's no way I can 100% this stuff without using ranged weapons

01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,700
this isn't say hey hey like genuinely the same

905
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:29,860
go the guy says because I'm still literally out here killing where am I just to leave the castle in

906
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:36,100
general I have no idea if we're looking north of the castle I need to go south of the castle I need

907
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:46,420
to go this way this is this is brutal I'm rubbish at the DLC honestly yeah I'm gonna yeah like

908
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:53,620
literally 96.96 I'll take that because uh yeah there's absolutely no way wait I'm still gonna be

909
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:54,580
outside the walls

910
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:05,060
if I claim to the top of that is it gonna take me outside the castle if I jump down

911
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:11,780
because I'm 99% sure you can claim the top of this so we're just gonna do it for the yule

912
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:22,260
me I'm the thief oh wait no I can't be detected silly me I'll just do that

913
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:26,900
jump it's okay well don't jump then fine let's just fight

914
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:33,700
we're going to jump off the top of the castello because I think it takes us out of bounds of the

915
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:44,260
actual area hello bye bye that thief me strongly not dying on sale oh boy

916
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:51,700
oh here I go killing again right oh wait hold on this isn't a jump point

917
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:59,940
I don't think is there I see a flag up here yeah I'm gonna be honest I don't really want to jump

918
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:06,500
into a bale of heat uh from this height is that a feather or a flag

919
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:21,620
the flag um I'm gonna be honest as oh that's the hay bale I'm supposed to jump into

920
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:31,540
the whoa this is a big map oh look there's the the thing and you can see the colosseum in the

921
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:41,380
background too honestly this map is humongous humongous wall do you remember that okay right

922
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:50,260
let's try this again I don't really want to be on the side of the castle but it's where it's taking me

923
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:58,260
so there's really more jump points oh it's the courtyard again okay okay we'll just go south

924
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:10,740
the humongous oh it was crazy humongous what what are you on about honestly

925
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:16,580
where the heck am I supposed to go to get out of this castle I'm so um like swapped about

926
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:23,620
I know there's a ledge okay I'll get down get down

927
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:32,500
it's left or right okay this way geez we got there in the end I am I've not woken up clearly

928
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:36,340
you know I think I might need to get a coal or something like I don't feel like I'm here right

929
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:43,060
now this is the most pathetic wait it made me go out of bounds only to tell me the map is right

930
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:50,100
the unfinished work by Leonardo portrays Saint Jerome in the Syrian desert where he

931
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:57,460
lived as a hermit why would anyone stop I don't need the lore and the paintings I need the map

932
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:05,620
can I have the map please map map map I need the oh wait it's straight ahead

933
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:11,860
oh oh it's because of the the bridge

934
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:23,700
you're really good at this game maybe yesterday yes but today rough very rough gameplay

935
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:29,540
I still don't think a man can jump 100 feet in at Hebele and be fine honestly

936
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:34,740
game please I don't care about your stinky pay I literally I do like that they genuinely put

937
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:38,340
like all that lore and I'm sure like others appreciate it but I'm so sorry I'm very like

938
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:46,180
I can't be there's only so much knowledge I can inhale no PewDiePie not the bridge

939
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:02,340
finished yesterday's Nike dealing before we say which is 4 p.m and it's kind of annoying

940
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:16,020
is Nike gacha I just know it's got pretty girls and people like the pretty girls

941
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:24,100
use your head more than your brain I'm literally like use your head how are we

942
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:29,140
gonna solve this problem to open the door yes you're right use my head I'll ram it against

943
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:35,860
the door until it breaks down that's that's how I am we are gonna hire because we are gonna try and

944
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:41,140
get the favor of everyone at some point so we're I'm gonna take that money at the bank because

945
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:48,820
your bank interest can actually get full and then you're kind of wasting that income free money

946
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:54,820
actually the Hebele should be as high as the jumping point to be safe to enter

947
01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:03,940
I don't want to use my head okay last one of the Leonardo mission

948
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:09,700
not the war machine mission oh sorry I just need to click with the

949
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,980
I think there's like five for the court did you say get busy as distraction

950
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,500
it's the oh that's a bit on the nose don't you

951
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:24,260
now we need a did you know strong enough

952
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,740
I was like what some forgets a pitch fork in that he built

953
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:36,020
have you found anything nothing is there no no it's just nothing we're finding Leonardo

954
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:43,300
he's been taken we need him back think I'm done thinking these paintings are a blank slate

955
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,220
sorry the hammerhead call face well

956
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:50,980
can seal his research he frequently writes backwards

957

01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:18,340
you are leaving it's not for it's for Desmond

1154
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:25,220
it's the the vault in Assassin's Creed 3 location for us

1155
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:33,700
it's you what are you not telling me for Desmond well I have begun several dissection studies

1156
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:42,020
oh my god it's for dance man as an engineer oh yes I'm oh my god I literally have tears in my eyes

1157
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:47,700

1158
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:50,180
oh

1159
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,300
when his body's all mangled it's where they take him

1160
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:06,180
you can sedate Desmond now yes oh my god it all makes sense

1161
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:11,620
yes and then you're broken in revelations

1162
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:17,940
oh my god I get it I understand

1163
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:28,020
that's right oh my god it's like all clicking like a like oh

1164
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:37,620
oh oh my god that's so cool in revelations Desmond's broken you're stuck in the animus

1165
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,780
and they can't take you out because you're so mangled

1166
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:50,420
and Ezio understands that he's a vessel for Desmond to get information in present day it's

1167
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,860
absolutely crazy

1168
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,780
oh that's so cool

1169
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:04,260
that's so cool oh spoilers yeah I'm sorry I'm just like I'm like re

1170
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:09,460
like putting it all back in my head because I've played Brotherhood over and over and over

1171
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:12,500
but I didn't always have access to the DLCs whenever I played them

1172
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:18,900
and then it's all clicking in Assassin's Creed revelations you're mangled in the animus

1173
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:28,260
and we had to go like in present day your dad William takes like Desmond's dad William takes him

1174
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:37,460
to the thingy to that location because it's a safe haven and it's where one of the gods are like

1175
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:43,460
the building things where and oh it's just so cool it's so cool

1176
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Desmond's stuck in the mangled in the animus

1177
01:57:55,300 --> 01:58:01,540
I have no idea who Desmond is but I'm happy you're happy so we're playing Ezio Desmond is his and

1178
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:10,820
like blood lineage offspring and we use Desmond's DNA in present day to look back at Ezio in the past

1179
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:16,500
Christina oh we just jump scared our oops

1180

1206
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:22,340
a freaking break is that the end of Christina's story I don't see a broken heart on the map

1207
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:34,100
there is no way it ends there for Christina I don't see a broken heart on the map

1208
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:42,500
that's it

1209
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,580

1212
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:06,100
no happy ending for the best character literally like

1213
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:11,620
there must have been more written I'm so sorry but I do not believe for a moment the

1214
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:20,100
development team ended it there for Christina literally it's saving him from Gamba and going

1215
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:25,380
do you love her do you love her and then that's it I do not believe one second the writers left

1216
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:32,980
it there if there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse I refuse I refuse

1217
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:40,340
whoa what is a man to write all I know is

1218
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:49,220
but it's you will have a hell of a happy ending I can't remember what happens at the end of

1219
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:56,260
revolutions I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got

1220
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:03,940
kidnapped but that's not the true love Christina was

1221
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:08,980
like ah

1222
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:18,020
they saved it for the 20 bucks DLC honestly isn't that song miserable I have no idea

1223
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:26,740
I just if it really never man tension to brag it was never man tension oh I can probably renovate

1224
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:35,460
this aqueduct while I'm at it I'm like right next to it I mean I don't know I simply saw it it took

1225
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:41,460
revelation I took the revelation look to this one he if you want the Christina should you just get

1226

right

1260
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:57,780
um

1261
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:04,900
what's my opinion I was having to pee it was a game yeah

1262
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:10,820
okay it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that

1263
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:19,300
literally our storm would wait this yeah it was definitely because they hit me

1264
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:27,540
we'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo

1265
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:32,500
for well it would be nice to finish Christina but then we're having like backtrack all this way

1266
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:38,900
right what weapons okay I do have my fast knife so hopefully none of them like

1267
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:44,980
fly out of the corner and attack me because that was what happened the first time like they

1268
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:51,860
started attacking me way before we even got to the gallow which is where it's supposed to start so

1269
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:55,140
I'll definitely hold back a bit more to be cautious

1270
02:08:55,540 --> 02:09:02,180
like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3 well

1271
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:10,580
I wouldn't play it on stream though like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of

1272
02:09:10,580 --> 02:09:18,820
that and I really love how forgiving the counter controls are and brotherhood and revelations

1273
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:26,020
I think it's roughly the same um but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards they like change the controls

1274
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:33,540
and I am definitely if it's not broke don't fix it and if you fixed it it has now made like gameplay

1275
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:39,940
frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like

1276
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:45,220
oopsie whoopsie you forgot to dodge this attack so now you're desynced and you have to repeat this

1277
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:50,740
over and over and over again because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the

1278
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:55,380
controls on brotherhood were received so well because it's like our best well-received game

1279
02:09:55,380 --> 02:10:04,580
you know like that stuff just makes me perish all right we're still gonna stay back we're not

1280
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:12,180
quite at the gallows yet but I don't want anyone reaching to attack me and I definitely have time

1281
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:14,500
to react if I've kind of got this distance on them

1282
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:28,660
sorry excuse me pardon me come through all right take your time actually I have smoke bombs I'm

1283
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:34,100
wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them if they turn on me

1284
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:41,780
are we at the gallows yet I'm like getting scared I do not want to replay this if it's

1285
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:46,100
literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off

1286
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:51,700
I don't know if I should claim you know that

1287
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:57,460
that's okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

1288
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:02,580
okay I have access to all my long range I am using it

1289
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:09,860
please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness

1290
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:22,020
oh wow this is did I just I don't know citizens please do not walk in front of the crossbow

1291
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:29,140
okay there we go 100% yeah okay this is so much easier I did not realize we'd have access to the

1292
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:36,100
older weapons for this stuff as well this will make it easy that guy had a death wish literally like

1293
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:42,100
thank you for it's you did not kill civilians well because civilians certainly pop themselves off

1294
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:49,540
right that's fine uh double oh we've got one missing from this one as well

1295
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:57,140
don't be detected while reducing to a righty that's like super easy why have I failed these ones

1296
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,460
fake game are clearly

1297
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:09,460
uh right oh I need to do the whole thing over again

1298
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:15,140
10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strutting for distressing

1299
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:21,380
my door was this the game that had the terror defense no that was revelations

1300
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:29,780
because you were super excited and borrowing them to a barrel thank you that man is a traitor

1301
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:37,140
to our order your character design romancy of mesmer from subnautica is there NPCs in subnautica

1302
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:42,900
I thought it was like you versus all deafish I'm not pleased

1303
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:47,140
subnautica

1304
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:56,100
but he is an assassin not a traitor you run into guards well oh that's right that's true that's true

1305
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:09,620
the mesmer is a fish I'm a fish too I'm a photo fish oh I didn't sink my my cheeky iPhone

1306
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:11,780
let me calibrate myself right now

1307
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:20,740
ah okay I calibrated so now you can like really tell what I'm looking at yeah

1308
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:24,980
okay we will rock you for one

1309
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:32,020
it's a scary little fish that hypnotizes you stop it's actually okay maybe we will have to

1310
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:34,980
play subnautica I didn't realize I was in the game

1311
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:49,700
there are NPC messages okay that's great right how much ammo oh I need a restock ammo okay

1312
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:55,780
I'm actually gonna do the the pouch upgrade so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches

1313
02:13:55,780 --> 02:14:03,140
increase your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and it'll definitely help out in these

1314
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:05,860
kind of rewind situations

1315
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:19,540
wait you've never played subnautica I don't remember I think I've seen people play it which

1316
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:27,940
is why I say like I don't remember playing it um I'm in my tummy's wumbling okay okay

1317
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:30,260
after this one we go get food and fizzy juice

1318
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,140
boom

1319
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:40,420
wow that would hurt

1320
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:48,260
we can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica

1321
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:53,220
because I have no concept of what to do my son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him

1322
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:58,260
not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot

1323
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:08,740
I may not have an automatic but I'll I'll do it anyway oh whoa whoa what are you doing

stop why are you just accepting gunshots that oh okay we did it we did it quick I'd run the guards

1326
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:28,020
can we hold hands anyway yeah I subnautica multiplayer imagine if you guys can come in and help me

1327
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:34,820
oh we should have more games like that uh right don't get caught while reducing notoriety I'd like to

1328
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:43,380
see you son oh my tummy's really yumbling whoa that was a good switcheroo words my stomach is really

1329
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:51,060
rumbling okay as soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem but I don't notice it for

1330
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:56,180
like hours on end are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel

1331
02:15:56,180 --> 02:16:01,540
like it is going that way it's single player oh that sucks it would be so fun to play

1332
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:13,860
there is a mod but I don't know if I need like whoa what's going on there's like three groups here

mutual hypnotizing

1336
02:16:30,740 --> 02:16:37,940

1337
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:43,300
notoriety can I just say shout out to the word notoriety you're so satisfying to see

stop being so nice to me and get me so distracted from the gameplay

1452
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:30,420
I've been told that I inherited my supposed to be very nice from my mother's side of the

1453
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:44,340
family oh well do you want to know what's funny my mommy has big bazongas do you want to know

1456
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:10,180

1457
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:15,700
you got your yiddies from your father honestly

1458
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:23,540
when can we get mum on stream stop she'll actually talk about it she'll be like I

1459
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:30,420
strongly just never grew anything um like I remember when she got me a training bra

1460
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:37,620
like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing one because it's

1461
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:41,780
actually really uncomfortable like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable

1462
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:47,700
but like having something to strap down moving parts um it's kind of cut

1463
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:55,060
how much am I missing is that like less than 500 florins roughly

1464
02:32:55,940 --> 02:33:03,780
oh um and like she got me one and I was like mum what is this for and she was like oh well

1465
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:08,740
I've got big gibberish so you're gonna get big gibberish as well and I'm like um okay so like

1466
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:22,820
I start training and then nothing happened no not like a sports bra like just like a thin

1467
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:30,340
fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah nothing happened nothing happened with me for

1468
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:41,780
but I'm not mad like I quite like my aesthetic some people like have struggles with their

1469
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:51,540
bodies but I am really lucky because I I prefer being uh not having much up but having a lot down

1470
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:53,300
like I really like my body

1471
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:59,300
yeah like small buddies don't get in the way either

1472
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:08,260
like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like uh the only pain

1473
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:16,900
I get is like I don't get any pain because of my physique I would say that sorry I'm trying to like

1474
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:24,580
think and do things at the same time and it's not working out um I would say like my physique

1475
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:32,180
just means like I'm always good to go basically uh right we'll be doing another DNA

1476
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:40,820
bro but do you know okay there's quite a lot oh no only two only two

1477
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:48,660
do castle crusher no I don't want to do you the burdens we carry no I don't want to do you either

1478
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:54,740
right I'm gonna avoid any don't be I can do it in this one I know how to do that one

1479
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:07,380
so I just went on a massive ramble about that milk milk and dump truck as I go oh mini milk is

1480
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:15,700
yeah mini mocha oh no we don't have our sassan recruits but we should at this point

1481
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:26,340
it's gonna be a bit painful wait where are you gonna get some food oh I was

1482
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:30,260
okay we'll do it after this one see you guys distracted me

1483
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:32,260
be fine stay alert

1484
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:42,340
oofy I forgot to get up wait I have one sassan recruit thing

1485
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,260
is that because I only had one at the time

1486
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:54,420
oh no it's because they're all away on missions right now okay so if my sassans are way on missions

1487
02:35:54,420 --> 02:36:00,820
they're not available during recall that's yeah I understand that's probably like programming

1488
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:05,940
would have been a nightmare so yeah no that makes sense okay I won't send my recruits away too much

1489
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:11,780
anymore if that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the

1490
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:18,260
assassin signal I'm just gonna do this right now because I'm pretty sure it'll count towards my

1491
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:21,620
hiring the to lure the guards

1492
02:36:32,820 --> 02:36:36,900
at the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies

1493
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:40,100
should have got some food bozos

1494
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:51,860
yeah you put everyone else on quest literally I need to go around and find all these gestures

1495
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:56,740
I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture thing like they get money or just something

1496
02:36:56,740 --> 02:37:05,380
happen where does that senator I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back

1497
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:11,460
for this mission right yes we're gonna do that that's probably the best idea right now so I don't

1498
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:16,260
mess up this mission I'm actually gonna go out of range just so the event doesn't trigger

1499
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:25,380
um please get off there we go we're just hiding here why not I'm going to go get some food I'm

1503

1504
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:52,580

1505
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:56,420

02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:18,060
Let's go play on his own there and break the fourth wall.

1582
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:22,220
My god the shibu shima's layer is hell yeah it's how you go watch her.

1583
02:44:22,220 --> 02:44:25,860
I could have sworn I was in that hay bale but whatever.

1584
02:44:25,860 --> 02:44:28,020
You were, a guard shoved me out.

1585
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:31,020
I got bullied.

1586
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:34,020
Yes all your flooring- oh how dear you.

1587
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:35,860
A guard attacked me, how am I alive?

1588
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:37,940
Did the mission just reset?

1589
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:46,580
Right I can see that I've got three sassan signals so this is gonna make things a heck of a lot of you.

1590
02:44:50,660 --> 02:44:54,420
I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins

1591
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:57,220
and I have chocolate covered raisins and I'm sorry I had.

1592
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:02,980
They just pushed me out I guess.

1593
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:06,660
Make an exception for her.

1594
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:12,420
Right I...

1595
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:18,580
Oh am I allowed to be detected at this stage?

1596
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:24,580
Do not be detected while escorting the senator so I'm not escorting just yet.

1597
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:29,300
I know I said that wrong so I repeated it to seem like I said on purpose but the truth is I didn't.

1598
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:36,500
I like how the senator couldn't like perfectly see through it.

1599
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:40,820
By the way sorry I just noticed a mean tag in the reply under your schedule that Cephalophogre is that correct?

1600
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:43,060
Have I spelled it wrong?

1601
02:45:45,620 --> 02:45:47,220
I probably spelled it wrong then.

1602
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:53,860
This is what you guys need to tell me what to do because I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

1603
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:59,220
Friends these days unfortunately I'm not one of them.

1604
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:02,180
Cephalophogre!

1605
02:46:02,740 --> 02:46:04,740
He fights the guards and gives away money.

1606
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:14,740
So honey someone on Twitter made a VTuber fruit tier list and they fit you in impressive.

1607
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:17,540
Oh yeah they like my fringe tipped.

1608
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:21,860
Hold on I'm taking a sipping to Nicola.

1609
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:23,220
Did you guys get up and start to leave?

1610
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:26,420
I'm so sorry.

1611
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:30,260
I don't know what's going on with my tum tum I'm having to take more pain killers

1612
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:34,020
but I'm having them with food so it's not going to hurt me.

1613
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:36,820
I promise it's not going to hurt.

1614
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:44,580
Cephalophogre honestly.

1615
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:54,820
Oh burp warning.

1616
02:46:55,060 --> 02:47:00,980
I burp a lot when I eat so please brace yourself if you're not uh

1617
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:06,020
not that you're not into burping but I understand that some people being rude that burping is very

1618
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:08,100
rude but I

1619
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:12,260
Oh I liked her scream.

1620
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:21,620
Okay in order if you look away your assassin recruits will despawn faster

1621
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:25,380
and then they'll re like start reloading quicker.

1622
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:28,820
Did you see the art?

1623
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:38,020
I've been locked out of my Twitter and I keep getting locked out of it to the point where

1624
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:42,340
it's inaccessible and it keeps telling me to do these like stupid capture thing

1625
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:46,020
and it keeps saying um

1626
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:47,400
um

1627
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:49,800
no

1628
02:47:50,980 --> 02:47:51,480
well

1629
02:47:52,420 --> 02:48:00,340
I did not see them at all and so it says like verification complete you're human

1630
02:48:00,340 --> 02:48:06,980
and then it says error submitting and I can't do anything I don't know what I want me to do

1631
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:15,380
um so I've been locked out of my alt one I've not had a chance to check out my

1632
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:19,940
current one it's the music's a load of my ears sorry I need to hear my headset then

1633
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:24,340
then you turn the games on or is it just being a bit dramatic at this stage

1634
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:27,540
on the appropriate width of women's league

1635
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:32,180
not you you raise money for false causes to pay back the gambling debts

1636
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:35,060
they're gang violence and I'm right now barfy a smart win

1637
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:39,700
um am I allowed to confess I've already recorded it

1638
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:44,260
this is the most significant I sat in my recording this for 15 minutes

1639
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:50,340
I had one bottle of water and one can of cola and I fell ill after recording it

1640
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:58,980
but I already recorded it I'm so sorry if it's not your thing but I it's the truth I already

1641
02:48:58,980 --> 02:49:07,940
recorded it I thought it was funny but I don't really have manners so I was raised in a bar

1642
02:49:10,660 --> 02:49:18,660
I've just gone oh management unlocked my alternative twitter okay I'll go I'll look after

1643
02:49:18,660 --> 02:49:23,860
stream and then I'll see what I've missed because I think it's very possible I've missed a lot of

1644
02:49:23,860 --> 02:49:32,500
fan arts or clips oh someone clipped me plain assassin's creed and someone clipped me um

1645
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:39,860
um when me and the horse were beating up the captain um I was like giggling my little butt off

1646
02:49:39,860 --> 02:49:47,780
at the club it was so good I'm going to tweet it out um because like it was just so funny um

1647
02:49:47,780 --> 02:49:51,380
and like I really appreciate anyone that clips me because like clipping takes so much time

1648
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:56,580
how long will the audio be I think it's roughly 15 minutes after editing because

1649
02:49:57,300 --> 02:50:04,020
um I'm doing a lot of what I call live ASMR where like I don't edit out all my mistakes and stuff

1650
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:10,100
like I know this sounds a bit funny saying it like that but um

1651
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:22,500
uh sorry um what was the same word of gone I'm sorry my brain's too small to think and talk

1652
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:29,220
at the same time oh yeah live ASMR um I've really been enjoying doing it instead of like the super

1653
02:50:29,220 --> 02:50:34,900
hyper edited approach like if like I make a bump then I just lower the volume so it's still

1654
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:42,740
acceptable for ASMR and like if not like at one point my cat um came in my recording booth and

1655
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:48,820
I was like do you want to do ASMR with me and my baby boy was like so I'm just like going to leave

1656
02:50:48,900 --> 02:50:57,940
it in because it's just so precious and I really like it um like I've really enjoyed doing like

1657
02:50:57,940 --> 02:51:06,420
live ASMR instead of like try hard even more um like I've done like non-scripted ones as well

1658
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:17,060
where I'm rambling out my butt like so much um if it's not scripted my ramble ASMR is ridiculous

1659
02:51:17,060 --> 02:51:21,460
like it's not even ASMR honestly like it's just me like goofing off talking about whatever I like

1660
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:31,860
um whoa whoa I've accidentally hired this group when I'm how is the senator under attack

1661
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:36,420
I don't even know he's under attack there's no one that patrols that way

1662
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:44,740
as long as I don't get discovered I could me and yeah what happened we're addicted to the yapping

1719
02:58:13,860 --> 02:58:20,100
doing this in an hour and I'm like I feel like those who want to be here already know the drill

1720
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:27,620

foreign sweet okay

1732
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:43,380
I kind of plan to do like one endurance game stream a week so next week is Skyrim for endurance

1733
02:59:44,580 --> 02:59:52,500
then we have Elden Ring for two weeks in a row after that so I'm playing the DLC with you guys

1734
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:58,420
first and then I'm playing multiplayer with sin sister um

1735
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:08,820
and we also have shot callers and heart rate winners and all that jazz um thankfully sin sister

1736
03:00:08,820 --> 03:00:16,180
is an endurance streamer so like if you ever get annoyed like uh I hate it like when streamers like

1737
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:22,420
don't finish a game I don't like either which is why I would love to get endurance streamers first

1738
03:00:22,980 --> 03:00:28,740
borderlands too I would love to do a vtuber playthrough like you know the vtuber's the problem is

1739
03:00:30,180 --> 03:00:36,740
if people aren't endurance streamers that's like oh so long whereas if you can find an

1740
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:42,900
endurance it takes maybe three streams max if you want to just blast through the campaign maybe even two

1741
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:44,900
honestly

1742
03:00:52,500 --> 03:01:03,220
I'm sucking my fingers I don't know why my tongue's coming out oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue

1743
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:10,660
that's so cool I love this I don't know if I've ever been

1744
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:15,700
borderlands too is like a hoot in a hole or it's like a fun game honestly

1745
03:01:16,420 --> 03:01:26,900
oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow while I do this yes I will look at Marshmallow that's so silly

1746
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:38,500
oh my goodness I have a hundred more questions than I did yesterday oops

1747
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:45,780
any chance there'll be a full body pillow for sale in the future yes um

1748

1752
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:23,860

1753
03:02:23,860 --> 03:02:32,340
um or they would come out quite expensive that's the only um issue hi good to hear you yeah it's

good to be heard didn't it um maybe a hundred percent open to any merch uh we are going to

03:02:37,860 --> 03:02:44,100
establish ourselves first and then I'm gonna reach out to a very unique merchandise line

1756
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:48,420
because I have no idea how to bridge a connection between that but I'll give it a shot you know

1757
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:53,780
you can only do but ask if you do not ask you do not receive so I will ask I will see if it's possible

1758
03:02:54,340 --> 03:03:02,740

type of mousepad designs will be for the others I know what mine is my big badonk adonk I take

1760
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:19,300
a bite of my muffin I'm just hi strongy I really like the Assassin's Creed streams wanted to give

1761
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:24,580
you uh feedback that I've tipped in the stream elements paid around five times now between

1762
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:32,580
the two streams but it never came up oh no wait wait wait wait wait why would it not come up

1763
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:46,100
why would you get filtered I don't it was broken before it's fixed now but why would it not show up

1764
03:03:46,500 --> 03:03:57,380
I have bejinga narrow tiny spiny and bejinga again for today it broke yesterday please tell me if

1765
03:03:57,380 --> 03:04:03,940
your money didn't go through or did go through the PayPal was broken because you guys gave us

1766
03:04:03,940 --> 03:04:10,500
so much money you broke the cricket PayPal but it's unbroken that's what's fun it is a legal

1767
03:04:10,500 --> 03:04:20,660
requirement of all reeflings to love strong stuff um I also was thinking I need to find an artist to

1768
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:28,980
do this one that's good with all body types I would love for our six month anniversary to have a mouse

1769
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:36,260
pad of all of us together like one of those big flat mouse pads I would adore to have us all together

1770
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:39,620
absolutely adore it

1771
03:04:42,180 --> 03:04:46,500
but I would need to get like a really good artist for that like I would not want to waste money

1772
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:51,460
dicking around with artists like I would want an artist to like fucking smoke it

1773
03:04:54,580 --> 03:05:02,020
I know I adore it okay um since there's a notification discord server would it be possible

1774
03:05:02,020 --> 03:05:08,740
for you to upload the unarchive stuff the discord like a thread and unarchive stuff do you mean

1775
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:17,300
like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream that went kaput um I think because we like can't we shouldn't

1776
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:23,460
really host it because I got taken off so I don't want to like be the ones responsible if that makes

1777
03:05:23,460 --> 03:05:30,980
sense like archive annons shout out to archive annons like for saving everyone's butts I for me

1778
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:34,420
I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion please you're more than welcome to

1779
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:39,700
give me your opinion again and marshmallow but archive annons if a broke don't fix it

1780
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:45,060
they've been doing fantastic they've been catching um what's been put out there and yeah

1781
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:47,140
hmm

1782
03:05:57,620 --> 03:06:04,660
our alternative stream is going to be free to access yes I do not personally believe in paying more

1783
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:11,380
than like 10 us dollars to like fully support your oh she and get everything that they put out

1784
03:06:11,460 --> 03:06:16,260
there and the girls have shown an interest in playing alternative games and doing some other

1785
03:06:16,260 --> 03:06:25,220
stuff um but I would not like them to charge for it I'm going to say to them like let's not charge

1786
03:06:25,220 --> 03:06:29,620
but obviously I will never hold you back from giving any tips to the girls

1787
03:06:31,060 --> 03:06:34,740
and you can always tip as a thank you to content that you enjoy

1788
03:06:35,460 --> 03:06:45,060
but that's just me um like someone said um do I plan on raising the prices of what's been

1789
03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:51,860
established no I don't I think I think 10 us dollars per month for all the content that the

1790
03:06:51,860 --> 03:07:00,500
girls put out is fair and I think it's good value for money and I think it also shows that

1791
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:07,860
uh like the end goal isn't great and again like 8 20 split comes into it type thing um

1792
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:11,620
and it goes up in their favor next year type stuff if they want to hang about like

1793
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:22,980
I think if it's more than 10 us dollars you're you're not taking the piss but I very much push

1794
03:07:22,980 --> 03:07:33,060
for value for money and I hope I know region doesn't always change the price of membership

1795
03:07:33,060 --> 03:07:40,500
regionally which is obviously a big thing that's hard to overcome because we don't set the like we

1796
03:07:40,500 --> 03:07:47,380
set the price but if the website doesn't do an alternative payment style then you're like you're

1797
03:07:47,380 --> 03:07:52,980
getting shafted in other countries like there is a streamer that talked about selling games and

1798
03:07:53,780 --> 03:07:59,380
it was like oh brazil because they lowered the price in brazil like it was fine and all that

1799
03:07:59,380 --> 03:08:08,580
jazz i'm sorry i'm rambling i'm not making any sense um by the way cuddles i sometimes make a

1800
03:08:08,580 --> 03:08:18,340
lot of clips as you probably remember from back then are you goober we may be goober i'm happy for

1801
03:08:18,340 --> 03:08:24,900
you to use my clips with whatever you want whenever but i would prefer to keep the clips of you as

1802
03:08:24,900 --> 03:08:31,540
gay can't is possible and i only share those with the reeflings really uh and i posted group clips

1803
03:08:31,540 --> 03:08:37,300
with the other girls i'm happy for the clips of the other girls in the group collab to be used to

1804
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:40,980
monetize and shoot oh that's so nice of you whatever you want not like it really matters what my

1805
03:08:40,980 --> 03:08:47,140
opinion is yes it does you mean that you goober um and i would like to keep comfy streams to you

1806
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:51,700
as long as possible while you go naturally and share well i've got good news for you

1807
03:08:54,260 --> 03:08:58,660
the nature of my content gate creeps me automatically do you want to hear why a little

1808
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:07,940
my goal of a ASMR video every time i get like 1000 subscribers the reason why that naturally gate

1809
03:09:07,940 --> 03:09:12,820
keeps me is because someone will come into the livestream after consuming that content and they'll

1810
03:09:12,820 --> 03:09:19,220
go when ASMR when ASMR stream and then when they see me rambling my head off about a 14 year old

1811
03:09:19,220 --> 03:09:25,540
game having the time of my life they're gonna get bored aren't they they're only here for ASMR

1812
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:37,220
five heads i'm playing chess in 4d already i already did it myself they're weak they can't

1813
03:09:37,220 --> 03:09:43,860
handle the strongy they want the they want the strong ASMR whisper in you they can't handle

1814
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:51,380
the ramble and they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the so by default i naturally

1815
03:09:51,380 --> 03:09:55,300
get keep myself you're welcome love you reeflings always had you in mind

1816
03:09:58,100 --> 03:10:00,660
only the strongest reefling can survive

1817
03:10:04,660 --> 03:10:10,020
first time doing this listen to your audio through oh wait i don't think i can read this one out loud

03:10:20,900 --> 03:10:25,780
that's such a good segment love that idea i'm teal i'm stealing it now my idea now young

1821
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:34,580
they tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent i just sound like a bagpipes

1822
03:10:36,340 --> 03:10:40,180
i can't handle the scottish ramble also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other

1841
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:53,220
why because they're creators that they were more experienced who you think are better so clearly

1845
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:16,500
afraid to be herself and treat her with love and respect no last kick that impossible shame

1846
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:23,540
syndrome to the curve we love you oh you're oh she case closed doofus oh thank you evening i love

1847
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:34,180
you replay is that a bag of chips no it's a bowl i'm like the p-snacks are really hard i can

1848
03:13:34,180 --> 03:13:47,300
like dink them on the bowl without them cracking oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about

1849
03:13:47,300 --> 03:13:53,940
on the other stream but i forgot oh my god right hopefully i don't forget this time there's a really

1850
03:13:53,940 --> 03:14:03,380
brave refling who messaged me well he's not a reflin but he's asked for helps reflings okay

1851
03:14:05,140 --> 03:14:10,900
i i'm going to paraphrase it because i can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but

1852
03:14:13,140 --> 03:14:21,940
basically this person is struggling to brush their teeth and i think it would be very nice

1853
03:14:21,940 --> 03:14:26,740
if we brush our teeth together after stream like when streams ending will brush our teeth

1854
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:33,620
together i know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and i think it would be

1855
03:14:33,620 --> 03:14:39,460
nice reflings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that so if you would

1856
03:14:39,460 --> 03:14:44,340
like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream i will give a roughly 30 minute warning

1857
03:14:45,220 --> 03:14:50,900
so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad for your enamel to brush

1858
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:56,980
and i think it can be a really nice thing we reflins can do for someone even even if together

1859
03:14:56,980 --> 03:15:03,860
we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have helped that person who

1860
03:15:03,860 --> 03:15:10,020
was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come out with um i won't say too much

1861
03:15:10,020 --> 03:15:18,580
about it but um you know you were very straightforward and said that um you don't you know consider yourself

1862
03:15:18,660 --> 03:15:27,700
a refling and that's okay um and you know we can't promise that we we can help everyone but we

1863
03:15:27,700 --> 03:15:33,540
would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something nice together and it's a lot easier when

1864
03:15:33,540 --> 03:15:39,460
you do something together with someone so uh yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out

1865
03:15:39,460 --> 03:15:43,300
i would like to brush my teeth with you when i end stream i don't know if you're out there

1866
03:15:43,700 --> 03:15:46,420
but uh we can definitely do that together yes it's

1867
03:15:48,340 --> 03:15:49,620
i see no problem yeah

1868
03:15:53,380 --> 03:15:57,620
yes unfortunately i don't have a consistent time where we cannot brush your teeth

1869
03:15:57,620 --> 03:16:01,620
i would just have to be roughly 30 minutes before my stream ends sorry i'm pushing in my chair

1870
03:16:02,420 --> 03:16:03,460
you're pushing my chair

1871
03:16:05,220 --> 03:16:10,180
hi strani congrats on debut i was wondering um nope you're done

1872
03:16:10,660 --> 03:16:18,020
uh any games coming out that you're excited for uh multiplayer the binding of isaac apparently

1873
03:16:18,020 --> 03:16:22,660
someone went data mining and saw that there was a new repentance after plus or something

1874
03:16:23,220 --> 03:16:26,980
so there might be patches to current items which would be very interesting

1875
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:33,540
forming new habits with my oh she sounds like a tuition name honestly join oral improvement

1876
03:16:34,420 --> 03:16:39,860
she's getting closer to i am the urge to crack a british joke oh my teeth are mangled honestly

1877
03:16:39,860 --> 03:16:45,940
my teeth are mangled i'm like they're healthy but they're just all squint and it's like i like the

1878
03:16:45,940 --> 03:16:52,420
look of i oh my god there's apparently a pandemic happening in america with veneers uh veneers are

1879
03:16:52,420 --> 03:16:56,420
like these fake things you put on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look

1880
03:16:56,420 --> 03:17:03,060
perfect but i feel like teeth have personality like i like my wee squinty winty teeth um i just

1881
03:17:03,060 --> 03:17:09,140
i've never seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah i do understand for people that do need

1882
03:17:09,140 --> 03:17:15,540
braces like there's probably something else going on but i like i was obsessed and i never got braces

1883
03:17:15,540 --> 03:17:22,020
um and yeah i just have naturally squint teeth like they didn't come out perfect and that's fine

1884
03:17:22,020 --> 03:17:24,740
that's just how it is um

1885
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:32,820
mommy i really need a hug debut has made me really emotional oh a little reflame

1886
03:17:33,620 --> 03:17:38,900
trust me i know this isn't about me but i'm talking to you now you should be so proud of

1887
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:43,220
what you've accomplished i am the girls have done fantastic and i'm having a good time with my

1888
03:17:43,220 --> 03:17:49,860
weakness you and the girls but i feel much more lonely than i did before oh watching everyone interact

1889
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:55,620
with each other the girls respond into mario's maro's and such i don't even know why i suppose i'm

1890
03:17:55,620 --> 03:18:01,300
just envious of the attention that everyone's getting i feel so out of place i'm so sad i haven't

1891
03:18:01,300 --> 03:18:06,740
even been able to listen to your audios to sleep i'm sorry for being selfish it's not selfish at all

1892
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:11,540
are you are you maybe one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything

1893
03:18:13,300 --> 03:18:19,380
or have i managed to successfully accidentally dodge all your messages and stream and i would

1894
03:18:19,380 --> 03:18:25,060
be a bit upset too if you were talking away and i accidentally never read out any of your messages

1895
03:18:25,060 --> 03:18:30,420
so i do apologize if that happens and well i'm sorry for a little reflame i never want to make

1896
03:18:30,420 --> 03:18:38,020
you feel lonely if you are a lurker and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your

1897
03:18:38,020 --> 03:18:43,540
comfort level is you're allowed to be that uh you can always say you can always be at arm's length

1898
03:18:43,540 --> 03:18:52,420
or you can always be attached at my head you can sit on my head if you like um and it's okay

1899
03:18:53,940 --> 03:18:57,620
but just i don't know hopefully it doesn't make you feel lonely like

1900
03:18:57,620 --> 03:19:02,740
oh by then i get to show you my childhood game you guys get to show me you get to suggest to me

1901
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:10,100
your childhood game i want to sit on stroney's head yeah lurkers are beloved yes i understand

1902
03:19:10,100 --> 03:19:16,660
for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve-wracking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and

1903
03:19:16,660 --> 03:19:24,180
like i i read out what you're saying stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my

1904
03:19:24,180 --> 03:19:29,060
autistic diagnosis please refer to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only

1905
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:35,700
reason i went off instead of 14 hours of full gameplay is because of bod okay i'm usually playing

1906
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:40,820
something and lurking yeah like it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with

1907
03:19:40,820 --> 03:19:47,860
lurking absolutely not um don't be shy reflame stroney isn't always reading my comments but yeah

1908
03:19:48,580 --> 03:19:57,220
it's um a gooberino so i do apologize if i've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully

1909
03:19:57,220 --> 03:20:05,220
it doesn't happen in the future um i can only apologize uh sometimes hi stroney want you to

1910
03:20:05,220 --> 03:20:10,500
know what i think it's very cute when you narrowed out about sasa's group brotherhood well i'm getting

1911
03:20:10,580 --> 03:20:13,860
rolled in the dlcs clearly i'm not built for the dlc

1912
03:20:18,020 --> 03:20:23,300
i have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice i lurk when i'm at work um yeah a lot of people

1913
03:20:23,300 --> 03:20:30,740
like lurking and listening to stroney podcast wait if you don't see the screen when i'm streaming

1914
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:38,500
and like i'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us oh take this oh like are you like oh what's

1915
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:44,500
going on or can you use context clues i like to have the stream on in the background but i do like

1916
03:20:44,500 --> 03:20:48,980
to interact i'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact i know some people shy like

1917
03:20:48,980 --> 03:20:56,980
that hi coddles just wondering if you could forward something to management i know vealer or not on

1918
03:20:56,980 --> 03:21:05,540
holodex but you can still view the stream of the url but i think the girls have something set that

1919
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:09,540
prevents their streams from being viewed through third-party sites well mine is fame

1920
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:18,500
i can't be right people is true screen off pretending stroney is physically

1921
03:21:18,500 --> 03:21:25,220
throwing the refill and then around for sport um to be honest you talk enough that there isn't

1922
03:21:25,220 --> 03:21:31,460
dead air so i don't have to wonder about what's going on yeah i can't believe it wait was there

1923
03:21:31,460 --> 03:21:36,900
really no dead air in the last stream i must have been quiet at some sections there's no way

1924
03:21:37,700 --> 03:21:42,180
i had the video playing i just can't fully watch the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long

1925
03:21:42,180 --> 03:21:49,140
for the average adult uh okay management's gonna look into holodex i think that puts all their

1926
03:21:49,140 --> 03:21:54,020
streams together we were thinking about hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules

1927
03:21:54,020 --> 03:21:58,340
but it cost like more money and it was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it

1928
03:21:58,340 --> 03:22:04,180
for free we're just gonna let holodex take over who goes there i died for yourself there was almost

1929
03:22:04,180 --> 03:22:11,140
no dead air outside of breaks and they wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after i've been

1930
03:22:11,140 --> 03:22:19,620
done with you i watched for about five hours and wasn't it okay you talked the entire time i do i'm

1931
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:24,900
very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if i missed it but what are we

1932
03:22:25,540 --> 03:22:28,900
yes your reeflings i was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you

1933
03:22:30,980 --> 03:22:38,820
i've lost some gnar twerk of a nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out

1934
03:22:38,820 --> 03:22:44,900
who i follow on strawnycuddles on twitter i don't use twitter much you're much better given a like

1935
03:22:44,900 --> 03:22:51,700
and a subscribe to this youtube channel i am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush i use twitter

1936
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:57,940
now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar hey sweet

1937
03:22:57,940 --> 03:23:07,700
cakes want to make a samar basically so i do i think your longest dead air was the sprint

1938
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:14,260
section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like monomogged

1939
03:23:14,260 --> 03:23:19,620
because i'm just that good at being a yap or hey strawny loving the assassin's creed i was

1940
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:26,260
wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two i haven't there are fun games

1941
03:23:26,260 --> 03:23:30,020
that i think you may like even if you don't play them i still appreciate you for beating

1942
03:23:30,020 --> 03:23:36,100
this message i have not i've never heard of them or i can't remember them being on the cover of

1943
03:23:36,100 --> 03:23:47,700
an xbox 360 so probably not have i ever played dragon age i played the demo of dragon age one

1944
03:23:48,340 --> 03:23:54,820
i think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if i

1945
03:23:54,820 --> 03:24:01,060
remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age i've done i don't know what it's like um

1946
03:24:02,420 --> 03:24:10,900
but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well am i flamboyant

1947
03:24:10,900 --> 03:24:14,660
because of my watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and i'm like

1948
03:24:14,660 --> 03:24:20,340
honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay

1949
03:24:23,380 --> 03:24:28,020
congratulations on your debut i'm looking forward to supporting all of the talents i must

1950
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:34,020
apologize i said that's so wrong i must apologize but i find myself confused what you meant by

1951
03:24:34,020 --> 03:24:39,940
vealers collab restrictions and i'm looking forward to clarification you describe the

1952
03:24:39,940 --> 03:24:47,140
collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me

1953
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:55,540
my collab restrictions are um i'm like if i don't know that someone is like me mentally then i can't

1954
03:24:55,540 --> 03:24:59,220
stream with them because i'm dumb i can stream with the girls though that's fine and the girls can

1955
03:24:59,220 --> 03:25:07,140
stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with males or interact

1956
03:25:07,140 --> 03:25:16,820
with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good literally none of

1957
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:25,300
the girls have broken that rule scrawny slaps of each of us behind i can make you a star yeah um

1958
03:25:27,380 --> 03:25:31,300
it seems odd for me for them to be rules i've never heard of any other agency that has an

1959
03:25:31,300 --> 03:25:39,060
outright rule against them against who sorry i'm not read this properly uh especially value

1960
03:25:39,060 --> 03:25:47,060
and freedom doesn't it apologize if it comes off with really critical however i think clarification

1961
03:25:47,060 --> 03:25:55,940
were an issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want oh this is asking about male collabs

1962
03:25:55,940 --> 03:26:04,660
the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed would the girls be able to do that

1963
03:26:06,740 --> 03:26:14,820
i mean i would never stop them from an opportunity like would they be on the same team as a guy like

1964
03:26:14,820 --> 03:26:20,500
i don't think i don't think that's like advised if it was like that like i wouldn't advise it

1965
03:26:21,220 --> 03:26:26,820
however none of the girls have given me an indication to ever even do that like i think

1966
03:26:26,820 --> 03:26:34,020
we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are uh following japanese idol culture

1967
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:41,460
and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here which is terrible don't say that i love don't

1968
03:26:41,460 --> 03:26:51,780
say that part of it keep burping don't apologize oh yeah oh yeah hello again friend of a friend

1969
03:26:51,780 --> 03:27:06,180
i knew you well the truth is just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on

1970
03:27:07,060 --> 03:27:10,900
i don't remember the words pick it up every time

1971
03:27:20,020 --> 03:27:25,060
hi stroney i think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not

1972
03:27:25,060 --> 03:27:33,220
too much oh no so the way i i've been taught v tripper culture i'm so sorry but i've been taught

1973
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:40,500
by the majority v tripper culture i'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know or

1974
03:27:42,260 --> 03:27:50,500
membership however because and the reason why i can't do it when it's like just saying hi section

1975
03:27:50,500 --> 03:27:57,540
or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and i really

1976
03:27:57,540 --> 03:28:05,220
don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me

1977
03:28:07,380 --> 03:28:11,620
we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um uh at the start of the ASMR

1978
03:28:11,620 --> 03:28:17,380
stream i am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do

1979
03:28:17,380 --> 03:28:22,180

1980
03:28:22,180 --> 03:28:30,740
how much i enjoy video being so up cuddles was thinking of a tag oh i missed the tag i kind of

1981
03:28:30,740 --> 03:28:40,420
finished them oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um i'm currently

1982
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:47,540
getting a new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because

1983
03:28:47,540 --> 03:28:51,780
he can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because i can only guess what you want

1984
03:28:51,940 --> 03:28:59,460
to hear and so much um so like roughly the first three months of scripts are me and then it goes

1985
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:05,540
to other script writers and then it goes to the script manager but we're testing script manager

1986
03:29:05,540 --> 03:29:11,060
but if all goes well my responsibilities lessen so much and i can stream so much more

1987
03:29:14,580 --> 03:29:19,780
well at the start of the stream you were 3.5k now you're at 3.3 heck yeah that means i don't

1988
03:29:19,780 --> 03:29:24,100
have to edit the 4k thousand anytime soon that's fine

1989
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:37,300
hey i have to say that i think you amazing i don't get to interact with many scottish people online

1990
03:29:37,300 --> 03:29:43,940
that's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my scottish life to become a v-tweeter that's why

1991
03:29:43,940 --> 03:29:49,860
there's no scottish v-tubers do you know how i know i've hurt myself my finger is bleeding why

1992
03:29:49,860 --> 03:29:56,660
what did i cut myself on i've not touched anything sharp is there anything sharp in this room

1993
03:29:58,260 --> 03:30:01,620
ouch it stings hopefully i can still keep gaming

1994
03:30:02,740 --> 03:30:07,700
scotland only has one computer yeah yeah no like genuinely there's a reason why there's not a lot

1995
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:16,100
of scottish v-tubers is if you genuinely like grew up around well like grew up around like normal

1996
03:30:16,100 --> 03:30:22,100
friends uh you would genuinely be like bullied so hard like bully culture like in america and

1997
03:30:22,100 --> 03:30:28,420
australia and the uk is so prevalent like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly different

1998
03:30:28,420 --> 03:30:35,780
from the status quo you get sicked on like a like a hound like sick um it's crazy pour some

1999
03:30:35,780 --> 03:30:42,340
zura milk on it honestly i don't know i can't remember how i cut myself my wee fingy i'm okay though

2000
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:52,340
someone says hi stroney i missed all of your livestreams rip but i do have a few questions

2001
03:30:52,340 --> 03:30:57,620
what happens if one of the girls wants to leave they uh they leave question mark

2002
03:30:58,740 --> 03:31:02,820
they get to go we don't have a non-compete uh i don't believe in them i don't think they're nice

2003
03:31:02,820 --> 03:31:07,780
they are not kind if you no longer work for the vealer agency why would we prevent you from

2004
03:31:07,780 --> 03:31:15,700
making money elsewhere that is uh called being uh messed up will you retire the character yeah

2005
03:31:17,140 --> 03:31:23,300
also if you can work the plans for gen two will you bring in six new girls and retire the other

2006
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:27,780
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what

2007
03:31:29,060 --> 03:31:35,780
if gen two is the thing there will be six new girls on board um so well when feature agencies come

2008
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:41,700
out with generations uh everyone can be active at the same time it's not a problem so generation one

2009
03:31:41,700 --> 03:31:46,500
all six active generation two all six active so that would be 12 total then if generation three

2010
03:31:46,500 --> 03:31:51,780
and everyone's happy with their cuts and things are all nice and swimmingly and then generation

2011
03:31:51,780 --> 03:32:00,260
three and there will be a total of 18 succubi and v-sucky wow i really that's very daunting to

2012
03:32:00,260 --> 03:32:06,340
think of but thank god i'm not the script master anymore because if i was a script master i could

2013
03:32:06,340 --> 03:32:15,300
not stream i genuinely could not stream um there are absolutely no interest for any generations

2014
03:32:15,300 --> 03:32:22,180
after three no spin-off generations no secret plans no save for work generation

2015
03:32:23,140 --> 03:32:30,420
none of that i and i am exhausted i took insane amounts of hp damage getting gen one out

2016
03:32:31,220 --> 03:32:39,860
i am ill i want to get myself better and i'm going to stream and i'm going to enjoy every second of

2017
03:32:39,860 --> 03:32:48,900
it um but yeah we we uh we are not having to retire gen one to get gen two out no um sorry

2018
03:32:50,740 --> 03:32:54,580
lastly and this may be taboo to ask and if you don't i'll read it in my head

2019
03:32:58,580 --> 03:33:01,460
that is controversial it's not controversial

2020
03:33:01,700 --> 03:33:07,780
and what's an item you would copy and steal from the other girls

to the fuel stack because i don't want to get in any trouble

2176
03:51:00,420 --> 03:51:13,220
i think we just got 50% DNA so i think we might actually have

2177
03:51:18,900 --> 03:51:25,940
i think we might actually have a new pristine memory unlock if it's 25 percent then 50 then 75

2178
03:51:26,500 --> 03:51:30,020
that reason said then should we help

2179
03:51:36,100 --> 03:51:37,380
i can't protect him

2180
03:51:40,820 --> 03:51:46,180
speaking of smoking before to my friend lu you want to smoke go for it no nothing for me to say

2181
03:51:46,580 --> 03:51:58,900
i'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now i think we're okay with the render

2182
03:51:58,900 --> 03:52:06,980
difference i have no idea what we're missing and not done yet we're replaying easy missions that

2183
03:52:06,980 --> 03:52:12,260
i failed in order to get higher dna sequence christina's story doesn't unlock until you have

2184
03:52:12,260 --> 03:52:17,300
high synchronicity so i'm having to go back and redo missions that like are easy and they'll

2185
03:52:17,300 --> 03:52:22,100
raise our overall percentage and then we should be able to finish whatever happens with christina

2186
03:52:22,100 --> 03:52:27,700
because it like ended and it didn't make any sense like at all

2187
03:52:34,020 --> 03:52:37,140
right okay we're done this part we just need to do the benchmark night

2188
03:52:37,220 --> 03:52:44,740
how far are you planning on taking vila or dominate no not domination i just want the girls to

2189
03:52:45,380 --> 03:52:52,660
achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do and um have a good time you know it's kind

2190
03:52:52,660 --> 03:52:57,220
of like what are vila's dreams vila's dreams or whatever the girls dreams are because we want

2191
03:52:57,300 --> 03:52:58,500
them to be happy

2192
03:53:02,340 --> 03:53:05,060
interesting what about alcohol oh i can't have alcohol

2193
03:53:06,340 --> 03:53:09,220
if you guys drink it's fine i'm gonna stop you um

2194
03:53:10,420 --> 03:53:16,820
but yeah like uh alcohol and me don't go well um it speeds up my heart rate it makes me feel

2195
03:53:16,820 --> 03:53:23,540
uncomfortable and i get i'm very late wait even though i'm Scottish i'm so freaking late wait it's

so annoying i'm stinky like why

2197
03:53:28,660 --> 03:53:35,780

2198
03:53:35,780 --> 03:53:40,260
out where alcohol is really bad but i'm not gonna say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something

2199
03:53:40,260 --> 03:53:53,380
like that um i kind of learned that um so when you feel a buzz from alcohol you don't have to drink

2200
03:53:53,380 --> 03:53:58,100
any further than that point to keep the buzz going that's not how alcohol works i only recently

2201
03:53:58,100 --> 03:54:06,580
learned that back anyway and but like i won't be shy of doing like drunk uh karaoke i'll drink for

2202
03:54:06,580 --> 03:54:16,020
the both of us honestly there's less of you to fill alcohol with oh please please excuse me i'm

03:55:18,500 --> 03:55:28,180
going out friends that go like um i'll like nightclub or rave or any of that which is where a

2212
03:55:28,180 --> 03:55:35,140
lot of drinking culture comes into play in the uk um like the aim when you go out with your friends

2213
03:55:35,140 --> 03:55:41,860
is to get like plastered which is like just not very pleasant um

2214
03:55:43,860 --> 03:55:49,460
she has her own full plated armor if only we had a very strong kneecap

2215
03:55:51,460 --> 03:55:55,140
sure would be a shame oh i did a challenge

2216
03:55:57,620 --> 03:56:01,780
right let's do this without getting in trouble this time

2217
03:56:02,660 --> 03:56:11,220

ah i have my friend group love getting hammered and half did not yeah like i didn't really

2220
03:56:26,900 --> 03:56:30,820
experience any of that so it just never really became a thing

2221
03:56:32,420 --> 03:56:35,860
and like obviously hang up right i definitely can do it this thing

2222
03:56:36,740 --> 03:56:39,460
yeah okay easy easy hundred percent right there

2223
03:56:43,220 --> 03:56:50,180

i'm going out or getting good at it it was going out or getting good at ac brotherhood

2226
03:57:06,420 --> 03:57:12,740
literally i like i just play video games all day i'm sure it is fun if you're into it but like

2227
03:57:12,740 --> 03:57:18,740
i just have no interest i have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk

2228
03:57:18,820 --> 03:57:21,060
review of movies okay

2229
03:57:25,300 --> 03:57:25,860
not again

2230
03:57:31,460 --> 03:57:36,180
did it twice i'm sure there's a freaking hay bale down there or something

2231
03:57:37,460 --> 03:57:41,380
drinking with good family friends is probably me well you're getting hammered

2232
03:57:41,380 --> 03:57:49,540
well you were out there getting hammered i was so out of the story himself right wait

2233
03:57:49,540 --> 03:57:55,940
those missions only went up the sink to 51% so didn't you christina get unlocked at 50%

2234
03:57:59,860 --> 03:58:00,260
oh

2235
03:58:04,580 --> 03:58:07,140
what do you mean i've only done 50% of the game

2236
03:58:12,020 --> 03:58:17,220
uh right those ones are difficult so i actually don't want to do them

2237
03:58:18,660 --> 03:58:23,140
what's this one the baron de voir gatekeeper 50 50

2238
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:29,460
what are you don't lose any health squares

2239
03:58:32,340 --> 03:58:35,780
okay this one's super easy we can do this one i'm literally doing it easiest to hard

2240
03:58:36,740 --> 03:58:38,820
and then we'll get hard at the end

2241
03:58:41,540 --> 03:58:44,900
how should i beat your first try and get glue sorry i need any sub saying that because it's not

2242
03:58:44,900 --> 03:58:47,220
very nice because like i completely understand

2243
03:58:51,140 --> 03:58:56,180
i did it again it makes that noise i think that must be an audio mistake or something because

2244
03:59:00,900 --> 03:59:05,540
i was studying the hidden bleed i was such an assassin's creed fanboy

2245
03:59:05,540 --> 03:59:11,380
i used to think it would be so cool if i got like the assassin's creed logo branded on my finger

2246
03:59:12,020 --> 03:59:20,340
i was so impressionable as a child you're truly a man after my so impressionable not very smart

2247
03:59:20,340 --> 03:59:23,860
it's kind of character i will get the armor my troops will gather it from the dead

2248
03:59:23,860 --> 03:59:29,060
what's been streamed tomorrow is a needy streamer overload needy streamer over than that's you

2249
03:59:29,060 --> 03:59:34,100
it's actually a pretty good tale for me to kill them without a fight the armor has to stay clean

2250
03:59:34,100 --> 03:59:39,220
next small fish the ac logo in tattoo only refilling assassins allowed inside

2251
03:59:41,460 --> 03:59:46,260
okay if this is just don't be actually well i am here

2252
03:59:50,100 --> 03:59:55,220
no not while i'm here we have to do it outside of a mission no i always go that way and it's

2253
03:59:55,220 --> 03:59:57,060
like the longest way to find anyone

2254
04:00:06,580 --> 04:00:10,100
that's the good reason that young people can't get tattoos yes i would like to be

2255
04:00:10,100 --> 04:00:14,340
sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers probably the sega logo on me at one point as well

2256
04:00:14,340 --> 04:00:25,460
for um for don't get detected for um sonic heroes i always loved it when i was like

2257
04:00:29,220 --> 04:00:34,180
did that not alert anyone they're actually so efficient at fighting that didn't alert anyone

2258
04:00:35,940 --> 04:00:40,420
you guys get okay our assassins are pretty high level i'm pretty sure they can handle

2259
04:00:40,420 --> 04:00:46,420
what's about to happen oh there's a patrol route oh there's a big old fight going on

2260
04:00:48,100 --> 04:00:55,460
okay we're at five costumes they're still going for it whoa they're getting beaten up by the big guys

2261
04:00:57,300 --> 04:01:02,820
oh they're they're fighting back they're beating them up four to two oh she lost the health bar

2262
04:01:02,820 --> 04:01:07,220
wow i actually thought the uh oh they're going for this they're doing it they're doing it they're

2263
04:01:07,220 --> 04:01:12,900
going for the patrolers as well oh we got 10 and that one that was that was a really good one

2264
04:01:13,860 --> 04:01:16,660
uh what's over here another french patel thing

2265
04:01:20,900 --> 04:01:25,540
when needy streamer overload okay uh i think that's definitely going to be a shorter stream

2266
04:01:25,540 --> 04:01:30,100
however when i do have shorter streams i'm going to like be working on ASMR collabs and stuff so

2267
04:01:30,100 --> 04:01:42,660
there's no homie more content coming america here can oh that's actually for two assassins to

2268
04:01:42,660 --> 04:01:46,660
take on that big old group that's quite a lot yeah one of them just lost the health bit

2269
04:01:48,420 --> 04:01:53,380
i actually think i'm gonna have to send in more assassins you know

2270
04:01:54,580 --> 04:01:58,660
oh they've lost two health bars this is getting this is getting juicy this is getting juicy

2271
04:01:58,660 --> 04:02:04,820
oh the other one's lost one as well oh it's getting juicy it's getting juicy oh oh there's

2272
04:02:04,820 --> 04:02:09,940
losing three i don't want to get detected because that will ruin this little sequence but uh i will

2279
04:02:53,140 --> 04:02:57,460
oh right everyone despawn right this instant

2280
04:02:59,540 --> 04:03:04,980
my heart right they'll heal up so whenever your assassin is low they'll heal up um

2281
04:03:06,500 --> 04:03:08,900
i thought we lost them oh my goodness

2282
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:16,100
i thought we i was like i was like what i called in another assassin on that guy that was in

2283
04:03:16,100 --> 04:03:20,020
particular is harassing them i was like where are they where are they like why aren't they

2284
04:03:20,020 --> 04:03:24,260
coming from but i was like oh wait i can shoot off my horse like i can still attack technically

2285
04:03:25,540 --> 04:03:32,740
i just need to not be discovered that's also i'm gonna wait to call in my assassins to do this

2286
04:03:32,740 --> 04:03:36,020
i really don't want to actually only get caught i'll be annoyed at myself if i do

2287
04:03:37,220 --> 04:03:39,220
there's another guard post all the way over here

2288
04:03:42,100 --> 04:03:44,340
excuse me pardon me come through

2289
04:03:45,220 --> 04:03:49,620
oh wow yeah there's a big one over here

2290
04:03:52,020 --> 04:03:59,700
maybe big like mine okay let's just send in guards and guards and like this

2291
04:04:01,540 --> 04:04:06,980
fill health already there you go hold on super simple super easy got 100 let's

2292
04:04:07,940 --> 04:04:13,380
literally that's all i had to do last time i wonder if i didn't have all a say a signals um

2293
04:04:14,500 --> 04:04:20,740
doing oh no my track is bugging out again please stop what's this one don't take any damage

2294
04:04:21,700 --> 04:04:29,220
don't lose any health squares that one's not easy because of how many enemies can just swing

2295
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:38,900
at you and that first one i'll try it do i plan on unlocking all the endings on needy streamer

2296
04:04:38,900 --> 04:04:41,940
i don't know how much i'm gonna like it i'm gonna play it for the first time

2297
04:04:42,660 --> 04:04:46,500
i think it's like a click game which honestly might make it super simple

2298
04:04:47,140 --> 04:04:50,660
if i like it then i'll try and get all endings if i don't like it then i'll probably just do

2299
04:04:50,660 --> 04:04:55,780
a few runs and then uh have a short stream and then i'll work on a smart that sounds like a deal

2300
04:04:55,780 --> 04:05:01,460
that does not surprise me the french puttani have us under pressure tell me about their general

2301
04:05:01,460 --> 04:05:10,980
these baron de valois some major is just like the option and over and over again where can i find

2302
04:05:11,300 --> 04:05:17,220
watch the bed wait i need to censor the stream is it safe to stream it

2303
04:05:17,860 --> 04:05:24,180
they seem to be getting closer the situation is under control close the gate needy stroney

2304
04:05:24,180 --> 04:05:29,780
overload oh i should have named it last time i'm taking that thank you no you can do it okay

2305
04:05:30,740 --> 04:05:32,500
right don't take any damage

2306
04:05:36,260 --> 04:05:44,740
i'm gonna do that so that stops them okay that's what i'm nervous about them doing that and i

2307
04:05:44,740 --> 04:05:48,500
don't have a freaking smoke bomb i have i don't have any more smoke bombs

2308
04:05:48,900 --> 04:05:56,580

2309
04:05:59,380 --> 04:06:03,220

2310
04:06:04,980 --> 04:06:08,100
oh i can't see because of the camera angle

2311
04:06:11,060 --> 04:06:14,900
i'm scared i'm scared i'm going for it i'm sending it i'm sending it i'm sending it please

2312
04:06:14,900 --> 04:06:19,780

2313
04:06:19,780 --> 04:06:26,020

2314
04:06:28,420 --> 04:06:31,780
assassin please jeez do you try and make me lose

2315
04:06:33,860 --> 04:06:35,860
jeez is there anyone else

2316
04:06:36,420 --> 04:06:43,780
oh wait what on air i've never seen this before

2317
04:06:45,780 --> 04:06:52,260
i guess i'll just wait they keep seeing me though they can't so the the ai can't actually see me

2318
04:06:53,620 --> 04:06:57,940
but he keeps claiming it it's not i think i'm just gonna shoot them no

2319
04:06:58,500 --> 04:07:06,100
oh i can oh i can okay that was okay we did it we did it we did it

2320
04:07:10,020 --> 04:07:12,420
it's just heavily implied it's more of a way to do nothing okay

2321
04:07:15,300 --> 04:07:19,060
please did it too well it would mask your barbaric

2322
04:07:19,060 --> 04:07:20,180
Humpty Dumpty look at us

2323
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:22,820
blame them with your ink

2324
04:07:26,420 --> 04:07:29,780
maybe i should have had an ink toy so what would have been funny is anything like i just go

2325
04:07:33,300 --> 04:07:33,780
oh no

2326
04:07:38,660 --> 04:07:39,860
in your ear

2327
04:07:40,820 --> 04:07:44,100
i believe another lady might object to that

2328
04:07:46,100 --> 04:07:50,660
didn't the developer also make another game a whale after

2329
04:07:50,660 --> 04:07:58,660
come on down on your wife says no my downs and come out of the door

2330
04:08:02,100 --> 04:08:04,180
that's practically your stretch

2331
04:08:05,460 --> 04:08:09,140
all of Italy will be speaking it i'll get you

2332
04:08:12,740 --> 04:08:14,580
yeah i can't speak none of that

2333
04:08:14,580 --> 04:08:22,980
okay i think we just need to go back and forth and not get attacked by anything which is super

2334
04:08:22,980 --> 04:08:24,980
simple

2335
04:08:33,220 --> 04:08:34,980
maybe part of a 2.0

2336
04:08:35,860 --> 04:08:37,220
why is your french so good no

2337
04:08:48,100 --> 04:08:53,700
i actually don't know any french i'll literally no phrases and i record just hate the same phrases

2338
04:08:54,260 --> 04:08:58,100
if you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette you say

2339
04:08:59,060 --> 04:09:02,660
i would like a good ham with

2340
04:09:04,740 --> 04:09:05,860
i forgot what cheese is

2341
04:09:10,420 --> 04:09:13,380
well that didn't that didn't work out very well

2342
04:09:17,620 --> 04:09:19,700
well it sounds good coming from my friend to speak up

2343
04:09:19,860 --> 04:09:21,380
uh

2344
04:09:27,060 --> 04:09:27,860
Oh wait that was

2345
04:09:30,980 --> 04:09:32,420
must have french post word

2346
04:09:32,420 --> 04:09:36,620
I enter and don't bear in gifts and hope that

2347
04:09:36,620 --> 04:09:41,820
I can not see offensive of Rima, but did I say

2348
04:09:41,820 --> 04:09:45,020
call your man back to the max. I will explain that.

2349
04:09:45,020 --> 04:09:47,020
You better have something good.

2350
04:09:47,020 --> 04:09:49,820
Hold back!

2351
04:09:49,820 --> 04:09:52,420
Yeah, that's like, I'm literally just regurgitating.

2352
04:09:52,420 --> 04:09:56,020
Do I have higher education? That sounds like I have higher education.

2353
04:09:56,020 --> 04:09:58,020
That answers me.

2354
04:09:58,020 --> 04:10:01,020
Reason a barn, uneducated in the barn.

2355
04:10:02,020 --> 04:10:04,020
And became a gamer. Hell yeah.

2356
04:10:08,420 --> 04:10:12,020
Ray, I'm a bit scared of this one.

2357
04:10:12,020 --> 04:10:14,020
Don't lose any health squares.

2358
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:20,020
I actually don't want to do that one because it takes too long.

2359
04:10:20,020 --> 04:10:26,020
Ray, we're at 52%. So every time I do a memory, I'm getting like, up to 5%.

2360
04:10:26,020 --> 04:10:29,020
Use assassin recruits to do your targets.

2361
04:10:29,020 --> 04:10:35,020
Okay, we're actually, factually going to upgrade our assassin recruits.

2362
04:10:35,020 --> 04:10:40,020
Which, sorry, I just closed this, but we actually needed to open it.

2363
04:10:40,020 --> 04:10:44,020
If I do this, they get...

2364
04:10:44,020 --> 04:10:47,020
Okay, we just need to send them on missions.

2365
04:10:47,020 --> 04:10:55,020
If we get 5 assassins level 10, the assassin's recruit signal replenishes so much faster.

2366
04:10:55,020 --> 04:11:02,020
I think it takes off like 20 seconds, which, in the grand scheme of things, adds up so quickly.

2367
04:11:02,020 --> 04:11:04,020
How much money do I have on my assassins?

2368
04:11:06,020 --> 04:11:08,020
13k, right, I don't have enough right.

2369
04:11:08,020 --> 04:11:10,020
We'll just go and do...

2370
04:11:10,020 --> 04:11:13,020
We'll send them on missions.

2371
04:11:14,020 --> 04:11:16,020
By the P-jones.

2372
04:11:16,020 --> 04:11:18,020
Oh, it was like, dead ahead, dead center.

2373
04:11:19,020 --> 04:11:22,020
I remembered an Italian swear. I'll use anything.

2374
04:11:22,020 --> 04:11:24,020
Show us your thrones!

2375
04:11:25,020 --> 04:11:27,020
I didn't even know that.

2376
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:28,020
I know, cazzo!

2377
04:11:30,020 --> 04:11:32,020
Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank?

2378
04:11:33,020 --> 04:11:34,020
50 smacaroons.

2379
04:11:34,020 --> 04:11:37,020
Right, we're going to send away our agents.

2380
04:11:37,020 --> 04:11:41,020
Because I want some of them to level up so then we can get faster.

2381
04:11:44,020 --> 04:11:46,020
I have no one at 10 yet.

2382
04:11:46,020 --> 04:11:48,020
What, how are you guys...

2383
04:11:48,020 --> 04:11:50,020
Oh, you're getting close!

2384
04:11:50,020 --> 04:11:52,020
Right, I just need to send them away.

2385
04:11:52,020 --> 04:11:55,020
Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them.

2386
04:11:56,020 --> 04:11:58,020
And then we can get that...

2387
04:12:01,020 --> 04:12:04,020
5, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2388
04:12:04,020 --> 04:12:06,020
If you guys all go...

2389
04:12:07,020 --> 04:12:09,020
I think...

2390
04:12:09,020 --> 04:12:11,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2391
04:12:11,020 --> 04:12:13,020
Oh, I don't want to risk the room.

2392
04:12:13,020 --> 04:12:18,020
If it fails, I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished.

2393
04:12:18,020 --> 04:12:21,020
If it fails, which is like, pretty unforgiven.

2394
04:12:23,020 --> 04:12:24,020
Eh...

2395
04:12:24,020 --> 04:12:28,020
Honestly, your openness and no manners is one of the reasons why I like...

2396
04:12:30,020 --> 04:12:32,020
That's funny.

2397
04:12:32,020 --> 04:12:34,020
When I live at Cleveland.

2398
04:12:35,020 --> 04:12:36,020
Eh...

2399
04:12:36,020 --> 04:12:37,020
Right.

2400
04:12:37,020 --> 04:12:39,020
Missions, missions, missions.

2401
04:12:39,020 --> 04:12:41,020
Wait, they don't have...

2402
04:12:42,020 --> 04:12:45,020
17 minutes for that mission?

2403
04:12:45,020 --> 04:12:47,020
Is really not.

2404
04:12:47,020 --> 04:12:51,020
Is there not another level 5 regular contract?

2405
04:12:53,020 --> 04:12:54,020
There's no...

2406
04:12:54,020 --> 04:12:56,020
Oh, these are all level 5s.

2407
04:12:56,020 --> 04:12:57,020
Okay.

2408
04:12:57,020 --> 04:12:59,020
All four of you go together.

2409
04:13:00,020 --> 04:13:02,020
And you're humble, little thing.

2410
04:13:05,020 --> 04:13:07,020
Alright, as an Italian myself,

2411
04:13:07,020 --> 04:13:10,020
I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases another...

2412
04:13:10,020 --> 04:13:12,020
Languages is cringe!

2413
04:13:12,020 --> 04:13:14,020
Oh, you don't want to hear me say...

2414
04:13:14,020 --> 04:13:16,020
Spinji, spinji!

2415
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:18,020
Aiuto, aiuto!

2416
04:13:18,020 --> 04:13:20,020
Aius mius!

2417
04:13:20,020 --> 04:13:22,020
Wait, no, that's Spanish.

2418
04:13:23,020 --> 04:13:25,020
Alright, we're going to go to a bank.

2419
04:13:35,020 --> 04:13:37,020
As an Italian myself, please say more Italian words.

2420
04:13:37,020 --> 04:13:39,020
Ai, ai, ai, aius mius!

2421
04:13:41,020 --> 04:13:43,020
To say...

2422
04:13:44,020 --> 04:13:46,020
I don't think I have any Italian words.

2423
04:13:47,020 --> 04:13:50,020
I'm ready for a little nap after eating almost this little snack.

2424
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:52,020
I still have pea snacks left over.

2425
04:13:52,020 --> 04:13:54,020
I forgot to eat any of my reasons.

2426
04:13:54,020 --> 04:13:56,020
I'm going to have to put them back in the fridge.

2427
04:13:56,020 --> 04:13:58,020
I need to buy paintings.

2428
04:13:58,020 --> 04:14:00,020
Wait, do paintings?

2429
04:14:00,020 --> 04:14:02,020
Question mark, go to DNA.

2430
04:14:04,020 --> 04:14:07,020
52, 4, 7.

2431
04:14:07,020 --> 04:14:08,020
52, 4, 7.

2432
04:14:08,020 --> 04:14:09,020
52, 4, 7.

2433
04:14:09,020 --> 04:14:10,020
52, 4, 7.

2434
04:14:10,020 --> 04:14:11,020
52, 4, 7.

2435
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:12,020
52, 4, 7.

2436
04:14:12,020 --> 04:14:13,020
52, 4, 7.

2437
04:14:13,020 --> 04:14:14,020
52, 4, 7.

2438
04:14:14,020 --> 04:14:15,020
52, 4, 7.

2439
04:14:18,020 --> 04:14:20,020
I just spent all my money on that then.

2440
04:14:20,020 --> 04:14:22,020
Oh, excuse me, you're in my way.

2441
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:36,020
I just need to access the bank over here.

2442
04:14:36,020 --> 04:14:39,020
I don't mind getting a little wet, why not?

2443
04:14:44,020 --> 04:14:46,020
That's my favourite food.

2444
04:14:46,020 --> 04:14:48,020
Chatting, has to be chicken.

2445
04:14:49,020 --> 04:14:51,020
It's too tasty, I don't know, I just did something.

2446
04:14:51,020 --> 04:14:54,020
I like savoury foods over sweet foods.

2447
04:14:56,020 --> 04:14:58,020
Savory is just dab on.

2448
04:15:00,020 --> 04:15:02,020
Flags, feathers and chest.

2449
04:15:02,020 --> 04:15:06,020
Do they, do flags go to the percentage?

2450
04:15:06,020 --> 04:15:09,020
Because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't, is like so...

2451
04:15:10,020 --> 04:15:12,020
Rough, colonel standards.

2452
04:15:12,020 --> 04:15:14,020
I can't do that, just do it.

2453
04:15:17,020 --> 04:15:18,020
Don't be detected.

2454
04:15:18,020 --> 04:15:19,020
Like, I don't like to...

2455
04:15:21,020 --> 04:15:24,020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

2456
04:15:25,020 --> 04:15:27,020
How did I do that?

2457
04:15:28,020 --> 04:15:30,020
Because they're all attacking you.

2458
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:36,020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

2459
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:41,020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

2460
04:15:48,020 --> 04:15:50,020
I have my hand over my mouth thinking.

2461
04:15:50,020 --> 04:15:52,020
Oh, I don't have any smoke bombs!

2462
04:15:56,020 --> 04:15:59,020
I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.

2463
04:15:59,020 --> 04:16:01,020
Fried, oh, fried by far.

2464
04:16:01,020 --> 04:16:03,020
I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.

2465
04:16:06,020 --> 04:16:07,020
Yeah, for sure, would you?

2466
04:16:07,020 --> 04:16:09,020
Like, if you heard Nataline speak your navel image.

2467
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:13,020
Sure, it might not be some bad, but you know, the accent can pack a punch.

2468
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:26,020
The layers of Romeo, the war machine.

2469
04:16:26,020 --> 04:16:27,020
The war machine.

2470
04:16:30,020 --> 04:16:32,020
Wait, do these have a percentage?

2471
04:16:35,020 --> 04:16:37,020
No, these don't have a percentage.

2472
04:16:44,020 --> 04:16:46,020
Okay, this is why our thing is so low.

2473
04:16:49,020 --> 04:16:53,020
Okay, okay, we're gonna do Assassin's contracts, wherever the heck they are.

2474
04:16:53,020 --> 04:16:55,020
That's why the freaking percentage is so low.

2475
04:16:57,020 --> 04:17:01,020
These symbols, the pigeon groups?

2476
04:17:02,020 --> 04:17:05,020
Like, these ones, is it that?

2477
04:17:05,020 --> 04:17:07,020
Assassin's contract, right, okay, okay.

2478
04:17:08,020 --> 04:17:13,020
I was gonna say, because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low.

2479
04:17:13,020 --> 04:17:16,020
There's only a few missions that I haven't done 100% on.

2480
04:17:17,020 --> 04:17:22,020
I'm gonna be honest, and I don't think we're gonna 100% it,

2481
04:17:22,020 --> 04:17:25,020
but we definitely finished the game and I'm satisfied.

2482
04:17:26,020 --> 04:17:31,020
After the stream, we don't need to hop back on Black Ops on Brotherhood.

2483
04:17:35,020 --> 04:17:39,020
Because I'm satisfied with the playthrough.

2484
04:17:41,020 --> 04:17:44,020
Because I don't actually have much faith.

2485
04:17:44,020 --> 04:17:48,020
Okay, so I just need to kind of do all the black markers on the map, really.

2486
04:17:48,020 --> 04:17:54,020
Maybe factions also, half of it, if I get 100% favor in the factions as well.

2487
04:17:57,020 --> 04:17:59,020
KFC Yummi, honestly.

2488
04:18:02,020 --> 04:18:04,020
It's been very cozy.

2489
04:18:04,020 --> 04:18:06,020
It's more of a cozy day, I think.

2490
04:18:06,020 --> 04:18:09,020
Yesterday, I used up a lot of my energy on our replay.

2491
04:18:09,020 --> 04:18:12,020
Just being gushed in about this game and being like,

2492
04:18:12,020 --> 04:18:14,020
it's getting so cool, it's getting so awesome.

2493
04:18:15,020 --> 04:18:17,020
Today, it's definitely cozy.

2494
04:18:17,020 --> 04:18:20,020
It's definitely have a little blanky on you, make sure you're comfy vibes.

2495
04:18:21,020 --> 04:18:26,020
Yesterday, I was screaming my head off, just loving everything.

2496
04:18:26,020 --> 04:18:28,020
So energetic.

2497
04:18:28,020 --> 04:18:31,020
But I get to be like that unapologetically,

2498
04:18:31,020 --> 04:18:36,020
because nothing's worse than being excited for something,

2499
04:18:36,020 --> 04:18:40,020
and then someone's like, you're being really loud and obnoxious.

2500
04:18:40,020 --> 04:18:41,020
They're just like kills.

2501
04:18:41,020 --> 04:18:44,020
Oh, that's what I mean, I'm having such a good time.

2502
04:18:44,020 --> 04:18:47,020
You never met someone who's genuinely excited before?

2503
04:18:48,020 --> 04:18:54,020
Yes, faction challenges are also part of the peer-centered contract.

2504
04:18:54,020 --> 04:18:56,020
No, not that contract.

2505
04:18:56,020 --> 04:18:58,020
Mission.

2506
04:19:01,020 --> 04:19:04,020
Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire

2507
04:19:04,020 --> 04:19:07,020
who's expected to come and wait and structure the...

2508
04:19:07,020 --> 04:19:09,020
kill the three targets in two minutes.

2509
04:19:09,020 --> 04:19:14,020
Oh my god, these have freaking things as well.

2510
04:19:15,020 --> 04:19:17,020
Oh.

2511
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:22,020
Okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA, I think, is so unbelievably low.

2512
04:19:33,020 --> 04:19:36,020
Oh, he's just out of range and no more.

2513
04:19:38,020 --> 04:19:41,020
Wait, under three minutes.

2514
04:19:41,020 --> 04:19:43,020
Three gunmen and under...

2515
04:19:45,020 --> 04:19:47,020
They're not that far away.

2516
04:19:47,020 --> 04:19:50,020
Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice,

2517
04:19:50,020 --> 04:19:53,020
because this guy's not that far away.

2518
04:19:53,020 --> 04:19:56,020
Oh, that was super reasonable.

2519
04:20:02,020 --> 04:20:04,020
Oh, I can't reach that.

2520
04:20:09,020 --> 04:20:11,020
Eh, that quick.

2521
04:20:12,020 --> 04:20:14,020
Okay, I was like...

2522
04:20:14,020 --> 04:20:17,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow.

2523
04:20:17,020 --> 04:20:19,020
Me ankles.

2524
04:20:19,020 --> 04:20:21,020
I'm out of medicine.

2525
04:20:21,020 --> 04:20:23,020
Ugh, and smoke worms.

2526
04:20:24,020 --> 04:20:27,020
Oh, there's a doctor over here, that's perfect.

2527
04:20:35,020 --> 04:20:37,020
What was out of medicine?

2528
04:20:38,020 --> 04:20:42,020
See, the thing is, I don't look soldiers' bodies,

2529
04:20:42,020 --> 04:20:44,020
so I don't get anything from them.

2530
04:20:44,020 --> 04:20:47,020
Heal me, you should heal myself, no.

2531
04:20:50,020 --> 04:20:51,020
Sure.

2532
04:20:51,020 --> 04:20:53,020
Do the feathers count as DNA?

2533
04:20:53,020 --> 04:20:55,020
Oh, possibly.

2534
04:20:56,020 --> 04:20:58,020
You don't need ankles.

2535
04:20:58,020 --> 04:21:03,020
Right, so literally just do the pigeon coops and then it's going up.

2536
04:21:03,020 --> 04:21:05,020
Oh yeah, 53%.

2537
04:21:05,020 --> 04:21:08,020
Okay, okay, okay, okay, let him get up, let him get up.

2538
04:21:08,020 --> 04:21:10,020
53%, how do I go up there?

2539
04:21:11,020 --> 04:21:13,020
That looks like a hell to me.

2540
04:21:13,020 --> 04:21:16,020
That looks like a bit of an enslave, a bit of an incline.

2541
04:21:23,020 --> 04:21:28,020
Eh, I think tomorrow I'm going to save.

2542
04:21:28,020 --> 04:21:31,020
Which means I need to take a shower.

2543
04:21:31,020 --> 04:21:33,020
Put deodorant on.

2544
04:21:33,020 --> 04:21:37,020
I need to pretend I'm a normal person.

2545
04:21:37,020 --> 04:21:39,020
I'm teasing.

2546
04:21:39,020 --> 04:21:41,020
I do not stink all the time.

2547
04:21:41,020 --> 04:21:43,020
Wait, what was 100%?

2548
04:21:43,020 --> 04:21:45,020
Assassinate three guards with a hidden blade.

2549
04:21:45,020 --> 04:21:49,020
You do not have to tell me anything more, I assure you.

2550
04:21:49,020 --> 04:21:51,020
Hidden blade is a way to go.

2551
04:21:57,020 --> 04:22:01,020
Oh, they're on horsies.

2552
04:22:01,020 --> 04:22:03,020
I love when they're on horsies.

2553
04:22:03,020 --> 04:22:06,020
Hello, would you like to die?

2554
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:08,020
Okay, hold on, let me try the game.

2555
04:22:08,020 --> 04:22:10,020
Would you like to die?

2556
04:22:10,020 --> 04:22:12,020
One.

2557
04:22:12,020 --> 04:22:13,020
They're all on horses.

2558
04:22:13,020 --> 04:22:16,020
No wonder the game's like, they're all on horses.

2559
04:22:16,020 --> 04:22:19,020
How am I supposed to do this?

2560
04:22:19,020 --> 04:22:21,020
Hello, would you like to die?

2561
04:22:21,020 --> 04:22:22,020
Hello, would you like to die?

2562
04:22:22,020 --> 04:22:23,020
No.

2563
04:22:23,020 --> 04:22:25,020
Yes, wait, I did it.

2564
04:22:25,020 --> 04:22:26,020
100% already.

2565
04:22:26,020 --> 04:22:27,020
Skill?

2566
04:22:27,020 --> 04:22:28,020
Okay, wait, wait, hold on.

2567
04:22:28,020 --> 04:22:30,020
It's fine, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

2568
04:22:30,020 --> 04:22:31,020
Let him get up, let him get up.

2569
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:34,020
Oh, no, no, no, don't spank the horse.

2570
04:22:34,020 --> 04:22:37,020
Wait, wait, wait, get him, because he's got a bow.

2571
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:38,020
Why does it not...

2572
04:22:38,020 --> 04:22:40,020
Do I need to like jump up onto the horse?

2573
04:22:43,020 --> 04:22:46,020
Ow, you're hurting me.

2574
04:22:46,020 --> 04:22:47,020
Okay.

2575
04:22:47,020 --> 04:22:49,020
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2576
04:22:49,020 --> 04:22:50,020
Let them cook, let them cook.

2577
04:22:50,020 --> 04:22:52,020
Yes, they got off the horse by automatic.

2578
04:22:54,020 --> 04:22:56,020
Okay, easy peasy lemon smoothie.

2579
04:22:56,020 --> 04:22:57,020
You're next.

2580
04:22:57,020 --> 04:22:59,020
No, you're not.

2581
04:22:59,020 --> 04:23:00,020
Are you coming?

2582
04:23:00,020 --> 04:23:01,020
I've lost sight of him.

2583
04:23:01,020 --> 04:23:02,020
Are you coming?

2584
04:23:02,020 --> 04:23:03,020
Yes, there, get him.

2585
04:23:03,020 --> 04:23:04,020
3, 2, 1.

2586
04:23:04,020 --> 04:23:05,020
Oh, I missed it, I missed it.

2587
04:23:05,020 --> 04:23:06,020
I missed the timing source.

2588
04:23:08,020 --> 04:23:11,020
I sniffed for you too late.

2589
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:13,020
Well, the weather's nicer for you.

2590
04:23:13,020 --> 04:23:14,020
It's mild.

2591
04:23:14,020 --> 04:23:16,020
33 degrees.

2592
04:23:16,020 --> 04:23:21,020
It's too much for me.

2593
04:23:21,020 --> 04:23:22,020
I'll pass.

2594
04:23:22,020 --> 04:23:25,020
Right, I guess we're gonna do Leonardo as well.

2595
04:23:25,020 --> 04:23:29,020
Oh, right, there's another one.

2596
04:23:29,020 --> 04:23:33,020
If we do that, the assassin missions seem like super fair.

2597
04:23:33,020 --> 04:23:36,020
Some of it buys for them right now.

2598
04:23:36,020 --> 04:23:41,020
And we can generate more money by sending our wee assassins to get more XP.

2599
04:23:41,020 --> 04:23:43,020
Oh, I'm gonna need a horse for this.

2600
04:23:44,020 --> 04:23:46,020
I said I'm gonna need a...

2601
04:23:46,020 --> 04:23:47,020
Wait, I'm blind.

2602
04:23:47,020 --> 04:23:49,020
I just passed off on the horse.

2603
04:23:49,020 --> 04:23:51,020
Sorry mate, my apologies.

2604
04:23:56,020 --> 04:23:59,020
If it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them.

2605
04:23:59,020 --> 04:24:01,020
Get them out of the way and then...

2606
04:24:01,020 --> 04:24:05,020
Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like 5.

2607
04:24:05,020 --> 04:24:07,020
That's pretty good.

2608
04:24:11,020 --> 04:24:16,020
Actually, I could also use these mercenaries.

2609
04:24:16,020 --> 04:24:18,020
Well, I can't right now.

2610
04:24:20,020 --> 04:24:22,020
Hello chat, hello.

2611
04:24:22,020 --> 04:24:26,020
We're just trying to do what we can.

2612
04:24:26,020 --> 04:24:30,020
It's very unlikely we're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly.

2613
04:24:30,020 --> 04:24:34,020
I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table

2614
04:24:34,020 --> 04:24:36,020
and I'm killing circulation to my leg.

2615
04:24:36,020 --> 04:24:37,020
I'll just be a second.

2616
04:24:37,020 --> 04:24:39,020
I don't need to mute so you can...

2617
04:24:39,020 --> 04:24:42,020
What's that saying that's like, I love...

2618
04:24:42,020 --> 04:24:45,020
I hate to see you go, but I'd love to watch you leave or something like that.

2619
04:24:52,020 --> 04:24:53,020
Okay.

2620
04:25:08,020 --> 04:25:11,020
I'm returned already.

2621
04:25:12,020 --> 04:25:15,020
I'm gonna have my lovely blanket to protect my leg

2622
04:25:15,020 --> 04:25:19,020
because my circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table.

2623
04:25:19,020 --> 04:25:21,020
They ain't sitting on my feet.

2624
04:25:21,020 --> 04:25:23,020
I'm cutting the circulation out of my leg.

2625
04:25:28,020 --> 04:25:31,020
All right, my chair is like so quicky.

2626
04:25:35,020 --> 04:25:37,020
Right, have we got any level 10?

2627
04:25:37,020 --> 04:25:40,020
No, we don't. It was a smaller mission.

2628
04:25:44,020 --> 04:25:46,020
I screenshot that.

2629
04:25:49,020 --> 04:25:51,020
That's an interesting scene.

2630
04:25:52,020 --> 04:25:55,020
I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave.

2631
04:25:55,020 --> 04:26:00,020
So the thing looks right, but I don't think there's a soul here.

2632
04:26:00,020 --> 04:26:04,020
I'm just gonna keep sending people away to do more.

2633
04:26:04,020 --> 04:26:06,020
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb.

2634
04:26:06,020 --> 04:26:10,020
I was supposed to accept a assassination contract.

2635
04:26:10,020 --> 04:26:12,020
Missions.

2636
04:26:14,020 --> 04:26:15,020
Choose company.

2637
04:26:15,020 --> 04:26:17,020
Kill both targets for your hidden belief.

2638
04:26:17,020 --> 04:26:20,020
You do not have to tell me twice.

2639
04:26:20,020 --> 04:26:23,020
I'm loving these assassin missions.

2640
04:26:23,020 --> 04:26:25,020
Are you joking me?

2641
04:26:27,020 --> 04:26:30,020
I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them.

2642
04:26:32,020 --> 04:26:34,020
Where are we getting pretty far?

2643
04:26:37,020 --> 04:26:40,020
I can't tell which one's closer.

2644
04:26:42,020 --> 04:26:44,020
Eh, where is this?

2645
04:26:45,020 --> 04:26:47,020
Oh wow, they're like...

2646
04:26:49,020 --> 04:26:51,020
Let's do that.

2647
04:26:52,020 --> 04:26:55,020
By Austria and Switzerland, it's 26 right now.

2648
04:26:59,020 --> 04:27:02,020
Literally, the assassin missions are so easy.

2649
04:27:02,020 --> 04:27:07,020
We may be 57% once by the time we finish them.

2650
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:10,020
If they make them this easy, then...

2651
04:27:15,020 --> 04:27:19,020
If you die, your assassin role before promoting them at max,

2652
04:27:19,020 --> 04:27:22,020
their cape match will be that colour.

2653
04:27:22,020 --> 04:27:24,020
I have no sense of colour.

2654
04:27:26,020 --> 04:27:28,020
Wait, that...

2655
04:27:29,020 --> 04:27:31,020
Assassin contracts are so easy!

2656
04:27:31,020 --> 04:27:33,020
I love it here!

2657
04:27:33,020 --> 04:27:34,020
What the heck?

2658
04:27:34,020 --> 04:27:39,020
Don't be detected and there's 18 billion guards looking at you.

2659
04:27:39,020 --> 04:27:41,020
Shout out to assassin contracts.

2660
04:27:41,020 --> 04:27:43,020
Hello?

2661
04:27:43,020 --> 04:27:46,020
I can't believe how easy these are!

2662
04:27:49,020 --> 04:27:51,020
Excuse me, Mr. Horsey.

2663
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:53,020
Yet, in Maui.

2664
04:27:53,020 --> 04:27:55,020
6 and 8% finish.

2665
04:27:55,020 --> 04:27:57,020
Is that where we'll end on 6 and 8%?

2666
04:27:57,020 --> 04:28:00,020
I'll give the Leonardo missions a go.

2667
04:28:05,020 --> 04:28:09,020
It would be nice if 100%, but my goodness, I didn't know.

2668
04:28:10,020 --> 04:28:13,020
I'll see what happens by the end of this stream.

2669
04:28:13,020 --> 04:28:16,020
I thought I was only going to do 6 hours today.

2670
04:28:16,020 --> 04:28:17,020
Hi.

2671
04:28:17,020 --> 04:28:18,020
I'm sorry.

2672
04:28:18,020 --> 04:28:19,020
Bye.

2673
04:28:19,020 --> 04:28:21,020
It was nice meeting you.

2674
04:28:23,020 --> 04:28:25,020
What percentage are we on?

2675
04:28:25,020 --> 04:28:26,020
54?

2676
04:28:27,020 --> 04:28:28,020
55!

2677
04:28:28,020 --> 04:28:29,020
I love it here!

2678
04:28:29,020 --> 04:28:30,020
It says 55.

2679
04:28:30,020 --> 04:28:32,020
Oh my god, more contact please.

2680
04:28:32,020 --> 04:28:33,020
They're so easy.

2681
04:28:33,020 --> 04:28:35,020
Is there any more?

2682
04:28:36,020 --> 04:28:40,020
No, but there's Templar Agents.

2683
04:28:40,020 --> 04:28:42,020
Okay, we're going to do Templar Agents.

2684
04:28:42,020 --> 04:28:47,020
I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky.

2685
04:28:52,020 --> 04:28:54,020
Last Christina needs 75%.

2686
04:28:54,020 --> 04:28:56,020
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2687
04:28:56,020 --> 04:28:57,020
We're going to do that.

2688
04:28:57,020 --> 04:28:58,020
We're going to do it.

2689
04:28:58,020 --> 04:29:04,020
I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like, we'll do what we can.

2690
04:29:04,020 --> 04:29:09,020
I actually don't know how long we're going to stream today.

2691
04:29:09,020 --> 04:29:17,020
As I said, I was only planning on doing 6 hours-ish, but I mean, we're already getting close to that mark.

2692
04:29:19,020 --> 04:29:25,020
It's already been 4 hours and a half, and I'm like, I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now for stream.

2693
04:29:25,020 --> 04:29:34,020
Especially tomorrow, depending on how much I like the game, it might only be a tour stream, which is a bit meh.

2694
04:29:36,020 --> 04:29:38,020
I believe in a thing called love.

2695
04:29:38,020 --> 04:29:40,020
Just listen to the rhythm of your heart.

2696
04:29:40,020 --> 04:29:54,020
Yeah, literally, it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go-

2697
04:29:54,020 --> 04:29:56,020
Oh wait, the bank, I can collect money from it.

2698
04:30:00,020 --> 04:30:02,020
Oh no, I've already collected my money.

2699
04:30:03,020 --> 04:30:17,020
I suppose once we buy the last, how do you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall.

2700
04:30:20,020 --> 04:30:23,020
I'm trying to do the faction challenges on the way there.

2701
04:30:23,020 --> 04:30:28,020
Yeah, I need to hire thieves to lure people away.

2702
04:30:28,020 --> 04:30:31,020
You need to do it 10 times to their question.

2703
04:30:32,020 --> 04:30:35,020
I just need to find enemies.

2704
04:30:40,020 --> 04:30:41,020
Yeah, just like that.

2705
04:30:44,020 --> 04:30:46,020
We need to complete Christina!

2706
04:30:46,020 --> 04:30:47,020
Literally.

2707
04:30:48,020 --> 04:30:50,020
Right, what's this? Hi!

2708
04:30:50,020 --> 04:30:51,020
Are you a kitty?

2709
04:30:51,020 --> 04:30:53,020
Oh, it's not looking good.

2710
04:30:55,020 --> 04:30:56,020
She's beating up!

2711
04:31:01,020 --> 04:31:03,020
I will not touch you. What happened here?

2712
04:31:03,020 --> 04:31:09,020
Auguste, my beloved husband, he owns this neighborhood.

2713
04:31:09,020 --> 04:31:11,020
That Borgia have given it to him.

2714
04:31:11,020 --> 04:31:19,020
He once made signs for the shop's nudistic, but now he post lies for the Borgia and hurts those who stand in his way.

2715
04:31:19,020 --> 04:31:22,020
Like you, where is he?

2716
04:31:22,020 --> 04:31:27,020
He spends his days locked in his workshop, but I may know how to go them out.

2717
04:31:27,020 --> 04:31:29,020
What are we doing?

2718
04:31:29,020 --> 04:31:30,020
Kill your target with the hidden bl-

2719
04:31:30,020 --> 04:31:33,020
I love these missions, what the heck?

2720
04:31:35,020 --> 04:31:36,020
Aw, that's so easy.

2721
04:31:36,020 --> 04:31:38,020
Yesterday you said 8 hours and then end up being 12.

2722
04:31:38,020 --> 04:31:40,020
It would have been 14.

2723
04:31:41,020 --> 04:31:44,020
I don't know, maybe one day they'll fix the VOD issue.

2724
04:31:44,020 --> 04:31:54,020
If the day comes where they fix that VOD issue, please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule.

2725
04:31:54,020 --> 04:32:00,020
I'm talking, we wake up, we brush our teeth, we get our food, and then we stream.

2726
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:02,020
14 hours, put a vidyag in.

2727
04:32:02,020 --> 04:32:04,020
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

2728
04:32:06,020 --> 04:32:07,020
What?

2729
04:32:07,020 --> 04:32:08,020
Him!

2730
04:32:10,020 --> 04:32:12,020
Wait, it's the doctor? What am I supposed to do?

2731
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:14,020
Oh no, it's the sign!

2732
04:32:15,020 --> 04:32:16,020
Interact.

2733
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:21,020
Oh, we're pulling down propaganda, my apologies.

2734
04:32:21,020 --> 04:32:23,020
I didn't know.

2735
04:32:25,020 --> 04:32:27,020
Can you at least reserve the weekends, yeah?

2736
04:32:27,020 --> 04:32:29,020
Aw, you needing a break from my stamina?

2737
04:32:29,020 --> 04:32:31,020
You're so adorable, refling.

2738
04:32:31,020 --> 04:32:33,020
There's no breaks on this tree.

2739
04:32:34,020 --> 04:32:36,020
I was gonna say something else there, right?

2740
04:32:36,020 --> 04:32:38,020
I was really bad shouldn't have fallen out.

2741
04:32:38,020 --> 04:32:40,020
I'm not even naughty.

2742
04:32:41,020 --> 04:32:45,020
Alright, we're pulling down propaganda, it's useless posters.

2743
04:32:46,020 --> 04:32:49,020
Sleep is already ruined, what's a lot more ruined?

2744
04:32:49,020 --> 04:32:50,020
Choo choo.

2745
04:32:52,020 --> 04:32:54,020
Japanese man drained me.

2746
04:32:57,020 --> 04:32:59,020
I like them trying to do this.

2747
04:33:00,020 --> 04:33:07,020
Obviously they did the poster grabbing thing when you got no variety, but I didn't realise they reused it.

2748
04:33:07,020 --> 04:33:11,020
I quite like the concept, because obviously whenever you think of the past, you're like,

2749
04:33:11,020 --> 04:33:14,020
how did all these people even get caught for crimes?

2750
04:33:14,020 --> 04:33:16,020
It just seems so...

2751
04:33:17,020 --> 04:33:20,020
Kill your target within a move.

2752
04:33:21,020 --> 04:33:24,020
Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me?

2753
04:33:24,020 --> 04:33:27,020
Okay, that's exactly odd-up smoke bombs.

2754
04:33:30,020 --> 04:33:32,020
I'll just do that then.

2755
04:33:32,020 --> 04:33:33,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2756
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:34,020
I wasn't even...

2757
04:33:34,020 --> 04:33:36,020
Yeah, see that's what I get annoyed with.

2758
04:33:36,020 --> 04:33:39,020
If you don't enter combat before they whack you, you can't counter.

2759
04:33:39,020 --> 04:33:42,020
And I literally can't do a boom-boom, but here we go.

2760
04:33:42,020 --> 04:33:45,020
I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy if I loot him,

2761
04:33:45,020 --> 04:33:48,020
which I would actually really appreciate in case...

2762
04:33:50,020 --> 04:33:51,020
Ancient Rome graffiti was here.

2763
04:33:51,020 --> 04:33:52,020
There was a Pompey.

2764
04:33:52,020 --> 04:33:53,020
We're at...

2765
04:33:53,020 --> 04:33:54,020
Oh, yes, he does give me a smoke bomb.

2766
04:33:54,020 --> 04:33:55,020
That was lucky.

2767
04:33:56,020 --> 04:33:58,020
I'll definitely try and remember to...

2768
04:33:58,020 --> 04:33:59,020
Oh, anti-drops!

2769
04:33:59,020 --> 04:34:01,020
The other guy drops smoke bomb too?

2770
04:34:01,020 --> 04:34:02,020
I don't know.

2771
04:34:05,020 --> 04:34:08,020
So when we pull this down, I assume we get to meet the guy,

2772
04:34:08,020 --> 04:34:10,020
and then we...

2773
04:34:10,020 --> 04:34:12,020
Oh, we lure him out of his workshop

2774
04:34:12,020 --> 04:34:14,020
because we've filled all those posters down.

2775
04:34:14,020 --> 04:34:15,020
Okay.

2776
04:34:16,020 --> 04:34:18,020
We can definitely do...

2777
04:34:20,020 --> 04:34:22,020
Other fanbases be looking at refills

2778
04:34:22,020 --> 04:34:23,020
like a man dying of dehydration.

2779
04:34:23,020 --> 04:34:25,020
Watch another man drowning!

2780
04:34:25,020 --> 04:34:27,020
That is so good.

2781
04:34:27,020 --> 04:34:28,020
What?

2782
04:34:28,020 --> 04:34:29,020
I predict.

2783
04:34:30,020 --> 04:34:32,020
I'll friggin' just say I've got Santa Man now.

2784
04:34:34,020 --> 04:34:35,020
I'm actually...

2785
04:34:35,020 --> 04:34:37,020
At least he well in this house.

2786
04:34:38,020 --> 04:34:40,020
I do feel bad when people have a streamer

2787
04:34:40,020 --> 04:34:42,020
that maybe struggles to stream.

2788
04:34:43,020 --> 04:34:45,020
I know, I just find that a really good time.

2789
04:34:45,020 --> 04:34:46,020
A good time!

2790
04:34:48,020 --> 04:34:49,020
Is that a multiplayer character?

2791
04:34:49,020 --> 04:34:50,020
It kind of looks like it.

2792
04:34:50,020 --> 04:34:51,020
It might actually be.

2793
04:34:53,020 --> 04:34:54,020
If it is,

2794
04:34:54,020 --> 04:34:57,020
then that's another compliment to the game

2795
04:34:57,020 --> 04:34:59,020
would be on how they incorporated

2796
04:34:59,020 --> 04:35:03,020
multiplayer characters into the game campaign.

2797
04:35:04,020 --> 04:35:05,020
I feel like...

2798
04:35:06,020 --> 04:35:08,020
Drowning is standing in this house.

2799
04:35:09,020 --> 04:35:10,020
Wait, did I not say that?

2800
04:35:10,020 --> 04:35:12,020
Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game?

2801
04:35:12,020 --> 04:35:17,020
I don't really think so.

2802
04:35:18,020 --> 04:35:20,020
I think I was aware of it.

2803
04:35:20,020 --> 04:35:21,020
56%?!

2804
04:35:21,020 --> 04:35:22,020
Okay, hold on.

2805
04:35:22,020 --> 04:35:24,020
I'm starting to have hope.

2806
04:35:25,020 --> 04:35:27,020
I'm starting to have mild hope.

2807
04:35:27,020 --> 04:35:29,020
I don't want to get anyone's...

2808
04:35:30,020 --> 04:35:33,020
I don't want to lead to anyone on,

2809
04:35:34,020 --> 04:35:37,020
but it might be possible.

2810
04:35:37,020 --> 04:35:41,020
It might be for the 100% run.

2811
04:35:43,020 --> 04:35:46,020
Because that's going up way faster now that we're...

2812
04:35:46,020 --> 04:35:48,020
Sorry, I should be riding horse right now.

2813
04:35:50,020 --> 04:35:52,020
Because literally I was so confused

2814
04:35:52,020 --> 04:35:55,020
why the percentage was so low.

2815
04:35:55,020 --> 04:35:56,020
Okay.

2816
04:35:57,020 --> 04:35:58,020
So let's...

2817
04:35:58,020 --> 04:36:00,020
Let's see what happens.

2818
04:36:00,020 --> 04:36:04,020
Let's see, we're at 55% I believe.

2819
04:36:04,020 --> 04:36:05,020
I've gone the wrong way.

2820
04:36:05,020 --> 04:36:06,020
Oh, no, not.

2821
04:36:09,020 --> 04:36:10,020
Oh, I remember this one.

2822
04:36:10,020 --> 04:36:11,020
That's stupid.

2823
04:36:13,020 --> 04:36:15,020
You go all the way around in order to...

2824
04:36:15,020 --> 04:36:17,020
Oh, actually, I'm going to send off a sassan with roots.

2825
04:36:17,020 --> 04:36:18,020
I need to level them up

2826
04:36:18,020 --> 04:36:21,020
and we need money, money, money for tourist attractions.

2827
04:36:21,020 --> 04:36:22,020
Wee!

2828
04:36:24,020 --> 04:36:25,020
I know, I know.

2829
04:36:26,020 --> 04:36:29,020
Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the day

2830
04:36:29,020 --> 04:36:31,020
is a god time for viewers.

2831
04:36:31,020 --> 04:36:33,020
Yeah, I don't really get burned out.

2832
04:36:33,020 --> 04:36:35,020
I'm happy to talk about it, but...

2833
04:36:37,020 --> 04:36:39,020
I just don't seem to experience...

2834
04:36:39,020 --> 04:36:41,020
So don't get me wrong.

2835
04:36:41,020 --> 04:36:45,020
I absolutely can have days where I am

2836
04:36:45,020 --> 04:36:48,020
ready to go to bed,

2837
04:36:48,020 --> 04:36:50,020
but I wake up on the other side of bed

2838
04:36:50,020 --> 04:36:52,020
and I'm like,

2839
04:36:52,020 --> 04:36:53,020
yeah, let's do it.

2840
04:36:53,020 --> 04:36:54,020
What are we doing?

2841
04:36:54,020 --> 04:36:55,020
Let's go do this.

2842
04:36:55,020 --> 04:36:56,020
Let's go do that.

2843
04:36:58,020 --> 04:37:01,020
Send them off for 200 type thing.

2844
04:37:01,020 --> 04:37:03,020
But actual burnout,

2845
04:37:03,020 --> 04:37:04,020
I always wake up the next day

2846
04:37:04,020 --> 04:37:06,020
wanting to do something more...

2847
04:37:06,020 --> 04:37:07,020
Oh, there's actually a contract right here.

2848
04:37:07,020 --> 04:37:08,020
Wee!

2849
04:37:08,020 --> 04:37:09,020
Is that inside?

2850
04:37:12,020 --> 04:37:14,020
There's a killing contract inside here.

2851
04:37:14,020 --> 04:37:16,020
Oh, it's fantasy there!

2852
04:37:17,020 --> 04:37:18,020
Hello, madam.

2853
04:37:19,020 --> 04:37:20,020
Madam?

2854
04:37:20,020 --> 04:37:21,020
Let's talk.

2855
04:37:26,020 --> 04:37:28,020
Hard part will be the last 5%.

2856
04:37:28,020 --> 04:37:29,020
Yeah, I agree.

2857
04:37:43,020 --> 04:37:46,020
What's the hundred percent?

2858
04:37:47,020 --> 04:37:50,020
New assassin contracts on lot?

2859
04:37:50,020 --> 04:37:53,020
Say no more, my lady.

2860
04:37:53,020 --> 04:37:55,020
Say no more.

2861
04:37:57,020 --> 04:37:58,020
Okay.

2862
04:37:58,020 --> 04:38:00,020
Let me get up.

2863
04:38:00,020 --> 04:38:02,020
Okay, we've got more assassin contract,

2864
04:38:02,020 --> 04:38:04,020
which means the percentage will get even higher

2865
04:38:04,020 --> 04:38:06,020
very shortly once I do them.

2866
04:38:08,020 --> 04:38:10,020
Send away my assassins to level up and...

2867
04:38:12,020 --> 04:38:13,020
Oh, pardon me.

2868
04:38:13,020 --> 04:38:14,020
Excuse me, come through.

2869
04:38:14,020 --> 04:38:16,020
My ladies, would you like to distract those?

2870
04:38:19,020 --> 04:38:21,020
More ladies!

2871
04:38:21,020 --> 04:38:23,020
Would you like to come...

2872
04:38:24,020 --> 04:38:27,020
and distract some guards?

2873
04:38:28,020 --> 04:38:30,020
If there's any guards ahead.

2874
04:38:30,020 --> 04:38:31,020
Unfortunately, I'm on a horse,

2875
04:38:31,020 --> 04:38:33,020
so I'm much faster than them.

2876
04:38:33,020 --> 04:38:35,020
And the horse is stuck on the hill.

2877
04:38:35,020 --> 04:38:37,020
That's the only thing I don't like about this game.

2878
04:38:38,020 --> 04:38:39,020
Right.

2879
04:38:39,020 --> 04:38:40,020
There's no guards,

2880
04:38:40,020 --> 04:38:41,020
so we're just gonna...

2881
04:38:41,020 --> 04:38:43,020
We'll be fine, it's okay.

2882
04:38:44,020 --> 04:38:45,020
Where's this guy?

2883
04:38:45,020 --> 04:38:47,020
I'm on the wrong side.

2884
04:38:47,020 --> 04:38:48,020
Hello?

2885
04:38:48,020 --> 04:38:49,020
Oh, there you are.

2886
04:39:00,020 --> 04:39:02,020
What are these contracts doing?

2887
04:39:14,020 --> 04:39:15,020
Merda.

2888
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:17,020
He would kill us if we stayed here.

2889
04:39:17,020 --> 04:39:20,020
Listen, I will run to the next pillar to draw his fire.

2890
04:39:20,020 --> 04:39:23,020
He's swinging her huge percent in her face.

2891
04:39:23,020 --> 04:39:27,020
Kill the target using the hidden bleed within 45 seconds.

2892
04:39:28,020 --> 04:39:31,020
I don't like times, but let's try it.

2893
04:39:33,020 --> 04:39:34,020
They're so bastard.

2894
04:39:35,020 --> 04:39:37,020
45 seconds, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2895
04:39:37,020 --> 04:39:38,020
He's gonna close that.

2896
04:39:38,020 --> 04:39:40,020
Okay, I can tell.

2897
04:39:42,020 --> 04:39:43,020
Okay.

2898
04:39:44,020 --> 04:39:45,020
Okay.

2899
04:39:46,020 --> 04:39:48,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

2900
04:39:48,020 --> 04:39:50,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

2901
04:39:53,020 --> 04:39:54,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

2902
04:39:54,020 --> 04:39:55,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

2903
04:39:56,020 --> 04:39:58,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

2904
04:39:58,020 --> 04:40:01,020
45 seconds, hidden bleed, hidden bleed, hidden bleed.

2905
04:40:02,020 --> 04:40:05,020
I love hurting people with a hidden bleed.

2906
04:40:05,020 --> 04:40:07,020
Okay, we did it.

2907
04:40:10,020 --> 04:40:13,020
His name is Laquac.

2908
04:40:13,020 --> 04:40:18,500
What's your take on the best AC game regarding story-wise?

2909
04:40:18,500 --> 04:40:21,180
Exio's story-wise?

2910
04:40:21,180 --> 04:40:23,580
Like all of Exio?

2911
04:40:23,580 --> 04:40:27,880
Uh, like especially Revelations when-

2912
04:40:27,880 --> 04:40:29,580
Well, why am I under attack?

2913
04:40:29,580 --> 04:40:30,580
What's going on?

2914
04:40:30,580 --> 04:40:31,580
Come here, man.

2915
04:40:31,580 --> 04:40:34,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did you even come from?

2916
04:40:34,580 --> 04:40:40,580
I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing.

2917
04:40:40,580 --> 04:40:45,300
I saw that, so we'll grab it.

2918
04:40:45,300 --> 04:40:47,420
I didn't even know where those guys came from.

2919
04:40:47,420 --> 04:40:49,420
They're no station here, right?

2920
04:40:49,420 --> 04:40:50,420
Uh...

2921
04:40:50,420 --> 04:40:56,420
I don't know if I'm going to go longer on.

2922
04:40:56,420 --> 04:40:57,420
Hmm.

2923
04:40:57,420 --> 04:40:59,860
You know my favorite part of these?

2924
04:40:59,860 --> 04:41:02,940
Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters.

2925
04:41:02,940 --> 04:41:03,940
Yes!

2926
04:41:03,940 --> 04:41:04,940
Definitely.

2927
04:41:04,940 --> 04:41:08,380
Okay, we'll go get this assassin contract.

2928
04:41:08,380 --> 04:41:13,660
We'll kind of just spin around the map again, like how we did when we were renovating everything.

2929
04:41:13,660 --> 04:41:15,780
Spin around the map.

2930
04:41:15,780 --> 04:41:19,460
Why is he whispering in Italian to a French?

2931
04:41:19,460 --> 04:41:24,620
I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in French.

2932
04:41:24,620 --> 04:41:25,620
Dormez-vous!

2933
04:41:25,620 --> 04:41:27,620
Dormez-vous, mate!

2934
04:41:27,620 --> 04:41:28,620
So la-vous!

2935
04:41:28,620 --> 04:41:29,620
C'est n'est pas la vie?

2936
04:41:29,620 --> 04:41:30,620
No, no, it's not the life anymore.

2937
04:41:30,620 --> 04:41:41,340
My French is awful.

2938
04:41:41,340 --> 04:41:45,380
I get very confused with how these structure, like, words in French.

2939
04:41:45,380 --> 04:41:46,380
It's pretty...

2940
04:41:46,380 --> 04:41:50,620
Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial killer and probably

2941
04:41:50,620 --> 04:41:51,620
the highest killer?

2942
04:41:51,620 --> 04:41:52,620
Oh, yeah.

2943
04:41:52,620 --> 04:41:54,660
Actually, who does have the highest kill count?

2944
04:41:54,660 --> 04:41:55,660
Oh!

2945
04:41:55,660 --> 04:41:57,780
Don't answer that, actually.

2946
04:41:57,780 --> 04:41:58,780
Yeah.

2947
04:41:58,780 --> 04:41:59,780
Not necessary.

2948
04:41:59,780 --> 04:42:00,780
Thank you.

2949
04:42:00,780 --> 04:42:01,780
Okay.

2950
04:42:01,780 --> 04:42:02,780
Hmm.

2951
04:42:02,780 --> 04:42:09,780
Okay, I'm going to grab this flag right now.

2952
04:42:09,780 --> 04:42:16,780
Yeah, no, I asked the question and my brain then flashed up the answer and I was like,

2953
04:42:16,780 --> 04:42:17,780
ah, mm, mm.

2954
04:42:17,780 --> 04:42:22,780
Okay, we're not doing this.

2955
04:42:22,780 --> 04:42:25,260
Now we're just memeing along.

2956
04:42:25,260 --> 04:42:27,660
We're not really talking about each other.

2957
04:42:27,660 --> 04:42:33,620
I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow, so we're currently in the question

2958
04:42:33,620 --> 04:42:38,980
mark stage of, is this going to be a 12 hour marathon to 100% the game or not?

2959
04:42:38,980 --> 04:42:43,660
Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game.

2960
04:42:43,660 --> 04:42:45,660
Oh, we need...

2961
04:42:45,660 --> 04:42:52,660
Okay, you guys are like so close to being maxed out, it's crazy.

2962
04:42:52,660 --> 04:42:54,660
I'm not going to send you away for 20 minutes.

2963
04:42:54,660 --> 04:42:58,660
So do you like that after doing that?

2964
04:42:58,660 --> 04:43:00,660
Yes, we do.

2965
04:43:00,660 --> 04:43:03,660
The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore.

2966
04:43:03,660 --> 04:43:04,660
More.

2967
04:43:04,660 --> 04:43:06,660
Do you need like 24?

2968
04:43:06,660 --> 04:43:10,660
No, you need a bit more XP than that.

2969
04:43:10,660 --> 04:43:14,660
Got a level 82 XP for you.

2970
04:43:14,660 --> 04:43:16,660
Yeah, that looks like quick math.

2971
04:43:16,660 --> 04:43:19,660
That looks good to me.

2972
04:43:19,660 --> 04:43:22,660
My brain was still explicit in the context.

2973
04:43:22,660 --> 04:43:24,660
No, no, I don't need me.

2974
04:43:24,660 --> 04:43:26,660
Oh, I need to accept the contract.

2975
04:43:26,660 --> 04:43:32,660
Actually, oh, I'm going to send the thieves on this person over here, actually.

2976
04:43:32,660 --> 04:43:36,660
Actually, factually.

2977
04:43:36,660 --> 04:43:40,660
As long as you set them on someone, you don't actually have to stick around or anything.

2978
04:43:40,660 --> 04:43:44,660
I'm going to grab this feather while I'm at it as well, because I'm really close to it.

2979
04:43:44,660 --> 04:43:50,660
Right, as well.

2980
04:43:50,660 --> 04:43:53,660
It's also a feather on the Colosseum that you go back for.

2981
04:43:53,660 --> 04:43:56,660
That's 6 out of 10.

2982
04:43:56,660 --> 04:43:58,660
Wait, why are you guys still following me?

2983
04:43:58,660 --> 04:44:02,660
Did you not lure their guards?

2984
04:44:02,660 --> 04:44:10,660
I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough.

2985
04:44:10,660 --> 04:44:13,660
Wait, do you only lure away stationary guards?

2986
04:44:13,660 --> 04:44:15,660
Can't he be?

2987
04:44:15,660 --> 04:44:17,660
Oh, wow.

2988
04:44:17,660 --> 04:44:19,660
I did not know that.

2989
04:44:19,660 --> 04:44:21,660
I thought you could lure anyone.

2990
04:44:21,660 --> 04:44:25,660
So I have to pick stationary guards?

2991
04:44:25,660 --> 04:44:28,660
I have not bought the Colosseum.

2992
04:44:28,660 --> 04:44:30,660
I actually might have enough.

2993
04:44:30,660 --> 04:44:34,660
Right, there.

2994
04:44:34,660 --> 04:44:38,660
Right, they're luring him away.

2995
04:44:38,660 --> 04:44:42,660
I'm going to go and get this nation.

2996
04:44:42,660 --> 04:44:43,660
Oh, a maestro.

2997
04:44:43,660 --> 04:44:46,660
I saw that, I saw that.

2998
04:44:46,660 --> 04:44:53,660
I need five assassins to be maestro and then we'll do some more reblet.

2999
04:44:53,660 --> 04:44:56,660
You just have to be good at the game.

3000
04:44:56,660 --> 04:44:59,660
I say you're done.

3001
04:44:59,660 --> 04:45:00,660
Wait, is this funny?

3002
04:45:00,660 --> 04:45:03,660
I'm coming for you.

3003
04:45:03,660 --> 04:45:09,660
Constantinople.

3004
04:45:09,660 --> 04:45:11,660
Wow, you actually...

3005
04:45:11,660 --> 04:45:15,660
Right, I'll send them two together because they're not ready yet.

3006
04:45:15,660 --> 04:45:19,660
No, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract.

3007
04:45:19,660 --> 04:45:22,660
Hi, hi, hi.

3008
04:45:22,660 --> 04:45:24,660
Yes, yes, yes.

3009
04:45:24,660 --> 04:45:26,660
Right, what's the mission assignment?

3010
04:45:26,660 --> 04:45:28,660
Make a nice and easy peasy.

3011
04:45:28,660 --> 04:45:31,660
Finish the memory within two minutes.

3012
04:45:31,660 --> 04:45:33,660
Where am I supposed to go?

3013
04:45:33,660 --> 04:45:34,660
Do I need to go by horse or not?

3014
04:45:34,660 --> 04:45:43,660
Yes or no?

3015
04:45:43,660 --> 04:45:45,660
The thing is, you take...

3016
04:45:45,660 --> 04:45:51,660
If you just directly sprint...

3017
04:45:51,660 --> 04:45:53,660
Yeah, see, this is the problem.

3018
04:45:53,660 --> 04:45:58,660
All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under two minutes.

3019
04:45:58,660 --> 04:46:02,660
Gallop, please.

3020
04:46:02,660 --> 04:46:04,660
Yeah, okay.

3021
04:46:04,660 --> 04:46:06,660
Faster, faster, faster.

3022
04:46:06,660 --> 04:46:08,660
Yeah, okay, the horse was definitely the better bet.

3023
04:46:08,660 --> 04:46:11,660
You could not run that.

3024
04:46:11,660 --> 04:46:13,660
And just says do it in under two minutes.

3025
04:46:13,660 --> 04:46:15,660
So...

3026
04:46:15,660 --> 04:46:17,660
Yeah, what are you?

3027
04:46:17,660 --> 04:46:19,660
They're on horseback.

3028
04:46:19,660 --> 04:46:23,660
No, that makes fighting so annoying.

3029
04:46:23,660 --> 04:46:25,660
Oh, sorry, I've got a nitri nose.

3030
04:46:25,660 --> 04:46:27,660
So if my tracking goes away...

3031
04:46:27,660 --> 04:46:29,660
It's a running face.

3032
04:46:29,660 --> 04:46:31,660
Okay.

3033
04:46:31,660 --> 04:46:33,660
Okay, so glad I took the fricking horse.

3034
04:46:33,660 --> 04:46:37,660
Holy crap.

3035
04:46:37,660 --> 04:46:40,660
Okay, that's...

3036
04:46:40,660 --> 04:46:43,660
It's just so easy.

3037
04:46:43,660 --> 04:46:45,660
It's just so easy.

3038
04:46:45,660 --> 04:46:46,660
It's so good.

3039
04:46:46,660 --> 04:46:47,660
Like, I love these missions.

3040
04:46:47,660 --> 04:46:48,660
Holy crap.

3041
04:46:48,660 --> 04:46:51,660
I had no idea how easy they were.

3042
04:46:51,660 --> 04:46:52,660
Oh, excellent.

3043
04:46:52,660 --> 04:46:54,660
It's like that.

3044
04:46:54,660 --> 04:46:58,660
Literally a minute to spare.

3045
04:46:58,660 --> 04:47:00,660
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

3046
04:47:00,660 --> 04:47:02,660
Another one.

3047
04:47:02,660 --> 04:47:03,660
Another one.

3048
04:47:03,660 --> 04:47:07,660
Oh, do you want to come with me and we'll distract some guards?

3049
04:47:07,660 --> 04:47:12,660
I should be so close to doing the distraction on...

3050
04:47:12,660 --> 04:47:16,660
Okay.

3051
04:47:16,660 --> 04:47:19,660
There's a guard over here.

3052
04:47:19,660 --> 04:47:21,660
Actually, I need to walk around.

3053
04:47:21,660 --> 04:47:24,660
I might distract.

3054
04:47:24,660 --> 04:47:26,660
I didn't do anything.

3055
04:47:26,660 --> 04:47:27,660
May I ask that?

3056
04:47:27,660 --> 04:47:30,660
Time to perish.

3057
04:47:30,660 --> 04:47:33,660
Are you ready?

3058
04:47:33,660 --> 04:47:36,660
Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe?

3059
04:47:36,660 --> 04:47:49,660
Yeah, I literally did not know.

3060
04:47:49,660 --> 04:47:53,660
So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location,

3061
04:47:53,660 --> 04:48:00,660
you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me.

3062
04:48:00,660 --> 04:48:10,660
And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge.

3063
04:48:10,660 --> 04:48:17,660
Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the gold?

3064
04:48:17,660 --> 04:48:19,660
Parliamentary death squad?

3065
04:48:19,660 --> 04:48:22,660
Oh, jeez.

3066
04:48:22,660 --> 04:48:27,660
I'm just here to play video games.

3067
04:48:27,660 --> 04:48:36,660
I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation is completely out of my knowledge realm.

3068
04:48:36,660 --> 04:48:38,660
No, I've never played it with monsters.

3069
04:48:38,660 --> 04:48:43,660
I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development team made it.

3070
04:48:43,660 --> 04:48:48,660
A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it.

3071
04:48:48,660 --> 04:49:00,660
I didn't know, because I played on Xbox, that on vanilla Skyrim, because I was on Xbox,

3072
04:49:00,660 --> 04:49:06,660
that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time.

3073
04:49:06,660 --> 04:49:14,660
Oh, is it? Am I pooping or is that mud?

3074
04:49:15,660 --> 04:49:25,660
Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly?

3075
04:49:25,660 --> 04:49:31,660
I just tried to watch A.G's stream, E.B's stream, but I'm deaf on my left ear,

3076
04:49:31,660 --> 04:49:33,660
so it went silent for 10 seconds on my right ear.

3077
04:49:33,660 --> 04:49:35,660
But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know.

3078
04:49:35,660 --> 04:49:37,660
Oh, bless you.

3079
04:49:37,660 --> 04:49:41,660
What happened?

3080
04:49:42,660 --> 04:49:47,660
Were you born like that, or did you get tinnitus?

3081
04:49:47,660 --> 04:49:49,660
Are they still not done with that fight?

3082
04:49:49,660 --> 04:49:54,660
Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going to send him on him.

3083
04:49:54,660 --> 04:49:56,660
Oh, they're still fighting? Come on.

3084
04:49:56,660 --> 04:50:03,660
It's just one guy in armor.

3085
04:50:03,660 --> 04:50:06,660
Come on, you can do that. I believe in this.

3086
04:50:06,660 --> 04:50:12,660
Horses kicking, literally. I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor.

3087
04:50:12,660 --> 04:50:17,660
Come on, mercenaries.

3088
04:50:17,660 --> 04:50:20,660
Come on. Yeah, there you go.

3089
04:50:20,660 --> 04:50:23,660
Right, we're going to send him on this guy now.

3090
04:50:23,660 --> 04:50:25,660
Thank you, sir.

3091
04:50:32,660 --> 04:50:34,660
The Guardia?

3092
04:50:34,660 --> 04:50:40,660
Oh, they're beating that horse up.

3093
04:50:40,660 --> 04:50:43,660
I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed.

3094
04:50:43,660 --> 04:50:48,660
All their stuff is weapon-based. They're doing something impressive, a weapon.

3095
04:50:48,660 --> 04:50:52,660
We're going to say, do you guys need help?

3096
04:50:52,660 --> 04:50:55,660
Do you guys need help with him?

3097
04:50:55,660 --> 04:50:57,660
Okay, definitely. Do you need help with him?

3098
04:50:57,660 --> 04:50:58,660
Yeah, I'm done.

3099
04:50:58,660 --> 04:51:03,660
Thanks, guys. Glad I hired you.

3100
04:51:10,660 --> 04:51:12,660
Bought stone, bought things, taken so long.

3101
04:51:12,660 --> 04:51:16,660
I know.

3102
04:51:16,660 --> 04:51:21,660
I've almost done sending the mercenaries on people, at least.

3103
04:51:21,660 --> 04:51:23,660
Is this, like, five, maybe?

3104
04:51:23,660 --> 04:51:31,660
If they could just perish some a bit faster, you know, we can be there.

3105
04:51:31,660 --> 04:51:38,660
And they tell him, like, just hooded man on horse since four men to fight.

3106
04:51:38,660 --> 04:51:40,660
Ten years working around engine rooms.

3107
04:51:40,660 --> 04:51:44,660
Oh, no, that's, like, the quickest way to lose hearing.

3108
04:51:44,660 --> 04:51:46,660
It's, like, works like that.

3109
04:51:46,660 --> 04:51:48,660
Okay, moving up.

3110
04:51:48,660 --> 04:51:50,660
Fire messages disappeared.

3111
04:51:50,660 --> 04:51:52,660
Mozi, y'all feeling okay?

3112
04:51:52,660 --> 04:51:54,660
Am I going crazy?

3113
04:51:54,660 --> 04:51:55,660
Rubber room.

3114
04:51:55,660 --> 04:51:57,660
I'm rubber roomed for the rest.

3115
04:52:02,660 --> 04:52:03,660
Stop.

3116
04:52:03,660 --> 04:52:05,660
Right, we're almost there.

3117
04:52:05,660 --> 04:52:07,660
We're almost there.

3118
04:52:11,660 --> 04:52:13,660
Right, fight him.

3119
04:52:14,660 --> 04:52:19,660
Fill him off the horse or something.

3120
04:52:27,660 --> 04:52:33,660
This is going to take forever.

3121
04:52:33,660 --> 04:52:36,660
Is there, like, another mercenary group right here?

3122
04:52:36,660 --> 04:52:37,660
Yeah.

3123
04:52:37,660 --> 04:52:39,660
Okay, can I have you?

3124
04:52:39,660 --> 04:52:43,660
And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting?

3125
04:52:43,660 --> 04:52:44,660
Oh, it works!

3126
04:52:44,660 --> 04:52:47,660
Okay, there, they're completely outnumbered.

3127
04:52:49,660 --> 04:52:51,660
That must be, what, six now?

3128
04:52:51,660 --> 04:52:53,660
Only four more to go.

3129
04:52:53,660 --> 04:52:55,660
I'm born deaf in my left ear.

3130
04:52:55,660 --> 04:52:58,660
Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on my right side.

3131
04:53:00,660 --> 04:53:03,660
Okay, now, follow me.

3132
04:53:05,660 --> 04:53:07,660
So this will be seven?

3133
04:53:08,660 --> 04:53:11,660
Oh, for goodness sake, that's taking forever.

3134
04:53:14,660 --> 04:53:16,660
I'll do that, though.

3135
04:53:16,660 --> 04:53:20,660
Because when you send them, they don't have to win the fight.

3136
04:53:20,660 --> 04:53:22,660
It's just when you send them on people.

3137
04:53:22,660 --> 04:53:24,660
Actually, you know what?

3138
04:53:24,660 --> 04:53:25,660
I'm just checking.

3139
04:53:25,660 --> 04:53:26,660
I'm just checking.

3140
04:53:26,660 --> 04:53:28,660
I can't take this anymore.

3141
04:53:28,660 --> 04:53:30,660
Gale challenges.

3142
04:53:30,660 --> 04:53:32,660
Mercenary?

3143
04:53:32,660 --> 04:53:33,660
Nine?

3144
04:53:33,660 --> 04:53:34,660
Okay.

3145
04:53:35,660 --> 04:53:36,660
Ugh.

3146
04:53:47,660 --> 04:53:49,660
That must be done from a certain location.

3147
04:53:49,660 --> 04:53:50,660
Yeah, double assassination.

3148
04:53:50,660 --> 04:53:53,660
Three out of ten, I can hardly get it done.

3149
04:53:53,660 --> 04:53:55,660
Court is on, nine.

3150
04:53:55,660 --> 04:53:56,660
Oh, guard's poisoned.

3151
04:53:56,660 --> 04:53:58,660
It's fifteen, so I do need to go poison.

3152
04:53:58,660 --> 04:54:00,660
There's kind of more guards.

3153
04:54:00,660 --> 04:54:02,660
I assume if they hate each other down, it doesn't count.

3154
04:54:02,660 --> 04:54:03,660
Okay.

3155
04:54:03,660 --> 04:54:05,660
These, honor, honor, and spread.

3156
04:54:05,660 --> 04:54:07,660
Leaves of faith, I need twenty.

3157
04:54:09,660 --> 04:54:11,660
Guards are assassinating from me.

3158
04:54:12,660 --> 04:54:13,660
Okay.

3159
04:54:13,660 --> 04:54:14,660
Oh, there she is.

3160
04:54:17,660 --> 04:54:20,660
I just need to find one enemy.

3161
04:54:20,660 --> 04:54:21,660
Hello.

3162
04:54:21,660 --> 04:54:23,660
You are enemy.

3163
04:54:23,660 --> 04:54:25,660
And fight.

3164
04:54:25,660 --> 04:54:26,660
Okay.

3165
04:54:26,660 --> 04:54:27,660
Finally.

3166
04:54:27,660 --> 04:54:29,660
That took so long.

3167
04:54:29,660 --> 04:54:31,660
Hiring discount earned a little bit.

3168
04:54:34,660 --> 04:54:35,660
Hello.

3169
04:54:48,660 --> 04:54:51,660
Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard.

3170
04:54:51,660 --> 04:54:52,660
Look at that angle.

3171
04:54:52,660 --> 04:54:54,660
Is that even possible by then?

3172
04:54:54,660 --> 04:55:05,660
I was really dumb, but, like, before razors were invented, did guys just, like, shape their beard on rocks and stuff?

3173
04:55:05,660 --> 04:55:09,660
Like, I know that sounds really silly, but did they, like, fashion a rock to be sharp?

3174
04:55:09,660 --> 04:55:11,660
And then that's how you got rid of your beard?

3175
04:55:11,660 --> 04:55:15,660
Or did, like, everyone just have beards back in the old days?

3176
04:55:15,660 --> 04:55:18,660
The razors weren't a thing.

3177
04:55:18,660 --> 04:55:20,660
Maybe glass?

3178
04:55:20,660 --> 04:55:23,660
It was a hundred percent.

3179
04:55:23,660 --> 04:55:26,660
Kill by air assassination.

3180
04:55:26,660 --> 04:55:28,660
I can absolutely do that.

3181
04:55:29,660 --> 04:55:31,660
Shave with swords.

3182
04:55:31,660 --> 04:55:33,660
Not, like, before that kind of effect.

3183
04:55:33,660 --> 04:55:36,660
What the heck must we do on this stuff?

3184
04:55:38,660 --> 04:55:40,660
Oh, wow, that's such a good faraway.

3185
04:55:40,660 --> 04:55:42,660
Um, maybe or something?

3186
04:55:48,660 --> 04:55:49,660
I'm tired of thieves.

3187
04:55:49,660 --> 04:55:54,660
They may be able to keep up, if I can do a little way to guard things.

3188
04:55:54,660 --> 04:55:55,660
Yeah, yeah.

3189
04:55:55,660 --> 04:55:57,660
We're getting there, we're getting there, we're getting there.

3190
04:56:03,660 --> 04:56:05,660
Here is, oh, I'm getting stuck on a rope.

3191
04:56:05,660 --> 04:56:07,660
They shaved with knives.

3192
04:56:08,660 --> 04:56:12,660
They just got the homies to scratch their beards off by hand.

3193
04:56:12,660 --> 04:56:15,660
That sounds painful as anything.

3194
04:56:16,660 --> 04:56:18,660
Shave with obsidian.

3195
04:56:19,660 --> 04:56:21,660
The guy's still dead.

3196
04:56:22,660 --> 04:56:24,660
Okay, what am I supposed to do?

3197
04:56:24,660 --> 04:56:26,660
Oh, air assassination.

3198
04:56:26,660 --> 04:56:31,660
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the guy's probably up in this building then, since it's all red.

3199
04:56:35,660 --> 04:56:37,660
Not gonna be discovered, am I?

3200
04:56:37,660 --> 04:56:39,660
Hello, goodbye.

3201
04:56:39,660 --> 04:56:46,660
Actually, I need to start looting bodies, cause I'm getting low on supplies, cause I'm wasting them all.

3202
04:56:47,660 --> 04:56:49,660
Mid.

3203
04:56:55,660 --> 04:56:57,660
Okay, air assassination.

3204
04:56:59,660 --> 04:57:01,660
Let's give that a shot, where is he?

3205
04:57:02,660 --> 04:57:04,660
Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination.

3206
04:57:04,660 --> 04:57:06,660
Oh, I just called him a horse doing that.

3207
04:57:10,660 --> 04:57:13,660
I need to get away, that's why I called him a horse.

3208
04:57:16,660 --> 04:57:20,660
Having strongies mug on two monitors is overwhelming.

3209
04:57:20,660 --> 04:57:22,660
Wait until I make hypnosis.

3210
04:57:22,660 --> 04:57:24,660
I'm so excited to make my first one.

3211
04:57:24,660 --> 04:57:26,660
I don't know what to do.

3212
04:57:27,660 --> 04:57:32,660
I was gonna do a, like, free thing.

3213
04:57:33,660 --> 04:57:36,660
God, these missions are so good and easy.

3214
04:57:36,660 --> 04:57:38,660
I can't go over it.

3215
04:57:38,660 --> 04:57:40,660
I'm not doing the Naruto.

3216
04:57:40,660 --> 04:57:45,660
I'll keep doing the Templar Agents, cause it's starting to get less and less.

3217
04:57:45,660 --> 04:57:49,660
Copernico is a nightmare, if I remember correctly.

3218
04:57:49,660 --> 04:57:56,660
Copernico is, like, throw yourself across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise.

3219
04:57:56,660 --> 04:58:02,660
And, like, it really does not give you, like, much time at all, so I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico.

3220
04:58:03,660 --> 04:58:06,660
No, I don't need the body, but thank you.

3221
04:58:06,660 --> 04:58:08,660
Hello, horsey.

3222
04:58:08,660 --> 04:58:10,660
Are you ready?

3223
04:58:10,660 --> 04:58:12,660
Mount.

3224
04:58:12,660 --> 04:58:14,660
Mabos.

3225
04:58:14,660 --> 04:58:16,660
Mabos.

3226
04:58:16,660 --> 04:58:18,660
Well, the horse, please think of Mabos.

3227
04:58:20,660 --> 04:58:22,660
Okay, I think we're gonna pull one way around.

3228
04:58:24,660 --> 04:58:27,660
Speaking of, are you gonna collab with Secret Subject?

3229
04:58:27,660 --> 04:58:29,660
I haven't reached out yet.

3230
04:58:29,660 --> 04:58:31,660
I know Secret is, like, super busy.

3231
04:58:31,660 --> 04:58:37,660
Like, she's got, like, the new VTuber model and everything going on.

3232
04:58:37,660 --> 04:58:43,660
And, uh, I don't want to be, like, a bother, like, harassing anyone.

3233
04:58:45,660 --> 04:58:48,660
I might get the boss to reach out.

3234
04:58:48,660 --> 04:58:55,660
But at the moment, like, I've actually got quite a lot of people that are interested in collabs with me,

3235
04:58:55,660 --> 04:58:58,660
and I'm gonna try and, like, not take too much time.

3236
04:58:58,660 --> 04:59:02,660
Like, as she says, as she plays on stream for 12 hours,

3237
04:59:02,660 --> 04:59:07,660
and literally has, like, folk waiting on her right in the script, so it can be sent off.

3238
04:59:07,660 --> 04:59:09,660
Well, that was fun.

3239
04:59:10,660 --> 04:59:15,660
Um, but yeah, I don't want to leave too much of the pee.

3240
04:59:15,660 --> 04:59:17,660
Send you away.

3241
04:59:17,660 --> 04:59:19,660
Can I send?

3242
04:59:20,660 --> 04:59:23,660
I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing.

3243
04:59:25,660 --> 04:59:27,660
I think it's time.

3244
04:59:27,660 --> 04:59:35,660
The problem is that I take, like, five minutes to generate one.

3245
04:59:35,660 --> 04:59:37,660
I really don't want to go.

3246
04:59:40,660 --> 04:59:44,660
I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about,

3247
04:59:44,660 --> 04:59:47,660
but I think it's happening.

3248
04:59:47,660 --> 04:59:49,660
Oh, wait, sorry. Oh, sorry.

3249
04:59:49,660 --> 04:59:55,660
I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over something.

3250
04:59:55,660 --> 05:00:03,660
But I'm, like, 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around.

3251
05:00:03,660 --> 05:00:06,660
I have no coin on my corpse.

3252
05:00:07,660 --> 05:00:10,660
Ah, I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary.

3253
05:00:10,660 --> 05:00:12,660
Nah.

3254
05:00:14,660 --> 05:00:16,660
Oh, no, no, no.

3255
05:00:16,660 --> 05:00:20,660
I will take advantage of the smoke, because we need to kill enemies in smoke.

3256
05:00:31,660 --> 05:00:34,660
Right, they can all just fight each other.

3257
05:00:35,660 --> 05:00:37,660
Oh, I need to go into the smoke.

3258
05:00:39,660 --> 05:00:42,660
Any idea when the first hit in the stream I'll do my job?

3259
05:00:44,660 --> 05:00:46,660
It's time is my biggest problem.

3260
05:00:46,660 --> 05:00:51,660
Like, if we end up doing this 100%, I don't know if it's possible.

3261
05:00:51,660 --> 05:00:55,660
Then I probably won't do it tonight.

3262
05:00:55,660 --> 05:01:00,660
Needy streamer, I need to go out and buy American sweets for this hand cam stream

3263
05:01:00,660 --> 05:01:03,660
and clean up my desk, because it's an absolute mess.

3264
05:01:04,660 --> 05:01:06,660
And get a nice cute outfit and all that.

3265
05:01:09,660 --> 05:01:11,660
It's just time, honestly.

3266
05:01:11,660 --> 05:01:15,660
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it.

3267
05:01:15,660 --> 05:01:18,660
It's just time I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me.

3268
05:01:18,660 --> 05:01:22,660
And then I'm sending away shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers,

3269
05:01:22,660 --> 05:01:26,660
because I didn't want them being stressed out having to organize this stuff.

3270
05:01:27,660 --> 05:01:34,660
And, like, I guess it's just trying to settle in right now,

3271
05:01:34,660 --> 05:01:39,660
but I hope to have some consistent stuff that's free to access.

3272
05:01:39,660 --> 05:01:45,660
Like, I do want at least something decent free to access on the alt,

3273
05:01:45,660 --> 05:01:50,660
because I don't think it's fair, like, especially for, like, people just,

3274
05:01:50,660 --> 05:01:53,660
they just simply don't have the money, like, I completely understand,

3275
05:01:53,660 --> 05:01:57,660
like, don't ever feel bad if you're unable to, like, just straight up give money

3276
05:01:57,660 --> 05:02:00,660
to, like, streamers or anything like that, like, any of the viewers.

3277
05:02:00,660 --> 05:02:06,660
Like, I am 100% can say right now that, like, all the girls feel the exact same way as me.

3278
05:02:06,660 --> 05:02:08,660
If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad.

3279
05:02:08,660 --> 05:02:13,660
Like, literally watching, liking, commenting, flipping if you want,

3280
05:02:13,660 --> 05:02:16,660
liking a tweet, like, all of this stuff is free to do.

3281
05:02:16,660 --> 05:02:19,660
Like, that helps us beyond words.

3282
05:02:19,660 --> 05:02:26,660
So don't ever feel inclined and, like, thank you for respect

3283
05:02:26,660 --> 05:02:29,660
and that there, like, is a paywall on some of the content,

3284
05:02:29,660 --> 05:02:32,660
because, obviously, the girls need to eat and they need to thrive,

3285
05:02:32,660 --> 05:02:36,660
because if they don't, like, thrive monetary-wise,

3286
05:02:36,660 --> 05:02:39,660
then, obviously, they're not going to stick around at VLR, why would you?

3287
05:02:39,660 --> 05:02:45,660
So, like, I do appreciate everyone's, like, complete understanding around it.

3288
05:02:45,660 --> 05:02:47,660
Um...

3289
05:02:47,660 --> 05:02:48,660
Nope.

3290
05:02:48,660 --> 05:02:49,660
Right.

3291
05:02:49,660 --> 05:02:50,660
Okay, where's the source?

3292
05:02:50,660 --> 05:02:51,660
I am actually, unironically stuck.

3293
05:02:51,660 --> 05:02:53,660
Where the heck am I going?

3294
05:02:57,660 --> 05:02:58,660
Over the bridge?

3295
05:03:00,660 --> 05:03:01,660
Over the bridge?

3296
05:03:01,660 --> 05:03:03,660
Over the broken bridge?

3297
05:03:03,660 --> 05:03:05,660
The girls are doing great, don't worry.

3298
05:03:07,660 --> 05:03:09,660
No, not over the broken bridge.

3299
05:03:09,660 --> 05:03:11,660
Do not be fooled by the map.

3300
05:03:11,660 --> 05:03:12,660
It's not that old.

3301
05:03:12,660 --> 05:03:14,660
How do I get down though?

3302
05:03:16,660 --> 05:03:19,660
I always have that problem whenever I come up to this section.

3303
05:03:20,660 --> 05:03:23,660
You have to, like, all of your breath around me.

3304
05:03:24,660 --> 05:03:27,660
We're already lucky and spoiled with what you've done for us already.

3305
05:03:27,660 --> 05:03:29,660
No need to rush yet.

3306
05:03:29,660 --> 05:03:31,660
Like, I know some folk are noticing, like,

3307
05:03:31,660 --> 05:03:34,660
oh, all the girls aren't posting anymore.

3308
05:03:34,660 --> 05:03:36,660
And it was, like...

3309
05:03:36,660 --> 05:03:39,660
Yeah, the girls are live streaming now.

3310
05:03:39,660 --> 05:03:41,660
They're preparing for streams.

3311
05:03:41,660 --> 05:03:44,660
They're thinking our heads, like, like, that's stuff to do now.

3312
05:03:44,660 --> 05:03:47,660
Before, the only stuff the girls could do

3313
05:03:47,660 --> 05:03:50,660
was meme in the Discord with each other

3314
05:03:50,660 --> 05:03:55,660
and muck about on Twitter and pre-record audios, you know?

3315
05:03:55,660 --> 05:03:59,660
And now they've got so much to deal with and contend with, so...

3316
05:04:01,660 --> 05:04:02,660
What am I doing?

3317
05:04:03,660 --> 05:04:04,660
What am I doing before I mess up?

3318
05:04:04,660 --> 05:04:05,660
Kill your target?

3319
05:04:05,660 --> 05:04:07,660
Why is this game so good?

3320
05:04:07,660 --> 05:04:10,660
These game missions are so good!

3321
05:04:11,660 --> 05:04:13,660
It's actually making me angry.

3322
05:04:13,660 --> 05:04:15,660
Have nice interfaces.

3323
05:04:16,660 --> 05:04:20,660
Some... No, I do understand that some people, like, complain to complain.

3324
05:04:20,660 --> 05:04:22,660
That's okay. That's just how some people are.

3325
05:04:22,660 --> 05:04:25,660
Like, it's how they, like, get, you know, like, stressed out.

3326
05:04:25,660 --> 05:04:28,660
It's therapeutic to kind of have a mop or whatever.

3327
05:04:30,660 --> 05:04:33,660
It's a lady killer!

3328
05:04:35,660 --> 05:04:37,660
Okay, I need to chase...

3329
05:04:37,660 --> 05:04:39,660
Stop chasing me!

3330
05:04:39,660 --> 05:04:42,660
No, you like it, you little rascal.

3331
05:04:42,660 --> 05:04:44,660
You're teasing me.

3332
05:04:45,660 --> 05:04:46,660
You're a leaky.

3333
05:04:47,660 --> 05:04:49,660
I don't know what that means. They didn't put the subtitles in.

3334
05:04:52,660 --> 05:04:53,660
Stop it!

3335
05:04:54,660 --> 05:04:56,660
Oh, oh, oh! I love a good glitch.

3336
05:04:56,660 --> 05:04:57,660
I love a good glitch.

3337
05:04:57,660 --> 05:04:59,660
I love a good glitch.

3338
05:04:59,660 --> 05:05:01,660
And that helps me get the objective.

3339
05:05:01,660 --> 05:05:02,660
I love that.

3340
05:05:05,660 --> 05:05:07,660
That was gorgeous. Do that again.

3341
05:05:09,660 --> 05:05:13,660
Honestly, Renaissance outfit starting to grow in me.

3342
05:05:14,660 --> 05:05:18,660
Kind of Renaissance influence outfit, maybe.

3343
05:05:19,660 --> 05:05:22,660
Someone suggested a design...

3344
05:05:23,660 --> 05:05:25,660
Which was...

3345
05:05:25,660 --> 05:05:26,660
Ah...

3346
05:05:27,660 --> 05:05:29,660
Was it an aristocrat?

3347
05:05:30,660 --> 05:05:31,660
Vampire?

3348
05:05:32,660 --> 05:05:35,660
No, it was a smug aristocrat.

3349
05:05:35,660 --> 05:05:36,660
Mmm.

3350
05:05:37,660 --> 05:05:40,660
I'm very, like, posh, hoity-toity looking.

3351
05:05:40,660 --> 05:05:43,660
The only problem is they would have to be British,

3352
05:05:43,660 --> 05:05:45,660
because if there were any other...

3353
05:05:45,660 --> 05:05:48,660
I was about to say if there were any other gender,

3354
05:05:48,660 --> 05:05:49,660
it doesn't work.

3355
05:05:49,660 --> 05:05:50,660
If they're not British, I'm going to...

3356
05:05:50,660 --> 05:05:52,660
Oh, Christina available!

3357
05:05:52,660 --> 05:05:55,660
Wait, what's her DNA if Christina is available?

3358
05:05:55,660 --> 05:05:57,660
I'm not questioning it.

3359
05:05:57,660 --> 05:05:58,660
To Christina we go...

3360
05:05:58,660 --> 05:06:00,660
Mom-

3361
05:06:05,660 --> 05:06:07,660
Any other gender than British?

3362
05:06:07,660 --> 05:06:09,660
Let's- I was like, okay, thanks, friend.

3363
05:06:11,660 --> 05:06:12,660
Stroney?

3364
05:06:12,660 --> 05:06:14,660
Yesterday, don't follow Lady Hoon, also me.

3365
05:06:14,660 --> 05:06:16,660
No, no, no, no, I like that.

3366
05:06:16,660 --> 05:06:18,660
It's a lady assassin, though.

3367
05:06:19,660 --> 05:06:22,660
Only I am allowed to raise lady assassins.

3368
05:06:24,660 --> 05:06:25,660
Okay.

3369
05:06:25,660 --> 05:06:27,660
Something, Christina, because I have no idea

3370
05:06:27,660 --> 05:06:30,660
what the heck that your fricking story line is.

3371
05:06:31,660 --> 05:06:32,660
Alright, I need you guys,

3372
05:06:32,660 --> 05:06:33,660
because you guys...

3373
05:06:33,660 --> 05:06:35,660
I need to lure away guards with...

3374
05:06:38,660 --> 05:06:40,660
Can I technically get you guys to...

3375
05:06:40,660 --> 05:06:41,660
Well, why are you...

3376
05:06:41,660 --> 05:06:42,660
Right, I guess not.

3377
05:06:43,660 --> 05:06:45,660
There should be some guards coming up.

3378
05:06:46,660 --> 05:06:47,660
God, they can run fast.

3379
05:06:47,660 --> 05:06:49,660
They're keeping up with a horse practical.

3380
05:06:52,660 --> 05:06:54,660
Lure them away.

3381
05:06:54,660 --> 05:06:55,660
There we go.

3382
05:06:57,660 --> 05:06:59,660
Aristocrat with a Jordi axe.

3383
05:07:03,660 --> 05:07:05,660
Wait, I always get so...

3384
05:07:06,660 --> 05:07:08,660
spun about when it comes to this section of the map.

3385
05:07:08,660 --> 05:07:10,660
It's terrible.

3386
05:07:12,660 --> 05:07:14,660
I think it's on this stage.

3387
05:07:16,660 --> 05:07:18,660
Stuck their anger.

3388
05:07:19,660 --> 05:07:21,660
Watch out, watch out.

3389
05:07:22,660 --> 05:07:24,660
No, no, no.

3390
05:07:26,660 --> 05:07:28,660
No, no, I missed something there.

3391
05:07:30,660 --> 05:07:32,660
Goodness me.

3392
05:07:32,660 --> 05:07:34,660
I just can't even get this right.

3393
05:07:34,660 --> 05:07:36,660
Can't I just go on the wrong way?

3394
05:07:36,660 --> 05:07:37,660
On the wrong way?

3395
05:07:38,660 --> 05:07:39,660
You're the one that's right.

3396
05:07:39,660 --> 05:07:40,660
Oh, excuse me.

3397
05:07:40,660 --> 05:07:41,660
You're on my way.

3398
05:07:42,660 --> 05:07:43,660
I could have sworn there's a cape

3399
05:07:43,660 --> 05:07:45,660
that makes guards ignore you

3400
05:07:45,660 --> 05:07:47,660
unless you, like, straight up attack them.

3401
05:07:48,660 --> 05:07:49,660
I need to get into that.

3402
05:07:49,660 --> 05:07:51,660
I don't know what cape that is.

3403
05:07:55,660 --> 05:07:56,660
Oh, wow.

3404
05:07:56,660 --> 05:07:58,660
I think that's 5-1-2.

3405
05:08:06,660 --> 05:08:08,660
I'm just going to send them away for money

3406
05:08:08,660 --> 05:08:11,660
because I think we actually might have enough now.

3407
05:08:12,660 --> 05:08:13,660
No.

3408
05:08:13,660 --> 05:08:14,660
For...

3409
05:08:16,660 --> 05:08:17,660
For what?

3410
05:08:17,660 --> 05:08:19,660
For buying everything yet.

3411
05:08:21,660 --> 05:08:23,660
Right, Christina, my love.

3412
05:08:24,660 --> 05:08:26,660
Thank you for unlocking

3413
05:08:26,660 --> 05:08:28,660
because we were genuinely also confused

3414
05:08:28,660 --> 05:08:31,660
on what a bizarre ending your storyline had

3415
05:08:31,660 --> 05:08:33,660
because that didn't make any sense.

3416
05:08:34,660 --> 05:08:36,660
And you know it didn't.

3417
05:08:36,660 --> 05:08:38,660
So what on earth are we doing?

3418
05:08:41,660 --> 05:08:42,660
Oh, no.

3419
05:08:42,660 --> 05:08:43,660
Oh, no.

3420
05:08:46,660 --> 05:08:47,660
Oh, no.

3421
05:08:47,660 --> 05:08:49,660
I think we're going to the fair.

3422
05:08:52,660 --> 05:08:54,660
Do you get an AC monster?

3423
05:08:55,660 --> 05:08:57,660
Maybe put, like, an assassin's screen.

3424
05:08:57,660 --> 05:08:58,660
Hold on me.

3425
05:09:02,660 --> 05:09:03,660
So there'll be an assassin's screen.

3426
05:09:03,660 --> 05:09:05,660
Oh, I've never thought about that.

3427
05:09:05,660 --> 05:09:07,660
Maybe I should get AC's outfit

3428
05:09:07,660 --> 05:09:09,660
and, like, but, like, you know,

3429
05:09:09,660 --> 05:09:12,660
get the, like, red, lazy underwear and stuff.

3430
05:09:17,660 --> 05:09:18,660
Leonardo!

3431
05:09:39,660 --> 05:09:40,660
Aww.

3432
05:09:47,660 --> 05:09:48,660
Aww.

3433
05:09:48,660 --> 05:09:50,660
He's not over her.

3434
05:09:50,660 --> 05:09:51,660
He's heartbroken.

3435
05:09:54,660 --> 05:09:55,660
That's so sad.

3436
05:09:58,660 --> 05:10:00,660
I can't remember what we have to do here, though.

3437
05:10:02,660 --> 05:10:03,660
Oh, there she is!

3438
05:10:04,660 --> 05:10:05,660
I'm to tail her.

3439
05:10:10,660 --> 05:10:12,660
There she is.

3440
05:10:12,660 --> 05:10:14,660
With her other hussies.

3441
05:10:15,660 --> 05:10:17,660
Oh, Christina.

3442
05:10:23,660 --> 05:10:25,660
I'm just so interested in these masks.

3443
05:10:27,660 --> 05:10:29,660
She just got a circle.

3444
05:10:29,660 --> 05:10:30,660
Wait, what was it?

3445
05:10:30,660 --> 05:10:32,660
Am I supposed to do something?

3446
05:10:33,660 --> 05:10:35,660
Oh, plan a letter on her.

3447
05:10:35,660 --> 05:10:37,660
I beg your pardon.

3448
05:10:37,660 --> 05:10:39,660
I was like, why did she just go in a circle?

3449
05:10:45,660 --> 05:10:46,660
Okay.

3450
05:10:46,660 --> 05:10:48,660
That makes much more sense.

3451
05:10:48,660 --> 05:10:50,660
Way more sense.

3452
05:10:53,660 --> 05:10:55,660
Okay, the rendezvous?

3453
05:10:56,660 --> 05:10:58,660
Don't mind me.

3454
05:11:02,660 --> 05:11:04,660
Wait, she reciprocates.

3455
05:11:08,660 --> 05:11:09,660
Um...

3456
05:11:16,660 --> 05:11:17,660
Um...

3457
05:11:18,660 --> 05:11:20,660
It's you, that's wrong.

3458
05:11:20,660 --> 05:11:21,660
This is...

3459
05:11:21,660 --> 05:11:22,660
It's you.

3460
05:11:38,660 --> 05:11:40,660
I haven't seen you in eight years.

3461
05:11:40,660 --> 05:11:42,660
It's been eight years?

3462
05:11:42,660 --> 05:11:44,660
You're right.

3463
05:11:44,660 --> 05:11:46,660
I wouldn't have.

3464
05:11:46,660 --> 05:11:47,660
It's you.

3465
05:11:47,660 --> 05:11:48,660
The last time I saw you,

3466
05:11:48,660 --> 05:11:50,660
you kissed me in an alley

3467
05:11:50,660 --> 05:11:52,660
and then left me behind to be married.

3468
05:11:52,660 --> 05:11:54,660
It was the right thing to do.

3469
05:11:54,660 --> 05:11:55,660
We loved you.

3470
05:11:55,660 --> 05:11:57,660
Who cares what he wanted?

3471
05:11:57,660 --> 05:11:58,660
I love you!

3472
05:12:01,660 --> 05:12:03,660
You have your second child.

3473
05:12:04,660 --> 05:12:05,660
Please, Edson.

3474
05:12:06,660 --> 05:12:07,660
It got worse!

3475
05:12:07,660 --> 05:12:09,660
Why did we do this?

3476
05:12:09,660 --> 05:12:11,660
Why did we play that memory?

3477
05:12:11,660 --> 05:12:12,660
It got worse!

3478
05:12:12,660 --> 05:12:14,660
Is that where it ends?

3479
05:12:14,660 --> 05:12:16,660
That was even worse.

3480
05:12:16,660 --> 05:12:18,660
Why did we go away?

3481
05:12:18,660 --> 05:12:20,660
Why did we go further?

3482
05:12:20,660 --> 05:12:22,660
There has to be another one.

3483
05:12:22,660 --> 05:12:23,660
There's no way.

3484
05:12:24,660 --> 05:12:26,660
It got so much worse.

3485
05:12:29,660 --> 05:12:32,660
That was terrible.

3486
05:12:36,660 --> 05:12:37,660
Aw.

3487
05:12:42,660 --> 05:12:44,660
Shot through the heart, true.

3488
05:12:45,660 --> 05:12:46,660
That got even.

3489
05:12:46,660 --> 05:12:47,660
I don't know why...

3490
05:12:47,660 --> 05:12:50,660
I don't know why I thought that memory would...

3491
05:12:50,660 --> 05:12:53,660
Oh, that's going to be so much better than the last one.

3492
05:12:53,660 --> 05:12:54,660
No.

3493
05:12:56,660 --> 05:12:58,660
No, no, no, no, no.

3494
05:12:58,660 --> 05:13:00,660
That's terrible.

3495
05:13:02,660 --> 05:13:05,660
Well, she said don't find her again.

3496
05:13:05,660 --> 05:13:07,660
But I'm left unsatisfied.

3497
05:13:07,660 --> 05:13:09,660
I feel like that's such a short memory

3498
05:13:09,660 --> 05:13:11,660
that's not like the true ending.

3499
05:13:13,660 --> 05:13:15,660
Right, we're going to upgrade our assassins

3500
05:13:15,660 --> 05:13:17,660
just because...

3501
05:13:19,660 --> 05:13:22,660
we have the thing.

3502
05:13:23,660 --> 05:13:26,660
I'm a ballard about the seas, honestly.

3503
05:13:27,660 --> 05:13:29,660
I have quite a lot of money, though.

3504
05:13:33,660 --> 05:13:35,660
Good on Christina for not being a cheater.

3505
05:13:35,660 --> 05:13:37,660
Literally, like, when...

3506
05:13:37,660 --> 05:13:40,660
Oh, when she was like, oh, husband's name.

3507
05:13:40,660 --> 05:13:43,660
I was like, wait, Ezio planted the lair and...

3508
05:13:46,660 --> 05:13:48,660
What a mess, Ezio.

3509
05:13:48,660 --> 05:13:51,660
What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle.

3510
05:13:52,660 --> 05:13:55,660
Yeah, he sucks when it comes to romance.

3511
05:13:55,660 --> 05:13:57,660
Everything is permitted.

3512
05:14:01,660 --> 05:14:03,660
Goodness, gravy.

3513
05:14:08,660 --> 05:14:10,660
Mm-hmm.

3514
05:14:12,660 --> 05:14:13,660
Whoa.

3515
05:14:16,660 --> 05:14:18,660
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

3516
05:14:20,660 --> 05:14:21,660
Yes.

3517
05:14:24,660 --> 05:14:26,660
Did I get the thing?

3518
05:14:32,660 --> 05:14:33,660
Mm-hmm.

3519
05:14:34,660 --> 05:14:36,660
Suspend points.

3520
05:14:38,660 --> 05:14:40,660
Assassin's Guild challenge is complete.

3521
05:14:40,660 --> 05:14:41,660
Okay.

3522
05:14:43,660 --> 05:14:44,660
Uh, is that...

3523
05:14:44,660 --> 05:14:46,660
Oh, Guildcrest.

3524
05:14:46,660 --> 05:14:48,660
Stop, is there something new around here?

3525
05:14:51,660 --> 05:14:53,660
This?

3526
05:14:53,660 --> 05:14:56,660
We get little things.

3527
05:14:56,660 --> 05:14:58,660
We get trinkets.

3528
05:14:58,660 --> 05:14:59,660
Oh, my God, this game, I'm sorry.

3529
05:14:59,660 --> 05:15:00,660
This game was made for girls.

3530
05:15:00,660 --> 05:15:01,660
You're telling me.

3531
05:15:01,660 --> 05:15:03,660
I get a little sim.

3532
05:15:03,660 --> 05:15:05,660
And I get to put it in my little house,

3533
05:15:05,660 --> 05:15:06,660
my little assassin house.

3534
05:15:06,660 --> 05:15:07,660
Okay, sorry.

3535
05:15:07,660 --> 05:15:08,660
I love this game so much.

3536
05:15:10,660 --> 05:15:11,660
How did it know?

3537
05:15:11,660 --> 05:15:13,660
How did it know I was a girl?

3538
05:15:14,660 --> 05:15:15,660
Good night.

3539
05:15:15,660 --> 05:15:16,660
Rest well.

3540
05:15:16,660 --> 05:15:17,660
See you in the morning.

3541
05:15:18,660 --> 05:15:19,660
Mm-hmm.

3542
05:15:19,660 --> 05:15:20,660
Oh, this game.

3543
05:15:20,660 --> 05:15:23,660
Gender norms go hands, my goodness.

3544
05:15:24,660 --> 05:15:25,660
Ah, right.

3545
05:15:25,660 --> 05:15:27,660
I don't really want to start Copernicus.

3546
05:15:27,660 --> 05:15:29,660
We'll go by the Pantheon.

3547
05:15:31,660 --> 05:15:33,660
Augusto, my Pantheon.

3548
05:15:34,660 --> 05:15:36,660
We'll go by this because we literally do have a...

3549
05:15:36,660 --> 05:15:39,660
I'll check the bank in case any interest is made.

3550
05:15:40,660 --> 05:15:43,660
Accessories, Claire, I can't believe it.

3551
05:15:44,660 --> 05:15:48,660
I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins' freakin' hideout

3552
05:15:48,660 --> 05:15:51,660
with my Guildcrests for all my hard work.

3553
05:15:51,660 --> 05:15:52,660
Ah.

3554
05:15:54,660 --> 05:15:55,660
We know the target audience.

3555
05:15:55,660 --> 05:15:56,660
Honestly?

3556
05:15:56,660 --> 05:15:59,660
Is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls' game?

3557
05:15:59,660 --> 05:16:03,660
The only reason I say that is because it's, like, such a good game.

3558
05:16:04,660 --> 05:16:05,660
Like, it doesn't...

3559
05:16:06,660 --> 05:16:10,660
It's, like, so hard to get, like, genuinely to get stuck in, like,

3560
05:16:10,660 --> 05:16:12,660
at any part is next to impossible.

3561
05:16:15,660 --> 05:16:16,660
Mm.

3562
05:16:16,660 --> 05:16:18,660
Oh, I need poison guards, actually.

3563
05:16:20,660 --> 05:16:22,660
I'm just gonna, like, muck about.

3564
05:16:22,660 --> 05:16:25,660
I don't want to poison, like, anyone in front.

3565
05:16:25,660 --> 05:16:27,660
But I think they need to, like, pass away from poison,

3566
05:16:27,660 --> 05:16:30,660
or it doesn't count, because I'm pretty sure I've poisoned quite a lot now.

3567
05:16:31,660 --> 05:16:32,660
Um...

3568
05:16:33,660 --> 05:16:35,660
Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier.

3569
05:16:38,660 --> 05:16:41,660
Why is this one so goofy looking, honestly?

3570
05:16:45,660 --> 05:16:47,660
Wait, are you saying if it's easy to...

3571
05:16:47,660 --> 05:16:48,660
I mean...

3572
05:16:49,660 --> 05:16:50,660
I don't know.

3573
05:16:50,660 --> 05:16:53,660
I feel like whenever I see, like, a guy review a game,

3574
05:16:53,660 --> 05:16:54,660
it's always, like,

3575
05:16:54,660 --> 05:16:56,660
I love the challenge of this game.

3576
05:16:56,660 --> 05:16:59,660
I love having to repeat the same thing, like,

3577
05:16:59,660 --> 05:17:02,660
12 times over until I got, like, unspanked.

3578
05:17:03,660 --> 05:17:05,660
And, like, I figured it out.

3579
05:17:06,660 --> 05:17:08,660
And I'm, like, I just want a chill experience,

3580
05:17:08,660 --> 05:17:10,660
like, make it through the story mode,

3581
05:17:10,660 --> 05:17:12,660
and have a good time.

3582
05:17:13,660 --> 05:17:14,660
And, like, yeah.

3583
05:17:15,660 --> 05:17:18,660
I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games.

3584
05:17:21,660 --> 05:17:23,660
Not if you're a game journal.

3585
05:17:23,660 --> 05:17:26,660
I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boy's angry.

3586
05:17:26,660 --> 05:17:27,660
Yeah.

3587
05:17:29,660 --> 05:17:31,660
My little cousin played it after watching me play it.

3588
05:17:31,660 --> 05:17:32,660
So who is?

3589
05:17:35,660 --> 05:17:36,660
Someone's gonna get beat.

3590
05:17:38,660 --> 05:17:40,660
Then you gotta love Dark Souls.

3591
05:17:40,660 --> 05:17:41,660
I mean, it's basically what you...

3592
05:17:41,660 --> 05:17:44,660
No, Dark Souls is the opposite of what I described,

3593
05:17:44,660 --> 05:17:46,660
and I know for a fact why it is.

3594
05:17:47,660 --> 05:17:52,660
Because I have had the pleasure of playing Elden Ring with the Wreethlings,

3595
05:17:52,660 --> 05:17:54,660
and the truth...

3596
05:17:54,660 --> 05:17:56,660
You want the truth? I don't think you can handle the truth.

3597
05:17:56,660 --> 05:18:00,660
I would not have been able to complete that game on my own,

3598
05:18:00,660 --> 05:18:04,660
like, I just don't see how I could have done it

3599
05:18:04,660 --> 05:18:06,660
without all the help of the Wreethlings.

3600
05:18:07,660 --> 05:18:08,660
That's the truth.

3601
05:18:08,660 --> 05:18:10,660
You think you can handle the truth?

3602
05:18:11,660 --> 05:18:14,660
I need Poison Guards alone.

3603
05:18:15,660 --> 05:18:18,660
I'll just poison them when I attain.

3604
05:18:19,660 --> 05:18:21,660
I think I need to wait until they expire as well,

3605
05:18:21,660 --> 05:18:23,660
which is the biggest problem.

3606
05:18:24,660 --> 05:18:26,660
You just like your hand being held, didn't you?

3607
05:18:26,660 --> 05:18:27,660
What?

3608
05:18:27,660 --> 05:18:31,660
What do you mean that all these people are being so nice to me

3609
05:18:31,660 --> 05:18:34,660
and helping me through my game and I get to reward them?

3610
05:18:35,660 --> 05:18:36,660
Maybe I should do that.

3611
05:18:36,660 --> 05:18:40,660
Like, every time we do a game where you guys hold my hands,

3612
05:18:40,660 --> 05:18:42,660
like, I do a reward audio for it.

3613
05:18:42,660 --> 05:18:47,660
And then, like, when I'm doing the ending part of the reward,

3614
05:18:47,660 --> 05:18:50,660
I'm like, thank you for helping me, thank you for helping me,

3615
05:18:50,660 --> 05:18:51,660
thank you for helping me!

3616
05:18:51,660 --> 05:18:53,660
And then, then I pop.

3617
05:18:55,660 --> 05:18:56,660
You know?

3618
05:18:56,660 --> 05:18:57,660
That's terrible, I know.

3619
05:19:01,660 --> 05:19:03,660
Can you poison on horseback?

3620
05:19:04,660 --> 05:19:07,660
Can you poison on horseback?

3621
05:19:11,660 --> 05:19:12,660
It says shoot.

3622
05:19:13,660 --> 05:19:15,660
No, you can't poison on horseback.

3623
05:19:24,660 --> 05:19:26,660
A spank in that horse, jeez.

3624
05:19:27,660 --> 05:19:29,660
I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire.

3625
05:19:34,660 --> 05:19:36,660
I wouldn't be able to...

3626
05:19:36,660 --> 05:19:37,660
Wait, we played what?

3627
05:19:38,660 --> 05:19:39,660
Elden Ring.

3628
05:19:39,660 --> 05:19:42,660
Elden Rings are really good game to carry.

3629
05:20:04,660 --> 05:20:05,660
Hmm.

3630
05:20:07,660 --> 05:20:10,660
They're all looking in opposite directions.

3631
05:20:11,660 --> 05:20:13,660
So I can maybe do two.

3632
05:20:15,660 --> 05:20:18,660
I can maybe do three if I get this guy.

3633
05:20:18,660 --> 05:20:20,660
Oh, no, I can't, they're both...

3634
05:20:24,660 --> 05:20:25,660
That'd be amazing.

3635
05:20:26,660 --> 05:20:28,660
Games should have some challenge, though.

3636
05:20:28,660 --> 05:20:29,660
Yeah!

3637
05:20:29,660 --> 05:20:30,660
No, I do agree.

3638
05:20:30,660 --> 05:20:32,660
There definitely should be, like, some consequence.

3639
05:20:32,660 --> 05:20:35,660
Or else, if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything,

3640
05:20:35,660 --> 05:20:36,660
then you don't enjoy the game.

3641
05:20:36,660 --> 05:20:39,660
Like, it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic

3642
05:20:39,660 --> 05:20:41,660
that you wanted.

3643
05:20:41,660 --> 05:20:42,660
Like...

3644
05:20:42,660 --> 05:20:44,660
Oh, I'm in trouble, I'm sorry.

3645
05:20:45,660 --> 05:20:46,660
I am a naughty assassin.

3646
05:20:46,660 --> 05:20:48,660
I didn't hide well enough.

3647
05:20:48,660 --> 05:20:49,660
Unless...

3648
05:20:49,660 --> 05:20:51,660
Dun, dun, dun!

3649
05:20:51,660 --> 05:20:53,660
Oh, don't push me.

3650
05:20:53,660 --> 05:20:54,660
Get poisoned.

3651
05:20:56,660 --> 05:20:57,660
Plop, plop, plop.

3652
05:20:57,660 --> 05:20:59,660
Get poisoned, get poisoned, bloop, poison.

3653
05:21:00,660 --> 05:21:02,660
Everyone's getting poisoned around you.

3654
05:21:04,660 --> 05:21:06,660
Oh, please spin that pole around.

3655
05:21:06,660 --> 05:21:07,660
There we go.

3656
05:21:07,660 --> 05:21:09,660
Okay, I managed to replenish.

3657
05:21:09,660 --> 05:21:11,660
Oh, like, a ton of poisons, which is good.

3658
05:21:12,660 --> 05:21:13,660
Oh, hello.

3659
05:21:14,660 --> 05:21:17,660
You're going in the well for thieving from me.

3660
05:21:17,660 --> 05:21:18,660
Goodbye.

3661
05:21:21,660 --> 05:21:22,660
Um...

3662
05:21:23,660 --> 05:21:25,660
You can come out now.

3663
05:21:25,660 --> 05:21:26,660
It's okay.

3664
05:21:26,660 --> 05:21:28,660
I'll come get you.

3665
05:21:29,660 --> 05:21:30,660
I did not mean to do that.

3666
05:21:30,660 --> 05:21:32,660
I don't think his life should have been forfeit,

3667
05:21:32,660 --> 05:21:33,660
but...

3668
05:21:33,660 --> 05:21:36,660
I mean, was it kinda deserved?

3669
05:21:36,660 --> 05:21:37,660
I don't know.

3670
05:21:39,660 --> 05:21:41,660
That was a bit morbid, so I'm going to be honest.

3671
05:21:41,660 --> 05:21:43,660
I actually didn't expect that.

3672
05:21:44,660 --> 05:21:46,660
Please, mommy, don't poison my iron brew.

3673
05:21:46,660 --> 05:21:49,660
I have a can of iron brew in the fridge.

3674
05:21:50,660 --> 05:21:52,660
Look at this!

3675
05:21:52,660 --> 05:21:54,660
But it ages ago, and I'm still not sipped up.

3676
05:21:55,660 --> 05:21:57,660
I need, like, the perfect meal.

3677
05:21:57,660 --> 05:22:00,660
I miss British fish and chips so much.

3678
05:22:00,660 --> 05:22:04,660
I'm sorry to any Aussies listening.

3679
05:22:04,660 --> 05:22:07,660
Your fish and chips are rank.

3680
05:22:14,660 --> 05:22:16,660
Okay, I did the court exam.

3681
05:22:16,660 --> 05:22:17,660
Can I poison?

3682
05:22:17,660 --> 05:22:27,660
Can I poison all you guys, and then push you all away

3683
05:22:27,660 --> 05:22:29,660
so you don't do that fighting thing?

3684
05:22:29,660 --> 05:22:31,660
I hate when they do the fighting thing.

3685
05:22:31,660 --> 05:22:34,660
I think if they, like, hit each other with the swords,

3686
05:22:34,660 --> 05:22:37,660
it doesn't count as poison, so I'm going to try and separate them.

3687
05:22:37,660 --> 05:22:39,660
Oh, he just did it there.

3688
05:22:39,660 --> 05:22:41,660
Mmm...

3689
05:22:44,660 --> 05:22:45,660
No, I tried.

3690
05:22:45,660 --> 05:22:47,660
I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly

3691
05:22:47,660 --> 05:22:49,660
before the poison's out somehow.

3692
05:22:50,660 --> 05:22:52,660
Hey, I'm not going to find it with fish and chips around here.

3693
05:22:52,660 --> 05:22:55,660
Yeah, Aussies use shark.

3694
05:22:55,660 --> 05:22:57,660
Like, I think it's called gummy shark.

3695
05:22:57,660 --> 05:22:59,660
It's not actual shark.

3696
05:22:59,660 --> 05:23:00,660
Meat.

3697
05:23:00,660 --> 05:23:02,660
It's just a fish.

3698
05:23:05,660 --> 05:23:08,660
How do you call Germans Scottish?

3699
05:23:08,660 --> 05:23:09,660
Oh, there we go.

3700
05:23:09,660 --> 05:23:11,660
We did the poison guard.

3701
05:23:11,660 --> 05:23:13,660
Rank five.

3702
05:23:13,660 --> 05:23:15,660
Court is on...

3703
05:23:16,660 --> 05:23:19,660
Did I say court is on poison people now?

3704
05:23:20,660 --> 05:23:22,660
Ladies.

3705
05:23:22,660 --> 05:23:24,660
I didn't know that.

3706
05:23:25,660 --> 05:23:27,660
Am I in Australia forever?

3707
05:23:27,660 --> 05:23:29,660
I highly doubt it.

3708
05:23:29,660 --> 05:23:32,660
It's very good to run a business from Australia

3709
05:23:32,660 --> 05:23:34,660
compared to the United Kingdom,

3710
05:23:34,660 --> 05:23:35,660
but...

3711
05:23:35,660 --> 05:23:36,660
Oh.

3712
05:23:36,660 --> 05:23:38,660
Well, you're saying get down to me,

3713
05:23:38,660 --> 05:23:40,660
but not to this wife over here.

3714
05:23:41,660 --> 05:23:43,660
What's he going to say?

3715
05:23:43,660 --> 05:23:44,660
No.

3716
05:23:44,660 --> 05:23:46,660
Are you joking me?

3717
05:23:48,660 --> 05:23:50,660
Yeah, it's good to run a business in Australia,

3718
05:23:50,660 --> 05:23:53,660
but I can't see myself being here forever.

3719
05:23:57,660 --> 05:23:58,660
Lance.

3720
05:24:00,660 --> 05:24:01,660
Ooh!

3721
05:24:01,660 --> 05:24:03,660
The British use haddock.

3722
05:24:03,660 --> 05:24:05,660
It's a delicious fish.

3723
05:24:05,660 --> 05:24:07,660
Are you in Australia?

3724
05:24:07,660 --> 05:24:09,660
Yeah, I am.

3725
05:24:09,660 --> 05:24:11,660
I'm doing a...

3726
05:24:11,660 --> 05:24:13,660
I'm making a corn.

3727
05:24:14,660 --> 05:24:16,660
I'm going to do a V-Tuber meet and greet

3728
05:24:16,660 --> 05:24:18,660
in Australia.

3729
05:24:20,660 --> 05:24:22,660
I did not look at what the 100% thing was.

3730
05:24:22,660 --> 05:24:23,660
Oopsie.

3731
05:24:23,660 --> 05:24:25,660
What's 100%?

3732
05:24:25,660 --> 05:24:27,660
Kill your target with a hidden blade.

3733
05:24:27,660 --> 05:24:31,660
Why is this mission tape so...

3734
05:24:31,660 --> 05:24:33,660
so perfect?

3735
05:24:37,660 --> 05:24:38,660
Hmm.

3736
05:24:38,660 --> 05:24:39,660
Hmm.

3737
05:24:39,660 --> 05:24:40,660
Hmm.

3738
05:24:40,660 --> 05:24:41,660
Hmm.

3739
05:24:41,660 --> 05:24:42,660
Hmm.

3740
05:24:42,660 --> 05:24:43,660
Hmm.

3741
05:24:43,660 --> 05:24:44,660
Hmm.

3742
05:24:44,660 --> 05:24:45,660
Hmm.

3743
05:24:45,660 --> 05:24:46,660
Hmm.

3744
05:24:46,660 --> 05:24:47,660
Hmm.

3745
05:24:47,660 --> 05:24:48,660
Hmm.

3746
05:24:48,660 --> 05:24:49,660
Hmm.

3747
05:24:49,660 --> 05:24:50,660
Hmm.

3748
05:24:50,660 --> 05:24:51,660
Hmm.

3749
05:24:51,660 --> 05:24:52,660
Hmm.

3750
05:24:52,660 --> 05:24:53,660
Hmm.

3751
05:24:53,660 --> 05:24:54,660
Hmm.

3752
05:24:54,660 --> 05:24:56,660
So, Ironberg was well with fish and chips then.

3753
05:24:56,660 --> 05:24:58,660
Ah, kind of.

3754
05:24:58,660 --> 05:25:01,660
I don't know what the best takeaway...

3755
05:25:01,660 --> 05:25:03,660
maybe unironically a Chinese,

3756
05:25:03,660 --> 05:25:05,660
but like a British Chinese.

3757
05:25:05,660 --> 05:25:08,660
Oh, I think I need to chase this guy

3758
05:25:08,660 --> 05:25:09,660
from the rooftops.

3759
05:25:09,660 --> 05:25:11,660
I think, yeah.

3760
05:25:11,660 --> 05:25:13,660
It's giving chase from the rooftops.

3761
05:25:13,660 --> 05:25:14,660
Hmm.

3762
05:25:16,660 --> 05:25:17,660
Merda!

3763
05:25:17,660 --> 05:25:19,660
What do you mean, merda?

3764
05:25:19,660 --> 05:25:20,660
Get bonked.

3765
05:25:20,660 --> 05:25:21,660
Hmm.

3766
05:25:21,660 --> 05:25:22,660
Hmm.

3767
05:25:22,660 --> 05:25:23,660
Hidden blade.

3768
05:25:23,660 --> 05:25:24,660
Hidden blade.

3769
05:25:24,660 --> 05:25:25,660
Lock on to him at least,

3770
05:25:25,660 --> 05:25:26,660
Exio.

3771
05:25:26,660 --> 05:25:27,660
Don't be afraid.

3772
05:25:27,660 --> 05:25:28,660
Exio.

3773
05:25:28,660 --> 05:25:29,660
Water!

3774
05:25:29,660 --> 05:25:30,660
Exio.

3775
05:25:30,660 --> 05:25:33,660
The only thing I despise

3776
05:25:33,660 --> 05:25:35,660
is when you have to do, like,

3777
05:25:35,660 --> 05:25:36,660
assassin.

3778
05:25:36,660 --> 05:25:37,660
Can you come here?

3779
05:25:37,660 --> 05:25:38,660
Yeah?

3780
05:25:38,660 --> 05:25:39,660
Yeah?

3781
05:25:39,660 --> 05:25:40,660
Yeah?

3782
05:25:40,660 --> 05:25:41,660
No.

3783
05:25:41,660 --> 05:25:42,660
No.

3784
05:25:42,660 --> 05:25:43,660
No.

3785
05:25:43,660 --> 05:25:44,660
Come back.

3786
05:25:44,660 --> 05:25:45,660
Come back.

3787
05:25:45,660 --> 05:25:46,660
Come back.

3788
05:25:46,660 --> 05:25:47,660
Can I knock him off?

3789
05:25:47,660 --> 05:25:49,660
Why are you trying to hit the air?

3790
05:25:50,660 --> 05:25:51,660
Oh.

3791
05:25:52,660 --> 05:25:53,660
Goodness sake!

3792
05:25:53,660 --> 05:25:55,660
Stop moving a bit!

3793
05:25:55,660 --> 05:25:56,660
Just accept your death.

3794
05:25:56,660 --> 05:25:58,660
It's over for you, buddy.

3795
05:25:59,660 --> 05:26:00,660
Stop it!

3796
05:26:00,660 --> 05:26:02,660
Oh, actually getting teased.

3797
05:26:02,660 --> 05:26:03,660
Stop it.

3798
05:26:03,660 --> 05:26:04,660
There we go.

3799
05:26:04,660 --> 05:26:05,660
My goodness.

3800
05:26:07,660 --> 05:26:08,660
My tummy hurt.

3801
05:26:08,660 --> 05:26:09,660
No more food.

3802
05:26:11,660 --> 05:26:12,660
No more.

3803
05:26:12,660 --> 05:26:13,660
Have you eaten too much?

3804
05:26:13,660 --> 05:26:14,660
Can't forget.

3805
05:26:16,660 --> 05:26:18,660
Have you had any encounter with local fauna?

3806
05:26:18,660 --> 05:26:20,660
Ah, magpies.

3807
05:26:21,660 --> 05:26:24,660
I have befriended wild magpies.

3808
05:26:24,660 --> 05:26:27,660
Although I saw my first snake

3809
05:26:27,660 --> 05:26:29,660
in a cockroach.

3810
05:26:29,660 --> 05:26:30,660
Oh my god.

3811
05:26:30,660 --> 05:26:33,660
There's no such thing as cockroaches

3812
05:26:33,660 --> 05:26:35,660
in Scotland.

3813
05:26:35,660 --> 05:26:37,660
And I met my first...

3814
05:26:37,660 --> 05:26:38,660
And a possum.

3815
05:26:38,660 --> 05:26:39,660
Oh my god.

3816
05:26:39,660 --> 05:26:40,660
Possum are terrifying.

3817
05:26:40,660 --> 05:26:41,660
I don't like...

3818
05:26:41,660 --> 05:26:43,660
I thought they were cute.

3819
05:26:43,660 --> 05:26:46,660
The noise they make at night is like...

3820
05:26:46,660 --> 05:26:48,660
Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!

3821
05:26:48,660 --> 05:26:50,660
Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!

3822
05:26:50,660 --> 05:26:51,660
Very scary.

3823
05:26:51,660 --> 05:26:52,660
Not a fan.

3824
05:26:52,660 --> 05:26:53,660
Not a fan.

3825
05:26:55,660 --> 05:26:57,660
Yeah, I had my first cockroach encounter

3826
05:26:57,660 --> 05:26:58,660
and I'm like,

3827
05:26:58,660 --> 05:26:59,660
I want to go back to Scotland right now.

3828
05:26:59,660 --> 05:27:00,660
Thank you very much.

3829
05:27:03,660 --> 05:27:04,660
Because...

3830
05:27:04,660 --> 05:27:05,660
Oh my goodness.

3831
05:27:06,660 --> 05:27:09,660
Possums are harmless if you leave them alone.

3832
05:27:09,660 --> 05:27:10,660
Yes.

3833
05:27:10,660 --> 05:27:15,660
I accidentally ran into one.

3834
05:27:15,660 --> 05:27:17,660
That sounds really dumb.

3835
05:27:17,660 --> 05:27:20,660
But my cat escaped the garden

3836
05:27:20,660 --> 05:27:25,660
and I had to go into my neighbour's garden.

3837
05:27:25,660 --> 05:27:27,660
And it was one o'clock in the morning

3838
05:27:27,660 --> 05:27:29,660
and thank goodness I'm no in America

3839
05:27:29,660 --> 05:27:32,660
because I probably would have got shot on sight.

3840
05:27:32,660 --> 05:27:33,660
Oh, I'm in trouble.

3841
05:27:35,660 --> 05:27:37,660
And it was absolute nightmare.

3842
05:27:37,660 --> 05:27:40,660
It was freaking so dark

3843
05:27:40,660 --> 05:27:42,660
and I had to run around

3844
05:27:42,660 --> 05:27:44,660
to get into my neighbour's garden

3845
05:27:44,660 --> 05:27:47,660
and there was a possum that was eye level in the fence.

3846
05:27:47,660 --> 05:27:49,660
And both of us basically,

3847
05:27:49,660 --> 05:27:51,660
like, both me and the possum were like,

3848
05:27:51,660 --> 05:27:52,660
eep!

3849
05:27:55,660 --> 05:28:00,660
But yeah, I had to dive into my neighbour's garden

3850
05:28:00,660 --> 05:28:04,660
at 1am to throw my cat back over the fence.

3851
05:28:05,660 --> 05:28:08,660
Yes, Gimli, I'm talking about you.

3852
05:28:09,660 --> 05:28:11,660
Don't do it again.

3853
05:28:11,660 --> 05:28:13,660
I never want to be in that situation again.

3854
05:28:13,660 --> 05:28:16,660
I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox

3855
05:28:16,660 --> 05:28:19,660
being like, I am so sorry if you heard any of that.

3856
05:28:19,660 --> 05:28:21,660
The ruckus last night, that was me.

3857
05:28:21,660 --> 05:28:23,660
No one tried to steal from you.

3858
05:28:23,660 --> 05:28:27,660
And I had to sign it with my freaking address and everything.

3859
05:28:29,660 --> 05:28:30,660
Her name is Gimli.

3860
05:28:30,660 --> 05:28:31,660
Yes.

3861
05:28:31,660 --> 05:28:33,660
Because she's Ginger.

3862
05:28:34,660 --> 05:28:37,660
She's got Ginger on her, so I named my cat Gimli.

3863
05:28:37,660 --> 05:28:42,660
So when I pick her up, I go, that's my wee lad, Gimli.

3864
05:28:44,660 --> 05:28:45,660
Hmm.

3865
05:28:47,660 --> 05:28:49,660
Excuse me, you said, well, the thing was,

3866
05:28:49,660 --> 05:28:51,660
it was literally 1am.

3867
05:28:51,660 --> 05:28:55,660
And like, they had the creakiest gate ever.

3868
05:28:55,660 --> 05:28:58,660
And I'm like, I'm like, Gimli, Gimli, get here,

3869
05:28:58,660 --> 05:29:00,660
Gimli, get here right now, Gimli.

3870
05:29:00,660 --> 05:29:04,660
And because she had never been outside the garden before.

3871
05:29:05,660 --> 05:29:08,660
And she got really confused.

3872
05:29:08,660 --> 05:29:11,660
And was meowing at the door of the neighbour

3873
05:29:11,660 --> 05:29:14,660
instead of coming back over the fence to me.

3874
05:29:14,660 --> 05:29:16,660
Like, I had been calling on her for ages

3875
05:29:16,660 --> 05:29:18,660
and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighbourhoods,

3876
05:29:18,660 --> 05:29:20,660
like the neighbourhoods area.

3877
05:29:20,660 --> 05:29:26,660
And I was like, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli.

3878
05:29:26,660 --> 05:29:30,660
Kill only Donato, big Donato.

3879
05:29:34,660 --> 05:29:38,660
Nobody, no, like, unironically, I had to toss Gimli back into my garden.

3880
05:29:39,660 --> 05:29:42,660
And yeah, she's not here.

3881
05:29:44,660 --> 05:29:47,660
Oh, the music's gonna do the thing.

3882
05:29:48,660 --> 05:29:51,660
I love the pickup of the music.

3883
05:29:57,660 --> 05:30:03,660
Oh my God, veterinary care, though, in Australia is so fairly priced

3884
05:30:03,660 --> 05:30:05,660
and so good.

3885
05:30:06,660 --> 05:30:14,660
My baby boy, he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious

3886
05:30:14,660 --> 05:30:17,660
and he had a cut on his leg.

3887
05:30:18,660 --> 05:30:21,660
And I phoned up a vet and they were like,

3888
05:30:21,660 --> 05:30:26,660
oh, we offer up a pickup service for animals.

3889
05:30:26,660 --> 05:30:29,660
And I'm like, well, I don't drive, so that's perfect, thank you.

3890
05:30:29,660 --> 05:30:33,660
I don't understand how you can do that, though.

3891
05:30:34,660 --> 05:30:36,660
Wait, I need to kill only him?

3892
05:30:36,660 --> 05:30:38,660
Simple.

3893
05:30:39,660 --> 05:30:41,660
You can bowl a cat.

3894
05:30:41,660 --> 05:30:43,660
What?

3895
05:30:43,660 --> 05:30:45,660
Where are my pills?

3896
05:30:48,660 --> 05:30:51,660
But yeah, I phoned up, I'm like,

3897
05:30:51,660 --> 05:30:55,660
my baby boy's got a cut on his leg, I don't know what happened.

3898
05:30:55,660 --> 05:30:58,660
Can I book an appointment?

3899
05:30:58,660 --> 05:31:01,660
I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me.

3900
05:31:01,660 --> 05:31:03,660
Wait, wait, wait, wait, just becoming anonymous.

3901
05:31:03,660 --> 05:31:05,660
Don't hurt anyone.

3902
05:31:05,660 --> 05:31:09,660
Excuse me, good sir, I need this horse, I need the horse.

3903
05:31:09,660 --> 05:31:12,660
Please give horse, horse now, thank you, bye.

3904
05:31:12,660 --> 05:31:16,660
Ow, ow, ow, ow, horse, horse, come, horse.

3905
05:31:16,660 --> 05:31:18,660
Let me on you!

3906
05:31:18,660 --> 05:31:24,660
No, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone.

3907
05:31:24,660 --> 05:31:29,660
Nice, I'm coming in my own horse, this is gonna be ridiculous.

3908
05:31:29,660 --> 05:31:34,660
No, don't run away, don't run away, I need the horse.

3909
05:31:34,660 --> 05:31:36,660
Right, let's go.

3910
05:31:39,660 --> 05:31:41,660
We're safe.

3911
05:31:43,660 --> 05:31:45,660
We're safe, are they chasing?

3912
05:31:45,660 --> 05:31:47,660
Oh, they're chasing!

3913
05:31:47,660 --> 05:31:49,660
Oh, okay, okay.

3914
05:31:49,660 --> 05:31:53,660
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I know which way to go, sorry, sorry, sorry, pardon me,

3915
05:31:53,660 --> 05:31:56,660
excuse me, pardon me, come through, excuse me.

3916
05:31:56,660 --> 05:32:00,660
Uh, right, which path does NPCs not normally take?

3917
05:32:00,660 --> 05:32:02,660
That's one, I guess.

3918
05:32:03,660 --> 05:32:05,660
Okay.

3919
05:32:05,660 --> 05:32:08,660
And we lost them, we're going pretty far now.

3920
05:32:10,660 --> 05:32:16,660
I'm still going, still going, can I go down here?

3921
05:32:16,660 --> 05:32:19,660
Oh, we did it, okay, I'm fine.

3922
05:32:20,660 --> 05:32:22,660
Let's go.

3923
05:32:23,660 --> 05:32:26,660
We took a neighbour cat cat since she got on a fight in Toril Fathom,

3924
05:32:26,660 --> 05:32:28,660
and I was like, give it away to her.

3925
05:32:28,660 --> 05:32:35,660
Yeah, like literally, the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good.

3926
05:32:35,660 --> 05:32:39,660
And they were like, oh, we can like pick up your animal, and I'm like, oh, yes please.

3927
05:32:39,660 --> 05:32:46,660
And I was expecting like $800 or something, and it was like super cheap, and they were so nice.

3928
05:32:46,660 --> 05:32:52,660
And like, it was so quick until when I adopted him, that I was like, I'm so sorry,

3929
05:32:52,660 --> 05:32:57,660
I have absolutely no idea what the temperament he's going to be, like please be careful,

3930
05:32:57,660 --> 05:33:00,660
he might be aggressive, like I don't know how he's going to act, and they were like,

3931
05:33:00,660 --> 05:33:05,660
oh, he was just like a sweet little angel, and I'm like, oh, thank you, I'm so glad.

3932
05:33:06,660 --> 05:33:08,660
So what happened next with Gimli?

3933
05:33:08,660 --> 05:33:15,660
Oh, well, threw her back over the fence, and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her,

3934
05:33:15,660 --> 05:33:20,660
because she is a silly, silly sausage and gives me a heart attack.

3935
05:33:24,660 --> 05:33:30,660
I unfortunately live like on car roads.

3936
05:33:30,660 --> 05:33:38,660
Actually, one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed limit,

3937
05:33:38,660 --> 05:33:42,660
or the speed limit is ridiculously high, and I'm not being funny.

3938
05:33:42,660 --> 05:33:45,660
The speed of freaking cars is ridiculous over here.

3939
05:33:45,660 --> 05:33:52,660
It's very Americanized, sorry, sorry to be mean and stinky, because I should be really thankful like that.

3940
05:33:52,660 --> 05:34:00,660
I even have like the ability to like, basically like check out another country type thing,

3941
05:34:00,660 --> 05:34:05,660
like I should be grateful and all that, but it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to complain, so I will complain.

3942
05:34:06,660 --> 05:34:10,660
But I'm trying to think that once, hold on.

3943
05:34:13,660 --> 05:34:20,660
So you did, literally, what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence.

3944
05:34:20,660 --> 05:34:26,660
So I basically, now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like, oh my god, you're,

3945
05:34:26,660 --> 05:34:29,660
was it a linear or whatever her name was, 2.0 or whatever.

3946
05:34:29,660 --> 05:34:35,660
No, I put her back on the tree, like I like sugled her back on the tree,

3947
05:34:35,660 --> 05:34:40,660
and then I knew she was back in the garden, and then I had to run around and go back in,

3948
05:34:40,660 --> 05:34:44,660
like in my garden and bring her back into the house.

3949
05:34:44,660 --> 05:34:50,660
And obviously she was on time at like, she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that.

3950
05:34:50,660 --> 05:34:53,660
We know you never helped me, yeah.

3951
05:34:53,660 --> 05:34:55,660
Oh, sitting in the chat for me.

3952
05:34:55,660 --> 05:34:57,660
Why you gonna go home?

3953
05:34:57,660 --> 05:35:01,660
You go into a car crash, listen to the sheebie, you're joking.

3954
05:35:05,660 --> 05:35:08,660
You're joking, you're in a car crash.

3955
05:35:08,660 --> 05:35:11,660
You heard it here first.

3956
05:35:11,660 --> 05:35:18,660
The violor is causing people serious damage to their health.

3957
05:35:18,660 --> 05:35:21,660
You've heard it here first.

3958
05:35:21,660 --> 05:35:23,660
Oh, we've done all the missions.

3959
05:35:23,660 --> 05:35:27,660
So we can do courtesans, we can do these.

3960
05:35:27,660 --> 05:35:29,660
We can do Copernacle.

3961
05:35:29,660 --> 05:35:31,660
What's our DNA percentage now?

3962
05:35:31,660 --> 05:35:33,660
62?

3963
05:35:46,660 --> 05:35:49,660
Wait, the treasures count as 100%?!

3964
05:35:49,660 --> 05:35:51,660
Ignoring the treasures?

3965
05:35:58,660 --> 05:36:00,660
Hope you're okay.

3966
05:36:00,660 --> 05:36:02,660
Did you have to like call the police?

3967
05:36:02,660 --> 05:36:05,660
I think you have to report it to the police if you get hit.

3968
05:36:05,660 --> 05:36:07,660
I'm gonna cry.

3969
05:36:08,660 --> 05:36:10,660
Oh.

3970
05:36:18,660 --> 05:36:20,660
Why are they doing that?

3971
05:36:20,660 --> 05:36:22,660
Okay, Leonardo says 18%.

3972
05:36:22,660 --> 05:36:24,660
I think that's holding us back on the DNA.

3973
05:36:24,660 --> 05:36:25,660
Right, we're doing it.

3974
05:36:25,660 --> 05:36:27,660
We're doing it, Leonardo.

3975
05:36:28,660 --> 05:36:31,660
Oh no, Majobi's came back.

3976
05:36:32,660 --> 05:36:35,660
You know, sometimes if you hold it, it goes away again.

3977
05:36:35,660 --> 05:36:37,660
It's coming back.

3978
05:36:42,660 --> 05:36:44,660
Where's Kaka Ann on when you need him?

3979
05:36:44,660 --> 05:36:48,660
I had a really funny story for him, but I don't even know if he's here anymore.

3980
05:36:49,660 --> 05:36:52,660
And it's the one that wanted to hear me fart in the toilet.

3981
05:36:52,660 --> 05:36:54,660
I don't know if he's still here.

3982
05:36:54,660 --> 05:36:57,660
But if he is, I'll tell you a really funny story.

3983
05:36:57,660 --> 05:36:59,660
And it's really gross.

3984
05:37:00,660 --> 05:37:02,660
Shit!

3985
05:37:03,660 --> 05:37:05,660
Yo-yoing your poop?

3986
05:37:05,660 --> 05:37:07,660
No! No!

3987
05:37:07,660 --> 05:37:09,660
A little bit though.

3988
05:37:09,660 --> 05:37:11,660
I feel like, oh, I think I've said this before,

3989
05:37:11,660 --> 05:37:14,660
and this is the dumbest statement I'll ever say.

3990
05:37:14,660 --> 05:37:17,660
But I feel like if you're a guy, if you're yo-yo, can you not like...

3991
05:37:19,660 --> 05:37:21,660
stimulate your pee?

3992
05:37:21,660 --> 05:37:23,660
Doing that?

3993
05:37:24,660 --> 05:37:26,660
Use a smoke bomb to stun the overseer?

3994
05:37:26,660 --> 05:37:28,660
Not overseer, sure. I can 100% not.

3995
05:37:28,660 --> 05:37:30,660
Easy peasy.

3996
05:37:30,660 --> 05:37:32,660
Yes, I do have a stun bomb on me.

3997
05:37:33,660 --> 05:37:35,660
Locate the overseer.

3998
05:37:35,660 --> 05:37:37,660
What? No comment.

3999
05:37:37,660 --> 05:37:39,660
Literally, like, isn't that a thing that guys can do?

4000
05:37:43,660 --> 05:37:46,660
Still surprised no one said, I'm doing it right now.

4001
05:37:46,660 --> 05:37:48,660
Right.

4002
05:37:48,660 --> 05:37:50,660
And then...

4003
05:37:50,660 --> 05:37:52,660
Oh, we got a double assassination out of that.

4004
05:37:52,660 --> 05:37:54,660
Oh, the others just disappeared.

4005
05:37:54,660 --> 05:37:56,660
Right, we'll do any Leonardo.

4006
05:37:57,660 --> 05:37:59,660
I've never felt good from...

4007
05:37:59,660 --> 05:38:01,660
Well, aren't you in luck?

4008
05:38:01,660 --> 05:38:03,660
I have a four-part trading series.

4009
05:38:03,660 --> 05:38:05,660
See if it's for you, and if you finish the series,

4010
05:38:05,660 --> 05:38:07,660
and you don't like it,

4011
05:38:07,660 --> 05:38:09,660
then actually, you were right.

4012
05:38:09,660 --> 05:38:11,660
It really isn't for you.

4013
05:38:14,660 --> 05:38:16,660
Whoa, that's a lot of money.

4014
05:38:17,660 --> 05:38:19,660
So...

4015
05:38:23,660 --> 05:38:25,660
You stay away from the back door.

4016
05:38:26,660 --> 05:38:30,660
I mean, I don't know if once you've done all those things...

4017
05:38:32,660 --> 05:38:35,660
If there's really much of a point of sending them away,

4018
05:38:35,660 --> 05:38:39,660
other than one, one, two, three, and four.

4019
05:38:39,660 --> 05:38:41,660
Yeah, that looks good.

4020
05:38:42,660 --> 05:38:45,660
Did she be heck on wheels?

4021
05:38:45,660 --> 05:38:47,660
Not? Yeah, I might not have even done it,

4022
05:38:47,660 --> 05:38:49,660
I don't know, honestly.

4023
05:38:50,660 --> 05:38:52,660
Oh, I think I need...

4024
05:38:52,660 --> 05:38:53,660
I think I need toilet time,

4025
05:38:53,660 --> 05:38:54,660
but it's gonna take me like five minutes,

4026
05:38:54,660 --> 05:38:56,660
because I'm a nervous poopo.

4027
05:38:56,660 --> 05:38:59,660
I'm a nervous poopo when I sweep with some wheezing.

4028
05:38:59,660 --> 05:39:02,660
That comes flying out of my nose.

4029
05:39:03,660 --> 05:39:05,660
I remember I felt more embarrassed by a streamer in my life,

4030
05:39:05,660 --> 05:39:06,660
because SUV man went,

4031
05:39:06,660 --> 05:39:07,660
what was that?

4032
05:39:07,660 --> 05:39:09,660
And I just went, listen to a podcast.

4033
05:39:10,660 --> 05:39:12,660
Oh, are she bees in your ears like,

4034
05:39:13,660 --> 05:39:15,660
like spitting on you and that?

4035
05:39:15,660 --> 05:39:17,660
He's like, weren't you listening to me?

4036
05:39:18,660 --> 05:39:19,660
Flying machine...

4037
05:39:19,660 --> 05:39:21,660
Oh, I think I picked like the hardest one.

4038
05:39:21,660 --> 05:39:25,660
Do not get shot while using the bomber.

4039
05:39:25,660 --> 05:39:26,660
Okay.

4040
05:39:30,660 --> 05:39:34,660
Do not get shot while using the bomber.

4041
05:39:36,660 --> 05:39:39,660
Do not get shot.

4042
05:39:40,660 --> 05:39:42,660
So am I allowed to be spotted,

4043
05:39:42,660 --> 05:39:44,660
or is this a classic warning being detected

4044
05:39:44,660 --> 05:39:45,660
because desynchronization?

4045
05:39:45,660 --> 05:39:47,660
Okay, I need to go poopy.

4046
05:39:47,660 --> 05:39:48,660
I'm nervous.

4047
05:39:48,660 --> 05:39:50,660
I'm scared of this part of the section.

4048
05:39:50,660 --> 05:39:51,660
Do you guys want it?

4049
05:39:51,660 --> 05:39:54,660
What happens if we all take a job at the exact same time?

4050
05:40:04,660 --> 05:40:06,660
I'm having lots of water,

4051
05:40:06,660 --> 05:40:09,660
so I need to make sure the organs are all ready

4052
05:40:09,660 --> 05:40:11,660
for this ball man about to drop.

4053
05:40:23,660 --> 05:40:24,660
Okay, I'm gonna mute.

4054
05:40:24,660 --> 05:40:26,660
I will be a few moments,

4055
05:40:26,660 --> 05:40:28,660
so do forgive me for this.

4056
05:40:29,660 --> 05:40:31,660
Who said link up or put mods?

4057
05:40:31,660 --> 05:40:32,660
No, I'm just kidding.

4058
05:40:33,660 --> 05:40:34,660
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4059
05:40:35,660 --> 05:40:36,660
Okay.

4060
05:40:36,660 --> 05:40:38,660

4105
05:48:11,680 --> 05:48:26,040
I don't know about you lads, but I came flying over me.

4106
05:48:26,040 --> 05:48:30,960
I'm grabbing my cup of tea and I'm gonna make a honey tea, I'll be back in like literally

4107
05:48:30,960 --> 05:48:31,960
a minute.

4108
05:48:31,960 --> 05:48:38,960
Okay that was already boiling.

4109
05:49:31,960 --> 05:49:54,120
Well, I have absolutely horrific news, I've not got any tea bags left, there'll be no

4110
05:49:54,120 --> 05:50:00,040
honey tea for me and this has shot me, that was a moment for me to, I'm so sorry if you

4111
05:50:00,040 --> 05:50:07,320
dropped in on that moment, we all collectively went for adobe, I can't believe I'm fricking

4112
05:50:07,320 --> 05:50:13,160
out of tea bags, I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm gonna like, the one thing I do like about

4113
05:50:13,160 --> 05:50:23,520
Australian supermarkets, they have big like stuff, oh my, calibration is off, hold on,

4114
05:50:24,520 --> 05:50:30,520
there, that's my calibration, I don't know why I was looking all the way over that way,

4115
05:50:30,520 --> 05:50:41,400
I have no idea if we're gonna be able to do this, do you want people to tell you when

4116
05:50:41,400 --> 05:50:46,240
the other girls go live or when you ask for it, please always tell me when a girl goes

4117
05:50:46,240 --> 05:50:59,360
live, I can't always keep up and I suck, right, I am not to be detected, interesting, if I'm

4118
05:50:59,360 --> 05:51:06,960
not to be detected, wait what am I supposed to do though, locate the architect, but don't

4119
05:51:06,960 --> 05:51:25,520
be detected please, okay, I, there's two together, how am I supposed to be able to navigate, you

4120
05:51:25,520 --> 05:51:29,920
play some games where you versus the chat and hypnotise them so you win honestly though, I

4121
05:51:29,920 --> 05:51:36,280
wanted to do an IQ test and then I want a chat to do an IQ test, like we do a poll for what

4122
05:51:36,280 --> 05:51:58,840
the answer is and see what like the results are, are they gonna spot me, wait, wow, I love all the

4123
05:51:58,840 --> 05:52:08,520
bugs in this game, full stop, I just love them all, game don't be detected, then why is that man on

4124
05:52:08,520 --> 05:52:15,600
the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work the victory, oh no you guys are allowed to win,

4125
05:52:15,600 --> 05:52:20,320
I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I think it hit me in the stream where I make

4126
05:52:20,320 --> 05:52:26,680
y'all dumb, really good, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk,

4127
05:52:26,680 --> 05:52:37,040
I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him over there,

4128
05:52:37,040 --> 05:52:55,040
I'm having a, I don't have a choice, yeah I was gonna say I don't have a choice because he was

4129
05:52:55,040 --> 05:53:02,400
coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right, I'm gonna be number one, chats IQ's

4130
05:53:02,400 --> 05:53:10,560
room temperature, but that's why we're so good for each other, we're so bad, is that tracking funny

4131
05:53:10,560 --> 05:53:15,960
to me, I think, oh my tracking is funny, I fucking hate this iPhone for some reason, sorry that I got

4132
05:53:15,960 --> 05:53:24,960
really aggressive out of nowhere, whenever it is horizontal it does not track me full stop, horizontal,

4133
05:53:24,960 --> 05:53:30,240
vertical, no when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge it

4134
05:53:30,320 --> 05:53:36,800
while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical, it's not tracking being rubbish all day,

4135
05:53:38,240 --> 05:53:44,800
I'll just over enunciate my word, so you guys, I don't know where this enemy is genuinely,

4136
05:53:48,880 --> 05:53:57,920
can I, oh it was me, pardon me for being so rough, I guess I can do this kind of stuff,

4137
05:54:01,200 --> 05:54:02,400
and loot the bodies,

4138
05:54:07,440 --> 05:54:10,800
could you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there,

4139
05:54:13,680 --> 05:54:18,800
oh, so it's on like the world's tiniest tripod which is adorable,

4140
05:54:19,760 --> 05:54:30,640
I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is, I'm supposed to be trying to find him,

4141
05:54:35,680 --> 05:54:38,400
I'm gonna loot these bodies and hopefully get more supplies,

4142
05:54:38,400 --> 05:54:41,360
because one poison, one medicine wasn't a deal,

4143
05:54:42,320 --> 05:54:45,920
I'm not good, the position of the arms is all wrong for the saltarello,

4144
05:54:45,920 --> 05:54:49,760
please expire so I can loot your body, sorry, okay there we go,

4145
05:54:51,440 --> 05:54:55,200
to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is off or not, since we don't have a reference,

4146
05:54:55,200 --> 05:55:01,840
all right let me build my webcam lets, where is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the

4147
05:55:01,840 --> 05:55:08,400
church or something, is he in it, is he the one by the hay bale, he can't be,

4148
05:55:12,080 --> 05:55:12,480
um,

4149
05:55:16,080 --> 05:55:17,920
have I been everywhere yet, I don't know,

4150
05:55:19,600 --> 05:55:24,960
so those were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why,

4151
05:55:26,400 --> 05:55:27,520
no, what,

4152
05:55:30,880 --> 05:55:40,960
is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling me to stay in this section,

4153
05:55:41,840 --> 05:55:49,040
I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your voice it's saying,

4154
05:55:50,320 --> 05:55:53,040
love cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true,

4155
05:55:55,600 --> 05:55:58,320
I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl,

4156
05:55:59,280 --> 05:56:13,760
okay, look at that, I think we're just gonna have to literally go around the map and clean it up,

4157
05:56:13,760 --> 05:56:16,080
because this is,

4158
05:56:19,920 --> 05:56:26,560
use eagle engine to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing is being

4159
05:56:26,560 --> 05:56:36,320
highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they still, we're checking the hay bale,

4160
05:56:47,360 --> 05:56:55,600
they're like, those guards from down there come any closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them with

4161
05:56:55,600 --> 05:57:01,520
poison, like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video game,

4162
05:57:01,520 --> 05:57:03,360
I've literally been to all sections of this map,

4163
05:57:12,080 --> 05:57:18,320
wait that didn't happen, okay, I hit them that time, I'm gonna loot their bodies to get all the supplies,

4164
05:57:18,320 --> 05:57:27,200
oh they'll meet them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building?

4165
05:57:38,320 --> 05:57:46,560
more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk into

4166
05:57:46,560 --> 05:57:57,760
guards that are like flailing about and it's like, bro, hopefully I can get more ammo off

4167
05:57:57,760 --> 05:58:03,840
these guys and I'm not spending more, I just get, I'm getting more poison back which is fine,

4168
05:58:03,840 --> 05:58:09,440
if I'm spending poison it's good to get poison back, but am I getting,

4169
05:58:16,800 --> 05:58:19,680
okay, I didn't, so he does just roam the map,

4170
05:58:24,960 --> 05:58:31,440
okay, all those guards, don't want to be these things because I stopped,

4171
05:58:34,800 --> 05:58:45,680
I didn't really see it turned back, I'm very confused with this mission, so like I had to

4172
05:58:45,680 --> 05:58:51,440
find him walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm gonna go on the roof because

4173
05:58:51,440 --> 05:59:00,320
there's that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill

4174
05:59:00,320 --> 05:59:11,360
with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, okay, fuck it, I'll do it, hopefully this gives

4175
05:59:11,360 --> 05:59:22,800
me like a loading point, give me the plans, right now, oh yeah, honestly me,

4176
05:59:31,280 --> 05:59:37,840
that took so long to progress, I do apologize, that must be painful, right, so what happened

4177
05:59:38,480 --> 05:59:46,320
now, I'm notorious, okay, I can deal with that, I've definitely progressed to the next loading

4178
05:59:46,320 --> 05:59:51,360
screen, so again we've not failed 100%, do not get shot while using the bomber,

4179
05:59:52,080 --> 05:59:59,760
surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber, surely I will not have any issues at all

4180
05:59:59,760 --> 06:00:05,440
and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch

4181
06:00:05,440 --> 06:00:14,960
on that, oh it hits you with a ver, oh sorry, I need time to perish like right now, so don't get caught,

4182
06:00:17,200 --> 06:00:26,480
no I have no interest, surely absolutely health and copium, right, next loading point, yes please,

4183
06:00:26,880 --> 06:00:37,520
oh I'm at,

4184
06:00:37,520 --> 06:00:43,120
I'm to not be detected by the two guards that are across from each other,

4185
06:00:45,840 --> 06:00:49,440
yeah, I'm not to be detected by the two point blank guards,

4186
06:00:50,400 --> 06:00:58,560
I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way, and then he will be distracted by him,

4187
06:01:01,680 --> 06:01:08,640
I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's in the way,

4188
06:01:09,520 --> 06:01:20,000
get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that,

4189
06:01:20,560 --> 06:01:24,560
but they've made them a little too well, okay, they've made them a little too well,

4190
06:01:26,800 --> 06:01:32,160
okay yeah my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you,

4191
06:01:33,120 --> 06:01:37,840
there's no way, or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, give me, let me click for the

4192
06:01:42,800 --> 06:01:46,960
my elaborate set up from yesterday, I removed all the cups from my ring, look at them ass,

4193
06:01:47,840 --> 06:01:51,680
when I had the perfect set up,

4194
06:01:59,120 --> 06:02:00,640
that looks much more,

4195
06:02:03,120 --> 06:02:10,160
okay and then we'll look for supplies, the poor NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm

4196
06:02:10,160 --> 06:02:17,200
gonna be so mad, because I don't know what to expect,

4197
06:02:17,200 --> 06:02:30,160
okay, these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous,

4198
06:02:32,560 --> 06:02:41,680
these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous, okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see

4199
06:02:41,680 --> 06:02:54,480
the ones coming down the hill, I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted,

4200
06:02:54,480 --> 06:03:04,160
I'm just gonna hide in here, unleash the archers, good evening skulls, I'm nervous, I don't know

4201
06:03:04,160 --> 06:03:15,760
what to do here, I'm just kind of waiting around, waiting for the EI to kick in, so I don't know

4202
06:03:15,760 --> 06:03:24,640
what to do now, oh yeah that, must have been drinking the good stuff, must have been drinking the good stuff,

4203
06:03:25,120 --> 06:03:34,480
okay we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts are,

4204
06:03:35,920 --> 06:03:40,480
yeah you know don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly

4205
06:03:40,480 --> 06:03:49,040
don't be afraid, no I missed shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no next one, use the other

4206
06:03:49,040 --> 06:03:57,040
guys, okay there we go, we're gonna let these two bodies so we can refill our poison, we're taking

4207
06:03:57,040 --> 06:04:06,960
it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah, okay these are both poisoned,

4208
06:04:06,960 --> 06:04:13,600
again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow, you know we don't need it too

4209
06:04:13,680 --> 06:04:19,120
fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere,

4210
06:04:27,920 --> 06:04:34,080
but remember don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through do you think,

4211
06:04:35,280 --> 06:04:36,880
I'll still finish it anyway, but

4212
06:04:37,440 --> 06:04:43,200
no, oh yeah, wow you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that,

4213
06:04:45,120 --> 06:04:49,920
she be redirect, oh no they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now,

4214
06:04:54,320 --> 06:05:02,800
I'm gonna be region, they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer, nice cozy atmosphere, remember the

4215
06:05:02,800 --> 06:05:06,160
guys gagging and choking on the background, literally, I'm gonna just need a whistle to my

4216
06:05:06,160 --> 06:05:14,720
teeth, whistle while you work, your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the dlc stuff because like

4217
06:05:16,400 --> 06:05:18,000
I don't know there's anyone up here,

4218
06:05:18,960 --> 06:05:27,440
oh my gosh,

4219
06:05:33,280 --> 06:05:39,440
I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like

4220
06:05:40,000 --> 06:05:54,800
and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth, oh no, oh no, no he can't see us again,

4221
06:05:55,680 --> 06:06:08,000
he needs to forget about us like right now, he needs to like okay, wow that was dangerous,

4222
06:06:10,400 --> 06:06:16,880
hold on, I think we'll be investigated by another guard, right there's one in there,

4223
06:06:18,480 --> 06:06:22,240
yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies,

4224
06:06:22,960 --> 06:06:26,800
I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff,

4225
06:06:27,200 --> 06:06:36,480
oh my goodness, she be caught and bummed herself, thank you for the wait,

4226
06:06:38,000 --> 06:06:45,200

4229
06:07:04,000 --> 06:07:08,080

4230
06:07:08,080 --> 06:07:15,120
something, geez, I don't know, maybe you should give each other a little kiss, if you're just like

4231
06:07:15,200 --> 06:07:21,760
so in tune with each other, please, Emmy ready to she be, she be ready to do

4233
06:07:31,200 --> 06:07:39,200
hi Emmy, hope you both enjoyed your streams, hope you enjoyed your streams, we are currently doing

4234
06:07:39,760 --> 06:07:48,400
Leonardo's missions and I'm currently debating if I'm actually capable of 100% in this game,

4235
06:07:49,040 --> 06:07:55,840
unfortunately my answer is it might be, it might be a no, I don't actually think I have the

4236
06:07:55,840 --> 06:08:01,600
thingy, just guarantee the vods getting nuked, okay, guys I'm trying to get you monetized on

4237
06:08:01,600 --> 06:08:09,600
YouTube, right, I can get him, I need this archer over here done, yeah, okay, I'm glad that looks,

4238
06:08:10,640 --> 06:08:15,200
that's good, is that a flag over there, I don't know, maybe just a treasure,

4239
06:08:16,640 --> 06:08:25,680
sorry it's fine, I'm teasing, you guys can do what you want, but I'm not, I need to go there, what?

4240
06:08:25,680 --> 06:08:38,320
Oh goodness me, que cosa, I actually think I want that guard to forget I exist,

4241
06:08:42,240 --> 06:08:48,080
she seems so grown up, it's fine, we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 2,

4242
06:08:48,960 --> 06:08:56,160
which is a very beloved childhood game of mine, I believe Mercy's coming online in one, two,

4243
06:08:56,160 --> 06:09:03,440
three hours, just under three hours, so if you are a snippet, you are welcome to hang about

4244
06:09:04,400 --> 06:09:11,760
till it's mercy time, that's very, oh that guy up there, I don't like him,

4245
06:09:12,160 --> 06:09:19,440
I think I'm gonna have to start looting bodies as well, because I'm running low on ammo,

4246
06:09:19,440 --> 06:09:41,120
so that was actually rather humus, oh what a post to be left on, POV, you're a harem,

4247
06:09:42,400 --> 06:09:44,800
that's the position she'd be gonna leave you in at the end of the night,

4248
06:09:44,880 --> 06:09:50,160
yep no bad, it's already dead,

4249
06:09:54,560 --> 06:09:57,280
wait it already got a warning, that was pretty quick,

4250
06:10:01,040 --> 06:10:05,040
that was pretty rough, Jesus, I private it over here, ah I should have gone,

4251
06:10:05,760 --> 06:10:09,040
ah let's see, let's do poison,

4252
06:10:13,280 --> 06:10:14,720
oh let's not do poison again,

4253
06:10:20,160 --> 06:10:27,520
oh she'd be making a smart move, five head move, this is so sad, I only got to see half of it,

4254
06:10:28,800 --> 06:10:33,360
there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry, it's not one and done,

4255
06:10:34,320 --> 06:10:39,600
we're not, we ain't one and done around these parts, hopefully YouTube gets this stuff missed,

4256
06:10:40,720 --> 06:10:46,960
there's a few things going on with YouTube right now, this is a very slow based mission

4257
06:10:46,960 --> 06:10:50,480
by the way, because every time we poison I have to wait until they're perished and then I have

4258
06:10:50,480 --> 06:10:54,080
to loot them and then I have to go for the next part, I don't know if I can reach anything here,

4259
06:10:54,400 --> 06:10:58,560
just outside but I need him gone,

4260
06:11:01,280 --> 06:11:03,520
I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower,

4261
06:11:06,000 --> 06:11:08,800
he's out arranging these guys, but I'm not gonna do it,

4262
06:11:08,800 --> 06:11:15,440
Strani you're always streaming, are you okay, ah yeah it's called, I am sharing my childhood games

4263
06:11:15,440 --> 06:11:22,160
and I love them and I want to share them, it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday, I was a bit,

4264
06:11:22,160 --> 06:11:22,880
can he see me?

4265
06:11:26,560 --> 06:11:32,800
He can, man needs glasses, I mean Tuarev will literally let you upload, true,

4266
06:11:37,600 --> 06:11:44,960
lovely, lovely stuff, we will be taking this very easy,

4267
06:11:45,200 --> 06:11:51,680
I am not sure how to get

4268
06:11:56,640 --> 06:12:00,160
out of safety, we're gonna be doing a lot of poison right now,

4269
06:12:02,160 --> 06:12:07,600
I'm, I don't know if I can leap from there to that and I don't want to risk it,

4270
06:12:07,600 --> 06:12:12,240
that looks like a leap over definitely, like that 100% looks like a leap over so,

4271
06:12:13,120 --> 06:12:17,920
right they're currently poisoned below me, so I should be safe to make my,

4272
06:12:20,240 --> 06:12:25,280
there's a lot of red there, I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though,

4273
06:12:27,360 --> 06:12:31,520
a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is all inspiring, I just really enjoy

4274
06:12:31,520 --> 06:12:37,600
these video games, I definitely will be focusing, please don't think my streams like are all gonna

4275
06:12:37,600 --> 06:12:41,600
be 18 hours, like tomorrow's needy streamer overload, I've never played it before but

4276
06:12:41,600 --> 06:12:47,760
it's definitely gonna be a shorter stream because I don't even know if I like it and

4277
06:12:48,480 --> 06:12:56,400
whenever like I have the, whoa, it's so careful, what happens if I spin around a beam

4278
06:12:57,280 --> 06:13:03,600
and a, no need to poison these two down here, I'm not risking it,

4279
06:13:04,160 --> 06:13:12,720
not risking it at all, we have come too far, right onto the beam,

4280
06:13:15,360 --> 06:13:19,600
I'm just going poison route because poison stops them from being able to see me,

4281
06:13:21,040 --> 06:13:30,640
and yeah, I'm gonna loot this guy's body because archers normally have a lot more stuff on him,

4282
06:13:33,600 --> 06:13:38,560
called fish are venomous, there is one called fish is venomous but my ink isn't venomous,

4283
06:13:39,680 --> 06:13:45,440
it's an aphrodisiac, it puts you under my alluring spell,

4284
06:13:47,680 --> 06:13:50,800
that's so, what is bro doing, poison them,

4285
06:13:53,280 --> 06:13:57,280
the lead artist for needy streamer overload is one of my favorite artists, I'm a sucker for

4286
06:13:58,240 --> 06:14:06,400
oh his and she booty's stuff, right, we need to be super careful because this is the most

4287
06:14:06,400 --> 06:14:12,640
ridiculous thing for trying to spot enemies, there's like guys all the way up this tower

4288
06:14:13,440 --> 06:14:19,040
and it is so hard to know when one's about to see you and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again

4289
06:14:20,480 --> 06:14:25,360
but I'm getting scared, okay I can see one guy up there, it must be there all on the roof

4290
06:14:28,240 --> 06:14:35,200
under your lure, not your visa, you might have a streaming edition, I can't believe it,

4291
06:14:37,120 --> 06:14:38,240
oh almost fell there,

4292
06:14:41,360 --> 06:14:51,520
you said you might not be able to 100% it, there's a few 100% that I genuinely don't know

4293
06:14:51,760 --> 06:15:00,080
and I'm worried about not being able to do my, like I just simply cannot do it and I can't

4294
06:15:00,080 --> 06:15:06,800
like call, I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me and so I've still, I'm still

4295
06:15:06,800 --> 06:15:15,840
not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not, I can hear music, how am I supposed to hurt

4296
06:15:15,840 --> 06:15:28,640
them all at once, I don't think that, is that a flag this room, no what, the sun's getting further

4297
06:15:29,520 --> 06:15:46,720
um, why isn't it, what am I supposed to do, no, oh, okay, okay, I understand, I thought I was about

4298
06:15:46,720 --> 06:15:54,240
to be exposed right at the end there, right, in order to 100% this mission, do not get shot

4299
06:15:54,240 --> 06:16:00,880
while using the bomber, okay, we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now, all I have to

4300
06:16:00,880 --> 06:16:08,560
do is nail this off the bat and I don't even remember freaking doing this, oh I'm going to start

4301
06:16:08,560 --> 06:16:23,120
sweating, okay, don't get shot using the bomber, oh why can we not get like a little tutorial first,

4302
06:16:23,840 --> 06:16:30,400
destroy the workshops, I can do that, I can do that, it's fine, tactical camera, no not tactical,

4303
06:16:30,400 --> 06:16:38,800
that was awful, don't ever do that again, press retreat to fire, R2, oh no, oh my god I'm going

4304
06:16:38,800 --> 06:16:43,120
down, this is not good, this is not good, oh my god, I don't know the controls, I don't know the

4305
06:16:43,120 --> 06:16:53,280
controls, oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is, it's the one, if I take a right,

4306
06:16:53,280 --> 06:16:57,600
I don't think I'm going to make it, just go for the one that I'm hitting at, oh my god there's

4307
06:16:57,680 --> 06:17:07,280
archer towers, no no no no no no no no no no no no!

4308
06:17:17,360 --> 06:17:23,840
I didn't even hit that tower, yeah, see this is what I'm afraid of, that I can't 100%, I'm under

4309
06:17:23,840 --> 06:17:29,200
After the impression, I now have to redo this entire mission again.

4310
06:17:29,200 --> 06:17:33,400
I missed that again?

4311
06:17:33,400 --> 06:17:34,400
I'm trying so hard.

4312
06:17:34,400 --> 06:17:37,520
I think I'm going to have to go further away.

4313
06:17:37,520 --> 06:17:39,520
I don't think there's a checkpoint.

4314
06:17:39,520 --> 06:17:41,520
I never gave an indication.

4315
06:17:41,520 --> 06:17:48,000
Okay, there we go.

4316
06:17:48,000 --> 06:17:51,120
Shoot workshop twi- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my controller, Jesus.

4317
06:17:51,120 --> 06:17:53,120
Oh, please, my goodness.

4318
06:17:53,360 --> 06:17:55,360
I almost didn't make it there.

4319
06:17:55,360 --> 06:17:57,360
I did that.

4320
06:17:57,360 --> 06:18:01,360
Okay, then do this.

4321
06:18:01,360 --> 06:18:03,360
And I missed, so that's okay.

4322
06:18:03,360 --> 06:18:05,360
We just need to do it go around a bit.

4323
06:18:05,360 --> 06:18:09,360
Oh, well, maybe we're going to just straight up attack this one.

4324
06:18:09,360 --> 06:18:13,360
I missed.

4325
06:18:13,360 --> 06:18:15,360
Whoa.

4326
06:18:15,360 --> 06:18:21,360
Hopefully there is checkpoints because that does seem very harsh.

4327
06:18:21,360 --> 06:18:24,400
I completely, I did, I will admit, I twided it all up.

4328
06:18:24,400 --> 06:18:26,400
I'm going to get my own.

4329
06:18:26,400 --> 06:18:28,400
I need a fire right now.

4330
06:18:28,400 --> 06:18:30,400
Oh, goodness me.

4331
06:18:30,400 --> 06:18:32,400
Goodness, gravy.

4332
06:18:32,400 --> 06:18:34,400
They didn't even make this game easy.

4333
06:18:34,400 --> 06:18:36,400
There we go.

4334
06:18:36,400 --> 06:18:38,400
Destroyed that one.

4335
06:18:38,400 --> 06:18:42,400
Honestly, this section was a lot harder on paper, I think.

4336
06:18:42,400 --> 06:18:44,400
There.

4337
06:18:46,400 --> 06:18:48,400
There.

4338
06:18:48,400 --> 06:18:50,400
All right, now what?

4339
06:18:51,920 --> 06:18:55,920
Only if you die, you have to repeat home missions if you play a port.

4340
06:18:58,400 --> 06:19:00,400
A checkpoint at the start of the bomb.

4341
06:19:00,400 --> 06:19:02,400
Destroy the bomber.

4342
06:19:02,400 --> 06:19:03,360
Where?

4343
06:19:03,360 --> 06:19:05,360
Oh, I see.

4344
06:19:05,360 --> 06:19:07,360
Speedrun over there.

4345
06:19:07,360 --> 06:19:09,360
Can we aimbot it?

4346
06:19:09,360 --> 06:19:11,360
Three, two, one.

4347
06:19:11,360 --> 06:19:13,360
Oh, I think that was a miss.

4348
06:19:13,360 --> 06:19:15,360
A swinging a miss.

4349
06:19:15,360 --> 06:19:17,360
Swinging a miss, swinging a miss.

4350
06:19:17,360 --> 06:19:19,360
Hold on, let's try again.

4351
06:19:19,360 --> 06:19:21,360
Wow, I cannot control this right now.

4352
06:19:21,360 --> 06:19:23,360
I'm completely looking in the wrong direction.

4353
06:19:25,360 --> 06:19:27,360
I...

4354
06:19:27,360 --> 06:19:29,360
Bruv.

4355
06:19:29,360 --> 06:19:31,360
Bruv.

4356
06:19:31,360 --> 06:19:33,360
Bruv.

4357
06:19:33,360 --> 06:19:35,360
Bruv.

4358
06:19:35,360 --> 06:19:37,360
Yeah, okay.

4359
06:19:37,360 --> 06:19:39,360
Controls, please, thank you.

4360
06:19:39,360 --> 06:19:41,360
Oh, no, there's more.

4361
06:19:41,360 --> 06:19:43,360
Okay, okay, it's okay.

4362
06:19:43,360 --> 06:19:45,360
It's okay.

4363
06:19:45,360 --> 06:19:47,360
I'm just trying to set a fire along the way.

4364
06:19:47,360 --> 06:19:49,360
I am... Hello, game?

4365
06:19:49,360 --> 06:19:51,360
Respond, please.

4366
06:19:51,360 --> 06:19:53,360
I missed, and it's okay.

4367
06:19:53,360 --> 06:19:55,360
It's okay.

4368
06:19:57,360 --> 06:19:59,360
We're gonna bomb that, get a bit of speed.

4369
06:19:59,360 --> 06:20:01,360
Whoa!

4370
06:20:01,360 --> 06:20:03,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4371
06:20:03,360 --> 06:20:05,360
Whoa.

4372
06:20:05,360 --> 06:20:07,360
Hello, game?

4373
06:20:07,360 --> 06:20:09,360
Relax, relax.

4374
06:20:09,360 --> 06:20:11,360
Game.

4375
06:20:11,360 --> 06:20:13,360
I don't think...

4376
06:20:13,360 --> 06:20:15,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4377
06:20:15,360 --> 06:20:17,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4378
06:20:17,360 --> 06:20:19,360
Game?

4379
06:20:19,360 --> 06:20:21,360
What was that velocity?

4380
06:20:21,360 --> 06:20:23,360
It was completely unnecessary, are you sure?

4381
06:20:23,360 --> 06:20:25,360
Game, up, put me up.

4382
06:20:25,360 --> 06:20:27,360
Put me up, put me up, put me up.

4383
06:20:27,360 --> 06:20:29,360
I want uppies, so I can aim.

4384
06:20:29,360 --> 06:20:31,360
I missed.

4385
06:20:31,360 --> 06:20:33,360
Oh, whoa, I actually hit that.

4386
06:20:35,360 --> 06:20:37,360
Wow.

4387
06:20:37,360 --> 06:20:39,360
That was crazy.

4388
06:20:39,360 --> 06:20:41,360
I don't think I was supposed to fly that high.

4389
06:20:41,360 --> 06:20:43,360
That was insane.

4390
06:20:43,360 --> 06:20:45,360
Oops, played it out of order.

4391
06:20:45,360 --> 06:20:47,360
Where's this, a horse?

4392
06:20:47,360 --> 06:20:49,360
Okay, turn around.

4393
06:20:49,360 --> 06:20:51,360
Every now and then I get...

4394
06:20:51,360 --> 06:20:53,360
Oh, I was too early.

4395
06:20:53,360 --> 06:20:55,360
Maybe there then?

4396
06:20:55,360 --> 06:20:57,360
Yes.

4397
06:20:57,360 --> 06:20:59,360
Yeah. Okay, that wasn't bad.

4398
06:20:59,360 --> 06:21:01,360
That wasn't horrific.

4399
06:21:01,360 --> 06:21:03,360
Whoa.

4400
06:21:03,360 --> 06:21:05,360
That was a crazy boost.

4401
06:21:05,360 --> 06:21:07,360
I don't think I was supposed to go that high.

4402
06:21:07,360 --> 06:21:09,360
I think the game mathematics...

4403
06:21:09,360 --> 06:21:11,360
It's way...

4404
06:21:11,360 --> 06:21:13,360
I don't think I was supposed to go that high.

4405
06:21:15,360 --> 06:21:17,360
Okay.

4406
06:21:19,360 --> 06:21:21,360
Because cool guys don't look

4407
06:21:21,360 --> 06:21:23,360
back at explosions.

4408
06:21:23,360 --> 06:21:25,360
Well, we did it.

4409
06:21:25,360 --> 06:21:27,360
That was not easy.

4410
06:21:27,360 --> 06:21:29,360
That was not fast.

4411
06:21:29,360 --> 06:21:31,360
I am going to open it up in the DNA sequence

4412
06:21:31,360 --> 06:21:33,360
to see if it's like, replay that section.

4413
06:21:33,360 --> 06:21:35,360
If it is,

4414
06:21:35,360 --> 06:21:37,360
then 100% is still on board.

4415
06:21:37,360 --> 06:21:39,360
If it's not, then 100% is like a much less likely

4416
06:21:39,360 --> 06:21:41,360
because this is getting hard.

4417
06:21:41,360 --> 06:21:43,360
This is getting tricky.

4418
06:22:05,360 --> 06:22:07,360
The whole thing.

4419
06:22:07,360 --> 06:22:09,360
I was worried it would say that.

4420
06:22:13,360 --> 06:22:15,360
I was so worried it was going to say that.

4421
06:22:23,360 --> 06:22:25,360
Look, we'll do what we can.

4422
06:22:27,360 --> 06:22:29,360
We'll finish the other Leonardo missions

4423
06:22:29,360 --> 06:22:31,360
and that.

4424
06:22:31,360 --> 06:22:33,360
But yeah.

4425
06:22:33,360 --> 06:22:35,360
This is going to be...

4426
06:22:35,360 --> 06:22:37,360
I don't...

4427
06:22:37,360 --> 06:22:39,360
That has just like dramatically

4428
06:22:39,360 --> 06:22:41,360
decreased the odds of being able to

4429
06:22:41,360 --> 06:22:43,360
100% it.

4430
06:22:43,360 --> 06:22:45,360
To go through all of that section again,

4431
06:22:45,360 --> 06:22:47,360
I was taking my time poisoning guards

4432
06:22:47,360 --> 06:22:49,360
along the way so I didn't have any issues.

4433
06:22:51,360 --> 06:22:53,360
That one attempt

4434
06:22:53,360 --> 06:22:55,360
and we got hit immediately.

4435
06:22:55,360 --> 06:22:57,360
That was the only time we got hit as well

4436
06:22:57,360 --> 06:22:59,360
which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure

4437
06:22:59,360 --> 06:23:01,360
what the controls were.

4438
06:23:01,360 --> 06:23:03,360
That was so rough.

4439
06:23:03,360 --> 06:23:05,360
Come on, that hurts.

4440
06:23:05,360 --> 06:23:07,360
And that is why a late game gives more check.

4441
06:23:07,360 --> 06:23:09,360
Literally, that is so...

4442
06:23:11,360 --> 06:23:13,360
punishing.

4443
06:23:15,360 --> 06:23:17,360
Wait, can you 100% this game without being online?

4444
06:23:17,360 --> 06:23:19,360
Yes, the DNA sequence is what we're 100%

4445
06:23:19,360 --> 06:23:21,360
doing 100% of the memories and stuff.

4446
06:23:21,360 --> 06:23:23,360
I'm currently

4447
06:23:23,360 --> 06:23:25,360
63%

4448
06:23:25,360 --> 06:23:27,360
which isn't bad at all.

4449
06:23:27,360 --> 06:23:29,360
However,

4450
06:23:29,360 --> 06:23:31,360
I was under the assumption

4451
06:23:31,360 --> 06:23:33,360
the game was a bit more forgiving.

4452
06:23:33,360 --> 06:23:35,360
However, we've just kind of

4453
06:23:35,360 --> 06:23:37,360
discovered

4454
06:23:37,360 --> 06:23:39,360
the replayability checkpoints aren't

4455
06:23:39,360 --> 06:23:41,360
necessarily all there on certain

4456
06:23:41,360 --> 06:23:43,360
missions and

4457
06:23:43,360 --> 06:23:45,360
that is just so...

4458
06:23:45,360 --> 06:23:47,360
I don't know.

4459
06:23:47,360 --> 06:23:49,360
I don't know.

4460
06:23:49,360 --> 06:23:51,360
Let me see that.

4461
06:23:51,360 --> 06:23:53,360
Okay, go ahead.

4462
06:23:53,360 --> 06:23:55,360
Remember trying to

4463
06:23:55,360 --> 06:23:57,360
platinum the game.

4464
06:23:57,360 --> 06:23:59,360
Achieving wise...

4465
06:23:59,360 --> 06:24:01,360
I don't know if you need 100% DNA

4466
06:24:01,360 --> 06:24:03,360
for the achievements.

4467
06:24:03,360 --> 06:24:05,360
War machines

4468
06:24:05,360 --> 06:24:07,360
are infamous for a reason.

4469
06:24:07,360 --> 06:24:09,360
Yeah.

4470
06:24:09,360 --> 06:24:11,360
There's a difference between 100% and 100%

4471
06:24:11,360 --> 06:24:13,360
achievements.

4472
06:24:13,360 --> 06:24:15,360
So, yeah.

4473
06:24:15,360 --> 06:24:17,360
I thought we could maybe attempt

4474
06:24:17,360 --> 06:24:19,360
100% the DNA sequence

4475
06:24:19,360 --> 06:24:21,360
but, yeah.

4476
06:24:21,360 --> 06:24:23,360
It ain't looking good.

4477
06:24:23,360 --> 06:24:25,360
I mean, how long? Oh, it's already been 6 hours?

4478
06:24:25,360 --> 06:24:27,360
What the heck?

4479
06:24:27,360 --> 06:24:29,360
Okay.

4480
06:24:29,360 --> 06:24:31,360
Yeah, I didn't...

4481
06:24:31,360 --> 06:24:33,360
I thought I was only going to...

4482
06:24:33,360 --> 06:24:35,360
What was I supposed to do?

4483
06:24:35,360 --> 06:24:37,360
Use a kick attack against

4484
06:24:37,360 --> 06:24:39,360
the overseer. I

4485
06:24:39,360 --> 06:24:41,360
literally thought...

4486
06:24:41,360 --> 06:24:43,360
um...

4487
06:24:43,360 --> 06:24:45,360
If you don't do it in a movie,

4488
06:24:45,360 --> 06:24:47,360
this should be a thing you come back to

4489
06:24:47,360 --> 06:24:49,360
at a later time. I think so.

4490
06:24:49,360 --> 06:24:51,360
I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in a row

4491
06:24:51,360 --> 06:24:53,360
is a bit too much.

4492
06:24:53,360 --> 06:24:55,360
But I'm perfectly happy to

4493
06:24:55,360 --> 06:24:57,360
come across the save fail. That's not a problem.

4494
06:24:57,360 --> 06:24:59,360
What was I supposed to do? Kick him.

4495
06:25:07,360 --> 06:25:09,360
Oh, no.

4496
06:25:09,360 --> 06:25:11,360
No, we're not doing this.

4497
06:25:15,360 --> 06:25:17,360
We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone.

4498
06:25:17,360 --> 06:25:19,360
You're scaring me.

4499
06:25:25,360 --> 06:25:27,360
Whoa! I actually dodged that successfully.

4500
06:25:27,360 --> 06:25:29,360
But the game said no.

4501
06:25:29,360 --> 06:25:31,360
So...

4502
06:25:31,360 --> 06:25:33,360
Oh, there you go.

4503
06:25:33,360 --> 06:25:35,360
A true lover of this game with 100%...

4504
06:25:35,360 --> 06:25:37,360
Oh, steady on. Have you seen what the requirements are

4505
06:25:37,360 --> 06:25:39,360
on some of the missions?

4506
06:25:39,360 --> 06:25:41,360
Oh!

4507
06:25:41,360 --> 06:25:43,360
Is there a wee bit of a...

4508
06:25:43,360 --> 06:25:45,360
Is there a wee bit much for me, honestly?

4509
06:25:45,360 --> 06:25:47,360
Like, I love this game.

4510
06:25:47,360 --> 06:25:49,360
But, I think

4511
06:25:49,360 --> 06:25:51,360
definitely

4512
06:25:51,360 --> 06:25:53,360
wouldn't mind coming back to

4513
06:25:53,360 --> 06:25:55,360
it. But I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

4514
06:25:55,360 --> 06:25:57,360
in a row maybe ain't the choice.

4515
06:25:57,360 --> 06:25:59,360
We'll try Needy Streamer

4516
06:25:59,360 --> 06:26:01,360
and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow.

4517
06:26:01,360 --> 06:26:03,360
Which means I can

4518
06:26:03,360 --> 06:26:05,360
go get the

4519
06:26:05,360 --> 06:26:07,360
sweets that I'm using

4520
06:26:07,360 --> 06:26:09,360
for that hand cam stream. I need to, like, prepare

4521
06:26:09,360 --> 06:26:11,360
for it and saw.

4522
06:26:11,360 --> 06:26:13,360
I don't even know what to wear.

4523
06:26:13,360 --> 06:26:15,360
Hee hee. I'm actually gonna have to put clothes

4524
06:26:15,360 --> 06:26:17,360
on for one. See ya, pee.

4525
06:26:19,360 --> 06:26:21,360
I don't even know.

4526
06:26:21,360 --> 06:26:23,360
I don't even know what to wear.

4527
06:26:23,360 --> 06:26:25,360
And one achievement

4528
06:26:25,360 --> 06:26:27,360
requires you to reach level 50 in multiplayer.

4529
06:26:27,360 --> 06:26:29,360
Oh, yeah, no, no. Not those achievements,

4530
06:26:29,360 --> 06:26:31,360
like the DNA season.

4531
06:26:31,360 --> 06:26:33,360
I'll be girlin' up neek.

4532
06:26:33,360 --> 06:26:35,360
Pants, sewer, cry, mutually.

4533
06:26:35,360 --> 06:26:37,360
Have to is a

4534
06:26:37,360 --> 06:26:39,360
strong word.

4535
06:26:39,360 --> 06:26:41,360
I think I have to.

4536
06:26:41,360 --> 06:26:43,360
Open one of the first three games.

4537
06:26:43,360 --> 06:26:45,360
The Borgia have constructed a deadly

4538
06:26:45,360 --> 06:26:47,360
naval war machine based on Leonardo's design

4539
06:26:47,360 --> 06:26:49,360
and must be destroyed before

4540
06:26:49,360 --> 06:26:51,360
Chesery.

4541
06:26:51,360 --> 06:26:53,360
The jeans.

4542
06:26:53,360 --> 06:26:55,360
Talk to Eduardo.

4543
06:26:55,360 --> 06:26:57,360
Ed Uardo.

4544
06:26:57,360 --> 06:26:59,360
Ed Uardo.

4545
06:26:59,360 --> 06:27:01,360
I assume this is a don't get caught.

4546
06:27:01,360 --> 06:27:03,360
It's giving don't get caught.

4547
06:27:03,360 --> 06:27:05,360
Yeah.

4548
06:27:07,360 --> 06:27:09,360
I'm just a little fish.

4549
06:27:09,360 --> 06:27:11,360
Look, look, look.

4550
06:27:11,360 --> 06:27:13,360
No, I'm a fish.

4551
06:27:13,360 --> 06:27:15,360
You didn't see me.

4552
06:27:15,360 --> 06:27:17,360
I'm just a fish.

4553
06:27:17,360 --> 06:27:19,360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

4554
06:27:19,360 --> 06:27:21,360
Swimming in the deep canal.

4555
06:27:21,360 --> 06:27:23,360
Canal.

4556
06:27:23,360 --> 06:27:25,360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

4557
06:27:25,360 --> 06:27:27,360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

4558
06:27:27,360 --> 06:27:29,360
I'm excellent.

4559
06:27:29,360 --> 06:27:31,360
If you hold the block button with the

4560
06:27:31,360 --> 06:27:33,360
floor ball and the horse coming out,

4561
06:27:33,360 --> 06:27:35,360
you can knock the raider down.

4562
06:27:35,360 --> 06:27:37,360
Oh, it says gasman prayer.

4563
06:27:37,360 --> 06:27:39,360
Me, through, through.

4564
06:27:39,360 --> 06:27:41,360
E.

4565
06:27:41,360 --> 06:27:43,360
Clothes strong.

4566
06:27:43,360 --> 06:27:45,360
I have six.

4567
06:27:45,360 --> 06:27:47,360
Oh.

4568
06:27:49,360 --> 06:27:51,360
Baby.

4569
06:27:51,360 --> 06:27:53,360
It's you.

4570
06:27:53,360 --> 06:27:55,360
Hello.

4571
06:27:55,360 --> 06:27:57,360
I would like you to take me on the canal.

4572
06:27:57,360 --> 06:27:59,360
Oh.

4573
06:27:59,360 --> 06:28:01,360
You are the assassin, am I right?

4574
06:28:01,360 --> 06:28:03,360
You must stop Chesery.

4575
06:28:03,360 --> 06:28:05,360
I will help you.

4576
06:28:05,360 --> 06:28:07,360
Let me take you to them.

4577
06:28:07,360 --> 06:28:09,360
Oh.

4578
06:28:09,360 --> 06:28:11,360
Like I said, I chose life today.

4579
06:28:11,360 --> 06:28:13,360
Thank you.

4580
06:28:15,360 --> 06:28:17,360
Uh.

4581
06:28:17,360 --> 06:28:19,360
Interacting with the gondola

4582
06:28:19,360 --> 06:28:21,360
will cause desynchronization.

4583
06:28:23,360 --> 06:28:25,360
I scratch my nose.

4584
06:28:27,360 --> 06:28:29,360
How tall are you?

4585
06:28:29,360 --> 06:28:31,360
162 centimeters.

4586
06:28:31,360 --> 06:28:33,360
Um.

4587
06:28:33,360 --> 06:28:35,360
Taller than

4588
06:28:35,360 --> 06:28:37,360
smoke bomb

4589
06:28:37,360 --> 06:28:39,360
disables guards. Assassin or sleep

4590
06:28:39,360 --> 06:28:41,360
fort wears off.

4591
06:28:41,360 --> 06:28:43,360
Um.

4592
06:28:43,360 --> 06:28:45,360
Excuse me.

4593
06:28:45,360 --> 06:28:47,360
Am I not allowed to kill?

4594
06:28:47,360 --> 06:28:49,360
No, I am.

4595
06:28:49,360 --> 06:28:51,360
So why not?

4596
06:28:55,360 --> 06:28:57,360
Uh, the gate.

4597
06:28:57,360 --> 06:28:59,360
What am I supposed to do here?

4598
06:28:59,360 --> 06:29:01,360
Nothing.

4599
06:29:01,360 --> 06:29:03,360
Oh, he just jumped on. I saw that.

4600
06:29:03,360 --> 06:29:05,360
I thought I saw that.

4601
06:29:07,360 --> 06:29:09,360
Oh.

4602
06:29:09,360 --> 06:29:11,360
Uh.

4603
06:29:11,360 --> 06:29:13,360
Okay.

4604
06:29:13,360 --> 06:29:15,360
Okay, okay, we're getting it.

4605
06:29:15,360 --> 06:29:17,360
Taller than a smoke bomb.

4606
06:29:17,360 --> 06:29:19,360
What's that?

4607
06:29:19,360 --> 06:29:21,360
Banana or freedom? Uh, 5-3?

4608
06:29:25,360 --> 06:29:27,360
I've not played Assassin's

4609
06:29:27,360 --> 06:29:29,360
orgy, no.

4610
06:29:29,360 --> 06:29:31,360
You're like me, also.

4611
06:29:31,360 --> 06:29:33,360
It's just a weird class.

4612
06:29:33,360 --> 06:29:35,360
It's just no flood me.

4613
06:29:35,360 --> 06:29:37,360
Okay, something's a flood.

4614
06:29:37,360 --> 06:29:39,360
I'm so sorry.

4615
06:29:39,360 --> 06:29:41,360
I just pushed that man in the water

4616
06:29:41,360 --> 06:29:43,360
and he drowned. I will say one thing though.

4617
06:29:43,360 --> 06:29:45,360
If you're a gondola pusher

4618
06:29:45,360 --> 06:29:47,360
and you don't know how to swim, isn't that

4619
06:29:47,360 --> 06:29:49,360
a bit dangerous?

4620
06:29:49,360 --> 06:29:51,360
Isn't that a bit silly?

4621
06:29:53,360 --> 06:29:55,360
I didn't even realize I was supposed to be up here, also.

4622
06:29:59,360 --> 06:30:01,360
Whoa, wait, why can he see me?

4623
06:30:01,360 --> 06:30:03,360
I thought we'd purposely put these beams here

4624
06:30:03,360 --> 06:30:05,360
so you can't get seen by the guards below.

4625
06:30:07,360 --> 06:30:09,360
Hmm.

4626
06:30:09,360 --> 06:30:11,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4627
06:30:11,360 --> 06:30:13,360
My pard in my bag.

4628
06:30:15,360 --> 06:30:17,360
Look at that. Just so you know.

4629
06:30:17,360 --> 06:30:19,360
Where is it?

4630
06:30:19,360 --> 06:30:21,360
Oh.

4631
06:30:21,360 --> 06:30:23,360
Pitching him wasn't the problem.

4632
06:30:23,360 --> 06:30:25,360
It was like you touched the boat.

4633
06:30:25,360 --> 06:30:27,360
I can't believe it. Fending Nemo?

4634
06:30:27,360 --> 06:30:29,360
I touched the boat.

4635
06:30:31,360 --> 06:30:33,360
How many slower, mate?

4636
06:30:37,360 --> 06:30:39,360
Okay.

4637
06:30:41,360 --> 06:30:43,360
Okay.

4638
06:30:43,360 --> 06:30:45,360
Are you coming?

4639
06:30:57,360 --> 06:30:59,360
The frickin' twat

4640
06:30:59,360 --> 06:31:01,360
from across the street saw me.

4641
06:31:03,360 --> 06:31:05,360
Yeah, you do that all the way again.

4642
06:31:05,360 --> 06:31:07,360
You'd be surprised.

4643
06:31:07,360 --> 06:31:09,360
I was in the Navy and it only passed the swim test

4644
06:31:09,360 --> 06:31:11,360
because the

4645
06:31:11,360 --> 06:31:13,360
Proctor wanted me to go home.

4646
06:31:13,360 --> 06:31:15,360
Jeez.

4647
06:31:19,360 --> 06:31:21,360
I think if you're Scottish, you have to learn to swim.

4648
06:31:21,360 --> 06:31:23,360
You're forced to go swimming.

4649
06:31:23,360 --> 06:31:25,360
Let's just run ahead of this guard

4650
06:31:25,360 --> 06:31:27,360
because he can't see me at the corner of his eye.

4651
06:31:27,360 --> 06:31:29,360
But I get out of range,

4652
06:31:29,360 --> 06:31:31,360
which is good.

4653
06:31:31,360 --> 06:31:33,360
Gondola logging.

4654
06:31:33,360 --> 06:31:35,360
I've only got five poisons.

4655
06:31:37,360 --> 06:31:39,360
I could probably just

4656
06:31:39,360 --> 06:31:41,360
do that, man.

4657
06:31:41,360 --> 06:31:43,360
I've got 19 crossbow bolts.

4658
06:31:43,360 --> 06:31:45,360
They're quiet. I don't get it.

4659
06:31:45,360 --> 06:31:47,360
So it's all good.

4660
06:31:55,360 --> 06:31:57,360
That's fine.

4661
06:31:57,360 --> 06:31:59,360
That's fine.

4662
06:31:59,360 --> 06:32:01,360
So who?

4663
06:32:07,360 --> 06:32:09,360
Okay, so this time the frickin' guy doesn't notice me?

4664
06:32:09,360 --> 06:32:11,360
Yeah, that's what I thought, mate.

4665
06:32:11,360 --> 06:32:13,360
I'm such a wee liar, honestly.

4666
06:32:17,360 --> 06:32:19,360
He doesn't even spot me this time.

4667
06:32:19,360 --> 06:32:21,360
Sting.

4668
06:32:29,360 --> 06:32:31,360
I'm set to Scotland.

4669
06:32:31,360 --> 06:32:33,360
We've got school soon enough.

4670
06:32:35,360 --> 06:32:37,360
Oh, I need to go up.

4671
06:32:43,360 --> 06:32:45,360
So you're going to see me?

4672
06:32:45,360 --> 06:32:47,360
He is, so I kind of need to deal with you.

4673
06:32:47,360 --> 06:32:49,360
Sorry, but you're in my way, son.

4674
06:32:49,360 --> 06:32:51,360
You're in my way.

4675
06:32:51,360 --> 06:32:53,360
You're in my way.

4676
06:32:59,360 --> 06:33:01,360
You're in my way.

4677
06:33:07,360 --> 06:33:09,360
Poison, huh?

4678
06:33:09,360 --> 06:33:11,360
Just to get around the corner successfully.

4679
06:33:11,360 --> 06:33:13,360
The Bluetooth device is...

4680
06:33:13,360 --> 06:33:15,360
Why did you not go up?

4681
06:33:15,360 --> 06:33:17,360
Go up.

4682
06:33:17,360 --> 06:33:19,360
Go up and along.

4683
06:33:19,360 --> 06:33:21,360
There we go.

4684
06:33:21,360 --> 06:33:23,360
Much better.

4685
06:33:23,360 --> 06:33:25,360
How's your gaming going?

4686
06:33:25,360 --> 06:33:27,360
We MLG gamers out here.

4687
06:33:27,360 --> 06:33:29,360
Unfortunately,

4688
06:33:31,360 --> 06:33:33,360
I believe the 100%

4689
06:33:33,360 --> 06:33:35,360
will not happen this stream.

4690
06:33:37,360 --> 06:33:39,360
I did not anticipate

4691
06:33:41,360 --> 06:33:43,360
how hard this game is.

4692
06:33:43,360 --> 06:33:45,360
Because I've never attempted it before.

4693
06:33:45,360 --> 06:33:47,360
I genuinely don't know how it goes.

4694
06:33:47,360 --> 06:33:49,360
Right, I'm going to poison him and the other...

4695
06:33:51,360 --> 06:33:53,360
Eh?

4696
06:33:53,360 --> 06:33:55,360
Eh?

4697
06:33:57,360 --> 06:33:59,360
I almost deseed,

4698
06:33:59,360 --> 06:34:01,360
but I think I hit a checkpoint.

4699
06:34:03,360 --> 06:34:05,360
I didn't...

4700
06:34:07,360 --> 06:34:09,360
I'm going to show you now.

4701
06:34:09,360 --> 06:34:11,360
I don't even know how you saw me.

4702
06:34:11,360 --> 06:34:13,360
I'm up here.

4703
06:34:13,360 --> 06:34:15,360
They're not supposed to be able to see you from up here.

4704
06:34:19,360 --> 06:34:21,360
Yeah, like that guy really...

4705
06:34:21,360 --> 06:34:23,360
There's like more to go.

4706
06:34:23,360 --> 06:34:25,360
Oh, that...

4707
06:34:25,360 --> 06:34:27,360
Get me in the war!

4708
06:34:27,360 --> 06:34:29,360
No!

4709
06:34:37,360 --> 06:34:39,360
I like that.

4710
06:34:41,360 --> 06:34:43,360
That's a pretty good detail, huh?

4711
06:34:43,360 --> 06:34:45,360
No...

4712
06:34:45,360 --> 06:34:47,360
No...

4713
06:34:47,360 --> 06:34:49,360
It seems literally drowning right now.

4714
06:34:49,360 --> 06:34:51,360
He needs to catch a breath of

4715
06:34:51,360 --> 06:34:53,360
frickin' air.

4716
06:34:53,360 --> 06:34:55,360
Making him go under.

4717
06:34:55,360 --> 06:34:57,360
Oh, goodness me.

4718
06:34:57,360 --> 06:34:59,360
I don't know what to make of that.

4719
06:34:59,360 --> 06:35:01,360
Oh, goodness me.

4720
06:35:01,360 --> 06:35:03,360
They're not making this one easy, are they?

4721
06:35:07,360 --> 06:35:09,360
Oh, my goodness.

4722
06:35:11,360 --> 06:35:13,360
He took his sword out.

4723
06:35:13,360 --> 06:35:15,360
I heard it, but he needs to breathe

4724
06:35:15,360 --> 06:35:17,360
or else he pops up for too long!

4725
06:35:17,360 --> 06:35:19,360
He needs to breathe.

4726
06:35:19,360 --> 06:35:21,360
I need to breathe just thinking

4727
06:35:21,360 --> 06:35:23,360
about how long he's holding his breath, honestly.

4728
06:35:25,360 --> 06:35:27,360
Please don't do that animation

4729
06:35:27,360 --> 06:35:29,360
where you can't breathe.

4730
06:35:31,360 --> 06:35:33,360
We did it.

4731
06:35:33,360 --> 06:35:35,360
Oh, for goodness sake, there's more!

4732
06:35:43,360 --> 06:35:45,360
Breathe, exhale, breathe.

4733
06:35:45,360 --> 06:35:47,360
Oh!

4734
06:35:47,360 --> 06:35:49,360
Well done!

4735
06:35:49,360 --> 06:35:53,360
One, two, three...

4736
06:35:53,360 --> 06:35:55,360
One!

4737
06:35:55,360 --> 06:35:57,360
Okay, I think maybe I can

4738
06:35:57,360 --> 06:35:59,360
kill those ones

4739
06:35:59,360 --> 06:36:01,360
because that was really rough, right?

4740
06:36:01,360 --> 06:36:03,360
See, that was too much breath holding.

4741
06:36:03,360 --> 06:36:05,360
Any breathers in chat?

4742
06:36:05,360 --> 06:36:07,360
We stayed around.

4743
06:36:07,360 --> 06:36:09,360
Mm-hmm.

4744
06:36:09,360 --> 06:36:11,360
I'm going to Scotland in 2D.

4745
06:36:11,360 --> 06:36:13,360
Whoa, wait, how far back are we?

4746
06:36:15,360 --> 06:36:17,360
Huh.

4747
06:36:17,360 --> 06:36:19,360
That's pretty far back.

4748
06:36:23,360 --> 06:36:25,360
Okay, that guy doesn't care.

4749
06:36:25,360 --> 06:36:27,360
Oh!

4750
06:36:27,360 --> 06:36:29,360
I've just wasted so much time

4751
06:36:29,360 --> 06:36:31,360
dropping myself back here, but who...

4752
06:36:31,360 --> 06:36:33,360
Breathing is overrated, honestly.

4753
06:36:37,360 --> 06:36:39,360
I know the game's telling me to swim under this,

4754
06:36:39,360 --> 06:36:41,360
but, like, it takes so much freaking time.

4755
06:36:41,360 --> 06:36:43,360
Like, that guy is going so fast

4756
06:36:43,360 --> 06:36:45,360
in his wee gondola.

4757
06:36:45,360 --> 06:36:47,360
Like, he knows that I'm literally trying

4758
06:36:47,360 --> 06:36:49,360
to swim behind him in time.

4759
06:36:49,360 --> 06:36:51,360
He's such a lot, like...

4760
06:36:51,360 --> 06:36:53,360
You know I'm freaking behind you.

4761
06:36:53,360 --> 06:36:55,360
Slow it down!

4762
06:36:57,360 --> 06:36:59,360
Literally, I'm trying to, like, silently swim.

4763
06:36:59,360 --> 06:37:01,360
It's not even possible.

4764
06:37:05,360 --> 06:37:07,360
I think if I just hang off

4765
06:37:07,360 --> 06:37:09,360
the pier and assassinate him,

4766
06:37:09,360 --> 06:37:11,360
this is the best way forward for this.

4767
06:37:11,360 --> 06:37:13,360
Sorry, mate, but time's up.

4768
06:37:15,360 --> 06:37:17,360
Okay, yeah, that is far more easier.

4769
06:37:17,360 --> 06:37:19,360
I just need to do it to the other guy on the pier.

4770
06:37:19,360 --> 06:37:21,360
Sorry!

4771
06:37:23,360 --> 06:37:25,360
Oxygen addicts, honestly.

4772
06:37:25,360 --> 06:37:27,360
Can't get enough of it.

4773
06:37:27,360 --> 06:37:29,360
You're so greedy, huh?

4774
06:37:29,360 --> 06:37:31,360
So greedy for more...

4775
06:37:31,360 --> 06:37:33,360
more oxygen.

4776
06:37:35,360 --> 06:37:37,360
Okay, let's dive.

4777
06:37:37,360 --> 06:37:39,360
And then breathe.

4778
06:37:39,360 --> 06:37:41,360
And then dive.

4779
06:37:41,360 --> 06:37:43,360
And then breathe.

4780
06:37:43,360 --> 06:37:45,360
And then yank.

4781
06:37:45,360 --> 06:37:47,360
Ezio, please do not go on the platform

4782
06:37:47,360 --> 06:37:49,360
when it comes to assassinating...

4783
06:37:49,360 --> 06:37:51,360
freaking gods!

4784
06:37:53,360 --> 06:37:55,360
Ezio.

4785
06:37:55,360 --> 06:37:57,360
You knew!

4786
06:37:57,360 --> 06:37:59,360
Fine well. I was asking you to pull him

4787
06:37:59,360 --> 06:38:01,360
into the water.

4788
06:38:01,360 --> 06:38:03,360
Not get on the platform

4789
06:38:03,360 --> 06:38:05,360
where the freaking AI

4790
06:38:05,360 --> 06:38:07,360
is so sensitive

4791
06:38:07,360 --> 06:38:09,360
and on the lookout

4792
06:38:09,360 --> 06:38:11,360
on freaking...

4793
06:38:11,360 --> 06:38:13,360
YOU FREAKING FREAKS!

4794
06:38:13,360 --> 06:38:15,360
Right, I'm just a serious

4795
06:38:15,360 --> 06:38:17,360
assassinating spam, honestly.

4796
06:38:17,360 --> 06:38:19,360
Game knows... oh, and he's gonna

4797
06:38:19,360 --> 06:38:21,360
fuck you.

4798
06:38:25,360 --> 06:38:27,360
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

4799
06:38:27,360 --> 06:38:29,360
And I'm out of honey tea

4800
06:38:29,360 --> 06:38:31,360
and I'm sad that I can't have

4801
06:38:31,360 --> 06:38:33,360
a freaking honey tube.

4802
06:38:33,360 --> 06:38:35,360
Gonna have to go to the shops.

4803
06:38:37,360 --> 06:38:39,360
Okay.

4804
06:38:41,360 --> 06:38:43,360
Right, I can take my time to this segment.

4805
06:38:43,360 --> 06:38:45,360
I've never been caught at it yet

4806
06:38:45,360 --> 06:38:47,360
so let's not go caught now.

4807
06:38:47,360 --> 06:38:49,360
We swimming!

4808
06:38:49,360 --> 06:38:51,360
Any swimmers?

4809
06:38:51,360 --> 06:38:53,360
You got any swimmers for me?

4810
06:38:53,360 --> 06:38:55,360
Shopping.

4811
06:38:55,360 --> 06:38:57,360
That's how it is, just that, honestly.

4812
06:38:57,360 --> 06:38:59,360
I feel like if I fast swim

4813
06:38:59,360 --> 06:39:01,360
I might alert him.

4814
06:39:01,360 --> 06:39:03,360
Now, if I am correct

4815
06:39:03,360 --> 06:39:05,360
what the problem was

4816
06:39:05,360 --> 06:39:07,360
is that I assassinated here.

4817
06:39:07,360 --> 06:39:09,360
I need to hang off and then assassinate.

4818
06:39:09,360 --> 06:39:11,360
Yeah!

4819
06:39:11,360 --> 06:39:13,360
But you knew exactly what I wanted to

4820
06:39:13,360 --> 06:39:15,360
achieve, so don't even look at me, okay?

4821
06:39:15,360 --> 06:39:17,360
Don't interact with the gondola.

4822
06:39:17,360 --> 06:39:19,360
Me swimmers!

4823
06:39:19,360 --> 06:39:21,360
My story.

4824
06:39:23,360 --> 06:39:25,360
Alright, let's...

4825
06:39:25,360 --> 06:39:27,360
Okay.

4826
06:39:33,360 --> 06:39:35,360
Why is he gulping?

4827
06:39:35,360 --> 06:39:37,360
I'm not even diving in.

4828
06:39:37,360 --> 06:39:39,360
Okay.

4829
06:39:39,360 --> 06:39:41,360
Hang off the ledge, please.

4830
06:39:41,360 --> 06:39:43,360
One assassination, please.

4831
06:39:43,360 --> 06:39:45,360
Back in the war.

4832
06:39:45,360 --> 06:39:47,360
Dive.

4833
06:39:47,360 --> 06:39:49,360
Dive over the ropes.

4834
06:39:49,360 --> 06:39:51,360
Don't be afraid.

4835
06:39:51,360 --> 06:39:53,360
Don't be afraid of the ropes.

4836
06:39:53,360 --> 06:39:55,360
That was very talented.

4837
06:40:09,360 --> 06:40:11,360
My life flash before my...

4838
06:40:11,360 --> 06:40:13,360
Someone say ropes.

4839
06:40:13,360 --> 06:40:15,360
She's still alive.

4840
06:40:15,360 --> 06:40:17,360
Especially not past that drunk.

4841
06:40:17,360 --> 06:40:19,360
I don't know if you're drunk.

4842
06:40:19,360 --> 06:40:21,360
I was not supposed to...

4843
06:40:21,360 --> 06:40:23,360
That's all I want to see, baby.

4844
06:40:25,360 --> 06:40:27,360
Okay, there we go.

4845
06:40:29,360 --> 06:40:31,360
Detection is now permitted.

4846
06:40:31,360 --> 06:40:33,360
Yee-haw!

4847
06:40:33,360 --> 06:40:35,360
Time to perish, boys!

4848
06:40:39,360 --> 06:40:41,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want some of this?

4849
06:40:43,360 --> 06:40:45,360
I kicked it.

4850
06:40:45,360 --> 06:40:47,360
Actually, I need to disarm guards

4851
06:40:47,360 --> 06:40:49,360
and kill them with their own weapon.

4852
06:40:49,360 --> 06:40:51,360
Let's do that.

4853
06:40:51,360 --> 06:40:53,360
Give me that sword, please.

4854
06:40:53,360 --> 06:40:55,360
Yee, thank you very much.

4855
06:40:55,360 --> 06:40:57,360
Drop object.

4856
06:40:57,360 --> 06:40:59,360
And then we're going to do it again.

4857
06:40:59,360 --> 06:41:01,360
Can I steal your weapon?

4858
06:41:01,360 --> 06:41:03,360
Oh, it's not fighting over the weapon.

4859
06:41:03,360 --> 06:41:05,360
Okay, there we go.

4860
06:41:05,360 --> 06:41:07,360
He wouldn't go over it, honestly.

4861
06:41:07,360 --> 06:41:09,360
I wouldn't go my weapon to if I had one.

4862
06:41:09,360 --> 06:41:11,360
Now I'm chilling, cleaning up and watching

4863
06:41:11,360 --> 06:41:13,360
because I love these people.

4864
06:41:13,360 --> 06:41:15,360
Azura said she played it as well.

4865
06:41:15,360 --> 06:41:17,360
Emmy said she got it as gifted,

4866
06:41:17,360 --> 06:41:19,360
but she never played it.

4867
06:41:21,360 --> 06:41:23,360
Good night.

4868
06:41:23,360 --> 06:41:25,360
Those who rest, thank you for hanging in.

4869
06:41:29,360 --> 06:41:31,360
I love when I can be detected.

4870
06:41:31,360 --> 06:41:33,360
It's so fun.

4871
06:41:35,360 --> 06:41:37,360
Come on, who wants to first, then?

4872
06:41:39,360 --> 06:41:41,360
Okay, there you go.

4873
06:41:41,360 --> 06:41:43,360
Oh, no, don't grab me. Who wants to first?

4874
06:41:43,360 --> 06:41:45,360
You!

4875
06:41:47,360 --> 06:41:49,360
Ugh!

4876
06:41:49,360 --> 06:41:51,360
Take that.

4877
06:41:51,360 --> 06:41:53,360
And this!

4878
06:41:53,360 --> 06:41:55,360
And you're another one!

4879
06:41:55,360 --> 06:41:57,360
I love the crisscross kill.

4880
06:41:57,360 --> 06:41:59,360
It's so cool.

4881
06:41:59,360 --> 06:42:01,360
Oh, wait, I'm actually going to loot because those were pretty high.

4882
06:42:01,360 --> 06:42:03,360
Guard.

4883
06:42:07,360 --> 06:42:09,360
These guys act like they understand you're the main character

4884
06:42:09,360 --> 06:42:11,360
on a flittle.

4885
06:42:17,360 --> 06:42:19,360
Okay.

4886
06:42:19,360 --> 06:42:21,360
I thought I got more poison holdings.

4887
06:42:33,360 --> 06:42:35,360
Once we've done other Leonardo missions,

4888
06:42:35,360 --> 06:42:37,360
I think we'll do all of the factions

4889
06:42:37,360 --> 06:42:39,360
because I want to dress up my Assassin's Creed guild.

4890
06:42:43,360 --> 06:42:45,360
So it's girly pop, you know what I'm saying?

4891
06:42:47,360 --> 06:42:49,360
How do I get up there?

4892
06:42:49,360 --> 06:42:51,360
Or do I just leap?

4893
06:42:51,360 --> 06:42:53,360
Do I do a leap?

4894
06:42:53,360 --> 06:42:55,360
Oh, that was a big leap.

4895
06:42:55,360 --> 06:42:57,360
I don't think you should have been able to do that.

4896
06:42:57,360 --> 06:42:59,360
Hey, ho.

4897
06:42:59,360 --> 06:43:01,360
You can't see me because you're dead by the time

4898
06:43:01,360 --> 06:43:03,360
you process it. It's me!

4899
06:43:03,360 --> 06:43:05,360
Daddy's home!

4900
06:43:05,360 --> 06:43:07,360
Let's loot.

4901
06:43:07,360 --> 06:43:09,360
He may have poison on him.

4902
06:43:11,360 --> 06:43:13,360
They accepted that.

4903
06:43:17,360 --> 06:43:19,360
I'm going to go see you in the morning.

4904
06:43:19,360 --> 06:43:21,360
Oh, that's hilarious.

4905
06:43:21,360 --> 06:43:23,360
I'm focusing on that now.

4906
06:43:23,360 --> 06:43:25,360
Literally, good night. See you in the morning.

4907
06:43:25,360 --> 06:43:27,360
I'll still be online. Sweet dreams.

4908
06:43:27,360 --> 06:43:29,360
Have a good rest.

4909
06:43:29,360 --> 06:43:31,360
I'll still be here on Assassin's Creed on my knees.

4910
06:43:35,360 --> 06:43:37,360
Daddy's home.

4911
06:43:39,360 --> 06:43:41,360
They're more like guidelines than actual rules.

4912
06:43:47,360 --> 06:43:49,360
Oh, I do love this game.

4913
06:43:53,360 --> 06:43:55,360
That reason I did go watch

4914
06:43:55,360 --> 06:43:57,360
and get him out of it alive.

4915
06:44:09,360 --> 06:44:11,360
What's this?

4916
06:44:13,360 --> 06:44:15,360
What a switch.

4917
06:44:17,360 --> 06:44:19,360
Wow, I have to switch between rowing

4918
06:44:19,360 --> 06:44:21,360
and aiming.

4919
06:44:21,360 --> 06:44:23,360
I mean, I guess I comprehend that.

4920
06:44:23,360 --> 06:44:25,360
But, sheesh.

4921
06:44:25,360 --> 06:44:27,360
Oh, we're taking down ships!

4922
06:44:29,360 --> 06:44:31,360
Boo Templars.

4923
06:44:31,360 --> 06:44:33,360
Stinky Templars.

4924
06:44:33,360 --> 06:44:35,360
Switch, fire!

4925
06:44:35,360 --> 06:44:37,360
Oh my gosh, that's so cool.

4926
06:44:37,360 --> 06:44:39,360
Okay, sales destroyed.

4927
06:44:39,360 --> 06:44:41,360
That makes sense.

4928
06:44:41,360 --> 06:44:43,360
Won that one?

4929
06:44:43,360 --> 06:44:45,360
I only hit one of them there.

4930
06:44:45,360 --> 06:44:47,360
I'm getting wrecked right now.

4931
06:44:49,360 --> 06:44:51,360
All done.

4932
06:44:51,360 --> 06:44:53,360
Bye-bye!

4933
06:44:53,360 --> 06:44:55,360
Okay, okay, I like it. I'm digging it.

4934
06:44:55,360 --> 06:44:57,360
I'm digging it.

4935
06:44:57,360 --> 06:44:59,360
Oh my gosh!

4936
06:44:59,360 --> 06:45:01,360
They're like ragdolling off the ship.

4937
06:45:03,360 --> 06:45:05,360
Okay, that was cool.

4938
06:45:05,360 --> 06:45:07,360
I enjoyed that.

4939
06:45:07,360 --> 06:45:09,360
Yo ho ho.

4940
06:45:09,360 --> 06:45:11,360
It's a pirate's life for me.

4941
06:45:11,360 --> 06:45:13,360
A tweedalidum.

4942
06:45:13,360 --> 06:45:15,360
A tweedalidum.

4943
06:45:15,360 --> 06:45:17,360
Tweedalidiliwi.

4944
06:45:17,360 --> 06:45:19,360
I don't know the words. I just know the shanty.

4945
06:45:19,360 --> 06:45:21,360
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho!

4946
06:45:25,360 --> 06:45:27,360
Okay, it looks like there's just three.

4947
06:45:27,360 --> 06:45:31,360
And I have plenty of health, so that's fine.

4948
06:45:33,360 --> 06:45:35,360
Give me fuel in my fire.

4949
06:45:35,360 --> 06:45:37,360
Give me burning.

4950
06:45:37,360 --> 06:45:39,360
Put some oil in my land.

4951
06:45:39,360 --> 06:45:41,360
Eye free.

4952
06:45:41,360 --> 06:45:43,360
Okay.

4953
06:45:43,360 --> 06:45:45,360
Can I do it from here?

4954
06:45:47,360 --> 06:45:49,360
Possibly.

4955
06:45:49,360 --> 06:45:51,360
Can I do all three though?

4956
06:45:53,360 --> 06:45:55,360
I think I'm gonna have to go a bit closer to this one.

4957
06:45:55,360 --> 06:45:57,360
At the back here.

4958
06:45:57,360 --> 06:45:59,360
I think that's it.

4959
06:45:59,360 --> 06:46:01,360
That should be good.

4960
06:46:01,360 --> 06:46:03,360
No? I didn't hit it?

4961
06:46:03,360 --> 06:46:05,360
Oopsies.

4962
06:46:05,360 --> 06:46:07,360
Okay, there we go.

4963
06:46:23,360 --> 06:46:25,360
I don't think you can go back through,

4964
06:46:25,360 --> 06:46:27,360
so we're just gonna...

4965
06:46:27,360 --> 06:46:29,360
do our thing.

4966
06:46:31,360 --> 06:46:33,360
You are now notorious,

4967
06:46:33,360 --> 06:46:35,360
for throwing high alert.

4968
06:46:35,360 --> 06:46:37,360
I should hope so.

4969
06:46:37,360 --> 06:46:39,360
Because I'm still here.

4970
06:46:39,360 --> 06:46:41,360
Oh, they knocked me off my gun.

4971
06:46:41,360 --> 06:46:43,360
I don't even know what to do about it.

4972
06:46:43,360 --> 06:46:45,360
Hold on, lads. I need to rotate before I destroy his.

4973
06:46:45,360 --> 06:46:47,360
Dude, give me a second.

4974
06:46:47,360 --> 06:46:49,360
We just need to rotate.

4975
06:46:49,360 --> 06:46:51,360
I actually don't think I can hit it from this distance.

4976
06:46:51,360 --> 06:46:53,360
You know that?

4977
06:46:53,360 --> 06:46:55,360
Ow, I'm...

4978
06:46:55,360 --> 06:46:57,360
Wait, whoa, what's happening?

4979
06:46:57,360 --> 06:46:59,360
Okay, hold on.

4980
06:46:59,360 --> 06:47:01,360
Hold on. We need to do a big old circle around.

4981
06:47:01,360 --> 06:47:03,360
Cause...

4982
06:47:03,360 --> 06:47:05,360
I'm like...

4983
06:47:05,360 --> 06:47:07,360
too close.

4984
06:47:07,360 --> 06:47:09,360
To even hit this stuff.

4985
06:47:11,360 --> 06:47:13,360
Honestly, black flag will take through.

4986
06:47:19,360 --> 06:47:21,360
Going reverse is so slow.

4987
06:47:21,360 --> 06:47:23,360
Can you go backwards?

4988
06:47:23,360 --> 06:47:25,360
I don't even know if you can.

4989
06:47:25,360 --> 06:47:27,360
I'll try. We're just in the old spin around.

4990
06:47:27,360 --> 06:47:29,360
Did that hit?

4991
06:47:29,360 --> 06:47:31,360
I hope so.

4992
06:47:33,360 --> 06:47:35,360
Almost.

4993
06:47:35,360 --> 06:47:37,360
There we go. Beautiful, beautiful.

4994
06:47:37,360 --> 06:47:39,360
And last but not least,

4995
06:47:39,360 --> 06:47:41,360
let's not get too close now.

4996
06:47:41,360 --> 06:47:43,360
Let's not get too close.

4997
06:47:43,360 --> 06:47:45,360
We've still got some momentum.

4998
06:47:49,360 --> 06:47:51,360
One more roll should do it.

4999
06:47:51,360 --> 06:47:53,360
Get us front row seats to this pirate ship going down.

5000
06:47:57,360 --> 06:47:59,360
Oh.

5001
06:47:59,360 --> 06:48:01,360
Ow, ow, ow. They're hurting me.

5002
06:48:01,360 --> 06:48:03,360
They're hurting me.

5003
06:48:05,360 --> 06:48:07,360
Just out of range. Hold on.

5004
06:48:09,360 --> 06:48:11,360
I'm like just there and no more.

5005
06:48:11,360 --> 06:48:13,360
Ow, you guys are hurting me.

5006
06:48:13,360 --> 06:48:15,360
You're giving me a booboo.

5007
06:48:19,360 --> 06:48:21,360
Just out of range.

5008
06:48:21,360 --> 06:48:23,360
That was so close.

5009
06:48:23,360 --> 06:48:25,360
A little bit of a push.

5010
06:48:25,360 --> 06:48:27,360
Get too close to the point where I can't even fucking aim.

5011
06:48:29,360 --> 06:48:31,360
There we go.

5012
06:48:31,360 --> 06:48:33,360
We got it.

5013
06:48:33,360 --> 06:48:35,360
It literally is your tank in all the arrows.

5014
06:48:35,360 --> 06:48:37,360
That was kind of comedic

5015
06:48:37,360 --> 06:48:39,360
the way they jumped off the ship.

5016
06:48:43,360 --> 06:48:45,360
How are they not lunch on you?

5017
06:48:45,360 --> 06:48:47,360
Honestly, there's literally cannonballs.

5018
06:48:49,360 --> 06:48:51,360
Literally BRB.

5019
06:48:51,360 --> 06:48:53,360
Sorry, I can't aim at your shields. Let me just do a little spin around.

5020
06:48:53,360 --> 06:48:55,360
Ooh.

5021
06:48:55,360 --> 06:48:57,360
Oh, we're shooting at itself.

5022
06:49:01,360 --> 06:49:03,360
Wow.

5023
06:49:09,360 --> 06:49:11,360
Splish splash.

5024
06:49:11,360 --> 06:49:13,360
I was ticking fast.

5025
06:49:13,360 --> 06:49:15,360
Oh, we actually got 100% sync for that.

5026
06:49:15,360 --> 06:49:17,360
Okay, I'll take it.

5027
06:49:19,360 --> 06:49:21,360
I used to love this game.

5028
06:49:21,360 --> 06:49:23,360
It has a fantastic taste.

5029
06:49:23,360 --> 06:49:25,360
This is my number one game of all time.

5030
06:49:25,360 --> 06:49:27,360
And I suck at it.

5031
06:49:31,360 --> 06:49:33,360
Is there one more Leonardo mission?

5032
06:49:33,360 --> 06:49:35,360
Yes.

5033
06:49:39,360 --> 06:49:41,360
How are they always on the opposite place?

5034
06:49:47,360 --> 06:49:49,360
There's one.

5035
06:49:49,360 --> 06:49:51,360
This is Leonardo.

5036
06:49:51,360 --> 06:49:53,360
And then we'll get the Guilds Faction Femme.

5037
06:49:57,360 --> 06:49:59,360
Tank tank tank.

5038
06:49:59,360 --> 06:50:01,360
You are good at sucking.

5039
06:50:13,360 --> 06:50:15,360
Sorry, I'm making an animated shot

5040
06:50:15,360 --> 06:50:17,360
of your reference sheet for the meme tag.

5041
06:50:17,360 --> 06:50:19,360
Should I bring in the tweet?

5042
06:50:23,360 --> 06:50:25,360
I don't know when it comes to

5043
06:50:25,360 --> 06:50:27,360
memification of something.

5044
06:50:27,360 --> 06:50:29,360
You don't have to credit the original artist.

5045
06:50:29,360 --> 06:50:31,360
I don't know. What do you guys think?

5046
06:50:31,360 --> 06:50:33,360
You're probably better known than me.

5047
06:50:33,360 --> 06:50:35,360
I did credit her right under the

5048
06:50:35,360 --> 06:50:37,360
thingy so people know

5049
06:50:37,360 --> 06:50:39,360
it is by her under the reference sheet

5050
06:50:39,360 --> 06:50:41,360
at all times.

5051
06:50:41,360 --> 06:50:43,360
I don't know.

5052
06:50:43,360 --> 06:50:45,360
These hay bales

5053
06:50:45,360 --> 06:50:47,360
were so confusing actually.

5054
06:50:49,360 --> 06:50:51,360
One of the games I love the most

5055
06:50:51,360 --> 06:50:53,360
is called Dynasty Warriors.

5056
06:50:53,360 --> 06:50:55,360
AC Brotherhood was the last game I

5057
06:50:55,360 --> 06:50:57,360
truly played in the series.

5058
06:50:57,360 --> 06:50:59,360
Yeah, Revelations was alright.

5059
06:50:59,360 --> 06:51:01,360
But

5060
06:51:01,360 --> 06:51:03,360
it wasn't Brotherhood.

5061
06:51:07,360 --> 06:51:09,360
If I had to rank them as Brotherhood

5062
06:51:09,360 --> 06:51:11,360
then AC2 and then Revelations for

5063
06:51:11,360 --> 06:51:13,360
Exo's storyline.

5064
06:51:13,360 --> 06:51:15,360
I went on an adventure trying to beat

5065
06:51:15,360 --> 06:51:17,360
all of this

5066
06:51:17,360 --> 06:51:19,360
but I stopped at Syndicate.

5067
06:51:21,360 --> 06:51:23,360
I think I've played Assassin's Creed 3

5068
06:51:23,360 --> 06:51:25,360
maybe unironically three times.

5069
06:51:27,360 --> 06:51:29,360
It's just no fun.

5070
06:51:33,360 --> 06:51:35,360
ACR had

5071
06:51:35,360 --> 06:51:37,360
a fucking turret defense.

5072
06:51:37,360 --> 06:51:39,360
Literally the turret defense.

5073
06:51:39,360 --> 06:51:41,360
Do slash credit.

5074
06:51:41,360 --> 06:51:43,360
Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's

5075
06:51:43,360 --> 06:51:44,360
not like

5076
06:51:44,360 --> 06:51:45,360
bothering.

5077
06:51:45,360 --> 06:51:47,360
But the credit is there for people who do

5078
06:51:47,360 --> 06:51:49,360
want to use it.

5079
06:51:49,360 --> 06:51:51,360
Yeah, people say they love Black Flag.

5080
06:51:51,360 --> 06:51:53,360
I struggled so much to get into it.

5081
06:51:53,360 --> 06:51:55,360
But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm a

5082
06:51:55,360 --> 06:51:57,360
little crybaby because AC wasn't

5083
06:51:57,360 --> 06:51:59,360
in the series anymore.

5084
06:51:59,360 --> 06:52:01,360
Which is very plausible.

5085
06:52:01,360 --> 06:52:03,360
I wouldn't mind to try and get

5086
06:52:03,360 --> 06:52:05,360
Black Flag. One more big hood.

5087
06:52:05,360 --> 06:52:07,360
Yeah.

5088
06:52:09,360 --> 06:52:11,360
But I just

5089
06:52:11,360 --> 06:52:13,360
really seem to struggle with the controls

5090
06:52:13,360 --> 06:52:15,360
but it's probably because I'm doing

5091
06:52:15,360 --> 06:52:17,360
the, well I've already played Assassin's Creed

5092
06:52:17,360 --> 06:52:19,360
so I don't need to sit and read the controls

5093
06:52:19,360 --> 06:52:21,360
well obviously they have changed the controls.

5094
06:52:23,360 --> 06:52:25,360
I'm

5095
06:52:25,360 --> 06:52:27,360
you're being a crybaby.

5096
06:52:31,360 --> 06:52:33,360
I wish they would make

5097
06:52:33,360 --> 06:52:35,360
more like story multiplayer games.

5098
06:52:35,360 --> 06:52:37,360
Like

5099
06:52:37,360 --> 06:52:39,360
it takes to

5100
06:52:39,360 --> 06:52:41,360
is like such a good story

5101
06:52:41,360 --> 06:52:43,360
thing and I would absolutely love to

5102
06:52:43,360 --> 06:52:45,360
play games like that on stream and be like

5103
06:52:45,360 --> 06:52:47,360
okay after the first chapter we'll get

5104
06:52:47,360 --> 06:52:49,360
someone else in, okay next chapter we'll

5105
06:52:49,360 --> 06:52:51,360
get someone else in but like they just

5106
06:52:51,360 --> 06:52:53,360
didn't do that. They just didn't do that.

5107
06:52:55,360 --> 06:52:57,360
It's so annoying.

5108
06:52:57,360 --> 06:52:59,360
It's so frustrating.

5109
06:52:59,360 --> 06:53:01,360
I can't believe I can't play video games

5110
06:53:01,360 --> 06:53:03,360
exactly the way I want to

5111
06:53:03,360 --> 06:53:05,360
play them.

5112
06:53:05,360 --> 06:53:07,360
It's such a baby.

5113
06:53:11,360 --> 06:53:13,360
Kill the Templar overseer to recover map.

5114
06:53:13,360 --> 06:53:15,360
Use the pistol.

5115
06:53:17,360 --> 06:53:19,360
I can do that.

5116
06:53:31,360 --> 06:53:33,360
No.

5117
06:53:33,360 --> 06:53:35,360
Yes. No.

5118
06:53:35,360 --> 06:53:37,360
Yes.

5119
06:53:41,360 --> 06:53:43,360
Yeah I was going to say you sure you want to

5120
06:53:43,360 --> 06:53:45,360
fight this. Oh wow

5121
06:53:45,360 --> 06:53:47,360
it's always you guys that want to fight.

5122
06:53:47,360 --> 06:53:49,360
Stop this.

5123
06:53:49,360 --> 06:53:51,360
Fuck it Sam.

5124
06:53:51,360 --> 06:53:53,360
Not really.

5125
06:53:53,360 --> 06:53:55,360
I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back.

5126
06:53:57,360 --> 06:53:59,360
I've been having a blast

5127
06:53:59,360 --> 06:54:01,360
watching a veteran on a newcomer play the

5128
06:54:01,360 --> 06:54:03,360
Halo.

5129
06:54:03,360 --> 06:54:05,360
Oh yeah the Halo campaign

5130
06:54:05,360 --> 06:54:07,360
is going to be playable.

5131
06:54:15,360 --> 06:54:17,360
Where am I supposed to go?

5132
06:54:17,360 --> 06:54:19,360
Okay last one question mark I think.

5133
06:54:19,360 --> 06:54:21,360
Is it like

5134
06:54:21,360 --> 06:54:23,360
safe to do

5135
06:54:23,360 --> 06:54:25,360
a Halo campaign?

5136
06:54:25,360 --> 06:54:27,360
That would be really cool to do a

5137
06:54:27,360 --> 06:54:29,360
refling. It's not going to lie.

5138
06:54:29,360 --> 06:54:31,360
I'd be pretty hyped for that.

5139
06:54:31,360 --> 06:54:33,360
But I don't know how safe it is to like add

5140
06:54:33,360 --> 06:54:35,360
people.

5141
06:54:35,360 --> 06:54:37,360
Because I don't think I can just instance and

5142
06:54:37,360 --> 06:54:39,360
have you guys in.

5143
06:54:39,360 --> 06:54:41,360
It would be pretty cool to like

5144
06:54:41,360 --> 06:54:47,360
I don't, is it

5145
06:54:47,360 --> 06:54:49,360
duo only or is it four man?

5146
06:54:53,360 --> 06:54:55,360
Favorite game combat of

5147
06:54:55,360 --> 06:54:57,360
is it evolved or

5148
06:54:57,360 --> 06:54:59,360
evolution?

5149
06:55:01,360 --> 06:55:03,360
Oh my gosh

5150
06:55:03,360 --> 06:55:05,360
it's John Halo from Fortnight.

5151
06:55:05,360 --> 06:55:07,360
Laying out his tank

5152
06:55:07,360 --> 06:55:09,360
is an ambitious and devastating war machine

5153
06:55:09,360 --> 06:55:11,360
capable. Do not take any damage while in

5154
06:55:11,360 --> 06:55:13,360
the tank. Yeah good luck for that.

5155
06:55:13,360 --> 06:55:15,360
We're not doing this one.

5156
06:55:15,360 --> 06:55:17,360
But you know

5157
06:55:25,360 --> 06:55:27,360
I have name poison

5158
06:55:27,360 --> 06:55:29,360
which is decent.

5159
06:55:39,360 --> 06:55:41,360
Is he going to come see me?

5160
06:55:41,360 --> 06:55:43,360
Oops.

5161
06:55:43,360 --> 06:55:45,360
Yeah we're not doing that.

5162
06:55:45,360 --> 06:55:47,360
Literally everyone's getting poisoned.

5163
06:55:47,360 --> 06:55:49,360
I don't care.

5164
06:55:51,360 --> 06:55:53,360
I only have name to watch.

5165
06:55:53,360 --> 06:55:55,360
I should have bought some more at a healer.

5166
06:55:59,360 --> 06:56:01,360
Yeah maybe if

5167
06:56:01,360 --> 06:56:03,360
it's safe to add people like on Halo

5168
06:56:03,360 --> 06:56:05,360
then we could do

5169
06:56:05,360 --> 06:56:07,360
playthroughs of that but

5170
06:56:07,360 --> 06:56:09,360
I guess you

5171
06:56:09,360 --> 06:56:11,360
do it mission by mission so like we would do one

5172
06:56:11,360 --> 06:56:13,360
mission and then

5173
06:56:13,360 --> 06:56:15,360
kick out and then add

5174
06:56:15,360 --> 06:56:17,360
and then next mission kick out

5175
06:56:17,360 --> 06:56:19,360
you know.

5176
06:56:21,360 --> 06:56:23,360
You see nothing.

5177
06:56:27,360 --> 06:56:29,360
How did you guys not shoot?

5178
06:56:29,360 --> 06:56:31,360
It's a poison dart so it's supposed to

5179
06:56:31,360 --> 06:56:33,360
just be like a little swing

5180
06:56:33,360 --> 06:56:35,360
and no one knows.

5181
06:56:35,360 --> 06:56:37,360
Literally poison is so OP for like when it

5182
06:56:37,360 --> 06:56:39,360
comes to don't be detected because you can walk

5183
06:56:39,360 --> 06:56:41,360
right in front of them and

5184
06:56:41,360 --> 06:56:43,360
obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing

5185
06:56:43,360 --> 06:56:45,360
but I don't know how to say it.

5186
06:56:45,360 --> 06:56:47,360
Poison's cool.

5187
06:56:47,360 --> 06:56:49,360
Oops sorry.

5188
06:56:49,360 --> 06:56:51,360
I was pulling down my sleeves

5189
06:56:51,360 --> 06:56:53,360
I'm getting a...

5190
06:56:53,360 --> 06:56:55,360
That's right I'm wearing a hoodie.

5191
06:56:55,360 --> 06:56:57,360
You'll never guess why.

5192
06:56:57,360 --> 06:56:59,360
Wait how am I supposed to see him?

5193
06:57:07,360 --> 06:57:09,360
I love how as soon as you go sideways

5194
06:57:09,360 --> 06:57:11,360
they just don't care anymore.

5195
06:57:19,360 --> 06:57:21,360
Beat up the architect.

5196
06:57:21,360 --> 06:57:23,360
Oh okay.

5197
06:57:25,360 --> 06:57:27,360
Hello.

5198
06:57:35,360 --> 06:57:37,360
You're so aggressive.

5199
06:57:37,360 --> 06:57:39,360
You just ask before beating up.

5200
06:57:49,360 --> 06:57:51,360
We're helping people.

5201
06:57:53,360 --> 06:57:55,360
Go home.

5202
06:57:57,360 --> 06:57:59,360
Checkpoint reached.

5203
06:57:59,360 --> 06:58:01,360
Amalo to be seen yet?

5204
06:58:03,360 --> 06:58:05,360
No.

5205
06:58:07,360 --> 06:58:09,360
This music is so dramatic.

5206
06:58:09,360 --> 06:58:11,360
Checking my heart for that.

5207
06:58:11,360 --> 06:58:13,360
You can go first.

5208
06:58:13,360 --> 06:58:15,360
Sucks to suck.

5209
06:58:15,360 --> 06:58:17,360
Sorry but if someone had to bear.

5210
06:58:19,360 --> 06:58:21,360
We could do two poisons here

5211
06:58:21,360 --> 06:58:23,360
just to be doubly sure.

5212
06:58:27,360 --> 06:58:29,360
We could probably do...

5213
06:58:29,360 --> 06:58:31,360
Can you? No I really...

5214
06:58:31,360 --> 06:58:33,360
Oh my god that alerted him?

5215
06:58:33,360 --> 06:58:35,360
No.

5216
06:58:35,360 --> 06:58:37,360
I need this guy to par...

5217
06:58:37,360 --> 06:58:39,360
Stop hurting!

5218
06:58:39,360 --> 06:58:41,360
And then in order to unsheathe my...

5219
06:58:45,360 --> 06:58:47,360
Right you're next.

5220
06:58:47,360 --> 06:58:49,360
You're freaking next.

5221
06:58:49,360 --> 06:58:51,360
Now that I can see you.

5222
06:58:51,360 --> 06:58:53,360
Jeez you're such a pain in my butt.

5223
06:58:53,360 --> 06:58:55,360
Not the good kind.

5224
06:58:55,360 --> 06:58:57,360
You're next.

5225
06:58:57,360 --> 06:58:59,360
You're all done.

5226
06:58:59,360 --> 06:59:01,360
And everyone's perished.

5227
06:59:01,360 --> 06:59:03,360
And my ankles are sore.

5228
06:59:03,360 --> 06:59:05,360
But it's fine.

5229
06:59:05,360 --> 06:59:07,360
We did it.

5230
06:59:07,360 --> 06:59:09,360
First thing I checked

5231
06:59:09,360 --> 06:59:11,360
was she still screaming for me.

5232
06:59:11,360 --> 06:59:13,360
No.

5233
06:59:13,360 --> 06:59:15,360
I would have gone the 14 hours

5234
06:59:15,360 --> 06:59:17,360
but it didn't work.

5235
06:59:17,360 --> 06:59:19,360
Free the mercenaries.

5236
06:59:19,360 --> 06:59:21,360
Can I still be...

5237
06:59:21,360 --> 06:59:23,360
Can't be spoilers?

5238
06:59:27,360 --> 06:59:29,360
So I don't even hear?

5239
06:59:29,360 --> 06:59:31,360
Doesn't look like it.

5240
06:59:31,360 --> 06:59:33,360
Hi mercenaries!

5241
06:59:33,360 --> 06:59:35,360
Where is Dabinchi's machine?

5242
06:59:35,360 --> 06:59:37,360
Follow us. They have hidden the path

5243
06:59:37,360 --> 06:59:39,360
but we discovered the entrance.

5244
06:59:39,360 --> 06:59:41,360
There you come lads.

5245
06:59:43,360 --> 06:59:45,360
Three mercenaries?

5246
06:59:45,360 --> 06:59:47,360
Oh not two.

5247
06:59:47,360 --> 06:59:49,360
Follow and protect them.

5248
06:59:49,360 --> 06:59:51,360
Well maybe if they didn't

5249
06:59:51,360 --> 06:59:53,360
jump right in front of the enemies.

5250
06:59:53,360 --> 06:59:55,360
Then sure.

5251
06:59:55,360 --> 06:59:57,360
Wait wait wait you're done.

5252
06:59:57,360 --> 06:59:59,360
I'm farting.

5253
06:59:59,360 --> 07:00:01,360
You're done.

5254
07:00:01,360 --> 07:00:03,360
Oh it's good to see me.

5255
07:00:05,360 --> 07:00:07,360
Hopefully they can actually fight a weaver.

5256
07:00:07,360 --> 07:00:09,360
No! Why are you fighting one of them?

5257
07:00:09,360 --> 07:00:11,360
Why is there...

5258
07:00:11,360 --> 07:00:13,360
Please stab them in the...

5259
07:00:13,360 --> 07:00:15,360
Oh and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

5260
07:00:15,360 --> 07:00:17,360
Stop it.

5261
07:00:17,360 --> 07:00:19,360
Stop it.

5262
07:00:25,360 --> 07:00:27,360
I hate when they do that right.

5263
07:00:27,360 --> 07:00:29,360
Where are you taking me?

5264
07:00:33,360 --> 07:00:35,360
Step eight Rizzo.

5265
07:00:35,360 --> 07:00:37,360
Fart in the guards faces.

5266
07:00:37,360 --> 07:00:39,360
Get him first!

5267
07:00:39,360 --> 07:00:41,360
Get him first! No you missed him!

5268
07:00:41,360 --> 07:00:43,360
You were supposed to get the other guards.

5269
07:00:43,360 --> 07:00:45,360
Right right we're farting again.

5270
07:00:45,360 --> 07:00:47,360
There we go.

5271
07:00:53,360 --> 07:00:55,360
I should have got that guy first actually.

5272
07:00:55,360 --> 07:00:57,360
Oh and he's right around the corner.

5273
07:00:57,360 --> 07:00:59,360
I'm just attracted to the tent.

5274
07:00:59,360 --> 07:01:01,360
Please just perish your one HP

5275
07:01:01,360 --> 07:01:03,360
in a freaking dream!

5276
07:01:03,360 --> 07:01:05,360
And it's not even registering

5277
07:01:05,360 --> 07:01:07,360
my kicks probably.

5278
07:01:07,360 --> 07:01:09,360
And that guy's getting beaten up by a brute.

5279
07:01:09,360 --> 07:01:11,360
Yeah they're done.

5280
07:01:11,360 --> 07:01:13,360
Can I loot in time for another

5281
07:01:13,360 --> 07:01:15,360
fart bomb because

5282
07:01:15,360 --> 07:01:17,360
we're needing them.

5283
07:01:17,360 --> 07:01:19,360
I got one. Okay I actually got one needed.

5284
07:01:31,360 --> 07:01:33,360
Let's go for it.

5285
07:01:33,360 --> 07:01:35,360
What's that?

5286
07:01:37,360 --> 07:01:39,360
Open inside?

5287
07:01:43,360 --> 07:01:45,360
Hold still.

5288
07:01:45,360 --> 07:01:47,360
Wait for me.

5289
07:01:47,360 --> 07:01:49,360
A little bit parkour.

5290
07:01:49,360 --> 07:01:51,360
A little bit parkour momentum.

5291
07:01:57,360 --> 07:01:59,360
Okay there we go.

5292
07:01:59,360 --> 07:02:01,360
Open for you.

5293
07:02:01,360 --> 07:02:03,360
Open sesame.

5294
07:02:09,360 --> 07:02:11,360
Did I just say open sesame?

5295
07:02:13,360 --> 07:02:15,360
No.

5296
07:02:17,360 --> 07:02:19,360
Remember that time

5297
07:02:19,360 --> 07:02:21,360
I got asked about open sesame?

5298
07:02:23,360 --> 07:02:25,360
And I said open cumin.

5299
07:02:25,360 --> 07:02:27,360
Good times.

5300
07:02:27,360 --> 07:02:29,360
I'm such an idiot.

5301
07:02:31,360 --> 07:02:33,360
I don't know if anyone remembers.

5302
07:02:35,360 --> 07:02:37,360
Saved!

5303
07:02:37,360 --> 07:02:39,360
Jeez it's you.

5304
07:02:39,360 --> 07:02:41,360
I did not think I would get here.

5305
07:02:45,360 --> 07:02:47,360
I don't know why my brain blank.

5306
07:02:49,360 --> 07:02:51,360
I think it was the way the question was worded.

5307
07:02:51,360 --> 07:02:53,360
I will lower the bridge.

5308
07:02:53,360 --> 07:02:55,360
Can I lower the bridge?

5309
07:02:55,360 --> 07:02:57,360
I guess I can.

5310
07:03:01,360 --> 07:03:03,360
Open sesame!

5311
07:03:03,360 --> 07:03:05,360
Or open cumin.

5312
07:03:05,360 --> 07:03:07,360
I don't know which one seems better than me.

5313
07:03:09,360 --> 07:03:11,360
I don't know.

5314
07:03:17,360 --> 07:03:19,360
Is there a lever?

5315
07:03:19,360 --> 07:03:21,360
I don't think so.

5316
07:03:25,360 --> 07:03:27,360
The way you recalled that.

5317
07:03:27,360 --> 07:03:29,360
Literally my brain was like

5318
07:03:29,360 --> 07:03:31,360
recalling memory loading.

5319
07:03:31,360 --> 07:03:33,360
Memory loaded.

5320
07:03:33,360 --> 07:03:35,360
It's open cinnamon.

5321
07:03:43,360 --> 07:03:45,360
Music?

5322
07:03:49,360 --> 07:03:51,360
Oh my god.

5323
07:03:51,360 --> 07:03:53,360
Hello?

5324
07:03:55,360 --> 07:03:57,360
Can I run people?

5325
07:03:57,360 --> 07:03:59,360
I must be able to run people over.

5326
07:03:59,360 --> 07:04:01,360
There's no way in heck.

5327
07:04:01,360 --> 07:04:03,360
Oh my god.

5328
07:04:03,360 --> 07:04:05,360
This is adorable.

5329
07:04:05,360 --> 07:04:07,360
Yeah, POV come.

5330
07:04:07,360 --> 07:04:09,360
Take that.

5331
07:04:13,360 --> 07:04:15,360
This is so cool.

5332
07:04:15,360 --> 07:04:17,360
I love this POV.

5333
07:04:17,360 --> 07:04:19,360
Maybe not.

5334
07:04:21,360 --> 07:04:23,360
I don't know what's behind it.

5335
07:04:23,360 --> 07:04:25,360
I assume that's what hurts me.

5336
07:04:25,360 --> 07:04:27,360
If I take damage.

5337
07:04:27,360 --> 07:04:29,360
I don't know.

5338
07:04:29,360 --> 07:04:31,360
100% a bunch.

5339
07:04:31,360 --> 07:04:33,360
That's unlucky.

5340
07:04:33,360 --> 07:04:35,360
Oh well.

5341
07:04:35,360 --> 07:04:37,360
Sorry, that's a lot easier to tell

5342
07:04:37,360 --> 07:04:39,360
what's coming up.

5343
07:04:39,360 --> 07:04:41,360
I'm sorry, I have to change camera angle.

5344
07:04:41,360 --> 07:04:43,360
I apologize.

5345
07:04:45,360 --> 07:04:47,360
After the 100%.

5346
07:04:47,360 --> 07:04:49,360
Are you squidding me right now?

5347
07:04:49,360 --> 07:04:51,360
Thank you for the tip.

5348
07:04:51,360 --> 07:04:53,360
What did you see?

5349
07:04:55,360 --> 07:04:57,360
Hold on.

5350
07:04:57,360 --> 07:04:59,360
I'm destroying things.

5351
07:04:59,360 --> 07:05:01,360
Wait, wait.

5352
07:05:01,360 --> 07:05:03,360
Thank you for the tip.

5353
07:05:03,360 --> 07:05:05,360
Why are you?

5354
07:05:05,360 --> 07:05:07,360
There's no way someone is standing up to a tank.

5355
07:05:07,360 --> 07:05:09,360
You have to be crazy to stand up to a tank.

5356
07:05:11,360 --> 07:05:13,360
Did they even do damage?

5357
07:05:21,360 --> 07:05:23,360
Oh, so you can dodge.

5358
07:05:23,360 --> 07:05:25,360
Let me pause.

5359
07:05:25,360 --> 07:05:27,360
I don't want to miss that.

5360
07:05:27,360 --> 07:05:29,360
I'm really dumb.

5361
07:05:29,360 --> 07:05:31,360
I'm going to forget.

5362
07:05:31,360 --> 07:05:33,360
I don't want to forgo.

5363
07:05:33,360 --> 07:05:35,360
No way.

5364
07:05:35,360 --> 07:05:37,360
Okay.

5365
07:05:37,360 --> 07:05:39,360
Hey Australia.

5366
07:05:39,360 --> 07:05:41,360
I'm back from work.

5367
07:05:41,360 --> 07:05:43,360
Yeah, I got tank tank.

5368
07:05:43,360 --> 07:05:45,360
Thank you for the tip.

5369
07:05:45,360 --> 07:05:47,360
I appreciate it.

5370
07:05:47,360 --> 07:05:49,360
Oh.

5371
07:05:49,360 --> 07:05:51,360
Man, just tank that whole cannonball.

5372
07:05:53,360 --> 07:05:55,360
I need help setting up alerts.

5373
07:05:55,360 --> 07:05:57,360
They barely work.

5374
07:05:57,360 --> 07:05:59,360
It's a bit of a nightmare to instrument elements,

5375
07:05:59,360 --> 07:06:01,360
but once you get it set up,

5376
07:06:01,360 --> 07:06:03,360
you never have to change it again.

5377
07:06:03,360 --> 07:06:05,360
And you can set up custom

5378
07:06:05,360 --> 07:06:07,360
things like if someone

5379
07:06:07,360 --> 07:06:09,360
donated like $69,

5380
07:06:09,360 --> 07:06:11,360
for example, you can get it to do.

5381
07:06:11,360 --> 07:06:13,360
Are we going in a battle dome?

5382
07:06:13,360 --> 07:06:15,360
Yes!

5383
07:06:15,360 --> 07:06:17,360
Yes!

5384
07:06:17,360 --> 07:06:19,360
Oh my god, tank battle dome!

5385
07:06:19,360 --> 07:06:21,360
Take this.

5386
07:06:21,360 --> 07:06:23,360
And this.

5387
07:06:23,360 --> 07:06:25,360
Hold on, I'm reloading.

5388
07:06:25,360 --> 07:06:27,360
And this.

5389
07:06:27,360 --> 07:06:29,360
Yes!

5390
07:06:29,360 --> 07:06:31,360
Oh my god, I love tank battle dome.

5391
07:06:31,360 --> 07:06:33,360
This is amazing.

5392
07:06:39,360 --> 07:06:41,360
More tank battle dome.

5393
07:06:41,360 --> 07:06:43,360
More tank battle dome.

5394
07:06:43,360 --> 07:06:45,360
There's something.

5395
07:06:45,360 --> 07:06:47,360
Let me in.

5396
07:06:47,360 --> 07:06:49,360
Let me in.

5397
07:06:49,360 --> 07:06:51,360
This is why I think of your factories.

5398
07:06:51,360 --> 07:06:53,360
Take this, capitalism.

5399
07:06:55,360 --> 07:06:57,360
Tanks! Tank battle dome!

5400
07:06:57,360 --> 07:06:59,360
No, no, you're not loading the tank.

5401
07:06:59,360 --> 07:07:01,360
You're not loading it.

5402
07:07:01,360 --> 07:07:03,360
Tank battle dome.

5403
07:07:03,360 --> 07:07:05,360
Tank battle dome.

5404
07:07:05,360 --> 07:07:07,360
I'm stuck on the cylinder box.

5405
07:07:07,360 --> 07:07:09,360
Tank battle dome.

5406
07:07:09,360 --> 07:07:11,360
Tank battle dome.

5407
07:07:13,360 --> 07:07:15,360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

5408
07:07:15,360 --> 07:07:17,360
Wait, wait, wait. Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

5409
07:07:17,360 --> 07:07:19,360
Let me in.

5410
07:07:19,360 --> 07:07:21,360
Okay, there we go.

5411
07:07:21,360 --> 07:07:23,360
Tank battle dome.

5412
07:07:23,360 --> 07:07:25,360
Battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome.

5413
07:07:39,360 --> 07:07:41,360
Yeah, I don't know how I'm going to

5414
07:07:41,360 --> 07:07:43,360
think that. I'm not going to lie.

5415
07:07:43,360 --> 07:07:45,360
I ain't going, there's no way I'm 100%.

5416
07:07:45,360 --> 07:07:47,360
We can try and layer

5417
07:07:47,360 --> 07:07:49,360
streams, but

5418
07:07:49,360 --> 07:07:51,360
yeah, there's no shot. I'm doing it tonight.

5419
07:07:51,360 --> 07:07:53,360
Arrivederci.

5420
07:07:53,360 --> 07:07:55,360
Little tank.

5421
07:07:55,360 --> 07:07:57,360
No, I wish I could keep you.

5422
07:07:57,360 --> 07:07:59,360
I see we're so real for that.

5423
07:07:59,360 --> 07:08:01,360
That was fun.

5424
07:08:01,360 --> 07:08:03,360
I like tank battle dome.

5425
07:08:03,360 --> 07:08:05,360
Just don't take damage.

5426
07:08:05,360 --> 07:08:07,360
Five hits, honestly.

5427
07:08:07,360 --> 07:08:09,360
Someone was like, have you ever played the game modded before?

5428
07:08:09,360 --> 07:08:11,360
Me who mods it so I can't take damage

5429
07:08:11,360 --> 07:08:13,360
so I can do the no damage hits.

5430
07:08:13,360 --> 07:08:15,360
Runs.

5431
07:08:15,360 --> 07:08:17,360
Some of the

5432
07:08:17,360 --> 07:08:19,360
freaking 100%

5433
07:08:19,360 --> 07:08:21,360
are a bit outrageous, honestly.

5434
07:08:25,360 --> 07:08:27,360
Rest builders who have to go, if you need

5435
07:08:27,360 --> 07:08:29,360
to go sleepy, bye bye.

5436
07:08:29,360 --> 07:08:31,360
Strongly, I'm up for almost 36 hours.

5437
07:08:31,360 --> 07:08:33,360
I'm going to get some shy.

5438
07:08:33,360 --> 07:08:35,360
Oh my God, that's dangerous. Definitely get some rest.

5439
07:08:35,360 --> 07:08:37,360
My goodness.

5440
07:08:37,360 --> 07:08:39,360
Yes, we will have a wonderful stream.

5441
07:08:47,360 --> 07:08:49,360
It's dirty underwear.

5442
07:08:57,360 --> 07:08:59,360
Okay.

5443
07:08:59,360 --> 07:09:01,360
I think I know what we do with that.

5444
07:09:03,360 --> 07:09:05,360
I think I know

5445
07:09:05,360 --> 07:09:07,360
what we do with it.

5446
07:09:13,360 --> 07:09:15,360
99% sure I know what we do with it.

5447
07:09:17,360 --> 07:09:19,360
Y'all don't mind

5448
07:09:19,360 --> 07:09:21,360
what we go do right now.

5449
07:09:25,360 --> 07:09:27,360
That was Leonardo da Vinci, you're right.

5450
07:09:27,360 --> 07:09:29,360
You're not wrong.

5451
07:09:29,360 --> 07:09:31,360
Maybe I could have gone off that surface.

5452
07:09:35,360 --> 07:09:37,360
I think it's just one of the guild

5453
07:09:37,360 --> 07:09:39,360
requirements

5454
07:09:39,360 --> 07:09:41,360
to use

5455
07:09:41,360 --> 07:09:43,360
the parachute.

5456
07:09:43,360 --> 07:09:45,360
Oh, there's a bank actually.

5457
07:09:45,360 --> 07:09:47,360
I'm going to take my bank money out because

5458
07:09:47,360 --> 07:09:49,360
it looks cool.

5459
07:09:51,360 --> 07:09:53,360
I can faint the bank.

5460
07:09:53,360 --> 07:09:55,360
Good evening.

5461
07:09:55,360 --> 07:09:57,360
Good afternoon, Mr.

5462
07:09:57,360 --> 07:09:59,360
Bankman.

5463
07:09:59,360 --> 07:10:01,360
Can I have my landlord simulant?

5464
07:10:01,360 --> 07:10:03,360
Whoa, where the heck is this thing?

5465
07:10:03,360 --> 07:10:05,360
Can I have the landlord simulator

5466
07:10:05,360 --> 07:10:07,360
part of this game?

5467
07:10:09,360 --> 07:10:11,360
Is he counting coins?

5468
07:10:11,360 --> 07:10:13,360
Why is he leaning over like that?

5469
07:10:13,360 --> 07:10:15,360
He looks so insidious, like, ball him.

5470
07:10:15,360 --> 07:10:17,360
My coins.

5471
07:10:21,360 --> 07:10:23,360
12 never came, so me and the SUV

5472
07:10:23,360 --> 07:10:25,360
just went away. Lol.

5473
07:10:29,360 --> 07:10:31,360
Hello bank, I was like

5474
07:10:31,360 --> 07:10:33,360
I want one zillion dollars.

5475
07:10:35,360 --> 07:10:37,360
We're rich, we're rich.

5476
07:10:39,360 --> 07:10:41,360
Right, next

5477
07:10:41,360 --> 07:10:43,360
we're going to do challenges

5478
07:10:43,360 --> 07:10:45,360
to get

5479
07:10:45,360 --> 07:10:47,360
our guild

5480
07:10:47,360 --> 07:10:49,360
to play decoration,

5481
07:10:49,360 --> 07:10:51,360
to play room decoration.

5482
07:10:51,360 --> 07:10:53,360
So we've done landlord simulator, we're now doing room

5483
07:10:53,360 --> 07:10:55,360
decoration.

5484
07:10:55,360 --> 07:10:57,360
Uh,

5485
07:10:57,360 --> 07:10:59,360
and then

5486
07:10:59,360 --> 07:11:01,360
after that

5487
07:11:01,360 --> 07:11:03,360
I

5488
07:11:03,360 --> 07:11:05,360
think we actually have

5489
07:11:05,360 --> 07:11:07,360
done, like, the main

5490
07:11:07,360 --> 07:11:09,360
we're going to take some of the layouts

5491
07:11:09,360 --> 07:11:11,360
of this place.

5492
07:11:11,360 --> 07:11:13,360
He actually just gave you

5493
07:11:13,360 --> 07:11:15,360
sheets to take. It's his laundry.

5494
07:11:15,360 --> 07:11:17,360
He's like, here it is, it's all for you

5495
07:11:17,360 --> 07:11:19,360
buddy.

5496
07:11:19,360 --> 07:11:21,360
And why not jump with me?

5497
07:11:21,360 --> 07:11:23,360
That's such a smart, I wonder

5498
07:11:23,360 --> 07:11:25,360
he only says that line

5499
07:11:25,360 --> 07:11:27,360
if you jump here.

5500
07:11:29,360 --> 07:11:31,360
Butcher. It's not a butcher.

5501
07:11:31,360 --> 07:11:33,360
Why do you keep saying butcher?

5502
07:11:33,360 --> 07:11:35,360
I don't know.

5503
07:11:35,360 --> 07:11:37,360
They both begin with the letter B

5504
07:11:37,360 --> 07:11:39,360
so

5505
07:11:39,360 --> 07:11:41,360
yeah, maybe that's why

5506
07:11:41,360 --> 07:11:43,360
instead of blacksmiths I say butcher.

5507
07:11:47,360 --> 07:11:49,360
Up next, animal crossing

5508
07:11:49,360 --> 07:11:51,360
decorating rooms.

5509
07:11:51,360 --> 07:11:53,360
I

5510
07:11:53,360 --> 07:11:55,360
personally will never

5511
07:11:55,360 --> 07:11:57,360
stream animal crossing.

5512
07:11:57,360 --> 07:11:59,360
I don't

5513
07:11:59,360 --> 07:12:01,360
know.

5514
07:12:01,360 --> 07:12:03,360
Whoa, they boarded me

5515
07:12:03,360 --> 07:12:05,360
out.

5516
07:12:05,360 --> 07:12:07,360
Oh

5517
07:12:07,360 --> 07:12:09,360
bridge.

5518
07:12:09,360 --> 07:12:11,360
Like I don't know if I can make

5519
07:12:11,360 --> 07:12:13,360
animal crossing fun.

5520
07:12:13,360 --> 07:12:15,360
Like

5521
07:12:15,360 --> 07:12:17,360
maybe as a

5522
07:12:17,360 --> 07:12:19,360
I don't know. I couldn't make it

5523
07:12:19,360 --> 07:12:21,360
fun. I don't mind watching other people play it

5524
07:12:21,360 --> 07:12:23,360
but me, I'm like, I ain't that creative

5525
07:12:23,360 --> 07:12:25,360
to make it entertaining.

5526
07:12:25,360 --> 07:12:27,360
I love all the games that

5527
07:12:27,360 --> 07:12:29,360
start with AC on full.

5528
07:12:29,360 --> 07:12:31,360
Right, so I guess the only way to get back

5529
07:12:31,360 --> 07:12:33,360
into the castle is this way from now on.

5530
07:12:33,360 --> 07:12:35,360
Whoa, we have over a hundred

5531
07:12:35,360 --> 07:12:37,360
thousand forums.

5532
07:12:39,360 --> 07:12:41,360
Right, I can

5533
07:12:41,360 --> 07:12:43,360
can I walk through that gate?

5534
07:12:43,360 --> 07:12:45,360
No.

5535
07:12:45,360 --> 07:12:47,360
That would be too easy.

5536
07:12:47,360 --> 07:12:49,360
I wonder, actually, probably post-game

5537
07:12:49,360 --> 07:12:51,360
they should actually open that gate. I said what I said

5538
07:12:51,360 --> 07:12:53,360
because like chaseries won't do a thing.

5539
07:12:55,360 --> 07:12:57,360
Yeah, oh no, guys, I've got a DM.

5540
07:12:57,360 --> 07:12:59,360
I was getting nervous.

5541
07:12:59,360 --> 07:13:01,360
I'm like, oh no, is there something wrong with my babies

5542
07:13:01,360 --> 07:13:03,360
if I've got a DM?

5543
07:13:05,360 --> 07:13:06,360
Everything is

5544
07:13:06,360 --> 07:13:07,360
really cute.

5545
07:13:09,360 --> 07:13:11,360
Oh, we have the thumbnails

5546
07:13:11,360 --> 07:13:13,360
for our first group collab.

5547
07:13:13,360 --> 07:13:15,360
And that is what I knew.

5548
07:13:15,360 --> 07:13:17,360
How interesting.

5549
07:13:17,360 --> 07:13:19,360
I'll let it be a mystery.

5550
07:13:25,360 --> 07:13:27,360
Rest well, those who have to go.

5551
07:13:27,360 --> 07:13:29,360
Thank you for hanging.

5552
07:13:31,360 --> 07:13:33,360
Mercy is going live

5553
07:13:33,360 --> 07:13:35,360
in 2 minus

5554
07:13:35,360 --> 07:13:37,360
1 hour and 45

5555
07:13:37,360 --> 07:13:39,360
for a

5556
07:13:39,360 --> 07:13:41,360
how the heck to get up. I've completely

5557
07:13:41,360 --> 07:13:43,360
forgotten all over again.

5558
07:13:43,360 --> 07:13:45,360
Just go straight up

5559
07:13:45,360 --> 07:13:47,360
like that, I guess.

5560
07:13:47,360 --> 07:13:49,360
I do have my assassins

5561
07:13:49,360 --> 07:13:51,360
so I suppose I can just signal them to go

5562
07:13:51,360 --> 07:13:53,360
get rid of them.

5563
07:13:53,360 --> 07:13:55,360
Yeah.

5564
07:13:57,360 --> 07:13:59,360
Wait, wasn't there?

5565
07:14:01,360 --> 07:14:03,360
This way over here.

5566
07:14:05,360 --> 07:14:07,360
Relax, Hen.

5567
07:14:07,360 --> 07:14:09,360
Why are you moaning

5568
07:14:09,360 --> 07:14:11,360
about the place? My goodness.

5569
07:14:11,360 --> 07:14:13,360
Alert the guards.

5570
07:14:15,360 --> 07:14:16,360
Good night.

5571
07:14:16,360 --> 07:14:18,360
Sleep well, those who need to sleep.

5572
07:14:18,360 --> 07:14:20,360
Good morning, those who are good

5573
07:14:20,360 --> 07:14:22,360
morning.

5574
07:14:26,360 --> 07:14:28,360
She's getting me acting up.

5575
07:14:28,360 --> 07:14:30,360
Oh, literally, I don't know what that was.

5576
07:14:36,360 --> 07:14:38,360
Okay, this is what I was going to do.

5577
07:14:39,360 --> 07:14:41,360
Let's do you.

5578
07:14:41,360 --> 07:14:43,360
No, that guy actually

5579
07:14:43,360 --> 07:14:45,360
can see you here.

5580
07:14:47,360 --> 07:14:49,360
Morning.

5581
07:14:49,360 --> 07:14:51,360
Europe's waking up.

5582
07:14:57,360 --> 07:14:59,360
Okay, the assassin signals being able to

5583
07:14:59,360 --> 07:15:01,360
do that is like amazing.

5584
07:15:10,360 --> 07:15:12,360
It's 3 a.m. in Europe.

5585
07:15:12,360 --> 07:15:14,360
Oh, I'm a bit early for European streamers.

5586
07:15:14,360 --> 07:15:16,360
I apologize.

5587
07:15:18,360 --> 07:15:20,360
Can I not go up there?

5588
07:15:20,360 --> 07:15:22,360
I don't want to go too far.

5589
07:15:22,360 --> 07:15:24,360
Okay, it's the next one I go up.

5590
07:15:25,360 --> 07:15:27,360
I need to go down in order to go up.

5591
07:15:30,360 --> 07:15:33,360
European's perishing right now trying to

5592
07:15:33,360 --> 07:15:35,360
wait.

5593
07:15:35,360 --> 07:15:37,360
I'm losing it.

5594
07:15:39,360 --> 07:15:41,360
Yeah, go down to go up.

5595
07:15:41,360 --> 07:15:43,360
Okay, I'm starting to kind of remember, but...

5596
07:15:44,360 --> 07:15:46,360
It's always 3 a.m. somewhere.

5597
07:15:50,360 --> 07:15:52,360
Last and ESP.

5598
07:15:53,360 --> 07:15:56,360
I have no idea what time zone I'm like

5599
07:15:56,360 --> 07:15:58,360
perfect for.

5600
07:15:58,360 --> 07:16:00,360
But then again,

5601
07:16:00,360 --> 07:16:02,360
am I technically not perfect

5602
07:16:02,360 --> 07:16:05,360
for all time zones if I stream really long?

5603
07:16:10,360 --> 07:16:11,360
Hmm.

5604
07:16:11,360 --> 07:16:14,360
Yeah, I don't think we're doing a 12 hours

5605
07:16:14,360 --> 07:16:16,360
before anyone is strapped in.

5606
07:16:18,360 --> 07:16:20,360
So some people will be relieved to hear

5607
07:16:20,360 --> 07:16:22,360
that we're not doing another 12 hours

5608
07:16:22,360 --> 07:16:24,360
at this floating home.

5609
07:16:24,360 --> 07:16:26,360
I think when we do Eldon Ring,

5610
07:16:26,360 --> 07:16:29,360
it will be a few back-to-back 12 hours.

5611
07:16:31,360 --> 07:16:33,360
Yeah, you fit all time zones.

5612
07:16:33,360 --> 07:16:35,360
Heh heh heh.

5613
07:16:37,360 --> 07:16:39,360
Bad healthy sleep.

5614
07:16:39,360 --> 07:16:42,360
You'd be perfect for New Zealand.

5615
07:16:43,360 --> 07:16:45,360
I thought it was 4 a.m.

5616
07:16:45,360 --> 07:16:47,360
Sorry, I didn't have my weapon out.

5617
07:16:48,360 --> 07:16:50,360
Sorry, I'm not paying attention.

5618
07:16:50,360 --> 07:16:51,360
I'm Jerry Jack.

5619
07:16:51,360 --> 07:16:53,360
Why have you got your...

5620
07:16:53,360 --> 07:16:54,360
Put away this thing?

5621
07:16:54,360 --> 07:16:56,360
Oh, my thing's glitched out.

5622
07:16:56,360 --> 07:16:57,360
It's like...

5623
07:16:57,360 --> 07:16:59,360
What are you doing?

5624
07:16:59,360 --> 07:17:01,360
Oh, that was kind of badass.

5625
07:17:01,360 --> 07:17:03,360
I wouldn't lose it all.

5626
07:17:05,360 --> 07:17:07,360
Something's not...

5627
07:17:07,360 --> 07:17:08,360
I had it up here.

5628
07:17:08,360 --> 07:17:09,360
That was...

5629
07:17:09,360 --> 07:17:10,360
That was...

5630
07:17:10,360 --> 07:17:11,360
Now my...

5631
07:17:11,360 --> 07:17:12,360
Assassin...

5632
07:17:12,360 --> 07:17:14,360
What are you doing, Lady?

5633
07:17:15,360 --> 07:17:16,360
Classic woman moment.

5634
07:17:16,360 --> 07:17:18,360
Can't make up her mind.

5635
07:17:18,360 --> 07:17:19,360
That's terrible.

5636
07:17:19,360 --> 07:17:21,360
Don't make too much of that.

5637
07:17:22,360 --> 07:17:23,360
Don't do that.

5638
07:17:23,360 --> 07:17:24,360
That's my next.

5639
07:17:24,360 --> 07:17:25,360
Heh heh.

5640
07:17:29,360 --> 07:17:31,360
He has two goons.

5641
07:17:40,360 --> 07:17:42,360
We're doing it!

5642
07:17:42,360 --> 07:17:44,360
We're doing the thing!

5643
07:17:47,360 --> 07:17:48,360
Oh.

5644
07:17:48,360 --> 07:17:49,360
That's on the way.

5645
07:17:49,360 --> 07:17:51,360
Oh, it was on the wrong side.

5646
07:17:51,360 --> 07:17:53,360
My Assassin's still having de-spawn.

5647
07:17:53,360 --> 07:17:54,360
They're freaking out.

5648
07:17:54,360 --> 07:17:55,360
I don't like it.

5649
07:17:56,360 --> 07:17:57,360
Right.

5650
07:17:59,360 --> 07:18:01,360
So I don't mess this up.

5651
07:18:01,360 --> 07:18:03,360
How do I tell the parachute to come out?

5652
07:18:09,360 --> 07:18:10,360
Uh...

5653
07:18:10,360 --> 07:18:11,360
I'm being propaganda.

5654
07:18:11,360 --> 07:18:13,360
How do I tell the parachute to come out?

5655
07:18:15,360 --> 07:18:17,360
Did I just launch and press X?

5656
07:18:19,360 --> 07:18:20,360
Right.

5657
07:18:20,360 --> 07:18:21,360
I don't...

5658
07:18:22,360 --> 07:18:23,360
I don't want to go that way

5659
07:18:23,360 --> 07:18:25,360
because that won't activate the jump.

5660
07:18:27,360 --> 07:18:28,360
Look at that thing.

5661
07:18:28,360 --> 07:18:30,360
The Assassins are really struggling.

5662
07:18:31,360 --> 07:18:32,360
Should prompt...

5663
07:18:32,360 --> 07:18:33,360
Do a flip.

5664
07:18:33,360 --> 07:18:34,360
Okay.

5665
07:18:35,360 --> 07:18:36,360
What were we doing?

5666
07:18:36,360 --> 07:18:37,360
Did I go that way?

5667
07:18:37,360 --> 07:18:38,360
Or that way?

5668
07:18:40,360 --> 07:18:42,360
No point in going in the back in the street.

5669
07:18:45,360 --> 07:18:46,360
Uh...

5670
07:18:46,360 --> 07:18:47,360
Whatever the prompt is,

5671
07:18:47,360 --> 07:18:49,360
bloody hope it comes up because...

5672
07:18:50,360 --> 07:18:51,360
it is...

5673
07:18:51,360 --> 07:18:53,360
not on the wheel.

5674
07:18:56,360 --> 07:18:57,360
Oh, there we go.

5675
07:18:57,360 --> 07:18:58,360
Oh, thank God.

5676
07:18:58,360 --> 07:18:59,360
Right.

5677
07:18:59,360 --> 07:19:01,360
I need to do like a ton of distance.

5678
07:19:01,360 --> 07:19:03,360
I guess I'll just go over the wall.

5679
07:19:05,360 --> 07:19:07,360
I was really worried that prompt wasn't going to come out.

5680
07:19:10,360 --> 07:19:13,360
I think I need to glade like 500 meters.

5681
07:19:19,360 --> 07:19:21,360
Uh...

5682
07:19:21,360 --> 07:19:23,360
Am I going to make the glide?

5683
07:19:27,360 --> 07:19:28,360
Am I going to make the glide?

5684
07:19:28,360 --> 07:19:29,360
Hello?

5685
07:19:31,360 --> 07:19:32,360
Am I not going to make it?

5686
07:19:32,360 --> 07:19:33,360
Come on, pop.

5687
07:19:33,360 --> 07:19:34,360
Pop.

5688
07:19:34,360 --> 07:19:35,360
Pop.

5689
07:19:35,360 --> 07:19:36,360
Pop.

5690
07:19:36,360 --> 07:19:38,360
No, I don't want to climb it again.

5691
07:19:38,360 --> 07:19:39,360
Please pop.

5692
07:19:39,360 --> 07:19:40,360
What was that supposed to do?

5693
07:19:44,360 --> 07:19:45,360
Why did that not pop?

5694
07:19:45,360 --> 07:19:46,360
I was supposed...

5695
07:19:46,360 --> 07:19:47,360
something was supposed to pop there.

5696
07:19:47,360 --> 07:19:48,360
Not the achievement.

5697
07:19:50,360 --> 07:19:52,360
What was supposed to...

5698
07:19:52,360 --> 07:19:54,360
what did I do wrong?

5699
07:19:55,360 --> 07:19:57,360
It was an assassin's.

5700
07:19:59,360 --> 07:20:01,360
Was it thieves because they're agile?

5701
07:20:03,360 --> 07:20:04,360
Glade...

5702
07:20:04,360 --> 07:20:07,360
and a cumulative total of 500 meters were a part of it.

5703
07:20:07,360 --> 07:20:08,360
Is that what I just said?

5704
07:20:14,360 --> 07:20:16,360
I'm not to turn at all.

5705
07:20:17,360 --> 07:20:18,360
Okay.

5706
07:20:19,360 --> 07:20:20,360
No.

5707
07:20:21,360 --> 07:20:24,360
I hope you guys have the same patience for me.

5708
07:20:24,360 --> 07:20:26,360
Because I need to do that all over again.

5709
07:20:26,360 --> 07:20:27,360
I don't know...

5710
07:20:28,360 --> 07:20:29,360
cumulative.

5711
07:20:30,360 --> 07:20:31,360
Alright.

5712
07:20:31,360 --> 07:20:33,360
I'll just do it again because it should pop then.

5713
07:20:34,360 --> 07:20:35,360
Just do it multiple times.

5714
07:20:35,360 --> 07:20:36,360
Yes.

5715
07:20:36,360 --> 07:20:38,360
Alright, we're going to zoom it because at least I know exactly where to go.

5716
07:20:40,360 --> 07:20:41,360
Wait.

5717
07:20:41,360 --> 07:20:42,360
Wait.

5718
07:20:44,360 --> 07:20:46,360
You can do it cheeky sometimes.

5719
07:20:47,360 --> 07:20:49,360
I thought you could do it in one jump.

5720
07:20:49,360 --> 07:20:50,360
For some reason.

5721
07:20:54,360 --> 07:20:56,360
I went for it too often.

5722
07:20:58,360 --> 07:20:59,360
We're so rude.

5723
07:21:00,360 --> 07:21:01,360
Slanted.

5724
07:21:02,360 --> 07:21:08,360
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach.

5725
07:21:09,360 --> 07:21:11,360
If you're trying.

5726
07:21:12,360 --> 07:21:14,360
Oh, I'm breaking free.

5727
07:21:16,360 --> 07:21:17,360
I can't remember the rest of it.

5728
07:21:25,360 --> 07:21:26,360
Does it still have a parachute?

5729
07:21:26,360 --> 07:21:29,360
Yeah, I have four more inventory.

5730
07:21:29,360 --> 07:21:31,360
I can't believe it.

5731
07:21:31,360 --> 07:21:32,360
I can't believe it.

5732
07:21:32,360 --> 07:21:34,360
I can't believe this castle is full of guards.

5733
07:21:35,360 --> 07:21:37,360
Shot and behaviour.

5734
07:21:37,360 --> 07:21:38,360
Get out.

5735
07:21:38,360 --> 07:21:39,360
Anyone wants you here?

5736
07:21:39,360 --> 07:21:40,360
Oh, my ankles.

5737
07:21:40,360 --> 07:21:42,360
I didn't take any fall damage.

5738
07:21:42,360 --> 07:21:43,360
Okay.

5739
07:21:44,360 --> 07:21:45,360
I love your...

5740
07:21:45,360 --> 07:21:47,360
Yeah, you're like when I burst into Scott swinging.

5741
07:21:47,360 --> 07:21:48,360
My wee accent.

5742
07:21:51,360 --> 07:21:53,360
I should do a Scott or some cover.

5743
07:21:53,360 --> 07:21:54,360
I don't know what to do.

5744
07:21:54,360 --> 07:21:55,360
I wanted to do an M&M one,

5745
07:21:55,360 --> 07:21:56,360
but I was like...

5746
07:21:56,360 --> 07:21:58,360
I don't know if it's bordering on cringe.

5747
07:21:59,360 --> 07:22:00,360
She was like...

5748
07:22:01,360 --> 07:22:03,360
I don't know what M&M song I wanted to do.

5749
07:22:03,360 --> 07:22:04,360
I don't know what song.

5750
07:22:04,360 --> 07:22:05,360
I don't know.

5751
07:22:08,360 --> 07:22:09,360
I've got any clue.

5752
07:22:10,360 --> 07:22:12,360
You've got any clue what's going on there?

5753
07:22:12,360 --> 07:22:13,360
No, you didn't.

5754
07:22:13,360 --> 07:22:14,360
You've gone back.

5755
07:22:14,360 --> 07:22:15,360
Sorry.

5756
07:22:17,360 --> 07:22:18,360
You threw me.

5757
07:22:18,360 --> 07:22:20,360
I don't know what one to do.

5758
07:22:20,360 --> 07:22:24,360
I'm beginning to feel like a wee bit of a rap god.

5759
07:22:27,360 --> 07:22:28,360
I don't know.

5760
07:22:29,360 --> 07:22:35,360
Yes, who's back, back, back, back again, again, again.

5761
07:22:36,360 --> 07:22:40,360
Strony's back, back, back, tell a friend.

5762
07:22:40,360 --> 07:22:44,360
Oh, everyone report to the dance floor.

5763
07:22:44,360 --> 07:22:48,360
It's your season to be butt squeezing.

5764
07:22:48,360 --> 07:22:49,360
That made me snore.

5765
07:22:49,360 --> 07:22:50,360
I'm so sorry.

5766
07:22:53,360 --> 07:22:54,360
Touch my body.

5767
07:22:54,360 --> 07:22:56,360
I mean, is it boy just touch my body?

5768
07:22:56,360 --> 07:22:58,360
I mean, girl, just touch my body.

5769
07:22:59,360 --> 07:23:01,360
Because this is the part where the rap breaks down.

5770
07:23:01,360 --> 07:23:02,360
No one moves.

5771
07:23:02,360 --> 07:23:03,360
No one makes a sound.

5772
07:23:03,360 --> 07:23:06,360
I'm just mixing into a ton of different songs, I think.

5773
07:23:07,360 --> 07:23:08,360
Back to reality.

5774
07:23:08,360 --> 07:23:09,360
There goes gravity.

5775
07:23:09,360 --> 07:23:10,360
There goes...

5776
07:23:10,360 --> 07:23:11,360
Doesn't have any.

5777
07:23:11,360 --> 07:23:13,360
There goes gravity again.

5778
07:23:13,360 --> 07:23:14,360
I don't know.

5779
07:23:16,360 --> 07:23:17,360
Okay, that was very lucky.

5780
07:23:17,360 --> 07:23:19,360
You can actually go backwards.

5781
07:23:21,360 --> 07:23:22,360
Are we a big fan of M&M?

5782
07:23:22,360 --> 07:23:23,360
No.

5783
07:23:24,360 --> 07:23:25,360
Not like...

5784
07:23:26,360 --> 07:23:28,360
Oh, I know all the albums and stuff.

5785
07:23:28,360 --> 07:23:29,360
It's just the goofy songs.

5786
07:23:29,360 --> 07:23:30,360
I like it.

5787
07:23:30,360 --> 07:23:31,360
I can't believe it.

5788
07:23:33,360 --> 07:23:35,360
I love Scottish M&M.

5789
07:23:41,360 --> 07:23:42,360
That one's good one.

5790
07:23:50,360 --> 07:23:52,360
The spaghetti on this shirt.

5791
07:23:52,360 --> 07:23:54,360
No, there's vomit on his shirt.

5792
07:23:54,360 --> 07:23:55,360
Mum's spaghetti.

5793
07:23:58,360 --> 07:23:59,360
I'm a jukebox.

5794
07:24:02,360 --> 07:24:04,360
Okay, now we need this as a carry, okay?

5795
07:24:05,360 --> 07:24:06,360
Oh, there goes gravity.

5796
07:24:06,360 --> 07:24:07,360
Oh, there goes a rabbit.

5797
07:24:07,360 --> 07:24:08,360
That's not the lyrics.

5798
07:24:08,360 --> 07:24:09,360
You're teasing me.

5799
07:24:12,360 --> 07:24:14,360
Scottish Kendrick Lamar wins.

5800
07:24:22,360 --> 07:24:23,360
I don't know the words.

5801
07:24:23,360 --> 07:24:25,360
I don't even know if that was Kendrick Lamar.

5802
07:24:25,360 --> 07:24:26,360
I'm going to be honest.

5803
07:24:27,360 --> 07:24:28,360
No, that was Denzel Watt.

5804
07:24:28,360 --> 07:24:29,360
No.

5805
07:24:29,360 --> 07:24:30,360
Wait, hold on.

5806
07:24:31,360 --> 07:24:32,360
Hold on.

5807
07:24:32,360 --> 07:24:33,360
Brain farming.

5808
07:24:33,360 --> 07:24:35,360
Sitting here repeating YouTube work on my Scottish accent.

5809
07:24:35,360 --> 07:24:37,360
I really know many other...

5810
07:24:37,360 --> 07:24:38,360
Right.

5811
07:24:39,360 --> 07:24:42,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5812
07:24:42,360 --> 07:24:44,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5813
07:24:44,360 --> 07:24:46,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5814
07:24:46,360 --> 07:24:48,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5815
07:24:48,360 --> 07:24:50,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5816
07:24:50,360 --> 07:24:52,360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

5817
07:24:52,360 --> 07:24:54,360
You know what's up or won't you?

5818
07:24:54,360 --> 07:24:56,360
That's not really...

5819
07:24:58,360 --> 07:25:00,360
500 accumulative meters.

5820
07:25:00,360 --> 07:25:03,360
500 accumulative meters.

5821
07:25:03,360 --> 07:25:07,360
I don't want to fly up off that fricking building again.

5822
07:25:07,360 --> 07:25:10,360
500 accumulative meters, please.

5823
07:25:15,360 --> 07:25:16,360
I can't believe it.

5824
07:25:17,360 --> 07:25:18,360
That's it.

5825
07:25:18,360 --> 07:25:19,360
Put the tunes on.

5826
07:25:19,360 --> 07:25:21,360
We're rapping in Scots.

5827
07:25:21,360 --> 07:25:26,360
Because how on earth was that not 500 accumulative meters?

5828
07:25:26,360 --> 07:25:30,360
500 accumulative meters.

5829
07:25:30,360 --> 07:25:37,360
I only ask for 500 meters.

5830
07:25:38,360 --> 07:25:39,360
Hmm.

5831
07:25:46,360 --> 07:25:47,360
Talk to my assassins.

5832
07:25:47,360 --> 07:25:49,360
Because Exio ain't listening.

5833
07:25:50,360 --> 07:25:52,360
We suck at rap battle.

5834
07:25:52,360 --> 07:25:54,360
You want us to rap battle each other?

5835
07:25:54,360 --> 07:25:55,360
Honestly?

5836
07:25:56,360 --> 07:25:57,360
Right.

5837
07:25:57,360 --> 07:26:00,360
This is going to be really obviously kind of spoilers if you'd be here.

5838
07:26:00,360 --> 07:26:03,360
Well, it's not really spoilers because it would have to be discussed anyway.

5839
07:26:03,360 --> 07:26:06,360
I really thought it would be fun to have diss tracks made.

5840
07:26:06,360 --> 07:26:08,360
Like make diss tracks on each other.

5841
07:26:09,360 --> 07:26:11,360
So obviously they'd be like,

5842
07:26:11,360 --> 07:26:13,360
Strongly cuttles can't even see your name right.

5843
07:26:13,360 --> 07:26:15,360
Because you're Scottish, you know what I mean?

5844
07:26:15,360 --> 07:26:17,360
If I don't know how to do that,

5845
07:26:17,360 --> 07:26:21,360
I would have to unegronically commission someone to diss each other.

5846
07:26:21,360 --> 07:26:24,360
But I think a diss track on each other would be so funny.

5847
07:26:24,360 --> 07:26:26,360
I know it's brain dead, but I don't know.

5848
07:26:26,360 --> 07:26:27,360
I just want to find out the content that's funny.

5849
07:26:27,360 --> 07:26:29,360
Like interact with each other in that kind of way.

5850
07:26:29,360 --> 07:26:30,360
Words, yeah.

5851
07:26:30,360 --> 07:26:36,360
Like she be caught in bomb or like pretending to be your mom.

5852
07:26:36,360 --> 07:26:42,360
Oh, you know, because you know, she's a male.

5853
07:26:42,360 --> 07:26:45,360
But she hasn't spawned in a child from her loins.

5854
07:26:45,360 --> 07:26:48,360
Like, oh, like, oh, what this, what this,

5855
07:26:48,360 --> 07:26:50,360
but I don't know how like this tracks work.

5856
07:26:50,360 --> 07:26:53,360
I don't know how you make them or anything like that.

5857
07:26:54,360 --> 07:26:58,360
And like Azura Dooley, more like Azura Doo-Gay.

5858
07:26:58,360 --> 07:27:04,360
Oh, I mean Beezoo, more like, I mean, your brother's dead.

5859
07:27:04,360 --> 07:27:13,360
Oh, I see snow paws, more like a brat with just claws.

5860
07:27:13,360 --> 07:27:18,360
Oh, this is awful.

5861
07:27:19,360 --> 07:27:20,360
Merci, modest.

5862
07:27:20,360 --> 07:27:21,360
Yeah, nothing.

5863
07:27:21,360 --> 07:27:24,360
Yeah, your dress wear isn't modest at all.

5864
07:27:24,360 --> 07:27:26,360
You just slagged your dress like a slag.

5865
07:27:30,360 --> 07:27:32,360
Like how do you make diss tracks?

5866
07:27:32,360 --> 07:27:33,360
I don't know.

5867
07:27:39,360 --> 07:27:40,360
That didn't even rain.

5868
07:27:43,360 --> 07:27:44,360
I just don't know how.

5869
07:27:44,360 --> 07:27:46,360
Like how do people think of it?

5870
07:27:46,360 --> 07:27:49,360
Like, you have to go right away and write something.

5871
07:27:52,360 --> 07:27:53,360
I was like that.

5872
07:27:53,360 --> 07:27:55,360
I don't know if you've seen the meme where it's like,

5873
07:27:55,360 --> 07:27:56,360
you're deadly.

5874
07:27:58,360 --> 07:28:01,360
You're deadly nails out of the garden, the scruffy nose.

5875
07:28:03,360 --> 07:28:06,360
Like that's how we end up doing a diss track

5876
07:28:06,360 --> 07:28:09,360
because I feel so much pressure to like say something.

5877
07:28:10,360 --> 07:28:16,360
It's like, it just doesn't make any sense.

5878
07:28:16,360 --> 07:28:19,360
Like, I just don't know how people come up with like actually,

5879
07:28:19,360 --> 07:28:22,360
like, you know how epic rap battles is like so good?

5880
07:28:22,360 --> 07:28:27,360
Like, whose rap flows the dopest Marilyn Monroe's

5881
07:28:27,360 --> 07:28:31,360
upthrown pharaohs, like opposes like Moses or something like that.

5882
07:28:31,360 --> 07:28:34,360
Um, like that is so good.

5883
07:28:34,360 --> 07:28:36,360
And I'm like, how do people know that?

5884
07:28:36,360 --> 07:28:38,360
We can do epic rap battles.

5885
07:28:38,360 --> 07:28:39,360
VTuber style.

5886
07:28:39,360 --> 07:28:40,360
Come on.

5887
07:28:40,360 --> 07:28:41,360
Oh, stop reading my mind.

5888
07:28:41,360 --> 07:28:42,360
Literally though.

5889
07:28:44,360 --> 07:28:45,360
Literally though.

5890
07:28:46,360 --> 07:28:47,360
I should.

5891
07:28:49,360 --> 07:28:50,360
Yeah.

5892
07:28:50,360 --> 07:28:52,360
Yeah, they spend more times on the like,

5893
07:28:52,360 --> 07:28:53,360
get idea wrong.

5894
07:28:56,360 --> 07:28:58,360
Maybe VTuber should do rap battles,

5895
07:28:58,360 --> 07:29:01,360
but like the problem is I don't have any music or lyrical thing.

5896
07:29:01,360 --> 07:29:04,360
So I would have to like go out and commission to do it.

5897
07:29:04,360 --> 07:29:05,360
I don't need to grab VTubers.

5898
07:29:05,360 --> 07:29:07,360
I'd be willing to like let us diss each other.

5899
07:29:07,360 --> 07:29:12,360
Like, oh, I don't even know how I would diss myself.

5900
07:29:14,360 --> 07:29:16,360
Oh, I don't know.

5901
07:29:17,360 --> 07:29:20,360
Probably like, oh, schizophrenic personality disorder.

5902
07:29:20,360 --> 07:29:24,360
Oh, but you're like, that's probably how you get me.

5903
07:29:24,360 --> 07:29:25,360
She's been streaming seven hours.

5904
07:29:25,360 --> 07:29:26,360
That's what you hate.

5905
07:29:26,360 --> 07:29:27,360
Yeah, I am.

5906
07:29:27,360 --> 07:29:28,360
Right.

5907
07:29:28,360 --> 07:29:30,360
Repeat after me.

5908
07:29:30,360 --> 07:29:33,360
500 accumulative mirrors.

5909
07:29:33,360 --> 07:29:35,360
500 accumulative mirrors.

5910
07:29:35,360 --> 07:29:37,360
500 accumulative mirrors.

5911
07:29:37,360 --> 07:29:40,360
500 accumulative mirrors.

5912
07:29:40,360 --> 07:29:43,360
Accumulative mirrors.

5913
07:29:43,360 --> 07:29:46,360
500, please.

5914
07:29:46,360 --> 07:29:52,360
500 accumulative mirrors.

5915
07:29:52,360 --> 07:29:55,360
Because I don't want to do that anymore.

5916
07:29:55,360 --> 07:29:58,360
I'll probably do something else if we don't hit it this time

5917
07:29:58,360 --> 07:30:00,360
and that's okay.

5918
07:30:00,360 --> 07:30:05,360
But we're asking for 500 accumulative mirrors.

5919
07:30:05,360 --> 07:30:06,360
Yay!

5920
07:30:06,360 --> 07:30:07,360
We did it!

5921
07:30:07,360 --> 07:30:08,360
We did it!

5922
07:30:08,360 --> 07:30:10,360
Okay, it takes three times to jump off together.

5923
07:30:10,360 --> 07:30:11,360
Okay.

5924
07:30:11,360 --> 07:30:13,360
Oh, let's do a cheeky air assassination.

5925
07:30:13,360 --> 07:30:14,360
Oh, I can't.

5926
07:30:14,360 --> 07:30:15,360
I'm out of bounds.

5927
07:30:15,360 --> 07:30:18,360
Sorry, just dropping in for the third time today.

5928
07:30:18,360 --> 07:30:21,360
Oh, I just looked up my own scout there.

5929
07:30:21,360 --> 07:30:22,360
We did it.

5930
07:30:22,360 --> 07:30:23,360
We did it.

5931
07:30:23,360 --> 07:30:28,360
Right, now we need to figure out what on earth these guilds want from us.

5932
07:30:28,360 --> 07:30:29,360
Let's see.

5933
07:30:29,360 --> 07:30:30,360
Guild challenges.

5934
07:30:30,360 --> 07:30:31,360
Assassins.

5935
07:30:31,360 --> 07:30:32,360
Like, fully done.

5936
07:30:32,360 --> 07:30:33,360
Yeah, okay.

5937
07:30:33,360 --> 07:30:34,360
Okay, it's done.

5938
07:30:34,360 --> 07:30:35,360
Cheeky Flash.

5939
07:30:35,360 --> 07:30:36,360
Cheeky Flash.

5940
07:30:36,360 --> 07:30:37,360
Right.

5941
07:30:37,360 --> 07:30:38,360
Brutes killed.

5942
07:30:38,360 --> 07:30:39,360
Scaffolding by guards.

5943
07:30:39,360 --> 07:30:41,360
PayPal guards.

5944
07:30:41,360 --> 07:30:47,360
The PayPal guards are back there.

5945
07:30:47,360 --> 07:30:50,360
Guards killed while on horseback.

5946
07:30:50,360 --> 07:30:53,360
Guards on horseback air assassinated.

5947
07:30:53,360 --> 07:30:55,360
Double assassination.

5948
07:30:55,360 --> 07:30:58,360
Five guards disarmed and killed with their own weapon.

5949
07:30:58,360 --> 07:31:00,360
I'm going to be honest, I've actually already done one of that.

5950
07:31:00,360 --> 07:31:01,360
I know for a fact I have.

5951
07:31:01,360 --> 07:31:03,360
I have a five-man kill streak.

5952
07:31:03,360 --> 07:31:05,360
Mm, okay, is there anything easier?

5953
07:31:05,360 --> 07:31:07,360
Oh, we've actually done quite a lot.

5954
07:31:07,360 --> 07:31:11,360
Evade enemies using the crowd or other hiding spots.

5955
07:31:11,360 --> 07:31:14,360
Enemies stationed at a guard post while using a crossbow.

5956
07:31:14,360 --> 07:31:16,360
I actually know how to do that.

5957
07:31:16,360 --> 07:31:22,360
Horses belonging to guards commandeered without killing the rider,

5958
07:31:22,360 --> 07:31:24,360
and guards killed in a smoke bomb.

5959
07:31:24,360 --> 07:31:28,360
Right, we'll do that right now because we can do the smoke bomb.

5960
07:31:28,360 --> 07:31:29,360
Hello.

5961
07:31:29,360 --> 07:31:30,360
Hello.

5962
07:31:30,360 --> 07:31:32,360
I'm going to kill you.

5963
07:31:32,360 --> 07:31:34,360
Oh, that was...

5964
07:31:34,360 --> 07:31:36,360
Right, take your time.

5965
07:31:36,360 --> 07:31:40,360
Right, and then I'm going to get rid of this one.

5966
07:31:40,360 --> 07:31:42,360
Oh, well, I'm going to get double assassination,

5967
07:31:42,360 --> 07:31:46,360
and then I'm going to take his sword.

5968
07:31:46,360 --> 07:31:47,360
Oh, he can.

5969
07:31:47,360 --> 07:31:49,360
He's not weak enough.

5970
07:31:49,360 --> 07:31:52,360
Sugar.

5971
07:31:52,360 --> 07:31:54,360
Uh, right.

5972
07:31:54,360 --> 07:31:57,360
We did the smoke bomb, which is fantastic.

5973
07:31:57,360 --> 07:32:00,360
Um...

5974
07:32:00,360 --> 07:32:02,360
7.68%.

5975
07:32:02,360 --> 07:32:04,360
Is it actually?

5976
07:32:04,360 --> 07:32:05,360
No more kill.

5977
07:32:05,360 --> 07:32:06,360
Actually, I did the coppers kill.

5978
07:32:06,360 --> 07:32:08,360
That's terrible.

5979
07:32:08,360 --> 07:32:10,360
Kilty, kilty, cold bum.

5980
07:32:10,360 --> 07:32:14,360
Did you know when you were killed, you're not supposed to wear any...

5981
07:32:14,360 --> 07:32:16,360
Greeks under it.

5982
07:32:16,360 --> 07:32:20,360
Mm...

5983
07:32:20,360 --> 07:32:22,360
Did I need to write these on a note?

5984
07:32:22,360 --> 07:32:24,360
I think I actually have to.

5985
07:32:24,360 --> 07:32:26,360
Uh...

5986
07:32:26,360 --> 07:32:28,360
Yeah.

5987
07:32:28,360 --> 07:32:29,360
This is like so much.

5988
07:32:29,360 --> 07:32:34,360
Right, the papal guards are...

5989
07:32:34,360 --> 07:32:37,360
actually back across the bridge.

5990
07:32:37,360 --> 07:32:39,360
You know that.

5991
07:32:39,360 --> 07:32:41,360
Excuse me, how about your horse?

5992
07:32:41,360 --> 07:32:42,360
Oh, fine.

5993
07:32:42,360 --> 07:32:46,360
Right, I'll call him on.

5994
07:32:46,360 --> 07:32:49,360
What item do you steal from the other guards?

5995
07:32:49,360 --> 07:32:50,360
I answered...

5996
07:32:50,360 --> 07:32:51,360
Oh, I answered that.

5997
07:32:51,360 --> 07:32:53,360
But it's a bit inappropriate.

5998
07:32:53,360 --> 07:32:57,360
I'm not sure I should say it again.

5999
07:32:57,360 --> 07:32:58,360
Right, here.

6000
07:32:58,360 --> 07:33:00,360
These are where these guards...

6001
07:33:00,360 --> 07:33:02,360
These ones spawn.

6002
07:33:02,360 --> 07:33:05,360
So, we're going to need to like come back and then...

6003
07:33:05,360 --> 07:33:06,360
Oh, don't shoot me.

6004
07:33:06,360 --> 07:33:08,360
That's not nice.

6005
07:33:08,360 --> 07:33:12,360
Whoa, you weren't even aiming at me, bro.

6006
07:33:12,360 --> 07:33:13,360
I don't want to...

6007
07:33:13,360 --> 07:33:14,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6008
07:33:14,360 --> 07:33:15,360
Right, okay, okay.

6009
07:33:15,360 --> 07:33:16,360
Okay, okay, okay.

6010
07:33:16,360 --> 07:33:17,360
You're done.

6011
07:33:17,360 --> 07:33:18,360
You're done.

6012
07:33:18,360 --> 07:33:20,360
Well, because I am, you're dead.

6013
07:33:20,360 --> 07:33:23,360
Don't waste my time.

6014
07:33:23,360 --> 07:33:25,360
Stinks.

6015
07:33:25,360 --> 07:33:26,360
Take that.

6016
07:33:26,360 --> 07:33:28,360
These are the only location...

6017
07:33:28,360 --> 07:33:30,360
I know these type of guards spawn.

6018
07:33:30,360 --> 07:33:33,360
I'm like 99% sure.

6019
07:33:33,360 --> 07:33:38,360
I don't think anyone else spawn here.

6020
07:33:38,360 --> 07:33:48,360
Right, and then you.

6021
07:33:48,360 --> 07:33:49,360
Here you go.

6022
07:33:49,360 --> 07:33:51,360
Here's some money.

6023
07:33:51,360 --> 07:33:52,360
Me.

6024
07:33:52,360 --> 07:33:53,360
Here we go.

6025
07:33:53,360 --> 07:33:54,360
That's my money.

6026
07:33:54,360 --> 07:33:58,360
I don't know.

6027
07:33:58,360 --> 07:34:00,360
This beast is beautiful.

6028
07:34:00,360 --> 07:34:01,360
Beautiful?

6029
07:34:01,360 --> 07:34:07,360
I don't know how to respawn those guys in without like going around doing something else.

6030
07:34:07,360 --> 07:34:14,360
Should we do Quarters on Assignment?

6031
07:34:14,360 --> 07:34:15,360
No.

6032
07:34:15,360 --> 07:34:18,360
I need to do a lot of horse activities.

6033
07:34:18,360 --> 07:34:20,360
That sounds bizarre.

6034
07:34:20,360 --> 07:34:23,360
Out of context.

6035
07:34:23,360 --> 07:34:27,360
Have I got a pen and paper for my brain?

6036
07:34:27,360 --> 07:34:31,360
I don't know.

6037
07:34:31,360 --> 07:34:35,360
I'm literally going to write this on the discord.

6038
07:34:35,360 --> 07:34:40,360
So the girls are like, what the heck are you typing about?

6039
07:34:40,360 --> 07:34:42,360
Right, let's see.

6040
07:34:42,360 --> 07:34:45,360
I need to...

6041
07:34:45,360 --> 07:34:49,360
Right, I've killed four more people.

6042
07:34:49,360 --> 07:34:53,360
I have to like open it and then show it in the next.

6043
07:34:53,360 --> 07:34:56,360
Killstreak and then...

6044
07:34:56,360 --> 07:35:00,360
I need to evade...

6045
07:35:01,360 --> 07:35:04,360
Evade four times or something.

6046
07:35:04,360 --> 07:35:07,360
I've already forgotten the other freaking thing I was supposed to do.

6047
07:35:07,360 --> 07:35:09,360
One enemy stationed at Guard Post.

6048
07:35:09,360 --> 07:35:14,360
Okay, we're actually going to station Guard Post.

6049
07:35:14,360 --> 07:35:18,360
We're actually going to do that in a memory because there's a memory that enables that.

6050
07:35:18,360 --> 07:35:21,360
Horses belonging to guards commandeered.

6051
07:35:21,360 --> 07:35:28,360
Horses yoinked without killing.

6052
07:35:28,360 --> 07:35:30,360
Do you want me to screenshot and post on the discord?

6053
07:35:30,360 --> 07:35:32,360
I just need to do the last one.

6054
07:35:32,360 --> 07:35:34,360
Oh, I can screenshot it.

6055
07:35:34,360 --> 07:35:36,360
I don't even have to type it out.

6056
07:35:36,360 --> 07:35:37,360
Can I screenshot it?

6057
07:35:37,360 --> 07:35:38,360
Did that screenshot work?

6058
07:35:38,360 --> 07:35:40,360
I don't even think I did.

6059
07:35:40,360 --> 07:35:42,360
It did.

6060
07:35:42,360 --> 07:35:44,360
Okay.

6061
07:35:44,360 --> 07:35:46,360
Okay, that worked.

6062
07:35:46,360 --> 07:35:48,360
Okay, it worked.

6063
07:35:48,360 --> 07:35:50,360
I am so smart.

6064
07:35:50,360 --> 07:35:53,360
SMRT.

6065
07:35:53,360 --> 07:35:56,360
Okay, let's see.

6066
07:35:56,360 --> 07:36:01,360
Put that there so I don't miss any donations if someone tips.

6067
07:36:01,360 --> 07:36:04,360
And then put the discord there.

6068
07:36:04,360 --> 07:36:06,360
And now I can...

6069
07:36:06,360 --> 07:36:07,360
Oh wait, no.

6070
07:36:07,360 --> 07:36:08,360
I can't see it.

6071
07:36:08,360 --> 07:36:11,360
Oh, the screenshot makes it so tiny that I can't see it.

6072
07:36:11,360 --> 07:36:12,360
I need to type it out.

6073
07:36:12,360 --> 07:36:13,360
Six.

6074
07:36:13,360 --> 07:36:15,360
Six thieves lured.

6075
07:36:15,360 --> 07:36:16,360
I did it for anyway.

6076
07:36:16,360 --> 07:36:17,360
Now, that's the picture.

6077
07:36:17,360 --> 07:36:20,360
It's because if it's a picture, I need to have the discord in small.

6078
07:36:20,360 --> 07:36:22,360
Sprint uninterrupted.

6079
07:36:22,360 --> 07:36:25,360
Sprint for 300.

6080
07:36:26,360 --> 07:36:28,360
21 leaps of faith.

6081
07:36:28,360 --> 07:36:31,360
I need to do 40 leaps of faith.

6082
07:36:31,360 --> 07:36:34,360
So you don't really do leaps of faith anymore.

6083
07:36:34,360 --> 07:36:36,360
Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.

6084
07:36:36,360 --> 07:36:40,360
Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.

6085
07:36:40,360 --> 07:36:43,360
Unless, but certainly not least,

6086
07:36:43,360 --> 07:36:46,360
jump from a horse to a beam.

6087
07:36:46,360 --> 07:36:48,360
Jump from horse to beam.

6088
07:36:48,360 --> 07:36:51,360
Yeah, there's actually like so much horse related ones.

6089
07:36:51,360 --> 07:36:53,360
This is surprising.

6090
07:36:53,360 --> 07:36:55,360
I didn't actually expect...

6091
07:36:57,360 --> 07:36:59,360
Oh, Azura just messaged me.

6092
07:36:59,360 --> 07:37:00,360
Oh.

6093
07:37:00,360 --> 07:37:02,360
What's she saying?

6094
07:37:03,360 --> 07:37:05,360
Ah, okay.

6095
07:37:06,360 --> 07:37:07,360
It's MRT.

6096
07:37:07,360 --> 07:37:08,360
Oh my god.

6097
07:37:08,360 --> 07:37:11,360
The girls are posting in the not-safe-for-work section of the discord.

6098
07:37:11,360 --> 07:37:13,360
Now look at it.

6099
07:37:17,360 --> 07:37:18,360
I think it may be...

6100
07:37:18,360 --> 07:37:21,360
Oh, it actually may be my gifted artwork.

6101
07:37:21,360 --> 07:37:22,360
Open it.

6102
07:37:24,360 --> 07:37:25,360
It's MRT.

6103
07:37:25,360 --> 07:37:27,360
Oh wait, I've just closed the discord.

6104
07:37:27,360 --> 07:37:28,360
Oops.

6105
07:37:28,360 --> 07:37:31,360
The discord actually holds everything that I need in order to play the game.

6106
07:37:31,360 --> 07:37:33,360
Look at dum-dum.

6107
07:37:33,360 --> 07:37:35,360
It's MRT.

6108
07:37:35,360 --> 07:37:37,360
No, that's Samarty.

6109
07:37:39,360 --> 07:37:41,360
Wow, I can't believe it.

6110
07:37:41,360 --> 07:37:45,360
I might unironically need a third moner for this kind of stuff.

6111
07:37:48,360 --> 07:37:49,360
Okay.

6112
07:37:52,360 --> 07:37:55,360
Someone at Ubisoft is really proud of the horses.

6113
07:37:55,360 --> 07:38:00,360
Honestly, it probably took like a heckish and hellish...

6114
07:38:00,360 --> 07:38:01,360
Oh, wait.

6115
07:38:01,360 --> 07:38:02,360
I'm freaking dumb.

6116
07:38:02,360 --> 07:38:04,360
Why am I so dumb?

6117
07:38:05,360 --> 07:38:06,360
Dum-dum-dum.

6118
07:38:06,360 --> 07:38:07,360
Okay, wait.

6119
07:38:07,360 --> 07:38:08,360
Hold on.

6120
07:38:08,360 --> 07:38:11,360
Hold the freaking telephone.

6121
07:38:12,360 --> 07:38:14,360
Okay, there we go.

6122
07:38:14,360 --> 07:38:16,360
I definitely need a third moner.

6123
07:38:16,360 --> 07:38:20,360
Honestly, I felt that right now as I'm currently trying to like arrange so many things.

6124
07:38:20,360 --> 07:38:22,360
Okay, hydration check.

6125
07:38:31,360 --> 07:38:33,360
I am going to do one...

6126
07:38:33,360 --> 07:38:35,360
Yeah, one of those portrait moners.

6127
07:38:35,360 --> 07:38:38,360
Yeah, definitely like chat-orientating.

6128
07:38:38,360 --> 07:38:39,360
Right.

6129
07:38:39,360 --> 07:38:45,360
Because there's so many horses once, I'm actually going to take us to the thieves district

6130
07:38:45,360 --> 07:38:49,360
if I can find a fast port, which I can at the...

6131
07:38:49,360 --> 07:38:51,360
Rosa in Fiori.

6132
07:38:52,360 --> 07:38:54,360
Merci.

6133
07:38:55,360 --> 07:38:56,360
One hour, 20 minutes.

6134
07:38:56,360 --> 07:38:58,360
Merci.

6135
07:39:00,360 --> 07:39:01,360
Merci.

6136
07:39:09,360 --> 07:39:11,360
Merci didn't know what countdown was.

6137
07:39:11,360 --> 07:39:12,360
Yeah.

6138
07:39:16,360 --> 07:39:17,360
I...

6139
07:39:17,360 --> 07:39:19,360
I'm like...

6140
07:39:19,360 --> 07:39:20,360
All our...

6141
07:39:20,360 --> 07:39:23,360
All like, Merci's senpais are more deceased.

6142
07:39:23,360 --> 07:39:25,360
Oh!

6143
07:39:26,360 --> 07:39:29,360
Merci just catches the street a little bit.

6144
07:39:30,360 --> 07:39:31,360
What?

6145
07:39:31,360 --> 07:39:33,360
I'm dissing my...

6146
07:39:33,360 --> 07:39:35,360
My fellow gen mate,

6147
07:39:35,360 --> 07:39:38,360
but I'm so bad at like dissing because I just...

6148
07:39:38,360 --> 07:39:40,360
Like, I...

6149
07:39:40,360 --> 07:39:44,360
Oh, I need to put you in the scaffold and please let me grab you.

6150
07:39:44,360 --> 07:39:45,360
No, no, no.

6151
07:39:45,360 --> 07:39:46,360
I don't want to fight.

6152
07:39:46,360 --> 07:39:47,360
I don't want to fight.

6153
07:39:47,360 --> 07:39:48,360
I don't want to fight.

6154
07:39:48,360 --> 07:39:49,360
Please, can I grab you?

6155
07:39:49,360 --> 07:39:50,360
Can I grab you?

6156
07:39:50,360 --> 07:39:52,360
Wait, I can't grab them when they're in.

6157
07:39:52,360 --> 07:39:53,360
Right.

6158
07:39:53,360 --> 07:39:55,360
That's two of three.

6159
07:39:55,360 --> 07:39:56,360
Ah!

6160
07:39:56,360 --> 07:39:58,360
Leave me alone!

6161
07:39:58,360 --> 07:40:01,360
Is there any more scaffolding?

6162
07:40:01,360 --> 07:40:06,360
If there's more scaffolding, now's the time to reveal yourself.

6163
07:40:09,360 --> 07:40:11,360
There is!

6164
07:40:12,360 --> 07:40:14,360
Please come this way.

6165
07:40:14,360 --> 07:40:15,360
Please come this way.

6166
07:40:15,360 --> 07:40:17,360
Oh, look at this lovely scaffolding

6167
07:40:17,360 --> 07:40:19,360
that someone's put up for it.

6168
07:40:19,360 --> 07:40:20,360
Damn, she cooking.

6169
07:40:20,360 --> 07:40:22,360
Merci, what's she doing?

6170
07:40:22,360 --> 07:40:24,360
Zero, I'm trying to diss tracks,

6171
07:40:24,360 --> 07:40:26,360
but I'm absolutely rubbish at them.

6172
07:40:28,360 --> 07:40:30,360
And I'm like, trying to pretend I know how to

6173
07:40:30,360 --> 07:40:31,360
frickin' diss tracks,

6174
07:40:31,360 --> 07:40:33,360
but it's plausible.

6175
07:40:38,360 --> 07:40:39,360
Now, you're not coming over.

6176
07:40:39,360 --> 07:40:40,360
Come here, right now.

6177
07:40:40,360 --> 07:40:41,360
Come here.

6178
07:40:41,360 --> 07:40:42,360
Come here.

6179
07:40:44,360 --> 07:40:45,360
I'm wondering...

6180
07:40:45,360 --> 07:40:46,360
Oh, this is terrible.

6181
07:40:46,360 --> 07:40:48,360
This isn't going to work out well, I don't think.

6182
07:40:48,360 --> 07:40:49,360
Tell these two.

6183
07:40:49,360 --> 07:40:52,360
Right, we've got a double assassination out of that.

6184
07:40:52,360 --> 07:40:53,360
No!

6185
07:40:53,360 --> 07:40:54,360
It's you.

6186
07:40:54,360 --> 07:40:57,360
You're a bit too efficient at your job.

6187
07:40:57,360 --> 07:41:00,360
I didn't actually want to assassinate them.

6188
07:41:00,360 --> 07:41:02,360
I'm talking about a third monitor,

6189
07:41:02,360 --> 07:41:04,360
and I still only have one.

6190
07:41:04,360 --> 07:41:05,360
Ah!

6191
07:41:05,360 --> 07:41:08,360
If you're going to be sure, you might need three.

6192
07:41:11,360 --> 07:41:13,360
Momet and Mummy are here.

6193
07:41:13,360 --> 07:41:14,360
Yeah.

6194
07:41:14,360 --> 07:41:16,360
Or Mommy.

6195
07:41:18,360 --> 07:41:19,360
Wait, what do I need to do?

6196
07:41:19,360 --> 07:41:21,360
I need to go do horse missions!

6197
07:41:21,360 --> 07:41:24,360
Right, we're going to go to the Thieves Guild,

6198
07:41:24,360 --> 07:41:27,360
which I totally know the name of.

6199
07:41:28,360 --> 07:41:30,360
The Thieves Guild.

6200
07:41:30,360 --> 07:41:33,360
Why is it all the way down here?

6201
07:41:34,360 --> 07:41:36,360
I feel like the last one.

6202
07:41:36,360 --> 07:41:38,360
You know what?

6203
07:41:41,360 --> 07:41:42,360
Yeah, you're dumb.

6204
07:41:42,360 --> 07:41:44,360
Mm-hmm, you're dumb.

6205
07:41:44,360 --> 07:41:45,360
She would never diss me.

6206
07:41:45,360 --> 07:41:47,360
She would love me.

6207
07:41:47,360 --> 07:41:50,360
Oh, I can't remember what my diss was on you.

6208
07:41:50,360 --> 07:41:52,360
I thought I was like Azuridule, more like...

6209
07:41:52,360 --> 07:41:53,360
Oh, that's what I was like.

6210
07:41:53,360 --> 07:41:55,360
Azuridule, more like Azuriduke.

6211
07:41:55,360 --> 07:41:58,360
That's really like the most rubbish thing.

6212
07:41:58,360 --> 07:42:00,360
Like nonsense.

6213
07:42:00,360 --> 07:42:01,360
What's wrong with you?

6214
07:42:01,360 --> 07:42:02,360
Visual number of hurricanes.

6215
07:42:02,360 --> 07:42:03,360
Are we allowed to recommend?

6216
07:42:03,360 --> 07:42:04,360
Yeah, you can always recommend stuff.

6217
07:42:04,360 --> 07:42:05,360
That's not a problem at all.

6218
07:42:05,360 --> 07:42:08,360
Right, horse activities.

6219
07:42:08,360 --> 07:42:11,360
Right, I need to run 300 meters uninterrupted.

6220
07:42:11,360 --> 07:42:14,360
You can do it at this section super duper easily.

6221
07:42:14,360 --> 07:42:16,360
Definitely recommend going to the Thieves Guild

6222
07:42:16,360 --> 07:42:18,360
in order to do this.

6223
07:42:18,360 --> 07:42:20,360
Azuridule, more like Fontal Abyssum.

6224
07:42:25,360 --> 07:42:29,360
Your third monitor should be used exclusively to ignore chat.

6225
07:42:29,360 --> 07:42:31,360
Why would I ignore chat?

6226
07:42:31,360 --> 07:42:33,360
It's literally the best part of streaming.

6227
07:42:36,360 --> 07:42:38,360
Other than, like, when the gameplay gets intense,

6228
07:42:38,360 --> 07:42:41,360
then, uh, some things need to be slowed down.

6229
07:42:41,360 --> 07:42:43,360
Is there, like, a perfect circle here?

6230
07:42:43,360 --> 07:42:45,360
Can I just go in circles?

6231
07:42:45,360 --> 07:42:47,360
If you get motion sick, close your eyes.

6232
07:42:47,360 --> 07:42:48,360
Mercy, look away.

6233
07:42:48,360 --> 07:42:50,360
Don't watch stream here, man.

6234
07:42:53,360 --> 07:42:56,360
What would happen if Ezio had to turn for the feature bar?

6235
07:42:56,360 --> 07:42:58,360
I think he'd have a lot of fan girls.

6236
07:42:59,360 --> 07:43:01,360
Ay, hold on.

6237
07:43:01,360 --> 07:43:03,360
Alright, what do I need to next?

6238
07:43:07,360 --> 07:43:09,360
What?

6239
07:43:09,360 --> 07:43:12,360
How have I got the Thieves Guild crest?

6240
07:43:12,360 --> 07:43:13,360
I didn't do it.

6241
07:43:13,360 --> 07:43:17,360
More like Stacey, these Milkretains, literally.

6242
07:43:21,360 --> 07:43:25,360
She'd be calling herself a dumb winner.

6243
07:43:25,360 --> 07:43:26,360
Winner.

6244
07:43:26,360 --> 07:43:28,360
Protide name was literally cotton bomb.

6245
07:43:28,360 --> 07:43:31,360
Yeah, get wrecked, yeah.

6246
07:43:34,360 --> 07:43:37,360
Your dedication towards Ezio is highly respectable.

6247
07:43:37,360 --> 07:43:39,360
It's a good game, what can I say?

6248
07:43:39,360 --> 07:43:40,360
Right.

6249
07:43:40,360 --> 07:43:44,360
Am I supposed to kill from being on a horse?

6250
07:43:44,360 --> 07:43:46,360
Guards killed well on horseback.

6251
07:43:46,360 --> 07:43:48,360
Let's go!

6252
07:43:49,360 --> 07:43:51,360
Oh, hold on, let's try again.

6253
07:43:51,360 --> 07:43:53,360
Hold on, let me get back on the horse.

6254
07:43:53,360 --> 07:43:54,360
Sorry, sorry.

6255
07:43:54,360 --> 07:43:56,360
Let me quit, excuse me, excuse me.

6256
07:43:56,360 --> 07:43:59,360
Let me literally get back on the horse.

6257
07:43:59,360 --> 07:44:02,360
I kid you not, literally let me get back on the horse.

6258
07:44:03,360 --> 07:44:06,360
Stop, I know you're scared, but we need to try that again.

6259
07:44:06,360 --> 07:44:09,360
I messed that up really badly, hold on.

6260
07:44:09,360 --> 07:44:11,360
Okay, let's try that again.

6261
07:44:11,360 --> 07:44:14,360
I've been destroyed, decimated.

6262
07:44:14,360 --> 07:44:19,360
Just like how decimated your skin is when you interact with rabbits,

6263
07:44:19,360 --> 07:44:20,360
because you're allergic.

6264
07:44:20,360 --> 07:44:22,360
Ha, ha, ha, you're allergic.

6265
07:44:22,360 --> 07:44:24,360
Yeah, I'm so good at doing this.

6266
07:44:24,360 --> 07:44:26,360
This is awful, I'm so sorry.

6267
07:44:26,360 --> 07:44:29,360
This is absolutely horrendous, I'm just gonna stop talking.

6268
07:44:33,360 --> 07:44:34,360
Oh.

6269
07:44:36,360 --> 07:44:37,360
I'm a horseback.

6270
07:44:37,360 --> 07:44:41,360
Showing it on an old space commercial.

6271
07:44:41,360 --> 07:44:44,360
Wow, low blow, just like the hate of rabbits.

6272
07:44:44,360 --> 07:44:46,360
Oh, ooh.

6273
07:44:48,360 --> 07:44:50,360
They just make my throat close now.

6274
07:44:50,360 --> 07:44:53,360
Literally put you in anaphylactic shock.

6275
07:44:53,360 --> 07:44:55,360
Oh, nothing measured though.

6276
07:44:55,360 --> 07:44:57,360
Yeah.

6277
07:44:57,360 --> 07:45:01,360
Okay, retconning the model we gave you right now.

6278
07:45:01,360 --> 07:45:03,360
Holy crap.

6279
07:45:03,360 --> 07:45:05,360
Double air assassination.

6280
07:45:05,360 --> 07:45:07,360
Oh, it actually worked.

6281
07:45:07,360 --> 07:45:08,360
Wow, okay.

6282
07:45:08,360 --> 07:45:09,360
Owie.

6283
07:45:09,360 --> 07:45:10,360
Wait, hold on.

6284
07:45:10,360 --> 07:45:11,360
Horse, come back.

6285
07:45:11,360 --> 07:45:12,360
Stop being scared.

6286
07:45:12,360 --> 07:45:14,360
Where did the horse go?

6287
07:45:14,360 --> 07:45:15,360
Is it?

6288
07:45:15,360 --> 07:45:16,360
Oh, right, fine.

6289
07:45:16,360 --> 07:45:18,360
I'm just calling my recruits in.

6290
07:45:19,360 --> 07:45:20,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6291
07:45:20,360 --> 07:45:21,360
We don't do this.

6292
07:45:21,360 --> 07:45:23,360
Get me here, get me.

6293
07:45:23,360 --> 07:45:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the people are fighting back.

6294
07:45:26,360 --> 07:45:27,360
Take that.

6295
07:45:27,360 --> 07:45:29,360
And this is stinky, stinky.

6296
07:45:29,360 --> 07:45:31,360
Wait, that missed?

6297
07:45:31,360 --> 07:45:33,360
Oh, well, I'll let this guy control that.

6298
07:45:33,360 --> 07:45:34,360
Where's my horse?

6299
07:45:34,360 --> 07:45:35,360
There's my horse.

6300
07:45:35,360 --> 07:45:37,360
Okay, we did this.

6301
07:45:37,360 --> 07:45:41,360
We need to just go around killing more guards from horseback.

6302
07:45:41,360 --> 07:45:44,360
And then once that one's done, we'll move on to the next one.

6303
07:45:44,360 --> 07:45:47,360
Hello, are there any guards?

6304
07:45:48,360 --> 07:45:50,360
It seemed quieter.

6305
07:45:50,360 --> 07:45:53,360
Hello, are there any guards?

6306
07:45:56,360 --> 07:45:59,360
I get turned into a horse because they get...

6307
07:45:59,360 --> 07:46:02,360
Oh, would you want to be a horse feature?

6308
07:46:04,360 --> 07:46:08,360
If I would change into another animal,

6309
07:46:10,360 --> 07:46:13,360
I'd maybe make you...

6310
07:46:13,360 --> 07:46:15,360
What would I make you?

6311
07:46:15,360 --> 07:46:19,360
Thank goodness I'm not on the development team anymore when it comes to that shiz.

6312
07:46:19,360 --> 07:46:22,360
Don't worry, you're not getting any more bad names.

6313
07:46:22,360 --> 07:46:23,360
No.

6314
07:46:23,360 --> 07:46:24,360
No.

6315
07:46:25,360 --> 07:46:26,360
Hi, Jack.

6316
07:46:26,360 --> 07:46:28,360
I'm to commandeer a horse without killing.

6317
07:46:28,360 --> 07:46:30,360
Okay, so that's one for the commandeering.

6318
07:46:30,360 --> 07:46:33,360
Oh, my horse has like a little backpack now.

6319
07:46:36,360 --> 07:46:38,360
Got a little backpack on the horse?

6320
07:46:38,360 --> 07:46:41,360
Okay, so that just need to like keep running around, hoping to run into...

6321
07:46:41,360 --> 07:46:43,360
Okay, here we go.

6322
07:46:45,360 --> 07:46:47,360
Okay, that was one more.

6323
07:46:49,360 --> 07:46:52,360
Okay, we're going to call in the assassins.

6324
07:46:53,360 --> 07:46:56,360
As soon as they get on a horse, I don't like it.

6325
07:46:56,360 --> 07:46:57,360
I get scared.

6326
07:46:57,360 --> 07:46:58,360
Ooh!

6327
07:46:58,360 --> 07:47:01,360
Oh, that was guard on horseback assassination.

6328
07:47:01,360 --> 07:47:03,360
That was good, that was good.

6329
07:47:03,360 --> 07:47:06,360
There's only been like three surprising ones.

6330
07:47:07,360 --> 07:47:10,360
Let's see if we can do another double, maybe?

6331
07:47:10,360 --> 07:47:12,360
Yeah, okay, nice double.

6332
07:47:12,360 --> 07:47:14,360
We're racking up their numbers really quick.

6333
07:47:15,360 --> 07:47:17,360
Alright, I'll let the assassins deal with this.

6334
07:47:17,360 --> 07:47:19,360
I'm going to get this guy.

6335
07:47:19,360 --> 07:47:20,360
I'm getting out of here.

6336
07:47:20,360 --> 07:47:22,360
No, you're literally in my way.

6337
07:47:25,360 --> 07:47:28,360
Horse features also have a very big buff because of the horse.

6338
07:47:33,360 --> 07:47:37,360
Alright, we need to get back on a horsey-worsey.

6339
07:47:38,360 --> 07:47:40,360
Hello!

6340
07:47:41,360 --> 07:47:43,360
And then...

6341
07:47:44,360 --> 07:47:49,360
We're getting there, we're slowly whittling it down to not much...

6342
07:47:49,360 --> 07:47:51,360
Oh, I'm stuck on a rock.

6343
07:47:54,360 --> 07:47:57,360
Alright, enemies, enemies, enemies.

6344
07:47:57,360 --> 07:47:59,360
Oh, who we got, who we got?

6345
07:47:59,360 --> 07:48:02,360
I just need to hijack without killing.

6346
07:48:02,360 --> 07:48:05,360
Thank you, so that's two for ten.

6347
07:48:06,360 --> 07:48:11,360
That's two for ten for commandeering a horse.

6348
07:48:16,360 --> 07:48:20,360
I need to do the hide spot things, so maybe I'll go into the spale here in time.

6349
07:48:20,360 --> 07:48:21,360
I don't count.

6350
07:48:21,360 --> 07:48:22,360
Oh, rush.

6351
07:48:23,360 --> 07:48:24,360
What was an enemy back here?

6352
07:48:24,360 --> 07:48:25,360
What was it?

6353
07:48:25,360 --> 07:48:26,360
Oh, right, you.

6354
07:48:26,360 --> 07:48:27,360
Right, you're three of ten.

6355
07:48:27,360 --> 07:48:29,360
Thank you very much.

6356
07:48:31,360 --> 07:48:32,360
Appreciate it.

6357
07:48:33,360 --> 07:48:36,360
Actually, I'm going to go for these guys because they're just easy.

6358
07:48:39,360 --> 07:48:40,360
Oh, pardon me.

6359
07:48:40,360 --> 07:48:42,360
I'm just calling the assassins in.

6360
07:48:43,360 --> 07:48:44,360
No, stop running away.

6361
07:48:44,360 --> 07:48:46,360
I know it's scary when I start.

6362
07:48:46,360 --> 07:48:49,360
Oh, hijack, thank you very much.

6363
07:48:50,360 --> 07:48:54,360
Wait, if he keeps going on horses, can I just farm him?

6364
07:48:54,360 --> 07:48:55,360
Farm him?

6365
07:49:00,360 --> 07:49:02,360
Oh, no, my assassins are going to get up.

6366
07:49:02,360 --> 07:49:04,360
Okay, I have learned.

6367
07:49:05,360 --> 07:49:06,360
Today I have learned.

6368
07:49:06,360 --> 07:49:07,360
Let me get this guy here.

6369
07:49:09,360 --> 07:49:12,360
I think I can just farm him over and over again.

6370
07:49:12,360 --> 07:49:17,360
And because I jump off my horse to do it, he jumps on main automatically.

6371
07:49:17,360 --> 07:49:20,360
Right, what, what was that, like five?

6372
07:49:21,360 --> 07:49:23,360
So he's going to get on the horse.

6373
07:49:24,360 --> 07:49:25,360
Six.

6374
07:49:27,360 --> 07:49:28,360
Okay.

6375
07:49:31,360 --> 07:49:33,360
Oh, my goodness.

6376
07:49:33,360 --> 07:49:38,360
Seven grand theft dressage, but I didn't get the thing yet.

6377
07:49:39,360 --> 07:49:41,360
That's funny as anything though.

6378
07:49:42,360 --> 07:49:43,360
Oh, my God.

6379
07:49:43,360 --> 07:49:45,360
This is actually really funny.

6380
07:49:45,360 --> 07:49:47,360
Eight, I think eight.

6381
07:49:49,360 --> 07:49:51,360
Nine.

6382
07:49:52,360 --> 07:49:54,360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

6383
07:49:54,360 --> 07:49:55,360
Hey, there we go.

6384
07:49:55,360 --> 07:49:56,360
There we go.

6385
07:49:56,360 --> 07:49:57,360
Beautiful, beautiful.

6386
07:50:01,360 --> 07:50:04,360
Right, a few more kills from horseback.

6387
07:50:04,360 --> 07:50:05,360
That was good.

6388
07:50:05,360 --> 07:50:08,360
All he wants to do is ride the horse on his horse.

6389
07:50:08,360 --> 07:50:10,360
I just kept yanking over and over again.

6390
07:50:11,360 --> 07:50:15,360
I mean, did he really want the horse if he just made it that easy for me?

6391
07:50:16,360 --> 07:50:18,360
Okay, we're at the bath house.

6392
07:50:18,360 --> 07:50:20,360
I recognize this part of the map.

6393
07:50:22,360 --> 07:50:25,360
I think we're going to have to go in a bit more to find more guards.

6394
07:50:25,360 --> 07:50:27,360
I'm literally just going on the outskirts there.

6395
07:50:27,360 --> 07:50:28,360
On the map.

6396
07:50:30,360 --> 07:50:36,360
A few more assassinations from a horse while on horseback.

6397
07:50:37,360 --> 07:50:38,360
Well on horseback?

6398
07:50:38,360 --> 07:50:40,360
Oh, no, hold on, let me check.

6399
07:50:41,360 --> 07:50:42,360
Very quickly.

6400
07:50:45,360 --> 07:50:47,360
Stoney has DNA, DNA.

6401
07:50:48,360 --> 07:50:50,360
Is this the horse one?

6402
07:50:50,360 --> 07:50:53,360
Guards on horseback, air assassinate.

6403
07:50:53,360 --> 07:50:55,360
Guards killed while on horse.

6404
07:50:55,360 --> 07:50:56,360
While on horseback.

6405
07:50:56,360 --> 07:51:02,360
Okay, I'm going to get my crossbow out and we're literally just going on a spree then.

6406
07:51:03,360 --> 07:51:05,360
I need to stay on horseback now.

6407
07:51:07,360 --> 07:51:08,360
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

6408
07:51:08,360 --> 07:51:15,360
I need to go to the wards, the Colosseum, which is this way.

6409
07:51:15,360 --> 07:51:16,360
What's that?

6410
07:51:16,360 --> 07:51:19,360
You've played assassins, creeds so much that you recognize which way you need to go.

6411
07:51:19,360 --> 07:51:21,360
Maybe, maybe not.

6412
07:51:23,360 --> 07:51:25,360
There should be four enemies here.

6413
07:51:27,360 --> 07:51:29,360
I'm surprised how casual this is.

6414
07:51:35,360 --> 07:51:37,360
Don't peel me off, don't peel me off, I'm scared.

6415
07:51:37,360 --> 07:51:39,360
Stop, you're scaring me.

6416
07:51:40,360 --> 07:51:41,360
That's four.

6417
07:51:42,360 --> 07:51:43,360
Okay, there we go.

6418
07:51:46,360 --> 07:51:49,360
Oh, wait.

6419
07:51:50,360 --> 07:51:52,360
We need to do the beam trick.

6420
07:51:52,360 --> 07:51:53,360
I think this is the beam trick.

6421
07:51:54,360 --> 07:51:55,360
That was the beam trick.

6422
07:51:55,360 --> 07:51:57,360
Right, we need to do that 19 more times.

6423
07:51:57,360 --> 07:51:58,360
I'm not even kidding.

6424
07:51:58,360 --> 07:52:00,360
Hold on, and we need to lure the guards.

6425
07:52:00,360 --> 07:52:02,360
Come here, come, come, come.

6426
07:52:03,360 --> 07:52:04,360
Lure these men away.

6427
07:52:06,360 --> 07:52:07,360
No, lure them away?

6428
07:52:07,360 --> 07:52:08,360
Yeah, there you go.

6429
07:52:09,360 --> 07:52:16,360
Right, we basically need to go back and forth over and over, jumping on this beam.

6430
07:52:17,360 --> 07:52:19,360
No, you didn't do it, it's you.

6431
07:52:19,360 --> 07:52:21,360
That wasn't it, that wasn't the trick.

6432
07:52:21,360 --> 07:52:26,360
We needed to do that flip you saw, literally 19 times more.

6433
07:52:26,360 --> 07:52:28,360
Do a flip, it's you.

6434
07:52:28,360 --> 07:52:31,360
Right, and I want to...

6435
07:52:31,360 --> 07:52:33,360
No, it's you, try again.

6436
07:52:34,360 --> 07:52:37,360
Do I need to jump on a specific part?

6437
07:52:38,360 --> 07:52:39,360
Really specific.

6438
07:52:43,360 --> 07:52:46,360
Jump, hold, flip.

6439
07:52:46,360 --> 07:52:48,360
Okay, jump, hold, flip.

6440
07:52:49,360 --> 07:52:51,360
So I need to tap A and then hold it.

6441
07:52:51,360 --> 07:52:52,360
So 18 more times.

6442
07:52:55,360 --> 07:52:57,360
Jump, hold, no.

6443
07:52:57,360 --> 07:52:59,360
Okay, I think we needed a bit more speed that time.

6444
07:52:59,360 --> 07:53:02,360
Give us a bit more energy, a bit more energy.

6445
07:53:02,360 --> 07:53:05,360
Little bull's eye, a little horsey-worsey.

6446
07:53:06,360 --> 07:53:08,360
Do a bit of run-up for it, hold.

6447
07:53:09,360 --> 07:53:13,360
And that horse just blocked us and jump and hold.

6448
07:53:13,360 --> 07:53:15,360
Why did that not work that time?

6449
07:53:17,360 --> 07:53:19,360
I'm not sure why that didn't work.

6450
07:53:22,360 --> 07:53:24,360
Yeah, but while talking with those, it's not bad.

6451
07:53:25,360 --> 07:53:27,360
I'm doing it in the corner of my eye.

6452
07:53:27,360 --> 07:53:29,360
And jump.

6453
07:53:29,360 --> 07:53:33,360
Okay, I purposely did that a bit later than when I would have selected A.

6454
07:53:33,360 --> 07:53:36,360
So it's 17 more.

6455
07:53:37,360 --> 07:53:39,360
I can do it.

6456
07:53:39,360 --> 07:53:41,360
Bitly, hold.

6457
07:53:41,360 --> 07:53:43,360
No, okay, right.

6458
07:53:45,360 --> 07:53:47,360
You're gonna have to bear with me, bear with me.

6459
07:53:47,360 --> 07:53:51,360
A is in this room right now because you're gonna have to bear with me.

6460
07:53:51,360 --> 07:53:54,360
Bear with me, let me take a few seconds.

6461
07:53:55,360 --> 07:53:58,360
Ready, steady, jump and hold.

6462
07:53:58,360 --> 07:54:01,360
Yay, 16 more times, let's go.

6463
07:54:02,360 --> 07:54:05,360
I definitely seem to be able to do it coming from that way.

6464
07:54:05,360 --> 07:54:07,360
I'm wondering if I can't do it this way.

6465
07:54:07,360 --> 07:54:09,360
Maybe there's like a hidden bug.

6466
07:54:09,360 --> 07:54:11,360
And a jump and a hold.

6467
07:54:13,360 --> 07:54:15,360
Maybe it's a one-way type of thing.

6468
07:54:17,360 --> 07:54:19,360
We're getting there.

6469
07:54:19,360 --> 07:54:21,360
70 more, let's go, literally.

6470
07:54:21,360 --> 07:54:23,360
It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this.

6471
07:54:23,360 --> 07:54:25,360
Really arbitrary.

6472
07:54:25,360 --> 07:54:29,360
Okay, really, really premature with that one.

6473
07:54:29,360 --> 07:54:31,360
I'm not even gonna, no, no.

6474
07:54:31,360 --> 07:54:33,360
The horse.

6475
07:54:35,360 --> 07:54:37,360
Let's try that again.

6476
07:54:39,360 --> 07:54:42,360
I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely.

6477
07:54:42,360 --> 07:54:44,360
Hold, no.

6478
07:54:46,360 --> 07:54:49,360
I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes

6479
07:54:49,360 --> 07:54:51,360
and not other times.

6480
07:54:51,360 --> 07:54:55,360
My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like

6481
07:54:55,360 --> 07:54:57,360
this pathing mess up.

6482
07:54:57,360 --> 07:54:59,360
Jump, hold.

6483
07:54:59,360 --> 07:55:01,360
No, why?

6484
07:55:01,360 --> 07:55:03,360
What is going on?

6485
07:55:03,360 --> 07:55:05,360
What is going on?

6486
07:55:05,360 --> 07:55:07,360
I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that.

6487
07:55:07,360 --> 07:55:09,360
Right, we'll do a really big run up just because we can.

6488
07:55:11,360 --> 07:55:14,360
Okay, so run and then stand.

6489
07:55:14,360 --> 07:55:16,360
And then jump and hold.

6490
07:55:16,360 --> 07:55:18,360
Okay, okay, it's speed.

6491
07:55:18,360 --> 07:55:20,360
It's speed. We need a bigger run up.

6492
07:55:20,360 --> 07:55:22,360
15 more times.

6493
07:55:22,360 --> 07:55:24,360
15 more times.

6494
07:55:24,360 --> 07:55:27,360
Okay, big, big long journey.

6495
07:55:27,360 --> 07:55:29,360
One, two, three, four, five.

6496
07:55:29,360 --> 07:55:31,360
Jump and hold.

6497
07:55:33,360 --> 07:55:35,360
15 is still the number.

6498
07:55:35,360 --> 07:55:36,360
We can't do it.

6499
07:55:36,360 --> 07:55:39,360
This is not at all.

6500
07:55:39,360 --> 07:55:41,360
A bit of a grind.

6501
07:55:41,360 --> 07:55:43,360
A bit more of a grind than I was expecting.

6502
07:55:43,360 --> 07:55:45,360
Run.

6503
07:55:45,360 --> 07:55:47,360
Jump and hold.

6504
07:55:50,360 --> 07:55:53,360
I honestly don't understand what's determining

6505
07:55:53,360 --> 07:55:55,360
the number.

6506
07:55:55,360 --> 07:55:57,360
Maybe do the middle one.

6507
07:55:57,360 --> 07:55:59,360
Like jump late.

6508
07:55:59,360 --> 07:56:01,360
I think you may be right.

6509
07:56:01,360 --> 07:56:03,360
We'll jump late on purpose this time.

6510
07:56:03,360 --> 07:56:05,360
Okay.

6511
07:56:05,360 --> 07:56:07,360
Not doing it.

6512
07:56:07,360 --> 07:56:09,360
Not doing it.

6513
07:56:09,360 --> 07:56:11,360
We'll jump now and hold.

6514
07:56:11,360 --> 07:56:13,360
No.

6515
07:56:13,360 --> 07:56:15,360
Thank you for at least coming back.

6516
07:56:15,360 --> 07:56:17,360
Hmm.

6517
07:56:17,360 --> 07:56:19,360
15 is better than 20.

6518
07:56:19,360 --> 07:56:21,360
And 14 is better than 15.

6519
07:56:21,360 --> 07:56:23,360
Whoa.

6520
07:56:23,360 --> 07:56:25,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6521
07:56:25,360 --> 07:56:27,360
No.

6522
07:56:27,360 --> 07:56:29,360
No.

6523
07:56:29,360 --> 07:56:31,360
No.

6524
07:56:31,360 --> 07:56:33,360
No.

6525
07:56:33,360 --> 07:56:35,360
Is the appropriate response

6526
07:56:35,360 --> 07:56:37,360
after seeing that out loud?

6527
07:56:39,360 --> 07:56:41,360
Oh, right.

6528
07:56:41,360 --> 07:56:43,360
No, that didn't work.

6529
07:56:43,360 --> 07:56:45,360
I think I'm getting speed blocked or something.

6530
07:56:45,360 --> 07:56:47,360
Because this is...

6531
07:56:47,360 --> 07:56:49,360
What?

6532
07:56:49,360 --> 07:56:51,360
What?

6533
07:56:51,360 --> 07:56:53,360
13.

6534
07:56:53,360 --> 07:56:55,360
No, not 13.

6535
07:56:55,360 --> 07:56:57,360
Close to 13.

6536
07:56:57,360 --> 07:56:59,360
We can do it.

6537
07:56:59,360 --> 07:57:01,360
I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like...

6538
07:57:01,360 --> 07:57:03,360
He's like trying not to be like a bit

6539
07:57:03,360 --> 07:57:05,360
disgruntled with like

6540
07:57:05,360 --> 07:57:07,360
the dwarves showing up.

6541
07:57:07,360 --> 07:57:09,360
And I'm like, ooh, ooh, it's fine.

6542
07:57:09,360 --> 07:57:11,360
It's fine.

6543
07:57:11,360 --> 07:57:13,360
No.

6544
07:57:13,360 --> 07:57:15,360
This is very pun.

6545
07:57:15,360 --> 07:57:17,360
There is a war going on.

6546
07:57:18,360 --> 07:57:20,360
Maybe you have to be under the beams.

6547
07:57:20,360 --> 07:57:22,360
Okay, I'll definitely...

6548
07:57:22,360 --> 07:57:24,360
Like, I'll super delay it this time.

6549
07:57:24,360 --> 07:57:26,360
Like, genuinely super delay it.

6550
07:57:28,360 --> 07:57:30,360
No, he just jumped straight on it.

6551
07:57:30,360 --> 07:57:32,360
If you do it, like, super delayed.

6552
07:57:32,360 --> 07:57:34,360
Okay.

6553
07:57:34,360 --> 07:57:36,360
Hmm.

6554
07:57:36,360 --> 07:57:38,360
Curious, curious, right?

6555
07:57:38,360 --> 07:57:40,360
I'll try again.

6556
07:57:40,360 --> 07:57:42,360
Because 14...

6557
07:57:43,360 --> 07:57:45,360
Like, I can do this, honestly.

6558
07:57:45,360 --> 07:57:47,360
It's just so...

6559
07:57:47,360 --> 07:57:49,360
I'm trying to avoid that guy.

6560
07:57:49,360 --> 07:57:51,360
I'll try to avoid that guy.

6561
07:57:51,360 --> 07:57:53,360
I think I just need to let the horse

6562
07:57:53,360 --> 07:57:55,360
maybe directly steer,

6563
07:57:55,360 --> 07:57:57,360
even if the horse is a little off.

6564
07:57:57,360 --> 07:57:59,360
Because the steering...

6565
07:57:59,360 --> 07:58:01,360
As soon as I stand on the horse's saddle,

6566
07:58:01,360 --> 07:58:03,360
the steering...

6567
07:58:04,360 --> 07:58:06,360
Oh.

6568
07:58:06,360 --> 07:58:08,360
What is it? I don't know.

6569
07:58:08,360 --> 07:58:10,360
So, I just realized since you're in Australia,

6570
07:58:10,360 --> 07:58:12,360
does that mean you've been streaming since 3am?

6571
07:58:12,360 --> 07:58:14,360
4am is my stream time.

6572
07:58:14,360 --> 07:58:16,360
Daylight saving and stuff.

6573
07:58:17,360 --> 07:58:19,360
But it's healthy...

6574
07:58:19,360 --> 07:58:21,360
It's healthy.

6575
07:58:21,360 --> 07:58:23,360
It means I can do stuff during the day.

6576
07:58:23,360 --> 07:58:25,360
Oh, 13, 13!

6577
07:58:25,360 --> 07:58:27,360
Okay, I don't know.

6578
07:58:27,360 --> 07:58:29,360
I genuinely didn't do anything different.

6579
07:58:29,360 --> 07:58:31,360
I think it really is just luck of the draw or something,

6580
07:58:31,360 --> 07:58:33,360
because I did not do anything...

6581
07:58:35,360 --> 07:58:37,360
Ah, I thought I was going to say, hopefully,

6582
07:58:37,360 --> 07:58:39,360
I'm going to get two in a row.

6583
07:58:40,360 --> 07:58:42,360
This is such a bizarre,

6584
07:58:42,360 --> 07:58:43,360
like,

6585
07:58:43,360 --> 07:58:45,360
challenge-type thing, honestly.

6586
07:58:50,360 --> 07:58:51,360
No!

6587
07:58:51,360 --> 07:58:53,360
Why, why, why, why?

6588
07:58:53,360 --> 07:58:54,360
30!

6589
07:58:54,360 --> 07:58:55,360
No, not 30!

6590
07:58:55,360 --> 07:58:56,360
13!

6591
07:58:56,360 --> 07:58:57,360
13!

6592
07:58:58,360 --> 07:58:59,360
Mmm.

6593
07:58:59,360 --> 07:59:00,360
Spreads build up just straight up and...

6594
07:59:00,360 --> 07:59:01,360
Ah!

6595
07:59:02,360 --> 07:59:04,360
All bits are so, like...

6596
07:59:05,360 --> 07:59:06,360
Neaxanoid in the moment.

6597
07:59:06,360 --> 07:59:08,360
See, yeah, that was, like, hardly any build up to it,

6598
07:59:08,360 --> 07:59:10,360
so I think that's why that one's on the wall.

6599
07:59:13,360 --> 07:59:14,360
Mmm.

6600
07:59:15,360 --> 07:59:17,360
Let's not be knocking down women.

6601
07:59:17,360 --> 07:59:19,360
I only want to knock up women.

6602
07:59:19,360 --> 07:59:20,360
Thank you very much.

6603
07:59:21,360 --> 07:59:22,360
Oh, wait!

6604
07:59:22,360 --> 07:59:23,360
I don't want to knock down women.

6605
07:59:23,360 --> 07:59:25,360
I only want to knock them up!

6606
07:59:26,360 --> 07:59:27,360
Please laugh.

6607
07:59:32,360 --> 07:59:34,360
One more time without doing a massive thing.

6608
07:59:40,360 --> 07:59:41,360
I have a little thingy.

6609
07:59:41,360 --> 07:59:42,360
Yeah, I forgot.

6610
07:59:42,360 --> 07:59:44,360
I forgot I had it too.

6611
07:59:44,360 --> 07:59:45,360
Okay, I forgot.

6612
07:59:45,360 --> 07:59:47,360
Literally, I'll need to add a laughing track as well.

6613
07:59:47,360 --> 07:59:50,360
Oh, brother, this guy stinks!

6614
07:59:50,360 --> 07:59:53,360
Yeah, I'm going to have to add a...

6615
07:59:54,360 --> 07:59:55,360
I'll add a laughing track.

6616
07:59:55,360 --> 07:59:57,360
I should add a laughing track.

6617
07:59:57,360 --> 07:59:58,360
That's, like, one that's good,

6618
07:59:58,360 --> 08:00:00,360
and then one that's, like,

6619
08:00:00,360 --> 08:00:02,360
it gets a few coughs and, like, a giggle,

6620
08:00:02,360 --> 08:00:03,360
so it's, like, a bad joke.

6621
08:00:03,360 --> 08:00:05,360
I'm definitely going to need to get that.

6622
08:00:08,360 --> 08:00:09,360
I need to hydrate.

6623
08:00:09,360 --> 08:00:10,360
My goodness.

6624
08:00:10,360 --> 08:00:12,360
Trying so hard to figure out, like,

6625
08:00:12,360 --> 08:00:14,360
what's determined in this jump or not?

6626
08:00:16,360 --> 08:00:18,360
I need some crickets, yeah.

6627
08:00:20,360 --> 08:00:21,360
Do the joke again.

6628
08:00:21,360 --> 08:00:23,360
I let my laugh in my other jacket.

6629
08:00:24,360 --> 08:00:26,360
Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket.

6630
08:00:26,360 --> 08:00:28,360
Ha-ha, you spelt it wrong.

6631
08:00:28,360 --> 08:00:29,360
Everyone pointing laugh.

6632
08:00:29,360 --> 08:00:30,360
You spelt his thing wrong,

6633
08:00:30,360 --> 08:00:31,360
and I read it out,

6634
08:00:31,360 --> 08:00:32,360
and now he's embarrassed.

6635
08:00:32,360 --> 08:00:34,360
Ha-ha-ha, streamer,

6636
08:00:34,360 --> 08:00:36,360
read out your message with a spelling error.

6637
08:00:36,360 --> 08:00:37,360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

6638
08:00:37,360 --> 08:00:39,360
Oh, that was just gross.

6639
08:00:40,360 --> 08:00:42,360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

6640
08:00:43,360 --> 08:00:45,360
Right, okay, we're going to try Gallop now.

6641
08:00:46,360 --> 08:00:48,360
The only issue with Gallop in

6642
08:00:48,360 --> 08:00:50,360
is if you Gallop through a crowd too much.

6643
08:00:53,360 --> 08:00:54,360
No, that was far too early.

6644
08:00:54,360 --> 08:00:56,360
Okay, I kind of struggled with this.

6645
08:00:56,360 --> 08:00:58,360
We'll try the Gallop from this side.

6646
08:00:59,360 --> 08:01:00,360
Life's over.

6647
08:01:00,360 --> 08:01:01,360
It's over.

6648
08:01:01,360 --> 08:01:02,360
You'll never recover.

6649
08:01:02,360 --> 08:01:05,360
Your social credit has been determined.

6650
08:01:05,360 --> 08:01:06,360
No, okay.

6651
08:01:06,360 --> 08:01:09,360
That Gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever.

6652
08:01:09,360 --> 08:01:11,360
I like how the horse is so responsive.

6653
08:01:11,360 --> 08:01:12,360
It's like, where'd you go?

6654
08:01:12,360 --> 08:01:13,360
Please come back.

6655
08:01:15,360 --> 08:01:18,360
Oh, is it the degration?

6656
08:01:18,360 --> 08:01:19,360
Degoration.

6657
08:01:19,360 --> 08:01:20,360
Degredation?

6658
08:01:20,360 --> 08:01:21,360
Degredation.

6659
08:01:21,360 --> 08:01:22,360
Degredation.

6660
08:01:22,360 --> 08:01:24,360
Degredation sounds correct.

6661
08:01:24,360 --> 08:01:26,360
I said a degredation.

6662
08:01:26,360 --> 08:01:27,360
Ooh, 12!

6663
08:01:29,360 --> 08:01:31,360
I'm just so surprised when it does happen.

6664
08:01:31,360 --> 08:01:33,360
It seems to happen in that direction

6665
08:01:33,360 --> 08:01:35,360
more than it happens in this direction.

6666
08:01:36,360 --> 08:01:37,360
Nope.

6667
08:01:37,360 --> 08:01:38,360
Well, close.

6668
08:01:38,360 --> 08:01:39,360
It's over.

6669
08:01:39,360 --> 08:01:40,360
Not quite.

6670
08:01:41,360 --> 08:01:42,360
I do want you on the beams,

6671
08:01:42,360 --> 08:01:43,360
but I want you to do that

6672
08:01:43,360 --> 08:01:45,360
with fancy flips that you do.

6673
08:01:45,360 --> 08:01:46,360
They should have made it 10.

6674
08:01:46,360 --> 08:01:48,360
No, they actually shouldn't have done this at all

6675
08:01:48,360 --> 08:01:50,360
because literally, how would you have discovered that

6676
08:01:50,360 --> 08:01:51,360
Exo can even do this?

6677
08:01:51,360 --> 08:01:53,360
I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered

6678
08:01:53,360 --> 08:01:54,360
that he could do this.

6679
08:01:56,360 --> 08:01:57,360
Good night.

6680
08:01:57,360 --> 08:01:58,360
Rest well.

6681
08:01:58,360 --> 08:01:59,360
Thank you for hanging.

6682
08:02:00,360 --> 08:02:01,360
We're, uh...

6683
08:02:02,360 --> 08:02:04,360
Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for.

6684
08:02:04,360 --> 08:02:05,360
I've accidentally covered it up

6685
08:02:05,360 --> 08:02:08,360
by a little list of things that I need to do.

6686
08:02:08,360 --> 08:02:09,360
Oopsie, oopsie.

6687
08:02:10,360 --> 08:02:11,360
Oh, that was like...

6688
08:02:11,360 --> 08:02:12,360
Really?

6689
08:02:12,360 --> 08:02:13,360
Nope.

6690
08:02:16,360 --> 08:02:19,360
It feels like it has cooled down, honestly.

6691
08:02:19,360 --> 08:02:20,360
The brain rot took over.

6692
08:02:20,360 --> 08:02:21,360
Yeah, it took over long ago.

6693
08:02:21,360 --> 08:02:22,360
I apologize.

6694
08:02:23,360 --> 08:02:24,360
Eight hours.

6695
08:02:24,360 --> 08:02:25,360
I've only been streaming eight hours,

6696
08:02:25,360 --> 08:02:26,360
and I've got a few more in me.

6697
08:02:28,360 --> 08:02:29,360
I want this one over

6698
08:02:29,360 --> 08:02:31,360
because I never want to have to do it again.

6699
08:02:32,360 --> 08:02:34,360
I don't want to have to come back to this,

6700
08:02:34,360 --> 08:02:36,360
but I know you guys have been literally watching me

6701
08:02:36,360 --> 08:02:37,360
do a backflip on...

6702
08:02:37,360 --> 08:02:39,360
Do a flip on a horse for like ten minutes now.

6703
08:02:39,360 --> 08:02:40,360
It's gonna be just...

6704
08:02:40,360 --> 08:02:41,360
No one's laughing.

6705
08:02:43,360 --> 08:02:44,360
Getting aggravated now.

6706
08:02:44,360 --> 08:02:45,360
Great.

6707
08:02:45,360 --> 08:02:46,360
I am running.

6708
08:02:46,360 --> 08:02:47,360
I am running.

6709
08:02:47,360 --> 08:02:48,360
I am holding.

6710
08:02:48,360 --> 08:02:49,360
Oh!

6711
08:02:49,360 --> 08:02:50,360
Hmm.

6712
08:02:51,360 --> 08:02:52,360
Eleven?

6713
08:02:54,360 --> 08:02:56,360
Okay, I think it's eleven now.

6714
08:02:56,360 --> 08:02:57,360
I don't know why.

6715
08:02:57,360 --> 08:03:00,360
Right, I'll run up for ages.

6716
08:03:00,360 --> 08:03:01,360
Hold.

6717
08:03:01,360 --> 08:03:02,360
Nope.

6718
08:03:05,360 --> 08:03:07,360
Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there.

6719
08:03:07,360 --> 08:03:09,360
We're almost there.

6720
08:03:10,360 --> 08:03:11,360
No flip.

6721
08:03:11,360 --> 08:03:12,360
Absolutely.

6722
08:03:12,360 --> 08:03:14,360
Only eight hours.

6723
08:03:14,360 --> 08:03:16,360
Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place

6724
08:03:16,360 --> 08:03:19,360
when you see me only online for like two hours tomorrow.

6725
08:03:19,360 --> 08:03:20,360
You're gonna be like,

6726
08:03:20,360 --> 08:03:21,360
what's wrong?

6727
08:03:21,360 --> 08:03:22,360
Is she sick?

6728
08:03:22,360 --> 08:03:23,360
Where's my horse?

6729
08:03:24,360 --> 08:03:25,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

6730
08:03:26,360 --> 08:03:28,360
Oh no, you have done.

6731
08:03:34,360 --> 08:03:35,360
Ten, ten.

6732
08:03:35,360 --> 08:03:37,360
Right, I feel like it always happens

6733
08:03:37,360 --> 08:03:38,360
come in this direction

6734
08:03:38,360 --> 08:03:40,360
instead of the other direction.

6735
08:03:41,360 --> 08:03:42,360
Skillshare can't even do a flip.

6736
08:03:42,360 --> 08:03:44,360
We're not flipping out on you.

6737
08:03:44,360 --> 08:03:46,360
You're not flipping out on me?

6738
08:03:49,360 --> 08:03:50,360
Insert laugh track here

6739
08:03:50,360 --> 08:03:51,360
that I still haven't added yet,

6740
08:03:51,360 --> 08:03:53,360
but I will add the laugh track soon to you.

6741
08:03:54,360 --> 08:03:56,360
Please get the heck out of my way.

6742
08:03:56,360 --> 08:03:57,360
I'm trying to do flips.

6743
08:04:05,360 --> 08:04:07,360
Can you leave me alone?

6744
08:04:08,360 --> 08:04:09,360
No.

6745
08:04:12,360 --> 08:04:14,360
No money is worth this, he said.

6746
08:04:16,360 --> 08:04:18,360
I do need to kill from horseback.

6747
08:04:19,360 --> 08:04:21,360
So maybe just do that real quick.

6748
08:04:25,360 --> 08:04:26,360
We'll just do this one

6749
08:04:26,360 --> 08:04:27,360
to add to the horseback one.

6750
08:04:27,360 --> 08:04:28,360
So we're still making progress

6751
08:04:28,360 --> 08:04:30,360
even though it's very good.

6752
08:04:31,360 --> 08:04:32,360
Let's try this.

6753
08:04:34,360 --> 08:04:35,360
I did it!

6754
08:04:41,360 --> 08:04:42,360
Okay, that's the sound

6755
08:04:42,360 --> 08:04:44,360
I need to add right now.

6756
08:04:45,360 --> 08:04:47,360
But if I do the flip, it goes ehhhhh.

6757
08:04:48,360 --> 08:04:49,360
Don't worry,

6758
08:04:49,360 --> 08:04:50,360
I'll get a little bit for you.

6759
08:04:50,360 --> 08:04:51,360
I'm dead.

6760
08:04:56,360 --> 08:04:57,360
Flipping on a beam off a hole

6761
08:04:57,360 --> 08:04:59,360
or is this sucks

6762
08:04:59,360 --> 08:05:00,360
and I don't know

6763
08:05:00,360 --> 08:05:02,360
why they asked for a twin.

6764
08:05:04,360 --> 08:05:08,360
stop taking people's horses.

6765
08:05:08,360 --> 08:05:12,360
It's really not nice.

6766
08:05:12,360 --> 08:05:16,360
I'm looking to see if there's like a

6767
08:05:16,360 --> 08:05:20,360
prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever

6768
08:05:20,360 --> 08:05:24,360
but there's no happening.

6769
08:05:24,360 --> 08:05:28,360
There's no happening but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it.

6770
08:05:28,360 --> 08:05:32,360
Well, that's probably not going to work now.

6771
08:05:32,360 --> 08:05:36,360
I have lost my mind.

6772
08:05:36,360 --> 08:05:40,360
Literally I've been doing flips for so long. Please.

6773
08:05:40,360 --> 08:05:44,360
Free me. Free me from the beam.

6774
08:05:44,360 --> 08:05:48,360
Oh, nine. Finally.

6775
08:05:48,360 --> 08:05:52,360
Wow.

6776
08:05:56,360 --> 08:06:00,360
No, it's still below the beam.

6777
08:06:00,360 --> 08:06:04,360
You could have easily sat back on the horse, I'll be honest.

6778
08:06:04,360 --> 08:06:08,360
The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed.

6779
08:06:08,360 --> 08:06:12,360
He's killed to kill to pull fun.

6780
08:06:12,360 --> 08:06:16,360
Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Okay, that was

6781
08:06:16,360 --> 08:06:20,360
excuse me. I think I need it. I think I can kill him

6782
08:06:20,360 --> 08:06:24,360
and it'll count for the horseback.

6783
08:06:24,360 --> 08:06:28,360
Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry.

6784
08:06:28,360 --> 08:06:32,360
Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well.

6785
08:06:32,360 --> 08:06:36,360
There we go. One.

6786
08:06:36,360 --> 08:06:40,360
Two.

6787
08:06:40,360 --> 08:06:44,360
Three. Or I'm going to throw rocks through

6788
08:06:44,360 --> 08:06:48,360
your window.

6789
08:06:48,360 --> 08:06:52,360
Okay, let's try this again. Oh, no, don't jump.

6790
08:06:52,360 --> 08:06:56,360
No, stay. Try again. Try again.

6791
08:06:56,360 --> 08:07:00,360
You mustn't offend the left.

6792
08:07:00,360 --> 08:07:04,360
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry, can you? Oh, seven.

6793
08:07:04,360 --> 08:07:08,360
Seven? I think seven.

6794
08:07:08,360 --> 08:07:12,360
I still have yet to

6795
08:07:12,360 --> 08:07:16,360
figure out what determines it, but once it's over with, we don't have to do it again.

6796
08:07:16,360 --> 08:07:20,360
We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god, I've not done that.

6797
08:07:20,360 --> 08:07:24,360
Can we do a triple? Can we do a triple? It's like my subconscious understanding

6798
08:07:24,360 --> 08:07:28,360
what I need to do, even though my brain, like, my actual conscious doesn't...

6799
08:07:28,360 --> 08:07:32,360
No, we got a double though. So it's six.

6800
08:07:32,360 --> 08:07:36,360
Only six more to go. I've never done back to back. That's fantastic.

6801
08:07:36,360 --> 08:07:40,360
I was literally like, is my subconscious knowing what's up? But my conscious

6802
08:07:40,360 --> 08:07:44,360
is like, can't... mmm, that was far too early.

6803
08:07:44,360 --> 08:07:48,360
I need to put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible.

6804
08:07:48,360 --> 08:07:52,360
Wow. Oh, baby.

6805
08:07:54,360 --> 08:07:58,360
Top 10 moments of 24.

6806
08:07:58,360 --> 08:08:02,360
Welcome to WatchMojo. Well, we rate the

6807
08:08:02,360 --> 08:08:06,360
worst little

6808
08:08:06,360 --> 08:08:10,360
side quest things that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood randomly give you, because it is a bit

6809
08:08:10,360 --> 08:08:14,360
arbitrary.

6810
08:08:14,360 --> 08:08:18,360
Yeah.

6811
08:08:18,360 --> 08:08:22,360
Only six

6812
08:08:22,360 --> 08:08:26,360
more. Can you hold on?

6813
08:08:26,360 --> 08:08:30,360
I'm starting to lose

6814
08:08:30,360 --> 08:08:34,360
a little bit, but that's okay, because we got five. We got five.

6815
08:08:34,360 --> 08:08:38,360
I was going to say it would be a triple. Get out of my

6816
08:08:38,360 --> 08:08:42,360
hand. Look, I wasn't kidding when people were like, why would you

6817
08:08:42,360 --> 08:08:46,360
describe Shubi as like, everything you should have been?

6818
08:08:46,360 --> 08:08:50,360
I wasn't kidding. Was I kidding?

6819
08:08:50,360 --> 08:08:54,360
Oh, four! Four! Four!

6820
08:08:54,360 --> 08:08:58,360
Cheat run.

6821
08:08:58,360 --> 08:09:02,360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...

6822
08:09:02,360 --> 08:09:06,360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...

6823
08:09:06,360 --> 08:09:10,360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f

6824
08:09:10,360 --> 08:09:18,360
Wow, four, that was too slow.

6825
08:09:18,360 --> 08:09:24,360
We're sounding so country.

6826
08:09:24,360 --> 08:09:31,360
Wow, the sound of the ice cream.

6827
08:09:32,360 --> 08:09:38,360
Three, three, three, three,

6828
08:09:38,360 --> 08:09:48,360
three, two, two, two, two,

6829
08:09:48,360 --> 08:09:52,360
two, two, two...

6830
08:09:52,360 --> 08:09:54,360
All the two, two, two,

6831
08:09:54,360 --> 08:09:56,360
all the two, two,

6832
08:09:56,360 --> 08:09:59,360
all of that was gonna get the Truffle there.

6833
08:09:59,360 --> 08:10:07,200
Two more. Two more. The people listening in right now that are like waiting on

6834
08:10:07,200 --> 08:10:12,560
Mercy to start they're like please for the love of God mercy start early.

6835
08:10:15,840 --> 08:10:25,840
One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Just one more time.

6836
08:10:26,640 --> 08:10:32,320
We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah jumping on the horse beam.

6837
08:10:35,440 --> 08:10:42,640
Do the random say thing for the guilt quiz because it's so silly. Just one more time.

6838
08:10:43,600 --> 08:10:47,120
We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah.

6839
08:10:48,080 --> 08:10:57,360
Oh don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and

6840
08:11:00,960 --> 08:11:06,800
your daddy your dad tells everyone don't ever give me such a silly thing again.

6841
08:11:06,800 --> 08:11:13,600
That was absolute torture. Lower guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam.

6842
08:11:14,160 --> 08:11:15,840
No guards.

6843
08:11:20,080 --> 08:11:24,320
Okay the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to

6844
08:11:24,320 --> 08:11:32,400
no because they would have to be below me. Where is a beam that a rider goes past because I think

6845
08:11:32,400 --> 08:11:36,720
that's what I have to assassinate. It's enough horsing around. No dive on.

6846
08:11:37,120 --> 08:11:42,880
I think if I do this I might get the horseback kills.

6847
08:11:58,000 --> 08:12:01,600
Uh uh please come under this beam over here please harass me under this beam please

6848
08:12:01,600 --> 08:12:04,800
harass me under this beam I can't believe the game literally just trained me for this moment

6849
08:12:04,800 --> 08:12:08,320
please come under the beam please come under the beam I take all back I'm sorry these guilt

6850
08:12:14,000 --> 08:12:22,960
these skills I'm sorry these skills I'm sorry I didn't believe you these skills I didn't believe

6851
08:12:22,960 --> 08:12:33,840
you I'm sorry where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where

6852
08:12:33,920 --> 08:12:37,760
it's located it's not up here it doesn't feel like it's up here at all

6853
08:12:41,120 --> 08:12:45,920
ah mission failed you get I'm next time literally where the heck are these beams

6854
08:12:47,280 --> 08:12:52,960
are there any beams anywhere the only beam around here is me having a beamer because

6855
08:12:52,960 --> 08:13:01,280
of how freaking embarrassed in this gameplay is to have a beamer means that you are embarrassed

6856
08:13:01,280 --> 08:13:04,000
and have scarlet face or a red face

6857
08:13:04,000 --> 08:13:22,720
um

6858
08:13:23,440 --> 08:13:24,720
um

6859
08:13:25,760 --> 08:13:26,320
just to be like

6860
08:13:27,280 --> 08:13:35,920
uh levope does have missions I am going to buy ammo and I'm going to do this stationary guy

6861
08:13:35,920 --> 08:13:42,880
one because it's really easy to do it in this quest so I'm going to go buy ammo and we're going

6862
08:13:42,880 --> 08:13:48,400
to replay a mission that gives us one of the thieves guilds requirements

6863
08:13:48,400 --> 08:13:58,560
yeah Claudio yeah she does as well um I'm trying to do sorry who goes there um

6864
08:14:01,520 --> 08:14:05,120
oh goodness me I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating from a very

6865
08:14:13,600 --> 08:14:18,000
what is needy smear overload it is uh unfortunately I actually don't

6866
08:14:18,080 --> 08:14:21,680
know too much about the game but it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the

6867
08:14:21,680 --> 08:14:25,760
first time um I don't think it's gonna be a very long stream if you're wanting an endurance on that

6868
08:14:26,880 --> 08:14:34,560
I need to go to the shops to buy the sweets for the hand cam swing stream why am I here just to

6869
08:14:34,560 --> 08:14:44,320
suffer yeah sure how much was that oh you're no cheat oh I need to buy art I just realized that

6870
08:14:44,320 --> 08:14:50,080
yeah I need to buy like tons of art in all the different districts two three hours yeah that's

6871
08:14:50,080 --> 08:14:56,720
like the perfect stream deep gargling didn't overstay as well but uh okay okay I do it

6872
08:14:58,080 --> 08:15:00,240
young man with an apple man

6873
08:15:03,040 --> 08:15:07,520
he looks so dumb he's like I have an apple posing oh that's a cool one

6874
08:15:07,520 --> 08:15:20,240
hmm right we've got all the art for here oh wait I'm like 90% sure you sell feather locations

6875
08:15:20,240 --> 08:15:27,440
can you please resell me then no yeah the feathers we'll grab the feather I'm another

6876
08:15:27,440 --> 08:15:36,240
there's one on the Colosseo are you gonna 100% avatar no I've never played the RDA side of avatar

6877
08:15:36,240 --> 08:15:45,200
I don't like the RDA side it's speaking can I still visit Leonardo um I don't play the RDA

6878
08:15:45,200 --> 08:15:51,600
side I only play the navi side um I will just be doing the navi I think the campaign's like

6879
08:15:51,600 --> 08:16:01,680
six hours on that one if I can remember correctly um we'll be strange not seeing you before bed and

6880
08:16:01,680 --> 08:16:08,400
waking up after yeah it's gonna be an interesting day but I do have endurance streams every week

6881
08:16:08,400 --> 08:16:16,960
kind of planned as long as all goes well and I'll see what the clipping situation is uh

6882
08:16:19,600 --> 08:16:20,560
hi Leonardo

6883
08:16:21,440 --> 08:16:28,000
it's you the people apartments are in turmoil cesare is ill and the pope dead it was your doing

6884
08:16:28,720 --> 08:16:33,120
was it not Leonardo I swear to you he did not die by my hand

6885
08:16:33,920 --> 08:16:39,280
this world gets stranger every day I shall have to focus on my painting I work on the small

6886
08:16:39,280 --> 08:16:45,440
portrait of a woman I'm growing rather fond of it hmm do not let a beautiful girl distract you

6887
08:16:45,440 --> 08:16:53,040
from constructing my designs I have no worries women provide little distraction wait I don't get it

6888
08:16:54,000 --> 08:16:57,760
he's a gay boy so it's pride month doesn't he be like that man

6889
08:16:59,600 --> 08:17:02,880
doesn't he be like that that's nice oh I have everything

6890
08:17:06,480 --> 08:17:11,040
if you decide to buy something look for the chalk outline on bench I don't have anything to

6891
08:17:11,040 --> 08:17:19,200
purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again you have all that I can give

6892
08:17:19,200 --> 08:17:22,960
now you're on your own ah Leonardo give back you

6893
08:17:25,280 --> 08:17:31,440
give me some of that good day for catching up on clips and bars and things and no endurance

6894
08:17:31,440 --> 08:17:37,120
yeah um so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have

6895
08:17:37,120 --> 08:17:41,120
to click like and stream at the same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs

6896
08:17:41,120 --> 08:17:46,160
all the girls and all that uh and deal with audios and blah blah blah so I don't want to stress them

6897
08:17:46,160 --> 08:17:52,880
out so when you guys like do a make a youtube clip I can go on their accounts and see what

6898
08:17:52,880 --> 08:17:59,280
someone's clipped and if it is like clippable worthy I can then send the timestamp onto like an

6899
08:17:59,280 --> 08:18:07,440
actual clip editor to make clips for them um I just need to see how it works out in theory

6900
08:18:07,440 --> 08:18:11,440
obviously when I do endurance streams I can't do any of it like right now for them um

6901
08:18:11,520 --> 08:18:21,040
but we will see how it goes I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need

6902
08:18:21,040 --> 08:18:26,560
more clippers of this particular style because there's a particular clipping editing style

6903
08:18:27,280 --> 08:18:34,720
that I'm looking for the most recent mersey shorts the blonde hair short and the other

6904
08:18:35,280 --> 08:18:43,280
short a forgotten um is the clipping style so if you really can do that editing style

6905
08:18:44,080 --> 08:18:50,560
you know don't be afraid to hit up the website uh because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point

6906
08:18:51,440 --> 08:18:56,720
good thing I got a few clips already my job is not nice either if you're a general clipper

6907
08:18:56,720 --> 08:19:02,080
uh we just I'm still interested in doing the clipping enterprise that like idol end done

6908
08:19:02,080 --> 08:19:07,040
which is really good um obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my

6909
08:19:07,040 --> 08:19:13,360
funds and the money looks like and all that um because will it tell you a really embarrassing fact

6910
08:19:14,160 --> 08:19:23,920
you know the earlier uh like um the earlier uh clips that came out shorts that were on the

6911
08:19:23,920 --> 08:19:29,920
girls channels um emmy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually

6912
08:19:30,560 --> 08:19:35,520
but I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed I was like I'm so sorry

6913
08:19:35,520 --> 08:19:42,160
girls this is the best I can do because we had quite a few issues behind the scenes production

6914
08:19:42,160 --> 08:19:49,520
wise with timing it was a freaking nightmare um so like all my attention was elsewhere and

6915
08:19:50,320 --> 08:19:55,200
like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers here's this these files like please wear them

6916
08:19:56,160 --> 08:20:01,120
um which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about

6917
08:20:01,120 --> 08:20:04,080
like where I failed the girls and like I definitely feel like I've failed with them

6918
08:20:04,880 --> 08:20:11,440
on the clips because the actual plan was the count school live for two weeks before stream

6919
08:20:11,440 --> 08:20:18,640
and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and

6920
08:20:18,640 --> 08:20:24,800
I feel really bad about it like I feel wrong um but like the dust is kind of set off already done

6921
08:20:24,800 --> 08:20:35,040
this but the dust is like kind of settling now the only bad thing is that for now time zone only

6922
08:20:35,040 --> 08:20:43,440
you and I see stream at normal times okay you may be not in a normal way yeah

6923
08:20:51,360 --> 08:20:54,880
no like it definitely went well like absolutely no denying like

6924
08:20:55,760 --> 08:20:56,800
where am I trying to go

6925
08:21:00,880 --> 08:21:10,880
um I'm definitely not denying like debut went well and everything just like I had planned

6926
08:21:10,880 --> 08:21:16,400
things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all

6927
08:21:16,400 --> 08:21:20,240
I just realized I need to leave the face uh we're going to be jumping off this building for quite

6928
08:21:20,240 --> 08:21:27,920
well um like I understand it's not possible for everything are you serious it's for everything

6929
08:21:27,920 --> 08:21:34,960
to like come out the way of my head um like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted

6930
08:21:34,960 --> 08:21:41,920
them to um but because of like production issues I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in

6931
08:21:41,920 --> 08:21:52,000
time for anything really and it was just like ah but yeah yeah are you winning strong absolutely um

6932
08:21:52,000 --> 08:22:00,000
are you winning excuse me I'm using this hay bale I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick

6933
08:22:00,000 --> 08:22:05,280
I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith

6934
08:22:06,160 --> 08:22:12,400
no it's ill into the hay bale no it's ill into the hay bale

6935
08:22:15,600 --> 08:22:22,480
yeah it was a timing issue um we love artists in this house we do but um

6936
08:22:23,840 --> 08:22:32,880
I had given very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking

6937
08:22:32,880 --> 08:22:42,320
and pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked

6938
08:22:42,320 --> 08:22:48,400
with me and you did go over deadline like please don't worry um like it's not like a big deal

6939
08:22:48,400 --> 08:22:52,880
anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and

6940
08:22:52,960 --> 08:23:03,360
like that's that's the facts but I had a lot of delays and basically I had planned every month in

6941
08:23:03,360 --> 08:23:08,880
advance being like this month I'll be focused on this this month I'll be focused on that and what

6942
08:23:08,880 --> 08:23:18,720
happened was everything had to be done in May and like I'm not gonna lie I like cried a few times

6943
08:23:18,720 --> 08:23:26,160
out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough because I have to wait for

6944
08:23:27,120 --> 08:23:34,080
someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of

6945
08:23:35,840 --> 08:23:42,480
like issues with um people not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like

6946
08:23:42,480 --> 08:23:49,440
hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey um like the subtitle that you put here um like it's

6947
08:23:49,440 --> 08:23:54,960
quite clear that she didn't say this but you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey

6948
08:23:54,960 --> 08:23:59,840
the audio literally cuts out in the middle of this can you re-render like I don't know what like

6949
08:24:00,800 --> 08:24:08,240
it was it was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the the girls know a bit more in detail

6950
08:24:08,320 --> 08:24:15,120
exactly what I'm talking about um because like I showed them like we are like I'm constantly

6951
08:24:15,120 --> 08:24:20,160
sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the

6952
08:24:20,160 --> 08:24:25,120
fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version

6953
08:24:25,120 --> 08:24:30,640
of something it's like no 24 hours I'll do it in the morning I'll do it later and I'm like I have

6954
08:24:30,640 --> 08:24:37,040
paid premium rates I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work you should quality

6955
08:24:37,040 --> 08:24:43,840
check it before you send it to me and like bro it was just a cascading effect and it was pretty

6956
08:24:43,840 --> 08:24:53,440
horrible um but yeah but we're here now so and there were so many lessons learned like um

6957
08:24:54,400 --> 08:24:58,880
ripped to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler but like everyone's getting

6958
08:24:58,880 --> 08:25:07,040
contracts like conscripted and stuff like um and being like if you miss this deadline like

6959
08:25:07,040 --> 08:25:14,640
you know it's just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the

6960
08:25:14,640 --> 08:25:23,680
benefit of the doubt but holy is this even counting for leaps of faith uh yeah like deadlines are so

6961
08:25:23,680 --> 08:25:34,960
important and having that like oh wow we're one off of leaf of faith um literally in the end we

6962
08:25:34,960 --> 08:25:40,880
made it everything worked out fight wait did that guard hurt himself I don't remember hurting him um

6963
08:25:42,160 --> 08:25:49,840
like we made it in the end but yeah rough rough not fun but I'm now like I just want to stream

6964
08:25:49,840 --> 08:25:53,040
I just want to have fun I want to show off my games I want to have a good time I want to make

6965
08:25:53,040 --> 08:25:57,760
ASMR I want to do everything that I've wanted to do while I get to do it alongside like these

6966
08:25:57,760 --> 08:26:02,560
amazing girls type thing um and I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes

6967
08:26:02,560 --> 08:26:07,600
like obviously the the the current goal is YouTube to please stop calling us and like

6968
08:26:07,600 --> 08:26:12,240
admit that we're real like streamers and stuff you don't need colors like there's plenty of content

6969
08:26:13,600 --> 08:26:19,200
on the channels now but yeah like it definitely like everything works out in the end

6970
08:26:19,200 --> 08:26:23,360
absolutely is everyone max level

6971
08:26:26,320 --> 08:26:34,000
no three people aren't max oh I didn't mean to do that but hey yeah like the worst part is over

6972
08:26:35,200 --> 08:26:43,920
wait what the heck oopsies I'm to kill the mailman not to be confused with the sand man

6973
08:26:43,920 --> 08:26:49,680
that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz that was ridiculous

6974
08:26:50,880 --> 08:26:58,160
never heard of that first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard the song but like what

6975
08:27:03,920 --> 08:27:05,040
oh for goodness sake

6976
08:27:05,040 --> 08:27:16,640
okay they're open oh I love how easy that stuff is wonderful

6977
08:27:18,800 --> 08:27:24,400
oh uh excuse me am I not your mentor that's got pushed off of them

6978
08:27:26,960 --> 08:27:31,760
oh no the PayPal got fixed um so you can support any of the girls like right now

6979
08:27:31,760 --> 08:27:36,320
I think I need to update my link or something because people say it no work or something

6980
08:27:40,800 --> 08:27:45,120
oh you're using the new info I can't believe it YouTube on softwares

6981
08:27:46,080 --> 08:27:50,080
it's old european folklore of course it's nonsense true

6982
08:27:52,720 --> 08:27:53,680
a little retrieve

6983
08:27:53,680 --> 08:27:59,600
right I don't really know what the plan is

6984
08:28:04,080 --> 08:28:11,200
okay we'll finish the guild people's requests but I have to admit I'm a bit lost on what next to do

6985
08:28:12,160 --> 08:28:14,960
um

6986
08:28:19,600 --> 08:28:24,960
get all the guild requests buy everything and then I think we might be done maybe the feathers

6987
08:28:27,360 --> 08:28:32,080
um and we'll revisit it at a non-profit question mark

6988
08:28:32,720 --> 08:28:34,320
uh mercy 30 minute

6989
08:28:38,000 --> 08:28:40,240

that was rubbish

7004
08:30:01,600 --> 08:30:02,720
and maybe the missions

7005
08:30:12,160 --> 08:30:15,040
I've never achieved that that's not even possible

7006
08:30:15,840 --> 08:30:24,080
no these like so aren't possible maybe I need to do

7007
08:30:27,120 --> 08:30:28,880
wait the assassinations are only uh

7008
08:30:30,880 --> 08:30:33,920

7009
08:30:37,760 --> 08:30:41,680
okay okay we'll do assassins that'll raise us that'll raise us really quickly like they're

7010
08:30:41,680 --> 08:30:47,600
super easy super nice and uh consider it so we'll do that we'll do that

7011
08:30:57,360 --> 08:30:58,640
just climbing up ladders don't mind me

7012
08:31:03,360 --> 08:31:03,840

I'm doing something mildly special in it I'm a bit concerned after what happened to me but

7015
08:31:15,520 --> 08:31:19,760
he apparently she was jumping up and doing on the bed like a monkey

7016
08:31:25,200 --> 08:31:27,680
yeah were you there did you hear about this did you see this

7017
08:31:29,360 --> 08:31:31,520

08:31:44,240 --> 08:31:45,440
how is she jumping down

7021
08:31:49,120 --> 08:31:53,760
oh let's see the board you have unleashed their interrogate if they cannot find us we'll

7022
08:31:53,760 --> 08:32:00,560
burl us people do not let your targets call for reinforcements oh I don't know what that means

7023
08:32:01,360 --> 08:32:05,200
kill wait does that mean like don't get detected

7024
08:32:06,640 --> 08:32:12,000
she had to fall and land on her ear somehow yeah I remember reading someone's review on it and I was

7025
08:32:12,000 --> 08:32:24,080
like no I want all my children to succeed but apparently apparently we were spitting and

7026
08:32:24,080 --> 08:32:33,120
licking it back up how do you plead to these accusations in me how do you plead to such accusations

7027
08:32:38,960 --> 08:32:39,600
actually

7028
08:32:41,920 --> 08:32:50,160
pin pals how do you plead to the accusations that you egged your little sister on

7029
08:32:50,480 --> 08:32:54,560
to do such devious acts

7030
08:33:08,000 --> 08:33:15,200
a guard is running for backup who who they're all highlighted

7031
08:33:20,480 --> 08:33:21,600
no I got kill bruised

7032
08:33:25,280 --> 08:33:30,960
I don't know where that guy ran I'm not really mad at it because I'm still gonna get DNA anyway but

7033
08:33:38,080 --> 08:33:39,840
oh there's scaffold in there I could have grabbed him

7034
08:33:40,640 --> 08:33:50,800
not guilty I plead the fifth egged Emmy on oh that's funny what is she egging you guys on

7035
08:33:52,480 --> 08:33:56,400
these accusations against my little sister I will not stand for such things

7036
08:34:00,480 --> 08:34:02,320
right okay let's keep doing

7037
08:34:02,560 --> 08:34:05,280
these

7038
08:34:12,640 --> 08:34:20,640
she knew what she was doing my innocent little sister has no concept of what even a double

7039
08:34:20,640 --> 08:34:27,840
meaning is you are looking at her through your your lusty eyes how dare you

7040
08:34:27,840 --> 08:34:38,080
have no how dare you labeling on the innocent the innocent target yet it because that's what

7041
08:34:38,080 --> 08:34:44,160
the name of her goes it's all true she's always egging us on

7042
08:34:48,720 --> 08:34:54,160
right I'm gonna send away those assassins that aren't ready to level out properly

7043
08:34:54,720 --> 08:35:01,360
I'll send you on a big big contract big big big big contract

7044
08:35:03,360 --> 08:35:08,640
one two three four five of you

7045
08:35:13,920 --> 08:35:17,440
she turned a guy into a tree like he was asking for okay

7046
08:35:17,760 --> 08:35:23,040
yeah she needs to level up okay she needs to experience what she's doing

7047
08:35:24,240 --> 08:35:30,720
it's not hurtful right we seem to be about 42% use the assassin recruits to assist in

7048
08:35:31,680 --> 08:35:38,320
diversion kill the merchant while remaining undetected easy easy let me squeeze

7049
08:35:40,480 --> 08:35:44,400
gotta get that XP somehow you know what you're right her latest

7050
08:35:45,280 --> 08:35:49,840
alt tweet probably is a misunderstanding exactly you're just reading it wrong okay

7051
08:35:56,000 --> 08:35:57,440
can I like lock on to the guy

7052
08:36:04,640 --> 08:36:06,080

7053
08:36:09,680 --> 08:36:11,280
is it bugged out oh

7054
08:36:15,200 --> 08:36:21,280
oh wait what was the mission use the assassin recruits to assist the night diversion

7055
08:36:25,760 --> 08:36:33,600
oh well that was easy peasy lemon squeezy what's going on here we are discussing how

7056
08:36:34,560 --> 08:36:40,800
how pin pals have you so misunderstood they're looking at you with

7057
08:36:54,080 --> 08:37:00,960
they do I'm trying to tell them that you're innocent okay and that they're not comprehending

7058
08:37:01,920 --> 08:37:08,720
that the you jumping up and down on the bed during your ASMR stream is completely innocent

7059
08:37:08,720 --> 08:37:16,480
and you were literally just singing that song three little monkeys jumping in the bed one fell

7060
08:37:16,480 --> 08:37:22,400
off and bumped its head first game the doctor or something like that i don't know something's in

7061
08:37:23,120 --> 08:37:23,840
sure

7062
08:37:26,880 --> 08:37:27,760
all right i don't get

7063
08:37:31,920 --> 08:37:33,840
we'll do the feathers

7064
08:37:38,160 --> 08:37:39,440
i'm not innocent that's for you

7065
08:37:49,120 --> 08:37:51,440
who among us is innocent truly

7066
08:37:52,800 --> 08:37:56,640
if i were making them among those reference to emi's lore there

7067
08:37:57,440 --> 08:38:03,440
i was like did you like that uh oh wait i don't need to go off and go down

7068
08:38:15,760 --> 08:38:20,800
you leave me sucking out of this you know it has potential don't tell my other one

7069
08:38:21,760 --> 08:38:22,800
i won't accept such

7070
08:38:25,760 --> 08:38:28,000
right you need to jump up here in order to get this flag

7071
08:38:29,680 --> 08:38:33,600
i named him to come across more thieves to do the lure i think i have like two more

7072
08:38:34,320 --> 08:38:40,880
thieves need to lure the guards away i'm sad i missed on these i mean i don't good i'm

7073
08:38:40,880 --> 08:38:46,800
like 99% sure yeah emi's probably gonna do it and it is some more streaming in

7074
08:38:47,520 --> 08:39:00,640
just uh maybe a little less uh a little less ump perhaps you know we can't escape

7075
08:39:02,160 --> 08:39:09,200
the suck it could be another brand of ruler it should be for the the innocent uh the innocent

7076
08:39:09,200 --> 08:39:14,000
side where i just make them do like girlfriend roleplay audios or like that kind of stuff but

7077
08:39:14,000 --> 08:39:18,000
like it's nothing it doesn't like go any further you know

7078
08:39:21,760 --> 08:39:28,880
safer work side that people have been asking for i did get a few emails um management showed me

7079
08:39:28,880 --> 08:39:37,200
them and people were like uh is it required to do that and it was like yep that's very sadly

7080
08:39:37,280 --> 08:39:42,160
kind of the the whole point of the agency um that's where the money is um

7081
08:39:45,040 --> 08:39:49,440
oh oh wait no there's not bored your people here anymore i was getting nervous so i was

7082
08:39:49,440 --> 08:39:54,480
gonna get caught and i'm like wait a minute there's no border oh the books are so good

7083
08:39:55,280 --> 08:40:01,760
eye contact roleplay teaching you eye contact proof i don't know the best way to climb this

7084
08:40:01,760 --> 08:40:04,480
maybe on the outside of the policy that looks up man

7085
08:40:07,840 --> 08:40:09,200
give me that feather

7086
08:40:12,640 --> 08:40:13,440
true love

7087
08:40:14,320 --> 08:40:20,160
girlfriend roleplay something what could a hand-holder roleplay blessing yeah like so i did have a few

7088
08:40:20,160 --> 08:40:26,080
variations of like would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like

7089
08:40:26,080 --> 08:40:31,360
what's the point it's just a real agency at that point

7090
08:40:34,320 --> 08:40:41,600
um where the hype was that other feather oh it's literally split perfectly in the middle

7091
08:40:42,640 --> 08:40:49,040
where there is the jump off point oh wait we have a parachute all right we'll just use a

7092
08:40:49,040 --> 08:40:50,240
parachute off the coliseum

7093
08:40:56,640 --> 08:40:59,760
temple popping roughly where you can hear audible oh in me

7094
08:41:06,240 --> 08:41:07,280
right we're just gonna do this

7095
08:41:07,280 --> 08:41:13,120
here assassinate

7096
08:41:16,400 --> 08:41:22,560
group roleplay is a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well i'm coming out

7097
08:41:23,760 --> 08:41:28,480
uh it just came in each time to sell i only want them to come out once the calling has stopped

7098
08:41:28,480 --> 08:41:38,480
because literally it's like such a shame that it is still happening even though like we're like

7099
08:41:38,480 --> 08:41:41,920
getting into the stage where it's like yeah we've like got proper streams now so i'm not really

7100
08:41:41,920 --> 08:41:47,920
sure what the deal is like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them

7101
08:41:47,920 --> 08:41:52,320
at this point because i'm like what's going on with asmr i think there may have been a stealth

7102
08:41:52,320 --> 08:41:58,160
policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly uh feathers up here um

7103
08:42:04,240 --> 08:42:10,640
this is a little sister you argued has an innocent name yeah i'm not arguing in what's

7104
08:42:10,640 --> 08:42:17,360
innocent it was oh cool okay right we're gonna use the

7105
08:42:21,360 --> 08:42:27,040
yeah there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because

7106
08:42:28,320 --> 08:42:33,920
there's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine

7107
08:42:34,720 --> 08:42:43,040
and they're my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because asmr is such a popular

7108
08:42:43,040 --> 08:42:48,800
category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category and they don't want to come out and say

7109
08:42:48,800 --> 08:42:58,720
it so they're just tackling it like silently basically so it's not arguing this thing um

7110
08:42:59,520 --> 08:43:06,240
i i think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr

7111
08:43:06,240 --> 08:43:12,080
i think they like said it's like one of the top four categories sorry like in the top 10 searches

7112
08:43:12,080 --> 08:43:18,240
a variation of either like foodie in or asmr medicines like whatever you want to kind of

7113
08:43:18,240 --> 08:43:25,920
really get into it um it's like such a high watched category that if they publicly said like

7114
08:43:25,920 --> 08:43:31,120
hey we're drawing the line here now i do think there will be a post at some point

7115
08:43:31,120 --> 08:43:37,920
but at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done so the content is no longer available so when

7116
08:43:37,920 --> 08:43:45,120
they do go publicly like hey we've actually changed this people are like oh that's fine because

7117
08:43:45,120 --> 08:43:49,920
like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know you've been deleting channels less than

7118
08:43:49,920 --> 08:43:57,760
right and uh handing out warnings willy nilly so yeah that's my guess by the way this is absolutely

7119
08:43:57,760 --> 08:44:06,880
not factual this is like just what my genuine like what i think is going on um youtube is

7120
08:44:06,880 --> 08:44:13,040
just like i see yeah it's literally just my guess what's going on it seems the most probable to me

7121
08:44:13,360 --> 08:44:23,600
um so unfortunately i think like you're looking content it's just gonna have to be like

7122
08:44:25,600 --> 08:44:38,160
just straight up upload it to twitter or put on patreon solution and i know a lot of people are

7123
08:44:38,160 --> 08:44:44,720
like oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon unfortunately in order to link your

7124
08:44:44,720 --> 08:44:54,160
patreon successfully um everything must be behind the paywall for like even if it's a fine audio that

7125
08:44:54,160 --> 08:45:01,520
is not wrong with it um it has to all be behind the paywall it's bizarre it's bizarre the rules get

7126
08:45:01,520 --> 08:45:07,760
very arbitrary in memoria now you're wrong youtube's wrong

7127
08:45:14,240 --> 08:45:24,320
all right let me see we've done the feathers i have no idea how many things i've done right we're

7128
08:45:24,320 --> 08:45:26,480
getting close to doing the courtisms

7129
08:45:31,600 --> 08:45:40,560
yeah like we're supposed to enemy stations right we're gonna do that now because i know

7130
08:45:40,560 --> 08:45:47,600
how to do that you have to replay a memory from the french one

7131
08:45:48,320 --> 08:45:50,880
no

7132
08:45:55,280 --> 08:46:03,760
yes this is one can you stream to x i wouldn't stream on twitter no need money

7133
08:46:05,840 --> 08:46:09,520
like i hate to i hate to be that one i know it sounds really sucky we're like money money money

7134
08:46:09,520 --> 08:46:15,200
but it's like the obviously the girls need my support and the thing with youtube vods is like

7135
08:46:16,160 --> 08:46:22,960
you always like make money on youtube vods and like oh yeah once inside your men can

7136
08:46:22,960 --> 08:46:27,120
overpower the camp's patrols correct made money around yes especially if they're patrolling

7137
08:46:27,120 --> 08:46:31,040
i think it's fine saying like yes we're not an agency for greed but at the end of the day we need to

7138
08:46:31,040 --> 08:46:37,680
liberate several suits of french armor and don't and youtube vods is like a fantastic way or the

7139
08:46:37,760 --> 08:46:44,800
youtube adds on like a smaller video for example like this kind of stuff is like free to make

7140
08:46:44,800 --> 08:46:48,880
content like it's free for me to scream right now you know troops will gather it from the dead

7141
08:46:48,880 --> 08:46:55,680
and people underestimate the value of ad revenue via advertise like the free like add

7142
08:46:56,400 --> 08:46:58,720
the armor has to stay clean

7143
08:47:01,280 --> 08:47:07,760
right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like

7144
08:47:07,760 --> 08:47:11,040
oh there's a horse right there oh there's another horse right there

7145
08:47:15,840 --> 08:47:20,000
business is business can't do everything for you unfortunately yes the world does run on

7146
08:47:20,560 --> 08:47:24,800
no i'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these days

7147
08:47:26,080 --> 08:47:32,240
um we'll go this way instead yeah this way is like so much better you basically for some reason

7148
08:47:32,240 --> 08:47:40,960
if you snipe the guys in this one um they count towards that court is on thing but if you snipe

7149
08:47:40,960 --> 08:47:46,880
in general it doesn't count oh sugar i'm sorry no i didn't want to do that

7150
08:47:50,080 --> 08:47:56,400
actually hold on hold on i'm gonna disarm and kill with this one weapon there we go one of five

7151
08:47:57,360 --> 08:48:05,120
nine percent of all my problems from silver money it is a terrible

7152
08:48:11,600 --> 08:48:17,200
okay we might have to do this place place i'm not sure well that guy's coming over to

7153
08:48:17,200 --> 08:48:24,400
investigate thank you another free kill is that guy coming to investigate oh these guys are

7154
08:48:24,400 --> 08:48:32,040
I'll take it.

7155
08:48:32,040 --> 08:48:35,840
I will loot them just so I can get some of them back.

7156
08:48:35,840 --> 08:48:43,120
That's how the next one might be.

7157
08:48:43,120 --> 08:48:48,600
We appreciate that thing, but please do always consider supporting the girls.

7158
08:48:49,600 --> 08:48:52,600
We should get crossbow bolts from this.

7159
08:48:52,600 --> 08:48:54,600
Hydration check, hydration check.

7160
08:48:54,600 --> 08:49:00,600
I've been yammering, but I've not had much water today.

7161
08:49:00,600 --> 08:49:06,600
I don't know when we can submit for monetization yet.

7162
08:49:06,600 --> 08:49:10,600
As I said, the stats are no update.

7163
08:49:10,600 --> 08:49:15,600
So it's kind of just...

7164
08:49:15,600 --> 08:49:18,600
They're very casually like...

7165
08:49:18,600 --> 08:49:20,600
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

7166
08:49:20,600 --> 08:49:22,600
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

7167
08:49:22,600 --> 08:49:24,600
Okay, I'm going to help.

7168
08:49:24,600 --> 08:49:26,600
I'm calling the assassins and...

7169
08:49:29,600 --> 08:49:32,600
Oh, I just teabagged them as they died.

7170
08:49:32,600 --> 08:49:35,600
Okay, that was a rather unit.

7171
08:49:35,600 --> 08:49:37,600
Let's not do that again.

7172
08:49:37,600 --> 08:49:40,600
That was really not a move.

7173
08:49:41,600 --> 08:49:44,600
Mm-hmm.

7174
08:49:44,600 --> 08:49:56,600
But yes, once the YouTube calling stops, then please do look around for very fun ASMR collabs coming out.

7175
08:49:56,600 --> 08:50:01,600
Very, very large ASMR collabs that cost a lot of money put together by Heihou.

7176
08:50:02,600 --> 08:50:19,600
Um, sorry, I'm trying to bramble and think and get this done.

7177
08:50:19,600 --> 08:50:27,600
I like how he's suspicious even though I literally just perished that guy right there.

7178
08:50:27,600 --> 08:50:30,600
God, I wish there was a way to pay for all the girls' patrons at once.

7179
08:50:30,600 --> 08:50:32,600
I just got 16 months back to back.

7180
08:50:32,600 --> 08:50:33,600
Oh, you support them as patrons?

7181
08:50:33,600 --> 08:50:34,600
Thank you so much.

7182
08:50:34,600 --> 08:50:35,600
That's very kind of you.

7183
08:50:35,600 --> 08:50:36,600
Thank you.

7184
08:50:36,600 --> 08:50:42,600
Yes, actually, special thank you to literally anyone who has supported the girls on Patreon.

7185
08:50:42,600 --> 08:50:52,600
I understand the patrons that you have one audio and it's very kind of you to like, you know, reach out and do that even though there's literally one audio.

7186
08:50:52,600 --> 08:50:57,600
And there are coming because the audio is released on the first.

7187
08:50:57,600 --> 08:51:02,600
The girls are going to have a consistent day that their audio in particular comes out.

7188
08:51:02,600 --> 08:51:05,600
I really hope this is counting towards the challenge, actually.

7189
08:51:05,600 --> 08:51:07,600
Um...

7190
08:51:11,600 --> 08:51:14,600
Grave, I'm having to go all the way around.

7191
08:51:15,600 --> 08:51:18,600
Wow.

7192
08:51:21,600 --> 08:51:22,600
Okay, that was it.

7193
08:51:22,600 --> 08:51:27,600
Right, I just need to redo that and then I think that'll be it for the mission.

7194
08:51:27,600 --> 08:51:30,600
Eh, for the crotch design.

7195
08:51:30,600 --> 08:51:33,600
Right, let me just check the DNA sequence.

7196
08:51:33,600 --> 08:51:35,600
I say that as I literally just close it.

7197
08:51:35,600 --> 08:51:39,600
That should have counted quite a bit towards that one.

7198
08:51:42,600 --> 08:51:43,600
Two?

7199
08:51:44,600 --> 08:51:49,600
That came in as two.

7200
08:51:54,600 --> 08:51:56,600
Why did that not work?

7201
08:51:57,600 --> 08:52:00,600
Is it because I kept getting detected?

7202
08:52:02,600 --> 08:52:04,600
Oh, brother.

7203
08:52:08,600 --> 08:52:10,600
Guards on horseback ears.

7204
08:52:10,600 --> 08:52:13,600
Guards killed Will on horseback.

7205
08:52:15,600 --> 08:52:20,600
PayPal guards, I need to go all the way.

7206
08:52:22,600 --> 08:52:24,600
Guards air assassinate from a beam.

7207
08:52:24,600 --> 08:52:27,600
Actually, we're closer to getting the thieves done.

7208
08:52:27,600 --> 08:52:29,600
I need to find a beam.

7209
08:52:29,600 --> 08:52:32,600
I don't know where the beam is to assassinate them.

7210
08:52:34,600 --> 08:52:37,600
The mercenaries one is like absolute killer.

7211
08:52:37,600 --> 08:52:39,600
So we got a patreoner just paid for you.

7212
08:52:39,600 --> 08:52:42,600
Oh, thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it.

7213
08:52:43,600 --> 08:52:46,600
Y'all are expected way more hate.

7214
08:52:46,600 --> 08:52:51,600
Honestly, I think we all did, but I think everyone's just on the same page.

7215
08:52:51,600 --> 08:52:58,600
You're probably tired at this point of your reach over just teasing and teasing and never giving anything.

7216
08:52:58,600 --> 08:53:02,600
And then it's like, yeah, we're just having a good time.

7217
08:53:02,600 --> 08:53:04,600
If you want the goods, you know where they are.

7218
08:53:04,600 --> 08:53:06,600
If you don't, there's also free stuff coming out.

7219
08:53:06,600 --> 08:53:09,600
There's a free video game coming out.

7220
08:53:10,600 --> 08:53:13,600
I think it probably helps without the greed out.

7221
08:53:13,600 --> 08:53:18,600
I think if it was a greedy looking corporation, that probably wouldn't help.

7222
08:53:22,600 --> 08:53:26,600
Right, I'm going to bump into guards and then run away from them and hide in spots.

7223
08:53:28,600 --> 08:53:30,600
We'll do the bump because there's a hay bale right here.

7224
08:53:31,600 --> 08:53:32,600
Excuse me?

7225
08:53:33,600 --> 08:53:34,600
Oh, sugar.

7226
08:53:34,600 --> 08:53:36,600
Oh, I don't think I can hide in this.

7227
08:53:37,600 --> 08:53:42,600
Okay, let's see how fast can I hide now?

7228
08:53:47,600 --> 08:53:48,600
Oh, no.

7229
08:53:48,600 --> 08:53:50,600
Oh, no, they're right next to me.

7230
08:53:53,600 --> 08:53:54,600
No, don't check it.

7231
08:53:54,600 --> 08:53:55,600
Don't check it.

7232
08:53:55,600 --> 08:53:56,600
Don't check it.

7233
08:53:56,600 --> 08:53:57,600
Don't check it.

7234
08:53:57,600 --> 08:53:58,600
Don't check it.

7235
08:54:00,600 --> 08:54:03,600
That shouldn't happen.

7236
08:54:03,600 --> 08:54:05,600
Oh, there's more guards up here.

7237
08:54:05,600 --> 08:54:08,600
I thought this district was like, there's no guards here at all.

7238
08:54:16,600 --> 08:54:17,600
Oh, yes, the bench.

7239
08:54:17,600 --> 08:54:18,600
The bench of safety.

7240
08:54:18,600 --> 08:54:21,600
Okay, I can't go on the bench because it's not like...

7241
08:54:21,600 --> 08:54:24,600
Oh, for goodness sake, how many of you are there?

7242
08:54:26,600 --> 08:54:28,600
Oh, right, I'm hiding in here.

7243
08:54:28,600 --> 08:54:29,600
Can't get me.

7244
08:54:32,600 --> 08:54:33,600
Does that count?

7245
08:54:36,600 --> 08:54:37,600
Did it count?

7246
08:54:37,600 --> 08:54:39,600
He seems still annoyed at me.

7247
08:54:40,600 --> 08:54:43,600
I'm just going to check that counted because if it does...

7248
08:54:44,600 --> 08:54:45,600
Not the poking.

7249
08:54:45,600 --> 08:54:50,600
If that did count, I'm literally just going to keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again.

7250
08:54:52,600 --> 08:54:53,600
I think it should have counted those.

7251
08:54:54,600 --> 08:54:55,600
I did it!

7252
08:54:55,600 --> 08:54:56,600
Right, time to keep bumping into them.

7253
08:54:56,600 --> 08:55:00,600
I'm going to kill this guard up here though because he's going to keep ruining it.

7254
08:55:03,600 --> 08:55:04,600
Yeah.

7255
08:55:06,600 --> 08:55:07,600
Woo!

7256
08:55:11,600 --> 08:55:12,600
Oh!

7257
08:55:12,600 --> 08:55:13,600
Ow!

7258
08:55:14,600 --> 08:55:17,600
Right, let's go upset some guards.

7259
08:55:21,600 --> 08:55:23,600
You smell so bad!

7260
08:55:24,600 --> 08:55:25,600
Tee hee!

7261
08:55:25,600 --> 08:55:27,600
Now you have to chase me.

7262
08:55:30,600 --> 08:55:32,600
Miss me, miss me, now you have to kiss me.

7263
08:55:33,600 --> 08:55:35,600
Oh, is that supposed to jump off?

7264
08:55:40,600 --> 08:55:41,600
Where's the bail hay?

7265
08:55:41,600 --> 08:55:42,600
Oh, there it is.

7266
08:55:52,600 --> 08:55:53,600
A...

7267
08:55:53,600 --> 08:55:54,600
Six.

7268
08:56:00,600 --> 08:56:01,600
Yank!

7269
08:56:03,600 --> 08:56:04,600
I've got to get out of here!

7270
08:56:04,600 --> 08:56:05,600
I've got to get out of here!

7271
08:56:16,600 --> 08:56:19,600
And then we just dive into this again.

7272
08:56:22,600 --> 08:56:23,600
Oh!

7273
08:56:25,600 --> 08:56:26,600
I'm not sure that counted.

7274
08:56:26,600 --> 08:56:28,600
He was like so close.

7275
08:56:29,600 --> 08:56:30,600
You guys should know.

7276
08:56:32,600 --> 08:56:33,600
No, I'm sorry.

7277
08:56:33,600 --> 08:56:34,600
Please excuse me.

7278
08:56:34,600 --> 08:56:35,600
Ah, please excuse me.

7279
08:56:35,600 --> 08:56:36,600
I'm scared.

7280
08:56:36,600 --> 08:56:37,600
There's a table in the way.

7281
08:56:37,600 --> 08:56:38,600
I got nervous.

7282
08:56:38,600 --> 08:56:39,600
I'm sorry.

7283
08:56:42,600 --> 08:56:43,600
Oh no, I can't claim this way.

7284
08:56:43,600 --> 08:56:44,600
Okay, he jumped down again.

7285
08:56:46,600 --> 08:56:47,600
Ah!

7286
08:56:47,600 --> 08:56:48,600
He's gone a long last.

7287
08:56:48,600 --> 08:56:49,600
Please leave him.

7288
08:56:50,600 --> 08:56:51,600
Leave me alone.

7289
08:56:52,600 --> 08:56:53,600
Ah!

7290
08:56:55,600 --> 08:56:56,600
Jump!

7291
08:56:59,600 --> 08:57:01,600
They're like instantly giving up.

7292
08:57:01,600 --> 08:57:04,600
I'm like really worried that it's not counting, but...

7293
08:57:08,600 --> 08:57:09,600
No, it is.

7294
08:57:09,600 --> 08:57:11,600
It just doesn't look like it.

7295
08:57:11,600 --> 08:57:12,600
It looks so silly.

7296
08:57:15,600 --> 08:57:16,600
And Mercy online?

7297
08:57:16,600 --> 08:57:18,600
Heck yeah, Mercy's online.

7298
08:57:18,600 --> 08:57:19,600
Let's go.

7299
08:57:23,600 --> 08:57:26,600
Is there any mods still even awake at this point?

7300
08:57:26,600 --> 08:57:27,600
You're more than welcome to link.

7301
08:57:28,600 --> 08:57:29,600
Mercy.

7302
08:57:32,600 --> 08:57:34,600
And please enjoy your stream.

7303
08:57:35,600 --> 08:57:38,600
I think we're going to wrap up the guild's challenge.

7304
08:57:38,600 --> 08:57:39,600
Oh!

7305
08:57:39,600 --> 08:57:40,600
I hit C.

7306
08:57:40,600 --> 08:57:41,600
I'm just going to squat in the hairball.

7307
08:57:44,600 --> 08:57:45,600
See you in the clip.

7308
08:57:53,600 --> 08:57:54,600
Can you hear that?

7309
08:57:54,600 --> 08:57:55,600
Or am I going crazy?

7310
08:57:59,600 --> 08:58:00,600
Am I going...

7311
08:58:02,600 --> 08:58:05,600
Did I hear that right?

7312
08:58:05,600 --> 08:58:06,600
Yeah, okay.

7313
08:58:06,600 --> 08:58:07,600
I'm going to...

7314
08:58:07,600 --> 08:58:08,600
I was like...

7315
08:58:08,600 --> 08:58:10,600
Are you all hearing that thing?

7316
08:58:12,600 --> 08:58:13,600
Literally.

7317
08:58:15,600 --> 08:58:20,600
I wonder if it's left over ambience from the party sequence with the banker.

7318
08:58:21,600 --> 08:58:22,600
Last one.

7319
08:58:24,600 --> 08:58:25,600
Okay.

7320
08:58:28,600 --> 08:58:29,600
I hear it again.

7321
08:58:29,600 --> 08:58:31,600
Is there like people here?

7322
08:58:31,600 --> 08:58:33,600
Or is it just SFX?

7323
08:58:35,600 --> 08:58:36,600
More like SFX.

7324
08:58:40,600 --> 08:58:42,600
Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here.

7325
08:58:42,600 --> 08:58:44,600
I must just be background ambience.

7326
08:58:44,600 --> 08:58:48,600
That's left over from the party sequence with the banker.

7327
08:58:49,600 --> 08:58:54,600
Let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really aggressive.

7328
08:58:55,600 --> 08:58:57,600
There's still asset, literally.

7329
08:58:57,600 --> 08:58:59,600
The party ended many a day ago.

7330
08:59:00,600 --> 08:59:02,600
They just played an operation.

7331
08:59:04,600 --> 08:59:05,600
Crazy.

7332
08:59:05,600 --> 08:59:06,600
That's crazy.

7333
08:59:06,600 --> 08:59:07,600
Right.

7334
08:59:08,600 --> 08:59:10,600
I'm starting to get a bit delirious.

7335
08:59:12,600 --> 08:59:14,600
How much should we survive though?

7336
08:59:24,600 --> 08:59:25,600
Mm-hmm.

7337
08:59:25,600 --> 08:59:26,600
Mm-hmm.

7338
08:59:27,600 --> 08:59:29,600
I don't know why that did so little.

7339
08:59:36,600 --> 08:59:38,600
I'm watching all the girls, right?

7340
08:59:39,600 --> 08:59:41,600
A long watch strategy before...

7341
08:59:41,600 --> 08:59:42,600
Isn't there not too much noise?

7342
08:59:42,600 --> 08:59:44,600
Like, there's too much noise going on.

7343
08:59:44,600 --> 08:59:45,600
Like, focus.

7344
08:59:48,600 --> 08:59:50,600
We're all blabbing away at once.

7345
08:59:51,600 --> 08:59:52,600
Blabbing.

7346
08:59:57,600 --> 08:59:59,600
I'm not too sure what to do.

7347
08:59:59,600 --> 09:00:00,600
I'm kind of getting...

7348
09:00:00,600 --> 09:00:01,600
I'm not, like, stuck.

7349
09:00:01,600 --> 09:00:02,600
I know we can do those things.

7350
09:00:02,600 --> 09:00:06,600
I'm just, like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do.

7351
09:00:09,600 --> 09:00:10,600
Um...

7352
09:00:14,600 --> 09:00:15,600
I'm just, like...

7353
09:00:16,600 --> 09:00:19,600
Do we call it and then the next thing come on?

7354
09:00:19,600 --> 09:00:20,600
Am I gonna...

7355
09:00:20,600 --> 09:00:22,600
I'm like, I'm saying it myself.

7356
09:00:22,600 --> 09:00:25,600
Am I gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now?

7357
09:00:25,600 --> 09:00:26,600
Is one.

7358
09:00:27,600 --> 09:00:28,600
Think I'm...

7359
09:00:28,600 --> 09:00:30,600
I think I'm in back yet?

7360
09:00:31,600 --> 09:00:34,600
Oh, in 19 seconds they come back.

7361
09:00:35,600 --> 09:00:41,600
Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that.

7362
09:00:44,600 --> 09:00:45,600
I can only focus...

7363
09:00:45,600 --> 09:00:46,600
It's hard to multitask.

7364
09:00:46,600 --> 09:00:48,600
I'm watchable script, right?

7365
09:00:50,600 --> 09:00:51,600
But Mercy is alive.

7366
09:00:51,600 --> 09:00:52,600
If anyone would like to watch...

7367
09:00:52,600 --> 09:00:53,600
Mm, Mercy Modis.

7368
09:00:55,600 --> 09:00:56,600
Oh, I saw that.

7369
09:00:56,600 --> 09:00:57,600
Okay, there are...

7370
09:00:58,600 --> 09:01:01,600
There are thieves somewhere on the roof up here.

7371
09:01:04,600 --> 09:01:05,600
No.

7372
09:01:11,600 --> 09:01:12,600
I'm just coercing.

7373
09:01:13,600 --> 09:01:14,600
Um...

7374
09:01:14,600 --> 09:01:15,600
Um...

7375
09:01:17,600 --> 09:01:22,600
I think for simplicity we'll just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them.

7376
09:01:22,600 --> 09:01:24,600
I struggle so much to find thieves.

7377
09:01:24,600 --> 09:01:28,600
I understand they're on roof tops, but they make it so freaking hard.

7378
09:01:29,600 --> 09:01:30,600
Run Vods of...

7379
09:01:31,600 --> 09:01:34,600
Run Vods of all six at once and let it just fry your brain.

7380
09:01:35,600 --> 09:01:37,600
Most of that is four, but only one audio.

7381
09:01:37,600 --> 09:01:43,600
Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get saved once POV.

7382
09:01:45,600 --> 09:01:46,600
Mm...

7383
09:01:46,600 --> 09:01:48,600
I have teleported to the wrong place.

7384
09:01:48,600 --> 09:01:49,600
I was not paying attention.

7385
09:01:49,600 --> 09:01:50,600
I apologize.

7386
09:01:50,600 --> 09:01:52,600
Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy.

7387
09:01:52,600 --> 09:01:53,600
Hello?

7388
09:01:53,600 --> 09:01:55,600
Would you like to be purchased?

7389
09:01:59,600 --> 09:02:01,600
It would be a shame not to do Christina though.

7390
09:02:01,600 --> 09:02:03,600
Like we're actually so close.

7391
09:02:06,600 --> 09:02:07,600
Ah!

7392
09:02:08,600 --> 09:02:11,600
What's the percentage we need for Christina?

7393
09:02:15,600 --> 09:02:20,600
Why is your accent so cool?

7394
09:02:20,600 --> 09:02:22,600
Spondin' Scotland!

7395
09:02:23,600 --> 09:02:24,600
And...

7396
09:02:24,600 --> 09:02:26,600
Always be Scottish.

7397
09:02:26,600 --> 09:02:28,600
It's very hard to unlearn that accent.

7398
09:02:29,600 --> 09:02:30,600
I even think it's possible.

7399
09:02:32,600 --> 09:02:33,600
Truly outlawing it.

7400
09:02:34,600 --> 09:02:35,600
Um...

7401
09:02:35,600 --> 09:02:36,600
Why was I here again?

7402
09:02:36,600 --> 09:02:40,600
Oh, to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here.

7403
09:02:41,600 --> 09:02:43,600
I need to hire one group of thieves.

7404
09:02:43,600 --> 09:02:44,600
Is this for real?

7405
09:02:44,600 --> 09:02:45,600
For real?

7406
09:02:45,600 --> 09:02:46,600
Like for real?

7407
09:02:46,600 --> 09:02:47,600
For real?

7408
09:02:49,600 --> 09:02:54,600
Well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over.

7409
09:02:55,600 --> 09:02:58,600
And it's kind of in this general area.

7410
09:02:59,600 --> 09:03:00,600
I'm at...

7411
09:03:02,600 --> 09:03:04,600
Unbelievably.

7412
09:03:04,600 --> 09:03:06,600
I'm at 69%.

7413
09:03:06,600 --> 09:03:07,600
Um...

7414
09:03:11,600 --> 09:03:12,600
Like...

7415
09:03:13,600 --> 09:03:14,600
I don't know why.

7416
09:03:15,600 --> 09:03:17,600
Locate memory and world.

7417
09:03:17,600 --> 09:03:19,600
Insufficient data to accent.

7418
09:03:19,600 --> 09:03:20,600
Locate memory and world.

7419
09:03:20,600 --> 09:03:23,600
Go to memory start point to synchronize with animals.

7420
09:03:23,600 --> 09:03:24,600
Gotta go to work.

7421
09:03:24,600 --> 09:03:26,600
Have fun at work.

7422
09:03:26,600 --> 09:03:29,600
If you could have any other accent, what would it be?

7423
09:03:35,600 --> 09:03:36,600
Ah!

7424
09:03:36,600 --> 09:03:38,600
Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it.

7425
09:03:38,600 --> 09:03:39,600
That's missing.

7426
09:03:39,600 --> 09:03:40,600
We'll do Copernacle.

7427
09:03:41,600 --> 09:03:43,600
Um, as for accent...

7428
09:03:48,600 --> 09:03:50,600
I can't imagine myself wearing her now, honestly.

7429
09:03:51,600 --> 09:03:52,600
Like, to pick one.

7430
09:03:53,600 --> 09:03:55,600
The Italian accent can be really nice.

7431
09:03:55,600 --> 09:04:00,600
Although the Japanese voices are so nice and pitched.

7432
09:04:02,600 --> 09:04:04,600
Which I really enjoy.

7433
09:04:04,600 --> 09:04:07,600
But I guess it's pitch and no actual voice.

7434
09:04:10,600 --> 09:04:11,600
Uh...

7435
09:04:12,600 --> 09:04:13,600
Her accent.

7436
09:04:15,600 --> 09:04:21,600
Honestly, I don't actually mind a Polish accent.

7437
09:04:21,600 --> 09:04:25,600
If you've ever listened to a sweet Polish accent,

7438
09:04:25,600 --> 09:04:27,600
it can actually be really soothing.

7439
09:04:28,600 --> 09:04:31,600
Just a little hint of her words from that.

7440
09:04:31,600 --> 09:04:32,600
It's pretty good.

7441
09:04:32,600 --> 09:04:35,600
Apply the Scottish accent to any language.

7442
09:04:35,600 --> 09:04:36,600
Any language.

7443
09:04:38,600 --> 09:04:39,600
Oh, you might apply it.

7444
09:04:43,600 --> 09:04:44,600
I want you.

7445
09:04:47,600 --> 09:04:48,600
I want sex now.

7446
09:04:51,600 --> 09:04:52,600
As you believed.

7447
09:04:55,600 --> 09:04:56,600
Volgmae.

7448
09:04:57,600 --> 09:04:58,600
That's Scottish Dutch.

7449
09:05:01,600 --> 09:05:02,600
That's pretty awful.

7450
09:05:03,600 --> 09:05:04,600
Pray rough.

7451
09:05:04,600 --> 09:05:05,600
Pray rough.

7452
09:05:05,600 --> 09:05:07,600
Right, we'll try Copernacle,

7453
09:05:07,600 --> 09:05:11,600
but this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA.

7454
09:05:11,600 --> 09:05:12,600
I think I'm gonna...

7455
09:05:12,600 --> 09:05:14,600
I think I'm perishing.

7456
09:05:15,600 --> 09:05:16,600
Unfortunately.

7457
09:05:18,600 --> 09:05:22,600
And it might be wiser to redirect into Mercy

7458
09:05:22,600 --> 09:05:23,600
and kind of have a break

7459
09:05:23,600 --> 09:05:26,600
and deal with these ASMR collages

7460
09:05:26,600 --> 09:05:27,600
and see what I'm looking at,

7461
09:05:27,600 --> 09:05:31,600
because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit.

7462
09:05:31,600 --> 09:05:34,600
The world itself is unchanging.

7463
09:05:34,600 --> 09:05:37,600
We must change to understand it.

7464
09:05:37,600 --> 09:05:38,600
It's secret.

7465
09:05:39,600 --> 09:05:41,600
Scottish is the best accent in British Isles.

7466
09:05:41,600 --> 09:05:42,600
Who is this man?

7467
09:05:43,600 --> 09:05:44,600
He comes from Russia.

7468
09:05:44,600 --> 09:05:45,600
The Welsh accent.

7469
09:05:45,600 --> 09:05:46,600
I hear his studies at Iboticalo,

7470
09:05:46,600 --> 09:05:49,600
but his words are unlike any other issue from that place.

7471
09:05:50,600 --> 09:05:52,600
I don't buy it to put Scottish accents first.

7472
09:05:53,600 --> 09:05:54,600
Scottish is magical.

7473
09:05:54,600 --> 09:05:56,600
Hearing German speaking with songs that we're in.

7474
09:05:56,600 --> 09:05:58,600
You're not good at the spheres dancing around the earth.

7475
09:05:59,600 --> 09:06:01,600
You know you have a good source accent

7476
09:06:01,600 --> 09:06:03,600
when people can't even understand you.

7477
09:06:07,600 --> 09:06:09,600
I could use an excuse to go to bed.

7478
09:06:09,600 --> 09:06:10,600
Yeah, I'm kind of like,

7479
09:06:10,600 --> 09:06:11,600
I think I'm actually lagging.

7480
09:06:11,600 --> 09:06:12,600
I can't believe it.

7481
09:06:12,600 --> 09:06:15,600
You're me saying I'm an endurance streamer.

7482
09:06:15,600 --> 09:06:16,600
I'm a liar.

7483
09:06:19,600 --> 09:06:20,600
How long did we make it?

7484
09:06:20,600 --> 09:06:21,600
How long did we make it?

7485
09:06:27,600 --> 09:06:29,600
Take no damage during the ambush.

7486
09:06:29,600 --> 09:06:30,600
Right, get the wee knife.

7487
09:06:32,600 --> 09:06:33,600
Two minutes!

7488
09:06:36,600 --> 09:06:37,600
Let's get the wee knife.

7489
09:06:40,600 --> 09:06:41,600
No.

7490
09:06:42,600 --> 09:06:43,600
Yeah, that's what I meant.

7491
09:06:44,600 --> 09:06:47,600
I'm going to call in two of my assassins.

7492
09:06:50,600 --> 09:06:52,600
That was way too early.

7493
09:06:52,600 --> 09:06:54,600
You saw the way he was wiggling that knife.

7494
09:06:58,600 --> 09:06:59,600
Whoa, why are you...

7495
09:06:59,600 --> 09:07:01,600
You know the guy that's right in front of us?

7496
09:07:01,600 --> 09:07:02,600
Maybe focus on my guy.

7497
09:07:05,600 --> 09:07:06,600
Oh no, my assassins...

7498
09:07:07,600 --> 09:07:09,600
Okay, my assassins are sticking around,

7499
09:07:09,600 --> 09:07:10,600
which I'm quite happy about.

7500
09:07:10,600 --> 09:07:12,600
I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins.

7501
09:07:13,600 --> 09:07:15,600
Just because...

7502
09:07:16,600 --> 09:07:18,600
If they kill them too fast,

7503
09:07:18,600 --> 09:07:20,600
they actually might all be spawned

7504
09:07:20,600 --> 09:07:21,600
and not help me at all,

7505
09:07:21,600 --> 09:07:23,600
which is quite funny to think about.

7506
09:07:24,600 --> 09:07:26,600
I do wish citizens would stop running

7507
09:07:26,600 --> 09:07:28,600
into the middle of the fight or near it.

7508
09:07:28,600 --> 09:07:29,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7509
09:07:29,600 --> 09:07:30,600
Don't hurt me, please.

7510
09:07:31,600 --> 09:07:33,600
If I take no damage, I win.

7511
09:07:37,600 --> 09:07:38,600
Oh.

7512
09:07:38,600 --> 09:07:39,600
I'm scared!

7513
09:07:39,600 --> 09:07:42,600
He's got such a long, frickin' pole!

7514
09:07:42,600 --> 09:07:44,600
He's got such a long, frickin' pole!

7515
09:07:45,600 --> 09:07:47,600
He's gonna hit me with it!

7516
09:07:50,600 --> 09:07:52,600
My assassin is trying to chase them,

7517
09:07:52,600 --> 09:07:53,600
but it's not happening.

7518
09:07:58,600 --> 09:07:59,600
I'm just hiding.

7519
09:07:59,600 --> 09:08:01,600
I'm letting my assassins do it.

7520
09:08:01,600 --> 09:08:02,600
Copernicus is fine.

7521
09:08:02,600 --> 09:08:04,600
His health bar is fine.

7522
09:08:08,600 --> 09:08:09,600
Oh, I got fined.

7523
09:08:09,600 --> 09:08:10,600
Oh, they caught me.

7524
09:08:12,600 --> 09:08:14,600
I don't want to get hit.

7525
09:08:14,600 --> 09:08:15,600
I'm so close to doing no hit.

7526
09:08:15,600 --> 09:08:18,600
Please, please, please.

7527
09:08:18,600 --> 09:08:19,600
Please.

7528
09:08:19,600 --> 09:08:21,600
Literally 13 seconds is all I ask.

7529
09:08:23,600 --> 09:08:24,600
Don't change up.

7530
09:08:24,600 --> 09:08:26,600
Don't do anything else.

7531
09:08:27,600 --> 09:08:29,600
Just four more seconds.

7532
09:08:31,600 --> 09:08:32,600
Okay, we did it.

7533
09:08:33,600 --> 09:08:34,600
We did it.

7534
09:08:34,600 --> 09:08:35,600
We did it.

7535
09:08:35,600 --> 09:08:36,600
We did it.

7536
09:08:36,600 --> 09:08:37,600
We did it.

7537
09:08:37,600 --> 09:08:38,600
We did it.

7538
09:08:38,600 --> 09:08:39,600
We did it.

7539
09:08:39,600 --> 09:08:40,600
I think we can do it.

7540
09:08:40,600 --> 09:08:41,600
I'm still running away

7541
09:08:41,600 --> 09:08:42,600
in case it counts.

7542
09:08:42,600 --> 09:08:43,600
I think it counts,

7543
09:08:43,600 --> 09:08:44,600
but I'm just gonna keep running,

7544
09:08:44,600 --> 09:08:46,600
running and running

7545
09:08:46,600 --> 09:08:48,600
in circles around the fountain.

7546
09:08:48,600 --> 09:08:49,600
Okay.

7547
09:08:52,600 --> 09:08:53,600
Yeah!

7548
09:08:54,600 --> 09:08:55,600
That's right.

7549
09:08:55,600 --> 09:08:56,600
I did that.

7550
09:09:01,600 --> 09:09:02,600
What did I do?

7551
09:09:05,600 --> 09:09:07,600
I didn't go up that much.

7552
09:09:09,600 --> 09:09:11,600
Right, I have terrible news.

7553
09:09:11,600 --> 09:09:13,600
Fake endurance streamer.

7554
09:09:13,600 --> 09:09:14,600
Absolutely horrible news.

7555
09:09:14,600 --> 09:09:15,600
100% poggers.

7556
09:09:15,600 --> 09:09:16,600
Yay!

7557
09:09:16,600 --> 09:09:18,600
You said 100%!

7558
09:09:19,600 --> 09:09:21,600
Now, we may genuinely return

7559
09:09:21,600 --> 09:09:23,600
to Brotherhood again

7560
09:09:23,600 --> 09:09:24,600
at a later date.

7561
09:09:26,600 --> 09:09:27,600
But I'm actually quite satisfied.

7562
09:09:27,600 --> 09:09:28,600
Literally, we did the campaign.

7563
09:09:28,600 --> 09:09:30,600
We've done all the DLC stuff now.

7564
09:09:31,600 --> 09:09:32,600
You did that so hard

7565
09:09:32,600 --> 09:09:34,600
that other people didn't find it.

7566
09:09:36,600 --> 09:09:37,600
Strolling it, if you don't finish it,

7567
09:09:37,600 --> 09:09:40,600
just means you need to do it.

7568
09:09:40,600 --> 09:09:41,600
Yes, I actually wouldn't mind

7569
09:09:41,600 --> 09:09:43,600
revisiting it at a later date.

7570
09:09:43,600 --> 09:09:44,600
I would like to play a bit more

7571
09:09:44,600 --> 09:09:46,600
Variety at this point.

7572
09:09:46,600 --> 09:09:48,600
I'm going to redirect

7573
09:09:48,600 --> 09:09:49,600
into

7574
09:09:51,600 --> 09:09:53,600
Mercy, so we can all enjoy her.

7575
09:09:54,600 --> 09:09:55,600
I can't believe it.

7576
09:09:55,600 --> 09:09:56,600
I'm not a real endurance streamer.

7577
09:09:56,600 --> 09:09:57,600
I only lasted

7578
09:09:58,600 --> 09:09:59,600
nine hours this time.

7579
09:09:59,600 --> 09:10:00,600
Gee willa curse.

7580
09:10:01,600 --> 09:10:03,600
Oh, I'm kind of basic.

7581
09:10:04,600 --> 09:10:05,600
I can't believe it.

7582
09:10:05,600 --> 09:10:06,600
I can't believe it.

7583
09:10:09,600 --> 09:10:11,600
Please do consider giving

7584
09:10:11,600 --> 09:10:13,600
a like and a subscribe

7585
09:10:13,600 --> 09:10:14,600
if you enjoyed.

7586
09:10:14,600 --> 09:10:15,600
YouTube may have unscripted

7587
09:10:16,600 --> 09:10:17,600
but don't worry,

7588
09:10:17,600 --> 09:10:19,600
I'm going to redirect you

7589
09:10:19,600 --> 09:10:20,600
into Mercy.

7590
09:10:22,600 --> 09:10:23,600
Into Merchandise.

7591
09:10:25,600 --> 09:10:28,600
Redirect, select stream.

7592
09:10:28,600 --> 09:10:31,600
Oh, she's playing Omori.

7593
09:10:31,600 --> 09:10:32,600
Omori.

7594
09:10:33,600 --> 09:10:35,600
That's Omori

7595
09:10:36,600 --> 09:10:37,600
when

7596
09:10:37,600 --> 09:10:39,600
Mercy plays

7597
09:10:39,600 --> 09:10:41,600
the tippy tippy thing.

7598
09:10:43,600 --> 09:10:44,600
That's pretty good.

7599
09:10:44,600 --> 09:10:45,600
Yeah, that's pretty good.

7600
09:10:55,600 --> 09:10:57,600
I got a copyright

7601
09:10:57,600 --> 09:10:59,600
on my Assassin's Creed Playthrough game

7602
09:10:59,600 --> 09:11:00,600
yesterday.

7603
09:11:01,600 --> 09:11:02,600
What?

7604
09:11:02,600 --> 09:11:03,600
Sorry, I just spotted that right now

7605
09:11:03,600 --> 09:11:04,600
and I'm like,

7606
09:11:04,600 --> 09:11:05,600
what?

7607
09:11:05,600 --> 09:11:06,600
I apologize.

7608
09:11:06,600 --> 09:11:08,600
Thank you so, so much

7609
09:11:08,600 --> 09:11:10,600
my lovely beflings

7610
09:11:10,600 --> 09:11:11,600
for watching.

7611
09:11:12,600 --> 09:11:13,600
Literally, I just checked it out.

7612
09:11:13,600 --> 09:11:14,600
I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game

7613
09:11:14,600 --> 09:11:15,600
has no copyright,

7614
09:11:15,600 --> 09:11:17,600
so it's a false copyright thing

7615
09:11:17,600 --> 09:11:18,600
going on.

7616
09:11:18,600 --> 09:11:19,600
But thank you so, so much

7617
09:11:19,600 --> 09:11:20,600
for hanging out.

7618
09:11:21,600 --> 09:11:23,600
Yeah, maybe not 100%

7619
09:11:23,600 --> 09:11:24,600
for the first time,

7620
09:11:24,600 --> 09:11:25,600
but we'll give it a shot.

7621
09:11:25,600 --> 09:11:26,600
I think we'll come back

7622
09:11:26,600 --> 09:11:27,600
and we'll feel refreshed

7623
09:11:27,600 --> 09:11:28,600
at a later date

7624
09:11:29,600 --> 09:11:30,600
because that was a lot of

7625
09:11:30,600 --> 09:11:31,600
jumping about.

7626
09:11:31,600 --> 09:11:32,600
I think that's brought

7627
09:11:32,600 --> 09:11:33,600
20 hours

7628
09:11:33,600 --> 09:11:34,600
combined

7629
09:11:34,600 --> 09:11:35,600
at this point.

7630
09:11:35,600 --> 09:11:36,600
So thank you

7631
09:11:36,600 --> 09:11:37,600
so, so much for hanging.

7632
09:11:37,600 --> 09:11:38,600
Tomorrow we're playing

7633
09:11:38,600 --> 09:11:39,600
Needy Streamer Overload.

7634
09:11:39,600 --> 09:11:41,600
I haven't played it.

7635
09:11:41,600 --> 09:11:42,600
So I'm not quite sure

7636
09:11:42,600 --> 09:11:43,600
what to expect,

7637
09:11:43,600 --> 09:11:44,600
but it is a shorter stream

7638
09:11:44,600 --> 09:11:45,600
for me.

7639
09:11:45,600 --> 09:11:46,600
So for those of you

7640
09:11:46,600 --> 09:11:47,600
who like the endurance side

7641
09:11:47,600 --> 09:11:48,600
of things,

7642
09:11:48,600 --> 09:11:49,600
I apologize,

7643
09:11:49,600 --> 09:11:50,600
but my stamina

7644
09:11:50,600 --> 09:11:51,600
is lacking tomorrow.

7645
09:11:52,600 --> 09:11:53,600
But nevertheless,

7646
09:11:53,600 --> 09:11:54,600
it's always fantastic.

7647
09:11:54,600 --> 09:11:55,600
Thank you so, so much.

7648
09:11:55,600 --> 09:11:56,600
My little beflings

7649
09:11:56,600 --> 09:11:57,600
or those who are watching,

7650
09:11:57,600 --> 09:12:01,600
and I will see you tomorrow

7651
09:12:01,600 --> 09:12:03,600
and say hi to Mercy.

7652
09:12:03,600 --> 09:12:04,600
I will talk,

7653
09:12:04,600 --> 09:12:05,600
I will talk in Mercy's chat

7654
09:12:05,600 --> 09:12:06,600
for a little bit,

7655
09:12:06,600 --> 09:12:08,600
but I do need to go

7656
09:12:08,600 --> 09:12:09,600
for the big P.

7657
09:12:09,600 --> 09:12:10,600
I'm not even going to pretend

7658
09:12:10,600 --> 09:12:11,600
otherwise,

7659
09:12:11,600 --> 09:12:12,600
I need to pay pass.

7660
09:12:12,600 --> 09:12:14,600
So I'll see you tomorrow.

7661
09:12:14,600 --> 09:12:15,600
Okay, bye-bye.

7662
09:12:21,600 --> 09:12:22,600
Bye-bye for now.

7663
09:12:22,600 --> 09:12:23,600
See you tomorrow.

7664
09:12:23,600 --> 09:12:24,600
Bye-bye.

7665
09:12:26,600 --> 09:12:27,600
Bye-bye.
