WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Focus on your life so you can let your dreams come back to you.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
No, I don't want to play any more.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Go back real.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Save your dreams.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
It took 1,000 years to perfect the battle machine.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
But it's only a second to pull the trigger.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Good morning.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Last morning, you got the Atlantic Sea?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You don't watch the sea?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
You don't watch the sea?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Well...

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Sorry, game's still out, game's still out.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Return back to the...

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
To what? To speak?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh my god. Make phones in my arms.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay. Well good morning.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Good evening. Good afternoon.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Have fantastic news.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I slept.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh my god.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I slept.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
The fucking Christmas party.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Uh...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I also...

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Also give him an animal.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Give him an animal. Oh.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
So now I no longer have the belly of someone that has 5 days old.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Uh...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Shit.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Basically...

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Can we finish the Yumi camp?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Sorry, this was a disgusting thing I could probably ever see.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And it's first thing in the morning.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Um...

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Basically started after the Yumi...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Um...

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh yeah. Oh no, this can't be.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Put me on easy. Come on.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Current levels. Suffer the silence.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I can't pick anything else.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh no.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh no, this can't be.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Creatin' you? Oh no.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We can only pick make warrior.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We have to do normal difficulty.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
We can't just do camp.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Right, anyway.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Very quickly summarized what happened.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
After the fantastic Yumi plus collab,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
which was an absolute hoot and holler,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
turns out we all love each other.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Um...

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I basically passed out

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
for six hours.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And then I woke up and I was like...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Ugh, my stomach, my stomach.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Ugh, I can't do this anymore.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So I give him an innermot

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
and I did that.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And I ended up...

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I ended up passing out

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
again after that.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And I woke up with five minutes to go.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So all in all,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I ended up sleeping 12 hours.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I woke up with a massive headache.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That's not gonna stop me. I'm taking painkillers.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Turns out I am...

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I freaking...

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But I accidentally hydrate

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
via my fucking ass.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Because it didn't come out at first.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And I was like, excuse me?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Water? Where did you go?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Hmm...

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Um, so that was actually taking room.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
No.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Uh...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The good news is...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We're playing...

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
It's technically a childhood game,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
but I was actually too weak

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
to play this at any point.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So I know of,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
you know, all the mech

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
types and all of that.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Because I watched my dad play this game, basically.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So I don't even know if we're gonna successfully

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
get through it, but it doesn't matter.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Because we're gonna try our best.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I do have a ASMR

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
membership stream planned.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
As well, at the end of this.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Now, if we do get hard stuff,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
uh...

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
My plan is to throw mech

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
assault out the window, and then

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I'll just do my membership.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Eh...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Take time for your health.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Literally,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I kid you not, I should have played this

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
when my...

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
When my dad gets here.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Because he could unironically...

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
He plays...

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Uh, you know what?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I'll remember the map when we get on it.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The last map, as Atlas,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
he absolutely adores

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
and the other one, he absolutely adores.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
There's one where you can, like, level all the buildings.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And...

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So, my dad...

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
He's a wee bit, like,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
mean, he's a wee bit autistic, but he doesn't realize it.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And he used to play the same map

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
over and over again, and did the exact same thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Same thing, over and over again. It's rather adorable.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Can you change the difficulty

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
if you're creating your profile?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
No.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It's just, like...

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh my god, axes!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Viva la France!

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Eh...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, it doesn't want to do anything.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Just stay back facing them.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I mean, I guess...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Whoa! Okay, I guess I just...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh wait, current levels

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
suffer this silence.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's not much of a sufferage.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm guessing this is, like, corporal

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
ranks, because in this mecha game

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
you are...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Um...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
You'll never guess what.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You're piloting a mecha!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Ah!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Ah!

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
What are the odds?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Um...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But yes, sorry, I'm just waking up a wee bit.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh, aces!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Snowberries!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No, I'm piloting a mecha!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Mech asshole!

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh my god!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
This is both their fault.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Shut up, Isla.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'll jump in it right now.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Hi!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Snowberries!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Guten Morgan!

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm currently slurping on my little teeth.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And then we're going to jump into this game

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
called Mech Assault.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
It is an Xbox original!

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Not even Xbox...

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Not even Xbox 360!

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
This was an Xbox

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
No...

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Wait!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Wait a minute!

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
This is the early...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
The first mission!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Ooh!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It has a lady pie!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Hi, AC!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I think she's going to be resting.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And then hi, Snowberries!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We're playing Mech Assault, we're about to go speak to

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
the lady!

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Now, you might notice my title is the most bizarre thing

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
you've ever fucking read out of context.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
We took part from the heavy Mechs

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
to fix the Cougar Scout Mech!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Um, well, yeah!

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Wait, what time?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm going to drink my tea.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Hey, sport, you ready?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I've got our orders.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
The invasion still steps off as planned.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
We're not paying us to be late.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
But the best part is that we get to go in first.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Just like old times.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
The Intel boys say the enemy is powering up

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
a set of nasty, ground-to-orbit guns.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
If those are online when the rest of the dragoons arrive,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
everyone dies.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And we blow our bonus.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So our little team gets to make a covert landing

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
outside the range of the existing guns,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
sneak across half a continent,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and take them out before our dropships show up.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think it's Loki, we play first.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I think it's Loki, we play first.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Me?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Wait, is that Logan?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That makes me call Logan.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Wait.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Wait, so that's the intro.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So then, eating dirt is the first mission.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
All systems normal.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We're in the pipe. Touchdown in two minutes.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh my god. It's like a pixel on my screen.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
We've been scammed.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Weapon fire inbound.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Lieutenant Foster, how did they detect us?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Alpha, Bravo landers.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Prepare to hot-drop.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I want you out of this grave now.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Brace yourselves, boys. We're going in.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Is this the first mission?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Or am I picked the wrong one?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Wait, these are...

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Wait.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Why does it say select mission,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and I keep getting fucking...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
The operation is off to a bad start,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
but the Icarus is not granted.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Our job will be much harder.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Why do I keep getting cutscene?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, this is the first mission.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Here's a quick status report.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Alright, it's Cougar Scout Mac.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I knew it was Cougar.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I knew it was Cougar Scout Mac,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
because of this voiceline coming up.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Oh.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, my God.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Holy...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Holy moly.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Holy moly.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, my God.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh, my PC's ready to catch fire

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
because it's kind of...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
weird thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So, there's a hidden multiplayer...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So, this game used to be multiplayer,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and there's a hidden function in it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, yeah, be safe.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
There's three baddies.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh, my God, my PC's ready to catch fire.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
If I randomly go offline,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
you know exactly what.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Right.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Are they so brave?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Why are you coming up against them, then?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Look at the size of me.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, my goodness.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Right.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
So, the thing about NCT 2

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
is you can just walk on it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Oh.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I don't know if you can hear that.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
They're going up.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Oh.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Right.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Next.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Why...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Why changes?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Okay.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Okay.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Next.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Is that a ship?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I think he's glitched out.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Oh, right.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
It controls the ammo type by X, Y, and Bravo.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
A trained mech of work.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Destroy it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Weapons. Use your left trigger

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
to cycle through the weapons,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
or just...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's official.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
They know we're here and they will be coming for us.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Coming back for more?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh, my God.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Be sure to secure any sound that you find.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
The game audio is so loud.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Ah.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Right.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So, we want music down

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
and we want sound down,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
so you guys can actually hear the in-game ending.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
How's this?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I don't know why my mic is acting

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
all quiet all of a sudden.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It's normally like, I'm so freaking loud into it.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm feeding it through the thing.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
How's that?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Kind of.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
How's that louder?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Well...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I see a max gain right now.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Filters.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Gains.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Okay, this is up by 14 decibels now.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Testing.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Test tickles.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Testing the tickles.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Repeat, testing the tickles.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Oh, see, these are health pads.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
See that green box?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's for health.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Maybe we were destined

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
for the longest collab.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay, it sounds much better.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Much better.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Test.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I can't remember what blues for my ultimate.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
No.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So, if you lose health,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
you can pick up one there.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And then, I guess,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
that must be for this.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Again.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, the blue must give infinite.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh, almost.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
A new...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Attackable one.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, you literally step on them.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
God, this game is actually kind of brutal for its time.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
When you...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Yep.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Fucking supply convoy.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, my God, my aimbot.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
They never told me this game didn't come with aimbot, okay?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm trying not to get hit by it

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
because it's in the necklace.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm spraying.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Oh, that's the supply convoy already?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Holy crap.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Oh, my God.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I can't beat him.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm getting rules.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm getting rules.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Wait.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Why was my dad so much better at this game?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
No, this can't be.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Fuck the rules.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Okay, there we go.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
There we go.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Like, I was like, way ahead of me.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hold on.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
No, there's more.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Hold on, there's enemies.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, no, I'm like half health already

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
because I'm getting too ahead of myself.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Wait, there is aimbot on this one.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay, I'm staying on this one then.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Like, aimuses.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The AI in this game is brutal.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Let me heal up.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Don't make me a bad mech warrior.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Come on.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Come on, let me heal up.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
There was the turret.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Come forward.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Bro, I'm trying evasive maneuvers.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
They're actually not working.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm not being funny.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I can't evasive maneuver and aim at the same time.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Can you not destroy these?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You must. Okay, I was going to say you must.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Bro, forget.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
They're leveling me. This is the tutorial.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
My mech is sparking.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's actually ogre.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's so ogre when I started.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
My mech is sparking.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
My audio is on.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I don't know what the fuck the among us collab did.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't know why I'm so quiet.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I can't fly.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I'm literally sparking.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Bro, we're already doing the fucking ace of marching

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
before I knew it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Whoa.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Okay.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Well, something just shot.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I was going to say something just shot.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Wait, hold on.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I want to use my summer heal.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Thank you, jeez.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I've got more rocket.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Oh, it's just swapped me a rock.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, and you pick up the ammo tape.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It swaps you.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Fuck.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Stop it.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Oh my god, I'm actually going to lose.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm actually going to fucking lose.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Um, this is the tutorial.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I'm not even kidding.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Why are freaking video games so brutal?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
They did not care about anyone's feelings.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Honestly, they were like,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
no, you either win or you lose.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Fuck you. You have to use this thing again.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Like, where's most of these fucking things?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Sending a scout unit

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and a frontal attack.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Absolutely genius.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And Diego.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Thank you for coming to member.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I'm to level this city.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I hear a chopper.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Why do I hear a chopper?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, it's you.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh, this is mean.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
People are just trying to either.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Can you aim for that?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Whoa.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Who do you think you are?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Okay, we're going for the health here.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Fuck. I knew there was a man.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
No, these are...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I think these are looking.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Oh, no.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh, no.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Give me the fucking health right now.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Where is it?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Don't do this to me.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm actually going to lose this tutorial.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Don't do this to me.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hold on.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Oh, my God, yes.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh, my God.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
There's auto lock on this fucking gun type.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh, my God, please.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Oh, my God, I'm scared.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
No, fuck it. If you fly, I'm flying.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Fuck you.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
How many rockets? I've got two more rockets.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Oh, we got one. We got one.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Hold on. You're next.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Okay, we're out.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Are we? Wait.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
We have infinite aim bomb.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
We have infinite things and I wasn't using it

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
the entire time.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
We have infinite aim bomb.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Missiles.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
And I haven't

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
been using them.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Right, I need one.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, my God.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Sorry, that guy was literally trying to do a

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
freaking development job.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
What do I need to destroy?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Head cores.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Man, fuck head cores.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I think there's a hidden item

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
in one of these buildings, maybe?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm starting to be in blame to the UI.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Literally, I suck.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You have infinite ammo for all weapons.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Wait, we're just using this one, then.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Fuck up this building.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Shut up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Jesus. You've actually got some

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
decent HP. I'll give you that, Mr.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Buildings.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
There's something shooting at me.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Bruh.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Am I not...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Who the fuck is...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I love the love of what...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Ah!

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Ah!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Oh.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Just...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Ah!

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Wait, and just like that.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Ah, right.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So we did that one.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Never doing last transmission.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Lieutenant, can you get that back?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I can't, Major. There's nothing to get back.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I see.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Any sign of the rest of Alpha Lance?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
No, sir. Captain, get back

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
to the Icarus.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
For now, it's just you and that scout mech,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
but this operation continues.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Like I said, Dragoons

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
improvise.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Right, so we're getting our...

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, sorry, you can see that we missed it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It's okay, suffering silence.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Military Defender's ability to

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
repel the impending invasion

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
by raising

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
their...

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Home Center.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Again.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And again.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The loudness difference in this game

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
is crazy.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Uh-huh.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Right.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Simple.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Right, so we've unlocked the Puma,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
but I don't know if it has

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
rockets like the other one.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Right, we'll try with the Puma.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And if we...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Puma pants,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
because I do so badly with it.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We'll pick another one, thank you.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Sorry, I took way too long

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
on to hit the brim there.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I took way too long

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
to do that when I came in that joke,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
so I literally just went shite myself

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and then that was the joke. Right, okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
They do seem to have some auto-lock type turret.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I'm so sorry.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm so sorry.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
But I do like this game because you can like walk into stuff

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and destroy it. Like...

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Excuse you!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm just trying to enjoy the spawn area.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That's what I'm saying. These older games are brutal.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Like, there's no such thing as like

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
spawn area safety or nothing.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I really strongly...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Oh.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That one just killed his own guy there.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh, there's a brook floor.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh my god,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
he like fires fast.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Okay, so here's a thing

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
that a lot of people didn't know about.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
You might notice that

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I've got a heat bar on the left.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
If you stand in water, your mech cools down.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And a lot of people didn't know this in the multiplayer.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So my dad used to wreck

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and deck in the multiplayer

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
like far beyond anyone's...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
like, isn't knowing

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
you how he was winning.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And so this was back when Xbox

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
headsets, like, were things

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
who could communicate with the enemy team

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
all points in the game. There were some such things

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
like rounds where you can smack top.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
No, the entire game

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
someone was blasting music down the mic.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Someone was like spamming the N word

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
all of that stuff.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And my dad used to wreck and deck

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
on these bit in multiplayer.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And everyone used to be so raging at him.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
They're like, hey, he's cheating. How is he doing that?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And it was because he was sitting in the water

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
on Alice, which is like

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
there's really damage in mech.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Oh.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's like this really

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
damaging

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
a mech, but

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
his cooldown is like pretty

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
aggressive.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, god, I'm gonna shut up.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
All right, there. I know, those are people.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't really need people right now.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Where the heck did they go? Were they in the air?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I'm in the air. Fuck you.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
All right, there we go.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
So basically,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
my dad used to wreck and deck on multiplayer.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
the reason why I obviously like, oh, my mom

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
was the first E girl.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I'd say that is a joke, by the way.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Because my mom used to go and

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
headset and just like have a talk

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
with anyone. Like just like,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
a lot of folks that like played mech,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
had Xbox Originals at the time.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
You were a working person.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
You had to have internet.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You had to have the actual console,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
which is quite rare in itself. Then you would have to have a game.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So it was a mature

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
fan base

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
that opted for this game.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And my mom used to go and headset

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
pretending like she,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
so my dad used to play the game in fucking silence.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
And my mom

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
used to like be like, oh, I just got

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
here.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
And

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
my dad would be like, every morning

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I'd wake up to like a billion pals

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
requests on Xbox.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And it makes me laugh my ass off every

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
time they tell me the story.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm like, my mom was the first fucking

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
girl being like,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
oh, I just got you.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Like all of that down the make

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and like fucking laugh.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's such a shame.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
My mom and dad made pals with

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
this guy from Canada.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
it's a shame because like obviously

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
they never got like any contact

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
details of Xbox. So they never spoke.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But basically he used to get

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
high every day and he didn't have a job.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And my mom and

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
dad love talking to him because they were like,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
what do you mean you don't have a job?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And there's like, oh, no, I don't need to pay

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
taxes and he would like tell them about Canada.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Grizzly, if you're out there, my mom and dad

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
absolutely adore you still and they still talk

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
to you to this day. They still remember

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
your game or tag Grizzly.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So hopefully you're still getting high

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
as hell and telling funny stories

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
to people in video games.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Doing Canada

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
proud literally.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
So if you ever think like, oh,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I don't have an impact

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
anywhere on anyone.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Literally, there's a

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Scottish man and wife that still

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
to this day talk about their old gamer

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
buddy from 20 years gone by.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
It must be. I don't know how old this game is

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
when they were, wait, can I not?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I doubt you're flying. Coming in boys.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So yeah, don't ever be like, oh,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
my life doesn't have any impact.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Like there's a

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
nostalgic man and woman in

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Scotland that still think about you.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So, oh shit, I'm overheating. I can't

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
fire.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Hold on, let's get this tank

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
first because they're the

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
humans.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah, when you overheat you

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
literally can do no damage, which is

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
a bit unfortunate.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Wait, what did I join into?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
What's the context?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm just saying that even if your life

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
doesn't feel like it's impactful or anything

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
like that,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
my parents

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
used to play

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
meccosal with this

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
random guy from Canada. They don't have this

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
contact information or anything, but his

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
gamer tag was grizzly and I'm just saying

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
even if you feel like your life has

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
no positive impact, there is

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
a sweet Scottish couple to this

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
day that still talk about this guy

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
that got high and played meccosal

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
every single day from Canada and

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
it doesn't, like your life

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
doesn't have to amount to anything

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
at all. That's not how it works.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And it's just very

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I think it's just

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Oh, there's a mecc.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Yep. Oh, I'm

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
seeing a battle mecc. I don't know about reading

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
a mecc. I just saw him.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I see him. He's coming at me like a freaking

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
spoon.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Oh.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Whoa, hold on.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Hold on. Is he crippled?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So mecc animations are actually

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
pretty decent. You can get crippled mecc

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
animations. Oh, fuck. I'm

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
overheating and there's no water nearby.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Oh, there's no water nearby.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'm out. I'm overheating.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Hold on. Let me hide behind this building. Hold on.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Hold on, darling. Let me hide behind this

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
building. Okay. Okay, darling. Thank you.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Right. I've got a, I can shoot again.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Okay. He's crippled. See how

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
he's sparking? That's when you know that mecc

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
is getting weak. Yeah. He's literally on fire.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But you ready for this sound when it dies?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I'll shut up when it dies.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh, come on.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Whoa.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm one health. I'm one health in a dream.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm one health in a dream. I'm one health in a

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
dream. I wasn't paying attention. Oh, my god.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Holy. There.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Oh, my god.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Oh, my god.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I wasn't paying attention because

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I was typically yattin'.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Make Grizzly only the most famous

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
YouTuber. Wait,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
YouTuber, shut up. Imagine if it was him and

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
he's a YouTuber now and I'd be like,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
hi, by the way, I'm the daughter of

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
your old best pal

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
that you used to talk to daily on Xbox.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
What the fuck up? Could you imagine?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Is there actually someone called Grizzly on

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
YouTube that please make games to shut the

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
fuck up? Imagine. And he's the Canadian

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and he gets high all the time.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
So I've got some news from my dad.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Oh, my god.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Stony keeping the jet pack

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
that makes it overheat.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Wait, this meat. Oh, right.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
It does add to your overheat. Okay.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Oh, no.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Whoa.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Wait, are you the real Stony?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Oh, thank you.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Are you kidding me?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm scared to go in.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Oh, it's you again.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh, no, it's not.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, my god.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
They're like sniping me from halfway

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
across from that.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And they have all wing.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah

30:03.680 --> 30:05.000
Oh

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
I think I'm supposed to have to fight in here because look how many healing stations there are

30:10.720 --> 30:16.720
That's probably also one of the important things is to be able to fall back. Oh my god. We're just trying to hospital a

30:17.280 --> 30:19.280
Geneva convention

30:20.880 --> 30:22.880
Oh

30:27.080 --> 30:33.960
Sometimes I wonder if I ever own some famous folks during my year strongy, please. What do you mean by spoon? What calling on my spoon?

30:35.000 --> 30:38.680
It's just an insult like you can insult things

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
I really want to use my special ammo

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Oh

30:55.040 --> 30:58.720
And in scots you can make inanimate objects and insult

31:07.560 --> 31:15.360
Ramblin on about yeah in scots you can make anything an insult an inanimate object an insult. Oh

31:16.360 --> 31:21.340
Oh, we're done. Okay. Maybe there is a chance. We've finished the campaign

31:21.840 --> 31:27.640
Resistance group actively fighting the word of Blake. We've not heard from Alpha Lance so we can use these guys help

Shocking and look what you've done. You push that per man at that tunnel. He didn't deserve that. He didn't

33:38.480 --> 33:40.480
Okay, I'm about to get a fight

33:41.400 --> 33:43.400
Looks like a light scout

33:43.800 --> 33:47.960

34:17.600 --> 34:22.040
He actually is running away. No wait a minute. Hold on you kill civilians

34:22.040 --> 34:27.400

Fuckin hell I'm overheating. Hold on. Let me get in the war

34:42.360 --> 34:46.760
That's I'm cheating. I'm doing I'm doing it literally the strong and stress

34:49.880 --> 34:56.400
Oh, come on, I can't see you when you do that hold on the hood says he's above me others

35:17.400 --> 35:22.040
Juicy I learned it learning the dead stuff looks at least one am shot

35:24.200 --> 35:28.520
Though is that shit, are you targeting me right now?

35:35.800 --> 35:40.520
I've got a cross here on the map that says go this way, but I feel like I'm about to go out of bounds

35:42.000 --> 35:44.600
There doesn't appear to be much in the area

35:46.480 --> 35:51.960
Okay, here we go. We've got some sort of civilization up ahead. Sorry. It's just the render distance

35:51.960 --> 35:53.960
That's all the render distance. Oh

36:05.360 --> 36:07.360
Oh

36:08.960 --> 36:13.040
Okay, that's honestly when she said that sorry we're doing strats

36:17.520 --> 36:22.500
The music in this game is really good if I could put it off, but I don't know the volume

36:24.400 --> 36:26.240
What's the word?

36:26.240 --> 36:32.520
The volume steadiness in this game is like aged terribly because one minute

36:32.520 --> 36:36.480
The cutscene is like blaringly loud and then the next minute is just awful

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
There we go

36:40.320 --> 36:46.400
You do not I'm pretty sure the blast site does major damage so you do not want to be hanging around too close

36:50.680 --> 36:53.320
No people it's a nuclear testing site

37:03.160 --> 37:10.520
All right, okay, we'll head on next there seems to be some sort of tank a wee baby tank up ahead where we are. Oh

37:15.080 --> 37:20.400
Sorry, I'm just trying to put something up there. There's something blue up there. Is this a secret?

37:20.920 --> 37:23.480
All right, hold on. Let me get rid of wherever this red is

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Hello, oh

37:38.560 --> 37:39.960
corporation

37:39.960 --> 37:44.400
Is this a secret? Honestly, it's like a secret. There's something blue up here

37:45.640 --> 37:51.800
Hold on. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Let's just oh, let's just scare him this bad boy. Oh

37:54.400 --> 37:56.400
No, it's is it

37:56.800 --> 38:02.360
I'm sorry, but that looks like a hopscotch thing and there's something up there, but it's not registered

38:13.480 --> 38:17.200
Well, we'll leave that I'm not but actually I will say it was really nice

38:17.200 --> 38:21.960
They actually put a detail in the city like oh, we're a tourist site. Yeah, you should totally come see this tourist place

38:21.960 --> 38:23.960
There's not one person around

38:27.400 --> 38:29.400
I was gonna surprise

38:33.080 --> 38:35.080
They just told the university

38:43.720 --> 38:47.880
They've in oh god, there's an enemy right here, right? Yeah, come in the war come in the war

38:47.880 --> 38:53.880
Oh, you want to be in the war so badly? Oh, you want to stay on the land whilst I stay in the war

38:57.040 --> 38:58.200
Oh

38:58.200 --> 39:03.800
No, no, no, that's cheating only I'm allowed in the water. Oh my god. He has a fucking all century. Fuck you

39:05.160 --> 39:08.880
That's been awful. Oh shit. Oh

Shit, what is this always? Oh

39:15.600 --> 39:17.600
No, it's definitely not always

39:20.720 --> 39:23.400
It's taking him down though, whatever

39:26.680 --> 39:30.640
Okay, let's just do that again. He's getting low. Let's just spam spam some some

39:31.840 --> 39:33.840
There we go

39:39.240 --> 39:45.480
Cuttlefish at home in the war literally he didn't stand a chance of some sort of enemy a tank in the war I

39:48.920 --> 39:50.720
See this Johnny

39:50.840 --> 39:55.640
Stranny lore comes in handy for this game type literally come into the water, you know, you want to

39:59.720 --> 40:01.720
I

40:02.000 --> 40:09.200
Unfortunately have no recollection or recollection of any of this. Oh, it's another mech. I see on the HUD. You see that

40:09.600 --> 40:11.120
bomb

40:11.120 --> 40:12.840
Square

40:12.840 --> 40:14.840
into the water

40:14.840 --> 40:16.840
Unless there's water ahead of me. Oh

40:21.720 --> 40:27.160
Oh, he's coming to the left. Oh, he's trying to give me the jump right hold on if the AI is gonna come to me

40:27.160 --> 40:31.240
I'm gonna jump in the war again. So he's coming. He's coming

40:32.360 --> 40:34.360
There he is

40:38.880 --> 40:40.880
Yes

40:42.720 --> 40:48.000
Now I would do siren singing but as you all know the best I can do is some mech singing

40:51.120 --> 40:54.080
Plunk plunk cling flying. I'm a mech

40:55.600 --> 40:57.600
Plank flying flying

41:01.120 --> 41:03.120
Something

41:03.240 --> 41:06.960
It's not a mech. Thankfully, I'm getting a bit

41:14.880 --> 41:16.880
I know literally

41:16.880 --> 41:23.760
Collateral must be expensive on these jobs. Literally. What's that video? Whoa, you came out nowhere. You're still in the building

41:26.240 --> 41:28.240
Are we done

41:32.080 --> 41:34.080

Feel

41:41.760 --> 41:43.760
Sorry, this one's really stuck in my head right now

41:44.560 --> 41:46.560
It's just the part where it goes on

41:49.040 --> 41:53.040
How many missions does this game have cling flying? I'm a mech

41:55.360 --> 41:57.360
You want to come into the water?

We take out the ground forces and a tank depot second. We storm the airfield make sure no planes fly out of there

42:11.840 --> 42:14.480

42:14.960 --> 42:20.720
Last thing remote recon shows a helicopter mission try me out. Yeah, good luck. Love. What's inside destroy it

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
Think you've got enough to do mech warrior

42:23.920 --> 42:26.800
Think you've got enough to do we've unlocked

42:26.960 --> 42:28.960
Ooziel

42:29.280 --> 42:34.720
The ooziel is a medium mech built to bring impressive firepower

42:34.800 --> 42:38.240
Let's give them a shot if I've unlocked them the new let's see them a wee shot

42:38.480 --> 42:42.000

42:42.960 --> 42:44.960
Oh

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040

This game cannot balance itself for its freaking life. All right, sorry, there's a wee human here somewhere

43:03.600 --> 43:05.600
Oh

43:23.280 --> 43:27.200
Why okay and then in a mix I'll use the double

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Wow

43:31.600 --> 43:36.560
See it's the is these things you really don't want to lose too much damage to the last thing you want

43:38.800 --> 43:40.800
There's so much red on the map

43:44.720 --> 43:48.480
I don't see yeah, okay, that's why I don't want to lose health

43:54.400 --> 43:56.400
I'm trying to play super safe

43:57.280 --> 43:59.280
Because I don't want to

44:00.880 --> 44:05.360
Although we could always try a different make if we if we messed up on a mission. I mean the game really isn't the

44:06.160 --> 44:10.640
I don't think it's too punishing the missions don't actually seem that long until I'd assume that

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
As if I got hit by

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
There's something coming off of me

48:10.560 --> 48:12.560
Isn't this the original mech?

48:12.720 --> 48:18.640

Look how much damage I just took because I was sitting in the water. Are you joking me?

51:29.760 --> 51:31.760
And there's a fucking mech on this way

51:32.640 --> 51:37.200
Oh my god, too deep in the water starts flooding the fucking mech

51:39.200 --> 51:41.200
Oh one enemy ahead of me

51:41.920 --> 51:47.200
Is it gonna come over so I can shoot him? I just took so much damage. I don't have to use

51:49.200 --> 51:51.200
Where's the enemy?

51:55.200 --> 51:57.200
Wait the chopper is the fucking enemy

51:58.880 --> 52:00.880
I was a bit overkill

52:14.640 --> 52:17.920
Oh my god, I need health but I don't have it

52:20.960 --> 52:22.960
No, no that one

52:22.960 --> 52:24.960
I need the auto aim. Oh, I don't like this

52:27.760 --> 52:32.240
Oh, there's gonna be a mix I and I'm gonna get rules because I'm fucking half health because I

52:35.920 --> 52:40.640
I'm trying please don't spawn in any mix. Please. I'm begging

52:41.680 --> 52:43.680
Okay

52:52.960 --> 52:57.120
You meddle in that what you do not understand

52:58.320 --> 53:01.600
I don't have heels wait no no no no no no no no no no no no no

53:01.600 --> 53:04.720
Hold on hold on hold on. Let me win. Let me win. Please. I'm on my knees. Please

53:05.040 --> 53:10.560
I didn't realize I didn't real oh fuck. I completely missed that one off. Oh my god. Please get the limping one first

53:11.520 --> 53:15.200
It's better to take out oh shit that increases my heels my

53:15.680 --> 53:19.040
Overcharge hold on. Hi. Is there gonna have heels over here on the second map?

53:19.440 --> 53:23.920
No, oh, that's okay. I guess I didn't need it. Right. They both put their prima facia. Oh

53:24.920 --> 53:26.920
My god, I'm actually gonna leave them

53:29.200 --> 53:31.200
Cuz I freaking stood in war

53:33.760 --> 53:38.600
No, he's not dead. Oh, he'll fail break the building break them

53:41.840 --> 53:48.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay take out the weaker one first, okay, that's what we like to see

53:49.520 --> 54:00.360
All right, and then take him out. Nope, he's completely messed up. Oh my god, these fucking helicopter pads are fucking saying that they're

54:04.360 --> 54:09.320
Right, okay, okay, I think we're okay. I don't want to I think

54:12.360 --> 54:14.360
Okay, that's what I want to see, baby

54:15.280 --> 54:17.280
Oh

54:21.520 --> 54:24.560
Can you back up I do not want you to explode in my face

54:26.000 --> 54:31.960
No, everything see these helicopter pads. Oh my god, they're registering as like something that's in my way

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh

54:44.760 --> 54:46.760
Oh

54:58.640 --> 55:02.680
Oh my god, she said honestly slayed you were lucky that the

55:04.200 --> 55:08.280
Strategically left mek hearing I am forever and hmm. Yeah

55:09.120 --> 55:11.620
The dialogue in this game is like a

55:11.620 --> 55:13.620
Oh

55:13.660 --> 55:18.540
Captain our objective has always been to disrupt the word of Blake and disable the orbital guns

55:18.540 --> 55:24.780
I cannot believe I almost lost the top about right weren't you just telling me that last night cowboy

55:25.700 --> 55:27.700
Sirs the job is this

55:28.420 --> 55:33.540
Are the commentators, you know make it out to see working each other for the orbital guns

55:33.540 --> 55:36.340
So this is critical. The problem is going to be the terrain

55:36.340 --> 55:39.940
Hold on a minute. I'm just gonna slow you down. So keep an eye out for shortcuts over dry land

55:40.100 --> 55:42.700
What madman would ask Johnny Keese that make

55:45.740 --> 55:50.180
Get to it mek warrior time to get wet. Yo, we don't need to know you're like

55:52.060 --> 55:53.940
Whoa

55:53.940 --> 55:56.100
Lial

55:56.100 --> 56:02.740
Billy L a variant of the Ozil is built to field up here or formidable

56:04.060 --> 56:07.700
Gossas rifle and I never use rifles, you know that I

56:08.580 --> 56:11.380
Don't I don't think I don't think he's the one I

56:12.540 --> 56:14.540
Don't think he's the one

56:14.580 --> 56:22.860
Now is he'll against a mech is like pretty OP. I'm quite I'm quite biased to zeal right now

56:26.380 --> 56:28.900
He is not the one pronounced like

56:38.300 --> 56:40.300
I

56:42.140 --> 56:44.140
Have no idea what mission

56:44.460 --> 56:48.300
So I looked up and they were like this game takes the average to play but I'm like

56:48.300 --> 56:55.700
I think it I don't think it takes eight hours. I'm not under the impression. It actually is the ever matter to show

56:56.780 --> 57:01.100
Don't have to tell me twice. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Oh, you've got a whole breach

57:01.100 --> 57:05.460
Oh, no, you're taking water on board. Oh, no, I don't get your life jacket on

57:05.940 --> 57:09.060
Oh, it's too late. No, there's not enough time for the life jacket

57:14.700 --> 57:22.100
Eight game journalist hours, okay, maybe eight for a hundred percent. I don't I don't think there's any hundred percent

57:22.100 --> 57:24.100
There's no like collected or anything

57:24.460 --> 57:26.460
Oh

57:34.620 --> 57:40.260
That's creative putting a freaking turret on a bridge, I did not expect that you know what video game

57:43.700 --> 57:46.540
Yeah, that's what I thought honestly, but do that again

57:47.740 --> 57:50.580
Don't even make me regret being so nice

57:51.580 --> 57:53.580
I'm missing on purpose

57:55.380 --> 58:02.700
Oh, I've done it. That's I just pretty satisfying when it's one shot. It feels like this is a shotgun in terms of late

58:03.900 --> 58:05.660
Oh

58:05.660 --> 58:08.060
Wow, I'm just destroying the entire river

58:14.660 --> 58:16.660
Sometimes

58:20.580 --> 58:27.460
Whoa, sorry the controls are a bit funny. Please remember this game is back when

58:28.740 --> 58:30.740
Whoa, what was that?

58:33.380 --> 58:40.940
Oh, thank God back in the day when they were like made things invisible they weren't actually invisible so they were like being nice to you

58:41.660 --> 58:43.660
I

58:45.300 --> 58:51.980
Remember playing a similar mech assault game, but on the Xbox you're gonna shit yourself when you find out this next piece of information

58:52.580 --> 58:56.060
This is mech assault from the Xbox original

58:58.460 --> 59:00.460
Very good game

59:01.020 --> 59:05.140
My it's probably one of the first games I was a child

59:07.940 --> 59:09.940
Just when it comes to

59:10.940 --> 59:12.940
Stuff

59:15.420 --> 59:19.220
Can you play that? Yeah, I feel like a

59:21.980 --> 59:23.980
Who's gonna love you

59:28.300 --> 59:30.300
Destroy the drawbridge

59:32.620 --> 59:35.680
Now the townspeople can escape you're welcome

59:37.180 --> 59:39.540
Go home are you parish? Do I meet?

59:41.940 --> 59:43.940
Oh

59:45.780 --> 59:52.780
Did I feel oh, sorry, I was person about sorry lads may just feel this mission cuz I've been having a Katie on

59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.740
Hurry up, I'm sorry. I was freaking role-playing. Okay. I was letting the townspeople escape

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:05.180
You need to play with that beggar. I don't know how those

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.220
Obviously like back in the day. Yeah, those controllers thought

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.300
I

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.980
Don't like that

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:23.020
Big big coming I see big big on the map

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.340
Nope, that was just a tiny human

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.100
You are not giving me a chance

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.740
Sorry, I did not

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:53.100
He's stuck if he's stuck I'm leaving. I'm sorry if the if the game might

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:04.060
You didn't even give me a fucking second you didn't even give me a fucking second even I

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:10.220
Pissed the ball. I pissed about for like 50%. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. My wee Xbox is good

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.460
It's got dust in the fans. Sorry. My Xbox has dust in the fans. If you saw that my apologies

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:21.220
I messed around and that we towned for how long I

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:29.420
Literally destroyed am I going crazy. I destroyed a drawbridge and then that was it I was done

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.580
Bro these games are brutal

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.100
I

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.100
Ain't exactly making much

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:51.940
Just focus on the river every second you stop to do anything the boat. Yeah, literally timed mission. Hey

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.660
Honestly, is it all getting done for it? I don't know why video games

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:03.300
At least I know was coming up ahead so I can kind of deal with it as a

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.740
as

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.500
I

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.860
That's not what that meant in French. I meant as I arrive

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.500
That means something else in French. It means fireworks in French

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.820
So I do apologize the one French person listening in right now my bad. She's sorry

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.780
Right don't stop

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.780
Moving down the river

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.860
Ten shots, please do not pair a friend

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.420
Well, he's limping

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.780
Wow

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.660
He'll point

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.780
We're just gonna have to keep her going

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.540
Keep her going that make one some of this you can come get it

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.700
Let's get some I

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:26.700
Hate timed missions. They always suck. Thank you. I'm glad you guys freaking agree

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.220
I don't know why they insist on them. I hate a cheeky time mission

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:35.180
Like even in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, they have like those missions where you have to like

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.660
Hold on, let me get my game

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.820
I'm getting a bit more. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting a wee bit more than I'd like

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:57.540
Wait, this is the end of the math if I go in the wrong way. No, I couldn't have the boy

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:06.620
I'm trying to chase a ship. I'm trying my best. I really am

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.900
I'm ready to spank something that comes in my peripheral have I gone the wrong way

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.460
Because I'm about to start getting the ships we're getting away

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.460
And then the cutscene is like every like five seconds like oh, thanks. Yeah, I really caught up to that ship. He got me

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.220
Oh

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.740
Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to pick up the tail. I really am

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:54.180
Okay, let's get a fucking move one. I need to tell sorry I do

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.740
Here we go here we go here we go

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.220
Oh

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.700
That's what I missed. Okay. Okay. Oh

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.300
That makes much more sense. I was like, where the heck are they going?

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.580
Disappearing on me like that. I love the air

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.180
I remember when you need to kill three war generals in

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.140
Five minutes in a feature

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.020
Infidel brethren watch and learn

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500
You

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.060
Here's our situation

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:12.900
We're landing in what we hope is a secure location, but it looks like the enemy may have spotted us

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.260
There's several enemy units in the area and

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.540
Towards our position as soon as we learn you'll need to secure the landing zone

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.380
More interesting. It looks like the word is transporting a new mad cat

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.780
We need more firepower. So I want that heavy mech

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:35.700
It's against my better judgment, but once you capture the mad cat lieutenant Foster will pilot it back to the Icarus

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.980
Try and make sure that breathing boy doesn't kill himself

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.980
Right, I'm I'm sorry, but Ooziel is kind of getting me good. I have to admit that double

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.140
and

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.140
That double

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.100
Will be on the ground momentarily

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.420
That double

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.660
Destroying mech so quickly. I'm very biased

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.060
Double PPC. Hmm. Defend it

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.900
They know what help they ain't gonna know what help give me

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.020
Hey

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:29.260
Is this their soul is he gonna come through the trees?

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.860
No, he's actually using hold on a minute. He's using

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.060
Whoa, you take four heads. Well, maybe I should have gone quicker because he

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.340
Wait, why this doesn't do any heat damage

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.380
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm the only

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.380
I'm the only one that's supposed to do this. I make myself clear

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:09.020
Wait, okay, hold on hold on and then one more. No

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.620
Shit, I'm over here

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.660
No

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.940
Okay

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.260
I don't know how much health this thing has

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:36.620
Oh

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:41.980
They really require for god this game got me stressed. This is a I thought gaming was supposed to be freaking

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.380
What role am I playing the victim?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:51.180
There's one over to the right. I can see on the HUD and he's fucking getting take damage and fuck you you little shit

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.740
Oh my god, it's like literally on fire

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.540
Oh my god, stop

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.540
Stop, I think I'm actually gonna lose the section

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.020
No more I can't take anymore. Oh, thank god

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:11.340
Okay, oh my god

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:18.700
Reflings are either baddies. No, we're rebel. Wait, are we the baddies in this game? I was like, we're really goodies

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.980
Right, I'm staying out the water until I know it's not too

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.220
That makes go so much colder than the rocket's permanently negative. So that ppc

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.820
Well, that's why I like camping in the water

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.540
But as I learned from that other round, right, there's an enemy there, but I don't even think you can

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.700
He does an awful lot of what's in you in the works

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.060
Is this I have gone the wrong way, please forgive my ignorant

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:56.860
We are the neutral third party that the locals picked to fight with

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:04.860
If if if the lower class picks us then surely we're the goodies

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.700
Sure

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
That's how it works, right

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.500
I love the tanks taking like a bit of side damage there. That was kind of funny like it almost flipped on its side a little bit

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.420
The aim control goes different when you're like inside that week two days

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.340
Hey, you ain't getting me

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Something here that is getting me though

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.460

I can handle the convoy

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.940
Okay

The mechs are coming from this way the mechs are coming from this way serpentine serpentine

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.140
I don't know why I thought they would come the other way. This seems they were coming from behind

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.100
Wow

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.100

I hope he's okay

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.500
I'm clear of the city. I'm hearing me Icarus. Good work, lieutenant foster

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.660
Captain for good measure destroy the base at the north end of the city and don't leave any of those buildings standing

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.340
Uh, total annihilation. Yes, ma'am

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.260
You don't have to tell me why I said no power for you

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.780
No power. No one's allowed electricity

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:32.780
I'm saving you allergy because how can they charge electricity if it'll provide you the service seat? You're welcome

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.140
I don't want to waste the purple

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.100
Fuck you

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.140
Oh, this is satisfying. Oh, I wouldn't take it that one over there

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:56.140
Hold on hold on give me a second. Let him get up

Wow, okay, I have to admit sniping from afar. I'm I'm here for it. Oh, wow

I just need that broken to go up

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.380
Stop spawning in your unit

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.140
Stop it. Please do not go on that helicopter

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.700
Okay

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.900
Okay, we've done the helicopter one now we're going to do the car one

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.220
Okay, and then there's something over there. I can see me

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.220
Okay

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.340
I have to admit leveling an entire area very satisfying

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:49.820
Oh, no, they're gonna be mixed behind something because look there's a health pack there and there

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:55.980
Wait, something's shooting at me. A car? How dare you?

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.220
Wait, I can't auto look. I was gonna say I'm pretty sure I can auto look

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:04.780
I'm trying

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:11.180
I just take a little whale. Okay. I can I think the boss battle. I'm gonna be honest. I said I'm sorry

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.660
It's starting to get a feeling there's gonna be a boss battle. Well, that level up meat. I go back

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.820
Uh, can I destroy this by walking into it?

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.340
I'm getting nervous

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.340
Good work

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.500
But I call dibs oh man, I love this

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.900
Now this is the dom content from a complete flattening babies for him time for you days

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:49.900
Whoa, I've got signatures heading towards us. Well, we didn't even you have a cutscene or nothing

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.620
right

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.620
Mind yourself lieutenant piloting a mech is not a game

01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:03.740
Wait, am I supposed to be lieutenant right now? Whoa, my cat has four auto logs. I'm here for it

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:13.900
Um overheating though, this is a heavy mecha. Oh look, there's me wait

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.020
The dialogue is like so cute

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.980
Oh

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.340
Bro, you're kind of cramping my sail with your aim

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:43.260
Wow, it takes a while to load that for a math admit that's like it's not instant. It's like a

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.780
Reload

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:53.020
Oh my god, but this is so I'm doing like so much damage that things aren't like alive long enough to even hurt me

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:59.580
I'm looking at what the AI is trying to do something's sponding because look I'm going for it. He's even

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.580
Where is it? Where's it? Oh this guy can't fly

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.380
Is that take reduced damage

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.740
I think that may be reduced damage

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.580
Lieutenant has been given your make now you're having the magical

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:18.860
Ah

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:23.020
Heavy makes can't fly too big. Okay. I like that detail. I assume my little

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.540
Is there something out here about me?

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.900
I think something's stuck. Oh, here we go

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.980
Can't see the fight for the trees

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.540
Oh

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:50.220
That's got hurt. Yeah, we what six maybe six

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.860
Oh, I missed because of the tree have you

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.540
Oh, no, I'm still eight

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.580
I mean, that was too less

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:06.460
So still definitely heavy cat. I'm a fan of a heavy make

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.380
It won't be more another one. There's choppers inbound

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
more like choppers out of

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.460
Order instead of inbound

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.580
Go that one

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.260
I can see that there's a mech approaching

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:34.300
Oh, did I get you? I did not get you. What did get you? Hold on. Let me deal with the mech or something

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.460
All right, you next and then you

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.580
All right, let's take the aggro off of the fucking

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:57.500
I that missed again. Okay. Wow purple is like putting them on glass

01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.900
Wow

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:03.420
For hit for oh my god, that was so good

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.940
Oh, yeah, good job briefing boy. Okay. I'm a bit of a simp for the mad cat right now. That was a this is a good make

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.820
Okay, we've got the word of Blake's attention. So now we hurt them

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.460
One of their key tactical command centers is a nick of everything. We're ever gonna have a chance to get those global guns

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:31.180
We've got to take it out. We can't hit them head-on. So we're gonna turn out the lights

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.140
I like is so large. It has to try to attack

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.820
We're gonna blow that plant and I take ten beech ever make a soul and I don't think anything came up of the original

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.260
And I'm like, oh, am I making reach of her history the only mech?

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.260
We've got powerful enough to handle this is the magic

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.700
Don't make me making each of your history the first person to make a soul. Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. Oh

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:57.260
Um, you're a unique gamer. Yeah

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:06.220
Okay, first official mission is the mad cat bright lights dark sea

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.100
It's a lot for battle tech rare for beachable is that touch battle tech game?

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.020
Um, doesn't Titanfall 2 count as a battle tech?

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.020
Right, hold on

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.020
I'll write that down somewhere

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.780
Thanks

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:31.900
Yeah, literally bro, as I said these games do not follow the etiquette when it's in the tree to fall in

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.900
You're supposed to like be given like five seconds. Whoa

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:44.060
You're supposed to be given some abbreviation to the enemies like shooting at yeah, this game does not give life to the rats

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:51.180
Oh, wow, it splits up the aim as well. So, okay, that's really good if it splits up the aim

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.340
It's technically like less to do

01:23:54.540 --> 01:24:00.780
Right mad cats can't fly must remember mad cats cannot fly because I'm gonna get confused when I'm in the middle of my fight

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.860
And I'm like get up get up get up

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:04.860
And nothing's happening

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.980
Okay, there we go

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.140
There seems to be two enemies over here

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.900
One

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.700
Yeah, I can kind of see why they had to put AI. Oh, I just picked up sorry

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
Sorry, you were just on transport

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.020
Bridges whoa

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.860
Uh the bridge

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:40.300
What's going on am I going mental I'm getting absolutely kablami

01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.260
Is there stuff constantly respawned

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:50.060
There's one of them respawned buildings back there. I don't I can't identify the title

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.460
Sir twin pumas outbound from the base

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:02.380
Uh get me in the water in the water. I love being in the water

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.500
Water to be in the water right now

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.940
Oh, I'm not really cooling down that much

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.460
Mmm

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:18.780
Get away from me. He's gonna explode. Oh shit. I'm at events of the game. I'm not supposed to go any further back

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.900
Bruh pull up

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.220
Is it gonna drop right behind me now

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.300
Sorry bro

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:35.580
Okay, we're okay. We're okay as long as we don't

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.140
First

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:43.660
Oh, we're fucking him. Oh one more. Yeah, he's limping

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.900
I always wanted a city of bio

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.780
Right, we need to blow up the bridge

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.780
Is it faster?

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:09.180
To my fans already made that joke go away already made that joke. I think the water strat is best for the rocket

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.260
Oh

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.260
And not this one

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.700
Bridges dusted well done. That'll keep the base from sending out help. Can I hit from here?

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.020
Oh, I can't

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.100
You

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.140
You and we're done

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.940
Whoa god my poor xbox. It's so old. That's really struggling

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.780
I'm glad that it can capture the game

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.100
Yes, I'm glad my xbox original survived

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.940
Do you guys remember when xbox crystal was a thing?

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.020
Hmm just remember that are you too much of a baby?

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:24.380
It's doing so well after being in storage for over 20 years

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.820
Oh my god, that's

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.100

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:04.620
I'm getting my boss wall up tear hold on not the good kind

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.540
The sore kind the kind that no one wants

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.660
Okay, we've got it

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.940
No

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:34.540
The bridge the bridge is in the way of my target

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.980
Oh, we've got it. We've got it and one more which is dead ahead

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:45.420

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:52.540
Yeah, great great good advice. Thank you

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.220
Guys, this isn't emulator. That's why it's fucking up

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.740
Wait, I'm gonna go here. Okay time for the newt plant itself

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:09.660
Foster set up the tactical data. Yes, sir. The OGA flow control is like a hundred bucks raw. Oh

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:19.020
Ah wait no part two what it's loading a new area. It's still the same map. Okay, sir

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:23.100
The newt plant is inside a contained area to get through the gate

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.100
You need to destroy the power generator

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:35.420
Take out defenders around generator. Okay defender

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.700
Take out defenders there's something in front of you

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.060
I freaking saw yous on the HUD. He's such me liars honestly

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.100
I saw you appear on the HUD before me

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.100
Oh, no, I'm overheating

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.220
Wow two for one, baby

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:03.900
Right destroy defenders first. So it's okay that I'm

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.900
I'm alive

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:21.500
These trees are taking an absolute ham. Whoa, whoa, please don't break the game

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.300
Please don't break. Please don't break

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.500
Please don't break. I really don't want to lose progress

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.380
I would actually be really sad if we had to restart

01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:38.140
Whoa, there's a mech on the field

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.700
Oh

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:47.100
I'm too high temperature. I did say take out defenders as long as it's not tamed mission. We can push us about as much as we could

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:52.700
I get him. I want that mech. I want that mech out of the sky

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.780
I want him out of the sky

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.780
Uh, he looks like he's taking damage

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.660
Stop it, bro. You're killing me. You're supposed to let me win

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.500
Video game devs. What are you doing? You're supposed to let the cards win

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:19.740
Oh

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:25.900
Okay, there we go. I'll take that. That'll do me just standing right new chopper

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:30.060
Uh, right, let's see in the cars

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.780
Bang

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.420
Okay, this is the base up ahead

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:39.820
Sorry

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.940
This is creating bases. Yeah

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:50.780
Wait, stop the base the base that's making them destroy the base that's making them not the thing over and over and over again

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.980
Hold on. There's something coming up. So

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.220
Did I break it? I did

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.220
Whoa

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.860

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:09.900
Hold on

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:12.620
Okay, here we go. Here we go

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.940
Well, there's one behind me. Hold on. I need like to try

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:23.420
Oh, come on. Break already. Break

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.420
Okay, that's all I want to see

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:33.500

Oh, we're almost done. We're almost done. We're almost done. We're almost done. safe safe safe safe safe safe safe

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:51.180
Okay

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
We will cool down

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:04.220
We will cool down. We will look for some health. There should be something

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:10.980
you're supposed to let the player win for himself begs to differ brah I would

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:17.260
not be anywhere I am without you guys carrying me that lion I cannot I spoke

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:23.740
just send a little bit after and I watch her play it and I'm like brah you guys

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:29.300
have like such good patience it's insane like I did not have the patience to be

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:36.340
like I don't know like I mean I know it's like oh get good scrolls like I

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:40.460
don't you guys have fantastic patience like it's such a good trait to be able to

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:44.660
do that like you're honestly I don't ironically like that patience that you

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:48.420
can show by like playing it and like trying to beat it and that perseverance

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:51.620
is like fantastic

01:33:51.620 --> 01:34:06.540
that's why I didn't want to overheat then you would have freaking company right

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.700
oh there's a healing stick oh there's also stuff inside that warehouse I can

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:21.500
see it I have to actually use the road like a normal net for from

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:25.060
soft really does not care if you beat it or not I thought yeah that is not our

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:35.900
problem it says it's pointing this way like to go back it's a lot easier to be

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:39.020
patient for something you know in advance will take a long time and not be

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:42.260
stuck on something that you think should be easy I guess yeah like if you know

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.940
what you're getting into she just spent like six hours beating vanilla whoa a

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.900

You

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:41.200
You

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.200
You

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.200
You

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.200
You

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.200
You

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.200
You

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.200
You

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.760
I may or may not have put cat food in my tea

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:04.160
Oh

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:16.280
Here's the score the Icarus sitting duck we need to set up another base so we can finish the job and take out those orbital

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.240
Towers the enemy and I just made my tea there, and I'm like I can read from our own sense

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.560
So I'm about to figure out

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:43.840
Thor on the rocks are we already on Ragnarok are we getting close?

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:48.800
Sorry, did someone say oh, thank you. Don't stay down for the

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:51.760
Super chat

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.320
Bro, I just the Oreo just all in my bed extra protein. I mean

02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.080
Uh, cat food isn't fit for human consumption, which I don't like

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:02.800
I'd rather

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.680
Oh

02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:09.520
How many missions Thor on the rocks are being in close? I'm getting nervous

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:16.160
Timberwolf, who are you a variant of the successful mat the timber wolf has suited for any

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.200
battlefield role

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:21.600
I don't

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:27.040
I don't use the pew-pews, but I use the shoulder thing below. Is this eight shoulder things?

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.760
They're faster though

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:35.040
Timberwolf right fuck it. We'll give Timberwolf a go. Yeah Timberwolf. Let's go

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.440
Make sure wonder what they put in the cat food. Yeah

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.440
I'll fucking out just fondant

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:51.200
Forgot how it play like in five seconds. Um, oh it comes to snow

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.840
Uh

02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:00.720
Yeah, do you if you want to hear how dumb I was as a child are they gonna come from the top? Oh, yeah, they are

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:03.840
Oh, no, they only have super um

02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.280
They are

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:08.800
um

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:12.080
So this is probably the most disgusting story you're gonna hear all day

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:19.440
Um, I used to eat cat food when I was like four years old because I was convinced it would turn me into a cat

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:22.000
um

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:28.800
So I could have a very vivid memory of uh under the kitchen sinkers where the cat food who was uh like in her house

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:36.160
And I used to take a spoon fill out of the tin and eat it because I thought it was gonna turn me into a cat

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.960
And yeah, it's not my brightest moment

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.160
Uh

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:50.320
I don't know why in my head it was gonna turn me into a cat. It just was like, yeah, that makes perfect sense if I eat this cat food

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.160
So I I know what cat food tastes like

02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:01.680
Uh, I could tell by the smell if a cat's gonna enjoy it or not because of this dumb thing I did as a freaking child

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.920
Um, but it's like I can laugh at it now, but oh my god

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.600
Yeah

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:16.320
My my shock and horror that I just wake up with cat ears

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:19.120
I

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:24.640
And it and that behavior went on for quite a while. I'm not even gonna lie. I think it was probably a solid month

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:28.000
I would just wonder the cupboard a bit. Oh, I need a little snack

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.600
And if my mom didn't give me a snack, I just wonder

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:37.680
And the thing is all cat food labels like have a thing on it

02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:41.520
That's like not fit for human consumption because of like the guts that they usually like

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.800
Oh

02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:47.280
And the worst thing is it's not like it was refrigerated like it was open

02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:50.400
Oh, hold on. Sorry

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:56.560
Sorry video game. I'm telling this really disgusting story. The worst part was it wasn't refrigerated. It's like open canned

02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.160
a

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:00.160
Like cat food

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.800
How old were you at the time four? I was like four not 13. Stay on

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.520
What if I told you you're not the first person to tell a story like this? Oh, thank god

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.960
I

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.520
Feel a bit better now then if that's the case

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:17.360
Was it wet? Yeah, it was like the wet jelly in the can

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:22.400
I still remember the noise the spoon made as I took it out of the can like that

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:28.880
Um, it's absolutely mean. I know I'm so sorry. I don't have any excuse

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
But that's hilarious that someone else told me

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.160
I don't know. It just makes perfect sense. Like of course cat food people as if that just kamikaze into that

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.200
I can't see this chopper. He's out of range. But he is there are there is

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.480
You're next buddy

02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.600
Find and destroy the wobb sense or net

02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:54.560
Wait, so I need to go back again

02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:59.040
I get eaten kivel, but jeez. Yeah, like that's why

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.960
So I'm a bit passionate. I'm like, no, I don't want uh

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.800
I'd rather cat food said it's fit for human consumption. Not because I want to eat it

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.000
And turn into a cat. But because

02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:19.360
I don't think that you should be giving your pet something that you the human aren't fit to consume

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.080
um

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:29.680
Lack of nutrients for humans, but it's generally safe in an emergency the furry arc. No, I'll pass

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.240
AC's like

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:34.240
in development

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.440
AC was like as far as we'll go

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:40.160
Right

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.400
Um, because we did entertain the possibility

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.440
But we decided it would be far too much of a

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.800
I can see so much red, but it's not like giving me one thing to shoot at

02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:02.320
Um, but we decided it was far too much of a like negative thing. Holy crap. Something is like obliterating me

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.600
You you're obliterating

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:17.840
Right, I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. I guess we have to come back that way. Gee, there's like so many countries though

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.880
I think there's one in the rocks, maybe

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.640
Anyway long story short, I'm a special child. Is there one hiding? I'm so confused. It says there's something there

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.280
There's an enemy back out there

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.800
You can spam with a wildcat though. What is get you? Yep. I knew you were right there. I can see you on the hot

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.400
Well, what are you?

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:00.640
Okay, so this is the mad cat egg

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.760
Whoa, something's getting me from behind as well. Holy shit. You pop off

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:23.760
I hate when the game does that when these bombs aren't behind you because look how long it takes to freaking do a 180

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.320
I'm half out as well. I don't like that at all

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.440
Oh my god, please perish. What's going on?

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Wow, don't do that again

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.840
Holy moly, you almost got me. Something up here? Com tower?

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:56.800
What's this then?

02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.440
Whoa

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.120
Oh, it's cool. She's our special boomer on the floor

02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.920
When it was a child, I played with stuffed animals until they just have an even two in the school and they need honey

02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.760
And donate them all to cousin. That's what I'm holding. Oh, that's fucking sad as fuck though

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:22.720
I remember my time. I got she got stolen at school

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:28.080
I was raging because I knew exactly who did it and then the next year the freaking

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.720
B-Och came back to school with it a year later

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.000
And she's like, oh, I ran out of battery and I'm like, yeah, could you stole it off me and it's been a year you fucking

02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.640
bought

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:42.720
Um

02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:50.480
How is the cat tea by the way? Okay before I forget but before the game starts like flashing us

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.200
Hold on. I'm just gonna run in circles so the game doesn't like flash

02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:58.240
I don't know why stuffing makes it like panic

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:05.840
Did I beat her up? I was like six years old. I did not beat her up. Um

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.880
I basically I

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:15.440
Knew she stole it. I told the teacher but the teacher like obviously didn't have the right to pat down a child or check through their bag

02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:17.120
um

02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:22.560
And basically the teacher was like, yes, Ronnie. Sorry, but you shouldn't have like you shouldn't bring

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:29.520
Stuff into school that you can lose type idea. Hold on. I'm drinking my tea. I can't I don't I don't sense any cat

02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:31.920
Uh cat like um dusting

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.720
In it

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:41.520
If I read slime girl one more day, I see slime girl more than purple burglar alarm at this point

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:49.200
Name air name air asking for slime girl. That's everyone's getting bent over anyone that types slime girl's getting bent over

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.200
And I'm absolutely taking a bollican

02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.600
Because I've had enough

02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:00.800
I'm putting my foot down the scottish vtuber gets asked for a fucking slime girl more than bloody purple burglar alarm

02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.000
Which everyone's obsessed by asking scottish people about

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.120
Don't tempt them honestly

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.400
A slime boy remember that time I was entertaining a male branch and then it like completely dissolved overnight

02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:16.800
I have no interest now

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:20.960
Oh

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.960
Yeah, but what about you know, slime

02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:28.960
Can you see squirrel eye? It's the french that can you see squirrel they go squee well

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:31.760
Who a little squee well

02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:34.480
Just kidding a squee well

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.960
Someone needs to make a compilation of every time someone asks about slime girl, bro

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.480
They'd be at it for months

02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:45.040
You'd get more content out of people asking me for a slime girl than I do burps in general

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:51.280
Yeah, french people go squee well wait, how did you say it's girl?

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.080
Why a squirrel oh like there goes a squirrel

02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:02.400
Sounds like a short side deal actually I need to make a short. What was it?

02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.040
Oh fine. I guess you add my wee pog champ. Yeah, it was like something like that

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.360
I need to make that I also need to make a song cover. So honestly if this game if we

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:17.680
Do the opposite of game journalists this game that actually might come in fantastic and I can get even more work done

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.760
I I my goal is to get a 2k. Thank you audio out

02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:26.000
Am

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.520
Though I'm going to do the ear cleaning one because it has a funny little joke at the start. I think that one's the best

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:36.080
I'm sorry. I keeping this dream buried for now slowly stewing in fermentin

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:40.000
Look if one of the girls say they want a halloween slime variation

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:47.200
Fine, okay. It's a whole new model. It's a whole new artwork. It's a whole new design fine. They can have it

02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:50.720
But no one is asked for one

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:56.800
Game journalists or game regroup just a short shawnee shaming us for ideas. No, I don't I'm not shaming

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.880
but like there's some stuff that's like

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:02.800
If you don't know you don't know and like one of the unwritten rules are

02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:08.560
You know like don't have a cyclops. It's offputting people don't like it as a design debuff

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.920
and

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:16.400
You know someone being green again design debuff unless you made them only a tinge of green and said they were a halfling

02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:22.560
But she's like a muscle mummy in comparison to the average human sure fine. Let it happen multiple eyes

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:27.840
Insect these are kind of unwritten things that are against the the norms and I'm happy to talk about it

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.160
But I get nervous when I talk about it people take it like oh, she said insect girls

02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:39.520
Bad that means she hates and it's like no motherfucker. That's not how design works. You have to appeal to the masses

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:44.720
The masses and you need to give a model to someone that isn't a debuff

02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.920
That isn't something that makes it even harder for them to succeed as a feature creator

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.640
hey

02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.240
Oh, the shadows are back in full force. I'm slamming the desk. That's when you know, I was hardly slamming it

02:17:58.240 --> 02:17:59.920
I gave it a little bump

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:02.880
Yeah, yeah slam sly cops. You're done

02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:05.680
Someone's gonna be like a slam

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.720
praying man to cyclops that's green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:20.000
Give it a little bug pincers as well. Yeah, mommy doesn't hate a single thing. Have you checked her work? She seems to try everything

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:27.120
We're looking to hit every demographic not a niche. Yeah, I mean do we need a halfling when we have a cuttlefish that needs a steps

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:36.560
I'm not that small. I'm sorry, but five two is not that small. I'm literally bang on average height for the women in the world. Am I not?

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:41.760
Am I not as to if five point two not bang average on height

02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:44.960
Just a slain blob. That's it

02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:50.160
Every day you push me to form an insect slain cyclops feature agency

02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:55.120
You just call it like I don't know what you should call it

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:57.360
just be like

02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.200
V success and then the the point is to prove that you can have a

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:09.120
Successful beat of her as like this design. I think the average five four. Oh fuck me man V slimy. Okay, dude

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.520
Freaks Incorporated

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:14.240
V repel and they do the opposite repel

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:20.240
I've almost finished my thing V cute short

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:29.280
I'm starting to imagine that brain meme when you go to sleep saying that you have made a slime girl then

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:35.520
Oh, imagine if that was the biggest turnaround of the century that there's already a slime girl design approved

02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:39.680
Hey, and I'm just pretending there isn't and I'm like, oh, I hate slime girls

02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:46.160
See it

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.280
Can you tell me twice

02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:55.440
Wouldn't that not be the the ultimate debate

02:19:56.400 --> 02:20:00.400
I mean if I pulled that off I'm gonna make if I pulled that off I deserve like all the whole

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:14.560
Right, there's a lot of supplies in these barracks, which makes me think

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:28.160
I

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:39.120
Little bit hold on I need to lure the thing that would be such a dirty move five two is the global average in China

02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:42.800
Oh my god, I can't believe you guys find out. I'm secretly Asian right now

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:47.600
Uh, I wasn't kidding when I said I had a Chinese and a

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.560
I

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:12.560
I really like her voice. I wish she voiced more video games. Maybe she has and I just don't know about it. Her voice is very

02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:19.840
Well, I could not even see that in bed

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:28.720
No, just a few resupplies, okay, okay

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:34.320
I love it when she calls you sport

02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:38.800
Oh, you're such a good sport little reflin even though I know you said that for the commentator

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.800
But I don't I've never like I've ever called the reflin

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:42.480
sport

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:46.720
Oh, you're such a good sport watch me play these games that absolutely no one cares about

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.040
Literally apparently I've made vtuber news by playing mech assault

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:55.920
I'll need a check if there really hasn't been a vtuber that's played mech assault. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa bring it back

02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:57.920
Bring it back. Bring it back. Bring it back now. Yeah

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:03.200
Everybody

02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.080
Oh, there's an

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.520
Okay, I forget that I can hold down a on this guy

02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:15.840
Oh, I don't have an ultimate on this character

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.800
Wow, I don't there's no ultimate

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.840
There's no like defense or anything

02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:24.960
Uh, I think I'd rather just found this

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.400
Oh, I'm taking a bit of damage

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:32.000
Oh my god, please stop. Oh my god, please stop

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.880
Stop. Oh my god, did you see those drinks?

02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:42.400
Call me the call me a hazard because of the way I did those drinks. Oh

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:44.960
Oh

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:48.480
Okay, hold on. I've got purple on this but it's pretty leveled up to me

02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:52.160
And it doesn't turn towards my

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:58.880
Are you just taking that? Yeah, are you going to take that? Oh, fuck. He's actually getting me crazy right now

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:03.120
Okay, and he puts that. Okay. Yeah. Good fuck me

02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:06.800
Give me that hill

Get it. Get it. Jokes of hazard that that one movie that one tv show. No, it's a movie

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:19.840
I can't and then he wanted to like impregnate uh someone underage or something. I can't recall the details. I apologize

02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:27.840
Yeah, you never heard of this. It was probably because my old school game knowledge is limited to nintendo

02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:29.840
Watch it collapsing tunnel

02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:42.560
Whoa, I didn't even know the game did things like that

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.480
That's cheeky. That's cheeky. No, you know how to do that only I'm allowed to do that

02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:57.760
Damn that was loud was it? I'm so sorry the the game volume balance control. I actually might pin a comment

02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.400
uh

02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:04.880
There's something bad ahead of me. Oh, it's there

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:13.600
Where is it? What?

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:14.960
Hello

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:19.280
Whoa, the game did not like that angle I entered and it we've been around

02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:22.480
She hasn't seen that before

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:26.480
Literally, that's the fact. Whoa, there's two mechs on the battlefield

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.400
Uh, I do not have infinite health. I'm gonna be honest. I do not have infinite health

And so for distancing, please please back up

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.080
If I back up is it fast enough?

Oh my god, please just freaking die. Thank you

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:54.960
Oh, I'm low health and I don't like it because I don't know where to get more health and I don't want to replay this whole section

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:02.320
Don't give up. You got this. Thank you. I think there must have been health in the distance because that was rough

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.320
Okay, I see health. I see health

02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:09.840
Well, I see green give me that health give me that ammo

02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.960
Give me whatever's in this building. What else do you owe for me?

Okay, okay, we can do this we can do

Oh, can I don't need to snipe it from here? No, that can't be right

02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:40.160
Uh

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:43.920
Is this got a HP bar or am I

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:49.920
I don't really want to

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:56.080
No, wait, hold on. Oh wait, it's breaking

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:00.080
Okay, okay

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.080
Is there any enemies got a lot of enemies?

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Whoa, that's such a unique noise

02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:08.800
Only one more find it and we may be safe

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:11.600
Okay, one more. Is there any

02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.200
special

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:18.480
Healing around the corner. No, okay. I guess we're not at that stage in video game development when we put like little secrets

02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:21.680
No HP bar

02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:26.880
That plank master

02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:29.360
Okay

02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.360
Only like there's anything

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:34.400
I'm getting nervous. I really don't want to

02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:36.720
Well

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:39.040
I love how you look at

02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:44.080
You're mostly male that ain't going nah guys hate giant robots. No, I'm not like that. Just like

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:50.160
I don't know. I feel like some v-tubers normally try and pick the most popular flavor of game

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.320
Or am I being daft when I say that unknown case?

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:01.040
An annoying helicopter squadron is this

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:04.240
Oh

02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:06.640
Because

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200
I can hear him, but I don't see

02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.520
Oh

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:32.880
Oh, is that why I lost my health in that earlier match because of the

02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:36.960
Oh

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:39.840
Curious

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.760
I hear a chopper. I don't see. Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it. Yeah, sorry

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.880
Haha, wouldn't it be so funny if you had help or like anything?

02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:59.120
Having a good jolly time jolly good show

02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:04.400
I don't care about popular games robots shooting each other. It's like popular to me

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:09.520
It's interesting if you actually like the game. Oh, you're gonna be melting for viva pinata then

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:15.920
Filled with fun filled with fun viva pinata

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:24.000
Wait, I'm not being dumb in the end then you go back then you go around then you do a u-turn

02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:26.240
I think I do

02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:28.240
You turn time

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.480
No, don't look on to me. Don't don't tell them. I'm here

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Don't be silly

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.720
Don't tell them. I'm here. I saw that

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:42.320
I saw that

02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:45.600
You got big mix. I'm just a wee make

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.800
That has very little help

02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.800
We really appreciate it

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:55.600
Oh, I'm like really trying not to take any damage from anything at the moment

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:04.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not ready. Yeah. I'm not ready. Yeah. Hold on. I'm not ready for a mix

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:14.080

He's already low. Hold on. Hold on. Let me cool down mate. Mate. Hold pause. Pause. Let me time a shoe laces. Pause the fight

02:31:56.800 --> 02:31:58.880

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:03.120
Come on. Come on

02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:10.640
Yeah, we did it. Or I'd make a goblin hack and build a creature

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:22.720
Oh, no, please.

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:27.680
New mate

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:29.920
Oh

02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:34.800
Hello, please don't be an atlas. I'm gonna ship myself

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:38.080
Ragnarok. No

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:45.360
Oh, I don't I've forgotten his name, but he's not nice. He's really you can't be sure and I'm not even in the freaking game

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:54.160
Stop stop stop pause stop. That's cheating. That's fucking cheating. Sorry. That's actually cheating

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.440
You were shooting me in the cutscene

02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:01.280
Fuck off. Hold on. I'm overheating. Give me a second

02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:06.800
Oh, hold on. I can't aim. Fuck it. Sorry. I can't aim. We're getting through the lake part. Can you back up?

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:11.200
Stop. Stop. I'm actually gonna lose right at the fucking end. Are you serious? Oh

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:15.360
Oh

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:24.480
I

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Oh

02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:37.200
It's a score. Okay. Oh, you'll never guess why this mission was called Thor. You'll never get

02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:43.680
Hydration check. Oh my god. I almost lost that. I'm not being funny

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.480
I'll handle this briefing

02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:49.840
Captain will have to restrict yourself from engaging the enemy

02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:54.240
I know this goes against everything you big tough mech warriors are taught

02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:57.120
Oh, it's an atlas. Oh my god, it's an atlas

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:04.000
From inside we should be able to add to their comm center and see what information we can acquire about the orbital guns

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.160
Then comes the part I haven't figured out how you get back

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:16.480
Suddenly I'm glad I'm not a mech warrior. Oh, no, it's an atlas atlas is our tanky is anything

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:23.840
My dad actually found a soft lock on this mission. He was so proud of himself when he showed me it

02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:27.040
Um, oh

02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:29.680
I'm actually getting nervous

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:38.160
I'm getting nervous the Thor successfully blends heavy firepower with maneuverability and a heavy mix chassis

02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:43.920
Atlas casually doing what it does in lore making people shit their fans

02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:48.080
my my dad's favorite mech was atlas and

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:52.240
Captain you're just outside of the base perimeter

02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.400
So

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Okay, don't shoot

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:06.160
Anyone and don't run over any tank either or a gentleman. Oh my god, they're tea posing. Look. I'm going. Look. I'm we tea posing

02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:13.680
Oh, he's animated but the other guy isn't yeah, so do not stand on anyone or you get obliterated to the moon

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:16.320
So I'm literally not moving until this convoy goes away

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:20.800
Okay

02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.680
Okay, I'm satisfied my aoe is not going to upset any of this

02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:35.840
Steady easy easy. No, I am a friendly

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.120
Uh, yeah easy

02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:51.120
Easy, okay snowplow coming in easy easy. We don't want to upset the balance of anything

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:57.280
I hope when strong he struggles you can just go. I'll literally get my dad on the phone right now

02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:03.440
Hold on Ray was safe to move

02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:07.920
We're going to take the the right side because there's nothing other right side

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:11.760
Take it easy. Yes. We're friendly. Oh god

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:15.600
Oh, I thought I was going to bounce me on his head. Oh, yeah

02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.680
Right easy

02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:19.680
Right stop

02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:21.840
Do I get runes? Oh crap gently

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:27.680
Gently

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:30.880
Gently

02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:34.800
Steady don't want to hurt the snowplow

02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:41.520
He's got taxes to pay you need to hold 30 back of your income for tax purposes most of the time is 30

02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:45.760
Easy

02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.040
Oh

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.520
Ouch captain if they raise an alarm you best find the back door

02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.640
They've created you access now get near the comm center and pray

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:02.960
Oh my god

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:07.600
Oh my god, please leave me alone a I please they may suspect something play it cool

02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:11.920
I'm playing it cool. I'm getting ready to fucking gear up

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:15.040
But I need to get near the comm center

02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:18.240
There should be like five clicks

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:24.240
Stop AI is already targeting me. It's already targeting me

02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:28.400
Oh, no, what is the countdown for?

02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:36.880
Oh, sorry my apologies. Okay. Okay, panicking. I don't remember much this map

02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:43.760
Friendly Thor, please transmit your ID code. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh ID code

02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.480
We do not have the information yet to stay inside the base until we get the intel

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:56.240
Again friendly Thor, please transmit the code

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.240
Captain hang tight. We're almost there get ready to move out fast

02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.200
Where do I move out to?

02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:07.680
Almost

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:09.680
Where

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:18.720
I fucking wasn't ready. Is that the door? Hold on. I think the door is over here. Please let me out. Please let me out

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.960
I don't want to go against an outlet. I'm scared. Oh, I'm gonna get some Alice. What did I do?

02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this not like this. How'd I get out? Oh, wait, I can fly I can fly

02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:37.040
No, I'm hay-bound. I'm hay-bound. Oh, no. I don't know where I'm supposed to go

02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:40.140
Alice that he go back over the Alice came from

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.320
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, wait, I'm supposed to destroy those. No, no, no

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:50.480
I can get it

02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:04.020
We just supposed to go the way the atlas came in okay restart

02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:17.740
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's get to it. I'm sure I can

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:27.620
outpace everything. It implied the gates were going to open. It bloated, didn't. Was that

02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:33.420
supposed to go out those gates? Anyone here put Mexico? Either pass the atlases or blow

02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:40.780
up the generator to open the other gate or go back and... If I go out the atlases thing,

02:39:40.780 --> 02:39:47.620
I assume they want to fight me. I just want to make sure I don't upset any little ground

02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:55.340
soldier unit. I think the door... Oh my god, you have to... Right. At least not over the

02:39:55.340 --> 02:40:02.660
generator's located, but... Did I even have the health to get out of there? Is my question...

02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:14.460
Okay. So... Okay. No alarm is raised. So begin... So go there and then I'm going to aim at the

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.500
freaking generator and then I'm just gonna go for it because there's not much I can do.

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:28.100
Okay. Right. Okay. And then the generator was around this corner. Okay. Okay. You don't need to tell me

02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:34.980
that there's enemies. I know there's enemies. Are you winning? We got rigged. We got really

02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:39.180
badly rigged. They fight you either way. The atlas is gonna hit you with so many bullets for trying

02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:53.340
to get away. Yeah. Oh god. What's my B? Oh god. Yes. Yes. Friendly. I'm friendly. I'm friendly. I'm

02:40:53.340 --> 02:41:03.260
friendly. I'm so nervous and scared. I'm freaking trying. I'm in position four, three, two, one.

02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:17.020
Uh-huh. Okay. I'm hiding behind this for now. Open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Please

02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:28.780
open. Please open. Are you fucking serious? Open! I'm going, but I'm so slow. What does this mean?

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:37.260
I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Oh god. Please close the gates behind me. Please close the gates

02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:42.620
behind me. I beg of you. Be close the gate or something. I don't know. Ring the guards.

02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:52.620
Anything. Please. There's too many of them. I can't do it. Oh my god. This is getting worse. There's

02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:57.260
an enemy ahead. Oh, but there's health on the road. Okay. Okay. The guards have been rang. The guards

02:41:57.260 --> 02:42:06.780
have been rang. Fight. Fucking gone. You didn't have to tell me twice, darling. I'm fucking gone.

02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:15.420
I'm with the wind. I'm with the sky. I hate these kind of omissions. Oh god. Right. We're getting

02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:19.100
farther. We're getting farther. That's the main thing. Okay. Across the bridge. Across the bridge.

02:42:19.100 --> 02:42:23.500
Surely, I have to get across the bridge. There's only one way through. The only way out is through

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:29.660
a heavily breamed port to be ravine. Follow this in an actual application point. Down there. Oh,

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:36.540
shy saw. I'm one HP in a dream. How is I supposed to win this? I'm going to have to look up a tutorial.

02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:46.140
Whoa. I'm dead. Whoa. Is that supposed to go down the river? I think I'm going down the river.

02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:58.300
Wait. All I have to do, I don't actually have to do anything. I just have to reach the extraction

02:42:58.300 --> 02:43:06.140
point. Hmm. Curious. Curious. The trucks dropped the hill. You've made good progress.

02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:09.340
That was a good attempt. I think I'm to go bottom right at that river.

02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:15.100
Oh, the trucks dropped health. The trucks. Okay, trucks. Look for a truck.

02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:21.260
I think that path was right. There was a natural cover around the bend. Okay.

02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:29.740
Just around the river bend. Strony, maybe time to ask your dad what he did. Honestly,

02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:33.180
I don't remember him playing this mission a lot, so I don't think he enjoyed it.

02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:43.500
Which I'm not even trying to agree with his taste in mission because WTF, mate.

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:54.140
We need mission control. Papacult is mission control. Right, let's go.

02:43:56.140 --> 02:44:02.780
That took so long for the gate to open. I'm going to hide behind the generator this time,

02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:09.740
so I don't take any damage at all. Counter started. I'm going to go behind the generator this time.

02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:20.700
There is a health pack right there. Can I shoot? I'm wondering if I should take that off on the way out.

02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:24.220
Okay, right side, there's a health pack when I leave. Oh, this truck has health.

02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:33.660
ID code. What do you mean comply? Get ready to move out. Okay, green trucks have health in it.

02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:42.540
Who do you think, huh? Okay. Three, two, one, go. I'm fucking trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:47.660
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Fucking hell, this is

02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:52.940
generator. Have someone come see. Oh, come on. Break already.

02:44:56.140 --> 02:45:00.380
Oh, is it broken? Okay, okay. So what, do you give me health?

02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:09.260
You're a lie. Okay, okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine that there's two atlases locked onto me.

02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:14.460
It's not a problem at all, as if that building could support the weight of my mech.

02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:20.780
Sorry, my mech is far too heavy for it. Oh, no, it just takes so much damage because I walked into

02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:24.060
that structure. Oh, my God, there's three heal stations.

02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:33.180
Wait, do you have health? Or is it the other ones that have health? Who the fuck is sniping me from

02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:41.740
the sky? I can't get a break, bro. I don't think I can actually do this. You, you, give me the health.

02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:50.860
Give me the health. You don't understand. You don't understand. You are mine. You are mine. Give

02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:56.540
me the health right now. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Great. Okay, health on the bridge.

02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:07.180
The only way, oh, I got stuck on that turret again. Oh, God, I'm like one health already. I'm half

02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:11.500
health already. Please stop shitting me. Oh, there's a green truck ahead. Get the truck.

02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:15.820
Get the truck. Beat it up. Give me that truck. Give me that HP right now. Give me that health.

02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:21.180
Fuck you. Beach. Fuck you, beach. Fuck you. Just think I won't do it.

02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:27.420
God, that thing has some health on it. Wait, I'm supposed to go down. Wait, I'm confused. No,

02:46:27.420 --> 02:46:32.220
up. Go up. Go up. Wait, give me a truck. Give me a truck. I'm half health. Give me a truck. Come on.

02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:36.460
Come on. Let me get a range. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:41.900
I'm so good at this health. There's health. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it.

02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:48.780
Shit. Shit's a base. Shit's a bomb car. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, there's another one.

02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:53.340
Oh, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. I have hope. I have hope. Fricking shoot it,

02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:57.420
though. Oh, wait, sorry. I'm flying. Wait, that's why I can't shoot it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm

02:46:57.420 --> 02:47:04.300
panicking. Panicking. Right. You. Fuck off. Oh, God, there's a new makeup ahead. No,

02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:11.420
you're not supposed to do that. Stop. Stop. You're making me so stressed. Oh, I see health. I see

02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:18.540
health. I see. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I'm doing great. Yeah. Yeah,

02:47:18.540 --> 02:47:23.900
I'm not panicking at all. I'm not panicking at all. It's fine. It's fine. No, I'm MLG at this game.

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:30.860
It's fine. Oh, God, the HUD is breaking. The HUD is breaking. Why? There's so much. Okay, I see green.

02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:35.500
I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see lots of green. I

02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:40.540
actually quite like seeing this much green. I have to admit, this is pretty cool. Yes, you better

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:47.900
have a plan to get me out. Okay, okay. Destroy the bridge when I'm on the other side. Oh, that's a

02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:55.420
freaking atlas. It's an atlas. It's an atlas. But break the bridge. Break the bridge. Break the bridge.

02:47:55.420 --> 02:48:02.060
I'm on the other side of the bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. Destroy the

02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:11.660
bridge. The motherfucking bridge. Oh, you suck so bad. Why do you suck so bad? Oh, no. Oh, no, it's

02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:20.700
all coming. Oh, why are you not destroying? No, don't lock onto the atlas. Fuck it. No, not like

02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:26.620
this. Not like this. Oh, no, I have to destroy the bridge to progress. Why? Why would you do

02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:34.540
this to me video game? Why? The bridge was hardly breaking. I was so close to dying. I was so close.

02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:46.220
No, I can't 1v1 a fucking atlas. No, why does the bridge die? Why does the ace have so much

02:48:46.220 --> 02:48:53.420
damage? Why does the bridge have so much HP?

02:48:56.060 --> 02:49:03.500
Because the rocket did very little damage? Yeah, well, your mom. I did it. I won the game.

02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:12.300
I won that fucking mission. You suck. You stinky game. You know I blew up that bridge.

02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:14.700
Freakin' have to use something else.

02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:24.620
This make only fires two at a time. So much for having make superiority with this one. It sucks.

02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:35.740
Stony, your spam flying is slowing you down a lot and overheating you.

02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:39.500
Oh, but I feel like if I fly, they don't hit me as much.

02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:44.620
Shoot the bridge as you walk across it because it has so much. Okay, I agree with this

02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:51.020
sentence. I approve of this message. Oh, excuse me. Sorry, you didn't see that. I promise I'm

02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:54.380
trained in this make and I haven't just put it on for the first, I haven't been inside it for the

02:49:54.380 --> 02:50:00.700
first time. Great. I will use X in zero.

02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:07.900
Oh, let me reset.

02:50:13.420 --> 02:50:18.940
I freaking bumped a building. I'm in a massive make. Fucking give me a chance. How did I get

02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:23.820
even worse? Literally, I kicked it. If you hit every health pick up along the way and just run

02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:30.380
serpentine, it'll be enough to get you there. Okay, okay, okay. We can do it. We can do it.

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:34.140
We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We want.

02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:38.700
Yeah, missiles have the least damage against these. The laser works better.

02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:45.900
Great. I can do it. I have faith. If there's any doubters,

02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:54.220
then doubters will be recommended to go watch V-Slammy V-Tubers instead of

02:50:54.220 --> 02:51:01.980
Viller Beach. Oh, that's so stressful. Right, stop flying. It slows me down.

02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:06.620
Okay, I can do this and I can not hit a building on the way there.

02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.140
All I have to do is not spank a building and then I just need to run.

02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:21.340
I'm sure someone's probably done this where he has killed everything before. I'd actually

02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:29.020
be very curious to see if someone's got gameplay of that. Okay. Stop AI locking onto me. You smell.

02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:31.660
I know what you're doing. I know what you are.

02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:35.660
Oh, hold on. Okay.

02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:43.820
Right, we're hacking into the comms unit. Slime arachnid V-Tuber with only one eye and a green

02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:49.900
skin, surely. Would we be able to do this mission on the first try? I said mods. Take that man out

02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:59.740
for 10 seconds. How dare he speak like that to me. How dare. Okay, we can do this. There's a

02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:04.620
little green truck here. If I really need it, then there's also a green one.

02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:13.980
I'm so terrified about it. You have got this, I believe in you. This is it. This is the run.

02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.340
This is the run because I'm using my X now.

02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:35.020
Okay, that was so much quicker. Right, don't use your fly. Stop panicking. Stop flying. Use it.

02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:39.980
Okay, I can do that. I can do that. Right, hold on. We'll get some coverage going through here.

02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:46.300
Pardon me, coming through. Okay, and then there's a health station to the left as I come out here.

02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:52.860
Oh my gosh, did I just mess up again? Oh, I think so.

02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:55.740
Oh, I'm running.

02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:03.260
Why did they have to make such a stressful mission? You! Give me, oh wait, there's one here too.

02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:06.380
Right, and then you're next. You're next.

02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:16.140
I'm fate. What fate? I'm fucking getting annihilated. There is no fate. There's only death and

02:53:17.020 --> 02:53:22.220
stinkiness. Is there even a health station? There isn't. Oh, you're the health pack. Okay, I found you.

02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:28.460
Right, I can shoot the bridge as I go along it because, no, not this one, the next bridge. Sorry.

02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:35.020
Next bridge, next bridge. Oh, something just splattered me for heavy. I don't know what it was, but it got me good.

02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:37.340
Okay, okay.

02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:49.180
Oh, ow, ow, that actually took a decent considerable chunk of damage. Ow, please stop, please stop.

02:53:49.180 --> 02:53:53.580
Please, I'm such a good feature, I'm such a good feature bird. Please, please,

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:57.820
God, stop taking tick damage. It's all I ask, please.

02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:04.060
Stop it. I don't even know what the pylons do when they spot you. Oh god, there's one there.

02:54:04.060 --> 02:54:09.740
Wait, well, why did all the other freaking mechas time out? Okay, one's on, one's hot on my R-Streets.

02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:14.300
I don't even know if I can pick this up. You can't even beat over Healed Canyon in those games. No,

02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:19.580
you can't. I'm full health. Okay, take it as a blessing. I'm full health. I'm full health. Take it as a blessing.

02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:22.620
Oh yeah, I'm full health. I'm full health. I don't fucking care.

02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:29.420
Go away. I don't know what the wee towers do, but I'm going for it. I'm going for it. I'm trying my best.

02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:41.660
I'm a good little mate, and I am doing great. Thank you. Okay, where the fuck do I go?

02:54:41.660 --> 02:54:46.940
Hello? Should I fuck up? I'll weave it. I'll weave it. It's okay. Back on course, back on course, back on

02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:52.220
course. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. Okay, I see it. I see the hell.

02:54:52.220 --> 02:55:00.060
Ah, no game. Don't break now. I'm almost there. Don't do that to me. Don't be so selfish. Okay.

02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:14.380
Okay. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm breaking free. I'm solving. I'm trying.

02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:24.060
There's not a bridge. There's gaining. Freaking. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Pop already.

02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:34.220
Come on. Come on. Yes. Fucking shove up your ass. Atlas. Fucking bam.

02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:39.500
Can you get this one too? I don't know if I need to do this one too, but I think I'm okay. Okay.

02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:48.220
Okay. Oh my god, we did it. We just need to destroy this one, which I can do. Oh my god,

02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:56.380
we did it. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, we did it.

02:55:59.100 --> 02:55:59.900
Oh.

02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:05.340
Wait a second. Holy crap. Sirs, I know what the word of Blake is doing on this planet.

02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:11.340
They found some sort of lost technology cache and something called Ragnarok.

02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:19.660
No. I'm going to signal the other dragoons. Ragnarok is even scarier than Atlas.

02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:24.940
Oh, no. We know where the guns are. Now we need to stop them before the invasions of the

02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:29.180
dragons are on. Wait, isn't the dragon the name of Dokey Bird?

02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:37.340
Oh, she got a new outfit. And a familiar model.

02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:46.700
Work your way towards the orbital gun any way you can and then destroy the gun.

02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:49.740
Oh, it's letting me pick.

02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:57.260
I'm going to say I didn't actually enjoy Thor that much, but Timberwolf.

02:56:59.020 --> 02:57:05.180
Timberwolf has so much spray and pray though with those things. I'll try with Timber,

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:09.420
if not, I'll take on the other one. You don't remember the Ragnarok? Okay,

02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:11.580
so think of Thor and then change everything by two.

02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:18.380
I like how they cut coms on him.

02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:25.260
Right. Again, we might lose it.

02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:29.740
Sir, you're going to face stiff defense. You may be able to skirt around the worst

02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:33.900
of it with a maneuverable mech. I don't care what you do, Captain. Get those guns.

02:57:33.900 --> 02:57:39.180
We have a tamer. If they eat the worst, well, well, well,

02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:43.420
if there's in the worst kind of game, well, they can give you a fricking tamed mission.

02:57:44.380 --> 02:57:47.500
Right. I can't fly. Maybe I should.

02:57:51.740 --> 02:57:53.260
Shit. Nothing's open. Huh?

02:57:55.340 --> 02:58:02.060
I can't fly. Wait. I softlocked myself because I have something that can't fly.

02:58:02.940 --> 02:58:05.020
Stop. Wait, can I destroy these walls?

02:58:05.980 --> 02:58:13.900
Can I open this door for Mimi? I'd appreciate that.

02:58:19.420 --> 02:58:23.340
I think I, unironically, think I need to start with the new mech.

02:58:24.700 --> 02:58:28.140
Right. Okay, hold on. Quit mission. Yeah.

02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:33.100
And then, okay, it was under the guns. We know where the guns are.

02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:37.580
Right. That's fine. And then give me mad cat, I guess.

02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:41.580
Mad cat. Well, Thor can fly as well.

02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:44.300
Sir, the new tool we're receiving is the heavy firepower.

02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:48.620
Straight through with one of our big gun mechs or take a jump capable mech and skirt around

02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:53.900
the edge of the base. Your call. Time is of the essence. The other dragoons are counting on you.

02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:57.340
I'll try mad cat. See behind. Wait, mad cat can't fly.

02:58:58.140 --> 02:59:05.580
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. Let's try that again. Mad cat can't fly. Thor can fly.

02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:09.580
We will pick Thor. Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:13.900
We know where the guns are. One more time for the, one more time from the top.

02:59:13.900 --> 02:59:19.980
Thor can fly. So we can fly over. Wow. You didn't think it was that hard.

02:59:21.100 --> 02:59:24.860
Don't forget, lasers are the structure busters. You can break the door.

02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:32.300
I didn't know that. Right. Hold on. We're using the laser beam. I'm a fire on the laser.

02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:37.340
Right. I'm going to all lock onto the retanks because it's just so much easier all alone.

02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:43.180
Whoa. This hardly does any damage on the all alone. Man, I want a mad cat so bad. They do so much

02:59:43.180 --> 02:59:53.260
damage like all alone. I mean, I like not having to try sometimes. Is that, is that so hard?

02:59:54.060 --> 03:00:01.420
Yes, you're a dumb, dumb, but you're a dumb, dumb, affectionately, affectionately, affectionately,

03:00:01.420 --> 03:00:05.180
though. Okay. So there's a health pack. I know a mad cat comes in. There's actually two health packs.

03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:12.300
That's a lot of resistance. Wow.

03:00:12.940 --> 03:00:23.660
Oh, here. I mean, this is, this is all locking on him pretty quickly. I have to say, I have to say,

03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:29.740
it's not, oh, that was some juicy damage he just did there. I don't know what my ultimate is,

03:00:29.740 --> 03:00:38.300
but I'll use it anyway. Wait, he's even sparking yet. I feel like I've done, who the fuck is shooting

03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:41.420
that? Fuck off! Honestly, doing my fucking hits in.

03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:52.620
Hold on, let me please redeem his ass. Oh, sugar. I'm out of, um, oh, he's limping?

03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:56.860
Is he limping? I think we're doing it. I think we're doing it. Okay. God, this is taking far too

03:00:56.860 --> 03:01:01.980
long. I think I'm wasting so much time doing this. Like, game-wise, I should not be doing,

03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:07.260
oh my God, he's literally about to get, about to get each other. We're actually having like a decent

03:01:07.260 --> 03:01:15.500
break, yeah. And there's an enemy behind me. What the heck? What am I supposed to do? Oh,

03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:24.460
I'm supposed to go north? Oh, fuck off. Right, you, fuck you. I don't, uh, I don't know if I should

03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:30.060
send it or not, but given you a timed mission, surely the game devs wouldn't be so evil to give

03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:34.060
you a timed mission and then give you a billion mechs in front of you for the past, so you're

03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:37.740
perfectly run out of time and you have to redo the whole 15-minute mission again.

03:01:38.460 --> 03:01:44.460
Surely. Surely for an old ass, I don't even know when this game came out. I probably wasn't even

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:58.380
born when I came out. No, I can't do it. Maybe. Because I never played it when I watched my dad

03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:05.580
run out of time. Can a mech be left alone to do their job exactly? Is this the right way?

03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:10.300
No, this is just a fiber.

03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:22.220
Me. How do I, do I fly? Oh, I can fly. Oh, it's fantastic.

03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:30.540
Uh, yeah, I think I've taken some kind of shortcut to the mountain. The good news.

03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:36.060
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:44.060
I am a little bit sparky.

03:02:44.380 --> 03:02:59.100
Okay, okay. Okay, I know there's a mech down there. Hold on. Hold on, you're next, mate. Hold on.

03:03:00.620 --> 03:03:06.380
Oh, are you freaking serious? Uh, can't be arsed when the AI is like hiding. Oh, and I just took a

03:03:06.380 --> 03:03:12.940
direct hit off something. Lovely. Oh, I don't know if I should be fighting you or not. Oh no.

03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:20.700
Right, you're just backing off. I don't know why. Sorry, mate, it was not working.

03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:30.300
I think the laser's on when you put that down. Sorry. Please just take these direct hits, please.

03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:39.660
I'm begging, please so I can pick up your freaking health. I need it. I need it. I need it. Give me

03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:48.460
your health. Okay, we're just kind of, yeah, okay, we're just gonna do this, yeah? I'm trying.

03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:58.380
He's not perishing. Okay, there we go. Give me that health. Give me that health. Okay, I'll pick it.

03:03:58.380 --> 03:04:05.260
Yeah, and you guys are fucking next. We're slowly getting damaged in the middle of that fight.

03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:11.900
Uh, we're doing the wrong way. I'm supposed to be going this week. Can you take fall damage?

03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:18.700
I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Uh, literally, uh, the guy knew it was inevitable.

03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:25.260
Right, another mech, but I can see the cannon. Okay, there you are. Fuck me. That's not good.

03:04:26.220 --> 03:04:30.940
You guys are so cheap. Like, why do you guys get two, but I only get one?

03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:41.500
The boys? Captain, help me out, question mark. The mad cat is currently going around me to

03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:46.380
sandwich me. Can you see it on the hard bottom left? The mad cat is going around to freaking

03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:49.660
sandwich me. I'm not even kidding. Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to move into this health part.

03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:57.260
Yeah, the mad cat is getting me from behind. I'm not happy with that. I don't know.

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:09.500
No, do not randomly swap fucking magazines for that. Oh, come on. Call the weak guy at least.

03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:18.140
Sir. Oh, I'm running out of time. Oh, I'm completely out of fucking. Oh.

03:05:20.860 --> 03:05:27.660
Oh, face of maneuvers. A face of maneuvers. That's so loud behind me. Please stop. Please stop.

03:05:28.460 --> 03:05:35.420
Hold on. I'm over the edge. Oh, but when I jump, right, blow them up. No, I didn't do any

03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:41.500
freaking environmental damage against them. I would very much like to win this mission in one go.

03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:44.060
I do not want to replay this mission. I'm going to be honest.

03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:59.580
I took, like, so much direct damage there. I'm so, the overheat is, like, punishing me so hard right

03:05:59.580 --> 03:06:05.500
now. And, of course, I never made it. I was a waste of time. Oh, right. Hold on. He's smoking.

03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:11.420
He's smoking. That's what you get for smoking. Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna have to jump this

03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:18.620
chicken wall to not get hit by this fight again. Hold on. Oh, I need to get over. There we go.

03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:25.260
Fuck you. Fuck you. I need to kill. Oh, I'm going to get direct hit off the spam.

03:06:25.980 --> 03:06:31.500
How much have I got? About eight minutes to destroy this and the next one. I don't like mods.

03:06:32.140 --> 03:06:36.780
Yeah, you better start limping. You have, you have, limping, limping, limping.

03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:42.940
Fucking destroy this. I've got seven minutes to find the last one.

03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:52.140
Oh, sorry. Right. Hold on. Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? This way? It says this way. Hold on.

03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:57.180
If I go up. Oh, there it is. Oh, my God. There it is. It's right there. Holy crap. We can do it.

03:06:57.180 --> 03:07:02.060
We can do it in one. We can do it in one. Now, let it spawn eight billion mints all at once for me to

03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:05.980
perish. Sorry, you're going down. You're actually going down. I don't care what you're shooting at me.

03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:11.580
You're going down first. Whoo. The orbital guns were our primary mission, but we got another one from upstairs.

03:07:11.580 --> 03:07:17.500
So they aren't our yet. The Icarus isn't fixed enough to get us off-planet, but it can move us around.

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:22.780
Command wants us to figure out what this Ragnarok is and seize the lost technology

03:07:22.780 --> 03:07:27.740
while the rest of the vehicles are at the word of Blake here. So we're off to a hellish wasteland

03:07:27.740 --> 03:07:34.620
of lava and dust storms. Once more into the breach, A-Tiger. Once more. I'd rather be. We did it.

03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:41.260
Whoa, we did it. Oh, they give you like double the time. Okay. The new case of our mission.

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:46.460
What's the name of this mission? Size Mars? Gambling, whatever floats your boat.

03:07:46.540 --> 03:07:52.380
Size Mars. We did it. I'm so glad. If you just need the last one, you can take your

03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:56.700
odds and bomb us. As you know, we are en route to the wasteland. We have received some intel that

03:07:56.700 --> 03:08:03.180
got me thinking, and I have a plan. Oh, great. First, we have an old two-power armor in

03:08:03.180 --> 03:08:08.540
hold. Captain, you are just the right size. That added to the fact that we've learned that

03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:13.660
a number of word of Blake dignitariers are having some sort of celebration during an invasion.

03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:20.460
Remember that time I actually did the plan. In this power armor, their sensors won't pick you up.

03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:26.140
The bad guys won't go on full alert. You will face defenders just not their whole force. Get

03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:30.860
through their base and find their mechs. Steal one, and then you'll be inside their defenses,

03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:34.300
giving them hell before they know it. Steal a mech. Move through the small city,

03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:39.420
demolish the regional palace, and crash their little party. What can I say? Brilliant.

03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:47.660
Steal a mech. Can I steal an alice? Elemental, a suit of powered... Oh, that makes me want to play

03:08:47.660 --> 03:08:54.060
cameo. Sorry. A suit of powered battle armor. An elemental is no match for mechs in single...

03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:59.580
Who goes out? Combat. Hmm. Hmm. My size matters.

03:08:59.580 --> 03:09:03.260
Let me defense should be minimal, though I recommend you stay away from combat.

03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:16.540
Whoa, I'm so cute. Oh my god. I'm so cool. Oh, look at me go. Oh, I'm so fast. Holy crap. Like,

03:09:16.540 --> 03:09:23.900
but I don't have much thrusters to me. Oh, I'm so cute. Oh, sorry. Wait, what are you...

03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:33.740
What even armor? Is something shooting me? There is. Whoa, I can hear it.

03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:43.660
What did I do?

03:09:43.660 --> 03:09:48.460
What sort of scraps do I...

03:09:51.500 --> 03:09:55.660
I hear. Whoa, I have so much lift.

03:09:59.660 --> 03:10:06.220
Scissors and enemy over here. Whoa. Okay, thank goodness fall damage in a mech suit isn't a thing,

03:10:06.220 --> 03:10:11.660
because... There's something red over here, so I assume that's where I'm supposed to go.

03:10:11.900 --> 03:10:23.820
Whoa. Whoa, who, who, who, who? Oh my god, so this is what it's like to be like a tiny

03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:33.740
big round unit. Okay, we got him. Who next? Wait, I didn't get him. It's so rich.

03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:35.740
Wow.

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:44.380
Up here?

03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:51.340
Sorry, I don't really have much of a recollection of this at all.

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:55.340
Oh.

03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:08.460
Am I going too fast for you? Too bad. Plop, plop, plop, plop. Oh, there's a wee baby one.

03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:17.180
That's what we're fainting. Okay, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, let me get into the fight.

03:11:17.900 --> 03:11:21.420
Geeze, is this Out of Bones? Is that why? I think this might be Out of Bones and

03:11:21.420 --> 03:11:26.300
he's like an invisible wall. Well, I got a lick off on someone. Oh crap, how'd I get around?

03:11:27.900 --> 03:11:34.460
Sir, I'm reading an incoming mech. Somewhere. It must be using no sig. Captain, you can't fight him.

03:11:34.460 --> 03:11:41.020
Get a move on. No, no, don't give me a run and map again. I get too stressed out when you give me

03:11:41.020 --> 03:11:50.780
run maps. Wait, what the heck am I supposed to...? Something's dying behind me. I'm so confused

03:11:50.780 --> 03:11:59.420
where I'm supposed to go. I'm so sorry, guys. This door? Okay, is this like maybe a generator

03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:04.940
to open a door? There's two mechs after me now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can hear it freaking

03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:09.660
charging up against me. You just relaxed me. What am I supposed to do?

03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:17.980
Sorry, I'm probably gonna die, but it's too too confusing rather than being bad.

03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:23.260
Well, I am bad, but I don't... Is there something back there?

03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:28.700
Was I supposed to kill a generator?

03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:39.100
Huh. There's three. Just run, but run where? Oh, shit.

03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:47.180
Oh, my, my gear is on for registering now. Oh, okay, it's registering again. Hold on.

03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:53.900
Am I just wee enough that they can't shoot me? Well, they can shoot me a wee bit, but where am I?

03:12:54.700 --> 03:13:00.860
Sorry, sorry. Let me just focus on the map detail, because they wouldn't put sections in the map

03:13:00.860 --> 03:13:07.580
if they weren't supposed to go near it, kind of. Right, so it is that gate, but how do I get over it?

03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:10.540
All right, I'm low health, that's all.

03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:16.780
You mean you're confused because of how good I am at the same exact...

03:13:17.660 --> 03:13:22.620
Is it... And before it just opens... Oh, for fuck's sake! Come on!

03:13:26.940 --> 03:13:35.020
As if that was the solution! I was joking! Oh, of course it was. I wasted so much health,

03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:40.060
no. I don't know if I'll make it run through. Yeah, they don't even drop health because we're so

03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:51.500
Chinese. Oh, well, oh well. Okay, we'll try again next run. At least we know the gate opens.

03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:56.300
Good job, sir. Had me sweating. You were sweating, briefing boy.

03:14:03.660 --> 03:14:06.220
Let me guess, this break, it kind of looked breakable.

03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:12.700
Or not. Oh, it's a shame they don't give you a health pack anywhere.

03:14:14.060 --> 03:14:16.940
Right, we'll know much better than for next time.

03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:26.380
Hmm. Okay, so come down the lava path, they take a little lift.

03:14:26.380 --> 03:14:30.460
When in doubt, just walk out. Once again, Stroney assumes she can't go somewhere without trying.

03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:35.020
I mean, every other part of the game has been like, you can't go there, you must destroy

03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:49.340
something in order to do it. So, XK is... So, as I was saying, XK is me.

03:14:50.300 --> 03:14:53.900
For, um, assuming otherwise.

03:15:00.300 --> 03:15:03.420
I am definitely getting Kablamo's, like, right now by that guy.

03:15:07.580 --> 03:15:15.980
In a cavern. Secret cavern. Secret cavern. Fly away from the loofy.

03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:21.180
The Cougar. Secret, secret, secret, secret cavern.

03:15:23.260 --> 03:15:26.780
How am I doing this on one HP? Seriously, drop me at least one HP.

03:15:26.780 --> 03:15:29.820
Like, don't be shy, game. Don't be shy. Drop me one HP.

03:15:38.220 --> 03:15:43.420
All of it? All of it feels good, man. Have I cornered myself? Be honest.

03:15:45.980 --> 03:15:48.860
I haven't cornered myself. I need to keep going. Keep going.

03:15:49.580 --> 03:15:51.980
We're breaking free. We're so good.

03:15:55.820 --> 03:15:57.500
There's no a-me-king.

03:15:59.820 --> 03:16:03.500
Uh, a tank. I can handle a tank in my wee baby armor.

03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:06.940
I can handle a tank. Look, Zia, just scream free.

03:16:08.620 --> 03:16:11.500
I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying.

03:16:12.140 --> 03:16:17.420
See? All is good. This game, I ain't got nothing to worry about in my little elemental guy.

03:16:17.420 --> 03:16:22.540
I'm so tiny and cute, okay? I need to stop flying. I need to destroy these guys.

03:16:22.540 --> 03:16:28.700
Wait, there's someone behind me? It's Zia! Naughty. You're not supposed to go behind me.

03:16:31.020 --> 03:16:33.500
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I don't have infinite health.

03:16:34.220 --> 03:16:38.700
If you could all just group up and stop and start missing your shots, that would be great.

03:16:38.780 --> 03:16:41.820
Please, group up and start missing your shots. Thank you.

03:16:43.260 --> 03:16:47.340
This has been... Oh no, the cougar is coming up to me.

03:16:48.380 --> 03:16:50.540
Better get a move on. The cougar is chasing me.

03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:58.620
P.O.V., you're a college boy in the classic American popcorn film.

03:16:58.620 --> 03:17:00.300
The cougar is coming for me.

03:17:02.780 --> 03:17:06.860
See? See? They said blast the building because the gate is controlled by it.

03:17:09.260 --> 03:17:13.180
Does that actually mean that, or did it not mean that? Oh, this, sorry.

03:17:14.380 --> 03:17:19.420
The comb's coming. Let me in. What's in here? Other than...

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:27.900
Jackpot, kid in a candy store. Captain, um, Captain, stop window shopping. The Atlas will do fine.

03:17:29.900 --> 03:17:33.740
Atlas time! Let's see how we do with this stop, boy.

03:17:34.700 --> 03:17:41.100
Whoa. Hello. Daddy's home.

03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:53.740
Okay, let's see. Oh, next mission.

03:17:53.980 --> 03:18:00.460
No, still same. Still same.

03:18:06.220 --> 03:18:07.260
I remember.

03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:15.580
Okay, I don't want to waste too much ammo on that stuff.

03:18:16.460 --> 03:18:17.900
Okay.

03:18:21.980 --> 03:18:23.500
Oh, one hit, baby.

03:18:28.220 --> 03:18:29.820
Well, I bet he regrets it now.

03:18:33.740 --> 03:18:36.060
Show em' this. Size max.

03:18:36.060 --> 03:18:36.940
Whoa, it's probably the...

03:18:39.660 --> 03:18:40.780
Wait, hold on. How do I aim?

03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:45.500
Okay. Holy. Holy schmooze.

03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:48.940
Holy schmooze. No, back up. I hate when they do that.

03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:55.900
Stop. Hey, dang.

03:18:57.980 --> 03:19:02.940
I'm overheating. Oh, my God. The Atlas has very limited mobility.

03:19:02.940 --> 03:19:06.700
Holy crap. Like, even turning to look at him? Very limited.

03:19:07.660 --> 03:19:09.260
Okay. Enough out of YouTube.

03:19:11.020 --> 03:19:13.020
Jeez. Let's see what we got here.

03:19:15.980 --> 03:19:19.100
Okay, there we go. Yeah, the mobility is like,

03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:20.940
whoa, it's rough trying to do it.

03:19:20.940 --> 03:19:23.260
But I actually like that detail being like,

03:19:23.260 --> 03:19:26.220
oh, I almost fell into the lava. You didn't see that.

03:19:26.220 --> 03:19:29.660
And I like that it feels like, oh, you know.

03:19:30.380 --> 03:19:32.860
The only thing about that was we caught him napping.

03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:34.700
Punch through that weakened wall section.

03:19:34.780 --> 03:19:36.700
We caught him napping? Sure.

03:19:39.980 --> 03:19:41.820
Right, let's see what we're up against.

03:19:41.820 --> 03:19:44.140
Right, it's a few tanks. Nothing that I can't even do.

03:19:45.180 --> 03:19:46.700
Whoa, there's...

03:19:46.700 --> 03:19:48.940
You take forever to shoot for how...

03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:50.540
Please.

03:19:54.060 --> 03:19:58.540
Nope, you do not need to start destroying the natural rock foundation.

03:19:59.740 --> 03:20:02.380
As fine as it is.

03:20:03.340 --> 03:20:04.620
Here's the next.

03:20:05.660 --> 03:20:06.620
That's a barrier.

03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:10.860
I complete this game all day.

03:20:13.340 --> 03:20:15.580
Has everything just got more HP all of a sudden?

03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:17.420
Oh, wait. Oh, it's just a cougar.

03:20:19.260 --> 03:20:22.700
Uh, I'm scared.

03:20:22.700 --> 03:20:25.740
I don't like the lack of mobility.

03:20:28.540 --> 03:20:30.860
I'm talking about... Where is it? Oh, it's down there.

03:20:30.860 --> 03:20:32.380
Okay, he's in the lava? Hello?

03:20:32.380 --> 03:20:33.260
Are you hurting yourself?

03:20:35.260 --> 03:20:37.420
Oh, make it rain hell.

03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:39.980
Oh, please.

03:20:41.100 --> 03:20:44.860
Okay, I'm completely comprehend why the Atlas was my dad's favorite mate.

03:20:44.860 --> 03:20:46.300
Because, oh my goodness.

03:20:47.900 --> 03:20:49.100
Literally make it rain.

03:20:51.100 --> 03:20:51.600
Yeah.

03:20:54.300 --> 03:20:54.940
Oh, gosh.

03:20:56.620 --> 03:20:57.420
Oh, hold on.

03:20:58.380 --> 03:20:59.260
What's this one?

03:21:01.580 --> 03:21:04.140
Oh, wow. That's actually really overpowered as well.

03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:06.460
Is there any health pack for troops during this one?

03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:09.740
You look like... Yeah, we got it.

03:21:10.940 --> 03:21:14.540
Lack of mobility makes up for the HP, the armor,

03:21:14.540 --> 03:21:17.020
and then the four death rays attached.

03:21:17.020 --> 03:21:17.980
Also, real guns.

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:20.300
Yes, I quite agree.

03:21:20.300 --> 03:21:21.180
Wait, am I going down there?

03:21:23.180 --> 03:21:25.740
I came from there.

03:21:27.260 --> 03:21:28.700
Yeah, question mark.

03:21:29.100 --> 03:21:34.220
Was this the one that got him all the wins on multiplayer?

03:21:34.220 --> 03:21:34.620
Yeah.

03:21:35.180 --> 03:21:35.740
Wait, I must be...

03:21:37.420 --> 03:21:39.100
I didn't say I must be supposed to go through the lava,

03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:40.140
but I didn't see it, right?

03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:43.580
Right.

03:21:45.180 --> 03:21:45.820
Oh, I see it.

03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:47.900
Can I get it before it gets me?

03:21:49.420 --> 03:21:50.140
I can.

03:21:50.140 --> 03:21:50.700
You too?

03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:56.860
Oh, it's so nice being able to reach the enemy before the enemy gets you.

03:21:57.820 --> 03:21:58.460
Oh, shit.

03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:00.940
See something in the distance?

03:22:00.940 --> 03:22:01.900
It's very blurry.

03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:03.420
I don't know how blurry it is for you, but...

03:22:04.700 --> 03:22:05.500
The mech just...

03:22:06.220 --> 03:22:06.780
The mech.

03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:08.060
The enemy just like...

03:22:08.060 --> 03:22:08.380
Whoa.

03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:09.740
Look at that.

03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:10.380
That's so nice.

03:22:12.940 --> 03:22:14.380
Right. Hold on.

03:22:15.980 --> 03:22:17.100
Okay, let's go.

03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:17.740
Mech time.

03:22:17.740 --> 03:22:23.180
Who are we against in this lovely enemy?

03:22:23.980 --> 03:22:29.180
I think because of his health being so low,

03:22:29.180 --> 03:22:30.780
we're just gonna blow this guy down.

03:22:32.220 --> 03:22:32.940
Easy, easy.

03:22:32.940 --> 03:22:35.740
And actually, we could probably drop the bridge on him.

03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:36.300
You know that?

03:22:37.420 --> 03:22:39.980
Oh, I want his health outside the lava though.

03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:40.940
Yeah, there we go.

03:22:40.940 --> 03:22:42.060
No, don't go in the lava.

03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:43.100
Sugar.

03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:45.020
He fell back and...

03:22:45.020 --> 03:22:47.500
Well, it's not like we need a major HP.

03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:47.820
I don't know.

03:22:47.820 --> 03:22:50.060
Maybe we can touch it gently.

03:22:50.060 --> 03:22:50.540
Easy.

03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:52.140
Just tip two.

03:22:52.220 --> 03:22:53.260
Hey, we go.

03:22:54.700 --> 03:22:55.260
Right, we're dead.

03:22:59.340 --> 03:23:02.060
I'm gonna break the bridge so the lava isn't a problem.

03:23:02.060 --> 03:23:03.660
Because I don't want to lose health the lava.

03:23:06.860 --> 03:23:07.500
I can't...

03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:08.460
I see nothing.

03:23:08.460 --> 03:23:11.340
Yeah, it's a very cloudy game.

03:23:12.220 --> 03:23:12.460
I...

03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:14.300
I guess we did.

03:23:14.300 --> 03:23:15.500
It's kinda a bit cloudy.

03:23:15.500 --> 03:23:16.380
Is this not gonna break?

03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:16.940
Can you break it?

03:23:19.580 --> 03:23:21.020
Lasers will break it faster.

03:23:21.020 --> 03:23:22.380
I'm gonna hold it off for the mech.

03:23:24.220 --> 03:23:24.700
I assume...

03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:28.140
Well, I assumed completely wrong.

03:23:28.780 --> 03:23:31.100
I am actually gonna have to walk in the lava a little bit.

03:23:33.020 --> 03:23:33.900
Oh wait, no, no.

03:23:33.900 --> 03:23:35.180
Oh, wow.

03:23:35.180 --> 03:23:35.420
Okay.

03:23:36.780 --> 03:23:39.180
I just love making things harder for myself,

03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:42.380
clearly, because spending the time to do that

03:23:42.380 --> 03:23:45.260
only to yield absolutely nothing is pretty good.

03:23:45.260 --> 03:23:45.900
That's not good enough.

03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:49.020
Right, I've been given special services.

03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:51.980
Partygoers?

03:23:51.980 --> 03:23:52.300
Where?

03:23:53.340 --> 03:23:53.820
Oh, here.

03:23:56.220 --> 03:23:57.020
Uh...

03:23:57.020 --> 03:23:57.580
In here?

03:23:58.860 --> 03:23:59.660
Whoa!

03:23:59.660 --> 03:24:01.980
That's the lava in me that came out of nowhere.

03:24:02.620 --> 03:24:03.420
Are you these guys?

03:24:03.420 --> 03:24:03.820
One...

03:24:03.820 --> 03:24:05.180
Oh, there's a mech on the battlefield.

03:24:05.180 --> 03:24:05.740
Hold on.

03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:06.300
Mech first.

03:24:07.500 --> 03:24:08.140
Oh, hold on.

03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:09.260
Two!

03:24:10.060 --> 03:24:10.540
Atlas!

03:24:13.900 --> 03:24:15.340
Is that an Atlas or a Magiskun?

03:24:15.340 --> 03:24:16.060
Scoot's Freddy.

03:24:17.020 --> 03:24:17.500
Okay.

03:24:20.700 --> 03:24:21.420
Is that an Atlas?

03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:22.940
No.

03:24:22.940 --> 03:24:24.060
It's just tangible.

03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:25.420
No, it is an Atlas!

03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:26.620
Oh, dear.

03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:27.180
Oh, dear.

03:24:29.980 --> 03:24:30.860
Oh, dear.

03:24:30.860 --> 03:24:31.580
Oh, dear.

03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:32.780
Little Atlas moment.

03:24:32.780 --> 03:24:33.260
Tee hee.

03:24:33.980 --> 03:24:34.220
Great.

03:24:34.220 --> 03:24:35.020
So what do I need to do?

03:24:35.020 --> 03:24:36.300
Take my one by one,

03:24:36.300 --> 03:24:38.620
and then just hook up all their insides.

03:24:40.460 --> 03:24:41.180
And then your neck.

03:24:42.780 --> 03:24:43.180
Wah.

03:24:44.780 --> 03:24:45.500
Wah.

03:24:45.500 --> 03:24:46.300
Not good, not good.

03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:47.420
I can't see nothing bumping.

03:24:47.420 --> 03:24:48.380
Pick it up, whatever it is.

03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:51.580
Okay, we're just gonna do this on the Atlas.

03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:53.420
It's the best we've all.

03:24:53.420 --> 03:24:54.620
Right, Atlas down first.

03:24:54.620 --> 03:24:55.020
Hold on.

03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:56.860
Is he smoking yet?

03:24:58.220 --> 03:25:00.540
I'd rather you smoke first than me, buddy.

03:25:00.540 --> 03:25:01.180
To be honest.

03:25:01.900 --> 03:25:03.100
Nah, let's rubbish that.

03:25:04.620 --> 03:25:05.340
Right.

03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:05.820
See you!

03:25:06.940 --> 03:25:07.660
Oh, sugar.

03:25:07.660 --> 03:25:08.700
I'm low health.

03:25:08.700 --> 03:25:09.980
Not good, not good, not good.

03:25:10.860 --> 03:25:12.940
Oh, it would suck if I had to restart.

03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:14.060
Come on, one big chug!

03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:15.340
One big chug on him!

03:25:15.420 --> 03:25:17.100
No, stop flying, mate, stop flying.

03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:18.540
Give me your health, give me your health.

03:25:18.540 --> 03:25:19.740
Give me your health, give me your health.

03:25:19.740 --> 03:25:20.300
Oh, right.

03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:21.340
Give me your health then,

03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:22.460
if you're gonna go down first.

03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:23.820
Please!

03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:25.500
I'm on my knees!

03:25:27.580 --> 03:25:28.220
Oh, sugar.

03:25:28.220 --> 03:25:30.220
I have to literally walk into this guy's bullet.

03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:33.180
Oh, that was so lucky I managed to cut that health.

03:25:33.180 --> 03:25:33.820
Holy crap.

03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:36.060
Wah.

03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:39.980
Wah, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:41.020
Sorry, it's not luck at all.

03:25:41.020 --> 03:25:42.700
It's skills, complete and utter skills.

03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:46.700
I'm the daughter of a meccosalt prodigy.

03:25:46.700 --> 03:25:48.780
I will not have anything else.

03:25:48.780 --> 03:25:51.180
Right, I'm gonna look for any green buildings

03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:55.740
through the absolutely smoky haze that is this game.

03:25:55.740 --> 03:25:57.100
Holy, holey moley.

03:25:57.100 --> 03:25:58.620
I cannot see for the life of me.

03:26:00.620 --> 03:26:02.140
Any green at all.

03:26:02.140 --> 03:26:03.900
Like, seriously, any green at all.

03:26:03.900 --> 03:26:07.980
Or any hidden green, no.

03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:08.460
Am I okay?

03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:09.980
That was worth it.

03:26:09.980 --> 03:26:13.740
What is that off the head?

03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:16.860
What is?

03:26:19.980 --> 03:26:21.900
Oh, I upset something.

03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:23.020
Hold on, how do I get around?

03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:26.620
Just firing, I'm just firing.

03:26:26.620 --> 03:26:27.900
How do I get around?

03:26:28.780 --> 03:26:29.580
Is there no around?

03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:30.460
Is there only through?

03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:35.020
Sorry, my mobility's so slow that I'm trying to...

03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:36.540
Oh god, this looks like the path though.

03:26:36.540 --> 03:26:38.300
Oh, dumb ass, there's a path right there.

03:26:39.260 --> 03:26:41.340
I hope that there's something that's able to shoot me.

03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:45.180
Yeah, lucky shot, not lucky shot at all.

03:26:46.300 --> 03:26:49.420
As, eh, right, hold on.

03:26:49.420 --> 03:26:50.780
And then there's one over there.

03:26:50.780 --> 03:26:51.740
Can I see it?

03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:53.340
Nope, but you can see me or not?

03:26:55.740 --> 03:26:56.460
Nope, I missed.

03:26:57.420 --> 03:26:58.860
Something blew on my HUD.

03:26:58.860 --> 03:27:01.020
Bottom left, top left.

03:27:01.020 --> 03:27:04.460
Sorry, I'll let him bolt for health or something.

03:27:05.260 --> 03:27:08.380
Destroy this.

03:27:10.540 --> 03:27:11.500
I'd rather...

03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:13.260
Oh, I want to save my other ammo.

03:27:13.260 --> 03:27:15.100
Whoa, it makes the team out.

03:27:15.100 --> 03:27:15.740
I can't see him.

03:27:17.980 --> 03:27:20.060
Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

03:27:20.060 --> 03:27:22.780
I can moan down, I can moan down, I can moan down, it's fine.

03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:24.620
Oh god, he's got...

03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:27.420
I'm overheating like hell on there.

03:27:28.780 --> 03:27:30.540
Hold on, mate, can you just pause the fight?

03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:32.460
Pause the fight, I need a heal.

03:27:32.460 --> 03:27:33.020
Sorry, I need a...

03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:39.660
Not good, not good, not good.

03:27:39.660 --> 03:27:41.260
Oh god, he's burning though.

03:27:41.260 --> 03:27:42.300
That's what I want to see.

03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:43.980
That's what I want to see, not me though.

03:27:46.860 --> 03:27:48.780
We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.

03:27:48.780 --> 03:27:49.340
We're doing it.

03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:52.140
True protégé, momento.

03:27:52.140 --> 03:27:53.500
Right, what's going on here?

03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:55.660
Did I not successfully destroy that?

03:27:57.020 --> 03:27:58.140
I don't really want to...

03:28:00.540 --> 03:28:01.020
I don't want to...

03:28:01.180 --> 03:28:02.300
All is quiet.

03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:04.780
The Blake brass has been eighty-six years fled.

03:28:04.780 --> 03:28:06.380
All combat forces have been in the way.

03:28:06.380 --> 03:28:07.420
Okay, okay.

03:28:09.180 --> 03:28:12.380
Wow, that's why I want to hold on to the ch-ch-ch-ch-amel

03:28:12.380 --> 03:28:13.260
because it's soon.

03:28:15.260 --> 03:28:18.140
Was it too much to ask that that lunatic was at the party?

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:21.900
Captain, we are en route to your current position.

03:28:21.900 --> 03:28:25.180
The Major has decided to bring the Icarus down right where you are.

03:28:25.180 --> 03:28:27.740
Foster, let's try not to crash this time, eh?

03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:34.220
Okay, a little slo-mo, a little slo-mo.

03:28:34.220 --> 03:28:34.540
Okay.

03:28:36.380 --> 03:28:39.100
We've obtained information that more suspected rebels

03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:42.460
are being made to work in factories reinforcing the word of Blake.

03:28:42.460 --> 03:28:42.860
Uh-huh.

03:28:42.860 --> 03:28:44.620
We can kill two birds with one stone

03:28:44.620 --> 03:28:47.180
by freeing the prisoners and destroying the factories.

03:28:47.180 --> 03:28:48.860
We're going to hot-drop you in, sir.

03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:50.940
Destroy local forces between you and the camp.

03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:51.420
Secure escape, bro.

03:28:51.420 --> 03:28:54.780
Take the camp towers out and, as always, flatten any hostile troops.

03:28:56.300 --> 03:28:58.540
Okay, I'm gonna take a hydration.

03:28:58.540 --> 03:29:00.140
Everyone please do hydrate.

03:29:00.220 --> 03:29:04.300
Shawnee destroys your mech and takes you as a trophy ASMR win.

03:29:09.260 --> 03:29:11.580
How rich do you have to be to build a mansion in a volcano?

03:29:11.580 --> 03:29:14.140
I mean, why would you even want a mansion in a volcano?

03:29:15.500 --> 03:29:16.060
Ugh.

03:29:16.060 --> 03:29:17.100
Okay, I've hydrated.

03:29:18.860 --> 03:29:19.900
Uh, right, let's see.

03:29:20.780 --> 03:29:21.100
Okay.

03:29:22.060 --> 03:29:28.220
Well, an assault class mech, the Atlas is an offensive force rarely matched.

03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:28.940
Yeah, sorry.

03:29:28.940 --> 03:29:29.980
I'm picking Atlas.

03:29:30.540 --> 03:29:32.140
If we're gonna get a lot of this,

03:29:32.780 --> 03:29:35.500
game does a good job of making these bad guys seem bad.

03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:36.700
I hope I'm not the bad guy.

03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:39.340
Well, we're already on mix fight.

03:29:39.340 --> 03:29:40.620
Hold on, there's a wee guy there.

03:29:41.180 --> 03:29:42.380
Can you all lock on him?

03:29:42.380 --> 03:29:42.780
Thank you.

03:29:45.820 --> 03:29:47.420
Did we chop her as well while we're at it?

03:29:47.420 --> 03:29:48.140
Hold on.

03:29:48.140 --> 03:29:48.380
What?

03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:48.860
Nope.

03:29:48.860 --> 03:29:50.060
That's not gonna attack me.

03:29:50.460 --> 03:29:50.960
Okay.

03:29:54.060 --> 03:29:58.460
That's currently installing mods to give me extra XP to use.

03:29:58.460 --> 03:29:59.740
XP is XP, is that it?

03:30:01.260 --> 03:30:03.580
Wah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:30:07.260 --> 03:30:07.820
Okay, hold on.

03:30:07.820 --> 03:30:11.580
I think this might, oh wow, that shotgun blast definitely is the one.

03:30:13.180 --> 03:30:16.700
Get out of the lava so I can at least scavenge your dead parts.

03:30:20.300 --> 03:30:20.940
Come on.

03:30:20.940 --> 03:30:21.420
Yeah.

03:30:22.940 --> 03:30:25.580
Oh no, I can't pick it up.

03:30:26.300 --> 03:30:27.900
It broke the magma.

03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:30.620
Ah, draft.

03:30:31.340 --> 03:30:32.860
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

03:30:34.300 --> 03:30:35.980
Racing for racing, but it's fine.

03:30:37.660 --> 03:30:38.940
Can't pick up the supply.

03:30:38.940 --> 03:30:40.780
Okay, the magma breaks.

03:30:40.780 --> 03:30:43.100
I assume it will break under the weight of my mix.

03:30:43.100 --> 03:30:46.860
You know, all things considered, I probably weigh how many tons?

03:30:47.980 --> 03:30:48.780
On ironically?

03:30:50.540 --> 03:30:55.660
I don't want to waste too much of the shotgun.

03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:58.220
The shotgun seems so effective against the enemies.

03:30:59.580 --> 03:31:00.780
I can see you guys.

03:31:00.780 --> 03:31:01.980
I can't target you.

03:31:01.980 --> 03:31:04.220
I wonder why it's not enjoying the targeting as much.

03:31:05.580 --> 03:31:06.080
Hmm.

03:31:07.980 --> 03:31:10.860
Oh wow, that's actually a decent chunk, so I mean, hold on.

03:31:12.220 --> 03:31:13.180
Stop it, stop it.

03:31:13.900 --> 03:31:15.580
No, no, no, don't hide from me now.

03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:16.780
You started the fight.

03:31:16.780 --> 03:31:17.900
I'm gonna end it.

03:31:17.900 --> 03:31:20.700
Do you understand your actions have consequences?

03:31:20.700 --> 03:31:21.820
You're gonna find out now.

03:31:21.820 --> 03:31:22.300
Goodbye.

03:31:23.180 --> 03:31:24.940
And I'm here if you were following orders.

03:31:24.940 --> 03:31:25.580
You're done for.

03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:26.540
How much have I got?

03:31:26.540 --> 03:31:28.620
Oh wait, I've got infinite bullet ammo as well.

03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:30.380
But I've only got...

03:31:30.380 --> 03:31:32.380
Oh wow, okay, sorry, I'm just gonna use the...

03:31:33.660 --> 03:31:34.220
Who have I got?

03:31:34.780 --> 03:31:37.180
Okay, let's get rid of you and then let's get started on you.

03:31:38.700 --> 03:31:41.500
But you'll need to come down so I can pick up your supplies, okay?

03:31:45.180 --> 03:31:46.780
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

03:31:46.780 --> 03:31:47.420
Okay, perfect.

03:31:48.300 --> 03:31:48.860
I...

03:31:48.860 --> 03:31:51.100
No, no, no, no, you're gonna...

03:31:51.900 --> 03:31:53.820
Can the game kill itself in lava?

03:31:55.740 --> 03:31:56.220
Hold on.

03:31:57.500 --> 03:31:59.740
I need you to pick up your stuff.

03:31:59.740 --> 03:32:00.620
I'm not even kidding.

03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:01.820
Please, just perish.

03:32:01.820 --> 03:32:03.500
Come on, please, game.

03:32:04.540 --> 03:32:04.940
Wow.

03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:07.980
100 tons of Atlas, I believe it.

03:32:09.100 --> 03:32:10.060
How much health?

03:32:12.380 --> 03:32:13.100
How much heal?

03:32:13.820 --> 03:32:14.300
Like that.

03:32:15.900 --> 03:32:16.380
Like that.

03:32:16.380 --> 03:32:16.780
Right, yeah.

03:32:16.780 --> 03:32:17.580
We're just shotgun.

03:32:17.580 --> 03:32:18.220
You're totally crap.

03:32:18.220 --> 03:32:19.900
The shotgun on the Atlas is something else.

03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:24.620
You know, I didn't even tell my dad I'm playing this game

03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:26.540
because they are probably filming after the stream

03:32:26.540 --> 03:32:27.420
if it's not too late.

03:32:31.980 --> 03:32:32.380
I'll be like,

03:32:32.380 --> 03:32:33.020
stop!

03:32:33.020 --> 03:32:33.980
I think it's an outpost.

03:32:33.980 --> 03:32:35.740
You're right to the outpost comm tower.

03:32:35.740 --> 03:32:36.460
Dust it.

03:32:36.460 --> 03:32:37.820
It'll be kicking me off the PC

03:32:37.820 --> 03:32:39.420
so you can play it, actually, when it gets here.

03:32:39.420 --> 03:32:39.900
But now...

03:32:43.180 --> 03:32:43.900
Come on.

03:32:43.900 --> 03:32:44.540
Stop it.

03:32:44.540 --> 03:32:45.820
There's so many wee ones.

03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:47.820
But their damage adds up.

03:32:47.820 --> 03:32:49.660
Like, that's the problem with it.

03:32:49.660 --> 03:32:50.380
I add up.

03:32:50.380 --> 03:32:51.100
Where's that?

03:32:51.100 --> 03:32:52.220
Oh, my God, I see it.

03:32:52.780 --> 03:32:54.060
No, and it saw me.

03:32:54.060 --> 03:32:54.540
Drap.

03:32:55.900 --> 03:32:56.940
What's going on here?

03:32:56.940 --> 03:32:57.820
I don't...

03:32:57.820 --> 03:33:00.700
Why is there so many health stations?

03:33:02.140 --> 03:33:04.620
Why is there so many health ups?

03:33:05.740 --> 03:33:07.820
There are, like, six around me.

03:33:07.820 --> 03:33:08.300
Hold on.

03:33:08.300 --> 03:33:09.020
How many am I?

03:33:09.020 --> 03:33:09.660
I don't know.

03:33:09.660 --> 03:33:10.220
I don't know.

03:33:10.220 --> 03:33:10.620
I don't know.

03:33:10.620 --> 03:33:11.260
I don't know.

03:33:11.260 --> 03:33:11.980
I don't know.

03:33:12.140 --> 03:33:12.860
How many am I?

03:33:14.460 --> 03:33:15.260
Oh.

03:33:15.260 --> 03:33:16.060
That's why.

03:33:16.060 --> 03:33:17.740
Because there's a new mech coming in the way.

03:33:18.460 --> 03:33:19.260
Where are you?

03:33:22.220 --> 03:33:23.180
I'm using my ultimate.

03:33:23.180 --> 03:33:24.140
Don't worry.

03:33:24.140 --> 03:33:24.460
Ow!

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:28.140
But you're not even on my side of the map.

03:33:28.140 --> 03:33:28.940
Wait.

03:33:28.940 --> 03:33:30.300
Who or what is shooting me?

03:33:30.300 --> 03:33:31.900
There's, like, something tiny shooting me.

03:33:32.700 --> 03:33:33.580
I can hear it!

03:33:35.420 --> 03:33:35.660
Oh.

03:33:37.740 --> 03:33:38.220
Hold on.

03:33:38.780 --> 03:33:39.340
Hold on.

03:33:42.460 --> 03:33:42.940
Hold on.

03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:44.060
Oh, wait.

03:33:44.060 --> 03:33:46.780
That doesn't do anything against the new repellent thing.

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:47.500
I wish we were there.

03:33:49.580 --> 03:33:50.060
What?

03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:52.060
Are we going to do it?

03:33:56.620 --> 03:33:57.420
Oh, my gosh.

03:33:59.420 --> 03:34:01.500
I feel like, because we've got Atlas unlocked,

03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:03.900
we actually might be close to finishing the game.

03:34:03.900 --> 03:34:04.620
Right.

03:34:04.620 --> 03:34:05.340
You!

03:34:05.340 --> 03:34:06.300
Fuck off!

03:34:06.300 --> 03:34:07.100
Holy crap.

03:34:08.620 --> 03:34:09.100
Uh.

03:34:10.220 --> 03:34:10.780
Oh, no.

03:34:11.420 --> 03:34:11.980
Hold on.

03:34:14.060 --> 03:34:15.820
Did I just unlock a memory?

03:34:17.740 --> 03:34:18.460
Uh.

03:34:19.820 --> 03:34:26.300
We may or may not be in for an absolute heck on earth fight coming up.

03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:30.380
With an intense amount of enemies.

03:34:30.380 --> 03:34:31.660
Do you think we can break these doors?

03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:36.780
I just realized I think I remember this map,

03:34:36.780 --> 03:34:38.460
and this might be the second blast.

03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:38.780
Oh, wait.

03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:40.140
There's a control room.

03:34:40.140 --> 03:34:40.620
Sorry.

03:34:41.580 --> 03:34:41.980
There.

03:34:43.900 --> 03:34:45.980
My dad loved playing this.

03:34:45.980 --> 03:34:46.220
Is it?

03:34:46.220 --> 03:34:48.380
If this is the map I think it is,

03:34:48.380 --> 03:34:54.140
we're about to enter, like, an eight mech fight later on down here.

03:34:55.100 --> 03:34:56.940
If this is the map I think it is,

03:34:56.940 --> 03:34:59.020
we're, like, on the second last mission then,

03:34:59.020 --> 03:35:01.260
because that was his favorite one.

03:35:02.140 --> 03:35:03.740
I am getting nervous.

03:35:04.940 --> 03:35:06.140
Have I just remembered?

03:35:06.140 --> 03:35:06.380
Oh, wait.

03:35:06.380 --> 03:35:07.820
There's something I'm to destroy back there.

03:35:07.820 --> 03:35:08.700
My apologies.

03:35:08.700 --> 03:35:09.100
Sorry.

03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:15.420
Oh, no.

03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:17.900
I actually think this may be the second last mission.

03:35:19.820 --> 03:35:21.180
Uh.

03:35:21.180 --> 03:35:21.500
Oh, wait.

03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:21.660
Sorry.

03:35:21.660 --> 03:35:22.620
I wasn't paying attention.

03:35:23.260 --> 03:35:23.660
Sorry.

03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:25.420
Oh, no.

03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:26.220
I think it is.

03:35:26.940 --> 03:35:27.260
No.

03:35:27.260 --> 03:35:27.820
I think it is.

03:35:27.820 --> 03:35:28.620
It's not sorry.

03:35:28.620 --> 03:35:30.060
I think it should be done.

03:35:30.780 --> 03:35:31.660
Am I even going to hit?

03:35:33.020 --> 03:35:33.260
Nah.

03:35:33.260 --> 03:35:34.380
It's going to go out of range, bro.

03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:37.580
Oh, no.

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:41.260
If this is the one I think it is,

03:35:41.260 --> 03:35:43.020
this is going to be a challenge.

03:35:45.660 --> 03:35:47.660
If I was my dad's favorite map,

03:35:47.660 --> 03:35:49.820
so surely that means I can do it.

03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:50.700
My dad's favorite map.

03:35:53.180 --> 03:35:55.100
I've all the standing spirit this time.

03:35:56.540 --> 03:35:56.860
Oh.

03:35:57.900 --> 03:35:59.020
I'm getting ready to get.

03:35:59.020 --> 03:36:00.380
So, of course, it wouldn't do that.

03:36:01.260 --> 03:36:01.740
Oh, no.

03:36:04.860 --> 03:36:05.740
Games hate hate.

03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:09.900
There's a special there.

03:36:11.580 --> 03:36:12.460
I think the enemy.

03:36:16.060 --> 03:36:16.540
Wow.

03:36:18.140 --> 03:36:19.820
You're the only one that can shoot with that.

03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:22.860
Oh, another make another make.

03:36:30.620 --> 03:36:34.700
Oh, that's not.

03:36:34.700 --> 03:36:36.140
I keep using that again.

03:36:36.140 --> 03:36:38.300
But that's actually not what I'm supposed to do.

03:36:38.300 --> 03:36:41.420
See these fucking me bam over the fucking tanks.

03:36:41.420 --> 03:36:41.900
Oh, my God.

03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:42.940
They like come out of nowhere.

03:36:42.940 --> 03:36:44.380
And look at the situation.

03:36:44.380 --> 03:36:45.180
Like I can't even.

03:36:45.900 --> 03:36:49.500
I cannot avoid these attacks unless I get lucky like that.

03:36:55.260 --> 03:36:55.500
Sorry.

03:36:55.500 --> 03:36:56.380
I'm just using shotgun.

03:36:57.900 --> 03:36:59.180
You know, don't hit me.

03:36:59.180 --> 03:36:59.740
Don't hit me.

03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:00.460
That's so rude.

03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.140
Honestly, it is right there.

03:37:05.820 --> 03:37:07.740
Members a smart sooner than expected.

03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:13.260
I mean, if we do it, then yeah, I'll take a cup of tea.

03:37:13.260 --> 03:37:14.780
I'll get some food, actually.

03:37:14.780 --> 03:37:15.500
Because I don't want to eat.

03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:22.060
We got him with their panty loons down.

03:37:22.060 --> 03:37:22.700
That's right.

03:37:25.340 --> 03:37:26.620
Getting that lava.

03:37:26.620 --> 03:37:28.540
I think they can hurt themselves in the lava.

03:37:29.980 --> 03:37:32.780
Unless it's only me because I'm classic video game.

03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:35.580
Oh, that's okay.

03:37:35.580 --> 03:37:36.060
There we go.

03:37:42.780 --> 03:37:45.580
Well, the good news is you're super close to me.

03:37:48.220 --> 03:37:50.460
The bad news is I'm overheating like no one's.

03:37:51.500 --> 03:37:53.420
Oh, they might actually get me.

03:37:53.420 --> 03:37:55.180
But sorry, I need to play safe.

03:37:56.300 --> 03:37:57.100
Oh, for goodness sake.

03:37:57.100 --> 03:38:00.460
He gets so close that I'm like getting cut cut.

03:38:02.140 --> 03:38:04.860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:38:06.860 --> 03:38:07.420
Come on.

03:38:07.420 --> 03:38:08.300
Get that one first.

03:38:08.300 --> 03:38:09.420
Oh, maybe a double kill.

03:38:12.940 --> 03:38:15.500
He got damaged so much from that mech blowing up.

03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:16.300
Feels good, man.

03:38:17.420 --> 03:38:18.380
Feels good, man.

03:38:18.380 --> 03:38:19.580
Feels good, man.

03:38:19.580 --> 03:38:21.020
He got damaged so much.

03:38:23.180 --> 03:38:23.660
Okay.

03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:26.300
Much mutual happy.

03:38:26.300 --> 03:38:28.380
Mutual happy with how that occurred.

03:38:28.380 --> 03:38:29.580
That came out so well.

03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:31.020
Oh, okay.

03:38:31.020 --> 03:38:31.340
Okay.

03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:31.820
Okay.

03:38:31.820 --> 03:38:32.300
You ready?

03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:32.700
You ready?

03:38:38.060 --> 03:38:38.300
How?

03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:43.100
No, you're getting sprayed, bro.

03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:44.700
You're getting sprayed just because of the...

03:38:47.020 --> 03:38:47.420
Okay.

03:38:48.540 --> 03:38:50.460
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

03:38:51.740 --> 03:38:52.700
Good work.

03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:54.060
Let's free those villains.

03:38:54.060 --> 03:38:56.060
Get out of here and find Ragnarok.

03:38:56.300 --> 03:38:57.420
Calm down with you.

03:38:57.420 --> 03:38:58.540
Marked and on radar.

03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:00.860
Okay.

03:39:02.140 --> 03:39:03.820
I think we're doing a good job.

03:39:07.980 --> 03:39:08.300
Wow.

03:39:09.580 --> 03:39:10.780
Good job, man.

03:39:11.900 --> 03:39:17.260
That's always very satisfying getting a double whammy like that.

03:39:17.260 --> 03:39:17.580
Right.

03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:20.460
I'm like getting full up on like all this special stuff.

03:39:21.180 --> 03:39:21.580
Right.

03:39:21.580 --> 03:39:22.780
Full health.

03:39:22.780 --> 03:39:23.900
I'm full on everything.

03:39:24.860 --> 03:39:25.980
You know, I'm not until...

03:39:25.980 --> 03:39:27.340
Wait, I need that one.

03:39:31.820 --> 03:39:32.300
Hold on.

03:39:33.580 --> 03:39:33.900
Sorry.

03:39:33.900 --> 03:39:36.220
A little bit bigger than I anticipated.

03:39:38.780 --> 03:39:43.580
It's too easy for such a gamer pro like me, honestly.

03:39:43.580 --> 03:39:45.020
You can't, you can't hand...

03:39:45.020 --> 03:39:46.620
Oh, I'm full on that.

03:39:46.620 --> 03:39:48.300
Oh, that's the ammo type.

03:39:48.300 --> 03:39:48.940
Sorry.

03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:49.660
Is it this one?

03:39:50.540 --> 03:39:51.580
Am I being a dum-dum?

03:39:52.140 --> 03:40:00.540
Okay, I re-stocked eight more bullets, but that's okay.

03:40:02.140 --> 03:40:03.340
It's the energy coil.

03:40:03.340 --> 03:40:04.300
Is that why they're called?

03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:07.180
Because you guys are such a nerd.

03:40:08.380 --> 03:40:09.340
Oh, sorry.

03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:10.060
This is the one.

03:40:11.580 --> 03:40:12.300
Whoa.

03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:13.260
You survived that?

03:40:13.820 --> 03:40:14.540
I'm surprised.

03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:18.060
Pleasantly surprised.

03:40:18.060 --> 03:40:19.660
Not particularly surprised.

03:40:22.140 --> 03:40:23.020
Wow, I wish that...

03:40:26.700 --> 03:40:28.060
So this is the map I think is.

03:40:28.060 --> 03:40:29.740
I'm nervous for what's up ahead,

03:40:30.300 --> 03:40:32.220
but if it's my dad's favorite map,

03:40:32.220 --> 03:40:34.460
then truly it can't be that bad, right?

03:40:35.340 --> 03:40:37.900
Even though my dad was like pretty much number one on this game.

03:40:37.900 --> 03:40:39.100
Incoming bombers.

03:40:39.100 --> 03:40:39.820
Watch yourself.

03:40:43.900 --> 03:40:44.860
What do they do?

03:40:44.860 --> 03:40:46.780
Oh my god, they're literally fucking...

03:40:46.780 --> 03:40:48.060
What, are they B-52s?

03:40:48.620 --> 03:40:49.340
Jeez.

03:40:49.340 --> 03:40:50.940
You coming back for more or not?

03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:54.300
I hear a chopper now.

03:40:57.340 --> 03:40:58.140
You're a chopper.

03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:00.460
I don't like it.

03:41:00.460 --> 03:41:02.300
I'm gonna do some of these from afar,

03:41:02.300 --> 03:41:04.700
because there's a lot of noise ahead.

03:41:06.300 --> 03:41:07.900
I don't think I'm gonna be doing myself

03:41:07.900 --> 03:41:09.260
any favors just running in.

03:41:11.660 --> 03:41:13.580
I'm gonna break that just in case.

03:41:13.580 --> 03:41:14.380
I'll break this.

03:41:14.380 --> 03:41:15.020
That's fine.

03:41:15.580 --> 03:41:16.140
You're fine.

03:41:16.540 --> 03:41:23.020
I think those are what communicate the hail attack.

03:41:23.020 --> 03:41:24.140
I'm gonna try that.

03:41:26.860 --> 03:41:28.140
Oh wow, hold on.

03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:31.100
Man, I can't destroy everything all at once.

03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:32.300
Give me a second.

03:41:32.300 --> 03:41:33.100
Give me a second.

03:41:34.380 --> 03:41:34.940
Something.

03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:37.580
I think I just hurt myself by accident.

03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:39.260
I'm gonna build in.

03:41:39.260 --> 03:41:39.660
Drat.

03:41:40.940 --> 03:41:41.660
Drat, drat, drat.

03:41:41.660 --> 03:41:42.780
That wasn't part of the plan.

03:41:45.100 --> 03:41:45.580
Oh.

03:41:46.380 --> 03:41:47.660
That hurt infantry.

03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:49.340
Imagine being like, oh yeah,

03:41:49.340 --> 03:41:51.340
by the way, your job is to go against an atlas.

03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:51.980
An atlas?

03:41:51.980 --> 03:41:53.500
Call me a deserter.

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:55.180
Freaking call me, I don't know.

03:41:55.180 --> 03:41:57.500
What's the type of deserter?

03:41:57.500 --> 03:41:57.820
Call me...

03:42:00.140 --> 03:42:02.220
Wait, why can't I think of one deserter right now?

03:42:04.380 --> 03:42:05.900
Call me chocolate pudding,

03:42:05.900 --> 03:42:07.340
because I'm a deserter.

03:42:07.340 --> 03:42:07.980
Get me out of here.

03:42:08.780 --> 03:42:09.900
Sorry, that took me so long.

03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:14.620
I don't know why that was so hard.

03:42:15.740 --> 03:42:17.820
Watch out for what?

03:42:17.820 --> 03:42:19.020
Oh, great.

03:42:19.020 --> 03:42:21.020
I assume there's something special in here.

03:42:22.540 --> 03:42:23.900
If it was behind a wee paywall,

03:42:23.900 --> 03:42:26.380
I'd say that as if it wasn't just literally one thing.

03:42:28.300 --> 03:42:29.500
A strawberry flan.

03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:30.300
Ice cream.

03:42:30.300 --> 03:42:31.020
A flan?

03:42:31.020 --> 03:42:31.420
What's that?

03:42:31.420 --> 03:42:32.380
A flan?

03:42:32.380 --> 03:42:33.260
Pancake or this?

03:42:34.140 --> 03:42:34.940
Oh, sorry, I missed.

03:42:41.340 --> 03:42:42.460
Yeah, that's what you wrote me.

03:42:43.180 --> 03:42:44.620
Imagine surviving that back.

03:42:44.860 --> 03:42:45.340
Cute.

03:42:47.260 --> 03:42:47.820
Yeah, sorry.

03:42:47.820 --> 03:42:49.900
I'm going to take every heal I get,

03:42:49.900 --> 03:42:52.060
because I do not have enough health.

03:42:52.060 --> 03:42:52.300
Ow.

03:42:53.820 --> 03:42:55.100
Are you a deserter?

03:42:55.100 --> 03:42:56.860
Because I terrimis-

03:42:56.860 --> 03:42:57.900
terrimis-

03:42:57.900 --> 03:42:58.540
you!

03:42:58.540 --> 03:42:59.020
Hold on.

03:43:00.300 --> 03:43:00.620
Oh.

03:43:06.060 --> 03:43:07.180
I wonder if that does damage

03:43:07.180 --> 03:43:08.300
if it hits me on the way down.

03:43:11.420 --> 03:43:12.300
For goodness sake.

03:43:15.580 --> 03:43:18.540
These tanks are absolutely calling me.

03:43:19.820 --> 03:43:21.340
Bro, I can't even avoid them.

03:43:22.380 --> 03:43:23.260
Is that geyser?

03:43:23.260 --> 03:43:25.180
Is that water geyser to cool me down?

03:43:26.380 --> 03:43:27.660
I'm not sure how much I cost it.

03:43:27.660 --> 03:43:28.620
I don't want to stand on it

03:43:28.620 --> 03:43:30.460
in case it's just a steam cloud.

03:43:33.420 --> 03:43:33.820
I don't know.

03:43:33.820 --> 03:43:35.020
You seem like water to me.

03:43:35.900 --> 03:43:36.380
Oh, my God.

03:43:36.380 --> 03:43:37.260
Sorry, I'm going to have to swap.

03:43:37.260 --> 03:43:40.860
These guys are not taking the shotgun shells very well.

03:43:45.580 --> 03:43:46.460
That's what I'm talking about.

03:43:48.220 --> 03:43:48.620
Crap.

03:43:49.580 --> 03:43:51.500
I'm taking some HP damage.

03:43:52.540 --> 03:43:53.500
I don't think the game-

03:43:54.140 --> 03:43:55.660
maybe the game does let you go all the way back

03:43:55.660 --> 03:43:57.100
because your instant's in the map.

03:43:57.100 --> 03:43:59.500
Like, it's one big map that's been unlocked.

03:44:02.940 --> 03:44:04.620
Sir, to clear the way for the prisoners,

03:44:04.620 --> 03:44:06.300
the turrets ahead need to be destroyed.

03:44:06.300 --> 03:44:06.860
Yes, sir.

03:44:06.860 --> 03:44:08.940
I've seen so many fixed defenses in one place.

03:44:08.940 --> 03:44:10.140
Are they pointed the wrong way?

03:44:11.660 --> 03:44:13.740
I don't know if they're fighting the wrong way.

03:44:13.820 --> 03:44:15.340
They're seemingly pointed at me.

03:44:17.660 --> 03:44:18.700
Oh, I can see it.

03:44:19.740 --> 03:44:20.860
Okay, we got it.

03:44:20.860 --> 03:44:21.660
Feels good, man.

03:44:21.660 --> 03:44:22.460
Okay, there's a health.

03:44:28.700 --> 03:44:29.740
Okay, I think I can see-

03:44:29.740 --> 03:44:31.900
I was going to say I'm pretty sure that can see me.

03:44:31.900 --> 03:44:32.380
Oh, no.

03:44:33.740 --> 03:44:34.380
Thank you.

03:44:34.380 --> 03:44:35.660
And another one.

03:44:35.660 --> 03:44:36.300
Thank you.

03:44:38.780 --> 03:44:40.700
Mech warrior, you should be able to see the camp

03:44:40.700 --> 03:44:41.500
from where you are.

03:44:41.500 --> 03:44:41.900
Yeah?

03:44:41.900 --> 03:44:43.420
Sir, looks like a very light,

03:44:44.220 --> 03:44:44.940
should be cake.

03:44:46.540 --> 03:44:49.340
No, that is bait, if I've ever seen it.

03:44:51.660 --> 03:44:53.500
I do not trust that at all.

03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:55.100
There is one more thing over there.

03:44:57.340 --> 03:44:59.500
Yep, there's another, another thing over there.

03:44:59.500 --> 03:45:00.860
Wait, so what's that supposed to-

03:45:02.220 --> 03:45:02.860
I can like-

03:45:03.820 --> 03:45:05.980
Am I supposed to go all the way in a circle?

03:45:05.980 --> 03:45:06.700
Like, around?

03:45:09.660 --> 03:45:10.780
Please don't worry if you're-

03:45:10.780 --> 03:45:12.380
Like, I cannot see what you're shooting at.

03:45:12.380 --> 03:45:14.220
I promise you, I can hardly see either.

03:45:14.220 --> 03:45:15.580
The crosshair is going red,

03:45:15.580 --> 03:45:17.580
which means the AI is locked on,

03:45:17.580 --> 03:45:18.380
so I'm just-

03:45:19.340 --> 03:45:22.220
I am just taking it as it comey come comes.

03:45:23.100 --> 03:45:24.780
Yeah, it's literally a trap.

03:45:24.780 --> 03:45:25.420
I'm sorry, but-

03:45:26.300 --> 03:45:27.740
There's only a light thing.

03:45:27.740 --> 03:45:28.780
Yeah, I don't believe it.

03:45:32.380 --> 03:45:34.220
Oh, I thought I should be able-

03:45:39.180 --> 03:45:40.780
Take it easy, easy.

03:45:42.620 --> 03:45:43.100
I'm even-

03:45:45.580 --> 03:45:46.220
Yeah.

03:45:46.220 --> 03:45:47.340
Okay, we made it down.

03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:50.860
Nice and safe, nice and friendly.

03:45:50.860 --> 03:45:52.540
There's no more turrets coming at us.

03:45:53.900 --> 03:45:55.660
Um, we'll maybe take a few-

03:45:55.660 --> 03:45:57.180
Oh, of course.

03:45:57.180 --> 03:45:59.900
Oh, of course the HUD was telling us the truth.

03:45:59.900 --> 03:46:02.060
Open the gates and defend the civilians.

03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:02.620
Oh, yes.

03:46:05.180 --> 03:46:06.460
I look very much like you.

03:46:10.060 --> 03:46:11.900
I'm to defend civilians.

03:46:12.860 --> 03:46:14.460
Why did that give me three?

03:46:16.060 --> 03:46:16.540
Fuck.

03:46:18.140 --> 03:46:19.420
Why did that give me three?

03:46:24.460 --> 03:46:24.960
Oh.

03:46:26.460 --> 03:46:26.960
Oh.

03:46:35.180 --> 03:46:36.460
Atlas, okay.

03:46:36.460 --> 03:46:37.500
Okay, where?

03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:37.980
Where?

03:46:37.980 --> 03:46:38.300
Where?

03:46:38.300 --> 03:46:39.900
Right side, right side, right side on the HUD.

03:46:40.860 --> 03:46:42.860
Scream down, scream down.

03:46:42.860 --> 03:46:44.140
I have heavy ammo.

03:46:49.180 --> 03:46:50.620
It's fine, it's fine.

03:46:50.620 --> 03:46:54.060
We are over-keying, but we're just going to keep on at it.

03:46:55.740 --> 03:46:57.100
Okay, we're just going to keep on at it.

03:46:58.300 --> 03:47:00.300
Why is that Atlas got special moveset?

03:47:02.780 --> 03:47:03.740
Okay, okay.

03:47:05.180 --> 03:47:05.820
Cool down.

03:47:07.100 --> 03:47:07.740
Cool down.

03:47:07.740 --> 03:47:08.220
Let this-

03:47:08.220 --> 03:47:09.500
Let this Atlas cool down.

03:47:10.460 --> 03:47:11.340
We're going to go next.

03:47:12.060 --> 03:47:13.020
We're going to pick up the health.

03:47:13.020 --> 03:47:14.060
We're full health again.

03:47:15.500 --> 03:47:16.780
Sir, watch yourself.

03:47:16.780 --> 03:47:19.180
The drop ship's returning and it's hot-dropping another mech.

03:47:20.220 --> 03:47:20.860
Uh-huh.

03:47:20.860 --> 03:47:23.260
Please be another Atlas, because I can handle an Atlas.

03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:27.580
I think it's a Ragnarok, considering how long this cutscene is going for.

03:47:29.180 --> 03:47:29.500
No.

03:47:30.140 --> 03:47:31.980
It's too Atlas-y!

03:47:31.980 --> 03:47:36.620
Oh my god, when two Atlas do together, they become Atlas-y, like, uh, stuff.

03:47:36.620 --> 03:47:39.100
Oh, oh lord, I do not like this.

03:47:40.780 --> 03:47:42.460
And there's so many bunkers in my way.

03:47:42.460 --> 03:47:44.220
Okay, that's why they gave me two health.

03:47:44.220 --> 03:47:48.060
I'm going to slowly worm my way back to the two health bits,

03:47:49.180 --> 03:47:50.780
as I destroy all the buildings in the way.

03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:51.500
Sorry, my bad.

03:47:52.140 --> 03:47:53.500
My bad, I'm just healing.

03:47:53.500 --> 03:47:55.500
Okay, there are two health to my left now.

03:47:55.500 --> 03:47:56.300
I feel okay.

03:47:57.100 --> 03:47:59.900
I feel like we're melting this guy pretty adequately.

03:47:59.900 --> 03:48:00.940
He is getting low.

03:48:01.980 --> 03:48:05.180
And maybe we can get a double kill if he goes down and hurts him.

03:48:05.740 --> 03:48:06.780
Oh, come on, hurt him.

03:48:07.740 --> 03:48:10.300
Oh, shit, I did not need to take that one.

03:48:11.020 --> 03:48:11.500
Okay.

03:48:12.860 --> 03:48:15.100
Did he take any damage for that?

03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:16.380
Oh, I don't think so.

03:48:16.940 --> 03:48:18.620
Okay, we can't shoot each other over the wall.

03:48:20.700 --> 03:48:22.620
He's, you're not shooting this.

03:48:22.620 --> 03:48:23.820
Okay, now you are.

03:48:23.820 --> 03:48:26.780
So, I can't shoot over the wall, but he can shoot over the wall.

03:48:26.780 --> 03:48:27.740
Yeah, sounds a bit rude.

03:48:28.620 --> 03:48:29.580
Have I got any extra?

03:48:29.580 --> 03:48:31.260
No, I accidentally picked up both of them.

03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:33.260
Oh.

03:48:33.660 --> 03:48:39.660
Oh, he's limping.

03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:40.860
Oh, I'm gone.

03:48:46.860 --> 03:48:48.140
Look at the goods, though.

03:48:50.140 --> 03:48:51.660
Look at the goods, though.

03:48:54.220 --> 03:48:56.940
Eh, look at the goods, though, that drop from atlases.

03:48:57.900 --> 03:48:58.780
Or atlasi.

03:48:59.500 --> 03:49:00.700
Any atlasi, enjoy.

03:49:02.140 --> 03:49:02.700
Hey, back.

03:49:03.660 --> 03:49:05.660
A high-ranking, oh, sorry.

03:49:06.860 --> 03:49:07.740
Prevent escape.

03:49:11.980 --> 03:49:12.940
I think we're doing it.

03:49:17.500 --> 03:49:19.660
Did I win the e-mech fight without realizing?

03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:24.060
When you two atlasi come together to make a baby atlas.

03:49:25.020 --> 03:49:27.500
Does this count now as three or is it more like a wasting?

03:49:27.500 --> 03:49:28.380
I have no idea.

03:49:29.100 --> 03:49:30.940
It was the repair yard.

03:49:30.940 --> 03:49:32.140
We're on payback.

03:49:32.220 --> 03:49:33.900
What's payback?

03:49:33.900 --> 03:49:36.860
Is it like, this isn't the last mission.

03:49:36.860 --> 03:49:38.860
I remember the look of the last mission.

03:49:39.500 --> 03:49:41.900
Shawnee, they sat with extreme prejudice.

03:49:41.900 --> 03:49:43.260
You know what you must do.

03:49:47.180 --> 03:49:49.180
Random questions, you still want to hold it?

03:49:49.180 --> 03:49:50.060
Naturally.

03:49:50.060 --> 03:49:52.140
I can't believe that freaking got 50k views.

03:49:52.140 --> 03:49:52.780
That's insane.

03:49:54.380 --> 03:49:55.820
Honestly, I didn't expect that.

03:49:57.020 --> 03:49:59.660
Shawnee taking on eight guys without breaking a sweat.

03:49:59.660 --> 03:50:01.820
All I'm seeing is that recording booth.

03:50:02.620 --> 03:50:03.980
The ASMR booth, sorry.

03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:09.660
Payback, a high-ranking war of battlefields.

03:50:17.020 --> 03:50:19.180
And one of the vehicles in the convoy.

03:50:20.540 --> 03:50:22.860
Okay, this might require a few attempts.

03:50:22.860 --> 03:50:26.940
I don't recall that magma gonna break and hurt me.

03:50:32.780 --> 03:50:34.460
Don't be distracted.

03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:35.580
Only one thing matters.

03:50:36.380 --> 03:50:37.340
Watch school for it.

03:50:42.860 --> 03:50:45.020
This convoy, this entire convoy.

03:50:46.140 --> 03:50:48.300
Wait, I don't have enough HP for this.

03:50:50.220 --> 03:50:51.180
Am I being silly?

03:50:54.620 --> 03:50:55.500
Am I being silly?

03:50:55.500 --> 03:50:56.060
Am I being silly?

03:50:57.340 --> 03:50:59.820
Now you can have it up to you to fly into the lava.

03:50:59.820 --> 03:51:00.700
That would be great.

03:51:00.780 --> 03:51:03.340
They're all in catapult heavy mags.

03:51:03.340 --> 03:51:04.860
To be sure you get the second to command,

03:51:04.860 --> 03:51:06.380
you'll need to knock them all out.

03:51:06.380 --> 03:51:07.980
Okay, so I'm to kill them.

03:51:09.740 --> 03:51:10.780
First mag down.

03:51:11.900 --> 03:51:14.460
Take up his health and then spray spray.

03:51:16.860 --> 03:51:17.900
Uh, sure.

03:51:19.980 --> 03:51:21.260
That's not even locking on.

03:51:21.900 --> 03:51:24.060
Wait, I'm getting a blary is...

03:51:25.740 --> 03:51:26.380
Hold on.

03:51:26.380 --> 03:51:27.820
What are the tactics for this?

03:51:28.780 --> 03:51:30.060
Is there tactics?

03:51:30.060 --> 03:51:31.420
Is there really healing up here?

03:51:33.180 --> 03:51:33.500
Huh?

03:51:36.780 --> 03:51:37.740
I basically...

03:51:37.740 --> 03:51:38.540
Well, I need to...

03:51:38.540 --> 03:51:39.420
Oh, wow.

03:51:39.420 --> 03:51:39.980
Holy crap.

03:51:39.980 --> 03:51:42.300
The AI is, like, ready to lock on.

03:51:43.660 --> 03:51:44.140
Oh, dear.

03:51:44.140 --> 03:51:45.500
I think we're gonna need a strategy.

03:51:49.260 --> 03:51:49.580
Oh!

03:51:53.420 --> 03:51:55.100
I think this might be the strategy.

03:51:58.780 --> 03:52:00.300
Uh...

03:52:00.300 --> 03:52:00.780
Oh, yeah.

03:52:04.620 --> 03:52:04.940
Okay.

03:52:06.140 --> 03:52:06.860
We've got one.

03:52:08.460 --> 03:52:09.740
Oh, there's health down there.

03:52:10.780 --> 03:52:12.220
I don't want to get too greedy now.

03:52:13.340 --> 03:52:14.460
I can let them pass.

03:52:14.460 --> 03:52:14.780
Oh!

03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:18.060
Did we do it?

03:52:18.940 --> 03:52:20.060
By accident?

03:52:20.060 --> 03:52:21.100
I think we did.

03:52:21.100 --> 03:52:22.780
Okay, let's go get some health.

03:52:22.780 --> 03:52:24.700
I think that would be the way to move right now

03:52:24.700 --> 03:52:26.300
is to grab all these boobies.

03:52:27.820 --> 03:52:29.980
Thank goodness I stopped, like, try hard on the target.

03:52:29.980 --> 03:52:31.180
Right, let's catch up a bit.

03:52:31.180 --> 03:52:32.220
He's a wee bit ahead.

03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:40.860
Sir, the word of Blake is in full retreat.

03:52:40.860 --> 03:52:43.260
Like amateurs, they've probably left something useful.

03:52:43.980 --> 03:52:44.220
Yeah.

03:52:45.260 --> 03:52:45.660
Oh, yeah.

03:52:47.180 --> 03:52:47.660
Hold on.

03:52:51.980 --> 03:52:53.180
Is this fine?

03:52:53.180 --> 03:52:53.820
Yeah, okay.

03:52:53.820 --> 03:52:56.220
They do not have much health against an atlas like this.

03:52:57.820 --> 03:52:59.260
Bro, just accept it.

03:52:59.260 --> 03:53:00.140
You're getting wrecked.

03:53:02.140 --> 03:53:03.580
Oh, there's something going for me at the left.

03:53:03.580 --> 03:53:04.300
I don't know what it is.

03:53:04.300 --> 03:53:05.100
It's not amazing.

03:53:08.860 --> 03:53:11.420
Sirs, I'm reading multiple signatures.

03:53:11.420 --> 03:53:13.740
It looks like another convoy.

03:53:13.740 --> 03:53:14.300
Oh.

03:53:14.300 --> 03:53:16.700
Foster, when you looked at the sensors the first time,

03:53:16.700 --> 03:53:19.580
you missed a group of massive walking tanks.

03:53:20.860 --> 03:53:22.540
Get a move on and stop that other group.

03:53:22.540 --> 03:53:24.940
I love how cheeky they are to each other.

03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:27.500
You missed a group of walking tanks?

03:53:27.820 --> 03:53:29.900
I mean, honestly, she's pretty justified

03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:31.020
for saying it like that.

03:53:31.020 --> 03:53:33.580
Like, what do you mean you missed a group?

03:53:33.580 --> 03:53:34.540
One of those mechs.

03:53:34.540 --> 03:53:35.340
Keep after them, sir.

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:35.580
What?

03:53:35.580 --> 03:53:36.620
There's so many enemies.

03:53:37.900 --> 03:53:39.500
Is there supplies up here?

03:53:39.500 --> 03:53:40.060
Is that why?

03:53:41.180 --> 03:53:42.620
I think there may be supplies.

03:53:42.620 --> 03:53:43.420
Let's see if we can get them.

03:53:46.540 --> 03:53:48.620
Oh, of course they take these pretty much.

03:53:49.420 --> 03:53:51.260
They're silly of me to assume other guys.

03:53:52.460 --> 03:53:53.100
Okay, boom.

03:53:54.380 --> 03:53:57.020
And then let's find all the good things in here.

03:53:58.780 --> 03:53:59.580
Quite a few.

03:54:04.540 --> 03:54:06.460
You, actually, I don't use rockets.

03:54:10.220 --> 03:54:11.340
I think we're doing it.

03:54:11.340 --> 03:54:15.740
I don't want to drink it, but I think we're doing it.

03:54:18.300 --> 03:54:19.580
Okay, we've got full health.

03:54:21.260 --> 03:54:23.100
That's B. Your target?

03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:24.220
This is tamed.

03:54:24.220 --> 03:54:25.500
You stop that right now.

03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:26.140
You stop that.

03:54:26.140 --> 03:54:26.940
You're trolling me.

03:54:27.020 --> 03:54:27.820
It's not tamed.

03:54:27.820 --> 03:54:29.020
Don't say such horrible things.

03:54:30.380 --> 03:54:30.700
Oh, wait.

03:54:30.700 --> 03:54:32.140
It must be supposed to be up or down right now.

03:54:32.140 --> 03:54:32.620
I don't know.

03:54:32.620 --> 03:54:33.100
Oh, fuck it.

03:54:33.100 --> 03:54:33.820
It says go this way.

03:54:33.820 --> 03:54:34.460
I'm going this way.

03:54:35.740 --> 03:54:36.700
They're getting away.

03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:37.500
Stop!

03:54:37.500 --> 03:54:37.980
Stop!

03:54:37.980 --> 03:54:39.020
You're scaring me.

03:54:39.020 --> 03:54:39.820
I'm in an atlas.

03:54:39.820 --> 03:54:40.380
I'm so slow.

03:54:40.380 --> 03:54:41.820
I can't even fly.

03:54:41.820 --> 03:54:44.060
No, it's another get the convoy for the getaway mission.

03:54:44.060 --> 03:54:44.380
Drat!

03:54:44.940 --> 03:54:45.180
Right.

03:54:45.180 --> 03:54:46.780
At least we know to destroy the bridge.

03:54:47.420 --> 03:54:49.580
And then I'll pick up whatever they drop.

03:54:50.700 --> 03:54:51.900
Okay, there is a fight.

03:54:51.900 --> 03:54:52.780
That's what I want to hear.

03:54:52.780 --> 03:54:54.140
That's exactly what I want to hear.

03:54:55.180 --> 03:54:56.460
I actually want a fight

03:54:56.460 --> 03:54:58.300
because I need my stuff a little bit.

03:54:59.740 --> 03:55:00.140
Okay.

03:55:00.780 --> 03:55:01.260
Okay.

03:55:02.540 --> 03:55:03.500
You're flying.

03:55:03.500 --> 03:55:05.100
You're flying.

03:55:05.100 --> 03:55:05.900
You're flying.

03:55:07.500 --> 03:55:08.300
You're flying.

03:55:15.180 --> 03:55:16.380
You get too close,

03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:18.060
but I want to pick up the kiddies.

03:55:19.980 --> 03:55:21.420
Okay, then we go next.

03:55:22.380 --> 03:55:23.500
Next convoy.

03:55:23.500 --> 03:55:24.460
Are they up there?

03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:25.820
Oh, please tell me they're not up there.

03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:28.380
Why would you do something to me like this?

03:55:28.380 --> 03:55:29.500
How am I supposed to get off?

03:55:29.500 --> 03:55:30.220
I'm not going back.

03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:35.900
I haven't even unlocked Wild Card and Bind and Avis.

03:55:35.900 --> 03:55:37.260
Like I'm like 99% sure

03:55:37.260 --> 03:55:39.420
because I've never had, came across one yet.

03:55:39.420 --> 03:55:41.020
I'll show you what my save file looks like

03:55:41.020 --> 03:55:41.900
in the Bind and Avis.

03:55:44.060 --> 03:55:45.820
You guys can be the judge.

03:55:46.780 --> 03:55:47.820
That's why in November,

03:55:47.820 --> 03:55:49.020
you guys are actually going to help me

03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:50.060
fill the unlocks I need.

03:55:50.620 --> 03:55:53.420
I think we might do one Eden run

03:55:53.420 --> 03:55:55.180
on the Bind and Avis stream.

03:55:55.180 --> 03:55:57.500
And then I want to play Lilith's read mode.

03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:01.020
Some people absolutely despise read mode.

03:56:01.020 --> 03:56:02.620
I actually quite like it.

03:56:03.420 --> 03:56:05.180
I find it quite fun,

03:56:05.180 --> 03:56:07.580
but only if it goes well, obviously.

03:56:07.740 --> 03:56:11.500
Mercenaries, you will force me to abandon this world

03:56:11.500 --> 03:56:13.020
and all it hides.

03:56:13.020 --> 03:56:15.420
For that, you will face death.

03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:19.180
Foster, can the Icarus get us off this rock yet?

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:19.820
No, sir.

03:56:19.820 --> 03:56:21.260
Just local hops.

03:56:21.260 --> 03:56:23.020
Captain, return to the Icarus.

03:56:23.020 --> 03:56:23.420
We're going to-

03:56:23.420 --> 03:56:23.900
Was this?

03:56:23.900 --> 03:56:25.260
Oh, I almost lost.

03:56:25.260 --> 03:56:26.380
This is the end of the map.

03:56:26.380 --> 03:56:27.100
Holy crap.

03:56:27.100 --> 03:56:27.660
Oh, my God.

03:56:29.500 --> 03:56:29.980
Whoops.

03:56:31.500 --> 03:56:33.420
I honestly don't mind read mode.

03:56:33.420 --> 03:56:35.980
Who despised read mode is really hard.

03:56:36.060 --> 03:56:38.540
Begin our best interest to capture whatever lost technology

03:56:38.540 --> 03:56:40.140
is being evacuated with him.

03:56:40.140 --> 03:56:41.660
Assault space port.

03:56:41.660 --> 03:56:42.860
Someone has to go into a heavily guarded space port,

03:56:42.860 --> 03:56:44.140
blow the Blake drop ship,

03:56:44.140 --> 03:56:46.140
and kill or strand straighter.

03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:47.580
Guess who gets the job?

03:56:47.580 --> 03:56:48.300
Not it.

03:56:48.300 --> 03:56:49.980
Right, you are a briefing boy.

03:56:49.980 --> 03:56:51.260
Good luck, Captain.

03:56:51.260 --> 03:56:52.620
Foster, your job.

03:56:52.620 --> 03:56:54.300
You need to get the drop ship fixed

03:56:54.300 --> 03:56:56.940
so we can get off this planet and enjoy our R&R,

03:56:56.940 --> 03:56:58.780
after our esteemed captain gets done.

03:56:58.780 --> 03:56:59.980
That has like a billion enemies in it.

03:56:59.980 --> 03:57:01.500
As soon as you unlock the Atlas, Lilith,

03:57:01.500 --> 03:57:04.140
it's not too, it's not too tricky.

03:57:04.140 --> 03:57:05.020
Two more missions.

03:57:06.140 --> 03:57:06.620
Oh, my God.

03:57:06.620 --> 03:57:07.980
We're beating the game journalist.

03:57:11.660 --> 03:57:13.020
We're beating the game journalist.

03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:13.420
Let's go.

03:57:15.980 --> 03:57:17.420
Is the game sent me the wrong way?

03:57:18.620 --> 03:57:19.100
No.

03:57:19.100 --> 03:57:19.900
I'm being pranked.

03:57:21.340 --> 03:57:21.740
Clearly.

03:57:26.380 --> 03:57:27.740
You're blowing it right now.

03:57:27.740 --> 03:57:29.580
Can I get across this one first, please?

03:57:34.460 --> 03:57:35.340
Okay, now.

03:57:36.140 --> 03:57:37.740
I saw my life flash before my eyes.

03:57:42.380 --> 03:57:42.940
Oh, my God.

03:57:45.020 --> 03:57:46.540
Is this another timed mission?

03:57:46.540 --> 03:57:47.100
Yes or no?

03:57:48.060 --> 03:57:49.500
That would have time to be fucking around

03:57:49.500 --> 03:57:50.460
and destroying stuff.

03:57:51.820 --> 03:57:52.940
Oh, they have full health.

03:57:53.580 --> 03:57:55.100
Man, this game is short.

03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.020
Older games tend to be like that,

03:57:57.020 --> 03:57:58.780
although I think Conker's Bad Party

03:57:58.780 --> 03:58:01.340
is the only game that was like old AF,

03:58:01.340 --> 03:58:03.260
and it was like took so long to do.

03:58:03.260 --> 03:58:05.020
I mean, I've never completed it.

03:58:05.020 --> 03:58:06.780
I used to play the same mission as a child

03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:08.620
and then get stuck at the exact same spot,

03:58:08.620 --> 03:58:11.340
which honestly, that game was wildly inappropriate for me,

03:58:11.340 --> 03:58:13.340
inappropriate for me to be playing as a child,

03:58:13.340 --> 03:58:16.780
but hey, it gave me a personality,

03:58:16.780 --> 03:58:20.060
so I can't actually say anything bad against it.

03:58:22.460 --> 03:58:24.380
I'd actually be so boring if I didn't game.

03:58:25.020 --> 03:58:27.740
I don't even think I would have anything to say to them.

03:58:27.740 --> 03:58:30.780
I'd probably be like a mukbang type of person

03:58:32.940 --> 03:58:34.460
and just watch people eat food all day.

03:58:34.460 --> 03:58:37.820
I'd be like, oh yeah, this is time for it again.

03:58:41.820 --> 03:58:43.420
You're so in my face.

03:58:47.500 --> 03:58:51.500
No, no, okay, let's go again.

03:58:52.940 --> 03:58:55.580
Oh, okay, let's go again.

03:58:55.580 --> 03:58:56.940
Again, again, again, again, again, again.

03:58:56.940 --> 03:58:59.260
That was my humble mistake.

03:58:59.260 --> 03:59:00.700
That was my humble mistake.

03:59:00.700 --> 03:59:01.820
I do apologize.

03:59:02.380 --> 03:59:04.540
Literally went for a cheeky dip in the thing.

03:59:06.380 --> 03:59:09.260
The only thing that can kill me is myself.

03:59:09.260 --> 03:59:10.700
I am back to the video game.

03:59:11.580 --> 03:59:13.580
Okay, I need to sprint across the bridge

03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:15.180
because they're going to blow it up.

03:59:15.180 --> 03:59:17.100
I cannot believe I just did that.

03:59:17.100 --> 03:59:19.260
Into the flaming hot Cheetos.

03:59:19.260 --> 03:59:20.780
Literally, what an air.

03:59:22.620 --> 03:59:25.820
I can't believe I successfully managed that as hilarious.

03:59:27.820 --> 03:59:29.100
I'm so energy-honored.

03:59:29.820 --> 03:59:33.340
I don't know how I'm not in some e-sports team.

03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:33.820
Is that good?

03:59:35.340 --> 03:59:37.180
Not only am I terrible at the game.

03:59:41.340 --> 03:59:42.220
Let's try that again.

03:59:42.780 --> 03:59:44.860
This time, no perish.

03:59:46.540 --> 03:59:47.180
I'm pretty cheeky.

03:59:47.180 --> 03:59:49.260
Speaking, talking about hot sprang.

03:59:51.020 --> 03:59:52.620
Yeah, Conqueror's had Inuit on it.

03:59:52.620 --> 03:59:56.780
I, the childhood memory for me playing Conqueror's Bad Friday

03:59:56.780 --> 03:59:58.620
is bouncing on that sunflowers.

03:59:59.500 --> 04:00:00.300
Nothing else.

04:00:00.300 --> 04:00:02.860
I used to do it for minutes at a time.

04:00:02.860 --> 04:00:05.340
And then whenever I could hear my mom or dad come into the room,

04:00:05.340 --> 04:00:09.020
I'd get off them because I'd be scared they'd be mad at me.

04:00:09.020 --> 04:00:11.020
And they'd be like, what are you doing, strongy?

04:00:16.140 --> 04:00:17.180
Right, do not fall.

04:00:17.180 --> 04:00:18.380
Whoa, you idle.

04:00:19.740 --> 04:00:21.020
They had a funny little ha-ha.

04:00:25.020 --> 04:00:25.660
Oh, jeez.

04:00:26.220 --> 04:00:28.220
Everything's got an HP up there.

04:00:30.300 --> 04:00:32.220
You're not actually supposed to get stronger.

04:00:32.220 --> 04:00:33.180
You should get weaker.

04:00:35.980 --> 04:00:38.060
Right, do not fall off the map with time.

04:00:38.060 --> 04:00:40.540
Even if the mix gets all the way in my face.

04:00:42.380 --> 04:00:45.020
Oh my god, it's so fast compared to me.

04:00:45.020 --> 04:00:47.740
I think, oh my god, such a fast mix.

04:00:47.740 --> 04:00:48.380
Please stop.

04:00:49.020 --> 04:00:49.900
Please, I beg you.

04:00:50.540 --> 04:00:51.180
Give me a gun.

04:00:54.140 --> 04:00:55.980
Yeah, I don't think going invisible at this stage

04:00:55.980 --> 04:00:57.500
won't do anything for you, buddy.

04:00:57.500 --> 04:00:59.260
Please do not drop your guns on them.

04:01:01.980 --> 04:01:03.340
Is there anything else here?

04:01:03.340 --> 04:01:04.540
Or is this just like a...

04:01:08.540 --> 04:01:10.380
I am the great mate even.

04:01:12.860 --> 04:01:13.980
Oh, is this a dead end?

04:01:13.980 --> 04:01:15.420
OK, so I have to go that way.

04:01:15.420 --> 04:01:17.340
Maybe we can get a few licks in though.

04:01:17.340 --> 04:01:17.980
Yeah, we can.

04:01:18.940 --> 04:01:19.820
Look at that.

04:01:19.820 --> 04:01:20.540
That was a good lick.

04:01:21.980 --> 04:01:23.020
That was a good lick.

04:01:23.020 --> 04:01:24.300
Something, something red there.

04:01:24.300 --> 04:01:24.780
Let's get it.

04:01:26.780 --> 04:01:28.220
I love doing stuff from a distance.

04:01:29.580 --> 04:01:30.940
I'd save some of our HP.

04:01:32.140 --> 04:01:33.900
I hate the Dracula.

04:01:34.780 --> 04:01:36.940
I never got to that stage as a child.

04:01:36.940 --> 04:01:38.540
I unlocked the Sunflower,

04:01:38.540 --> 04:01:40.540
and then I think after that I was just like,

04:01:40.540 --> 04:01:42.460
I couldn't progress because I didn't know what was going on.

04:01:43.980 --> 04:01:45.260
OK, there's a lava flume.

04:01:45.820 --> 04:01:47.500
I guess I will love it.

04:01:48.140 --> 04:01:50.140
I will allow a lava flume.

04:01:50.140 --> 04:01:50.780
Just one, though.

04:01:51.580 --> 04:01:54.700
There shall be no other lava flumming near me.

04:01:54.700 --> 04:01:55.260
Oh, OK.

04:01:55.260 --> 04:01:56.540
Well, that's illegal to do that.

04:01:59.020 --> 04:02:00.460
Am I to destroy this?

04:02:00.460 --> 04:02:02.220
Gain access to the spaceport.

04:02:03.900 --> 04:02:04.460
OK, is it?

04:02:05.980 --> 04:02:06.860
Aren't you at me?

04:02:09.420 --> 04:02:09.980
Space...

04:02:10.700 --> 04:02:11.260
Space...

04:02:11.260 --> 04:02:13.020
I want to do a cheeky U-turn.

04:02:14.780 --> 04:02:15.820
Cheeky U-turn moment.

04:02:18.540 --> 04:02:19.100
Nah.

04:02:19.100 --> 04:02:20.700
I hate when they get a lick on me when I'm...

04:02:23.340 --> 04:02:24.620
The 80s, what do you mean?

04:02:25.740 --> 04:02:27.820
Way too distracted by Sunflower Booba.

04:02:27.820 --> 04:02:30.700
I did the pitchfork in Bunker's...

04:02:30.700 --> 04:02:32.060
Bunker's Kites for...

04:02:33.100 --> 04:02:34.780
Conqueror's Bad Ferdy.

04:02:34.780 --> 04:02:37.180
I did the pitchfork inside the hay bale.

04:02:38.060 --> 04:02:40.860
I did the Booba Sunflower,

04:02:40.860 --> 04:02:42.620
and then after that I just kinda...

04:02:42.620 --> 04:02:43.660
Like, I did the wasp.

04:02:45.260 --> 04:02:46.220
I did the bull,

04:02:46.220 --> 04:02:47.260
and then after the bull,

04:02:47.260 --> 04:02:48.620
I think I got stuck in the bale.

04:02:48.620 --> 04:02:49.900
I actually don't know how to progress,

04:02:49.900 --> 04:02:51.180
so you guys don't have to hold my hand

04:02:51.180 --> 04:02:52.780
when we get that game shot.

04:02:53.500 --> 04:02:55.420
I don't know if we can get achievements for it,

04:02:55.420 --> 04:02:56.940
because it's on rare replay,

04:02:57.820 --> 04:03:00.540
but I don't know how the achievements work in that game.

04:03:01.340 --> 04:03:05.500
Obviously, this is made before achievements really were a thing.

04:03:07.020 --> 04:03:07.980
Entertuality.

04:03:08.540 --> 04:03:09.020
Hold on.

04:03:10.940 --> 04:03:12.940
I'm trying to, like, rotate between both...

04:03:13.820 --> 04:03:14.320
Eh.

04:03:15.660 --> 04:03:18.060
The missiles and the shotgun.

04:03:18.060 --> 04:03:19.580
It seems to be very efficient,

04:03:19.580 --> 04:03:20.700
which I'm quite happy with.

04:03:25.260 --> 04:03:25.760
Take...

04:03:27.820 --> 04:03:28.320
Woah!

04:03:29.100 --> 04:03:30.220
Those are low keys!

04:03:31.100 --> 04:03:32.620
They're so fucking skinny!

04:03:33.660 --> 04:03:35.740
And, oh god, they have such high mobility.

04:03:35.740 --> 04:03:37.260
This shouldn't be awful.

04:03:37.260 --> 04:03:38.380
But they have low health.

04:03:38.380 --> 04:03:39.340
That's my benefit.

04:03:39.340 --> 04:03:40.060
They have low health.

04:03:43.900 --> 04:03:45.580
I love when they just take it,

04:03:45.580 --> 04:03:46.860
like a good little mech.

04:03:46.860 --> 04:03:48.300
Honestly, you're such a good mech.

04:03:51.020 --> 04:03:52.700
They double killed each other!

04:03:54.540 --> 04:03:55.500
Oh my god.

04:03:55.500 --> 04:03:57.020
I love when they take it, sorry,

04:03:57.020 --> 04:03:58.860
but, like, literally,

04:03:58.860 --> 04:04:00.220
this is the best feeling ever.

04:04:05.020 --> 04:04:05.900
Two for one.

04:04:05.900 --> 04:04:07.660
Yeah, their HP is literally so low.

04:04:13.020 --> 04:04:14.300
Okay, blow up the tunnel.

04:04:14.300 --> 04:04:15.100
Got it.

04:04:15.100 --> 04:04:15.740
Or the bridge.

04:04:15.740 --> 04:04:16.460
I don't know what one.

04:04:17.740 --> 04:04:18.380
Then the bridge?

04:04:21.100 --> 04:04:22.140
I just waste this one.

04:04:22.140 --> 04:04:23.660
I know it doesn't do as much damage,

04:04:23.660 --> 04:04:24.540
but I don't want to, like,

04:04:25.900 --> 04:04:27.580
waste my good ammo on it.

04:04:33.180 --> 04:04:34.460
If you like more old games,

04:04:34.460 --> 04:04:35.180
and then good game,

04:04:35.980 --> 04:04:36.860
good old games,

04:04:36.860 --> 04:04:37.580
it's, like, for steam,

04:04:37.580 --> 04:04:38.940
but some obscure stuff.

04:04:38.940 --> 04:04:39.580
Mmm.

04:04:39.580 --> 04:04:41.500
Their problem is I can only play games

04:04:41.500 --> 04:04:43.260
that I've had experience before,

04:04:43.260 --> 04:04:44.220
or seen be played,

04:04:45.740 --> 04:04:47.660
which is why I play games like Mech Assault,

04:04:47.660 --> 04:04:48.940
because I've seen my dad play it

04:04:48.940 --> 04:04:50.460
like a million times over.

04:04:52.460 --> 04:04:53.420
Oh, there's health there.

04:04:55.500 --> 04:04:57.420
Oh, and there's a helicopter coming.

04:04:57.420 --> 04:04:58.140
Oh, there.

04:04:58.140 --> 04:04:58.460
Sorry.

04:04:59.500 --> 04:05:00.380
I'm using the HUD,

04:05:00.380 --> 04:05:01.500
and then looking at the same time,

04:05:01.500 --> 04:05:02.780
which is the cause of me being there.

04:05:03.340 --> 04:05:03.580
Oh, no.

04:05:09.580 --> 04:05:10.300
Gee.

04:05:10.300 --> 04:05:11.660
I just picked the health up.

04:05:11.660 --> 04:05:12.860
Give me a second to do that.

04:05:13.980 --> 04:05:15.980
And your dad's in school.

04:05:15.980 --> 04:05:17.740
He plays mostly mobile games.

04:05:17.740 --> 04:05:20.380
He tried to get into Starcraft for a bit.

04:05:20.380 --> 04:05:21.340
He got in the floor,

04:05:21.340 --> 04:05:22.860
so he doesn't game that much,

04:05:22.860 --> 04:05:24.540
but we're going to play another game

04:05:24.540 --> 04:05:25.980
called Halo Wars.

04:05:25.980 --> 04:05:28.380
He was fucking addicted to that shit.

04:05:28.380 --> 04:05:29.740
Holy crap.

04:05:29.740 --> 04:05:30.940
He can get enough of it.

04:05:31.900 --> 04:05:34.620
And the difficulty can increase,

04:05:35.260 --> 04:05:38.220
and he got to a stupid, silly number

04:05:38.220 --> 04:05:39.100
and difficulty,

04:05:39.100 --> 04:05:40.220
which is honestly insane.

04:05:41.020 --> 04:05:42.540
Oh, my God, Halo Wars.

04:05:42.540 --> 04:05:44.780
Yeah, you guys have played Halo Wars, too.

04:05:46.780 --> 04:05:48.540
I'm not going to lie, Reefland.

04:05:48.540 --> 04:05:50.140
You'd get along with my dad very well.

04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:53.580
He was addicted to it,

04:05:53.580 --> 04:05:55.420
so we're definitely going to give Halo Wars a bash,

04:05:55.420 --> 04:05:57.100
but it's quite long.

04:05:57.100 --> 04:05:58.380
If I remember correctly,

04:05:58.380 --> 04:05:59.260
it's a long game.

04:05:59.260 --> 04:06:00.460
It's not like a...

04:06:00.460 --> 04:06:02.060
I think it may even be a two-streamer.

04:06:04.620 --> 04:06:05.420
Nope, I missed.

04:06:09.260 --> 04:06:09.820
No!

04:06:10.860 --> 04:06:11.420
I got him.

04:06:13.180 --> 04:06:13.580
Uh...

04:06:15.100 --> 04:06:16.460
Okay, there is a health spot.

04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:17.020
I think...

04:06:17.820 --> 04:06:18.780
I don't need it right now.

04:06:18.780 --> 04:06:19.660
I'm actually still health.

04:06:19.660 --> 04:06:20.300
I mean...

04:06:21.420 --> 04:06:25.180
My dad has quite literally taught me

04:06:25.180 --> 04:06:27.020
everything I needed to know about this game.

04:06:27.900 --> 04:06:30.540
Okay, the doors are open.

04:06:32.540 --> 04:06:33.420
Is this a fight?

04:06:33.420 --> 04:06:34.620
If I've ever seen one,

04:06:34.620 --> 04:06:36.140
it certainly looks like it.

04:06:39.100 --> 04:06:40.140
I think we'll try and talk.

04:06:41.580 --> 04:06:43.500
There's something going on over here.

04:06:43.500 --> 04:06:44.300
I don't like it.

04:06:45.180 --> 04:06:46.060
Is it a plan?

04:06:46.780 --> 04:06:47.820
There's quite a few...

04:06:47.820 --> 04:06:49.340
Oh, it's that building there.

04:06:49.340 --> 04:06:50.620
Okay, I see it.

04:06:50.620 --> 04:06:51.260
Hold on.

04:06:51.260 --> 04:06:52.220
Let's get rid of it now.

04:06:53.340 --> 04:06:54.940
We don't have problems.

04:06:54.940 --> 04:06:56.860
Okay, that's what we want to see.

04:06:57.980 --> 04:06:58.860
Take your time.

04:06:58.860 --> 04:06:59.500
Take your time.

04:07:00.540 --> 04:07:01.660
Time is on our side.

04:07:01.660 --> 04:07:02.540
Health is on our side.

04:07:02.540 --> 04:07:03.340
We don't need to be...

04:07:04.460 --> 04:07:06.700
Going absolutely fast as far as I'm aware.

04:07:08.220 --> 04:07:09.820
Unless maybe we do have enough.

04:07:09.820 --> 04:07:10.380
Oh, there is.

04:07:12.620 --> 04:07:14.620
We are over keeping quite nasty.

04:07:17.260 --> 04:07:20.780
Did my dad ever try Warcraft?

04:07:20.780 --> 04:07:22.620
I don't think so.

04:07:22.620 --> 04:07:23.740
He tried Starcraft.

04:07:23.740 --> 04:07:25.340
He got into a wee bit,

04:07:25.420 --> 04:07:27.420
but I wasn't saying he went MLG crazy.

04:07:31.580 --> 04:07:34.140
But he doesn't really game that much these days

04:07:34.140 --> 04:07:35.180
because of his work,

04:07:35.180 --> 04:07:39.500
but I'm hoping I can retire him next year.

04:07:40.060 --> 04:07:42.060
So, obviously,

04:07:42.060 --> 04:07:44.700
I've got quite a lot of motivational factors.

04:07:44.700 --> 04:07:47.740
Like, the girls motivate me to work hard.

04:07:47.740 --> 04:07:49.660
Like, my dad motivates me to work hard.

04:07:49.660 --> 04:07:51.820
But like, in the nicest way,

04:07:52.780 --> 04:07:55.580
like, if my dad wasn't cool with me gaming,

04:07:55.580 --> 04:07:57.820
like, you guys tell me stories about your parents

04:07:57.820 --> 04:07:59.180
kind of being a bit obtuse,

04:07:59.180 --> 04:08:02.060
like, when you like, game or whatever.

04:08:02.060 --> 04:08:06.140
If my dad wasn't like, cool enough to get into Xbox

04:08:06.140 --> 04:08:07.820
and like, get online and all of that,

04:08:07.820 --> 04:08:09.100
like, I wouldn't be a gamer.

04:08:09.100 --> 04:08:10.460
I'd probably be like,

04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:12.220
Ew, ew, makeup!

04:08:12.220 --> 04:08:12.780
Ew, ew!

04:08:13.660 --> 04:08:16.300
Oh, I love going out to nightclubs

04:08:16.300 --> 04:08:17.980
and grinding on people.

04:08:17.980 --> 04:08:19.020
Oh, like,

04:08:19.740 --> 04:08:22.140
So, I do feel like, oh, my dad or whatever,

04:08:22.140 --> 04:08:22.780
how it came up.

04:08:22.780 --> 04:08:23.820
Like, my mom as well,

04:08:23.820 --> 04:08:25.580
she never had any issues with gaming

04:08:25.580 --> 04:08:26.540
because my dad's game,

04:08:26.540 --> 04:08:27.980
so my mom was like, well, I don't,

04:08:27.980 --> 04:08:28.780
I couldn't get to...

04:08:31.260 --> 04:08:31.760
Oh?

04:08:41.980 --> 04:08:42.480
Uh...

04:08:44.620 --> 04:08:45.660
I don't remember that.

04:08:49.580 --> 04:08:50.080
Okay.

04:08:53.260 --> 04:08:55.260
Take it, take it, take it.

04:08:55.260 --> 04:08:55.980
Yep, that's right.

04:08:55.980 --> 04:08:57.100
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:08:57.100 --> 04:08:58.220
Give him everything I got.

04:08:59.580 --> 04:09:00.060
Come on.

04:09:00.780 --> 04:09:01.820
Come on, buddy.

04:09:01.820 --> 04:09:02.300
Parish.

04:09:03.340 --> 04:09:04.140
That's all we'll see.

04:09:04.140 --> 04:09:04.700
Right, you're next.

04:09:07.420 --> 04:09:08.460
Okay, that's all I want to see.

04:09:08.460 --> 04:09:09.260
That's all I want to see.

04:09:10.220 --> 04:09:10.780
Come on.

04:09:12.220 --> 04:09:13.020
Oh, look.

04:09:13.020 --> 04:09:15.180
Yeah, if you have an invisible guy,

04:09:15.180 --> 04:09:15.740
if you shoot,

04:09:15.740 --> 04:09:17.740
he becomes less invisible in the multiplayer.

04:09:17.740 --> 04:09:18.380
Whoa!

04:09:18.380 --> 04:09:19.580
Not what we want to see.

04:09:19.580 --> 04:09:20.060
Hold on.

04:09:20.700 --> 04:09:21.980
Let's get rid of this building.

04:09:21.980 --> 04:09:22.780
Not what we want to see.

04:09:22.780 --> 04:09:24.620
We don't want him to respawn on enemies.

04:09:26.140 --> 04:09:26.620
Come on.

04:09:27.180 --> 04:09:27.980
There we go.

04:09:27.980 --> 04:09:28.460
There we go.

04:09:28.460 --> 04:09:29.180
We don't want that.

04:09:29.180 --> 04:09:29.660
We don't want that.

04:09:32.140 --> 04:09:34.540
Unfortunately, I'm very, uh...

04:09:36.140 --> 04:09:36.780
Overkeating.

04:09:38.540 --> 04:09:41.180
And these guys move left to right so quickly.

04:09:41.900 --> 04:09:43.100
Oh, God, please hurt him.

04:09:44.140 --> 04:09:44.380
Oh!

04:09:45.820 --> 04:09:46.940
Oh, that's a...

04:09:46.940 --> 04:09:48.860
I need to change that to my donal sound.

04:09:48.860 --> 04:09:50.460
The sound of them exploding

04:09:50.460 --> 04:09:52.380
is just like such a good sound effect.

04:09:52.380 --> 04:09:53.100
Like, shaw.

04:09:54.700 --> 04:09:55.420
That is so good.

04:09:55.980 --> 04:09:56.620
Let's get rid of you.

04:09:57.980 --> 04:09:59.260
Uh, looks like...

04:09:59.820 --> 04:10:00.700
Oh, there we go.

04:10:00.700 --> 04:10:00.940
Right.

04:10:02.380 --> 04:10:03.340
Mama Dad gamed a bit,

04:10:03.340 --> 04:10:04.780
but he stopped less the time going on.

04:10:04.780 --> 04:10:07.100
Oh, my mom was like a Lara Croft e-girl.

04:10:07.100 --> 04:10:08.140
She loves Lara Croft.

04:10:08.940 --> 04:10:10.140
She loves the movies as well.

04:10:10.140 --> 04:10:12.060
We should watch Lara Croft movies for my mom,

04:10:12.060 --> 04:10:14.540
because I feel at home with it like I don't.

04:10:14.540 --> 04:10:15.500
I need to do what again?

04:10:16.460 --> 04:10:17.260
Shit!

04:10:17.260 --> 04:10:18.300
I spoke over it.

04:10:19.100 --> 04:10:19.660
The doors?

04:10:22.700 --> 04:10:23.260
I don't know.

04:10:23.820 --> 04:10:24.220
Oh, shit.

04:10:25.660 --> 04:10:26.540
What am I to do?

04:10:26.540 --> 04:10:26.940
Hello?

04:10:27.580 --> 04:10:29.580
Then you make us all players a little bit of attention.

04:10:30.540 --> 04:10:30.860
This?

04:10:32.220 --> 04:10:32.620
Shit.

04:10:35.180 --> 04:10:36.220
Doors can't be blown.

04:10:38.380 --> 04:10:39.820
What, you calling yourself a door?

04:10:39.820 --> 04:10:41.340
Calling yourself a challenge for me?

04:10:41.340 --> 04:10:41.980
Am I being dumb?

04:10:46.460 --> 04:10:48.460
Camera pan to the generators.

04:10:48.460 --> 04:10:49.420
Find another way.

04:10:49.420 --> 04:10:51.820
Okay, as long as we're not on a timed mission, right?

04:10:52.460 --> 04:10:54.540
Haha, what if we're on a timed mission right now?

04:10:55.500 --> 04:10:56.940
I was fucking around trying to look for...

04:11:00.380 --> 04:11:03.420
Lara Croft and Joy are in a multiplayer mech assault smack talker.

04:11:06.300 --> 04:11:07.020
When you guys are like,

04:11:07.020 --> 04:11:08.140
uh, is your dad single?

04:11:08.140 --> 04:11:09.180
Is your mom single?

04:11:09.180 --> 04:11:09.500
No!

04:11:10.380 --> 04:11:11.660
They're a gaming jewel!

04:11:12.460 --> 04:11:15.900
And they have happy marriage.

04:11:17.100 --> 04:11:18.780
And they have happy daughters.

04:11:19.580 --> 04:11:20.860
And all is good in the world.

04:11:20.860 --> 04:11:21.900
Oh, I see the generator.

04:11:24.380 --> 04:11:26.780
I wonder if I, if I broke that before.

04:11:27.660 --> 04:11:29.100
Would it have standard?

04:11:30.380 --> 04:11:31.980
Is there a daughter single?

04:11:32.780 --> 04:11:34.060
Do you want to meet my parents?

04:11:34.780 --> 04:11:36.940
Would you be nervous if I brought them on stream?

04:11:39.340 --> 04:11:40.700
Okay, now let's go fuck them up.

04:11:42.140 --> 04:11:43.420
Bring my parents on stream.

04:11:43.420 --> 04:11:43.980
Go to the...

04:11:46.060 --> 04:11:48.140
We officially cannot hit on stories.

04:11:48.140 --> 04:11:50.060
Do not hit on my mom and dad!

04:11:51.020 --> 04:11:51.740
Honestly.

04:11:53.820 --> 04:11:55.580
Do they want to be adopted?

04:11:55.580 --> 04:11:56.860
Do you want to be my stepbrother?

04:11:57.820 --> 04:12:01.420
Do you already know what kind of things I'm into?

04:12:01.420 --> 04:12:03.100
Are you sure you want to be my stepbrother?

04:12:05.980 --> 04:12:07.660
Yeah, I'll have you know what I created, I mean.

04:12:08.060 --> 04:12:11.500
I don't think it happened.

04:12:11.500 --> 04:12:13.580
Things would happen if you became my stepbrother.

04:12:15.820 --> 04:12:17.420
Oh yeah, okay, okay.

04:12:18.540 --> 04:12:19.740
All right, let's see what's going on.

04:12:19.740 --> 04:12:22.140
Okay, the base doors just closed, which I don't like.

04:12:22.140 --> 04:12:24.460
I'll bet that plane is loaded with goodness.

04:12:24.460 --> 04:12:27.580
Destroy the drop ship or it can take off.

04:12:27.580 --> 04:12:31.900
Well, considering you've locked me into a cut scene,

04:12:31.900 --> 04:12:33.900
you know, it's really getting away, I have to admit.

04:12:34.620 --> 04:12:35.660
It's really getting away.

04:12:38.620 --> 04:12:39.900
Okay, I think that's it.

04:12:39.900 --> 04:12:40.940
I didn't have much for it.

04:12:41.500 --> 04:12:43.100
I'm like, hold on, there's an enemy.

04:12:43.740 --> 04:12:44.620
Hold on, base.

04:12:54.540 --> 04:12:55.420
Okay, hold on.

04:12:55.420 --> 04:12:57.100
I think we're going to have to try hard a little bit.

04:12:58.700 --> 04:13:00.700
Maybe we do a little bit of sweating.

04:13:00.700 --> 04:13:02.540
Hold on, hold on, a little bit of sweating.

04:13:03.260 --> 04:13:04.060
Just a wee bit.

04:13:05.020 --> 04:13:07.100
Maybe, oh no, that's a terrible good one again.

04:13:07.100 --> 04:13:08.060
Oh, and a clue.

04:13:10.780 --> 04:13:12.060
I feel like he's so weak.

04:13:12.620 --> 04:13:13.740
Oh, no, he's weak.

04:13:13.740 --> 04:13:14.780
He's freaking glowing.

04:13:17.820 --> 04:13:20.460
Wow, okay, that was good.

04:13:20.460 --> 04:13:20.860
Bye.

04:13:24.380 --> 04:13:25.820
Hot heals, I got the H.

04:13:27.500 --> 04:13:29.340
There seems to be something up here.

04:13:29.740 --> 04:13:30.220
Oh, hi there.

04:13:33.340 --> 04:13:34.380
Whoa, the texture.

04:13:35.020 --> 04:13:36.060
I don't know what it is.

04:13:37.500 --> 04:13:38.460
I'm shooting at it anyway.

04:13:44.060 --> 04:13:45.660
Definitely not having a lever.

04:13:49.660 --> 04:13:51.180
Let's see if he can do the bit.

04:13:52.620 --> 04:13:56.220
In the Disney music scene, I can do the bit.

04:13:56.860 --> 04:13:58.300
Right, so this is just an end.

04:13:58.300 --> 04:14:00.300
Okay, I am definitely not good at it.

04:14:01.660 --> 04:14:03.100
What is going on over here?

04:14:05.580 --> 04:14:07.180
I'd be nervous to meet my gran.

04:14:08.540 --> 04:14:09.900
No, they shouldn't send love to you,

04:14:09.900 --> 04:14:11.660
but I feel like she would be the protective one.

04:14:13.180 --> 04:14:15.660
My gran's dead, so you don't have to worry about my gran?

04:14:17.740 --> 04:14:20.300
Yeah, you don't need to worry about her approval.

04:14:20.300 --> 04:14:22.860
She popped her cogs, so you're fine, Riflin.

04:14:25.180 --> 04:14:26.860
Oh, that's funny as fuck.

04:14:29.180 --> 04:14:33.580
Oh, honestly, it was just like, I'm like,

04:14:33.580 --> 04:14:36.140
did I see it or did I just let it go?

04:14:36.140 --> 04:14:37.740
I'm like, nah, that's actually kind of funny.

04:14:39.500 --> 04:14:41.100
Oh, shit, here we go, here we go.

04:14:41.900 --> 04:14:42.700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:43.660
Nah, don't worry about it.

04:14:44.940 --> 04:14:46.460
It's not as painful.

04:14:46.460 --> 04:14:47.580
Oh, shit, I'm going to miss it.

04:14:47.580 --> 04:14:48.700
There's the dropship.

04:14:48.700 --> 04:14:49.100
Kill it.

04:14:49.100 --> 04:14:49.900
Wait, what?

04:14:49.900 --> 04:14:51.020
What you saw, straighter?

04:14:52.380 --> 04:14:52.780
What?

04:14:55.660 --> 04:14:57.980
Nah, it was like Solar's fuck to talk about it.

04:14:59.100 --> 04:15:01.420
Mercenary scum, you'll die now.

04:15:01.420 --> 04:15:03.100
You'll face Ragnarok.

04:15:04.300 --> 04:15:05.340
What is that?

04:15:05.340 --> 04:15:07.420
That's not in any of our technical readouts.

04:15:07.420 --> 04:15:09.100
Oh, my God, it's the Ragnarok.

04:15:12.220 --> 04:15:13.660
Oh, my God, that's right.

04:15:13.660 --> 04:15:15.340
His ultimate is invincibility.

04:15:17.260 --> 04:15:18.380
Oh, my God.

04:15:18.380 --> 04:15:21.020
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

04:15:21.020 --> 04:15:22.300
I completely forgot.

04:15:22.300 --> 04:15:22.940
I forgot.

04:15:23.580 --> 04:15:24.380
Holy shit.

04:15:24.380 --> 04:15:25.420
I forgot everything.

04:15:25.420 --> 04:15:26.140
Just send everything.

04:15:26.860 --> 04:15:27.660
Call the guards.

04:15:27.660 --> 04:15:28.300
Call the guards.

04:15:29.180 --> 04:15:30.700
Oh, my God.

04:15:30.700 --> 04:15:33.500
Oh, my God, he's fucking annihilating me for another day.

04:15:34.460 --> 04:15:34.940
Oh, my God.

04:15:37.100 --> 04:15:37.820
Show mercy.

04:15:39.260 --> 04:15:40.380
Show mercy, Modis.

04:15:40.380 --> 04:15:41.500
Show me mercy, Modis.

04:15:41.500 --> 04:15:44.380
Oh, my God, his ultimate is that freaking three rocket attack.

04:15:46.140 --> 04:15:47.660
I know he's got technology.

04:15:47.660 --> 04:15:48.060
We haven't.

04:15:58.380 --> 04:15:59.980
See you in hell, strainer.

04:16:01.340 --> 04:16:02.060
Sorry, sirs.

04:16:02.060 --> 04:16:03.580
Couldn't help myself.

04:16:03.580 --> 04:16:04.940
Well done, Captain.

04:16:04.940 --> 04:16:07.820
At least now we know what Ragnarok is, or it was.

04:16:08.460 --> 04:16:12.460
Sir, too bad we couldn't capture it and analyze it.

04:16:12.460 --> 04:16:13.980
Sir, what?

04:16:13.980 --> 04:16:15.420
Look at the feet from the cameras.

04:16:16.060 --> 04:16:17.180
Whoa, they had two?

04:16:17.820 --> 04:16:19.180
Foster, send in the tech.

04:16:19.180 --> 04:16:21.100
Oh, I thought I had to do a double fight there.

04:16:21.100 --> 04:16:21.980
I was getting scared.

04:16:21.980 --> 04:16:23.740
We need to stop the Stoom's Day device

04:16:23.740 --> 04:16:25.180
and save this world.

04:16:25.740 --> 04:16:26.460
Oh, thank God.

04:16:31.260 --> 04:16:31.980
Oh, my God.

04:16:33.980 --> 04:16:35.900
I thought we were going to have to do a second fight.

04:16:35.900 --> 04:16:37.900
I was like, I'm wasting 50% health.

04:16:42.940 --> 04:16:43.660
Ready to roll.

04:16:55.180 --> 04:16:57.820
Oh, man, all of us are depending on you.

04:16:57.820 --> 04:16:59.020
Got anything to add, Foster?

04:16:59.660 --> 04:17:01.580
Drinks on me when you get back?

04:17:01.580 --> 04:17:02.140
Good man.

04:17:04.860 --> 04:17:07.180
OK, Ragnarok.

04:17:07.180 --> 04:17:09.900
The Ragnarok is a unique prototype

04:17:09.900 --> 04:17:14.780
built using Loth Tech to provide massive stopping power.

04:17:16.860 --> 04:17:17.260
Wow.

04:17:21.100 --> 04:17:22.540
Look at that swagger.

04:17:25.260 --> 04:17:26.860
OK, let's see what we're dealing with.

04:17:27.900 --> 04:17:30.700
OK, we've got sniper bullets, rockets.

04:17:35.580 --> 04:17:36.620
Wait, and then...

04:17:38.700 --> 04:17:40.060
Wait, then how do I get big...

04:17:41.580 --> 04:17:42.220
How do I do the...

04:17:44.860 --> 04:17:45.980
Wait, how do I do that?

04:17:45.980 --> 04:17:46.460
Do that again.

04:17:52.700 --> 04:17:53.660
What's the red?

04:17:56.060 --> 04:17:57.900
I don't know what the red is.

04:17:58.700 --> 04:17:59.900
But I didn't like it.

04:18:02.060 --> 04:18:04.380
Have I had to secret Abeliae in all these mix

04:18:04.380 --> 04:18:05.340
that haven't used before?

04:18:10.460 --> 04:18:11.740
It's down on its arse.

04:18:14.140 --> 04:18:14.620
Yeah.

04:18:15.820 --> 04:18:16.380
Hold on.

04:18:18.540 --> 04:18:19.660
OK, what the fuck?

04:18:20.860 --> 04:18:21.340
Oh, OK.

04:18:21.340 --> 04:18:21.820
Of course.

04:18:21.820 --> 04:18:23.260
OK, let's see what we're dealing with.

04:18:25.180 --> 04:18:25.740
Why would we...

04:18:28.140 --> 04:18:29.180
All right, let's destroy that.

04:18:30.700 --> 04:18:31.500
Holy shit.

04:18:32.220 --> 04:18:34.220
I forget I have nothing to level with.

04:18:34.220 --> 04:18:34.940
I'm not getting hit.

04:18:36.300 --> 04:18:38.460
Now, I don't have as much health as the Atlas.

04:18:41.500 --> 04:18:44.060
It's not letting me select that one.

04:18:46.860 --> 04:18:49.020
Red is how long it takes to wield it.

04:18:49.020 --> 04:18:52.700
I don't know if you know it or working with people.

04:18:56.140 --> 04:18:56.940
Quick.

04:18:57.500 --> 04:18:59.020
I'm fucking trying, hen.

04:19:01.500 --> 04:19:03.420
Oh, my God, he's already on fire.

04:19:03.420 --> 04:19:04.300
It's fantastic.

04:19:06.780 --> 04:19:07.260
Wow.

04:19:09.500 --> 04:19:10.300
Wow.

04:19:11.660 --> 04:19:12.300
Oh, it's...

04:19:12.300 --> 04:19:13.100
I'm going to sneeze.

04:19:13.100 --> 04:19:13.900
It's so lovely.

04:19:14.780 --> 04:19:15.980
It brings a tear to me.

04:19:15.980 --> 04:19:18.140
Oh, how fucking easy it is with a regular ult.

04:19:20.140 --> 04:19:24.300
OK, let's get right into this.

04:19:25.180 --> 04:19:26.460
Wow, you can't do that to me.

04:19:26.460 --> 04:19:27.260
That wasn't very nice.

04:19:28.300 --> 04:19:29.420
Oh, this is a fuck up.

04:19:34.220 --> 04:19:35.180
OK, get fucked.

04:19:35.180 --> 04:19:36.220
Great, you fuck off.

04:19:37.340 --> 04:19:37.980
Holy shit.

04:19:41.580 --> 04:19:43.420
Yeah, I definitely do not have as much health.

04:19:43.420 --> 04:19:44.060
Can you...

04:19:44.060 --> 04:19:47.100
As if there's a wee bam up there shooting me as well.

04:19:47.100 --> 04:19:47.500
Hold on.

04:19:49.580 --> 04:19:50.060
Hold on.

04:19:51.020 --> 04:19:51.980
Yeah, yeah.

04:19:51.980 --> 04:19:52.940
Take that, bitch.

04:19:54.540 --> 04:19:55.020
Hold on.

04:19:55.500 --> 04:19:55.980
Inbop.

04:19:59.660 --> 04:20:01.100
Sorry, I'm trying so hard.

04:20:01.100 --> 04:20:03.500
I would actually love to do this in one.

04:20:03.500 --> 04:20:05.820
Because the only time I totally lost

04:20:05.820 --> 04:20:08.140
was that crazy runaway mission,

04:20:08.140 --> 04:20:09.660
which you had to have known the layout

04:20:09.660 --> 04:20:10.700
to even know what to do.

04:20:12.060 --> 04:20:14.620
And I jumped off the map like a dafty.

04:20:16.220 --> 04:20:17.100
OK, that's fine.

04:20:18.940 --> 04:20:19.420
Ooh.

04:20:20.860 --> 04:20:24.220
Oh, this is what I remember my dad doing all the time.

04:20:24.220 --> 04:20:25.180
I think it was me.

04:20:27.020 --> 04:20:27.500
Hold on.

04:20:28.220 --> 04:20:29.020
I'll just fuck him up.

04:20:29.900 --> 04:20:31.420
Look at the thing in the background.

04:20:31.420 --> 04:20:36.380
I'd really rather not have infinitely spawning enemies.

04:20:36.380 --> 04:20:37.420
I don't know about you guys,

04:20:37.420 --> 04:20:41.420
but infinite spawning enemies is not my sound of fun.

04:20:42.060 --> 04:20:43.100
My sound of fun?

04:20:43.100 --> 04:20:45.980
Gee, I can hardly speak and play at the same time.

04:20:45.980 --> 04:20:46.540
I'm so sorry.

04:20:47.900 --> 04:20:50.940
I think my dad used to perfectly not destroy the buildings

04:20:50.940 --> 04:20:53.260
so he could collect all these items and leave them there.

04:20:53.260 --> 04:20:54.060
I'm actually sorry.

04:20:54.060 --> 04:20:55.900
I'm legit calling him after my aim is done.

04:20:56.940 --> 04:20:57.820
Because I need to know.

04:20:58.620 --> 04:20:59.420
I think it's true.

04:21:00.460 --> 04:21:01.580
Oh, come on.

04:21:01.580 --> 04:21:02.300
I got you.

04:21:02.300 --> 04:21:03.100
Bear in square.

04:21:03.740 --> 04:21:04.220
Oh, shit.

04:21:04.220 --> 04:21:04.860
I'm low health.

04:21:07.820 --> 04:21:08.460
Hold on.

04:21:08.460 --> 04:21:08.940
Hold on.

04:21:10.140 --> 04:21:10.540
Hold on.

04:21:10.540 --> 04:21:11.820
I'm getting my dad on the phone right now.

04:21:11.820 --> 04:21:13.580
He fucking walks me through this damn game.

04:21:13.580 --> 04:21:13.980
Hold on.

04:21:13.980 --> 04:21:14.620
There must be like...

04:21:15.900 --> 04:21:17.020
Oh, come on.

04:21:17.020 --> 04:21:17.900
Not another one.

04:21:18.860 --> 04:21:19.980
OK, I'll just talk about that.

04:21:19.980 --> 04:21:22.700
Where are these freaking supply bases?

04:21:23.020 --> 04:21:23.500
Hold on.

04:21:24.220 --> 04:21:24.940
Yeah, yeah.

04:21:24.940 --> 04:21:25.660
No, no, no.

04:21:25.660 --> 04:21:27.180
Why did the fillet go up?

04:21:27.180 --> 04:21:28.300
I don't know why it is up.

04:21:28.300 --> 04:21:29.580
I don't know why it is up.

04:21:29.580 --> 04:21:31.260
Right, I just tried that one last week.

04:21:32.860 --> 04:21:33.340
Are you?

04:21:34.700 --> 04:21:35.420
No, he's not.

04:21:35.420 --> 04:21:36.540
It's not reloaded yet.

04:21:38.860 --> 04:21:39.740
Can I get you first?

04:21:41.100 --> 04:21:43.180
Whoa, I need to start doing that whole crap.

04:21:43.180 --> 04:21:43.820
Please.

04:21:44.620 --> 04:21:45.340
Aim.

04:21:45.340 --> 04:21:45.820
Please.

04:21:45.820 --> 04:21:46.700
I'm begging you.

04:21:46.700 --> 04:21:47.020
Aim.

04:21:47.980 --> 04:21:49.500
Why aren't you freaking going off?

04:21:49.580 --> 04:21:50.220
Yeah.

04:21:51.900 --> 04:21:52.860
Oh, come on.

04:21:52.860 --> 04:21:53.260
Freak.

04:21:55.100 --> 04:21:56.380
Oh, come on.

04:21:57.740 --> 04:21:58.780
Please, I'm on my knees.

04:22:02.380 --> 04:22:03.580
I was far too early on that.

04:22:03.580 --> 04:22:04.060
That's fine.

04:22:04.060 --> 04:22:04.860
I can pick up the goods.

04:22:07.500 --> 04:22:07.900
Wah.

04:22:11.100 --> 04:22:11.740
OK, here we go.

04:22:12.380 --> 04:22:13.180
Here we go.

04:22:13.180 --> 04:22:13.740
Where is he?

04:22:14.300 --> 04:22:15.340
Oh, fuck, I missed him.

04:22:15.340 --> 04:22:16.380
I don't know where the fuck he was.

04:22:17.340 --> 04:22:18.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:22:18.460 --> 04:22:19.260
Oh, he's limping.

04:22:19.260 --> 04:22:20.140
That's what we want to see.

04:22:25.660 --> 04:22:26.700
Oh, thank goodness.

04:22:29.020 --> 04:22:29.500
Crap.

04:22:30.940 --> 04:22:32.620
I'm starting to feel the struggle.

04:22:32.620 --> 04:22:34.620
I'm not sure how much confidence I've got.

04:22:34.620 --> 04:22:35.660
I'm going to be honest.

04:22:35.660 --> 04:22:36.540
I'm getting a bit nervous.

04:22:36.540 --> 04:22:37.580
I'm getting a little shaky.

04:22:37.580 --> 04:22:38.300
I'm getting nervous.

04:22:39.340 --> 04:22:41.340
I'm going to grab this little guy over here.

04:22:41.340 --> 04:22:42.060
Hail's bar.

04:22:42.060 --> 04:22:42.780
I know.

04:22:42.780 --> 04:22:43.260
I know.

04:22:44.620 --> 04:22:46.140
Right, I can't grab that.

04:22:46.140 --> 04:22:46.860
I got this.

04:22:49.820 --> 04:22:50.940
Are these even possible?

04:22:52.700 --> 04:22:54.700
I just destroyed my health bar for that.

04:22:54.700 --> 04:22:55.260
Crap.

04:22:55.260 --> 04:22:56.460
OK, OK, it's fine.

04:22:56.460 --> 04:22:56.940
It's fine.

04:22:57.980 --> 04:22:59.900
OK, I need to use my ultimate.

04:22:59.900 --> 04:23:00.460
Holy crap.

04:23:00.460 --> 04:23:02.300
It like respawns so quickly as well.

04:23:03.900 --> 04:23:04.940
I'm still going to get to see you there.

04:23:04.940 --> 04:23:05.340
Hold on.

04:23:09.420 --> 04:23:10.940
OK, use my ultimate.

04:23:10.940 --> 04:23:11.420
Wham.

04:23:12.860 --> 04:23:13.420
Wham.

04:23:14.140 --> 04:23:15.580
It's ultraviolet.

04:23:16.620 --> 04:23:16.940
Whoa.

04:23:17.900 --> 04:23:19.900
Please do not glitch out on the last mission.

04:23:19.900 --> 04:23:20.700
I appreciate that.

04:23:20.700 --> 04:23:21.260
I appreciate that.

04:23:21.260 --> 04:23:22.220
I appreciate that.

04:23:22.220 --> 04:23:22.460
Hold on.

04:23:22.460 --> 04:23:23.420
I'm going to dream far.

04:23:23.420 --> 04:23:24.940
Sir, Atlas inbound.

04:23:24.940 --> 04:23:26.140
OK, OK, I can handle it.

04:23:26.140 --> 04:23:26.860
Atlas is gone.

04:23:26.860 --> 04:23:28.540
Let me just get the other things that are kind of

04:23:28.540 --> 04:23:29.580
to plant me up with this.

04:23:32.140 --> 04:23:32.860
Oh, here he comes.

04:23:33.740 --> 04:23:35.100
Right, ultimate, ultimate.

04:23:37.100 --> 04:23:37.580
OK.

04:23:39.020 --> 04:23:41.020
Uh, how often?

04:23:41.020 --> 04:23:41.420
OK.

04:23:42.540 --> 04:23:44.140
Am I just kind of the mercenary?

04:23:44.140 --> 04:23:45.420
I have a prolonged escape

04:23:46.380 --> 04:23:47.180
to real life.

04:23:47.180 --> 04:23:47.660
I am.

04:23:47.660 --> 04:23:49.180
I'm happy to be the mercenary.

04:23:49.180 --> 04:23:50.380
Hmm.

04:23:50.380 --> 04:23:51.180
I don't like that.

04:23:52.460 --> 04:23:53.580
OK, ultimate's ready.

04:23:54.780 --> 04:23:55.580
Please.

04:23:55.580 --> 04:23:56.700
OK, yay.

04:23:56.700 --> 04:23:57.820
We hit nothing.

04:23:57.820 --> 04:23:58.620
Let's go.

04:23:58.620 --> 04:23:59.500
I love hitting nothing.

04:24:00.620 --> 04:24:01.500
OK, he's on fire.

04:24:01.500 --> 04:24:02.700
He's on fire.

04:24:02.700 --> 04:24:04.700
I'm also in trouble equally, though.

04:24:08.460 --> 04:24:10.780
Please drop pieces of health I beg of you.

04:24:10.780 --> 04:24:12.780
Whoa, those rocks are also falling.

04:24:13.740 --> 04:24:17.100
Let's destroy a few buildings while we're at it.

04:24:21.420 --> 04:24:23.500
Yeah, I'm going to need the ability to see if there's going

04:24:23.500 --> 04:24:25.260
to be more enemies about to spawn in.

04:24:25.260 --> 04:24:26.940
I'm going to need the ability to see if this thing's

04:24:26.940 --> 04:24:29.660
going to be great instead of, like, playing hide and go seek.

04:24:31.740 --> 04:24:34.540
Zero aim assist on the health fire.

04:24:34.780 --> 04:24:35.260
Yeah.

04:24:42.220 --> 04:24:45.660
It's the field of view in this game is absolute.

04:24:45.660 --> 04:24:47.260
Hey, it's all shadows.

04:24:47.260 --> 04:24:48.940
I'm going to be fighting shadows right now.

04:24:49.580 --> 04:24:50.380
Give me that.

04:24:50.380 --> 04:24:51.180
Give me that.

04:24:51.180 --> 04:24:52.220
As if I missed 20.

04:24:52.220 --> 04:24:52.620
Hold on.

04:24:56.300 --> 04:24:56.940
All right.

04:24:56.940 --> 04:24:59.020
Let's hope there's some health on the route

04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:00.540
because I'm sparking a little bit.

04:25:00.540 --> 04:25:02.060
My little ankles are sparking.

04:25:02.060 --> 04:25:03.740
It's just not a good sign at all.

04:25:03.820 --> 04:25:06.540
You need to traverse these lava fields to get to the drill.

04:25:06.540 --> 04:25:07.580
Yes, that's fine.

04:25:09.340 --> 04:25:10.060
Who's that?

04:25:10.060 --> 04:25:11.420
Oh, it's a mech.

04:25:14.460 --> 04:25:17.180
OK, well, that was completely overheated for that,

04:25:17.180 --> 04:25:18.060
not to get a look in.

04:25:20.140 --> 04:25:21.420
Oh, god, there's two of them.

04:25:22.380 --> 04:25:22.860
Sorry.

04:25:22.860 --> 04:25:24.700
All you're going to hear in this is, um,

04:25:25.340 --> 04:25:28.620
because I'm literally just spamming the button to activate it.

04:25:28.620 --> 04:25:29.260
I'm so sorry.

04:25:29.260 --> 04:25:34.380
I mean, it's working.

04:25:35.260 --> 04:25:36.380
Oh, is he in the lava?

04:25:40.380 --> 04:25:41.180
If you're right in front of me,

04:25:41.180 --> 04:25:42.540
you're getting ultimated right now.

04:25:43.980 --> 04:25:47.340
Oh, hey, that didn't quite work in the end, so that's OK.

04:25:49.260 --> 04:25:49.980
Come on.

04:25:49.980 --> 04:25:52.220
I'm so heavy.

04:25:53.020 --> 04:25:54.460
I'm so hot.

04:25:55.260 --> 04:25:57.260
The mech is like running on fire.

04:25:59.260 --> 04:26:00.300
Bro, you aren't going to give up.

04:26:04.460 --> 04:26:06.460
We'll get two health back from those two,

04:26:06.460 --> 04:26:08.540
which should take me back to full health.

04:26:08.540 --> 04:26:09.820
Oh, just under full health.

04:26:12.300 --> 04:26:13.420
He's not going to lie.

04:26:13.420 --> 04:26:15.980
I think that's how you're supposed to play this mech.

04:26:15.980 --> 04:26:16.700
Just constantly.

04:26:19.100 --> 04:26:21.020
Oh, wait, the lava plume.

04:26:21.020 --> 04:26:22.940
I'm supposed to walk through the lava plume.

04:26:24.220 --> 04:26:27.020
Is it possible to do it as little damage as possible?

04:26:30.140 --> 04:26:32.540
OK, hold on.

04:26:32.540 --> 04:26:32.940
Oh, no.

04:26:36.060 --> 04:26:37.100
Oh, shit.

04:26:37.100 --> 04:26:37.660
Oh, shit.

04:26:37.660 --> 04:26:38.140
Oh, shit.

04:26:38.140 --> 04:26:38.620
What have I done?

04:26:44.140 --> 04:26:45.180
OK, OK, OK, it's fine.

04:26:45.180 --> 04:26:48.380
It takes a hot second for it to actually register you're in lava,

04:26:48.380 --> 04:26:50.780
which I'm quite glad about.

04:26:52.620 --> 04:26:54.380
Wah, OK, that was a bit silly of me,

04:26:54.380 --> 04:26:54.940
but we did it.

04:26:54.940 --> 04:26:55.420
We did it.

04:26:55.420 --> 04:26:56.300
We're fine.

04:26:56.300 --> 04:26:56.780
Kind of.

04:26:57.740 --> 04:26:59.020
We're fine.

04:27:00.860 --> 04:27:01.660
OK, big one.

04:27:02.540 --> 04:27:04.140
It might take a little bit of damage.

04:27:05.340 --> 04:27:06.860
We better, we better, we better, we better.

04:27:06.860 --> 04:27:07.420
Could have been worse.

04:27:07.420 --> 04:27:08.060
Could have been worse.

04:27:10.860 --> 04:27:11.340
OK.

04:27:12.540 --> 04:27:12.860
OK.

04:27:13.980 --> 04:27:15.580
OK, ultimate time, I guess.

04:27:16.700 --> 04:27:17.900
Oh, completely missed.

04:27:17.900 --> 04:27:18.540
No, I hit.

04:27:19.340 --> 04:27:21.660
Wah, I hit, I hit, I hit.

04:27:24.220 --> 04:27:26.620
Now, if this mech could just calm down a bit.

04:27:27.260 --> 04:27:30.060
Whenever I hear something aiming at me.

04:27:32.060 --> 04:27:34.060
The gate ahead will take you to the drill approach.

04:27:34.060 --> 04:27:34.780
Hurry.

04:27:34.780 --> 04:27:35.420
I see him.

04:27:36.380 --> 04:27:36.860
I see him.

04:27:37.500 --> 04:27:39.420
Oh, there's fucking Atlas as well.

04:27:40.140 --> 04:27:40.940
Oh, shit.

04:27:41.740 --> 04:27:42.620
Shit, shit, shit.

04:27:42.620 --> 04:27:43.340
Do not like this.

04:27:44.140 --> 04:27:44.860
Hold on.

04:27:44.860 --> 04:27:46.380
I need to pick them off.

04:27:46.380 --> 04:27:47.660
Oh, my God, I need to pick them off.

04:27:48.300 --> 04:27:50.540
OK, Atlas has really low mobility,

04:27:50.540 --> 04:27:52.300
which I'm going to use my damage.

04:27:53.420 --> 04:27:54.940
One is taken down.

04:27:55.020 --> 04:27:57.420
Maybe the Atlas can take some fucking damage.

04:27:58.940 --> 04:28:00.220
OK, he's limping.

04:28:00.220 --> 04:28:01.100
That's what I want to see.

04:28:02.940 --> 04:28:03.740
That's what I want to see.

04:28:03.740 --> 04:28:05.180
I want to see you limping, darling.

04:28:05.180 --> 04:28:07.260
No, you want to limp for me, don't you?

04:28:08.140 --> 04:28:08.860
Oh, yeah.

04:28:09.900 --> 04:28:10.540
OK.

04:28:10.540 --> 04:28:11.420
And then, ultimate.

04:28:12.380 --> 04:28:13.260
And then, receive.

04:28:14.140 --> 04:28:16.460
I'm going to spam you down until you're nothing.

04:28:17.660 --> 04:28:18.620
OK, perfect.

04:28:20.060 --> 04:28:20.620
Perfect.

04:28:20.620 --> 04:28:22.780
I don't know if I can grab that.

04:28:22.780 --> 04:28:25.260
I may be able to grab that with my invincibility shield.

04:28:25.260 --> 04:28:25.980
Holy crap.

04:28:26.780 --> 04:28:28.060
I think we're doing it.

04:28:28.060 --> 04:28:29.420
I don't know what mission we're on.

04:28:29.420 --> 04:28:30.940
I don't know if we're at the end of the game or not,

04:28:30.940 --> 04:28:31.980
but I think we're doing it.

04:28:33.020 --> 04:28:33.980
OK, perfect.

04:28:33.980 --> 04:28:36.700
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.

04:28:36.700 --> 04:28:37.500
Perfect.

04:28:38.540 --> 04:28:40.460
Stony, leave me limping for real.

04:28:40.460 --> 04:28:43.020
These fights are getting kind of heated.

04:28:48.300 --> 04:28:50.300
Look, the map's covered in lava.

04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:51.740
I'm overheating as a mech.

04:28:51.740 --> 04:28:54.700
It's not a bad joke if you put two and two together.

04:28:54.700 --> 04:28:55.180
Jeez.

04:28:56.780 --> 04:28:58.540
These guys are terrible.

04:28:58.540 --> 04:28:59.420
Whoa.

04:28:59.420 --> 04:29:00.140
Next section.

04:29:01.980 --> 04:29:03.580
Ready to rock number two.

04:29:07.420 --> 04:29:07.660
Oh.

04:29:09.260 --> 04:29:11.820
Sir, the trail isn't far down this path.

04:29:11.820 --> 04:29:14.380
I am leading a number of large mechs defending it.

04:29:14.380 --> 04:29:15.900
I wonder if they even know what they're guarding.

04:29:16.540 --> 04:29:18.060
Captain, good luck.

04:29:18.060 --> 04:29:19.100
We're depending on you.

04:29:20.060 --> 04:29:22.700
Yeah, you keep saying the whole world is depending on my shoulders.

04:29:22.700 --> 04:29:23.420
That's quite a lot.

04:29:23.420 --> 04:29:24.220
I'm not going to lie.

04:29:24.220 --> 04:29:25.980
Like, you know, not a lot gets to me,

04:29:25.980 --> 04:29:27.820
but saying that the whole world depends on me,

04:29:27.820 --> 04:29:29.500
like right now, right at this very second.

04:29:29.500 --> 04:29:30.220
Yeah.

04:29:30.220 --> 04:29:32.620
Sorry, I was just checking if there's like any secret behind me.

04:29:33.580 --> 04:29:35.020
Stony, you always huggy here.

04:29:38.780 --> 04:29:41.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:29:41.500 --> 04:29:41.740
Right.

04:29:41.740 --> 04:29:42.380
OK, wait.

04:29:42.380 --> 04:29:43.980
If they've given me eight minutes,

04:29:43.980 --> 04:29:45.820
this round can be done in four.

04:29:45.820 --> 04:29:46.540
I am OK.

04:29:47.500 --> 04:29:48.300
Holy shit.

04:29:48.300 --> 04:29:49.500
I'm getting obliterated.

04:29:49.500 --> 04:29:50.300
I'm not the good thing.

04:29:51.260 --> 04:29:52.540
Like, actually obliterated.

04:29:53.420 --> 04:29:54.860
I've not even started.

04:29:56.940 --> 04:29:57.500
Oh, my God.

04:29:57.500 --> 04:29:59.580
And I'm so slow to turn around.

04:30:00.460 --> 04:30:01.500
Oh, I got him though.

04:30:02.460 --> 04:30:03.340
OK, I got him though.

04:30:03.340 --> 04:30:03.980
I got him though.

04:30:05.260 --> 04:30:05.740
Oh, my God.

04:30:05.740 --> 04:30:05.980
Right.

04:30:05.980 --> 04:30:07.820
It only takes four minutes to finish this mission.

04:30:07.820 --> 04:30:08.860
That's how it works.

04:30:08.860 --> 04:30:09.580
That's how it works.

04:30:09.580 --> 04:30:10.380
It's four minutes.

04:30:10.380 --> 04:30:11.020
That's all.

04:30:11.020 --> 04:30:12.060
And I'm already over here.

04:30:12.060 --> 04:30:12.620
That's safe.

04:30:15.180 --> 04:30:15.980
Oh.

04:30:15.980 --> 04:30:17.020
What am I supposed to do?

04:30:19.980 --> 04:30:20.940
I don't know.

04:30:20.940 --> 04:30:22.220
For a man.

04:30:23.820 --> 04:30:24.380
Four minutes.

04:30:24.380 --> 04:30:25.820
And I can't even get around the corner.

04:30:26.940 --> 04:30:27.580
Four minutes.

04:30:27.580 --> 04:30:29.180
I'm already lost the frickin' minute.

04:30:30.220 --> 04:30:30.620
Please.

04:30:31.740 --> 04:30:33.260
Video game work with me here.

04:30:33.260 --> 04:30:33.900
Yeah, that's right.

04:30:33.900 --> 04:30:34.380
You better be.

04:30:35.420 --> 04:30:36.620
Yeah, you better give me real quick.

04:30:37.180 --> 04:30:38.940
I don't know if I'm fucking good.

04:30:38.940 --> 04:30:40.380
I'm sorry for grabbing this stuff.

04:30:40.380 --> 04:30:41.740
But if they gave me eight minutes,

04:30:41.740 --> 04:30:44.860
that means I have four minutes to fuck all the show.

04:30:46.380 --> 04:30:47.180
Are we already here?

04:30:49.580 --> 04:30:51.340
Or did I have eight minutes to come here?

04:30:51.340 --> 04:30:52.140
Whoa.

04:30:52.140 --> 04:30:53.340
You perished.

04:30:53.340 --> 04:30:54.860
Am I supposed to perish you?

04:30:54.860 --> 04:30:55.580
I feel like it.

04:30:59.820 --> 04:31:01.900
Uh, what?

04:31:02.860 --> 04:31:04.540
I just wasted everything on that ship.

04:31:04.540 --> 04:31:05.900
And that wasn't even my target.

04:31:08.060 --> 04:31:09.180
Please, Atlas.

04:31:09.180 --> 04:31:10.060
Not now.

04:31:10.060 --> 04:31:10.620
Please.

04:31:11.660 --> 04:31:12.220
Surely.

04:31:12.220 --> 04:31:13.580
Oh, I've actually fucked that

04:31:13.580 --> 04:31:14.620
because I went for that ship.

04:31:14.620 --> 04:31:16.700
And it wasn't even my target.

04:31:16.700 --> 04:31:18.460
It wasn't my target.

04:31:18.460 --> 04:31:20.380
I've actually pulled that up so badly.

04:31:20.380 --> 04:31:20.700
Okay.

04:31:20.700 --> 04:31:22.540
We'll need to restart because I messed that up.

04:31:22.540 --> 04:31:23.180
But that's okay.

04:31:23.180 --> 04:31:23.660
Oh.

04:31:25.580 --> 04:31:26.140
Hello.

04:31:33.820 --> 04:31:35.500
Oh, because I aimed at that ship.

04:31:35.500 --> 04:31:36.780
I got annihilated.

04:31:37.820 --> 04:31:38.300
Holy.

04:31:39.900 --> 04:31:40.300
Hmm.

04:31:41.580 --> 04:31:42.460
Holy moly.

04:31:43.420 --> 04:31:44.060
Okay.

04:31:44.060 --> 04:31:44.300
Okay.

04:31:44.300 --> 04:31:44.620
Yes.

04:31:44.620 --> 04:31:45.820
I understand.

04:31:45.820 --> 04:31:47.180
The drill isn't far down this path.

04:31:47.180 --> 04:31:47.420
Okay.

04:31:47.420 --> 04:31:47.900
Right.

04:31:47.900 --> 04:31:49.420
Let's go to the choppers first.

04:31:49.420 --> 04:31:50.540
We know there's choppers ahead.

04:31:52.540 --> 04:31:52.620
Okay.

04:31:52.620 --> 04:31:53.260
Here they come.

04:31:57.500 --> 04:32:00.140
I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do.

04:32:00.140 --> 04:32:01.020
I'm going to be honest.

04:32:02.540 --> 04:32:03.420
It's tough to rule.

04:32:07.420 --> 04:32:07.900
Hold on.

04:32:13.100 --> 04:32:14.700
Holy moly.

04:32:16.700 --> 04:32:18.860
I'm wondering because of the environment as well.

04:32:18.860 --> 04:32:19.340
Oops.

04:32:19.340 --> 04:32:19.820
Sorry.

04:32:19.820 --> 04:32:21.740
Oh, and I just damaged myself.

04:32:21.740 --> 04:32:22.380
Lucky me.

04:32:25.180 --> 04:32:29.100
Um, because obviously I'm just so good at that.

04:32:29.100 --> 04:32:32.700
Uh, it's actually my best winning strategy in this game.

04:32:33.980 --> 04:32:35.900
Let's see if my snipe is better than this one.

04:32:38.540 --> 04:32:39.980
Tanks are going to come around the corner.

04:32:39.980 --> 04:32:40.700
Okay.

04:32:40.700 --> 04:32:41.740
We already know that.

04:32:42.060 --> 04:32:43.100
Oh, one's down already.

04:32:43.740 --> 04:32:43.980
Okay.

04:32:43.980 --> 04:32:45.980
We're doing a much better run already.

04:32:48.620 --> 04:32:50.700
I need to keep using my ultimates.

04:32:51.980 --> 04:32:52.860
Give me full health.

04:32:55.020 --> 04:32:56.380
Do not shoot at the ship.

04:32:56.380 --> 04:32:58.540
The ship is not the objective.

04:32:59.500 --> 04:33:01.580
Shabby and harem.

04:33:02.940 --> 04:33:03.980
What the heck?

04:33:03.980 --> 04:33:05.500
I was about to redirect it to you.

04:33:06.780 --> 04:33:07.740
Don't be selfish, Shabby.

04:33:07.740 --> 04:33:08.460
Get back online.

04:33:10.140 --> 04:33:10.540
Right.

04:33:10.620 --> 04:33:11.260
Okay.

04:33:11.260 --> 04:33:11.980
Take a breather.

04:33:13.020 --> 04:33:13.500
Let's go.

04:33:14.620 --> 04:33:15.100
Let's go.

04:33:16.460 --> 04:33:16.940
Let's go.

04:33:19.180 --> 04:33:19.980
Okay.

04:33:19.980 --> 04:33:21.100
Atlas is on fire.

04:33:21.100 --> 04:33:21.660
I repeat.

04:33:21.660 --> 04:33:22.780
Atlas is on fire.

04:33:22.780 --> 04:33:23.740
That's what we want to see.

04:33:23.740 --> 04:33:24.620
Atlas down first.

04:33:24.620 --> 04:33:26.300
Atlas is the biggest issue.

04:33:26.300 --> 04:33:26.940
Hi, harem.

04:33:26.940 --> 04:33:28.140
We're playing mech assault.

04:33:28.140 --> 04:33:29.900
It's not the easiest game.

04:33:29.900 --> 04:33:31.020
It's a very old game.

04:33:31.900 --> 04:33:33.180
Very much an older game.

04:33:33.180 --> 04:33:35.420
I am doing absolutely dog ass right now.

04:33:35.420 --> 04:33:35.980
Holy crap.

04:33:35.980 --> 04:33:37.580
I'm messing this up so badly.

04:33:37.580 --> 04:33:37.980
Right.

04:33:37.980 --> 04:33:38.460
Got one.

04:33:39.660 --> 04:33:40.300
We've got one.

04:33:40.700 --> 04:33:41.660
We've got one.

04:33:41.660 --> 04:33:42.460
We've got one.

04:33:42.460 --> 04:33:43.340
That's all we need.

04:33:43.980 --> 04:33:45.660
My Ragnarok flame is a fact.

04:33:45.660 --> 04:33:46.220
That's fine.

04:33:46.860 --> 04:33:50.300
The second Atlas is now fucking up my ass.

04:33:51.340 --> 04:33:52.300
I'm not the good way.

04:33:53.900 --> 04:33:56.060
I am using my ultimate so much.

04:33:56.060 --> 04:33:56.780
I really am.

04:33:56.780 --> 04:33:57.660
I'm trying my best.

04:33:57.660 --> 04:33:58.540
I am darling.

04:33:58.540 --> 04:33:59.500
So I'm trying my best.

04:33:59.500 --> 04:33:59.980
Hi, harem.

04:33:59.980 --> 04:34:01.100
Hi, Shabby.

04:34:01.100 --> 04:34:01.980
What was the...

04:34:01.980 --> 04:34:02.540
What was the...

04:34:02.540 --> 04:34:05.500
On the agendination for the stream today for sheepsters?

04:34:05.500 --> 04:34:06.860
Actually, there's underwear.

04:34:07.660 --> 04:34:08.700
What one it could be.

04:34:09.580 --> 04:34:11.180
Oh, forgive me for sake.

04:34:11.180 --> 04:34:12.780
I'm going to get a couple ammo.

04:34:12.780 --> 04:34:14.140
I'm going to need to pick this up.

04:34:14.140 --> 04:34:15.980
This fucking Atlas with his real gun

04:34:15.980 --> 04:34:17.660
is going for my cooter.

04:34:18.300 --> 04:34:19.340
And not the good way.

04:34:20.780 --> 04:34:21.020
Okay.

04:34:21.020 --> 04:34:21.980
Let's get rid of him.

04:34:21.980 --> 04:34:22.380
Whoa.

04:34:22.380 --> 04:34:23.340
That's not Atlas.

04:34:23.340 --> 04:34:24.460
It's a different floor.

04:34:25.660 --> 04:34:26.140
Right.

04:34:26.140 --> 04:34:26.620
Get you.

04:34:28.380 --> 04:34:29.500
Can you take some damage?

04:34:29.500 --> 04:34:31.180
That would be great if you could have taken some...

04:34:31.180 --> 04:34:33.340
Like, honestly, don't be so selfish.

04:34:33.340 --> 04:34:34.860
Take some freaking damage.

04:34:34.860 --> 04:34:35.260
Hold on.

04:34:35.900 --> 04:34:36.620
Oh, please hit.

04:34:36.620 --> 04:34:37.180
Please hit.

04:34:37.180 --> 04:34:37.420
Okay.

04:34:37.420 --> 04:34:38.060
We've got two hits.

04:34:38.060 --> 04:34:39.340
We've got two hits from our ultimate.

04:34:39.340 --> 04:34:40.300
I'll take it.

04:34:40.300 --> 04:34:41.100
He's on fire.

04:34:41.100 --> 04:34:41.740
He's on fire.

04:34:41.740 --> 04:34:42.940
That's all I need to see.

04:34:42.940 --> 04:34:43.660
That's all I need to see.

04:34:44.540 --> 04:34:44.940
No.

04:34:44.940 --> 04:34:45.900
Sorry, mate.

04:34:45.900 --> 04:34:46.700
I'm getting more and more.

04:34:46.700 --> 04:34:47.100
Fuck you.

04:34:48.300 --> 04:34:48.700
Get right.

04:34:49.340 --> 04:34:49.740
Get right.

04:34:50.380 --> 04:34:50.860
Get right.

04:34:52.380 --> 04:34:52.940
He's limping.

04:34:52.940 --> 04:34:53.580
He's limping.

04:34:54.140 --> 04:34:54.380
Oh, yeah.

04:34:54.380 --> 04:34:56.060
I'm going to pick up the stuff that dropped over here.

04:35:00.140 --> 04:35:00.380
Okay.

04:35:01.340 --> 04:35:01.820
Oh, shit.

04:35:01.820 --> 04:35:02.140
Hold on.

04:35:02.140 --> 04:35:03.740
There's like a few things on the map.

04:35:03.740 --> 04:35:04.060
Hold on.

04:35:04.060 --> 04:35:04.380
Hold on.

04:35:04.380 --> 04:35:04.780
Hold on.

04:35:04.780 --> 04:35:05.740
There's a few things on the map.

04:35:05.740 --> 04:35:06.140
Hold on.

04:35:08.540 --> 04:35:09.020
Hold on.

04:35:09.020 --> 04:35:09.660
Give me a second.

04:35:10.860 --> 04:35:12.540
You guys need to relax.

04:35:12.540 --> 04:35:13.100
Relax.

04:35:13.100 --> 04:35:13.580
Relax.

04:35:14.940 --> 04:35:15.180
Wait.

04:35:16.060 --> 04:35:17.180
Relax.

04:35:17.180 --> 04:35:17.660
Oh, my God.

04:35:17.660 --> 04:35:18.620
What's the problem?

04:35:18.620 --> 04:35:20.060
I'm just trying to destroy everything.

04:35:20.060 --> 04:35:21.580
What's the problem?

04:35:21.580 --> 04:35:22.380
Sheesh.

04:35:22.380 --> 04:35:23.420
You guys don't have any fun.

04:35:25.420 --> 04:35:27.340
Are they infinitely respawned?

04:35:27.340 --> 04:35:29.180
Or am I misappropriated?

04:35:31.420 --> 04:35:32.060
Holy crap.

04:35:32.060 --> 04:35:33.580
Are these guys infinite respawned?

04:35:36.300 --> 04:35:37.500
She's falling for the bait.

04:35:38.780 --> 04:35:39.660
Here's the drill.

04:35:39.660 --> 04:35:41.900
The grunt spam is probably to waste time.

04:35:42.460 --> 04:35:43.740
Fuck you, old bitch.

04:35:43.740 --> 04:35:44.780
Fuck you, bitch.

04:35:44.780 --> 04:35:45.500
Fuck you, booty.

04:35:45.500 --> 04:35:46.140
Fuck you, bitch.

04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:57.020
Am I supposed to sacrifice myself?

04:35:57.020 --> 04:35:58.860
I actually don't remember how this game ends.

04:36:03.500 --> 04:36:04.620
Uh, I'll listen.

04:36:05.580 --> 04:36:06.220
Self-destruct.

04:36:06.220 --> 04:36:09.020
You must confirm triggering the self-destruct sequence

04:36:09.020 --> 04:36:10.220
in order to blow up the drill.

04:36:10.220 --> 04:36:11.820
Press the A button to self-destruct.

04:36:18.780 --> 04:36:20.140
Am I going to get a cutscene?

04:36:20.700 --> 04:36:21.980
That was so chaotic.

04:36:24.060 --> 04:36:25.660
Okay, I sacrifice myself.

04:36:25.660 --> 04:36:25.980
Okay.

04:36:30.220 --> 04:36:32.060
Wait, we save all of humanity in the door.

04:36:32.060 --> 04:36:32.780
You can get this.

04:36:32.780 --> 04:36:33.820
Wait, did that survive?

04:36:37.180 --> 04:36:39.100
The drilling device is going critical.

04:36:39.100 --> 04:36:39.980
Keep in it.

04:36:41.420 --> 04:36:42.700
Any chance our boy made it?

04:36:44.140 --> 04:36:44.620
Unknown.

04:36:46.780 --> 04:36:48.380
There's a secret escape pod?

04:36:49.660 --> 04:36:51.820
Hey, Tiger, you're finally awake.

04:36:51.820 --> 04:36:52.460
Oh, right.

04:36:52.460 --> 04:36:53.980
So Lieutenant Foster and the Tex

04:36:53.980 --> 04:36:55.420
have been looking at your little toy.

04:36:56.220 --> 04:36:58.140
We thought you were taking the dirt nap for sure.

04:36:58.700 --> 04:36:59.500
Nice trick.

04:36:59.500 --> 04:36:59.980
Sirs?

04:36:59.980 --> 04:37:01.820
Your cockpit carried you out of that inferno

04:37:01.820 --> 04:37:03.660
and straight back to our loving arms.

04:37:04.220 --> 04:37:04.620
Sirs?

04:37:05.340 --> 04:37:06.860
You really need to see this.

04:37:06.860 --> 04:37:07.260
Oh, no.

04:37:07.820 --> 04:37:09.900
This is technology that we have never seen.

04:37:10.460 --> 04:37:11.660
And this is just the start.

04:37:12.300 --> 04:37:14.460
We're not sure yet what all it can do,

04:37:14.460 --> 04:37:15.420
but it saved your life.

04:37:16.300 --> 04:37:17.100
I wonder if the enemy...

04:37:21.660 --> 04:37:23.100
We handed it to the word,

04:37:23.100 --> 04:37:24.220
saved everyone's butt,

04:37:24.220 --> 04:37:26.380
and in the process definitely got the prize.

04:37:27.100 --> 04:37:28.460
The other Dragoons are still down there

04:37:28.460 --> 04:37:30.540
mopping up the remaining fanatics.

04:37:30.540 --> 04:37:31.980
Most of them started running after you,

04:37:31.980 --> 04:37:33.180
86, their commander.

04:37:34.140 --> 04:37:35.420
We beat them on this planet,

04:37:35.420 --> 04:37:37.260
but I have a feeling this war is just beginning.

04:37:37.980 --> 04:37:39.660
The problem is a lot of them got away

04:37:39.660 --> 04:37:41.100
and they'll spread like a virus.

04:37:41.980 --> 04:37:43.340
So congratulations.

04:37:43.340 --> 04:37:44.540
We've earned our pay

04:37:44.540 --> 04:37:45.500
and a permanent place

04:37:45.500 --> 04:37:46.620
on the word of Blake to the list.

04:37:46.620 --> 04:37:47.580
Yay, the framerate's fucking dying.

04:37:47.580 --> 04:37:48.860
They'll be coming for us.

04:37:48.860 --> 04:37:50.940
And I'm damned if I'm going to give them your toy back.

04:37:51.500 --> 04:37:53.900
Question is, are you ready for this sport?

04:37:54.460 --> 04:37:55.820
Sure.

04:37:55.820 --> 04:37:56.620
I'm ready.

04:38:00.620 --> 04:38:01.580
We did it.

04:38:02.380 --> 04:38:04.780
And the video game journalist lied.

04:38:04.780 --> 04:38:05.420
This game...

04:38:05.420 --> 04:38:06.140
Oh, sorry.

04:38:06.700 --> 04:38:07.180
Hold on.

04:38:07.180 --> 04:38:09.180
My Xbox's dust issue.

04:38:09.180 --> 04:38:09.660
Hold on.

04:38:10.700 --> 04:38:11.660
Oh, my God.

04:38:12.300 --> 04:38:13.500
What the heck just happened?

04:38:15.740 --> 04:38:16.860
Jeez, Louise.

04:38:17.740 --> 04:38:18.300
Oh, yeah.

04:38:18.300 --> 04:38:18.620
Sorry.

04:38:18.620 --> 04:38:21.660
The dust is really building up.

04:38:21.660 --> 04:38:22.300
Holy crap.

04:38:22.300 --> 04:38:23.180
We actually did it.

04:38:23.180 --> 04:38:23.820
I'm so surprised.

04:38:23.820 --> 04:38:25.660
I better just play that game.

04:38:25.660 --> 04:38:26.140
Hi.

04:38:27.420 --> 04:38:28.860
Hi, I'm Strawny.

04:38:28.860 --> 04:38:30.620
I don't even have a chat in slide.

04:38:30.620 --> 04:38:31.100
Hold on.

04:38:32.460 --> 04:38:32.700
Nope.

04:38:32.700 --> 04:38:33.420
That's just...

04:38:33.420 --> 04:38:34.460
That's just my...

04:38:36.620 --> 04:38:38.700
Where the heck am I supposed to be on this?

04:38:39.980 --> 04:38:40.860
This?

04:38:40.860 --> 04:38:42.140
Oh, I'm hiding.

04:38:42.140 --> 04:38:42.940
Oh, okay.

04:38:42.940 --> 04:38:43.980
Hi.

04:38:43.980 --> 04:38:45.980
Oh, let me turn off reactive model.

04:38:45.980 --> 04:38:46.700
We did it.

04:38:47.740 --> 04:38:48.540
I said, let me...

04:38:48.540 --> 04:38:49.660
Is that reactive model?

04:38:49.660 --> 04:38:51.180
Is that how bright I normally am?

04:38:51.180 --> 04:38:52.300
Jeez, that's so bright.

04:38:53.260 --> 04:38:54.780
Hi.

04:38:54.780 --> 04:38:55.900
Hi, Hirom.

04:38:56.940 --> 04:38:58.780
Thank you for joining.

04:38:58.780 --> 04:38:59.820
And thank you, Sheepsters,

04:38:59.900 --> 04:39:01.900
for redirecting into me.

04:39:01.900 --> 04:39:03.180
Wait, are you straining?

04:39:03.180 --> 04:39:04.220
The cold fish?

04:39:04.220 --> 04:39:04.860
Heck, yeah.

04:39:07.980 --> 04:39:10.220
I don't know if you can hear my little background music

04:39:10.220 --> 04:39:11.180
should be in right now.

04:39:11.740 --> 04:39:13.420
But we freaking did it.

04:39:13.420 --> 04:39:15.020
I didn't realize Sheepy was gonna finish,

04:39:15.020 --> 04:39:15.420
to be honest.

04:39:15.420 --> 04:39:16.940
I was gonna redirect into her,

04:39:16.940 --> 04:39:18.700
but I don't know if anyone else was coming on.

04:39:23.260 --> 04:39:24.300
Where is it?

04:39:27.340 --> 04:39:29.580
Is there anyone alive at all?

04:39:30.300 --> 04:39:31.580
Will you play the second game?

04:39:31.580 --> 04:39:33.580
I didn't even know there was a second game.

04:39:33.580 --> 04:39:34.780
Oh, Mamosa.

04:39:34.780 --> 04:39:35.420
Yes, okay.

04:39:35.420 --> 04:39:37.180
I can happily redirect into Mosa.

04:39:38.060 --> 04:39:38.380
Right.

04:39:39.260 --> 04:39:40.060
Just so you know,

04:39:41.180 --> 04:39:44.140
I'm going to do my membership ASMR stream early,

04:39:44.140 --> 04:39:46.940
because I genuinely thought it was gonna take

04:39:46.940 --> 04:39:49.180
like a couple billion hours to do this.

04:39:49.820 --> 04:39:52.540
And every single Veloer model has so much detail.

04:39:52.540 --> 04:39:54.460
I don't even think the girls know this.

04:39:54.460 --> 04:39:56.620
Oh, well, I spent a pretty penny.

04:39:56.620 --> 04:39:57.500
Yeah, but we're like,

04:39:57.660 --> 04:39:59.340
your models look like shit.

04:39:59.340 --> 04:40:00.780
And it's like, try again.

04:40:00.780 --> 04:40:01.660
Good luck with that, mate.

04:40:01.660 --> 04:40:02.140
Good luck.

04:40:03.340 --> 04:40:04.700
Like, I'm sorry,

04:40:04.700 --> 04:40:06.460
but we got designed out the wazoo.

04:40:07.500 --> 04:40:08.780
And starting remember,

04:40:08.780 --> 04:40:09.980
you have a bedroom scene.

04:40:09.980 --> 04:40:10.700
I forget.

04:40:10.700 --> 04:40:12.620
Oh, somewhere.

04:40:12.620 --> 04:40:14.700
Yeah, I'll set up for the ASMR.

04:40:15.660 --> 04:40:19.340
Um, I didn't know Mekosal even had a second game.

04:40:19.340 --> 04:40:20.860
I don't even think my dad played it.

04:40:20.860 --> 04:40:21.900
Hold on a minute.

04:40:22.780 --> 04:40:23.900
Your phone, I'm gonna be like,

04:40:23.900 --> 04:40:26.300
dad, do you recommend the Mekosal 2 game?

04:40:26.300 --> 04:40:28.060
And he'll be like, why, Strony?

04:40:28.060 --> 04:40:31.340
And I'll be like, I may or may not have played it on stream,

04:40:31.340 --> 04:40:32.380
the first one anyway.

04:40:33.420 --> 04:40:35.580
Um, oh, I didn't know.

04:40:36.220 --> 04:40:38.700
It has spectacular lighting.

04:40:38.700 --> 04:40:40.380
Yeah, oh, your phone.

04:40:43.020 --> 04:40:44.460
And the start in street.

04:40:44.460 --> 04:40:46.700
Oh, you guys haven't even seen my singers.

04:40:46.700 --> 04:40:50.220
I don't even have my singers that are like activated.

04:40:51.100 --> 04:40:52.220
I don't even use it.

04:40:52.220 --> 04:40:54.620
The dad, and dad will watch the whole vlog.

04:40:54.620 --> 04:40:57.420
Honestly, he'll start giggling if I send him the link to that.

04:40:58.140 --> 04:41:00.860
Um, but he's busy with work,

04:41:00.860 --> 04:41:02.540
which is why I'm trying to get him retired,

04:41:02.540 --> 04:41:05.260
because I don't want him to like work himself

04:41:05.260 --> 04:41:07.180
until a heart attack or something like that.

04:41:08.140 --> 04:41:09.260
Does dad play anything?

04:41:09.580 --> 04:41:13.340
Um, I would say no.

04:41:13.340 --> 04:41:16.460
However, when he comes over,

04:41:16.460 --> 04:41:18.700
I'm gonna download Halo Wars for him,

04:41:18.700 --> 04:41:19.980
and he can play Mekosal.

04:41:19.980 --> 04:41:22.940
I'll keep this installed if he wants to play it.

04:41:23.580 --> 04:41:27.900
Um, dad gaming channel when?

04:41:27.900 --> 04:41:30.780
Are you more interested in my dad gaming than me?

04:41:32.620 --> 04:41:34.300
Strontium Games.

04:41:34.300 --> 04:41:37.900
Call the channel Strontium Plays Games or something like that.

04:41:39.100 --> 04:41:41.020
Quick, donate to the dad retirement fund.

04:41:41.020 --> 04:41:41.820
No, no, no, no.

04:41:41.820 --> 04:41:42.700
Let me earn it.

04:41:42.700 --> 04:41:43.580
Let me work for it.

04:41:43.580 --> 04:41:44.940
Let me upload ASMR.

04:41:44.940 --> 04:41:47.020
Let me do an exchange for goods and money.

04:41:47.020 --> 04:41:47.900
Let me do that, okay?

04:41:49.020 --> 04:41:51.260
Hey, you should do Halo Co-op.

04:41:51.260 --> 04:41:52.140
I think we will.

04:41:52.940 --> 04:41:53.820
I think we will.

04:41:53.820 --> 04:41:55.820
I'm like, I don't know how much patience

04:41:55.820 --> 04:41:57.660
and how long he'll play it for,

04:41:57.660 --> 04:42:02.860
and the problem is if I ask him questions during the game,

04:42:02.860 --> 04:42:04.540
he's probably gonna be like,

04:42:05.580 --> 04:42:08.060
Shawnee, shut the fuck up and try to play the game.

04:42:09.500 --> 04:42:10.460
He'll probably be like,

04:42:10.460 --> 04:42:12.620
wait, you talk and play through the game the entire time.

04:42:12.620 --> 04:42:15.260
I'm like, yeah, that's how it works when you stream.

04:42:15.260 --> 04:42:17.660
You can either talk to chat

04:42:17.660 --> 04:42:19.020
and like respond to what they're saying.

04:42:19.020 --> 04:42:20.700
You can commentate the game.

04:42:20.700 --> 04:42:23.260
You can go on a tangent and that kind of thing.

04:42:23.260 --> 04:42:25.100
But he'll be like, look, I'm here trying

04:42:25.100 --> 04:42:27.260
to like defeat the covenant, like shut up, Shawnee.

04:42:27.260 --> 04:42:28.540
And I'll be like, okay, thanks, dad.

04:42:28.540 --> 04:42:29.820
Okay, I'll try my best.

04:42:30.700 --> 04:42:33.820
That's my only thing if I did try and do Co-op with my dad.

04:42:35.740 --> 04:42:37.020
But maybe I could record it

04:42:37.020 --> 04:42:39.980
and like put it into like a funny highlight video instead.

04:42:39.980 --> 04:42:43.820
Because I was gonna do like my dad guesses VTuber names

04:42:45.100 --> 04:42:48.380
or my dad renames VTubers for the heck of it.

04:42:49.100 --> 04:42:52.700
Cause if you thought Fondle of Boozom was bad,

04:42:52.700 --> 04:42:57.340
my dad's gonna start naming VTubers like after Celtic players

04:42:57.340 --> 04:42:59.980
and be like, oh, that's Nakamura.

04:42:59.980 --> 04:43:04.540
Oh, that's, is it John Elton was the manager?

04:43:04.540 --> 04:43:07.980
Someone called John dad and dad, dad names Jen too.

04:43:09.420 --> 04:43:11.580
Honestly, that'd be funny.

04:43:12.540 --> 04:43:13.660
He plays the game.

04:43:13.660 --> 04:43:15.020
I commentate over it.

04:43:15.020 --> 04:43:17.500
Oh, possibly that would work out.

04:43:18.460 --> 04:43:21.660
Um, would he call Azura tits McGee?

04:43:21.660 --> 04:43:22.940
Oh, absolutely.

04:43:22.940 --> 04:43:25.580
He, my dad is like absolutely hilarious.

04:43:25.580 --> 04:43:28.620
Like one time we went into the Co-op together

04:43:28.620 --> 04:43:32.060
and they sell these like frog cakes and he gasped

04:43:32.060 --> 04:43:35.180
and he went, oh, Shawnee, it's Peppy.

04:43:36.060 --> 04:43:37.260
Like Peppy the frog.

04:43:38.940 --> 04:43:41.900
Is it true your dad is a fucking slime VTuber?

04:43:41.900 --> 04:43:46.220
No, Shawnee on stream would have 30 second delays

04:43:46.220 --> 04:43:47.580
so that Shawnee can censor it.

04:43:47.980 --> 04:43:51.020
Oh, honestly, I'm like, my name is Shawnee.

04:43:52.380 --> 04:43:54.700
Shawnee is not helping chat when he's being on stream.

04:43:54.700 --> 04:43:55.260
My mom.

04:43:58.460 --> 04:44:01.660
But yes, John Elton right now.

04:44:03.180 --> 04:44:06.060
The manager that used to be for Celtic.

04:44:06.060 --> 04:44:07.020
Oh, Jock Steen.

04:44:07.020 --> 04:44:08.700
Sorry, not John Elton.

04:44:08.700 --> 04:44:12.060
I don't, as Jock Steen was a previous manager at Celtic.

04:44:13.260 --> 04:44:15.260
We need him to operate a Cyclist VTuber.

04:44:15.260 --> 04:44:18.220
I think he'd rather stab himself in the Cyclops eye

04:44:18.220 --> 04:44:19.980
than become a Cyclops VTuber.

04:44:20.860 --> 04:44:22.460
Peppy the frog is my religion.

04:44:23.100 --> 04:44:27.980
My favorite animal is Peppy the frog.

04:44:29.500 --> 04:44:33.420
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, yes, yes.

04:44:33.420 --> 04:44:34.860
I bet your dad would like a slime.

04:44:34.860 --> 04:44:35.580
You know what?

04:44:36.380 --> 04:44:37.260
I'll ask him.

04:44:37.260 --> 04:44:39.820
I'll, when, when he gets here,

04:44:39.820 --> 04:44:43.020
I'll show him a picture of the gen two concepts

04:44:43.020 --> 04:44:45.980
and I'll stick a slime girl in between one of them

04:44:45.980 --> 04:44:49.100
and I'll get him to rate them one out of 10.

04:44:49.100 --> 04:44:52.060
And I bet you he'll agree with me and I'll be like, that looks,

04:44:52.060 --> 04:44:55.580
he'll be like, that looks like piss but colored blue.

04:44:55.580 --> 04:44:56.700
That's what he's gonna say.

04:44:58.460 --> 04:45:00.620
He's gonna forget Shawnee the second, the stream blue.

04:45:00.620 --> 04:45:02.460
I know that's why we're not, we're not doing live.

04:45:02.460 --> 04:45:03.340
No chance.

04:45:03.340 --> 04:45:05.420
Shawnee and dad ain't, ain't coming live.

04:45:07.020 --> 04:45:09.500
If he says yes to slime, there has to be one.

04:45:09.500 --> 04:45:10.940
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

04:45:11.660 --> 04:45:16.220
If the slime girl outranks any veal or concept that we have,

04:45:16.860 --> 04:45:19.100
I will give someone a slime toggle.

04:45:19.100 --> 04:45:19.740
How about that?

04:45:22.060 --> 04:45:25.420
You can tell she be chatting here with the slime girl propaganda.

04:45:25.420 --> 04:45:27.740
Honestly, your propaganda is useless.

04:45:29.660 --> 04:45:31.500
Not all slime girls are blue.

04:45:31.500 --> 04:45:33.580
What, you want, oh, so you don't even want

04:45:33.580 --> 04:45:35.980
the traditional blue slime girl.

04:45:35.980 --> 04:45:39.740
It has to be an alternative color of slime girl on top.

04:45:39.740 --> 04:45:42.300
Wow, I see your priorities.

04:45:42.300 --> 04:45:43.820
I see your priorities.

04:45:43.820 --> 04:45:44.940
Shocking behavior.

04:45:45.660 --> 04:45:47.660
Shocking, honestly.

04:45:49.740 --> 04:45:50.700
Paint, purple.

04:45:50.700 --> 04:45:52.220
You want a purple slime girl?

04:45:53.500 --> 04:45:53.820
No.

04:45:54.860 --> 04:45:56.620
Shawnee is immune to boob again though.

04:45:57.420 --> 04:45:58.940
Shimmering orange.

04:45:58.940 --> 04:46:00.300
Shimmering orange.

04:46:01.100 --> 04:46:03.980
What, so she's fucking neon pea color.

04:46:03.980 --> 04:46:06.780
Orange, tangerine slime girl.

04:46:06.780 --> 04:46:08.860
I'll call her, I'll call her tango

04:46:08.860 --> 04:46:10.140
because she's tangerine.

04:46:10.140 --> 04:46:10.700
Why not?

04:46:10.700 --> 04:46:12.220
White slime girl, all right, you're done.

04:46:12.220 --> 04:46:13.500
You're done, mods, get that man.

04:46:14.140 --> 04:46:15.820
Jump on, jump on mods.

04:46:17.260 --> 04:46:18.620
Slime girl is the lowest tier.

04:46:18.620 --> 04:46:20.140
It's like McDonald's of slime girls.

04:46:20.140 --> 04:46:22.860
I have to admit, I agree with that sentiment.

04:46:24.140 --> 04:46:25.740
I agree, I agree.

04:46:25.740 --> 04:46:29.740
Nuclear yellow, white jar slime girl.

04:46:29.740 --> 04:46:31.900
You're done, you're getting timed out as well, right?

04:46:31.900 --> 04:46:32.780
You're all getting timed out.

04:46:33.580 --> 04:46:35.580
If your pea is orange, you need to go to a doctor.

04:46:35.580 --> 04:46:36.780
Are you squirming me right now?

04:46:37.340 --> 04:46:38.620
I swear if you're asking for slime.

04:46:38.620 --> 04:46:39.820
I'll take that BT.

04:46:41.020 --> 04:46:42.220
Yeah, good luck.

04:46:42.220 --> 04:46:44.860
Thank you for the tip, Rilke Cadmus.

04:46:44.860 --> 04:46:46.940
You take that bit because I know for a fact

04:46:46.940 --> 04:46:48.300
my dad couldn't give less of a,

04:46:49.580 --> 04:46:50.540
about slime girls.

04:46:51.100 --> 04:46:54.780
He, in a lineup of Gen 1's designs,

04:46:55.420 --> 04:46:58.300
I already know he's gonna like she be the most

04:46:58.300 --> 04:46:59.820
because they, because they're blonde.

04:47:00.860 --> 04:47:04.060
I do know her, her chest is out.

04:47:07.020 --> 04:47:13.900
It'll be she be he likes first, then Azura,

04:47:13.900 --> 04:47:17.420
then Mercy, then Icey, then Amylast.

04:47:18.220 --> 04:47:19.100
I can already tell.

04:47:19.820 --> 04:47:21.500
I can already tell.

04:47:23.340 --> 04:47:25.900
He's gonna be scared of the lollipops

04:47:25.900 --> 04:47:28.060
because he doesn't consume anime.

04:47:29.100 --> 04:47:31.740
If you don't consume anime or like any of that content,

04:47:31.740 --> 04:47:34.140
it can be a bit startling seeing lollipops.

04:47:36.860 --> 04:47:38.940
ASMR, Amy turns Strony into a slime girl.

04:47:38.940 --> 04:47:39.660
I believe her.

04:47:39.660 --> 04:47:40.460
Honestly.

04:47:44.140 --> 04:47:47.580
Yeah, my, this man likes them big.

04:47:47.580 --> 04:47:49.500
Yeah, he's definitely like,

04:47:52.380 --> 04:47:53.900
he's not gonna be interested in,

04:47:53.900 --> 04:47:56.620
I am not getting my dad to rate my beach ever model.

04:47:56.620 --> 04:47:59.260
That seems a bit, other than like, I'll tell,

04:47:59.260 --> 04:48:01.420
like he already knows that I'm Strony,

04:48:01.420 --> 04:48:03.100
like after and such thing.

04:48:03.980 --> 04:48:08.060
Understood, but we are in anime world.

04:48:08.060 --> 04:48:09.740
Lollipop covered slime girl.

04:48:09.740 --> 04:48:10.460
You know what?

04:48:12.220 --> 04:48:12.940
You know what?

04:48:12.940 --> 04:48:14.620
If I look back and chat one more time

04:48:14.620 --> 04:48:15.660
and see the S word,

04:48:18.060 --> 04:48:20.780
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going scorched earth.

04:48:20.780 --> 04:48:21.660
I'm going nuclear.

04:48:21.660 --> 04:48:22.700
Do I make myself clear?

04:48:24.940 --> 04:48:26.540
So I'm not looking at chat right now.

04:48:26.540 --> 04:48:28.380
I'm getting ready to redirect into mimosa

04:48:28.380 --> 04:48:31.100
because she's about to reach the watch time.

04:48:31.100 --> 04:48:33.260
So please do consider watching her.

04:48:34.060 --> 04:48:36.380
I am going to take a five minute break

04:48:36.380 --> 04:48:37.660
and then we are going to boot up.

04:48:40.700 --> 04:48:41.500
I like them.

04:48:44.220 --> 04:48:45.180
Scorched earth.

04:48:46.220 --> 04:48:50.540
Scorched earth is a saying where,

04:48:51.500 --> 04:48:52.380
you know what?

04:48:52.380 --> 04:48:53.660
We're in the information age.

04:48:53.660 --> 04:48:56.780
Scorched earth meaning, let's search it.

04:48:57.740 --> 04:49:01.180
Scorched earth.

04:49:01.180 --> 04:49:03.500
Used to describe a military policy

04:49:03.500 --> 04:49:06.220
in which all houses, crops, factories

04:49:06.220 --> 04:49:07.420
in the area are destroyed

04:49:07.420 --> 04:49:09.740
so that the enemy cannot utilize them.

04:49:11.580 --> 04:49:13.020
And in layman's terms,

04:49:13.020 --> 04:49:16.300
scorched earth means that you're all in trouble

04:49:16.300 --> 04:49:17.660
if I read slime one more time.

04:49:19.100 --> 04:49:22.140
I don't know why you guys are like so interested in slime.

04:49:22.140 --> 04:49:23.020
It's not.

04:49:23.020 --> 04:49:24.380
Why are you, why?

04:49:24.380 --> 04:49:24.780
Why?

04:49:25.580 --> 04:49:27.420
It's not going to work in each of her.

04:49:36.140 --> 04:49:37.260
Yeah, that's scorched.

04:49:37.260 --> 04:49:38.140
What's scratched?

04:49:38.140 --> 04:49:39.180
Oh, did I say it wrong?

04:49:39.180 --> 04:49:40.620
Did I say scratched earth?

04:49:42.460 --> 04:49:43.820
Scratch my arse earth.

04:49:43.820 --> 04:49:45.260
I'll scratch the earth's arse.

04:49:45.260 --> 04:49:46.700
Stronium will burn viola to the ground

04:49:46.700 --> 04:49:48.220
before having a slime grow.

04:49:48.220 --> 04:49:50.620
Now, if one of the girls wants a slime toggle,

04:49:50.620 --> 04:49:53.180
sure, knock yourself out just to upset me.

04:49:53.180 --> 04:49:54.380
I don't care if they want that.

04:49:54.780 --> 04:49:55.820
They can get it.

04:49:55.820 --> 04:49:56.380
They want it.

04:49:56.380 --> 04:49:56.940
They could get it.

04:49:56.940 --> 04:49:59.340
I'm not stopping them from any goals like that.

04:49:59.340 --> 04:50:02.780
But if you are asking me for a straight up slime girl,

04:50:02.780 --> 04:50:09.180
default outfit, default position, no, I don't care.

04:50:09.740 --> 04:50:10.460
I don't care.

04:50:11.340 --> 04:50:14.220
So any muscle mummy concepts, that's called leaks.

04:50:14.220 --> 04:50:15.500
I'm not allowed to leak that yet.

04:50:17.420 --> 04:50:20.460
All I can say is that there's been progress

04:50:21.660 --> 04:50:22.540
behind the scenes.

04:50:23.260 --> 04:50:24.060
That's all I can say.

04:50:24.060 --> 04:50:24.940
I'm not saying nothing more.

04:50:26.300 --> 04:50:27.580
Everything's under NDA.

04:50:27.580 --> 04:50:28.780
No, there's no NDA.

04:50:29.900 --> 04:50:31.900
Everything's under NDA though, but there's no NDA.

04:50:32.540 --> 04:50:33.740
I can't be also NDA.

04:50:33.740 --> 04:50:34.620
I fucking can't stand them.

04:50:36.780 --> 04:50:40.140
An elemental girl, like a flaming raccoon and that.

04:50:40.140 --> 04:50:40.860
You know what's funny?

04:50:40.860 --> 04:50:42.860
I sent away a spring in Skyrim,

04:50:42.860 --> 04:50:45.660
and I did not get back a spring in Skyrim at all.

04:50:46.460 --> 04:50:47.340
But I sent it away.

04:50:47.340 --> 04:50:49.100
So I tried my best.

04:50:49.740 --> 04:50:51.340
You are the NDA.

04:50:51.340 --> 04:50:53.420
I'm an NDA's worst nightmare.

04:50:53.420 --> 04:50:55.980
I am literally loose lip sync ships.

04:50:55.980 --> 04:50:59.580
I cannot shut the fuck up about all my interests.

04:50:59.580 --> 04:51:01.660
We've got the first animation back

04:51:01.660 --> 04:51:05.180
for the alternative video game, and it looks good.

04:51:05.180 --> 04:51:05.900
It looks good.

04:51:07.020 --> 04:51:09.180
I just don't know how long it's going to take.

04:51:09.180 --> 04:51:13.900
I still want to say July, end of July.

04:51:15.740 --> 04:51:20.620
If not very early August, incredibly early August,

04:51:20.700 --> 04:51:24.060
there's no way it's going past halfway through August.

04:51:25.020 --> 04:51:26.780
We're just waiting on the animations,

04:51:26.780 --> 04:51:27.740
and then everything,

04:51:27.740 --> 04:51:29.660
all the puzzle pieces can be put together

04:51:29.660 --> 04:51:31.580
once the animations are finalized.

04:51:31.580 --> 04:51:34.700
I saw a preview of Icy's animation,

04:51:34.700 --> 04:51:36.060
and you're welcome.

04:51:36.940 --> 04:51:38.620
I saw I'm going to say you're welcome.

04:51:40.620 --> 04:51:42.700
We only bring up some stuff to tease.

04:51:42.700 --> 04:51:44.380
Yeah, I know you teasing.

04:51:44.380 --> 04:51:45.980
I wanted to make a joke about our lips,

04:51:45.980 --> 04:51:47.500
but the Japanese one wins.

04:51:47.500 --> 04:51:48.140
I know.

04:51:48.140 --> 04:51:49.420
You need to be quick.

04:51:49.500 --> 04:51:51.340
You need to be quick,

04:51:51.340 --> 04:51:53.420
if you want to make a joke on something I said,

04:51:53.420 --> 04:51:55.180
because I'll be off it real quick.

04:51:56.460 --> 04:51:57.900
As the human race has proven,

04:51:57.900 --> 04:52:01.820
anything can be at this point.

04:52:02.460 --> 04:52:03.180
You want us quick?

04:52:03.180 --> 04:52:04.940
Are you kidding me right now?

04:52:04.940 --> 04:52:06.300
I swear if this is a slime girl.

04:52:06.300 --> 04:52:09.180
Strongly, if you're up for a scary game,

04:52:09.180 --> 04:52:13.340
a few days ago a game called Still Wakes the Deep came out.

04:52:13.340 --> 04:52:16.940
It takes place on a Scottish oil rig and has a great story.

04:52:16.940 --> 04:52:17.900
Oh, does it?

04:52:17.900 --> 04:52:18.620
Is it?

04:52:18.620 --> 04:52:20.780
Oh, I need to get a heart rate monitor.

04:52:20.780 --> 04:52:21.580
I don't.

04:52:21.580 --> 04:52:21.900
Hold on.

04:52:21.900 --> 04:52:23.500
Let me put it in my notes right now.

04:52:23.500 --> 04:52:24.540
Like right this moment.

04:52:46.380 --> 04:52:46.780
Hold on.

04:52:46.780 --> 04:52:47.820
Let me write my notes.

04:52:47.820 --> 04:52:48.380
Write my notes.

04:52:48.780 --> 04:52:50.860
Heart rate monitor because I need it,

04:52:50.860 --> 04:52:52.460
and then I need a new shot caller,

04:52:52.460 --> 04:52:53.660
or actually hold on.

04:52:54.300 --> 04:52:57.820
Sin sister, shot caller, cold smile.

04:52:58.620 --> 04:53:00.700
Her problem now, not mine.

04:53:01.900 --> 04:53:03.580
Yes, I might give it a shot.

04:53:03.580 --> 04:53:05.740
Also, actually Scottish voice actors,

04:53:05.740 --> 04:53:07.260
not Americans try to be Scottish.

04:53:07.260 --> 04:53:08.860
Oh, praise the fucking Lord.

04:53:08.860 --> 04:53:11.660
It's not that hard to find Scottish actors.

04:53:11.660 --> 04:53:15.660
It's that thing like Junkrat and Overwatch as an American,

04:53:15.660 --> 04:53:16.780
and it was like, oh, come on.

04:53:16.780 --> 04:53:19.740
You're telling me there wasn't one voice actor available

04:53:19.740 --> 04:53:21.900
that could do Maniac Australian?

04:53:21.900 --> 04:53:23.340
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

04:53:24.620 --> 04:53:25.660
Mentioning the heart rate monitor,

04:53:25.660 --> 04:53:26.540
did you get the burner phone?

04:53:26.540 --> 04:53:29.100
No, I'm going to ask Sin sister

04:53:29.100 --> 04:53:31.020
if I could just use her phone number.

04:53:31.020 --> 04:53:32.060
Yeah, oh, well, yeah.

04:53:32.060 --> 04:53:34.300
Okay, well, we both just answered each other's question there.

04:53:37.020 --> 04:53:40.540
He's getting the feeling for having a shield generator.

04:53:41.980 --> 04:53:44.300
Is the Australian guy from Siege voice finals?

04:53:44.300 --> 04:53:44.860
I have no idea.

04:53:44.860 --> 04:53:46.540
Name two Scottish voice actors.

04:53:51.340 --> 04:53:52.860
Strony Cuttles and Sin sister.

04:53:52.860 --> 04:53:53.180
Thank you.

04:53:53.180 --> 04:53:53.420
Thank you.

04:53:53.420 --> 04:53:54.140
I'll be here all day.

04:53:54.940 --> 04:53:55.500
Anyone else?

04:53:55.500 --> 04:53:55.980
Anyone else?

04:53:58.780 --> 04:54:02.780
I promise you it's not that hard to find actual a Scottish.

04:54:03.420 --> 04:54:05.180
Well, actually, Sin sister doesn't count

04:54:05.180 --> 04:54:05.900
because she's not.

04:54:07.980 --> 04:54:09.340
She's honorary Scott.

04:54:09.340 --> 04:54:10.140
You know what I mean?

04:54:10.140 --> 04:54:11.660
Okay, look, you know what I mean?

04:54:12.700 --> 04:54:13.820
No, Sin isn't Scottish.

04:54:15.580 --> 04:54:16.940
You thought I was Welsh?

04:54:16.940 --> 04:54:17.740
What the fuck?

04:54:19.260 --> 04:54:20.060
Are you trolling?

04:54:20.060 --> 04:54:21.420
You did not think I was Welsh.

04:54:22.940 --> 04:54:23.900
Isn't Welsh like,

04:54:25.500 --> 04:54:28.220
I'm the only gay in the village that's Welsh?

04:54:29.340 --> 04:54:33.580
No. Sin is honorary Scott,

04:54:33.580 --> 04:54:34.860
which not actually is not.

04:54:36.460 --> 04:54:38.460
No one can do a good fake Scott accent.

04:54:39.260 --> 04:54:43.180
It's like there is no Welsh and Strony now.

04:54:45.740 --> 04:54:47.100
Someone thought you were Welsh or anything.

04:54:47.100 --> 04:54:48.780
Oh my God, Sheep Girl, Gen 2 confirmed.

04:54:49.580 --> 04:54:54.060
And then POV, you're supposed to be a Sheep Shagger.

04:54:54.060 --> 04:54:54.860
Oh, that's awful.

04:54:54.860 --> 04:54:55.980
I'm sorry for even saying that.

04:54:56.860 --> 04:54:58.060
It's funny in the moment,

04:54:58.060 --> 04:54:59.340
but now that I've said it out loud.

04:54:59.340 --> 04:55:01.340
Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous as well.

04:55:01.340 --> 04:55:03.020
But yes, I'll definitely,

04:55:03.020 --> 04:55:04.460
once the heart rate monitor comes through,

04:55:04.460 --> 04:55:05.820
I will be messing around.

04:55:05.820 --> 04:55:10.540
I want to do that fitness Nintendo game Ring Fit,

04:55:10.540 --> 04:55:12.300
but again, I need a heart rate monitor

04:55:12.300 --> 04:55:14.540
to show you how quickly my heart is about to explode

04:55:14.540 --> 04:55:16.540
because I'm needing to get some exercise in

04:55:16.540 --> 04:55:18.060
and because I'm streaming all along,

04:55:18.060 --> 04:55:19.580
I'm not really getting that exercise.

04:55:20.780 --> 04:55:22.300
I'm being a naughty girl.

04:55:23.340 --> 04:55:25.260
I'm not getting that exercise.

04:55:25.260 --> 04:55:26.540
I'm going to do it with you.

04:55:28.940 --> 04:55:30.140
But yes, I'm going to be doing that.

04:55:32.780 --> 04:55:37.180
No, I've got my first limited ad stream.

04:55:37.980 --> 04:55:40.700
No, this cannot.

04:55:40.700 --> 04:55:41.820
No, what?

04:55:41.900 --> 04:55:43.660
I've got, no.

04:55:43.660 --> 04:55:45.820
More things have been hit with limited ads.

04:55:47.100 --> 04:55:47.980
No way.

04:55:50.860 --> 04:55:55.020
My freaking, my RuneScape stream.

04:55:56.860 --> 04:56:00.220
My RuneScape stream where I got Wrecked and Connect 4

04:56:00.220 --> 04:56:01.740
got hit with limited ads.

04:56:01.740 --> 04:56:03.020
Don't you dare, YouTube.

04:56:04.220 --> 04:56:05.500
Stop it, YouTube.

04:56:05.500 --> 04:56:06.780
You're so stinky.

04:56:08.460 --> 04:56:11.180
Okay, but all my other stuff is fine.

04:56:11.420 --> 04:56:14.780
Literally the RuneScape is probably because of the tinfoil.

04:56:14.780 --> 04:56:16.540
We spoke too much about BlackRock.

04:56:16.540 --> 04:56:17.180
They got me.

04:56:17.180 --> 04:56:17.740
I can't believe it.

04:56:17.740 --> 04:56:18.940
They're killing my income source.

04:56:19.820 --> 04:56:21.340
Right, I just,

04:56:21.340 --> 04:56:23.820
I'm going to redirect into mimosa in a second.

04:56:23.820 --> 04:56:27.500
I do want to say tomorrow,

04:56:29.580 --> 04:56:32.700
if I'm not mistaken, is Valtral, okay?

04:56:33.740 --> 04:56:34.700
But hear me out.

04:56:35.580 --> 04:56:41.020
It is two hours after my usual stream start time.

04:56:41.740 --> 04:56:42.060
Okay?

04:56:42.780 --> 04:56:44.140
It's going to be a shorter stream

04:56:44.140 --> 04:56:46.940
so I can focus on some ASMR work as I always do.

04:56:47.660 --> 04:56:50.380
In Valtral, oh, sorry.

04:56:50.380 --> 04:56:52.300
Ballatral or Valtral.

04:56:55.100 --> 04:56:57.740
It starts two hours later

04:56:57.740 --> 04:56:59.900
because Veeler having a meet-in.

04:56:59.900 --> 04:57:02.780
I need to make sure the girls are all good and even fine.

04:57:02.860 --> 04:57:04.060
Catch them up with them

04:57:04.060 --> 04:57:05.980
because I really had a chance to talk to them all.

04:57:07.260 --> 04:57:08.540
Obviously, Emma doesn't count

04:57:08.540 --> 04:57:10.380
because she's not even at her PC.

04:57:10.380 --> 04:57:11.580
She's not even in the company.

04:57:12.940 --> 04:57:15.260
But yeah, we're going to have a nice little girl group meeting

04:57:15.260 --> 04:57:18.380
and the best time zone for it was my start time

04:57:18.380 --> 04:57:21.500
because American, Europe, mashed together.

04:57:21.500 --> 04:57:22.620
And what do you get? A pancake.

04:57:25.100 --> 04:57:26.700
So I'm going to be two hours.

04:57:27.260 --> 04:57:28.460
No, I'm not going to be late.

04:57:28.460 --> 04:57:29.820
The stream is two hours later.

04:57:29.820 --> 04:57:31.820
So just keep that in mind for Valtral.

04:57:31.820 --> 04:57:33.660
The stream is two hours later than usual

04:57:34.300 --> 04:57:36.540
just because I'm catching up with my girls,

04:57:36.540 --> 04:57:37.900
making sure everything's okay

04:57:37.900 --> 04:57:39.580
and everyone's having a good time.

04:57:40.940 --> 04:57:43.740
Because it's all fine and well,

04:57:43.740 --> 04:57:45.980
like sending a message or a DM and being like,

04:57:45.980 --> 04:57:46.700
oh, are you good?

04:57:46.700 --> 04:57:48.860
But when you hear someone in voice chat,

04:57:48.860 --> 04:57:50.060
they can bring up concerns

04:57:50.060 --> 04:57:52.940
or they can bring up things they maybe hoped

04:57:52.940 --> 04:57:54.700
would be better or have gone better.

04:57:54.700 --> 04:57:59.260
So yeah, too early.

04:57:59.260 --> 04:58:00.860
I don't really think it's going to be that long

04:58:00.860 --> 04:58:01.820
unless we girls can.

04:58:03.020 --> 04:58:04.780
You know what happens when girls get together?

04:58:04.780 --> 04:58:05.740
Can't shut the fuck up.

04:58:06.940 --> 04:58:08.940
But yeah, two hours extra sleep.

04:58:08.940 --> 04:58:09.500
Nice.

04:58:09.500 --> 04:58:11.820
Yeah, it's literally for the folk

04:58:11.820 --> 04:58:14.460
who are like absolutely exhausted.

04:58:14.460 --> 04:58:15.740
You get two extra hours.

04:58:17.580 --> 04:58:20.140
God, my French tip nails are growing.

04:58:20.140 --> 04:58:22.140
The fuck is actually getting pretty gross now.

04:58:22.140 --> 04:58:24.060
I'll have to admit, yeah.

04:58:25.420 --> 04:58:26.620
Yapping intensifies.

04:58:26.620 --> 04:58:28.780
Yeah, basically it's just going to be a big old yap fest

04:58:28.860 --> 04:58:30.300
and I'll be like, I hope you guys are okay.

04:58:30.300 --> 04:58:31.500
And everyone will be like, yeah, you're okay.

04:58:32.700 --> 04:58:35.500
And I completely forgot to do that 5K celebration

04:58:36.220 --> 04:58:37.500
because everyone hit 5K.

04:58:37.500 --> 04:58:41.020
So I'm going to see if I can get the social media manager

04:58:41.020 --> 04:58:45.420
to post the artwork I got for it as a celebration.

04:58:45.420 --> 04:58:48.380
I cannot wait for you guys to see the 10K celebration

04:58:48.380 --> 04:58:49.580
on everyone.

04:58:49.580 --> 04:58:51.340
I got a really good artwork.

04:58:51.340 --> 04:58:52.300
Sorry, but it's like that.

04:58:54.140 --> 04:58:55.820
It's a beautiful 10K artwork.

04:58:56.700 --> 04:59:01.100
You VLU girls are running your purr fans' ragged.

04:59:01.660 --> 04:59:03.660
Are you drained like that one meme?

04:59:04.860 --> 04:59:05.580
Don't mention it.

04:59:05.580 --> 04:59:06.620
How's your heart doing?

04:59:06.620 --> 04:59:07.580
A lot better.

04:59:07.580 --> 04:59:14.940
It's still like blood underneath the skin.

04:59:16.940 --> 04:59:19.100
That's what it is at the moment.

04:59:21.500 --> 04:59:23.180
A video or a picture.

04:59:23.180 --> 04:59:24.700
An artwork.

04:59:24.700 --> 04:59:27.660
I got a special artwork for 10K,000 subscribers.

04:59:27.660 --> 04:59:31.180
For like, when everyone reaches 10,000 subscribers,

04:59:31.980 --> 04:59:35.180
it will go live and it's a beautiful piece of artwork.

04:59:35.980 --> 04:59:37.260
I absolutely adore it.

04:59:37.260 --> 04:59:46.140
I think we might try and work on free access rewards at Milestones.

04:59:46.140 --> 04:59:51.740
So you know how I'm kind of doing one ASMR video per 1,000 subscribers?

04:59:52.460 --> 04:59:56.140
I obviously am in a bit of a deficit and need to start uploading them.

04:59:56.140 --> 04:59:56.540
But I will.

04:59:56.540 --> 04:59:57.100
I'm getting on it.

04:59:57.100 --> 04:59:58.140
I promise I'm getting on it.

04:59:58.140 --> 05:00:06.380
I am going to see if the girls might consider doing,

05:00:06.380 --> 05:00:08.940
even if it's like a voice pack, for example,

05:00:10.460 --> 05:00:14.220
or like a thank you audio on the alternative account,

05:00:14.220 --> 05:00:16.380
something like that when they reach Milestones,

05:00:16.380 --> 05:00:18.380
just to make things like a bit sweeter,

05:00:18.460 --> 05:00:21.900
like any support you are clipping or tweeting or retweeting,

05:00:21.900 --> 05:00:23.980
or you know, any support like that.

05:00:23.980 --> 05:00:28.060
It just, it feels a bit sweeter and that you are getting rewarded for it.

05:00:30.060 --> 05:00:31.740
I think the problem is more YouTube you already made.

05:00:31.740 --> 05:00:33.980
I definitely did make the 2K one,

05:00:33.980 --> 05:00:36.700
but I'll go back to the drawing board.

05:00:36.700 --> 05:00:37.660
It's not a problem.

05:00:37.660 --> 05:00:40.300
I'm going to do a tapping one with my fake nails,

05:00:40.300 --> 05:00:43.020
because fake nails sound awesome when it comes to tapping anymore.

05:00:43.980 --> 05:00:44.540
And strong.

05:00:44.540 --> 05:00:46.140
Your feet are still hot listening.

05:00:46.140 --> 05:00:46.780
Oh, don't.

05:00:46.780 --> 05:00:48.140
Oh, don't say it like that.

05:00:48.940 --> 05:00:49.900
Don't say it like that.

05:00:51.740 --> 05:00:55.580
And I'm basically that Mexican alien.

05:00:57.580 --> 05:01:03.100
And but yes, I am going to let you guys get redirected into mimosa.

05:01:03.100 --> 05:01:08.540
Please do consider hanging about for a couple of cheeky minutes or so,

05:01:08.540 --> 05:01:11.500
because she is very close to being monetized.

05:01:11.500 --> 05:01:13.660
She just needs to watch ours.

05:01:13.660 --> 05:01:16.540
So she's pushing herself for an endurance stream,

05:01:16.540 --> 05:01:24.780
which has made her a perfect target for my Borderlands 2 gameplay that I want to sort out.

05:01:24.780 --> 05:01:26.940
I want to see if I maybe get it done in July.

05:01:28.620 --> 05:01:30.620
Mimosa seems like a good candidate.

05:01:30.620 --> 05:01:34.620
I'm wondering if I could grab an endurance stream from VNU,

05:01:34.620 --> 05:01:38.300
and then an endurance streamer from Mythos.

05:01:38.300 --> 05:01:41.580
And then it could be like a really cool four way like get to know each other.

05:01:43.580 --> 05:01:46.540
There's been fucking VTubers are so nice to me, by the way.

05:01:46.540 --> 05:01:47.100
Holy shit.

05:01:47.100 --> 05:01:49.100
I've got another ASMR collab on the way.

05:01:50.380 --> 05:01:53.580
Turns out VTubers like are so kind and give you the time of day.

05:01:53.580 --> 05:01:57.900
Like I redirected into AcoNono.

05:01:57.900 --> 05:02:01.420
Did you see her little fucking call saying it was so good?

05:02:01.420 --> 05:02:02.060
I don't know.

05:02:02.060 --> 05:02:03.100
Sorry, not AcoNono.

05:02:03.100 --> 05:02:03.740
I don't know.

05:02:03.740 --> 05:02:04.540
With the bouquets.

05:02:04.860 --> 05:02:09.100
And she was like, I think Strongie is a cult fish and stuff.

05:02:09.100 --> 05:02:11.020
And then she followed me on Twitter and I'm like,

05:02:11.020 --> 05:02:13.260
Gee, Willy, Curse, you've got me blushing now.

05:02:13.260 --> 05:02:13.740
Stop it.

05:02:15.500 --> 05:02:17.180
But yeah, VTubers are so fucking nice.

05:02:17.180 --> 05:02:18.300
Sorry, I don't care where anyone says.

05:02:18.300 --> 05:02:19.420
I'll defend VTubers.

05:02:20.060 --> 05:02:20.940
Yeah, alias.

05:02:20.940 --> 05:02:22.380
Literally VTubers are so nice.

05:02:22.380 --> 05:02:22.940
I said it.

05:02:22.940 --> 05:02:23.580
I said it.

05:02:23.580 --> 05:02:24.060
They're nice.

05:02:24.060 --> 05:02:25.180
Everyone seems so nice to me.

05:02:25.180 --> 05:02:25.740
What the fuck?

05:02:25.740 --> 05:02:27.820
They're not like, oh sorry, that was my controller.

05:02:27.820 --> 05:02:28.780
They're not like, oh you whore.

05:02:28.780 --> 05:02:29.900
I don't want to interact with you.

05:02:29.900 --> 05:02:31.260
They're like, oh my god, it's you.

05:02:31.260 --> 05:02:32.860
Yeah, I'd love to do an ASMR collab.

05:02:32.860 --> 05:02:34.460
And I'm like, oh, it's so freaking cute.

05:02:34.460 --> 05:02:35.260
The yes chant.

05:02:35.260 --> 05:02:35.980
Yeah, it's for him.

05:02:37.660 --> 05:02:39.580
We love VTubers around these parts.

05:02:39.580 --> 05:02:40.620
Let's go.

05:02:40.620 --> 05:02:41.100
Yes.

05:02:41.100 --> 05:02:41.980
Okay.

05:02:41.980 --> 05:02:45.740
I am going to go offline and give me 15 minutes.

05:02:45.740 --> 05:02:47.180
I'm going to get some food down my gullet

05:02:47.180 --> 05:02:48.540
and I'm going to get a cup of tea

05:02:48.540 --> 05:02:52.220
and then I'll come back for a membership ASMR stream again

05:02:52.220 --> 05:02:53.980
where we can just babble away to each other.

05:02:55.420 --> 05:02:56.780
If you an alias collab.

05:02:56.780 --> 05:02:59.020
Oh, I've not even, I've not, it wasn't alias.

05:02:59.020 --> 05:03:02.220
I was actually someone else who I've never interacted with before.

05:03:02.860 --> 05:03:06.700
They agreed to that collab, but I don't know.

05:03:06.700 --> 05:03:08.620
Maybe I should be a cheeky shite and ask alias.

05:03:09.580 --> 05:03:09.900
I don't know.

05:03:09.900 --> 05:03:11.340
I feel like it's getting really cheeky now

05:03:11.340 --> 05:03:14.060
because I think that would be my 10th ass collab

05:03:14.060 --> 05:03:15.500
and only one is up right now.

05:03:15.500 --> 05:03:16.780
But it's because I need time to do it.

05:03:16.780 --> 05:03:18.300
And I don't, as far as I'm aware,

05:03:18.300 --> 05:03:20.380
I don't think any VTuber is like, oh my god,

05:03:20.380 --> 05:03:22.540
you've still not done, you've still not sent me your script.

05:03:22.540 --> 05:03:24.460
You've still not like edited it together.

05:03:24.460 --> 05:03:25.740
I don't think anyone's being cheeky.

05:03:25.740 --> 05:03:28.460
I'm like, I think they can see like how hard I'm trying elsewhere.

05:03:29.500 --> 05:03:30.620
And I'll get there slowly.

05:03:30.620 --> 05:03:32.220
Things will, things will go slowly.

05:03:33.420 --> 05:03:37.900
Um, V4, well, I was actually gonna start getting on at them

05:03:37.900 --> 05:03:40.540
because Dr. Nova was so nice to me as well.

05:03:40.540 --> 05:03:42.460
She was such a cutie, Batuti.

05:03:42.460 --> 05:03:45.020
She did like the spit thing with Shibi's mouth

05:03:45.020 --> 05:03:46.860
and I was like, that's honestly so creative.

05:03:46.860 --> 05:03:48.780
My brain could not even figure out how you did that.

05:03:49.660 --> 05:03:50.780
A perfectionist.

05:03:50.780 --> 05:03:52.300
Oh no, I'm not a perfectionist.

05:03:52.300 --> 05:03:55.020
It's because I've run out of time and I'm mentally exhausted.

05:03:55.020 --> 05:03:57.500
Like yesterday, I had a complete like,

05:03:58.540 --> 05:04:01.260
um, my body finally broke down,

05:04:01.340 --> 05:04:03.500
but in a good way that allowed me to sleep.

05:04:03.500 --> 05:04:06.060
So basically I finished the Umi Plus collab

05:04:06.060 --> 05:04:07.500
after my three streams that day,

05:04:07.500 --> 05:04:10.380
just, just feeling like a little bit of an overachiever there.

05:04:10.940 --> 05:04:18.940
Um, and then I did, um, I went straight to bed.

05:04:18.940 --> 05:04:20.540
I went straight to sleep.

05:04:20.540 --> 05:04:23.660
I slept for about five hours, woke up.

05:04:23.660 --> 05:04:27.260
I was like, I need to birth this loaf of bread right effing now.

05:04:27.260 --> 05:04:31.740
Did that, had a shower, ordered takeaway as I do normally.

05:04:33.500 --> 05:04:35.740
And then I passed out again until Microsoft.

05:04:35.740 --> 05:04:38.060
I woke up 10 minutes before Microsoft,

05:04:38.060 --> 05:04:40.300
but I've finally had a rest.

05:04:40.300 --> 05:04:42.540
Like, I don't feel that exhaustion

05:04:42.540 --> 05:04:45.180
that was looming over me for so long.

05:04:45.180 --> 05:04:46.620
Like, I don't feel it right now.

05:04:46.620 --> 05:04:47.660
I'm so freaking glad.

05:04:48.380 --> 05:04:49.260
How's the loaf?

05:04:49.260 --> 05:04:52.140
The loaf, um, yes, it's gone.

05:04:52.860 --> 05:04:53.660
The loaf is gone.

05:04:54.940 --> 05:04:56.460
Well, the spit in the air, she's crazy.

05:04:56.540 --> 05:04:58.220
There's a lot of very unique stuff apparently.

05:04:58.220 --> 05:05:00.220
Oh, right.

05:05:02.060 --> 05:05:04.540
No, no, finally taking care.

05:05:04.540 --> 05:05:07.420
It's, things are so, it's because there's so much chaos

05:05:07.420 --> 05:05:08.540
and start in the first month,

05:05:08.540 --> 05:05:10.860
but now that the first month like is over,

05:05:11.740 --> 05:05:15.180
um, we can actually do it.

05:05:17.340 --> 05:05:18.540
We can actually do it.

05:05:18.540 --> 05:05:20.460
We can actually like achieve all our,

05:05:20.460 --> 05:05:23.100
uh, missions and objectives and all of that.

05:05:23.100 --> 05:05:26.380
Like, oh, and like fucking hell,

05:05:26.380 --> 05:05:27.740
it's been like, well, hold on.

05:05:27.740 --> 05:05:29.500
I'm going to open up my YouTube stats right now.

05:05:30.620 --> 05:05:33.260
It's been a month of streaming

05:05:33.260 --> 05:05:38.060
and I have made 300,000 views on my content.

05:05:39.340 --> 05:05:41.020
And the month hasn't even finished.

05:05:41.020 --> 05:05:43.500
I mean, hell, maybe even be more to it, you know?

05:05:45.420 --> 05:05:48.380
Literally, I am over a quarter of a million views

05:05:48.380 --> 05:05:50.380
and I'm a new VTuber and it's been a month.

05:05:50.460 --> 05:05:52.860
Like, y'all know, y'all know.

05:05:53.900 --> 05:05:56.220
Uh, what does it say for subscribers?

05:05:56.220 --> 05:05:58.780
8,600, like it's the first month.

05:05:58.780 --> 05:05:59.660
This is insane.

05:05:59.660 --> 05:06:00.700
This is insanity.

05:06:01.420 --> 05:06:04.300
Um, so I definitely want to start pushing those ASMR videos

05:06:04.300 --> 05:06:06.220
out consistently because I don't want to,

05:06:06.220 --> 05:06:09.260
I don't want anyone thinking I'm taking like the PS

05:06:09.260 --> 05:06:10.220
when I'm doing it, you know?

05:06:11.500 --> 05:06:14.060
I thought she was about to say 300,000 dollars.

05:06:14.060 --> 05:06:16.300
Well, if I make 300,000 dollars,

05:06:16.300 --> 05:06:17.820
I'm happy to say that, yeah,

05:06:17.820 --> 05:06:19.260
Gentoon through your end production

05:06:19.260 --> 05:06:20.860
and no, I do not need to do a donathon.

05:06:22.860 --> 05:06:25.020
But yeah, for my birthday donathon,

05:06:25.020 --> 05:06:26.460
which is October 10th,

05:06:26.460 --> 05:06:32.700
my goals are pretty much set up to be agency-orientated.

05:06:33.900 --> 05:06:34.300
So yeah.

05:06:35.740 --> 05:06:37.580
Strangely, if you don't care yourself,

05:06:37.580 --> 05:06:38.540
you'll be mad.

05:06:38.540 --> 05:06:39.020
P.S.

05:06:39.820 --> 05:06:41.500
Considering it's you, I mean, that's surprising.

05:06:42.060 --> 05:06:43.420
It's because you put out four times

05:06:43.420 --> 05:06:44.460
the average amount of content,

05:06:44.460 --> 05:06:47.260
you get tons of views from your consistent viewer base.

05:06:47.260 --> 05:06:48.460
For again, I was getting worried,

05:06:48.460 --> 05:06:49.580
you guys aren't going to like stuff,

05:06:49.580 --> 05:06:50.540
but you always do.

05:06:50.540 --> 05:06:54.620
And I'm like, is this what unconditional love feels like?

05:06:54.620 --> 05:06:55.980
Oh, my heart.

05:06:55.980 --> 05:06:58.460
Oh, it made me cry.

05:06:59.660 --> 05:07:02.620
Um, I can't wait to see the birthday

05:07:02.620 --> 05:07:04.700
just to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood again.

05:07:04.700 --> 05:07:06.940
Honestly, I'm so, I'm so ready.

05:07:08.060 --> 05:07:09.580
Such a hard worker.

05:07:09.580 --> 05:07:12.060
I work hard because you guys won't beat me, okay?

05:07:13.900 --> 05:07:15.180
Did you see the Sheevee clip

05:07:15.180 --> 05:07:18.300
where she talked about all your fan bases,

05:07:18.300 --> 05:07:19.100
my wee wifling?

05:07:20.380 --> 05:07:22.060
All your wiflings are belong to us.

05:07:22.780 --> 05:07:25.020
You're a pretty likable person, thank yous,

05:07:25.020 --> 05:07:26.780
because I used to wipe ass in care homes.

05:07:27.500 --> 05:07:29.340
I mean, it humbles you very much

05:07:29.340 --> 05:07:31.900
when you wipe old lady ass, I have to admit.

05:07:31.900 --> 05:07:35.980
Or an old man gets a bone bone

05:07:35.980 --> 05:07:37.660
because you're having to change his diaper,

05:07:37.660 --> 05:07:38.380
so that's really fun.

05:07:39.340 --> 05:07:40.140
It really humbles you.

05:07:40.140 --> 05:07:43.020
It really gives you a very unique, strong personality, you know?

05:07:45.980 --> 05:07:48.940
Um, you could do a stream of watching paint dry

05:07:48.940 --> 05:07:49.980
and I'd probably watch it with you.

05:07:49.980 --> 05:07:51.260
Hey, let's do it.

05:07:51.260 --> 05:07:52.700
Shawnee, you need to learn that we love you.

05:07:52.700 --> 05:07:53.740
We love everything you do.

05:07:53.740 --> 05:07:55.420
Darling, that'll be nice to me.

05:07:56.140 --> 05:07:58.460
If we miss one stream, we miss a week's worth of yeah

05:07:58.460 --> 05:07:59.980
when it's compared to others.

05:07:59.980 --> 05:08:03.020
Well, you guys were telling me that people that do,

05:08:03.020 --> 05:08:04.460
that have membership,

05:08:04.460 --> 05:08:07.100
some people like do one membership stream a month.

05:08:07.100 --> 05:08:11.580
I'm like, this is an exchange of goods and services.

05:08:11.580 --> 05:08:14.620
You have to make the exchange of goods and services worth it.

05:08:15.340 --> 05:08:15.900
Don't you?

05:08:16.620 --> 05:08:18.300
All right, don't people move away

05:08:18.300 --> 05:08:20.620
if you don't make it worth their time, worth their whale?

05:08:23.660 --> 05:08:24.540
I wouldn't get humbled.

05:08:24.540 --> 05:08:26.780
I'm more like boosted, to be honest.

05:08:27.500 --> 05:08:29.820
I, I don't know if it's because I grew up

05:08:29.820 --> 05:08:31.900
looking after like cats and all of that.

05:08:32.620 --> 05:08:42.460
Um, that basically any puke cat or shat,

05:08:43.100 --> 05:08:44.380
it doesn't really faze me.

05:08:45.020 --> 05:08:47.580
And like, yeah, the thing,

05:08:47.580 --> 05:08:49.420
probably the thing that grosses me out

05:08:49.420 --> 05:08:51.260
is like a decomposing corpse.

05:08:51.260 --> 05:08:53.500
That's probably what would gross me out

05:08:53.500 --> 05:08:55.980
in terms of like body fluids and stuff.

05:08:55.980 --> 05:08:58.460
Like, I don't, this is kind of off topic,

05:08:58.460 --> 05:08:59.500
but um, you know,

05:08:59.500 --> 05:09:02.140
if you have a dementia patient in your care,

05:09:02.140 --> 05:09:06.700
it's actually quite common to do brown smearing,

05:09:07.420 --> 05:09:09.500
brown painting, if you will.

05:09:09.500 --> 05:09:10.940
It's actually quite common.

05:09:11.740 --> 05:09:12.940
Because when you have dementia,

05:09:12.940 --> 05:09:14.780
you lose, you don't understand what you're doing.

05:09:15.660 --> 05:09:16.780
And it's just a wee shame.

05:09:16.780 --> 05:09:19.020
And like when, you know,

05:09:19.020 --> 05:09:21.020
for example, when I entered the room,

05:09:21.020 --> 05:09:24.060
you know, you go, you get shocked at first

05:09:24.060 --> 05:09:25.180
and then you're like, wait,

05:09:25.180 --> 05:09:27.980
if I don't clean up this, this person,

05:09:27.980 --> 05:09:29.500
you know, they're going to be,

05:09:29.500 --> 05:09:31.180
you know, sitting in this situation

05:09:31.180 --> 05:09:31.980
and it's not nice.

05:09:31.980 --> 05:09:33.340
So you do the right thing

05:09:33.340 --> 05:09:35.500
and you know, you put your protective gear on

05:09:35.500 --> 05:09:37.820
and you get to work and make sure they're all showered

05:09:37.820 --> 05:09:39.580
and fresh sheets and all that.

05:09:39.580 --> 05:09:40.700
And you just get to it.

05:09:40.700 --> 05:09:42.060
That's, it's just how it is.

05:09:42.140 --> 05:09:43.180
It's very straightforward.

05:09:43.180 --> 05:09:44.220
I know it can be quite,

05:09:46.860 --> 05:09:48.060
quite daunting, I guess,

05:09:48.060 --> 05:09:50.220
maybe if the first time you're ever tasked with it,

05:09:50.220 --> 05:09:53.340
but it makes you realize like, look, yeah,

05:09:53.340 --> 05:09:54.380
okay, it's a bit gross.

05:09:54.380 --> 05:09:55.580
Yeah, it doesn't smell nice.

05:09:55.580 --> 05:09:57.900
No one's expected it to smell

05:09:57.900 --> 05:09:59.500
like marshmallow fluff or whatever.

05:09:59.500 --> 05:10:01.740
But yeah, you know, you just,

05:10:01.740 --> 05:10:02.460
you just go for it.

05:10:02.460 --> 05:10:04.460
You do the right, you do the best you can.

05:10:08.460 --> 05:10:11.660
Yeah, dementia decline has actually tried it.

05:10:11.660 --> 05:10:13.740
Yeah, it's, it's pretty fucking rough.

05:10:13.740 --> 05:10:14.380
I have to admit.

05:10:15.340 --> 05:10:17.740
Maui, Maui Gran had a fall

05:10:17.740 --> 05:10:19.580
and a lot of sickness followed.

05:10:19.580 --> 05:10:21.020
I don't know what it is.

05:10:21.020 --> 05:10:22.460
Well, I don't know what it is.

05:10:22.460 --> 05:10:26.620
Basically, old person has fall deteriorates rapidly.

05:10:26.620 --> 05:10:28.940
More news at three is the most common way

05:10:28.940 --> 05:10:30.620
that an old person pops or clogs.

05:10:30.620 --> 05:10:31.100
I don't know.

05:10:31.100 --> 05:10:31.980
Well, I don't know why

05:10:31.980 --> 05:10:33.580
because it's like a shock to the system

05:10:33.580 --> 05:10:35.020
and the body can't repair.

05:10:35.020 --> 05:10:37.100
I think they say after the age of 30,

05:10:37.100 --> 05:10:39.180
your body no longer is growing

05:10:39.180 --> 05:10:40.220
and becoming a new.

05:10:40.220 --> 05:10:43.180
It's just focusing on repair and maintenance

05:10:43.180 --> 05:10:44.220
beyond like 30.

05:10:46.380 --> 05:10:48.220
Did anyone paint anything cool?

05:10:48.220 --> 05:10:49.420
One, that's funny too.

05:10:49.420 --> 05:10:50.140
Shut the fuck up.

05:10:53.420 --> 05:10:55.340
The fact that you could do it is commendable.

05:10:55.340 --> 05:10:56.380
I've seen the bad parents.

05:10:57.260 --> 05:10:59.580
Like honestly, if you ever like have to be the caretaker

05:10:59.580 --> 05:11:00.700
of someone with dementia,

05:11:00.700 --> 05:11:02.860
don't ever feel bad if you have to put them in a care home.

05:11:02.860 --> 05:11:04.860
Like I know there's so many stories

05:11:04.860 --> 05:11:07.420
that come out about care homes being bad at this and that.

05:11:07.420 --> 05:11:09.980
I promise you at the forefront of care homes,

05:11:09.980 --> 05:11:12.300
there are people who genuinely have the willpower

05:11:12.300 --> 05:11:14.460
and the care, like they do genuinely care

05:11:14.460 --> 05:11:15.660
and try their best.

05:11:15.660 --> 05:11:17.980
The problem is the greedy corporations

05:11:17.980 --> 05:11:20.700
that purposely understaff entire units.

05:11:20.700 --> 05:11:23.340
I think my worst ever shift was like

05:11:24.380 --> 05:11:28.540
to people to over 50 residents on one floor.

05:11:29.100 --> 05:11:32.060
Like, no, it's not possible.

05:11:33.020 --> 05:11:34.460
It's not possible.

05:11:34.460 --> 05:11:35.420
So, yeah.

05:11:36.380 --> 05:11:40.060
Yeah, as you age, you get worse at healing

05:11:40.060 --> 05:11:41.340
and in the case of the elderly,

05:11:41.340 --> 05:11:43.260
falling loss of balance is like just,

05:11:43.260 --> 05:11:44.620
yeah, like fricking straight up.

05:11:45.420 --> 05:11:46.620
Hey, strongy, you done with gaming?

05:11:46.620 --> 05:11:48.700
I'm so sorry, MLG did it.

05:11:48.700 --> 05:11:54.220
The Microsoft was supposedly supposed to be eight hours,

05:11:54.220 --> 05:11:56.220
but that was a game developers assessment.

05:11:56.220 --> 05:11:57.500
So they were wrong.

05:11:57.500 --> 05:11:58.300
They were wrong.

05:12:01.420 --> 05:12:03.660
I've seen nurses in care homes mistreat the elderly.

05:12:03.660 --> 05:12:05.180
I would never have put my parents in one.

05:12:05.180 --> 05:12:06.620
It's like such a hard balance

05:12:06.620 --> 05:12:08.860
because to get at home health is not easy.

05:12:08.860 --> 05:12:09.500
It's not cheap.

05:12:09.500 --> 05:12:12.700
It's not even viable for a lot of people.

05:12:12.700 --> 05:12:16.060
However, I think with the rise

05:12:16.060 --> 05:12:18.700
of multi-generational households,

05:12:19.340 --> 05:12:23.500
I think that is going to be a very lovely solution.

05:12:25.180 --> 05:12:29.500
I would very much like to see in my lifetime

05:12:29.500 --> 05:12:32.860
the rise of multi-generational households again

05:12:32.860 --> 05:12:35.020
or very close-knit communities again.

05:12:35.580 --> 05:12:37.100
Gardening, I'm going to see that picked up

05:12:37.100 --> 05:12:39.340
so we start relying on the big supermarkets.

05:12:40.140 --> 05:12:42.300
But anyway, before I put my tinfoil hat on,

05:12:42.300 --> 05:12:44.380
how about we redirect into mimosa?

05:12:44.380 --> 05:12:45.900
I'll get some food in my tum tum

05:12:45.900 --> 05:12:49.100
and I will put up my membership ASMR stream

05:12:49.100 --> 05:12:50.460
in 10 minutes time.

05:12:50.460 --> 05:12:51.420
Give me 10 minutes.

05:12:53.260 --> 05:12:55.660
Make a salt was, it was good.

05:12:55.660 --> 05:12:58.700
I may have perished in the lava by accident.

05:12:59.500 --> 05:13:03.660
And I also bumrushed the last mission, which didn't work.

05:13:06.300 --> 05:13:07.180
Did you get your game?

05:13:07.180 --> 05:13:10.300
No, the way I type in game and then how long?

05:13:10.300 --> 05:13:12.220
So I literally type in mech assault, how long?

05:13:12.220 --> 05:13:14.140
And I'm pretty sure if you type it in Google right now,

05:13:14.140 --> 05:13:15.420
it says eight hours.

05:13:15.420 --> 05:13:17.260
Oh my God, what happens if we type the same thing

05:13:17.260 --> 05:13:18.620
on Google at the same time, right?

05:13:18.620 --> 05:13:21.500
Mech assault, how long Google?

05:13:23.820 --> 05:13:27.660
Main story, seven hours and 44 minutes.

05:13:29.660 --> 05:13:31.340
Uh-huh, that's right.

05:13:31.340 --> 05:13:34.620
And I did it in five, I think, roughly five.

05:13:37.420 --> 05:13:40.220
There's a site called how long to be, exactly.

05:13:40.220 --> 05:13:41.980
It's gonna be a membership tinfoil ASMR.

05:13:41.980 --> 05:13:43.500
Honestly, it does may take me long.

05:13:43.500 --> 05:13:45.180
It does may take me long to get started.

05:13:46.060 --> 05:13:48.860
Okay, she's a gamer.

05:13:48.860 --> 05:13:50.060
Oh my God, wait, what's this?

05:13:50.060 --> 05:13:51.260
What's the speed run?

05:13:52.140 --> 05:13:56.460
Mech assault, speed run, world, world record.

05:13:57.420 --> 05:14:00.940
Let's see if my, can I be the first person to submit for it?

05:14:04.460 --> 05:14:07.900
No, wait, I can be seventh place, shut up.

05:14:09.980 --> 05:14:13.260
How can someone defeat the game in 59 minutes?

05:14:14.300 --> 05:14:17.180
Whoever the fuck you are, elite two heroes,

05:14:17.180 --> 05:14:19.260
I'm coming for your British ass.

05:14:19.260 --> 05:14:22.380
Fucking 59 minutes, it took me five hours.

05:14:22.380 --> 05:14:23.660
Right, I'm going for seventh place.

05:14:23.660 --> 05:14:25.660
I'm gonna submit myself for mech assault, thanks.

05:14:26.860 --> 05:14:29.820
And ironically making strongy cuttles right now on speedrun.com.

05:14:32.460 --> 05:14:34.140
Speedrunners are insane.

05:14:34.140 --> 05:14:36.860
Seventh place gamer, yay, I'm seventh place.

05:14:36.860 --> 05:14:38.300
Let's go, seventh place.

05:14:39.660 --> 05:14:40.860
I'm just glad we did it.

05:14:41.500 --> 05:14:42.300
Let's go.

05:14:42.300 --> 05:14:44.700
Oh, elite two, viewer has their YouTube video link.

05:14:44.700 --> 05:14:47.340
Ah, I bet you're using cheats.

05:14:47.340 --> 05:14:48.220
I'm gonna watch that.

05:14:48.220 --> 05:14:49.100
I'm gonna be annoyed.

05:14:49.100 --> 05:14:51.900
She's in the top, I'm top seventh on mech assault.

05:14:53.420 --> 05:14:55.580
I'll tell my, I can tell my dad that.

05:14:55.580 --> 05:14:56.300
Where's my phone?

05:14:56.300 --> 05:14:57.500
Oh, my phone's not here.

05:14:58.060 --> 05:15:00.860
I'll tell my dad that I got the seventh world record

05:15:00.860 --> 05:15:02.700
on mech assault purely on the basis

05:15:02.700 --> 05:15:04.380
that no one has submitted for it.

05:15:06.540 --> 05:15:08.220
And then he'll be mega proud of me.

05:15:10.460 --> 05:15:11.900
I just checked and it's seven.

05:15:13.900 --> 05:15:15.100
Yeah, hell yeah.

05:15:15.740 --> 05:15:19.100
Okay, right, before I continue yappening

05:15:19.100 --> 05:15:20.380
all your ears off again.

05:15:20.380 --> 05:15:21.980
So yeah, literally top 10, same top,

05:15:21.980 --> 05:15:23.900
maybe I won't say seventh, I'll say top 10.

05:15:23.900 --> 05:15:26.540
I'll be like, I'll talk, I'm top 10 speaker on record me,

05:15:26.540 --> 05:15:27.340
but what do you mean?

05:15:27.340 --> 05:15:29.740
And I'll be like, yes, well,

05:15:31.020 --> 05:15:33.980
I'm gonna watch him take first place tomorrow, honestly.

05:15:34.700 --> 05:15:36.860
He would probably do that way faster than me.

05:15:38.220 --> 05:15:40.780
Right, as I said, I'm gonna end stream.

05:15:40.780 --> 05:15:42.620
It's gonna redirect you into mimosa.

05:15:42.620 --> 05:15:46.220
For those of you who are a member of Strony Cottle's channel,

05:15:46.220 --> 05:15:48.860
I am about to take a 10 minute rest

05:15:48.860 --> 05:15:50.380
to get some food in my belly.

05:15:50.380 --> 05:15:52.940
And then we're gonna do membership ASMR.

05:15:52.940 --> 05:15:54.460
And I'll get all booted up for that, okay?

05:15:55.260 --> 05:15:58.460
So I will see you tomorrow for some Beltro,

05:15:58.460 --> 05:15:59.660
which is two hours later,

05:15:59.660 --> 05:16:03.260
or I will see you in 10 minutes for membership ASMR.

05:16:03.260 --> 05:16:05.180
Thank you so so much for keeping me company

05:16:05.180 --> 05:16:07.340
through an insane childhood game,

05:16:07.340 --> 05:16:09.900
a childhood game, so childhoody,

05:16:09.900 --> 05:16:13.340
that I actually wasn't even able to play it at the time

05:16:13.340 --> 05:16:14.780
because I was so small and tiny.

05:16:17.100 --> 05:16:21.180
Okay, imagine checking the speed runner list

05:16:21.260 --> 05:16:24.940
and finding you lost to a watermelon cuttlefish, honestly.

05:16:24.940 --> 05:16:25.820
Okay, right, bye-bye.

05:16:25.820 --> 05:16:27.340
Thank you so much for the stream, Reflanks.

05:16:27.340 --> 05:16:28.940
I'll see you very very shortly.

05:16:28.940 --> 05:16:29.580
And have a nice day.

05:16:29.580 --> 05:16:31.580
Remember to hydrate and eat and stretch

05:16:31.580 --> 05:16:33.660
so you don't have any problems with your booty hole.

05:16:33.660 --> 05:16:33.980
Okay?

05:16:34.700 --> 05:16:35.980
Bye, Reflanks.

05:16:35.980 --> 05:16:37.340
See you tomorrow.

05:16:37.340 --> 05:16:38.140
Bye.

05:16:43.580 --> 05:16:44.220
Are you gonna tongue it?

05:16:46.380 --> 05:16:47.900
Imagine if I said goodbye like that.

05:16:48.540 --> 05:16:52.220
Oh, my spit's going everywhere.

05:16:52.220 --> 05:16:53.820
Sorry, I'm salivating.

05:16:53.820 --> 05:16:54.620
Sorry.

05:16:54.620 --> 05:16:55.260
Okay, bye.

05:16:55.260 --> 05:16:57.100
See you on mimosa or see you in 10 minutes.
