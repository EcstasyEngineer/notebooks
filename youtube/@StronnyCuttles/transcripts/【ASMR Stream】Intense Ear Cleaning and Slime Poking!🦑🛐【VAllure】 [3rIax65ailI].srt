1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm supposed to blue play as a- I live noise game, noise filter.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First thing first, I need to get close. I can't accept.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What was your name again?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It seems like your ears, oh dear, are a little bit cloned up, Mr. Wiefling.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let me just inspect this ear. Oh dear, that's good.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mr. Wiefling always really cloned up here.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh dear, and now let me check your other ear, Mr. Wiefling.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do I sound muffled in this ear as well? Oh dear, there's something obstructing your ear canal.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, that's my, I mustn't sound so muffled.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh wow, nurse, re-in, nurse, I see. Just came to our ear cleaning suite with our assistants, the snowberries, thank you.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright, okay, I think I know what to start with.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I feel like, oh sorry, Mr. Wiefling, you're not a little feeling your client at my ear cleaning facility.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, first thing first, we're going to do is listen to the wax that's stuck in your ears.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It has an anti-fat-packed properties because ear wax is a pretty fatty substance, so just going to spray over your ear.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't worry, it's wet, so it's not, it's cool.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, then for this ear, Mr. Wiefling, do you feel like that did anything for you?

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or do you need a bit more, I think you need a bit more ear, oh dear.

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, now that the solution on your ear, I'm just going to dry every single ear canal.

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, your actual ear and the earwax, because I don't want you dripping my Mr. Wiefling, that's not very appropriate for this thing.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, dear, dear, but I still sound a little old.

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are probably the worst case I've seen in a while.

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you listening with headphones on?

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is your day job maybe working at a PC?

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let me see, not so good.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Not so good at all.

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This sound has just gotten off of my focusing.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What the?

29
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Right, I've taken off the fucking noise gate, back to the roleplay boys.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh dear.

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, I think you may be wearing a lot of headphones, because this is the most clogged ears I've seen in a very long time.

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, your ear is now clean at all.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to do this check here and canal and see if I can remove any debris at this point.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But that is very tightly packed in.

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How do you think we should get rid of a good maybe ears?

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A Japanese ear cleaning tool in combination.

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is quite the challenge today, Mr. Wiefling.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just checking.

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Definitely a solid mass over your ear.

40
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I assume this ear is going to be the exact same story.

41
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh yeah.

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think what we'll have to do is do this day by day.

43
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just take out a little bit.

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But the procedure shouldn't take more than 12 minutes, okay?

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So don't worry, I won't steal too much of your time.

46
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sure you're a very busy man, Mr. Wiefling.

47
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I'm just going to try and dislodge some of the ear.

48
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It should be hard again.

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's see if this tool will offer a bit more texture here.

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Here.

51
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm just removing what I can very delicately because I don't want to hurt your ear.

52
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you'll need to tell me in the hearts, okay?

53
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because we don't want no problem.

54
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This isn't easy.

55
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

56
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We're getting somewhere, Mr. Wiefling.

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Getting somewhere.

58
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, you work in an ink factory, Mr. Wiefling.

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's a curious job.

60
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you do when you work in the ink factory?

61
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Definitely get some work done.

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That was painful, wasn't it?

63
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Your ears are already feeling some relief.

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I've actually not even cleaned one ear out fully yet.

65
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I've still muffled so you guys are jumping ahead of the roleplay.

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hold on.

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's gone in your ear.

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've put it in a creepy patch, isn't it?

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You feel the ink machine?

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, you feel the ink machine?

71
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, I guess it probably runs on some sort of liquid that is high in vitamin D extract.

72
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know if you guys will forget.

73
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

74
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, you have Associates, Mr. Wiefling, that work in the production of the ink as well.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It sounds like a very efficient factory.

76
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's quite a good job.

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
My job is to have one that I close pretty quickly.

78
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, of course I have my lovelaces.

79
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You did my appointment with the license.

80
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wow.

81
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I've almost got it actually. Hold on.

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I've literally almost got this ear clean.

83
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're very close.

84
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Very close to getting this ear dislodged.

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

86
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But we have to be super gentle because I don't want to hurt you.

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, I think it's coming.

88
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you hear me now, Mr. Wiefling?

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Did that work?

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think it did.

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hold on. Let me just spray down your ear again.

92
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just so...

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wow.

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's perfect.

95
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There we go. Let me just quickly rub down your ear.

96
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And then we will tackle the other one here.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, that's great.

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm glad you feel relief in this ear.

99
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm just going to make sure to brush away all the debris because it might sound like your hearing is completely back.

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But your baseline, Mr. Wiefling, was very low.

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I'm just going to make sure to brush away any nastiness that may have been left over, okay?

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Because we don't want any nastiness.

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I just had a cat here in your ear.

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you have a cat, Mr. Wiefling?

105
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you have two cats?

106
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are their names?

107
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wow. Okay, that's probably all the dust.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And then we're super careful.

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just gently gently rub that.

111
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, this ear, I think, I'm just going to take another look into it.

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But it looks pretty clear to me.

113
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will come back to it just in case.

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But unfortunately, this ear is still very much full and muffled.

115
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's see what we can do over here.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, oh, you don't have a cat, Mr. Wiefling, but you had named them after the Fieler Girls.

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or unfortunately, I'm not familiar with the Fieler Girls.

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Would you like to describe in great detail who or what the Fieler Girls are?

119
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Whilst I clean up this very troublesome ear of yours.

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just, again, just tell me if there's any pain and I'll stop.

121
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I definitely don't want to hurt you.

122
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, that's bad.

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My cat's name is Wandalabism.

124
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Interesting name for a cat.

125
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I wonder, did you come up with that by yourself?

126
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay, there's no pain. Good.

127
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm just trying to pick apart the large nerves and then I can actually clean your ears.

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh my goodness, this is, you're just tasting me.

129
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is the most difficult case I've had in very long time.

130
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It keeps the ear clean, yeah.

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So, Mr. Wiefling, you're having a tingly experience.

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, that's good.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
My ear tingles can be quite relaxing.

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Maybe you can give me a pack for some tickles, we are.

135
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
One of them has warm and colored hair. It's totally not safe.

136
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, one interesting girl group this sense.

137
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's a very cute little sister type and also our mummy is pretty hot.

138
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, this sense of a very interesting girl.

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And it sounds like the guava base is covered.

140
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Mr. Wiefling, did I hear you correctly?

141
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You asked me to smell your ears.

142
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, this one's blocked, so I can't really tell you, but...

143
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Interesting.

144
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, the good news is you don't have any signs of infection because you can smell it.

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I didn't smell any signs of infection.

146
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just need to get this.

147
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And almost there, I really am.

148
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I swear you have some very difficult ears.

149
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hold on, let me get on you too, because I don't think this is working as well as I had hoped.

150
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wow.

151
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, that was quite loud over here.

152
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We're getting there. We're almost there, Mr. Wiefling.

153
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And then you can finally hear me and my family.

154
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

155
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think I got it.

156
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Hello, Mr. Wiefling. How can you hear me?

157
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's going well.

158
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I just need to make sure there's no remnants, because there might be some left over.

159
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Gunk is always, but I sound a little clearer.

160
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, there we go.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Clear, clear.

162
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think everything sounds clear now. That's good, Mr. Wiefling and glad.

163
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay, just a quick brush up to make sure that you don't have any more dust or dirt in them.

164
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You should begin to go.

165
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, I forgot to spray you a little bit, sir. You don't mind if I spray on you, right?

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There we go. Just tap the over here so that it's not bled on.

167
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then give you a little brush brush.

168
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There we go.

169
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wow.

170
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think so, and while I'm here, never hand in a Scottish Dome.

171
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, I think we did it. Your ears, Mr. Wiefling, appear clean.

172
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Very clean.

173
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay, goodbye.

174
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you so much for your attendance at the care clinic.

175
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I hope you had a good day and that all of your issues have been resolved now.

176
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
For the matter of payment, you have to give me one kiss.

177
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Mr. Wiefling, I said you have to give me one kiss.

178
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You need to kiss me. Kiss me.

179
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon, my little Wiefling.

180
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Did you like my cringey roleplay? I thought I did a pretty good job.

181
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I have a confession reference. I accidentally don't want someone yesterday.

182
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I'm 99% sure.

183
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, pardon me.

184
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, pardon me.

185
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think it was dimsul. I don't want to hold you yesterday.

186
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Your dad is going to be even more confused when you claim you have five dollars. That makes him a granddad.

187
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was good. Yeah, you liked it. Did you like it? You were all muffled.

188
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I wonder if I have a roleplay like that coming out soon.

189
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I said thank you for $2,000. Can I pay again?

190
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Being called Mr. Wiefling makes me feel like a big shot. I also must have lost the address.

191
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And then let me just check the...

192
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, of course it doesn't work, so I need to go into my own life struggle.

193
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What? That's me.

194
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait, why is it not displaying?

195
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then thank you very much, Brightgo for the day and gifted memberships. We appreciate you.

196
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And congrats to all the Wieflings that caught one. Be nice and say thank you.

197
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
John07, thank you for becoming a member.

198
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Vanished, thank you for becoming a member.

199
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Rockstar, the Avril Fluff, Jupro, Mamosa.

200
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mamosa became a member. When did you do that?

201
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Type N and Tiki, thank you also for becoming a member. What the heck?

202
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm so sorry, you little Wieflings, I'm exhausted.

203
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm okay, but I have nine toenails now.

204
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, floss, thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate you.

205
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't remember when Mamosa became a member.

206
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you so much for becoming a member.

207
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I apologize about any yawns or complaints of pain.

208
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm online pain killers, but I'm surviving. It's not a big deal.

209
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Am I allowed to say the story or pour one out from all me the toenail?

210
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You were sacrificed in the name of pretty feet and you went out the way mommy wanted ya to be sexy.

211
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I definitely need a big sleep. I did get one, but I think it's one of those.

212
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I need rest and recovery sleep.

213
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The pointy tool was a bit surprising. I definitely felt that going into my tool.

214
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I felt that basically once they tested if I could feel anything, once it came through and I was like, no, I don't feel anything.

215
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They got to work and they said, lie back, you don't want to see this.

216
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's currently covered up right now and I need to change it in less than 48 hours so I get to see what the damage is.

217
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They've given me a medical bag of gauze and everything to take away, but I know how to clean and change bandages.

218
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's not a big deal.

219
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Whatever you want to call it.

220
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Strongly the one K.A smart video was amazing. You liked it.

221
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll need a check actually.

222
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So YouTube put limited ads on my let me hold it video and then I was like, I'll find that's fair because of the content.

223
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But on a whim, I applied to get limited ad taken off it and they gave me it.

224
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So I've just lost like 40,000 views worth of like generated ad revenue that would have paid for that artwork.

225
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it.

226
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, chat is so great.

227
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Abba tea, abba dye, rip strongy feet fans, well she be and Emma work again.

228
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So you don't have to worry.

229
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But I apologize for yours. I am a very sleepy baby.

230
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But we are going also. Thank you.

231
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I say for the rage goodness gravy. I can't.

232
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Sorry. I've only takes off.

233
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'll just pop you down in my lap.

234
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I've literally sweat up and only takes off.

235
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's so damp in here.

236
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I was trying to do the roleplay right.

237
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I can't take it. I can't get it.

238
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's not okay. This is so wet.

239
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What?

240
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Would you never do a ridicule again?

241
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh, I have no intention of doing one.

242
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Like I was going to do for a month on a phone.

243
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I was going to do like these pictures and be like this says for feet people only.

244
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah, feet people ain't getting fit.

245
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Nothing. Nothing.

246
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
My hair looks like watermelon candy.

247
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Heck yeah, it does.

248
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
A story called ACMA.

249
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I've said this before but they were called the twins in development.

250
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Or I dubbed them the twins in development.

251
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Why you ask? Because I don't know.

252
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It just came naturally to me to call them the twins.

253
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They are called.

254
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How much for the glove?

255
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's so sweaty and it's terrible.

256
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
My hand can breathe now.

257
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But I also have this box of like weird bailet slime.

258
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't, let me get it.

259
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I was going to bet it.

260
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

261
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Even if I had to ASMR stream.

262
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

263
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I bought this weird box of slime.

264
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hold on.

265
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What?

266
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's so good.

267
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It sounds really bad but I just have all my figurines

268
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
wink wink on display in this room.

269
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay, Bono has got that light plastic on it.

270
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm going to turn down the volume.

271
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm going to cut the slime.

272
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The black.

273
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay, I think I can fit the volume up again.

274
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What the fuck is this?

275
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So I was supposed to put this on your ear.

276
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Did you hear what this is?

277
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, it's sticky.

278
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
This isn't slime all.

279
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I was supposed to put it on your ear.

280
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Just even make a noise.

281
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Do you hear that?

282
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It sounds like nothing is shit.

283
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to scum ass.

284
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Mommy, I always thought that you are that person

285
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
to interview the girls.

286
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Did that sexual harassment?

287
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Wait, so does this slime not do anything?

288
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Wait, hold on.

289
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm taking my headset off so I can hear it.

290
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh my god, it's so sticky.

291
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Why?

292
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's going everywhere as well.

293
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm going to have to clean all of this.

294
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The future person must not stream live.

295
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Click, no clickbait.

296
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay, I'm just going to use my finger.

297
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Hold on.

298
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's on me now.

299
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What does that sound like?

300
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Do you hear it just sounds like

301
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
slightly sticky sounds?

302
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I paid like all $12 for this.

303
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I don't know, maybe it's one of those tingle sounds

304
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that are better for like layering with other ASMR.

305
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Like this.

306
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
How's Gimli?

307
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Actually, Fiko snuck in at the room.

308
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He's not supposed to be in here.

309
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And this freaking tail was hanging off the window

310
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
literally like three minutes before moving upstream.

311
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I was like, get it out.

312
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because they're not supposed to be in this room at all.

313
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because I've got far too much equipment in here.

314
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, it's kind of low.

315
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wow, it just kind of sounds like plastic.

316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, it's supposed to kill my hands.

317
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's supposed to kill my nose.

318
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, we're done.

319
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'll just put it on this used napkin from a week ago.

320
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll record with it.

321
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Maybe I can use it as a layer to take an experience.

322
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
$12.

323
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Let me hold it.

324
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Let me.

325
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, yucky.

326
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, there's like a residue on my hands now.

327
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh.

328
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I actually...

329
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Sorry, I'm trying to get the residue on my hands.

330
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
How much for that napkin?

331
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's not real. It's not my own.

332
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's like both my pinkies are all black.

333
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Okay.

334
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'll put it on for more e-paste.

335
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You don't need to go on a page for more.

336
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Right, where's my...

337
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh, here it is.

338
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
My god.

339
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's my little...

340
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't know if you guys like tapping like that.

341
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Just testing your hearing now after your little...

342
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Is today the watch along?

343
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It should be unless I completely messed up.

344
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I actually had to leave.

345
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I was putting up my streams for the week.

346
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then I was like, oh, should I slow?

347
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I have to go for my doctor's appointment.

348
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So I just disappeared.

349
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And all I've got up is...

350
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Wait, I've up at the...

351
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah.

352
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's a Transformers...

353
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Autobots...

354
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Fallout.

355
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's like both lane.

356
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

357
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We're watching Transformers.

358
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The first one with Sam Webuki.

359
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So congrats if your name is...

360
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's scheduled for 4.15pm.

361
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That is probably why it's at the horrifically wrong time.

362
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It should be 6.15am.

363
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Lol.

364
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay, I've just updated the member watch along.

365
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Does it look right on your hand now?

366
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Smile.

367
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think I've put the wrong time for the Minish Cap as well.

368
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Actually, hold on.

369
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, I've put 4pm instead of 4am for the Minish Cap.

370
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Don't mess.

371
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm not very brave, am I?

372
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I can't wait to show you guys.

373
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Actually, I'll show you right now.

374
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, no, I can't.

375
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because I don't think I have a...

376
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Transformers...

377
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
AC...

378
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
What the fuck, AC?

379
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Call her again, Ben.

380
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What?

381
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Is AC's Twitter down?

382
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
AC, what did you do?

383
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Your account is logged after a careful review.

384
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
With the damage your account broke, some brails on Twitter.

385
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Your account is read only movement tunes.

386
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can't pause, read post-release content.

387
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Most accounts regain fill access in a week, but it could take longer.

388
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AC, what did she do?

389
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
What the fuck did she do, yeah?

390
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know what it feels like?

391
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What?

392
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm sorry if you heard that.

393
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I wanted to shut my thumbnails off.

394
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ready?

395
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
She became too powerful, actually.

396
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
She told the pot to keep itself safe in Minecraft.

397
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Okay.

398
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, sorry, I'm rubbing my eyes.

399
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Mommy's tired and trying her best to transform her stream.

400
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's gonna be so close.

401
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm, like, warning you all that.

402
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Sorry.

403
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, my eyes are...

404
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Actually, no.

405
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Sorry.

406
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What?

407
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Gosh.

408
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Like, these pretty eyes don't come without a downside.

409
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay.

410
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Image.

411
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Refling.

412
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Uh, Elden Rain.

413
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
What do you guys think about my thumbnail?

414
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Let's open it.

415
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What do you think?

416
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It is pretty good.

417
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Like, there's two good reflings and then one bad invader refling.

418
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And then I have a pot on my head because of that guy that always kills that girl with a pot on his head.

419
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And then, for the next thumbnail, you guys are defending me.

420
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Look, invaders go in first.

421
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And then the two good reflings are in front of me.

422
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And then I'm buying just you up in my head, all like...

423
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
See, you guys are keeping me safe.

424
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It's great.

425
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm glad you think so.

426
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Wow.

427
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let me solo her.

428
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes, that's the name. Let me solo her.

429
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So, I'm going to hopefully have my heart rate shock collar set up.

430
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So, every time I cause us to lose of height, you guys get to shock me and you get to see when.

431
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I don't know how to set up the when thing.

432
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't know if I could collectively get you all to make to the anticipation and whatever reflings is.

433
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You know, shock first, that shock.

434
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Am I leaking again?

435
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Leaking what?

436
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We can all solo Strony.

437
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I just get in the lane.

438
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Get that premium pass.

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Then I put it up a PC.

440
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Because I need me to get that Fortnay Baobass.

441
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Falk Niel Lar. Yes, I thought it through.

442
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you going to set up a group password?

443
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Of course.

444
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I think the password is four layers long.

445
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, maybe we'll put like...

446
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Fair for green and French.

447
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And then Fortnay Baobass.

448
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Do you start immediately for the watch along or for...

449
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Elden, right?

450
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
There's a 15 minute break after this ASMR because I need to swap my microphones around.

451
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Because I'm using my 3Dio right now.

452
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But I use an SMB7.

453
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And that's when you can hear...

454
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, actually the 3Dio shows you how echoey the room is.

455
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, I forgot to make a T.

456
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Trat.

457
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Did you see Emmy Shulker's self on the watch along?

458
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I did not.

459
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I've kind of said this before.

460
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The only thing I...

461
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Not dislike.

462
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, I guess it's dislike.

463
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't have time to watch the streams.

464
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I have time to watch Mersi.

465
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because what happens normally after a stream?

466
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll get a T and record what I need to record.

467
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And all that.

468
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And plan what I need to do.

469
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I've recorded 3 ASMR collabs.

470
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So, I'm editing Mamosa's first.

471
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Because it's super simple and easy.

472
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There's not even like 4 minutes of dialogue.

473
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But I made the biggest mistake of trying to record during the freaking day.

474
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It was like car after car after car.

475
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But I caught some of Mersi's karaoke.

476
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And oh my god, I want to do her karaoke.

477
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You know the guy that goes,

478
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I want to do her karaoke right now.

479
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Because of Mersi.

480
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
She was just so fun.

481
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And she was singing the most adorable songs.

482
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And it was so precious.

483
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So, I'm really excited to...

484
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
She made some fun noises.

485
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And I think you will too.

486
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And me and Freak, she probably liked that.

487
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But I'm going to see if I can do karaoke next week.

488
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I can't remember what.

489
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So next week is the last of June.

490
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And I wanted to wrap up RuneScape.

491
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And I wanted to finish Elden Ring.

492
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But the problem is they're both insurances.

493
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The voice is breaking.

494
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Shit.

495
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I was like, I want to go back on Skyrim.

496
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Because I fixed the achievements on Skyrim.

497
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So we can actually play through the game properly.

498
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And not get distracted.

499
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I'm so unprofessional.

500
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
There's genuinely...

501
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm not being funny if there's a vampire out there.

502
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Going to me a favor and infect me.

503
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Because if I didn't need to sleep, the content that would be cooked.

504
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
She loved it.

505
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And after.

506
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
She was really cute.

507
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm glad.

508
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But yeah, if I didn't need to sleep,

509
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I could do all these things all at once.

510
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I've got three ASMR collabs I need to edit.

511
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Which I think I can probably do today.

512
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And then soon.

513
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And just be like, I'm going to upload it soon dm.

514
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I want to upload my second 2k audio.

515
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And then I want to message.

516
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And then I want to upload mimosa.

517
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And then two more 1000 subscriber thank yous.

518
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then the next collab partner.

519
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Which I don't think I've said who it is.

520
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But I made the plots super easy for the girls.

521
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I didn't want to overwhelm them.

522
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm so sorry my voice is breaking.

523
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
If you can hear that.

524
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But I need my throat to recover.

525
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
See, next week we're writing some scripts together.

526
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And you guys are actually going to help me write the missing script for this month.

527
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So you get to tell me what you want to hear.

528
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Favourite companion in Skyrim.

529
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Mjöl.

530
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Mjöl or Serena.

531
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That's nice, I like Serena.

532
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
If you were a vampire, I would let you have my blood.

533
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You'd let me feed on you.

534
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I just don't sleep in the middle of some squid ink spaghetti.

535
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So I can make squid slime spaghetti.

536
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But you guys can make squid ink spaghetti.

537
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
See, I slime and you ink.

538
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You jack ink.

539
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I gel slime.

540
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But yeah, I hope to have more ASMR up today.

541
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I've made myself a little mini promise.

542
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Which is where I will instigate 10 ASMR collabs per month.

543
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Which means if all goes well, I will have completed my goal of 100 feature per collabs.

544
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Before a year is finished.

545
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So I have 6 collabs instigated with other features.

546
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm going to put my big girl pants on and reach out to a few other people.

547
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But I'm limiting it to 10 only.

548
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't want to ask any more than 10.

549
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I need to finish this current batch before I can ask the 11th person.

550
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That makes sense.

551
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
That's a lot of collabs.

552
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Ain't no picture here or can't watch that.

553
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm so sorry.

554
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I accidentally just put your cleaner up my nose.

555
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That feel awful.

556
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I've been sorry.

557
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
When on the hook, I get really animated.

558
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I was thrown around the ear clinic.

559
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And it went open.

560
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You're definitely ambitious.

561
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Because I was always weaving it around like a wandering pot.

562
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Like a wandering garden.

563
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It was true.

564
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Sorry, I'm crying right now.

565
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm laughter.

566
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm crying.

567
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't want to release more.

568
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm just supposed to be relaxed.

570
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm fucking losing it mate.

571
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm wiping away my tears.

572
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's not that funny.

573
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I just need to calm down.

574
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm so sorry.

575
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm high on painkillers.

576
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It wasn't that funny.

577
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm just sick of it.

578
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm done.

579
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I have so much tears coming out of my eyes.

580
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm wiping away my wee tears.

581
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I forgot.

583
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm back to his mind.

586
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Are you flaying?

588
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You made me cry.

589
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You made me cry.

590
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm embarrassed.

591
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I should get that turned into a clip.

592
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Why not?

593
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Streamer loses it after sticking at your cleaner up thing.

594
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm okay.

595
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm okay.

596
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm okay.

597
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Breathe in.

598
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Breathe out.

599
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
ASMR.

600
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Shhh.

601
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Relax.

602
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I wish I had this picture that I found yesterday.

603
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It was really funny.

604
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I wish I could show you it.

605
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
But I turned my phone off after TikTok opened itself up.

606
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That other stream.

607
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Okay, sorry.

608
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Relax.

609
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
The moon that waits today was a filming yesterday.

610
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay, there we go.

611
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Shhh.

612
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Shhh.

613
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Shhh.

614
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Shhh.

615
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Shhh.

616
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Shhh.

617
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Shhh.

618
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's like when you did debut

619
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and put that you wanted to list

620
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and made one too.

621
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Shhh.

622
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
No, seriously.

623
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
How did you manage to get on?

624
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I was waving about

625
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
when I talk

626
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I like wave my hands around

627
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and like basically

628
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I just perfectly leaned

629
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
to go in.

630
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Shhh.

631
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Shhh.

632
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay.

633
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Now excuse me.

634
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well, now we know where your funny button is.

635
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh, this noise.

636
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Actually,

637
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
it's disgusting.

638
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Humor is far humor.

639
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There's like this trend

640
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
where you golf

641
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
to try and cover up your far.

642
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Your far?

643
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But you like purposely golf

644
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
way before the far.

645
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Before the far.

646
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Then your far.

647
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Shhh.

648
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Shhh.

649
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Shhh.

650
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Shhh.

651
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Shhh.

652
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Sorry.

653
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Shhh.

654
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Shhh.

655
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Shhh.

656
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Shhh.

657
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I've not been funny.

658
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And when you guys sent an audio

659
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
of your farted marshmallow,

660
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I think I would absolutely lose it.

661
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Shhh.

662
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Shhh.

663
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Shhh.

664
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Shhh.

665
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Shhh.

666
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
ASMR ASMR.

667
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
My professional ASMR.

668
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
By the way,

669
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
this is my livelihood.

670
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's exactly what we did.

671
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:51,480
Another brief

672
00:52:51,480 --> 00:53:01,880
It's that request. Stop. If someone does sit and chat, check your washable because I'm

673
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,360
in a very giggly mid right now, it must be the painkillers or what. I'm just on a high

674
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:17,720
dose, it's not even like anything serious. Alright, a volunteer's tribute. It's like,

675
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:26,120
so the trend is you like cough to cover up your fart and then your fart, so it's delayed,

676
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:33,960
so everyone notices your fart. ASMR strongly makes, I should probably change the title of

677
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:44,360
this stream and just call it ASMR by field violently. Okay, brush your nose with your

678
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,200
ear cleaner. Brush my nose with your ear cleaner. Have you heard about a joke at first?

679
00:53:50,200 --> 00:54:02,600
My favorite one is like, whenever you fart, just say, oh do you smell popcorn? So everyone takes

680
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:13,640
the big one. So everyone goes, and for some reason Yoda is in my head whenever I say that.

681
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:22,280
Because there's a shot of Yoda leaning backwards in Star Wars, and it looks like he's taken a big

682
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,640
old sniff.

683
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:35,480
And this is so, have you seen the one where the dead drops a plate on the floor and they

684
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,760
take like, this is bad. No.

685
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,160
You can't take this.

686
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,360
I can't. I'm so sorry.

687
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,760
No, I haven't seen it.

688
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:09,240
I'm fucking gone. I can't even handle farting in my head.

689
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,040
I'm so sorry. I'm like crying and spitting everywhere right now.

690
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,440
This is an ASMR. I don't even know why I bothered labeling these days. You know what,

691
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,040
I'm just going to start labeling ASMR streams, not ASMR.

692
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:46,280
I have so many to you. I've never cried or laughed for so long. Actually, I think this is the first

693
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,640
time I've cried and laughed, and thank you refunds. I really needed this one.

694
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,680
Oh my god. ASMR is more like ASMR fart.

695
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:07,400
Strawny hypnotizes to peel your finger. I'm so sorry. Okay, whisper, whisper, whisper.

696
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,920
It was just the way that message was typed out. Oh, did you see the one where the guy

697
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:25,320
smashed a plate in shams? That is so specific. Wipe, smash a plate. I'm going to cough, sorry.

698
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:36,680
Oh, there's stuff stuck in my throat. That stuff in her throat, literally me.

699
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,000
Sorry, I'm going to need to actually cough.

700
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:57,880
Oh, gone. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. Right. Actually, ASMR.

701
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,040
Only one more hour of the giggles to go.

702
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:14,760
Oh, actually, I'm going to redirect into Sheebie, and then I go offline for 15 minutes,

703
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:23,640
and then we watch Transformers. It is a membership watch alone, but free access stream though, smile.

704
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:38,040
We heard it. I heard what? A fortuse. Don't be like this. She tried to cover it with a cough.

705
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:47,240
I've actually heard my voice from laughing so hard, as well as whispering. So now...

706
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,040
It's okay, good.

707
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,520
Remember the Yoda crying video where he gets slapped, yeah? She beats five hours.

708
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:20,040
Wait, I can't redirect into anyone, I feel her. Oh my god. My unit is broken in AC's offline.

709
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:33,880
I can't stream because I need to do, well, I need to do the watch alone, and I need to rest and come for a nap.

710
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,440
You'll have to get to the next one. Well, you got to hear my laughing fit, so...

711
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:55,720
I downloaded Transformers 2007 with Sam Webwiki, and Megan Fox, and Bumblebee.

712
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,680
Feel her unity over a glittering portrait here.

713
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:09,560
Will the watch alone have a tape stamp? Oh, I'll raise you one even better than a tape stamp.

714
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,600
It will also be on screen, but blurred, so you know that we're together at the same section.

715
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:22,200
So please don't worry about not being able to be at the same time as me. You're gonna know if you're at the same time as me.

716
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,200
It's too firm.

717
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:36,120
I'm cleaning your ear right now with a little sponge, although maybe I should clean it with my dog.

718
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,720
Is that better? I think so. Yeah, that looks better.

719
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,560
Okay, just dry you off a little bit.

720
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,960
Please show the girls how to do that. Okay, yes.

721
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:17,640
I'm going for a nap. I can go to our classic bubbles.

722
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,480
Thank you, Stronny. You're awesome. No, you're awesome. Refling.

723
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,480
Wow.

724
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,680
I want to be hypnotized soon, too.

725
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,160
I've basically, sorry, my voice is really struggling.

726
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:10,840
I basically am going to achieve, I'm going to focus on RuneScape, and I'm going to focus on Elden Ring.

727
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:17,880
And then in July, I'm doing all my secret side missions, which is like the free audio uploads and all that.

728
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,320
Stronny, what's the spray you're using earlier? It's my slime.

729
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,800
I made homemade slime and put it in a bowl to spray on YouTube and stream to hear it.

730
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,120
I have to add water so it's extra slimy.

731
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,120
But yeah, a little bowl of my slime. Let's go with my pheromones in it.

732
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:53,480
But yes, RuneScape and Elden Ring are my objective, mission objective.

733
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,880
I'm so sorry. I'm going to drink, I'm going to take a drink of water.

734
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,520
Have you fucked with my voice? Wow, it's this fucked.

735
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,600
Remember kids, don't do ASMR. Girls, you end up like me.

736
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,600
Oh my god, it's something like an old woman from Skyrim.

737
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,760
Talking to an old woman trying to do your good deed for the day?

738
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:31,640
Yes, or I sound like the thing from Conker's Bad Fur Day at the start or something.

739
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,200
It's Gryllococaine. Oh, that's a Gryllococaine.

740
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,000
Old women, old women are female.

741
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,000
Here to do your good deed for the day, Sunny.

742
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:11,080
Oh dear, your ears look so cold. What do I call you, sweetheart?

743
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,640
Oh, yes, your ears are too cold. Be out here.

744
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,520
Let me warm them up for you.

745
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,960
See, Sunny, that feels better.

746
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,840
You should rest your voice.

747
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:48,040
I should, but I'm going to have a honey tea and then I will watch Transformers.

748
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,000
Call me Riefling, please. Riefling.

749
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,760
Okay, have a fluffy make-up part.

750
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,440
You sound like female Voldemort.

751
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,680
What does Voldemort even say?

752
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:15,320
Harry! Harry, I can touch you.

753
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,800
It's over for you.

754
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,600
Yeah.

755
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,360
Gentle girlfriend. Oh, she's English, isn't she?

756
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,720
Who does gentle English is for school?

757
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,160
Hello, I'm English. I'm gentle girlfriend.

758
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,720
And I have a naturally soothing voice.

759
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,240
Unfortunately, this is definitely not where she's located in England,

760
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,400
so I do apologise if I'm insulting you.

761
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,720
Would you guys still love me if I was English, to be honest?

762
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,520
And there's actually only one right answer to that question.

763
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,240
And the answer is no.

764
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,640
You're supposed to say you only love me Scottish.

765
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,040
Imagine. Imagine, yeah? If I was English.

766
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,440
Landusie.

767
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:37,240
Echelon. Oh my god, would you get tingles if I gave you ASMR as a child?

768
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,920
You're not really going to get tingles, are you?

769
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,760
You're such a naughty boy, Riefling.

770
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,040
You're so strange like that, honestly.

771
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,880
Can I get a Chauvin gen 2 of that big group?

772
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,200
Riefling, so what's wrong with you?

773
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,200
All you do is ink around the place.

774
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,320
I'm starting to think you like when I go and I chewed Rieflings.

775
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,480
Could be French, Stedeon.

776
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,920
Bonjour, Rieflings.

777
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,880
Salut, ça va?

778
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,480
Bonne nuit.

779
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,000
Bonne avenue.

780
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,440
Bon veilleux.

781
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,440
Hello.

782
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,000
Ma préférée, Riefling.

783
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,000
ASMR, Struits, en français.

784
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,680
Oh mon Riefling.

785
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,640
J'ai besoin de ça.

786
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,520
Ah, thank you, tiny spinny, for the tip.

787
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,280
Ah, enjoy my stream.

788
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,160
This sounds very wrong.

789
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,680
Didn't he ask for German next?

790
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,800
I can't need any German.

791
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,200
Sad to say, I'll be gone for the watch-along at work,

792
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,240
but I'll have to catch up to the watch-along before I'd enjoy it.

793
01:06:59,240 --> 01:06:59,640
I will.

794
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,440
Your chaos comes so naturally, it's hard to follow,

795
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,520
but so easy to enjoy.

796
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,560
Oh, I'm glad you like my chaos.

797
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,560
It makes me feel very appreciated.

798
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,600
Here, let me show you my appreciation for you.

799
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,000
French, Ronnie, can you hurt ya?

800
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,760
For some reason, whenever I speak French, my voice goes lighter.

801
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,720
Bonjour, de l'aimant.

802
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,320
Salut, je suis Stronica Delce.

803
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,040
Salut, ça va?

804
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,920
Bien, ouais, ouais, bien.

805
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,520
I don't know why I go late when I speak French.

806
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,960
Tu peux soire ASMR?

807
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:12,680
Pour deux, Monsieur, pour deux, deux minutes, ASMR, deux.

808
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,680
Yeah, I don't know why, it just naturally goes fucking later.

809
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,720
When I'm all the way down here, I'm a default.

810
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,440
It's charming.

811
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,480
Well, glad you think so.

812
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:41,240
Well, I can't, I don't have a German accent.

813
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,800
I don't think I have a Dutch accent.

814
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,280
Hallo.

815
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,720
Ich bin Stronica Delce.

816
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,360
No, I don't have a Dutch accent, really.

817
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,560
Ich spelen.

818
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,280
Ich spelen?

819
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:12,040
Nee, ich stremen auf YouTube mit ASMR.

820
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,400
Wie bin ich?

821
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
Ich bin Stronica Delce.

822
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,400
Ich hau von Jau.

823
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,440
Ich hau von Juli.

824
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,840
Yeah, I don't have a Dutch accent.

825
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,480
Sorry, I need more water.

826
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,640
How long did it take you to learn French?

827
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,640
I actually don't know French.

828
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,680
It's just, I repeat words and throw sentences together, but I actually don't know.

829
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,840
American Stronica would be hilarious.

830
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:53,880
Well, yes, you might just get ash from Overwatch, because it's ash here.

831
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,280
Is there a chance that videos that get taken down be uploaded to Patreon?

832
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,080
Timothy Shaw, thank you for the tip.

833
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,600
I can upload videos, but I can upload audios.

834
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,880
I'm using my current Patreon as an audio sound bank.

835
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,960
I upload the stuff I put on YouTube up on it as well.

836
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,960
I actually, so I, you know what?

837
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,000
I can make you a deal.

838
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:31,800
Do you want to know how good I am at dancing the rules of YouTube?

839
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,120
Not one stream or one video on my YouTube channel is limited ads.

840
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,880
You have to admit, this cut off fish is bloody cunning.

841
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,720
Can you speak with a lisp for Dutch?

842
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,600
Have to speak with a lisp for Dutch.

843
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,480
For native ones.

844
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,000
Dutch mincing?

845
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,480
How about Canadian accent?

846
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,280
I am going to be so stereotypical when I say this.

847
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:13,000
I do not hear much of a difference between Americans and Canadians.

848
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,920
I'm so sorry.

849
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,880
I can't hear an accent differentiation.

850
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,040
Yeah, I know.

851
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,840
Put me in the bin.

852
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,880
Spanish?

853
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,440
I have no experience with Spanish, unfortunately.

854
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,640
I know sombre voicelines.

855
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,280
Augusta, my pantyhorn.

856
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,280
Merda.

857
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,360
How about a Kiwi accent?

858
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,360
Real, it's the same.

859
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,640
Shit, I'm so sorry.

860
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,200
Just don't tell me it's the same.

861
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,040
There really isn't a certain word.

862
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,480
It sounds like Kiwi accent.

863
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,600
I used to be able to do an Australian news anchor.

864
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,840
And here we are reporting.

865
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,160
No, well my voice is too fried for it.

866
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,840
But Kiwi accent is too hard.

867
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,760
The only Kiwi I can do is a Coca-Cola glass.

868
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,480
A Pepsi bottle.

869
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,800
I don't give a Dean.

870
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,080
It's the only Kiwi I can do.

871
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,560
Lol, I actually think that Canadians just sound like Midwesterners

872
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,080
with a slight French twinge.

873
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,800
Like, I know it's controversial,

874
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,800
but it kind of just feels like the same side of a coin.

875
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,400
And everyone's been like, no, that side's head and that side tails.

876
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,520
Like, as an outsider, like as a European.

877
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,480
Um, with like, obviously,

878
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,640
with European's geography, everyone is so close by,

879
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,040
like Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany, Poland, right over there.

880
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,680
Like, those are accent differentiations.

881
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,000
If you think of how massive the land mass of America and Canada is,

882
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,880
and you're telling me that that's such an immense difference,

883
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,800
I'm sorry, but call me 20 because I didn't hear it.

884
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,320
Wonder if Dutch English accent sounds cute to Anglophones' Dutch accent sounds

885
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,440
to Northern Germans, because we find them adorable.

886
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,280
Okay guys, I'm gonna just start seeing random Dutch stuff

887
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,200
I can remember off the top of my head.

888
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,040
Tell me if you think it's cute or not, so we can answer this guy's question.

889
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,920
Hello, how are you? I'm Strony Cattles.

890
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:59,960
I live in Australia, I have hunger.

891
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,680
I don't have a Dutch family.

892
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:11,880
To be honest, I teach Dutch on the Xbox.

893
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,840
There's one reason why I don't have it so much,

894
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:23,000
because I've been friends with Freemasonians,

895
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,800
but I have no friends anymore.

896
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,000
That's the best German for you.

897
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:40,600
I don't speak English, so I eat stropwafel, where my...

898
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,440
Big Vast!

899
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,640
You just throw random English words at the end of them.

900
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,640
Anything you say is cute, but you're just trying to get me a bullet, aren't you?

901
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,920
I give up, I give up.

902
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,920
You're cute, no matter what.

903
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,920
I'm not smart, but...

904
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,600
Ikal van jou!

905
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,040
I just said, I'm not very smart, but I love you!

906
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,640
Ik ben nietslim mar ikal van jou!

907
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,960
To say I love you in Dutch, you say...

908
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,200
Ikal van jou!

909
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,240
And to say I love you all in Dutch, like if I was talking to all the reflinks, you say...

910
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,440
Ikal van jullie!

911
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,240
And then in German, ich liebe dich.

912
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,600
Wah!

913
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:40,120
Did I just say something? I think I just said, ich liebe Schwanze.

914
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,080
Oops.

915
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,120
To say I love you in French, you say...

916
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,760
Je t'aime, je t'aime ma chérie!

917
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,440
And to say I love you in Scotland, you say...

918
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,960
What do you say?

919
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,800
I would probably be derogatory.

920
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,320
Okay, oops.

921
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,360
I said it wrong.

922
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,560
You just need to say this.

923
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,760
Ich liebe dich.

924
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,800
And then to say I love you in Spanish, te amo.

925
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,880
Te amo mi amor!

926
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,120
Te amo mi amor!

927
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Y mi amores!

928
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:26,120
In Polish, I don't know how to say it in Polish.

929
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,440
Te amo.

930
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,280
Oh, Italian's Te amo.

931
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,680
Upsiens Te amo!

932
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,760
Nope, you didn't read it after.

933
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,600
Girl knows how to speak German.

934
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,560
Nein, is das Gras rot?

935
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,080
Nein, das Gras ist klein!

936
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,160
That's the only German I know.

937
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,560
And also you just call the person a Sicker.

938
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,120
Yeah, basically.

939
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:54,920
You pronounce it...

940
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,040
Desh, desh, ish, liebe desh.

941
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,240
Yay, thanks for the Spanish.

942
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,480
And Turkish, in Turkish...

943
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,840
Sem, ni, seviyorum.

944
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,920
Sem ni seviyorum, sem, sem ni seviyorum.

945
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,440
A cut-fish of many talents.

946
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,280
No, no, see, it's just called learning one sentence and calling it.

947
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,240
Force comp.

948
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,640
Strongly.

949
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,560
Bro, you're killing me with that Spanish.

950
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,600
What's that?

951
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,040
Spanish is Te amo.

952
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,840
You had it right.

953
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,640
Italian is just really...

954
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,400
Is there any other ones that we haven't said?

955
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,160
How to say, I love you in Polish.

956
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:45,000
I love you in Polish.

957
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,520
Wie bin ich?

958
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,360
Ich bin ein Gott.

959
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,920
Oh, Kohamshi, in Polish it's Kohamshi.

960
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,000
Kohamshi, who else?

961
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,880
Wait, actually, let me look at location statistics.

962
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,200
Analytics, audience, location.

963
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,680
Let's see, my most...

964
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,560
The Philippines, oh, hi, Philippines.

965
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,200
How to say, I love you in Filipino.

966
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,840
Is mahal kita.

967
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,120
Did I do it right?

968
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,280
Mahal kita.

969
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,800
And where's P in this list?

970
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,520
P for P in...

971
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,120
Wait, is Filipino not a language?

972
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,520
Filipino?

973
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,120
What?

974
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,160
Philippines, they would speak Filipino in the Philippines.

975
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,560
Am I being...

976
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,960
It's not in Google Translate list.

977
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,360
Latibia.

978
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,640
Am I being crazy?

979
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,520
Filipinos have appeared.

980
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,440
Oh wait, no, you guys don't speak Filipino, you speak Tagalog.

981
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,760
Hold on, Tagalog.

982
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,680
Wait, Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?

983
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,400
What?

984
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,440
Tagalog isn't on Google Translate?

985
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,480
I love you.

986
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:27,400
Oh, Filipino's spelt with an F in English,

987
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,840
but the country is spelt with a P,

988
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,880
so I was looking in the wrong places.

989
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,160
Mahal kita.

990
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,160
Well, I didn't use Google Translate to get that to say that, right?

991
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,400
Okay, mahal kita, and then Germany,

992
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,560
which is Ishtabedi, which is Canadian,

993
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,120
which is just...

994
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,400
I love you, could you guys speak it?

995
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,760
Australia, again, I love you, you see.

996
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,520
Brazil.

997
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,280
Oh my God, come to Brazil.

998
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,960
Why is Brazil watching me?

999
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,080
I'm not that interesting.

1000
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,760
Brazil speak Portuguese.

1001
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,480
Eu te amo.

1002
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,400
Eu te amo.

1003
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,000
Eu te amo.

1004
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:07,720
Brazil.

1005
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,280
What are your ancestors and say in Gaelic?

1006
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,120
I love you in Gaelic.

1007
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,720
Curious.

1008
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:25,880
I love you.

1009
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,080
Okay, I don't have to say on that end.

1010
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,440
There's no freaking read.

1011
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,040
There's no read.

1012
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:43,560
There's no Google read for Irish translation.

1013
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,880
It says Irish instead of Gaelic as well,

1014
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,760
which is curious.

1015
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,160
You need to catch up with the lore about Scotland

1016
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,480
and Gaelic in Ireland at the same time, right?

1017
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,160
Brainwash me.

1018
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,480
Oh yeah, the country is Ph for everything else's F.

1019
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,920
Literally, I just got trolled so hard.

1020
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,840
Cute Portuguese, Ronnie.

1021
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,600
Placota Le Bey?

1022
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,280
I think Placota Le Bey means hello in Portuguese.

1023
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,640
Even Google can't pronounce Gaelic.

1024
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,800
Literally, I typed in Gaelic and it goes Irish

1025
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,640
and then it doesn't even a nun see anything.

1026
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,280
Chong, baby.

1027
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,200
Who else?

1028
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,480
What other countries watch?

1029
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,080
Sweden.

1030
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,800
Sweden.

1031
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,440
Who the fuck is watching from Sweden right now?

1032
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,440
Oh my god.

1033
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,520
What's the meaning of this?

1034
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,280
To say Javla, fita ora.

1035
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,080
And Sweden is for Sweden.

1036
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,600
I said, oh wait, there's a Scottish Gaelic.

1037
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,840
And again, it doesn't do it.

1038
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,040
Anyway, Sweden is where it is.

1039
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,800
Yeah, I love you.

1040
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,320
I love you.

1041
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,640
I love you.

1042
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,040
I love you.

1043
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,480
I love you.

1044
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,320
Scottish Gaelic is there.

1045
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,800
Yes, but it doesn't say it out loud, so I can't mimic.

1046
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,880
Then it goes Poland, which is Khoamshu.

1047
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,240
And then it's France, which is Vietnam.

1048
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,680
And then it's the Netherlands, which is the Carvagnol.

1049
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,640
And then it's Spain, which is Te Amo.

1050
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,800
And then there's just Finland.

1051
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,880
Let's try Finland, but a cheeky finish.

1052
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,280
F is for finish, let's do stuff together.

1053
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,840
U is for unbelievably good unity.

1054
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,880
What? Finland, F.

1055
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,680
A, B, C, D, E.

1056
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,680
A, B, C, D, E, F.

1057
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,800
Oh, it was right under.

1058
01:22:59,160 --> 01:22:59,800
Excuse me.

1059
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,640
I love you.

1060
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,560
I love you for the one finish.

1061
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,440
Irish is Bruno's Gaelic, but it's called his Gaelic.

1062
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,280
You're getting your card revolt right now.

1063
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,920
No, I was always Gaelic in school.

1064
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,200
Short on behaviour.

1065
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,000
Actually, I'm Irish then, and I find that offensive.

1066
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,640
Wait, I just went Aussie by accident.

1067
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,800
I can't even do an Aussie accent naturally.

1068
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:35,160
Bro, sorry, it's Gaelic, sorry, Gaelic.

1069
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:45,080
Also, I broke the bad news to Sin that we have to do her collab in July.

1070
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,080
Where the heck is Russian?

1071
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,480
I love you.

1072
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,200
That's so fast.

1073
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:00,680
Holy shit.

1074
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,880
Can you give me like a second in between those two other sentences?

1075
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,120
Okay, hold on.

1076
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,320
We're going to put a comma in between love and you because it goes so fast.

1077
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,120
Okay, you didn't change a thing.

1078
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,200
Now your card is revoked.

1079
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,680
I always knew you were a fake Scottish.

1080
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,720
Sin, you can't expose me like this.

1081
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,160
I'll jam a toothpick up your nose.

1082
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,400
Oh wait, not a toothpick.

1083
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,600
I actually don't, you missed it.

1084
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,360
I accidentally jammed my freaking Japanese ear cleaner up my nose by accident

1085
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,240
because I was swishing it about like a wand and then ended up having a

1086
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,040
fucking laugh in my ass off over it.

1087
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,120
Like it's tickling your ear.

1088
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,320
You have to be Olympia.

1089
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,440
I'm tall but I could do it.

1090
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,640
Would you still let me far as Irish?

1091
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,520
Here, father, who aren't in heaven?

1092
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,480
How do I debate that name?

1093
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,760
Someone says Icelandic.

1094
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,360
Icelandic.

1095
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,960
All right, there's nothing called Icelandic.

1096
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,480
Are you trolling me right now?

1097
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,760
I have been successfully trolling.

1098
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,200
A longer wait for two Sculpe Grammels a year or so?

1099
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,600
I don't know.

1100
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,800
I love in Scottish pronunciation.

1101
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,960
Oh my god, also go RuneScape mention.

1102
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,600
Can you say kom in what's Cantonese?

1103
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,600
Wait, Cantonese isn't listed.

1104
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:43,320
It says Chinese simplified but is that just a massive oversight?

1105
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,960
Yeah, it just doesn't have Cantonese.

1106
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,960
Wow, the best you're getting is Chinese simplified from me.

1107
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,120
How do you say it in Kotfisch?

1108
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,680
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1109
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,880
Wait, blah blah blah blah.

1110
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,960
How fast can I do that?

1111
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,640
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1112
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:16,360
Now imagine that on the brineulum.

1113
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,480
Thank you, I'll be here all week.

1114
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,360
Please like and subscribe if you enjoyed this stream, which is not ASMR.

1115
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,840
I'm going to start putting not ASMR at the start of ASMR streams.

1116
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,200
Yeah, I think it would probably just be bubbles because we're under the water.

1117
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,520
I love you.

1118
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,520
my shoulder is just cracked

1119
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,520
sorry I forgot to start whispering again

1120
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,520
why me?

1121
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,520
but yeah

1122
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,520

you listen with your nose

1126
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,520
it was a mistake

1127
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
I will know

1128
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,520
I will be the ravelling that teaches a Scottish streamer

1129
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,520
I speak gaelic

1130
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,520
sorry

1131
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,520
gaelic

1132
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
we're gaelic over here

1133
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
since sense about to rip my hair off

1134
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,520
oh the bing-chin-ing me

1135
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,520
bing-chin-ing

1136
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,520
tang-jo-ma

1137
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,520
a bing-chin-ing

1138
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,520
the wang

1139
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,520
you don't know the names of your bars

1140
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,520
I'll teach ya

1141
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,520
so you know that's super sensitive

1142
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,520
but

1143
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
it feels almost too good to be true

1144
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,520
almost that 8k

1145
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
oh please let it

1146
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,520
actually I'm gonna

1147
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,520
I have an edit video I can upload

1148
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,520
now this one will get limited ads

1149
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,520
but it's well deserved

1150
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,520
have you been here?

1151
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
sorry it means I love you too

1152
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,520
and finish like

1153
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,520
it's gonna be me

1154
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,520
I'm uploading an ASMR video

1155
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,520
and it's called

1156
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,520
ASMR collabing

1157
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,520
with new hands

1158
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,520
it's gonna be quite an experience

1159
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,520
when you click on it

1160
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,520
that's all I'm gonna say

1161
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,520
because my other video isn't limited

1162
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,520
like there's literally not one video that's limited

1163
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,520
ads on my channel so I'm not sweating

1164
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,520
you mentioned earlier that you don't mean

1165
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,520
bend it forward do you?

1166
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,520
no he's like bending backwards

1167
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,520
to like take a big sniff

1168
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,520
guys when they learn what the

1169
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,520
the pendulum is

1170
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,520
like if you don't know what a pendulum is

1171
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,520
don't worry

1172
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,520
I'll teach ya the premium pass

1173
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,520
for the meeting

1174
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,520
okay

1175
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
and he's stop

1176
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,520
that's terrible

1177
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,520
someone say me

1178
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,520
a marshmallow

1179
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
actually I should check out marshmallow

1180
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
someone sent me a marshmallow

1181
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,520
and they were like

1182
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,520
if I was ever in front of you

1183
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,520
I don't even think I could make eye contact

1184
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,520
and I'm like mate

1185
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,520
I'm so small

1186
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,520
I'm literally like

1187
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,520
fall in love

1188
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,520
five two

1189
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,520
you do not have to be intimidated by me

1190
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,520
I'm not gonna do anything to you

1191
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,520
oh

1192
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,520
holy crap your whispering voice is so

1193
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,520
oh yeah

1194
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,520
you like it when you can hear my accent

1195
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,520
you're so sweet to me

1196
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,520
refling you really are

1197
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,520
I wonder what triggers

1198
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,520
your neurons while listening

1199
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,520
that sound a bit more dominant

1200
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,520
when I give a heavy whisper

1201
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,520
is that

1202
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,520
you're just such a subby little refling

1203
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,520
you can't help

1204
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,520
but mail

1205
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
when I'm right up close and personal

1206
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
in your ears huh

1207
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,520
I like when you're submissive

1208
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,520
it's cute

1209
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
you're cute

1210
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,520
I wouldn't be intimidated by you

1211
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,520
I'd be intimidated by my own anxiety

1212
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,520
let me hold it was an experience

1213
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,520
well

1214
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,520
wait until the next day

1215
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,520
some more experience

1216
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,520
eye contact

1217
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,520
would you be brave enough

1218
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,520
to look into my eyes

1219
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,520
how are you

1220
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,520
oh no my internet is losing the fight again

1221
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,520
5-2 can't make eye contact

1222
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,520
if you're that low

1223
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,520
literally I'm like pretty sure

1224
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,520
like almost always at all to me

1225
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,520
although it would be really nice

1226
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,520
if a few of you were smaller than me

1227
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,520
then I could just absolutely annihilate you

1228
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
and you'd be so kind to me

1229
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,520
and I'd be so nice to you

1230
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
kiss my ear canal

1231
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,520
no

1232
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,520
a melon for your fruit

1233
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,520
I haven't ever wrote before stream

1234
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,520
I had an old secret audio in bed

1235
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,520
but it went everywhere

1236
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,520
and I thought you'd know how

1237
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,520
I haven't even done the main break stuff yet

1238
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,520
I

1239
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,520
wait what

1240
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,520
I keep forgetting to record the audio

1241
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,520
year's day 3 of 7

1242
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,520
it's a little embarrassing at first

1243
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,520
but now it feels natural

1244
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:47,520
stroney the allegations stroney

1245
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,520
and he sent me to fail

1246
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
oops

1247
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,520
I definitely can't be opening that

1248
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,520
stroney ear breathing is just like

1249
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,520
they like feeling my breath

1250
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,520
against your ear

1251
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,520
you've always been nice though

1252
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,520
so I don't think you've ever not been nice

1253
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,520
but how do you be mean

1254
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,520
I don't know how you be mean

1255
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,520
like unless you're

1256
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,520
you're like genuinely want me to like

1257
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,520
help you or something

1258
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,520
how tall are you

1259
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,520
I'm a hundred and like

1260
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
sixty two centimeters kind of

1261
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,520
wanna get there

1262
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,520
I'm not very tall

1263
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,520
you wanna kiss on the forehead

1264
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,520
goodnight

1265
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
I apologize if I said this to you

1266
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,520
ah don't worry

1267
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
um

1268
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
stroney I've been watching VTubers

1269
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,520
for four years now

1270
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,520
wah veteran

1271
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,520
watching VTubers big and small

1272
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,520
successful and just starting

1273
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
I've laughed

1274
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,520
I've loved

1275
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
I've cheered and I've cried

1276
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,520
I thought I'd seen everything

1277
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
the VTubers space have to offer

1278
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,520
but the past two weeks have

1279
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,520
driven me wrong

1280
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,520
wait wow

1281
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,520
I don't know what it is

1282
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,520
or how it happened

1283
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,520
or what the difference is

1284
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,520
but

1285
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,520
oops sorry

1286
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,520
but I know this

1287
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,520
even though I just met you

1288
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,520
I would follow you into the dicks of

1289
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,520
hell

1290
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,520
your natural leadership

1291
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,520
and magnetic personality has

1292
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,520
built me and trapped me against you

1293
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,520
and I wouldn't have it any other way

1294
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,520
as also

1295
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,520
as I kneel before you

1296
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,520
I ask stroney

1297
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,520
would you be my kamioshi

1298
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
no you can't give me that

1299
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,520
I've had to follow you

1300
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
and all the feeler girls

1301
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,520
for as long as this rate lasts

1302
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,520
you can't meet me kamioshi

1303
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,520
you can't do that

1304
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
oh veteran VTubers

1305
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,520
watch her

1306
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,520
that's so much

1307
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,520
that's insane

1308
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,520
are you telling me all it took

1309
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,520
was someone who can weaponize their ups

1310
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,520
typical kamioshi

1311
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,520
you're telling me you've never came across

1312
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,520
someone with a perfect mix

1313
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,520
of ADHD and autism your honor

1314
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,520
oh

1315
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,520
you know what it sounds like

1316
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,520
it sounds like it's too late for ya

1317
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,520
and my tentacles already have a grasp on ya

1318
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,520
and you can't get home

1319
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,520
now that you'd want to

1320
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,520
not until

1321
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,520
I'm fully done

1322
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,520
mind breaking ya

1323
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,520
I'm glad you enjoy all the feeler girls so much

1324
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520
though that's so nice

1325
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,520
stroney is real and cannot be stopped

1326
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,520
and will conquer the world

1327
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,520
oh my god someone left a comment

1328
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,520
on my RuneScape stream when I was doing my dinner

1329
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
foil stuff

1330
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,520
and they were like logistics actually cost a lot of money

1331
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,520
and I'm like who do you think sets the fucking prices you eat ya

1332
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,520
ah

1333
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,520
I just deleted it

1334
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,520
I was like no and you're not getting

1335
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,520
you're not getting picture

1336
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,520
you will accept my tinfoil

1337
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,520
my tinfoil rents or you will accept none of me at all

1338
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,520
the bill don't be

1339
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,520
strun

1340
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,520
strunrism

1341
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,520
strunism is real

1342
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,520
yes it is real

1343
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,520
I just want to say I'm deeply envious

1344
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,520
and in all of your productivity

1345
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,520
the discipline and fuck it

1346
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
the discipline

1347
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,520
I have no discipline

1348
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,520
and I have no focus

1349
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:08,520
what I have

1350
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
is weaponised autism

1351
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,520
and I will scream that from the rooftops

1352
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,520
I spawned in and rolled two pairs of dice

1353
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,520
and they miraculously landed a 6x

1354
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,520
ok

1355
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:29,520
and those 6x equated to me being creative via ASMR

1356
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,520
and collabing and organising and productivity in that sense

1357
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,520
in real life jobs

1358
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,520
I am not as good like this

1359
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,520
although I really enjoyed my cafe job

1360
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,520
so I may have been a cafe owner in another life

1361
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,520
so please do not ever feel bad

1362
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,520
ever feel guilty

1363
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,520
ever feel anything negative

1364
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,520
about not being productive in this day and age

1365
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,520
I will put my tinfoil hat around right now

1366
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,520
humans are not meant to be focused on the task

1367
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,520
for more than 8 hours at a time

1368
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,520
that is not possible

1369
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,520
that is not the way we have been raised

1370
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,520
we have been thrown into this new day and age

1371
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
where nothing is adequate

1372
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,520
why do you think there is currently a battle

1373
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,520
about a 4 day work week

1374
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,520
why do you think all these issues in society stem from

1375
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,520
is it because mayhaps we are not designed

1376
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,520
for what we are using our bodies and minds for

1377
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,520
in this day and age

1378
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,520
I don't know

1379
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,520
anyway put the tinfoil hat away

1380
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,520
put it away

1381
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
we can come back to that conversation later

1382
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,520
oh you said another sentence

1383
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,520
sorry I didn't read it

1384
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,520
also I want to fold you like origami or something

1385
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,520
of course I missed that sentence and read it

1386
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,520
ignore this

1387
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,520
if it's already been dealt with

1388
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,520
just wondering if the stream times are correct

1389
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,520
no they are not

1390
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,520
I have changed though

1391
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,520
I will update the rest of my week on YouTube very shortly

1392
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
yeah but yesterday the luck wasn't on our side

1393
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:05,520
the box shot really made me feel conscious of your unluckiness

1394
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,520
I use all my luck up on my daughters

1395
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,520
and my reeflings

1396
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,520
I now have both

1397
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,520
I want nothing more

1398
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,520
I ask for nothing more

1399
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,520
other than you know the success of my daughters

1400
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,520
but that's it

1401
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
I heard humans can only work efficiently

1402
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,520
for 45 minutes and the brain loses and projectivates

1403
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,520
hello scrawny

1404
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,520
I'm just a thought and a clip watcher for the girls

1405
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,520
hi I thought watchers

1406
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,520
thank you for watching us

1407
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
we appreciate you

1408
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,520
I can't read out what you said

1409
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,520
thought watcher

1410
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,520
but I have said something

1411
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,520
so please don't worry

1412
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,520
and please don't worry about being a silent viewer as well

1413
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,520
you can be as loud or as quiet as you like

1414
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,520
shout out to lurkers and everything

1415
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,520
please don't ever feel forced to talk

1416
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,520
it is not how it works

1417
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,520
hi I just wanted to say you're doing an amazing job

1418
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,520
and keep up what you're doing

1419
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,520
wish you're doing an amazing job of thinking to me

1420
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,520
so keep up what you're doing

1421
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,520
not to be read on stream

1422
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,520
stream

1423
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,520
I'm reading in my head

1424
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,520
love you to a little riefling

1425
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,520
enjoy your holiday

1426
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,520
oh no you're off on holiday

1427
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,520
you're just going off on holiday

1428
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,520
lurkers mentioned yes

1429
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,520
you can lurk and be as quiet as you like

1430
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,520
or you can be as active as you like

1431
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,520
I don't like

1432
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,520
hi momen

1433
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,520
hi riefling

1434
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,520
I noticed the scrawny tingle

1435
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,520
what was a little hard to make up

1436
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,520
in the youtube resolution

1437
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,520
oh no

1438
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,520
I made it the same way

1439
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,520
maybe I can revise it and give it a shot

1440
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,520
ehhh

1441
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,520
pardon me

1442
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,520
okay I'm gonna take a hydration check

1443
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,520
everyone please hydrate

1444
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,520
man of four hour work week

1445
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,520
working numbers

1446
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,520
bra honestly

1447
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,520
everyone's like

1448
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,520
I used to work

1449
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,520
I used to work

1450
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,520
eight hours a week

1451
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:43,520
my guy that's called you're being exploited

1452
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,520
you're being exploited

1453
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,520
don't feel

1454
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,520
don't feel proud of working eight hours

1455
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,520
you're being exploited

1456
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,520
get out of your head

1457
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,520
no let me in deeper

1458
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,520
let me in your head

1459
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,520
let my accent consume you

1460
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,520
let my mannerisms consume you

1461
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,520
let my personality

1462
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,520
become you

1463
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,520
okay

1464
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,520
hello

1465
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,520
hi scrawny hi riefling

1466
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,520
I hope you're doing well

1467
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,520
I'm doing fantastic

1468
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,520
I have the laughing fit

1469
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,520
and I'm high on being killers

1470
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,520
I was wondering if you had any advice

1471
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,520
on interacting properly

1472
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,520
with content creators

1473
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,520
I never know if I'm doing enough to support

1474
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,520
or too much to support

1475
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,520
or if I'm being parasocial or worse

1476
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
I have no idea what a tribute is

1477
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,520
and I always worry

1478
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,520
I'm using the term oh she wrong

1479
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,520
please don't write

1480
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,520
I reply to tweets too often

1481
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,520
probably

1482
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520
I'm probably just being anxious about nothing

1483
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:54,520
I will tell you a very big advice right now

1484
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,520
the only person

1485
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,520
that judges you as harshly as you

1486
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,520
is no one

1487
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,520
they do not exist

1488
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,520
you look at yourself

1489
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,520
via a magnifying glass

1490
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
you overthink

1491
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,520
on things

1492
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,520
that no one will ever think about

1493
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,520
okay

1494
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,520
so if you

1495
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
what my wampam advice is

1496
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:28,520
you are welcome to talk in my stream at any time

1497
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,520
if you worry about

1498
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,520
talking too much or too little

1499
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,520
don't worry

1500
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,520
we have the autism

1501
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,520
me and the reflins okay

1502
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,520
we all have issues okay

1503
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,520
so please don't worry about socializing with us

1504
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,520
as for in general

1505
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,520
if you genuinely want a strategic

1506
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,520
structured flow

1507
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
I would say send a message

1508
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,520
every 5 minutes

1509
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,520
if the chat is slow

1510
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,520
every 3 minutes

1511
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,520
if the chat is fast

1512
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,520
and try to relay your messages

1513
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,520
to something related to the streamer

1514
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,520
this applies to other streamers

1515
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,520
me

1516
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,520
you can

1517
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,520
if we're doing an ASMR stream

1518
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
you can literally say please say the sentence

1519
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
and it's the most diabolical thing

1520
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,520
written to man

1521
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,520
that is socially acceptable

1522
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,520
in my streams

1523
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,520
when it comes to other streamers

1524
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,520
try your best to stay on topic

1525
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,520
so for example

1526
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,520
if emi is playing the game

1527
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,520
the coffin of andi and lele

1528
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,520
you type

1529
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,520
I'm so glad

1530
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,520
I'm emi's brother

1531
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,520
smile

1532
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,520
that's acceptable

1533
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,520
it's related to the game

1534
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,520
it's related to emi's lore

1535
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,520
perfectly fine

1536
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,520
no problems

1537
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,520
now you've said I'm worried about being parasocial

1538
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,520
I always say the statement

1539
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,520
you are welcome to be as close

1540
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,520
or as far away as you like

1541
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,520
as long as you are safe

1542
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,520
and you're not showing up to people's houses

1543
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,520
I think it's fine

1544
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,520
but there's a lot behind this

1545
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,520
you know parasocialism

1546
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,520
but as long as you're safe

1547
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,520
and you're not doing emotional damage

1548
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,520
to yourself or others

1549
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,520
all good to go

1550
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,520
em a bit but

1551
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,520
is something you might not know about

1552
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,520
because it is related to alternative streamers

1553
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,520
a bit but is when a wreathling

1554
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,520
may have thoroughly enjoyed an audio

1555
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,520
or myself in general

1556
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,520
or a teasing

1557
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,520
and they would like to prove to me

1558
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,520
that they enjoyed it by sending

1559
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,520
an audio

1560
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,520
or a video of evidence

1561
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,520
of enjoying it

1562
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,520
which we have connamed inking

1563
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
now for me

1564
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
I am comfortable with it

1565
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,520
because I like corrupting

1566
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,520
and I'm fine with it

1567
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,520
but you can always put it in

1568
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
you can just drop it in my marshmallow

1569
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,520
I have got a little folder going

1570
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,520
I've got an audio folder

1571
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,520
and a video folder

1572
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,520
you are worried about using oshi

1573
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:27,520
so oshi means

1574
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
well actually the wreathlings

1575
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,520
might be able to describe this better than I ever can

1576
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
can oshi mean someone

1577
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
that you enjoy watching

1578
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
and you are there

1579
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,520
like they're your best streamer

1580
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,520
in a roster

1581
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
like if you had to do a 1v1 lineup

1582
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,520
they kept coming out on top

1583
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
yeah

1584
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:52,520
you're worried about your reply to tweets too often

1585
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,520
and you're worried about being anxious over nothing

1586
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,520
I think you might be a little in your own head

1587
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,520
which is okay

1588
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,520
everyone is

1589
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,520
don't think you're the only person to ever have these issues

1590
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,520
to ever come to the man

1591
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,520
to ever do this to ever do that

1592
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:13,520
if you're worried about replying to tweets too often

1593
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,520
my question for you

1594
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,520
do you reply to every single tweet?

1595
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,520
I think liking a tweet

1596
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,520
every single tweet

1597
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,520
perfectly fine

1598
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,520
replying to every tweet

1599
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,520
if it is causing you emotional distress

1600
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,520
with the anxiety

1601
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,520
then I think

1602
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,520
reply every 3 tweets

1603
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,520
is more than socially acceptable

1604
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,520
or on tweets that you feel ever so inclined to reply on

1605
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,520
so for example

1606
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,520
if your oshi posts

1607
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,520
her weekly schedule

1608
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,520
I think it's more than acceptable to say

1609
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,520
I'm really looking forward

1610
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,520
to this stream on this day

1611
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,520
okay

1612
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,520
oh here we go

1613
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,520
refling comes in

1614
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,520
oshi is used for idols and celebrities

1615
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,520
who you like it means

1616
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,520
I like and support

1617
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,520
I would oshi originates from the kanji

1618
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,520
recommendation

1619
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,520
okay

1620
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,520
yes

1621
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,520
so please just remember

1622
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,520
your head the most

1623
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,520
eh

1624
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,520
and

1625
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,520
yes

1626
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,520
someone says you said before you're not into the idea of being

1627
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,520
okay I don't think I could say that in this stream

1628
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,520
we'll say it in transformers

1629
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,520
okay

1630
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,520
stream warning please don't say this out loud

1631
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,520
what happens if I do say it out loud huh

1632
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,520
are you gonna bust

1633
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,520
stroney I'm glad you're Scottish

1634
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,520
because when you say ours is making me want to disable your abilities

1635
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,520
that's bloody creative

1636
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,520
I'll give you that

1637
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,520
that's creative

1638
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,520
wait she's actually dropping stream of urges right

1639
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,520
I don't want anyone ever feeling like their

1640
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,520
you know

1641
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,520
and the

1642
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,520
doing their thing

1643
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,520
like I just want you to enjoy yourself

1644
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,520
and if you're overthinking it

1645
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,520
then we're gonna tackle that together

1646
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,520
hi stroney I love your laugh

1647
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,520
also your voice is my new favorite ASMR trigger

1648
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,520
oh yeah you like my croaky voice

1649
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,520
you like grailock the kind from Skyrim

1650
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
I bet that refling found that very helpful

1651
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,520
oh I hope so

1652
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,520
just being curious

1653
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,520
is acceptable if someone comments on every tweet

1654
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,520
or is that wrong

1655
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,520
I think it's perfectly fine

1656
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,520
but I don't tweet all the time

1657
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,520
so yeah

1658
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,520
if you maybe watch a streamer

1659
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,520
that is addicted to tweeting

1660
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,520
I don't know

1661
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,520
I don't know what their comfort levels would be

1662
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,520
I don't, it does not bother me none

1663
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,520
I am rubbish on Twitter

1664
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,520
please don't ever feel bad

1665
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,520
if I don't like give you a like on Twitter or something

1666
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,520
and my tags aren't working

1667
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,520

1668
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,520

wait someone sent me a poem

1711
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,520
what the heck you guys are so good at poems

1712
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,520
everything you do

1713
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,520
it sends me higher than the moon

1714
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,520
with every twinkle in your eye

1715
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,520
you strike a match

1716
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,520
that lights my heart on fire

1717
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,520
when you're near

1718
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,520
I hate my blushing face

1719
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,520
and trip on my shoelaces

1720
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,520
grace just isn't my forte

1721
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,520
but it brings me to my knees

1722
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,520
when you say hello

1723
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,520
how are you my darling

1724
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,520
today I fall into

1725
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,520
a pail on the floor

1726
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,520
but we love is hard to ignore

1727
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,520
when every little thing you do

1728
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,520
I do adore oh my god that's so great

1729
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,520
what the heck you guys

1730
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,520
didn't tell me you studied Shakespeare

1731
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,520
someone says just reply

1732
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,520
when you can add something

1733
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,520
oh that's so cute

1734
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,520
I think your meme tag

1735
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,520
is spelled incorrectly

1736
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,520
no no no no no

1737
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,520
so originally it was going to be

1738
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,520
cephalobok

1739
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,520
but then I spelled it wrong

1740
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,520
with cephalobok

1741
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,520
and then I realized

1742
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,520
that's exactly on par for me

1743
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,520
so I leave it as cephalobok

1744
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,520
I've been watching Vtuber since

1745
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,520
2018

1746
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,520
and you're the only person I've been willing to get

1747
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,520
up at 3am

1748
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,520
bro I thought I was bad

1749
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,520
waking up at 4am

1750
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,520

1751
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,520
sorry Ozzy

1752
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,520
I apologize

1753
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,520
I'm 5'3

1754
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,520
but I'm willing to list the kneecaps

1755
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,520
for you I'm not gonna lie

1756
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,520
nah you're perfect

1757
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,520
for sitting on

1758
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,520
because I can get you to lie down

1759
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,520
on the floor

1760
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,520
and

1761
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,520
and if you're 5'3

1762
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,520
that means I'm at crochet

1763
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,520
okay I had to tint my tentacle a few times

1764
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,520
during this

1765
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,520
multiple

1766
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,520

1772
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,520

1773
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,520

1774
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,520
I don't play overwatch anymore

1775
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,520
I'm so sorry

1776
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,520
I'm sorry a little too briefly

1777
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,520
I used to play Saria

1778
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,520

01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,520
us security

1784
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,520
at this convention

1785
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,520
I need to get back in shape for the event

1786
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,520
can I get some motivation

1787
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,520
for the gym please

1788
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,520
how are you supposed to breathe

1789
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,520
if you can't lift me every time

1790
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,520
I sit on your face

1791
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,520
now lift me

1792
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,520
or go home

1793
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,520
now

1794
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,520
is that the motivation you need

1795
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,520
I'm watching you during a workout

1796
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,520
risking the

1797
01:53:58,520 --> 01:53:59,520
oh during work

1798
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,520
risking the job just for you

1799
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,520
let's see just wanted to say

1800
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,520
I've been loving your streams

1801
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,520
and the vids you upload especially the ASMR

1802
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,520
attend not to comment and stop because I'm kind of

1803
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,520
conscious of all this sort of stuff

1804
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,520
but don't send a supportive message

1805
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,520
to tell you keep up much love

1806
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,520
much love refling

1807
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,520
don't worry if you're shy it's perfectly okay

1808
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,520
I know you're there I can see likes

1809
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,520
on my videos

1810
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,520
I know you're leaving likes

1811
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,520
because you're so good to me

1812
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,520
hi strongy I love your laugh

1813
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,520
did you like when I couldn't stop laughing

1814
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,520
because I shoved an ear cleaner up my nose

1815
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,520
why would I want to breathe anything

1816
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,520
else after breathing you in

1817
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,520
just have incredible lung strength

1818
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,520
yeah I think that's probably

1819
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,520
pretty perfect

1820
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,520
yeah that guy's gonna be ripped

1821
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,520
why would I lift you though

1822
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,520
because you're not supposed to perish

1823
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,520
from sitting

1824
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,520
you're supposed to be able to push me off

1825
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,520
and throw me around

1826
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,520
bend me

1827
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,520
there that's all the motivation

1828
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,520
for the gym bros

1829
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,520
now for my architects however

1830
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,520
you keep eating that takeaway

1831
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,520
and for my beanballs

1832
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,520
don't worry all the better

1833
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,520
to throw you around

1834
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,520
I remember

1835
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,520
when you guys taught me

1836
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,520
of beanball men

1837
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,520
and it's a body type of beanball

1838
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,520
for skinny malinky guys

1839
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,520
oh yes chat struggling

1840
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,520
man

1841
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,520
what did I walk into

1842
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,520
a freaking ASMR nightmare

1843
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,520
thoughts on stoners

1844
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,520
I don't have any thoughts

1845
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,520
unfortunately

1846
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,520
I've never partaken

1847
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,520
in such a thing before

1848
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,520
but as long as you're happy

1849
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,520
I'm happy that's the main thing

1850
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,520
to be careful of your lungs

1851
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,520
however because you may

1852
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,520
have been fed

1853
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,520
a cheeky lie that

1854
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,520
it doesn't do any damage

1855
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,520
to your lungs but that's wrong

1856
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,520
it's smoke inhalation it does do damage

1857
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,520
so please do look after yourself

1858
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,520
and get yourself checked out

1859
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,520
if you have a reoccurring cough

1860
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,520
if you have a reoccurring cough

1861
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,520
please do get checked out

1862
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,520
for COPD

1863
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,520
very not fun condition

1864
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,520
so please do look after yourself

1865
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,520
unironically

1866
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,520
check out hearingstrone

1867
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,520

1868
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,520
please tell me you can come

1869
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,520
into our members stream

1870
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,520
I want to say really inappropriate things

01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,520

I am going to have to go

1893
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,520
because I need to

1894
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,520
set up for a membership stream

1895
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,520

1897
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,520

1901
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,520
