130000	134000	Mercy's emotes approved I'm just waiting for the delivery so they could be thingied
134000	137000	there was two mistakes with Azur's emotes
137000	141000	so I had to pay an extra couple of dollars do's
141000	144000	but the sneaky little sneaker tins
144000	149000	they extended the delivery time by three weeks to fix two emotes
149000	153000	and they already have taken quite a while
153000	157000	so I need to wait until Mercy and Azur's batch of 10 are done
157000	161000	before I can order everyone else's missing slot emotes
161000	163000	is that my sense?
163000	165000	so I can't do anything yet
165000	167000	my hands are tied

191000	194000	who wrote that? it was me at the time
194000	197000	it was absolutely outrageous behaviour
197000	201000	honestly outrageous
201000	205000	is that doom music playing in the background?
205000	207000	but I hope not
207000	210000	there shouldn't be any music playing in the background
210000	212000	this is what plays in the background
212000	214000	but it's a bit sad
214000	216000	but anyway

227000	229000	so
229000	231000	now I do have two more streams of shorter games
231000	234000	just so I can catch up on the ASMR I need to record
234000	239000	because I need to record about 3 hours worth of shit I'm missing
239000	242000	but the good news is
242000	245000	it lets me catch up on all my work
245000	248000	now I do have a message for your reflins
248000	250000	but I can't read it yet or I'm gonna cry
250000	253000	so I'll read it tomorrow
253000	255000	I can't read it today
255000	257000	or I'll greet my eyes out
257000	260000	I miss pap already
260000	262000	aww I miss him too I was so sad
262000	264000	both of us were like
264000	267000	I was like I didn't want to cry in front of him
267000	269000	as he was going
269000	271000	so I was like
271000	273000	so there's this fucking meme for this stupid thing
273000	275000	I don't know what it is
275000	277000	but the meme goes
277000	279000	be strong, Clarence be strong for mama
279000	282000	and that's what goes in my head
282000	284000	when I try and tell myself not to laugh
284000	286000	not to cry sorry
286000	288000	like to try and cheer me up
288000	290000	I can't remember what the meme is
290000	292000	but it's like be strong, Clarence be strong for mama
294000	296000	so he didn't see me cry
296000	298000	but as soon as like
298000	300000	I couldn't see him anymore
300000	302000	oh god I'm getting emotional
302000	305000	ok we're playing a little to the left today
305000	307000	which is a puzzle game ok
307000	309000	now as well no puzzle game
309000	311000	so it's my biggest enemy
311000	313000	because it requires IQ

503000	505000	unfortunately I'm Scottish but
505000	507000	the good thing is it gives me frost resistance
507000	509000	so it's not bad
509000	511000	if you would like
511000	513000	to consider yourself
513000	515000	an enjoyer of me
515000	517000	you can refer to yourself
517000	519000	as a replay
519000	521000	or replay
521000	523000	when you came and you gave me a
523000	525000	kiss
525000	527000	I reached a round
527000	529000	and
529000	531000	you got a thousand dollar dono

537000	539000	so
539000	541000	identify as an ord
541000	543000	I am translucent with how pale I am
543000	545000	you can see my entire vascular
545000	547000	system at a glance
547000	549000	that's how pale I am
549000	551000	I literally have hues
551000	553000	of purple and blue thanks to
553000	555000	my veins that I am that pale
555000	557000	so I would consider myself a
557000	559000	Nord and the name of the Nord
559000	561000	I pray to the Lord you all get a taste
561000	563000	of my blade and my sword I'm taking on

573000	575000	very almost purple esk under
575000	577000	my eyeballs and relay which means I'm

589000	591000	dare you
591000	593000	he spoke nothing but the truth I'm
593000	595000	insulted by such words
595000	597000	and yet no true words were spoken in that
597000	599000	moment my goodness
599000	601000	you could probably put it to scripture that's
601000	603000	so truthful he was being in that moment
603000	605000	aww absolutely annihilated
605000	607000	honestly sun gets reflect

623000	625000	talk to you Evelyn I'd be a puddle
625000	627000	right now and I just
627000	629000	thought this game was gonna go shite because
629000	631000	it's a fucking puzzle game
631000	633000	it requires IQ
633000	635000	the beacons are lit have you slept
635000	637000	so I
637000	639000	stayed up last night
639000	641000	writing scripts for the girls
641000	643000	so
643000	645000	AC has a script
645000	647000	about scratching your back
647000	649000	because obviously she's a polar bear and she's got
649000	651000	claws right so
651000	653000	I
653000	655000	wrote a script about AC that she gives you like back
655000	657000	scratches in the middle of the night and she has
657000	659000	her sleepy voice on okay
659000	661000	and then I wrote one for
661000	663000	Mercy where it's Yandere
663000	665000	it gives you a haircut while she's tied you up
665000	667000	in your bed ASMR
667000	669000	it's the most bizarre thing I've ever written in my life
669000	671000	are you squiddin me right now
671000	673000	I'm fucking giggling away at myself over it
673000	675000	and then Azura's is a
675000	677000	dummy mummy
677000	679000	praises you in your sleep
679000	681000	ASMR I've not finished Azura's
681000	683000	but I'm about to
683000	685000	but I sent it to Mercy and Mercy's like oh
685000	687000	I actually wrote some stuff for myself
687000	689000	and then Azura was like oh I actually
689000	691000	got some stuff to do YouTube ASMR
691000	693000	with and I'm like
693000	695000	my daughters don't even need me
695000	697000	I'm being outsourced already

707000	709000	well I tried
709000	711000	and it's very interesting to see the things
711000	713000	that people don't share you are amazing
713000	715000	thank you I appreciate it
715000	717000	yeah I
717000	719000	personally I have
719000	721000	problems being like this is what it looks like
721000	723000	behind the scenes because I think a lot of people
723000	725000	don't get the opportunity to really see
725000	727000	that which is why I want to be like
727000	729000	hey we might be a small
729000	731000	agency but I did put a bit
731000	733000	of thought behind you know
733000	735000	gets an exchange of services and
735000	737000	trying to earn my money you know
737000	739000	I might be shocking
739000	741000	but mummy

757000	759000	they're all grown up outsourced in the first
759000	761000	month honestly
763000	765000	I've got a collab with AC and Emmy
765000	767000	to write but so there's one
767000	769000	on Emmy's channel of her and AC
769000	771000	but I need to do it the other way
771000	773000	around and I think I want to do it
773000	775000	like Bratz give you a haircut
775000	777000	because I need to record new haircut sounds
779000	781000	well piss
781000	783000	what I'm so sorry that was my accent

793000	795000	I said piss in your name there's not it's just
795000	797000	I just can't read properly
797000	799000	I'm so sorry I think I might do like
799000	801000	two Bratz cut your hair in the middle of the
801000	803000	night for Emmy and AC and they're whispering
803000	805000	to themselves about how mischievous
805000	807000	they both are and then you just get like
807000	809000	back like over the cheek
809000	811000	and then like kind of like the midnight
811000	813000	barber mean for the mighty bush if you've
813000	815000	ever seen that it's about a British
815000	817000	comedy yeah

983000	985000	I get considered British cause technically
985000	987000	you know United Kingdom, Scotland

989000	991000	however
991000	993000	yes
993000	995000	I'm not gonna lie
995000	997000	first agency I liked all the members
997000	999000	and I actually sit through the streams
999000	1001000	so
1001000	1003000	obviously
1003000	1005000	the girls are free to discuss their PL
1005000	1007000	stuff but I've kinda said this
1007000	1009000	like everyone got picked cause I saw a bit
1009000	1011000	of myself in them
1011000	1013000	and I have a bias for the underdog
1013000	1015000	I don't give a shit
1015000	1017000	if you think that's a bad whatever
1017000	1019000	I like the underdog
1019000	1021000	obviously the only exception is kinda
1021000	1023000	me the Emmy if you want to get
1023000	1025000	takey spaky
1025000	1027000	but Emmy

1029000	1031000	was I've said this before
1031000	1033000	Emmy was quite inquisitive during the interview stage
1033000	1035000	and she was like
1035000	1037000	asking how it would work behind the scenes
1037000	1039000	and she was very keen to start on something new
1039000	1041000	and I can completely
1041000	1043000	relate on a personal level
1043000	1045000	of being like I don't wanna do this shit
1045000	1047000	no more on my own like fuck it let's

3716040	3718760	I've no go clue colors
3720200	3728120	You know last time magic segregation was like way back in the fucking past. What the fuck are we doing sort by colors for?
3730120	3732120	What the fuck? I can't figure it out
3735800	3742920	Purple right, there's purple here a purple there. Then that's the balsamic fucking piece of shit
3744200	3746200	Right, so now what?
3748120	3750120	Align the labels
3751640	3753640	What they're supposed to fucking kiss
3754760	3756760	Where how is that supposed to
3760440	3762440	I
3767880	3774360	What what even is this laying the labels on my back
3776760	3779160	What it's all supposed to like touch or something
3781400	3784280	Olive oil next to the milk
3790360	3792360	So
3806440	3809800	Whatever vv said about this game she was right
3812120	3814120	What
3815320	3817560	I can see something forming here
3821000	3823400	I don't think we should all the luck
3841160	3847000	I don't even have a brain cell to talk and try and figure this out at the same time. Are we skipped you doodling?
3847080	3852680	I think you're overthinking it. Well, how do I open up the menu?
3865000	3869640	Tubbs and mayonnaise to milk to balsamic
3873560	3875960	There's a fucking line there's a hidden line
3877960	3880200	Right tub to mayonnaise to milk
3882600	3884600	Tub
3885400	3890840	To mayonnaise to milk something I already forgot
3898280	3900280	Ah
3901240	3908280	It's milk to balsamic to thingy to the medium the milk to the stomach
3916280	3918280	I still not afraid again
3918280	3920280	So
3935960	3937960	Space them
3948280	3950280	Oh
3964920	3966920	Yeah, that's getting a bit too much
3967400	3972440	That's getting a bit too much hold on a minute. VV was right. Hashtag VV was right. I'm not even being funny
3973080	3975080	Oh
3975800	3977800	Are you trying to soften me up after that one?
3979240	3981240	pooders
3991160	3997160	Any cheesers it's been funny, but I've got a shower. Oh, yeah, the puzzle really got you good
4000440	4003080	Oh, okay, right I can tell the story um
4005640	4014840	Okay, he has an idea. He wants to spill the drink. Okay. He drops the bath and the drink and plant
4016520	4021160	Wait, we're just taking photos of our cat destroying stuff. We're like we're just letting it happen. Um
4026520	4030840	Oh, no, it's going downhill. I thought I was doing so well, but my logic isn't
4031000	4032120	Uh
4032120	4036600	The reason the earth is not flat is this cat so didn't knock everything off switch the first
4037640	4039640	switch the first
4039640	4041640	second
4042600	4044600	And throw the round
4051000	4053500	You guys watch me do it the wrong way
4061800	4063800	I
4065480	4068040	Wait if I don't every combination but the correct one
4070360	4073880	You guys have to look at the drink first and then he gets an idea to knock things over
4074600	4078680	Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looks at the drink and then he gets a bright idea to knock shit over
4080360	4082360	And then he knocks stuff over
4083160	4085560	First he sees the glass and then the lamp
4086520	4090840	Okay, he sees it and then he gets a bright idea to start knocking stuff over
4092040	4094040	Okay, maybe another color puzzle
4097560	4100120	Nettie gray, how many chapters are there?
4101320	4106840	We're actually kind of get I mean we may actually do this. Hold on a minute. I have a little bit fee
4116520	4119480	I spoke far too soon and I'm sorry
4122120	4124120	Oh, I see something
4125960	4130280	Okay, I see something I see something I see something here
4130280	4132280	And this
4141800	4145320	There's five chapters I have a little bit of faith sees the next puzzle
4147400	4149400	Right these two fit
4150520	4154920	Okay, these three fit and the glove fits the fingerprints on that one. So
4156760	4158760	Okay, okay, okay
4158840	4161480	Okay, it doesn't work. Oh wait, those two work together
4176600	4179160	The bucket seems like it has to go there
4182920	4184920	Yeah
4189640	4193240	No, you can but you bump into him
4197320	4201400	All right, everything bumps into the bucket so the bucket has to go at the end
4203160	4210360	That is my only logical conclusion the bucket has to go there. Okay, right then we'll figure out what happens over here
4219640	4221640	Oh
4223000	4225000	Wait, what does it look right?
4226440	4230840	Everything looks correct other than this one go in the bucket go in the bucket
4232760	4234760	Go in the bucket
4237320	4239480	I'm cleaning them make them shine
4243720	4246680	This looks correct I gone crazy
4249560	4252520	This oh the sponge goes in the square space
4259560	4264360	Sponges, why are we no longer participating in the laws of physics all of a sudden
4265240	4270120	Why is physics just optional now in the game right? I'll need to keep that in mind
4271080	4273080	I
4275080	4279640	Physics is no optional got a G's right big batteries
4282680	4284680	I am speed
4286040	4288040	I am speed
4288120	4290120	I am speed
4290680	4292680	I am speed
4295880	4297880	You don't belong here
4301080	4308040	You might belong here though. Yeah, that looks correct correct in Mundo
4310200	4312600	Nope, you can't all fit in there you're too big
4315320	4317320	Okay, okay, okay
4322040	4324040	That looks
4330520	4334600	I mean them I'm gonna see
4348600	4351160	The yellow one on the place of the one
4355720	4358220	Thank you for rather violent
4360440	4362440	All you want to then
4376840	4381560	Okay, this one's cute I like it I like it I dig it I dig it angry sneeze
4382920	4387000	It was so loud my screen flickered. That's hilarious
4391080	4393480	What's wrong? Oh, that's right
4396040	4398040	That is different therefore it's wrong
4398680	4403400	Okay, there we go. Oh, it's a good one. Okay. I like that one. I like that one. Let him get up
4403560	4408680	Okay, the game might have redeemed itself slightly scream again, please. That was a sneeze
4410440	4413400	You've got coins. So this is a 50-pence coin
4420120	4422120	Okay
4430200	4432840	Go from a circle
4435320	4437880	Into a lesser circle over time
4450360	4455880	A circle how many sides one two three four five six
4456760	4460600	Seven eight nine ten one two three four. Oh you
4462440	4465880	Wait one two three four five six seven
4468760	4475080	One two three four five six one two three four five six nine
4475080	4477080	Ten
4493640	4500440	I'm sorry. I'm special needs. Hold on a minute. What I know what I'm trying to do but it's not coming out
4500840	4502840	So
4503160	4506520	Well, I just did more circling. Oh, they start
4511320	4513320	Why would you start
4516200	4518200	Why would you start
4519320	4521320	Why did you start
4522120	4524120	I
4528600	4530600	Mean
4530840	4535480	I'll take it. She's what that was an accidental discovery
4537320	4539320	Let's try that that was the
4544120	4547000	Maybe it's better to do the more obtuse items first
4547400	4550760	Is that even fit
4553320	4555320	That's what she said
4556760	4559800	Get it get it because
4562040	4565000	No, do the more obscure items you look obscure
4566360	4570200	Anything that looks mainly different than the usual getting out
4573640	4576040	What even is oh it's a tea infuser
4577720	4581240	You put your dry tea in it one chopstick
4585880	4590200	Sorry, there's a really good vein and the guy's like I'll have one
4591880	4593880	Of your ass or
4597320	4599320	No, no, no, no, no, you're not left to be
4600760	4605320	Being out here. What? Oh, it's one of those that makes sense
4607960	4611880	My god, I you knew it. Oh, you know it. You know it
4613640	4615640	Uh
4616280	4619640	Wait, is there only like one no, I can't hear it
4624360	4630600	Okay, the spoon has to be this one because of this little arch way thing going on I refuse to believe they didn't
4637160	4643080	We can oh wait, do the wee ones go together? Oh the wee spoons go there
4651720	4655000	Well, all done next round, uh, what
4658040	4660040	Anything like fine
4661640	4663640	No, this is correct
4667320	4673640	If I just shake it the game will surely accept it. Can you stack the red spoons again? They're stacked in a weird order
4675240	4677240	Sorry, sorry
4677720	4679240	Right just type in
4679240	4680840	Rebecca's
4680840	4682840	Take away, okay
4683800	4687720	And you'll understand you'll understand why I go out there
4691000	4693000	Because if you've got my accent, would you?
4693240	4695240	Wait until you open up
4695560	4698040	Today, we're going to pack this customer's order
4699800	4705880	They ordered a bit at Becca's munchie belongs. Sorry. The mixer doesn't fit

4741000	4745640	Oh, we're opposite Greek and we don't have a paddle. It's the tea infuser
4745640	4747640	Oh
4749480	4753400	That was very specific. Um, I mean
4754520	4758280	It's all right. I'll get I get it. I get it. I could have got the hint because the things
4767880	4770680	I'm to go off of pure babes alone
4773080	4775080	Oh
4775640	4780120	I mean if the game helps me and points them the right way then sure, but uh
4782200	4784200	No
4787720	4789720	No
4790840	4792840	No

4810840	4812840	I want to put it up
4813800	4815800	I don't know what's gotten into me today
4817720	4819720	It's clearly not
4823560	4826600	Stop stop talking do you understand? Okay
4828280	4830280	Oh, okay
4831080	4833080	Okay
4833880	4835880	Okay
4848440	4850440	I think we're doing it
4851160	4853160	Oh
4859320	4862520	Okay, what is this though packing peanuts
4865000	4869400	Strawberries and a mid-today we first prepare for the most intense ink extraction
4869480	4874280	No, I'm too depressed to express for right now, but uh, oh this looks like a nightmare
4875080	4878440	After I have a few days to recover
4879400	4884040	Please don't be surprised if I start using my alternative to wear a heck of a lot more
4884520	4886760	Oh, wait, is this a hint that the candles go here?
4888040	4890040	No
4895320	4897320	I'm a bit nervous on this one after
4901880	4903880	Right remove everything
4905320	4907320	Let's just close the doors not our problem
4909400	4912040	It must I hope it was
4919880	4922120	Okay, we're a bit of a rough start bit of a rough
4924440	4928920	Okay, this can't go sideways so the only place it literally can fit
4932280	4934280	Had a lot
4935320	4937320	I'm not satisfied
4939000	4941000	Oh
4942200	4944200	This is a tricky one
4945960	4948280	Oh, it's obvious
4952840	4954840	Dave
4956040	4958040	Oh, I need like
4961000	4963000	Oh, this one's a scary one
4969240	4974520	Hey, okay, that I'm satisfied with I'm satisfied with that. Okay. Let's get that right. I've got a knife
4977320	4979080	Got a knife
4979080	4980360	Maybe
4980360	4984600	It doesn't seem to go up and down so it has to be so good. So I'm gonna I'm gonna go to PR
4985880	4987880	I'm very unconfident
4989240	4992520	Sizzlers. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me get up
4993320	4994840	Ah
4994840	4998920	Usb it can go either way. It was oh no, can I go up and down?
4999640	5005560	What was that? No, I saw that I saw that you were trying to turn at something. What were you turning at be honest? Oh
5007640	5009880	Okay usb you fit there
5011080	5015480	This is a very specific strony. What do you have there a knife? No
5023480	5025480	All right, I'm gonna be honest with you
5033400	5037000	But there's only one two three four crayons
5039240	5041240	Is it possible that
5042280	5044920	I mean he fits when I go there. Where were the candles go?
5045720	5050200	Well, something please think of the candles the candles don't have a home if you steal them
5051000	5053000	I might have to go up here
5054680	5057240	Although they don't look very organized up here
5058920	5062120	And there's literally nowhere else for them to go so like
5075880	5077880	I don't have much faith in this one to be honest
5078840	5080840	Why are you going sideways?
5082840	5089160	I'm gonna put that one there for now, but I feel like that's a red herring, but it's okay. What do you?
5090920	5092920	I don't even want to know what that's useful
5094760	5097400	From tall it you have some more candles or more
5099960	5101960	But I don't what's
5103400	5105400	Maybe it is the section I mean
5108120	5110120	Maybe
5114200	5116200	They all look like the same height
5118280	5120280	Candles go top left
5122920	5124920	Oh my god, you're so right
5127320	5129320	You're actually so right
5133320	5135320	Four paper clubs
5136280	5138280	Buttons a whistle
5159720	5161720	One more
5162120	5166840	Right, okay, the candles I'm satisfied with I can see I've got two buttons
5169880	5171880	I've got three tax
5174760	5178520	One ear cleaner just randomly I'm gonna go that's what you use more for
5179320	5181320	I'm gonna do a short bit behind

5213560	5215560	I'm not even gonna pretend. I wouldn't have got that
5216360	5218360	one singular
5218360	5221080	Now try to imagine what purpose this kit has truly

5296360	5300520	Refleens we need to find the key to your cage. Stop stop. That's not funny
5314120	5317400	One two prying one frame one frame
5319960	5321960	That looks like the Elden Ring
5322920	5329880	Game or brain rot setting and I'm so sorry. We can't leave our cage mercy one less. Oh, no, no, not that kind of cage
5332920	5334920	We're not sniffing it's more
5335880	5342360	Preferable we lock you up in an hour. Oh, imagine locking me up just to send me a bed, right? Let's do
5343160	5345160	Len

5350520	5352520	Lent first
5357560	5361000	Oh, I've just noticed you know what I've just noticed as this doesn't work
5361320	5364760	There's like numbers of rings in here like two rings
5365560	5367560	five holes three
5367960	5369960	Um
5374040	5380600	Oh, no, I accepted the length. Okay. I accept it. Okay. I was gonna say yeah, definitely something with the holes three one four six two
5380840	5382840	Something something, you know
5383880	5385880	I think that'll be the alternative
5390600	5392600	Okay
5393320	5397000	Why is there a golden tooth? Why would you keep that?
5398280	5400780	Okay, we've got an acorn
5407000	5412760	We've got a doo-dah I need pee actually. Oh my god. I'm allowed to pee on streams again
5416920	5420680	Right, this is clearly too big for that section so we can only go in this section
5421080	5423880	I'm gonna remove these because I'm not sure how much I believe them

7661480	7663480	Right. It can't be that
7663720	7667000	Rotate the fuck out of this plank. That's not the mission objective
7671800	7673800	Go for symmetry
7681880	7683880	So
7703800	7705800	Symmetry
7706680	7708680	I
7711720	7713720	Would not have gotten that ever
7716360	7721880	I would not have gone that ever if he didn't say that I would not have figured that out that was far too difficult
7723320	7726600	Oh, it's um, okay deep red
7729960	7734120	Changing hues thank goodness. I'm not colorblind, huh?
7736200	7750600	Yeah, okay. Okay. I saw it. I saw it. I've done something's off for the queue. Perfect. It's the
7754040	7758600	This is very bright on me eyeballs. Oh, they're kissing
7766440	7768440	Yes, I'm off the screen. Uh
7775960	7780360	Which one has the cat on it pick a jar any jar any jar at all
7780440	7784920	It's yours. I promise there's money and I'm not scamming pick a jar any jar refling any
7787560	7789560	Uh
7790120	7794680	Oh, I see it. I see it. I saw it see it see it sword
7795800	7797880	Yeah, I see with the leaves even here
7800280	7802280	The right jar
7803480	7808200	You see emmy's ginger when she's clearly blonde and what universe is she blonde?
7808360	7815400	I don't know if this is like a culture thing or something and what universe is any blonde genuinely
7817240	7819240	She's clearly a yin-yang
7819400	7823240	So I'm not really sure why it's even up for debacle
7823720	7826920	I was very surprised when she was like, I'm I'm ginger
7827720	7831400	Yes, emmy you literally have orange hair your ginger
7834200	7838280	She's definitely blonde. Oh wait, are you being serious or am I getting trolled?
7840200	7845240	Am I being trolled? I'm unironically doing a poll right now. I think this must be a culture clash
7845960	7846840	because
7846840	7847880	uh
7847880	7849480	What?
7849480	7851480	Oh, that's me. Hi. Um
7852440	7854440	Hold on start a poll
7855720	7860760	Oh, I just closed the tab. Well, nice try. Let's try that again. We should try another poll. Gee
7861560	7863560	Okay, add poll
7864840	7866840	What hair
7867800	7872440	Hair color do you think emmers is question mark?
7873400	7874760	She's
7874760	7876760	She's ginger
7877960	7880600	Orange and brackets for those of you who are dumb
7881880	7884520	Because you're a dumb dumb if you think she's literally blonde
7885480	7887480	she's
7887800	7890440	Blonde and brackets yellow
7891960	7893960	And what?
7906040	7908040	Right there we go start full
7908520	7910920	Okay, I'm literally doing a poll and chat right now
7911880	7919000	What hair color do you think emmy is she's ginger and brackets orange? She's blonde and brackets
7919480	7925160	Yellow in what world is she actually blonde? Please be so for real right now. Are you mental?
7927160	7933720	I think she's a ginger blonde. No, you cannot be ginger blonde. You're either a ginger or you're a blonde
7934360	7941800	She's blonde at the top and it transitions to gingerish near the bottom. I've shown you her concepts are she's a yin or
7943240	7948040	Literally pumpkin hair. She's pumpkin themed voodoo doll themed
7948840	7950840	She's a yin or
7952360	7958920	I hope the last option is now do a poll for as there is hair color. Oh, you guys are gonna be split on that one
7959480	7968520	See you elite. I don't 35% of you think she's blonde. I used to be honest. Are you strong? Do you actually think she's blonde?
7969240	7977080	Thank you for the tip tiny spainy. How is she blonde? She's orange. She's a pumpkin. Her hair is themed after pumpkins
7978120	7979320	orange
7979320	7980760	Oh
7980760	7987080	Right now to do the real one. Okay. The veal or hair colors are the real a little bit bro, right? Let's do a zero
7987480	7989080	Azura's
7989080	7991080	hair color is
7993640	7995800	Green
7995800	7997800	blue
8009640	8011640	Okay, there we go
8013000	8015720	All right, those never pull up for Azura's hair color
8017160	8019160	I
8023240	8025400	Your choice is is it green?
8027560	8029560	Are you
8030680	8034120	I'm not even teal. Are you squidding me right now?
8037160	8039800	I don't have a said blonde liar
8040600	8042200	absolutely
8042280	8047080	Azura is literally a blue green mix. It's called teal. That's what I said. She's teal
8048520	8055080	It's awkward marine, which is a shade of green. No, don't say such things. It's seafoam green, which is green
8055480	8057880	No, don't say such things
8058520	8063320	Do you have long and right? I'll tell you what we're gonna look at. Azura's a seafoam
8063640	8068920	Mostly blue with hints of green teal would be mostly green with hints of blue
8069800	8071800	Oh
8072520	8074520	Are you squidding me right now?
8078200	8080600	We're being debated unironically
8081800	8085400	Pull up the color chart. You know what maybe her
8087960	8093720	Her concept art was a bit more accurate. Thank you tiny spanish. Thank you. Okay. Don't are you squidding me right?
8093720	8101560	Maybe it's a strawberry blonde. What universe? Hold on. I'm actually right strawberry blonde
8102200	8104200	Let's look it up and ask
8105560	8107560	That's orange
8109880	8114200	That's all I will literally show you the first picture that shows up
8116760	8119100	I'm getting heated. I'm actually getting heated
8121240	8122600	That's
8122600	8124600	orange
8124600	8126600	And what universe?
8129560	8131560	Where the fuck is the picture show me
8138680	8140680	Okay
8141000	8143400	Okay, this is what comes up
8144360	8148360	This claw is what comes up when you take strawberry blonde
8149160	8156200	It's orange. I'm sorry. It's orange. It's ginger
8157640	8159080	Oh my god
8159080	8165480	I'm getting trolled so hard. This is ginger. I type in strawberry blonde. Please your blood pressure. That's ginger. Thank you
8167240	8172200	And now you're saying Azura's got green hair. I'm getting trolled so hard. Oh my god the first oh
8173400	8176120	It's ginger. She's she's a yinya
8178600	8181480	Okay, right. Let's unbreak
8188360	8191560	The book is a logic puzzle on this yin. Like that?
8200360	8202360	What do you mean she's no ginger? I need her
8203080	8207080	I birthed her from my lungs. I'm convinced Johnny. She emmys 100 ginger
8208040	8210040	She's 100 ginger from the start
8210760	8214840	Her concept art. She's a pumpkin. She's based after a pumpkin and a
8216040	8217960	voodoo stuff
8217960	8220920	I were tame as she's still going down straight. I'm still going
8221560	8223560	I'm mlg at this game
8227400	8233640	Are you squidding me right now? Ah anonymous you need to visit a doctor. We are very worried for your eyes
8233800	8241480	Are you I'm not colorblind. I will rob. I don't know. Um, it must be a culture clash thing. That's just straight up ginger
8243080	8249320	Like what do you think a ginger person looks like then and then don't say eric from freaking south part
8253080	8258280	What is this I have no idea what i'm doing right now. I'm so sorry

8300440	8303880	We'll crab legs are together little horns are together
8305800	8307800	With an iron horn

8922680	8927000	All right. All right. All right. I know she's about to ask this is her seed spread
8927640	8932120	Mommy puzzle moment puzzle. She disconnected from it. Is chat disconnected?
8932840	8936760	Will you and the girls ever use scripts posted to read it? No, we need the legal copyright
8937160	8942120	Of it. So we can't use that kind of stuff unless like someone came to us and we're like, hey
8943400	8945720	I give you all rights to this
8945720	8947720	Oh
8950680	8953000	But no, we cannot do that for copyright reasons
8957480	8966280	Wow, I love this one. It's so pretty just like you're reefing pretty little puzzles
8970280	8974040	What are you? I don't even know what seed you are. That's fantastic
8975720	8977720	I
8992280	8995960	Poppy this is a poppy seed. This is where you get opium from
8998280	9000280	Yes, I'm telling the truth
9000360	9001800	if you didn't know
9001880	9006840	Okay, and where when our derivatives of a plant
9008280	9014920	Um for the poppies you have to slash them before they bloom and then they'll secrete the opium
9016600	9019800	It's rather fascinating. Honestly, that's why like
9020760	9028120	Meth is because it's like lab made it's so dangerous and much more addicting because like literally it was produced to be that way
9028600	9032120	So very scary stuff. That's why you should never smoke crack
9033080	9036200	Because it's man made and the effects are insane
9036840	9041960	Whereas at least if you did her um cooking or heroin, you know, it's from a plant. So
9042920	9044760	It's a little bit better
9044760	9049560	Because it's not as bad, but it's not necessarily that good as well. So don't get
9049800	9051800	Is
9054600	9058360	Well, these three are the same color and have stripes these
9060040	9062040	Oh, but that one's the same
9063800	9067160	You're the only thing we need. Ah, are you so sweet people?
9072600	9076440	Well, you ever have male members in veal or sadly not no, um
9077080	9079080	The reason veal work is
9079080	9084200	You know can work is because the team is female content careers behind the scene
9085000	9086280	um
9086280	9089400	And unfortunately like I can't advise on male creation because I
9091560	9093560	What the heck am I supposed to do
9095560	9097560	This one's a curious pale
9099800	9101800	Hmm
9101800	9106120	Maybe if it's got like black
9109000	9111000	Like
9111160	9113720	That's got pink pink pink
9116120	9118120	Green
9123160	9127800	Why am I trying to achieve I'm not really sure I'm trying though
9132200	9134200	Oh, this one's tricky
9134840	9138520	Competing as a meal. Give me that strontium baby
9140600	9142600	Solids in the corner
9147320	9149320	Oh
9153000	9159160	That's so good. Good catch reflin. That's such a good one. Oh, I like that one
9160120	9162120	I would never have thought of that. That was a good one
9165320	9167640	Mild case of severe strontia addiction
9168680	9170680	Stainless reflin
9171480	9174520	Oh dear, right. We need a corner piece if there is any
9176760	9178760	Dear
9179240	9184040	I really feel like there's much corner pieces at all. Well, maybe you
9189160	9191160	Think
9216840	9218840	Hmm
9219160	9234480	Oh wow, I'm struggling with this one, wait let me kick a little bit though.
9234480	9249040	I don't have any corner pieces, how can I be, oh, is it color-
9249120	9252720	I can't be color-coordinator, so I'm gonna puzzle together.
9252720	9257760	How can a puzzle be a puzzle if it isn't puzzle-together?
9257760	9260080	It's a myth.
9260080	9263920	No.
9263920	9273440	Let me try to quickly find the solution, I'm sorry!
9273520	9279120	That was like a corner piece.
9279120	9284320	Maybe?
9284320	9290080	Pink when you have in top right should be bottom right.
9290080	9293040	I knew that.
9293040	9296720	You're on about honestly, I'm so obviously-
9296720	9301040	I don't know, do you get embarrassed being wrong all the time, refund?
9301120	9304400	Let's try to do that.
9306960	9309920	Oh that looks right.
9312480	9317920	Oh yeah, ooh up a bit.
9320320	9323840	Well that looks correct.
9323840	9326880	Look they're kissing!
9327120	9335280	Hmm, doesn't seem too right on this bit, I'm not convinced.
9335280	9337440	Need to kiss another day because I don't think-
9337440	9341440	Okay that looks more like a okay, how?
9342000	9347440	Okay you, you kiss right now.
9347440	9358000	Okay, okay.
9358000	9368000	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
9368000	9375120	This is not look right to me at all, what the fuck, I see so hard.
9375200	9381040	Kicking? I don't know, am I kicking? I don't know what is the little green one
9381040	9383680	in between.
9389680	9394000	Very true, very true.
9394000	9397680	But I cannot do shapes at all.
9398560	9407760	Well no, these- right, so don't get rid of it just yet, but-
9409360	9412320	Bro, I can't do isometric shapes!
9412320	9417280	Oh, what? Nothing fits!
9418480	9421760	I don't look right.
9422240	9425760	Like that, no.
9425760	9428880	Right, okay, hold on.
9429600	9433840	It's just- okay, okay, okay.
9434560	9442320	Okay, okay, okay.
9442320	9449840	I'm here for uh-huh, maybe, possibly, possibly.
9452320	9458240	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, okay, don't, don't, don't let up now.
9458240	9465040	Don't let up now, oh, oh, oh!
9465040	9471760	We did it! That was so good! It all came together!
9471760	9475920	Yeah, you can do it, replaying, see? That's proof why you gotta keep
9475920	9479200	persevering. It doesn't matter if you keep jamming it in over and over, you'll
9479200	9481760	eventually get the result you want.
9481760	9486320	Stronikals 2024, thank you.
9486320	9490720	Okay, let's see what we're dealing with here.
9492000	9499920	Hydration check! What do you mean by that? Hydration, hydration, hydration!
9501440	9504720	Are your, are your strontium copium levels going up?
9504720	9510240	Know that I can do longer streams again?
9510240	9517600	Oh, is this symmetry be honest?
9517600	9523920	Oh, actually, I just clicked off him. It is symmetry, right, okay.
9529040	9532720	Oh, are we free of restrictions? I thought we had a little more time.
9532720	9537280	Um, I'm still feeling depresi-wessy because my dad's gone.
9537280	9543600	Um, but I am going to focus on the work that I missed because there's a
9543600	9547360	lot of v-tubers that are waiting for me to edit the collabs that
9547360	9552480	they were very keen to agree to me with. So I've got a bit of a work ahead but
9552480	9556080	don't be surprised when there's a bit of an explosion of ASMR videos on my
9556080	9559120	YouTube channel or on Patreon as well.
9559120	9569520	Um.
9580080	9585520	It's symmetry. Kitty! No, you're doing it.
9586080	9591920	Symmetry's in a lot of pockets. Yeah, this seems to be the reason.
9594320	9598240	I hope you feel better soon. Yeah, it's trying to explode on Patreon, yeah.
9598240	9605920	No worries, take your time, yeah. Um, it's why I picked three shorter games, just...
9606320	9610320	Eh.
9614560	9616320	Oh wait.
9620400	9622320	Is that what I'm supposed to find?
9624480	9628320	I think so, I think I just suck on putting it in, please.
9630640	9634320	Oh, you zoom out.
9636800	9640160	Oh, there's snowflakes.
9640880	9643840	That's not right then.
9647760	9651760	Did you know something, something snowflakes aren't all equally created or
9651760	9656320	something? Ah, I found it.
9658240	9661120	Uh, well your gemmets put ASMR in their Patreon channels as well.
9661120	9667600	Yes, they already have audios of the variety up.
9667600	9670160	More?
9670160	9674800	Oh, more.
9681280	9685200	Okay, and then we just need the ends.
9685760	9689440	They're like little banisters. Okay, this one is a cute one, I like that one.
9689440	9691760	That one's a good one, good one.
9691760	9697040	Are you gonna make more hypno stuff? Uh, not on Patreon because it's a ban.
9697040	9701200	I'm not allowed to put it on Patreon, unfortunately.
9701200	9709920	Okay, the section, okay. And this one, that's such a good one.
9709920	9713520	I'm here for it, it's a sad one.
9714480	9719280	Mmm, but I'll put it up on Twitter, I have a four part series on Twitter.
9719280	9725600	Once I edit it, I need to edit it first. I've got a lot of editing I need to do
9725600	9729600	actually over the next few days, but I'll get there.
9729600	9736000	Um, you just need to let me... Oh, this is such a good one.
9736000	9739840	I approve very much of this one.
9739840	9743920	Oh, bing.
9743920	9747920	Bing, bing. Yeah, that's what I thought.
9747920	9751600	You better be bing bonging me.
9758240	9764160	Oh, no. Can we release the slides?
9765120	9768480	Oh, no.
9768480	9774960	Oh, what's that? One, two, three. One, two, three.
9774960	9781440	One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
9781440	9790480	Um, Outside one, uh, Opposite again.
9794320	9799520	Oh, there's our spoiler. We fed the spoilers.
9799520	9803040	So proud of you working hard for this one. Yeah, I'm glad.
9803040	9808640	You guys enjoy. Near Earth organizer, what a strange name for a
9808640	9811200	chapter.
9811920	9815840	What's this about Hypno? I like Hypno content, but it's banned
9815840	9820160	on Patreon, so I have to do it on Twitter.
9824160	9840160	Huh?
9840160	9846160	Huh?
9846160	9850160	What, is it not to go there?
9854160	9868160	What's that? Huh?
9868160	9876160	Oh my god, we have to tame it.
9876160	9882160	It becomes a donut. It goes in the hole. It comes on up.
9882160	9892160	Oh, I'm not going to like this one.
9892160	9902160	Okay, go here.
9902160	9908160	Oh, it's because we're in a coffee shop.
9908160	9914160	It's making coffee sound. Oh my god, that's such a strange one.
9914160	9918160	Okay, right. Then we're going to bring it back.
9918160	9922160	We're going to catch it. Then we've got the apple.
9922160	9926160	And we're going to put the apple in the golf.
9926160	9930160	Okay, and then we're going to put it in the cup of tea.
9930160	9934160	Right.
9934160	9944160	Bitch!
9944160	9948160	Right, apple into the golf.
9948160	9952160	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You just, you just hold your horses, sir.
9952160	9958160	We're going to beat the golf into the constellation which drops into a tea or something. I don't know.
9958160	9964160	Oh, do I need to pot it? Maybe I need to pot it.
9964160	9968160	Okay, become a donut. Pull back.
9968160	9974160	And then loads of gravel here.
9974160	9978160	No. No, what?
9978160	9982160	Right.
9982160	9988160	Oh, no.
9988160	9994160	Okay, okay, okay, got worms. So what happens if I make it go right, sir? Does anything happen?
9994160	9998160	No, it's wrong. Okay, that's fine. Now I know it's wrong.
9998160	10002160	Oh, I've just put that in.
10002160	10006160	Right, become a donut. Unbecome a donut.
10006160	10010160	Okay, now we've got an apple. Now go to the golf man.
10010160	10014160	Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous. Now we are going to turn these right side
10014160	10018160	for some ungodly known reason.
10018160	10022160	I don't know why, but we are.
10022160	10026160	Right, well.
10026160	10030160	Oh, God, this is awful.
10030160	10036160	What? Am I not to put it in the hole? Be honest.
10036160	10040160	Oh, you need to overshoot the hole?
10040160	10044160	Who's supposed to figure that out in their day off?
10044160	10048160	Honestly. Right, go in the hole.
10048160	10052160	Go and become a golf ball. And then
10052160	10056160	and then just fucking send it.
10060160	10064160	I did that anyway. You're such a stinky game.
10064160	10068160	Patreon isn't stingy on it.
10068160	10072160	It's actually our Mastercard Overlord.
10072160	10076160	That is the reason why you can't do a lot of stuff.
10076160	10080160	So always thank you.
10080160	10084160	I'm sorry, was that yes to then posting?
10084160	10088160	I do it. I don't really ask the girls to do it just because it's a lot of
10088160	10092160	extra effort, but I could do it.
10092160	10096160	What?
10096160	10100160	What?
10100160	10104160	Uh, I...
10104160	10108160	If you late, save for work, I can maybe get
10108160	10112160	Amy to do that.
10112160	10116160	You spin me.
10116160	10120160	That wanted to stroke midnight or something?
10120160	10124160	Wait, really? What's wrong with the two?
10124160	10128160	Oh, they dictate the whole world.
10128160	10132160	Mastercard dictate everything.
10132160	10136160	They are literally our overlords. Like, I'm not even kidding.
10136160	10140160	That's not me, like, tinfoil hatin'. They literally call the shots on the internet.
10140160	10144160	That's why Patreon ban, like, step...
10144160	10148160	Mm-hmm.
10148160	10152160	And, like, hypnosis, because they said it's, like,
10152160	10156160	there's no consent with it when literally that's
10156160	10160160	actually the entire thing about hypnosis.
10160160	10164160	Yeah, so you have to...
10164160	10168160	What am I doing here? I don't know.
10172160	10176160	Is it in the shadow of that line or something?
10176160	10180160	Mm-hmm.
10180160	10184160	Oh, I was typing it over, so I can mention
10184160	10188160	the PMIC process. They control the money.
10188160	10192160	Yep, server controls the Mastercard, controls the universe.
10192160	10196160	What am I trying to achieve?
10196160	10200160	I don't know.
10200160	10204160	Um...
10204160	10208160	What is this?
10208160	10212160	Mommy, I have to ask, but why is the thumbnail...it's glitched. The thumbnail's correct for me on my
10212160	10216160	end. I'm not sure why.
10216160	10220160	Does it...replay? Hold...right, close your eyes.
10226160	10230160	A singular pale?
10230160	10234160	A singular pale was my frickin' hint.
10242160	10246160	Don't look.
10246160	10250160	It's not a wild dog.
10250160	10254160	Oh, well, excuse me.
10254160	10258160	Hmm.
10258160	10262160	I'll try the quick question. How likely will this be?
10262160	10266160	Oh, no.
10266160	10270160	Huh? Are the shadows wrong? Are these shadows telling
10270160	10274160	you what goes in front of them?
10288160	10292160	What?
10292160	10296160	What?
10296160	10300160	The horse just doesn't care.
10300160	10304160	He's just off on me.
10304160	10308160	Maybe who comes after?
10308160	10312160	Okay.
10312160	10316160	That doesn't make sense, though.
10316160	10320160	Symmetry with a horse in the middle?
10320160	10324160	No, those six people.
10324160	10328160	Maybe Merritt, hate on the shadows?
10328160	10332160	That's a good suggestion.
10332160	10336160	Unfortunately, that's not our solution.
10336160	10340160	What? Size order?
10340160	10344160	I don't know.
10344160	10348160	Staircase thing?
10348160	10352160	Oh, I just realized I'm covering up half of the puzzle.
10352160	10356160	Does that not bother anyone?
10356160	10360160	I'll just be a big-headed ass down here about that.
10360160	10364160	I don't know what you're talking about.
10364160	10368160	Keep playing.
10368160	10372160	You can move the shadows.
10372160	10376160	No way would they do a silly thing like that.
10384160	10388160	The game got real hard to look at every puzzle.
10388160	10392160	I think you're original in the right track.
10392160	10396160	Oh, it's a constellation.
10402160	10406160	What's that?
10406160	10410160	I'm too low IQ to discover such.
10410160	10414160	What's that? I'm too low IQ to discover such.
10414160	10418160	What's that?
10418160	10422160	What's that thing?
10422160	10426160	I don't know, but it's a map.
10426160	10430160	It's not even the map.
10430160	10434160	What's that?
10434160	10438160	I don't know.
10438160	10442160	I don't think so.
10442160	10471720	that was me me that's all I'm saying that was not me

10509240	10524000	place of it honestly this game I didn't think I was gonna like it as much but
10524000	10527280	this is definitely like a solo experience you just want to chill out and
10527280	10532120	not really think too hard other than that kitchen one which was a complete
10532120	10535800	nonsense that was a bit like I'm not being funny but you're taking the piss

10971040	10973040	I need to...
10979040	10981040	Aww.
10981040	10983040	I need to turn this around.
10989040	10991040	So peculiar, truly.
10995040	10997040	Yay.
10999040	11001040	They're getting bigger.
11001040	11003040	Refling, stop getting your tentacles with it.
11003040	11005040	No, it's not the tent.
11005040	11007040	You're trying to put it with your tent.
11011040	11013040	Burn them all again.
11041040	11043040	Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.
11063040	11065040	Don't ever touch an open flame in your home, if I will.
11071040	11073040	They're straight to me.
11073040	11075040	I've got a bit more on you.
11081040	11083040	Oh, you were right, Refling.
11083040	11085040	Thank you.
11085040	11087040	What was the other variation?
11087040	11089040	There seems to be another variation, is that one?
11093040	11095040	There's another one.
11095040	11097040	Right.
11097040	11099040	Oh, we've got a glace ball.
11099040	11101040	There's another one.
11103040	11105040	It looks nice and neat and tidy.
11107040	11109040	Let me clean your room again, Refling.
11111040	11113040	Your punishment for making me do manual labor.
11113040	11115040	Manual labor.
11127040	11129040	I'm making lemonade.
11129040	11131040	Oh, sweet skull.
11135040	11137040	I don't seem to pick up that one.
11143040	11145040	There's one of them.
11153040	11155040	Oh, I like this.
11155040	11157040	Oh, I do.
11157040	11159040	I see you, little fella.
11159040	11161040	I see you.
11161040	11163040	Can you open up?
11163040	11165040	Can you open up?
11167040	11169040	You better unlock right now.
11169040	11171040	Oh, we're going to have problems.
11173040	11175040	We're going to have fisty cuffs.
11189040	11191040	Please open.
11195040	11197040	Oh, the hoops.
11197040	11199040	Oh, how creative.
11219040	11221040	Nothing.
11223040	11225040	Oh, the bits look correct.
11227040	11229040	Let's go back to the manual.
11237040	11239040	It's all good to me.
11243040	11245040	It's really exciting, right?
11257040	11259040	Misalignment.
11261040	11263040	Misalignment on pixel 234.
11263040	11265040	Please correct or you will not proceed.
11265040	11267040	I repeat, you will not proceed.
11267040	11269040	Let's go back up here.
11285040	11287040	Yeah, now the bits are stuck.
11297040	11299040	Hmm.
11307040	11309040	I don't need to put it on.
11311040	11313040	I can fucking chop that fast.
11315040	11317040	What is this thing?
11321040	11323040	You did that.
11327040	11329040	Yeah, it seems to be a misalignment on something.
11331040	11333040	Hmm.
11335040	11337040	Can you?
11339040	11341040	Who or what is misaligned?
11341040	11343040	Misaligned.
11353040	11355040	I think we may have to skip this one
11357040	11359040	to stack the book specifically over the wall.
11359040	11361040	The books are all in a line here.
11381040	11383040	It like bounces it off because it wants to show you the reflection of the stuff.
11383040	11385040	Does that make sense?
11389040	11391040	It wants to show you the reflection
11391040	11393040	so it's trying to bounce it.
11395040	11397040	Who goes there?
11397040	11399040	Hmm.
11399040	11401040	That's a shame.
11401040	11403040	Sorry, I'm satisfied that we did that.
11403040	11405040	I don't know how to chop this lemon
11405040	11407040	but it seems like a half or another thing.
11413040	11415040	We may skip it, you do that.
11415040	11417040	I think we did it.
11417040	11419040	Yeah, I think we did it.
11419040	11421040	Maybe the mirror is supposed to go all the way there.
11429040	11431040	I'm clicking that shit as hard as I can.
11431040	11433040	I think you need to get the mirror on right away.
11435040	11437040	Can you do like a little drive by just so the game moves?
11443040	11445040	It looks right to me.
11445040	11447040	Oh.
11447040	11449040	Open it, put it right.
11449040	11451040	And then put it to the right
11451040	11453040	for the books and that'll show.
11453040	11455040	I think it's being a bit silly.
11463040	11465040	I think it's being a silly Billy.
11465040	11467040	Hmm.
11467040	11469040	Hmm.
11473040	11475040	Okay, I think we'll go next.
11475040	11477040	Is it let it be mean skip?
11477040	11479040	Why would they go let it be?
11483040	11485040	Skip a level?
11485040	11487040	Yeah, it's because you guys are pissed.
11487040	11489040	You didn't code it right.
11489040	11491040	I got an achievement for skipping that level.
11495040	11497040	Okay, we have...
11497040	11499040	Oh, these are those chirpy birds.
11513040	11515040	I see all the buttons on.
11515040	11517040	I love it already.
11517040	11519040	I love not having to think for myself.
11519040	11521040	So...
11523040	11525040	Surely there's nothing better.
11531040	11533040	Um, to make a love fire?
11537040	11539040	Okay, off.
11539040	11541040	Uh-uh.
11541040	11543040	Off, off.
11545040	11547040	You're out of alignment.
11547040	11549040	You're out of alignment.
11549040	11551040	You two are out of alignment.
11559040	11561040	Hey, that's a good one.
11561040	11563040	That is a really good one.
11563040	11565040	I like that one.
11567040	11569040	High IQ, highest IQ.
11569040	11571040	And velar.
11571040	11573040	Not really.
11573040	11575040	I screen shot the crate image in Marshmallow.
11575040	11577040	Okay.
11577040	11579040	What are we doing? I'm doing a little...
11579040	11581040	guess the difference.
11581040	11583040	Hi, pretty kitty.
11591040	11593040	I don't know why, but cats really like when they're...
11597040	11599040	I got pet them in rhythm of the...
11601040	11603040	You mean your tail pet?
11603040	11605040	That's not really, like, feels too much.
11605040	11607040	You mean your chest pet?
11611040	11613040	You mean your ears?
11613040	11615040	Okay.
11615040	11617040	You mean your feetsies pet?
11619040	11621040	Is that all the space?
11623040	11625040	Okay.
11625040	11627040	Oh, sorry. You mean your chin pet?
11629040	11631040	You're a temperamental little fuck, you know that?
11631040	11633040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11635040	11637040	I just keep head pounding?
11637040	11639040	Oh.
11639040	11641040	I was literally...
11641040	11643040	over-complicating that.
11643040	11645040	That was not too early.
11651040	11653040	Okay, the speed is changing, which is why my brain...
11653040	11655040	Yeah, the speed is changing.
11655040	11657040	You fuck.
11657040	11659040	Yeah.
11659040	11661040	They're changing the speed right at the end.
11663040	11665040	They're changing the speed right at the end.
11665040	11667040	So my eyes are like, okay, if I...
11667040	11669040	maintain that speed, that's what it...
11669040	11671040	Yeah, fuck off.
11685040	11687040	We did it?
11687040	11689040	Mr. Mittens is happy?
11691040	11693040	He's gonna claw you?
11693040	11695040	Oh, you're so happy.
11695040	11697040	I love happy eating.
11699040	11701040	Wow.
11701040	11703040	Is this it, J.G.?
11703040	11705040	We did it!
11707040	11709040	Oh, he's actually peeing.
11711040	11713040	Oh, we got, like, a little animation.
11713040	11715040	A little animation?
11717040	11719040	You're feeling very sleepy, Rachel.
11721040	11723040	Oh, they're, like, synchronized swimmers!
11735040	11737040	I can't interact with...
11737040	11739040	nice detail, I see it.
11739040	11741040	Oh, no.
11741040	11743040	I'm not just enjoying the credits,
11743040	11745040	or am I actually to do something here?
11747040	11749040	I don't know if this is the credit.
11749040	11751040	I'm supposed to do something.
11751040	11753040	I can't click on anything.
11753040	11755040	Oh, I can.
11759040	11761040	Can I shake his butt?
11761040	11763040	I can click on me.
11767040	11769040	Everyone, let me...
11769040	11771040	I'm trying to, like, drag them.
11773040	11775040	They're the only things I can grab.
11791040	11793040	Oh, right.
11793040	11795040	Okay, okay, okay, D.
11799040	11801040	Why did you stop? I drink...
11801040	11803040	I take a swig of cola and you all stop?
11803040	11805040	Right, keep doing... yeah, keep...
11805040	11807040	Why are you retained so slowly now?
11807040	11809040	You're keeping me up.
11809040	11811040	Who's out of alignment? Identify yourself.
11813040	11815040	I can't touch anyone.
11823040	11825040	Huh?
11825040	11827040	No one's letting me touch them.
11829040	11831040	Don't you shake your little butts at me.
11833040	11835040	Nothing is letting me interact with it.
11835040	11837040	Two of them, please.
11837040	11839040	I can't grab any of them, though.
11843040	11845040	I don't know if you can hear me
11845040	11847040	spam-clicking in the background.
11847040	11849040	Emmy's rat army merch win.
11849040	11851040	No one's letting me touch them
11851040	11853040	literally at the convention
11853040	11855040	when you guys realize I'm the sexist.
11855040	11857040	I saw an image, actually.
11857040	11859040	I was going to tweet it out
11859040	11861040	and it was a picture of a woman
11861040	11863040	putting her hands in
11863040	11865040	a guy's pants and I was going to tweet out
11865040	11867040	like me at the convention for real.
11867040	11869040	When I see you for real, for real,
11869040	11871040	but I was like, oh god, that's not going to get me in trouble.
11875040	11877040	I am clicking
11877040	11879040	everything that will let me touch it.
11881040	11883040	I kid you not, I am going absolutely not.
11883040	11885040	I think I might have glitched it.
11885040	11887040	I don't know if I should rethought
11887040	11889040	something. I don't think it calibrated
11889040	11891040	right in this instance
11891040	11893040	because I'm
11893040	11895040	absolutely clicking it otherwise
11895040	11897040	and there's nothing hiding behind my head.
11901040	11903040	If you did that, you'd be good.
11903040	11905040	Who's going to get in trouble? Management?
11905040	11907040	What's that? No HR.
11909040	11911040	Right, I'm going to reset
11911040	11913040	because I'm not sure
11913040	11915040	that's working.
11915040	11917040	Oh no, don't make me pass it again.
11919040	11921040	One,
11921040	11923040	two,
11923040	11925040	three, uh uh,
11925040	11927040	four, uh uh, five,
11927040	11929040	six,
11929040	11931040	six,

11985040	11987040	31,
11987040	11989040	32,
11989040	11991040	32 pets.
11991040	11993040	You learned it here first.
11993040	11995040	Sleep.
11999040	12001040	What is that thing? Don't ask for permission.
12001040	12003040	Ask for forgiveness. Real.
12003040	12005040	Real.
12007040	12009040	I maybe get six in a row.
12013040	12015040	Right, what did I do? I spun him over
12015040	12017040	for a little bit.
12017040	12019040	We did the one thing.
12019040	12021040	Okay.
12023040	12025040	Can you go start shaking your booty?
12027040	12029040	Oh, yeah, I bogged out.
12033040	12035040	What happens if they all kiss
12035040	12037040	and love each other?
12037040	12039040	No, they're kissing.
12053040	12055040	Oh,
12059040	12061040	I understand.
12061040	12063040	Sorry.
12063040	12065040	Oh my god, it's fun to
12065040	12067040	with this.
12067040	12069040	You will understand that reference
12069040	12071040	soon.
12083040	12085040	Okay.
12087040	12089040	Is this like a mini version
12089040	12091040	of all the puzzles I just
12091040	12093040	said?
12093040	12095040	I think it is.
12105040	12107040	Nuts and bolts and bolts and
12107040	12109040	nuts.
12109040	12111040	Nuts and nuts and bolts and bolts
12111040	12113040	and nuts.
12117040	12119040	You, you're upside down.
12119040	12121040	You're upside down too.
12133040	12135040	Oh, my brain can't.
12135040	12137040	What?
12137040	12139040	I was driving.
12141040	12143040	Oh,
12145040	12147040	actually.
12147040	12149040	Oh, who's not moving
12149040	12151040	in the rhythm?
12151040	12153040	A bug.
12163040	12165040	Oh, a little lady bird.
12167040	12169040	Well, multiple lady birds.
12171040	12173040	I'll know this fish again.
12173040	12175040	No, I'm not having it.
12175040	12177040	Yeah.
12183040	12185040	There we go.
12185040	12187040	A lady bird, yeah.
12187040	12189040	No, boo.
12189040	12191040	A lady bird.
12191040	12193040	You're pretty-ish?
12193040	12195040	Yeah, they're called lady birds.
12197040	12199040	Oh, my god, we're getting taken away the night.
12199040	12201040	What is it? What are we getting?
12201040	12203040	Oh, I like this one.
12203040	12205040	Oh, sorry.
12205040	12207040	Oh, give me more.
12207040	12209040	Whatever that was.
12209040	12211040	I'll take 19 more.
12211040	12213040	No questions asked.
12215040	12217040	I'll take it back.
12219040	12221040	Okay, there we go.
12221040	12223040	What?
12223040	12225040	Oh, my god.
12227040	12229040	Oh, my god, please.
12229040	12231040	More.
12231040	12233040	A lady bird.
12233040	12235040	A lady bird.
12235040	12237040	A lady bird.
12239040	12241040	A lady bird.
12241040	12243040	Good.
12243040	12245040	No.
12245040	12247040	A bird.
12247040	12249040	Okay.
12249040	12251040	Okay.
12251040	12256040	Oh, it's a sandwich. It's a lunchbox.
12260040	12262040	Get rid of the crumbs. Go away.
12262040	12263040	Oh, the crumbs stay.
12263040	12264040	Oh, the crumbs stay!
12264040	12266040	Put them...
12273040	12276040	Oh, the crumbs would go with the bread.
12282040	12284040	Maybe that makes more sense.
12297040	12299040	Reflings, look away at one.
12300040	12302040	Why is that wrong?
12302040	12304040	Oh, fuck off.
12305040	12307040	You didn't see that.
12307040	12311040	You didn't see it, Reflings. You didn't see it.
12313040	12315040	Is that crongo? Give me that crongo.
12316040	12318040	The bread.
12320040	12322040	The asparagus layman?
12323040	12325040	Misalignment and asparagus number three.
12325040	12328040	You cannot proceed. Do not collect your...
12330040	12331040	Oops, sorry.
12332040	12333040	Don't look!
12335040	12336040	A carrot? What?!
12337040	12338040	I'll get a grip.
12338040	12339040	What? How?
12343040	12344040	What's that?
12345040	12346040	What do you want?
12347040	12348040	What do you want from me?
12349040	12351040	Who are you? Who are they?
12352040	12353040	Okay, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
12353040	12358040	Sorry. Right, cherry, lemon, tomato and asparagus on the bottom.
12359040	12360040	Wait, what?
12361040	12364040	Everything I've done is, like, horrifically wrong.
12367040	12370040	I'm not being trolled. Wait, I'm being trolled.
12377040	12380040	The carrot refuses to go up and down.
12383040	12385040	They're refusing to go up and down.
12385040	12387040	Oh, god.
12388040	12390040	Mm-hmm.
12396040	12397040	Right.
12400040	12401040	Okay.
12401040	12402040	We did it.
12402040	12404040	Sorry, I understood what you meant. I'm jolly.
12404040	12407040	Thank you for your infinite patience for me, however.
12412040	12413040	I love strongy style.
12417040	12418040	Okay.
12430040	12432040	Is that supposed to mess that up at the end there?
12437040	12439040	Wait, the ending doesn't let you do it properly?
12439040	12441040	Oh, putters! Hi, putters!
12442040	12443040	Hi, yeah.
12443040	12444040	Bleep, bleep, bleep!
12447040	12449040	Lost the lid to the upper room.
12452040	12454040	Oh, we need to help you claim, darling. How do I do that?
12457040	12458040	Okay, give me that one.
12458040	12459040	No, get rid of that. Give me that one.
12459040	12461040	Okay. New level.
12463040	12464040	Oh.
12470040	12472040	Okay, please stop.
12473040	12474040	Mm-hmm.
12484040	12486040	Uh-huh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay, mm-hmm.
12486040	12487040	Yes, yes.
12488040	12489040	I'm slaying.
12490040	12491040	I'm slaying, truly.
12494040	12496040	Truly in wholeheart, like, slaying.
12497040	12498040	I need another toe one!
12499040	12501040	Okay, he needs just the wee one now.
12504040	12505040	There you go. Wee!
12506040	12507040	Are you doing it, buddy?
12508040	12509040	You're going for the moon.
12510040	12511040	I don't even know that one.
12511040	12512040	Let's do a toe.
12513040	12514040	Yep. Nope.
12515040	12516040	Yep.
12516040	12517040	Mm-hmm.
12517040	12518040	Wee-yep.
12519040	12520040	Then a little one.
12520040	12521040	Then a little small one.
12522040	12524040	Then an even skinnier, malincier one.
12525040	12526040	Yeah, I'm windy.
12527040	12528040	I'm windy, okay.
12532040	12533040	I don't know why it's jiggling.
12538040	12540040	What, can I only do wee one?
12546040	12547040	Oh, I can't remove it.
12549040	12550040	Don't let me add it.
12550040	12551040	Don't let me add it.
12551040	12553040	I need to, like, fucking label block one.
12555040	12558040	The game's actually making sweat work!
12560040	12561040	Let's go high.
12561040	12563040	It won't let me remove, so...
12564040	12566040	Give me a wee skinny one!
12572040	12574040	It doesn't like that one a lot.
12574040	12575040	But it doesn't want me to remove it.
12575040	12576040	I don't want to remove it.
12577040	12578040	I don't want to remove it.
12578040	12579040	I don't want to remove it.
12579040	12580040	That one a lot.
12580040	12582040	But it doesn't like anything else either.
12582040	12584040	It only is the second wee one.
12590040	12591040	That was rather bizarre.
12591040	12592040	Hydration check.
12595040	12596040	Evil hydrate.
12603040	12604040	Honestly, I'd rather...
12604040	12605040	I'd rather...
12611040	12613040	Because it's not being mean.
12613040	12615040	Like, it's not like it's not cycling through it.
12616040	12618040	No, don't start wobbling again.
12618040	12619040	You're so dramatic.
12631040	12632040	I'm losing a little bit.
12632040	12633040	Just a little bit.
12635040	12637040	I need a wee one.
12638040	12639040	A wee short one.
12639040	12640040	There's a wee short one.
12640040	12641040	Aye, two wee short ones, I'll do that.
12642040	12643040	And then, like, the...
12643040	12644040	These wee medium ones.
12647040	12648040	Nope.
12648040	12649040	Yep.
12649040	12650040	Yep.
12651040	12652040	Nope.
12652040	12653040	Yep.
12653040	12654040	Yep.
12654040	12656040	No, then it'll lean into a piece of me.
12656040	12657040	That's correct.
12660040	12662040	I'm not sure what the requirements are.
12662040	12664040	Is it, like, the colour scheme thing?
12672040	12673040	Is it too high?
12673040	12674040	It has the colour match?
12674040	12675040	Don't see such things.
12680040	12681040	What is that?
12681040	12683040	Oh, it does have the colour match!
12686040	12687040	Why would you do such a thing?
12688040	12691040	Am I supposed to just wait for yellow only then?
12693040	12695040	Oh, my God, you're so right, is...
12698040	12700040	And then I need a skinny red one.
12700040	12701040	No, like a wee one.
12701040	12702040	Yeah!
12702040	12703040	Oh, close enough.
12703040	12704040	Kind of.
12706040	12707040	Right, I need a wee wee wee.
12707040	12708040	A wee wee red one.
12710040	12712040	To say red in French, you say...
12714040	12716040	You say pink in French, you say...
12718040	12720040	What colour is this thing called?
12720040	12722040	I can't believe I didn't figure that out.
12723040	12726040	So you're telling me I was just getting lucky this entire time?
12726040	12727040	I believe it.
12733040	12735040	I just need a long one.
12735040	12737040	I need a long one and then I can put a wee one on it.
12737040	12738040	Long!
12738040	12739040	Or two mediums.
12740040	12741040	I'll take it.
12741040	12742040	Beak.
12745040	12746040	Beak.
12746040	12747040	Play, dee-play.
12750040	12751040	What do we do?
12751040	12752040	Grey?
12752040	12754040	You've given me grey, so why not?
12754040	12755040	I don't know, it's too big.
12759040	12762040	Complete the timer by using every available spot.
12765040	12766040	Done?
12767040	12770040	Where there's the cat under the tree.
12770040	12775040	Under the moon and he's fleeing with it like it's yarn.
12776040	12779040	Then the cat is over the moon
12780040	12782040	and he's purring in the moon.
12784040	12786040	Thank you for listening to my song about the cat.
12788040	12789040	Now knock it over.
12789040	12791040	Honestly, cat behaviour.
12795040	12797040	What an interesting game.
12798040	12800040	Cat is ascending in the air.
12808040	12809040	Wah, a cozy completion.
12809040	12811040	Complete the campaign mode.
12811040	12814040	That was actually so surprisingly nice.
12815040	12817040	Oh well, I get to be the cat now.
12818040	12820040	Oh my god, Anne McMillan.
12820040	12822040	How could we have done that without you?
12822040	12825040	Lucas, don't forget we didn't have you near about you as well.
12826040	12828040	We're messing it all up.
12830040	12833040	What, I honestly thought...
12834040	12836040	I'm gonna say something really mean.
12836040	12839040	I thought that was gonna be rubbish.
12839040	12840040	But it was, Ney.
12840040	12842040	It was actually really good.
12842040	12844040	So is VV right or wrong?
12845040	12847040	Controversial take?
12849040	12852040	Is that Australian VTuber was wrong?
12853040	12855040	I thought that was gonna be rubbish.
12856040	12858040	But I really enjoyed that.
12859040	12861040	I don't know, what do you think?
12862040	12863040	Have you played it?
12863040	12866040	And if you haven't played it, did you...
12866040	12868040	Did I make you want to give it a shot?
12868040	12870040	It's like one of those games where you can tune out to this.
12871040	12873040	Other than the fridge one.
12873040	12875040	Sorry, I'm writing a review on the fridge one.
12875040	12876040	I don't care.
12876040	12877040	That fridge one makes no sense.
12877040	12879040	They need to make it more obvious.
12879040	12880040	I said what I said.
12881040	12883040	VV, actually VV was wrong.
12883040	12884040	Congrats.
12884040	12885040	We're gonna have to tune back.
12885040	12886040	No.
12886040	12889040	Might not stand up to many people.
12889040	12890040	No, you can replay it.
12890040	12891040	No.
12891040	12893040	A good start to a game.
12893040	12894040	Definitely.
12894040	12898040	I think that's definitely for more casual VTubers
12898040	12903040	that don't necessarily need something hyper intense.
12903040	12907040	They just want to have a nice chat and enjoy the experience.
12907040	12911040	I'd say that was pretty dang bandabi-dosey, honestly.
12911040	12913040	Never forget to paint the tools.
12913040	12920040	Now, I will say, I suspect VV never actually checked the hints.
12920040	12923040	VV and strongy drama confront?
12923040	12924040	No.
12924040	12928040	I'm gonna guess she purposely did it where she didn't look at the hints.
12928040	12932040	Because I looked at the hints, obviously I was like, well, I know what to do.
12933040	12936040	It was actually mostly fun because you played it.
12936040	12937040	Love the kit.
12940040	12944040	I was just so worried when I'm like, oh no, it may be a boring game.
12944040	12946040	These things might not find me.
12946040	12950040	VV actively avoided the hints function because she's a completionist.
12950040	12951040	Ah yes, okay.
12951040	12956040	I suspected that because with the hints then you can make it work.
12957040	12961040	You could do it in the future to get the solutions you want.
12963040	12964040	Do you want to play more puzzle games?
12964040	12966040	You could try the Talos principle.
12966040	12967040	I found it tough.
12967040	12968040	Oh, I'm very dumb.
12971040	12972040	It's super fun.
12972040	12975040	The alternative solutions on some of these are wild.
12975040	12978040	The game works pretty well if you can borrow brain cells.
12978040	12980040	Literally, thank you for carrying me.
12980040	12982040	Thank you so much for stream sniping.
12982040	12983040	Oh no, it's not called stream sniping.
12983040	12985040	It's called backseat gaming.
12985040	12987040	I love backseat gaming.
12987040	12989040	Ah, please do it more to me.
12989040	12990040	Sorry, I'm stretching when I did that.
12990040	12991040	So I got really late there.
12991040	12993040	Sorry if I scared anyone.
12993040	12994040	I did a stretch.
12994040	12995040	I switched.
12995040	12997040	I did big switch.
12997040	12999040	Oh, nowhere.
13003040	13006040	Are these all the creator's pets?
13006040	13007040	I'm going to agree.
13007040	13009040	That's so wholesome.
13012040	13013040	I love it.
13013040	13014040	I love it.
13014040	13017040	Honestly, I'm going to say something controversial.
13017040	13019040	10 out of 10.
13020040	13022040	10 out of 10.
13023040	13025040	Sorry, it was.
13025040	13027040	That was such a good experience.
13029040	13034040	You've got a cute little lane where the cat is winding you up through the whole thing.
13034040	13037040	Controversial, but 10 out of 10.
13037040	13040040	Literally, I didn't expect that.
13040040	13042040	Have you ever played Catherine?
13042040	13044040	No, but I'm aware of it.
13044040	13048040	And I know it's a puzzle game and there's no chance I'm going to win without dying.
13048040	13053040	So I would get too frustrated and start screaming at the game and then close it.
13054040	13056040	I think you're guessing a bit too much.
13056040	13058040	You didn't like that.
13058040	13068040	Maybe you guys made it really enjoyable for me, but I found that rather pleasant gaming experience.
13068040	13072040	Now, there's not many games that you can describe as pleasant.
13072040	13077040	And this, I would say, was such a pleasant environment.
13077040	13086040	The music, the little plot of her little pudders, annoying as, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed that.
13086040	13094040	Maybe you made it more enjoyable than I originally would rate it if I was just on my own some lonesome, but that was, I enjoyed that.
13094040	13097040	I don't think it was bad, but it's not 10 out of 10.
13097040	13104040	When you think of a game, you have to remove what you want to see in a game.
13104040	13110040	Because I would ask you, if you don't rate it at 10 out of 10, what would you do to improve it?
13110040	13118040	And you have to be careful with that question, because if what you're going to do to improve it would completely change up what the core purpose of the game is,
13118040	13123040	which is kind of relaxing, kind of puzzler environment.
13123040	13127040	And it's not really environment, because you're not really 3D, are you?
13127040	13132040	Like, did the development team achieve what they wanted to achieve with this game?
13132040	13136040	I would say, yes, they hit the nail on the head, it's a 10 out of 10.
13136040	13138040	You're relaxed, you're playing puzzles.
13138040	13143040	Yeah, it gets a bit frustrating, but they've literally got the hints ready right for you to be like, hey, we've got this.
13143040	13146040	Now, yeah, we ran into like, I think, what, two unpolished bugs?
13146040	13148040	Rather than that.
13148040	13149040	Who's this?
13149040	13151040	It was pleasant to what you played.
13151040	13153040	Johnny, it's a 10 out of 10.
13153040	13156040	Yeah, also me with Edith Finch.
13156040	13158040	Yeah, 8 out of 10, yeah.
13158040	13160040	Yeah, that's terrible.
13160040	13162040	I have a rubbish rating system, okay?
13162040	13165040	Well, you did already criticise the fridge puzzle.
13165040	13168040	Yes, now, whether or not that's a...
13168040	13175040	I'm going to, like, if I look it up and everyone agrees that the fridge puzzle needs a bit of alteration, then sure.
13176040	13178040	It depends how you rate games.
13178040	13182040	Well, you can't go, you can't rate a game objectively.
13182040	13187040	Right, this sounds really sad, but I want to rate video games in the future, and like, I did my research...
13187040	13190040	I did my research, I'll shut the fuck up, Johnny.
13190040	13198040	I researched it into it, and like, you have to remove your bias, because if you were to compare this game to Call of Duty,
13198040	13201040	yeah, of course it's a resident sleeper game.
13201040	13205040	You have to judge the game based on what the game is giving you.
13205040	13211040	You have to remove your bias as well, because my preference is, like, you know, something exciting,
13211040	13214040	but I don't want to get stalled in the progress type thing.
13214040	13220040	But I need to read... I need to remove my bias in a game type. Does that make sense?
13220040	13222040	Makes sense?
13222040	13224040	We need an expert game journal.
13224040	13229040	I'm going to attempt to do a review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,
13229040	13233040	and then a review on Isaac as my Donathon Rewards.
13233040	13239040	Now, in before, they're just absolutely catastrophic failures, but I want to give it a chance.
13248040	13251040	You need to compare it to other puzzlers in the genre.
13251040	13257040	Stick to the genre. You need to kind of, like, be able to identify what the dev team we're going for,
13257040	13261040	did they achieve it, you know, all these kind of things.
13261040	13264040	Finally, yapping is back. Stop!
13264040	13268040	Catastrophic. I've always wanted to be a game critic, but that's how I review games.
13268040	13272040	Yes. Attempting to have an objective eye is a good instinct, but impossible.
13272040	13274040	Hold those both in your head and you'll be fine.
13274040	13276040	Yes, so like, obviously, I'll be biased.
13276040	13279040	I'll be like, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 10 out of 10, best game of all time.
13279040	13287040	I've missed out if you have not played it. The graphic, you know, does the game live up to a dated, you know, time period and all that?
13287040	13292040	Actually, yes. But then again, I have a personal bias, and when I review the game, I'll say that I have an insane personal bias
13292040	13295040	because it also has a nostalgic factor for me.
13295040	13301040	Nostalgia is a billion dollar industry.
13301040	13305040	Billion dollar for nostalgia, okay?
13305040	13310040	The emotional nostalgia cannot be artificially recreated.
13310040	13318040	You must have experienced it at a younger age to create the pathways in your brain of familiarity.
13318040	13321040	You didn't know your brain adores familiarity.
13321040	13331040	It is not like going out of its way to learn new things because that takes effort, that takes brain power, that takes, you know, motivation to learn, take things.
13331040	13338040	That is why nostalgia is an insane drug that cannot be created in a lab.
13338040	13344040	I could go on a big massive rant about how powerful the nostalgia is.
13344040	13347040	You know, for example, you see this meme in passing.
13347040	13355040	When you get, like, a whiff of your childhood and, like, you walk past somewhere and you can, like, smell your childhood and you get, like, flashed back
13355040	13360040	and you never get the flash again because you don't know what the smell was type thing, okay?
13360040	13362040	You know what I mean?
13362040	13365040	Honest life, yeah.
13365040	13369040	But that's my teaching about it.
13369040	13373040	Nostalgia in the next teaching stream?
13373040	13377040	Uh, yeah, I wouldn't mind doing that at all.
13377040	13380040	I think I may stop the teaching stream just a little bit though.
13380040	13381040	Just a little bit.
13381040	13383040	But that's okay.
13383040	13385040	You usually want to stream or play this.
13385040	13389040	I check it out to see their experience with it, but they eventually have it in the background.
13389040	13391040	One of the camera streams for this.
13391040	13393040	I'd be more interested and curious.
13393040	13397040	I was only camp because I knew you guys would carry me through the game.
13397040	13402040	You guys would tell me smell and memory near the place of the rain.
13402040	13404040	Are you listening to an old song?
13404040	13405040	The teaching was fun.
13405040	13408040	Literally first day that's joining in goes for four hours.
13408040	13411040	Star has already been four hours.
13411040	13415040	I won't, no, I'll ramble for a bit, but I can't.
13415040	13417040	Is Emmy coming on?
13418040	13420040	We can maybe redirect into Emmy.
13420040	13421040	When does Emmy come on?
13421040	13424040	Sorry, the background music's gonna dissipate.
13424040	13429040	Oh, Emmy, are you coming on to this, darling?
13429040	13431040	Are you coming?
13431040	13432040	Are you coming?
13432040	13433040	Sorry.
13433040	13434040	Shut the fuck up.
13434040	13435040	I'm so excited.
13435040	13436040	Sorry.
13436040	13439040	I'm so excited to just be back doing long streams again.
13439040	13440040	I'm sorry.
13440040	13442040	That was wildly inappropriate.
13442040	13443040	Oh, stop.
13443040	13444040	I'm getting excited.
13444040	13449040	I've literally just played a puzzle game and I'm like, oh, not today.
13449040	13452040	Okay, I'm on my own some lonesome today.
13452040	13455040	Well, we can just be in San Juman.
13455040	13456040	I'm so so so.
13456040	13458040	Stonny's energy is coming back.
13458040	13459040	That's it.
13459040	13460040	Any more energy?
13463040	13467040	Oh, my YouTube short about how much does a small agency make?
13467040	13469040	It got one out of ten.
13469040	13471040	Oh my God.
13471040	13473040	And you guys are liking it.
13473040	13474040	Hold on.
13474040	13477040	Oh, I'm accidentally recording my screen eat.
13477040	13479040	I hate when my PC does that.
13479040	13480040	I try.
13480040	13484040	I do a screenshot and then it's like screen recording everything.
13484040	13487040	And I'm like, bro, can you not?
13492040	13493040	Hold on.
13493040	13494040	See this PC?
13494040	13496040	I'm actually gonna fart in its mouth.
13496040	13498040	This is such a rubbish PC.
13499040	13501040	Oh, that's a bit big.
13501040	13502040	You know what else is big?
13502040	13503040	Mal willy.
13503040	13504040	Sorry.
13504040	13506040	I'm so excited to be able to do longer streams again.
13506040	13509040	And I know I've got shorter streams for tomorrow and the other day.
13509040	13513040	Mercy's streaming at 10 a.m. my time or your time?
13513040	13515040	Because it's 7 a.m. right now.
13515040	13516040	I'm not sure I can yet.
13516040	13517040	Can I really yet?
13517040	13519040	Can I yet for two more hours?
13519040	13521040	Sadly no little sister there.
13521040	13523040	The shortest of one out of ten.
13523040	13524040	Right.
13524040	13525040	Okay.
13525040	13529040	So as you see on the screen, ranking by views, it says one out of ten.
13529040	13535040	That means in my last ten uploads of whatever content, this has ranked the highest in like
13535040	13538040	most generated views in the time span.
13538040	13539040	Okay.
13539040	13540040	So it's a one out of ten.
13540040	13541040	This is a really big thing.
13541040	13542040	Okay.
13542040	13543040	It means, hey, hold on a minute.
13543040	13550040	This is doing really well in comparison to previous uploads type thing.
13550040	13558040	So and then it says, so you see how that green dot is that green arrow on views is up.
13558040	13560040	That means again, I've gained more views.
13560040	13561040	Ten noon.
13561040	13562040	Noon.
13562040	13564040	I can't ramble for three hours.
13564040	13567040	I need to save my voice because I'm recording pregnancy.
13567040	13571040	It's so hard tonight and all my collabs are missed out on.
13571040	13573040	So I can.
13573040	13574040	But yeah.
13574040	13582040	Well, number go up.
13582040	13585040	I don't know about the Willy but the cake is massive.
13585040	13586040	Okay.
13586040	13600040	But yeah, it did well.
13600040	13602040	Thank you for everyone who interacted with that short.
13602040	13610040	I'm just checking the comments and someone's like, how much does your agency take?
13610040	13615040	How much does the agency take from me?
13615040	13623040	And even if I was a talent, it's 80, 20 and next year goes to 85, 15.
13623040	13627040	So the company see this.
13627040	13630040	The company see this.
13630040	13633040	It's so hyper.
13633040	13634040	Sorry.
13634040	13636040	I'm sure you're sick of me.
13636040	13638040	I'll put my background music on.
13638040	13639040	But yeah.
13639040	13640040	Thank you everyone who interacted with that short.
13640040	13643040	You're super kill and awesome.
13643040	13647040	And thank you for looking into my finances for me.
13647040	13651040	Thank you for looking into the gen two finances.
13651040	13652040	What?
13652040	13653040	Who said that?
13653040	13654040	What?
13654040	13660040	No, but really 12 cases massive for the first month for a beginning agency.
13660040	13661040	Yeah.
13661040	13666040	I am very lucky.
13666040	13668040	Just like how everything worked out.
13668040	13672040	Like obviously when I was brewing the girls in my womb, I was like, oh my God.
13672040	13673040	Am I making a mistake?
13673040	13675040	Like is this insane?
13675040	13676040	No motherfucker.
13676040	13678040	This ain't insane.
13678040	13681040	This is my calling motherfucker.
13681040	13682040	I have daughters.
13682040	13686040	I get to support and they get to achieve their dreams of being content creators.
13686040	13688040	This is my calling in life.
13688040	13693040	Just give me what should we do karaoke?
13693040	13695040	I'm being so for real right now.
13695040	13698040	Should we do pop up karaoke?
13698040	13701040	Hold on.
13701040	13702040	Hold on.
13702040	13705040	We could essentially do pop up karaoke for like two hours.
13705040	13707040	And then we can redirect into mercy.
13707040	13709040	I think we could.
13709040	13711040	I think we could.
13711040	13712040	Oh.
13712040	13713040	Oh no.
13713040	13715040	I have to save my voice.
13715040	13716040	No.
13716040	13717040	I forgot.
13717040	13719040	I need to do ASMR.
13719040	13720040	No.
13720040	13722040	I need to record ASMR.
13722040	13723040	Okay.
13723040	13724040	Wait.
13724040	13725040	Wait.
13725040	13727040	We'll do another pop up in another day.
13727040	13728040	I need to do ASMR.
13728040	13729040	I forgot.
13729040	13733040	I have so many people waiting for me to record ASMR to upload my collapse.
13733040	13734040	I'm so sorry.
13734040	13735040	I can't sing.
13735040	13737040	I'm so sorry to get excited.
13737040	13738040	Get you excited.
13738040	13739040	I'm done.
13739040	13740040	Please forgive me.
13740040	13741040	Right.
13741040	13744040	Let me open up my marshmallow.
13744040	13750040	Don't you have that kind of stream layer in the week?
13750040	13751040	Yeah.
13751040	13753040	But I like doing lots of streams.
13753040	13754040	I'm never offline.
13754040	13755040	That's right.
13755040	13757040	That's why I make the big bucks.
13757040	13759040	Because I'm never offline.
13759040	13760040	Wow.
13760040	13769040	If you want to save money for the girls, you could link your accounts together with the
13769040	13770040	Steam Family feature.
13770040	13771040	Yes.
13771040	13774040	The girls have full permission to do that with their previous accounts.
13774040	13778040	And they get to keep their Steam accounts at the end of their...
13778040	13780040	I don't know when they want to depart.
13780040	13781040	I don't keep it.
13781040	13782040	That's their money.
13782040	13786040	I absolutely do not touch any of that because they spent their money on it.
13786040	13787040	So they own it.
13787040	13788040	Crazy.
13788040	13789040	Hi, Duan.
13789040	13790040	Hi, Leiflin.
13790040	13795040	I watched some of you a little to the left stream.
13795040	13796040	What do you...
13796040	13803040	And I may have misheard you, but it sounded like you're not doing too well.
13803040	13804040	Oh, no.
13804040	13805040	Sorry.
13805040	13807040	My dad has gone home.
13807040	13809040	When I said I'm depressive, espresso.
13809040	13811040	What I meant is my dad's gone home.
13811040	13815040	So I'm sad, but I'm happy because I get to hang out with you.
13815040	13817040	You know, it cancels out the sadness.
13817040	13821040	As soon as I click end broadcast, it's fucking over for me.
13821040	13822040	That's all I'm saying.
13822040	13823040	I'm going to go cry in the bath.
13823040	13824040	I'm not even kidding.
13824040	13825040	I'm going to go cry in the bath.
13825040	13830040	I'm going to fully shave because I'm so fucking hairy.
13830040	13831040	Anonymous, Johnny.
13831040	13833040	Get us worked up then leaving us hanging.
13833040	13834040	That's cruel.
13834040	13835040	I'm so sorry.
13835040	13836040	I didn't mean it, Leiflin.
13836040	13839040	I got distracted.
13839040	13842040	My dad went home, so I'm sad.
13843040	13846040	Yeah, crying will record in the ASMR.
13846040	13850040	Honestly, though, we could always have Twitter spaces.
13850040	13853040	I'm going to say something so controversial.
13853040	13854040	I don't like Twitter.
13854040	13858040	I like putting my projects on Twitter being like, hey, I'm recording pregnancy ASMR.
13858040	13859040	Here's a picture.
13859040	13861040	Hey, I'm doing this with someone here.
13861040	13862040	Here's a picture.
13862040	13871040	I don't actually like the concept of Twitter and being like, hi, I'm in the bath, shaving
13871040	13873040	my hairy minge.
13873040	13875040	What am I supposed to tweet?
13875040	13877040	I don't get it.
13877040	13880040	In another life, I was basically forced to tweet every day and I was like, oh, I don't
13880040	13881040	like it.
13881040	13882040	I don't like it.
13882040	13883040	Please quit me right now.
13883040	13884040	You know?
13884040	13885040	Be happy.
13885040	13886040	Be happy.
13886040	13887040	Be happy.
13887040	13888040	Thank you, Kairon.
13888040	13889040	It's like TMI.
13889040	13891040	It's just no for me.
13891040	13892040	Oh my gosh.
13892040	13898040	Is that the Fibonacci sequence card from the hit video game, Baltro?
13898040	13902040	Thank you for the five gifted memberships math, 16, 18.
13902040	13906040	And congrats to those who caught it without this.
13906040	13907040	No, don't shave.
13907040	13908040	No, don't shave.
13908040	13911040	You're so pretty.
13911040	13917040	You're so pretty when I can't see the forest for the trees.
13917040	13919040	Twitter spaces are great.
13919040	13921040	The brain world is already here.
13921040	13923040	It's back, baby.
13923040	13927040	Hydration chip.
13927040	13928040	Okay.
13928040	13930040	I'll finish reading that, Maro.
13930040	13931040	But I'm sorry.
13931040	13932040	No, don't worry.
13932040	13933040	I promise.
13933040	13935040	Hopefully you know all the reeflings here about you and wish nothing but the best.
13935040	13937040	Yes, I'm so sorry to confuse you, reefling.
13937040	13938040	Please don't worry about me.
13938040	13942040	When I said I'm upset, it's because my dad's gone home.
13942040	13943040	And I love my dad very much.
13943040	13944040	And he's a hoot and a holler.
13944040	13946040	And it's very nice to have him around.
13946040	13952040	But the next time I'll see him is probably in like two years time, which was a bit rough.
13952040	13954040	It was like, ah, shit.
13954040	13956040	That's a rough name.
13956040	13964040	He said he doesn't think he can come on the plane next year to come see me, to come visit me.
13964040	13967040	And now he would come visit me if I asked.
13967040	13977040	If I said quit your fucking job right now and come over for like three months, then he would 100% do it.
13977040	13978040	So please don't worry.
13978040	13979040	It's not like that.
13979040	13983040	It's just it's most likely two years.
13983040	13987040	Like I showed my dad everything, like what I do work wise on that.
13987040	13989040	And he said hi to AC.
13989040	13992040	I don't know if I said it in the other stream, but don't worry if you weren't there.
13992040	13993040	He said hi to AC.
13993040	13994040	I was invoiced that way.
13994040	13996040	He could through just hanging out.
13996040	13999040	And I was like, oh, I was like, oh, dad, dad, dad, dad.
13999040	14000040	This is AC.
14000040	14001040	Say Privyat.
14001040	14002040	And he was like, what?
14002040	14004040	I was like, yeah, Privyat.
14004040	14005040	It means hello in Russian.
14005040	14006040	Go Privyat.
14006040	14008040	And he was like, Privyat.
14008040	14010040	And AC couldn't hear it sadly.
14010040	14012040	But we were having a goof over.
14012040	14013040	I was showing him my work.
14013040	14016040	I was like, so this is what I do for the girls and all of that.
14016040	14018040	And he was like 20%.
14018040	14020040	And I'm like, yep, 20%.
14020040	14021040	I don't want to be greed.
14021040	14022040	I'm anti-greed.
14022040	14024040	And he's like, yep, yep.
14024040	14025040	That sounds right.
14025040	14027040	That sounds about you, Johnny.
14027040	14029040	Did AC call him dad?
14029040	14030040	Don't.
14030040	14031040	No.
14031040	14032040	Don't.
14032040	14033040	Don't.
14033040	14034040	You're done.
14034040	14035040	You're done.
14035040	14037040	I'm farting on your eyelashes.
14037040	14039040	Open up your eyeballs right now.
14039040	14041040	Don't ever say that again.
14041040	14043040	Hi, Johnny.
14043040	14045040	Serious answer here.
14045040	14046040	OK.
14046040	14047040	Emmy and Laura is ginger.
14047040	14049040	But in her VTuber model, it's definitely more blonde.
14049040	14051040	And tell her she's ed in.
14051040	14053040	She is ed in her model, actually.
14053040	14055040	She is alternate in...
14055040	14057040	Emmy is so fantastic to work with.
14057040	14058040	Oh my God.
14058040	14060040	We like came to an agreement.
14060040	14062040	She's like, I think you guys have seen it.
14062040	14064040	So I'm allowed to talk about it.
14064040	14066040	And if she doesn't want me to talk about it.
14066040	14067040	Sorry, Emmy.
14067040	14068040	I love you.
14068040	14071040	I'll pay you 50 bucks to not be mad at me.
14071040	14073040	Emmy...
14073040	14076040	So Emmy's designed her 2.0.
14076040	14078040	But I had to say to her.
14078040	14080040	I love your 2.0.
14080040	14084040	But you need to let Emmy 1.0 be a thing for a little bit longer.
14084040	14088040	So we came to an agreement that she's going to get fixed up a little bit
14088040	14090040	to Emmy's image, which I'm 100% OK with.
14090040	14093040	Like, as I said, I want the girls to be happy with who they are.
14093040	14096040	Because at the end of the day, they've been given models, OK?
14096040	14098040	Like, Shebe, she's already told you.
14098040	14103040	Shebe's getting a more reflective version of herself on a model.
14103040	14105040	That's coming out soon to you.
14105040	14106040	I don't know when.
14106040	14107040	Nari's cooking.
14107040	14109040	Nari's cooking very hard right now.
14109040	14112040	She's a very busy modeler.
14112040	14115040	So please do have patience, but yes.
14115040	14117040	It's a 1.5 model.
14117040	14118040	She showed it on stream.
14118040	14120040	Yes, as I said, I'm Emmy, not Emily.
14120040	14122040	Did I say Emily?
14123040	14125040	Wait, why are you guys saying Emily?
14125040	14127040	Did I say Emily?
14127040	14128040	I did.
14128040	14132040	It must have started because in a mashed words together, you didn't.
14132040	14134040	OK, Emmy, Emmy, Emmy.
14134040	14137040	Emmy, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah, Emmy, yeah.
14137040	14138040	Drank.
14138040	14139040	Swalalala.
14139040	14140040	Drank.
14140040	14141040	Swalalala.
14141040	14145040	But yes, as I said, I'm happy for the girls to, you know,
14145040	14148040	change things up and look the way they want.
14148040	14153040	But I do need her to still be very close to the original design,
14153040	14155040	and she was so good to work with.
14155040	14159040	Like I was passing on messages from the concept artists to each other
14159040	14162040	and being like, OK, you can do this, but don't do this,
14162040	14165040	because you need this and don't do that, because you need that.
14165040	14167040	And she was so good.
14167040	14170040	She was also so good to work on, so 10 out of 10.
14170040	14172040	Work with, sorry, on an objective.
14172040	14174040	On an objective.
14174040	14177040	And he looked, fuck, I'm dying.
14177040	14179040	Sorry, I just choked on my spit.
14179040	14183040	I'm trying to like talk and breathe and like swallow my spit at the same time,
14183040	14187040	because I'm so excited to get the next question out, OK?
14187040	14189040	He found a good bunch of daughters.
14189040	14191040	Bro, they found me.
14191040	14194040	I don't know how on earth they were crazy enough to go for it.
14194040	14196040	Bro, crazy.
14196040	14197040	But they did it.
14197040	14198040	And here we are.
14198040	14199040	I mean, fuck, here we are.
14199040	14203040	We're almost at like all of us are 10,000T subs.
14203040	14206040	I'm so excited to release that motherfucking artwork.
14206040	14207040	Oh, my God.
14207040	14209040	Oh, my God, AC is almost 8K.
14209040	14212040	Oh, my God, I'm humping to death.
14212040	14213040	Hmm.
14213040	14214040	Wow.
14214040	14219040	And AC and Emmy have a collab coming out soon on AC's channel.
14219040	14224040	Sometimes when you get me bricked off, it doesn't go down for an hour.
14224040	14228040	Oh, no, four hours is dangerous.
14228040	14230040	Are you based on strong heim?
14230040	14231040	Strongest strong heim.
14231040	14232040	Sounds a bit familiar.
14232040	14239040	Oh, I am based after strontium, which is my dad's gamer tag, not the actual gamer tag
14239040	14242040	before you look up and be like, I find her dad relax.
14242040	14244040	It's not the actual gamer tag.
14244040	14252040	But unbelievably, actually, so we are debuts got clipped on this channel called smoothie
14252040	14258040	and someone replied under my comment and they were like, are you after strontium dog?
14258040	14262040	So this is the even more hidden lore behind my name.
14262040	14266040	So strontium dog is a comic my dad used to read.
14266040	14270040	And then he made his gamer tag like strontium.
14270040	14272040	It's not exactly strontium, so relax.
14272040	14274040	And then I called myself strontium.
14274040	14278040	And someone commented under and said, are you after strontium dog?
14278040	14281040	And I'm like, yes, what the eff.
14281040	14285040	The fact even you what strontium dog was was insane.
14285040	14288040	It was literally gone full circle.
14288040	14289040	Full circle.
14289040	14290040	Okay.
14290040	14293040	Throw that ass in a full circle.
14293040	14296040	And sorry, I'm super hyper today.
14296040	14298040	I fucking might be so much worse ones.
14298040	14303040	It's so nice to just not feel like stress.
14303040	14304040	Now, I love my dad.
14304040	14305040	Love me dad.
14305040	14306040	Love me refund.
14306040	14307040	Simple.
14307040	14314040	I felt like I was juggling a lot like normally a nap after streaming all of that.
14314040	14317040	And all of that jazz.
14317040	14320040	I'm almost caught up with the Elden Ring streams.
14320040	14322040	They start up in like two weeks again.
14322040	14323040	So I hope you're all Elden.
14323040	14326040	I hope you've got like your Elden Ring barfool.
14326040	14328040	Can't wait for your dad to be announced in gen two.
14328040	14330040	Oh my God.
14330040	14332040	That would be hilarious.
14332040	14335040	Hi guys, strontium here.
14335040	14339040	I would play the clip that I recorded with him, but he said my legal name in it.
14339040	14342040	I was like, I was like, I would just record in it so you can see what you want.
14342040	14344040	So instantly goes legal name.
14344040	14349040	And I'm like, okay, well, I'll need to edit that before I send it on to the editors.
14349040	14352040	And strontium's dad is going to be the best girl.
14352040	14353040	Oh my God.
14353040	14357040	The only male allowed on stream for real for real.
14357040	14359040	I managed to catch up to Elden Ring so he can help you out.
14359040	14360040	Oh yeah.
14360040	14362040	Go kiss me on your lips.
14362040	14365040	I'm going to help me in the flower field.
14365040	14367040	Sensor the name.
14367040	14368040	Bro, honestly.
14368040	14371040	We need a model for strontium's dad if he ever comes on a stream.
14372040	14377040	So we recorded a short of him guessing VTuber names.
14377040	14384040	And I said to him, if it goes viral, you realize you're going to have to get shipped out again so we can record more.
14390040	14393040	We would make him our Oshi.
14393040	14395040	Strontium.
14395040	14397040	The dad tubers, honestly.
14397040	14398040	No, my immersion.
14398040	14400040	That's my fucking dad.
14400040	14403040	No, don't troll when it comes to that.
14403040	14405040	I know idol culture, no male on stream.
14405040	14407040	But if I'm like, yeah, my dad.
14407040	14409040	That's my dad, okay?
14409040	14413040	Then he started making me get raged.
14413040	14415040	Then he made me enraged.
14415040	14417040	Dad tuber, real.
14417040	14421040	Since you're a cutfish, your dad model needs to be cracking.
14421040	14428040	Well, I'm going to get a doodle of him drawn for the shorts because when he talks, obviously it was just me sitting there staring at the screen.
14428040	14431040	But I need to like, who goes there?
14431040	14435040	I need to cut up the audio and then I need to get an insane amount of assets.
14435040	14437040	The short is going to cost so much money to get.
14437040	14440040	I mean, Strontium's dad is already in my kami Oshi.
14440040	14442040	You have a father.
14442040	14444040	I thought you were a cutfish.
14444040	14446040	Wait, cutfishes don't have dads.
14446040	14449040	Cutfishes don't have dads.
14449040	14452040	Are you getting me to type something into Google that makes no sense?
14453040	14454040	No.
14454040	14456040	First question that comes up.
14456040	14458040	Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?
14458040	14459040	Oh, whoa.
14459040	14461040	Can you keep a cutfish as a pet?
14461040	14462040	No, they're too smart.
14462040	14463040	Don't do it.
14463040	14466040	Wait, does that mean he would get a Patreon as a...
14466040	14467040	Stop!
14467040	14468040	Stop.
14468040	14472040	They definitely do have male progenitors.
14472040	14475040	Some people are that parasocial.
14475040	14480040	I bloody hope not when my fucking dad were...
14480040	14486040	I'm going to start fighting hands with the shadow people again.
14486040	14490040	It's been a day since my dad's gone and I'm already throwing hands with the shadow people.
14490040	14492040	Actually, you know what's really disgusting?
14492040	14496040	I've instantly stopped taking showers every morning and I know that he's gone.
14496040	14498040	Like, absolute minger.
14498040	14500040	Absolute minger.
14500040	14501040	Hi, Strontium.
14501040	14503040	Don't want to make you cry earlier or anything.
14503040	14504040	Don't worry.
14504040	14506040	It's reserved for the bath time.
14506040	14508040	But you're a wonderful goober and we'll never get sick of it.
14508040	14509040	If you're ever sad, we're here for you.
14509040	14510040	If you ever need help, we're here for you.
14510040	14513040	If you're ever raging hard, we're here to get our worded by you.
14513040	14514040	Strontium, love maxing.
14514040	14516040	We fling, love maxing.
14516040	14521040	Get kissed, get kissed, get kissed.
14521040	14526040	I just forced my tongue in your mouth when I go...
14526040	14528040	Honestly, that's terrible.
14528040	14530040	Let's see if that turns out okay.
14530040	14532040	Dude, Papa Cuttle's leave as a message.
14532040	14535040	Yes, he did, but I can't read it or I'm going to burst out crying.
14535040	14539040	I need to give it a few days before I be there.
14539040	14545040	But the TLDR is thanks for looking after my daughter whilst I couldn't.
14545040	14550040	And that's all I'm going to say before I start crying.
14550040	14551040	Hi, Strontium.
14551040	14552040	Hi, Bethling.
14552040	14554040	You and the rest of the girls are really inspiring.
14554040	14558040	Oh, yeah, you're inspired by the autism of your honor.
14558040	14559040	Thank you very much.
14559040	14561040	I wanted to be a content creator too.
14561040	14562040	Oh, yeah.
14562040	14563040	Come aboard.
14563040	14564040	Clam aboard.
14564040	14567040	Oh, no, I doubt I'll ever do an interesting audio.
14567040	14568040	Oh my god.
14568040	14569040	Shock and behavior.
14569040	14570040	I can't believe it.
14570040	14572040	You don't want to moan into the microphone.
14572040	14574040	But I was way too afraid or too busy.
14574040	14576040	But after seeing you guys have so much fun.
14576040	14578040	I want to do it too today.
14578040	14580040	I've been making original songs.
14580040	14583040	Oh my god, you can make the cat songs from...
14583040	14587040	You should play straight and then give the music man these music sheets
14587040	14589040	and then make songs off the top of your head.
14589040	14592040	I find it crazy that Carl Fish is motivating me
14592040	14594040	to get back to what I did this.
14594040	14595040	Thanks for pumping me up.
14595040	14596040	You got to know.
14596040	14597040	Pump it up.
14597040	14599040	We got to pump it up.
14599040	14600040	We got to know.
14600040	14602040	Now let me pump your clam with my ink.
14602040	14603040	Okay.
14603040	14604040	You're done.
14604040	14605040	You're done.
14605040	14606040	You're done, though.
14606040	14607040	Done.
14607040	14609040	Well, if you can write diss tracks, let me know.
14609040	14611040	Because I want the girls to do diss tracks on each other.
14611040	14613040	I think that's the funniest thing ever.
14613040	14614040	Oh, strongy cuddles.
14614040	14616040	More like strongy fumbles the bag.
14616040	14618040	Because what's with that 80-20 cut?
14618040	14621040	You literally are not going to get a yacht at that rate.
14621040	14622040	Whoa.
14624040	14626040	I can go straight, honestly.
14626040	14627040	That's what I need.
14627040	14629040	I so badly want diss tracks.
14629040	14630040	I want to, like, diss track.
14630040	14633040	Be a little bit more, like, feel the whores.
14634040	14635040	Stop.
14635040	14636040	Stop.
14636040	14637040	That's not funny.
14637040	14638040	Stop.
14638040	14639040	Stop.
14639040	14640040	Hi, strongy.
14640040	14641040	Hi, refling.
14641040	14642040	I love you so much.
14642040	14643040	I love you so much.
14643040	14644040	Sorry.
14644040	14645040	I'm getting so excited.
14645040	14646040	I'm at 10.
14646040	14648040	I need to turn it down to a 7.
14648040	14649040	Okay.
14649040	14651040	I need to turn it down to a 7.
14654040	14655040	Hi, strongy.
14655040	14656040	Hi, refling.
14656040	14657040	I don't mind if you don't shit.
14657040	14658040	Replay.
14658040	14660040	Also, don't shower so I can taste you.
14660040	14661040	Replay.
14661040	14664040	Napoleon Bonaparte back from the grave.
14664040	14665040	Jeez.
14665040	14667040	I'll rip your bones apart.
14667040	14668040	Bonaparte.
14668040	14670040	Turn your horse into glue.
14670040	14673040	That is a reference to horses being turned into glue.
14673040	14675040	That is an actual thing.
14675040	14676040	Hi, strongy.
14676040	14677040	Hi, refling.
14677040	14679040	You know, I want you to get comforted.
14679040	14680040	Get comforted.
14680040	14681040	Get comforted.
14681040	14682040	Pop, pop, pop, pop.
14682040	14683040	Comfort, comfort, comfort.
14683040	14686040	Will we ever get a horror game stream?
14686040	14687040	Yeah.
14687040	14690040	Technically, yes.
14690040	14693040	I'm very scared of horror games.
14693040	14696040	I scream in them and I have a heart rate monitor.
14696040	14698040	So, yes.
14698040	14703040	Eventually, it's probably going to be like a Donoth on reward because I get freaked out
14703040	14704040	in video games.
14704040	14709040	I get really good immersion when I play video games where I have tunnel vision and stuff.
14709040	14715040	So, that makes the first person horror games 10 times scarier because I feel like they're
14715040	14718040	going to touch my freaking back.
14718040	14722040	FNAF 1 would absolutely make me shit myself.
14722040	14724040	I'm not even kidding.
14724040	14727040	The chair would be ruined.
14727040	14729040	What was that person thinking?
14729040	14732040	I bet if I melted that horse, I could stick things together.
14732040	14733040	Can I teach you something?
14733040	14739040	They most likely were cooking the horse and then they were like, oh, it went really sticky.
14739040	14740040	That's weird.
14740040	14744040	And then it did it to another horse and then it went sticky and then it went another horse
14744040	14747040	and then it went sticky and then they realized they could make glue from it.
14747040	14749040	It's kind of like the cow drinking thing.
14749040	14754040	People were like, eh, he was the first human to figure out that cows get milk.
14754040	14757040	Motherfucker, you were breastfed.
14757040	14759040	Humans and mammals ain't that different.
14759040	14762040	Well, actually, I'm going to shit your pants right now.
14762040	14764040	Wait, no, I'm not going to shit your pants right now.
14764040	14767040	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
14767040	14768040	Wait, let me restart.
14768040	14770040	Humans are mammals.
14770040	14773040	Babies drink milk from boob.
14773040	14775040	Boob is also on cow.
14775040	14777040	Cow produces milk.
14777040	14781040	It's not some weird thing where a random guy taught cow in a field and went, oh, let me get some of that.
14781040	14783040	No, it was domestication of animals.
14783040	14785040	No, I'm not shitting your pants.
14785040	14786040	I'm sorry.
14786040	14787040	I'm sorry.
14787040	14789040	No, I didn't mean that.
14789040	14790040	Shit your pants.
14790040	14792040	NO!
14792040	14796800	Honestly anonymous ain't no way my Aussie is interested in epic rap battles in history
14796800	14801960	Are you kidding me? I love that stuff, although I definitely haven't watched the newest stuff at all
14803360	14805520	Be gentle in your panty lin
14806200	14812840	What is she cooking something devious clearly? I just want a fresh pair who's gonna clean them your problem not mine. Oh
14815080	14819200	No, hold on I'm about to be proven wrong live on stream
14820360	14822360	I
14824120	14827600	Don't know I'm getting your reference sheets for the girls. Don't show me that
14828280	14834400	Don't show me that right. I'll be fair. I've even sent me the reference sheets of the girls. I'm getting your ones for them
14835760	14841440	If you want to save money, oh, I read that one. Oh my god. I'm out of our club. Hi. I'm new here to all this VTuber stuff
14845560	14849320	All right, I was just making sure you weren't asking anything
14849320	14852720	Okay, but I was hoping you could answer a few questions. I'm sorry if you answered them
14852720	14857160	Oh, yeah, of course. I wondered if there's a place where you will post your karaoke streams
14857960	14862680	I'll be working most likely when you miss it. Oh, I don't host it myself
14864560	14872040	And normally archive annons do it all for me. Thank you archive annons. You are the secret hidden people of the good stuff
14872040	14874040	Thank you. We appreciate you and
14874800	14880240	Yes, hopefully you don't mind if I ask but how would we know if something like cat rocks is broken? Oh
14882200	14886880	You just need to replace dot with the word dot and then I'll do the rest
14887480	14895080	If you want to send it, I'll just say link archive annons are the seventh member of veal or literally they work in over time
14895080	14897080	Their PCs are exploding
14897240	14904040	And fucking there they're they start quaking when Azura has a fucking legal edge and streams
14904040	14907360	They're little their knees are noblin. That's all I'm saying
14907360	14911960	They're noblin and wobbling in their chair when they see you on the schedule that Azura's got legal edge and strings
14912480	14915680	They're like no, my my fucking PC is gonna implode
14916600	14919040	So far you only had one members carry
14921400	14923400	Just a little
14923640	14928080	I'll always be here for you and so will the roof and stop being so wholesome to me. How dare you?
14928880	14930880	Stop being so
14931400	14935320	Hi strongy, you are correct. I'm a is a hundred percent doing ginger. Thank you
14936200	14939160	But you are wrong about Azura her hair is green
14939840	14941840	It's similar to Hatsune Miku
14942560	14949160	You're gonna shit your pants when you learn what color hats and Miku's hair is that's fucking blue. She's bloody blue
14950160	14956800	You say cutfish candy be pits, but what about you? Oh, right? Okay. That was good. That was smooth. Okay. Let's do a let's do a

15642360	15649520	I don't get angry like I don't get angry a person I get angry at like an animate object like video game
15649520	15650720	Does that make sense?

15652920	15659440	Your pout is better and cuddle my little seaweed until she smiles. I don't get angry at people. I don't find it hard
15660280	15663280	Like, I don't know how to get angry at someone
15667000	15669480	Only thing I've worried about with
15671160	15673160	Is getting hair in the teeth
15673920	15678360	No, no, you're not you're not that no we don't we don't do that here
15680200	15683200	We don't do that here you can eat the peach but you're not eating the clam
15683200	15686720	Okay, the clam does not want any attention. Please leave the clam alone
15689440	15695200	I should play League of Legends with Azura if I want to get angry. I don't I can't even comprehend the game
15695200	15698360	I think I've seen gameplay of it three times and I can't comprehend it. I
15699120	15702720	Don't know what I'm doing. It's like an enemy has been slain. Well, yeah
15702720	15709240	I mean doesn't death occur in this game an ally has been slain. Well, yeah, lady like change
15709240	15713820	Well, everyone's supposed to survive no clam attention. They've been a bane another or the beans different
15715480	15718400	The the peril of the clam is different
15719800	15725480	Nobody could comprehend it at the start. I don't make sense Johnny's hair color is yet. I
15729080	15735400	Like my hair. I love the style of it, but I'm a sucker for bunches and symmetrical hair. I'm absolutely suffer for it
15736600	15741360	Do you want to just grab my pony tails from behind my little twin tails?
15741360	15747600	I do technically a twin tail and I like that is double bunches. You can't see it from the front
15747600	15751480	Well, I guess you kind of can I have double bunches behind my
15752560	15759440	Seashells I have a I have a ponytail at the seashells create that bump and then I have them at the bottom of the hair as well
15759440	15762800	So I have double bunches and I love it. I love it
15764120	15766120	Your sucker sure. Hope so
15766720	15768720	Twin tail handlebars. Yeah, I
15770560	15772720	Love it. I love it. I love oh
15773440	15777960	Yeah, no that reminded me something's like oh your character so ugly compared to everyone else. I'm like
15778560	15784000	Nice try me nice try. I'm pure six. You can admit it. It's fine
15786960	15792960	Only thing I'm worried about oh already read that. How do you oh my god? Oh my god, there's no more marshmallow questions, right?
15792960	15794960	I'm going offline good night
15795920	15802240	Anyone else in that? Oh, there's no marshmallow questions. I went offline instantly. How do you know?
15802360	15805200	Yeah, but the cake. Yes, your honor. Probably
15805840	15807840	You see that again. Go rest. I
15808520	15812280	Should rest and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go for a nap, okay?
15812880	15820600	And then I'm gonna go for a bath and then I'm gonna deal with all the backlog of work because the video game has been delayed
15821200	15823200	surprise surprise me who didn't
15823920	15830800	Fucked up, but it's fine. The game's still playable. That's the main thing and still one-handable if you want. Um, I
15832360	15835960	Need to hand over all the audio assets now. Um
15837400	15840560	Which is gonna take a hot second to edit but once it's done
15840560	15842880	It's one of those jobs that like I can tick off the list
15842880	15848660	It's not like a reoccurring job like at the moment the shorts with the girls are like reoccurring jobs and they kill me
15848900	15854180	Um, because like it's not like I can take it off a list or anything
15856100	15859300	Eh, if Mercy doesn't have a room up she's
15862100	15864100	Oh, no, I'm going into rare
15865060	15867060	It's not out yet. No, um
15867540	15872100	When are we getting the official news about the game? Um, the game is free
15872740	15877540	Um free access. It will be uh posted on the alternative twitters
15877540	15881140	It will not be posted from the main account due to the content
15882180	15885140	Like the main VLR account due to the content inside the game
15886180	15887700	Can you post that?
15887700	15889700	Can you post that now you can so
15892580	15894580	I mean, maybe we could
15895220	15900660	Do it announce it, but then link the girls all no no, it's too risky. It's too risky. I'm not risking. I'm not risking it
15901540	15904980	Uh, also the girls are getting access to fansly on august 1st, so
15905060	15907060	Do without what you will
15909220	15914020	I don't know what they're planning, but how about you? What kind of content?
15916740	15918740	One-handed gameplay content
15921540	15925300	So play with headphones. Yeah, definitely
15927300	15929860	Um getting the debit card ready
15930740	15935540	We will be there, but when are you gonna be on it? I need a bit more
15936100	15942660	Time and what I'm gonna purposely do is let the girls go ahead and do what they want to like get as much support for them
15943060	15945060	Because they actually get 100 of their
15945860	15948420	VLR don't take any cut from their bandslay at all
15948820	15953380	Um, so I'd rather they like get success and like more stabilized income if they want to do it
15953380	15956100	But I have requested them like hey remember
15956340	15962740	YouTube's your main income source like don't don't be cut. I said to them and actually you can quote this the girls will quote that
15962740	15966980	I said don't come to me with five bandsly streams on your schedule
15967860	15969860	And they all agreed and they said yeah, that's fine
15970660	15972660	Yeah, hold on. I'm hydrating
15977620	15984260	Don't feel send on bad. Yeah, I said look hey your income sources YouTube like then he didn't mess this up
15986900	15992580	And the price is going to be same completely up to the girl. We do not take any cut from
15994020	15995460	Uh
15995460	16000260	We do not take any cut so we don't dictate the price the girls pick their prices whatever they're happy with
16000980	16006580	And not up to be aware of the agency because it's not stipulated in the contract at all
16006980	16013700	Um, are you winning son? Yeah, we defeated the enemy of the puzzle game, which is actually a really good game recommend
16014020	16021780	Say strong reeflings. Don't give her ideas. The zeroes will play for 40 hours straight. Stop. What if a zero plays the league on that? No
