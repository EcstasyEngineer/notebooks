584
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:39,260

589
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:26,620
right take a sip hey hey wait that wasn't what we wanted wait nothing marked we wanted him to spit

590
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,180
out the tea so he has to drink the whole thing i think

591
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:43,980
no steal his shoes don't have to tell me to it hi oh no i didn't mean to do that i meant steal

593
01:12:51,820 --> 01:13:02,300
oh he didn't like that i like him he's totally like he's tolerating us but he's came to not

01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,340

over here but you know oh did he just boot me because i took us through you don't deserve it

598
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:40,060
maybe use the big bell behind him oh that makes perfect sense actually to do the bell when he goes

599
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:46,060
for a sip can we see him do a sip from that side one of us has to go on the other side i think

600
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:55,340
i think we uh i think we both have to do it or else we can um hello i'm at a kakaya hello

01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:05,020
excuse me madame i need the bell i shoot madame i need the access to the bell you're in my way

602
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:12,220
madame madame please refrain from getting in my way right oh sorry okay that's definitely what

603
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:19,100
you're supposed to do when he sips his tea we just need to hang around while he does his wee tea

604
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:27,580
okay we're getting there we just need our handheld through the game just a tiny bit okay just a

605
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:31,980
tiny bit of hand holding right so we need to wait until the suspiciousness is come back

606
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:38,460
he should he should drink his tea after he's done his like suspicious animation

607
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:49,340
oh wait i'm trapped i'm trapped we're good i didn't this game is a lot harder than i thought i thought

608
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:55,900
this was like a i say this about every game i play oh i thought this was a child's game why is it hard

609
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,060
and i don't know if that's just a reflection on me but he's still

610
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,380
no the bell thing needs to be set up again she's not fixing it

611
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:12,860
oh no you're right oh sugar what is she trying to fix right now oh well okay um she's currently

612
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:21,580
painting take the bow i didn't know i can take her paint and brush oh i can draw her paint and

613
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:28,380
brush one or the other good night starting about wake up in four hours bro you're gonna be charred

614
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:37,420
um no was that supposed to take the paint brush oh she's gonna fix the bell okay

615
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,700
and then do you want to put the duck in the other garden i wonder if that's what it is

616
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,100
you put the statue in the other garden so then she forgets she even had a duck

617
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:59,980
no i must tell you okay there we go okay it's now out of bounds so she can't ask for the duck

618
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:10,860
anymore it doesn't work like that and now we wait for him to drink his dang tea that must be frozen

619
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:21,180
solid at this stage because there's no way please ask for tea are you coming in this garden

620
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,420
your audio might be cutting it for me on discord a little bit

621
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:32,620
oh sorry no that was all good the knee buddy so she knows it's fake right

622
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,820

623
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:45,900
so she's fixing that wait can i put the bow on you now because we got rid of the statue

627
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:16,780
everything can be done solo you mean we could be doing this twice as fast but taking us three

01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:29,420
No, do you know how long it takes to make roses? It's like a very hard job to have them grow successfully

724

It takes so long right okay, I'll see worry. Oh, we got the car. We got the problem. Is he crying? He said my rose

737
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,060
We actually don't have an objective so we're not there yet

738
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,100
This is the wrong way

739
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,100

But we're allowed to move on

776
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:28,620
How do we make you accidentally went back to the beginning of the game wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map

777
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:35,780
Hold on Ray. Let's go the wrong way. Let's try the other only we would manage that honestly

778
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,220
Again, try that again. We'll go up

779
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:44,300
I'll blame the French this time. Let's see. Je ne comprends

780
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,860
Where the fuck we is?

781
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,180
Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?

782
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,980
No, maybe

783
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,060
I'm

784
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,060
Swimming up the water

785
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,500
To say water and French you say

786
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:07,340
Why is the French why is water male in French I do not know no

01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,060
Yeah, exactly. That's how I like

790
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,580
We're casually just flirting

791
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:29,540
I say, oh, I remember like seeing like complaints like on feature group collabs

792
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:32,620
I was just turned into them being nice to each other while you're surprised

793
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,900
Wait, we're surprised that we're nice. You ask you want me to be mean. Yeah, like literally would you thank you Scott?

794

795
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,100
so we weren't supposed to go here or

796
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,980
What's the deal? I'm a drama

797
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:58,580
This was the way to go because we opened a gate to get here and there was a new camera angle

798
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,900
Well, I guess we'll move this way now

799
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:06,300
Moving on up. Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back. I guess a

800
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:14,260
Bit a bowl of water. Okay. Well considering. Yeah, there's literally an arrow. That's like you're actually meant to go this way

801
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:19,140
Dumb a oh hey a car. Let's trap someone in it

802
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:24,140
So, this is how mercy lured her first victim

805
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,900

Toy boat. How do you say toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat a boat?

812
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,140
Bit of a toy boat moment

813
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,700
little tongue twister like when you say like

814
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:33,300
10 soldier or something and then you're supposed to say it like 10 times faster 10 soldier

815
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,260
I've never had 10 soldier 10 soldier send 10 so oh

817
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:48,820

820
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:00,260
We're tear we terrorizing them. Oh

821
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:04,700
I can't this camera angle is so unforgiven. You know that

822
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:08,180
It really is I keep getting pushed away juice

823
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:14,820
Do we need to jump in the van and like wait, we need to jump in the box, maybe oh

824
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:20,940
You're right. Wait, there should be another box in the van. Let's go into your secret kidnap van. How do we

825
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,140
We get in though

826
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,980
How do you can it? Okay, we come in oh

827
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,420

01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:39,100
It's only one it it's only one at a rate you go you go in before me. I'll be fine you go on without me

829
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,900
Okay, we'll cause troubles later

01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,460
Yes

831
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:48,500
I think if you burst out of the box maybe one of you hide in the box when the woman isn't looking close the box and wait until

832
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,980
The delivery woman picks up the box. She will carry you inside the pub

833
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:55,140
What about me? I just stay outside. I'm literally waiting in line for a queue

834
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:58,420
I'm pretty sure like people have to queue for like nightclubs or something like that

835
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,620
I'm keen to get in the pub right now

836
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:07,260
Never I've been to like clubs a few times and I'm just like oh, that's loud music

It's not for me make my ear. Oh, I got these I got these Tism

838
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:18,060
Earphones where you put in and it makes everything quieter when you go outside if you do not have them

839
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:23,140
They are so good. They are I cannot recommend them enough. I will literally send you a pair

840
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:26,620
It makes going outside a heck of a lot easier

841
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:28,980
Oh

842
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:35,340

Suggestion to a wasp girl a what oh see bug girls are an issue and I'll tell you why actually development

881
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,700
I don't mind telling you this

882
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:07,700
Really because of like arachnophobia, for example or insect phobia is a very real thing

883
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,900
It is it has a possibility of putting the girl at a disadvantage

884
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:19,580
Design one. Oh damn. Yeah, and if you didn't know I don't mind sharing this with you. Um, but you know, how you

885
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,580
Have

886
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:38,700
That's it no more do you know oh my god, give him the flower you you were amazing. Oh, I can't give him the flower

887
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,700
He doesn't like it

888
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:45,620
You want to play again

889
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:49,580
Mr. No, he just wants to look at us. That's fine. Um, oh

890
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,860
So, you know how you have two eyeballs

891
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,460
Yeah, do you want to know I made sure you had two eyeballs because

892
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:08,580
It's actually really startling if a vtuber only has one eye or there's like a mono eye like monster girl type thing

893
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,220
and it's kind of one of the rules of like

894
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:17,420
Development is you can't wait. Can she see me under the table and

895
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:22,380
You must have a girl with like two eyes that isn't too freaky or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage

896
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:27,860
And like it kind of goes the same for vtubers that might have multiple eye designs

897
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,700
like it's

898
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,460
Unfortunately, just like a weird

899
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:38,100
What is going on over here are we doing the dishes? Oh

900
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,100
Oh

901
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:50,540
It's the toilet under table under table. Oh, no, there's no table over here. Leave us alone. Leave me alone. I'm scared

902
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:59,660
Hold on I want this knife. Hold on. Let me go on. Oh, wow. She's like chasing me all the way out

903
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:02,140
No, I'm chasing me onto the table. Good luck with that

904
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,540
You look very menacing with a knife in your mouth

905
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,480
Oh

906
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,860
The knife is underneath you. I think what am I to do with the knife?

907
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:20,180
I don't know. I felt like maybe we can destroy the dartboard with the knife break to the dartboard get the toy boat

908
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,180
Make the old man fall on his bottom

909
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:28,740
Steal a paint glass and drop it in a canal and set the table knife work plate. Oh

910
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:34,460
Set what table? Oh, I'm like I'm like proper stuck. Oh, what's this?

911
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:38,100
I'm currently getting gridlocked my little good

912
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,660
Where are we supposed to set up a table? Oh

913
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:49,180
There's like a little underway pathway here, I mean a bug girl doesn't multiple need multiple eyes

914
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:54,800
It's it's kind of hard to like oh my god, I'm like, sorry

915
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,060
Mercy's currently fighting with the cafe owner and I'm like under here like

916
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:03,100
Well, actually when it comes to the designs and intricateness of having to produce them

917
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:07,780
Oh, no, don't shimmy out saying you can't get me when I'm under this dog

918
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,940
Wait

919
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,260
People are we supposed to set up wait we're meant to make him fall on his bottom

920
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:26,180
Oh when he goes to play the harmonic we need to move the chair out of the way. Oh

921
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,620
That's sad. I don't know. I know he seems a bit too old for this

922
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:34,420
Yeah, he's literally already says all my back hurts

923
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,260
How do we break a dart board?

924
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:42,700
Truly again, maybe we take a knife and then he throws the knife instead

925
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:52,980
No, he notices as soon as I take it right so then what's the table we sit can you pick up the door you can

926
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:03,620
I

927
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,100
Know

928
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,900
What the dealie it was

929
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:15,260
Reflings you're gonna have to hold my hand. I don't know what we're doing. Oh

930
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:18,820
No, no, no, no, that's okay

931
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:24,980
Don't sit scolera

932
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,700
It said we got to get his

933
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:33,820
So when he goes to play the harmonica so basically we have to watch him play darts and then he grabs the harmonica

934
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:41,020
The table is in the back of the pub where mercy got stuck out. We need to set a table whilst that person chases us around

935
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,260
That's severe

936
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:48,700
Biblically act here at Vichar for Angel. That's actually quite funny

937
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,700
Oh

938
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,580
You didn't get a bull's-eye, but that's okay

939
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:03,220
No, I wasn't I wasn't doing anything I wasn't doing anything

940
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,180
Oh

941
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:17,380
We've just a little bad now, okay. He actually recovered from oh, no, he didn't

942
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:21,300
No, we're sorry

943
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:27,060
I wasn't really in our attention, but we got it done right. We need to set a table up here

944
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:32,820
I'm setting a table table table table what table?

945
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,700

946
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,620
table

01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,820
The table that mercy got stuck at

948
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:45,700
Why yes, I am aware of a table mercy got stuck at surely

949
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:55,320
See any the candlestick also one with the candlestick. I've been able to pick up the candlestick though

950
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:05,580
Leave me alone. I'm just a little goose in a human world

951
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,100
Not up there is back left

952
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,620
Follow the path under the deck to get to the back

953
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,340
Wait, we're mersey got taken and I couldn't reach

The distance thing yeah, oh my god. I'm getting easier. I'm getting pushed out by the guard as well

964
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:28,540
Bring the guards. This is the best I can do literally is be right under you

965
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,260
They did not make this game easy

966
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:35,820
Player literally

967
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,740
Have you played it?

968
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:44,380
How is he chasing you out like this? We're literally all the way inside the rest wrong

969
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,540
Did the old man?

970
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,540

971
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:54,460
He is honing in on you can you come under the deck

972
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:03,300
Okay, you're safe. He should go away. Yeah, he said oh rassen for us and

973
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,580
He's gonna go get a beer

974
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:16,540
No, he instantly locks on you that doesn't that doesn't seem right that seems too difficult

975
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,140
Follow the

976
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:25,980
Her man can't catch a break wait. He's looking for his glass, but I broke it

977
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:33,860
Wait, there's now two people in the cafe area. We need like so much stuff from it

978
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,260
Does he give up

979
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:43,380
Hope he gives up. Yeah, is there anything we can do on this side? I don't think so

980
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:49,100
I can see the good sign here. They're gonna move it right here this sign right here. That's the no good sign

981
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:54,220
I can tell I have gamer instinct. There's a plate over here. Wait. There's already a plate here

982
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,500
There is

983
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:01,220
Okay, we'll take that and then we'll start getting it set up. Is there anything else I here I can grab?

984
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,220
That's a bucket

985
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:12,340
Hope I don't break it. No, I don't yeah. Oh, yeah, it's okay

986
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,460
Wow

01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:26,540
I can't believe he closed on his your face. So red

990
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,780
So what is?

991
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:33,820
Weird like oh geez old man. You just tried the dark bird

992
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,380

Yeah, I said give me this there we go right and then I'll go under the table with you

995
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:51,740
And then I'll go down the steps and then I can put it on the little table thing and then that's one more

996
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:54,140
I am ticked off the list. Yeah. Gee. She is

997
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:56,300
Feral for us right now

998
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:00,260
Okay, I'm following following. How's your motion sickness levels?

999
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:06,540
Question mark is a little bad because the camera keeps moving. Okay. Do we need to pause?

1000
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:13,700
We can always I'm very sad. I think we've had a good game in session. We do not actually have yeah

1001
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,700
I don't want you to actually be sick

1002
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:19,020
I think it's too much

1003
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:23,940
Please don't be afraid to say no because I can literally meme and chat and ask questions and stuff

1004
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:27,620
So I'm trying I'm trying to to to get through it

1005
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:34,500
Okay, how about we finish this goofy level and then maybe call it there because I don't want you to be sick

1006
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:40,460
Is she gonna be bothered? Probably it. Yeah, okay. Well, great. Right. Let's just check the list to make sure

1007
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:43,140
We need to steal

1008
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:49,620
Glass paint and drop it in the canal. I don't even know where that is. We just need a knife a fork and a candle, okay?

1009
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:53,100
Don't worry. There's a candle there. Oh

1010
01:49:54,500 --> 01:50:01,220
She's right. Oh, no, she's dead. Oh that camera angle twaddle in there. She doesn't bother with us. Does she now?

1011
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:03,220
She's just how she's just like

1012
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:07,820
What a curiosity you're breaking up my day. Thank you little geese for showing up

1013
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,820
Right, where is this fork?

Sugar

1015
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,580
She's gonna see me

1016
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:19,100
No, no, no, no, no, you don't see me. I am a mystery. Oh

01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:22,060
I'm out of bones

Pick up the knife, please. Okay, there we go. I got it. I got it. Got the knife

1036
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,100
And

1037
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:05,820
Run. Okay, we did it. The controls are not nice

1038
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:14,620
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I can't even see. I'm coming. Can you see me?

1039
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:21,740
Wait, the guy doesn't respond to honking at all. He doesn't care

1040
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:24,060
Oh

1041
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:28,060
He sucks. I don't like him

1042
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:35,660
Oh, no, I have made a grave error go. I need to go underneath or above either one. No, I'm getting pushed out

1043
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:40,300
He's such a bully. Oh, well, I can just sneak over

1044
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,420
Can you maybe run please?

1045
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:47,980
Okay, let's hide under here until he stops being aggressive on us. He is like the worst

1046
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:53,980
Yeah, darn it. And bro is not having a knife. No, no, wait. He shouldn't know where it is

1047
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:57,660
I left it on the other side of the fence at the restaurant part

1048
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:01,100
I like at the table but that we set up so it should be fine. Our knife is

1049
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:05,020
Yeah, go away, mr

1050
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:10,860
Stinky go go away, mr. Literally. He's so aggressive against us

1051
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:15,180
This is discrimination. I'll be talking to the bbc

1052
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:17,340
Exactly

1053
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:20,380
I'll be doing a report. I'll be getting interviewers out here

1054
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:23,740
So everyone can learn of your dastardly, right?

1055
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:30,700
Uh, what's this?

1056
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,540
Oh, go on. What is it?

1057
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:38,220
I don't know, but I'm pulling

1058
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:43,020
Oh my god, it's how I get a beer. Wait, but I don't have a glass

1059
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:46,700
Sugar. Well, I've got a fork. We need to fork anyway

1060
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:52,460
Let me get out of here with this fork. Wee. I don't know where the glass of beer is though

1061
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,580
All right, I'm underneath so she can't get me

1062
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:59,020
Okay, let's we broke it

1063
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:03,740
We did so how on earth did we get well? I did I broke it twice

1064
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:12,540
Ah, I knocked it over. No, no, it's okay. I think it's so tense as long as I found the table. I think it counts

1065
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,260
Wow, I'm doing a little 360

1066
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:19,340
All right, it says

1067
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,300
A knife and a candle. We actually do have a knife

1068
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,380
Right, we just need a candle and we've done this like a really awkward part

1069
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:30,060
Ah

1070
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,780
Okay, let's do this brush. There we go

1071
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,540
Or do we have to like actually set it?

1072
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:41,500
Like like the fork goes on the left the knife goes on the right type stuff

1073
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,580
No, they wouldn't put that in the game. They wouldn't put that right?

1074
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:51,100
I feel like that's like hoity toy. You know your knowledge. Well, I cannot pick up the fork. Is it glitched out?

1075
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,980
It says the fork is there. Okay

1076
01:54:54,380 --> 01:55:00,940
Still counts. We gotta get the candle now just the candle and then we're done this terrible back and forth section. I think

1077
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,940
Where was the hello? Hi

1078
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:07,660
I'm at a coyote

1079
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:10,060
Sorry, I didn't mean to be in your way

1080
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:12,940
Uh, wait, she's pushing me out of the way stinky

1081
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:22,220
You you want to give me all the attention lady, don't you? Yes, you do

1082
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,300
Well, uh, quick word word word she put the candle

1083
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,460
Uh

1084
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:31,820
Is that the back table again? It may be

1085
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:39,420
I'm just a goose getting all the attention for no oh i'm stuck on her for no particular

Okay, okay, I think it's okay. I think it's okay mine

1095
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:16,380
I've got the candlestick on

1096
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:22,300
That's the main thing as long as I got the candlestick. I can get you back in all you have to do is unpeel as we

1097
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:24,940
Yeah, you're not coming under here mate

1098
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:28,540
Uh, you may be able to get past

1099
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:34,300
Yeah, you can get back in if I distract him enough and then come under here with me

1100
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,260
Oh

1101
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:44,060
The controls the controls. Okay, we're safe. We're safe

1102
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:48,300
The heat is now off of us. Oh, you can see my little red flippers

1103
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:51,180
Oh, I got my little flip-flops

1104
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:55,820
Okay, he has gone back. I think we can now go to the wee restaurant. Okay, okay, let's go

1105
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:58,860
I'm stuck on something. We casually

1106
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:03,740
We're casually strolling. Why is it you're stuck? I'm like

1107
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:06,300
Getting stuck on there. There we go

1108
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,980
I don't know. Okay, there we go

1109
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:15,900
We we finally freaking did it. This one was not easy

1110
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:24,220
I think it's the control on the camera. Yeah, this camera angles bending around every two seconds. Good. Oh, I'm stuck again

1111
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:28,620
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. Is that vomit burp? I'm getting nervous

1112
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:34,300
And it was the motion sickness burp. I'm so sorry. Is it actually I we can stop

1113
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,780
I did not want you to throw up on our first collab

1114
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:39,420
Because I'm afraid the most

1115
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:43,100
Okay, if that was a bomb burp, I'm happy to say we have set the table

1116
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:48,460
Okay, I I'm not gonna make you play anymore. I really do not

1117
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,980
I don't want any issues

1118
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:54,140
Okay

1119
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:59,980
We will say thank you so so much to the reeflings and snippets for letting us have an absolute carry on

1120
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,620
Unfortunately, we mercy. Um, I

1121
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,380
I stupendously, uh, I stupendously asked her to

1122
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:13,740
Play a motion sickness inducing game. I had no idea that the camera angle was so violent towards her per mercy

1123
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:20,300
Um, but I think I think I'm happy to say we'll end it there because I don't want any I don't want any vomit. Okay

1124
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:25,180
Hey, that's the bottom line. Okay. That's the bottom line. No vomit, please

1125
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:29,260
Um, I'm sorry. I don't know. Don't be sorry

1126
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:35,100
Motion sickness burp. I was like, oh, it was so good. I haven't burped yet on stream and then

1127
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:36,860
Yeah

1128
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:40,220
Yeah, no, we'll play it safe. Please do not worry. Uh, let's play it nice and safe

1136
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:18,780
Um, we will leave it there and I'm going to let mercy lie down because I think she needs a good nap

1137
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:23,580
Or maybe a big lie down and some fizzy juice to help her feel a bit better. Um

1138
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:30,220
But thank you so so much for joining me mercy. I appreciate that so much and that was actually genuinely really fun

I mean we got we got so close though, but I would not have picked that game had I known how spinny camera it was

1172
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,140
I thought it was

1173
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,140
A straightforward linear

1174
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:13,100
