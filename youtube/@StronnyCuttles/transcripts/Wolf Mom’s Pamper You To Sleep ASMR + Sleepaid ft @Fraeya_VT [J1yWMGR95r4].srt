1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,680
poor thing you need to rest it's okay we've got you now it's alright to let

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:36,880
yourself relax we're here to reassure you all right don't mind our fluffy tails in fact you

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,240
might find it quite pleasant to be wrapped up in between us don't you I can sense that your

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:01:06,120
head is running 100 miles a minute but just take a moment to breathe one big inhale and one big exhale

5
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:30,720
it's okay to take your time you know that right not everything has to be now now now no wonder you

6
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:41,960
feel so stressed when you put such an immense amount of pressure on yourself who told you to do

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:56,240
that do you listen to everyone it gives you terrible advice but I'm being serious when I say just

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:07,560
take a moment to calm down you need some good sleep so I'll just have to make sure that I put

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:19,960
you into the deepest slumber I can manage in that case you might even need me to tell she was

10
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:31,800
wrong you know about what she said you put too much pressure on yourself you also put too much on

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:41,520
your plate at the same time I know you like being the workhorse and you like getting to the other side

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:49,840
but that's gonna have an effect on you if you sacrifice your sleep for it that's sacrificing

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:03,920
your health do you understand me good then just take a moment and try your best to tune out what's

14
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:14,760
going on around you it's just us three together in this moment we're guddled up we're looking after

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:27,360
you hopefully on the other end of this conversation you can feel yourself slowly dressed in all of this

16
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:39,680
sleep it's been a while since you've had a nice rest I can tell by your eyes it's the biggest

17
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:52,080
giveaway you know they aren't cold the windows to your soul for nothing it's alright to close your

18
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:04,240
eyes even if you don't think you'll fall asleep you can still listen to our words or at least the

19
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:18,480
sounds that we make do you like being wrapped up in our tails it's very fluffy isn't it I love

20
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:30,240
seeing people's reactions to just how incredibly soft they are why don't I try to reassure you a

21
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:45,360
little while you focus on how soft how soothing our tails are it's okay to worry but don't worry

22
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:58,080
you're so sick you are allowed to make mistakes you're only human after all so far you've made it

23
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:10,240
through 100% of all of your bad days and that makes you so incredibly strong you've been able to push

24
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:19,760
through everything even when life gets hard and you always come out on top on the other side don't

25
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:33,600
you that makes you so very brave in my eyes sometimes you just need reassurance and that's okay

26
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm glad to be able to do that for you it's a pleasure in all honesty so thank you for listening

27
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:56,480
to me the best way that we can support you right now is getting you to sleep I think

28
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:07,280
it may seem like a small act but a well-rested mind can help navigate what the world has to offer

29
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:19,840
sometimes it can be confusing why we have a negative experience you may think to yourself why me

30
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,160
why now I present to you a question

31
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,840
if everything in your life was good then would you really appreciate the good times

32
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,680
I think sometimes with the bad it makes the good times even sweeter

33
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:56,240
that's what I think anyway you might not agree or you might even be asleep by now

34
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:07,040
just from our whispers alone wouldn't that be adorable humans really do work themselves silly

35
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,240
then I should be extra mindful a pamper you in a pure bliss line

36
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,640
good night dear human get as much rest as you need

37
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:40,240
it's time to let it all go and enter the deep slumber
