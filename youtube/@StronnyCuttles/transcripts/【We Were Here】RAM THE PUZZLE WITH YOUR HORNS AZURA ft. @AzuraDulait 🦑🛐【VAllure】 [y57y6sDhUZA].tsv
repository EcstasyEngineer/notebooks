733560	737680	don't worry I played it before I don't want to tell her what to do though I
737680	743040	found symbols on a wall okay perfect tell me what these symbols are over I
743240	751160	think this is the first one if I'm not mistaken yeah there's three there's
751160	760240	three rows and at the top three it's the first time was like a circle with with
760240	769240	a with the X across it and then one going in the middle okay Roger over
769440	777600	huh so I have identified the symbol but I need a symbol along with that either an
777600	784760	eye color pupil or a second shape over I love try hard in the video games what
784760	791080	eye color pupils eye color pupil I have a green eye potentially a blue eye or a
791120	807520	red eye over I have a red eye and a green eye red eye and a green eye do you
807520	813920	need us can you touch symbols in a wall over I think I remember this one I'm
813920	831280	cheating so much and you have a red left eye and a right green eye over I've
831280	836600	just caught up her comes can you repeat that over is this where we find out
837280	846600	can you repeat your last communication over a left red eye and a right green eye
846600	852680	over okay symbols are someone having diarrhea and then the next symbol to
852680	859080	touch is a circle with a cross and a line straight down over
859080	872680	oh come on tell me that's not a bot with someone having diarrhea straight over she's
872680	885280	talking but she's talking for red left and right green the first symbol is diarrhea a
885280	888400	little but with diarrhea straight up line going down it and then the second
888440	899760	symbol is an X a circle and a line going down over I thought it was a fancy tea like
899760	904160	an oh maybe maybe an upside down umbrella might help her a bit better none of
904160	908280	these look like diarrhea though other than that one
908840	915760	little diarrhea can't it couldn't be me I'm constipated again I don't think you
915840	924560	can click them all at once though only one at a time if so the diarrhea symbol or the
924560	934280	upside down umbrella like it got blown in the wind is your first symbol I click that and then
934280	939680	for your second symbol is a circle with a line down and an X through it over

2826320	2833600	ears on it look like one with ears is icy which are pointy ears there and there's one with a
2833600	2845360	little flag at the tip of a mountain and then a guy in a jacuzzi over yeah a guy in a jacuzzi

2854800	2861280	she said some guy standing on a boat wait with one eyeball I mean that's exactly what she's just
2861280	2865360	um as the fourth symbol got diamonds on the head and hands
2865680	2877120	no it's just a lantern like it's definitely circles over and then like three three two sticking out of
2877120	2884720	it on each side looks like the lamp like a lamp like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast oh okay okay

2932480	2941280	like a boom a boob no is it skinny I don't know what these books I can't remember what the freaking
2941280	2947680	book stage was well these books are so similar to what she's explaining it could be this one
2947680	2953760	um no it can't be that one because she said the last one's like a boat no it can't be that one either
2956160	2959440	um can you input these symbols anywhere like uh

3009760	3016560	the floor where there are no spear I know what to do okay you need to explain the symbols in
3016640	3020160	high detail okay did the symbols restart
3022320	3028560	I'm to look at the back of the book no it's yes the symbols did in fact restart but they
3028560	3035360	still look similar it's similar they are very similar on my end first one looks the same it's
3035360	3042000	like a small like oval half oval body with two sticks sticking out like a snow oh you know like
3042080	3051440	the snowman we the snowman one with the funny face what this one is now a face with the ears

3075120	3082000	out that is a pentus pointing out that is a pentus as two big balls is it like a bird's eye view of
3082000	3092560	the balls there's a guy in a tucuzi still their head is a oval like a flower is it squished over

3109200	3115600	with pointy pointy stick at the top yes yes not descending oh even when the sand is at the back
3116240	3122240	and then a person standing on a boat they have a dress one eyeball with oval head

3406960	3413040	brah okay let's try that again brah i literally got played by english i hate the english language
3413040	3421280	so much so what's the symbol is it the same it's not good it's the same you're very lucky
3421280	3429440	no way is it actually yeah they're the same i love it here okay western wall let's go
3433200	3441040	i've killed her so many times now right nothing can chase her you said two steps east right no
3442080	3446480	right i'm going to read it out to you and then we can use our logic together okay
3447040	3454960	she's talking but she's not okay right it says in the western corner lies your start so we'll go
3454960	3468880	there i'm there keep moving north but watch your step before the last tail okay so don't go all the
3468880	3476080	way north okay she's nodding she's nodding again okay now don't go anywhere read this with me okay
3477280	3488960	before your last tail you must head east okay so you can go east one you don't die on east one
3492080	3501680	okay then the book says after these two steps so you can go east twice question mark
3506480	3512960	so go east one to what she's doing she's i don't know if i should go to that tile i think i died on
3512960	3520640	the tile twice okay twice i just went one more step okay so you've gone east twice technically yes
3523280	3530640	if i step on this child wait wait wait i died on this don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go
3530640	3538000	don't go don't go oh don't go so from so from the western side you've gone east twice technically
3538000	3548400	yes yes okay now it says take one step towards the south head to the eastern wall then you may
3548400	3556240	proceed towards the door so i think you go south once then all the way east and then all the way
3557120	3558880	that makes sense right over
3563440	3570800	oh thank god i'm not doing that one again that was shite that's shite being Scottish that was awful
3571600	3577680	fucking english why did they do english like that brave right i'm going in a okay this is the one
3577680	3584720	where i can die i can see her model she has no idea what's going on she can hear it though
3586800	3593120	there's a show and i'm being hunted and she has no idea i'm just gonna let her have fun
3593120	3601840	she'll figure out she'll figure out it's fine he has to watch them so i am on the other side of the show
3604800	3611040	a movie you are going to be pulling out scenes for me to watch
3611040	3616640	uh uh uh
3619360	3623200	um there should be a narration lever if i'm not mistaken
3625280	3630560	there's gonna be a monster right behind me isn't there oh it's not there yet well he comes up soon
3631440	3632720	there's a couple of lovers

3648080	3654640	and we have room temperature iq and i forget how the rest of the song goes but
3655600	3665120	super hard puzzles super hard puzzles they're really difficult because they're super super super
3665120	3673520	hard puzzles as they will get revenge there's the enemies sneaking up on me do you have a narration
3673520	3682480	lever what's what's that what's in a what a lever it's a lever that literally has narration on it
3682480	3689680	or maybe scene one something like that yeah it's a scene one on it if you pull it i think it gives
3689680	3697520	you dialogue scene one or does it give me the dialogue and i'm to tell her what to do with that
3698560	3701840	man i wish i could sit in the seats um

5555160	5556920	Oh my God, we did it.
5556920	5557920	We did it.
5557960	5561560	King, Queen, that was Castle and Townspeople.
5561560	5564600	Okay, now let's find out what's happening in this next scene.
5564600	5565440	What's next?
5568000	5570640	Until the King killed all he could,
5570640	5572200	give me Evil King.
5572200	5573360	Put the good King away.
5573360	5575720	Boo, put the King away.
5575720	5576560	Boo.
5578760	5580200	We need Evil King now.
5582080	5583720	I don't know which one the King is.
5584720	5590160	Yep, perfect, perfect, all the way.
5590160	5591000	Get rid of that.
5591000	5591840	Boo.
5591840	5593840	Right, now we need Evil King out.
5593840	5596040	Evil King, Evil King.
5597040	5598080	Oh, here he comes.
5598080	5599600	Push, push, push him all the way out.
5599600	5600800	Perfect, perfect.
5600800	5602320	Oh, he's deranged, he's deranged.
5602320	5604720	Okay, now we need the bloodlights in the back.
5606720	5608360	You piss off, I'm working hard.
5608360	5610040	Okay, scene.
5611040	5615040	Until the King killed all he could.
5615040	5615880	Oh, he's crazy.
5615880	5616800	He's absolutely mental.
5616800	5618120	He's deranged.
5618120	5621120	Standing in blood, he probably said.
5622600	5626120	Standing in blood, he proudly said,
5626120	5630440	give me Blood King in Castle.
5630440	5632640	Maybe Blood King in Light,
5632640	5635080	and that's the Evil King in the Bloodlight.
5635080	5636440	I think that might be it.
5637680	5639280	Everyone away, Bloodlight on.
5640200	5643360	Okay, perfect, and Bloodlight on and scene.
5647040	5649080	No, no, that's the Bloodlight off, sorry.
5649080	5650680	Pop that bad boy back on.
5652320	5654120	And then pull scene.
5654120	5656320	Shit, you might need to bring out
5656320	5659640	the dead townspeople, I don't even know if that's possible.
5659640	5660480	He just says.
5663680	5664760	I don't think there's dead.
5664760	5669000	Oh, oh, oh, sorry, bring out the normal King again.
5669040	5671120	He just says standing in blood.
5671120	5672720	Maybe one, maybe, can you bring out
5672720	5673920	the Evil King any further?
5673920	5676600	Sorry, see if you can wind him out any further.
5680840	5683760	No, no, okay, maybe put Evil King away
5683760	5684960	and bring out normal King,
5684960	5687920	because he's just standing in blood, so with a Bloodlight.
5687920	5689120	What's the stage four?
5689120	5691640	Oh, I'm dying, ho ho ho, hurry up, Azura.
5691640	5693720	Hee hee, love you, love you, Mummy, please, sorry,
5693720	5695160	please don't let me die.
5695160	5698240	Okay, perfect, and then put away Evil King.
5698240	5699720	Yeah, yeah, yeah, go away, Evil King.
5699720	5702920	You stink, boo, boo, thumbs down.
5702920	5704800	Okay, pull scene.
5710120	5710960	You did it!
5714640	5717960	You did it, go down into the attic thing.
5720840	5723600	What the fuck was that noise, God damn.
5723600	5725800	Oh my God, that was a painful one I've dead met.
5725800	5727760	Hey, see me, hi.
5729080	5732760	You still have to talk to me through the walkie-talkie, though.
5734760	5738960	Oh my God, oh, your walkie-talkie's just hovering.
5742720	5747720	No, Azura, you might be the mother of all creations, okay?
5749040	5754040	Of all life on this earth, so it's you who must go on.
5755040	5759000	Go ahead, I will stand on the pressure plate
5759000	5761640	and you will get freedom that you deserve.
5761640	5763720	Your creations need you.
5763720	5766000	Go forth, Azura, into the snow.
5768880	5771360	What happened in you?
5771360	5774800	It is the sacrifice I must make, for I am a siren.
5774800	5779560	I take life, but you are the goddess of fertility you give.
5779560	5782440	Go on forth to humanity.
5782960	5784840	Give them the love they deserve.
5788280	5789120	She went.
5789120	5789960	No!
5794400	5795800	You did it.
5795800	5798920	Was there another way, question mark?
5798920	5802920	That was amazing, you did it, Azura.
5802920	5803880	Hee-hee-hee.
5803880	5804720	You did it!
5804720	5807880	You did it, that was fantastic, you did so well.
5807880	5809960	You were worried about nothing.
5810960	5813120	I don't think so.
5813120	5815480	It was good, you did fantastic.
5817480	5819320	Hee-hee-hee.
5819320	5821040	Wait, what did you think?
5821040	5822640	What did you think of that game type?
5822640	5823640	Yes or no?
5824920	5827480	I was, that was hard.
5827480	5829680	I'm not good at puzzles at all.
5829680	5833600	That, the last one was painful.
5833600	5836160	I have to admit, that was really hard to figure out.
5836160	5838400	Even, I've played the game before
5838400	5841480	and I kind of knew what you were doing on your end
5841480	5844120	and I still couldn't figure it out from the other perspective.
5844120	5846600	So don't feel dumb, that was hard.
5846600	5848000	It was hard as shit.
5848000	5851920	I think I should study chessboards more.
5853400	5856760	Well, I literally was calling the king, the queen at one point
5856760	5859040	and then Refleens were like, that's the king you moron.
5859040	5861200	I'm like, oh, okay, okay, I'll deal with it.
5864200	5866560	So don't worry about it, don't worry about it.
5866560	5869840	But there's like a whole series on the WiiWare here.
5869840	5873760	I think there's now four installments of the franchise.
5875840	5880280	And for some reason, on the very last installment of this game,
5880280	5884400	they made it so unbelievably hard and difficult for no reason.
5885360	5887200	And all the other ones?
5887200	5891160	Yeah, so I've been lucky enough to play them
5891160	5894320	with other VTubers and another life team.
5894360	5898480	And the fourth installment is impossible without cheating.
5900160	5902960	I refuse to believe anyone naturally came up
5902960	5904600	with one of the answers in them.
5904600	5908200	But if you ever wanted to give another one a shot,
5908200	5909600	I'm right here, Azura.
5911840	5913960	But I don't know if puzzles are your thing.
5913960	5915240	Well, I don't know if they're your thing.
5915240	5917560	They're not my thing, I'm dumb.
5917560	5920360	Oh, that's adorable though, I loved it.
5920360	5923880	I'm sorry about scaring you about the monster in the maze.
5923880	5930320	I'm going to be honest, the monster can't get you in the maze.
5930320	5932360	I was just waning you up, I'm sorry.
5936240	5939000	That's what you get for waning me up in among us.
5939000	5941600	We were talking before the stream and she was like,
5941600	5944440	I purposely picked on you to hear that Scottish accent.
5944440	5948000	I'm like, Azura, you're not supposed to say that.
5948000	5949560	She's like, oh, because I was like,
5949560	5951320	oh, I don't get angry or frustrated.
5951320	5953680	And she was like, the among us club.
5953680	5954520	And I'm like, you know what?
5954520	5955720	You've actually got me there.
5955720	5956520	I got caught red.
5956520	5957640	You caught me.
5957640	5958960	You caught me.
5958960	5961520	You got me, I'm not going to lie.
5961520	5963480	It was funny.
5963480	5966960	Or you got so mad, she'd vote me off immediately.
5966960	5970440	And then I wasn't even the imposter and then she'd get.
5970440	5974160	I always, if someone, if anyone picks on me,
5974160	5976040	I'm like, instantly you're the imposter
5976040	5977720	because you're worried I'm going to snuff you out.
5977720	5979560	And then obviously I think I booted you off once
5979560	5980280	and you were innocent.
5980280	5982040	And then everyone was like, you're gilly strong.
5982040	5985400	And I'm like, no, no, Azura is starting then.
5985400	5987520	You started.
5987520	5989520	I'm going to end it.
5989520	5993400	I was so scared.
5993400	5994360	That was so good.
5994360	5997040	Thank you so much for playing with me and enjoyed myself
5997040	5997540	thoroughly.
5997540	5999840	Are you streaming after this or is that
5999840	6000840	you done for today?
6000840	6003920	Because I don't know if I should be direct into year or not.
6003920	6004960	I'm done for today.
6004960	6007480	I'm probably just going to chat with my stream for a little bit.
6007480	6008240	Yes, OK.
6008240	6009600	I say a little bit, but it's probably
6009600	6012120	going to be for like two hours.
6012120	6014080	They didn't call you yet for calling for nothing
6014080	6015360	around these parts.
6015360	6017960	OK, let me make sure I'm redirecting into year.
6020800	6025920	Because I don't want to not direct into year.
6025920	6026920	But that was so fun.
6026920	6029040	Please, if you ever wanted to play more of those,
6029040	6031680	I enjoy those games totally not because I've played them before
6031680	6032680	and they're not impossible.
6032680	6034360	Tee, tee.
6034360	6037800	If I played them fresh, I'd be a lot more nervous
6037800	6043120	because I'm like, um, but I think we did OK.
6043120	6043920	I was nervous.
6043920	6046600	You were going to get upset that I was so dumb.
6046600	6048840	No, I would never get upset at you for no good.
6048840	6050040	I mean, like, I was.
6050040	6052200	Don't get off the puzzle forever.
6052200	6052800	Oh, bro.
6052800	6054120	That last puzzle killed us.
6054120	6055200	Not going to lie.
6055200	6056080	Everything else.
6056080	6057560	I don't want this puzzle that I ever.
6057560	6058520	We blitzed through.
6058520	6060600	The longest puzzle.
6060600	6062600	The longest puzzle I've ever gotten stuck on
6062600	6065560	was like for literally two days straight.
6065560	6067440	And what?
6067480	6069760	I'd just cheat at that point.
6069760	6072040	It was.
6072040	6073840	I don't think you can cheat, though.
6073840	6076720	Like, yeah, you can cheat to find out what you have to do.
6076720	6078600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6078600	6081120	You have to actually time it.
6081120	6082520	It was like a timing puzzle.
6082520	6084360	And I could never get the timing, right?
6084360	6087080	No, I don't like that kind of stuff.
6087080	6091760	And apparently there's a game called Labyrinth Co-op Horror Puzzle.
6091760	6094000	I'm not sure if I can put the girls up for that.
6094000	6097160	I was freaking Azura pretending a slug was going to grab her.
6097200	6099440	I don't know how I should respond to a game like that.
6102440	6103640	I scream.
6103640	6104840	Terrible.
6104840	6105640	Right.
6105640	6108000	I am going to redirect into Azura,
6108000	6110120	because unfortunately I do have a few things to do today.
6110120	6112360	And thank you so, so much for playing me.
6112360	6113600	That was a hoot and a holler.
6113600	6114880	I'm going to redirect into you.
6114880	6117480	Reeflings, be lovely to the bleeding hearts.
6117480	6118240	I'm bleeding hearts.
6118240	6121640	Thanks for having me as well on your end of things, Azura.
6121640	6122840	I will redirect into you.
6122840	6124000	Thank you so, so much.
6124000	6125560	I give everyone kisses.
6126560	6129240	And I'm going to dissipate, okay?
6129240	6130360	I'm going to dissipate.
6130360	6131720	I'm going to jump out of voice chat first,
6131720	6133800	because Azura is going to be like, bruh.
6133800	6136040	She's going to be like, bruh, what's going on here?
6136040	6137040	Okay.
6137040	6137880	All right, I take off.
6137880	6138720	Bye-bye, guys.
6138720	6139760	Bye.
6139760	6140760	Bye-bye.
6140760	6141760	Bye.
6141760	6142760	Bye.
