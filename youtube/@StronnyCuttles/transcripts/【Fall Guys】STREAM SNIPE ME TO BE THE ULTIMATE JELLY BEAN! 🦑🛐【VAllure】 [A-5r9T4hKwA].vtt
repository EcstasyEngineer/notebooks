00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon my little weflins

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
We are playing this redonkulous game that is known as Fall Guys

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Sorry if you had to download the bottom thing cause of me, but thank you for downloading the thing cause of me

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
This game is called Fall Guys, but we have dubbed it the Jelly Bean Game

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Just wanna start off the stream by announcing some terrible fucking news

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh gee, for any membership stream today, they'll watch longer than 90 the museum

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Unfortunately I'm gonna have to reschedule it in a couple of days time

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Because I was born with this curse of being a fucking woman

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm fucking tired and I'm really sick right now, unironically

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Solo, squad, duo, no solo

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh there's like tons of different freaking game modes

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, no you're not to let me win, hold on let me go

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Of course I've not gone on freaking, see this live chat top chat nonsense

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Vigo, yeah, I forgot what V is, vector? I think vector in the alphabet

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It's okay, oh it's been a fucking terrible week

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I didn't wanna be one of those VTubers that are like I'm a ketchup packet, I'm a fucking ketchup packet

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm so bloody tired of it, I'm exhausted

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Yesterday I was like up ed in the Freya collab, like the subtitles on it

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
To make the video, and my heart was murmuring away over and over and over

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
And I'm like you need to calm down, like I'm tired, please

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And like I've just woken up and my heart was murmuring again

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
So I'm currently drinking a fucking fruit smoothie, I've got a cup of tea

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I can't play on US servers, no you need to swap to US servers

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
I mean we can resolve that issue for a while, you'll have to wait until October and then you can do it okay

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Pop, pop, pop, pop

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Do it for my birthday, how about that

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Meow, meow, meow

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm gonna be learning the controls as you go along

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Wait what?

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Almost typed the code into the chat because I forgot how controllers were interacted

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
You're so fucking adorable, oh my god look at my weephins coming in

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
I can't see you guys yet, I just saw something connecting to the server

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I wish, didn't I know I used to like zoom out and show all of us together as you guys were coming in

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm in, hey yeah

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
I have hard lag on US servers, I mean it's better than Australian servers

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
I can tell you that much, if I played Oceanic I would be winning because some of the best

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Because of the lag

04:40.000 --> 04:51.000
We all pick the same cosmetics so you can't tell who's you're being, you can see as if you expand the player list

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh my god it's my free flings

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
You guys really got Xbox and stuff, oh look I can see if you're on Xbox and who's on game

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
No, did I do it right?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
How is this the best I can do?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Good morning, are you guys at Stony's bread mode where it sounds like a Stan account now?

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
What if it's like sunglasses on?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
How does it know I'm already looking sideways?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
This is getting freaky honestly

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Right and then if I pin it in between

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:19.120
anonymous thank you for the tip version i'm talking about the alternative outfit isn't fair

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:27.520
why you don't like the idea of me sitting on you shocking i want to do i want to get a comic strip

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.840
where i accidentally sit on you and i have no idea where you went and you're like obviously on my boat

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.360
you can check what the key findings are how dare you suggest something so smart

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.280
if you like games with ink i suggest you pay bendy and the ink machine

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.400
is that a real game or did you just make that up that sounds like a made-up game

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.680
oh you like ink that's right go play schwaubelmobel and the ink machine thank you veal or lover for

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.920
the super chat oh it's a real game okay what kind of game it's a horror game

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:13.360
oh no i mean i have a heart rate monitor and i have a uh shock collar on the way

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:21.360
um i've i've asked if any of the girls want their uh if any of the girls want my shock collar

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:29.680
um we have scrumptious night we have leo ink we have chair we have dust fantasy god king air

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:39.440
solely oh no something like that doody uh sit and ink and that's how rooflings are i've missed

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:45.840
one i think apparently um yes i have heart rate monitor now i also have a shock collar um i have

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:53.200
a very interesting shock collar stream coming up um i'll be a slight blast to the past for a few years

01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.480
but um the punishment is if i lose i have to shock myself i had to get a freaking dog collar

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.840
because obviously a dog collar isn't gonna fucking ask for your buddy ip address location name

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:13.040
date of birth and all that whereas like this fucking chinese one did um so i've said to the girls

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.760
i was like if anyone wants the shock collar for content i'll send it to you but just warning

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:25.280
you that it takes your data and like the app takes your data as well and um yeah basically

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.520
that's the trade off if you want a free collar you unfortunately have to give this app your thing

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.640
but yeah i yeah the only thing i could get was a dog collar because it's not gonna ask for my

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:45.280
freaking ip address um why does it take your data uh china is set up a bit differently

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.720
like if you ever order anything from china you have whoa

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.200
this song is so good sorry the whole thing just died off there we've got three leaflings left

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:05.440
oh i'm sorry i've jinxed it oh okay well taken strong in front of all kids

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.680
i feel like emi would love it emi's already got one shibi's already got one so i don't

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:18.160
know if ac0 or mersey want to if they don't want it it's getting shoved in the bin but yeah china's

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.400
goods are kind of set up slightly different from our usual wait you don't trust the chinese communist

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:33.520
i'm like why the heck um why the heck that i have to give you a phone number to zap myself

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.240
remotely and um i was like looking into the app and it scrubs all your personal data it like scrubs

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.360
your phone contacts and stuff and i'm like no why would i need that to administer a little bit of

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:56.160
shocky poos on myself no yeah literally thousand minus thousand social credit unironically though

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.800
i can't imagine shibi shocking herself emis but not shibi i thought shibi already got one

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:09.040
shibi already she bought the same one that i've got or i've got the same one that she got

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.920
do you not want an extra 300 to your social credit score for boosting the economy

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:23.360
we've already sold my private data it's already gone there's some guy called jimping that's terrible

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.160

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:53.520
i was something with a sentence like that i'm gonna start me on a tinfoil hat rant what if i told you

01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:01.680
you know that's the whole point like you stream for one week 10 hours per day because you're crazy

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.200
i don't know why you feel bad i guess it's just like because i know my dad's um getting here very

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.320
soon like then it really will be like i can't i can't be like right let's play only two hours of

baltrow wink wink and then end up with five hours like i know i can't do that when he gets here

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.200
and it's going to be like that for a little while like oh my god is there someone called day

like last time it's really fucking actually sorry this is me just going on a rant about

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.240
being a woman in general it's really annoying because one month ketchup season can not be that

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.000
bad and then another like this month for example i'm like completely knocked on my ass like i feel

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.680

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.680
i was like oh okay then because like i literally obviously i streamed for the full month in june

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.880
um so i streamed you know during that time and like i was absolutely fine and you wouldn't even

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.440
be able to tell what stream i was on you know you know what i'm saying i've heard that can affect it

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:31.680
too if you don't get enough iron yes i basically eat steak once a month to try and replenish my

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:39.040
iron so i get to have steak so at least um my dad's gonna cook it for me i'm sorry but i like

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.520
well done steaks i said what i said dinny give me a raw steak dinny give me a blue steak that

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.960

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.800
you're enjoying it i'm glad it's just like a silly game it's got such upbeat music as well

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:29.200
like it's so fun and goofy and and it's like even if you get knocked off you're not like mad at

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:36.960
yourself you're just like ah you know oh good everything is guaranteed to win there will be

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:44.480
four winners this round oh dear there's one team that hasn't scored anything yet oh dear

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:48.560
it's not looking good my it's not looking good

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.640
i wish it gave assigned like team names so i could be like oh this team whoever's in this

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:05.120
team oh we're humping each other oh no do worse players behind are you the only one on the map

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:12.960
no you're not zero oh okay there we go i'm sorry team no no no no it's not like that it's goofy game

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:22.080
three squads qualified oh wait there's an odd number of you never mind we won

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:31.120
at the end will you take in consideration the scottish is more you mean make more scottish

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:38.080
is more i can do that i don't think there are many games that make me sweat more than this one

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.360
i felt that oh i almost choked there don't worry i did the choking around these parts

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.560
yeah team names and team member names would be nice yeah even so i can just be like oh the

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.400
avocado team or something as simple as that uh what

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.960
what

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.920
are you guys getting points oh

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.320
i would not have gotten that i'm not even kidding

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:31.040
oh my brain does not work like that there's no way i would have gotten anywhere near points in this

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.040
i mean you could browse those spectators and name them yourself i don't know who's the part of

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.960
whose team though which is why it'd be impossible to give you his name gotta remember which tells

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:56.720
of the fruit you should play mario car it's a 12 game uh i suck at mario car um the new versions

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:01.680
of mario car i can't play but if you want to roll me in the game absolutely i'm more than

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:07.280
happy to play mario car but there's no way in heck i'm winning i don't know how it works

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:15.200
i was cheating last time and i was oh i was getting used to hold back um

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:23.680
um just so i can win oh there you go two squads we're in the last squadron

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.640
what's it gonna be

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:37.680
hexagon i've not got a switch we still qualify let's go

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:45.760
oh what refling team will be stan left standing is the question and none other than the most

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:53.200
recognizable game hexagon oh it's funny how they don't face you to each other

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:03.200
now we do have to work as a team without sabotage on the board too much because you have friends

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:11.920
so you can't just be going all willy nilly or else you're gonna perish

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:20.000
day worst player might be in for a good player reward i don't know what i was trying to say

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.800
there let's try so you might be thinking squady is taking a very interesting tactic and destroying

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.360
a layer that the others have yet to reach

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:43.440
hmm seems like we're quite populated up here there's a lot of reeflings on the yellow we're

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:50.640
starting to fall down though you'll never guess what the hexagons are almost gone

01:33:51.520 --> 01:34:00.160
oh okay okay okay look i'm not a commentator i'm just doing my thing

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.320
so they're killing each other friends this weakness leaving the body what are you

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.080
are you perishing your teammates you're not supposed to hurt your teammates

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.840
friends what friends just a miserable little pile of secrets those wengas oh i don't know that

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:26.080
reference now there are three reeflings who are already on the lowest layer

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.320
hmm

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.320
hmm

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:41.760
lay wink is trying to take out tiny spiny me so i don't think they're actually

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.760
wait did they just take themselves out i think they just took themselves out

01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:01.200
solid blake is the only survivor of his team cookie fumbler and tiny spiny might actually

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:10.960
take themselves out they are a part of the same take same team as nonism sorry i get so intense um

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:20.080
cookie fumbler is just absolutely going through the hexagons not really maximizing his time with them

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:28.960
the winners are the worst player solid blake parallaxian and lewain congrats on the winners

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.800
i failed

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:48.320
wow the lobby code six delta vector five bravo master chief the go clearly

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.840
someone's got some errors in this game and it's none of us it's one of you but it's none of us

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:05.600
okay solid clutch if you want a streamable cart game you may look at disney's speed storm i

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:06.960

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:12.320
brain will connect the two doors i don't know if that's true or not but yeah that one is the

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.080
ultimate rng but yeah like i like when it's up to chance and not skill

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:24.960
my squad is on it let's go this one is it is avoid the thick doors can't avoid mommy's

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.080
thick doors i don't think i've ever had my butt cheeks described as a thick door before

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:38.720
oh yeah you want to open this door open them oh it's the fruit one careful

you're simply gambling addictive look all i'm gonna say is that belcher was really fun

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:59.200
but if you get sucky runs it sucks the soul out of you but as soon as you get a good run

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.760
you get all the endorphins i don't think i can spectate i'm not being funny that's like

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:10.720

i i like stream sniping i don't have any problem with that i think it's fun like um i wanted to

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:56.800

02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:03.600
talk to you in voice chat but i don't know if that puts people off so i just play safe i hope

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:11.040
i hope you play ultra kill i'm pretty sure um azura is playing ultra kill at the moment

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:20.000
i have no idea what the game is about oh two squads left and one that only has three members

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:21.600
my squad through

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:31.200
i'd watch apex couldn't pay me to play it not even if i was on your team we can go into salt

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.440
lake city servers because no one plays on that and then it's just us everybody's watching

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:44.560

two weeks the actual shock collar stream i'm to use on and

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:39.360
and if it goes well i mean i can use it in general like see we play elton ring and then like we die

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.840
when we go against a boss i can shock myself like that now i'm thinking of this damn whoever said that

the rhinos were constantly invoking you

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.520
strony have you completed elton ring the base game i have once before

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:16.800
with the help of many but i did do it that's the main thing i did do it even though i had

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:24.480
help i did do it so i have played the game i haven't finished the dlc though um i don't

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:31.760
even know how little or far we're into the dlc uh last thing i remember was we found this flower

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.960
place and there was a guy on a horse and we beat him up and then there's another guy on the horse

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.160
and beat him up as well but we had to whack him a few times oh you're playing volleyball

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:54.400
oh where's the ball oh come on replays you can do it there is one point scored already

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.400
uh if i recall you're about halfway yeah we defeated the lion

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.960
horse man in flower place is optional

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:15.040
um we did try and get the guy that turns into a snake but he got the best of us so

02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.160
um i think we're just kind of exploring i don't know if we'll go back to base game

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:26.320
or not i'm unsure but someone gave me a special crossbow that goes

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.240
uh so i'm helping to get the the enemy a little bit in Elden Ring i'm going

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.680

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:37.680

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.400
i was laughing at a reefling

02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.880
wait this snake guy picking up a reefling was i laughing and nervousness because he was getting

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:06.320

it's over for me yeah you want the chance of jewels okay how about we do jewels next

02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:52.160
and then but we're not allowed to go we have to jump on our jewels back like all of us

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:56.880
i was behind you the whole time yeah did we win

02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:06.800

02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:12.640
falling off the map oh we're so unlucky we're trying our best though

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:20.560
mm finally made it through the first round damn after land

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:26.800
thank you for the tip anonymous someone needs to clip you saying give me your

02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:35.440
blue give it when training right now starts right now i have a collection of six i have plenty to

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:46.880
go around although i might be adding to the collection soon i saw i saw a very unique

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:51.840
animation and now i want something whoa wait why are you standing in the corner

02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:56.480
what is this what do you do

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:02.400
is your goal to finish the keypad together

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:17.040
oh wow no way you guys are smart enough to do that how do you know

02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:25.520
no way that's so smart sorry that's actually so smart

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:33.680
oh we're making a few mistakes so we're getting there

02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:44.480
whoa oh my god i love this i want to play this one i'm going to ask the question every

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:51.200
reefling wants to know but is too afraid to ask does strongly like a reeflings ink salty or sweet

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:59.280
i like it anyway it comes thank you i don't for the tip if it comes from a reefling

02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:04.640
i'll take it doesn't matter the quality the condition

02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:16.160
if it's reefling ink i want it do you understand i want it

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:28.560
why are you doing it reeflings look at the monitor to know what you need to make

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.000
it's so funny to see the lag because like one reefling would be like i'm helping

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.680
and then it's like destroying it

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.960
mommy has an ink tax oh the only kind of tax i'll accept

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:53.120
this is strong and you've got to be saying stuff like that when i'm helping my team

02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:57.760
oh maybe i should do that next time so we can win

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:05.600
my teammates are not allowed to leave the mute stream for two minutes and then i just say the

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.840
most absolute veil things i want to do to you

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:25.440
oh reefling are you still sleeping oh you just stay asleep mommy just needs to help herself okay

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:34.320
oh it's the christmas map

02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:08.320
we tried our best when you try our best but you don't succeed

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:19.200
that was so good i'm not like i'm not upset or anything that was so good i got mounted by mommy

02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:26.080
i'm so sorry about no that was funny big apologies to my teammate no you tried your

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:35.280
best that's the main thing um it's h to ask for a piggyback on pc okay it's too hard to

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:43.040
carry straw day honestly though okay you don't have to do the piggyback thing you can just go

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:52.480
for it now you can just run go reflings go check this out okay what we're checking you out

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:58.560
what refling was that was it you that said check this out i think oh right well we checked out for

02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:03.760
a little bit i thought the piggybacking thing was fun yeah if i'm in the round i'll force you

02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:09.840
to piggyback but if i'm not in the round then you don't have to do it either i got sabotaged

02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.880
i don't know how to make someone else figure i don't know it seems really i like press up on

02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:19.840
the d pad and i think the other person has to press up but we can cancel each other out by

02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:27.600
accident okay carrying strawnee with those on your back must be both distraction and motivating

02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:32.960
honestly i wish the jelly beans could have a little bbl i'd buy that cosmetic i don't care

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:36.400

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:45.680
oh there's only a few eliminations that that was like what six

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:58.880
wow person who pressed it forces the one who gets carried okay we're learning we're learning

02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:07.440
if we piggyback you you can whisper in our ears it's okay refling keep going you're doing so good

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:15.360
keep it up faster faster you're almost there keep going and just something bbl oh that was the

02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:22.560
question i reflin asked on um on marshmallow they were like you always say your butt is bigger you

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:28.560
got a bbl is it natural i'm like yeah it's natural it's complete luck because i'm small in height

02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:34.160
the the fat has to go somewhere and it picked my thighs and butt but i think because i ride a bike

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:41.920
as well it kind of shaped my like where my fat distribution goes and it resulted in like a good

02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:46.240
like uh butt hip ratio type thing

02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:53.040
