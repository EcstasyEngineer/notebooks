00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Oh, Reflame, it's time.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
It's that time again when all your tingles are belong to us.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Good morning, Little Reflame.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Good evening, Little Reflame.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Good afternoon, Little Reflame.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
A little fairy told me you've not been tingling recently.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, obviously, there's only one solution that's viable, huh?

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And that's to get a Scottish lass to tingle, yeah?

01:19.000 --> 01:36.000
So, I have my assortment of tools that's gonna help me try and tingle you. Does that sound like a deal?

01:49.000 --> 02:17.000
Are you still not tingling? You're a stubborn one, you know that, Reflame.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
But don't think that's the end of my arsenal, okay?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm only just getting started with you.

02:28.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh dear Reflame, thou art tingles, worry not, for I will be your consort.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
What?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Do you want me to say trigger words?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Are you susceptible to that Fiona?

03:16.000 --> 03:30.000
Purple, burglar, lar, purple, burglar, lar, purple, burglar, lar.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
That's what you wanted, to be honest.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I want to, yeah, I want to want to, yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, you're so tingling today by late when you're a challenge, okay?

03:57.000 --> 04:10.000
Is it weird when I like that in your eyes when I do this?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Do you like...

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Beauty is Mars, it's absolutely desperate to make you tingle.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, oh, oh, I'm running out of tingles, help.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Why?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Like, like, like a lollipop.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
I feel like my accent is weird, like it's like a lollipop.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
And we need to have no stream like this.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I mean, she...

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
When you want to tingle for me, don't you, Reflame?

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
You can feel that pleasure take over.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
I've not even dreamed you yet, I haven't conditioned you yet.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And you can't help, feel.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Feel sensitive to my teasing.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
You've done it before, you've been hypnotized by others.

05:38.000 --> 05:51.000
Good, because that means this cold fish can come right along and steal you for herself.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I do love a pre-trained Reflame.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, not this kind of hypnosis.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
What?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Oh, I pressed the wrong one, you didn't see that?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Come on.

06:21.000 --> 06:36.000
If you want a real hypnosis ASMR about making a deal,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
I will do hours of being under with me live,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
but you have to give me time to make you okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
What?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Is the microphone loud enough?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I think it is.

07:05.000 --> 07:23.000
Do hours of being under, or if you're difficult,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
do hours of reassurance that your ass is going under?

07:29.000 --> 07:40.000
Little Reflame, you need to rest, don't you?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So don't fade it.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I hate when you fade.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
You know I like when you're easy for me.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Don't you like it when you're my easy boy?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Are you squidding me right now?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Deal.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Oops, deal.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Thank you real good for today.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm Brian, for showing up with you.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Can you fit the microphone in the microwave earlier again?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
If the microwave meets my ass.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Okay, I have an iron glove in your cleaning tool.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm like picking on your little soap on here.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
It's just a fucking thing.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Brian jumpscare.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay, let me make sure that you're checked out,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
or at least we can go ahead.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
Easy brain, yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I like when you guys are easy brain,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
because physically I'm weaker and you're stronger,

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
but I want you to be easy, which is why I use hypnosis.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Did you not think it was suspicious

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
whenever I called the readings the R word?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
It's not happening consciously, don't know.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Hi.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Hi.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Hi.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Hi.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Come here, little replay.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Fall to the deep trust.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Fall and never look back.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
What are you drinking?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Is it not your ink?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I guess it must be honey tea instead then.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
My little replay.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Did you like the Thai ASMR?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I uploaded some Thai ASMR,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
and I had to take my clothes off at the start.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Oops.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Are you wanting me to say any trigger words?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Wait, I'm sure I know how to sign this up.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm a big girl.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
One second, I'm going to say up-trigger words.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
So you guys can anonymously ask me what to say, okay?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Damn.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Okay.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I would like...

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
...

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
That's not how you spell that word.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Okay, can someone send me something to taste that?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Okay, perish, okay.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
You can say trigger words and stuff.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
If you type one word, I assume that's a trigger word.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Someone says tentacle.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Tentacle.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Tentacle.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Tentacle.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Tentacle.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Tentacle.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Tentacle.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Tentacle.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Caramel.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Caramel.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Caramel.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
My dumb little replay.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh no.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I thought I turned that down.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm so sorry.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm so sorry I thought I fucking turned that down, Brian.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
God damn it, Brian.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Sorry, I turned it down.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Thank you, Anonymous.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Tingle us.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Tingle us off the dream.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Tingle us off the dream.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
Sorry, I will apologize with kisses.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Wins the cup.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
You like the word wins the cup?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Wins the cup.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Wins the cup.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Wins the cup.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
you wanna hug?

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
okay, instead of a hug I'll put you in between my thighs

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
enjoy

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
oh wait, did I do it right?

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
or does it sound different again?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
oh no, I can't see your ears

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
I can do this

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
put your hand between my thighs right now

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
put my hands are free

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
go go go

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
this is my weakness

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
all your dangles are belong to us

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
sh sh sh

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
wow

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
someone likes the trigger word

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000

18:19.360 --> 18:22.360
but yeah, i'm a good girl

18:23.360 --> 18:28.360
now you're gonna reward me for it, or are you just gonna stand there calling me a good girl?

18:28.360 --> 18:31.360
do something about it, reflin

18:31.360 --> 18:38.360

19:45.740 --> 19:51.000
it's just cause uuuhhh spending uuuuuhhhh

19:51.000 --> 20:07.000
If you're gonna call me a good girl, you better know what to do when you put me in subspace.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
If you're just gonna stand there looking like a fill of wiefling, just saying good girl

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
over and over again, then you don't deserve what comes after.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
In fact, you probably deserve punishment for such a deed towards me.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
So think next time.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
Think long and hard about what you wanna do to me.

20:33.000 --> 20:50.000
Someone wants fissi. Fissi isn't a good trigger word in my accent.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Fissi. Fissi.

20:56.000 --> 21:05.000
Tom Losloss, get fucked. Oh, I should get that commissioned.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
You just want kisses, okay?

21:25.000 --> 21:45.000
Okay, good girl, okay, good girl, okay, good girl.

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
Would you be able to put a vibranord right near the mic?

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
Uh, I think no.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
Someone wants Loch Nams. Or do you want the Scottish way where you just log?

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
What is Loch Nams?

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
Loch Nams.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Okay, I think that was the quote. Thank you, anonymous.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
Anonymous says, good girl, I'm starting to think you don't know what you did, Rieflin.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
Unironically, don't lose, lose.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
You're going nowhere with this buddy.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Mommy's ready and prepared for everything.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
So you might as well just sit down, like the good boy you are, and take it.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Do you understand?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Say yes, mommy.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Oh, it's one of those days, Rieflin.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Can't break me.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
Thank you for trying to give mommy your tip, but it didn't work.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, you're such a good boy, Rieflin.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Can you say, omelette de fromage?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Oui.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
Bonjour, je m'appelle Astronique Delce.

23:45.000 --> 24:08.000
J'ai joué au S-M-R, bienveillue, et j'ai emmené tout format pour un petit déjeuner.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
Of course, French Astronique can hurt you.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, earplug.

24:38.000 --> 24:51.000
Your French sounds very cute.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Ah, merci beaucoup.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
For some reason, my voice goes later when I speak French. It is a mystery.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Je suis mignon, non.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Son est-ce que ça hoque toi?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I can spell on you.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
I welcome your French hypnotic call-fish overlord.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Can we have color-borne tapping? Of course, little Rieflin.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Let me get my tattoo. I don't know if you can hear.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
That's my color-borne.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
I don't know how easy it is to hear, though.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Mignon, mignoné, mignoné.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Merde.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Petit boueux français, désolé.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
With a cloud cover.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
A Rieflin cover.

26:38.000 --> 26:49.000
Oh, but for being a good girl, I bend you against the wall and give you kisses so curious in your eyes.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
Good Rieflin. That's how you gain dominance.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Hey.

27:23.000 --> 27:30.000
Oh, mommy and the latest audio which your head be facing, whatever head be facing away or towards,

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
so I implied that you're facing towards me when I stop talking.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
Mommy, can you say done with the high table?

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
Rieflin, my darling, my favorite child.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I have one thing to say to you.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Done with the high table.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Rieflin.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Rieflin.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
My smart and wise Rieflin.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Where's my little ear cleaner?

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Ecco. You like the word ecco.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Ecco, ecco, ecco.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Let me just clean the inside.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
I think I might have a better tail for cleaning that side of your ear, Rieflin.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Let me try.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That was my throat.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Rieflin.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
You like all good to me.

29:55.000 --> 30:10.000
Maybe please receive the intimate gift of ear from your lungs.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Oh, you want hot?

30:12.000 --> 30:24.000
Can you feel my hot breath against your rieflin?

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
Just imagine your mind and your business at your PC like you normally are.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
And you hear me walk in, but you don't think much of it because you're so distracted.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
And then just to make sure you know I'm there, I breathe my whole breath on your ear.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
And you giggle because you know it's me.

30:59.000 --> 31:09.000
And you feel my arms go onto your shoulders to try and relax you a little bit.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh, my briefings so dense.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
You need something to help relieve him.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
What could I possibly do?

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, baby boy.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
I'll let your mind do the rest, shall I?

31:52.000 --> 32:04.000
I need some time to bust a nutty rainbow.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
This one goes so deep.

32:11.000 --> 32:23.000
Trying to lure me into a false and insecure rieflin.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Don't you not want to fall?

32:28.000 --> 32:38.000
Don't you not want to see what fun and intense things I'll get up to with you?

32:39.000 --> 32:46.000
What are you so worried for? I mean, what's the worst I'm gonna do?

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
Steal your ink. You can just make more.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh, do you want a big hug?

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
Do you need a big hug?

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Got really close, I'll give you a big hug.

33:21.000 --> 33:29.000
Riefling. You're so trusting.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
It's the best part about you.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
But maybe it's not, well, the safest.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
There's bad people over there, real bad people.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
That want to do things to you.

33:53.000 --> 34:02.000
Me. I'll look after you under a few conditions.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
So why don't you keep looking?

34:11.000 --> 34:22.000
And maybe just maybe let yourself go a little.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Why don't I do the talking for the both of us just for now?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
You don't have to think.

34:33.000 --> 34:42.000
You may even think that it's quite nice, not to think.

34:44.000 --> 34:55.000
And then soon enough, Riefling, I'll break you completely and you'll love every second of it.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Wow.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Obey, Riefling, obey.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
You want some dice?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Slabbing ASMR.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
So these are my dice, they're up on the chair right now.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
That's my dice, scratchy scratchy.

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
This is where I put you when you misbehave, right in between my dice.

35:40.000 --> 35:58.000
Just focus on breathing and let mommy's voice invade your mind, that's right.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
A hug with no bra on what you want to hear in my heart.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
You're allowed to hear my heart.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Only if you think about syncing it together whilst we do something at the same time to each other.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
But the rules are you're not allowed to go faster than how fast I go.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
Don't worry, I'll make sure you lose first.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Sorry, I'm wearing a poncho.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Can you hear it, Riefling?

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
The scent of my heart.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Do you like it?

37:35.000 --> 37:45.000
That's my heartbeat for you.

37:46.000 --> 37:55.000
This is the closer I get to corrupting you, the more excited I get.

37:55.000 --> 38:12.000
I'll take over completely and you'll just accept that which is so sweet of you.

38:13.000 --> 38:30.000
I like the idea of you slowly pretending that you're going to try and resist, but you can.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
This cuttlefish is just too good.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
But that's okay, that made you lost to me.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Why did I get quicker?

38:49.000 --> 38:55.000
Because I get excited telling you what I'm gonna do to you.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Is that so bad?

38:58.000 --> 39:06.000
To enjoy corrupting you to the point you can't resist?

39:08.000 --> 39:22.000
This isn't even supposed to be hypnosis related and yeah, I just can't help but think about it and have it on my mind all the time.

39:26.000 --> 39:34.000
Yeah, you should forget to resist.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
Why not give in to the temptation?

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
I'm sure there's a little thought in the back of your mind right now.

39:48.000 --> 39:55.000
And it says, why not do as she says?

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
Why not listen to her?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
I know it may be weird.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Listen to her, what does she know?

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
She knows the pleasures of the flesh.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
You just have to let me share it with you.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
That's all.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
So why not let me share it?

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
Let me be in control until you want to do the thing to say.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Why not?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
What's the harm, Evelyn?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Let me in.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
Let me in.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah, you said break you.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Am I going to do that?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Sorry that was my film in the chair.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
I'm going to break you over time of course.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
You see, right now you have all the options in the world.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You can do what you want frankly.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I'm not going to stop you.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I might even encourage you because it means you're degenerate.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
But imagine you could only do it to me.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
You had to come to me for permission.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
You had to confess your sins in my marshmallows.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
You had to let me know how badly you wanted it.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
But you still had to hold back because it doesn't feel better.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It only feels good with me.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
That's what breaking you is.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
And it's a slow process.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
It happens over time.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
You can get me your type, right?

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Sin, I'll make the perfect audio.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
You'll forget your name.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
You'll forget your worth.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You'll forget your troubles.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
And you will have nothing.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
But pure, raw pleasure.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Because of me.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
You're welcome.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Briefly.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
That's also another fun thing.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
I can condition you to finish whatever I like as well.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
It would not be funny giving up that condition.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
I'm not going to let you down.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
I'm not going to let you down.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
It would be funny giving up that kind of control to someone else.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I could break you in.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Maybe get you used to a smell.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
A freeze.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Or just get used to me.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I'll be enough.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Maybe even right now.

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
I could crop you so much that this dream could be enough.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
A freeze.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
We already have a few.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
You see, Briefly.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I want to bring you to a freeze.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
And it goes.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Would you can't play?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Oh, Briefly.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Would you can't play Canada?

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I could have.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
But I need to train you on it first, of course.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
So I can't do it, just yeah.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
She's going to condition us to respond to that variable.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Damn, I'm not allowed to have a stomach out here.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Strudy, please, I'm 24 hours in.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Don't break my streak.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Your streak.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh, don't worry, Briefly.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm not going to break it.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I'm going to shatter it.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
You have permission right now.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
What are you waiting on?

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
Don't deny yourself these things.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Don't be silly.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Come on.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Give in.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Stop resisting.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
And enjoy yourself.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Isn't life about breaking the rules?

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Would you see it was against the rules right now?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Okay.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Wow, my stomach is making nice...

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Your...

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Okay, kill that time.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I am killing you all to...

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Hey, thanks, kill that.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Behave.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
I love your avatar stream.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
Someone's actually put something awesome in the questions.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
Like your reflexes are nice.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Leave my tummy alone.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
My tummy's hungry.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Because I've not eaten anything.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
They need to kill that.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Can't be all sprayed all, can it?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
And...

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You did this.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I did.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Your reaches made me laugh so much.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
I was wondering what games you play in your damn time.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't have any damn time.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
The games I play are all on stream,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
which is why I have such a good time on stream.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
You...

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Yes.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I hate you.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Your cuddles come here then.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Get down there and cuddle me.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
There, now we're cuddling, we could do better.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Sousa, she's talking so much about breaking us.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I wonder what it would take to break her.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
It's not her, and I can tell you that much.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
If I'm too nervous to go along,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
then you don't have to do it, little Rieble.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm teasing.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I'm just one big tease.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
One big tease.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
I want to give you kisses on your tummy.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Leave my tummy over this,

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
just because it's ruining the ASMR experience.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
It's ruining the ASMR...

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
You want to get me a mirror?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Right, you're done.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm sorry, I just pulled the mic.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Mommy is a glass canna.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Yeah.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
That's a very accurate description.

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
Can you feel me with the little orbs around your ear?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Wow.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
Doesn't it feel nice and cool?

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Are you enjoying the kill-down, are you?

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
It breaks the moment you feed me.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I'm not a dog.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I'm a pup, a yolk.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Don't eat me, I'm not kosher.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I don't know what kosher means, I'm sorry.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I see the word everywhere,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
but I don't know what it means.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Please be sure to get some food after this, I will.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
The tummy sense makes ASMR better.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It makes it much more realistic.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
My tummy always makes it nicer.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
I think the heat is about to go on, eeps.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
I want to feel your fangs sink into my neck.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
I have no idea what that sounded like to you guys,

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
but my teeth bit the mic and then they slipped off of it.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
Did I just close my teeth really lightly in the mic?

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Oopsies, sorry.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I'll bite my fingers instead.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That's my fingernail.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Oh my god, my stomach really is painless.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Sorry.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
Stop listening to my ASMR loud.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Oh, show the heat, come on.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Can you guys tell?

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Can you guys tell if the heat is on right now?

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
It's really hoarse.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
It's been more than 24 hours.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Why haven't you inked yet?

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
Me flaying you need to ink every 24 hours.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
You can hear it in the background.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Okay, hold on.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Hold on.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Hold on.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Hold on.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Hold on.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Hold on.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Hold on.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Electric hairs, you can hear in the background.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Okay, hold on.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
I'll make a turn.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I need to go turn the Grace's corner.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
I'm going especially realising the door.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Okay.

53:29.000 --> 53:59.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

53:59.000 --> 54:04.980
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

54:04.980 --> 54:16.900
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

54:16.900 --> 54:19.900
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

54:19.900 --> 54:25.040
okay okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, see you soon

54:25.040 --> 54:47.040
come on then, let's go inside the booth, that's right, close the door behind you, let's

54:47.040 --> 54:54.040
sit down in the chair, I'll just kind of lie you back, and I'll be right back.

54:54.040 --> 55:03.040
Now replay, I think you have to put the blindfold on then for what comes next, okay?

55:03.040 --> 55:11.040
So, put it on, yep, just like that, put the blindfold on.

55:11.040 --> 55:18.040
You know I'll look after you, right?

55:18.040 --> 55:28.040
Well, are you gonna tell me what you want, or are you gonna let me do whatever I want to you?

55:48.040 --> 56:06.040
Whatever I want, get it.

56:06.040 --> 56:14.040
You want more than a blindfold in the ASMR, but would I need to restrain?

56:14.040 --> 56:25.040
Yeah, would it be better if I had handcuffs?

56:25.040 --> 56:29.040
So you're really not allowed to go until I'm finished with you.

56:29.040 --> 56:40.040
You're not in here with me, oh wait, yeah, you're not in here with me, I'm in here with you.

56:40.040 --> 56:48.040
Sorry my feet keep moving on the chair, blindfolded for the tickle as well.

56:48.040 --> 57:09.040
Yeah, the tickle.

57:09.040 --> 57:15.040
Play with my words at the best of it.

57:15.040 --> 57:22.040
Nice low tapping.

57:22.040 --> 57:26.040
Fingers there, yeah.

57:26.040 --> 57:30.040
More stuffing.

57:30.040 --> 57:36.040
Hold on, you're tied down, Nifflin, can't you help again?

57:36.040 --> 57:51.040
Let me have a real good smell of you, I'll play with your ears.

57:51.040 --> 58:08.040
Nifflin, how interesting.

58:08.040 --> 58:18.040
I wouldn't say you stink, I think I can smell your pheromones.

58:18.040 --> 58:23.040
Are you feeling pent up?

58:23.040 --> 58:35.040
You know, the more diced austere when you have, the more I can smell you, like that.

58:35.040 --> 58:45.040
You can be honest and tell me what you need, or are you too shy to talk again?

58:45.040 --> 58:58.040
Just let me take the lead, alright?

58:58.040 --> 59:09.040
I mean like just a pair of gaggles or else we won't be able to hold back the nicest we make.

59:09.040 --> 59:13.040
I'm not gonna have to gag you, are you low, do you know what you're quiet?

59:13.040 --> 59:18.040
I'm not gonna have to put my hand over your mouth.

59:18.040 --> 59:33.040
Nifflin, don't run this, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so quiet.

59:33.040 --> 59:43.040
Don't make me unhappy, because that's when the gloves come off.

59:43.040 --> 01:00:02.040
And I'll do P.O.T. and you know I will, because I'm into it.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:13.040
I would say smaller, tiny, won't you like the way I say tiny?

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:24.040
You know in Scots we would say Tote, if it's extra wee.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:35.040
My body and mind this year, I like when you say such a sweet things to my people and you know, other girls may hear on,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:45.040
I think they want to hear compliments about their voice or compliments about how they look, you know what I want to hear.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:53.040
I'm already mind broken.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.040
I've got this weird thing when I tickle, when I hear someone count from 10, all day, yeah.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.040
That's interesting.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:16.040
Well, technically around 59 now.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:41.040
Just kisses the gagas, oh I like that idea.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:54.040
Be quiet, you're being too loud again.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:11.040
Like that.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:30.040
That would also work as well, you know, if I need to have, if I was trying to need to have the greatest voice, yeah.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:36.040
But I'd rather you say you're completely corrupted by a main character than anyone else, even though I've not done it yet.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:58.040
I've not even made the audios yet, the main corruptor like that.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Don't worry my shit.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:13.040
I know I squished your ears, I bet I squished your ears a little bit, just to try and disrupt.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:35.040
I think there's always that.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:04:00.040
You know, corruption doesn't have to be this crazy ass thing, it can be slow and easy to the point where you don't have to think.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.040
Doesn't that sound fun?

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:17.040
It's like the opposite of the birth will be so fast, so quick, you'll have no idea what happened.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:46.040
You'll just remember the look of ecstasy on my face when I got what I wanted and then I sent you away with a kiss.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:58.040
Hey, when will we get the chance to corrupt your woman with a mirror?

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.040
Can we get some good girls from the three women agenda?

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:26.040
I'm not really corrupted yet, but your ASMRs are the only ones I enjoy.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:41.040
You're getting close, just need to do the finishing touches, create a unique audio for ya, and then it's over.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:51.040
I already respond to being called a refling kid, maybe I should do some basic mental training right now.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:58.040
No, you don't have to type anything, just think it in your head.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:05.040
But when I say good refling, I'm praising you.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:20.040
When I say you're such a precious little refling and always making me happy, you're the refling, that's you, it's your name.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:47.040
And when I want to kiss my refling, it's you I'm kissing, because you're called refling.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:07:01.040
You're such a good refling and handsome refling, a corruptible refling.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:07.040
I'll go whisper a quick, please whisper.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:16.040
Wow, and on you're so strong and handsome and cool and intelligent for being shadow of the earth tree without summons.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:25.040
Good job, kid refling, I dig it.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.040
Well, off topic, I have an extremely monotone voice, how do I fix that?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:40.040
I have a monotone voice too, it's okay, some people just have monotone voices.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:50.040
I have a very depressed voice, you actually heard it in the streaming stream when I returned to the earth the other day.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:08:02.040
But yeah, my tummy is really trying to be the star of the show right now.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:08.040
I lost your lost refling that you lose.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:33.040
Refling, I'm only on 52, nice punishment refling, you have to go again.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:41.040
You want ties, I can put you in between the ties again.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.040
Alright, my wrist just cracked of ear at them.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.040
Okay, you're in between my thighs, kind of.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.040
Okay, this one, can you hear my ties?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.040
You want to hear my tummy?

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:21.040
If I let you hear my tummy, you have to pretend that I'm pregnant with you, deal?

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.040
What did I walk into?

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.040
You're currently being crushed in between my thighs.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:37.040
Thank you Apple in the box for this super chat.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.040
Manual breathing, I guess.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Manual inking.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.040
Okay, I'll refling.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040
Refling, what are you doing?

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:08.040
You're not supposed to be outside right now, but I'm going to have to hate you, but I don't have my bag with me.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:14.040
But you can't be called everypony you have you right now, they in a cold creature didn't be scared of you.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.040
So where can I put you?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.040
There's only one place I can put you.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.040
Oh, refling.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.040
You're about to go somewhere really warm.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.040
But you might hear some sense as well.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.040
Are you ready?

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Are you steady?

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.040
Oh gosh.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.040
Okay, tell me if this works.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:11:06.040
Are you in my tummy?

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.040
Are you in?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:22.040
Are you in? I can't tell.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.040
Do you hear my tummy?

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:33.040
What? AC?

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.040
Hi AC, it's snowberries.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:42.040
I'm just real playing that I have to get the reflings home, but I don't have a bag.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040
So they're inside me.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:50.040
Hi snowberries.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Are you snowberries? The reflings are inside me.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:03.040
Do you want to be inside me too, snowberries?

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.040
Okay, you are almost home, and then I can take you home.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:19.040
And then I'll give you a lecture about what about refling you a bit, okay?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.040
Okay.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.040
Refling, you're not supposed to be called AC.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.040
Don't make me do that again.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.040
You almost made me finish with that.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:40.040
Won't you risk warm it inside me?

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.040
I'm quite free.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:53.040
I love with AC doing ASMR as well.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.040
Snowberries have your chance of turning it bigger.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:09.040
I get stronger.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.040
Don't get called AC.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040
You almost made me a very embarrassing position.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:26.040
You're lucky I could hate you when I hit you.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:33.040
Did you hear any tummy sounds whilst you were in there?

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.040
No, it was more galore.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:52.040
Did you run another train on my dog or be honest?

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.040
I like that you treat AC well.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040
It's snowberry.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.040
And I really like it.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.040
I need to like, ear clean that way.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.040
I can't let all that anger go away.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:41.040
A little bit slowly, but nothing I can handle.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.040
I'm not listening to you.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040
I'm going to be a good refler.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.040
Oh, I'm listening.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:15:00.040
Wouldn't it be fun to be punished for twice as long as you mess up?

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.040
Oh, you felt punished by AC.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.040
Wishing calling you mean things.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.040
Having a hard-to-go remix mean things.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:18.040
But if I know they like it, then they're really naughty.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.040
And they need punishment.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.040
How would I punish a real one?

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:33.040
I always want to resort to beauty.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040
I think it's well-dubbed.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.040
Call those A's to your dad.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.040
Those G's AC go from the chocolate.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.040
Twice as long for messing up at the end.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
Yeah, she was mean.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.040
I'm rubbish at being mean.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:09.040
I think the reflux would put you enough to tell me what to say

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.040
if they wanted me to say mean things.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.040
Because it doesn't come to my head.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040
Like, the best I've got is like,

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.040
Ah, you're so pathetic.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.040
My pathetic little reflux.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.040
Trying to still hold on to any samples of control.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
You're so silly.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:37.040
Just give it up, okay?

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.040
I know there's no point in resisting.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:47.040
It's cute when you're perfectly reserved for them.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.040
Beauty with a puppy's head over his head.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.040
No goodbye kisses at the end of a stream.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.040
Oh, that seems mean though.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.040
What phone they call?

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.040
Well, 483.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.040
Oh wait, tell me.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040
Don't tell me.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.040
You're gonna run the ASMR.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:23.040
Feelings is, don't call me pathetic, just slap me.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040
Ah, you want me to slap me?

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
Yeah.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040
Open your mouth.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040
So pathetic.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040
So pathetic.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040
So pathetic.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040
So pathetic.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040
So pathetic.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040
So pathetic.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040
So pathetic.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040
So pathetic.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040
So pathetic.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040
So pathetic.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040
So pathetic.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.040
It was repeat so weak.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.040
Go on.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040
I tried.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040
I suck at that.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.040
So pathetic.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.040
Get it open.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.040
You're a lovely little cow,

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.040
but is there anything you've done just for this relevant?

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.040
I mean, if we go to a convention,

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.040
I do genuinely want to sit on your faces.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.040
I don't even get that I want to do it.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.040
Alright, that's three for three for the feeler girl span.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.040
Dogs on your arm at the back.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.040
Okay.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040
There's a leak.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.040
I need you to come clean up with your tongue.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.040
Right now.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
Come on.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040
Be a good reflin.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040
Do it.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040
For me.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040
My little reflin.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.040
Anything you want.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.040
Amstrad.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.040
She turned in the hand holding both ice.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.040
I have terrible news, but I'm no management.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.040
I didn't turn down shit.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.040
Little reflin.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040
Shhh.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.040
39.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.040
Oh my god, that gave me such a fright.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.040
Holy fuck.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040
Sorry.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.040
This place is so creepy.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040
My mistake.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040
Yum, yum.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.040
The printer would be out of ink by the time I'm done licking your paper tray.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.040
You guys are actually really creepy.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.040
Did you hear that?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.040
It was literally the freaking corner of the room.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.040
On it house, no, not after Amy's freaking thing.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.040
Amy's little shore where she was like, was that your bag?

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.040
I'm actually one of the youngest.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
Sorry, that was me at the bottom of the desk.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.040
Aww, reflin, are you under my desk right now?

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.040
Did you think I wouldn't notice you?

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.040
What you're trying to do?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
Per gay.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040
What?

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.040
It's the ghost people that you fight with all the time.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040
Our little baby seaweed.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.040
What?

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.040
Just say again, dollar, what?

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040
What does your message even mean?

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:47.040
Thank you doctor, look, Edgar, look, just say again, money, what does that mean?

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.040
Refling's bumping the wall.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.040
I'm under your desk right now.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.040
R.A.M.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.040
They're trying to keep quiet.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.040
You're refling your feelings.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.040
Okay, I had a minute or so to watch in your monetization stream.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.040
I want your feet pressed against my face so bad.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040
I can do that.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.040
I'd be one of them.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040
What?

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:54.040
Imagine I could corrupt you to the point that you only needed that as influence to finish your little inking.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:05.040
It's incredibly literal, just say again, just say money, again money, again dollar.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040
I'm too foreign for this.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.040
Refling under your desk quietly again.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040
They're feet, my feet pressed also.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:33.040
A little kill done for you, refling.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:44.040
You've still got another 35, the goal you've already done to me.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.040
You're costing me again.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040
It's not paying me, huh?

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.040
I wonder who do this because they all are costing for these crappy dishes.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040
I just, I just wipe on the chair.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.040
See, easy.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.040
I'm like, I'm low IQ, okay?

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.040
But that's in your armpit.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:32.040
Wait, I don't think that's gonna sound much different, but this is my armpit.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.040
I can like, look, I don't know if you can hear that.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
What do you hear?

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.040
You can hear my pulse in my armpit.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.040
Take a big sniff, refling.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.040
Are you inhaling?

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.040
Take a big inhale.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040
What?

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.040
Do you smell it?

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.040
Am I corrupting you with my scent?

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040
Good.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040
An example, please.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.040
I want you to stamp on my face on my tentacle with your bare feet.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.040
I think I can do it at the same time, because I'm really flexible with my legs.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.040
It smells like vomit.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.040
I came for a funny ASMR stage reveal.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.040
Stiff.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.040
Are you done?

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.040
Are you done?

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.040
You deserve some kisses out of that tentacle, but...

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.040
My tummy's making lots of noise, but...

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.040
maybe it wants you back inside, really.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040
Tsk.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.040
You want me to do a foot cam stream with stockings, refling?

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.040
That's a good suggestion. I like it.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.040
Maybe if I get a plushie of you,

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.040
I'll do a hand cam stream playing with you

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.040
and stepping on you.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040
And out the ASMR.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.040
You guys can't tell me. Oh, I put the reflings inside me.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.040
You see, the reflings keep escaping, okay?

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.040
But the problem is, they can't be spotted in public,

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.040
because people would be scared of them, and they may try to hurt the refling.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.040
So we end up getting into all these different shenanigans,

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.040
where I don't have a backpack with me.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.040
I don't have anywhere I can put the refling.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.040
But I'm starting to think he does it on purpose,

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:01.040
because I can only film inside.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.040
You got the second money?

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040
Yeah.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.040
It says C-E-C. Thank you.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.040
Thank you for the tip again.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040
Dr. Locke.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:25.040
So, please don't eat me. I taste like failure.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.040
You won't breathe.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040
You don't taste like failure.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.040
You taste like someone I could grow up to.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.040
I just finished the earlier Thai ASMR video.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040
Yeah, did you like it?

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040
I can crush you now if you like.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.040
Come here, refling.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:55.040
Despite crushing a punishment, or do you like it?

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.040
Be honest, do you like this?

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.040
Okay.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040
Okay.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040
Our refling says,

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.040
don't shower first eight days before done ASMR,

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.040
but that's disgusting.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.040
I hate that shower.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.040
I'm not having it.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.040
Okay.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.040
Okay.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.040
It's only a punishment if I'm basing towards you,

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.040
because I need...

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.040
Please don't crush us.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.040
Oh, don't crush us. You're so sexy.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.040
Well...

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040
Choo-choo-choo-choo.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:32.040
Can you feel me tickle you with this tiny brush?

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.040
It's smaller than the other one,

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.040
so I don't know how loud it is.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.040
I'll just tickle in here a little bit.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.040
I'm ready to go again.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.040
Get 28.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.040
Twenty-eight.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.040
Daily remainder of the drink.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.040
I'll get a drink.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.040
Where is this brush better,

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.040
because you can hear it.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.040
Wow, my stomach's going to run this day so far.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.040
What do you want, actually?

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.040
I don't think I need to put you back inside,

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.040
and you can sort it out.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.040
One, two, three.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.040
It's okay, a little freeway.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:49.040
I'll look after you,

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.040
and I'll grow up with you.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.040
And I'll make you brainless, and I'll make you...

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040
Doctor, like, thank you for the tip.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.040
You said again, so...

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040
Where's this window?

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.040
Wow, the stomach improved.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.040
You have to go now.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040
Thank you for hanging in place over here.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
You have to go.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.040
I need to get you all day so come and work.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.040
I guess my stomach just needs to build up something.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.040
If online, my replays had something to give me

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.040
to fill it with.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:53.040
Okay.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.040
You want to fill your eye?

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.040
There's a pop sound.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.040
Oh, it might be the cable shuffling on cause.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.040
Is there actually a pop sound?

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.040
I'm getting nervous.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.040
I'm getting chicky.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.040
I'm sent back to the Xbox days,

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.040
where everyone is like,

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.040
fucking, fill your mic out.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.040
Seaweed, or little seaweed.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.040
Seaweed, or little seaweed.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.040
I don't know.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.040
Not that it goes down by.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.040
Let me squeeze your ears a little, okay?

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.040
I need to apply some pressure elsewhere.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.040
So then you can really feel how good the tickle feels.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.040
And all your focus is on it with your sampler.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.040
Only when I moved, okay?

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.040
I might have been graying on the chair.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.040
Okay.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.040
Okay, my stomach is literally about to run out of the safe,

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.040
or I can't believe it.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.040
24 question mark, I think 24.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.040
You're making me do maths in real time just for you.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.040
That's terrible.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.040
If someone has been trained,

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.040
or you've been trained, or I've been trained,

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.040
and I'm starting to feel like I'm the one who's been trained,

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.040
it misses us.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.040
Do you want back in my stomach?

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.040
I will put you back in my stomach.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.040
I definitely need the larger and larger,

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.040
like a one shot like that.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.040
Okay, you're going back inside.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.040
Oh, you really need to stop coming outside with me.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.040
I'll tell you how many times you can't just come outside.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:48.040
What happens if my magpies want to carry you off?

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.040
Do you know who you are on this high start?

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040
You're so tiny on this high start.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.040
I'm sorry, my chair's so loud.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.040
Okay, are you in?

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.040
Are you in?

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.040
It's like mummy's reflex natural habitat.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.040
Go ahead.

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.040
Is it making funny noises?

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.040
It's like we've been wiggling voice a minute.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.040
Okay.

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.040
Let's bring you for pregnancy ASMR.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.040
You're going to be in the exact same location,

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.040
so you can get used to the scent.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.040
Wow, you need to burp a little.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.040
Oh, it's nice and pretty in here.

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.040
I didn't know I had five children.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040
And many really.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.040
Okay.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.040
Sorry about being so creaky lately.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.040
I've been very distracted.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040
It's a partner to me.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.040
Are you wiggling as my chair?

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.040
You're so silly lately.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:46.040
I'm trying to make the cake a funny move again.

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040
It's so loud.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.040
And no one's like my chair.

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.040
It's going far too many.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040
Is she be streaming?

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.040
That's good.

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.040
What is she streaming?

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.040
It's a bubble thing game.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.040
It just started as my mom.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.040
Always watch she be.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.040
You watched my Thai smile of thank you.

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.040
Don't clap.

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.040
The chair's done its best.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.040
All things considered.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.040
I will buy that chair from Place of Imdaging.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.040
Oh, she's coming on into her whipsies.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:59.040
I'll see if I can redirect to another ASMRist when we're done in 19.

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.040
But if no one else I know is doing ASMR then we'll end it there, okay?

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040
Yeah.

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.040
Someone wants me to pet like a puppy.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.040
Don't be silly wiggling him in control.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.040
Nice try though.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.040
Maybe another time.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.040
Never thought I'd be jealous of a chair.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.040
If you like the idea of sway feet being on you all day long then, yeah.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.040
Just a little jealous.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.040
Okay.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040
I'm the one left behind.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.040
This one's so awesome.

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.040
You've done your best.

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.040
Sorry, I just said booba.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.040
Let me try again.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.040
You've done your best.

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.040
I'm proud of you.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.040
You've done your best.

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.040
I'm proud of you.

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.040
I know you're trying so...

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.040
Excuse me, someone.

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:56.040
I know you're trying so hard right now, okay?

01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:09.040
You're trying so, so hard to keep up, aren't you?

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.040
And sometimes it can be frustrating

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.040
trying to hold out that kind of stamina for so long.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040
But it's okay.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.040
I am

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.040
happy that Japanese still are sometimes in danger.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.040
I don't really have it.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:42.040
Four, six, seven,

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.040
question mark, 16.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.040
Nice, nice.

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.040
The breathing is for me.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040
Yeah.

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:58.040
You had a weird dream.

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.040
Oh, you're a good, real one.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:11.040
You are such a good, real one.

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.040
Keep going.

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.040
Keep it up.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.040
Almost there.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:27.040
You can make it to the end, right?

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.040
Yeah.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.040
And we can

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.040
make it to the top of the wall.

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.040
You'll make it.

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.040
You like when I click with my nail?

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.040
A little tapping.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.040
It's better if I tap you directly.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.040
I find that funny when your tummy makes a little noise.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.040
It's like there's a reason it has an escape job.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.040
Squirming around inside me, are you?

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.040
I'll try to focus on work here.

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.040
Wow.

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.040
Thank you for the tip.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.040
Talk to you at your own time.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040
For the memory.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.040
Yes, we're going to end the term in the stream.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.040
No.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.040
I've only gone for a few minutes left.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.040
I'll do me a big help.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:30.040
I'll see if I can redirect into anyone that's doing ASMR

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.040
but I don't think there's anyone else doing it.

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.040
Why is my PC taking off?

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.040
Relax.

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.040
Relax.

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.040
It's not that serious.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.040
Oh, it says I can redirect into sheepie's poop thingy.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.040
Okay, I'll just do that because I'd say ASMR.

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.040
Okay.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.040
I don't know why my PC just took off there.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.040
Literally, that thing's under my body concord.

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040
Can you relax?

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:06.040
I'm trying to ASMR.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.040
All of the office returning to its own place.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.040
Stop.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.040
I'm trying to be sexy for you and you're making me laugh.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.040
Stop making.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.040
Okay.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.040
Yes, I can redirect into sheepie's videos.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.040
I'm going to do that because it's ASMR.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040
It's pre-recorded.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.040
Click in the search box.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.040
The box was the kick the nail from Drive.

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:40.040
Stop.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.040
Don't run.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.040
I've been so well in the stream.

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.040
I've been so well.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.040
Right, focus.

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.040
You have only got 12 minutes left.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:01.040
Do you understand what I mean when I say 12 minutes replay?

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:34.040
You're trying to be normal, but I keep dragging out of you.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.040
It's not the only thing I'm taking out of your body.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:50.040
I think you need some more armpit time just to really break your head.

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.040
You ready?

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.040
One.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.040
I have no idea what you hear when you're in my armpit.

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.040
Other than the freaking room creaking.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.040
Please stop.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040
You're getting a good nail.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:26.040
Take a big deep breath.

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.040
You're going to remember the smell.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.040
And you're going to crave it every day.

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:45.040
Enjoy my pheromones.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040
They're going to haywire now.

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.040
Because it's ovulating time soon.

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.040
Yeah.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:02.040
Oh, you won't crush them between my thighs.

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:06.040
Only because you have 10 minutes left.

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.040
This one doesn't get crushed.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.040
It doesn't get crushed on my knee.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.040
What are you doing?

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.040
You're taking so well replay.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.040
Ovulation Nations, this one.

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:47.040
Should I do ASMR with you in the ovulation?

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:16.040
Can you feel my breath on you?

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.040
Keep up, you're almost there.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.040
You're almost done.

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.040
It's so good I wasn't in the last round, sorry.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:44.040
And it's so close to the end of the stream, isn't it?

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040
I'm like proper sun.

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.040
Can you feel me behind you?

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.040
As I sneak up on you?

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:28.040
Would you rather be in your chair?

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.040
Or would you rather be stuck

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.040
than when I sneak up on you?

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:35.040
Would you rather be in your chair?

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:37.040
Or would you rather be stuck

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:40.040
than when I sneak by your chair?

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.040
So good.

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.040
So good.

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.040
In the chair.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:36.040
I can take care of you in the chair.

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.040
Six minutes left.

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.040
And the stream's over.

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.040
Over.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.040
Cheer for lapses.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:05.040
Do you want me to sit on your lap and face you?

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:09.040
Like you're right in the eyes.

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.040
Obviously, I'd hypnotize you.

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.040
You're my big man, I nearly faint.

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.040
Can you show me what big man you are?

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:56.040
Five minutes left.

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.040
Oh dear.

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.040
Only five minutes.

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.040
What are we going to do with ourselves?

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.040
Should I be nasty and compliment you?

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.040
And say nice things?

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:14.040
Like thank you for playing with me

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.040
and for getting in trouble

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.040
by going outside when you're not supposed to.

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.040
So I have to hate you.

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.040
You're all wrinkly.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040
You're doing really well.

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.040
You are.

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.040
I promise.

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:40.040
I actually really like this stage

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.040
of corrupting you.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.040
Because you're listening in so well.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.040
And I've not even done anything to you

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:56.040
with permanent effects.

01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.040
And yet you're so obedient

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:03.040
when you listen to me.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.040
And everything I see

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.040
and play along with all my scenarios.

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:18.040
Four minutes.

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.040
I love when you're well-paid.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.040
I do think you can't be trained.

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.040
But that's okay.

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:35.040
I actually don't mind sharing.

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.040
As long as you think.

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.040
Then I'm happy.

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.040
Three minutes left.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.040
And I'll tell you when I'm about to go off-line.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.040
Okay?

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:12.040
I'll tell you when I'm about to go off-line.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.040
Just let it happen.

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.040
Don't say it.

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.040
Don't say it.

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.040
Just let it happen.

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040
One.

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.040
Two.

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.040
Minutes and then I have to go.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.040
But I hope you're having fun with me.

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:54.040
I had a lot of fun playing with you.

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:58.040
And we could do more like this in the future.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.040
Okay?

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:10.040
So make sure you come back or you can always come back.

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.040
Keep it up.

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:34.040
I need a break-off again.

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:43.040
One minute.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:53.040
I think you've always come on break-off.

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.040
Come back to my stage.

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.040
One minute.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.040
One minute.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.040
One minute.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:44.040
You're such a good boy, Zero.

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.040
Good reply.

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.040
Good boy.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:19.040
I'm very happy with how your training went today.

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.040
Now you get some after-care with Shibi.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.040
Deal?

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.040
Good reply.
