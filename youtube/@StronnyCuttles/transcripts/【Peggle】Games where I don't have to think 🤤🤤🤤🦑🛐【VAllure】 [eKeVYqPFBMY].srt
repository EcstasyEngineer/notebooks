1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Oh. Oh.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
Well, ugly morning, sunny for the good-w coups.

Yeah, fuck those. I'm making it.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,160
Yeah, I live in the parking lot, you know what I'm saying.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,580
Maybe it's just getting the content.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,440
Nope.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,420
Oh. A bird outside my window!

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,260
Well...

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,580
Good morning, good evening. Good afternoon. Let me make myself be because one of them games wrong. Oh

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
Not too big though. I'm just

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,320
What's going on with my spout

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,460
Spout I'm good. No, no, I'm tiny. What spout? No, no, I'm off the screen spout

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,260
You wind me up

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,500

Successfully been warned. Oh, hold on. I think Calvary

Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. Um, it's pig. It's time for a pig one

It's time for a pig one. Thank you mix the couple for the membership back to

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
Back to

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,620
What's that there was no ASMR video and no patreon update

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
Yeah, maybe

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,860
Oops, like I'm working on it tomorrow

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:02,500
I've finally finished handing off everything needed for the video game and I've come to the absolute terrible

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,140
Realization and bulls to up beyond belief but like hey, oh it is what it is

27
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,700
It's the first time I've ever taken on a project of that size and oh

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,180
Boy, have I learned from my mistakes? Oh, turns out I'm an idiot. Oh dear

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,780
I could have done a lot better, but that's the best I can do

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,500
With a little brainstem and the brain cells I had at the time

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,940
Then my brain is expanded. So if I ever do something like that again, at least I want horrifically butchered and

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,900
You're gonna load 2,000 hours into this one. I'm on my Harry plan won't go

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
Oh

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Remember that time that gentleman's wife died at our restaurants, but because he signed up for

35
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
Disney Plus

36
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,180
We know we said no to them. Oh my goodness

37
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,900
It's been a while all I'm saying is it's been a while

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
Did I sleep I did I took my drug I took my sleep medication

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,620
I was like fuck this. I can't be doing this to myself. Um

40
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,420
And I have terrible news for myself

41
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,500
For the next three days, I have to wake up at like a one o'clock in the morning

42
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,020
So I'm gonna have to drug off again

43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,180
After today's stream, but what I need to do is try and stay awake and not nap

44
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,340
But I had six hours, which is really good for me. I had a nap and then I had six hours. That's good

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,660
But whatever I drug up. I always have a freaking loaf of bread that gets stuck in me and I'm like leave me alone

46
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,300
My little druggy, I can't believe I'm falling for the squash freaking issues of

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,900
being

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,580
Addicted to stuff like what are the odds on as if I missed that

49
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,180
I

50
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,660
Turn this down a bit hold on me turn that down. This is more of a most be honest. This is just a that's who

51
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,020
It's like Sarah's good, but you need more. Oh, I need more already. I sure yeah, I need more

52
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,340
No magic ham and being mean to me. Why are you bullying me if you don't want to know

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,620
Can I like get it stuck in here on purpose? No, don't bounce out. I wanted it to like get stuck

54
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,140
And but yes today is just like a boring

55
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,540
that's who

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,220
Tape game I said, oh wait, I'm supposed to go for the orange. Sorry

57
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,740
Sorry

58
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,620
Look, I said it's the first thing in the movie nice to me, but I had such an amazing time on black box yesterday

59
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,420
I was watching a bit of myself. I could not stop singing. I kept coming out with more and we remixes every two things

60
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh

Well fuck this one up right there. Yeah, it's not on my side. Okay. I thought I might be but

70
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,220
No way that is perfectly going downwards. That's not even a thing in this game

71
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,380
That didn't hit the orange that's underneath

72
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Just say you hate me

73
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,020
Why yeah, and then go for the art no

Wait, don't go to it if I would you because I'm saying I don't know isn't would you sign a compliment or am I going mental?

92
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,820
Maybe it means a compliment in my head, but it's not

93
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,380
And now an expired Christmas cake walk

94
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,940
If you try it's only to a 24

95
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,700
I'm being so dumb. What does an expired Christmas cake mean again? Hold on a minute

96
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,860
Well, oh, she's coming. Oh, no, it's like saying old man, but isn't it good to be older as a man

97
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Am I going mental

98
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,660
My brain isn't quite walking up yet. I've got a cup of tea in here

99
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,820
Subscribed and not subscribe not subscribe 45% wait, what's 45% of the number of subscribers I've got now

103
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940

My audience is 95% male 3.2% female 1.2 user and user specified. I don't know

105
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:18,420
The most common age range is actually 25 to 34 years on my youtube channel. So

106
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Yeah

107
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,180
I don't wait. Hold on a minute. How can you guys tolerate all the shit that comes out of my mouth if you're older?

108
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,300
All I do is like just talk out my eyes

109
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Are you tired of it?

110
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:48,980
Real thank you chair for this super chat your own your proposed work job me. I can't believe it

111
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,980
Hmm

112
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:59,200
Nice, I'm in the demographic. Yeah, I'm still just under there ain't there yet. Nothing happens when you turn 30

113
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,380
I'm like 100% sure nothing happened. What's the version of a male hag feature burger for it?

114
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,740
Did I tell you I said she was a hug in her application form?

115
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,700
I can't remember how she said that I'm sure she wouldn't make me turn this because it wasn't like anything bad

116
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,300
It was like in this section for like

117
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Do you what do you want us to know about you?

118
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,180
I think she said something like I'll almost hag age, but don't let that put me

119
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,060
Put that off. Yeah. I'm like no. We're looking for you

120
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:39,260
I was so this is some insider knowledge. I had specifically been requested by the reeflings pre pre reeflings

121
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Hey, we want to have each of our right and I was like your wish is my fucking command. I assure you and

122
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,860
Oh, did you get the serotonin?

123
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,180
So it was really funny that I was we're put it in our application form because I was like you're literally what I want

124
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,740
You're literally what I want like I think

125
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,420
I honestly couldn't have go if triple

126
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,300
Well, wait, no, I was giving these voices. What would a bunny sound like?

127
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:20,220
If triple scores is active, you only need around eight four hundred pinballs on a shot to get a free ball

128
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,260
That's a lucky spin for you. It pays and pays and pay. Are you telling me to gamble?

129
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,140
That was terrible. I need to like all these blues away so I can hit the orange

130
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,060
There a no

131
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
virgins in a wizard

132
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,940
Wizard wait is wizard a slang term?

133
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Why would you don't want to be a wizard? It's a wizard and insult

134
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
You shall not

135
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,140
Interesting gaming we're talking about this is

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,980

143
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,940
That's awesome. I like that power knowledge wizard. You're a wizard. Sorry

144
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,900
Two boys left. No, can he be but I've messed up this one as well

145
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,240
If you reach 30 without the touchable women you unlock powerful magic

146
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,340
That's so good. What's it?

147
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
What would the magic be?

148
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,540
The ability to focus on bros before hoes exactly you're welcome

149
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,780
You're welcome. It's like me learning about

150
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
What is it sharp ears or something like that?

151
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Thank you. I was at nine years

152
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
There's your chance Johnny

153
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,500
Why do you think I say thank you for your cherry? They're no longer a wizard array

154
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,820
Me naming

155
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,980
Sharks don't have you mommy. You have to save the rooflings from getting magic

156
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,740
If it's bad magic sure fuck it

157
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,460
I grew up paying incision

158
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,420
Did you see what Amy tweeted out? I was absolutely he horn

159
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,480
Fucking saw the first sentence. I was like, I'm leaving viola. I'm like

160
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Panic panic panic

161
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,660
And then obviously I read the rest of it and I was like panic over panic over. This is hilarious. I'm laughing

I'm just trying to hit the green one. I cannae be that bad kind of right the green. Thank you a

189
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Fireball next turn

190
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
We're about to see what this is

191
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Mother

192
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,220
That was she well it was me cuz like I guess you can clear stuff. That's in your way to stuff

193
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,780
Okay, I was really lucky I was not paying attention to that watch too hot for you

194
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,260
hmm

195
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:56,060
Also, I've changed my schedule. You are in fact forced to be playing overwatch with me next week. No, I don't care

196
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,660
No, okay, I'm gonna play

197
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I'm gonna play

198
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,420
Zarya that's who I used to play. I don't know if they absolutely butchered her or not, but

199
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,980
That's where I used to play Zarya. I'm gonna play Juno obviously because she's new and

200
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,500
Overwatch literally everyone taking mental HP and that's said damage in that stream

201
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,340
Okay, we ran out of balls. That's okay. We're gonna give it another shot

202
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:39,340
And and then we have a left-for-dead stream snipe coming up so I'll be interested to see how that goes

203
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
They can come in annoying

204
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,860
And but I know me. I mean I get to touch you in game. Oh, it was a fireball. I

205
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,260
Was the pain attention. Sorry. I'm too busy up and I

206
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,740
Can't wait, but I can so painful now

207
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:03,900
Like I'll be that if it's killing your refluence to tank for me so I can play healer. I will play the tank. It's okay

208
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:14,580
Nice left-for-ditch will be my first stream snip. Yeah, you can come and help me survive dad's on me. I know there's zombies

209
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
other than that

210
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,940
My knowledge is a bit limited in the game

211
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,900
So it'll be interesting to see she be did play left-for-dead on stream

212
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,780
with other

213
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,580
V-tubers. Yeah. Oh, no

214
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,240
Oh, come on. Hit. No. Hit something orange. Just say you hate me

215
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,980
Well, I've got fireball so

216
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,060
Who did I go for like through I think just these two down here

217
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,140
And it was far too late. I need to wake up. Well, let's drink this tea

218
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,540
Thank you, Broly legend as well for tanking for me wink wink

219
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,340
Me check I'll like hypnotize it. Oh, you want to tank for me so bad

220
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,820
Oh, you want to play will you do versus mode lobby?

221
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,900
I have never played the game, but if that's what you want, you can get what you want. Do you just have to tell me?

222
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
That's not gonna hurt

223
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,860
That's gonna scuffle side of that

224
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Okay, I was like

225
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Mercy it overwatch me by the way

226
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,380
Overwatch players are in the same category as league players

227
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,540
They hate themselves and everybody else and nobody else plays their main like they do

228
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,780
Be nice. I like a good cheeky bit of mercy

229
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,620
I like no having to think and just hold the beam and beam go brrrr. How dare you bro?

230
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:02,740
How dare you to be lords for insulting me? Okay? I like Zarya. I like mercy. I like Moira

231
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,260
I

232
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Think I'm gonna like Juno cuz she can do the heel thing like Anna. I don't know if it's like oh

233
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,780
I think there's a healer called Larry

234
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,460
Oh

235
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,180
Wait, no, it's not Larry. It can't be L a r r y. There's no way it's Larry

236
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,780
I refuse. There's no way that there's a character called Larry in overwatch. I'm sorry. Please forgive me

237
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,380
I'm so sorry. Hey, I don't know. I don't know how our name is. Oh as if I just completely balls that one up

238
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Yeah, oh

239
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,460
Okay, thank you video game this blue is in my way, so I'm just gonna get rid of it. Oh

240
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,540
The game is feeling rather nice today. What's going on?

241
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,780
You know Larry. Yeah, just like me for real

242
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,100
That Larry literally mean you're Larry at over what?

243
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,220
Winston how's it hanging? Oh good. Well, you know, oh, oh I get

244
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,260
Winston oh my god, we're zooming. Okay. Let me actually drink this tea. I've said that for like the last 20 seconds

245
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,460
Oh my god, it's right before it's lukewarm, so it's actually good

246
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Mm-hmm

247
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,740
You begin to see the fearsome strength of the fireball. Do not let its power tempt you into the error of pride

248
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,580
The firm the flame serves only the virtuous. I don't know why it's turned into like an old lady

249
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
But go from

250
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
So what am I supposed to get the green

251
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,260
From here, I don't think it's gonna hit that's gonna be in the way

252
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
You're in the way you're in the way. Oh

253
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,480
Let's just go for the orange first then I'll see what to do about the shape don't do that again

254
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,940
Okay, okay, let me get up. Let me get up beautiful gorgeous

255
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,580
See who's Larry there's like a overwatch healer that begins with L. Oh

256
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
I should have waited for the damn thing. Sorry

257
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,780

Thought I had more

263
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
I

264
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:06,700
Larry, okay, so you know what I'm gonna say something controversial Larry wasn't wrong if her name is a larry

265
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,060
Larry was near on now. I'm no up as

266
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,380

Mommy supports a larry. I know this cuz I'm stuck in the game. I can't quit you can't quit

269
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:31,580
Who's that? I knew it the overwatch brain rot has already got to us reeflings. We're like we're infected. You know when like those like

270
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,900
Species of animals are like they're they're going against like a parasitic thing

271
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,580
We're we've all been infected by overwatch at one point. I don't care why no one's in and before I never touch overwatch in my life

272
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,620
All right, then give me your virginity

273
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,820
Like I don't know what to tell you. Of course, we're jumping on overwatch

274
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
me

275
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Right

276
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Into this fireball

277
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
I got infected

278
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
by a leak of

279
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
All games. Do you hate yourself?

280
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,900
You know what in solidarity was there I should maybe play like once I

281
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Don't know

282
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,940
I don't know if I can do it. Oh dies

283
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,140
You know, that's true love I love you so much

284
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,980
I want to play overwatch too again for you, but me think about that

285
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,060
Thank you peppermint for the extended membership real and true

286
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,140
Literally like oh, I will play this. Oh, we did it

287
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Oh

288
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,580
Should have gone to opera instead of

289
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,340
Doing my naughty naughty voiceline. No, don't do it. Don't play like okay now

290
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:04,980
Sorry, I think I'm sorry. I might be under one without one. I just I've seen gameplay of it and I'm just like all right

291
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,980
Be cautious

292
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,380
Even with the flame at your command victory will not come easy

293
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,820
You have seen strong men weep and failure be not like them

294
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,780
What's wrong with crying if you didn't get what you like? Wow this game aged terribly

295
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,180
Men aren't allowed to cry if they fail me

296
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
Open your mouth dragon. I'm burping in it

297
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,460
Okay, right. I've got a fireball of a double fireball

298
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,220
Don't mess this up too much. Right. We're gonna like cut through these

299
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:45,540
Okay, that's perfect, but of course these stalls right on top right and then I've got a second fireball

300
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
So we're gonna cut through these ones

301
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,420
Okay, there we go. There she lives

302
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,900
Shawnee isn't real over until she has a discord kitten on team support now aren't I'm gonna see something controversial

303
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,420
Aren't you my discord can if you're willing to play the game just for me and enable me in game I

304
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,780
Doesn't that not make you the discord kitten and I'm the discord predator

305
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Yeah, you like my deeper voice

306
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,220
Fuck she's right. I knew it. I knew I was right. Oh

307
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,620
No, I think I've messed up cuz I didn't break this one here. There's no way

308
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,740
Can I hit that can I hit that

309
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:54,620
We're dead I love games where I don't have to think about a single thing and I can't ramble

310
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Oh

311
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Your mastery greatly pleases me my students few are those who dare test themselves few

312
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Right, let's do fire

313
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,980
Even if I get like one I'll take it. So we're needing a fireball like all through this. This is terrible

314
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
I wait until it comes over

315
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,700
Say hello, isn't that not that a

316
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Elden ring game, but I'm on my own

317
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm not playing any game where I want my own. I'm scared

318
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:47,500
I did push Elden ring back because of time and I'm sad but there's three endurance streams in a row of Elden ring

319
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,860
I

320

00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,100
Could have been better could have been better right. I'm leaving these ones in here

480
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:34,220
I didn't get it. I didn't get oh, I got the bottom one though, and I got a free ball. Oh, I love ball

481
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,820
Thank you. Just a hit it boss

482
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:47,980
No, that's not what I'm oh, thank god. I was gonna say that's not what I meant. Oh, we did it. Thank you

483
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
You

484
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,540
The tea is officially room temperature surprise surprise after 40 minutes of yapping

485
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,300
In life, there are many choices. Some are better than others

486
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,060
Then ball achieves one miss with bagel and improves the shot you are going to pick

487
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Thank you. I'm shite. So

488
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,940
Wait, there's so many inside the center of this. How am I supposed to get in?

489
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,460
If it's other than by accident

490
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,420
Oh my god, that was so satisfying do it again

491
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:43,500
I creamed a little not gonna lie. That was actually really satisfying. Uh, can you do that again? Oh, it's a zen ball. Um

492
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,260
Are you able to like go for it over here and deal with these two?

493
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,260
Are we

494
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,340
Okay, I mean I got a free ball out of it

495
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,180
I don't know if I'm maybe just go for it. Oh

496
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Fuck off

497
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,820
Does it take into account the moving things as well?

498
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,860
I have no idea. Oh my god. There's like nothing. Maybe I should have done the outsides first

499
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,580
There's like nothing to bounce off of out here. Oh, that was a good one. Um

500
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,580
There's nothing. Yeah, like at least I'm bouncing off his stuff

501
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,020
So it's not exactly like I'm just fucking throwing it halfway across the map like that blue is in the way of all them oranges

502
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Hmm

503
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
No, I've no go at this

504
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:56,220
10 luck 20 skill 15 power of will 5 pleasure 50 pain 100 reason to remember the name

505
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,420
Okay, I fucked up. Uh, let's try again. Let's try again

506
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,660
Right you I'm avoiding the wisdom one

507
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,220
I want to do the outside ones first because they bounce against the the circle at least

508
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,300
And then like I'm hitting stuff accidentally by doing the outside ones

509
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,980
Let's see if this tactic pays off or if it's going to be sure

510
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,980
So

511
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,820
Zimbal OP

512
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,500
Does it give us

513
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,180
peace and tranquility? Can I get the orange one? No, right? I can't seem to get the orange one. So you

514
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,940
Pray in that you actually give me something I want but I feel like the game's just gonna

515
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,740
Oh, I did not mean to do it there. I should have done it in there

516
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
Unless

517
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
Unless

518
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
Oh my

519
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,900
Oh and I got the wee one over there too

520
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Right, let me get that one

521
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,980
And then I'll start tackling the circle

522
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Well, that was shite, um

523
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,780
And the blue one was in my waist because I wasn't paying attention. I think I just threw on ironically

524
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,660
All right, hold on. Can you guys think?

525
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Like no

526
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I

527
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,820
I'm I am very what is known as special needs. That's what's up

528
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,580
I've got two balls. Wait, hold on if I don't if I don't fuck this up

529
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
If I don't fuck this up

530
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:41,500
Okay, no, no, just let me go. I'm gonna run. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Ah, we did it. We did it

531
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,380
Uh

532
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,180
It was lurking but I thought you sounded nice trying to sing

533
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,420
Terrible you got 13 million points for

534
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:04,300
Zen balls work best when it has lots of options. You can open these options to zen ball by aiming for a peg

535
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,860
Or the corner

536
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Whoa, there's portals

537
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Now we're thinking with portals

538
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,180
What the fuck? Oh, it came out the honeycomb

539
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,900
Okay

540
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,820
I will try to keep that in mind. Oh, no, it's a zen ball

541
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,940
Oh, it's going it's going. Oh, she's off. She's off right go deal with the ones over here

542
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
I love a good correction shot

543
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,300
Oh, I just noticed there's a panel here. Ah

544
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,300
Ah, oh dear. That's not the best news

545
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,180
I've ever

546
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,940
Oh

547
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,940
Oh, look how there's a wee chicken in the background and there's a wee flying piggies

548
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,420
It's a pixie from viva pinata filled with fun

549
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Right, so that's everything on this side done

550
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:10,860
So what I need to do that as if no, I think that was the right shot for the orange. Let's try again

551
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,380
Oh, what the fuck wait, so what a little to the left

552
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,740
Okay, yes. Oh my god. We didn't won. Okay, great

553
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,020
It's running a big one. Hi

554
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,700
Piggies, what's the brainware message? I just I can't remember what it was

555
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,300
Oh, it was a mark

556
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:39,740
It was like did you skip over my marshmallow and I was like, I thought they didn't get caught in the filter

557
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:46,860
But they might have unless it was something like kind of wildly inappropriate maybe to say on youtube. I didn't say it

558
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,020
But from the message, I don't think it was something inappropriate

559
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,620
um

560
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,980
because I think

561
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,100
You'd understand like why I wouldn't say it in the moment if it was like

562
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,420
anyway

563
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,500
Time for a breeding frenzy although I'm prayer. I don't really

564
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
Not see it. We just

565
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,380
We be substituting words out here edge in that last shot exactly

566
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,780
See with them blue ones are in my way get my way. There we go

567
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,860
That should have hit that orange, but I'll love it

568
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,500
I never even noticed that okay that

569
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,860
I

570
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,820
Don't know

571
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,860
Okay, hold on hold on hold on do

572
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:56,140
Uh, I need rid of those these blue ones this cluster of blue

573
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay, let's go

574
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,700
Mine probably got felt I'm not good about I tried to avoid I hit on words

575
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:09,580
Yeah, I'll read out the once we finish because we just do a yapping. We'll do a yapping while we're

576
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,620
I love AI games where I don't have to think about it

577
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,860
Some stuff does get filtered. Yeah, I feel like hardly anything gets filtered

578
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,100
I've never had that comment before where I'm not ready to out and I'm like, oh

579
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:33,100
It it's made me question because I wasn't sure I wasn't sure

580
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,380
Oh

581
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:42,860
The true the power of zen balls to reveal your true potential every ball can be a zen ball

582
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,700
wait

583
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,260
Oh my god, but the owl is so right though for real for young

584
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,420
What uh

585
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,860
Very unique map. I'm not sure how I feel about this one

586
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,340
I feel like this is gonna be a bit more difficult than my usual tihi spam time

587
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,620
Uh, that's like a lot of blue as well

588
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,540
I'm gonna do the zen ball

589
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,020
I'm gonna shove it here and let the AI do the rest

590
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:27,500
That was the okay. Okay. Okay. No, not bad. Give him a shot. Give him a shot

591
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:35,020
Uh, I tested some stuff and found out that henlo often gets filtered and the message won't get

592
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,100
received. I don't know what this is

593
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:43,100
The filter just gives us new imagination on how to make mummy h word real and true though

594
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,820
Real and true

595
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,620
Even though they just move live it looks like they're spinning around like in a circle

596
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Uh, sure

597
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,140
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yes. Oh my god. Okay zen ball actual clutch though

598
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,500
actual factual clutch

599
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,940
Give me that 10 000

600
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,780
Um as for anything interesting

601
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,380
Emmy has a new short out ac has a new short out

602
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,540
The true test of a master master Bjorn unicorn

603
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:41,820
I scanned an avian. Well, then you have completed the bagel institute on the graduate program

604
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,140
with

605
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,060
Determination and player all that remains is the final exam

606
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:55,660
These levels will test your metal, but you may choose any master to help in your quest

607
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,860
I'm sure you'll do great after all you've here been taught by the beast

608
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
Wait the campaign's got more

609
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,820
Choose your character

610
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,780
Oh, no, who do we like the most you guys kept saying lucky rabbit

611
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,500
We're lucky rabbit we're lucky rabbit swoop

612
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,060
Hey, Bjorn

613
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,540
Bjorn from norwee. That's right. I was Bjorn here

614
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,660
You're making a mockery at Nordic I'm sorry

615
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:36,860
That's all I can say

616
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,820
You speak

617
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,860
Norwegian or just else can work. I mean

618
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,060
I love Norwegians

619
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,780
Hanging ding in Durgan

620
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,860
Wait, so me going and putting the accent on it's bad

621
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:01,020
But if a refland goes hanging ding in Durgan in chat, he just they get a spanking. What's going on here?

622
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,300
How am I getting a spanking when you're ten times worse than me?

623
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,060
Bjorn from norway norway

624
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Or nor clear clear the bother spray

625
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Beady beady beady beady

626
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,860
Oh for goodness sake, I'm doing scheisse

627
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,860
We've been making mock in italy's all week. I think a funny Nordic is having this

628
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,780
Hey, what is wrong with the Italian?

629
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,380
This is a shit use of magic hat, but whatever

630
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,300
Okay, this one's I'm not I don't think the rabbits a good one for this

631
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,620
Maybe the dragon for fireball just to cut through because this is

632
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,540
This is scheisse. This is scheisse on me

633
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,060
Do you be spiny?

634
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,060
Spinehounds

635
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:09,100
Eh, I think I have new shorts on the way as well. No, get them off. Give me the dragon. I'm gonna cut through this motherfucker's sign

636
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:18,060
It's okay mommy. I make a mockery of the language english then it's more strong. He's trying. Yeah, let the AI take over

637
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:25,180
Yeah is I admit it is last minute three. How was the optimum? Maybe like burning through to get the green again

638
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,900
As if I didn't ping up into the stratosphere and then like paying it through here

639
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,540
because these one

640
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,980
Oh, no, maybe these ones at the bottom here because that's like right at the bottom

641
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,580
Oh, as if that missed, right? I'm going to bed. That's ridiculous

642
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,020
Yes

643
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:51,260
Also, I use excited because it's soup day. It's finally time for me to make the soup and I'm so excited

644
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:58,460
So before anyone complains complaints. Well, actually you guys you genuinely never complain about my content

645
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,740
Which I find really surprising. I don't think I've had one fucking complaint a lot

646
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:07,180
Um, but it's soup day and I'm so excited. So I get to make soup

647
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,460
Uh, the chicken I've almost stripped it fully because I've been eating

648
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,620
Um, it's not so blacky. It's like a flat

649
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,860
bread

650
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,300
and then chicken

651
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,300
red onion lettuce

652
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,940
Sriracha and mayo and cheese. That's what I've been eating and like

653
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,300
I don't know

654
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,660
So obviously I'll order a lot of takeout because I can't be arsed after stream like cooking or

655
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
even ordering like a

656
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,700
The messages to come to the door like I can't be arsed with that

657
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,460
So I've been eating like tons of greasy food, but I'm not that greasy anymore

658
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,580
Like I used to be really greasy, but I'm not greasy. Like I had a shower

659
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,820
I feel I was like still feel super clean and everything and like I slept and all that

660
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,860
Um, Moomin was prepared to finish because she finished just quick. Oh, you're done. You're done a chicken and those

661
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,820
They got nanos on zealands

662
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,820
Oh, that actually wasn't even a bad attempt

663
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,820
Right try it on that. We'll give me one one

664
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:23,660
Greasy moment. Well, I'm not like greasy anymore. Like I used to finish a stream and I kid you not like the grease on my face

665
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:29,340
I was like for fuck's sake. What's going on here? Um, right zen shot. Just go for it. Do

666
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,540
Do I want to see

667
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:40,060
Destroy it from the inside out. Oh, that was gorgeous. That was love. That is absolutely lovely

668
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,380
That is gorgeous

669
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,700
gorgeous

670
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,860
Mummy's grease. I think we've finished the main campaign. So

671
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
What's that? My cane

672
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,620
Tomorrow is

673
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,420
Azur is

674
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:05,580
Beauty the trailer for her birthday went up. I don't know if it's serving ads or not because youtube was being a fanny

675
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,420
Hold on. I'm I'm literally going on Azur's youtube channel to see if it's serving ads or not

676
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,540
YouTube was being such a wee willy

677
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
No, that's a hard to serve

678
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Hey

679
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:29,420
Hey, she be seems a skincare type so she gave oh no, it's just because I'm a filthy fucking gamer

680
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:34,700
That's it. There's literally there is nothing that will motivate me to actually look after myself

681
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:41,260
In terms of like, oh skincare routine. Oh, this is the I could need you less of a fucking shite

682
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,740
I just could maybe ask the way up

683
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Um

684
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,500
So

685
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,620
It's really on me. It says no one can fix me. Okay. You can't fix me. I'm just lazy as fuck

686
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,060
Uh, literally just rot away and play video games. That's all I do. Ain't much right

687
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,780
I'm gonna have to get rid of these blues or I literally cannot shoot

688
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,380
Cannot shoot. I don't even know if that's gonna help

689
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,700
Drat

690
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Oh come on

691
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
Um

692
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,380
No, fuck you. What were you use the power of flower to light up 20%

693
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,540
No, what were jack caused the boss to quickly reappear at the top of the screen after falling off the bottom

694
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,540
Um

695
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,900
Let's give jack a lot of energy

696
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,140
Well, at least you have no pee balls, right?

697
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,620
Why are you wanting to drink them?

698
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,100
No, I do not have pee balls

699
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,300
I'm not that far gone yet. Although I did consider it at one point

700
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,140
But that was many years ago. That was many years ago

701
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,740
But I I don't have the appendages for it. I'm gonna be honest if I had the appendages for it

702
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,060
I'd probably go for it like uh, you know

703
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,020
It's a generous

704
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,460
I'd probably piss balls and poop socks the truth

705
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:15,180
I really hope poop socks isn't real, but I think it might be because people have made reference to it

706
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,940
Which makes me nervous. I'm getting I'm getting a little shaky. Okay. I'm getting scared

707
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,980
Oh look at that one

708
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:37,980
This might be forbidden knowledge, but I know a girl who keeps a device for doing that standing up

709
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,220
It worked in a bolt. Oh, I'm not sure I'd voluntarily do that

710
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,020
I just pee in the shower

711
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,340
Like whenever I go for a shower it just my brain is like mmm pee time and I'm like, okay pee time

712
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,540
I don't know why folk are like, oh my god, peeing in the shower is so gross. What are you on about?

713
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
seriously

714
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:06,620
Shitting and waffle stomping in the shower. Yeah, I draw a line too. Don't get me wrong, but piss fucking relax

715
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,020
Yes, okay speaking of piss. I'm pissing up my shots

716
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:19,900
Okay, okay, geez it all goes down the drain. Yeah, I don't really know the whole oh my god

717
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,980
Peeing in the sink. That's out of the question as well. I wouldn't pee in the sink. That's not

718
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,860
That's not ladylike. No, it's fucking me

719
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,060
That wouldn't be in the sink in general. I don't see why that would be

720
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,580
any

721
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,420
then

722
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,260
Not by a long shot

723
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
That's some screwed up play to a fun factor

724
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:46,060
I thought everybody peed in there. I don't know. I just remember folk arguing being like, oh my god, peeing in the shower is so gross

725
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,140
And it's like, who are you arguing with because it's not me

726
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,340
I'm pissing right now

727
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,860
You're not a sink pier. No, I don't know. I don't know why you would pee in the sink

728
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,780
right

729
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:02,300
Sebastian. No, that one was shite. What are you uses super advanced to light up nearby peg

730
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,780
I threw another ball into the mix

731
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,260
Oh, let's do jimmy leiden

732
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,460
It's better to pee in the sink than to sink in the pee

733
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,220
I have to admit. I agree with that word

734
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:32,220
Wise words of wisdom for from minicaric. Thank you for the super chat. That is wise. That is rather wise and not as stressful

735
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:39,900
Peeing in the shower makes it smell awful. Wait, how doesn't it all just go down the drain or am I going crazy?

736
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,620
Because I think you're crazy

737
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,700
Am I crazy? I don't know how it works

738
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:56,380
Oh, no way that second ball spawns on the one over there, right? I'm not playing this guy again

739
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:08,220
Are you ever seen the kevin bridges? Who took a shite in my kettle? I know that sounds absolutely bizarre

740
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,860
I promise I'm gonna force you to watch scottish humor

741
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,540
um

742
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:17,500
But there was this joke by kevin bridges and he was uh, and it like had the whole

743
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:24,860
Nation in an uproar because it was just hilarious like the whole nation was he hawing over this joke

744
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,300
But I must do a kevin bridges watch along. I even know if I can grab it actually

745
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,300
Might be a bit awkward to grab but we'll see we'll see

746
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,140
If not, I'll just

747
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,260
Hmm, I don't know how I would do it

748
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:47,260
All right, what is with these bonus ones? These aren't even easy. These are like ridiculously hard, right?

749
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,580
I'm not playing the hamster. You should go away

750
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Go away, right who?

751
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:59,020
Maybe fireball did I do fireball?

752
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,660
I don't know. I just I don't know

753
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,660
It is so difficult

754
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:19,740
Are they all right? No, you know feel well when I'm trying to hit as well. No get get the ais banking honestly

755
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:26,700
Right, let's get rid of that one and that one because that's like oh, maybe these four

756
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,260
Oh wait, I didn't have a I thought I had a fireball for some reason

757
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,940
Am I special?

758
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,940
Yes

759
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
And that's okay

760
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
Trust magic hat. Are you sure?

761
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,620
I will do bunny again because I'm losing hope. I'm losing copium right now

762
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,220
It doesn't even bounce like a regular ball

763
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,340
Also, did I tell you is there a randomly put CVT into the discord?

764
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,700
She thought it wasn't a real she thought it was a fake pee pee

765
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:15,740
And she put actual CVT in the discord and all of us were like what the fuck?

766
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
And it was hilarious like she

767
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:25,100
Azura has no idea how accidentally he'll like hilarious. She is so fucking funny

768
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,740
She is so funny. She was like wait, it's real and we're like

769
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,060
Azura you can see the squish on the freaking pentas

770
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:39,260
So it was it was that one where the guy has like a cardboard box over everything

771
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,220
and his wee

772
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:49,340
Egg and soldiers is hanging out and then it was I think it was either woman's barefoot just standing on it or

773
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,860
In heels, maybe it was the barefoot one. I think it's the barefoot one right trust in the magic ball apparently

774
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,180
um

775
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,900
and uh, all of us were like, uh

776
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:08,060
And she was just like, oh, I thought it was fake and I'm like never changes or I love you never change. That's hilarious

777
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,500
Hey, did you hear the guy screaming? I mean I can play it right now. Hold on

778
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:23,100
Hold on let's get it up. This is I don't know if you'll recognize it

779
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,860
Oh, it's in shoes

780
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,540
Okay, it's in shoes. That's what she said

781
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,380
Is it necessary?

782
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,180
Is that the stomping you have a stomping in shoes?

783
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,220
I don't know. I don't know how that could feel

784
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,340
Good am I going mental I'm saying that's bizarre

785
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,380
Mummy stop it life

786
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,820
Everybody likes cognitive behavioral therapy. It's great

787
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,260
It's good. Okay

788
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,260
frickin spooky balls

789
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:16,380
Get them spooky balls here. I never even did anything good. Oh, let's really just wrecked me

790
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:24,140
Hoi hoi, it's a guy not in pain. Thanks friend. But that's what I'm saying like isn't that agonizing?

791
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,660
Who what do you get over it? But then again

792
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:33,740
Who am I a judge? We're all here for a good time. Who am I a judge? Who am I a judge?

793
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:40,140
Uh, yeah, is there a had a new patreon upload which was makeup?

794
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:49,660
After you fight and she does like a fake attempt at sph time small people time, but the reality is

795
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,340
Your

796
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:56,060
This is so juicy and oh main break in that she can't take it anymore

797
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,060
She was trying to

798
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:07,420
Hardcore of masochism is not meant to feel good. It's meant to be so bad. We're good now. This ain't happening anymore

799
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:13,980
Bruh, I will give the lucky rabbit one more time, but I think we're actually stuck. I'm not even kidding. I think we're stuck

800
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,180
genuinely

801
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,180

Thank you the pretty lord now. Hold on a minute

808
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,860
Hmm, I'd be worried about not just me for the actual damage since there are several nerves and little veins

809
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:10,780
You have to focus on the ball getting to swing down the loops towards the center

810
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,740
Mmm

811
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660

Uh, where's my serotonin? Where is it? Where are they?

817
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,580

Give me my serotonin right Sebastian. I'm not doing you. What are you light up all nearby pegels?

821
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,660
I mean that clears out a lot okay

822
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:21,740
You need to ask for permission first it's straight up broken. I've not

823
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,260
Zoinked my zinger

824
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,140

827
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,020
Um

828
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,020
Yeah, like it's just back in broken

829
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,820
I'm too stressed. But as I said the video game's away. So I don't have to deal with that

830
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:49,260
Uh, the peaches club is lasting on my agenda and I honestly think that

831
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:53,420
I can focus on all me we tasks now

832
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,300

01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,780
Give me ma

01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,580
I even know how to do this right we can at least get that orange one there

837
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,740
Right, okay. Don't write me out yet. How about this far too high

838
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,180
Far too not low enough shit

839
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Right, how do I hit that one?

840
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,740
Have faith

841
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,020
Bing

842
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,820
What a oh no, I don't know. I don't know

843
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,100
No

844
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
So go lower

845
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:12,860
No, I did it again. Okay higher higher so it hits the blue

846
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,220
No

847
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,220
I'm actually special needs

848
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:33,020
What was that playing in that one right alien you seem your alien blast seems to be really freaking good

849
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,420
It's okay. You did good. Thank you for comforting me

850
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,180
The math ain't nothing. I'm done

851
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,380
I'm so freaking close

852
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,380
I'm gonna far

853
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,020
I'm gonna fart so hard right now

854
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,640
I'm farting. I'm tooting everywhere

855
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,100
Bro, what was that noise that was me being absolutely raging

856
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,100
I'm

857
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:19,020
I just want to win. I just want my tiddly winky serotonin. Is that too much to ask mr. AI?

858
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,980
Just give me my tiddly winks

859
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:26,140
And before the ai's like you're literally playing so bad. We can't rescue your shots

860
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:32,140
Look, I'd believe it. Honestly, I'd believe it wholeheartedly. I'd believe it. Oh, I got a free ball

861
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,660
Right

862
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,340
Oh, that was terrible

863
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:46,220
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. No, you should have hit the orange hit the orange. No, it doesn't

864
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:50,940
It doesn't hit the orange over there and the orange is behind frick him

865
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:58,300
That was actually really lucky. I'm like, I'm getting right. Surely this is a wall shot

866
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,980
Down a bit

867
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,700
Please

868
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:15,260
Yes, oh my god, this took me so long. Maybe the alien is who I need

869
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,420
Um

870
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:24,220
AI in this game the the game like AI takes over your shot

871
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,420
Finally inking right now. I'm inking so hard master state. Wait, what does that mean?

872
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,660
I don't know what that meant

873
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,980
Right, we're doing the alien

874
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Get out of here

875
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,780
Who are how are you supposed to be doing this in?

876
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,220
Let's do the blast

877
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,580
Let's do the blast since apparently that was wrong

878
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,420
Um, can I do that? Well, that was a terrible idea

879
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,380
Oh

880
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,140
I'm not liking the look of this. Yeah, I'm not liking the look of this. Yeah

881
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:13,100
I think you might have to write me out. I've only got five balls left already

882
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:22,220
I must stomp on them because what sorry that was a zero talking not me

883
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,940
Um

884
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,780
Right

885
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:38,860
Right, right. Um, I definitely don't think the alien's the one for this one

886
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:46,620
Maybe try like pachinko won't just go anywhere or is there tactic to pachinko? I don't know about

887
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:54,860
Yum, right not alien. Who should we go for dragon? Maybe to burn through entire sections

888
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,980
If I can even get it right well clearly I'm leaving a lot to get it because what was that?

889
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,740
We'll try dragon. Maybe we can get a cheeky burn through sections

890
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,100
I was hoping it would ride it a bit better rider

891
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:24,540
Just say you hate me it's easier than than being denied because what is this?

892
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,740
This is the worst

893
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,980
Who are you supposed to like literally who are you supposed to play as?

894
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,860
I'm gonna pass away

895
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:45,740
And on my gravestone. It'll be because uh Peggle didn't give me my missing serotonin. I can't believe that

896
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,860
Yes, I am blaming the game

897
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:53,100
No, I will not take responsibility for being a bad Peggle player

898
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,540
Can you go in there?

899
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,540
Stop skip!

900
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,540
Ah

901
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,540
I can't even have access to the greens

902
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,860
I can't even have access to the greens

903
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:10,220
I literally can't even hit my ultimate. I'm gonna have to play the dragon again and hope it comes to me

904
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:18,140
So just try and get the rose but the rose hate me the balls like going flying down. They're not like leaning against it

905
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,580
I didn't even got my but look give me a green you. Yes. Give me a green now

906
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:31,900
Right and then what we're going to do is burn the fuck through all of these go

907
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,620
Oh my god, I hate the bounce because it's not right. Oh wait if I just made this 10 times worse for myself

908
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,500
Mm-hmm, I think I've made this 10 times wrong

909
01:15:53,580 --> 01:16:00,220
One advantage of the dragon is dragon these knots. No, you're not maybe a little bit

910
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,180
Right gently no

911
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:12,700
I can't believe it dragons these nuts on my face. Thank you the baby

912
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,860
What's the other one? Oh, would you guys ever go to solcon with me?

913
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:27,500
Because I know I've spoken about the meet-up before and there's this convention called solcon

914
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,940
Oh

915
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,780
Solcon like me so God these nuts

916
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,540
Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here

917
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:53,500
I know I know I'm just so good like that my last ball right. I'm not playing dragon your shape for this

918
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:59,260
He girls are I ladies I ladies nuts on your face

919
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,940
Right who

920
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:10,220
Should I just fucking go to the sunflower? She likes how fuck you they are boom. Oh, no, she does it to the nearest five

921
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,820
Right me sunflower. I got a free ball

922
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,540
Oh

923
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,020
Oh my oh my

924
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,500
Okay, I don't know how I'm supposed to win this

925
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:47,100
I am too illiterate in the gaming to know what the game

926
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,900
Okay, that was satisfying though. I'll give you that

927
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,140
But I can't get that angle like on everything. I can't get it

928
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:01,420
I don't know who I'm supposed to be

929
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:08,060
Maybe would Bjorn tell me if I could like do a five six day off someone's toilet

930
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:14,700
Hmm that was a good start and show us the theory but try your first shot at the top of the row

931
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,860
No, you're just gonna have to remote hack into my content

932
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,660
Because this isn't working

933
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:28,780
I got lucky ball though. Oh, no, there's a blue in the way. Tee hee. Oh, well that was lucky

934
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:36,940
Well, I could have got another ball. Yeah, like I'm literally nothing I can do it's all in the way of each other

935
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,020
Bagel exactly

936
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:47,260
The main trick is to reflect them back and forth. It has to be from the boot. Right. I'm doing I will

937
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,580
Right if I do it top it norm

938
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,460
If I do it this way now will you go down there you go

939
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,460
Oh

940
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,620
Right, and then if I go this way it will all tail it to do something

941
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,580
No

942
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,580
What

943
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,420
No

944
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,940
You're tearing me apart bagel. Oh, hi reeflings

945
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,300
Oh, no, that's not the core was it

946
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,860
reeflings

947
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:37,180
I did not hit her. I did not hit her. Oh, hi reefling something like that. That's the best second. I've never seen the movie

948
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,100
I don't know how to get it in

949
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,740
Okay

950
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,460
I'm already a boss

951
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,420
Yeah, and I put my

952
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
On your job

953
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,060
late

954
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,940
I don't even know what the AI is going to suggest

955
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,820
Oh, yeah, it just gave me a last but I mean, oh, I'm

956
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,820
It

957
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:27,420
I'm not gonna make it I did not ink on her. I did not it's not true. It's bullshit. I did not oh, hi strong

958
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:34,700
What I love about the room is that all the pictures are spins what in the background?

959
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,220
Okay, this must be a reference I don't know

960
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:45,100
Oh my god, am I becoming Peter good real?

961
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,140
And I'm her my

962
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,900
I'm not making it when a guy she mass right. That's it. I'm

963
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,740
I'm opening up marshmallows

964
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,620
I can't handle this

965
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:05,980
I'm getting depressed playing freaking as to where if the balutro stream goes worse than this is over

966
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,380
Not even the soup will bring me back

967
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:12,140
Even though I'm actually really excited to play with it play with the soup

968
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:16,620
What the fuck no to produce the soup to make the soup to harvest the soup

969

To roast the vegetables to cut the vegetables. I'm gonna put my tavern music on in the background

970
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,940
Oh dear traveler

971
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,700
Balutro is also a thinking game. No because you guys tell me what to do

972
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,660
So I don't have to think

973
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:40,140
So that's such a strong star and I threw away I threw

974
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,980
No

975
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,860
Copium

976
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,140
Can I get you to hit that one off the wall?

977
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,140

979
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:08,780
I take it back. I love this game. We're gonna continue. Let's see what the next map is all about

980
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:14,860
Maybe the owl is the way to go the owl is the way to go. I repeat right

981
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:19,500
Let's analyze analyze the map. We've got a resource serve. We've got we put our

982
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,460
analyzing

983
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,220
10 shots

984
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,220
And that's it. Wait what?

985
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:32,140
Okay, so if we get in the flying saucer, it'll put us back up. I guess forgive us another chance

986
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:38,060
Right, let's get rid of all the oranges up here and then we'll deal with all the ones down the

987
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,140
Oh, wait, hold on a minute. Do I need to do the flying saucer ones first?

988
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,220
How am I even supposed to deal with that?

989
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,940
Oh

990
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,620
Mist all right, I'm just throwing sorry. I just felt like it. I felt like being quirky

991
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,700
Hashtag throwing for my chicken soup

992
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,940
Yeah, I was like research. I was like don't need to soak red lentils overnight

993
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,740
But I think it's a broth mix that you need to soak overnight

994
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,620
Oh, wait, I wasn't

995
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,620
I didn't realize I was at the end shot my bad

996
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,580
Um, right, so I need to put it in the

997
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:29,340
What I was trying to attempt just put it in the we

01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,180
Oh, wait, I need to shove it in here

999
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,820
When it drops over what I want it to go down

1000
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:48,220
Um, I'm not even sure how that came out so badly

1001
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,540
Right damn right you're giving me a free ball after that because what the fuck was that

1004
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:07,180
I'm gonna fart. I'm gonna do it

1005
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:16,300
Right, I've wasted a few shows. Let me let me just hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Don't write me. I'm just

1006
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,340
Let me entertain you for one

1007
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,580

I'm sorry you have to listen to my remixes of songs just close your eyes at this moment

1012
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,580
Just believe

1013
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:04,540
I'm closing so hard right now. All right, what do I need to do? Do I need to get that green? I feel like an

1014
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:10,860
If I get that green and then shove it through the portal do I win?

1015
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,820
Tie a mox tie a mox

1016
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,740
Well, that was a pitiful attempt. Oh, well, I got the green

1017
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:26,380
So flash up the green through the portal is it gonna know that I want to put it through the portal?

1018
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,940
Or do I need to take your

That was far too early

1025
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:11,900
I just need that green one to come and clutch instead of come in peace we come and clutch

1026
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,780
Right just do it let the ai take over

Okay, okay. I think the owl is the way to go

1032
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:42,540
I think the owl is the way to go because the ai is

1033
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:49,580
Unless maybe dragon fire. All right, the alien blast doesn't really seem to be it. Um

01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,420
Because you're all dehydrated

1065

Clearly you're all dehydrated. What's going on here?

1066
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,500

01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,620
That's maybe

1129
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:37,180
Something I'll update you on as I said if my soup goes well, all you're gonna hear me is I'm gonna have to mute if I eat

1130
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,620
Soup on stream though. There's no way people are gonna want to listen. Oh

1131
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,620
Oh

1132
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,260
I am Sebastian under the sea

1133
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,300
Ocean together

1134
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,300
Oh

1135
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:56,220
Uh, right. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll come oh

1136
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:00,700
Oh, right. Okay. Let's do that. Let's do this

1137
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:09,580
Soup is smart. No, there's no way I'm slurping. I do have uh audio of me drinking out of uh

1138
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:14,380
I'll say it was the dog bowl, but it was actually my my cat's bowl

1139
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:18,060
I gave it a good wash and then I was looking milk out of it for asmr

1140
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:25,500
But I have no idea if I can even put it on youtube because youtube is being really weird about asmr

1141
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,620
And I don't know what's going on

1142
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,100
Like they're being real

1143
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,500
Did that just no I couldn't have

1144
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,740
Oh, please

1145
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:44,860
Please baby. Give me one more

1146
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:53,420
Right I need to go earlier. Hold on. Let him go back

1147
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:56,220
And then

1148
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:59,980
Yes, okay. How did I hit the other one?

1149
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,740
Oh

1150
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,460
Oh

1151
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:13,820
That was far too late. That was far too late. Sorry. I keep covering my mouth so my model keeps falling asleep

1152
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:19,580
I'm a terrible pilot maker right you go away. Sebastian your time of shine

1153
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:24,060
All right, don't let me down. I won't thank you Sebastian

1154
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:32,300
Drinking milk my yes, I don't know if I can even put it on youtube because if I was literally lapping up I was like

1155
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:39,820
I'm like you can hear me like I'm actually doing it. It's not there ain't no fibrinos going on like I'm literally going

1156
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,940
We're getting talk so plasmosis for this one. Yeah, I was literally a milk drinker

1157
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:52,460
What do I do a milk drinker? Yes. Thank you for asking. I drink all the milk

1158
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,660
All right, let's see get that orange win

1159
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:00,300
I'm gonna spank my clothes tonight

1160
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,740
Thank you. Thank you clothes. Okay get away. Uh

1161
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,860
I don't even know how to hit that orange one over there

1162
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:11,100
I'm lich. Yeah, I was gonna say I'm lich. I have to waste

1163
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,260
So many to get this orange one

1164
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,220
What do you mean this game is hard?

1165
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:24,460
Someone said there's a game called peggle after dark and I'm like what the fuck is going on in after dark

1166
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:27,260
Do I need to know?

1167
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:29,820
Oh

1168
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:35,900
You're exciting boy. Yes. No

1169
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,740
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Sorry. I'm like sweating. I'm sweating right now

1170
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:50,380
I'm sweating. Can I get this to go over here somehow?

1171
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,060
Wait what

1172
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:03,580
Am I going mental? How did the physics even do that? Just more peggle, but the levels are the master's dreams

1173
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,300
Stroney pegle and after that. Well, literally that's what I thought when I heard I was like peggle after dark

1174
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,540
Uh

1175
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:18,780
Oh, I can okay. Okay. Hold on. No

1176
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,260
No

1177
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,420
No

1178
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:45,420
Right, okay one more time right. We'll try Sebastian again because that was on one. So let's just do that

1179
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,700
So no ball so no head rip

1180
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:56,860
Rip oh someone clicked me when I was like, I'm gonna do a aggressive scottish ASMR

1181
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,100
And everyone was like, yes, we want that and I'm like you want aggressive angry ASMR

1182
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:12,620
Sometimes in this game you get peggled or get pegged and I've been getting pegged for the past how long

1183
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:19,340
I have made zero progress. I've made zero progress

1184
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:23,740
Whoever designed the bonus levels. Yeah, mom's a whole

1185
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:30,860
Aggressive farting ASMR win. I did burpen actually

1186
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:34,380
I was looking at the reasons why like people have left the patreons

1187
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:40,140
Just to see like general feedback in that because sometimes people are a bit more brutally honest when

1188
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,860
It's like anonymous feedback

1189
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:46,860
On patreon and someone was like not uh, someone said no vor yet

1190
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:55,660
Someone said uh, no burp audio and I'm like, I did an entire 20 minute audio me burping and drinking and gulping sounds

1191
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,980
What do you mean? There's no burping

1192
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:04,460
Well, what what do you mean? There's no burping. There's a whole audio on it

1193
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,460
Wait, what were done other than horrific?

1194
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:12,060
How am I even doing that?

1195
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:18,700
Okay, let's go. Oh, okay. Got the blue. So scoop my way and I got the ball back

1196
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:23,660
Okay, so on the way back surely it's gonna hit something

1197
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:30,780
And it hit a blue again. I don't want blue. I want red add some wraps

1198
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,900
yeah

1199
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:38,380
Because obviously I want to make people as happy as they are and you know the content that they want

1200
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:43,740
That's why I think especially in the later months. Uh, I think all four scripts are going to be written together

1201
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,940
Uh, like we'll write it and you'll get exactly what you want because

1202
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,820
Um, you guys come up with better plots than I do half the time honestly. Um

1203
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,660
Although a sheebie

1204
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:01,100
Wants to write all of her october and I'm so excited for her but I had to break the bread news

1205
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:08,220
To her she was I don't I'm not gonna say what the plot was but she wanted to do a plot that wasn't necessarily

1206
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,980
allowed and I was like, I'm so sorry to break your heart, but it's not allowed

1207
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:17,820
Um, because she literally typed no and I'm like, I'm sorry. It's just the way it is

1208
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:25,820
If they break the news we are slaves to mastercard all hail our overlords at mastercard. We love you

1209
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,780
Hey, thank you for

1210
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,700
Oh, okay

1211
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,860
Like I'm gonna be honest. I don't have much faith. I'm sorry. I'm just

1212
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,260
Sorry

1213
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:45,820
Oh, yeah, just wrap it up. Oh, right. Okay. Try again. Try again. This one is so hard for no reason

1214
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:50,780
I don't even know if I could hit the other one. I'm gonna sneeze for a minute. Good morning. Oh

1215
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:56,540
Wow, the game really wants me to win. It's trying so hard to let me win

1216
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,020
I'm picking at the wrong time. Just

1217
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:03,820
Just let the a I take over seriously. Just take over right who

1218
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:07,660
Sebastian go to space. I don't need you

1219
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:14,220
Magic hat. I the reeflings are swearing by this freaking magic hat. So I'm doing magic hat

1220
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,860
The mastercard and visa branch aren't actually behind the whole we don't

1221
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:23,260
It turned out it was something like distributing things overseas

1222
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,500
I don't know. I find that hard to believe because they're all jumping on Epstein Island

1223
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:32,380
So is so is but how many can swear to see they're all jumping on Epstein Island. So what the fuck are they on about?

1224
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,340
Distribution

1225
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,820
Hello, I'm a consenting adult

1226
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,380
Uh, no bad ban. Okay

1227
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:51,740
Look, I'm sorry. You're probably right. I'm just I I feel so doubtful just because

1228
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:55,340
I'm I'm just a terrible doubter. Okay

1229
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:01,340
Like I'm allowed to be salty if it literally stops me from fucking writing the roleplays that I want

1230
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,740
Because let me just tell you

1231
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:09,340
My patreon would be fucking diabolical if I could write exactly what I want

1232
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:14,460
Absolutely diabolical. Emmys patreon would be fucking atrocious

1233
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:17,820
If I was at the helm of the scripts and she let me write what I wanted to write

1234
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:23,100
It would be fucking died. We'd be cancelled in like three seconds. Well, I don't care

1235
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:29,820
The magic hat itself is not that powerful. It's the belief in the hat that makes you win

1236
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,780
Well, maybe

1237
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,660
All right, okay, we're doing a talos. Let's win

1238
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:42,460
All right, just suck. I just suck admit it you suck

1239
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,820
And I'm gonna swallow so hard fascinating

1240
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:50,860
All I'm saying is

1241
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,980
I love the girls

1242
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:57,020
I love the way they're designed. They're that they're the best design

1243
01:43:57,980 --> 01:44:04,380
Hey, did you hear about be dairy a reefland sent me a message and they were like they might have beaten you on a design

1244
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,380
You wanted and I'm gonna cry so hard

1245
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:16,860
Uh, I really want everyone to be like I give up. I actually give up. I give up. I give up. I'm not thinking

1246
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,660
I'm not thinking. I'm not no stop. Let's stop it. I'm not thinking just

1247
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:27,420
Just put the ball in the bag. That's it. I'm putting supermarket simulator on actually I'm

1248
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:30,460
That's it. I'm going back. I'm going back to my real job

1249
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,260
I was sitting at chill on a gun remember that

1250
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,980
Right I will time and then I give up I will time and I'm just reading marshmallows

1251
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,620
I give up after this one if it doesn't work. I give up

1252
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:48,860
I

1253
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:54,540
Thought this was supposed to be an easy game the peggle championship dreams in the shower literally

1254
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:59,420
Who's spade ran this? What's the speed running record because I know for a fact I ain't getting it

1255
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:02,620
It's gonna be blinks all over again. No

1256
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:08,220
I'm just gonna accept that. We uh, we ain't playing peggle on the channel after this one because it's a different

1257
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,940
They didn't take your head

1258
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,620
um

1259
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:19,900
I'm sure whatever vial thing you come up with won't match the debauchery of marques. They saw julia. Wait, what?

1260
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,420
Do I want to take that up?

1261
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,860
Hold on. We're doing live research. Look. We're in the digital age ladies and gentlemen

1262
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,860
And by ladies and gentlemen, I mean the one percent lady

1263
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:39,260
Which is what I've typed in what you've said julia is a novel written by a published accompanying

1264
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:42,380
Uh

1265
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:44,380
He was imprisoned for it

1266
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:50,540
He invited prostitutes to his little house and subjected them to a

1267
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,420
Okay, well, that's enough for that for today

1268
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,500
Uh

1269
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,060
He wasn't a very nice man. Let's sum it up to uh

1270
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:00,060
And

1271
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:08,300
He was imprisoned when the catholics ruled brandy else. His name is literally where we get the term sadism for

1272
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,700
Monka

1273
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:16,220
Right, what what I need to I need to hit this orange one so I need to get rid of that blue one

1274
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,180
Um, yes. Oh, yes, age me harder

1275
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:26,780
Yes, okay. Well

1276
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:31,420
I don't really want that if I'm being honest

1277
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,660
I don't

1278
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:38,620
I mean

1279
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:42,220
Oh, if it could have got that one, maybe we were in for the rankings, but

1280
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:48,220
I'm more likely in for a shank and thank you. I'll be here all week. Uh, that doesn't even make any sense

1281
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,460
Oh

1282
01:46:56,540 --> 01:47:00,780
Have you heard of that meme where you're supposed to expel all the air and then try and scream

1283

1284
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,900

And then I can force myself to be a part of the family and then you can write me in the will

01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:04,220
And then I can start the veal or empire where we take down the high table

01:52:54,380 --> 01:53:00,620
Yeah, you're lurking. Have you have you dared to post or are you just lurking in the shadows? Are you scared?

01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:03,980
Are you scared you're gonna spell the spaghetti in front of me?

01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,540
And you're still shy of me

1369
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,980
You're still shy of me and you hear me

1370
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:24,620
You hear me day in day out and you hear the things that my brain comes up with and you're shy

1371
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,260
That's okay. You're allowed to be shy

1372
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:30,060
You don't have to talk if you don't want to do

1373
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,460

1374
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,700

01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:39,900
Surely you can put the lips of the bottle on your smaller secondary hole for pain, right?

01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:44,780
Uh, so that way it doesn't spell oh when I pee it goes all down my thighs and stuff

So I am not risking standing up and doing it like that

1378
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:53,500
I ain't risking it. I ain't look. I'm happy to go to the toilet when I need the toilet. Put it that way

If so, we might have a problem with that. However

1387
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:33,980
I have fantastic news in the bakery department

1388
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:41,020
This is for the brain wormlings. If you start a mario message with generic greetings like hello

1389
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:46,540
Hey, or hi, there's a chance it gets filtered for spam. It is rare, but keep that in mind if the message is important

1390
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:55,020
Hi, scrawny kind of a generic question, but since it's almost been four months, I ain't even reached the three month mark yet

1391
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,020
Are you shoving me of the door?

1392
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,780
Uh, so what's your favorite game to play at the moment?

1393
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:05,980
Now I'm really biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed that black ops one stream. That was really fun

1394
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:10,780
And she missed when chat tried to tell her reeflings. Maybe this is

1395
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:21,260
I'd say black ops was hella fun. Hold on. I'm gonna go down a trip

1396
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,980
I would say I'm really biased but the hypno stream

1397
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:31,340
I did not expect to get so many compliments over it and people being like, thank you for not taking the piss out of hypno content

1398
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,420
I was like, oh

1399
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:36,780
You love me. You love me. You're so nice to me

1400
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:43,340
I'm excited to see how the hypnosis stream goes tomorrow. No in two days time

1401
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,020
Um, I like black

1402

01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:03,580
So the 15k thai cam celebration that was fun to be so teasing, but I was so worried

1405
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:09,660
I was gonna get in trouble for it by uh, our overlord. I love brotherhood, but I can't wait to take another whack at it

1406
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:19,260

1412
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:37,660
I'm biased. I just like all my streams. I think it's because you're there

1413
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:42,460
I'm not allowed to say that. I think I just enjoy all streams because you're there

1414
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:46,060
sonic heroes

1415
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:48,860

01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,380
Okay

1439
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:30,460
As as much as I love to think that I'm strong and I'm safe and I'm this and I'm that

1440
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,540
I'm no going outside in the dark at 1 a.m

1441
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:35,660
The only time I've ever done that and the exception was for gimley

1442
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:41,340
I'm sure I'm talking about you when you jump the fence, which I'm still not forgiving you for

1443
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:42,940
And

1444
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,300
but yes

1445
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:47,980
Viva pinata was my first journey. She was it filled with fun

1446
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:50,860
Viva pinata

1447
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,100
Why not

1448
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:56,940
because I'm a weak a weak tiny girl and

1449
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:03,180
I have been taught not to go outside at dark and I'm gonna stick to it. I'm gonna stick to that advice

1450
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:05,340
um

1451
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:10,540
Yeah, gimley be a good girl. Please literally I love night walks. I would probably love them too

1452
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,620
I'm not gonna go outside. I'm too scared

1453
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,620
um

1454
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:19,820
After class the girl sends two guys after me and absolutely destroy them and toss them down a small grass hill

1455
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,940
But my supplements in my bag were ruined

1456
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:28,540
What are you dreaming about refling? Then I was in a weird brazil city. Oh my god come to brazil

1457
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:36,460
They walked across a crazy floating glass hundreds of platform things. Oh, that's like in china. There's like a glass platform bridge

1458
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:40,220
And then I got to the bottom woke up. No idea what any of that meant

1459
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:44,940
Anyway, I absolutely need to see your soup pick so I can praise your wife's skill

1460
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:51,020
I like how it just ends. Anyway, show me the soup. I'm gonna make this soup. I'm so excited

1461
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,660
Anyway, I'm proud of you trying to get healthy. Yes

1462
01:59:55,980 --> 02:00:01,660
Um, yes, I'm trying to be a lot better. I've been hydrating more. Um, I've not been eating takeaway

1463
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:03,980
I've been good girl and not been ordering

1464
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,900
um

1465
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,700
Unhinge mo you guys are having insane dreams

1466
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:18,060
I had a dream that someone handed me money in a red envelope and I was like, isn't this not what happens on that chinese tradition?

1467
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,260
Where a red envelope is given you with money in size?

1468
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:23,100
um

1469
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:26,540
I don't know what it meant because I was like as much as I joke that a

1470
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:30,860
my chinese auntie that runs the chinese but

1471
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:32,780

Hi, johnny

1482
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:25,500
Could you run through some pet names during one of your asmr streams? I have fantastic news for you

1483
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:31,180
When I am recalibrating your mind temporarily. I don't do permanent hypno stuff. I don't like it

1484
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:37,980
I don't like permanent stuff. It freaks me out. Um when I am attempting to recalibrate your name

1485
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:42,940
So you forget your current name and you become a wreathling. I am going to be doing lots of praise

1486
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:48,140
I'm going to be calling you my darling wreathling my perfect wreathling that this my that by death by death

1487
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:52,060
Um, so I hope you're ready for the pet names that come in that stream

1488
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:57,100
I'm definitely writing a lot into the script and I'm definitely going to extend the script

1489
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:05,180
But I did a lot of the original hypnosis stream off the top of my head and I'm really fecking worried

1490
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:12,380
That I'm going to run out and not know what to do because I kind of panic when I don't feel confident

1491
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,020
off my back guys

1492
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:17,260
No, don't don't pull your back out

02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:22,860
I was kidding when I said you guys were og sons. Hold on a minute. You are og sons. I'm on to you

1494
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:26,540

02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,500

1498
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:44,300
Ignore my last message about the roman girl. Please don't worry. I looked into it too and I was like shit

1499
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,620
It's a layer of romulus. I was like shit

1500
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:53,980
Shit, but we'll see we'll see wreathling. There's time. There's time wreathling. Please don't worry. We'll find out

1501
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:56,460
I really don't want to compete with a tight

1502
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:00,380
I say that as if I don't have a bunny girl, but I was different. She be was different, but I love she be

1503
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:09,020
My back my back do be hurting call us a good boy and rubber chest and pair here and then we can be puppies together

1504
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,260
I'm old but you're not old

1505
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:16,940
I don't think I don't think there he's old. Am I going mental? I don't know. Maybe it's because like

1506
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:19,740
um

1507
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:25,340
No, I just I just didn't see it as old. I feel like when guys are older like that's

1508
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:28,140
desirable

1509
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:30,140
So it's not a bad thing

1510
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:35,820
I'm not that old although. I am fast approaching the wrong side of 30

1511
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:41,420
No, like that's the stop it the bail. I don't talk about yourself like that. No, I thought it was like

1512
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,620
I thought it was good that a guy was older

1513
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:45,660
I don't know

1514
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:51,980
Maybe i'm being dumb and like because I did say that I was gonna put an ose on a dinosaur vtuber

1515
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:56,940
So don't take everything I say like literally I have very low IQ

1516
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:01,420
I have room temperature IQ I can admit it. So don't listen

1517
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:05,820
I've really enjoyed your use of vtuber assets in the tavern stream. You enjoyed them

1518
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:13,260
Yeah, oh g sons rejoice. I'm only 20 strong. He thinks I'm undesirable. No, I never said that. Oh my god

1519
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:17,180
I'm gonna fart in your mouth. I never said that. I just said being older isn't bad

1520
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:21,740
That doesn't mean I'm saying being younger is bad either

1521
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:24,460
Stop it. Open your mouth. I'm farting in it

1522
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:27,100
And inhale my methane gas

1523
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:30,700
Homemade made it myself. It's organic. I assure you

1524
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:34,060
Oh, can you taste the red onion I ate earlier?

1525
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:41,580
I have three streams open right now. Wait, I see is I see me and sheepsters still up

1526
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:46,380
Uh, Stranny, do you block people on marshmallow? You skipped mine yesterday after black ops?

1527
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:53,580
Well, we think because I'm reading yours. I've not blocked you. I've not I've I genuinely have not blocked one singular person from marshmallow

1528
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:58,620
I get no shit. No one brings any shit to my doorstep, which I'm obviously, you know, really happy about

1529
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:01,420
Um, I have not blocked a single person

1530
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:06,940
Um, and the brain worms are eating me alive. I might have said something to upset you. No, you don't upset me. Sorry

1531
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,020
I'm probably more on the head. Yes. I

1532
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:11,500
I don't want to be like, yes, you are in your own head

1533
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:14,380
But please don't overthink stuff with me like I promise you

1534
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:18,940
If we judged each other on our worst days, we would not be here right now and yet here we are

1535
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:22,940
So let's not judge each other on our worst days. I won't judge you. You won't judge me deal

1536
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:25,100

1544
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:57,260

1569
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:38,700
Naughty

1570
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:43,180
I went back to your hypnosis ASMR due to a rough weekend. It was a wonderful experience the second time

1571
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,380
It really felt like my attention was rocking as though I was on a boat

1572
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:48,540
I was actually laying down it

1573
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:53,500
It moving towards the guided visions of the sea and your glowing pearlescent eyes

1574
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:58,300
Yeah, and the increasing darkness of the ocean was a joy each time I've indulged

1575
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:02,860
I've come out of it full of optimism and energy like had a good night's sleep and I'm not sure why

1576
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:09,500
Since I'm new to the whole hypno thing and I'm normally extremely protective of my brain because of decision-making

1577
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:13,100
I don't know how often I can indulge keeping it in my back pocket though for extra hard times

1578
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:16,300
Oh god. Thank you for trusting me with it as well. Like

1579
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:20,380
I think you can definitely have like bad actors

1580
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:23,340
No, I like don't get me wrong

1581
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:26,060
You know if you like to indulge in it you do um

1582
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:30,380
I just I'm so worried about the safety side of it. I get really nervous to do it

1583
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:34,460
But uh, I I definitely have more confidence because of that stream

1584
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:38,140
So hopefully I can do it justice in the stream two days away as well

1585
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:42,220
Regardless, it's been great to support Mimi's and I appreciate it a lot. Thank you Johnny. Thank you

1586
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:47,420
And indulge like vealers first generation adult exactly

02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:57,180
I I wasn't even a joke that was just serious. That was just feedback. Good morning. It's Johnny. What color today if applicable? No color

1588
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:00,460
I ain't wearing nothing

1589

I don't know if Azura recognized it as the ass spread cake meme

1609
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,500
But oh my god

1610
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:42,940
Whoever did that, you know who you are and you're in trouble. That was foul

1611
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:49,900
I don't think Azura knows what that reference is. You are foul. You naughty boy. You naughty boy

1612

02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:59,020
Did she know did she say what she knew what it was or no

1614

The fun like I think she took a little like spread cake which makes sense to her

1616
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:13,500
But I don't think she's seen that original. I think she's innocent

I don't know who you are, but I will faint you and I will peg you

1618
