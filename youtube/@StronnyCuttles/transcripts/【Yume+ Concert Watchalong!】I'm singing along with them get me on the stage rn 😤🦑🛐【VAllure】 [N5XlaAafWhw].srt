00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,800
have blue i have so many questions for them that how long this took this is insane i know right

98
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,400
they should just like take the the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too

99
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
honestly that's a smart idea they should i think they will do and that seems

100
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,280
you think they will help so because it's really good they shouldn't just leave it here on the

101
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:49,440
stream no i want to i want full song covers let those hear your lungs this tiny jellyfish got

as zura is singing along wiggling my pen lights zura knows the words

104
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,440

105
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
damn

106
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440

376
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:03,760
that i'll do the rap part of the song i'll do the backup vocals that leaves azura and mercy

392
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:12,320
oh that's amazing what song is this original question mark is this a k-pop song is it k-pop

393
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:23,280
yeah what song is this i'm wondering it makes sense that they picked like a k-pop group

394
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,440
because they all have like girl singers of different parts it's a twice song it is a twice song

395
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,600
i feel like i would recognize it if it was a

396
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:39,760
twice song but i guess i'm a fake twice fan name this particular members grandmother's

397
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:52,320
maiden name right now oh i'm getting tingles this is awesome

398
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,600
oh my god

399
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,360

400
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,520
oh it's kda yeah it's kda i mean why did somebody say it was twice why are you lying

401
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,760
oh it's i'll show you by kda and twice okay my cat oh okay what are you doing

402
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,200
