1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Dancing if she says there's no audio in-game.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What goes up must come down.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let me do a live chat.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hold on, let me do a live chat.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wait, there we go.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It felt tough, but it wouldn't work.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Good morning!

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good evening, good afternoon.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm Strony Cuttles.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm supposed to be the hypnotist.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I've produced nothing hypnotist-wise, except that one live stream.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've only slept two fucking hours.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What a good song.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's a good song and that's a good show.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's not gonna stop me, okay?

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's not gonna stop me.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'd like to apologise to any bleeding hearts who may be lurking.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh my, what's this sayfile?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hmm, looks oddly familiar.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If I click start, is it gonna remember that I did...

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Did I do Sonic?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Does it remember?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh wow, it did.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I only slept two hours, cracks the can of cola for the fucking any ounce of the thingy.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can't believe this, remember?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Holy crap.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So we've actually done Team Rose and Team Sonic.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Never done Team Chaotic.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I've never done Dark, but we may actually have 100% sayfile, which I didn't expect.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we are playing Team Chaotic.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now I know it's really weird setup.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's like a big black gap in between me, but it's fine.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're just painting, don't you mind, painting.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But we're jumping straight into...

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's here, it's here.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We've got work.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's here, it's here.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've heard good things about you.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I would like to order your detective services.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, detective services.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
34 aspect ratio.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I actually have a layout that's 34.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't be silly.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We never turned down work that pays.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I've never actually completed these guys past the power point, power station map.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Could you just show the whole abstract?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You want me to be full body?

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I missed the first minute of stront is over.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh no, I started early.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
See.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So this is Team Chaotic.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll talk a little bit in the background.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hold on, how about I do my yapping?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I actually went back in the binding of Isaacs dream because it was so good.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I team stamped it myself so people can enjoy me.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Freaking playing the loss.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't believe I did that and I don't know for any of you who didn't watch the binding of Isaacs.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know why I'm frog blinking.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
I promise I'm not frog blinking in real life, okay?

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Frickin, I pulled the holy mantle card at the last possible second before delirium got me, okay?

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,600
Before delirium zapped my butt cheeks.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Um, you can literally hear me pull the card and then the crack on delirium.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I didn't, I didn't realize I did it because it went so, it went by so quick.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,960
Three whole timestamps there.

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Um, but yeah, I, oh my god, fantastic.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,080
I cannot believe that Binding of Isaac Run happened.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,880
I don't know what streamer luck I'm getting and Beltrow and Isaac and all of it.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,400
Such a gamer honestly, an accidental gamer.

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,880
Me like, should I break up Brimstone?

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,840
Just waiting for you guys to tell me what to do.

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,320
I was barely able to sleep after the excitement.

73
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,160
I genuinely couldn't even process, like I looked back on it and I'm like,

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,200
Stranny, Stranny for fuck's sake, you just, you just did delirium by accident.

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
Like when I was lucky enough to even get access to the delirium portal.

76
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,480
Um, I have my first Patreon audio upload this month.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,840
The next one is going to be coming out in two or three days.

78
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Bleeding Hearts, Azura's first one is going to come out after asleep.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,160
I'm so sorry for the delay.

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,920
There's a lot of shit happening behind the scenes, but there's a fantastic, um,

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,400
news that's going to be broken soon-ish.

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,600
I can't break it yet, but once it gets broken,

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,880
you'll understand like, oh, some stuff had to happen in the background.

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Oh, and, um, so yes, I am very excited about that.

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Sorry for the delay.

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,640
Get it, delay, because it's French and you say, doodly.

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,120
Yeah, that's right.

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
I named them after French stuff.

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,960
No, I'm not naming any other gen after them.

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,040
So I'm sorry, but Fond de la Buzum will never be recreated and you'll never get it back.

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,160
Um, huge news puns.

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,640
But then again, yes, the stream went all according to the script.

93
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,360
Well done, everybody.

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Stop it!

95
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,600
People are going to think this is pre-recorded reflames.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,600
Um, I have a, I accidentally slipped into another ASMR collab with someone.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm terrible.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
I've, I was going to announce,

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,800
I've finally caught up with all scripts with all my ASMR collab, collab partners.

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,920
And I, I fricking slipped and stumbled into another one.

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
I don't know how I keep happening.

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,960
Um, but, uh, I've got, I actually have collabs in August.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
I think with people outside of violour.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,120
Oh no, I have to be, I have to be social.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,720
I have to, I have to understand what people want and be nice and stuff.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,920
Yeah.

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,880
Oh, we started early.

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,760
Yes, I apologize.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,760
For any snowberries that might be lost,

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,080
I just realized there was no background in game audio.

111
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,000
Um, YouTube, please stop prompting me to insert ads.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
I'd appreciate it.

113
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
Speaking of YouTube and ads,

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,960
uh, all my streams are getting limited all of a sudden.

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,840
And I'm like, I don't think I'm saying anything that outrageous.

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,400
And I might be overly swearing because I do swear a lot.

117
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
Mm, I do mean, um,

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,000
mommy's normal now, honestly.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Be gentle with yourselves.

120
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,080
You've been top tier streaming for a while,

121
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,640
luncheon and top tier company, company.

122
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm personally helpful in lots.

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,680
You deserve all the praise and slack.

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,960
Oh, give me that slack.

125
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,160
Give me your slack refund.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,880
Oh, also me.

127
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
I wonder why I keep getting limited ads.

128
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:01,880
Hmm.

129
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,280
Curious.

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,360
Uh, curious, curious.

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
Is there some sort of correlation?

132
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,360
Hmm.

133
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,080
Who knows?

134
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,200
The Ys.

135
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,680
Good morning.

136
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,160
Good evening.

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
Good afternoon.

138
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm Stewanyi.

139
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,360
My voice is broken because I've overused it too much.

140
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
My dad actually made a comment.

141
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,440
He was like, your voice does not sound like your voice.

142
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,800
But on stream, it sounds actually relatively fine.

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,200
The microphone is covering how damaged my voice is.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,160
Um, I, yes, a Patreon audio came out.

145
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
It's helped me.

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,440
I mentioned this a little bit the other day

147
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,320
on how good my accent is for ignore popcorn.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,360
Um, I have, I have a very good voice for ignore slash free use.

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,720
And I've only just realized it.

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,280
And I'm like, maybe I should dip into it a bit more.

151
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Because like, I have a really, uh, just do what you want.

152
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Let me just keep playing Sonic Heroes.

153
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,440
Come on.

154
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I literally, it's terrible.

155
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,040
But I'm like, oh no, I have a really good voice for it.

156
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,800
Like, that's the thing I would have had to pick.

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,280
Because I've been struggling with my accent.

158
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,320
I feel quite, I feel quite self-conscious with my accent

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,000
when I'm recording that kind of stuff.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Because it sounds rather odd.

161
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm like, oh, a refline, were you then?

162
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,560
Oh, do you like how that feels?

163
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,800
Like, I'm struggling a wee bit.

164
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,040
But, you know, nothing we can't overcome together.

165
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,360
So I'm not going to try and get into my head too much.

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Because at the end of the day,

167
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
we're making Shakespeare out here.

168
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,160
We're making things to Shakespeare out here.

169
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
Me and the boys.

170
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,560
Um, quite unique, yes.

171
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,240
Um, so I actually thought my dad was here longer.

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,160
Um, than our original, I thought it was three weeks.

173
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,320
Unless the days have gone by so quick.

174
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,880
But he's actually getting shipped out in two weeks.

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
Technical is dead if Johnny doesn't join the audio though.

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
Your voice and accent are very cute.

177
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
I love it. Oh, thank you very much.

178
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,520
That's very kind.

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
The music is a bit loud, by the way.

180
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,760
What music?

181
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
You shouldn't hear anything right now.

182
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Everything should be muted.

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,640
It should be my voice and nothing more.

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Do you mean Sonic Heroes at the start when I was singing?

185
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,040
I meant, I'm inclined to believe you.

186
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,440
I am.

187
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,000
It's true.

188
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,400
I hear no music shipped out, bro.

189
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah, he's getting shipped.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,960
As a Scot, I'm happy to have more Scot audios.

191
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,920
That one bit him.

192
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,840
That one was bit him, Swerdy.

193
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,520
Thank you.

194
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Thank you.

195
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,600
Wait, why is that?

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,360
That is echoing.

197
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,760
Hold on.

198
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,560
What was the joke?

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,640
Take what joke I said.

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,360
Hold on.

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,640
What was the joke?

202
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,120
Go back.

203
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
It was schizophrenia.

204
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
I had another tab open.

205
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
It started playing music.

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,560
Oh dear.

207
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,000
The refunds are losing it.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Wait, what was the joke?

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,640
I forgot what I said.

210
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
The Shakespeare one.

211
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,680
You know, we're not out here to make Shakespeare.

212
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
We're just making stuff to shake your spirit.

213
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh, and it didn't play.

214
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:56,840
Okay.

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,280
It didn't play.

216
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait, why no?

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Why did you get?

218
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,240
I got stage fright.

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, there we go.

220
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Okay.

221
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
It's fine.

222
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,520
I got stage fright.

223
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,960
Are you okay, little guy?

224
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
Little stream deck.

225
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
Are you all right there?

226
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
He got shy.

227
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, poor guy.

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Oh, great.

229
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm like, come on.

230
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Where's my cue?

231
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,280
Okay.

232
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm going to slurp my tea,

233
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,160
and then we'll get into shanic heroes.

234
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,000
I've already lost the speed run.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,320
We're already 1 second, 0.98 miller or something.

236
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm a sleepy boy, sleepy baby,

237
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,640
but I'm going to have fun.

238
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
We're going to play Team Chaotic.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,560
I have never successfully as a child

240
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,920
played Team Chaotic.

241
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,640
The only team I played successfully

242
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,040
was Rose, Team Rose,

243
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,560
which is the easiest team.

244
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,400
Now Chaotic's a bit different.

245
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,440
They have the same map pool, etc.

246
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,520
However, they do little side funny missions

247
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,600
where you don't necessarily have to

248
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,040
reach the end of the lobby.

249
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
So we'll have a little...

250
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360
I never ended up playing most of the Sonic games.

251
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,080
Neither did I.

252
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Please don't worry.

253
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,320
This is literally the only...

254
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,040
I played this.

255
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
I played Sonic Unleashed,

256
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,440
but I got stuck as a child in Sonic Unleashed.

257
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't know how young I was,

258
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
but I was too young to comprehend

259
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
what I was supposed to do,

260
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,560
and I got stuck in the first 10 minutes

261
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,600
of Sonic Unleashed.

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
That's how young I was when I played it.

263
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
I don't even know what year it came out,

264
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,360
but I couldn't even figure out the freaking thing.

265
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,440
You never finish this game as a child.

266
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Apparently it's a secret ending if we're 100% it,

267
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,520
so we might return,

268
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,880
because I do have a save file.

269
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,400
I love Sonic Unleashed.

270
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,840
I beat it like 2 years ago.

271
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,200
Ah, Unleashed, Kino.

272
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,400
Wait, so you never saw the final level,

273
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
and it has the best OST ever?

274
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,640
In Sonic Heroes?

275
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,320
No, I've not.

276
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,560
The only one I played was the worst one

277
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,760
with all the loading screens.

278
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,120
I don't know what that...

279
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
I played Sonic 06.

280
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Small, strong, all we need.

281
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,360
Little, baby, small and so.

282
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
Yeah, you have to beat it all the teams.

283
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, okay.

284
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,800
Maybe we'll have a little visit back.

285
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,680
I can't vouch for it.

286
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Yeah, right now, but...

287
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,480
Hold on, let me slurp my tea again.

288
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
You got all the emeralds?

289
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
I purposely skip the keys.

290
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
I don't even pick them up.

291
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,640
I skip them,

292
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,720
because I don't want to do those bonus levels

293
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,400
with the freaking balloons.

294
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,320
They annoy me so much.

295
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,120
Oh, I think it was 2006.

296
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,920
Big nostalgia time.

297
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes, Imi from Yumi Plus

298
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,280
is also going on an absolute Sonic boonage.

299
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,560
So if you're a Sonic fan,

300
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,360
I kid you not,

301
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,000
type in ImiYumiPlus.

302
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,440
You're welcome.

303
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,320
That's all I'm saying.

304
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
Literally, out of the floodgates,

305
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,600
and she's obsessed with Shadow,

306
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,280
the hedgehog, bless her.

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,120
She fucking goes,

308
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,720
Coconuts for Shadow.

309
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,360
Hi, woman.

310
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
Hello, we playing.

311
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,920
Sorry for starting early.

312
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,280
I might have jump-scared somebody out.

313
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,720
Whoa, you're too early.

314
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,040
Look.

315
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,320
If I remember correctly,

316
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,960
when you get here,

317
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,120
you aren't allowed to get one hit,

318
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,920
or you perish.

319
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,400
She's totally not down bad

320
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,520
with Shadow for real, for real.

321
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Imi was so nice to me in the end.

322
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,960
So if you didn't know,

323
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,640
Imi is Ozzy.

324
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
And I was like,

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,040
please for the love of God,

326
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,240
tell me you're in my city.

327
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,320
I will literally do an off collab with you.

328
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,160
You'll be the first person I off collab with.

329
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,880
And she names the wrong bloody city.

330
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm like, bruv, it was a 50 fucking 50.

331
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
And she's in the wrong one.

332
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,680
She's in the wrong one.

333
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,040
It was a 50 50.

334
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,080
So I'm on the hunt

335
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
for a freaking

336
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,960
Melbourne

337
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
bloody

338
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,040
a streamer VTuber

339
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,240
that's comfortable with me.

340
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,560
Well, uncomfortable, you know,

341
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
lead tubers in general.

342
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Who is Imi?

343
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Imi is from Yumi Plus.

344
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,040
I collabed with her on Among Us,

345
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,880
and I framed her twice in a row.

346
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry about that.

347
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
I do apologize.

348
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,880
You were very easy to pick on

349
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,520
in my defense.

350
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,840
Hello, Momay reflinks.

351
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Good morning.

352
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,480
Did you miss the chow garden?

353
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,400
I never played that mini game.

354
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,760
You know, never lucky.

355
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,240
So I'm sure there's a Melbourneian VTuber

356
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,960
that's crazy enough

357
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,400
to let me come over to their house.

358
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,560
I'll get it.

359
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
I'll get there.

360
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,880
Don't you worry.

361
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,040
Imi is the plague doctor one with red and white.

362
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,880
And I basically gaslit everyone

363
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,560
into thinking it was her.

364
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,000
And she got so she got so taken aback

365
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
because no one's heard me.

366
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,160
No, no one's actually heard me

367
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
be aggressive or blamey.

368
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
Like I've always come.

369
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,400
I'm always chill.

370
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm always being chining.

371
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,000
That's all.

372
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,960
So I think everyone was like stunned

373
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
that I came out of the gates on Among Us

374
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,160
like it's her.

375
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,280
Here's the here.

376
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,240
It was the candlestick

377
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,920
in the the ball yard room.

378
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,480
Get her.

379
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,800
Okay.

380
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,120
And then we did because I got

381
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,880
a wave that twice in the same lobby

382
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,560
and then she be caught on

383
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,080
to what the deal was going.

384
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,560
So I had to start reversing it and stuff.

385
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
Angry Strony was scary but hot.

386
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,440
Well, I don't think anyone expected it.

387
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,800
And I think I took everyone off guard.

388
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
So everyone believed me

389
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
for like the first two rounds

390
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,000
and then everyone started to get

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,960
real sussy of me.

392
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,560
Mmm.

393
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
The Scottish Cutfish Reacher for Bean Camp.

394
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
Well, sometimes, okay.

395
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,480
But yeah, I think I took everyone off guard

396
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,120
by Among Us.

397
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,600
But I'm currently working on a four-man

398
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
collab with people outside of Vealur.

399
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,360
And I'm like, I have to be social.

400
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm so scared.

401
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,920
But at the same time, literally no one

402
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,360
has rejected me so far.

403
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,440
So I'm like, hi, I'm Strony.

404
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Do you want a collab?

405
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,840
Here's the time and date.

406
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,320
Show up.

407
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,440
I'll show up in an hour early.

408
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,760
Smile.

409
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,400
Like, people, the way Veach over Twitter

410
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
portray everyone being so shy

411
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
and scared to talk to each other,

412
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,920
it's actually stopping people

413
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,680
from just straight-up collabing.

414
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,960
You know, you don't have to know

415
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,200
absolutely everything about each other to collab.

416
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,040
I tell a crazy concept.

417
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,280
I know absolutely earth-shattering news.

418
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,920
But every time I've collabed with someone,

419
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
they're like, yeah, no one asks me anything.

420
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,440
And I'm like, oh, okay, well,

421
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,920
I'm glad I could break the curse,

422
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,240
because literally you just DM and be like,

423
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,960
hi, I'm Strony from Vealur when I hang out.

424
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,360
Smile.

425
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,200
Need more Vealur Umi Plus collabs?

426
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,400
Well, hold on to your hat, because August.

427
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,080
Unfortunately, I can't really do any collabs this month

428
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
because of Matt Dad situation.

429
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,120
But once he goes home,

430
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,880
I am then in a deficit of membership streams.

431
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,200
Please don't think I'm neglecting membership streams.

432
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,800
There's probably going to be like daily ones.

433
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,680
Strony, you have just tremendously metaphorical ballbags.

434
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,240
That's all.

435
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Oh, who goes there?

436
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,440
That's exactly how I get all of the juice.

437
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,120
Almost threw up there.

438
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,960
If that was lovely first thing in the morning,

439
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,760
let's not do that.

440
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,520
Tisker.

441
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,920
I also have a community post.

442
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,480
If you have any words you want me to say in an ASMR,

443
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
that's going to get recorded like first thing

444
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
when my dad gets shipped,

445
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
because when I get sad,

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,280
I'll just throw myself into work.

447
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,440
So don't be surprised when you see a bunch of ASMR

448
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,640
come out right at the end of the month.

449
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,280
A burpee ASMR.

450
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,880
I've already made a burpee ASMR.

451
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,000
It's on Patreon right now,

452
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,520
but I can't put on YouTube yet,

453
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,200
because I have a warning,

454
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,160
and I don't know if YouTube is going to give me a strike for it.

455
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,320
So I need to wait until the old strike is gone.

456
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,920
Anonymous.

457
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
Nine tenths.

458
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Why did you give me $30 for a burpee?

459
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,640
Thank you. $30 Anonymous?

460
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Nine out of 10.

461
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,160
How is that not...

462
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,480
Did it need more base for you, sir?

463
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,600
Sir, do you require more base with your burps?

464
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
Sure, anything for you.

465
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,560
All right.

466
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:07,800
Okay.

467
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,760
I'll finish my teeth.

468
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Okay.

469
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
There are dollars based.

470
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,440
Lol, restart my phone.

471
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,040
I immediately agreed to a 10 out of 10 bell

472
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,640
that you're going to wake up your dad for that one.

473
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,600
Lol.

474
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,440
A burp that transcends the mortal coil.

475
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,120
Mm. Okay.

476
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,640
Oh, I just remembered I was going to write a script for Sheebie,

477
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,440
and I didn't.

478
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Shit.

479
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,560
Is she ongoing?

480
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,240
Oh, I just remembered I was supposed to do that right now.

481
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,200
Okay, it's fine.

482
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,840
I have time.

483
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,760
I have time.

484
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
I will teach the girls how to make scripts at a later date.

485
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
For now, I will do it on their behalf.

486
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,320
I will teach them their way.

487
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay.

488
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,840
This is going to get loud.

489
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,080
Jumpscare warning for the game sound.

490
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,920
There we go.

491
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
Oh my god.

492
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,240
Wait, I can't control the camera.

493
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,840
Let's go.

494
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Script writing stream instead.

495
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
No, I can't seem to do it live anymore.

496
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,600
I don't know what's going on.

497
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,680
Look, it's a little hermit crab.

498
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,800
And we're to collect 10 hermit crabs.

499
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Um, no louder please.

500
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, I'm a bumblebee, so I pollinate the flower.

501
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,240
Sorry.

502
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,720
I saw.

503
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Oh, right.

504
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay.

505
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,480
It's first thing in the morning.

506
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Be nice to me.

507
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,040
You get the last one.

508
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,200
No.

509
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,840
I need a level up because so in Sonic Heroes,

510
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,040
you have your strength type, you have your flying type,

511
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,280
and you have your sneak for speed.

512
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,760
I am a bias towards the flying one because this game,

513
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,440
you can seriously like, oh my god, look at the hair of it as eyes.

514
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,320
That's terrible.

515
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,560
I love it more.

516
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,840
The pollination mentioned on a little.

517
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,520
What's that do a bubble?

518
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:39,800
Right.

519
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,760
We're not going for the key.

520
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,800
I've had enough key.

521
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,480
Why does Gator sound like Uncle Ruckus?

522
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,160
Who's Uncle Ruckus?

523
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,800
Am I being dumb?

524
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,280
Wow.

525
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,680
So we are literally our mission isn't to like kill all the robots,

526
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,240
get to the end.

527
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,120
It's to collect these little adorable hermit crabs.

528
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,080
Hey, so let's get to it.

529
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,360
Is the cook?

530
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,440
Oh god, I've forgotten what button the ultimate is.

531
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,520
It says press Z, but there's no Z.

532
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,840
I must be a bumper.

533
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,880
Surely it's a bumper.

534
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,200
There's a little army club.

535
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Hello.

536
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,440
I have no idea.

537
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh no, I can't be.

538
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,360
All right.

539
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,860
Okay.

540
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,320
Oh god, I love this game so much.

541
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,160
If you didn't know.

542
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,960
Wait, was there?

543
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
No, there wasn't a hermit crab on that one.

544
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,040
That's fine.

545
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,320
Um, probably right bumper.

546
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
Oh, not vector.

547
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,200
Oh wait, those are level ups.

548
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,440
Okay.

549
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,160
That's good.

550
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,360
Um, but yes, I apologize if this is just absolutely trash string

551
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,040
because I can't string a sentence together.

552
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
The truth is I didn't sleep.

553
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,560
I, so my dad took me to Bunnens.

554
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,080
So I've got a, I'm going to change the cats.

555
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
Oh, there's a wee hermit crab.

556
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,840
I need to change the cat litter box after this strum.

557
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Oh god, I go up.

558
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,520
What happens if I go up?

559
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,480
Is that up here?

560
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,320
There is there a hermit crab up here?

561
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,800
Be honest.

562
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,520
No, go and get the rest.

563
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,680
Hey, so yeah, if I'm quiet, please don't think it's big.

564
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
Are you okay game?

565
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,080
Okay.

566
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Please don't think it's because I'm like being a stinky streamer

567
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
and don't want to talk.

568
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,280
It's because I don't have, I didn't know you had a flamethrower.

569
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,600
It's because I'm dumb and I didn't sleep,

570
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,280
but I'm going to get loads of sleep very shortly.

571
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,840
So don't worry.

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,640
Run.

573
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Where's the strong stream?

574
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,640
How could it be trash?

575
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,600
You're too nice to me.

576
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, we have super fast speeds.

577
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,080
Wow.

578
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,560
Oh.

579
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,320
Oh, you didn't see that.

580
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
That is terrible.

581
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,000
You think I was being new to this game or something?

582
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,480
No, I'm no, I'm just rubbish.

583
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,840
Did you enjoy your steak dinner?

584
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,440
No, I didn't end up having it because my dad took me to a cafe

585
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
and I had like avocado and toast.

586
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,480
I know make it more Aussie kidney if I tried.

587
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,640
And then we ended up no having the steaks because both of us were full.

588
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,760
So we're having chicken instead because we marinated chicken.

589
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,880
Right.

590
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,720
Wait for the platforms to load.

591
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,840
Don't be silly.

592
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,080
Okay.

593
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,640
There we go.

594
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,120
Hold on.

595
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,640
Hold on.

596
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I need to wait for these platforms to load.

597
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay.

598
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,760
What did we do?

599
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,800
We didn't do anything.

600
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
Oh, there's a we fly there.

601
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,000
How is the world domination going?

602
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,960
Absolutely terrible.

603
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm supposed to be the hypnosis and I don't have one hypnosis freaking role play out.

604
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
But I promise, I promise I will cook.

605
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,440
Just let me cook.

606
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,680
Okay.

607
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
I just need some time.

608
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,120
I just need some time.

609
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,280
Bye.

610
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,680
Welcome.

611
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,480
And we.

612
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,440
No.

613
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,640
I thought we were a I thought the map had reset there.

614
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,440
Whoa.

615
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,080
Are you serious?

616
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,960
Oh, okay.

617
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,600
I thought that was bad news, but it's actually not that bad news.

618
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,560
Right.

619
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,360
We just need one more little hermit crab wherever they are.

620
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,520
Is there one under here?

621
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,360
There it is.

622
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,840
I can see it.

623
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,320
I can see it.

624
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,720
I saw it.

625
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,520
I saw a pixel.

626
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,520
It's here.

627
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
I see it.

628
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,200
Give me it.

629
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,400
We did it.

630
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,080
Yeah.

631
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,400
See it.

632
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
Mission one's already done.

633
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,720
Avocado on toast is an Aussie thing.

634
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,160
So there's been a stereotype.

635
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,080
Well, they say like that's why you folk can't afford a house is because they're eating avocado

636
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,960
toast and it's like rub.

637
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,320
Mummy likes her hypnosis role plays like her steak.

638
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,960
Well done.

639
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,120
Well, I actually have a four part series that's going on Twitter.

640
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm need to buy premium Twitter.

641
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,680
Elon's got me and bent over a barrel right now.

642
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Okay.

643
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,600
An E.

644
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,880
Stop fooling around.

645
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,320
I like the bumblebee's voice.

646
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,600
Stop fooling around.

647
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,720
Um,

648
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,920
it's a four part series.

649
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Yeah.

650
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,040
I was just going to.

651
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,160
So originally it was to go on Patreon, but it's against us.

652
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
So it's not going on Patreon.

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,240
Okay.

654
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,400
We need to rescue a chocoto.

655
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
Reeflings forced Johnny to eat a medium steak.

656
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,640
No, no.

657
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
Why?

658
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,400
Why not well done?

659
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,840
I didn't want, I didn't want it moving.

660
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,720
And I didn't want the thought of like little worms in it either.

661
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,040
So I said what I said, but if you cook it well done, the worms can't survive.

662
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
The we eggs can't survive in it.

663
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,120
If it's a contaminated.

664
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,640
I said what I said, I don't know why well done steak is so controversial.

665
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,120
I love when there's a risk of having worms in my steak.

666
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,600
No.

667
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Said no one ever.

668
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,680
No one wants that.

669
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay.

670
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,480
Our objective is just to get to the chocoto.

671
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,520
Chocoto?

672
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,880
Chocoto.

673
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,840
Chocoto.

674
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,400
At the end.

675
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,800
Oh my God.

676
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,120
Cream.

677
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,000
Speaking of cream, I cream up.

678
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
The no stop.

679
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,520
That's not funny.

680
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,800
How pink does she think medium is?

681
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,480
Well, it's still pink in that.

682
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,000
So that means it's fucking raw.

683
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,960
Okay.

684
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm starting to catch on to the game.

685
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,160
That like helps you level up if you look for the balloons.

686
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,600
Only took me how many places to finally get that point across.

687
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,720
Stunning.

688
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,280
I love the poses.

689
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,520
Starting wrong with some pink.

690
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I know that shit bubble gum pink.

691
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,640
Do you remember when that was fucking everywhere?

692
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
Oh my God.

693
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,840
I know that's bubble gum pink.

694
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,120
That's like, I know your knobs are different color than your skin.

695
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,760
What the fuck?

696
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
Because what would the equivalent for a guy be on that?

697
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,840
Steak doesn't have parasites, that's fish.

698
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,160
Yeah, you want my parasites?

699
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,400
Wait, I can't reach.

700
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh, I was gonna say I'm too tall.

701
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,520
Stunning.

702
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,240
That pink is my glove in.

703
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,800
Munkos.

704
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

705
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,760
I wasn't paying attention.

706
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,400
Hold on.

707
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm popping my...

708
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,360
Thank you.

709
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh my God.

710
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,800
I loved the little bumblebee's voice.

711
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,280
Sorry.

712
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,960
Is it because I can kinda mimic it?

713
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,200
In my head, I sound like the bumblebee when I do that,

714
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,880
but I bet you I sound nothing like it.

715
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,560
No, but I want to taste your fish regardless.

716
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,400
I don't think there's a mimic...

717
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,640
Well, I thought guys was a...

718
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,120
Oh, I just used my ultima.

719
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,240
And you're like...

720
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,120
Your skin, wink, wink, is like slightly different color?

721
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,480
Like it's darker than what your skin color is?

722
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Am I going crazy or is that not real?

723
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,680
Did I make that up?

724
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm like trying to be like...

725
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm like...

726
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,480
Okay, no, it's real.

727
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,200
Okay, it's real.

728
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,040
Okay, okay, okay.

729
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,400
No, that's true.

730
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,800
Slightly.

731
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,600
Huh, I never know if...

732
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
Yeah, it's darker.

733
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,800
Everyone unanimously getting their tentacle art right now

734
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
just to confirm or deny.

735
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,040
We're milling and milling and...

736
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,160
Okay, we're already in two missions.

737
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,240
We're already on Dr. Eggman.

738
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,160
It's darker because it's shrinkable.

739
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,760
Shony, you're the first person I've ever had in 20 players

740
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,200
two years of being an Islamic fantasy.

741
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
They like Charmy's voice.

742
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,120
Oh wait, the bee's called Charmy.

743
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,560
Bee, bee, bee, Charmy.

744
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,080
It's so cute.

745
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:49,880
Oh no, he didn't come down here.

746
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,280
Oops.

747
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,720
Oh, he did.

748
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,560
No, he didn't.

749
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,800
Please don't hit me.

750
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,280
Oopsies.

751
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
I thought he was supposed to slow down.

752
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,040
Now, I missed that one up.

753
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,560
Sorry, I went too far ahead.

754
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,320
I'm a silly bee.

755
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,560
A bumblebee for Gen 2 confirmed purely on the basis of the Sonic Hero character?

756
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:13,800
Yes.

757
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,600
And what are you going to do about it?

758
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:16,760
Huh?

759
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,560
Are you going to fart?

760
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,200
Are you going to cry?

761
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh, I'm getting smoked.

762
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,760
Hold on a minute.

763
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm getting smoked here.

764
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Hold on a minute.

765
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,400
Right, here we go.

766
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,840
Hey, here we go.

767
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,280
We camping.

768
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,840
Get him, boys.

769
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,320
Get him.

770
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,200
Do not move.

771
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,320
What are we doing?

772
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,800
No, no, no.

773
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Don't move.

774
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,920
I'm not done yet.

775
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm not done yet.

776
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,120
Hold on.

777
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,320
Oh, oh, he's spraying.

778
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,840
Don't be so rude.

779
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,240
Hold on.

780
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm not.

781
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,200
Hold on.

782
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Hold on.

783
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm too slow.

784
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,080
Yeah, I was going to say I'm too slow.

785
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
Oh, he throws a little ninja star.

786
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,880
I never even noticed that.

787
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,800
All right, hold on.

788
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Wait, come stop here so I can beat you up again.

789
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
No, I've done it again.

790
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,520
How did I keep doing that?

791
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,920
Draft.

792
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,640
I'm being a silly belly, clearly.

793
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,720
Oh, wait.

794
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,480
I can attack them while he's moving.

795
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,440
Hold on a minute.

796
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Hold on a minute.

797
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,960
We can do damage.

798
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
I repeat, we can do damage.

799
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Can I do this and they'll attack him for me?

800
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
Oh, what?

801
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't know this.

802
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,600
Wait, why am I such a silly belly?

803
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,960
What happens if I use my ultimate?

804
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,200
Can I use it now?

805
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
Can I use it right against him?

806
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm not.

807
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm going burst.

808
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,440
Did that work?

809
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,200
Did I block the game out?

810
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,520
Oh, okay.

811
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,280
Maybe don't use your ultimate against them.

812
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,440
I'm not sure it's going to make the game go funny.

813
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,880
So many things confirmed from Gen2.

814
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
It's going to be a big gen.

815
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,880
Bruh, I cannot wait until you guys actually see

816
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,240
what did get accepted.

817
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,160
I have been messing around with you guys

818
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,640
so much being like, this got accepted in Gen2.

819
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,200
This didn't.

820
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,920
This got denied.

821
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,200
But this got accepted.

822
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,640
Oh, I'll take this suggestion.

823
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,120
I'll do this.

824
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,320
I'll further develop that.

825
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,560
I cannot wait for you guys to be strong

826
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,160
and you absolute troll.

827
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,440
I've literally said no to stuff that isn't.

828
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,520
We have here waiting for the trailer.

829
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,320
Transformer in Gen2, you stinker.

830
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,040
Oh, come on.

831
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,000
You have to let me troll.

832
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,320
Let's go.

833
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,120
What's the mission?

834
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,960
Okay.

835
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,160
We're to destroy all the enemies in the safe.

836
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,800
We can do that.

837
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Oh, is there any other?

838
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,800
I can't control the camera at all.

839
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,440
So if there's an enemy behind me and I've missed it,

840
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,840
my bad.

841
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,080
Gonna be honest, chief.

842
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,640
It's my bad.

843
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,680
Here we go.

844
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I don't know how to tell if I've done all the enemies.

845
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
So we've got a number at least.

846
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Oh, I don't want bubble.

847
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
I want level up.

848
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,920
So we can...

849
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,520
Wait.

850
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,280
Oh, no.

851
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Are they going to go back up?

852
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,520
I need to use espion to get up there.

853
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,080
I think his name is espion.

854
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
Are those things going to come back up?

855
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:28,920
Okay.

856
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,240
They are.

857
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,440
They are very slowly.

858
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,480
They're coming back up.

859
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,280
Pfft.

860
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
We know you well enough that you're lying

861
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,520
and we let you get away with it.

862
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,000
It wasn't buggering thin fly transformation

863
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,640
thundershot.

864
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,800
Just doesn't do direct damage at 0 or 1.

865
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
They'll find enemies still take damage.

866
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,840
I don't know.

867
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,320
Okay.

868
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,760
One, two, three, four, five.

869
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,360
Okay.

870
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,840
Wah.

871
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,840
I don't like those tanks.

872
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,640
They scare me.

873
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:08,920
Wait.

874
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Does that count as destroying them?

875
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,880
That does not count.

876
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,240
It's just frozen the guys.

877
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,680
Oh, no.

878
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:14,920
Wait.

879
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,560
Hold on.

880
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Did the number just go up there?

881
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,560
Am I making that up?

882
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,480
I am pushing against the current as hard as I can.

883
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,680
I think I'm going to have to wait for them to fly back up.

884
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,000
Are they actually down there?

885
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,200
No.

886
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,320
They must have been destroyed.

887
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,880
There's no way.

888
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,280
If we messed up the game,

889
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,480
so this is where I got stuck as a child

890
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,240
and I've not gone any further than this.

891
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,240
Fly.

892
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,880
So it's fly.

893
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,120
Okay.

894
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,680
I'll fly.

895
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,320
I'll trust it.

896
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm going to level up the B fully just because.

897
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,840
Oh, there's two enemies here.

898
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,840
I just want to make sure I get them.

899
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,680
I don't want to like move on by accident.

900
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm stuck.

901
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,720
Oh God.

902
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm so bad at this.

903
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm so sorry.

904
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,680
It's because there's a pit.

905
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,000
If it wasn't Haram,

906
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,520
I would bet $100 that Gen 2 includes a slime or a horse girl.

907
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,320
Mm.

908
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,960
Is it because I've made such a deal

909
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,800
about like not liking slime girls?

910
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,440
I wonder if that's why I think that.

911
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
Is there anything in here?

912
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
No, there's a switch.

913
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,320
What does the switch do?

914
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Oh, it lets me access to the level up.

915
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,600
I'll take it.

916
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,680
Okay.

917
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,080
One, two, three, four.

918
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,360
31 out of 85.

919
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Wait, we've actually still got quite a bit

920
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:44,760
to go.

921
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,560
Is that a yes?

922
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
No, I'm not confirming anything.

923
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm just saying that I've been an absolute troll

924
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,760
and I've said yes to stuff that isn't happening

925
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,360
and I've said no to stuff that is happening.

926
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,480
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

927
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,000
I should have done that on SP1.

928
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,480
My bad.

929
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Ext interact.

930
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,560
Slime cinch.

931
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,600
Okay, hold on a minute.

932
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
I'm not sure how much I can actually

933
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,360
hide my real disdain for some of the suggestions.

934
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,400
We are going to have a carry on next week

935
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,560
and I'm going to draw your gen 2 suggestions

936
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,920
because I'm about to get all the concepts given,

937
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,680
which by...

938
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, they're falling from the sky.

939
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,760
Oh, yeah, from the sky.

940
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,560
Oh.

941
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Okay, don't, no, don't, don't attack.

942
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,360
I guess...

943
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
Wait, SP1 just...

944
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,520
He just turned it on his arse?

945
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,040
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

946
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,000
No, go back.

947
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
No, go back.

948
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,560
Go back right now.

949
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
I saw that.

950
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,120
What am I shooting at?

951
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,160
Wait, how do I get back up?

952
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,080
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

953
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,200
Let's...

954
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,520
No!

955
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,360
Ah.

956
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,680
Okay, hold on.

957
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,360
If I hover and then shoot, surely.

958
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,680
Yes.

959
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,520
One more.

960
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,840
M-m-more skills.

961
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,480
Level 3, honing attack.

962
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,280
Homing attack is the tornado.

963
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,600
Wow.

964
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,000
Is there an enemy down here?

965
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:29,960
No.

966
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,280
I'm just getting trolled, right?

967
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,080
Bumblebee time, sweet little bumblebee.

968
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,160
I know what you want to be.

969
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,160
I'm out of range.

970
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,520
Oh, man.

971
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm being super safe with the bumblebee.

972
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,640
I love him.

973
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,960
And it means I can do damage from...

974
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Oh, well, that looks like a hymn.

975
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,040
Oh, I almost missed it.

976
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,760
Oh, no, I didn't.

977
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,000
Right, so can you destroy the tank now?

978
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,080
He can do it on his own.

979
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,440
He doesn't need, like, health.

980
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,440
That's amazing.

981
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,120
All the girls will be muppified.

982
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,960
Toma keys, count your days.

983
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,520
Toma...

984
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,600
If you didn't see it, Toma keys did it to Zura.

985
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,680
I have never interacted with Toma keys,

986
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
but count your days, my girl.

987
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,560
I'm coming for you.

988
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,880
You muppify in my...

989
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,760
Do you know how much money I spent on Zura's design

990
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,920
in her model?

991
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
And you come along and muppify?

992
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,880
Oh, it's absolutely hilarious.

993
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,600
I love seeing it.

994
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,160
Tea bag in the crap out of it.

995
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,200
Please drop down.

996
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,840
Drop.

997
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,000
Drop.

998
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,200
Drop down.

999
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,760
There you go.

1000
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,520
Muppet strongy win.

1001
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,640
Toma, you better not.

1002
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,360
A muppet?

1003
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Why do I look like a muppet to you?

1004
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,880
Two seconds later, it's muppified.

1005
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,120
Right.

1006
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,760
It's telling me to use him to aim.

1007
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,080
Okay.

1008
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,960
So, no, that was X.

1009
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,440
I was wrong.

1010
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,240
What?

1011
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,680
Does that don't work?

1012
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,880
How does that shoot?

1013
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,400
Are you squidding me right now?

1014
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,680
I said I'm working.

1015
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,080
Tiny.

1016
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,520
Sorry, I'm late, strongy.

1017
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,280
How's it going so far?

1018
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
It's going good.

1019
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,680
We are playing...

1020
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,360
Don't apologize for being late.

1021
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200
I actually started 10 minutes early,

1022
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
which you're not supposed to do,

1023
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,800
but I did it because I'm such a naughty VTuber.

1024
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,760
We're playing Team Chaotic.

1025
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,200
We're doing ones that I'm not too familiar with.

1026
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,240
I've never won on him before on this team.

1027
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,320
But I'm trying my best,

1028
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
and that's the most important thing.

1029
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,840
But thank you for the tip, Tiny Spine.

1030
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,640
Muppet allure.

1031
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,200
Stop it.

1032
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,680
Stop saying such thing.

1033
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,360
Are you trying to upset me on purpose?

1034
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,600
Power is control of the canyon.

1035
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Ah!

1036
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,680
Did I just hurt?

1037
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,880
Oh, I didn't hurt myself there.

1038
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,120
I didn't have fun with the later levels in this game mode.

1039
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,640
Oh well.

1040
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,240
Okay, we're at 73 of 85 enemies.

1041
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,280
Okay, okay.

1042
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
I have no idea if we've missed any.

1043
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,720
I have a feeling we probably have.

1044
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,480
Team Chaotic hurt me.

1045
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,720
Oh no, that picked like the most awkward team.

1046
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,520
I have no idea if there's like secret enemies behind me.

1047
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,840
I feel like there probably is.

1048
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,160
I'll handle it.

1049
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,040
Okay, there we go.

1050
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,440
Wow.

1051
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,000
Right, we'll do this so we can shoot at the guy.

1052
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,840
Use the X button.

1053
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
Use the X button.

1054
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,080
Do we need to turn back for the railings?

1055
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,960
Surely they wouldn't put an enemy on the railings,

1056
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,560
like down the other sides.

1057
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,760
No, this game is very friendly.

1058
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,480
Oh wow, we just killed three.

1059
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,520
Wait, we've got four more.

1060
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,960
Please tell me there's four at the.

1061
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,360
Whoa, I see a little hidden thing to the left.

1062
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,960
Did you see that?

1063
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
Team Sonic is normal mode.

1064
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,240
Oh no.

1065
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,200
Have I missed two?

1066
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,640
We got a complete Peer League before we get map attack.

1067
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,160
You're not getting it.

1068
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,880
Chaotic is mission mode.

1069
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Thank you for the tip, Broly legend.

1070
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,040
Oh, thank goodness we did it.

1071
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,760
I actually have come.

1072
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,120
Oh, right.

1073
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,440
Hold on.

1074
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,160
Let's just nuke them.

1075
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,000
I think we're actually going to do it.

1076
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,920
I've never gone past this point

1077
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
because I got stuck on this one in childhood.

1078
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,280
I don't know what I got stuck on though.

1079
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,720
That seems really straightforward.

1080
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,200
I think Emelur.

1081
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,280
Emelur sounds like custom manure.

1082
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,120
The P and Peeler stood for puppets this entire time.

1083
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,280
It's up to Azura.

1084
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,280
The Peeler allegations are complete.

1085
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,280
It's not up to me.

1086
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,240
It's up to Azura.

1087
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm just on standby, okay?

1088
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm on standby.

1089
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,080
Now you're not child anymore.

1090
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,440
You can fight your inner demons.

1091
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,720
Right, there are the Golden Turtle robots.

1092
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,640
The turtles control the system.

1093
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,160
Sorry, I'm talking over the literal commentary.

1094
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,040
We're to find and destroy Golden Turtles.

1095
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,600
Okay, Hydration Tech replays.

1096
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,800
That's not a Golden Turtle though.

1097
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,840
Okay, I don't want a key.

1098
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,840
Let's go.

1099
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,800
If you do it, I'll do it.

1100
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,080
Type of friend.

1101
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,880
Pretty much, yeah.

1102
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,480
I was so surprised by the girls when we handed over the Twires.

1103
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,440
But I'm like, hold on a minute.

1104
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,480
You guys are onto something.

1105
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,720
Use thundershoot.

1106
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
What team did you like best?

1107
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,280
Rose, because I'm rubbish at games.

1108
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,840
And it's a girl team.

1109
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,960
And I might be a girl.

1110
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,600
And I don't know.

1111
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,640
I just kind of...

1112
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,320
Oh, why is that locked up?

1113
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,920
Why is that locked up?

1114
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,520
Oh. Charming.

1115
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh, someone leveled up.

1116
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,680
A crocodile leveled up.

1117
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,440
I need another one though.

1118
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,120
I need it for the flight.

1119
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,480
My charming bumblebee.

1120
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,840
I love my charming bumblebee.

1121
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,280
Come on.

1122
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,080
No, he's like shocking them as they come down.

1123
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,680
Estrani's a girl.

1124
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,560
I know.

1125
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,080
It's absolutely horrifying.

1126
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,360
Is there like a secret level up over here, please?

1127
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,800
Wait, there actually is.

1128
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh, no.

1129
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,680
I thought there was a level up.

1130
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Okay, we've been lied to.

1131
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,040
Unconfirmed being a girl allegation.

1132
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,000
Shock and behavior.

1133
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,000
Shock and behavior.

1134
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,720
No, go for the other guy.

1135
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,760
No, the other guy.

1136
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,800
He's right there.

1137
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,520
Oh, they take damage if they fall down.

1138
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,880
Why does he keep getting the level up?

1139
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,080
Give it to the flight.

1140
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,160
Stop giving it to the strength guy.

1141
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,400
How do I kill it?

1142
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:41,960
You know what?

1143
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
I'm gonna just kick and then get my ultimate

1144
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,600
and then do this.

1145
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,640
Look, it's a little bit cheesy doodling,

1146
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,160
but it works.

1147
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,560
Okay.

1148
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,720
And if it works, who am I to complain?

1149
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,200
Thank you.

1150
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,880
Am I supposed to do the stripy?

1151
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,400
Oh, it's a switched open up.

1152
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,920
Oh, right.

1153
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,160
Okay.

1154
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,560
That makes a lot more sense than I was like, hmm.

1155
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,720
Death by bad singing.

1156
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,400
Am I supposed to go up?

1157
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,600
Is this one of them hidden things?

1158
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,800
Oh, it bloody is.

1159
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,760
I hate when there's like a path

1160
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,280
and you're not sure which one's the right one.

1161
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,240
Oh, well, there you go.

1162
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,200
Wait.

1163
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,640
Is he gonna get me?

1164
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,920
Can you aim for the...

1165
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,240
Can you...

1166
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,800
God, right.

1167
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm just gonna...

1168
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,200
Hello?

1169
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,120
Yeah.

1170
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,560
No wonder you fell off the map.

1171
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,280
What was that?

1172
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,760
What was that?

1173
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean, what even was that?

1174
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,880
I think the game kicks Charmin

1175
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,120
all the way in place of like Vespion

1176
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,800
when I threw him or whatever his freaking name is.

1177
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,400
That was bizarre.

1178
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,040
I'm just gonna fly and...

1179
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,840
Oh, no, I lost all my charge.

1180
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,360
I don't...

1181
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,360
Do you want to kick those?

1182
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,880
No, I'm scared to like kick,

1183
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,680
but he's here.

1184
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,120
Right.

1185
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,280
I'm literally just camping on top and kicking.

1186
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,240
The game hates Vespion.

1187
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,200
Oh, come on.

1188
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,320
I don't know the names.

1189
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,560
Right.

1190
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,840
Write the names of my team in Chaotic.

1191
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,480
I don't know.

1192
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,640
Charming is one.

1193
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,760
The game's slippery.

1194
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,920
Stoney, you can't hit them from there.

1195
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,520
Well, I need to be up at them.

1196
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,600
I'm just gonna farm my ultimate.

1197
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,440
You see that blue bar at the top, right?

1198
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,840
Whoa.

1199
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,800
Well, I did something.

1200
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,080
Okay, we got it.

1201
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,560
Charming could have saved themselves,

1202
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,160
but they should have stayed with friends.

1203
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,480
Oh.

1204
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,240
Okay, we've got two turtle doves and a partridge and a pear tree.

1205
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,720
And then what?

1206
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,480
I'll just go back down here again.

1207
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,520
Oh my god, camera angle.

1208
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,480
Please work with me.

1209
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,640
It really is...

1210
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,040
I don't know why it's not letting me manipulate the camera.

1211
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,680
I'll stick to it.

1212
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,480
We charming.

1213
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,160
Vespion.

1214
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,680
Vespion.

1215
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
Charming in the power guy.

1216
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,880
You know what?

1217
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,280
You've literally given me nothing to work with.

1218
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,120
And you will be punished for your sins against me.

1219
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,240
Oh, there's a railing.

1220
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,840
I'll collect coins.

1221
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,480
Do not read that.

1222
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:27,720
Yeah.

1223
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,440
What does that mean?

1224
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't know.

1225
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,440
Okay, one, two.

1226
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh, I lost all my level ups.

1227
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,040
Man.

1228
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,840
Charly...

1229
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,720
Oh, no.

1230
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,240
Vector the crocodile.

1231
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,840
Espio the chameleon.

1232
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,160
And a bumblebee.

1233
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,680
Charmybee the bumblebee.

1234
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,280
Sweet little bumblebee.

1235
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,160
I do like him.

1236
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,120
Wow.

1237
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,600
Right.

1238
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,480
We just need one more golden little turtle enemy.

1239
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,680
All right.

1240
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,600
I sense gold.

1241
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,280
Okay.

1242
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,400
And I sense nothing.

1243
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,640
Ah, sorry.

1244
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,400
I love this flower teleport mechanic.

1245
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,080
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

1246
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,520
I don't care.

1247
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,960
I'll take 12 more of them, please.

1248
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,040
Okay.

1249
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,000
You, Peri.

1250
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,120
If I slam down around them, do they become attack balls?

1251
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,080
I think they do.

1252
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,760
Because he's getting hurt, but I'm not actually doing anything to him.

1253
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,920
I can't see the enemy.

1254
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,120
Where is it?

1255
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,840
Oh, there is.

1256
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,960
I found the enemy right in front of my face.

1257
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,360
It was on the lower floor?

1258
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,640
Oh, don't see that.

1259
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,000
Have I just done a circle?

1260
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,480
Oh, no.

1261
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,240
Is this the start of the map?

1262
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,400
Fua!

1263
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,040
How was your first YouTube stream?

1264
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,840
Hi, Fua and Gain.

1265
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,680
Fua, if you didn't know,

1266
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,440
Fua, if you didn't know, had her first YouTube stream very recently.

1267
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,680
But hi, Raiders.

1268
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,880
Amstwarnica...

1269
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,200
I...

1270
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,800
You do not have a wrench and hammer.

1271
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,440
Hold on.

1272
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,320
Can I do it?

1273
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,720
Hold on.

1274
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,120
Hold on.

1275
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,240
I know the music just cut out.

1276
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,120
Wait, I need to give...

1277
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,080
Must give wrench and hammer.

1278
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,040
Must give wrench and hammer.

1279
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,000
Whoa, whoa, hello.

1280
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,400
Hi.

1281
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,360
Just for the Raiders, Amstwarnica,

1282
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,440
from Violaure.

1283
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,680
That's right, the porn company.

1284
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,000
Sorry.

1285
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,800
All right.

1286
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,160
And we're playing Sonic Heroes,

1287
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,040
a little childhood game,

1288
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,240
but yeah, if you didn't know,

1289
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,520
for the Reeflings, actually,

1290
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Fua just had her first YouTube,

1291
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,640
a little stream,

1292
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,160
and she was really nervous for it.

1293
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,640
What's that?

1294
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,440
I watched it.

1295
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,240
Yes, I did.

1296
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,640
I know.

1297
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,520
I can't believe it.

1298
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:46,920
I haven't...

1299
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,640
I have many a time.

1300
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,320
Boom, like that.

1301
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,600
Just like that, you stand it.

1302
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,040
Get wrenched, get wrenched, get wrenched, honestly.

1303
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,680
Okay, how's that?

1304
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,360
That look good?

1305
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,160
I'm just making sure the stream

1306
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,440
isn't playing in the background,

1307
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,440
and then it doubles up on audio by accident.

1308
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:04,920
There we go.

1309
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,640
Okay, we sadly have missed the turtle.

1310
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,440
So I think we have to replay

1311
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,880
through this entire section again.

1312
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,240
Maybe, possibly.

1313
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,240
The audio's fine.

1314
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,680
I need one golden turtle.

1315
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,880
I can't find it.

1316
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,400
Okay, I do love the game for that.

1317
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,320
I hope your stream has been going well.

1318
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,680
It's been amazing, honestly.

1319
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,080
I've been spoiled by my reeflings.

1320
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,760
So I couldn't have asked for a better streaming time,

1321
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,080
honestly.

1322
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,520
It's only been a month, but well,

1323
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,800
actually, nope.

1324
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,160
We're getting close to two months.

1325
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,640
Can I do army?

1326
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,240
Oh, we're almost halfway through July.

1327
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,960
Yeah, almost one and a half months.

1328
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,680
Let's fucking go.

1329
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,040
Oh, I love streaming.

1330
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh my god.

1331
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,720
I love my life.

1332
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,600
Oh god, I'm so out of it right now.

1333
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,160
There's one up ahead.

1334
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,440
Someone's waiting for me right now.

1335
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:06,920
Whoa!

1336
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,160
Not from Veiler.

1337
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,360
That was not supposed to happen.

1338
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,360
Hi, Broly Legend.

1339
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,400
Thank you for the tip.

1340
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,600
I said hi, Broly Legend.

1341
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,120
What do you use the not the Veiler for Peeler?

1342
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,680
Damn, already.

1343
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,280
It feels like a debut just happened.

1344
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,800
Time goes by so fast.

1345
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
It's not even possible to keep up.

1346
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,000
I hope there's a guy here.

1347
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,600
Is he here?

1348
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,960
Okay, maybe I'm starting to understand

1349
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,440
why this is like such a long game.

1350
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,200
I didn't think they were bad.

1351
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,440
Man, Fletcher and Gage are really good.

1352
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,840
Am I going in circles?

1353
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,640
Did I miss it?

1354
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,320
Oh, we found them.

1355
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,960
We found them.

1356
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,800
Literally, all we have to do is nuke them.

1357
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,360
Ah, we did it, we did it, we did it.

1358
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,560
Let's go.

1359
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,520
Next level.

1360
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,480
He was back there.

1361
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,680
Oh, well, I found another one.

1362
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,760
I guess they must put multiple on the maps

1363
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,360
in case like you get stuck

1364
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,560
because no one wants to be stuck.

1365
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,960
Slonic hero stages are notoriously big.

1366
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,520
That took me eight minutes to kill three things.

1367
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,360
That's how long that took.

1368
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,800
That's shocking behavior.

1369
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,360
Shawnton.

1370
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,720
Okay, stop fooling around.

1371
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,200
Okay, stop fooling around.

1372
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,920
Yeah, no, maybe I was the voice actor

1373
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,680
for Charming, maybe?

1374
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,600
A little Charming roleplay.

1375
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,920
Look at them pixelated yetis.

1376
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,760
I don't know how pixelated it comes across

1377
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,080
on your screen, but I can feel the pixels on my end.

1378
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,120
Who's this broad?

1379
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,160
You mean the bad guys?

1380
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,840
You mean the bad guys?

1381
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,680
Team Darkseid just taking like 16 minutes long.

1382
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,160
Oh, god.

1383
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,360
I don't know how to fight.

1384
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,200
What am I doing?

1385
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,840
Oh, my god, stop.

1386
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,800
Give me the freaking B level up.

1387
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,040
Go.

1388
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,040
I'm freaking scared.

1389
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,480
I'm scared.

1390
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:23,960
I'm scared.

1391
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,520
Give me the B.

1392
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,560
Okay, we've got the B level up.

1393
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,120
That's all we need.

1394
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,080
We're level two on the B.

1395
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,840
Get off the map.

1396
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,800
Get off the map.

1397
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,520
Off the map.

1398
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,240
Off it.

1399
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:31,960
Off it.

1400
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,360
Off it.

1401
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,760
No, they got me.

1402
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,240
Get off the map.

1403
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,960
Get off the map.

1404
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Okay, we got rid of the bat apparently.

1405
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,560
I'm scared.

1406
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,760
Okay, they're just like a pair of stunlocks right now.

1407
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,320
I'll take it.

1408
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,720
Get off the map.

1409
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,360
Get off it.

1410
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,200
He's just got nuts down there.

1411
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,840
Where is he?

1412
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,600
Oh, there he was.

1413
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,000
He's there.

1414
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,400
He's there.

1415
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:03,880
I see him.

1416
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,800
Go away, Shadow.

1417
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,240
Get off the map.

1418
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,560
Oh, I'm freaking sick.

1419
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,120
I don't know how to do this, honestly.

1420
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,840
Okay, hold on.

1421
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,200
He's actually annihilating me.

1422
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,840
I'm using my ult.

1423
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,560
I'm using my ult.

1424
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,360
I don't know how to throw him off the map though.

1425
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,840
I'm just going to spam with...

1426
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,880
We charm in.

1427
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,600
Okay, there we go.

1428
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,400
Okay, we ulted.

1429
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,160
Giving them the silver treatment.

1430
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,480
Wait till Shadow uses his special technique.

1431
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,040
A gun.

1432
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,480
Okay, yeah, I did that.

1433
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:35,960
That's right.

1434
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,520
Give me an A.

1435
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,960
And why was that a C?

1436
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,800
I did it in under two minutes.

1437
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,280
A C?

1438
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,640
Shouldn't that not be a B then,

1439
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,160
if it's supposed to be under a minute?

1440
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,640
I want to play!

1441
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,280
Yeah, if anyone is like...

1442
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,280
Just spam tornadoes to speed character

1443
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,680
and you win in less than 10 seconds.

1444
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,440
They weren't walking in moe tornadoes.

1445
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,000
Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny.

1446
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,120
Quite literally with the game.

1447
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,320
Right, what was the objective?

1448
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,360
I wasn't paying attention.

1449
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,960
Oh, get coins.

1450
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,880
Look, top left, it says get coins.

1451
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,560
I don't know.

1452
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,400
Whoa.

1453
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,520
The triggers are reversed.

1454
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,040
They're on the wrong side.

1455
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,280
What?

1456
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,920
When I do left and right, it's wrong.

1457
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,000
Okay, hold on.

1458
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,440
I need swaps of one of the others

1459
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,240
because I'm getting nowhere.

1460
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,200
Okay, did that help?

1461
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,080
Is that where I want to go?

1462
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,400
Oh, that level up feels good for me.

1463
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,920
I need to get what?

1464
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,880
I'm trying to get up, I am.

1465
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,840
I'm trying to get up.

1466
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,880
Okay, we did it, we did it.

1467
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,400
200 rings.

1468
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,560
Okay, wait, this is like straight gamble.

1469
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,120
Well, if we just need coins,

1470
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,960
did I kill that guy back here?

1471
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,280
I did.

1472
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,280
Oh, no, I picked up the key.

1473
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,720
Oh, I really don't want to do any of those missions.

1474
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,120
I accidentally got the key.

1475
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,520
Oops.

1476
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,480
Oopsie, whoopsie.

1477
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,920
Yeah, for anyone that wondered why I base off the OSTs,

1478
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,080
just listen to the music and appreciate what it's like.

1479
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,720
It's just so beautifully crafted.

1480
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,600
Maybe not this part,

1481
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,880
but it's supposed to show falling into descent.

1482
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,760
Whoa, no, come on.

1483
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,560
I was doing it.

1484
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,360
I can't, it won't let me select the guy that's stuck in the machine.

1485
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,880
I could have gambled that, come on.

1486
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,240
Casino.

1487
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,280
I can't get inside.

1488
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,360
What?

1489
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,520
Okay, no, go in.

1490
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,480
What?

1491
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,480
He is bugging out on that thing.

1492
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,840
I can hear it from over here.

1493
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,280
I'm so sorry for that noise.

1494
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,120
The game, he's stuck in here.

1495
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,520
I can't even push him out.

1496
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,080
Oh, I pushed this out somehow.

1497
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,040
I don't know how I did that.

1498
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,640
$2, give me more coins.

1499
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,360
No, I'm trying to get out of this section.

1500
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,600
Yes, there we go.

1501
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,880
Okay, let's go in here.

1502
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,280
Jeez.

1503
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,880
Okay, we did it.

1504
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,640
I hate when I can't get inside too.

1505
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,720
I was freaking so stuck there.

1506
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,560
Try my best.

1507
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,040
Uh, we've apparently lost Speedy Gonzales.

1508
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,960
We've just straight up lost someone up for the speed character.

1509
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,800
Nope, how much do we need?

1510
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,160
We need 70 more coins.

1511
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,480
We've like straight up lost him.

1512
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,600
He's not even respawning.

1513
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,800
Now she'll lose the house to Gamba.

1514
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,720
Espo dead.

1515
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,080
He's literally popped his clogs.

1516
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,720
He's had enough.

1517
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,120
I mean, I hope we can progress.

1518
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,720
What?

1519
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,320
I really hope we're not going to get a section

1520
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,640
where we need him because hello.

1521
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,440
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

1522
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:07,960
I'm going to be the bumblebee in case we get put into a very unique situation in a minute

1523
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,360
because why is it not spawning him back in?

1524
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,160
With him gone, you will know smell the cold.

1525
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,240
He got lost in the Gamba.

1526
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,840
That's exactly why I didn't show up.

1527
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,400
See kids?

1528
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,280
No.

1529
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:27,640
Whoa.

1530
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,720
Okay, we did it.

1531
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,920
I don't know how, but we did it.

1532
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Is this not a jump against the wall one?

1533
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,520
Okay, it's this one.

1534
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:42,920
What are we looking at?

1535
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,240
Come on.

1536
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,440
We must be close by now.

1537
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,520
I need to destroy these guys.

1538
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,160
Let's just do that.

1539
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,920
Espo back.

1540
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,680
He paid his Gamba debts back.

1541
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,840
Actually, I wanted to ask you about the...

1542
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,240
What?

1543
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,480
Why did we win?

1544
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,320
Because we destroyed enemies?

1545
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,840
I mean, I guess you get money.

1546
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,080
I had to wait to say five minutes.

1547
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1548
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,800
I apologize to any Fuwa.

1549
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,400
Enjoy.

1550
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,040
I'm so sorry.

1551
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,480
I'm probably butchering her name as well.

1552
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,600
My accent, Fuwa the Neko Vtuber.

1553
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,720
Thank you to anyone who's binchening.

1554
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,040
She had a fantastic first little YouTube stream.

1555
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,320
You got 218 rings from that fight.

1556
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,920
Okay, I'll remember that.

1557
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,480
If there's another money mission, I'll try and remember that.

1558
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,480
That Yakuza game.

1559
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,960
Is the Yakuza games good to play on stream?

1560
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,120
Like, am I going to be able to play them on stream?

1561
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,880
Because I am interested in them.

1562
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,760
I'm not going to let...

1563
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,240
No, I don't want to play the freaking...

1564
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,760
I accidentally picked up the key.

1565
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,640
Forgive me.

1566
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,280
Oh, see, that's what I don't like.

1567
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,960
I randomly yank your momentum.

1568
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,120
Oh my god, but it's so Kawaii-ne though.

1569
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,760
Hold on a minute.

1570
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,960
The music cannot be jamming.

1571
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,120
Oh my god.

1572
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,000
Oh, it's so Kawaii-ne though.

1573
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,720
What am I supposed to do?

1574
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,280
I don't know.

1575
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,320
Okay, okay.

1576
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,680
Okay.

1577
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,640
Don't hurt him now.

1578
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,440
Don't hurt him now.

1579
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,920
Oh, sugar rush.

1580
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:21,880
Wow.

1581
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,360
I assume...

1582
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1583
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,160
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.

1584
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,240
I couldn't do it.

1585
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:31,880
I suck.

1586
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:32,920
No!

1587
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,240
Are we done?

1588
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,040
Hydration check.

1589
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,640
I'm currently hogging the microphone

1590
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,800
because I freaking picked up the thing wrong.

1591
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,440
Okay.

1592
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh.

1593
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,640
Sorry if you get motion sick.

1594
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,400
This probably isn't the scene for you right now.

1595
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,680
Oh no, not the bombs.

1596
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,280
Oh wait, I'm running out of time at the bottom?

1597
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,080
Oh my god, I have to get through this level.

1598
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,640
What the heck?

1599
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,280
Oh, I'm out of speed boosts.

1600
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,320
I'm out of speed boosts.

1601
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,040
Oh, we made it.

1602
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,520
It's fine.

1603
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,160
Plenty of time.

1604
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,720
Jeez.

1605
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,040
Right.

1606
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,480
Do not let me pick up a key again.

1607
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,840
I do not like that.

1608
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,200
I'm literally hogging the microphone.

1609
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:20,600
I am.

1610
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,480
I've got a big man.

1611
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,280
Not I'm something.

1612
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,000
Team Chaotix blasts give tons of rings.

1613
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,240
I wonder, I guess maybe because it's their thing.

1614
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,680
Oh, we got two lives out of that.

1615
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,240
I mean, sure.

1616
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,400
I'm probably going to throw myself off the map somehow.

1617
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,600
Bingo highly.

1618
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:37,960
Uh-huh.

1619
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:41,720
Uh-huh.

1620
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,040
This is the song that my theme song is based after.

1621
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,360
Notice how it goes ear to ear.

1622
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,400
My background music goes ear to ear.

1623
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,760
If you listen, nice thing.

1624
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,000
Oh, let's try it again.

1625
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,320
Hold on.

1626
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,960
I think I wasn't supposed to do it that way, but we did it.

1627
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,440
Strony's panic when she realizes Sonic games want her to go fast.

1628
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,120
Okay.

1629
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,800
Oh, dear.

1630
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,560
That's not the best outcome for that.

1631
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,280
Oh, I love this.

1632
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,280
A very important chip.

1633
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,320
Oh, I'm so sleep deprived, but this song is so good.

1634
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:45,560
No.

1635
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,200
Oh, I need to level everyone up.

1636
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:52,920
Okay.

1637
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,560
What does this do?

1638
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,280
Well, hold on.

1639
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,200
I need to give you your motherfucking wrench.

1640
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:01,960
I show you, Ms.

1641
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,360
You're being punished by becoming a moderator.

1642
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah, you have been punished.

1643
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,800
Congrats.

1644
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,600
Do not resist.

1645
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,240
Well, it's running.

1646
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:21,400
How the last time we saw Mismar was, um, give me a wrench and I'll get right or

1647
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,640
to work on open VTubers to work POV.

1648
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,320
Honestly, that's terrible, but it's kind of true.

1649
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,120
How are you doing?

1650
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,160
Don't miss my last.

1651
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,320
I knew you were on Pokemans.

1652
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,240
Whoa.

1653
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:41,480
What?

1654
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,000
I can't.

1655
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,520
It won't let me swap to be.

1656
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:44,840
Okay.

1657
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,240
Now go.

1658
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,200
Oh, there we go.

1659
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,840
Bingo highway.

1660
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,000
Not those kind of chips.

1661
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,400
Silly.

1662
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:56,760
Oh, okay.

1663
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,440
Oh, I guess I didn't want to get that.

1664
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,000
What?

1665
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,600
That like completely bugged out.

1666
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,480
Bingo.

1667
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,280
Oh, that wasn't paying attention.

1668
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:14,600
Hold on.

1669
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,480
I was supposed to.

1670
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:15,720
All right.

1671
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,200
There we go.

1672
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:16,520
Sorry.

1673
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,720
I'm supposed to hit.

1674
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,120
There's a bit of a strange delay going on.

1675
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,680
Is there a chip up here?

1676
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,760
I mean, it must be down here.

1677
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,080
Hold on.

1678
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,320
Let me get my team back since they all despawned.

1679
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,520
Uh, I'll just use my own pure laziness.

1680
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,680
Now not only the other mods can ban me, but VTubers as well.

1681
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,480
Exactly.

1682
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,000
The DH Charmy.

1683
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,240
In the original game, he's married with kids.

1684
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,320
The little bumblebee.

1685
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,400
Who's he pollinating?

1686
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,160
Married with kids?

1687
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,520
Well, I had a divorce in the retcon of the lore.

1688
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,320
Like, what?

1689
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,520
Oh, I see it.

1690
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,400
I want the chip, please.

1691
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,320
4 out of 10.

1692
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,680
What happens if I pollinate, huh?

1693
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,640
What are you going to do?

1694
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,280
Nothing's happening.

1695
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,480
I won't let me go in.

1696
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,200
Go in, please.

1697
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,160
Yay!

1698
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,200
He was so very...

1699
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,480
What's playing Pokemon got very sad

1700
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,720
because there was one I really wanted to catch trying to cast.

1701
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,840
He stopped that.

1702
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,320
Oh, gosh.

1703
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,080
Oh, I was so lucky.

1704
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:27,480
Hold on.

1705
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,480
He's pollinating every queen out there.

1706
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,280
He's like that.

1707
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,960
Pollinating every sunflower, you can find.

1708
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,200
Conquer is bad for a day's style.

1709
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:37,400
Wow.

1710
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,560
You're okay.

1711
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,000
5 out of 10 for Chiep.

1712
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,560
I think.

1713
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,640
Ms. Margell has an ASMR stream coming up

1714
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,920
if I'm not mistaken.

1715
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,800
If I've not been taking a cheeky peek at you,

1716
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,440
I think you do.

1717
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,480
Enemy's up at home.

1718
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:58,680
Whoa.

1719
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,560
Can I get?

1720
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,280
Yeah, I need him.

1721
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,720
Yeah, I need...

1722
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,080
Are we out?

1723
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,640
We did not just out of bounds.

1724
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:05,880
No!

1725
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,280
Hold on.

1726
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,200
Okay.

1727
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:10,760
I think we...

1728
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,960
Okay, we can get back in.

1729
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,360
I have never done that in my life before.

1730
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,120
Okay, let's go.

1731
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,280
I didn't...

1732
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,160
I haven't...

1733
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:19,880
Oh, whoa.

1734
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,520
Hold on.

1735
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,240
I think...

1736
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,320
I think maybe...

1737
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,040
Yeah.

1738
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,720
Yeah, I was going to say that's a little bit too sad.

1739
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,320
Ultimate time.

1740
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,520
Yeah, fun fact about that, ASMR.

1741
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,200
When it happens,

1742
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,360
I'm banning everyone on YouTube except you!

1743
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:38,840
This is the way...

1744
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,600
How dare you?

1745
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,720
You wouldn't ban my reeflings, would you, though?

1746
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,240
Come on, we're just here.

1747
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,880
Oh!

1748
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,520
I missed!

1749
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,240
I missed!

1750
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,600
Oh, I didn't realize...

1751
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,480
How is that supposed to know

1752
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,640
I was going to be chilling there?

1753
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,200
Seriously.

1754
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,920
Oh, my God, I'm going so fast.

1755
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,360
Please, I just want this.

1756
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:56,680
Okay.

1757
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,880
Okay, do not fall off the mat.

1758
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,080
Oh, no!

1759
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,520
There was one back there!

1760
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,080
How...

1761
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,320
How...

1762
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,040
How am I supposed to see him?

1763
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,440
How many do I need?

1764
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,320
I need two more.

1765
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,680
And I've passed two.

1766
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,120
Oh, but one more!

1767
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,000
One more, one more!

1768
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,120
Okay, we've got a bingo though, poggers.

1769
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,920
There are more than 10 chips.

1770
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,200
Okay, thank goodness, because...

1771
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,800
I can see the rest of the map there.

1772
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,280
I'm glad I will see good map design and stuff.

1773
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,200
Like, if you're going to make me aim for like...

1774
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,400
I can see a chip up there.

1775
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:31,880
Can I get it?

1776
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,680
Oh, no.

1777
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,280
I cannot because I've fallen...

1778
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:34,680
There, right.

1779
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,160
Oh!

1780
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,960
Ta-da!

1781
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,440
We did it!

1782
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,960
I like how friendly they have been in this game.

1783
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,280
They could have made this so difficult if they wanted to.

1784
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,920
And yet, they've like put extra stuff then, so...

1785
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,240
Thank you, development team, for many a year ago.

1786
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,520
You did fantastic.

1787
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,240
And I think you should give yourself a pat on the back

1788
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,720
because you have made the game not frustrating

1789
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,160
by doing these kinds of things.

1790
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,560
Thank you.

1791
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,480
We're just a couple of little guys.

1792
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,360
Stroney, you're such a good gamer that you're breaking the game, honestly.

1793
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,200
I'm a little bit...

1794
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,960
No clip to game by accident.

1795
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,160
Awesome!

1796
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,000
Totally awesome!

1797
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,880
Awesome!

1798
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,960
Totally awesome!

1799
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,200
I fucking love charm...

1800
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:14,680
Charm.

1801
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:24,840
A fight?

1802
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,520
I can't remember how many levels there are

1803
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,440
or if it's the same for everyone, but...

1804
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,400
I think it's like Haunted Mansion.

1805
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,160
And then...

1806
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,240
An airship?

1807
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,240
Wow!

1808
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:46,920
Can I get...

1809
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,840
Okay, we've got one level up on Espeon.

1810
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:53,720
Oh, there's...

1811
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,200
Give me that!

1812
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,400
No, go to him.

1813
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:55,720
Yes.

1814
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,320
No, do not spawn in the enemies!

1815
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,000
No, go for him!

1816
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,720
Okay, there we go.

1817
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,760
He's leveled up to two, surely.

1818
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,280
Surely.

1819
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,280
Stop bouncing on that.

1820
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,280
Wait, I saw those air birds though.

1821
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,280
14 for Dark, which is the one with all levels.

1822
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:16,520
Okay.

1823
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,640
She's gonna become a bee.

1824
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,680
Bee, bee, bee.

1825
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,800
Charming bees.

1826
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,800
I just loved it.

1827
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,080
I just think he's cute.

1828
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,680
And neat, okay.

1829
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,360
Oh wow, wait, we don't have...

1830
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,040
I guess we need level three in order to get these guys in one shot.

1831
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,680
I'm just sending them to go do it.

1832
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,000
Sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

1833
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,280
It's the real cannon level, the forest level,

1834
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,640
and then Haunted and then airship.

1835
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,840
And then we're done already!

1836
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,400
We're out.

1837
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,640
We're out.

1838
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,280
No, bitch.

1839
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,160
Not, bitch.

1840
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,840
Stop bouncing on this freaking jump pad.

1841
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,800
I can hear it.

1842
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,840
You're getting distracted, teammates.

1843
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,680
I just...

1844
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,040
No, go attack.

1845
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,680
Oh, there's one more.

1846
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,640
Okay, we got it, we got it.

1847
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,760
The silver ones are armored.

1848
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,240
Only power and falling does damage them.

1849
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,680
I do admit I love the safety of the flying.

1850
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,360
I'm sorry, cream carried last time and our tails did.

1851
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,760
Oh, that's an ultimate if I've ever seen one.

1852
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,960
Oh, they do get tons of money.

1853
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,440
I like it, I'm here for it.

1854
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,720
I got more money for those kills?

1855
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,600
Wait, we already have Team Blast again.

1856
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,520
Okay, let's just ultimate since there's a turtle, guys.

1857
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,000
Hold on.

1858
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,600
You need to replay the bridge mission on Microsoft to balance this game.

1859
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,560
So, my dad was, as I said yesterday,

1860
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,000
but my dad was legit laughing at me.

1861
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,280
I'm like, bro, I'm beating him up.

1862
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,520
Okay, that's an ultimate again.

1863
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,320
We're on...

1864
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,720
Wait, can we just keep repeating the alls if we get coins?

1865
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,360
Hello?

1866
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,520
Can we just keep going like this?

1867
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,000
Those were easy ones.

1868
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,400
Okay, I'm learning the strats about Team Chaotic.

1869
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,280
I'm here for it.

1870
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,280
Money farming.

1871
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,440
You can chain them together as Chaotic if you defeat enough.

1872
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,360
Wow.

1873
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,560
Wow, there were a lot of them.

1874
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,240
I'm here.

1875
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,000
I'm getting it.

1876
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,720
Real Canyon!

1877
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,680
Oh, it's our mission objective.

1878
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:22,840
Ooh.

1879
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,520
I like when you hold eggs, they all look backwards.

1880
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,400
It's so cute.

1881
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,520
I wasn't paying attention to the mission,

1882
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,560
so we're just going for it.

1883
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:35,960
Let's go.

1884
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,160
I assume need for speed.

1885
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,080
Get up to 200 miles per hour,

1886
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:41,720
and then the game...

1887
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,480
That's the mission done.

1888
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,120
Let's go.

1889
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,120
I'm not just...

1890
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,120
Why am I going so slow?

1891
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,240
Am I going crazy?

1892
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,760
I feel like I'm going really slow.

1893
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,440
I even want to press X.

1894
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,120
Am I supposed to tap it rapidly?

1895
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:05,880
I'm tapping.

1896
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,520
I'm tapping.

1897
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,880
I needed to be the bumblebee.

1898
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,880
Right, I'm being the bumblebee,

1899
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,840
but I know what to do.

1900
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,080
If you turn into the lane that goes faster...

1901
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,580
Ooh.

1902
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,840
Oh, I don't like that.

1903
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,840
Oh, my God, that makes my...

1904
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:34,840
I've not been funny, but that falling makes my clean shot,

1905
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,840
because I literally can see the fall distance.

1906
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,840
I'm going, I'm going, and...

1907
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,840
I am so slow.

1908
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,840
I don't think I'm supposed to be doing it this way,

1909
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,840
but I'll just send it.

1910
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,840
I'm going, I'm going.

1911
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Okay, we did it.

1912
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
Level up bumblebee.

1913
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,840
He certainly looks like it to me.

1914
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I don't know about you, but...

1915
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,840
Do not pick up that key.

1916
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,840
Do I make myself clear?

1917
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,840
Yes.

1918
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,840
Nope, not that. This one.

1919
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,840
Taking Strony on a roller coaster ride.

1920
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,840
I'm scared of roller coasters.

1921
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,840
I don't even know how you guys do it.

1922
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,840
People are like, oh, I'm so glad I got to go on the upside down curvy.

1923
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,840
Why is the camera locking like this?

1924
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
Fly, okay. That is why.

1925
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,840
The camera said I've had enough of your shenanigans.

1926
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,840
No, no, no.

1927
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,840
Camera, please work with me.

1928
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,840
I'm begging.

1929
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,840
Okay, there we go.

1930
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
We're doing it.

1931
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,840
And maybe a really awkward way to do it,

1932
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,840
but we're very slowly doing it.

1933
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,840
Okay, look.

1934
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,840
The rabbit or the hare?

1935
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,840
Wait, no, that's not it.

1936
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,840
The turtle or the rabbit?

1937
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
Oh, this sounds so badly.

1938
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
So badly.

1939
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
They must.

1940
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,840
And this is why we're the fricking

1941
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,840
Bumble Beach.

1942
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Oh my gosh.

1943
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,840
I'm not well enough to be having heart attacks like this.

1944
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,840
Come on, let's send me, please.

1945
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
What's this?

1946
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Push me back. Don't do that.

1947
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,840
I guess we fly over.

1948
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,840
Wait, we can't fly over.

1949
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,840
No.

1950
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,840
Put me back.

1951
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,840
Why even?

1952
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,840
Why? Why even?

1953
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,840
Why even place such a thing there?

1954
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,840
What even is that?

1955
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,840
So only the middle one sends you back.

1956
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,840
And if you're dumb enough to pick the outer ones,

1957
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,840
then that's on you.

1958
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Please, camera angle.

1959
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,840
I am begging you.

1960
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,840
Sweet little bumblebee.

1961
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,840
I mean, he did try and save us,

1962
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
but we didn't do it.

1963
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,840
Hard clench.

1964
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,840
Rail canyon is such a buggy level.

1965
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,840
The only time I die in this game

1966
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,840
is legit due to,

1967
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,840
like, the camera not being nice

1968
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,840
or

1969
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,840
the mapping going funny.

1970
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,840
Like, it shouldn't do that.

1971
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Again?

1972
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Okay. I'm not to be the bumblebee,

1973
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,840
I don't think, when I'm on these,

1974
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,840
but he's the safest.

1975
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,840
He's literally the safest thing in the game.

1976
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,840
Because you can pick yourself up

1977
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
when you drop fall off.

1978
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,840
Right.

1979
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,840
And then the other rails.

1980
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,840
Right.

1981
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,840
Now destroy that.

1982
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Right.

1983
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Oh, there's something in here.

1984
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,840
Oh.

1985
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,840
Okay. I thought it was going to, like,

1986
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,840
a switch or something.

1987
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,840
The rails are so scary.

1988
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,840
Okay.

1989
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,840
And now I'm too low level to do anything

1990
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
from a distance again.

1991
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
No. Bumblebee.

1992
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Okay.

1993
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,840
And then press the button.

1994
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
And then I guess, jump aboard.

1995
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,840
Are you squid me right now?

1996
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,840
Something I think we've learned

1997
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,840
is that all we need to do is drive

1998
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,840
strongly around at high enough speed

1999
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,840
and that instantly makes her woozy enough

2000
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
to be in subspace.

2001
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,840
I'm so confident on her bike,

2002
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,840
but not in the car.

2003
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,840
Why would you want me to be a nosy

2004
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,840
then? That's so mean.

2005
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,840
I was so ill because of that taxi.

2006
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
Thank you tiny spin.

2007
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,840
But I was so ill.

2008
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,840
Why would you want me to be a nosy?

2009
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,840
I had to, it literally was so bad

2010
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,840
it didn't go away after, like, a sleep.

2011
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,840
Oh, there was a bomb.

2012
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,840
I'm sorry. I see it now.

2013
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,840
I see my ignorant ways.

2014
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,840
I'm just going to play it safe.

2015
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Drive her around.

2016
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,840
Just pick her up and spin her.

2017
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Get the siph.

2018
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,840
Is it the siphon-trypical force?

2019
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,840
Yes, this looks correct.

2020
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,840
Stay on one of the buttons.

2021
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
I'm being trolled.

2022
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,840
I'm actually refusing.

2023
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,840
Just carry her. 10 hour car, right?

2024
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,840
I wouldn't even make an hour.

2025
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,840
I am so terribly

2026
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,840
bad.

2027
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,840
The siphon-trypical...

2028
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,840
I can't even remember the fricking word.

2029
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
It's like siphon-trypical force.

2030
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,840
Oh, and a level up.

2031
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,840
Oh, we can finally destroy.

2032
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,840
Please do not perish me and begging.

2033
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Against my greater judgment

2034
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,840
I will go

2035
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,840
we espion-vespion

2036
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,840
because

2037
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,840
I think they've only made it

2038
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
with these height

2039
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,840
hitboxes in mind and that's why

2040
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,840
I keep getting perished.

2041
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,840
I really don't want to lose.

2042
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,840
I run now.

2043
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,840
I'm moving, I'm moving.

2044
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,840
I promise.

2045
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,840
I'm going, I'm going.

2046
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,840
The sound effects are actually

2047
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,840
bugging out a little bit.

2048
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,840
Wee!

2049
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,840
Any movie shows

2050
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,840
watch along the streams

2051
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,840
coming up

2052
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,840
not until two weeks

2053
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,840
away.

2054
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,840
When

2055
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,840
Meeda goes home

2056
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,840
I am going

2057
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,840
to do a ton of back to back

2058
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,840
to back to back streams, okay?

2059
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,840
To make up for all the missed membership streams

2060
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,840
like I'm talking like daily membership streams

2061
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,840
I'm like public streaming

2062
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,840
to make up

2063
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,840
for all the streamies that I miss.

2064
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
But for the next

2065
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,840
two weeks, no, there's no ASMR

2066
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,840
and there's no

2067
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
did I just miss?

2068
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,840
Okay, I think I'm supposed

2069
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,840
to go this way. Hold on.

2070
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,840
Okay, that looks right. Yeah, that looks right.

2071
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,840
Now that you mentioned

2072
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,840
Siphonchic Focal Force, did you know

2073
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,840
that you can use it to scramble eggs

2074
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,840
without breaking the shell?

2075
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,840
That's cool, I like that.

2076
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,840
I like

2077
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,840
there is, hold on, what's in here?

2078
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,840
Money!

2079
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,840
Well, I don't need it, but thank you.

2080
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,840
Someone else might need it. I'll take this one though

2081
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,840
because it's okay, I won't take this one.

2082
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,840
Are you squiddling here or what?

2083
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,840
Freakin' in a...

2084
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,840
Having your head spin from car rides

2085
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,840
gives a wonderful excuse to plan in X-Tress

2086
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,840
stops on a road trip to make your head

2087
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,840
spin in other ways.

2088
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,840
Eh?

2089
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,840
Tim Shull, what did you say?

2090
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,840
Having your head spin from car rides

2091
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,840
gives a wonderful excuse to

2092
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,840
plan in X-Tress

2093
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,840
stops on a road trip

2094
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,840
to make your head spin in other ways.

2095
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,840
Is this

2096
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,840
refling asking for head?

2097
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,840
Yes or no?

2098
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,840
Be honest, what did you just ask for?

2099
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,840
I'm too, I am

2100
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,840
so sorry, I'm so sleep deprived

2101
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,840
right now. I am fighting

2102
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,840
for my life trying to speak English to you.

2103
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,840
I

2104
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
am fighting for my life.

2105
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,840
Okay, let's go

2106
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,840
him again.

2107
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,840
I was supposed to go up?

2108
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,840
Why

2109
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,840
jump?

2110
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,840
Don't make me jump.

2111
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,840
Wait, did I just do a circle?

2112
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,840
I think I may have just done a

2113
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,840
circle?

2114
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,840
No.

2115
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,840
Oh, actually I've

2116
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,840
miraculously appeared where I need to be

2117
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
at the right moment.

2118
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,840
And now go for it!

2119
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,840
Wait, there's something

2120
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,840
in the middle there.

2121
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,840
Shawnee doesn't even speak English

2122
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,840
honestly.

2123
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,840
Oh shit, hold on.

2124
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,840
Stop, camera please.

2125
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,840
Wait, that wasn't even a

2126
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,840
This is just for monies?

2127
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,840
Oh no, it's not.

2128
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,840
Wait, I've done it, no.

2129
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,840
Okay.

2130
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,840
Assume

2131
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,840
this?

2132
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,840
Okay, it worked.

2133
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,840
It worked.

2134
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,840
We're doing it, we're progressing.

2135
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,840
Hi.

2136
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,840
Thanks for joining me.

2137
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,840
I don't know when I think Shibi is.

2138
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,840
What?

2139
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,840
Was I supposed to do

2140
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,840
something there?

2141
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,840
Shibi and Azura are collabing here, it's

2142
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
Audra.

2143
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
I don't think I'll be able to redirect, I don't

2144
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,840
know. Maybe.

2145
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,840
What is happening?

2146
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,840
This is making my head

2147
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,840
stand.

2148
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,840
I'm trying, I promise, I'm trying my

2149
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,840
best.

2150
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,840
Oh, we did it!

2151
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
I didn't expect that.

2152
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
Another endurance stream.

2153
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,840
I don't even know if I'm going to last two

2154
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,840
hours, I'm going to be honest.

2155
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,840
I'm not kidding when I said I haven't

2156
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,840
slept.

2157
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,840
So I did Isaac with you

2158
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,840
and then

2159
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,840
I went out with my dad

2160
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,840
and I did all this stuff and we

2161
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,840
found my mom,

2162
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,840
found my granddad.

2163
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,840
I got a two hour nap

2164
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,840
after the cafe.

2165
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,840
I woke up

2166
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,840
and I was like, I don't need to stay because I'm

2167
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,840
full.

2168
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,840
And then I've been up freaking

2169
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,840
working doing all this behind the scenes stuff

2170
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,840
and I still didn't

2171
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,840
raise Shibi's script, which I need to write.

2172
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,840
It's just

2173
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,840
a simple ear cleaning script

2174
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,840
that I forgot.

2175
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,840
I'm to

2176
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,840
okay, I'm to destroy these

2177
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,840
little egg capsule design

2178
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,840
things.

2179
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,840
If you don't feel well, take a break. No, no, no,

2180
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,840
I know, I know.

2181
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,840
I think maybe we could probably

2182
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,840
do a Sonic Heroes marathon

2183
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,840
though. I wouldn't mind trying

2184
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,840
100% this game.

2185
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,840
In terms of doing all the

2186
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,840
gang stuff.

2187
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,840
I don't know about collecting all

2188
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,840
the emeralds, that's something

2189
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,840
even I'm not sure I've got

2190
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,840
what does this do?

2191
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,840
Nope, nope.

2192
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Have you considered

2193
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,840
a sector or other sports stuff?

2194
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,840
It's just

2195
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,840
I don't know

2196
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,840
how I had the brain power to even do anything

2197
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,840
about that.

2198
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,840
It's just things need to calm down.

2199
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,840
That's it, there's so much going on

2200
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,840
but things aren't calming down just

2201
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,840
quite yet. That's what I'm waiting on.

2202
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,840
But essentially

2203
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,840
I'm about to have no

2204
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,840
major

2205
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,840
role

2206
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,840
at all. I'll just be full

2207
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,840
strummer.

2208
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,840
Please actually

2209
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,840
perish this so he doesn't get caught.

2210
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,840
Okay, there we go.

2211
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,840
Oh gosh,

2212
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,840
I don't know if I'm going to get all these.

2213
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,840
I hope to police tons around the map.

2214
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,840
But yeah, sorry

2215
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,840
I'm really not able to articulate

2216
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,840
quite well at the moment.

2217
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,840
Do you apologise?

2218
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Turns out if you didn't get enough sleep

2219
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,840
it affects your ability to communicate.

2220
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,840
Weflin love, thank you.

2221
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,840
I think

2222
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,840
I might call it at the two of remark.

2223
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,840
I'm trying my hardest

2224
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,840
to even speak. I is so

2225
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,840
hard right now.

2226
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,840
But thank you for understanding. Thank you for the tip as well.

2227
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,840
She

2228
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,840
No, she

2229
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
apparently doesn't know that

2230
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,840
she's not supposed to stream every single day.

2231
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,840
No, I think I like

2232
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,840
it. I like the consistency. I like

2233
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,840
the idea of you being like

2234
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,840
you know, like oh

2235
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,840
you know

2236
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
I fucking come on

2237
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,840
a sentence

2238
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,840
please. Oh the consistency is nice

2239
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,840
because like oh

2240
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,840
it's this time, Strong's was going to be on.

2241
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,840
I like that. I like the familiarity

2242
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,840
being like oh you know what

2243
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,840
I'm bored or I want to listen to something

2244
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,840
in the background while I work.

2245
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,840
Strong's was online, right? I'll have a

2246
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,840
we listen in type thing. I like that.

2247
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,840
There's like 6

2248
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,840
or 80 on the map. Oh thank goodness.

2249
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,840
If there's that many on the map

2250
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,840
I'm not stressed. Right. We'll level up.

2251
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,840
That's what I want to see.

2252
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,840
Sleep fun. No, no.

2253
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,840
Don't give me my money.

2254
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,840
I'll go off it too. How about that?

2255
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,840
Thank you Doomsday Dan

2256
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,840
for the tip. I'll

2257
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,840
go off it too. How about that?

2258
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,840
2 hour mark. I feel like 2 hours is fair.

2259
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,840
And then

2260
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,840
we'll do a Sonic Heroes

2261
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,840
Marathon

2262
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,840
and we'll finish it.

2263
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,840
Don't think I didn't spot this one.

2264
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,840
I might be delirious

2265
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,840
but I spotted that a mile off.

2266
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,840
It's nice

2267
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,840
being here with you every day. Well it's nice having

2268
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,840
you every day. I'm very lucky

2269
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,840
that

2270
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,840
you know even

2271
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,840
you know even though I'm a bit

2272
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,840
special I'm a bit different. You know what I'm saying?

2273
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,840
Can I go in please?

2274
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,840
Okay there we go.

2275
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,840
Strong's standard time

2276
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,840
honestly.

2277
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,840
That's nice.

2278
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,840
I don't feel

2279
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,840
pressure streaming.

2280
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,840
Oh I need to do this.

2281
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,840
Oh I messed up.

2282
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,840
I don't know. It's just such

2283
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,840
chill and pleasant

2284
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,840
time.

2285
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,840
I do speak on it often but I don't

2286
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,840
feel

2287
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,840
streaming daily is taking too much

2288
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,840
out of me. What it is

2289
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,840
is that

2290
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,840
things haven't calmed down

2291
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,840
because

2292
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,840
a new thing pops up and I'm like

2293
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,840
oh crap that's right.

2294
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,840
I

2295
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,840
said it a wee bit but

2296
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,840
the girls got a little

2297
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,840
sidetracked

2298
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,840
and the audios weren't really recorded

2299
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,840
in time for the editors to pick it up

2300
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,840
so then I had to kind of pick up a bit of it.

2301
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,840
Oh I see it.

2302
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,840
I see it.

2303
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,840
I was up editing

2304
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,840
my stuff and I've got zero stuff to do

2305
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,840
and

2306
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,840
the girls have over Emi, Mersi, Shibi

2307
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,840
and Asi should all have at least one audio

2308
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,840
up for this month but it's kind of

2309
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,840
those things where like I kind of really

2310
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,840
planned for it. The girls were having fun.

2311
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,840
Of course they got distracted. They're only human.

2312
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,840
I'm not going to be a weirdo and be mad at them

2313
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,840
or whatever like the fuck.

2314
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,840
Oh!

2315
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,840
Can I destroy it?

2316
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,840
No I can. Okay just be nice

2317
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,840
and careful.

2318
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,840
And then it's like yeah I had

2319
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,840
this stream plan come on

2320
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,840
and why am I flying?

2321
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
This is a fan!

2322
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,840
Oh my god wait

2323
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:48,840
the games

2324
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
registering me is falling

2325
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,840
no.

2326
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,840
Yeah this is the only place

2327
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,840
where I see it. I was here for a month

2328
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,840
I was actually here for a month.

2329
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,840
Feels good man. Sorry I just fell off the map there

2330
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,840
and just about did it again.

2331
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,840
Game?

2332
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Game doesn't like me.

2333
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,840
I keep it.

2334
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,840
I've never had so much issues playing Sonic Heroes

2335
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,840
but Chaotic I think that's what

2336
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,840
three instances now where it's been about

2337
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,840
hmm.

2338
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,840
And destroy it. That's 18.

2339
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,840
And then we've got 19, 20

2340
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,840
and 21 up ahead.

2341
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,840
Okay I was

2342
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,840
worried I wasn't going to reach that but I did.

2343
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
21.

2344
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,840
Put charming thing thank you to the donation.

2345
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,840
Thank you.

2346
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,840
I'll just get myself.

2347
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,840
Oh what was the audio theme?

2348
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,840
I might have been the writer for it.

2349
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,840
I'm so sad when

2350
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,840
August happens because

2351
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,840
August means I didn't write

2352
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,840
everything

2353
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,840
so I can't get the credit for writing something good.

2354
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,840
It was the weird girl one.

2355
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,840
There was two weird girl ones

2356
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,840
that month for her.

2357
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,840
But thank you for the five bully legends.

2358
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,840
Was it the one where the neighbour needs

2359
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,840
a liquid

2360
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,840
or was it

2361
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,840
Oh I wasn't paying attention. Jump.

2362
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,840
I can't

2363
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,840
sue.

2364
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,840
Hold on I need to actually

2365
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
use aimbot because I've only got two lives.

2366
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,840
What the heck is that?

2367
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,840
I'm holding.

2368
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,840
But yeah basically

2369
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,840
once August starts

2370
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,840
up like the August audio is coming out

2371
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,840
I didn't

2372
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,840
game.

2373
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,840
Hey game you know how you were supposed to

2374
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,840
propel me halfway across the map?

2375
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,840
Did you forget

2376
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,840
that detail or

2377
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,840
I

2378
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,840
have never perished so much in Sonic Heroes

2379
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,840
I'm all the way back here

2380
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,840
on the games test

2381
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,840
and me.

2382
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,840
It's literally test and medicals

2383
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,840
I'm all the way back here

2384
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,840
Game is asleep

2385
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,840
deprived of strong so I don't know

2386
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,840
I can

2387
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,840
skip these ones.

2388
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,840
Oh I'm gonna say it.

2389
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,840
The game is not game in.

2390
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,840
Todd wouldn't say

2391
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,840
it just worked.

2392
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,840
We do a little teasing

2393
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,840
we do.

2394
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,840
I still write all my

2395
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,840
own stuff but that's because

2396
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,840
I've lost them your honour.

2397
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,840
I'm gonna stay on like this

2398
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,840
I don't know why the beating would propel me forward.

2399
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,840
This is freaking

2400
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,840
adorable.

2401
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
Oh yeah for marriage you need to kiss me right now

2402
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,840
Thank you boy

2403
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,840
for the tip.

2404
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,840
And Brian for announcing

2405
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,840
I appreciate Brian in these parts.

2406
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Maybe I can get the one that's up ahead

2407
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,840
Whoa.

2408
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,840
Yay!

2409
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,840
Please do not throw me off the map this time

2410
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,840
I'm begging

2411
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,840
Don't throw me off the map

2412
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,840
Boom

2413
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,840
What's going on?

2414
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,840
Why are you putting me on him?

2415
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,840
It keeps putting me on the B

2416
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,840
I entered that

2417
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,840
as the crocodile and it keeps

2418
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,840
putting me on the B

2419
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,840
I think because I keep losing

2420
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,840
Speedy Gonzalez

2421
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,840
Honestly the game could throw me on any other day

2422
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,840
I'm like please not this day

2423
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,840
I've had no sleep over I think it's

2424
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,840
I don't know how long

2425
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,840
It must be over 30 hours at this point

2426
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,840
I've been awake

2427
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,840
Because a two hour nap unfortunately

2428
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,840
is not enough to replenish the

2429
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,840
the old juices the old brain waves

2430
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,840
It took me actually I edited

2431
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,840
a bonus

2432
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,840
like a subscriber special audio

2433
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,840
but

2434
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,840
again I don't know if I can upload it

2435
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,840
to YouTube right away until the warnings

2436
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,840
await purely because

2437
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
purely because because because

2438
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,840
because

2439
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,840
the audio

2440
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,840
is me sitting on the mic

2441
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,840
I'm like repeatedly sitting on the mic over and over

2442
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,840
I cannot see

2443
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,840
right okay this time he is fully

2444
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,840
on me we have all

2445
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,840
three of us together if this glitches out

2446
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,840
one more time I'm gonna cry because it really

2447
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,840
shouldn't

2448
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,840
I'm not sure what to do

2449
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,840
if it doesn't propel me forward I might

2450
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,840
can't be a framerate issue

2451
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,840
can he be

2452
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,840
it's a speed thing as well

2453
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,840
there there there oh we did it oh my god

2454
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,840
right we don't even have to do that section

2455
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,840
even

2456
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,840
every time a glitch happens this one here is the

2457
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,840
place of my head

2458
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,840
keep going forward because that's what I did back

2459
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,840
when I went through this level

2460
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,840
just don't breathe

2461
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,840
you'll be fine

2462
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,840

01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,840
I know what you want from me

2467
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,840

2468
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,840

2469
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,840

2470
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,840

2472
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,840

2477
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,840

01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,840

2492
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,840

01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,840

I'm very low IQ for this right now

2526
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,840

2527
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,840
I keep aiming for this one particular part

2528
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,840

2541
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,840

2548
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,840
espio literally me with

2549
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,840
the scrawny airplane

2550
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,840
would you still love me if I was an airplane

2551
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
I said I've just leaked

2552
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
my alternative

2553
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
outfit design it's actually a blackbird

2554
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,840
SR 71 that I just said its name twice

2555
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,840
it's either an SR 71 or it's a blackbird

2556
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,840
your choice that was terrible

2557
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,840
target destroyed

2558
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,840
target destroyed

2559
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:07,840
okay that was an absolute terrible fight airplane

2560
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
girl gen 2 is real

2561
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,840
oh my god I'm thinking

2562
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,840
oh we got the jungle man

2563
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,840
I would rage every day if you're an airplane

2564
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
I had the same weird

2565
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,840
Dr. Eggman

2566
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,840
he wouldn't do something like that

2567
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
right

2568
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
oh no the SR 71

2569
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
how can you get any more powerful

2570
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,840
well I honestly wouldn't mind entertaining

2571
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
an SR 71 gen girl

2572
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
I don't know maybe someone wants out of it

2573
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
if no one wants the alternative outfit I'll take it

2574
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,840
are we doing this or am I redirecting it to someone

2575
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,840
am I

2576
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,840
will I like read marshmallows for like a couple of minutes

2577
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,840
and then go pass out

2578
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,840
did you even read my crystal ball

2579
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,840
you have to be invisible espion

2580
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,840
what during this map

2581
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
like this

2582
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,840
I mean if it's easy peasy

2583
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,840
he's not even here

2584
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,840
I'm starving

2585
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,840
can't get it

2586
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,840
I suck

2587
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,840
I

2588
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,840
can't even

2589
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,840
I can hardly reach

2590
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,840
it's a stealth mission you can't be seen by the frog

2591
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
oh wait this entire thing's a stealth

2592
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
I had no idea

2593
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,840
that's actually such a cool concept

2594
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
I didn't even know they did that

2595
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,840
it says fly

2596
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,840
it says fly ahead

2597
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
I almost got baited

2598
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
I almost got baited

2599
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,840
I almost got baited so bad seeing that life up

2600
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,840
that's so this is so interesting

2601
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,840
oh hold on nope you can get me bitch

2602
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:43,840
look at that massive shuriken I can throw

2603
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,840
wow this is cool

2604
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
just don't get too close to the other frogs

2605
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
or it's ogre

2606
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,840
I like this

2607
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,840
there's so much croaking

2608
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,840
okay just throw me off the map it's fine I didn't want to play

2609
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,840
smile

2610
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,840
I could fart on this game sometimes I'm gonna be honest

2611
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,840
sometimes this game

2612
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,840
I've definitely have to admit

2613
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,840
I've never had more issues with like falling off the map

2614
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,840
on any team than this one

2615
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,840
and I've played like rows over and over and over and over again

2616
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,840
but this is like rough

2617
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,840
you have to fly over that one

2618
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,840
fly over it

2619
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,840
we going chaotic difficulty now

2620
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
I'm flying I'm flying

2621
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,840
are you joking

2622
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,840
this game has some bangers

2623
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
woohoo

2624
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,840
that's what I get for having nothing but the audacity

2625
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,840
to play this

2626
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,840
actually I really enjoy this game so it's not shit

2627
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,840
okay let's go

2628
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,840
let's do this one now

2629
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,840
because I've not done this one

2630
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,840
I've died so many times I couldn't have done all the path

2631
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,840
she didn't

2632
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,840
fly so good

2633
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:43,840
that shouldn't be an SR71 after all

2634
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,840
okay

2635
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,840
let's jump over this frog

2636
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,840
okay that was way better

2637
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
way better

2638
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,840
we have a poll in teleport

2639
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,840
that's not poll in teleport

2640
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,840
that's a poll in ledge

2641
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,840
hey there's a frog over there

2642
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,840
I love this game but the jank is so bad

2643
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,840
oh

2644
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:41,840
I remember you making me like SR71 and transforming me

2645
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,840
we should watch the you guys are asking if I wanted to

2646
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,840
oh I missed

2647
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,840
oh it's okay

2648
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,840
you would say that would be

2649
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
you adorable little thing you

2650
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,840
am I to fight

2651
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,840
feels like I'm not to fight anything honestly I'm here for

2652
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,840
I'm like we're a proper stealth

2653
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,840
oh no

2654
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,840
I want to be invisible on the flower

2655
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
woo

2656
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
how are you supposed to react to these bowls

2657
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,840
you come at me so fast

2658
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,840
don't murder char- wait you don't like char me

2659
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,840
does no one like char me

2660
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,840
I think he's

2661
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,840
so towards my goats of dwarves

2662
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
what was that

2663
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:42,840
I'm on a hole

2664
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,840
whoa

2665
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,840
oh

2666
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,840
oh we did it

2667
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,840
I didn't expect to do that

2668
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,840
stealth mission complete

2669
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,840
I've never played that one it was really interesting

2670
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,840
I didn't even notice that I like him

2671
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,840
he's so annoying

2672
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,840
even though hardcore sonic fans

2673
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,840
tend to find him annoying

2674
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,840
I find him rather adorable

2675
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,840
oh yeah

2676
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,840
he's just a silly kid

2677
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,840
I like his wee goggles and stuff

2678
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:15,840
like cute as well

2679
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,840
his wee avi or goggles

2680
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,840
did you know in terms of

2681
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,840
flight bumblebees shouldn't or something

2682
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,840
I can't remember

2683
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,840
maybe we could have done a little better

2684
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
aw yeah

2685
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
I would punch him if I could

2686
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,840
play some little freaking adorable thing

2687
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,840
I don't know what I would say the worst

2688
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,840
oh god no more missions

2689
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,840
uh-huh

2690
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,840
10 chow

2691
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,840
whoa

2692
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,840
oh no

2693
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,840
had to destroy these guys

2694
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,840
just go for it

2695
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,840
drat

2696
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,840
not good

2697
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,840
can you stun him

2698
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,840
yes thank you please stun him can you do anything

2699
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,840
what does

2700
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,840
I'm out of coins I think

2701
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,840
oh that worked

2702
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,840
I don't know how but it worked

2703
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,840
lost the one up there clearly

2704
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,840
one day I should remember what movie she wanted to watch

2705
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,840
I'm so tempted to

2706
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,840
redirect into someone and go to bed

2707
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,840
I'm so sorry

2708
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,840
unless I love streaming I'm absolutely

2709
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,840
out of it right now like I can

2710
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,840
do the Chacoa I've already got three

2711
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,840
I knew it I knew it was going to be up there

2712
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:50,840
I knew it the game was screaming

2713
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,840
the server was up there

2714
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,840
right let's get the last one

2715
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,840
and we'll wrap up okay

2716
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,840
whoa

2717
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,840
I forgot his height is different

2718
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
it's funny to see how

2719
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
team Sonic is normal and Shadow's hard

2720
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,840
but K.O.T. is just totally different

2721
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,840
you don't have to read them just go to sleep

2722
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
okay I finished this one

2723
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,840
and then we take a break

2724
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
and we all get a good night's sleep

2725
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,840
and I'm going to dream about

2726
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
about you hugging me

2727
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
and putting me to sleep because I'm fucking dying

2728
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
not to be dramatic or anything

2729
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
but I'm hanging by a thread

2730
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840

okay they're hiding them at the side of the screen

2751
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
so every time the camera

2752
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
is forced forward I will go to the

2753
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
side of the screen because you're getting too obvious

2754
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,840
right

2755
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840

01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,840
Nisturshems are everywhere

2761
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,840

2762
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,840

use their ultimates

2852
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,840
that's so weird hearing singing

2853
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,840
she sounds like a horse though

2854
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,840
I've never seen the speed character

2855
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,840

cream the horse

2866
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,840
last time I fought him he just jumped off the ledge manually

2867
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,840
that was awful

2868
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,840
what can that be all

2869
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,840
I honestly can't even survive

2870
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,840
oh we're in haunted mansion

2871
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,840
the jank has me dying

2872
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,840
I don't know how I could be so unlucky in one run

2873
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,840
I used up all my luck in Isaac

2874
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,840
obviously

2875
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,840
cause I've been flying off the map

2876
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,840
willy nilly

2877
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,840
oh I do love the music in this game

2878
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,840
my eyes are glazing over right now

2879
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,840
I actually can't even focus just to see

2880
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,840
right

2881
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,840
I assume if I do quit it saves my last progress

2882
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,840
fair trade honestly

2883
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,840
oh wow we're 73% of the way there

2884
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,840

2885
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,840
I don't think I can send it

2886
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,840
I tell you what we'll do a marathon and we'll actually do 100% on everyone

2887
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,840

01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,840

2889
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,840

2890
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,840

2907
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,840
oopsies

2908
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,840

2928
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:23,840

2930
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,840
about the situation

2931
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,840
um yeah I don't think my dad

2932
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,840
realised how much he's kind of pushed me

2933
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,840
because obviously I stream

2934
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,840
and then I work but I am now

2935
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,840
streaming working socialising

2936
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,840
and you know

2937
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,840
talking to my family and all that and it gets

2938
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,840
quite a lot like it

2939
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,840
definitely like increases

2940
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,840
the stress

2941
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,840
Emmys has an offline chat well I've shoved

2946
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,840
refunds I'm so sorry that I

2947
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,840
sounded so low energy it's because I was

2948
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,840
I'm gonna be honest I'm shattered

2949
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,840
I'm a puddle I'm a mess

2950
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,840
I do have good news about

2951
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,840
pheromone maxing however

2952
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,840
the pheromones

2953
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,840
have not been

2954
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,840
maxed at all I've been shivering every

2955
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,840
day like an actual normal person it's terrible

2956
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,840
absolute shocker behaviour

2957
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,840
cut back a little in the part you can make it up later

2958
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,840

2959
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,840

02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,840
missed out on endurance all that jazz I can go

02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,840
straight back to it but

2963
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,840
it's very exhausting

2964
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,840
socialising

2965
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,840
I don't know I find it a lot easier to

2966
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,840
not socialise smile

2967
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,840

02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,840
