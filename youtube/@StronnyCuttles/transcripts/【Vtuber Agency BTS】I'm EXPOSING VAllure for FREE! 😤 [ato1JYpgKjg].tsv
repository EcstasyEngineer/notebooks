472460	478220	because some people might want to, you know, get a 2.0 model, some people want to maybe start up as a new
478220	483580	each of our like type thing with a new persona like I just didn't want anyone to be at that stage
483580	492060	so I'll just say publicly now no one has been contacted for a thingy and but yes okay so that was
492060	496780	kind of the application process the interview process I'm more than happy for the girls to talk
496780	504060	about the interview process with me uh basically if you're interested in Vealer I was the barrier
504060	508780	okay I was the one reviewing you and looking at your content if you applied and I was like you
508780	518460	and you know um it's a bit it's a bit awkward I'll say I'll say this part out loud it was a bit
518460	528620	morally hmm because I was judging v-tubers that had way more streaming experience than me to be like
528620	534700	oh you're worthy to come in or not and it's like hmm it wasn't a nice feeling kind of like being like
534700	546380	no but can't want me um right okay questions most basic why are you called vealer now check out the
546380	554780	v at the start virtual as most agencies start with a v for virtual okay and then the a okay now
554780	564220	now put v and a together okay what do you get you get voice acting voice acting okay and the girls
564220	573180	are doing amateur voice acting audios oh my god oh my god you did it you did it you put it together
573900	579020	also wait wait wait hold on hold on let's read it together let's read it together v okay and then
579020	588540	imagine if there was an imaginary dash allure allure as if the girls were alluring oh my oh my god
589260	595100	put it together we've done it lads we've cracked the fucking case okay that's why it can't feel
595100	603100	allure there's no other thing to it okay I thought it was pretty self like explanatory but it was
603580	611100	okay it wasn't I was like ve allure okay ve allure but we got so many different pronunciations
611100	617100	I think if you have an american you're like ve allure and it's like I never really thought about
617100	624940	other accents saying it because obviously I want to accent but here you go um oh no questions why you call
624940	632300	vealer how hand on are you with the talents the talents can do whatever the fuck they want they
632300	638220	don't come to me for permission they don't have to come to me I want to do this I want to the only
638220	644140	thing they come to me with this they go I want a project I want this I want that I want this asset
644140	648620	then they come to me and I sugar mummy them and I'll be like there you go darlin all yours
648620	653180	hen poppy pop girls do what they want they do not need permission for in real life
654300	661340	hand cam streams for example none of that shit you guys have to understand we're all adults here
662300	669500	I am not going to treat anyone like they're a fucking child and they need permission from me to work
669500	675820	okay because as it stands they're you know doing work and streaming and all that you do not need permission
676380	687420	to okay so we don't do none of that shit around here one of the funniest comments I had seen so far
687420	695420	was uh management's gonna run away with the money aren't we oh you've caught me you've caught me

1195660	1200940	uh after this next batch because obviously i had to order it in a round because i didn't know them yet
1200940	1208460	there you go uh lore okay so this is this is super behind scene stuff so again squishy girl
1209420	1215500	conceptualize the lore so this is what an example of a lore story board looks like i'm giving
1215500	1221900	you the hints so this is a zura for example so as you can see uh the script right away the earth
1221900	1226940	was driven out baron and infancy then from dusk to darkness was the first family so this is called
1226940	1233820	concept art for the lore that was given to tea temachi temachi i would say timati but that's my accent
1234540	1242380	uh so that was this is these they're kind of it gives an idea of temachi watch oh temachi's in chat
1242380	1249180	temachi temachi temachi let's go squishy girls in chat but you know he's coming he's coming
1249180	1256300	okay but let's go temachi in chat so i'll give you a very quick example of what half wait hold on hold
1256300	1263100	on hold on let me cook let me cook let me cook let me cook so to give you a very quick example
1263100	1269740	i can only do it for my lore but here are the first three concept panels so gull did the concept
1269740	1277180	panels along with the script so concept one two and three and then temachi saw it and then come oh
1278140	1285420	it's a bit big hold on a minute hold on hold on uh uh uh it's very skull but let's be honest
1285420	1291740	this is never gonna be professional anyway ship one so temachi comes back with the sketch and you know
1293020	1299020	so literally we go from uh well the top corner one to to the sketch so she comes back with the
1299020	1305820	sketch absolutely beautiful garden beautiful beautiful and she and then with the approval of
1305820	1312860	the storyboard and the sketch then the full images come through and these come through all layered
1312860	1317660	these are all there the reason why we could get the little images to move about was because temachi
1317660	1323420	just worked so diligently so hard they were an absolute pleasure to work with i cannot recommend
1323420	1330940	temachi enough for like you know i gave her a lot of work like i could i could you know i was
1330940	1335660	insane work but as you can see from the finished result of the lores temachi
1340140	1346620	and beautiful that i look five star meal all the michelin stars or however they do it actually
1346620	1351900	i don't know how michelin stars work but yes so that's the behind the scenes of kind of the
1351900	1358940	development of the lore so again squishy gull not only did he do the storyboard he also
1358940	1363500	did the scripts in the background lores of the girls but i will come back to the development
1363500	1371100	of the girls very shortly um if you didn't know the merches are now out for the girls but again
1371100	1378220	in order to help artists it's so to make things such a smooth process behind the scenes um
1379900	1388220	having a concept artist to give the actual artists an idea of what you want helps so i hope i'm
1388220	1396380	not spoiling the merch that's coming out but this is a zura a little aces concept these are concepts
1396380	1402620	of the merchandise that you see on ubu market right now i'll talk about now um and then a little
1402620	1409580	mersey and shibi and but yeah again these are just concepts a beautiful behind the scenes stuff
1409580	1415500	it's really nice getting a thingy a little thingy so early development okay now now you're
1415500	1419100	going to start cringing at a few of the things that come up shortly but
1423820	1433260	um please please read please read thank you for reading uh if we need to hire talent managers
1433260	1440380	we will open a position i am so thankful for everyone applying but for god's sake some of you
1440380	1450220	are glowing for grooming the girls i i kid you not i've had some emails that are like hi uh i want
1450220	1457980	to be a talent manager nay portfolio nay history nay evidence of anything nay like nay communication
1458540	1462700	i'm so thankful you want to work for the girls i'm so thankful you want to groom them because you
1462700	1470060	like them that much my guy this agency we groom you full stop that's the sense okay so nice
1470060	1479020	try but if i need talent managers i'll post it on the website for the jobs that we need right okay this
1479020	1484620	is where the cringe comes in this is where the really the developmental cringe comes in okay
1486460	1490700	so i'm gonna read it out to you don't worry if you can't read neither can i but i'll try my best to read it out
1493180	1499340	so when it comes to concepts okay as you'll notice these girls don't have names
1500060	1506940	because because the girls started without names that's how it is so for the lore for girl one
1506940	1512940	it was it was the best we got to hang out together we ordered food and watch anime all snuggled up
1512940	1516780	i couldn't have asked for anything more that night it was a shame that the truth never came out
1516780	1523100	that i could never tell my redacted that i love him before it was too late it's not fair now i'm some
1523100	1527100	what and now i'm somewhere i don't recognize and i'll never see him again you'll still watch over me
1527100	1533420	from where you are now though hmm wonder wonder who that is um but these are kind of description
1533420	1543260	lores very quick description okay uh girl lore two um when there's no one around to spoil what
1543260	1549580	am i gonna do with myself i've got no purpose if i don't have a a sweetheart to show my love okay
1549580	1557020	yeah that was that was a zura that was a zura that's where she started from see a zura was giving
1557020	1561580	more of a kind of servant goddess role but that definitely didn't really come into play um
1562540	1567260	mersey ostempai i know you're around here you're playing a game with me aren't you thinking you
1567260	1573820	can take me to an unfamiliar surrounding so i'd stop news flash baby i love you far too much to
1573820	1578460	ever give up the chase isn't it fun when your heart is practically beaten out of your chest
1578940	1586220	manik i'd do manic laughter but mersey absolutely fucking uh she mugs me with her laugh oh wait
1586220	1590220	you're not senpai but you could be from the one so you know if you don't know mersey kind of
1592140	1596860	you know you know how it goes with them four four
1599500	1607580	four okay four i have you're gonna find out why four is so confusing four is icy
1608460	1612700	i quit whoever made this game who even made this game and i read that wrong
1612700	1616540	whoever even made this game in the first place what's the point in putting achievements in a game
1616540	1621740	if only 0.2 percent of the player base can even achieve it screw this i'm going on a really
1623020	1628300	a website okay now what's the category tonight oh let's do a random roulette our discord okay
1630220	1636460	as you can see aces come a very long way okay that's not aces lore at all that's not a concept
1636460	1643660	we're not even there okay lore five i cannot for the life of me understand how guys work how
1643660	1651180	do their brains even function if only there is some sort of way i could get them to be truthful
1651180	1660300	with me um and yeah so i always started with a hypno theme obviously i got to pick what the
1660300	1665260	fuck i want to be because i was there from the start i was always gonna have hypno uh i just
1665260	1670780	didn't know what angle we were going for and then uh i got conceptualized and wanting to kill all
1670780	1675980	of humanity so yeah i didn't do that part by the way before you're like oh my god you're killing
1675980	1687820	now uh no sorry i'm rubbing my face heat and then six um six uh it should be yeah um i've had it
1687820	1691740	bunny boys are pathetic they can never keep up with me and i don't know why i bother wasting my
1691740	1696460	time i just need something different human males surely can keep up with this stamina of
1696460	1701020	my needs type thing okay so that's how the girls started okay they all started deeply departed
1702940	1709820	so that's it all right okay this is a really fun this is i hated naming everyone i hated it i
1709820	1715740	hated it the the reason why you don't see emmy bezu right now is because emmy bezu was named
1715740	1724300	correctly azura you were a nightmare to name oh my god i went through so many names i literally
1724300	1731660	came up with stacey milkerton azura you were so hard to name for no reason you can literally
1731660	1737660	see how desperate i was getting through your name i was like stacey milkerton miss milkerton
1737660	1743820	milfoo pillow show show means darling in french yeah right she's a goat god
1744780	1754060	fawness inis milfoo inis milf shoe milf is in milf for you fondula fondula bosom
1754060	1760380	azura daily which is the wrong spelling in french and then finally we got to azura delay
1760380	1767340	oh my god do you know do you see the techniques to fondula bosom as well that's because i approved
1768060	1775500	that name for azura as fondula bosom what was i thinking oh right
1777660	1781100	okay now this one's about this is a real behind the scenes lore
1782060	1791900	mersey was originally stavitha brave brave what was i thinking and then if she was eastern european
1791900	1799500	we were going to change it to slavitha what was that smoton and then i approved the name
1799500	1805900	karam bit so instead of karam bit as a sharp weapon bit in french
1810060	1817340	of a male is the literal translation so the fun fact is that it's not a fun fact i'm such a
1817340	1825820	dumbass karam's name got past development so mersey was called karam until about a month ago
1825820	1833660	it was awful absolutely awful don't let me cook ever again i'm not naming anyone after this
1834940	1844620	right acy acy's a lie do you want to know what acy's real name was joy stick with an i
1845340	1850780	acy was not developed as a polar bear i'm going to show you her developmental are very shortly
1850780	1860620	her name was joy stick yes that's true now acy umka is russian unbelievably what are the odds
1860620	1865900	because acy does speak russian but our concept did name was always acy we liked acy from the star
1865900	1873500	okay we liked acy from the star so it was acy umka which i think means bear or paw and
1873500	1877740	russian i can't remember it's one or the other something like that and then acy's show
1878700	1885020	um for acy hot as in opposites but she was always going to be a polar bear
1885900	1894220	uh and then we got bandar like bandar is that like a kind of mythological angle
1895340	1901900	and then we got acy snow paws and i was like that's absolutely adorable i love it it's easy to
1901900	1907660	remember like i know some people are dogging on the names like i'm sorry but we're in english
1907660	1914860	speaking agency i don't see the point of having like yuku solavia and acy name like in japanese
1914860	1922380	i just i'm like i'm not gonna remember it joy stick chod um me i was pretty quick i knew i was
1922380	1926860	going to be strongy off the bat i knew i was going to name myself after my dad's gamer tag strongium
1926860	1931100	it's not his actual gamer tag before anyone worries that like it's a literal thing don't worry
1931100	1935340	i was always going to be strongy but it was like i don't know where 365 i actually don't remember
1935340	1941740	365 at all don't remember it spiral swirl notice the check mark against swirl that's because i approved
1941740	1946060	it and then you know i was a cutler fish and i was like you know what strongy calls locket and boys
1946620	1951260	and then she be because of her shabari rope she was always going to be she be like she be
1952300	1958460	um and then we really liked cotton but obviously there's a you know cotton tails a
1958460	1966620	vea so we didn't want to step on anyone's tail you know i'm shining um so we got cotton bud
1966620	1972140	and then we got cotton more but that didn't work and then we got cotton bum and then we're like
1972140	1976060	that makes perfect sense because she has a tail if you didn't know three members of veal or have a tail
1976940	1981900	she's a distant relative yeah honestly it's fine we were not wanting to step on anyone name wise
1982540	1986380	but yeah as i said emi is not here because emi's name got nailed off the bat i don't care what
1986380	1990540	anyone says i have never named someone more perfect than emi but i promise you i'm not naming anyone else
1990540	1997580	after this because uh i people are kind of like oh why why the french route um i don't know i think
1997580	2009500	it's pretty easy to remember everyone's name like but clap along with me chat emi ac gb strongy merci
2010300	2017820	that's a rough like these names are not hard to freaking remember in my opinion okay so
2019180	2027100	yeah um okay this is just a bit uh feedback if anyone reaches out to the emails uh the dev team get
2027100	2032460	back to me a lot um if you are applying to be an editor some people do so submit it we're always
2032460	2038940	kind of looking for clippers editors so you can submit yourself if you apply and be like hey i want
2038940	2046700	to be an editor right and you don't attach a portfolio or any evidence history of editing
2046700	2053820	or a youtube where you've done like a playlist of edits bro we're not gonna reply you're wasting
2053820	2061100	your time you need apply yeah do not apply with fondle it's crazy right right don't it right i know
2061100	2067820	it was a bad name okay let me let me care um we've had some music creators reach out that's fantastic
2067820	2074300	that do original songs so for the vealer members that want to pursue um singing uh there might be
2074300	2079020	original songs coming out uh there's a few song covers i'm gonna try and i think shivi has an
2079020	2083900	interest i'm gonna try and poke zura to do some song covers or maybe some lullabies because her voice
2083900	2092140	is just for it and uh hot to the cleavage right enough to i tried my best but zura was hard to
2092140	2103020	name but come on zura duly literally um goddess of milk if you will um oh this is the most embarrassing part
2105100	2111500	the first name a concept for the agency was vee sucky and now we are all succubus
2111660	2119500	and the motto would you survive if you met one of us
2122300	2128460	like so the concept was like succubus blood was like seeping into these girls somehow
2129420	2135820	because i don't like when uh vtuber stories like all connect like me and icy would never meet
2135820	2140700	because i'm in the water and she's on land type thing like i don't like when agencies like force the
2140700	2148780	lord to come together so a concept of that and i was like no we're not so before anyone makes fun
2148780	2155740	of veal lord veal lord terrible name we could have been vee sucky okay as in short for virtual
2155740	2164300	succubus so uh i will not be taking any statements and things okay okay you're all done okay this is
2164300	2170540	just a fun behind the scenes special shout out to yumi yumi works they are magnificent and made
2170540	2175660	all of our loading screens as you can see these are just the concepts but they're still stunning
2175660	2184380	and it's nice to see behind the scenes stuff but um mercedes was influenced by the joker being surrounded
2184380	2194060	by knives in the batman scene unironically ac if you didn't catch ac's um loading screen is a bit
2194060	2206860	melo melakoli melakoli um where the a the borealis that comes up lights up her thingy but hers is
2206860	2215420	a bit more sad because she's just left her polar bear family mel melakolic isn't colic when babies are crying
2216620	2222140	aurora borealis i always want to say ariola borealis and i'm like i'm pretty sure that means a nip but
2222140	2228380	i'm trying i'm trying bruv uh she be nailed off the bat um i wanted everyone's mascot to be a part
2228380	2232700	of the loading screen because i just find that stuff adorable and yes veal lord did premake all the
2232700	2238380	mascots uh emmy uh elected to change hers absolutely fine no problems like we're not a
2238380	2242220	dictating agency the girls can come to me and be like i didn't like that i want something else yeah
2242220	2249900	that's fine um uh azura you'll notice did get a new scene that she used on debut um
2249900	2257260	um but yeah this is just behind the scenes kind of this is the oh my god it's tempa fish uh surprise
2257260	2261900	you know how on debut i was like i have ace more clubs planned with other vtubers yes well tempa
2261900	2268780	fish is one of them um but yes this is just kind of behind the scenes art just to see how it comes
2268780	2276860	together nah right okay okay this next step so everyone likes the designs yeah all the designs
2277100	2280780	ten over ten aren't they oh we just love the design we did not
2287180	2294700	we did not look like how we look no okay we do not look like how we look no
2295580	2306620	yeah yikes now emmy and azura emmy and azura yeah uh i just yeah so as you can see ac isn't
2306620	2313740	even in the lineup yet five is me uh i always had bunch uh double bunches in my hair so i have
2313740	2319180	two bunches in my hair like the seashells are just accessories but there's actually two bubbles but
2319180	2330540	yeah sheebie was also with uh triple seas uh azura and thingy but then you know things changed
2330540	2338860	so then the next lineup were like right change up next lineup acsies with us let's go um
2340940	2345660	uh mersey's hair has changed so she no longer has drills
2345660	2351420	uh i've changed a bit i've got like these weird spirals in my hair but i quite like that
2351420	2358300	it's quite unique uh sheebie is still purple we're changing you but we do have ac developed
2358300	2363660	okay we have ac developed now okay change again right body type change on sheebie
2363660	2369660	uh strone complete change on strone mersey again still the wrong hair color
2370380	2380220	and then next okay let's try again and as you can see heights were established and names were
2380220	2387740	established but my height got changed sheebie's got changed azura became taller because we made her
2387740	2394300	a giant test if you didn't know azura can be as tall as a skyscraper now there's not an
2394300	2402380	definite height but yeah um mersey's coming out with a short very shortly about her being
2402380	2408940	blonde you'll like it um and then here we go big changes on me and sheebie at the same time
2410700	2418540	so sheebie got her hair spirals um her ears concepted and then i started to come to life
2419100	2422860	um as you can see i have little shoesies on the shoesies got taken away
2423580	2427180	why am i in a different style where i had to go a different concept ours because we were
2427180	2433580	struggling at the time um and then eventually ac was getting developed so this that was her
2433580	2439420	first development footage of her model that kind of transition you see there as you see mersey's hair
2439420	2444700	is still wrong they took your kicks i know they yanked my shoes give me them back
2446220	2452220	actually oh my god i should be like right there we go so we're going to take it from the top
2453500	2458780	the first girl developed uh what am i doing for time oh i'm actually not doing bad for time
2458780	2465500	let's go let's go that's what i'm talking about um i was good i was good uh right
2465500	2474940	we're going to take it from this top emi was the first conceptualized vealer girl okay but she
2474940	2479100	didn't look like that at the start boom oh wait wrong one wrong one hold on hold on out wait
2479180	2483180	wait hold on hold on hold on hold on the wrong one don't don't like don't like no no no right
2483180	2489500	there we go boom this is the first official concept of emi
2491580	2494780	yeah that's what emi emi looks like at the start
2496860	2503420	you can kind of see it the she's got the sneakers she's got the the hoodie the hair's orange
2504060	2511340	but uh it's giving it's giving best friendo next door it's not giving emi isn't
2511980	2518300	frankie oh honestly yeah i said squish her down make her a wee one so then we got her
2518300	2523980	squished down uh we're starting to get her definitely getting her silhouette going on but no
2523980	2531260	pins we do have her uh how you call them uh pumpkins in her hair have been established at
2531260	2538620	this point yeah she got hydraulic pressed and then we're like and back to the drawing board
2538620	2545740	go next what i was like hold on a minute hold on a minute we're cooking we are cooking by gas okay
2546460	2551180	so we were getting very close as you can see by this design very very close in the concept art
2551740	2557820	so then we gave her the old overwatch skin if you don't know overwatch sell skins by
2557820	2564620	recoloring them she got recolored uh there we go that was it that was it boom recolored
2564620	2572460	and just like that there's emi that's emi there's emi there she is uh so gave her the old
2572460	2581340	overwatch skin color change and boom and then there is some behind scenes banner this commission
2581340	2587980	wasn't able to be finished em but i thought show it off anyway this is by papa perrito
2588780	2595420	incredibly good artist sadly ran out of time due to life constraints however i know you won't be able
2595420	2600620	to tell but this was originally going to be your banner and it's actually a skyrim reference sweet
2600620	2605820	mother sweet mother sent your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood
2605820	2614140	and fear it is the sacrament done to summon the night mother satan that was her reference for the
2614140	2623340	banner okay up next azura or should i say they say milkerton uh here we go boom okay so that
2623340	2629660	was her name hardy hardy hard yeah yeah i'm glad it name in so this was her banner concept that ended
2629660	2636700	up becoming her loading screen this is our banner concept it didn't get finished but this is now her
2636700	2650300	new loading fonder the bosom so development on azura was so simple it was easy peasy lemon
2650300	2657420	so easy we had thick goddess straight from the bat we knew we wanted her thick we had horns
2658380	2665420	concept art said fantastic because this is what we got next boom she's already there you know
2665420	2672300	what's different but look at this azura azura was nailed off the bat the most simplest easiest
2673420	2678620	design honestly so as you can see she's pretty much there so as we progress right something's not
2678620	2688220	right with the legs right okay boom we've now got stirrup thigh highs you are welcome chocolate
2688220	2697580	stirrup thigh high stye words and stuff okay right right what's what's missing hold on what's
2697580	2703660	missing something's not quite finished with her markings yes that makes sense she's a goddess add
2703660	2711660	them markings so nose arm thigh add them markings okay okay we're kicking work again we're kicking
2712460	2716380	and then oh what was that did you see that did you see that change on the thigh boom
2717020	2722620	little little thigh things going on beautiful beautiful gorgeous and then next next next what's
2722620	2728860	next uh i think that's actually an older one there and i was just thinking that and then boom
2729500	2738300	she got her toe rings added let's go toe rings and then we have azura there we go she was uh
2739180	2740460	i was going to be a milk god
2742860	2751820	night is it very very simplistic very easy very quick uh right please hold on to your hats
2752620	2769180	because i present to you ac no not that that's that's ac uh yeah that was ac um enjoy
2770060	2784860	okay ac was conceptualized to be an insomniatic gamer okay we kept the insomniatic
2784860	2791580	vibes because if you didn't know polar bears do not hibernate unless they're pregnant so if
2792220	2797980	see y'all better you better jump off my daughter right now okay she doesn't need to hibernate
2799180	2805420	however please i would like to draw your attention to the pause see those neon blue pause
2805420	2812940	they were supposed to follow her around polar bear pause oh okay so we took it from there we took
2812940	2818460	it from there yeah that's actually that's where we started and then we got the polar bear pause
2818460	2825580	added in these antenna things and it just wasn't a looking mate wasn't a wasn't a congealing and then
2825580	2829740	look at that look at the bell the belly button please analyze the belly button for me because
2829740	2837660	there's a little polar bear piercing on her stomach uh yeah originally she was to have a wee person
2837660	2845180	and uh both the concept artist and i were like look it's not working out we're gonna need to be
2845180	2853260	we're gonna need gonna need you to cook so whoa we're changing it up so ac had little
2853260	2858460	little braids little tribal braids and she's freaking adorable and the top of her shirt's all
2858460	2863180	ripped up but she has like big baggy sleeves so it's getting very cute it does look a bit sleep
2863180	2867980	whereas but she had a little piercing as well her little tummy pierce and we're getting a bit
2867980	2875180	closer to ice save you know today and then okay we got another design we've taken away the long
2875180	2881660	sleeve so we're not quite there yet we're not quite there yet hold on hold on okay okay we're
2881660	2887180	getting a bit more primal now look at the gloves gloves glove check glove check okay gloves are on
2887180	2896300	check well they wear gloves at the start but then they became paws mm-hmm so we had a little comparison
2896300	2906220	and then whoa hold on hold on we have paws established we have an ace tape design established
2906940	2914220	very bear esque and then yeah we got we got there so she has her insomniatic eyes on she has
2914220	2919580	a toggle for insomniatic eyes but she's insomniatic but take a look at her feet they're so different
2920860	2926620	she had open toe boots she had her little toes out but you can see she definitely has clothes at
2926620	2930460	this part of development but she has scars all over her ripped clothing that kind of thing
2930460	2936780	and and if you really want to zoom in she actually has a tiny tiny cleavage lane because
2936780	2944860	she has a little something there emi is true petan but ac has just a just a little hint of something
2944860	2950620	you know uh oh this shouldn't be in the middle of it but this was her banner concept because
2950620	2958460	she's a little insomniac okay she's a little insomniac she's so tired she's up at 3am so this
2958460	2963580	was her banner but it didn't get finished uh due to time constraints absolutely no fall of
2963580	2969900	papaparito at all he was fantastic this very adorable banner and yeah as i said the name concepts
2969900	2978140	and then this was her first model uh draft not model sorry like the the the the draft of the model
2979020	2983660	and we were like or was it no that what that was the first draft and we're like
2984540	2991740	get those thighs thicker and squish her please and then we squished her down got nice and
2991740	3001740	squished um and then there's isy uh and yeah where she is that's isy cool she was definitely
3001740	3009420	a bit more difficult in development just because we i gave the wrong prompts to the concept artist
3009420	3017420	so that's on me so she took a wee bit longer to get there okay uh for mercy uh please remember
3017420	3022940	her code name was karam i may accidentally refer to her as karam i've called her karam for an
3022940	3028860	entire year please understand please forgive okay this was a banner that was supposed to be
3030140	3035740	for mercy um it was going to be darkened out and shadowed a lot more but obviously there was
3035740	3045260	a bit insidiousness and in background and uh going on but yes so originally
3046860	3053820	originally mercy had twin tails uh or drills kind of looking thing going on
3055020	3060780	um but she always had her bow her stomach wasn't showing actually just her mid drift i
3060780	3069980	believe it's a terminology for that um i stole her wig honestly um but yeah uh we definitely were
3069980	3080300	really close to mercy right from the start but she was blonde would it be blonde i know um and then
3080300	3090620	we showed her stomach and it was like okay okay okay and then we got blonde and alterations
3090620	3098300	in comparison but now obviously you've seen her purple so she's purple you know what i'm saying
3098300	3105900	her hair is purple uh but now that i see blonde mercy it does not like it looks wrong to me because
3105900	3113900	it's like that's not how it should be looking um and then we got purple eyes here we're the purple
3113900	3123020	beam right now and then boom we got her mercy starts i've not called her karan by accident in so long
3125180	3129580	but yeah there you go she was relatively there she was there from the start honestly
3129580	3138460	not too much of a issue you know you can see the comparison um shebe shebe i'm sorry to expose
3138460	3149260	you like this this is the first sign of shebe i'm sorry okay we thought of a rabbit with her ears
3149260	3161020	up okay we're sorry i'm sorry okay i'm sorry i'm sorry okay so you were supposed to have mercy
3161020	3169500	no not fondle of booze i'm this is shebe cotton boom okay we didn't go with the design before
3169500	3179820	anyone said we didn't go with the design relax who said finnaf bonnie that's awful don't speak for
3179820	3190140	the rest of the stream we didn't go for the design so um azura was already established to be purple
3190140	3198860	at this point so we were changing the body tape and then the body tape got changed so she became like
3198860	3206460	the stereotypical milk body type of double bander hips um and then but we're still purple and we were having
3207660	3212860	i'll be honest this was getting really frustration frustration lovely this was getting really
3212860	3218140	frustrating at this point in development shebe we had been cooking for a bit and we were really
3218140	3227100	struggling like but then we had i don't think these are in order no they're not oh well hey ho so
3227980	3233020	we were having color palette issues i liked the outfit i liked everything about it but the hair the color
3233020	3239260	palette was just not working so i went to a concept artist to very quickly give me a different
3239260	3244940	pose and we went with two hairstyles let's say give me this hairstyle uh she looks like a
3244940	3249580	fucking giraffe so no we didn't go with a bloody pony tail she looks like some sort of horse a
3249580	3256380	cheval like umpard like i didn't want a horse vtuber if you want a horse vtuber we ain't the agency
3256380	3262620	for you because i'm not interested in horse girls okay but we got the drills and if you didn't know
3262620	3268780	shebe's drills actually get more red at the bottom uh it's a very small detail very small detail come
3268780	3274140	ride this pony honestly oh that's why you've got a raiden crop you're a secret horse vtuber all along
3274220	3280860	shebe i can't believe it got you in 4k but yeah um as you can see the
3282700	3288380	gear um it was always a part like the anklet the hand cuffs were always going to be a part of
3288380	3296620	her design and then we got our first model back and we were like uh excuse me where's the thickness
3296620	3303980	like give a sound like this and then you know came along and then hey oh it's so easy easy not
3303980	3313260	it's not the main focus not the main focus okay this was her banner concept uh again banner concept
3313260	3319580	my legs are long these are your banner concepts but uh unfortunately didn't make it to finalize production
3319580	3324060	but this was to be the banner it's probably a bit too much now that i'm looking at it a bit a bit too
3324140	3328540	a bit too spacey a bit too spacey for youtube was here
3330220	3338380	right my turn womp womp womp there's strong air
3342780	3348940	womp womp there's me strong zoop there we are that's me at the start of development do you like it
3348940	3356060	what do you think is it good is it peak quick i'm gonna very quickly go get a cool look
3356060	3360460	because my voice is dying give me one second i know streamers are supposed to mute with the
3360780	3365980	oh i just i don't know if you heard me stand on that but i don't streamers are supposed to mute
3380060	3383580	i stopped my tool when i left the room that actually really hurt
3383740	3391100	okay so yeah uh my development was different because i was allowed to dictate my design
3391100	3398140	okay so we started with hypnosis and then i was a little splatoon squiddle fish ms paint looking
3398140	3405180	ass you don't watch that you're done you're done okay so i was a squiddle and then so this design
3405180	3409660	don't write this design off i want to develop this further i love the color scheme i love the
3409660	3415420	bikini type thing going on um the only thing that kill oh wait i need to open my collar
3416620	3423820	the only thing like i think this might be an all outfit all hairstyle because i love those like cat ear
3423820	3428380	looking things on me and i'll have my little shell on my hair at this point zelda looking ass
3429740	3435580	no don't insult her i think it's really good i really like this design i like the color scheme
3435580	3441260	with the browns and the kind of black thing going on it's good it's good you know lung cook lung cook
3443500	3451100	so i originally wasn't going to have any booba basically because um but then that got changed
3451100	3458940	because i technically have five children with emi and aise and azura and merese and shivi so i
3458940	3465180	originally didn't have any chest size but then we retcon that because technically uh yeah very big on
3465180	3472300	the dumpy so i had clocks for hypnosis to hang off i always had hypnosis from the star and then
3472300	3483260	changed the color a bit but then i looked like an xbox so i was like and then it's me but that wasn't
3483820	3490300	this shouldn't be here we're still a bit too early because uh there's one more design that we didn't
3490300	3498460	finish off this is Celtic me um i definitely am getting an alternative outfit of Celtic me because
3499420	3505340	i know it might be hard to tell with the accent and all but i'm just a wee bit Scottish but i try and
3505340	3510940	annunciate and make sure you guys can understand me so yeah i don't talk the way like you know
3510940	3516540	my accent but i'm definitely getting this developed further the hair uh i like big hair so i'm
3516540	3520380	probably not going to keep that hairstyle going on but i had like a little ears going on little
3520380	3526940	squiddle ears um but that got developed a bit more this honestly looks kind of a bit reny
3526940	3531740	reny thorns but if you look at that this is like very Celtic origin and like little symbolism
3531740	3537740	and that that definitely going to develop this because uh it's good but it wasn't what i wanted the
3539340	3545820	the default to be the default that's the word and so yeah i got a thingy my hair probably
3545820	3551500	changed that oh i got that foreign to the Celtic design oh my god i completely forgot
3552780	3561100	well there's my Celtic there's my next outfit boys uh but yeah very very squiddle very Celtic here um
3562780	3572380	yeah uh oh i'm on the wrong one hold on but yes um i was presented with my squiddle eyes here
3572380	3577660	and i actually have a bikini toggle obviously i'm not gonna do it right now because there's not
3577660	3582940	the time for it but i have a pair lesson i have tape over me but you see like i technically have
3582940	3592380	tape over my bits my little bits but if i go back a few um yeah i really like this Celtic warrior
3592380	3597820	one because i can just i'll just talk about the battle of bannockburn all the time because why not
3597900	3603660	but yeah you can definitely see me starting to come to life here uh like the shell of my hair i did
3603660	3612700	have two bunches but they weren't as big like i have really big bunches um got like and then my eyes
3612700	3620220	so my default eyes were going to be swirls but then i got my squiddle eyes because i'm a cuttlefish
3620220	3625740	i'm a cephalopod yeah and then i finally came to there's me
3633500	3638860	uh and then of course finished models okay i'll tell you some hidden things
3640700	3645180	i'm gonna tell you some hidden things now this is this is what agencies kind of have to deal
3645180	3652700	with behind the scenes azura was conceptualized black okay as a chocolate to be tuber if you will
3652700	3662860	okay however i came to the horrible realization i can't put a white girl on azura oh my fucking god
3662860	3670220	so azura in development was made racially ambiguous now i apologize for such terminology
3670220	3676620	but that's just how it is that's how the facts are so she was made racially ambiguous if you look
3676620	3682940	back in some of the promotional models and artworks you'll notice how pale she was that's because we
3682940	3689500	had to make her ambiguous okay then azura came aboard and i was like chocolate fire right now
3690220	3696940	like get on it so yes her finalize let's zoom in a little bit on the finalized model
3697020	3701500	just to highlight a few things that are going on with her beautiful design so if you didn't know
3701500	3709660	very quickly azura is your mummy quite literally lower wise she's your mama she is the goddess of fertility
3709660	3716940	on planet earth you heard that right but she didn't want to go to the heavens with her family
3716940	3726140	she wanted to stay among the humans so she has retained some of her powers as a god okay so she
3726140	3732380	has the power of flight believe it or not so she's gonna fly on my deck um i shouldn't have said that i'm sorry
3734860	3741420	she also has healing properties uh with her milk
3744700	3751660	yeah uh she can also be a giant ass as tall as a skyscraper these markings are made from when she
3751660	3757420	founded civilization she has painted nails painted toes she has toe rings on her index toes
3758060	3766380	a little veil over her thigh highs veil in the head all it just hips for days like definitely
3766380	3772620	kind of the the birthing hips because she birthed humanity like that's the kind of thing going on so
3773260	3781340	yeah definitely her design was absolutely gorgeous um we had quite a lot of issues i ordered the
3781340	3788220	girls quite a few fan arts once we had the designs finalized there was a lot of issues with artists not
3788220	3794860	understanding the white is her goat ears and they were drawing her like the star wars characters
3794860	3801340	you know those characters that have the like the thing on the front of them we got a lot of artwork
3801340	3808460	of that and i had to send back and be like no she's a goat so go go uh not door like that thanks
3809420	3815980	um asical she's got scars which is a very unique element to her she also has a mouth
3816540	3829340	fang not a tooth fang a mouth fang okay mouth fang she has scars um she has ripped clothing um
3829340	3837420	she also has steel toe capped boots so you know she's safe for work 100% safe for work character
3837420	3844540	she got them steel toe boots on okay um what other attributes she has a tail oh yeah uh azura
3844540	3854060	has a tail and i say has a tail um me oh look at me so i if you didn't know i am wearing a yukata
3854060	3860220	as a nod to japanese culture because without japanese culture truly as v-tubers we would
3860220	3867260	not be here right now let's not pretend otherwise oh i forgot my cover up over my
3867260	3875820	cross i am so sorry i forgot about that part of my design uh i literally have
3887500	3894140	okay i'm sorry i'm sorry but anyway i'm in a yukata uh it's pearlescent so it shimmers as i move
3894140	3900860	my shells on my head also are pearlescent i'm so sorry i'm gonna just take a little drink of my cola
3905420	3912940	oops but yes i'm a new cat as a nod to japanese culture um for my next alternative i almost likely
3912940	3922060	do a scottish Celtic type origin uh we can see um uh squid eyes yep i am a cuttlefish i have cuttlefish
3922060	3929020	eyeballs uh when we released the eye previews people were surprised but for me if v-tubers
3929020	3936460	just have a regular pupil i sleep i'm sorry but it's like one of the most simplistic things
3936460	3947740	you can design if you give someone a basic pupil as a vtuber boring out i'm sorry that's just my
3947740	3953420	opinion uh it was one of the first notes that i gave to the concept artist do not give me a regular
3953420	3960140	pupil i will perish uh again same with like fingernail designs etc i have french tip uh
3960860	3967100	manicure pedicure the girls all have painted nails mercy also has band aids on her fingers for example
3967660	3977020	um these small things like add up definitely um yeah like i this is just my opinion but i think
3977020	3984700	the there's nothing too if a design gets too complex on a vtuber this is just my opinion as well my
3984700	3988860	opinion just don't do not fucking represent the company as a whole it's just me being
3989980	3995660	talking at mass okay but um like if the designs get too complicated like i don't know i can't remember
3995660	4000620	what the fucking uh things call but like you know those japanese idol skirts where there's like three
4000620	4005660	different meshes and layers and designs and patterns going on i'm like if you start getting two
4005660	4011180	things you're getting a fan art no one's gonna recognize you because you're x y z like i'm sorry
4011180	4016940	but you can't tell me that our designs look any and remotely similar to clutter that's the word cluttered
4016940	4024140	if the designs are too cluttered please think of the fan art literally like i'd say mercy is the most
4025340	4032220	she doesn't have a cover up we'll enjoy mercy from here mercy is probably the most complex
4032220	4041260	design we have if you want to think of it as layers in terms of fishnet and bandages and all that jazz
4041260	4047580	yeah got strike the balance between not being too over complicated that okay so finally one model
4047580	4055100	that control the full design of uh so if you didn't know she be her hair drills get redder the more
4055100	4063980	bottom you go that's not even a full english sentence um if you didn't know her thighs got
4063980	4072060	chunked up in development uh we went for the classic leg look look some things are classic
4072060	4081340	and you there's no point don't if it ain't broke don't fix it high heels and stockings if it ain't
4081340	4090220	broke don't fix it you don't need to do anything special anything unique any of that stuff it's not
4090220	4100620	broke it's the perfect design i don't don't even talk to me okay um so obviously my voice is going
4101420	4109340	hold on let me take another drink um i do apologize and say that uh azura and she be
4109340	4115580	you're actually gonna get an update soon to cover up their tappas um because i think youtube are not
4115580	4122380	very happy i tried to run ads on them and youtube said no no no no and i was like but i have my boobs
4122380	4130460	out as well youtube so this is just discrimination against big titty girls um i don't know what else
4130460	4138060	is she be designed was just perfect honestly um a lot of people are like hey wait a second why is
4138060	4146940	she wearing the bbsm gear if she's supposed to be the dominant one called like i don't know
4151580	4153180	is my response to that like
4156300	4162540	like go and just go and just like enjoy the design are you joking me you look at this
4162540	4169580	design and that and you complain about it i'm not a guy okay i didn't have a willy but if i had a

4511900	4519500	comment on that um obviously i had to do a lot of preparing in advance it's five dollars to support
4519500	4526780	your girl on patreon for four audios what we are doing is called undercutting the market
4527740	4533100	if you didn't know undercutting the market means you put your product quotation marks out
4533100	4539980	at a rate that is incredibly cheap in comparison to other v a's not only do you get streams from the
4539980	4545420	girls not only do you get alternative content on their all twitter's for free but we have undercut
4545420	4551500	the market on patreon as well so if you would like to test the content that they produce
4552460	4560780	on patreon i highly recommend supporting them over me because i post free stuff all the time
4560780	4566220	you don't all worry about me okay so support the girls first uh it's called undercutting the
4566220	4574060	market isn't a very nice thing to do but it's uh it is what it is now i did have a few concerns
4574060	4581900	about the type of audios please understand and direct any disappointments towards me
4581900	4587660	because um i did not the girls have shown interest some of them to create the scripts
4587660	4592780	and roleplays but please understand i had to make sure i'm not putting them in a position
4592780	4600540	where they are overstressed or overworked when it comes to balancing streaming and
4600540	4608300	uh the roleplays now i have made them as straightforward and the girls are welcome
4608300	4613500	to talk about their experience on stream behind the scenes you know as long as not an nda hence
4614140	4618460	i'm sure they know the difference between like leaking nda content and just being like oh this is
4618460	4630700	how it works okay well let's say five dollars forever yes um i uh believe um i have no plans
4630700	4640940	to raise the price i think five dollars um is an acceptable price i'm i'm very aware of the economy
4640940	4647580	the state that the bloody hangs in and in order to support your oh she deaths that might be in
4647580	4653980	vealer the maximum price you will pay per month i believe is nine dollars and ninety nine cent us dollars
4654780	4663500	for the maximum price of again all content that your oh she deaths produces okay so i wanted it
4663500	4669660	to be as affordable as possible and again that 80 20 split goes across the board your majority
4669660	4676140	is supporting your talent it's not getting hogged up to the agency okay um what will the
4676140	4681740	main content on the youtube channels be streaming we are v-tubers we're just regular v-tubers that
4681740	4689340	offer the goods on the side uh but um please do not think we are trying to speedrun banning our
4689340	4696860	youtube channels um there was a few misconceptions out there that we may do outrageous things please
4696860	4702460	understand uh i'm trying to help these girls become content creators of their dreams help them
4702460	4710460	achieve things that they've always wanted to do hell even get them a play button so as much as
4710460	4717180	jerking der pintus uh on youtube would be hilarious content for three seconds uh i really don't
4717180	4728620	want them to get banned so they're just gonna be my lovely v-tubing girls um yes we need you on stage
4728620	4735420	at a v-tubing convention this is insane marketing and pray insane marketing what revealing that azure's

5227580	5234060	birthdays are when they're going to do donathons and um i actually might do an open stream where
5234060	5239820	we can all discuss it together azura is the first donathon don't worry azura if you're watching
5239820	5244780	i'm gonna help you through it she doesn't really know what she's doing but i'll help her um i'm going
5244780	5256780	to focus on public rewards i'm gonna burp again oh my god sorry sorry sorry i'm talking a lot
5257500	5267500	um i'm going to be focusing on jenna so the chat going not something i go through you see i fell off
5267500	5277260	my chair sorry um what was i saying uh yes we can work on donathon goes together i will help
5277260	5281420	the girls through it because uh somewhere a bit unsure they've never done one before hell i've never
5281420	5288380	done a donathon before uh definitely gonna focus on public rewards at milestones and this is just
5288380	5296140	me personally uh i'm actually not going for anyone don't care what the timing is but um some like
5296140	5302700	i've seen some donathons and the jump is like 5000 us dollars between like the next goal and i'm
5302700	5308300	like going to be serious can you actually not think of one thing to do for like another 500 bucks
5308380	5313820	or like another like one of the biggest jumps i saw i think was 20 000 us dollars i'm like you
5313820	5320140	can't think of like one thing to do in between 20 000 us dollars like no we're not doing that here
5320140	5325500	so i'm i'm helping the girls to try and like pick through what to do for donathons and get rewards
5325500	5331660	and all that thing uh i don't know if it was a joke or a meme because it was like pretty crazy
5331660	5339420	um i'd miss this but how does violour make money if almost everything goes to the talent
5340140	5346700	we got so much feedback on that i this is terrible and i can't believe i have to say this
5347660	5355100	but we're not an agency built on corporate greed full stop that's the sentence we don't have
5355100	5361260	corporate greed and the running costs of an agency after you've done the start of costs of
5361260	5368700	buying the models and getting the girls set up for stream is very low it does not cost a lot of
5368700	5374460	money to actually tell the girls to go stream like it doesn't cost me any money right now to
5374460	5380940	click go live and have a good time or to go away and record an ASMR video and upload it i know in
5380940	5387900	this day and age where corporate greed is everywhere around the corner we're not an agency
5387900	5393660	for corporate greed i hope you understand that the 8020 split for this year the next year if the girl
5393660	5401900	signs on the 15 like the focus on the agency is to help the girls achieve their dreams i know
5401900	5409340	it's ambitious i know we're new and we're just out of the starting gate but i hope no strongy yaw
5410060	5411820	fucking burn the yaw
5415180	5419660	no yaw for me because i don't buddy want one i want the success of my daughters
5420300	5426780	go subscribe to them go give them a chance okay i'm not having none of this corporate greed
5426780	5430780	shit in my house get the fuck out of here without anyway that's just my two cents
5430860	5439660	but yes um the reason why the company and oh and another thing and another thing
5440060	5445260	i'm gonna get started again oh wait i already said that did i already say that the company has
5445260	5452060	been seeded the company is not in debt to banks the company is not indebted to the company has
5452060	5459100	been seeded which means the money was already there it was just funneled into this one okay okay
5461500	5468540	oh what about legal staff are you ready for this fit we don't even have a hr department
5468540	5471740	we just sexually harass each other for fun yippee
5474780	5476860	we don't have that kind of business setup
5480220	5485500	is there's no hr so none of the girls can report to me and report me if i say anything
5485580	5486700	not
5490380	5494940	sorry i keep taking a drink of coal and then hypnotizing you real quick that's true
5496140	5500300	well actually everyone gets paid that was another thing that came up actually
5500300	5507420	um how this is this is actually not vtuber related this is just human related and it's like
5507420	5514860	hey how do you get your um your employees to like work and it was like uh actually
5514860	5519820	pay them above minimum wage like if you go to the girls and go would you rather
5524860	5527580	okay maybe we do slightly maybe have some sort of management
5532940	5538700	i don't run the social accounts or anything like that one guys one guys one guys okay i'm sorry
5538700	5547740	i'm sorry i wasn't saying anything more okay okay i call i call most of the shots i call most
5547740	5555260	of the shots right what was i saying oh right yeah if you're i think one of the it was like the
5555260	5560940	most dumbest post was like i can't get my employees to work hard type thing and it was like uh yeah
5560940	5565500	because you're paying the minimum wage maybe if you actually make them feel like valued employees
5566300	5569180	which is where the 8020 split came in as well because i'm really sick of seeing
5569180	5573420	vtuber agencies just being really greedy and i was like well i'm the opposite and i get to
5573420	5580220	call the shots so yeah 8020 time for a black no not the freaking wipe no the black text on the
5580220	5585820	white background oh my god i'm being graduated already oh it was a good run it was a good run
5585820	5588140	see you next year when i start up the next vtuber
5588140	5596940	uh it's 3d content plan bro we need we just go out of the gates you need to give the girl some
5596940	5602380	some money if you want to get 3d models because uh we spend a lot of money just get into this stage
5602380	5606140	okay i'm going to be honest you put your money where your mouth is if you want to see that content
5607980	5611660	vsucky 2026 let's go vsucky
5611660	5619580	so that's why you guys stream on youtube instead of twitch so twitch and youtube is like pick the
5619580	5625180	lesser of two evils and from a management point of view youtube you can manage accounts on
5626860	5632940	we regret to inform you that strani calls me oh that's another thing yeah uh we don't have uh
5632940	5637660	what's the word i've already forgotten the word because we don't do it what is it called when

5644620	5654460	that word is shadow ban yeah we don't suspension we don't do suspensions at vlr so rest assured uh when
5654460	5660860	your vtuber is self-suspent yeah we don't do that here the girls don't get suspended uh have this
5660860	5668380	terrible thing uh it's called uh treating people like adults uh and yeah we don't do suspensions uh if the girls
5668380	5672780	do a naughty naughty guess what i'm not their mum i'm not here at spank their butt and be like
5672780	5682700	you're a naughty naughty girl uh so yeah see yeah the girls do what they want it's crazy it's like if

5919900	5924060	in the nicest way
5926620	5935020	i the cut wouldn't be the same i just i couldn't i can't see it working out everything is based
5935020	5941980	on what i have learned over the span of many years of what is occurring tan cute and funny i bet
5942300	5949580	she okay i will tell the plan later you can tell it on your screen if you want to
5952060	5962540	um will the patreon uploads be dictated by the talents no the content is given by management
5962540	5966700	i actually have a script manager coming in place soon for the girls if you have any
5966700	5972940	audios that you don't like please direct your grievances with me at this stage and then you can
5972940	5978620	grieve at the manager that's coming in because i can't be our stealing all the scripts um
5981660	5990620	yes the girls are not pigeonholed into one category of audios that would be impossible
5990620	5997660	to get them to succeed and that is just the truth of the matter i understand that some of the audios
5997660	6004460	might not play into the thingy but i can't have polar bear shags you polar bear shags you again
6004460	6010060	polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear polar bear be in every single audio
6010620	6018220	please be realistic with me that's not gonna appeal to the masses and at the end of the day uh these girls
6018220	6024060	are wanting to move out they're wanting to save money for their futures they want to pay off debts
6024060	6034620	possibly this kind of thing so please please be realistic with us okay thank you i do appreciate
6034620	6042780	them um is there a way to submit scripts for the talents possible plausible at this point in time
6042780	6049260	i do not have a system in place like that it is plausible in the future you'll have to let things
6049260	6055020	things need to kind of we need to level out and we need to um how do you call it we need to like
6055580	6058700	settle down the dust hasn't settled literally we're freaking day
6060700	6062460	um all that kind of thing um
6064860	6071340	how likely are what our off club how likely are off collabs based on location
6072780	6081500	you mean like the girls meeting up i can make it happen i get taxed back on their travel expenses
6081500	6086620	i can make that should happen if they want um
6090860	6096540	you said violour does not require the girly pops to get permission for various projects
6097260	6101660	uh how about showing face no i don't really recommend it for him well
6102300	6107580	uh so isn't male collabs you'll never guess what one of the unwritten rules of ours are
6108300	6115260	uh wait ain't gonna be any males on this how do you pronounce violour
6115260	6123180	well i'm scottish so the word like alluring you're alluring violour but violour but if you
6123180	6128140	ever come from a different place yeah like feet cam hand cam that stuff's fine the girls don't need
6128140	6134780	permission for that uh you'll never see my face fill stop and i'm a feature yeah i'd say probably
6134780	6141900	face stuff is like i'll never i'll never stop the talent but um
6142300	6144620	um
6148620	6153740	oh this is a good question have you started the agency on its own or did you get any
6153740	6161660	sponsors or investors nope so when the agency was becoming an agency uh there were actually
6161660	6168460	multiple offers for like split ownership and that kind of thing the last thing i want
6168460	6175500	is anyone meddling with my girls so absolutely not i rejected them all i have absolutely no
6175500	6183980	interest in anyone else having anything to do ownership wise other than knowing that the girls
6183980	6192700	are in my good hands okay uh there was also whispers of like oh you can sell this this business on
6192700	6202300	if it gets big eh and let me stop you right there i trust myself with these girls i do not
6202300	6211100	trust anyone else with these girls so thank you for your interest in your acquisition your investment
6211980	6221580	however if you want to invest how about you invest in some merchandise official violour
6222700	6226220	i'm just throwing away eh but yes don't worry
6229100	6239420	eh why go with patreon over other locations it is safe to link patreon on youtube as long
6239420	6247820	as everything is behind of paywall there is a large established market on patreon if there
6247820	6255020	is ever anything to happen there are multiple websites that can be utilized in case please do not
6255020	6264540	worry okay there are many reasons behind um developmental wise but i hope it's kind of here
6266380	6274620	eh what are your plans for the future of violour um for me personally it is helping the girls
6274620	6282460	achieve their dreams a lot of them were interested in 3d models um definitely do that there's a few
6282460	6286780	that are interested in a few song covers i'll help them pursue that maybe with their own original song
6287340	6293180	but my goals are the girls goals um and if you mean my actual personal goals i'll talk about that in
6293180	6299980	2.0 but my goals are the girls goals yeah i want to help them be successful and be happy um yeah good life
6299980	6310380	we'll give you the inspiration to make violour um corporate greed hate we hate corporate greed
6313100	6313980	that's my sense
6316620	6322540	and i keep seeing people say welcome back did you used to be a feature bar before this

6373500	6383020	20 minute timer for shibir shibidi toilet sorry i'm sorry that if emmy didn't say that if emmy
6383020	6389820	didn't say shibidi toilet i would never have said that myself i'm so sorry it was emmy blame emmy
6389820	6400220	it was emmy she started it she started it oh my god i never even told you the funniest thing so uh
6400220	6407100	we had like we were together for two months before we debuted and the weirdest thing ever
6407100	6411340	was like uh instead of like their meetings where like the girls got to know each other
6411340	6415260	i was like right let's go play among us together for the first time
6417660	6423100	uh so we were like freaking a zero was absolutely smoking us so i'm going to recalibrate my little
6424060	6431260	hold on my mic okay there we go my mic's a bit better than my mic um yeah we had to like
6431260	6437740	do four something like for your game let me try to say to like make everyone comfortable around
6437740	6445980	each other yeah we played like whiplash um this game where like you can i can't remember the title
6445980	6455900	of it but it was like really good it was fun um sorry i just had a little
6457340	6463660	jackbox that was it we played like jackbox together and stuff um are the girls free to
6463660	6472300	collab whoever they want yes asterix as long as i've no got a willy i don't care who they
6472300	6478540	collab with they can go nuts for all i care why are the girls so cute is that part of your hypnosis
6478540	6486620	have i trained you trained you to like the girl uh how open to marriage suggestions are you from
6486620	6493260	friends like design ideas and such go for it but the you know this this agency's kind of
6495180	6500300	i'm gonna i need to word my words carefully word my words carefully i am i need to word myself
6500300	6508460	carefully but most like i want to say most agencies aren't so open and taking feedback
6508460	6514700	whereas like i want to say like hey we've literally just started of course we're gonna
6514700	6521740	fuck up here and there something's gonna go wrong but like we're open to suggestions like oh i think
6521740	6528540	this is a good idea i think that's a good idea you know like i want to say that so
6531820	6539500	um someone says do the talents own the games on the steam account oh fucking course
6540140	6547740	did you buy the game surprise surprise you get to keep a very very very hard concept for
6547740	6556220	some people to comprehend but yeah the talents if they buy it they keep it crazy concept i know truly
6557260	6566700	mindfongling who came up with mersey's design everything is by squishy girl the website is getting
6566700	6571340	an update it's actually taken quite long to to produce the update because there's quite a lot
6571340	6577900	of information that's going to be in it so give us a a hot second to produce it um
6583020	6586700	supposing that someone has an edit in portfolio can they apply for a video editor
6586700	6594460	yeah uh clippers editors um i want to try and do a clipping program where you get money very like
6594460	6600700	idle i'm not even gonna like say otherwise idle do a clipping program where if you clip the girl
6600700	6605980	every thousand views you get a dollar type thing i'm quite interested in that style because
6605980	6611900	you're not forced to only clip us you can clip whoever you want on the side and obviously
6612780	6616700	you don't need a wee bit of money to come back in before i can do something like that but i really do
6616700	6623580	like the concept of it very good wellness very good wellness um i like it very much
6631420	6632700	uh
6635580	6639500	sorry i'm just i'm just reading some of the questions i can't say out loud as i read it
6639500	6647820	because it's you know um sorry i'm reading i'm reading just in case
6650620	6656380	uh hold on hold on i'm reading i'm reading i'm reading you guys are just saying inappropriate
6656460	6663580	stuff about sorry the the the the the comments are like i would do this to ac i would do this to
6663580	6671820	me and i'm like but that's not a question about the agency how long did it take to get the hired
6671820	6681340	selection progress process oh my god oh my god you've just activated my neurons so the the
6681340	6691660	application pool was open for a month and then the way the twitter said like in 48 hours or
6691660	6698140	something you're gonna get an email and someone was like oh my god there's no way they're gonna
6698140	6707420	go through all those applications in two days no you idiot you numpty of course we were going
6707420	6716460	through the applications as they came in you genuinely thought that when they close is when
6716460	6724780	agencies go through them come on rub those brain cells together
6727900	6734780	you genuinely think that agencies close applications and then start going through them
6734780	6742380	no add a freaking battle royale tier system going on for the girls goodness gravy
6744460	6751180	goodness gravy some of the comments come on me i'm no very smart myself but the moon man you're
6751180	6757660	taking my pass are there rules surrounding clipping the talents absolutely not go nuts knock
6757660	6764700	yourself out thank you because it costs a lot to pay for clipping um will you ever hire
6764700	6770620	programmers sadly i don't need a programmer let's just fix a
6774140	6780860	battle royale tier system okay right i can i can talk about this so as the applications came in
6780860	6788460	i found a girl that was suitable i would pick out the model for you and there was first place
6788460	6798620	second place third place but the choices were so like obvious to me if it made sense like
6799180	6804860	emmy was emmy i see was i see you know like the choices were so obvious that it was like
6804860	6811740	do the interview and you're in type thing i have a no bullshit apology apology i have a no
6811740	6817500	bullshit approach to interviews so and the girls can talk about it if they so desire i basically
6818220	6822300	went into the interview with them and i said eh right off the bat i said hey
6823180	6827580	we want you as a talent you absolutely do not have to impress me in this call
6827580	6832540	okay you don't have to impress me i want you already here's a list of stuff that you
6832540	6838460	need to know before you sign on if you want to sign on okay did you have a lot of candidates
6838460	6843660	for fondlet no a zero was the only like there was no one else for a zero if zero rejected that
6843660	6852540	position i was up shit creek i'm not even fucking saying nothing yeah angry scottish is more
6854540	6862700	um but yeah uh within like 24 hours people were emailed and that was it
6867420	6873420	are you going are your models gonna stick sorry are you and the models stick to these avatar
6874140	6879980	eh you mean like new outfits and stuff no the girls can get new outfits or 2.0 or whatever
6879980	6884620	or 3d models perfectly fine with me um
6887580	6894060	eh are you ever worried about your relationship with the girls considering your gen mates and a
6894060	6901820	boss funny you mentioned that i told them in the interview don't call me boss don't refer to
6901820	6908540	me as your boss do not think of me as your boss i am not your boss don't ever place me above you
6908540	6918060	mentally in your head i do not want that i am the creative director wink wink so they do not call
6918060	6925740	me boss they do not call me superior yes she be called me boss mam and i was like no please don't
6925740	6931420	ever like do that because i don't want anyone thinking in their head like oh my god i can't
6931420	6939900	approach her i can't talk to her no i don't want that i don't like them i don't want anyone to
6939900	6948540	ever think that i am superior to them in any way unless it's their kink i said it i said it
6948540	6951660	um
6956140	6957980	let me check let me have a refresh
6960140	6967020	yeah um also at the end of the day i'm not really a boss anymore like now that debuts are over
6967020	6973740	everything's like up to the girl the only boss thing really is like hey have you recorded that
6974300	6981500	audio for patreon yes or no and then that's it there's nothing else to it um
6987820	6993100	so yeah leader yeah uh basically just tell them like hey i did this and i'll show them stats and
6993100	6997500	stuff and i'm like this is what i think you should do but they don't really ask for advice because
6998300	7003740	uh i'll mention i'll repeat this again all the girls have more streaming experience than me
7003740	7009660	so it's really hypocritical for me to be like hey go stream this go stream that no i have full faith in
7009660	7016220	these girls uh they are absolutely fantastic lovely everything i have absolutely no problems
7016220	7023100	i have complete faith in them and absolutely nothing is worrisome at all so yeah
7028380	7035820	she goes live in eight minutes hold on let me get confirmation that i raid into shibis 2.0
7035820	7044220	um for those of you who would like to part ways and join shibis 2.0 please absolutely do

7068780	7073500	i'm i'm gonna answer questions about myself and stuff but this is kind of more agency focus
7074220	7076220	yeah
7076700	7081500	um someone asked do you have plans for auditions for gen 2
7082620	7090220	okay we debuted yesterday unless you're actually interested in joining the agency that's different
7090860	7099020	um the we were a year away from my focus is on helping these girls achieve their dreams and seeing
7099020	7105180	where we go you know you need to let let they've literally just been birthed from my lines give them
7105180	7112780	a chance to like you know get their their knee joints working and all that jazz yeah let's
7112780	7130940	everyone cook first but it's it's a year away um that we're okay any questions on youtube because
7132060	7137980	marshmallow drying up like my voice box honestly whose voice is it my voice
7138940	7146060	um you've invested a lot of money into this understand that the marriage goes to the girls but
7146060	7156860	how exactly do you recoup your investment me i keep 100 percent of what i mean uh yeah don't
7156860	7161260	don't worry about like thank you very much for worrying about investment costs and stuff but

7182140	7188860	some things in life are more important than greed and i don't mean you're implying that i'm greedy
7189500	7195340	because obviously everyone wants to return on investment if you will but let's just have a good
