Being a VTuber and having to do taxes can be very interesting.
By definition, anything you have to purchase in order to run your business may be eligible for a tax write-off.
Meaning that things such as a live 2D model, artworks, editors, advertisements, script writers, heck, even songwriters
can give you a cheeky reduction in your overall tax bill.
But wait, there's more.
Your internet and your electricity bill, even the rent if you live somewhere where you have a separate room to work in.
It's also the exact same experience for loot VTuber activities as well.
So yeah, I have looked my accountant in the eyes and claimed back artworks of a very unique variety.
