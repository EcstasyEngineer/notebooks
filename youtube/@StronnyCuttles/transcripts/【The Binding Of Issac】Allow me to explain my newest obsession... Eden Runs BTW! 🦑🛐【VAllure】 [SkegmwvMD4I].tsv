0	22000	Oh, so if I push for me, you read it, you read it, you read it, are you waiting until
22000	29000	it registers? For some reason it doesn't register, really.
29000	42000	I'll wait for YouTube to prompt me to put ads on, that's when I know I can start talking
42000	47000	as soon as YouTube's like, do you want to put ads on? I'm like, no. No, I'm running
47000	55000	started with a stream, why would I want to put ads on? Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
55000	70000	Is my fucking model crashed? Whoa! Excuse me, I saw that. OBS is currently eating 40%
71000	79000	OBS, hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who or what? Nothing is open.
82000	92000	OBS, relax! 40%? The Binding of Sheevee, honestly. I do not know why I'm lagging.
93000	99000	Is there memory leak on the fucking main menu? Goddamn. Don't laugh that I'm not on a
99000	106000	win streak. Me, thank you for becoming a member. Dear Asical, thank you for redirecting into
106000	112000	my high snowberries, I don't know why OBS is melting. Whoa, you're breaking my model,
112000	119000	OBS, what the fuck? Holy shit, I think it's not an Isaac Data leak, it literally says
120000	132000	OBS bro, you need to calm down, who or what? I got the movie, I got the movie open for later,
132000	146000	I might have to delete the answer. I'm sure maybe that much of a video. Right, looks good bro,
146000	151000	I enter the news, I'll pretend that my model isn't lagging. So this game is called the
151000	158000	Binding of Isaac, is that a biblical reference? Yes it is, this game is about a 5 year old
158000	168000	boy called Isaac. Just close and reopen OBS, I don't know how to inform you, OBS is what
168000	175000	I'm streaming to you on, you're asking me to reset the stream, no chance. You should
175000	181000	reinstall it. So this is the Binding of Isaac and it is about a poor 5 year old boy who
181000	193000	experienced severe religious trauma and this poor boy has to go, I don't know the quickest,
193000	199000	basically long story short, he sees himself as a bad child, he sees himself as a part
199000	211000	of the devil and he chooses to lock himself in a chest in his room, all while his poor mother
211000	219000	and father are trying to find them, unfortunately his mother and father split, but these characters
219000	230000	you see on this main menu, Isaac, Magdalene, Cain, Judas, Eve, Samson, sorry Blue Baby,
230000	240000	Samson, Azazel, Lazarus, Eden, The Lost, Lilith, Keeper, Apollyon, The Forgotten, Bethany,
240000	248000	Jacob and Isu, these are all Isaac, my poor little boy Isaac is currently inside a chest
248000	256000	hallucinating due to the fact he is losing oxygen inside the chest. We are going to do
256000	265000	what's called an Eden run, Eden tokens you might notice, what did I purposefully plan
265000	272000	such an escapade on Eden tokens, no that's just how perfect the world is for us reeflings
272000	282000	and snow bears are hanging out too, thanks snow bears, I do appreciate you, so poor little
282000	289000	Isaac, we are going to do what's called an Eden run, Eden starts with two, statistically
289000	295000	two items, although you can start with an active item, a passive item and a trinket,
295000	301000	if you're really lucky, but it's completely random what you get, so we look at Lazarus
301000	308000	in comparison, we see Lazarus has three hearts, two speed and two damage, Eden is randomized
308000	314000	and it can produce quite a unique run, so we're going to try an Eden run, just normal,
314000	321000	I've not played, the last time I played actually was when the girls had just been picked, okay
321000	329000	so we have the pickaxe, our passive is the wafer, do you see that little tiny red circle
329000	334000	under the minimap, look I'm kissing it, see this little circle, thank you June for becoming
334000	342000	a member, I appreciate it, the wafer means that I take half health damage now, so this
342000	349000	is an incredibly lucky run, and my active item is the pickaxe, which can actually let
349000	358000	me get into secret rooms in this game, that circle will literally be, okay, so now I want
358000	362000	you to notice this detail, I'm going to write a review on this game, this is a 10 out of
362000	368000	10 game experience for me, so if we look at our stats on the left side, Isaac's base stats
368000	375000	are 1.0 for speed, that's a little boot with speak marks coming behind it, I always get
375000	385000	fire rate and tier size mixed up, but it's below average, our range isn't awful, but everything
385000	394000	is really not the best stat wise, we have a pretty decent tier rate honestly, not bad,
394000	404000	not bad at all, unfortunately, unfortunately, it could be better, what have we got, so this
404000	412000	is a passive unfortunately which will not give us anything other than money, now there
412000	419000	are shops in this game, oh see this is a perfect example of why our starting item is such a
419000	426000	good lucky pull, we normally would need a bomb in order to access this, so because we
426000	431000	already have a soul heart on our persons, we are going to pick it up because we will take
431000	435000	soul heart damage over red heart damage, I already missed the rock because our tinted
435000	441000	rocks also wasn't paying attention, oh wait, am I going to, no, sorry, sorry, wait what
441000	446000	do you mean I missed our rock, motherfucker, right, there's also a thing called tinted
446000	453000	rocks in this game as well, whoa, right, we've got BFF, that's pretty decent, and the item
453000	457000	room, oh for fuck's sake, right, hold on, hold on, embarrassing, embarrassing, here's
457000	460000	me trying to be like, oh this is how this game works, and of course I missed something
460000	464000	really obvious, oh for dear eye, I was like eh, there's no rock back here, oh that's so
464000	469000	obvious, okay so there's also a thing called tinted rocks, when you destroy them you have
470000	480000	the odds of getting one soul heart are pretty high, now you also can spawn trap doors, and
480000	486000	depending on if they have a ladder or not, it would actually be kind of nice to get BFF
486000	491000	in case we pick up a familiar, the odds of receiving a familiar in the game are pretty
491000	496000	high, so these stone guys aren't real enemies, but I would like you to take a note, look at
496000	501000	our body, and then look at the body of the enemies, okay, okay he may have just walked
501000	508000	into the fire, all the enemies are poor little Isaac, and all the rooms are Isaac in the
508000	512000	chest, look at the shape of this room, now I know you might be saying absolute schizophrenic
512000	517000	gameplay, what do you mean the room, the room's rectangular, it's one of the most common
517000	522000	shapes, and that doesn't make sense because look at the room you're going up ahead, look,
522000	527000	they had to do some stuff, okay just relax, we're getting the pickaxe out, it's very safe
527000	535000	to have the pickaxe, but everything relates to poor little Isaac being in a chest, now
535000	541000	I knew the secret room was most likely there due to this long room especially spawning in
541000	551000	on a flat floor, so this is called a bomb beggar, you can't, fantastic, fantastic, we are finding
551000	558000	so many soul hearts, which I will tell you exactly why in the next level is very important
558000	564000	to get these soul hearts, so this is a bomb beggar, an exchange of la bomba, he can potentially
564000	570000	give us a payout of keys, of money, so if you wanted to do a cheeky exchange rate you most
570000	583000	certainly can, but the original game, are you going devil, no, I am an angel player,
583000	589000	now unfortunately me, thank goodness I was actually going to, that went really well,
589000	595000	oh right, so sometimes rooms can spawn spiders that weren't originally there, if you don't
595000	598000	want to, I have watched so many people play this game and I actually had no idea what's
598000	605000	going on until now, allow me to explain, I started this game this year and it's just
605000	610000	absolutely fantastic, so we're not going to carry this pill, but notice how it says
610000	616000	question mark or unidentified pill, it could potentially be a good pill, it could potentially
616000	622000	be a bad pill, I personally am not risking any stats down at the moment because we are
622000	628000	needing a bit of health and this card, the two of hearts, not any tyrant cards, the two
628000	635000	of hearts, doubles Isaac's red hearts, well that's actually pretty terrible, in all actuality
635000	642000	that's pretty terrible, we might get a machine, so we've discovered those two secret rooms,
642000	648000	so there's a secret room, a super secret room and there's actually an ultra secret room
648000	653000	which we do not have access to, nor can I guess where it's located on the map, we could
653000	659000	go inside, this is what's called the cursed room, so the reason why we're going to go
659000	665000	in the cursed room, you notice those teeth marks around it, danger, danger, not good,
665000	670000	however we have the wafer which means we will take half health, so for the sacrifice of
670000	677000	one soul heart, we might be able to get something better, so we're going to risk it, we're going
677000	686000	to risk it, we have received two black hearts, these have a necronomic effect, I'm an idiot
686000	692000	there's a penny back in that room, we are going to bomb up my donation machine, you can
692000	705000	see it's a bit low, so necro hearts are, we are going to pick up BFF, oh ok, we're not
705000	710000	going to pick up BFF against the sadness of my heart because the likelihood of us doing
710000	716000	it, we do have piggy banks, so we're going to get members access which opens up a, oh
716000	721000	did I just freaking buy a pill, I might as well take it then right, what is it, what's
721000	726000	the pill, ok it was actually a tears up, ok so that means we fire more tears, that was
726000	732000	so lucky, we're not doing BFF, however we now have access to a secret shop, no it will
732000	738000	be a ridiculous price and unfortunately it's very unlikely we'll be able to, again with
738000	747000	the spiders, it's very likely, we're going to have to raise our economy, however thanks
747000	753000	to the pickaxe, we can destroy, honestly we might as well just destroy, oh wait hold on
753000	757000	we're not even done the boss fight yet, ok first boss fight, now you might notice those
757000	761000	two symbols, bottom left on the statistics look I'm getting closer to them, see these,
761000	765000	this is devil deal and angel deal chance, you do not spawn devil deal or angel on the
765000	770000	first floor, doesn't matter, you can't get it, the exceptions are if you have a joker
770000	777000	card, you spawn in with goat head for example, but for the first floor of the game, you ain't
777000	782000	getting nothing, you ain't getting nothing, sit down ok, was the same colour of the pill
782000	787000	the one you skipped, let's find it, no, so this is not a tears up or else it would identify
787000	795000	itself as a tears up because we now know what type of pill that is, ok, so again we've
795000	802000	discovered both rooms, we have actually purchased a secret member door, we do unfortunately
802000	811000	have yet to receive the gurglings, right, three of them, this is terrible streamer luck,
811000	820000	back off, stay back, on guard, on guard, ok so we just had a necronomic effect which is
820000	826000	ok, that was terrible luck, ok we do receive a speed upgrade which is good, we are now
826000	833000	above speed, the base game speed so we'll be able to kind of dodge more enemies, that
833000	840000	was terrible luck three of them, but anyway we now have enough speed to get away from
840000	848000	the most average enemy to make a bit of a room between us, ok, but we did it, we destroyed,
848000	855000	oh poor Isaac, he got jumpscared on the toilet, Isaac is not, so you'll now notice on bottom
855000	863000	left we now have 100% chance of a devil deal, if we were to receive any red heart damage
863000	869000	we have two red hearts, a lot of souls and we necro as well on top, ok, sorry I'm going
869000	874000	to drink my tea, before anyone that does know this game, no we're not doing boss rush, a
874000	883000	kibiar's, unless we get Miss Bomba, I forget her name sometimes, I'm going to sit with
883000	893000	my tea, but yes this game is absolutely fantastic, unfortunately for level 2 we got what's called
893000	898000	the burning base mint, if you look on the walls you'll notice there's fire but what
898000	904000	means is that there's also a few enemies on this floor, Mama Mega, there you go Miss Mega,
904000	912000	I was close enough, Mama Mega is the exception that'll let you into the boss rush room, but
912000	916000	no we're not going to do any alt pathing, we're not going to do any of that, I'm just going
916000	921000	to show the basics, we're going to hopefully have a successful run, I would very much enjoy
921000	927000	an item that does some, is that a cat hair in my tea, I swear Gimli, is that a cat hair
927000	934000	in my tea, hold on a minute, no oh my god it's just schizophrenia, it's just schizophrenia
934000	942000	I'm sorry, right hold on, no we're not doing hush either but yes this game is a 10 out
942000	948000	of 10, it is absolute chaos the first time you play it and I kid you not it takes hours
948000	954000	upon hours to even comprehend what you're doing, you might think oh Isaac, Binding of
954000	961000	Isaac that we game, where that cute little pixel boy runs around, absolutely not, this
961000	968000	game is horrific but I will point out we picked up the bell and look at our stomach, we have
968000	974000	a bell on us now, as you pick up items Isaac will reflect those items, that's why we're
974000	980000	currently glowing blue right now, that is because of the wafer, fantastic angel item
980000	989000	that we spawned in, it's just schizophrenia, I relate to that on a personal level, don't
989000	1000000	you have to unlock the burned rooms too, yes I forgotten how I unlocked it but yeah, Binding
1000000	1006000	of Isaac players be like I have 4000, I'm still a rookie, yes so this game, if it is
1006000	1014000	a game for you or might be a game for you, it becomes multiplayer in November which obviously
1014000	1019000	you know exactly what that means, we flings, we're all going to be playing it together,
1019000	1026000	the lobby sizes can go up to 4, so basically we're going to have quite a few endurance
1026000	1034000	marathons and multiplayer together, Strone is truly the Binding of Isaac Warmaster, I
1034000	1042000	wish we could do an omega run, the likelihood of an omega run is absolutely minuscule unless
1042000	1049000	our secret room, actually speaking of secret room, how cool would it have been if it was
1049000	1053000	in there though, imagine if it was, sometimes the secret room spawns directly in the room
1053000	1060000	you spawn in, well it is a lovely game and I can't wait to play with you in November
1060000	1065000	if you are an Isaac player, I do not have all unlocks, I do not have, I don't even have
1065000	1070000	a second file, you're supposed to have all unlocks on a file 2 and 3, I don't even have
1070000	1078000	them on one, but the items you receive from the treasure room, from the shop etc will
1078000	1084000	shape your run as well as the angel and devil deals will come in clutch, now originally
1084000	1093000	I said I would do angel deals but I have to admit with our high HP right now I'm a bit
1093000	1101000	tempted, I have so many arrows in the game I still don't know how to spawn the angel
1101000	1108000	room, if you take, if you walk inside a devil deal, you are not allowed an angel room, if
1108000	1116080	you walk inside it, if you ignore it and go down into the next level your angel room will
1116080	1122320	take over your devil room percentage, you can also raise it by going on the sacrifice
1122320	1131080	room, or I think it's called the sack shuffle to some people, don't give in to temptation,
1131080	1136360	no I want to show you the power of angel deals, I also want to show you something critical
1136360	1140920	you must do if you want to raise your angel deals, I will also do it in greed mode, I'm
1140920	1145240	going to play one Eden run and then we're going to play one Lilith greed mode, just
1145240	1150080	to talk through the mode, greed mode Lilith is the easiest character you can play by
1150080	1161480	far due to her treasure blocks, I've almost finished my tea I promise, I promise, Lilith
1161480	1166240	Seals so okay I'm going to get a wee drink of water as well, I can open it this time
1166240	1174040	without my wrist cracking, you're allowed to visit but don't take anything, I haven't
1174040	1179320	found that unless I'm being daft, I always find ignoring it is the way it goes, right
1179520	1184200	this room is smaller on her little map, can you see her little map on the top right, so
1184200	1188760	likely there's not too many enemies in here, so we are just going to go this way but yeah
1188760	1194880	there we go, and now he shoots in a diagonal at diagonal, up at downy 4, these red poops
1194880	1200080	cannot be destroyed and you do not get items from them, do not be fooled, do not be fooled
1200080	1205680	they are not good, but you will get, you will encounter enemies that like you can't reach
1205800	1214960	or you can't do anything with, okay no, no I'm not energy, if I could get a spoon spender,
1214960	1219440	if I could get a spoon spender that would be great, so we only have one key right now,
1219440	1223320	so I'm actually going to pass on the shop, we only have three coins so there's no point,
1223320	1229760	I'm going to look for a tinted rock but there's no tinted rock in this room, well I have,
1229840	1238160	Jesus, getting my hammer out for this one, get down, relax, I only just got in the room,
1241440	1245840	there is a chance, there you go, I was going to say, there is a very high chance your secret
1245840	1254160	room is actually right before the boss, it's so common, curious, I do not have, your luck
1254160	1258560	percentage doesn't affect machines like that, apparently, but I don't know how much I believe
1258560	1265760	that, peeking the first devil deal makes you next 50-50, but if you ignore then it locks in,
1265760	1271040	okay that makes sense, okay we're gonna get the fucking pickaxe out again, geez, we keep
1271040	1276480	getting rooms that are like really bad, right, again we only have one key so we're going all out
1276480	1290400	on the item room, surely, surely it's a good item, it's an active item, yeah, okay, I don't need
1290400	1301360	an active item, maybe we can get a black rune, don't want to, oh, yep, okay, sorry, I saw that
1301360	1306400	come in halfway across the room, I was like, I do not have the speed for these guys, okay,
1307200	1312560	one more, one more, one more, those Isaacs have a bomb in their head and they chase you down,
1312560	1324080	which isn't very nice, but is that gonna stop them, no, so we actually are gonna bomb for this one,
1324080	1330080	the reason because is we can actually get money from the pops, like that, so again, spider spawned,
1330160	1335760	but we're just gonna leave the room, don't even have to deal with them, as for the secret room,
1336720	1344080	okay it's here, sorry, I have a bit of sense through the classic Isaac gaming experience,
1344080	1348720	but we've discovered both our rooms, again we don't actually have any keys to access the shop,
1348720	1354960	nor do we have enough for the premium item, sometimes items can be for sale in the shop, but
1355200	1364000	we don't have a key, so we can't go in, however, we could bomb this fortune teller machine up for
1364000	1371680	a chance, for a chance of a coin or a soul heart, but hey, I'd rather not gamble like that, I have
1371680	1380000	found, oh, Jukka flies very easy enemy, oh my god, it's a big fly though, relax, I don't have the
1380000	1388560	damage for all of this, relax, okay it's fine, it's fine, Jukka is very weak to bombs actually,
1388560	1396080	so I'm just gonna put one, Jukka is very weak to bombs, so I'm just gonna, there we go, there we
1396080	1401120	go, there we go, I was gonna say something, I'm just gonna put one down, he's very weak to bombs,
1401120	1408640	so again, the devil deal has spawned, but we say no, we have received a range upgrade, and was that
1408720	1416640	tier size, I wasn't paying attention, is this after birth, this is all of them, I've completely
1416640	1421440	forgotten, so again, we don't have a key, we're gonna have to say sorry shop, and the active item
1421440	1428640	was a lobomba, again, apologies lobomba, but you do not do anything for us, there's no tinted rock in
1428640	1435120	this room as far as I can see, well, time to go next, we're saying no thank you to El Diablo,
1435120	1441920	you could visit the curse room, I could, but because I had necronomic hearts, I like them as
1441920	1452080	a lifeline, yeah, not this time, right, let's get toot, oh, I'm getting so distracted, sorry I was
1452080	1460720	gonna talk about this flat wall, hold on, hold on, are you trolling me right now, right, notice how
1460720	1465280	flat this wall is here, there's nothing against, oh for fuck's sake, of course it's not even the
1465280	1470560	secret room, I was gonna be like, if you ever enter a room and there's like a really flat wall,
1471920	1478720	that was absolutely terrible, hold on, I need MLG this right now, okay boom, normally the,
1478720	1485360	oh for fuck's sake, I hate these guys as well, yeah, it's even they do like a triple spray, like
1485360	1491600	bro, you don't even have the, you don't even have three familiar transformation, I've forgotten what
1491600	1499120	it's called, you can't hurt him unless he's shown his wee neck, thankfully, oh wait, hold on, this
1499120	1508240	wall is flat, okay, there we go, this wall is flat, so I came to, leave me alone, Mr. Spider, I'm so
1508240	1512960	bad against spiders, literally it's the only thing that freaking kills me in this game, now we have
1512960	1524160	a bit of a gamble, whoa, what did you do, a sack, oh well, we have a bit of a gamble, right, so look
1524160	1531600	at my angel percentage, it says 33.8%, we are going to bomb this corpse in here, and look, it went up by
1531600	1540000	2.5%, so when you bomb it, I guess previous Isaac bodies is really the only way to see it, we're
1540000	1545360	going to come back, we're going to come back to that room, let him get up, let him get up, although
1545360	1553200	actually you can get in golden chests, you actually can get a few items in a secret room from a
1553200	1558960	gold chest, so we may, I don't know, I don't want to miss the shop, we have really good economy and
1558960	1565120	we have a member's card, which means we have access to, oh right, there we go, boom, boom, boom,
1565120	1569920	let's see what's in here, key, we got our money, we got a key back, there we go, we have a tier
1569920	1577600	upgrade and range and three random hearts, and we get very lucky with an necronomic and a soul,
1577600	1584240	because we have that soul heart, I am happy to go back into the curse room, I'm going to sacrifice
1584240	1588560	the soul heart to see what's at curse, are you fucking kidding me, it's just more spiders,
1588640	1596160	um, now unfortunately our damage is low, which means that we are having to lick these enemies
1596160	1602240	for quite a few moments, unfortunately he splits into two spiders, which I'm not looking forward
1602240	1609760	to, there you go, um, now we, this does count as an active reward, like an active item reward,
1609760	1615200	doing a room like this, but that is a shame that we didn't get a payoff, but hey, what the heck,
1616160	1624560	uh, what a strange room, right okay, we've got super sloth, which isn't ideal with our freaking
1624560	1635840	terribly low damage, and all these, wow, these things are absolutely, oh dear, oh my god,
1636320	1644960	oh I need to start out spiders, please, no please, please, no what the heck, he can, stop, stop,
1644960	1652800	stop, this is awful, stop, this is truly awful, please, stop, stop, stop, or my damn right,
1652800	1659200	you're giving me a pedestal item, that couldn't have gone any worse, that's actually not that bad,
1660160	1667600	right, if, okay, okay, we've got a black rune, um, we've also picked up a trinket that lets us,
1667600	1673680	that was the worst, I couldn't have made that any worse if I tried, um, this is, that's why I'm
1673680	1679040	saying we are very low damage, things are able to punish us very harshly, I'm just gonna check
1679040	1687920	there's no tinted rock in here, no, not as far as my elf eyes can see, that was awful, and of course,
1687920	1691680	please, I want spoon bender, so I don't actually have to aim, that would be great,
1692400	1698480	one spoon bender, or familiar spoon bender, I'll take it, okay, there we go, now we do have a
1698480	1700560	chess, which we've got two hearts from, please,
1708400	1714240	um, right, so because we picked up the trinket on this floor, we actually don't have the respawn
1714800	1720480	box, which is a shame, we are gonna take ice baby, we might be able to get conjoined three,
1720480	1725440	now if we end up getting conjoined, this is where we go, draft, the game could have,
1726160	1734000	um, the game could have, it's icy, oh it's icy actually, hold on, let's see if we can pick up
1734000	1740640	an item for everyone, oh okay, Miss Dolly's gonna be sheebie, because sheebie has nice blonde hair,
1741200	1744000	and then the red bow will be the red at the bottom of her hair,
1746160	1751200	Emi is something evil, we don't have anything evil for Emi yet, but we're gonna pick it up,
1751200	1761600	we're gonna hopefully get conjoined, normally you get a few more, see, oh my gosh, right,
1761600	1766640	we need to stop taking damage, I ain't joking the way for saving us, re-factor, thank you very much
1766640	1772400	for coming to member, so once an enemy's frozen you can actually use them to attack, um, I don't
1772400	1778800	know where the secret room is, other than that one we're at, lawyer, I really don't like long
1778800	1787760	room spawning in because I, oh they're bombs, the, the spiders are bombs, wow, are you joking that
1787840	1795440	tiny wee thing, ah we're actually losing, the raw embarrassment, whoa,
1798160	1803040	birthright and steam sale, steam sale lowers everything by half, birthright gives us three
1803040	1812880	items to choose from, uh we've got dead bird, we can put our health up and shot speed up over dead
1812880	1819120	bird, I don't know, dead bird might help us though, if I'm completely messing up, I mean
1820000	1826880	there's no point in doing duality, oh is there though, no because we're going for angel,
1830160	1835840	I, I mean shot speed going up or a bird that comes in attacks every time I take damage,
1836560	1844320	wait I get electric at both, spawns both in devil and angel room if either,
1844960	1849600	entering one makes the other disappear, I don't know, I,
1851680	1856480	dead bird's gonna fm up though for me which is kind of what I'm needing, not gonna lie, not gonna lie,
1856480	1860640	I'm kind of needing a bit of dead bird, but I'm needing health as well, right, fuck it dead bird,
1861280	1866960	Eve come on in, right let's see what's going on down here in the basement, hello,
1872000	1879920	hello, this soul, grants an aura that repels the projectiles, I know there's red key,
1882160	1888000	um this is such a good batch as well because this would give me conjoined part two of three,
1888240	1890720	I'm going for repel,
1893680	1896000	I'm going to see if we can come up with the money,
1897600	1903920	right okay okay we can get conjoined part two, okay okay conjoined part two, oh my god look at it,
1903920	1909520	oh he's got we nail, we, that red key is pretty special,
1909760	1916880	I'm gonna see if we can get a money off this keeper as well, no didoms,
1920480	1924640	he does a veep attack this fly so you can kind of ignore him, are we that,
1926720	1930640	we got a dame, wait oh we don't have enough though, wait,
1931200	1941600	okay there we go, I was going to say the odds, and another soul, wow, wowie we wow,
1941600	1947680	we're actually doing very lucky, yeah how do you say lucky, lucky, lucky, even though I suck at
1947680	1953280	the fates, but we're actually doing pretty decent, why are you spawning two enemies,
1953280	1959760	this is so unfair and I got hit, that's right, no get him get me, get him get me, beat him up,
1960000	1970000	hold it, go get me go, go get me go, wow, let's go get me, you did it, and we got PJs,
1970000	1976880	now we're full health, wow that's actually pretty insane, right a special fact with the angel deals,
1976880	1985040	health up and damage, okay this if you want to continually get angel deals you have to do this
1985040	1992720	thing that makes no sense, you have to attack this angel and they will drop a key piece which
1994560	2000560	which raises your chances of getting more angel deals, don't don't ask to make sense of it,
2000560	2007600	it makes no sense, literally attack an angel and oh I do have a mod that lets me know when they're
2008400	2015680	laser fire because I have a few mods, I have laser fire mod, I have mum stomp because I can never
2015680	2024320	see when she's gonna stomp down on me, I'm absolutely rubbish at it, truly rubbish, so angels
2024320	2029760	can actually, I forget his name, but he can actually hurt himself on the blue fires, blue fires
2029760	2034080	or you have a chance to drop, okay this is what we don't want with him spawning loads of different
2034080	2040240	little guys, because that is gonna add up to damage over time which we're not interested in,
2041520	2050960	you might notice our little buddy is bringing in some big massive hand, that is called big brother
2051680	2057760	or little brother, his hand comes up, right here we go, so key piece two, getting both parts opens
2057760	2064960	a big golden door, don't worry about the golden door okay, I doubt we're gonna do it, 25% angel
2064960	2070560	room chance and our chance for an eternal heart goes up just a smidge, an eternal heart if you
2070560	2075680	take it to the next floor will give you a full red heart, but again our angel deal chance has now
2075680	2082080	just gone up considerably, now we are full health so we don't need to bomb this fire for a chance of
2082160	2088480	soul heart, we are good to go, so that was an incredibly good one, no we're not going down the
2088480	2093760	alt path, I'm too scared and it's too late anyway, we're not going against mother, we're going against
2093760	2101680	mum, we have discovered both of our lovely jubbly secret rooms, we do have 15 bucks which is not
2101680	2108320	enough for the red key, although I'll be honest and say I have zero success finding the ultra
2108800	2117680	secret room, I see that I am description mode, oh yes, the creator Ed McMuffin as he likes to go
2117680	2124880	by, whoa we got a library, oh we have no keys, oh that's not good, okay libraries if there's three
2124880	2131840	books inside gives a, whoa a transformation chance to get bookworm which means we will have a chance
2131840	2142560	to throw out two tiers pair, like two tiers like this, we need, whoa, I am so bad at dodging
2142560	2148160	anything, did you see those spiders come, oh sorry fuck them up Gamma, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma go, right
2148160	2153520	we do have a key, I'm gonna risk it and hopefully we get rewarded with bookworm with three books inside
2153680	2162000	close enough, right 40 damage to all in the room or a black heart however
2163360	2169600	using the item before boss fight makes the reward a devil deal, purchasing it does cost
2169600	2176800	does not affect item pedestals in the voice, now I am going to take this, the reason is because
2176800	2185200	it is infinite health source, I, I have faith, unfortunately this key beggar, I'm sorry I have
2185200	2190320	no keys, he will have a higher chance to drop a key which he does, thank you very much, we say
2190320	2196480	thank you pickaxe for doing your duties, you've done us fantastic, we have discovered all the secret
2196560	2207360	rooms so far, we are going to ultimate because we can basically take devil items and be rewarded
2207360	2213280	without the penalty of not being a loud angel, I am absolutely messing this up, sorry the,
2214400	2219360	the familiars hook attack is really messing up with my eyes right now, yeah that's right just
2219360	2223360	blame the game, blaming the game on itself, yeah maybe I'm just a bad player, I don't know you'll
2223360	2232960	never know, devil items statistically are very strong however angel items you can roll an
2232960	2239760	absolute terrible angel room, you can absolutely terrible like I don't know I guess the urn thing
2239760	2246560	that pot thing that I never bother with is just awful, a little mushroom guys they have a lot of
2246560	2256000	HP, I don't know if I want to use a key on that, I'll use a key, two bombs in exchange of one key
2256000	2261040	when our economy on bombs is pretty high is perfectly fine, it's a bit rough but it's fine,
2261600	2267840	we could go for this, ah fuck it, let's just go for the chest, let's see what's inside,
2268560	2275600	let's see what's inside, oh we, oh we have an extra soul heart, fuck it,
2279600	2287840	okay guess I deserve that, you suck, okay, yeah soul heart, rubbish that's why I hardly ever do
2287840	2293120	the curse room because it's so stinky honestly, okay that was really lucky that our guy has curved
2293120	2300080	bullets, now because we have so much HP we could consider the sacrifice room rather dangerous but
2301200	2311040	but I mean we're not doing, we're not doing bad, these guys aren't too rubbish, a little bit rubbish,
2311840	2319920	they kind of suck, we could consider it because actually I'm feeling risky you know that I'm
2320000	2328720	feeling riskier, I'm feeling a bit riskier, is this where the secret room is, yes, player instinct,
2328720	2334080	so this is a mimic chest, do you notice the blood on the bottom right, this, you will have to sacrifice
2334080	2339280	health in order to access this chest, now I am going to do it because we have the wafer,
2340000	2349200	whoop, whoop, we got a bomb and some money again, not, not absolutely not, the chest
2349200	2352720	cannot hurt you, once you've opened up the mimic chest cannot hurt you, so don't worry,
2353600	2358080	the sac room will give us a lot of piggy bank money, you are absolutely correct little rifling,
2358080	2364720	thank you for reminding me, I think we're gonna do it, I think we're gonna be a bit crazy
2364720	2371360	into the sacrifice room, now I will talk through the sacrifice room and I will give you all the
2371360	2375840	secret deets and all, but the reason we're gonna do it is because it's going to significantly
2375840	2381920	raise our, or it should anyway, significantly raise our angel chance which means we don't have to skip
2381920	2390160	a floor of no chance, it's very good to try and avoid having no kind of reward, now you'll always
2390160	2395600	have a boss item, you'll always have a treasure room, don't get me wrong, again we have the bible,
2395600	2403600	right, there should be a pay to win machine in here, ah, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
2403600	2408400	have satanic bible, right, those flies can't hurt you but they can take away charges on your active
2408400	2415120	item, so for example satanic bible has six active charges, those little guys will come and bop you
2415120	2420720	and all you'll hear is mew, mew, we are not gonna spend our money just yet because I want to see
2420720	2427760	what the shop has to offer but we might purposely roll for conjoined, let's see what the shop has
2427760	2434000	to say first before we make a decision, okay, now we are just gonna kind of run around, we are
2434000	2441520	getting poison damage by our familiar, very happy with that, again free, there, no, okay unfortunately
2441600	2447520	it's a, no, okay, the more money you hold in your hand the more likely you are to spawn a greed
2447520	2452240	fight, this is called a greed fight, there are no items in the shop, we are very lucky to have the
2452240	2458800	membership passive which means we do still have access to a shop down below, it's not restockable,
2460320	2468240	I'm like 99% sure it's not restockable the way we, this shop would be, oh no, gammy,
2468560	2474800	you're too late, I messed up, I lost some hearts for that, I suck, gammy, I've let you down but
2474800	2482400	thank you for your service, gamgoo, we appreciate you, okay, let's see what we're looking at,
2482400	2490160	we've got a necronomic, we can sacrifice, 50% chance for a treasure room, I think we're on floor
2490160	2496320	three so there's like three more, no, no, we're better with restock, we have very good economy,
2496320	2502400	look at A.C. just hiding behind the ladders, A.C. do you want to, oh well there you go, we are
2502400	2510000	going to do the sacrifice room now because again we have the wafer which makes sacrifice rooms
2510000	2520000	very worth its while and I'm feeling lucky, okay so because I have the item description it tells
2520000	2526560	me exactly what's coming up next, 50% chance for a coin, do you feel, are you feeling lucky
2526560	2534560	brief ones, are you, oh yeah right because we have piggy bank we got more, okay we didn't
2534560	2541280	actually get a payout so look 67% chance for an increase, we didn't get it, of course we didn't,
2541280	2548080	okay we've got a chest, let's go, bomb and a key, lovely, lovely, okay are, wow it only did 6% are you
2548080	2559360	serious, okay okay yeah one more, right we got our heart back that's fine so this one
2561280	2568320	you bop it, run out, run away, run inside, spawn the angel and go bombs, go fuck them up,
2568320	2575440	fuck them up, go gammy, go gammy, go, right the reason why we're destroying this angel,
2575440	2579760	yes I know there's a host in the corner I'm trying to avoid him, the reason we do this is
2579760	2586000	because we now have two key pieces, look our angel it has increased again I shouldn't have picked
2586000	2595520	that up yet, okay this is the last upgrade, it's 50-50, money or soul hearts, okay this is very good
2595520	2601360	for us we're gonna keep the restock box, trinket, it means there'll be a restock machine that spawns
2601360	2608240	in our lovely jubbly treasure room, item room and we are gonna focus on that, I am now going to use
2608240	2615120	satanic bible because we're going to try and maximize our hearts now that we've done that so
2615680	2621440	we're just gonna roll, I see you're right on top of the item so it's a bit hard to tell what we're
2621440	2630000	looking at, no not very good, unfortunately we actually have too many soul hearts etc
2630960	2635600	and we don't need to spawn Gabriel because we have a full key piece already so there's no need to
2635600	2642960	spawn Gabriel, no need at all we've got full key it will not increase our angel chance or anything
2642960	2650320	like that don't worry and so again candy to heart we can't even utilize well we have far too much
2650320	2657520	soul and black hearts or neck hearts, it's not a bad item but it's not what I'm looking for I
2658000	2667280	really prefer conjoined right now, I mean I mean it's all right it's not terrible but it's not
2667280	2673920	quite what we're looking for, the d20, if only we were in greed mode I
2677280	2683040	I don't care that was very unfortunate that we didn't get a conjoined for that
2683760	2689600	and we cannot enter the battle dome because we're not 1 hp sometimes it will open up under
2689600	2695360	other circumstances but that was very unlucky and that we didn't really get I should have taken that
2695360	2701600	and was it not the cloak wheel now we have such high economy it's definitely worth it to go to
2701600	2708960	this judgment he's not a beggar he's a judgment right so bombs are a two tile radius so one tile
2708960	2715200	two tiles does that make sense there we go and then we're just gonna jam ourselves in the corner
2715840	2716640	and then this judge
2721280	2727520	two coin judgment streamer luck two coin judgment is insane
2729920	2735840	two coin judgment gash galley okay I don't like him because he sprints halfway across the map
2736720	2744160	that is insane streamer luck two coin judgment judgment normally asks for a pretty penny off of
2744160	2750080	you I'm talking around um at least 15 like almost an exchange rate at the shop truly
2750560	2755760	um that was insane we're just gonna check I think the secret room might be somewhere in here
2755760	2763280	unfortunately I am very bad at finding obscure secret rooms yeah um we'll just press onwards
2763280	2772080	and maybe it's outside the boss room um but a cheap day on oh well okay whoa that's so good
2772080	2779440	as well come here please thank you now um do you notice how the water almost looks like an arrow
2779440	2787520	pointed to here you know what I'm not gonna speak again for the evening um thank you for listening
2787520	2793600	to me it's been fantastic uh I was going to say the game likes to hint where the secret room is to
2793600	2800240	you normally it can be there so yeah unfortunately our super secret room is elsewhere please I am
2800240	2806000	embarrassed do not acknowledge that now we're gonna keep the joker card on us in case of failure
2806000	2812160	because this will take us to the angel no matter what okay we've got bumbo the poor lad just wants
2812160	2820000	a bit of cash honestly um bumbo has a secret ah gammie please I'm doing so terrible please gammie
2820000	2826400	um bumbo has a secret if he picks up I think seven to nine coins he will actually spot I am
2826400	2833840	just not dodging anything at all thank goodness we have the wafer so we did fail but we have conjoined
2835200	2838560	so conjoined means our damage goes down but what do you notice
2838960	2848160	shot superiority gained oh yeah baby now we're gonna use the joker card to get us to our angel deal
2850720	2857120	and it's absolute caca thanks for the waste of time mate uh see this is the problem that I have
2857120	2863120	with Isaac you have angel and devil deals that don't give you anything so this is an example of
2863120	2868080	you should have gone the devil and you shouldn't have wasted your joker card but we're gonna go back
2868080	2874640	and pick up our little black room here because it's very op thank you thank you oh wait I am going
2874640	2880480	to use the black room on the d20 and we will hopefully get some sort of stat upgrade that is
2880480	2889360	useful and not to range because we already have 10 range is that tears right okay we got tears right
2889360	2894880	up I'll take it tears right up we have quite efficient now I cannot guess where the secret room
2894880	2902640	is I already popped the bomb there I'm sorry I'm just looking at the map for a possibility but
2902640	2909200	unfortunately these kind of the bigger the map gets the weaker my guesses are did we do this
2911040	2916160	am I being done I've already done the shop look I'm in no rush before and it's like
2916160	2921520	eh you're taking so long to play the game relax chase chase we're just trying to enjoy ourselves
2922400	2926560	I think it's right above you possibly all right we're gonna buy this car because we might as well
2926560	2932240	right we've got the full card I'm gonna keep um I never played this game but I'm impressed with
2932240	2937920	the amount of detail oh it's a very good game I thought here right we've only got three bombs so
2937920	2946160	this is it one or done nah all right we're out we're already we're out of 5000 um but yes we
2946160	2950880	if we pick up one more book we also get bookworm which means we'll spam even more shots
2951600	2958400	for the price of no passive really um but we're just gonna go next I don't see any tinted rock in
2958400	2962960	this room sometimes a boss fight has I don't know if it has a higher chance of a tinted rock
2962960	2971200	but I seem to personally have a bias eh straight up fire rate yes sorry did I say the wrong thing
2971200	2976320	fire rate yeah my tears come out faster so this is a different kind of battle dome room
2976560	2985120	um we could full card it if we want however if we do this we get more uh active item
2987040	2990960	entering a new floor that's it's not bad but because we have such high economy
2991680	2998480	eh see we've just charged our active bar there and these enemies aren't oh my gosh why do I have
2998480	3005920	such terrible damage I know I just took conjure at conjure conjoined as well which doesn't make
3005920	3011600	this any easier oh I freaking hate these guys so much you can only hit them on the back of their head
3013040	3017360	gammy why don't you come out like when I'm not perishing how about you come out like
3017360	3024640	right now gammy and just deal with them please I'm so bad you can get I can't remember what the
3024640	3030320	trinkets called it gives you a one in five chance of spawning a bird pair kill in the room uh I
3030320	3037040	absolutely adore it whoa that was good that shatter right we're doing it we're doing it so for this
3037040	3043360	room that's a yuck heart we actually don't want that it's worth not a full heart if that makes sense
3043360	3049120	it's worth half a heart it does let you have a blue fly though that goes after enemies but it's not for
3049120	3058000	me that's this niche for my um so that those two fires might indicate the secret room is also there
3058000	3064320	the game likes to do double fires a lot can you stop pooping please um the game loves to do
3064320	3070320	double fires like absolutely adores it I can't stop it normally again it's another indication
3070320	3079200	that the secret room might be there no I don't I don't know if we're doing the curse oh okay so that
3079200	3086800	was another hint no it wasn't I just suck at this game you know what you know what game you embarrass
3086960	3092080	me anymore I'm taking it up with a pope or something are you drunk right we're not going in those rooms
3092080	3096880	anymore we're actually not going in the cursed room anymore we've had absolutely nothing from it
3096880	3102800	I've been they're making a mockery out of me they're making a mockery out of me right sorry any pop
3102800	3112720	satanic bible um so we actually now have no angel deal chance what the heck am I mistaken
3113120	3120160	because I pulled a joker card wait if I completely messed up this run I mean honestly we can go to
3120160	3127440	the devil because of how much HP and the wafer in combination so honestly I'm not that mad I'm not mad
3127440	3134880	I promise I'm not mad bro I'm not absolutely raging at the fact that uh we've just lost angel deals
3134880	3139840	for some reason it must have been because I pulled the joker card um but this is the game that I
3139840	3145280	learned tarot cards in I know we've been playing balutro recently or balutro as I call it um
3146560	3150880	normally the wee secret room does spawn in this room in between these guys but I wasn't paying
3150880	3155200	attention to where they spawned the enemies will also give you a hint if they're here but fuck it we'll
3155200	3165040	try it I give it wait satanic bible raise took away my angel deal
3168640	3175920	it's not fair give it back oh I hate these guys oh my god they like extend their neck
3175920	3180960	if you get too close to you oh come on give me come on give me bend and spoon come on give me bend
3181840	3185600	yeah boss oh for goodness sake right okay well I've kind of gone on a bit of a side quest
3185600	3193280	that was useless poster oh my god please I'm not even hitting anything these guys in the middle
3193280	3200560	are just getting a free wall upon me honestly right again we're now full health actually thanks to
3200560	3206000	the satanic bible right there we go boom and we got a key which is good uh unfortunately yeah as
3206000	3214240	the game gets larger and larger map wise I find it much so harder to find the secret rooms unless
3214240	3220640	we can get blue treasure map in the shop potentially potentially blue treasure map allows you to see
3220640	3225920	the secret and super secret room it does not reveal the ultra secret room but again we need red
3225920	3232800	key to access that which we did pass on and I'm not familiar if there's any I see please um
3233360	3238560	they're not too wow we've completely changed we don't have so many keys but hardly any bombs
3238560	3242960	whoa scary guy we're just gonna spray them down in the middle
3245040	3250560	how weak how weak is our attack holy crap we need like a damage anything please again we have
3250560	3256080	another heart this is a unique room I don't recall ever being in it you can play this game for hours
3256080	3261840	upon hours and enter a room layout you've never seen before in your life super secret rooms are
3261840	3268400	usually close to the boss and connected to only one room okay they're not like this room
3270400	3278480	okay okay uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh whoa it dropped a uh chest uh are these called globes or something
3280880	3284720	whoa we have a guppy it's very unlikely we're gonna get guppy
3284960	3290400	I don't hate infestation
3293520	3295680	I feel like we can get something better though
3298240	3305040	I hate it wait no I hate it stop giving me active I um
3308080	3309360	huh right
3309600	3318400	the reason I'm taking this is because it can phd it turns all bad pills to good
3319040	3324800	and it can put your stats up I get yet instantly we've been gratified by our choice our speed is
3324800	3332800	now up we can also take pills which is fantastic um I ran away from this pill what we got 48 hour
3332800	3336880	energy which is not quite what we're looking for but that's okay but like again if there's
3336880	3338880	no pills in the shop we can utilize
3342880	3352560	okay so okay right get them gammy get them gammy that's right so if you're incredibly unlucky
3352560	3358800	and you have a lot of money on hand your chance of getting super greeds goes up it's exponentially
3358800	3365200	and we have been very unlucky to now miss out on two freaking shops but we did get an item pedestal
3365200	3369360	I'm not gonna pick it up just yet in case there's some trickery you picked it up and dropped it again
3369360	3377200	did I actually oh my god what are you lunch no what are you the livers what are you
3378080	3383680	yera which duplicates whatever goodness I mean
3387120	3393440	that's terrible yeah I have to admit this is probably the most frustrating mechanic
3393520	3398960	I am playing normal mode the odds of us getting greed actually shouldn't be that high but
3400240	3406800	if you play hardcore mode for unlocks you without fail yera
3408560	3415200	I'm gonna hold on to yera yera duplicates so if we find something like a a pill maybe the um
3416000	3424640	does is good so we are full money there's a room I didn't explore off to the side here my bed oh well
3430240	3436240	I shouldn't have discovered it I take it all back but anyway we can take pills now and when we do
3436240	3443840	blood donation machines we get even more money for it unfortunately we are having just terrible
3443840	3454560	luck trying to get what we need um we don't need any of that the lean bags secret room is left of
3454560	3463760	the treasure room do you solemnly swear wifling that is your final decision left of the treasure room
3464640	3470400	okay if this if this secret room is not here you're being timed out
3470640	3475280	whoa the bomb follow does ah we just wasted a bomb doing that
3478240	3484000	no one move it okay you're not being timed out congrats unfortunately we are full
3484880	3490160	we are very full of coins and we have nowhere to spend it and we destroyed the donation machine
3490160	3495600	and we don't have an arcade machine uh arcade level I think arcade spawns every odd even four
3495600	3500080	if you have five coins or more something like that um
3502560	3506320	unfortunately we don't have enough bombs to try and find the super secret room
3507280	3511360	what we got looky a bit of looky oh yeah a bit of looky
3514160	3522240	yeah you like that yeah unfortunately he's a bam and uh yeah I'm gammie you know I meant that
3522240	3527120	that was actually a tactical move to unlock gammie so gammie does all the work for us it was a
3527120	3532400	tactical move it was a tactical move stop it stop calling me a new bin Isaac look I play it for fun
3532400	3538560	okay too many sweats and Isaac too many sweats and Isaac this is what I just played for fun see gammie
3538560	3544160	does all the work if there is ever a game where it was all about familiars I'll be in the development
3544160	3548800	team because I like when the familiars do the work and I get to lay back and just enjoy the game
3548800	3553920	I get to enjoy the music the aesthetics I get to enjoy the game design like come on come on go gammie go
3555680	3560720	oh we get flay absolutely we are gonna take that and we're gonna pop satanic bible and we're
3560720	3570560	gonna see what satan has to offer us we might actually get guppy the odds of getting guppy are
3570560	3579600	like so rare we might actually do it holey moley well now that we have flight we're gonna take a
3579600	3587440	little uh detour so when you have flight uh floor spikes can't stop you um I'm gonna grab that heart
3588720	3595280	um but uh obviously you're not limited to the floor um crazy concept of the flight I know um I
3595280	3602000	know I should probably take up through his head but uh due to the fact that satanic bible will help
3602000	3607680	me out with health I oh but you have wafer you have wafer I know I know but I suck you can see I
3607680	3615120	suck and to be honest we're actually not doing I should have taken the full card not that we're
3615120	3622800	gonna be able so are you gonna point and do in this room because yeah I was gonna say if it's money
3622800	3629120	then what's the point all right let's go oh flight is just so easy oh wait no there's gonna be a
3629120	3635280	full card in this floor anyway um if I wanted to use it but it's not like we can get boss rush
3635280	3641440	it's been an hour and we've not even perished mother dearest the most basic mother dearest
3642320	3647760	mom's heart is it mom's heart no mom's heart it's the next one it's just man
3648080	3654960	oh I should stop picking up coins oh the spider's coming at you no I'm hiding get away from me
3656080	3661360	go away I'll let go away I'll let my familiars deal with you go away no I'm not taking any
3661360	3667040	damage because you guys are ganging up on me so you notice that um black one over there how his
3667040	3671920	pathing's given up because he's like I can't reach you it's actually quite humorous to do that in
3671920	3680080	the game I like it um the game's just like I cannot reach you I give up um the game also has a soft
3680080	3686960	lock feature um if you're in a room for too long uh the game will actually unlock it itself because
3686960	3691680	it's like hold on a minute something isn't right you should be out of this room by now basically
3691920	3702800	uh a treasure room for free sure sure okay mother's bra no we'll pass but thank you for
3702800	3710800	the kind offer though uh an orbital no we don't really let enemies get that close to us a coin no
3711360	3717840	no not on health either oh we're gonna say we no that's an act
3721600	3730720	poggers poggers wait triple oh wait we okay we're gonna we're going up in damage but hold on let me
3730720	3737200	cook hold on hold on let's see the damage let's see what happens whoo okay hold on wait I may have
3737200	3741440	messed up a little bit but it's fine it's fine I actually don't mind this it's cute it's cute look at
3741440	3748800	it look at it going everywhere we're just oh a Christmas miracle and we get f all of course we
3748800	3755760	get f all right hopefully there's an item down here won the run with that literally now we could get
3755760	3763760	midnight snack I don't want too many red hearts oh wait no the devil's gonna ask for that um
3763760	3772240	automatically charges the first bar yeah if we could get that in greed mode that in the sprinkler
3772240	3778160	that'd be great yeah that's all I need okay unfortunately the last shops have been yeah this
3778160	3784480	is the last shop it's been uh rather disappointing I'll just buy stuff because I can really um
3785600	3792000	justice uh justice yeah this is where I learned my tarot cards from justice gives you one of each
3792000	3796960	pick up basically uh it does have a chance to give you a troll bomb that's on the town side
3796960	3805920	um we are gonna just quickly kablamo these guys um have I used the bible this I'm gonna make sure
3805920	3813360	to get an extra devil item because we are we're starting to not be now we do have flight the
3813360	3818880	mobility that you get from flight is very important for like dodging enemies like for example this enemy
3818880	3823840	I can I call me Duke can you come because I'm juking his ankles or something I don't know um
3825680	3831760	maybe the secret room above here nope it's not uh that was why it's good to check rooms
3831760	3835520	but like see how we're doing so much damage from across the room it's kind of splitting
3836160	3844800	chat it's splitting um like oh fantastic again because of flight we don't have to spend a bomb
3844800	3851840	and we can just see what's in this rubbish rubbish don't waste our time so again we can
3851840	3857680	kind of hide behind items as well that obscure the enemy shots of us um the let's say the secret
3857680	3862720	room might be here nope okay I will never speak again it looks like the secret room might be
3862720	3869200	somewhere I don't know well we can pick this up now that's the name I haven't heard in a while
3869200	3876480	what Duke you come that's a lot of words too bad I ain't reading them um
3878720	3882640	no not here what the heck not there either
3886000	3891040	the only problem with conjoined uh was it hetero chromium or whatever I've forgotten the name
3891040	3898880	of the the shooty one um it gets very chaotic on the screen very messy on the screen I mean it could
3898880	3903920	be to the left here one of our secret rooms I don't want to take any damage for this room though
3906320	3912000	um and also notice how our tears we're kind of having to like guess okay thank goodness
3913200	3920240	whoa no no no oh okay if this guy gets bombed he does not perish bomb beggar does not perish to
3920240	3927760	bombs if you enrage him basically now I'm not gonna it's a shame he's not a general uh
3928480	3933760	judgment or a bit oh well I don't know we might get we might get a rock out of this
3934960	3941680	we did we got a small rock okay thankfully damage up again sorry my voice just cracked out of
3941680	3950560	excitement uh we got damage up again oh holly molly sorry uh clearly uh playing uh fixed game if you
3950560	3962080	wanted to play the uh seed with me it's tka1gv1y um if you want to play the seed don't you don't
3962080	3967920	have to where the heck is the boss room oh I've walked past it sorry sorry I literally I was like
3967920	3975360	there's a chance it could be small rock in here now notice this room and now if we don't kill her
3975360	3983920	notice how you see mom's eyes coming through the door holes etc um and she's going Isaac Isaac
3983920	3990480	okay keep that in mind keep in mind before I say what I'm gonna say next after the fight
3990480	4006320	oh I didn't even know you were in here sorry oh we failed the devil deal which is a shame
4007280	4014640	right did you notice how she was looking through the door almost as if she was peeping inside the
4014640	4023200	chest and she finds Isaac and she's trying to desperately get inside we're still on time for
4023200	4028880	boss rush one you're hilarious two oh my gosh I took me an hour to get to the mum fight the most
4028880	4036800	basic level six mum fight um but yes uh when I talk about my uh when I do the review on this game
4036800	4042480	which I'm very excited to do um I'm gonna talk about all my little theories because everyone's
4042480	4047360	like got different theories about it but mine's like the reason why everything's rectangular is
4047360	4054800	because it's you in the chest but um you heard your mum go Isaac we are gonna go down and we're
4054800	4061520	picking up even more damage um the satanic bible doesn't work on that floor but that's fine
4061520	4068960	no boss rush but maybe hush are you joking me you guys are having a Fibonacci sequence on me because
4068960	4078880	you're you're having me on what was that range okay okay right I'm just gonna pop satanic bible
4078880	4086000	now it doesn't really matter if we take damage because um range you'll notice the tears aren't
4086000	4092160	actually hitting we're just having to guess the path of the tears it's not when you have this
4092160	4097920	I've completely forgotten the name of that item when you have it you're not really actually aiming
4097920	4103680	to hit directly with the tear you're even in front of them now our luck is gone up which means our
4103680	4113520	drop rate on items uh is gone up which is nice and cool do appreciate um but we're just gonna
4114080	4121200	walk around have a little uh have a peek into all the rooms we're not really we are not in
4121200	4125760	trouble let's just say we're not in trouble I feel confident about this run I was a bit nervous
4126400	4133200	uh he hemo claria hold on hold on hold on wait hold on need to stop swallowing what are you
4133200	4143120	swallowing stop it someone is swallowing a hemo lacrea okay that's it hemo lacrea yeah you have
4143120	4151600	to aim a bit funny we're hemo lacrea sorry let's do me a hold second now because what right if this
4151600	4161920	isn't a guppy item you're not forgiving game close enough close enough uh what are you spawns a devil
4163680	4170400	are you joking come on that's rubbish right we're gonna do it
4170960	4174480	I was a terrible idea
4176960	4185520	come on chaos card I mean I'll take it oh he gave us two hearts what the heck sure

5380540	5382540	I

5392780	5398020	Just don't mess up chaos car chaos card only kills one phase. I thought that

5626300	5633180	Wasn't even there am I going crazy help help help actually have to do the Satan fight with cursae I
5634420	5636420	Wasn't on that side of the map though
5638220	5640820	Please guppy's flies do it please
5642380	5644380	Please
5644420	5646420	Please guppy, please
5647420	5651140	I got me baby boy. Come on guppy. Oh
5652020	5654020	We did it delirium
5654860	5657300	Delirium no, but we did it
5658020	5660700	The rift sucked my card. Oh
5662300	5664820	We did it yatta. Oh
5665860	5667860	For goodness gravy
5668700	5672540	Goodness gravy cursed I an exchange of guppy
5673260	5674860	Oh
5674860	5680940	Through Isaac he sees himself as a bad boy, but he's not a bad boy. We did it first try that was crazy
5680940	5683700	I kept my card got sucked out of my hand
5683700	5688220	It literally was like when something gets blown in the wind that you're hold on holding I
5689500	5693220	Can't believe we did that. I was ready to go to delirium for the hell of it. Oh
5694100	5696100	This is such a creepy credit
5702860	5704860	Oh
5707700	5712340	It's such a creepy credit, but oh my god, how did we do that?
5713740	5717180	Flex missed the chaos card to prove that you didn't need it
5717180	5723380	Honestly that run could not have gone any better Satanic Bible. I have to admit is fantastic
5724580	5730660	You get unlimited health from it statistically when you find energies around the map you get unlimited health
5731580	5735820	You get extra devil deal items on top of what you're doing. Anyway, I'm
5736700	5740180	Satan and shambles literally Ed McMillan. I hope it's the next time
5740180	5745020	And Ed McMuffin is currently working on a game called me eugenics
5745500	5750100	Which I'm very excited for its release. Sadly. There was a bit of delay in development
5750100	5757420	And due to a few issues and him adding on extra things and I will say that I've played Isaac
5757420	5763860	I definitely feel and I have got my money's worth and
5765420	5770020	From it yellow baby, wait, I'm not I actually unlocked something there
5771820	5774020	Wait, did I not do mega Satan on?
5776020	5782220	Who was it who's a plane on Eden? I didn't do mega. Wait, where the fuck is Eden Eden? There you are. Oh
5782620	5784620	Wow, I never actually had the thing
5785420	5790220	Is it over? Um, no, we're gonna do one very cheeky
5790940	5792940	greed mode with
5793100	5797020	Lilith and then yeah, we did it. We won though
5798540	5805060	I've faith Isaac and super meat boy. We're both incredible. Yes, I believe you unlocked a court, baby
5805660	5811220	Yeah, I can't believe we did that right. We're gonna do a little greed mode. I'm just gonna show you greed mode
5811220	5817780	It's super simple to get the grass Bob. A lot of people don't seem to enjoy it. I for one enjoy it
5817900	5824140	So I've got my little sookie bus, but look I have no eyeballs, so I can't cry if you didn't em know
5824820	5832780	The attack in these games are about crying because poor Isaac is crying himself. Um, so this is a room
5833340	5839540	It is a rectangular long rectangle. Um, they are going to be 10 phases
5839620	5844100	You might notice that there that little 10 there that is saying what phase we're on
5844740	5848900	There will be 10 fights in this room back to back to back to back
5850100	5854740	There is a timer to tell you in the next comment. There's a locked door. There's an open room
5855380	5858660	And we're going to get a range upgrade and a heart. We're going to hope
5859220	5865300	Unfortunately, we did not get a soul or a necro heart. That's okay. 169 tokens exactly
5866260	5872660	Now curious deep pockets, we're not probably gonna get anything like that. Oh anonymous
5873940	5876100	Thank you so much for the tip. I'm glad you
5876980	5879940	Enjoyed my victory royale literally flexing on them
5880580	5883060	So in greed mode your only
5883700	5890420	Opportunity to make money is via fights and that is the only way you can upgrade your stuff. Okay
5891780	5893300	so
5893380	5898020	Um, but there's a few hidden a few hidden differences. Okay a few hidden differences
5898980	5900980	um, we can
5901460	5903060	Bomb these
5903060	5905220	Keepers here. These are passed away keepers
5906100	5913220	Um, and we actually have a higher chance of getting things like keepers head for example or steam sail for example
5914020	5917060	They have a high chance of dropping a cheeky quarter
5917780	5919780	No, not quarter five cents
5920660	5922180	um
5922180	5927300	But yes, so we want to try and get a key which is five bucks to get into our room now
5927780	5931860	Because we are lileth. We don't really want an active item at all. We like
5932500	5936580	Look now we have two we have double the firepower because of that move
5937380	5943860	So, uh, this can get out of hand very quickly. Thankfully lileth is the easiest to play
5944500	5947620	In greed mode. I just kind of want to show you off. But as you see there's a timer
5948420	5949860	um
5949860	5955620	Those we enemies are doing their thing again. We are getting a active every time new enemies come in
5955620	5958420	We're getting an active so now we have three firing power
5959140	5966420	Um, we definitely want to clear enemies as fast as they come in because once you do not want overwhelmed on the map
5966500	5972740	As soon as you get overwhelmed that's when your health takes a tank and it is very hard to try and
5973300	5977220	Like it's expensive to try and roll for a soul heart for example
5977540	5983780	Again, we now have four firing power. Please don't touch me. Please. Oh really don't want that really don't want that
5984740	5986740	um
5987220	5992420	Really don't want that but hey, oh it happened. We're gonna stay in we're gonna do what's called the boss fight
5993300	5997380	Um, that was very unlucky though very unlucky. Um
5998740	6002180	So these flies can shoot out. Sorry my fingers getting sore
6002660	6007700	I actually should take a picture of my controller to show you how intensely I play Isaac
6008340	6010340	So we have now completed
6010420	6016020	Um phase eight. So there's like an optional kind of you know boss fight if you will
6016740	6020340	Now the game. Oh, I shouldn't have popped that actually. That was very silly
6021140	6027060	Because we needed it for the next floor, but that's on me making mistakes and it's okay. You're allowed to make mistakes in the game
6027620	6029620	What is the enemy
6030660	6033700	Oh, it's you guys you stinkers
6034820	6038900	But yes, um, as you can see why it's easy on Lilith is you just
6039540	6045700	Continually get more and more damage and as you get any sort of upgrade you get rewarded for it. Okay
6046340	6051460	So Lilith is all about minions. Yeah, she is my favorite for greed mode because of
6052340	6057940	The familiar help. I love games that have familiar help. So that purple guy is called lust
6058020	6063460	I think if i'm remembering correctly, he will try to touch you. You need to try and juke him
6063540	6065540	Yeah, you need to get rid of him quickly
6065780	6067380	um
6067380	6072900	But the good thing with uh, we're actually gonna try and get rid of the baby first because he runs around erratically
6073460	6076580	Um, which is not good for us. Unfortunately. We have base speed
6078100	6080660	I can't see the enemy. Okay, we're fine
6081460	6084260	Now as much as I actually want to go for a devil deal
6086420	6089620	I'm not interested in greed mode in a devil deal. Okay
6090660	6094660	So unfortunately, we got absolutely nothing in here which sucks
6094740	6096740	But hey, so we're gonna get a key
6097220	6101460	And we're gonna see if we can get a bomb. Unfortunately, we don't have a bomb in this role
6101780	6104020	So we are gonna get a key and see what's in our active room
6105060	6107060	Our active room the purple guy
6107860	6112900	Uh, we've actually got spawns a random pickup. So that's not bad at all
6114580	6118500	And we're getting a lot of coins from the fires not bad at all indeed
6118740	6126500	Um, I'm going to avoid the curse room because we do not have the goods now. I could do a tier rates up here
6129220	6131540	It does seem a shame to miss out on it
6134020	6136580	But i'm kind of needing a bomb for next round
6138020	6140020	Oh
6142180	6145140	Decisions decisions. This is the problem with greed mode
6145860	6149780	All right. I'm against my my judgment. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna hope for a bomb
6150740	6152740	Sadly no bomb
6153620	6157140	Uh, I'm going to elect to keep my money for the next floor
6158100	6163220	Um coat hanger pretty good. Yes. So now look how fast it is. Look at him go up here up here up here up here
6163220	6165220	Yeah
6165460	6172260	Yes, I always wait for a round with discounted item and try and do that. Yes. That is a very viable tactic
6174260	6176260	Uh, sure
6176820	6178820	Sure, why we don't even have eyes
6179700	6184740	But sure now we can buy a key to instantly get access to that room to see what's going on
6186900	6189700	Interesting another tears up
6194180	6196180	Now we're gonna keep
6197940	6199940	Hold on we're gonna use this key
6202580	6204580	We're gonna buy two keys
6205220	6207220	Okay, let me cook. Let me cook
6207620	6212740	We're gonna unlock one of these to get a bomb because we need it for the angel fight. We're gonna do
6214420	6216420	Uh, we're gonna bomb him
6216820	6218820	Wow
6220180	6221860	Wow
6221860	6224980	Normally they almost always drop something we're gonna see what's in here
6224980	6228500	I've got Bob's head using the iron and firing it throwing the head explodes where it lands
6230260	6236980	Uh, we're gonna try and find the the secret. Oh no, I can't be in here. I can't be in here rubbish rubbish
6238100	6240100	Well, we're just gonna eat it out of the wall. I guess
6240820	6242820	I
6242820	6244180	No, there you go
6244180	6249380	Didn't get it didn't get it. Where'd the angel deal chance go? It only comes up after the boss fight
6249380	6253060	So we're guaranteed an angel wait. I'm Lilith. Hold on
6253940	6258100	Hold on a minute. I might not be guaranteed it like a dumbass. I'm Lilith. I'm evil
6259460	6263380	I may have messed up slightly. I may have done a slight miscalculation
6263940	6267140	Is it Lilith? Because I know Bethany gives you a higher angel
6267860	6269860	So I
6270500	6272500	Unfortunately used up the last
6272740	6278180	Thing which I shouldn't have done. So we're actually down a little guy. Of course we have hosts
6278740	6286340	Hosts can easily overrun your game easily. So we really want rid of them like ASAP. That's really bad for
6286820	6288820	Whoa
6289540	6292340	You couldn't have done that before we spent our monies
6293300	6296420	Jeez, we got a golden key. That's such a shame
6297540	6301220	At least we can get two bombs. Oh my god, our pickup is going wild
6302260	6304260	Sorry, sorry. I'm getting too distracted
6304900	6306020	Sorry
6306020	6308020	What's going on down here?
6308500	6311620	Definitely don't want them coming near us because we don't want any damage
6313140	6315140	Oh my god. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh
6316660	6320980	That's what I'm saying. You can get overwhelmed just like that. Whoa, wait our bag is multiplying
6321380	6326020	I just noticed that like an idiot our bag is multiplying. What the heck?
6326180	6331300	I didn't know the the pickup bag's multiplied. I was like, why are we getting so much good stuff?
6332500	6334020	Whoa
6334020	6336020	That's hilarious
6338180	6340180	That is fun
6340580	6342580	That oh dear
6342740	6349780	Oh dear, we're now risky territory because if we go for the next ball. Oh, no. Oh, no
6351620	6354420	Putta madre. Oh, it's widow
6356100	6359540	What are you doing? What are you doing? Why are you not coming over? Do you not jump?
6361060	6363060	Whoa, what's going on?
6363060	6365460	Creamy little spider you are aren't you?
6366260	6368260	Spider girl confirmed for gin too
6369140	6371140	absolutely
6372020	6373780	No, um
6373780	6378900	Okay, we are playing it very risky right now, but I do not want to leave the room
6379860	6385220	So we're gonna we're gonna send it as the as the young one where the heck is the enemy
6385860	6391540	It's worms. It's wiggly worms and I completely missed all the damage against them
6393060	6395060	We got bombs though
6397140	6399140	Okay
6400740	6402740	We're really playing at risk
6404900	6406740	Okay
6406740	6410580	We're gonna bomb this angel. I don't think we can actually bomb it
6411460	6416340	We've not got enough health. We actually can't bomb the angel to increase our angel deal
6418340	6419940	It's okay
6419940	6424020	A worm confirmed for gen two actually for real for real though
6424980	6429700	A little wiggly worm that comes out of the ground and she has an obsession with your prostate
6431140	6433540	She just wants to poke it. She's like, I just want to poke it
6434500	6438820	Well, do it no ball. I I certainly do not have any balls. I assure you
6439700	6442740	I shite bag if you didn't I actually I'm a shite bag
6443460	6444500	right
6444500	6447860	Now we have a golden key so we can take these bombs for free
6449620	6453220	And we got penny back. We need to be very careful in between those spikes
6453620	6454500	now
6454500	6458180	Because we have treasure box conjoined is just
6459140	6460180	insane
6460180	6464420	The insanity of conjoined goes crazy. So I am going to buy this
6465620	6470340	Because it gets out of hand so quickly. Oh my god. They look like little diamond
6471780	6473780	Uh little diamond thingies
6474900	6476900	um
6477700	6482580	As much as getting a bone heart would be all right for going in and out the curse room
6482660	6484980	We actually don't have the money
6485620	6487620	No, we don't I mean we could
6488100	6490100	Now they have a higher payout rate
6492660	6494900	I mean we got five bombs for it. Sheesh
6496260	6504900	I'll take it. Uh, right as for where this hidden room is it's either in the curse room or it's right here
6507060	6509380	Yeah, the odds of it being here is pretty high
6509780	6516900	Decrease spawn rate of all hearts to 20 percent all black all hearts turn into black hearts
6517140	6521460	Increase the drop chance the keys. I even do anything. I think we'll just do lunch
6522580	6528980	I doubt I don't think that does anything in greed mode. Uh greed mode does negate a lot of different things. Um
6530180	6536420	But that's not here not there. Are all the beggars refillings. I'm seeing them really like in mummy
6536740	6540580	I know they've been so kind in greed mode. The rate goes up exponentially now
6541220	6544420	This is just a small thing you can do but you can actually bomb these
6545060	6550980	It will reroll but you can also get money back. So we've actually just been given the chance for damage
6552820	6554820	And we might spawn a Yara rune
6557620	6561220	No, this sprinkler this sprinkler is so good
6561860	6568660	Oh wait, but we're lily so we don't need the sprinkler. It's fine. Right. We have a shard rune
6570100	6575620	We are going to use it on a gemmed tailstone for the chance to do uh
6577140	6579140	What the fuck did that do
6579700	6584340	What did that do? Oh, it made something cheaper in the shop. Oh, I should have saved it for the next floor
6584740	6589220	I was hoping we were going to get a crawl space and it was going to have an item inside for us, but it's
6589220	6594660	Okay, right. We have no money, but we have bombs and we have two
6595540	6597780	Familiar well, we technically only have one for conjoined
6598980	6600980	It would affect the drops of your mystery bag
6602420	6605460	Okay, so we now have oh, no
6611540	6613540	Oh, it hurts
6613940	6615940	I
6618820	6620820	Mean dumb dumb
6621700	6624180	I forgot we had pain
6627380	6631940	Pain damage multiplier full health pain
6634580	6636580	Too measly pain
6637380	6639380	Now we are actually gonna be
6639940	6643700	It forced a bomb these to try and get a freaking hit
6648340	6650340	And I bet you if I had money it wouldn't be that
6651060	6653060	Exactly. Ah, that's right
6653700	6657300	Unfortunately, we are kind of getting a bit uh needing
6658740	6664340	A few things now. I'm going to hope my multiplied drops are going to do something
6666580	6669300	Okay spawns a devil burger. Um
6671940	6673940	One more for the gentleman in the back
6674660	6680260	And nothing. Wow, we we're having it rough out here. Let's hope there's something of
6680260	6682260	Um
6691780	6692900	We now
6692900	6701300	Do not have to aim. I repeat for those of you who do not know what homing spoon is. We do not have to aim
6702260	6703460	Let's
6703460	6704260	Go
6704260	6710020	We just need to do a rooty mick tootie in any direction talk about streamer luck
6710580	6717540	We do not need to aim the game will do it all for us. Oh, I love being a strummer
6717540	6722420	I just took health damage. Why is there a blinking light bulb? What is that?
6724020	6728580	What whoa, that's that's a lot of enemies. You're putting my money everywhere
6728820	6737060	Oh my god, we got a dame as well, which is 10 cents. Are we going eternal heart? Oh, I don't I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet
6738500	6741460	Holy moly. Look at all of this goodness
6742660	6744500	Holy moly
6744500	6748180	I'm gonna mow this one down because they're not very nice to go against
6749380	6751380	And then again
6751380	6752740	Here we go
6752740	6760100	Whoa, we're getting like special attacks as well now. They do throw bombs. He does throw bombs. So don't don't be too

7856820	7862500	So when you break the game because of how kind it's been. Oh, wow, we're unlocking super meat boy

7931620	7934340	Revelation right gently easy easy
7935300	7941300	Okay, duplicate everything and then we're going to look to see if there's an extra era just for the
7942260	7946100	Unlucky we've got full health on the sun. So let's pop that
7947460	7949860	And then we're going to grab oh the sun again
7949940	7953860	Of course, it was going to be the sun again because we uh did a thing called duplication. You dumb dumb
7954580	7959300	Roon shard. What did that do? Roon shard
7960260	7965540	Okay, we're gonna just do a little investigation on our our wares or trinkets
7966260	7969940	Unlucky room full ago. I know I guess there is another era though
7970660	7974660	Okay, let's go spend some of this goodness. We're gonna go to short speed
7976100	7979220	We don't really need luck although that gives us a soul heart and
7980180	7984660	Oh, no, I'm already full. Okay, let's spin. Wait, there might be a secret here
7985780	7987780	No, it must be down
7988340	7991380	Uh, we don't really need any of this
7992420	7999540	Can we duplicate spider baby? That would be cute. Oh sure. Oh wait. No, that was silly. Okay taking damage of this goods
8001060	8005220	Sponsor sack. I mean we're at the end of the game anyway. We don't really need it
8006180	8009620	Yeah, let's see what else we've got. We've got fun guy
8011940	8016340	I mean, what's underneath fun guy? We won. Oh, we got spun. We got spun feels good, man
8017780	8019780	Okay, let's uh
8020580	8022900	Wait, didn't I not bomb that or am I going crazy?
8027620	8030900	This is why Lilith is so broken in greed mode honestly
8032820	8034820	so
8035780	8043300	Are you fucking serious right now, right? Anyway, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine
8044180	8046180	I'm not mad
8047140	8052820	I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Okay. I'm not mad. I'm not raging. I'm not absolutely raging
8054180	8059700	I didn't even know the runes could do that to be honest. Oh home in tears as if I need it as if I need it
8060660	8066260	Right, I'll pick it up already. I mean I can Yara this room room, I guess
8067940	8069940	Yara
8070020	8072020	Give me my pennies
8072180	8073300	right
8073300	8081220	What can we can buy four more items as long as the restock machine? We don't need health now
8082500	8084500	As long as this doesn't blow up
8084580	8086100	What?
8086100	8091860	Okay, my only exception of going in here is for yeah, oh first wrong one. Oh, that's a bomb
8093140	8095140	Oh, we got gupsters
8095540	8097540	Oh, we got one gupsters
8098340	8100340	Yeah
8101220	8103540	And then we go pick up immaculate conception again
8104660	8110740	Active item can be overcharged if only you showed up a bit earlier right we'll take halo. That's a massive upgrade. Um
8111300	8114340	I mean, we've only got enough money for two more
8115300	8121780	Range on tapeworm. Why would the tapeworm give you range? Honestly, and then just bomb it because we've not got enough for anything else
8123940	8128900	Uh, oh, that's a shame. Uh, that's rubbish. Right. Uh, let's let's go
8129460	8136740	Um full health. We'll take it just in case but I'm not really too worried and as we take damage
8136820	8139460	We actually can spawn in more of the goodness
8140420	8143460	So we got guppy a wee bit of guppy, but that's fine
8144420	8146420	Now she finds sacred heart discounted to
8147060	8149060	Oh, literally
8149060	8151060	Oh, wait, there's another level to this
8152100	8152900	Oh
8152900	8154900	rubbish
8154900	8159540	Wait, how did you predict that? I would get sacred heart spawned in again
8161860	8168900	That the game literally said I'll be nice to you. That's funny though. It's okay though. Oh, there
8169780	8171780	Are sure the judgment why not?
8172020	8175300	Can't really do anything else with more money. So here you go buddy. All yours
8176500	8178820	I only have 15 coins. Don't be greedy now
8180980	8182980	I have the stars. Yeah, I'm not sure the
8184180	8188500	Hey, I only I only have three coins judgment. You're supposed to have an increased drop rate. Yeah, okay
8190660	8193700	Well, it is what it is
8194340	8203460	Okay, now there's normally we enemy in here. I'm not gonna pop my active for this room. That's just not worthy at all
8205140	8206660	Um
8206660	8209380	Can bomb the I mean it doesn't really do anything at this point
8212820	8214820	It's just the instant like
8216500	8218020	Uh
8218020	8219460	I don't know
8219460	8222420	Now we can purposely hurt ourselves
8223140	8225460	To get because we have nuns habit
8226180	8229540	If we purposely hurt ourselves, we can get charged and then that's another
8230660	8234740	Like batch of guys in to do damage. This is ridiculous
8235700	8237700	But as you can see, um
8238100	8243700	Lilith is a wee bit broken in greed mode. We literally aren't even fighting. He's not even near us
8244340	8246340	And we're just mowing this poor guy down
8247300	8249300	Like
8249460	8251460	We're not even
8251860	8254740	We no wild card necessary in this run
8255620	8259220	Oh my god, and we're dropping charges. We might actually get another
8259780	8261780	um
8262020	8269060	Chart if someone drops the chart, uh, you we could get another go out. I mean, it's done for honestly
8271540	8273540	It's done for
8274500	8276500	He he he
8277380	8279380	But yeah, that is greed mode
8283140	8287140	And I'm just pop it again so we can have another duplicate of everyone look at my gang
8287540	8291780	Look at my gang. My gang is amazing. This I've already done 99
8294020	8299700	20% jam rate as you can see I enjoy playing Lilith a lot in greed mode because you see the 20 percent jam rate
8299700	8303220	That means that machine is all fed by her and no one else
8303780	8311060	Um, that was a bad jam rate. But yes, that is greed mode. That is Isaac is a fantastic game
8311140	8313140	I cannot praise it enough. Um
8313780	8318980	You will lose so many hours in this. Why no phase two. We were not playing greedier mode
8319060	8323620	Greedier mode is a lot different than greed mode. I am not that strong in
8324740	8326740	Greedier mode
8326740	8328740	Oh, you remember that
8328820	8330020	um
8330020	8332900	That was complete streamer
8333380	8338500	Um rng complete streamer rng. That was insane. Um
8339700	8345220	I cannot believe that. I truly cannot believe that. Well, you play Isaac more and I mean in other streams. Yes in november
8345620	8347620	I'll be playing it with you
8349060	8350180	Um
8350180	8354660	But yes, this game has like an insane amount of items
8355620	8361380	Like in com in combinations you can do and as you can see an elite gamer like myself
8361540	8368100	Still hasn't unlocked everything yet. Look, I've still not unlocked everything and I have like hundreds of hours in this game
8369220	8373860	Um, but yeah, there's like look see look tons of stuff. I haven't unlocked
8375620	8379540	Eh, there's so all these items you unlock by playing the game
8379540	8381540	I
8382740	8386900	How fast it's doable to I'm not even fighting him absolute Chad menace
8387060	8390660	But yeah, as you can see a lot on the the last stuff not unlocked
8391620	8393380	Bloody guts
8393380	8395140	Lusty blood
8395140	8397140	Does he fuck?
8397140	8398900	Fuck his ass
8398900	8400420	But yeah, um
8400420	8405860	Absolutely fantastic game. Uh, you know make or break your run come. It's it's
8406500	8410740	Insanity the game started with, um
8411780	8413780	Ignore the death counter
8415060	8417620	Ignore the best street counter while you're at it as well
8418500	8420500	um
8421220	8423940	It's just I cannot praise the game enough. Um
8424980	8427540	You know, there's tons of endings in the game
8429140	8431140	Well, I'll show you the true ending
8431140	8435060	That makes me very sad, but this is a true ending
8461140	8463140	His mother mourning the loss
8464260	8467940	He saw his father leaving them without turning to say goodbye
8468740	8473060	He saw his mother sleeping and his father taking money from her purse
8474100	8478900	He heard the late night fights they had that kept him up at night and the guilt
8478900	8481220	He felt for what he believed he was causing
8482260	8485540	He felt the pain in his stomach during those sleepless nights
8486260	8489140	And saw his shadow in the closet waiting for him
8489940	8492500	As he rose he felt his fears drop
8496580	8501700	I cried so hard the first time as he became lighter his ascent became faster
8502820	8505620	He saw his one true companion alive
8506900	8510980	He saw his mother and father together again holding each other
8511700	8515300	He felt his mother kissing him on the head after he had said his prayers
8515700	8518740	And the comfort in knowing someone was watching over him
8519540	8526260	He saw his own birth and the faces of his parents filled with joy and optimism
8527060	8528260	And then
8528260	8530260	He saw nothing
8530580	8533140	Are you sure this is how you want this story to end Isaac?
8534020	8536500	You're the one writing it. It doesn't have to end this way
8537460	8538420	Here
8538420	8540420	How about we tell it a different way?
8540820	8542820	Maybe a happy ending
8544260	8545620	Good
8545620	8547620	Are you getting sleepy yet?
8547620	8548660	Yeah
8548660	8550660	Okay, so
8551220	8556980	Isaac and his parents lived in a small house and that's the start of the that's the opening of the game
8557620	8560660	So that ending a lot of people misinterpret it
8561300	8563300	a certain way
8563620	8571940	But Ed McMuffin has confirmed multiple times that yes, Isaac dies in the chest. He is a dead five-year-old in a chest
8572820	8576500	The ending people couldn't make heads or tails of because that male voice
8576740	8581700	Male on stream and that male voice you hear is his dad annunciate in the game. Okay
8582980	8586500	But the reason I want to point it out to you is because
8587060	8589060	Isaac has been
8589140	8591940	You know, he's got religious trauma. So he's being told
8592660	8595540	If i'm a good boy, I go to heaven all my fears go away
8595940	8600020	So as he's in his final moments as he slips away
8600500	8606740	In his head after defeating all these enemies these endless waves of bosses. He's done everything he possibly could
8607620	8609620	he feels
8609620	8610980	the fear
8610980	8611940	and
8611940	8616020	The guilt just melt off his body as he finally slips
8616580	8622980	And passes away inside the chest. He can see that third perspective of his mum finding him
8622980	8627140	He can see that third perspective of him watching over because um
8627860	8630020	In the male in the dad's voice he goes
8630420	8636340	Are you sure you want this story to end this way Isaac and Isaac says? Yes. I want it to be over
8636500	8642660	I want it to be why did you show us this because people can't figure out what the ending means and i'm gonna mention it
8642740	8647700	I'm gonna mention it in my little review and be like, why is this open to interpretation? It's very clear
8648180	8650180	If if Ed McMuffin goes
8650580	8652260	Isaac perishes
8652260	8657860	Everyone's like oh, but the fight the fight. He's away in heaven. No Isaac perished. He's been taught about heaven
8658180	8662900	This entire game is about being taught religion dogma all this stuff
8663380	8664420	he
8664420	8666820	Thinks he's going to heaven in his last moments
8666820	8672180	He feels no guilt because he's done everything this entire thing is in his head. He is in a chest
8672500	8674500	Adroni, Adroni explains the Bible
8674820	8680900	Sorry, I'm like clapping me hands. I'm like, who do she wants this to be to breath right delirium ending is that ending 21?
8680900	8682900	19 is delirium
8683140	8685140	No, this is the mother fight
8685780	8687780	in 20
8690580	8692580	So
8694260	8696260	Is this still this isn't delirium
8698900	8700900	Are you sure these three are hand clapping
8702020	8706660	Why are you just drawing the game for me close the game's been out for 10 years?
8707060	8714740	It's the 10 year anniversary this year. Do don't come here being like you're running the game 10 years this game's been out for
8715540	8719780	You're not coming to me being like no you've given me spoilers. No, I'm not having that
8720980	8724420	10 years you've had a you've had a deck aid
8725860	8727860	A deck aid
8729860	8732340	So this is what happens dies. This is his wee body
8732740	8738820	He's no longer missing because we found him
8742820	8745140	You haven't finished a single run in this game that's different
8747060	8752820	I was five seconds from getting this ending now it's ruined. Yeah. Well, you know what else is ruined open your mouth
8752820	8754500	I'm gonna fart in it
8754500	8756500	Now your taste buds are ruined
8756660	8758660	I
8758980	8762740	Can't believe strong we just spoiled the game like that a game that's been out for a decade
8763620	8771140	Yes, um, I am going to absolutely go ham reviewing this game. I'm reviewing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I'm a reviewing Isaac
8771140	8774500	I'm actually doing call to the lamb which is probably my newest 10 out of 10
8775300	8777300	um
8777700	8780020	Out of respect for the development team
8780100	8784100	I'm not allowed to review Elden Ring because I don't play it the way it's intended
8784500	8791700	But if I could I would I would say it's a 10 out of 10 if they implemented multiplayer the way people would like it
8792500	8798500	What will she ruin next first mix? So now Isaac. Oh, I can't believe it
8799780	8803460	Out of respect for the dev team, bro. I do not play I uh
8803860	8805140	Elden Ring
8805140	8808660	In any way shape or form of what the dev team announced that
