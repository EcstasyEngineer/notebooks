{"text": " Okay. Focus on your life so you can let your dreams come back to you. No, I don't want to play any more. Go back real. Save your dreams. It took 1,000 years to perfect the battle machine. But it's only a second to pull the trigger. Good morning. Last morning, you got the Atlantic Sea? You don't watch the sea? You don't watch the sea? Yeah. Well... Sorry, game's still out, game's still out. Return back to the... To what? To speak? Oh my god. Make phones in my arms. Okay. Well good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. Have fantastic news. I slept. Oh my god. I slept. The fucking Christmas party. Uh... I also... Also give him an animal. Give him an animal. Oh. So now I no longer have the belly of someone that has 5 days old. Uh... Shit. Basically... Can we finish the Yumi camp? Sorry, this was a disgusting thing I could probably ever see. And it's first thing in the morning. Um... Basically started after the Yumi... Um... Oh yeah. Oh no, this can't be. Put me on easy. Come on. Current levels. Suffer the silence. I can't pick anything else. Oh no. Oh no, this can't be. Creatin' you? Oh no. We can only pick make warrior. We have to do normal difficulty. We can't just do camp. Right, anyway. Very quickly summarized what happened. After the fantastic Yumi plus collab, which was an absolute hoot and holler, turns out we all love each other. Um... I basically passed out for six hours. And then I woke up and I was like... Ugh, my stomach, my stomach. Ugh, I can't do this anymore. So I give him an innermot and I did that. And I ended up... I ended up passing out again after that. And I woke up with five minutes to go. So all in all, I ended up sleeping 12 hours. I woke up with a massive headache. That's not gonna stop me. I'm taking painkillers. Turns out I am... I freaking... But I accidentally hydrate via my fucking ass. Because it didn't come out at first. And I was like, excuse me? Water? Where did you go? Hmm... Um, so that was actually taking room. No. Uh... The good news is... We're playing... It's technically a childhood game, but I was actually too weak to play this at any point. So I know of, you know, all the mech types and all of that. Because I watched my dad play this game, basically. So I don't even know if we're gonna successfully get through it, but it doesn't matter. Because we're gonna try our best. I do have a ASMR membership stream planned. As well, at the end of this. Now, if we do get hard stuff, uh... My plan is to throw mech assault out the window, and then I'll just do my membership. Eh... Take time for your health. Literally, I kid you not, I should have played this when my... When my dad gets here. Because he could unironically... He plays... Uh, you know what? I'll remember the map when we get on it. The last map, as Atlas, he absolutely adores and the other one, he absolutely adores. There's one where you can, like, level all the buildings. And... So, my dad... He's a wee bit, like, mean, he's a wee bit autistic, but he doesn't realize it. And he used to play the same map over and over again, and did the exact same thing. Same thing, over and over again. It's rather adorable. Can you change the difficulty if you're creating your profile? No. It's just, like... Oh my god, axes! Viva la France! Eh... Yeah, it doesn't want to do anything. Just stay back facing them. I mean, I guess... Yeah. Whoa! Okay, I guess I just... Oh wait, current levels suffer this silence. It's not much of a sufferage. I'm guessing this is, like, corporal ranks, because in this mecha game you are... Um... You'll never guess what. You're piloting a mecha! Ah! Ah! What are the odds? Um... But yes, sorry, I'm just waking up a wee bit. Oh, aces! Snowberries! No, I'm piloting a mecha! Mech asshole! Oh my god! This is both their fault. Shut up, Isla. I'll jump in it right now. Hi! Snowberries! Guten Morgan! I'm currently slurping on my little teeth. And then we're going to jump into this game called Mech Assault. It is an Xbox original! Not even Xbox... Not even Xbox 360! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This was an Xbox No... Wait! Wait a minute! This is the early... The first mission! Ooh! It has a lady pie! Hi, AC! I think she's going to be resting. And then hi, Snowberries! We're playing Mech Assault, we're about to go speak to the lady! Now, you might notice my title is the most bizarre thing you've ever fucking read out of context. We took part from the heavy Mechs to fix the Cougar Scout Mech! Um, well, yeah! Wait, what time? I'm going to drink my tea. Hey, sport, you ready? I've got our orders. The invasion still steps off as planned. We're not paying us to be late. But the best part is that we get to go in first. Just like old times. The Intel boys say the enemy is powering up a set of nasty, ground-to-orbit guns. If those are online when the rest of the dragoons arrive, everyone dies. And we blow our bonus. So our little team gets to make a covert landing outside the range of the existing guns, sneak across half a continent, and take them out before our dropships show up. I think it's Loki, we play first. I think it's Loki, we play first. Me? Wait, is that Logan? That makes me call Logan. Wait. Wait, so that's the intro. So then, eating dirt is the first mission. All systems normal. We're in the pipe. Touchdown in two minutes. Oh my god. It's like a pixel on my screen. We've been scammed. Weapon fire inbound. Lieutenant Foster, how did they detect us? Alpha, Bravo landers. Prepare to hot-drop. I want you out of this grave now. Brace yourselves, boys. We're going in. Is this the first mission? Or am I picked the wrong one? Wait, these are... Wait. Why does it say select mission, and I keep getting fucking... The operation is off to a bad start, but the Icarus is not granted. Our job will be much harder. Why do I keep getting cutscene? Okay, this is the first mission. Here's a quick status report. Alright, it's Cougar Scout Mac. I knew it was Cougar. I knew it was Cougar Scout Mac, because of this voiceline coming up. Oh. Oh, my God. Holy... Holy moly. Holy moly. Oh, my God. Oh, my PC's ready to catch fire because it's kind of... weird thing. Okay. So, there's a hidden multiplayer... So, this game used to be multiplayer, and there's a hidden function in it. Oh, yeah, be safe. There's three baddies. Oh, my God, my PC's ready to catch fire. If I randomly go offline, you know exactly what. Right. Oh. Are they so brave? Why are you coming up against them, then? Look at the size of me. Oh, my goodness. Right. So, the thing about NCT 2 is you can just walk on it. Oh. Oh. I don't know if you can hear that. They're going up. Oh. Right. Next. Why... Why changes? Okay. Okay. Next. Is that a ship? I think he's glitched out. Oh, right. It controls the ammo type by X, Y, and Bravo. A trained mech of work. Destroy it. Weapons. Use your left trigger to cycle through the weapons, or just... It's official. They know we're here and they will be coming for us. Coming back for more? Oh, my God. Be sure to secure any sound that you find. The game audio is so loud. Ah. Right. So, we want music down and we want sound down, so you guys can actually hear the in-game ending. How's this? I don't know why my mic is acting all quiet all of a sudden. It's normally like, I'm so freaking loud into it. I'm feeding it through the thing. How's that? Kind of. How's that louder? Well... I see a max gain right now. Filters. Gains. Okay, this is up by 14 decibels now. Testing. Test tickles. Testing the tickles. Repeat, testing the tickles. Oh, see, these are health pads. See that green box? That's for health. Maybe we were destined for the longest collab. Okay, it sounds much better. Much better. Test. I can't remember what blues for my ultimate. No. So, if you lose health, you can pick up one there. And then, I guess, that must be for this. Again. Oh, the blue must give infinite. Oh, almost. A new... Attackable one. Yeah, you literally step on them. God, this game is actually kind of brutal for its time. When you... Yep. Fucking supply convoy. Oh, my God, my aimbot. They never told me this game didn't come with aimbot, okay? I'm trying not to get hit by it because it's in the necklace. I'm spraying. Oh, that's the supply convoy already? Holy crap. Oh, my God. I can't beat him. I'm getting rules. I'm getting rules. Wait. Why was my dad so much better at this game? No, this can't be. Fuck the rules. Okay, there we go. There we go. Like, I was like, way ahead of me. Hold on. No, there's more. Hold on, there's enemies. Oh, no, I'm like half health already because I'm getting too ahead of myself. Wait, there is aimbot on this one. Okay, I'm staying on this one then. Like, aimuses. The AI in this game is brutal. Let me heal up. Don't make me a bad mech warrior. Come on. Come on, let me heal up. There was the turret. Come forward. Bro, I'm trying evasive maneuvers. They're actually not working. I'm not being funny. I can't evasive maneuver and aim at the same time. Can you not destroy these? You must. Okay, I was going to say you must. Bro, forget. They're leveling me. This is the tutorial. My mech is sparking. It's actually ogre. It's so ogre when I started. My mech is sparking. Yeah. No. My audio is on. I don't know what the fuck the among us collab did. I don't know why I'm so quiet. I can't fly. I'm literally sparking. Bro, we're already doing the fucking ace of marching before I knew it. Whoa. You? Okay. Well, something just shot. I was going to say something just shot. Wait, hold on. I want to use my summer heal. Thank you, jeez. I've got more rocket. Oh, it's just swapped me a rock. Oh, and you pick up the ammo tape. It swaps you. Fuck. Stop it. Oh my god, I'm actually going to lose. I'm actually going to fucking lose. Um, this is the tutorial. I'm not even kidding. Why are freaking video games so brutal? They did not care about anyone's feelings. Honestly, they were like, no, you either win or you lose. Fuck you. You have to use this thing again. Like, where's most of these fucking things? Sending a scout unit and a frontal attack. Absolutely genius. And Diego. Thank you for coming to member. I'm to level this city. I hear a chopper. Why do I hear a chopper? Oh, it's you. Oh, this is mean. People are just trying to either. Can you aim for that? Whoa. Who do you think you are? Okay, we're going for the health here. Fuck. I knew there was a man. No, these are... I think these are looking. Oh, no. Oh, no. Give me the fucking health right now. Where is it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do this to me. I'm actually going to lose this tutorial. Don't do this to me. Hold on. Oh, my God, yes. Oh, my God. There's auto lock on this fucking gun type. Oh, my God, please. Oh, my God, I'm scared. No, fuck it. If you fly, I'm flying. Fuck you. How many rockets? I've got two more rockets. Oh, we got one. We got one. Hold on. You're next. Okay, we're out. Are we? Wait. We have infinite aim bomb. We have infinite things and I wasn't using it the entire time. We have infinite aim bomb. Missiles. And I haven't been using them. Right, I need one. Oh, my God. Sorry, that guy was literally trying to do a freaking development job. What do I need to destroy? Head cores. Man, fuck head cores. I think there's a hidden item in one of these buildings, maybe? I'm starting to be in blame to the UI. Literally, I suck. You have infinite ammo for all weapons. Wait, we're just using this one, then. Fuck up this building. Shut up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Jesus. You've actually got some decent HP. I'll give you that, Mr. Buildings. There's something shooting at me. Bruh. Am I not... Who the fuck is... I love the love of what... Ah! Ah! Oh. Just... Ah! Wait, and just like that. Ah, right. So we did that one. Never doing last transmission. Lieutenant, can you get that back? I can't, Major. There's nothing to get back. I see. Any sign of the rest of Alpha Lance? No, sir. Captain, get back to the Icarus. For now, it's just you and that scout mech, but this operation continues. Like I said, Dragoons improvise. Right, so we're getting our... Oh, sorry, you can see that we missed it. It's okay, suffering silence. Military Defender's ability to repel the impending invasion by raising their... Home Center. Again. And again. The loudness difference in this game is crazy. Uh-huh. Right. Simple. Right, so we've unlocked the Puma, but I don't know if it has rockets like the other one. Right, we'll try with the Puma. And if we... Puma pants, because I do so badly with it. We'll pick another one, thank you. Sorry, I took way too long on to hit the brim there. I took way too long to do that when I came in that joke, so I literally just went shite myself and then that was the joke. Right, okay. They do seem to have some auto-lock type turret. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. But I do like this game because you can like walk into stuff and destroy it. Like... Excuse you! I'm just trying to enjoy the spawn area. That's what I'm saying. These older games are brutal. Like, there's no such thing as like spawn area safety or nothing. I really strongly... Oh. That one just killed his own guy there. Oh, there's a brook floor. Oh my god, he like fires fast. Okay, so here's a thing that a lot of people didn't know about. You might notice that I've got a heat bar on the left. If you stand in water, your mech cools down. And a lot of people didn't know this in the multiplayer. So my dad used to wreck and deck in the multiplayer like far beyond anyone's... like, isn't knowing you how he was winning. And so this was back when Xbox headsets, like, were things who could communicate with the enemy team all points in the game. There were some such things like rounds where you can smack top. No, the entire game someone was blasting music down the mic. Someone was like spamming the N word all of that stuff. And my dad used to wreck and deck on these bit in multiplayer. And everyone used to be so raging at him. They're like, hey, he's cheating. How is he doing that? And it was because he was sitting in the water on Alice, which is like there's really damage in mech. Oh. It's like this really damaging a mech, but his cooldown is like pretty aggressive. Oh, god, I'm gonna shut up. All right, there. I know, those are people. I don't really need people right now. Where the heck did they go? Were they in the air? I'm in the air. Fuck you. All right, there we go. So basically, my dad used to wreck and deck on multiplayer. And the reason why I obviously like, oh, my mom was the first E girl. I'd say that is a joke, by the way. Because my mom used to go and headset and just like have a talk with anyone. Like just like, a lot of folks that like played mech, had Xbox Originals at the time. You were a working person. You had to have internet. You had to have the actual console, which is quite rare in itself. Then you would have to have a game. So it was a mature fan base that opted for this game. And my mom used to go and headset pretending like she, so my dad used to play the game in fucking silence. And my mom used to like be like, oh, I just got here. And my dad would be like, every morning I'd wake up to like a billion pals requests on Xbox. And it makes me laugh my ass off every time they tell me the story. I'm like, my mom was the first fucking girl being like, oh, I just got you. Like all of that down the make and like fucking laugh. It's such a shame. My mom and dad made pals with this guy from Canada. But it's a shame because like obviously they never got like any contact details of Xbox. So they never spoke. But basically he used to get high every day and he didn't have a job. And my mom and dad love talking to him because they were like, what do you mean you don't have a job? And there's like, oh, no, I don't need to pay taxes and he would like tell them about Canada. So Grizzly, if you're out there, my mom and dad absolutely adore you still and they still talk to you to this day. They still remember your game or tag Grizzly. So hopefully you're still getting high as hell and telling funny stories to people in video games. Doing Canada proud literally. So if you ever think like, oh, I don't have an impact anywhere on anyone. Literally, there's a Scottish man and wife that still to this day talk about their old gamer buddy from 20 years gone by. It must be. I don't know how old this game is when they were, wait, can I not? I doubt you're flying. Coming in boys. So yeah, don't ever be like, oh, my life doesn't have any impact. Like there's a nostalgic man and woman in Scotland that still think about you. So, oh shit, I'm overheating. I can't fire. Hold on, let's get this tank first because they're the humans. Yeah, when you overheat you literally can do no damage, which is a bit unfortunate. Wait, what did I join into? What's the context? I'm just saying that even if your life doesn't feel like it's impactful or anything like that, my parents used to play meccosal with this random guy from Canada. They don't have this contact information or anything, but his gamer tag was grizzly and I'm just saying even if you feel like your life has no positive impact, there is a sweet Scottish couple to this day that still talk about this guy that got high and played meccosal every single day from Canada and it doesn't, like your life doesn't have to amount to anything at all. That's not how it works. And it's just very I think it's just Oh, there's a mecc. Yep. Oh, I'm seeing a battle mecc. I don't know about reading a mecc. I just saw him. I see him. He's coming at me like a freaking spoon. Oh. Whoa, hold on. Hold on. Is he crippled? So mecc animations are actually pretty decent. You can get crippled mecc animations. Oh, fuck. I'm overheating and there's no water nearby. Oh, there's no water nearby. I'm out. I'm overheating. Hold on. Let me hide behind this building. Hold on. Hold on, darling. Let me hide behind this building. Okay. Okay, darling. Thank you. Right. I've got a, I can shoot again. Okay. He's crippled. See how he's sparking? That's when you know that mecc is getting weak. Yeah. He's literally on fire. But you ready for this sound when it dies? I'll shut up when it dies. Oh, come on. Whoa. I'm one health. I'm one health in a dream. I'm one health in a dream. I'm one health in a dream. I wasn't paying attention. Oh, my god. Holy. There. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I wasn't paying attention because I was typically yattin'. Make Grizzly only the most famous YouTuber. Wait, YouTuber, shut up. Imagine if it was him and he's a YouTuber now and I'd be like, hi, by the way, I'm the daughter of your old best pal that you used to talk to daily on Xbox. What the fuck up? Could you imagine? Is there actually someone called Grizzly on YouTube that please make games to shut the fuck up? Imagine. And he's the Canadian and he gets high all the time. So I've got some news from my dad. Oh, my god. Stony keeping the jet pack that makes it overheat. Wait, this meat. Oh, right. It does add to your overheat. Okay. Oh, no. Whoa. Wait, are you the real Stony? Oh, thank you. Are you kidding me? I'm scared to go in. Oh, it's you again. Oh, no, it's not. Oh, my god. They're like sniping me from halfway across from that. And they have all wing. Yeah Oh I think I'm supposed to have to fight in here because look how many healing stations there are That's probably also one of the important things is to be able to fall back. Oh my god. We're just trying to hospital a Geneva convention Oh Sometimes I wonder if I ever own some famous folks during my year strongy, please. What do you mean by spoon? What calling on my spoon? It's just an insult like you can insult things I really want to use my special ammo Oh And in scots you can make inanimate objects and insult Ramblin on about yeah in scots you can make anything an insult an inanimate object an insult. Oh Oh, we're done. Okay. Maybe there is a chance. We've finished the campaign Resistance group actively fighting the word of Blake. We've not heard from Alpha Lance so we can use these guys help We've seen it foster play the transmission. It's pretty rough sir seems to be repeating at short intervals I'll let you know when I get a better read Hey Did we like I feel like cougar had more Recon and light and rays from our variation of the cougar is built around the PPC See, that's only a fucking hit that it makes friends, we'll try we'll try The Cougar Paul, I know I'm kind of at bias Yeah, it's an infinite input should be doable.

Oh Oh Okay, that's honestly when she said that sorry we're doing strats The music in this game is really good if I could put it off, but I don't know the volume What's the word?

That's I just pretty satisfying when it's one shot. It feels like this is a shotgun in terms of late Oh Wow, I'm just destroying the entire river Sometimes Whoa, sorry the controls are a bit funny. Please remember this game is back when Whoa, what was that? Oh, thank God back in the day when they were like made things invisible they weren't actually invisible so they were like being nice to you I Remember playing a similar mech assault game, but on the Xbox you're gonna shit yourself when you find out this next piece of information This is mech assault from the Xbox original Very good game My it's probably one of the first games I was a child Just when it comes to Stuff Can you play that?

I need to tell sorry I do Here we go here we go here we go Oh That's what I missed. Okay. Okay. Oh That makes much more sense. I was like, where the heck are they going? Disappearing on me like that. I love the air I remember when you need to kill three war generals in Five minutes in a feature Infidel brethren watch and learn You Here's our situation We're landing in what we hope is a secure location, but it looks like the enemy may have spotted us There's several enemy units in the area and Towards our position as soon as we learn you'll need to secure the landing zone More interesting. It looks like the word is transporting a new mad cat We need more firepower. So I want that heavy mech It's against my better judgment, but once you capture the mad cat lieutenant Foster will pilot it back to the Icarus Try and make sure that breathing boy doesn't kill himself Right, I'm I'm sorry, but Ooziel is kind of getting me good. I have to admit that double and That double Will be on the ground momentarily That double Destroying mech so quickly. I'm very biased Double PPC. Hmm.

That was a this is a good make Okay, we've got the word of Blake's attention. So now we hurt them One of their key tactical command centers is a nick of everything. We're ever gonna have a chance to get those global guns We've got to take it out. We can't hit them head-on. So we're gonna turn out the lights I like is so large. It has to try to attack We're gonna blow that plant and I take ten beech ever make a soul and I don't think anything came up of the original And I'm like, oh, am I making reach of her history the only mech?

Right, hold on I'll write that down somewhere Thanks Yeah, literally bro, as I said these games do not follow the etiquette when it's in the tree to fall in You're supposed to like be given like five seconds. Whoa You're supposed to be given some abbreviation to the enemies like shooting at yeah, this game does not give life to the rats Oh, wow, it splits up the aim as well. So, okay, that's really good if it splits up the aim It's technically like less to do Right mad cats can't fly must remember mad cats cannot fly because I'm gonna get confused when I'm in the middle of my fight And I'm like get up get up get up And nothing's happening Okay, there we go There seems to be two enemies over here One Yeah, I can kind of see why they had to put AI.

Sorry. Let me take off reactive model. There we go I'm currently getting flashbang right now. I'll be right back. I'll make a click of tea very quickly Please get all a wee snackie poo or anything of that nature. Okay? You You You Are you squiddin me right now You You You You You You You You I may or may not have put cat food in my tea Oh Here's the score the Icarus sitting duck we need to set up another base so we can finish the job and take out those orbital Towers the enemy and I just made my tea there, and I'm like I can read from our own sense So I'm about to figure out Thor on the rocks are we already on Ragnarok are we getting close? Sorry, did someone say oh, thank you. Don't stay down for the Super chat Bro, I just the Oreo just all in my bed extra protein. I mean Uh, cat food isn't fit for human consumption, which I don't like I'd rather Oh How many missions Thor on the rocks are being in close? I'm getting nervous Timberwolf, who are you a variant of the successful mat the timber wolf has suited for any battlefield role I don't I don't use the pew-pews, but I use the shoulder thing below. Is this eight shoulder things? They're faster though Timberwolf right fuck it. We'll give Timberwolf a go. Yeah Timberwolf. Let's go Make sure wonder what they put in the cat food. Yeah I'll fucking out just fondant Forgot how it play like in five seconds. Um, oh it comes to snow Uh Yeah, do you if you want to hear how dumb I was as a child are they gonna come from the top? Oh, yeah, they are Oh, no, they only have super um They are um So this is probably the most disgusting story you're gonna hear all day Um, I used to eat cat food when I was like four years old because I was convinced it would turn me into a cat um So I could have a very vivid memory of uh under the kitchen sinkers where the cat food who was uh like in her house And I used to take a spoon fill out of the tin and eat it because I thought it was gonna turn me into a cat And yeah, it's not my brightest moment Uh I don't know why in my head it was gonna turn me into a cat. It just was like, yeah, that makes perfect sense if I eat this cat food So I I know what cat food tastes like Uh, I could tell by the smell if a cat's gonna enjoy it or not because of this dumb thing I did as a freaking child Um, but it's like I can laugh at it now, but oh my god Yeah My my shock and horror that I just wake up with cat ears I And it and that behavior went on for quite a while. I'm not even gonna lie. I think it was probably a solid month I would just wonder the cupboard a bit. Oh, I need a little snack And if my mom didn't give me a snack, I just wonder And the thing is all cat food labels like have a thing on it That's like not fit for human consumption because of like the guts that they usually like Oh And the worst thing is it's not like it was refrigerated like it was open Oh, hold on. Sorry Sorry video game. I'm telling this really disgusting story. The worst part was it wasn't refrigerated. It's like open canned a Like cat food How old were you at the time four? I was like four not 13. Stay on What if I told you you're not the first person to tell a story like this? Oh, thank god I Feel a bit better now then if that's the case Was it wet? Yeah, it was like the wet jelly in the can I still remember the noise the spoon made as I took it out of the can like that Um, it's absolutely mean. I know I'm so sorry. I don't have any excuse But that's hilarious that someone else told me I don't know. It just makes perfect sense. Like of course cat food people as if that just kamikaze into that I can't see this chopper. He's out of range. But he is there are there is You're next buddy Find and destroy the wobb sense or net Wait, so I need to go back again I get eaten kivel, but jeez. Yeah, like that's why So I'm a bit passionate. I'm like, no, I don't want uh I'd rather cat food said it's fit for human consumption. Not because I want to eat it And turn into a cat. But because I don't think that you should be giving your pet something that you the human aren't fit to consume um Lack of nutrients for humans, but it's generally safe in an emergency the furry arc. No, I'll pass AC's like in development AC was like as far as we'll go Right Um, because we did entertain the possibility But we decided it would be far too much of a I can see so much red, but it's not like giving me one thing to shoot at Um, but we decided it was far too much of a like negative thing. Holy crap. Something is like obliterating me You you're obliterating Right, I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. I guess we have to come back that way. Gee, there's like so many countries though I think there's one in the rocks, maybe Anyway long story short, I'm a special child. Is there one hiding? I'm so confused. It says there's something there There's an enemy back out there You can spam with a wildcat though. What is get you? Yep. I knew you were right there. I can see you on the hot Well, what are you? Okay, so this is the mad cat egg Whoa, something's getting me from behind as well. Holy shit. You pop off I hate when the game does that when these bombs aren't behind you because look how long it takes to freaking do a 180 I'm half out as well. I don't like that at all Oh my god, please perish. What's going on? Wow, don't do that again Holy moly, you almost got me. Something up here? Com tower? What's this then? Whoa Oh, it's cool. She's our special boomer on the floor When it was a child, I played with stuffed animals until they just have an even two in the school and they need honey And donate them all to cousin. That's what I'm holding. Oh, that's fucking sad as fuck though I remember my time. I got she got stolen at school I was raging because I knew exactly who did it and then the next year the freaking B-Och came back to school with it a year later And she's like, oh, I ran out of battery and I'm like, yeah, could you stole it off me and it's been a year you fucking bought Um How is the cat tea by the way? Okay before I forget but before the game starts like flashing us Hold on. I'm just gonna run in circles so the game doesn't like flash I don't know why stuffing makes it like panic Did I beat her up? I was like six years old. I did not beat her up. Um I basically I Knew she stole it. I told the teacher but the teacher like obviously didn't have the right to pat down a child or check through their bag um And basically the teacher was like, yes, Ronnie. Sorry, but you shouldn't have like you shouldn't bring Stuff into school that you can lose type idea. Hold on. I'm drinking my tea. I can't I don't I don't sense any cat Uh cat like um dusting In it If I read slime girl one more day, I see slime girl more than purple burglar alarm at this point Name air name air asking for slime girl. That's everyone's getting bent over anyone that types slime girl's getting bent over And I'm absolutely taking a bollican Because I've had enough I'm putting my foot down the scottish vtuber gets asked for a fucking slime girl more than bloody purple burglar alarm Which everyone's obsessed by asking scottish people about Don't tempt them honestly A slime boy remember that time I was entertaining a male branch and then it like completely dissolved overnight I have no interest now Oh Yeah, but what about you know, slime Can you see squirrel eye? It's the french that can you see squirrel they go squee well Who a little squee well Just kidding a squee well Someone needs to make a compilation of every time someone asks about slime girl, bro They'd be at it for months You'd get more content out of people asking me for a slime girl than I do burps in general Yeah, french people go squee well wait, how did you say it's girl? Why a squirrel oh like there goes a squirrel Sounds like a short side deal actually I need to make a short. What was it? Oh fine. I guess you add my wee pog champ. Yeah, it was like something like that I need to make that I also need to make a song cover. So honestly if this game if we Do the opposite of game journalists this game that actually might come in fantastic and I can get even more work done I I my goal is to get a 2k. Thank you audio out Am Though I'm going to do the ear cleaning one because it has a funny little joke at the start. I think that one's the best I'm sorry. I keeping this dream buried for now slowly stewing in fermentin Look if one of the girls say they want a halloween slime variation Fine, okay. It's a whole new model. It's a whole new artwork. It's a whole new design fine. They can have it But no one is asked for one Game journalists or game regroup just a short shawnee shaming us for ideas. No, I don't I'm not shaming but like there's some stuff that's like If you don't know you don't know and like one of the unwritten rules are You know like don't have a cyclops. It's offputting people don't like it as a design debuff and You know someone being green again design debuff unless you made them only a tinge of green and said they were a halfling But she's like a muscle mummy in comparison to the average human sure fine. Let it happen multiple eyes Insect these are kind of unwritten things that are against the the norms and I'm happy to talk about it But I get nervous when I talk about it people take it like oh, she said insect girls Bad that means she hates and it's like no motherfucker. That's not how design works. You have to appeal to the masses The masses and you need to give a model to someone that isn't a debuff That isn't something that makes it even harder for them to succeed as a feature creator hey Oh, the shadows are back in full force. I'm slamming the desk. That's when you know, I was hardly slamming it I gave it a little bump Yeah, yeah slam sly cops. You're done Someone's gonna be like a slam praying man to cyclops that's green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Give it a little bug pincers as well. Yeah, mommy doesn't hate a single thing. Have you checked her work? She seems to try everything We're looking to hit every demographic not a niche. Yeah, I mean do we need a halfling when we have a cuttlefish that needs a steps I'm not that small. I'm sorry, but five two is not that small. I'm literally bang on average height for the women in the world. Am I not? Am I not as to if five point two not bang average on height Just a slain blob. That's it Every day you push me to form an insect slain cyclops feature agency You just call it like I don't know what you should call it just be like V success and then the the point is to prove that you can have a Successful beat of her as like this design. I think the average five four. Oh fuck me man V slimy. Okay, dude Freaks Incorporated V repel and they do the opposite repel I've almost finished my thing V cute short I'm starting to imagine that brain meme when you go to sleep saying that you have made a slime girl then Oh, imagine if that was the biggest turnaround of the century that there's already a slime girl design approved Hey, and I'm just pretending there isn't and I'm like, oh, I hate slime girls See it Can you tell me twice Wouldn't that not be the the ultimate debate I mean if I pulled that off I'm gonna make if I pulled that off I deserve like all the whole Right, there's a lot of supplies in these barracks, which makes me think I Little bit hold on I need to lure the thing that would be such a dirty move five two is the global average in China Oh my god, I can't believe you guys find out. I'm secretly Asian right now Uh, I wasn't kidding when I said I had a Chinese and a I I really like her voice. I wish she voiced more video games. Maybe she has and I just don't know about it.

It implied the gates were going to open. It bloated, didn't. Was that supposed to go out those gates? Anyone here put Mexico? Either pass the atlases or blow up the generator to open the other gate or go back and... If I go out the atlases thing, I assume they want to fight me. I just want to make sure I don't upset any little ground soldier unit. I think the door... Oh my god, you have to... Right. At least not over the generator's located, but... Did I even have the health to get out of there? Is my question... Okay. So... Okay. No alarm is raised. So begin... So go there and then I'm going to aim at the freaking generator and then I'm just gonna go for it because there's not much I can do. Okay. Right. Okay. And then the generator was around this corner. Okay. Okay. You don't need to tell me that there's enemies. I know there's enemies. Are you winning? We got rigged. We got really badly rigged. They fight you either way.

I'm freaking trying. I'm in position four, three, two, one. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm hiding behind this for now. Open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Please open. Are you fucking serious? Open! I'm going, but I'm so slow. What does this mean? I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Oh god. Please close the gates behind me. Please close the gates behind me. I beg of you. Be close the gate or something. I don't know. Ring the guards. Anything. Please. There's too many of them. I can't do it. Oh my god. This is getting worse. There's an enemy ahead. Oh, but there's health on the road. Okay. Okay. The guards have been rang. The guards have been rang. Fight. Fucking gone. You didn't have to tell me twice, darling. I'm fucking gone. I'm with the wind. I'm with the sky. I hate these kind of omissions. Oh god. Right. We're getting farther. We're getting farther. That's the main thing. Okay. Across the bridge. Across the bridge. Surely, I have to get across the bridge. There's only one way through. The only way out is through a heavily breamed port to be ravine. Follow this in an actual application point. Down there. Oh, shy saw. I'm one HP in a dream. How is I supposed to win this? I'm going to have to look up a tutorial. Whoa. I'm dead. Whoa. Is that supposed to go down the river? I think I'm going down the river. Wait. All I have to do, I don't actually have to do anything. I just have to reach the extraction point. Hmm. Curious. Curious. The trucks dropped the hill. You've made good progress. That was a good attempt. I think I'm to go bottom right at that river. Oh, the trucks dropped health. The trucks. Okay, trucks. Look for a truck. I think that path was right. There was a natural cover around the bend. Okay. Just around the river bend. Strony, maybe time to ask your dad what he did. Honestly, I don't remember him playing this mission a lot, so I don't think he enjoyed it. Which I'm not even trying to agree with his taste in mission because WTF, mate. We need mission control. Papacult is mission control. Right, let's go. That took so long for the gate to open. I'm going to hide behind the generator this time, so I don't take any damage at all. Counter started. I'm going to go behind the generator this time. There is a health pack right there. Can I shoot? I'm wondering if I should take that off on the way out. Okay, right side, there's a health pack when I leave. Oh, this truck has health. ID code. What do you mean comply? Get ready to move out. Okay, green trucks have health in it. Who do you think, huh? Okay. Three, two, one, go. I'm fucking trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Fucking hell, this is generator. Have someone come see. Oh, come on. Break already. Oh, is it broken? Okay, okay. So what, do you give me health? You're a lie. Okay, okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine that there's two atlases locked onto me. It's not a problem at all, as if that building could support the weight of my mech. Sorry, my mech is far too heavy for it. Oh, no, it just takes so much damage because I walked into that structure. Oh, my God, there's three heal stations. Wait, do you have health? Or is it the other ones that have health? Who the fuck is sniping me from the sky? I can't get a break, bro. I don't think I can actually do this. You, you, give me the health. Give me the health. You don't understand. You don't understand. You are mine. You are mine. Give me the health right now. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Great. Okay, health on the bridge. The only way, oh, I got stuck on that turret again. Oh, God, I'm like one health already. I'm half health already. Please stop shitting me. Oh, there's a green truck ahead. Get the truck. Get the truck. Beat it up. Give me that truck. Give me that HP right now. Give me that health. Fuck you. Beach. Fuck you, beach. Fuck you. Just think I won't do it. God, that thing has some health on it. Wait, I'm supposed to go down. Wait, I'm confused. No, up. Go up. Go up. Wait, give me a truck. Give me a truck. I'm half health. Give me a truck. Come on. Come on. Let me get a range. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm so good at this health. There's health. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. Shit. Shit's a base. Shit's a bomb car. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, there's another one. Oh, we're going to make it. We're going to make it. I have hope. I have hope. Fricking shoot it, though. Oh, wait, sorry. I'm flying. Wait, that's why I can't shoot it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm panicking. Panicking. Right. You. Fuck off. Oh, God, there's a new makeup ahead. No, you're not supposed to do that. Stop. Stop. You're making me so stressed. Oh, I see health. I see health. I see. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I'm doing great. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not panicking at all. I'm not panicking at all. It's fine. It's fine. No, I'm MLG at this game. It's fine. Oh, God, the HUD is breaking. The HUD is breaking. Why? There's so much. Okay, I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see green. I see lots of green. I actually quite like seeing this much green. I have to admit, this is pretty cool. Yes, you better have a plan to get me out. Okay, okay. Destroy the bridge when I'm on the other side. Oh, that's a freaking atlas. It's an atlas. It's an atlas. But break the bridge. Break the bridge. Break the bridge. I'm on the other side of the bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. The bridge. Destroy the bridge. The motherfucking bridge. Oh, you suck so bad. Why do you suck so bad? Oh, no. Oh, no, it's all coming. Oh, why are you not destroying? No, don't lock onto the atlas. Fuck it. No, not like this. Not like this. Oh, no, I have to destroy the bridge to progress. Why? Why would you do this to me video game? Why? The bridge was hardly breaking. I was so close to dying. I was so close. No, I can't 1v1 a fucking atlas. No, why does the bridge die? Why does the ace have so much damage? Why does the bridge have so much HP? Because the rocket did very little damage? Yeah, well, your mom. I did it. I won the game. I won that fucking mission. You suck. You stinky game. You know I blew up that bridge. Freakin' have to use something else. This make only fires two at a time. So much for having make superiority with this one. It sucks. Stony, your spam flying is slowing you down a lot and overheating you. Oh, but I feel like if I fly, they don't hit me as much. Shoot the bridge as you walk across it because it has so much. Okay, I agree with this sentence. I approve of this message. Oh, excuse me. Sorry, you didn't see that. I promise I'm trained in this make and I haven't just put it on for the first, I haven't been inside it for the first time. Great. I will use X in zero. Oh, let me reset. I freaking bumped a building. I'm in a massive make. Fucking give me a chance. How did I get even worse? Literally, I kicked it. If you hit every health pick up along the way and just run serpentine, it'll be enough to get you there. Okay, okay, okay. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We want. Yeah, missiles have the least damage against these. The laser works better. Great. I can do it. I have faith. If there's any doubters, then doubters will be recommended to go watch V-Slammy V-Tubers instead of Viller Beach. Oh, that's so stressful. Right, stop flying. It slows me down. Okay, I can do this and I can not hit a building on the way there. All I have to do is not spank a building and then I just need to run. I'm sure someone's probably done this where he has killed everything before. I'd actually be very curious to see if someone's got gameplay of that. Okay. Stop AI locking onto me. You smell. I know what you're doing. I know what you are. Oh, hold on. Okay. Right, we're hacking into the comms unit. Slime arachnid V-Tuber with only one eye and a green skin, surely. Would we be able to do this mission on the first try? I said mods. Take that man out for 10 seconds. How dare he speak like that to me. How dare. Okay, we can do this. There's a little green truck here. If I really need it, then there's also a green one. I'm so terrified about it. You have got this, I believe in you. This is it. This is the run. This is the run because I'm using my X now. Okay, that was so much quicker. Right, don't use your fly. Stop panicking. Stop flying. Use it. Okay, I can do that. I can do that. Right, hold on. We'll get some coverage going through here. Pardon me, coming through. Okay, and then there's a health station to the left as I come out here. Oh my gosh, did I just mess up again? Oh, I think so. Oh, I'm running. Why did they have to make such a stressful mission? You! Give me, oh wait, there's one here too. Right, and then you're next. You're next. I'm fate. What fate? I'm fucking getting annihilated. There is no fate. There's only death and stinkiness. Is there even a health station? There isn't. Oh, you're the health pack. Okay, I found you. Right, I can shoot the bridge as I go along it because, no, not this one, the next bridge. Sorry. Next bridge, next bridge. Oh, something just splattered me for heavy. I don't know what it was, but it got me good. Okay, okay. Oh, ow, ow, that actually took a decent considerable chunk of damage. Ow, please stop, please stop. Please, I'm such a good feature, I'm such a good feature bird. Please, please, God, stop taking tick damage. It's all I ask, please. Stop it. I don't even know what the pylons do when they spot you. Oh god, there's one there. Wait, well, why did all the other freaking mechas time out? Okay, one's on, one's hot on my R-Streets. I don't even know if I can pick this up. You can't even beat over Healed Canyon in those games. No, you can't. I'm full health. Okay, take it as a blessing. I'm full health. I'm full health. Take it as a blessing. Oh yeah, I'm full health. I'm full health. I don't fucking care. Go away. I don't know what the wee towers do, but I'm going for it. I'm going for it. I'm trying my best. I'm a good little mate, and I am doing great. Thank you. Okay, where the fuck do I go? Hello? Should I fuck up? I'll weave it. I'll weave it. It's okay. Back on course, back on course, back on course. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up. Okay, I see it. I see the hell. Ah, no game. Don't break now. I'm almost there. Don't do that to me. Don't be so selfish. Okay. Okay. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm breaking free. I'm solving. I'm trying. There's not a bridge. There's gaining. Freaking. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Pop already. Come on. Come on. Yes. Fucking shove up your ass. Atlas. Fucking bam. Can you get this one too? I don't know if I need to do this one too, but I think I'm okay. Okay. Okay. Oh my god, we did it. We just need to destroy this one, which I can do. Oh my god, we did it. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. Oh, we did it. Oh. Wait a second. Holy crap. Sirs, I know what the word of Blake is doing on this planet. They found some sort of lost technology cache and something called Ragnarok. No. I'm going to signal the other dragoons. Ragnarok is even scarier than Atlas. Oh, no. We know where the guns are. Now we need to stop them before the invasions of the dragons are on. Wait, isn't the dragon the name of Dokey Bird? Oh, she got a new outfit. And a familiar model. Work your way towards the orbital gun any way you can and then destroy the gun. Oh, it's letting me pick. I'm going to say I didn't actually enjoy Thor that much, but Timberwolf. Timberwolf has so much spray and pray though with those things. I'll try with Timber, if not, I'll take on the other one. You don't remember the Ragnarok? Okay, so think of Thor and then change everything by two. I like how they cut coms on him. Right. Again, we might lose it. Sir, you're going to face stiff defense. You may be able to skirt around the worst of it with a maneuverable mech. I don't care what you do, Captain. Get those guns. We have a tamer. If they eat the worst, well, well, well, if there's in the worst kind of game, well, they can give you a fricking tamed mission. Right. I can't fly. Maybe I should. Shit. Nothing's open. Huh? I can't fly. Wait. I softlocked myself because I have something that can't fly. Stop. Wait, can I destroy these walls? Can I open this door for Mimi? I'd appreciate that. I think I, unironically, think I need to start with the new mech. Right. Okay, hold on. Quit mission. Yeah. And then, okay, it was under the guns. We know where the guns are. Right. That's fine. And then give me mad cat, I guess. Mad cat. Well, Thor can fly as well. Sir, the new tool we're receiving is the heavy firepower. Straight through with one of our big gun mechs or take a jump capable mech and skirt around the edge of the base. Your call. Time is of the essence. The other dragoons are counting on you. I'll try mad cat. See behind. Wait, mad cat can't fly. Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. Let's try that again. Mad cat can't fly. Thor can fly. We will pick Thor. Dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb. We know where the guns are. One more time for the, one more time from the top. Thor can fly. So we can fly over. Wow. You didn't think it was that hard. Don't forget, lasers are the structure busters. You can break the door. I didn't know that. Right. Hold on. We're using the laser beam. I'm a fire on the laser. Right. I'm going to all lock onto the retanks because it's just so much easier all alone. Whoa. This hardly does any damage on the all alone. Man, I want a mad cat so bad. They do so much damage like all alone. I mean, I like not having to try sometimes. Is that, is that so hard? Yes, you're a dumb, dumb, but you're a dumb, dumb, affectionately, affectionately, affectionately, though. Okay. So there's a health pack. I know a mad cat comes in. There's actually two health packs. That's a lot of resistance. Wow. Oh, here. I mean, this is, this is all locking on him pretty quickly. I have to say, I have to say, it's not, oh, that was some juicy damage he just did there. I don't know what my ultimate is, but I'll use it anyway. Wait, he's even sparking yet. I feel like I've done, who the fuck is shooting that? Fuck off! Honestly, doing my fucking hits in. Hold on, let me please redeem his ass. Oh, sugar. I'm out of, um, oh, he's limping? Is he limping? I think we're doing it. I think we're doing it. Okay. God, this is taking far too long. I think I'm wasting so much time doing this. Like, game-wise, I should not be doing, oh my God, he's literally about to get, about to get each other. We're actually having like a decent break, yeah. And there's an enemy behind me. What the heck? What am I supposed to do? Oh, I'm supposed to go north? Oh, fuck off. Right, you, fuck you. I don't, uh, I don't know if I should send it or not, but given you a timed mission, surely the game devs wouldn't be so evil to give you a timed mission and then give you a billion mechs in front of you for the past, so you're perfectly run out of time and you have to redo the whole 15-minute mission again. Surely. Surely for an old ass, I don't even know when this game came out. I probably wasn't even born when I came out. No, I can't do it. Maybe. Because I never played it when I watched my dad run out of time. Can a mech be left alone to do their job exactly? Is this the right way? No, this is just a fiber. Me. How do I, do I fly? Oh, I can fly. Oh, it's fantastic. Uh, yeah, I think I've taken some kind of shortcut to the mountain. The good news. Uh, okay, okay, okay. I am a little bit sparky. Okay, okay. Okay, I know there's a mech down there. Hold on. Hold on, you're next, mate. Hold on. Oh, are you freaking serious? Uh, can't be arsed when the AI is like hiding. Oh, and I just took a direct hit off something. Lovely. Oh, I don't know if I should be fighting you or not. Oh no. Right, you're just backing off. I don't know why. Sorry, mate, it was not working. I think the laser's on when you put that down. Sorry. Please just take these direct hits, please. I'm begging, please so I can pick up your freaking health. I need it. I need it. I need it. Give me your health. Okay, we're just kind of, yeah, okay, we're just gonna do this, yeah? I'm trying. He's not perishing. Okay, there we go. Give me that health. Give me that health. Okay, I'll pick it. Yeah, and you guys are fucking next. We're slowly getting damaged in the middle of that fight. Uh, we're doing the wrong way. I'm supposed to be going this week. Can you take fall damage? I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Uh, literally, uh, the guy knew it was inevitable. Right, another mech, but I can see the cannon. Okay, there you are. Fuck me. That's not good. You guys are so cheap. Like, why do you guys get two, but I only get one? The boys? Captain, help me out, question mark. The mad cat is currently going around me to sandwich me. Can you see it on the hard bottom left? The mad cat is going around to freaking sandwich me. I'm not even kidding. Sorry, I think I'm gonna have to move into this health part. Yeah, the mad cat is getting me from behind. I'm not happy with that. I don't know. No, do not randomly swap fucking magazines for that. Oh, come on. Call the weak guy at least. Sir. Oh, I'm running out of time. Oh, I'm completely out of fucking. Oh. Oh, face of maneuvers. A face of maneuvers. That's so loud behind me. Please stop. Please stop. Hold on. I'm over the edge. Oh, but when I jump, right, blow them up. No, I didn't do any freaking environmental damage against them. I would very much like to win this mission in one go. I do not want to replay this mission. I'm going to be honest. I took, like, so much direct damage there. I'm so, the overheat is, like, punishing me so hard right now. And, of course, I never made it. I was a waste of time. Oh, right. Hold on. He's smoking. He's smoking. That's what you get for smoking. Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna have to jump this chicken wall to not get hit by this fight again. Hold on. Oh, I need to get over. There we go. Fuck you. Fuck you. I need to kill. Oh, I'm going to get direct hit off the spam. How much have I got? About eight minutes to destroy this and the next one. I don't like mods. Yeah, you better start limping. You have, you have, limping, limping, limping. Fucking destroy this. I've got seven minutes to find the last one. Oh, sorry. Right. Hold on. Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? This way? It says this way. Hold on. If I go up. Oh, there it is. Oh, my God. There it is. It's right there. Holy crap. We can do it. We can do it in one. We can do it in one. Now, let it spawn eight billion mints all at once for me to perish. Sorry, you're going down. You're actually going down. I don't care what you're shooting at me. You're going down first. Whoo. The orbital guns were our primary mission, but we got another one from upstairs. So they aren't our yet. The Icarus isn't fixed enough to get us off-planet, but it can move us around. Command wants us to figure out what this Ragnarok is and seize the lost technology while the rest of the vehicles are at the word of Blake here. So we're off to a hellish wasteland of lava and dust storms. Once more into the breach, A-Tiger. Once more. I'd rather be. We did it. Whoa, we did it. Oh, they give you like double the time. Okay. The new case of our mission. What's the name of this mission? Size Mars? Gambling, whatever floats your boat. Size Mars. We did it. I'm so glad. If you just need the last one, you can take your odds and bomb us. As you know, we are en route to the wasteland. We have received some intel that got me thinking, and I have a plan. Oh, great. First, we have an old two-power armor in hold. Captain, you are just the right size. That added to the fact that we've learned that a number of word of Blake dignitariers are having some sort of celebration during an invasion. Remember that time I actually did the plan. In this power armor, their sensors won't pick you up. The bad guys won't go on full alert. You will face defenders just not their whole force. Get through their base and find their mechs. Steal one, and then you'll be inside their defenses, giving them hell before they know it. Steal a mech. Move through the small city, demolish the regional palace, and crash their little party. What can I say? Brilliant. Steal a mech. Can I steal an alice? Elemental, a suit of powered... Oh, that makes me want to play cameo. Sorry. A suit of powered battle armor. An elemental is no match for mechs in single... Who goes out? Combat. Hmm. Hmm. My size matters. Let me defense should be minimal, though I recommend you stay away from combat. Whoa, I'm so cute. Oh my god. I'm so cool. Oh, look at me go. Oh, I'm so fast. Holy crap. Like, but I don't have much thrusters to me. Oh, I'm so cute. Oh, sorry. Wait, what are you... What even armor? Is something shooting me? There is. Whoa, I can hear it. What did I do? What sort of scraps do I... I hear. Whoa, I have so much lift. Scissors and enemy over here. Whoa. Okay, thank goodness fall damage in a mech suit isn't a thing, because... There's something red over here, so I assume that's where I'm supposed to go. Whoa. Whoa, who, who, who, who? Oh my god, so this is what it's like to be like a tiny big round unit. Okay, we got him. Who next? Wait, I didn't get him. It's so rich. Wow. Up here? Sorry, I don't really have much of a recollection of this at all. Oh. Am I going too fast for you? Too bad. Plop, plop, plop, plop. Oh, there's a wee baby one. That's what we're fainting. Okay, hold on, wait, wait, hold on, let me get into the fight. Geeze, is this Out of Bones? Is that why? I think this might be Out of Bones and he's like an invisible wall. Well, I got a lick off on someone. Oh crap, how'd I get around? Sir, I'm reading an incoming mech. Somewhere. It must be using no sig. Captain, you can't fight him. Get a move on. No, no, don't give me a run and map again. I get too stressed out when you give me run maps. Wait, what the heck am I supposed to...? Something's dying behind me. I'm so confused where I'm supposed to go. I'm so sorry, guys. This door? Okay, is this like maybe a generator to open a door? There's two mechs after me now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can hear it freaking charging up against me. You just relaxed me. What am I supposed to do? Sorry, I'm probably gonna die, but it's too too confusing rather than being bad. Well, I am bad, but I don't... Is there something back there? Was I supposed to kill a generator? Huh. There's three. Just run, but run where? Oh, shit. Oh, my, my gear is on for registering now. Oh, okay, it's registering again. Hold on. Am I just wee enough that they can't shoot me? Well, they can shoot me a wee bit, but where am I? Sorry, sorry. Let me just focus on the map detail, because they wouldn't put sections in the map if they weren't supposed to go near it, kind of. Right, so it is that gate, but how do I get over it? All right, I'm low health, that's all. You mean you're confused because of how good I am at the same exact... Is it... And before it just opens... Oh, for fuck's sake! Come on! As if that was the solution! I was joking! Oh, of course it was. I wasted so much health, no. I don't know if I'll make it run through. Yeah, they don't even drop health because we're so Chinese. Oh, well, oh well. Okay, we'll try again next run. At least we know the gate opens. Good job, sir. Had me sweating. You were sweating, briefing boy. Let me guess, this break, it kind of looked breakable. Or not. Oh, it's a shame they don't give you a health pack anywhere. Right, we'll know much better than for next time. Hmm. Okay, so come down the lava path, they take a little lift. When in doubt, just walk out. Once again, Stroney assumes she can't go somewhere without trying. I mean, every other part of the game has been like, you can't go there, you must destroy something in order to do it. So, XK is... So, as I was saying, XK is me. For, um, assuming otherwise. I am definitely getting Kablamo's, like, right now by that guy. In a cavern. Secret cavern. Secret cavern. Fly away from the loofy. The Cougar. Secret, secret, secret, secret cavern. How am I doing this on one HP? Seriously, drop me at least one HP. Like, don't be shy, game. Don't be shy. Drop me one HP. All of it? All of it feels good, man. Have I cornered myself? Be honest. I haven't cornered myself. I need to keep going. Keep going. We're breaking free. We're so good. There's no a-me-king. Uh, a tank. I can handle a tank in my wee baby armor. I can handle a tank. Look, Zia, just scream free. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. I'm praying. See? All is good. This game, I ain't got nothing to worry about in my little elemental guy. I'm so tiny and cute, okay? I need to stop flying. I need to destroy these guys. Wait, there's someone behind me? It's Zia! Naughty. You're not supposed to go behind me. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I don't have infinite health. If you could all just group up and stop and start missing your shots, that would be great. Please, group up and start missing your shots. Thank you. This has been... Oh no, the cougar is coming up to me. Better get a move on. The cougar is chasing me. P.O.V., you're a college boy in the classic American popcorn film. The cougar is coming for me. See? See? They said blast the building because the gate is controlled by it. Does that actually mean that, or did it not mean that? Oh, this, sorry. The comb's coming. Let me in. What's in here? Other than... Jackpot, kid in a candy store. Captain, um, Captain, stop window shopping. The Atlas will do fine. Atlas time! Let's see how we do with this stop, boy. Whoa. Hello. Daddy's home. Okay, let's see. Oh, next mission. No, still same. Still same. I remember. Okay, I don't want to waste too much ammo on that stuff. Okay. Oh, one hit, baby. Well, I bet he regrets it now. Show em' this. Size max. Whoa, it's probably the... Wait, hold on. How do I aim? Okay. Holy. Holy schmooze. Holy schmooze. No, back up. I hate when they do that. Stop. Hey, dang. I'm overheating. Oh, my God. The Atlas has very limited mobility. Holy crap. Like, even turning to look at him? Very limited. Okay. Enough out of YouTube. Jeez. Let's see what we got here. Okay, there we go. Yeah, the mobility is like, whoa, it's rough trying to do it. But I actually like that detail being like, oh, I almost fell into the lava. You didn't see that. And I like that it feels like, oh, you know. The only thing about that was we caught him napping. Punch through that weakened wall section. We caught him napping? Sure. Right, let's see what we're up against. Right, it's a few tanks. Nothing that I can't even do. Whoa, there's... You take forever to shoot for how... Please. Nope, you do not need to start destroying the natural rock foundation. As fine as it is. Here's the next. That's a barrier. I complete this game all day. Has everything just got more HP all of a sudden? Oh, wait. Oh, it's just a cougar. Uh, I'm scared. I don't like the lack of mobility. I'm talking about... Where is it? Oh, it's down there. Okay, he's in the lava? Hello? Are you hurting yourself? Oh, make it rain hell. Oh, please. Okay, I'm completely comprehend why the Atlas was my dad's favorite mate. Because, oh my goodness. Literally make it rain. Yeah. Oh, gosh. Oh, hold on. What's this one? Oh, wow. That's actually really overpowered as well. Is there any health pack for troops during this one? You look like... Yeah, we got it. Lack of mobility makes up for the HP, the armor, and then the four death rays attached. Also, real guns. Yes, I quite agree. Wait, am I going down there? I came from there. Yeah, question mark. Was this the one that got him all the wins on multiplayer? Yeah. Wait, I must be... I didn't say I must be supposed to go through the lava, but I didn't see it, right? Right. Oh, I see it. Can I get it before it gets me? I can. You too? Oh, it's so nice being able to reach the enemy before the enemy gets you. Oh, shit. See something in the distance? It's very blurry. I don't know how blurry it is for you, but... The mech just... The mech. The enemy just like... Whoa. Look at that. That's so nice. Right. Hold on. Okay, let's go. Mech time. Who are we against in this lovely enemy? I think because of his health being so low, we're just gonna blow this guy down. Easy, easy. And actually, we could probably drop the bridge on him. You know that? Oh, I want his health outside the lava though. Yeah, there we go. No, don't go in the lava. Sugar. He fell back and... Well, it's not like we need a major HP. I don't know. Maybe we can touch it gently. Easy. Just tip two. Hey, we go. Right, we're dead. I'm gonna break the bridge so the lava isn't a problem. Because I don't want to lose health the lava. I can't... I see nothing. Yeah, it's a very cloudy game. I... I guess we did. It's kinda a bit cloudy. Is this not gonna break? Can you break it? Lasers will break it faster. I'm gonna hold it off for the mech. I assume... Well, I assumed completely wrong. I am actually gonna have to walk in the lava a little bit. Oh wait, no, no. Oh, wow. Okay. I just love making things harder for myself, clearly, because spending the time to do that only to yield absolutely nothing is pretty good. That's not good enough. Right, I've been given special services. Partygoers? Where? Oh, here. Uh... In here? Whoa! That's the lava in me that came out of nowhere. Are you these guys? One... Oh, there's a mech on the battlefield. Hold on. Mech first. Oh, hold on. Two! Atlas! Is that an Atlas or a Magiskun? Scoot's Freddy. Okay. Is that an Atlas? No. It's just tangible. No, it is an Atlas! Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Little Atlas moment. Tee hee. Great. So what do I need to do? Take my one by one, and then just hook up all their insides. And then your neck. Wah. Wah. Not good, not good. I can't see nothing bumping. Pick it up, whatever it is. Okay, we're just gonna do this on the Atlas. It's the best we've all. Right, Atlas down first. Hold on. Is he smoking yet? I'd rather you smoke first than me, buddy. To be honest. Nah, let's rubbish that. Right. See you! Oh, sugar. I'm low health. Not good, not good, not good. Oh, it would suck if I had to restart. Come on, one big chug! One big chug on him! No, stop flying, mate, stop flying. Give me your health, give me your health. Give me your health, give me your health. Oh, right. Give me your health then, if you're gonna go down first. Please! I'm on my knees! Oh, sugar. I have to literally walk into this guy's bullet. Oh, that was so lucky I managed to cut that health. Holy crap. Wah. Wah, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky. Sorry, it's not luck at all. It's skills, complete and utter skills. I'm the daughter of a meccosalt prodigy. I will not have anything else. Right, I'm gonna look for any green buildings through the absolutely smoky haze that is this game. Holy, holey moley. I cannot see for the life of me. Any green at all. Like, seriously, any green at all. Or any hidden green, no. Am I okay? That was worth it. What is that off the head? What is? Oh, I upset something. Hold on, how do I get around? Just firing, I'm just firing. How do I get around? Is there no around? Is there only through? Sorry, my mobility's so slow that I'm trying to... Oh god, this looks like the path though. Oh, dumb ass, there's a path right there. I hope that there's something that's able to shoot me. Yeah, lucky shot, not lucky shot at all. As, eh, right, hold on. And then there's one over there. Can I see it? Nope, but you can see me or not? Nope, I missed. Something blew on my HUD. Bottom left, top left. Sorry, I'll let him bolt for health or something. Destroy this. I'd rather... Oh, I want to save my other ammo. Whoa, it makes the team out. I can't see him. Okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. I can moan down, I can moan down, I can moan down, it's fine. Oh god, he's got... I'm overheating like hell on there. Hold on, mate, can you just pause the fight? Pause the fight, I need a heal. Sorry, I need a... Not good, not good, not good. Oh god, he's burning though. That's what I want to see. That's what I want to see, not me though. We're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it. We're doing it. True prot\u00e9g\u00e9, momento. Right, what's going on here? Did I not successfully destroy that? I don't really want to... I don't want to... All is quiet. The Blake brass has been eighty-six years fled. All combat forces have been in the way. Okay, okay. Wow, that's why I want to hold on to the ch-ch-ch-ch-amel because it's soon. Was it too much to ask that that lunatic was at the party? Captain, we are en route to your current position. The Major has decided to bring the Icarus down right where you are. Foster, let's try not to crash this time, eh? Okay, a little slo-mo, a little slo-mo. Okay. We've obtained information that more suspected rebels are being made to work in factories reinforcing the word of Blake. Uh-huh. We can kill two birds with one stone by freeing the prisoners and destroying the factories. We're going to hot-drop you in, sir. Destroy local forces between you and the camp. Secure escape, bro. Take the camp towers out and, as always, flatten any hostile troops. Okay, I'm gonna take a hydration. Everyone please do hydrate. Shawnee destroys your mech and takes you as a trophy ASMR win. How rich do you have to be to build a mansion in a volcano? I mean, why would you even want a mansion in a volcano? Ugh. Okay, I've hydrated. Uh, right, let's see. Okay. Well, an assault class mech, the Atlas is an offensive force rarely matched. Yeah, sorry. I'm picking Atlas. If we're gonna get a lot of this, game does a good job of making these bad guys seem bad. I hope I'm not the bad guy. Well, we're already on mix fight. Hold on, there's a wee guy there. Can you all lock on him? Thank you. Did we chop her as well while we're at it? Hold on. What? Nope. That's not gonna attack me. Okay. That's currently installing mods to give me extra XP to use. XP is XP, is that it? Wah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, hold on. I think this might, oh wow, that shotgun blast definitely is the one. Get out of the lava so I can at least scavenge your dead parts. Come on. Yeah. Oh no, I can't pick it up. It broke the magma. Ah, draft. Okay, it's fine, it's fine. Racing for racing, but it's fine. Can't pick up the supply. Okay, the magma breaks. I assume it will break under the weight of my mix. You know, all things considered, I probably weigh how many tons? On ironically? I don't want to waste too much of the shotgun. The shotgun seems so effective against the enemies. I can see you guys. I can't target you. I wonder why it's not enjoying the targeting as much. Hmm. Oh wow, that's actually a decent chunk, so I mean, hold on. Stop it, stop it. No, no, no, don't hide from me now. You started the fight. I'm gonna end it. Do you understand your actions have consequences? You're gonna find out now. Goodbye. And I'm here if you were following orders. You're done for. How much have I got? Oh wait, I've got infinite bullet ammo as well. But I've only got... Oh wow, okay, sorry, I'm just gonna use the... Who have I got? Okay, let's get rid of you and then let's get started on you. But you'll need to come down so I can pick up your supplies, okay? Yeah, that's exactly what I want. Okay, perfect. I... No, no, no, no, you're gonna... Can the game kill itself in lava? Hold on. I need you to pick up your stuff. I'm not even kidding. Please, just perish. Come on, please, game. Wow. 100 tons of Atlas, I believe it. How much health? How much heal? Like that. Like that. Right, yeah. We're just shotgun. You're totally crap. The shotgun on the Atlas is something else. You know, I didn't even tell my dad I'm playing this game because they are probably filming after the stream if it's not too late. I'll be like, stop! I think it's an outpost. You're right to the outpost comm tower. Dust it. It'll be kicking me off the PC so you can play it, actually, when it gets here. But now... Come on. Stop it. There's so many wee ones. But their damage adds up. Like, that's the problem with it. I add up. Where's that? Oh, my God, I see it. No, and it saw me. Drap. What's going on here? I don't... Why is there so many health stations? Why is there so many health ups? There are, like, six around me. Hold on. How many am I? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. How many am I? Oh. That's why. Because there's a new mech coming in the way. Where are you? I'm using my ultimate. Don't worry. Ow! But you're not even on my side of the map. Wait. Who or what is shooting me? There's, like, something tiny shooting me. I can hear it! Oh. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, wait. That doesn't do anything against the new repellent thing. I wish we were there. What? Are we going to do it? Oh, my gosh. I feel like, because we've got Atlas unlocked, we actually might be close to finishing the game. Right. You! Fuck off! Holy crap. Uh. Oh, no. Hold on. Did I just unlock a memory? Uh. We may or may not be in for an absolute heck on earth fight coming up. With an intense amount of enemies. Do you think we can break these doors? I just realized I think I remember this map, and this might be the second blast. Oh, wait. There's a control room. Sorry. There. My dad loved playing this. Is it? If this is the map I think it is, we're about to enter, like, an eight mech fight later on down here. If this is the map I think it is, we're, like, on the second last mission then, because that was his favorite one. I am getting nervous. Have I just remembered? Oh, wait. There's something I'm to destroy back there. My apologies. Sorry. Oh, no. I actually think this may be the second last mission. Uh. Oh, wait. Sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Oh, no. I think it is. No. I think it is. It's not sorry. I think it should be done. Am I even going to hit? Nah. It's going to go out of range, bro. Oh, no. If this is the one I think it is, this is going to be a challenge. If I was my dad's favorite map, so surely that means I can do it. My dad's favorite map. I've all the standing spirit this time. Oh. I'm getting ready to get. So, of course, it wouldn't do that. Oh, no. Games hate hate. There's a special there. I think the enemy. Wow. You're the only one that can shoot with that. Oh, another make another make. Oh, that's not. I keep using that again. But that's actually not what I'm supposed to do. See these fucking me bam over the fucking tanks. Oh, my God. They like come out of nowhere. And look at the situation. Like I can't even. I cannot avoid these attacks unless I get lucky like that. Sorry. I'm just using shotgun. You know, don't hit me. Don't hit me. That's so rude. Honestly, it is right there. Members a smart sooner than expected. I mean, if we do it, then yeah, I'll take a cup of tea. I'll get some food, actually. Because I don't want to eat. We got him with their panty loons down. That's right. Getting that lava. I think they can hurt themselves in the lava. Unless it's only me because I'm classic video game. Oh, that's okay. There we go. Well, the good news is you're super close to me. The bad news is I'm overheating like no one's. Oh, they might actually get me. But sorry, I need to play safe. Oh, for goodness sake. He gets so close that I'm like getting cut cut. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Get that one first. Oh, maybe a double kill. He got damaged so much from that mech blowing up. Feels good, man. Feels good, man. Feels good, man. He got damaged so much. Okay. Much mutual happy. Mutual happy with how that occurred. That came out so well. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. You ready? You ready? How? No, you're getting sprayed, bro. You're getting sprayed just because of the... Okay. Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Good work. Let's free those villains. Get out of here and find Ragnarok. Calm down with you. Marked and on radar. Okay. I think we're doing a good job. Wow. Good job, man. That's always very satisfying getting a double whammy like that. Right. I'm like getting full up on like all this special stuff. Right. Full health. I'm full on everything. You know, I'm not until... Wait, I need that one. Hold on. Sorry. A little bit bigger than I anticipated. It's too easy for such a gamer pro like me, honestly. You can't, you can't hand... Oh, I'm full on that. Oh, that's the ammo type. Sorry. Is it this one? Am I being a dum-dum? Okay, I re-stocked eight more bullets, but that's okay. It's the energy coil. Is that why they're called? Because you guys are such a nerd. Oh, sorry. This is the one. Whoa. You survived that? I'm surprised. Pleasantly surprised. Not particularly surprised. Wow, I wish that... So this is the map I think is. I'm nervous for what's up ahead, but if it's my dad's favorite map, then truly it can't be that bad, right? Even though my dad was like pretty much number one on this game. Incoming bombers. Watch yourself. What do they do? Oh my god, they're literally fucking... What, are they B-52s? Jeez. You coming back for more or not? I hear a chopper now. You're a chopper. I don't like it. I'm gonna do some of these from afar, because there's a lot of noise ahead. I don't think I'm gonna be doing myself any favors just running in. I'm gonna break that just in case. I'll break this. That's fine. You're fine. I think those are what communicate the hail attack. I'm gonna try that. Oh wow, hold on. Man, I can't destroy everything all at once. Give me a second. Give me a second. Something. I think I just hurt myself by accident. I'm gonna build in. Drat. Drat, drat, drat. That wasn't part of the plan. Oh. That hurt infantry. Imagine being like, oh yeah, by the way, your job is to go against an atlas. An atlas? Call me a deserter. Freaking call me, I don't know. What's the type of deserter? Call me... Wait, why can't I think of one deserter right now? Call me chocolate pudding, because I'm a deserter. Get me out of here. Sorry, that took me so long. I don't know why that was so hard. Watch out for what? Oh, great. I assume there's something special in here. If it was behind a wee paywall, I'd say that as if it wasn't just literally one thing. A strawberry flan. Ice cream. A flan? What's that? A flan? Pancake or this? Oh, sorry, I missed. Yeah, that's what you wrote me. Imagine surviving that back. Cute. Yeah, sorry. I'm going to take every heal I get, because I do not have enough health. Ow. Are you a deserter? Because I terrimis- terrimis- you! Hold on. Oh. I wonder if that does damage if it hits me on the way down. For goodness sake. These tanks are absolutely calling me. Bro, I can't even avoid them. Is that geyser? Is that water geyser to cool me down? I'm not sure how much I cost it. I don't want to stand on it in case it's just a steam cloud. I don't know. You seem like water to me. Oh, my God. Sorry, I'm going to have to swap. These guys are not taking the shotgun shells very well. That's what I'm talking about. Crap. I'm taking some HP damage. I don't think the game- maybe the game does let you go all the way back because your instant's in the map. Like, it's one big map that's been unlocked. Sir, to clear the way for the prisoners, the turrets ahead need to be destroyed. Yes, sir. I've seen so many fixed defenses in one place. Are they pointed the wrong way? I don't know if they're fighting the wrong way. They're seemingly pointed at me. Oh, I can see it. Okay, we got it. Feels good, man. Okay, there's a health. Okay, I think I can see- I was going to say I'm pretty sure that can see me. Oh, no. Thank you. And another one. Thank you. Mech warrior, you should be able to see the camp from where you are. Yeah? Sir, looks like a very light, should be cake. No, that is bait, if I've ever seen it. I do not trust that at all. There is one more thing over there. Yep, there's another, another thing over there. Wait, so what's that supposed to- I can like- Am I supposed to go all the way in a circle? Like, around? Please don't worry if you're- Like, I cannot see what you're shooting at. I promise you, I can hardly see either. The crosshair is going red, which means the AI is locked on, so I'm just- I am just taking it as it comey come comes. Yeah, it's literally a trap. I'm sorry, but- There's only a light thing. Yeah, I don't believe it. Oh, I thought I should be able- Take it easy, easy. I'm even- Yeah. Okay, we made it down. Nice and safe, nice and friendly. There's no more turrets coming at us. Um, we'll maybe take a few- Oh, of course. Oh, of course the HUD was telling us the truth. Open the gates and defend the civilians. Oh, yes. I look very much like you. I'm to defend civilians. Why did that give me three? Fuck. Why did that give me three? Oh. Oh. Atlas, okay. Okay, where? Where? Where? Right side, right side, right side on the HUD. Scream down, scream down. I have heavy ammo. It's fine, it's fine. We are over-keying, but we're just going to keep on at it. Okay, we're just going to keep on at it. Why is that Atlas got special moveset? Okay, okay. Cool down. Cool down. Let this- Let this Atlas cool down. We're going to go next. We're going to pick up the health. We're full health again. Sir, watch yourself. The drop ship's returning and it's hot-dropping another mech. Uh-huh. Please be another Atlas, because I can handle an Atlas. I think it's a Ragnarok, considering how long this cutscene is going for. No. It's too Atlas-y! Oh my god, when two Atlas do together, they become Atlas-y, like, uh, stuff. Oh, oh lord, I do not like this. And there's so many bunkers in my way. Okay, that's why they gave me two health. I'm going to slowly worm my way back to the two health bits, as I destroy all the buildings in the way. Sorry, my bad. My bad, I'm just healing. Okay, there are two health to my left now. I feel okay. I feel like we're melting this guy pretty adequately. He is getting low. And maybe we can get a double kill if he goes down and hurts him. Oh, come on, hurt him. Oh, shit, I did not need to take that one. Okay. Did he take any damage for that? Oh, I don't think so. Okay, we can't shoot each other over the wall. He's, you're not shooting this. Okay, now you are. So, I can't shoot over the wall, but he can shoot over the wall. Yeah, sounds a bit rude. Have I got any extra? No, I accidentally picked up both of them. Oh. Oh, he's limping. Oh, I'm gone. Look at the goods, though. Look at the goods, though. Eh, look at the goods, though, that drop from atlases. Or atlasi. Any atlasi, enjoy. Hey, back. A high-ranking, oh, sorry. Prevent escape. I think we're doing it. Did I win the e-mech fight without realizing? When you two atlasi come together to make a baby atlas. Does this count now as three or is it more like a wasting? I have no idea. It was the repair yard. We're on payback. What's payback? Is it like, this isn't the last mission. I remember the look of the last mission. Shawnee, they sat with extreme prejudice. You know what you must do. Random questions, you still want to hold it? Naturally. I can't believe that freaking got 50k views. That's insane. Honestly, I didn't expect that. Shawnee taking on eight guys without breaking a sweat. All I'm seeing is that recording booth. The ASMR booth, sorry. Payback, a high-ranking war of battlefields. And one of the vehicles in the convoy. Okay, this might require a few attempts. I don't recall that magma gonna break and hurt me. Don't be distracted. Only one thing matters. Watch school for it. This convoy, this entire convoy. Wait, I don't have enough HP for this. Am I being silly? Am I being silly? Am I being silly? Now you can have it up to you to fly into the lava. That would be great. They're all in catapult heavy mags. To be sure you get the second to command, you'll need to knock them all out. Okay, so I'm to kill them. First mag down. Take up his health and then spray spray. Uh, sure. That's not even locking on. Wait, I'm getting a blary is... Hold on. What are the tactics for this? Is there tactics? Is there really healing up here? Huh? I basically... Well, I need to... Oh, wow. Holy crap. The AI is, like, ready to lock on. Oh, dear. I think we're gonna need a strategy. Oh! I think this might be the strategy. Uh... Oh, yeah. Okay. We've got one. Oh, there's health down there. I don't want to get too greedy now. I can let them pass. Oh! Did we do it? By accident? I think we did. Okay, let's go get some health. I think that would be the way to move right now is to grab all these boobies. Thank goodness I stopped, like, try hard on the target. Right, let's catch up a bit. He's a wee bit ahead. Sir, the word of Blake is in full retreat. Like amateurs, they've probably left something useful. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hold on. Is this fine? Yeah, okay. They do not have much health against an atlas like this. Bro, just accept it. You're getting wrecked. Oh, there's something going for me at the left. I don't know what it is. It's not amazing. Sirs, I'm reading multiple signatures. It looks like another convoy. Oh. Foster, when you looked at the sensors the first time, you missed a group of massive walking tanks. Get a move on and stop that other group. I love how cheeky they are to each other. You missed a group of walking tanks? I mean, honestly, she's pretty justified for saying it like that. Like, what do you mean you missed a group? One of those mechs. Keep after them, sir. What? There's so many enemies. Is there supplies up here? Is that why? I think there may be supplies. Let's see if we can get them. Oh, of course they take these pretty much. They're silly of me to assume other guys. Okay, boom. And then let's find all the good things in here. Quite a few. You, actually, I don't use rockets. I think we're doing it. I don't want to drink it, but I think we're doing it. Okay, we've got full health. That's B. Your target? This is tamed. You stop that right now. You stop that. You're trolling me. It's not tamed. Don't say such horrible things. Oh, wait. It must be supposed to be up or down right now. I don't know. Oh, fuck it. It says go this way. I'm going this way. They're getting away. Stop! Stop! You're scaring me. I'm in an atlas. I'm so slow. I can't even fly. No, it's another get the convoy for the getaway mission. Drat! Right. At least we know to destroy the bridge. And then I'll pick up whatever they drop. Okay, there is a fight. That's what I want to hear. That's exactly what I want to hear. I actually want a fight because I need my stuff a little bit. Okay. Okay. You're flying. You're flying. You're flying. You're flying. You get too close, but I want to pick up the kiddies. Okay, then we go next. Next convoy. Are they up there? Oh, please tell me they're not up there. Why would you do something to me like this? How am I supposed to get off? I'm not going back. I haven't even unlocked Wild Card and Bind and Avis. Like I'm like 99% sure because I've never had, came across one yet. I'll show you what my save file looks like in the Bind and Avis. You guys can be the judge. That's why in November, you guys are actually going to help me fill the unlocks I need. I think we might do one Eden run on the Bind and Avis stream. And then I want to play Lilith's read mode. Some people absolutely despise read mode. I actually quite like it. I find it quite fun, but only if it goes well, obviously. Mercenaries, you will force me to abandon this world and all it hides. For that, you will face death. Foster, can the Icarus get us off this rock yet? No, sir. Just local hops. Captain, return to the Icarus. We're going to- Was this? Oh, I almost lost. This is the end of the map. Holy crap. Oh, my God. Whoops. I honestly don't mind read mode. Who despised read mode is really hard. Begin our best interest to capture whatever lost technology is being evacuated with him. Assault space port. Someone has to go into a heavily guarded space port, blow the Blake drop ship, and kill or strand straighter. Guess who gets the job? Not it. Right, you are a briefing boy. Good luck, Captain. Foster, your job. You need to get the drop ship fixed so we can get off this planet and enjoy our R&R, after our esteemed captain gets done. That has like a billion enemies in it. As soon as you unlock the Atlas, Lilith, it's not too, it's not too tricky. Two more missions. Oh, my God. We're beating the game journalist. We're beating the game journalist. Let's go. Is the game sent me the wrong way? No. I'm being pranked. Clearly. You're blowing it right now. Can I get across this one first, please? Okay, now. I saw my life flash before my eyes. Oh, my God. Is this another timed mission? Yes or no? That would have time to be fucking around and destroying stuff. Oh, they have full health. Man, this game is short. Older games tend to be like that, although I think Conker's Bad Party is the only game that was like old AF, and it was like took so long to do. I mean, I've never completed it. I used to play the same mission as a child and then get stuck at the exact same spot, which honestly, that game was wildly inappropriate for me, inappropriate for me to be playing as a child, but hey, it gave me a personality, so I can't actually say anything bad against it. I'd actually be so boring if I didn't game. I don't even think I would have anything to say to them. I'd probably be like a mukbang type of person and just watch people eat food all day. I'd be like, oh yeah, this is time for it again. You're so in my face. No, no, okay, let's go again. Oh, okay, let's go again. Again, again, again, again, again, again. That was my humble mistake. That was my humble mistake. I do apologize. Literally went for a cheeky dip in the thing. The only thing that can kill me is myself. I am back to the video game. Okay, I need to sprint across the bridge because they're going to blow it up. I cannot believe I just did that. Into the flaming hot Cheetos. Literally, what an air. I can't believe I successfully managed that as hilarious. I'm so energy-honored. I don't know how I'm not in some e-sports team. Is that good? Not only am I terrible at the game. Let's try that again. This time, no perish. I'm pretty cheeky. Speaking, talking about hot sprang. Yeah, Conqueror's had Inuit on it. I, the childhood memory for me playing Conqueror's Bad Friday is bouncing on that sunflowers. Nothing else. I used to do it for minutes at a time. And then whenever I could hear my mom or dad come into the room, I'd get off them because I'd be scared they'd be mad at me. And they'd be like, what are you doing, strongy? Right, do not fall. Whoa, you idle. They had a funny little ha-ha. Oh, jeez. Everything's got an HP up there. You're not actually supposed to get stronger. You should get weaker. Right, do not fall off the map with time. Even if the mix gets all the way in my face. Oh my god, it's so fast compared to me. I think, oh my god, such a fast mix. Please stop. Please, I beg you. Give me a gun. Yeah, I don't think going invisible at this stage won't do anything for you, buddy. Please do not drop your guns on them. Is there anything else here? Or is this just like a... I am the great mate even. Oh, is this a dead end? OK, so I have to go that way. Maybe we can get a few licks in though. Yeah, we can. Look at that. That was a good lick. That was a good lick. Something, something red there. Let's get it. I love doing stuff from a distance. I'd save some of our HP. I hate the Dracula. I never got to that stage as a child. I unlocked the Sunflower, and then I think after that I was just like, I couldn't progress because I didn't know what was going on. OK, there's a lava flume. I guess I will love it. I will allow a lava flume. Just one, though. There shall be no other lava flumming near me. Oh, OK. Well, that's illegal to do that. Am I to destroy this? Gain access to the spaceport. OK, is it? Aren't you at me? Space... Space... I want to do a cheeky U-turn. Cheeky U-turn moment. Nah. I hate when they get a lick on me when I'm... The 80s, what do you mean? Way too distracted by Sunflower Booba. I did the pitchfork in Bunker's... Bunker's Kites for... Conqueror's Bad Ferdy. I did the pitchfork inside the hay bale. I did the Booba Sunflower, and then after that I just kinda... Like, I did the wasp. I did the bull, and then after the bull, I think I got stuck in the bale. I actually don't know how to progress, so you guys don't have to hold my hand when we get that game shot. I don't know if we can get achievements for it, because it's on rare replay, but I don't know how the achievements work in that game. Obviously, this is made before achievements really were a thing. Entertuality. Hold on. I'm trying to, like, rotate between both... Eh. The missiles and the shotgun. It seems to be very efficient, which I'm quite happy with. Take... Woah! Those are low keys! They're so fucking skinny! And, oh god, they have such high mobility. This shouldn't be awful. But they have low health. That's my benefit. They have low health. I love when they just take it, like a good little mech. Honestly, you're such a good mech. They double killed each other! Oh my god. I love when they take it, sorry, but, like, literally, this is the best feeling ever. Two for one. Yeah, their HP is literally so low. Okay, blow up the tunnel. Got it. Or the bridge. I don't know what one. Then the bridge? I just waste this one. I know it doesn't do as much damage, but I don't want to, like, waste my good ammo on it. If you like more old games, and then good game, good old games, it's, like, for steam, but some obscure stuff. Mmm. Their problem is I can only play games that I've had experience before, or seen be played, which is why I play games like Mech Assault, because I've seen my dad play it like a million times over. Oh, there's health there. Oh, and there's a helicopter coming. Oh, there. Sorry. I'm using the HUD, and then looking at the same time, which is the cause of me being there. Oh, no. Gee. I just picked the health up. Give me a second to do that. And your dad's in school. He plays mostly mobile games. He tried to get into Starcraft for a bit. He got in the floor, so he doesn't game that much, but we're going to play another game called Halo Wars. He was fucking addicted to that shit. Holy crap. He can get enough of it. And the difficulty can increase, and he got to a stupid, silly number and difficulty, which is honestly insane. Oh, my God, Halo Wars. Yeah, you guys have played Halo Wars, too. I'm not going to lie, Reefland. You'd get along with my dad very well. He was addicted to it, so we're definitely going to give Halo Wars a bash, but it's quite long. If I remember correctly, it's a long game. It's not like a... I think it may even be a two-streamer. Nope, I missed. No! I got him. Uh... Okay, there is a health spot. I think... I don't need it right now. I'm actually still health. I mean... My dad has quite literally taught me everything I needed to know about this game. Okay, the doors are open. Is this a fight? If I've ever seen one, it certainly looks like it. I think we'll try and talk. There's something going on over here. I don't like it. Is it a plan? There's quite a few... Oh, it's that building there. Okay, I see it. Hold on. Let's get rid of it now. We don't have problems. Okay, that's what we want to see. Take your time. Take your time. Time is on our side. Health is on our side. We don't need to be... Going absolutely fast as far as I'm aware. Unless maybe we do have enough. Oh, there is. We are over keeping quite nasty. Did my dad ever try Warcraft? I don't think so. He tried Starcraft. He got into a wee bit, but I wasn't saying he went MLG crazy. But he doesn't really game that much these days because of his work, but I'm hoping I can retire him next year. So, obviously, I've got quite a lot of motivational factors. Like, the girls motivate me to work hard. Like, my dad motivates me to work hard. But like, in the nicest way, like, if my dad wasn't cool with me gaming, like, you guys tell me stories about your parents kind of being a bit obtuse, like, when you like, game or whatever. If my dad wasn't like, cool enough to get into Xbox and like, get online and all of that, like, I wouldn't be a gamer. I'd probably be like, Ew, ew, makeup! Ew, ew! Oh, I love going out to nightclubs and grinding on people. Oh, like, So, I do feel like, oh, my dad or whatever, how it came up. Like, my mom as well, she never had any issues with gaming because my dad's game, so my mom was like, well, I don't, I couldn't get to... Oh? Uh... I don't remember that. Okay. Take it, take it, take it. Yep, that's right. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Give him everything I got. Come on. Come on, buddy. Parish. That's all we'll see. Right, you're next. Okay, that's all I want to see. That's all I want to see. Come on. Oh, look. Yeah, if you have an invisible guy, if you shoot, he becomes less invisible in the multiplayer. Whoa! Not what we want to see. Hold on. Let's get rid of this building. Not what we want to see. We don't want him to respawn on enemies. Come on. There we go. There we go. We don't want that. We don't want that. Unfortunately, I'm very, uh... Overkeating. And these guys move left to right so quickly. Oh, God, please hurt him. Oh! Oh, that's a... I need to change that to my donal sound. The sound of them exploding is just like such a good sound effect. Like, shaw. That is so good. Let's get rid of you. Uh, looks like... Oh, there we go. Right. Mama Dad gamed a bit, but he stopped less the time going on. Oh, my mom was like a Lara Croft e-girl. She loves Lara Croft. She loves the movies as well. We should watch Lara Croft movies for my mom, because I feel at home with it like I don't. I need to do what again? Shit! I spoke over it. The doors? I don't know. Oh, shit. What am I to do? Hello? Then you make us all players a little bit of attention. This? Shit. Doors can't be blown. What, you calling yourself a door? Calling yourself a challenge for me? Am I being dumb? Camera pan to the generators. Find another way. Okay, as long as we're not on a timed mission, right? Haha, what if we're on a timed mission right now? I was fucking around trying to look for... Lara Croft and Joy are in a multiplayer mech assault smack talker. When you guys are like, uh, is your dad single? Is your mom single? No! They're a gaming jewel! And they have happy marriage. And they have happy daughters. And all is good in the world. Oh, I see the generator. I wonder if I, if I broke that before. Would it have standard? Is there a daughter single? Do you want to meet my parents? Would you be nervous if I brought them on stream? Okay, now let's go fuck them up. Bring my parents on stream. Go to the... We officially cannot hit on stories. Do not hit on my mom and dad! Honestly. Do they want to be adopted? Do you want to be my stepbrother? Do you already know what kind of things I'm into? Are you sure you want to be my stepbrother? Yeah, I'll have you know what I created, I mean. I don't think it happened. Things would happen if you became my stepbrother. Oh yeah, okay, okay. All right, let's see what's going on. Okay, the base doors just closed, which I don't like. I'll bet that plane is loaded with goodness. Destroy the drop ship or it can take off. Well, considering you've locked me into a cut scene, you know, it's really getting away, I have to admit. It's really getting away. Okay, I think that's it. I didn't have much for it. I'm like, hold on, there's an enemy. Hold on, base. Okay, hold on. I think we're going to have to try hard a little bit. Maybe we do a little bit of sweating. Hold on, hold on, a little bit of sweating. Just a wee bit. Maybe, oh no, that's a terrible good one again. Oh, and a clue. I feel like he's so weak. Oh, no, he's weak. He's freaking glowing. Wow, okay, that was good. Bye. Hot heals, I got the H. There seems to be something up here. Oh, hi there. Whoa, the texture. I don't know what it is. I'm shooting at it anyway. Definitely not having a lever. Let's see if he can do the bit. In the Disney music scene, I can do the bit. Right, so this is just an end. Okay, I am definitely not good at it. What is going on over here? I'd be nervous to meet my gran. No, they shouldn't send love to you, but I feel like she would be the protective one. My gran's dead, so you don't have to worry about my gran? Yeah, you don't need to worry about her approval. She popped her cogs, so you're fine, Riflin. Oh, that's funny as fuck. Oh, honestly, it was just like, I'm like, did I see it or did I just let it go? I'm like, nah, that's actually kind of funny. Oh, shit, here we go, here we go. Oh, I'm so sorry. Nah, don't worry about it. It's not as painful. Oh, shit, I'm going to miss it. There's the dropship. Kill it. Wait, what? What you saw, straighter? What? Nah, it was like Solar's fuck to talk about it. Mercenary scum, you'll die now. You'll face Ragnarok. What is that? That's not in any of our technical readouts. Oh, my God, it's the Ragnarok. Oh, my God, that's right. His ultimate is invincibility. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. I completely forgot. I forgot. Holy shit. I forgot everything. Just send everything. Call the guards. Call the guards. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's fucking annihilating me for another day. Oh, my God. Show mercy. Show mercy, Modis. Show me mercy, Modis. Oh, my God, his ultimate is that freaking three rocket attack. I know he's got technology. We haven't. See you in hell, strainer. Sorry, sirs. Couldn't help myself. Well done, Captain. At least now we know what Ragnarok is, or it was. Sir, too bad we couldn't capture it and analyze it. Sir, what? Look at the feet from the cameras. Whoa, they had two? Foster, send in the tech. Oh, I thought I had to do a double fight there. I was getting scared. We need to stop the Stoom's Day device and save this world. Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. I thought we were going to have to do a second fight. I was like, I'm wasting 50% health. Ready to roll. Oh, man, all of us are depending on you. Got anything to add, Foster? Drinks on me when you get back? Good man. OK, Ragnarok. The Ragnarok is a unique prototype built using Loth Tech to provide massive stopping power. Wow. Look at that swagger. OK, let's see what we're dealing with. OK, we've got sniper bullets, rockets. Wait, and then... Wait, then how do I get big... How do I do the... Wait, how do I do that? Do that again. What's the red? I don't know what the red is. But I didn't like it. Have I had to secret Abeliae in all these mix that haven't used before? It's down on its arse. Yeah. Hold on. OK, what the fuck? Oh, OK. Of course. OK, let's see what we're dealing with. Why would we... All right, let's destroy that. Holy shit. I forget I have nothing to level with. I'm not getting hit. Now, I don't have as much health as the Atlas. It's not letting me select that one. Red is how long it takes to wield it. I don't know if you know it or working with people. Quick. I'm fucking trying, hen. Oh, my God, he's already on fire. It's fantastic. Wow. Wow. Oh, it's... I'm going to sneeze. It's so lovely. It brings a tear to me. Oh, how fucking easy it is with a regular ult. OK, let's get right into this. Wow, you can't do that to me. That wasn't very nice. Oh, this is a fuck up. OK, get fucked. Great, you fuck off. Holy shit. Yeah, I definitely do not have as much health. Can you... As if there's a wee bam up there shooting me as well. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, yeah. Take that, bitch. Hold on. Inbop. Sorry, I'm trying so hard. I would actually love to do this in one. Because the only time I totally lost was that crazy runaway mission, which you had to have known the layout to even know what to do. And I jumped off the map like a dafty. OK, that's fine. Ooh. Oh, this is what I remember my dad doing all the time. I think it was me. Hold on. I'll just fuck him up. Look at the thing in the background. I'd really rather not have infinitely spawning enemies. I don't know about you guys, but infinite spawning enemies is not my sound of fun. My sound of fun? Gee, I can hardly speak and play at the same time. I'm so sorry. I think my dad used to perfectly not destroy the buildings so he could collect all these items and leave them there. I'm actually sorry. I'm legit calling him after my aim is done. Because I need to know. I think it's true. Oh, come on. I got you. Bear in square. Oh, shit. I'm low health. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm getting my dad on the phone right now. He fucking walks me through this damn game. Hold on. There must be like... Oh, come on. Not another one. OK, I'll just talk about that. Where are these freaking supply bases? Hold on. Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. Why did the fillet go up? I don't know why it is up. I don't know why it is up. Right, I just tried that one last week. Are you? No, he's not. It's not reloaded yet. Can I get you first? Whoa, I need to start doing that whole crap. Please. Aim. Please. I'm begging you. Aim. Why aren't you freaking going off? Yeah. Oh, come on. Freak. Oh, come on. Please, I'm on my knees. I was far too early on that. That's fine. I can pick up the goods. Wah. OK, here we go. Here we go. Where is he? Oh, fuck, I missed him. I don't know where the fuck he was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, he's limping. That's what we want to see. Oh, thank goodness. Crap. I'm starting to feel the struggle. I'm not sure how much confidence I've got. I'm going to be honest. I'm getting a bit nervous. I'm getting a little shaky. I'm getting nervous. I'm going to grab this little guy over here. Hail's bar. I know. I know. Right, I can't grab that. I got this. Are these even possible? I just destroyed my health bar for that. Crap. OK, OK, it's fine. It's fine. OK, I need to use my ultimate. Holy crap. It like respawns so quickly as well. I'm still going to get to see you there. Hold on. OK, use my ultimate. Wham. Wham. It's ultraviolet. Whoa. Please do not glitch out on the last mission. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Hold on. I'm going to dream far. Sir, Atlas inbound. OK, OK, I can handle it. Atlas is gone. Let me just get the other things that are kind of to plant me up with this. Oh, here he comes. Right, ultimate, ultimate. OK. Uh, how often? OK. Am I just kind of the mercenary? I have a prolonged escape to real life. I am. I'm happy to be the mercenary. Hmm. I don't like that. OK, ultimate's ready. Please. OK, yay. We hit nothing. Let's go. I love hitting nothing. OK, he's on fire. He's on fire. I'm also in trouble equally, though. Please drop pieces of health I beg of you. Whoa, those rocks are also falling. Let's destroy a few buildings while we're at it. Yeah, I'm going to need the ability to see if there's going to be more enemies about to spawn in. I'm going to need the ability to see if this thing's going to be great instead of, like, playing hide and go seek. Zero aim assist on the health fire. Yeah. It's the field of view in this game is absolute. Hey, it's all shadows. I'm going to be fighting shadows right now. Give me that. Give me that. As if I missed 20. Hold on. All right. Let's hope there's some health on the route because I'm sparking a little bit. My little ankles are sparking. It's just not a good sign at all. You need to traverse these lava fields to get to the drill. Yes, that's fine. Who's that? Oh, it's a mech. OK, well, that was completely overheated for that, not to get a look in. Oh, god, there's two of them. Sorry. All you're going to hear in this is, um, because I'm literally just spamming the button to activate it. I'm so sorry. I mean, it's working. Oh, is he in the lava? If you're right in front of me, you're getting ultimated right now. Oh, hey, that didn't quite work in the end, so that's OK. Come on. I'm so heavy. I'm so hot. The mech is like running on fire. Bro, you aren't going to give up. We'll get two health back from those two, which should take me back to full health. Oh, just under full health. He's not going to lie. I think that's how you're supposed to play this mech. Just constantly. Oh, wait, the lava plume. I'm supposed to walk through the lava plume. Is it possible to do it as little damage as possible? OK, hold on. Oh, no. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What have I done? OK, OK, OK, it's fine. It takes a hot second for it to actually register you're in lava, which I'm quite glad about. Wah, OK, that was a bit silly of me, but we did it. We did it. We're fine. Kind of. We're fine. OK, big one. It might take a little bit of damage. We better, we better, we better, we better. Could have been worse. Could have been worse. OK. OK. OK, ultimate time, I guess. Oh, completely missed. No, I hit. Wah, I hit, I hit, I hit. Now, if this mech could just calm down a bit. Whenever I hear something aiming at me. The gate ahead will take you to the drill approach. Hurry. I see him. I see him. Oh, there's fucking Atlas as well. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. Do not like this. Hold on. I need to pick them off. Oh, my God, I need to pick them off. OK, Atlas has really low mobility, which I'm going to use my damage. One is taken down. Maybe the Atlas can take some fucking damage. OK, he's limping. That's what I want to see. That's what I want to see. I want to see you limping, darling. No, you want to limp for me, don't you? Oh, yeah. OK. And then, ultimate. And then, receive. I'm going to spam you down until you're nothing. OK, perfect. Perfect. I don't know if I can grab that. I may be able to grab that with my invincibility shield. Holy crap. I think we're doing it. I don't know what mission we're on. I don't know if we're at the end of the game or not, but I think we're doing it. OK, perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. Perfect. Stony, leave me limping for real. These fights are getting kind of heated. Look, the map's covered in lava. I'm overheating as a mech. It's not a bad joke if you put two and two together. Jeez. These guys are terrible. Whoa. Next section. Ready to rock number two. Oh. Sir, the trail isn't far down this path. I am leading a number of large mechs defending it. I wonder if they even know what they're guarding. Captain, good luck. We're depending on you. Yeah, you keep saying the whole world is depending on my shoulders. That's quite a lot. I'm not going to lie. Like, you know, not a lot gets to me, but saying that the whole world depends on me, like right now, right at this very second. Yeah. Sorry, I was just checking if there's like any secret behind me. Stony, you always huggy here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right. OK, wait. If they've given me eight minutes, this round can be done in four. I am OK. Holy shit. I'm getting obliterated. I'm not the good thing. Like, actually obliterated. I've not even started. Oh, my God. And I'm so slow to turn around. Oh, I got him though. OK, I got him though. I got him though. Oh, my God. Right. It only takes four minutes to finish this mission. That's how it works. That's how it works. It's four minutes. That's all. And I'm already over here. That's safe. Oh. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. For a man. Four minutes. And I can't even get around the corner. Four minutes. I'm already lost the frickin' minute. Please. Video game work with me here. Yeah, that's right. You better be. Yeah, you better give me real quick. I don't know if I'm fucking good. I'm sorry for grabbing this stuff. But if they gave me eight minutes, that means I have four minutes to fuck all the show. Are we already here? Or did I have eight minutes to come here? Whoa. You perished. Am I supposed to perish you? I feel like it. Uh, what? I just wasted everything on that ship. And that wasn't even my target. Please, Atlas. Not now. Please. Surely. Oh, I've actually fucked that because I went for that ship. And it wasn't even my target. It wasn't my target. I've actually pulled that up so badly. Okay. We'll need to restart because I messed that up. But that's okay. Oh. Hello. Oh, because I aimed at that ship. I got annihilated. Holy. Hmm. Holy moly. Okay. Okay. Yes. I understand. The drill isn't far down this path. Okay. Right. Let's go to the choppers first. We know there's choppers ahead. Okay. Here they come. I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do. I'm going to be honest. It's tough to rule. Hold on. Holy moly. I'm wondering because of the environment as well. Oops. Sorry. Oh, and I just damaged myself. Lucky me. Um, because obviously I'm just so good at that. Uh, it's actually my best winning strategy in this game. Let's see if my snipe is better than this one. Tanks are going to come around the corner. Okay. We already know that. Oh, one's down already. Okay. We're doing a much better run already. I need to keep using my ultimates. Give me full health. Do not shoot at the ship. The ship is not the objective. Shabby and harem. What the heck? I was about to redirect it to you. Don't be selfish, Shabby. Get back online. Right. Okay. Take a breather. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Atlas is on fire. I repeat. Atlas is on fire. That's what we want to see. Atlas down first. Atlas is the biggest issue. Hi, harem. We're playing mech assault. It's not the easiest game. It's a very old game. Very much an older game. I am doing absolutely dog ass right now. Holy crap. I'm messing this up so badly. Right. Got one. We've got one. We've got one. We've got one. That's all we need. My Ragnarok flame is a fact. That's fine. The second Atlas is now fucking up my ass. I'm not the good way. I am using my ultimate so much. I really am. I'm trying my best. I am darling. So I'm trying my best. Hi, harem. Hi, Shabby. What was the... What was the... On the agendination for the stream today for sheepsters? Actually, there's underwear. What one it could be. Oh, forgive me for sake. I'm going to get a couple ammo. I'm going to need to pick this up. This fucking Atlas with his real gun is going for my cooter. And not the good way. Okay. Let's get rid of him. Whoa. That's not Atlas. It's a different floor. Right. Get you. Can you take some damage? That would be great if you could have taken some... Like, honestly, don't be so selfish. Take some freaking damage. Hold on. Oh, please hit. Please hit. Okay. We've got two hits. We've got two hits from our ultimate. I'll take it. He's on fire. He's on fire. That's all I need to see. That's all I need to see. No. Sorry, mate. I'm getting more and more. Fuck you. Get right. Get right. Get right. He's limping. He's limping. Oh, yeah. I'm going to pick up the stuff that dropped over here. Okay. Oh, shit. Hold on. There's like a few things on the map. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. There's a few things on the map. Hold on. Hold on. Give me a second. You guys need to relax. Relax. Relax. Wait. Relax. Oh, my God. What's the problem? I'm just trying to destroy everything. What's the problem? Sheesh. You guys don't have any fun. Are they infinitely respawned? Or am I misappropriated? Holy crap. Are these guys infinite respawned? She's falling for the bait. Here's the drill. The grunt spam is probably to waste time. Fuck you, old bitch. Fuck you, bitch. Fuck you, booty. Fuck you, bitch. Am I supposed to sacrifice myself? I actually don't remember how this game ends. Uh, I'll listen. Self-destruct. You must confirm triggering the self-destruct sequence in order to blow up the drill. Press the A button to self-destruct. Am I going to get a cutscene? That was so chaotic. Okay, I sacrifice myself. Okay. Wait, we save all of humanity in the door. You can get this. Wait, did that survive? The drilling device is going critical. Keep in it. Any chance our boy made it? Unknown. There's a secret escape pod? Hey, Tiger, you're finally awake. Oh, right. So Lieutenant Foster and the Tex have been looking at your little toy. We thought you were taking the dirt nap for sure. Nice trick. Sirs? Your cockpit carried you out of that inferno and straight back to our loving arms. Sirs? You really need to see this. Oh, no. This is technology that we have never seen. And this is just the start. We're not sure yet what all it can do, but it saved your life. I wonder if the enemy... We handed it to the word, saved everyone's butt, and in the process definitely got the prize. The other Dragoons are still down there mopping up the remaining fanatics. Most of them started running after you, 86, their commander. We beat them on this planet, but I have a feeling this war is just beginning. The problem is a lot of them got away and they'll spread like a virus. So congratulations. We've earned our pay and a permanent place on the word of Blake to the list. Yay, the framerate's fucking dying. They'll be coming for us. And I'm damned if I'm going to give them your toy back. Question is, are you ready for this sport? Sure. I'm ready. We did it. And the video game journalist lied. This game... Oh, sorry. Hold on. My Xbox's dust issue. Hold on. Oh, my God. What the heck just happened? Jeez, Louise. Oh, yeah. Sorry. The dust is really building up. Holy crap. We actually did it. I'm so surprised. I better just play that game. Hi. Hi, I'm Strawny. I don't even have a chat in slide. Hold on. Nope. That's just... That's just my... Where the heck am I supposed to be on this? This? Oh, I'm hiding. Oh, okay. Hi. Oh, let me turn off reactive model. We did it. I said, let me... Is that reactive model? Is that how bright I normally am? Jeez, that's so bright. Hi. Hi, Hirom. Thank you for joining. And thank you, Sheepsters, for redirecting into me. Wait, are you straining? The cold fish? Heck, yeah. I don't know if you can hear my little background music should be in right now. But we freaking did it. I didn't realize Sheepy was gonna finish, to be honest. I was gonna redirect into her, but I don't know if anyone else was coming on. Where is it? Is there anyone alive at all? Will you play the second game? I didn't even know there was a second game. Oh, Mamosa. Yes, okay. I can happily redirect into Mosa. Right. Just so you know, I'm going to do my membership ASMR stream early, because I genuinely thought it was gonna take like a couple billion hours to do this. And every single Veloer model has so much detail. I don't even think the girls know this. Oh, well, I spent a pretty penny. Yeah, but we're like, your models look like shit. And it's like, try again. Good luck with that, mate. Good luck. Like, I'm sorry, but we got designed out the wazoo. And starting remember, you have a bedroom scene. I forget. Oh, somewhere. Yeah, I'll set up for the ASMR. Um, I didn't know Mekosal even had a second game. I don't even think my dad played it. Hold on a minute. Your phone, I'm gonna be like, dad, do you recommend the Mekosal 2 game? And he'll be like, why, Strony? And I'll be like, I may or may not have played it on stream, the first one anyway. Um, oh, I didn't know. It has spectacular lighting. Yeah, oh, your phone. And the start in street. Oh, you guys haven't even seen my singers. I don't even have my singers that are like activated. I don't even use it. The dad, and dad will watch the whole vlog. Honestly, he'll start giggling if I send him the link to that. Um, but he's busy with work, which is why I'm trying to get him retired, because I don't want him to like work himself until a heart attack or something like that. Does dad play anything? Um, I would say no. However, when he comes over, I'm gonna download Halo Wars for him, and he can play Mekosal. I'll keep this installed if he wants to play it. Um, dad gaming channel when? Are you more interested in my dad gaming than me? Strontium Games. Call the channel Strontium Plays Games or something like that. Quick, donate to the dad retirement fund. No, no, no, no. Let me earn it. Let me work for it. Let me upload ASMR. Let me do an exchange for goods and money. Let me do that, okay? Hey, you should do Halo Co-op. I think we will. I think we will. I'm like, I don't know how much patience and how long he'll play it for, and the problem is if I ask him questions during the game, he's probably gonna be like, Shawnee, shut the fuck up and try to play the game. He'll probably be like, wait, you talk and play through the game the entire time. I'm like, yeah, that's how it works when you stream. You can either talk to chat and like respond to what they're saying. You can commentate the game. You can go on a tangent and that kind of thing. But he'll be like, look, I'm here trying to like defeat the covenant, like shut up, Shawnee. And I'll be like, okay, thanks, dad. Okay, I'll try my best. That's my only thing if I did try and do Co-op with my dad. But maybe I could record it and like put it into like a funny highlight video instead. Because I was gonna do like my dad guesses VTuber names or my dad renames VTubers for the heck of it. Cause if you thought Fondle of Boozom was bad, my dad's gonna start naming VTubers like after Celtic players and be like, oh, that's Nakamura. Oh, that's, is it John Elton was the manager? Someone called John dad and dad, dad names Jen too. Honestly, that'd be funny. He plays the game. I commentate over it. Oh, possibly that would work out. Um, would he call Azura tits McGee? Oh, absolutely. He, my dad is like absolutely hilarious. Like one time we went into the Co-op together and they sell these like frog cakes and he gasped and he went, oh, Shawnee, it's Peppy. Like Peppy the frog. Is it true your dad is a fucking slime VTuber? No, Shawnee on stream would have 30 second delays so that Shawnee can censor it. Oh, honestly, I'm like, my name is Shawnee. Shawnee is not helping chat when he's being on stream. My mom. But yes, John Elton right now. The manager that used to be for Celtic. Oh, Jock Steen. Sorry, not John Elton. I don't, as Jock Steen was a previous manager at Celtic. We need him to operate a Cyclist VTuber. I think he'd rather stab himself in the Cyclops eye than become a Cyclops VTuber. Peppy the frog is my religion. My favorite animal is Peppy the frog. Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, yes, yes. I bet your dad would like a slime. You know what? I'll ask him. I'll, when, when he gets here, I'll show him a picture of the gen two concepts and I'll stick a slime girl in between one of them and I'll get him to rate them one out of 10. And I bet you he'll agree with me and I'll be like, that looks, he'll be like, that looks like piss but colored blue. That's what he's gonna say. He's gonna forget Shawnee the second, the stream blue. I know that's why we're not, we're not doing live. No chance. Shawnee and dad ain't, ain't coming live. If he says yes to slime, there has to be one. Okay, I'll make you a deal. If the slime girl outranks any veal or concept that we have, I will give someone a slime toggle. How about that? You can tell she be chatting here with the slime girl propaganda. Honestly, your propaganda is useless. Not all slime girls are blue. What, you want, oh, so you don't even want the traditional blue slime girl. It has to be an alternative color of slime girl on top. Wow, I see your priorities. I see your priorities. Shocking behavior. Shocking, honestly. Paint, purple. You want a purple slime girl? No. Shawnee is immune to boob again though. Shimmering orange. Shimmering orange. What, so she's fucking neon pea color. Orange, tangerine slime girl. I'll call her, I'll call her tango because she's tangerine. Why not? White slime girl, all right, you're done. You're done, mods, get that man. Jump on, jump on mods. Slime girl is the lowest tier. It's like McDonald's of slime girls. I have to admit, I agree with that sentiment. I agree, I agree. Nuclear yellow, white jar slime girl. You're done, you're getting timed out as well, right? You're all getting timed out. If your pea is orange, you need to go to a doctor. Are you squirming me right now? I swear if you're asking for slime. I'll take that BT. Yeah, good luck. Thank you for the tip, Rilke Cadmus. You take that bit because I know for a fact my dad couldn't give less of a, about slime girls. He, in a lineup of Gen 1's designs, I already know he's gonna like she be the most because they, because they're blonde. I do know her, her chest is out. It'll be she be he likes first, then Azura, then Mercy, then Icey, then Amylast. I can already tell. I can already tell. He's gonna be scared of the lollipops because he doesn't consume anime. If you don't consume anime or like any of that content, it can be a bit startling seeing lollipops. ASMR, Amy turns Strony into a slime girl. I believe her. Honestly. Yeah, my, this man likes them big. Yeah, he's definitely like, he's not gonna be interested in, I am not getting my dad to rate my beach ever model. That seems a bit, other than like, I'll tell, like he already knows that I'm Strony, like after and such thing. Understood, but we are in anime world. Lollipop covered slime girl. You know what? You know what? If I look back and chat one more time and see the S word, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going scorched earth. I'm going nuclear. Do I make myself clear? So I'm not looking at chat right now. I'm getting ready to redirect into mimosa because she's about to reach the watch time. So please do consider watching her. I am going to take a five minute break and then we are going to boot up. I like them. Scorched earth. Scorched earth is a saying where, you know what? We're in the information age. Scorched earth meaning, let's search it. Scorched earth. Used to describe a military policy in which all houses, crops, factories in the area are destroyed so that the enemy cannot utilize them. And in layman's terms, scorched earth means that you're all in trouble if I read slime one more time. I don't know why you guys are like so interested in slime. It's not. Why are you, why? Why? It's not going to work in each of her. Yeah, that's scorched. What's scratched? Oh, did I say it wrong? Did I say scratched earth? Scratch my arse earth. I'll scratch the earth's arse. Stronium will burn viola to the ground before having a slime grow. Now, if one of the girls wants a slime toggle, sure, knock yourself out just to upset me. I don't care if they want that. They can get it. They want it. They could get it. I'm not stopping them from any goals like that. But if you are asking me for a straight up slime girl, default outfit, default position, no, I don't care. I don't care. So any muscle mummy concepts, that's called leaks. I'm not allowed to leak that yet. All I can say is that there's been progress behind the scenes. That's all I can say. I'm not saying nothing more. Everything's under NDA. No, there's no NDA. Everything's under NDA though, but there's no NDA. I can't be also NDA. I fucking can't stand them. An elemental girl, like a flaming raccoon and that. You know what's funny? I sent away a spring in Skyrim, and I did not get back a spring in Skyrim at all. But I sent it away. So I tried my best. You are the NDA. I'm an NDA's worst nightmare. I am literally loose lip sync ships. I cannot shut the fuck up about all my interests. We've got the first animation back for the alternative video game, and it looks good. It looks good. I just don't know how long it's going to take. I still want to say July, end of July. If not very early August, incredibly early August, there's no way it's going past halfway through August. We're just waiting on the animations, and then everything, all the puzzle pieces can be put together once the animations are finalized. I saw a preview of Icy's animation, and you're welcome. I saw I'm going to say you're welcome. We only bring up some stuff to tease. Yeah, I know you teasing. I wanted to make a joke about our lips, but the Japanese one wins. I know. You need to be quick. You need to be quick, if you want to make a joke on something I said, because I'll be off it real quick. As the human race has proven, anything can be at this point. You want us quick? Are you kidding me right now? I swear if this is a slime girl. Strongly, if you're up for a scary game, a few days ago a game called Still Wakes the Deep came out. It takes place on a Scottish oil rig and has a great story. Oh, does it? Is it? Oh, I need to get a heart rate monitor. I don't. Hold on. Let me put it in my notes right now. Like right this moment. Hold on. Let me write my notes. Write my notes. Heart rate monitor because I need it, and then I need a new shot caller, or actually hold on. Sin sister, shot caller, cold smile. Her problem now, not mine. Yes, I might give it a shot. Also, actually Scottish voice actors, not Americans try to be Scottish. Oh, praise the fucking Lord. It's not that hard to find Scottish actors. It's that thing like Junkrat and Overwatch as an American, and it was like, oh, come on. You're telling me there wasn't one voice actor available that could do Maniac Australian? Yeah, I find that hard to believe. Mentioning the heart rate monitor, did you get the burner phone? No, I'm going to ask Sin sister if I could just use her phone number. Yeah, oh, well, yeah. Okay, well, we both just answered each other's question there. He's getting the feeling for having a shield generator. Is the Australian guy from Siege voice finals? I have no idea. Name two Scottish voice actors. Strony Cuttles and Sin sister. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all day. Anyone else? Anyone else? I promise you it's not that hard to find actual a Scottish. Well, actually, Sin sister doesn't count because she's not. She's honorary Scott. You know what I mean? Okay, look, you know what I mean? No, Sin isn't Scottish. You thought I was Welsh? What the fuck? Are you trolling? You did not think I was Welsh. Isn't Welsh like, I'm the only gay in the village that's Welsh? No. Sin is honorary Scott, which not actually is not. No one can do a good fake Scott accent. It's like there is no Welsh and Strony now. Someone thought you were Welsh or anything. Oh my God, Sheep Girl, Gen 2 confirmed. And then POV, you're supposed to be a Sheep Shagger. Oh, that's awful. I'm sorry for even saying that. It's funny in the moment, but now that I've said it out loud. Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous as well. But yes, I'll definitely, once the heart rate monitor comes through, I will be messing around. I want to do that fitness Nintendo game Ring Fit, but again, I need a heart rate monitor to show you how quickly my heart is about to explode because I'm needing to get some exercise in and because I'm streaming all along, I'm not really getting that exercise. I'm being a naughty girl. I'm not getting that exercise. I'm going to do it with you. But yes, I'm going to be doing that. No, I've got my first limited ad stream. No, this cannot. No, what? I've got, no. More things have been hit with limited ads. No way. My freaking, my RuneScape stream. My RuneScape stream where I got Wrecked and Connect 4 got hit with limited ads. Don't you dare, YouTube. Stop it, YouTube. You're so stinky. Okay, but all my other stuff is fine. Literally the RuneScape is probably because of the tinfoil. We spoke too much about BlackRock. They got me. I can't believe it. They're killing my income source. Right, I just, I'm going to redirect into mimosa in a second. I do want to say tomorrow, if I'm not mistaken, is Valtral, okay? But hear me out. It is two hours after my usual stream start time. Okay? It's going to be a shorter stream so I can focus on some ASMR work as I always do. In Valtral, oh, sorry. Ballatral or Valtral. It starts two hours later because Veeler having a meet-in. I need to make sure the girls are all good and even fine. Catch them up with them because I really had a chance to talk to them all. Obviously, Emma doesn't count because she's not even at her PC. She's not even in the company. But yeah, we're going to have a nice little girl group meeting and the best time zone for it was my start time because American, Europe, mashed together. And what do you get? A pancake. So I'm going to be two hours. No, I'm not going to be late. The stream is two hours later. So just keep that in mind for Valtral. The stream is two hours later than usual just because I'm catching up with my girls, making sure everything's okay and everyone's having a good time. Because it's all fine and well, like sending a message or a DM and being like, oh, are you good? But when you hear someone in voice chat, they can bring up concerns or they can bring up things they maybe hoped would be better or have gone better. So yeah, too early. I don't really think it's going to be that long unless we girls can. You know what happens when girls get together? Can't shut the fuck up. But yeah, two hours extra sleep. Nice. Yeah, it's literally for the folk who are like absolutely exhausted. You get two extra hours. God, my French tip nails are growing. The fuck is actually getting pretty gross now. I'll have to admit, yeah. Yapping intensifies. Yeah, basically it's just going to be a big old yap fest and I'll be like, I hope you guys are okay. And everyone will be like, yeah, you're okay. And I completely forgot to do that 5K celebration because everyone hit 5K. So I'm going to see if I can get the social media manager to post the artwork I got for it as a celebration. I cannot wait for you guys to see the 10K celebration on everyone. I got a really good artwork. Sorry, but it's like that. It's a beautiful 10K artwork. You VLU girls are running your purr fans' ragged. Are you drained like that one meme? Don't mention it. How's your heart doing? A lot better. It's still like blood underneath the skin. That's what it is at the moment. A video or a picture. An artwork. I got a special artwork for 10K,000 subscribers. For like, when everyone reaches 10,000 subscribers, it will go live and it's a beautiful piece of artwork. I absolutely adore it. I think we might try and work on free access rewards at Milestones. So you know how I'm kind of doing one ASMR video per 1,000 subscribers? I obviously am in a bit of a deficit and need to start uploading them. But I will. I'm getting on it. I promise I'm getting on it. I am going to see if the girls might consider doing, even if it's like a voice pack, for example, or like a thank you audio on the alternative account, something like that when they reach Milestones, just to make things like a bit sweeter, like any support you are clipping or tweeting or retweeting, or you know, any support like that. It just, it feels a bit sweeter and that you are getting rewarded for it. I think the problem is more YouTube you already made. I definitely did make the 2K one, but I'll go back to the drawing board. It's not a problem. I'm going to do a tapping one with my fake nails, because fake nails sound awesome when it comes to tapping anymore. And strong. Your feet are still hot listening. Oh, don't. Oh, don't say it like that. Don't say it like that. And I'm basically that Mexican alien. And but yes, I am going to let you guys get redirected into mimosa. Please do consider hanging about for a couple of cheeky minutes or so, because she is very close to being monetized. She just needs to watch ours. So she's pushing herself for an endurance stream, which has made her a perfect target for my Borderlands 2 gameplay that I want to sort out. I want to see if I maybe get it done in July. Mimosa seems like a good candidate. I'm wondering if I could grab an endurance stream from VNU, and then an endurance streamer from Mythos. And then it could be like a really cool four way like get to know each other. There's been fucking VTubers are so nice to me, by the way. Holy shit. I've got another ASMR collab on the way. Turns out VTubers like are so kind and give you the time of day. Like I redirected into AcoNono. Did you see her little fucking call saying it was so good? I don't know. Sorry, not AcoNono. I don't know. With the bouquets. And she was like, I think Strongie is a cult fish and stuff. And then she followed me on Twitter and I'm like, Gee, Willy, Curse, you've got me blushing now. Stop it. But yeah, VTubers are so fucking nice. Sorry, I don't care where anyone says. I'll defend VTubers. Yeah, alias. Literally VTubers are so nice. I said it. I said it. They're nice. Everyone seems so nice to me. What the fuck? They're not like, oh sorry, that was my controller. They're not like, oh you whore. I don't want to interact with you. They're like, oh my god, it's you. Yeah, I'd love to do an ASMR collab. And I'm like, oh, it's so freaking cute. The yes chant. Yeah, it's for him. We love VTubers around these parts. Let's go. Yes. Okay. I am going to go offline and give me 15 minutes. I'm going to get some food down my gullet and I'm going to get a cup of tea and then I'll come back for a membership ASMR stream again where we can just babble away to each other. If you an alias collab. Oh, I've not even, I've not, it wasn't alias. I was actually someone else who I've never interacted with before. They agreed to that collab, but I don't know. Maybe I should be a cheeky shite and ask alias. I don't know. I feel like it's getting really cheeky now because I think that would be my 10th ass collab and only one is up right now. But it's because I need time to do it. And I don't, as far as I'm aware, I don't think any VTuber is like, oh my god, you've still not done, you've still not sent me your script. You've still not like edited it together. I don't think anyone's being cheeky. I'm like, I think they can see like how hard I'm trying elsewhere. And I'll get there slowly. Things will, things will go slowly. Um, V4, well, I was actually gonna start getting on at them because Dr. Nova was so nice to me as well. She was such a cutie, Batuti. She did like the spit thing with Shibi's mouth and I was like, that's honestly so creative. My brain could not even figure out how you did that. A perfectionist. Oh no, I'm not a perfectionist. It's because I've run out of time and I'm mentally exhausted. Like yesterday, I had a complete like, um, my body finally broke down, but in a good way that allowed me to sleep. So basically I finished the Umi Plus collab after my three streams that day, just, just feeling like a little bit of an overachiever there. Um, and then I did, um, I went straight to bed. I went straight to sleep. I slept for about five hours, woke up. I was like, I need to birth this loaf of bread right effing now. Did that, had a shower, ordered takeaway as I do normally. And then I passed out again until Microsoft. I woke up 10 minutes before Microsoft, but I've finally had a rest. Like, I don't feel that exhaustion that was looming over me for so long. Like, I don't feel it right now. I'm so freaking glad. How's the loaf? The loaf, um, yes, it's gone. The loaf is gone. Well, the spit in the air, she's crazy. There's a lot of very unique stuff apparently. Oh, right. No, no, finally taking care. It's, things are so, it's because there's so much chaos and start in the first month, but now that the first month like is over, um, we can actually do it. We can actually do it. We can actually like achieve all our, uh, missions and objectives and all of that. Like, oh, and like fucking hell, it's been like, well, hold on. I'm going to open up my YouTube stats right now. It's been a month of streaming and I have made 300,000 views on my content. And the month hasn't even finished. I mean, hell, maybe even be more to it, you know? Literally, I am over a quarter of a million views and I'm a new VTuber and it's been a month. Like, y'all know, y'all know. Uh, what does it say for subscribers? 8,600, like it's the first month. This is insane. This is insanity. Um, so I definitely want to start pushing those ASMR videos out consistently because I don't want to, I don't want anyone thinking I'm taking like the PS when I'm doing it, you know? I thought she was about to say 300,000 dollars. Well, if I make 300,000 dollars, I'm happy to say that, yeah, Gentoon through your end production and no, I do not need to do a donathon. But yeah, for my birthday donathon, which is October 10th, my goals are pretty much set up to be agency-orientated. So yeah. Strangely, if you don't care yourself, you'll be mad. P.S. Considering it's you, I mean, that's surprising. It's because you put out four times the average amount of content, you get tons of views from your consistent viewer base. For again, I was getting worried, you guys aren't going to like stuff, but you always do. And I'm like, is this what unconditional love feels like? Oh, my heart. Oh, it made me cry. Um, I can't wait to see the birthday just to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood again. Honestly, I'm so, I'm so ready. Such a hard worker. I work hard because you guys won't beat me, okay? Did you see the Sheevee clip where she talked about all your fan bases, my wee wifling? All your wiflings are belong to us. You're a pretty likable person, thank yous, because I used to wipe ass in care homes. I mean, it humbles you very much when you wipe old lady ass, I have to admit. Or an old man gets a bone bone because you're having to change his diaper, so that's really fun. It really humbles you. It really gives you a very unique, strong personality, you know? Um, you could do a stream of watching paint dry and I'd probably watch it with you. Hey, let's do it. Shawnee, you need to learn that we love you. We love everything you do. Darling, that'll be nice to me. If we miss one stream, we miss a week's worth of yeah when it's compared to others. Well, you guys were telling me that people that do, that have membership, some people like do one membership stream a month. I'm like, this is an exchange of goods and services. You have to make the exchange of goods and services worth it. Don't you? All right, don't people move away if you don't make it worth their time, worth their whale? I wouldn't get humbled. I'm more like boosted, to be honest. I, I don't know if it's because I grew up looking after like cats and all of that. Um, that basically any puke cat or shat, it doesn't really faze me. And like, yeah, the thing, probably the thing that grosses me out is like a decomposing corpse. That's probably what would gross me out in terms of like body fluids and stuff. Like, I don't, this is kind of off topic, but um, you know, if you have a dementia patient in your care, it's actually quite common to do brown smearing, brown painting, if you will. It's actually quite common. Because when you have dementia, you lose, you don't understand what you're doing. And it's just a wee shame. And like when, you know, for example, when I entered the room, you know, you go, you get shocked at first and then you're like, wait, if I don't clean up this, this person, you know, they're going to be, you know, sitting in this situation and it's not nice. So you do the right thing and you know, you put your protective gear on and you get to work and make sure they're all showered and fresh sheets and all that. And you just get to it. That's, it's just how it is. It's very straightforward. I know it can be quite, quite daunting, I guess, maybe if the first time you're ever tasked with it, but it makes you realize like, look, yeah, okay, it's a bit gross. Yeah, it doesn't smell nice. No one's expected it to smell like marshmallow fluff or whatever. But yeah, you know, you just, you just go for it. You do the right, you do the best you can. Yeah, dementia decline has actually tried it. Yeah, it's, it's pretty fucking rough. I have to admit. Maui, Maui Gran had a fall and a lot of sickness followed. I don't know what it is. Well, I don't know what it is. Basically, old person has fall deteriorates rapidly. More news at three is the most common way that an old person pops or clogs. I don't know. Well, I don't know why because it's like a shock to the system and the body can't repair. I think they say after the age of 30, your body no longer is growing and becoming a new. It's just focusing on repair and maintenance beyond like 30. Did anyone paint anything cool? One, that's funny too. Shut the fuck up. The fact that you could do it is commendable. I've seen the bad parents. Like honestly, if you ever like have to be the caretaker of someone with dementia, don't ever feel bad if you have to put them in a care home. Like I know there's so many stories that come out about care homes being bad at this and that. I promise you at the forefront of care homes, there are people who genuinely have the willpower and the care, like they do genuinely care and try their best. The problem is the greedy corporations that purposely understaff entire units. I think my worst ever shift was like to people to over 50 residents on one floor. Like, no, it's not possible. It's not possible. So, yeah. Yeah, as you age, you get worse at healing and in the case of the elderly, falling loss of balance is like just, yeah, like fricking straight up. Hey, strongy, you done with gaming? I'm so sorry, MLG did it. The Microsoft was supposedly supposed to be eight hours, but that was a game developers assessment. So they were wrong. They were wrong. I've seen nurses in care homes mistreat the elderly. I would never have put my parents in one. It's like such a hard balance because to get at home health is not easy. It's not cheap. It's not even viable for a lot of people. However, I think with the rise of multi-generational households, I think that is going to be a very lovely solution. I would very much like to see in my lifetime the rise of multi-generational households again or very close-knit communities again. Gardening, I'm going to see that picked up so we start relying on the big supermarkets. But anyway, before I put my tinfoil hat on, how about we redirect into mimosa? I'll get some food in my tum tum and I will put up my membership ASMR stream in 10 minutes time. Give me 10 minutes. Make a salt was, it was good. I may have perished in the lava by accident. And I also bumrushed the last mission, which didn't work. Did you get your game? No, the way I type in game and then how long? So I literally type in mech assault, how long? And I'm pretty sure if you type it in Google right now, it says eight hours. Oh my God, what happens if we type the same thing on Google at the same time, right? Mech assault, how long Google? Main story, seven hours and 44 minutes. Uh-huh, that's right. And I did it in five, I think, roughly five. There's a site called how long to be, exactly. It's gonna be a membership tinfoil ASMR. Honestly, it does may take me long. It does may take me long to get started. Okay, she's a gamer. Oh my God, wait, what's this? What's the speed run? Mech assault, speed run, world, world record. Let's see if my, can I be the first person to submit for it? No, wait, I can be seventh place, shut up. How can someone defeat the game in 59 minutes? Whoever the fuck you are, elite two heroes, I'm coming for your British ass. Fucking 59 minutes, it took me five hours. Right, I'm going for seventh place. I'm gonna submit myself for mech assault, thanks. And ironically making strongy cuttles right now on speedrun.com. Speedrunners are insane. Seventh place gamer, yay, I'm seventh place. Let's go, seventh place. I'm just glad we did it. Let's go. Oh, elite two, viewer has their YouTube video link. Ah, I bet you're using cheats. I'm gonna watch that. I'm gonna be annoyed. She's in the top, I'm top seventh on mech assault. I'll tell my, I can tell my dad that. Where's my phone? Oh, my phone's not here. I'll tell my dad that I got the seventh world record on mech assault purely on the basis that no one has submitted for it. And then he'll be mega proud of me. I just checked and it's seven. Yeah, hell yeah. Okay, right, before I continue yappening all your ears off again. So yeah, literally top 10, same top, maybe I won't say seventh, I'll say top 10. I'll be like, I'll talk, I'm top 10 speaker on record me, but what do you mean? And I'll be like, yes, well, I'm gonna watch him take first place tomorrow, honestly. He would probably do that way faster than me. Right, as I said, I'm gonna end stream. It's gonna redirect you into mimosa. For those of you who are a member of Strony Cottle's channel, I am about to take a 10 minute rest to get some food in my belly. And then we're gonna do membership ASMR. And I'll get all booted up for that, okay? So I will see you tomorrow for some Beltro, which is two hours later, or I will see you in 10 minutes for membership ASMR. Thank you so so much for keeping me company through an insane childhood game, a childhood game, so childhoody, that I actually wasn't even able to play it at the time because I was so small and tiny. Okay, imagine checking the speed runner list and finding you lost to a watermelon cuttlefish, honestly. Okay, right, bye-bye. Thank you so much for the stream, Reflanks. I'll see you very very shortly. And have a nice day. Remember to hydrate and eat and stretch so you don't have any problems with your booty hole. Okay? Bye, Reflanks. See you tomorrow. Bye. Are you gonna tongue it? Imagine if I said goodbye like that. Oh, my spit's going everywhere. Sorry, I'm salivating. Sorry. Okay, bye.
