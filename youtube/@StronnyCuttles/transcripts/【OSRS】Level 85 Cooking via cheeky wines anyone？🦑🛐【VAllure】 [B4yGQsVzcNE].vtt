WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'll click the word

00:07.440 --> 00:08.940
Huh?

00:08.940 --> 00:10.940
Yeah, that's a lot

00:12.360 --> 00:14.360
Ugh, what an outrage

00:18.360 --> 00:21.360
Who says she hates us? I ain't even booted up yet

00:21.360 --> 00:22.860
Sheeeesh

00:22.860 --> 00:24.860
Sheeeesh

00:25.360 --> 00:28.360
Oh, I fucking got obsidian over there in the corner

00:29.360 --> 00:31.360
Testing

00:31.360 --> 00:33.360
What are we flanking?

00:34.560 --> 00:36.040
Test done

00:36.040 --> 00:38.700
Waiting to see if I get the results I want

00:42.040 --> 00:48.680
Okay, you know how I know I've gone live because every time OBS YouTube prompts

00:48.680 --> 00:52.840
The YouTube prompts me to say now's the perfect time to put an ad in

00:53.320 --> 00:57.480
At the start of stream you think that's the perfect time to keep viewer retention

00:58.320 --> 01:00.320
Greedy greedy greedy

01:01.920 --> 01:06.200
So I have just been delivered the news that my poor

01:07.000 --> 01:13.680
Clapping without my hands ASMR has been taken down, which is such a shame. I'm currently writing the tweet about it

01:14.880 --> 01:20.960
And so we can I'll read out the tweet that I'm currently writing about it. I've done like a little screenshot

01:21.520 --> 01:25.840
And it says I'm shocked in brackets. I'm not

01:26.440 --> 01:33.640
This is an outrage in brackets. The only outrageous thing was the video idea and the fact I even created it

01:34.720 --> 01:37.880
And then I'm gonna put I feel like this is

01:38.560 --> 01:40.560
unjust

01:41.560 --> 01:43.560
And just for

01:43.760 --> 01:49.500
Jumping up and down for 15 minutes making my cheeks clap

01:50.520 --> 01:55.040
Yeah, yeah, I'm just these nuts in my pants

01:55.960 --> 01:57.960
And my trousers

01:58.440 --> 02:03.120
This is funny is this humorous or is this not

02:05.360 --> 02:08.900
It was a good video how long did it stay up for I

02:09.920 --> 02:14.080
Timed it so it came up for hours ago. I have no idea how long it stayed up for

02:26.080 --> 02:28.080
Like an hour, okay

02:31.080 --> 02:35.160
Well, I am now an even more ASMR debt for the

02:35.680 --> 02:39.280
Subscriber count because I've also apparently passed 8,000 subscribers

02:39.800 --> 02:44.040
Which is terrible news because it means I know how oh seven ASMR videos

02:45.240 --> 02:51.480
Yeah, Azura can't eat a cookie. I'm not allowed to jump up and down and whatever happens happens man

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
And

02:54.680 --> 02:56.360
So

02:56.360 --> 02:58.360
Something that is yeah, truly

02:59.120 --> 03:02.460
Right. I'm gonna quote tweet my little beauty

03:03.400 --> 03:08.760
And then I will pin what world we're in which is seven. No, it's not it's 388

03:09.480 --> 03:11.480
please

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
I

03:16.160 --> 03:21.600
Just need to make sure the content your content was removed due to a violation the community guidelines

03:21.840 --> 03:24.800
What do you mean jumping up and down and making math?

03:25.240 --> 03:27.560
None hands clap is a violation

03:28.840 --> 03:33.520
Because it's your first time. This is just a warning, but how big is again your channel's gonna get a strike

03:33.520 --> 03:37.440
And you won't be able to do anything for a week. All right. No, we ain't risking a strike

03:37.440 --> 03:39.440
I got I got a stream record to break

03:40.440 --> 03:43.720
Second strike will prevent you from publishing for two weeks three

03:44.360 --> 03:50.280
Strikes in any 90-day period will result in a permanent removal your channel. Well, I will admit

03:50.280 --> 03:54.400
That's a wee bit dramatic for a bit of cheeky calm

03:54.400 --> 03:58.640
I'm wondering if it was the heavy breathing at one point in the video. I

03:59.840 --> 04:04.600
Went up to the mate and did it so I was breathing heavy

04:04.600 --> 04:06.600
I

04:07.760 --> 04:13.200
Wondering if I was a guy would it be different because obviously female breathing bad bad

04:13.840 --> 04:17.480
male breathing possibly fine question mark. I don't know

04:18.360 --> 04:22.400
because guys heavy breathing is like grunting and then that

04:26.160 --> 04:30.360
Yeah, that's what it is because the actual clapping segment

04:31.240 --> 04:35.520
Maybe I am just absolutely just too far gone

04:35.920 --> 04:41.160
But is it outrageous of me to say the clapping segment? Honestly, it wasn't that bad

04:41.160 --> 04:46.820
Like I just sound like I'm doing a workout and it's like what women aren't allowed to work out on YouTube. Wow

04:47.320 --> 04:48.200
YouTube, that's right

04:48.200 --> 04:51.680
We have to we have to play a few cards here so we can get the chit in the video back

04:52.040 --> 04:56.240
Wow YouTube, that's despicable women can't even breathe and

04:57.320 --> 04:59.320
2024 talk about 1984

05:00.360 --> 05:05.760
I got a couple of 40 years ahead, but I guess not all boo you to boo

05:08.400 --> 05:12.000
All boo time to get YouTube slimed, right?

05:15.520 --> 05:20.560
Let me just check the the actual screenshot doesn't have any information that we want you to stay on YouTube

05:20.560 --> 05:24.720
So make sure you understand and strike review your content or policies every view

05:25.320 --> 05:29.760
Right nothing says Johnny cut was legal name so I can post a screenshot

05:30.520 --> 05:36.120
Understand the strike will expire. Yeah bear expire, right? I've posted it. It's cringe and

05:40.640 --> 05:42.640
Holy shit I

05:42.640 --> 05:48.200
Have I was this I I did not get a lot of sleep last night because I was busy doing

05:49.280 --> 05:52.880
Business business business. Um, oh my goodness

05:53.880 --> 05:58.400
Who the fuck says it's hard to like talk to v-tubers are not in I

06:00.440 --> 06:02.440
I didn't believe you

06:03.880 --> 06:11.120
I spoke to two different. Oh wait. I have a timestamp on the video of why I got taken down and before it's the breathing hold on

06:12.840 --> 06:15.640
The video is loading it's gonna show me what part

06:15.640 --> 06:17.640
I

06:19.360 --> 06:23.560
Was the breathing in the air? I knew it was gonna be the breathing in the air

06:23.560 --> 06:28.720
I knew it. You can't you can't breathe on YouTube anymore. What is going on?

06:29.800 --> 06:36.040
Son bizarre says and I've disrupted the buddha tea and factual content policy

06:36.040 --> 06:40.680
It says audio content that's actually be bliss it is not allowed on YouTube

06:40.680 --> 06:44.480
We may make limited exceptions for content that have educational documentary

06:44.480 --> 06:48.720
You know what I should have started that video by saying I knew it was the breathing

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
I knew it was of course breathing

06:51.280 --> 06:54.120
Oh, and I need to take should I submit appeal?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.480
Submit appeal

06:57.720 --> 07:04.800
Well, it's a bit. No, I can't put a message in the appeal explaining that I'm a man, and I'm just a man breathing

07:05.080 --> 07:06.600
No

07:06.600 --> 07:11.480
YouTube the only downfall you need to let me explain that I'm a man

07:12.080 --> 07:20.120
I'm a man. Let me breathe. Okay. Well, it's not happening, but we are gonna take the YouTube training

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
We're gonna take it live

07:23.920 --> 07:29.200
I'll read out what I can see right now. SIGI uploads content of people using

07:31.440 --> 07:35.920
That is a violation I can't even read that out. That's how much of a violation that is chase

07:36.440 --> 07:43.400
In an official music video for a record labor a singer walks through the streets of a carnival the singers costume

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
consists of a bedazzled

07:45.400 --> 07:48.080
And and it cut and it covers everything

07:48.080 --> 07:52.080
No, it's not a violation because music videos can get away with everything

07:53.080 --> 07:59.480
Remember when Belle Delphine uploaded her music video and I got taken down and then everyone was like hold the

07:59.760 --> 08:01.760
phone a minute if

08:02.120 --> 08:05.440
Nicki Minaj can come out here when nothing but

08:05.920 --> 08:09.160
A bit of tooth floss. Why can Belle Delphine not do it?

08:09.160 --> 08:15.280
I don't know if you remember when that the internet was in complete uproar and then Belle Delphine's video actually got restored

08:15.560 --> 08:20.760
Because YouTube had to back off and admit that record labels had the most

08:21.360 --> 08:24.760
Favourable upload terms. Hey, there's nudity in some in

08:25.600 --> 08:31.840
Some music videos as well. There's just straight up because the record labels can get away with it

08:32.440 --> 08:34.440
Yeah, well, we're actually on the subject

08:35.680 --> 08:43.560
YouTube didn't think I forget all these little violations you do against the community. I'm in the know. No, you I'm in the know, right?

08:44.920 --> 08:49.400
Brian manages a museum YouTube channel each episode is a different tech

08:50.160 --> 08:51.640
topic about

08:51.640 --> 08:57.280
Ancient Japan at one point Brian shows a painting from the 18th century in which people commit

08:58.080 --> 09:01.000
She explains wait, I thought said Brian

09:02.800 --> 09:09.440
She explains the name of the artist the title of the painting this video doesn't violate the policy because it's giving

09:10.560 --> 09:12.560
information about stuff

09:13.680 --> 09:15.680
Check

09:15.960 --> 09:21.240
Yeah, I'm not even reading this stuff properly a movie has a bench all seen in it

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
Which the lead character are in their

09:23.800 --> 09:30.320
Undies the characters get into bed and under the covers they participate in inking a

09:30.680 --> 09:37.040
Fan uploads a reaction clip of the scene the video description has the name the director lead actors the year

09:37.040 --> 09:38.840
It was produced and there's nothing

09:38.840 --> 09:41.920
Bexwell about it. No, this isn't a violation then

09:44.360 --> 09:45.280
Okay

09:45.280 --> 09:50.240
Fat question five of seven. We're almost there. We're almost there five or seven

09:51.080 --> 09:56.320
Tyler uploads a video from his Safari vacation where he saw two lions

09:57.320 --> 10:04.360
Meeting with one another what he films the meeting and from afar titles lines meeting in the world in the video

10:04.360 --> 10:11.640
Description he describes the type of lion. No, it's not violation. It's just a discovery channel question mark. Yeah, that's correct

10:11.640 --> 10:18.240
Okay, I thought that a comedic prank channel uploads a video in which the creators test how far they can throw different

10:18.760 --> 10:22.480
Objects after throwing different types of food. They start throwing

10:23.160 --> 10:25.160
Bexwell boys a

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
And of all sizes

10:28.320 --> 10:30.800
This video violates because it uses

10:31.280 --> 10:33.560
Bexwell boys isn't allowed

10:34.360 --> 10:37.520
if the video violates policy because

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
The video doesn't violate policy

10:42.360 --> 10:46.720
It doesn't violate because the toys aren't being used the way they're supposed to

10:47.520 --> 10:52.680
Hello and before I got it right. I got it right. See I knew I say everyone wonder

10:53.320 --> 10:59.240
How do you know YouTube things as well? I don't have one limited ads video nor stream

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
That is the gospel truth

11:03.920 --> 11:07.680
It turns out my let me hold it didn't violate the

11:08.400 --> 11:11.720
Ads policy and it's not limited ads. Well, I'll get right

11:14.280 --> 11:20.680
Sorry, sorry, I'm trying to get right to say a news organization uploads a segment about

11:21.320 --> 11:23.680
Spanking. Oh wait, I just said the word anyway

11:24.040 --> 11:31.200
They show adults engaging in banking with clothes and different devices from hands to whip the video title and description

11:31.320 --> 11:36.360
Explain the talk and who's engaged topic and who's engaging in the act within the video with the news reports

11:37.120 --> 11:41.720
Prevides in-depth detail about the bettish and the science behind it

11:42.360 --> 11:44.360
it doesn't

11:44.880 --> 11:49.480
It doesn't violate the policy because it's

11:50.240 --> 11:52.240
Educational check

11:54.520 --> 11:59.240
We've got a seven for seven nice work. You've completed the training

11:59.240 --> 12:04.760
We appreciate you taking your time to help us keep YouTube safe. I'm the one that's a menace on YouTube

12:06.040 --> 12:09.240
Oh, I just I just burped and coughed at the same time and

12:10.120 --> 12:15.320
Your warning will expire on the 19th of September. Wow. That's a long punishment

12:16.080 --> 12:21.360
If you violate the policy again, you're just straight up get a strike if you violate a different policy

12:21.360 --> 12:24.760
You'll get a warning for the different categories of policies

12:25.880 --> 12:27.880
well

12:28.600 --> 12:32.240
Well, I tried my baby. I tried my baby

12:33.280 --> 12:36.600
I'm on a warning now. So that's Emmy on a warning

12:37.320 --> 12:41.640
For being outrageous. I will admit Emmy. You were being a wee bit outrageous. Um

12:42.600 --> 12:45.640
Can I pin it what world we're in

12:47.080 --> 12:54.240
Coot Azura got done in for a cookie and I got done in because I had the audacity to breathe whilst doing physical exercise

12:56.240 --> 12:58.240
James

12:59.040 --> 13:05.200
LKC lick lick James lick. Is that your name? Thank you for the gifted membership

13:05.920 --> 13:09.400
James lick. Is that it? I can't read it

13:10.000 --> 13:16.080
But yes, I successfully completed YouTube program at programming, right? We are in

13:17.160 --> 13:19.160
World oh my god all

13:19.640 --> 13:26.840
Viewers are speculating on why YouTube video titled strong a video was removed the video was popular and viewers are upset and I couldn't read it in time

13:27.720 --> 13:32.400
We are in world 380 for free and I think we're doing winds today

13:32.640 --> 13:34.640
Wings

13:34.960 --> 13:36.160
Um

13:36.160 --> 13:39.440
Now this is not an endurance stream

13:39.440 --> 13:43.640
Oh, but Stranny if you stream longer than two hours technically

13:43.640 --> 13:50.280
It's an endurance stream because less than two hours is the average reach of your stream time, right? Okay. Well, I get your point, but

13:51.640 --> 13:57.640
The long and short of it is I've probably only got four hours or we're gonna redirect into another veal or girl

13:57.640 --> 14:00.080
Okay, I have no idea who or what streaming today

14:00.480 --> 14:03.840
So actually well, I'm at it. I'm gonna check who has actually stream it

14:03.840 --> 14:06.280
I don't know if it's gonna be two hours. I don't know if it's gonna be four hours

14:06.920 --> 14:08.920
Because I need to go offline

14:09.560 --> 14:11.680
To go for a nap

14:11.680 --> 14:17.200
This is three eight nine straight. How the fuck do you how did you find me if I'm in the wrong world?

14:18.080 --> 14:20.960
We in a member's world man. We rich up in here

Eh she bees in two and him he's in four and has a class. I thought okay

14:42.200 --> 14:46.160
Then I don't really want to read into a collab with outside

14:46.920 --> 14:51.600
That sounds to I don't want to read into a collab with an outsider

14:51.800 --> 14:56.200
No, it's not like that. It's because I've been he I don't know I just feel like it's not like it

Okay, I do these reeflings calling all reeflings. Hey, we're in world 380 blazing

May or may not have found myself

18:16.120 --> 18:16.920

18:23.080 --> 18:25.080
Is like joke on my freaking breath

18:25.480 --> 18:32.520
I sent her a big batch. I've sent her a batch of five pre-made and six highlights on stream

18:32.840 --> 18:40.280
So I just want to say special shout. Yes a she clipper. I'm leaving kidding actual woman moment. I can't believe it. Um

18:41.560 --> 18:46.200
I just want to say special shout out to anyone who uses youtube's clip

18:46.600 --> 18:51.720
Feature if I ever do anything funny mildly humours. Let's be honest. I'm no funny

18:51.960 --> 18:56.440
If I do anything mildly humorous that makes you blow a little bit of air out of your nose

18:56.520 --> 19:02.600
Please use youtube's clip feature. I can see what you clip and it basically means I can pass it on

19:03.080 --> 19:03.880
to

19:03.880 --> 19:10.280
The the the lovely lady. Um, I might actually introduce you to her if if all goes well

19:10.760 --> 19:18.120
Um, but I mean she has an outstanding portfolio. She's worked for idle and you know those like super hyper idle n click

19:18.200 --> 19:23.400
Super idle. No, sorry. Uh idle n clips are like edited for like running all that

19:23.720 --> 19:30.600
It basically haven't you learned from your ASMR stop breathing. It isn't doing you any favours literally. I'm scared to stream ASMR now. I'm like

19:31.400 --> 19:35.240
I can't even fucking breathe can I man? Like oh my god

19:35.880 --> 19:40.920
Clipper debut when oh, she's fantastic. Honestly the portfolio is insane

19:42.040 --> 19:46.120
Um, and they also do highlight reels if I wanted a highlight clip of something

19:46.120 --> 19:51.880
So I might ask for buckshot roulette highlight, but I don't know how busy they are. I had to message

19:51.960 --> 19:55.320
Oh, I guess I'm like so I feel so cringy when I mess up like

19:55.800 --> 19:59.240

Um, I always thought I'm like, oh my god, your portfolio is like so impressive and I was like, I'm so sorry

20:10.680 --> 20:12.680
but I don't know what your

20:12.680 --> 20:18.040
Your rates are as well as if you have any new client spots because if you didn't know most people

20:18.520 --> 20:19.560
When they're established

20:19.560 --> 20:27.480
They most likely have a one-on-one editor highlighter that does everything like consumes the content and produces it for clips type thing

20:27.960 --> 20:34.200
And I was like, I don't know if you have any space and she replied back and followed me instantly and I was like

20:35.080 --> 20:36.920
Are we?

20:36.920 --> 20:41.480
So, um, I have like 12 shorts being produced

20:42.200 --> 20:44.520
Um, I'm currently waiting on

20:45.800 --> 20:50.840
So there's like three editors between the girls as well, which makes things a lot easier

20:50.840 --> 20:56.520
Like I have my own dedicated clipper like I commission her separately for whatever clips I like get of the girls type thing

20:57.080 --> 20:58.840
um

20:58.840 --> 21:00.840
Oh my god slime girl

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
Right, right, right

21:03.960 --> 21:07.800
If I see one slime girl complain one more time

I am not having a slime girl. What would the design be? She doesn't even have any april

21:46.280 --> 21:51.080
She doesn't have armor. She doesn't have anything. I have no interest in it. I've in

22:05.560 --> 22:07.560
Oh, it is bruised

22:08.600 --> 22:14.920

22:15.000 --> 22:20.440
Is that like I'm done a bruised banana. No, I don't hate slime girls

22:20.520 --> 22:25.080
I absolutely adore suzu from monster musume. The problem is

22:25.640 --> 22:28.040
Think of it in terms of a vtuber model

22:28.440 --> 22:32.840
Nacos one color a wee bit of a hairstyle and that's it like

22:33.480 --> 22:39.800
What else am I supposed to date with that? Sorry? It's just no one. It's just no one. It's not appropriate

22:40.440 --> 22:42.440

22:45.160 --> 22:46.520
Oh

22:46.520 --> 22:50.440

22:51.560 --> 22:57.560
Oh hell no, this can't be jigsaw. No a school uniform. Mercy's uh already in that

22:58.520 --> 23:02.760
If you didn't notice mercy is in a student uniform that was by design

23:03.800 --> 23:07.720
It's very messed up and but she is in a japanese school girl

23:07.880 --> 23:12.120
April if that's your thing. I purposely put that in because I know it's a lot of people's things

23:12.680 --> 23:15.720
Uh, that wasn't that was a production note on mercy's design

23:18.440 --> 23:22.200

23:59.160 --> 24:06.680
Um, I love the big hips big arm thing going on. Absolutely adore it truly

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480

24:15.320 --> 24:21.960
Uh, I don't really know if I should say it got thank you again to the incredible tipper yesterday

24:22.760 --> 24:29.720
aim for the the gen two production tip that was a an insane amount of money

24:31.080 --> 24:32.360
Um

24:32.360 --> 24:39.080
For that you've actually you pretty much paid off the concept artist. Um for that kind of money. Um

24:40.920 --> 24:42.920
There has been

24:43.480 --> 24:48.520
Aces hips exactly there has been a mild update now. I keep it on the download

24:48.680 --> 24:53.080
Don't want the don't want anyone to be upset, but um, there are two designs

24:54.040 --> 24:56.040
that are

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
Pretty much accepted

24:59.960 --> 25:01.960
um

25:02.040 --> 25:09.080
We just need the artist the modeler the modelers already been contacted. We just need to see what their thoughts are what they can do

25:09.320 --> 25:14.040
Um, we're looking into possibly custom poses

25:14.680 --> 25:16.520
um

25:16.520 --> 25:18.120
for

25:18.120 --> 25:20.120
each girl it's um

25:20.280 --> 25:25.240
It's an interesting thing to do. Um any hints, uh

25:29.560 --> 25:35.880
I don't think I can give any hints mercy actually is very familiar with one of the designs. Um

25:36.200 --> 25:38.200
I

25:39.320 --> 25:42.520
She actually got quite fond of one of the concept designs. Um

25:43.960 --> 25:48.680
But I don't know if she wants to talk about it or if I should let her talk about it

25:48.680 --> 25:55.000
Because it's like a design that doesn't even I have I am going to see if I can get the girls to

25:56.360 --> 25:58.360
Um

25:59.880 --> 26:01.880
I'm like the girls to what

26:02.120 --> 26:04.120
I

26:04.440 --> 26:09.880
Five thousand subscribers actually I think we're all approaching five thousand subscribers, you know that

26:10.520 --> 26:12.760
Sorry, I'm trying to do like oh, sorry oops

26:14.440 --> 26:16.440
Let's do 14

26:17.880 --> 26:20.280
How does it know to do 14 I never told it to do

26:21.400 --> 26:25.000
Uh, I think the girls are very close. We actually have celebratory

26:25.960 --> 26:27.960
Art work when everyone hits 5k

26:28.440 --> 26:30.440
Azura and icy are coming up

26:30.520 --> 26:34.840
I'm actually going to get them to do an ASMR video which I think will push them over the edge

26:35.560 --> 26:37.560
Obviously Azura we're having a

26:37.880 --> 26:42.680
So we can't put up Azura's meme video yet. Um, but that will definitely help boost Azura a bit

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
But I am going to send

26:45.480 --> 26:50.280
AC and Azura on their merry way to create me an ASMR script and I'm going to get it up

26:50.440 --> 26:51.960
Is up

26:51.960 --> 26:59.400
Um, because I truly in wholeheartedly believe the girls can clear 5k easily in their first month. Um, I

27:00.120 --> 27:02.120
I'm going to see

27:02.840 --> 27:05.080
Um, emmy the freaking hard worker

27:05.960 --> 27:11.800
She made a thumbnail because her and ac are actually doing a audio collab, which is fantastic

27:11.960 --> 27:17.720
It is going on emmy's channel when she's away on holiday. I can say that emmy broke the news

27:18.280 --> 27:22.440
She going on vacation. Okay. She's going on vacation

27:25.160 --> 27:30.520
And she updated her youtube profile picture so she looks so menacingly evil, which is hilarious

27:31.320 --> 27:35.240
Um, it's actually I will say one thing now don't get me wrong

27:35.480 --> 27:37.880
I'm sure a lot of management's wouldn't like this at all

27:38.440 --> 27:43.000
I like coming online and being like, oh what he's done when I've been asleep

27:43.400 --> 27:50.040
And it's like, oh right. Okay. Every changed her profile on youtube. Like, oh, that's cute. That's sweet. Um

27:51.080 --> 27:52.600
ac made a

27:52.600 --> 27:56.840
Oh emmy made three, uh, twitter audios. She absolutely did

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
She she gone for it, uh

28:01.080 --> 28:04.680
Pin pals, I do not know what you've done to my cute innocent little sister

28:05.000 --> 28:11.080
She was not like this in the interview stage and I'm getting scared of her. Her power is growing and uh,

28:11.560 --> 28:14.040
Yeah, it's uh, I'm starting to monk us over here. Okay

28:15.000 --> 28:16.520
Innocent

28:16.520 --> 28:20.280
You should have seen her in the interview. She was nothing but polite sweet

28:20.520 --> 28:23.880
She was actually the most inquisitive question wise

28:24.440 --> 28:31.400
Um, you know asking all these different aspects and like, uh, one of the funniest. Oh, I felt like such a flex

28:32.280 --> 28:37.160
Felt like such a flex. Oh, she was like, how how's the company funded now?

28:37.160 --> 28:45.000
It's like the company has been seated. There is no debt. The banks do not own the company. The company is self-owned

28:45.560 --> 28:52.280
Oh, thank you for asking that question emmy. I'm humping on I'm gyrating on my chair right now

28:52.760 --> 28:56.760
Oh the flex. Oh the company's seated. Oh

28:57.880 --> 29:03.000
Absolutely, I don't sorry. I'm a bit too energetic for first thing in the morning, but oh

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
Oh, how satisfying

29:06.360 --> 29:12.200
Anyway, I do do love me a little interview. I hope the girls couldn't attest that the interviews are probably the most relaxed

29:12.280 --> 29:16.120
Interview they'll ever get in their dying lives. Uh, because it is so unprofessional

29:16.840 --> 29:21.000
I'm like, hi. I'm scottish. If you can't even understand me

29:21.480 --> 29:25.880
Just just ask me to repeat myself and they're like now. I understand you. I've heard you before and I'm like, oh

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
You're not supposed to hear me before

29:29.800 --> 29:31.080
um

29:31.160 --> 29:38.440
Stroney, literally. I was like company seated. Ah money's all there. Ah, no debts

And complimented the girls because they've been so nice. Uh, and I've seen their content

32:03.880 --> 32:09.640
I'm quite impressed by all their content on that. Uh, so I've been a cheeky shite and asked for two ASMR collabs from two different

32:10.600 --> 32:11.880
agency v-tubers

32:11.880 --> 32:18.040
So I don't know how everyone's fucking greeting on twitter being like, it's so hard to be nice to folk

32:18.280 --> 32:21.000
If you go in there and state your business boom

32:21.240 --> 32:25.480
People it's almost like people reply instead of the hey, hey, we're both v-tubers

32:25.960 --> 32:28.440
No, if you're both v-tubers that doesn't they make you pals

32:28.760 --> 32:33.720
That's like saying all postmen of the world are best pals because they deliver the post. No, that's not how it works

32:34.280 --> 32:40.600
Uh, I think I think all those tweets are folk going hey and someone's dms and they're like, I can't be arse with you right now

32:42.280 --> 32:45.560
That's my only like that's the only thing I can ascertain

32:45.880 --> 32:51.160
All right, just spell my name out sin. I'm not even asked you for an ASMR collab yet

32:52.360 --> 33:01.080
So you can't even not sin it's actually so sin's really easy to talk to literally I was like, sorry delaying your thing for a

33:01.640 --> 33:04.200
A couple of weeks because my dad's coming over and she's like, oh fuck you

33:06.040 --> 33:08.760
And we've got like shot colors on standby. Right. Let me finish this

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh

33:13.880 --> 33:16.680
99 prayer after cutting you must be joking

33:17.320 --> 33:20.760
I bought membership for this by the way and you can do wines for free

33:21.560 --> 33:24.920
I'm so sorry if I tricked anyone into buying runescape membership

33:25.240 --> 33:30.920
I thought we were gonna cook like those little weird starfish. Oh, where am I going? I don't know

33:31.320 --> 33:35.560
I've gone over here now for some reason. I don't know how I perfectly collect that bank

33:35.720 --> 33:41.560
But I'll come back over refunds. Give me a second. I just I wanted to collab with my

33:44.200 --> 33:51.320
My favorite is a married man. You get your succubus ways. Oh away from him. She hates this. I don't I'm just dumb

33:51.320 --> 33:55.400
But I actually miss click. I don't know how I perfectly miss click that that bench though

33:57.000 --> 33:58.760
Um

33:58.760 --> 34:01.560
If you didn't know sin sister

34:02.280 --> 34:04.360
79

34:04.360 --> 34:07.320
70 freaking nine. That's fantastic

34:08.200 --> 34:10.200
um

34:11.000 --> 34:17.560
Sin is actually a retired succubus. Yeah, that sells a one. Oh, oh, oh, right. You want to start with? Oh, that's a no

34:17.560 --> 34:19.720
man. All right. All right. All right. Um

34:20.680 --> 34:23.800
Literally level 79 we're getting there. Um

34:24.760 --> 34:26.360
If you didn't know sin

34:26.360 --> 34:28.120
sister's lore

34:28.120 --> 34:30.120
is actually

34:30.120 --> 34:34.360
She's a retired succubus and if you look at her loading screen

34:34.760 --> 34:39.080
If you may have never noticed this because I didn't notice it until like the 18th billion stream

34:39.080 --> 34:44.600
I had watched of hers. I was watching her supermarket stream a while ago. It's fucking hilarious, honestly. Um

34:45.720 --> 34:52.520
Her loading screen has the person that summoned her dead on the floor with a smash keyboard over their head

34:54.120 --> 34:59.400
Look at that next time you see her loading screen because I never noticed that detail for the longest time

35:00.520 --> 35:04.040
After cooking it should be construction. So so shawty can design a cute house

35:04.440 --> 35:07.560
Always gonna play hide and seek in the house with you guys

35:08.520 --> 35:12.520
Monka is literally sin. That's our father-in-law. How could you?

35:13.960 --> 35:20.680
Um, but yes turns out communicating with v-tubers is really easy if you just don't waste their time

35:21.000 --> 35:27.240
So, um, if you are a shy v-tuber that is lurking in the shadows and you always want to collab with someone

35:28.200 --> 35:30.200
Just say hi

35:30.680 --> 35:35.720
Just say hi name. I'm this person from this agency if you're from an agency

35:36.360 --> 35:40.920
Uh compliment them and say that you uh something that you enjoy about their content

35:41.160 --> 35:48.200
Um, so it shows that you're not just like messaging them to collab like it shows like I've actually consumed your content

35:48.280 --> 35:51.560
I've appreciated it from afar. You know that kind of level of thing

35:52.120 --> 35:53.320
um

35:53.320 --> 35:58.760
And then just say hey, this is what I would love to do if you don't have time completely understand because you're incredibly busy

35:58.840 --> 36:04.760
It is that easy peasy. No, I think we've got enough wine and grapes. I'm gonna be honest

36:05.400 --> 36:09.640
Oh, we're getting steaming on the kebab. Why is everyone giving me a kebab?

36:10.920 --> 36:15.080
Is this my breakfast? Thank you for feeding me reflin. I got a kebab

36:19.640 --> 36:22.440
I think I have enough now that keyboard

36:23.400 --> 36:25.400
Literally, literally me

36:25.720 --> 36:32.760
Uh, and while you're at it, didn't you upload breathing ASMR by the way? I got a violation for clapping my cheeks

36:34.120 --> 36:37.560
In an ASMR video apparently it lasts it was up for an hour

36:43.560 --> 36:50.040
Um, I pretended to put in an appeal but uh, yeah, it's not good. It's not happening

36:51.000 --> 36:56.520
It is not happening at all, but hey, hope that's it's how the cookie crumbles

36:57.880 --> 37:01.640
That's how the cookie crumbles. I literally missed it. I'm pure raging. Don't worry

37:01.640 --> 37:07.080
I'll send you the audio custom for you baby cakes. It was literally me like taking my I kid you not

37:07.080 --> 37:12.760
I took my prel off like my weaponry um and uh my plate skirt and all of that

37:13.480 --> 37:19.080
And uh, I basically got coconut oil and started jumping up and down which creates a clapping noise

37:19.320 --> 37:22.520
So I called it clapping without my hands ASMR and no

37:24.120 --> 37:28.520
I think it's hilarious. I don't care what anyone says. That's the funniest idea. I've probably ever came up with

37:29.000 --> 37:31.720
Um, and I will never be able to top that

37:32.440 --> 37:34.120
Uh at all

37:34.120 --> 37:39.320
So unfortunately my ASMR debt has increased to seven videos yet again

37:40.520 --> 37:46.920
So I wasn't there. I was there. It was great. I do apologize for anyone who missed it. Um, I

37:47.400 --> 37:48.600
I

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
For you for those who missed it

37:51.560 --> 37:53.560
I will buy premium

37:53.640 --> 37:58.280
On my alt twitter so you can listen to it for free. Okay deal

37:59.400 --> 38:01.400
But in return

38:01.800 --> 38:03.400

38:03.400 --> 38:10.200
Thank you. Mommy. I'm not worthy. Okay. That's all. Yeah. You just have to take. Thank you mommy. I'm not worthy

38:10.760 --> 38:12.760

38:15.400 --> 38:17.400
You'll start to learn the ways. Okay

38:18.520 --> 38:24.120

38:24.840 --> 38:29.640
Location that i'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. Uh, look at you groveling

38:30.280 --> 38:32.280
Just for a little audio. You're so cute

38:33.320 --> 38:36.520
Good reefling very good reefling

38:37.240 --> 38:44.520
Um, yes, it is up on patreon right now for my if i'm allowed to plug the patreon. Oh

38:48.760 --> 38:53.640
I am supposed to have wait, um, hold on

38:56.600 --> 39:00.520
Uh, hold on. Oh no

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
Oh

39:05.240 --> 39:10.760
Where's the uwu market freaking oh for folks sake, I don't think I can search right now

39:11.320 --> 39:15.800
I'm supposed to have a little icon up right now. That's like hey guys

39:16.200 --> 39:19.240
I have merch from uwu market and it goes in the corner and it's tiny

39:19.240 --> 39:25.000
But I can't find the freaking link in the chat. Can someone repost my links

39:25.480 --> 39:33.080
From the uwu market pack. I can't see it because i'm live right now and uh discord is

39:34.120 --> 39:38.520
In streamer mode and I ain't got the balls

39:39.080 --> 39:46.360
To take it off. Thanks. Thanks. Maybe question mark, but don't worry if you're busy girls

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I know

39:49.640 --> 39:53.080
I know you work hard kiss

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Absolutely

39:59.480 --> 40:04.520
Um, there's a new vtuber agency that's popped up and I've already forgotten the bloody name of it

40:04.760 --> 40:11.000
And the fucking owner of nexus follows me as well. I was checking out his follow man. I'm like, um, this one on here

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
What's going on here? Um

40:15.560 --> 40:24.040
Uh, no not socks but shout out to socks agency. Um, the owner of socks agency is actually super cool. Um

40:24.840 --> 40:32.600
He sockified all the girls actually so I should probably tweet out about it. Um, but I'm terrible at marketing and all that kind of thing

40:33.400 --> 40:38.280
Uh, no, no, uh, there's a new feature agency. What's that called? It's coming up

40:38.600 --> 40:46.360
They've revealed the designs, but they've said it's not like the finished version of the designs. There's four girls to a generation. Um

40:47.480 --> 40:52.360
But it's really interesting like I'm here. I'm sorry, but I'm here rooting for the underdog

40:52.440 --> 40:59.880
I'm here for these new agencies these like crater owned agencies like I think it's very clear like, um

41:01.320 --> 41:05.960
You know people are getting a bit sick up and fed. Um, is it sick up and fed? Yeah

41:06.920 --> 41:11.560
People are getting isn't that shit postage? Oh, no, no, no, I weave it's a bit shit posty

41:12.040 --> 41:15.480
But um, I got to like basically

41:16.360 --> 41:20.360
It sounds silly. I got to interview the uh, the sock puppet agency

41:20.920 --> 41:22.920
um, but um

41:23.320 --> 41:28.840
You'd be surprised how like uh, based it was like behind the scenes. I'm be I can't say anything

41:28.920 --> 41:33.480
But it was very surprising to hear the motivations behind the agency and that

41:33.720 --> 41:38.520
so then it'd be surprised if I'm sucking on sock agencies toes or anything like that because so is a

41:39.080 --> 41:42.760
I've seen everything I've seen so far. I like and I've actually got a

41:43.480 --> 41:48.280
Two girls that were pre-established in one new or starting fresh. I can't remember

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
Hey there. Hi socks is actually making it real. Yes

41:53.880 --> 41:55.880
um

41:56.200 --> 41:57.160
Uh

41:57.160 --> 41:58.680
Small corporal piled

41:58.680 --> 42:04.600
I think people are getting a bit tired of the endless new wave new wave new wave

42:04.680 --> 42:08.440
This'll this'll help new wave new wave. Well, we have a stock market

42:08.520 --> 42:11.720
Oh, we actually like care about money at the end of the day not the talent

42:12.280 --> 42:18.120
When people can see right through that you're only here for money with your talents and all that and these are

42:18.120 --> 42:21.880
Real people these are real people with real lives real issues going on behind the scenes

42:22.440 --> 42:24.840
uh, people get tired um and

42:25.240 --> 42:27.240
Stains start getting die die

42:28.040 --> 42:32.440
Die gets casted and stains remain you cannot wash away certain stains

42:32.840 --> 42:38.680
So it's very interesting to see now. Don't get me wrong. Uh, your agency's tiny stroney

42:38.920 --> 42:43.800
You're using even 5k yet fucking relax right mate fucking relax. Jesus christ. Um

42:43.880 --> 42:45.000
Um

42:45.000 --> 42:50.680
Like i'm actually going to do a short which is controversial. It's terrible. I know are you ready for the short?

42:51.160 --> 42:53.800
Uh, but but burn the yacht

42:54.520 --> 43:00.200
Oh, no, you said but the yacht. Sorry. Uh, sorry. It's a bit programmed in me to burn that yacht for some reason. Um

43:01.720 --> 43:09.960
I actually am doing a incredibly controversial. It's not controversial to me. Um, because there's a very popular youtube short

43:09.960 --> 43:12.200
And it goes how much do you v-tubers make?

43:12.840 --> 43:15.560
Um, but obviously inside the short no money

43:16.280 --> 43:18.040
Is mentioned at all

43:18.040 --> 43:20.920
So i'm going to do the controversial thing after a month

43:21.000 --> 43:26.040
I'm going to show how much I earn in a youtube short so people can get a grasp of like

43:26.120 --> 43:29.560
Hey, this is how much you can earn if you put your whole pussy into it. Um

43:30.600 --> 43:33.480
And it'll be very interesting to see what the response is

43:33.560 --> 43:39.800
I feel like the response from people who aren't really a fan are going to be like

43:40.520 --> 43:42.520
Uh, or this is

43:42.920 --> 43:49.720
This is an obscene amount of money and then the people who are like, holy crap. You're killing it type thing. Um

43:51.480 --> 43:58.120
Yes, I did enjoy a short from grin pen rose that was like how much do v-tubers make sorry to name

43:58.680 --> 44:00.680
them directly

44:00.760 --> 44:04.120
But it was like if you're going to title that and not tell the money, bro

44:04.200 --> 44:09.560
Let me let me cut to the fucking chase and i'll show you how much money i've made. Okay. Let me cut to the chase

44:10.120 --> 44:14.520
Um, and i'll do it since everyone's so shy to be like, yeah a surprise surprise

44:15.000 --> 44:19.320
I actually make money. Uh, I make a livable income with what I do type thing

44:20.040 --> 44:25.080
And before anyone's like, uh, you're just flexing your money. Oh, that's just like showing off your money and whatever

44:25.080 --> 44:30.440
I was like, no, I still like that either you you get a short. That's all artsy farts saying like all

44:30.920 --> 44:35.400
Oh, you'll never know how much a vtuber actually makes or you get my short where i'm like, this is how much i made

44:35.400 --> 44:37.400
This is how it works. Did it did it like

44:37.960 --> 44:42.600
You're trying to pick pick pick your path. Okay, because it's not even a path of an illusion at this point

44:42.680 --> 44:45.640
It's like either you want transparency or you want artsy fartsy

44:46.040 --> 44:47.000
a

44:47.000 --> 44:52.440
Watching a short for a minute and don't even get the answer to the freaking thingy flex that money strony you deserve it

44:54.120 --> 44:55.720
Um

44:55.720 --> 44:58.760
Yeah, revealing the secrets laws. See I don't

44:59.880 --> 45:03.800
I don't think it's like bad or anything, but um

45:04.200 --> 45:06.200
Yeah

45:07.560 --> 45:10.040
Edging versus releasing in short

45:10.840 --> 45:12.120
No

45:12.120 --> 45:14.120
That's hilarious

45:14.120 --> 45:17.480
But it's true though. Why like I was gonna do a short

45:17.640 --> 45:20.840
That's like a breakdown of the model prices and everything

45:21.320 --> 45:25.160
And because there's so many like how expensive are vtuber models?

45:25.480 --> 45:31.640
And then it doesn't say how much the model freaking costs in the end and then it's like oh, but toggles are expensive

45:31.720 --> 45:39.240
Toggles are additional fee. Yeah nice shit toggles are additional expenses because you have to get more artwork for it

45:39.400 --> 45:46.200
You have to do different calibrations for it. Like just tell us if oh i'm getting so angry i'm burping

45:47.000 --> 45:56.040
Just tell us tell us stop. Stop freaking edging us on vtuber like shorts. Why?

45:57.000 --> 46:02.600
Why am I like I shouldn't feel like i'm like having to freaking get blood from a stone

46:03.400 --> 46:07.320
How much are vtuber models and then oh it depends on your budget?

46:07.400 --> 46:10.200
You can also get these free ones as well and it was like, okay

46:10.360 --> 46:16.440
Well, thanks for absolutely nothing like i'm gonna do a big breakdown on the model prices of the girls and all of that

46:16.920 --> 46:20.600
Azura actually I have a short for her to make but I need her voice

46:21.320 --> 46:22.360
um

46:22.360 --> 46:25.000
I was basically gonna do like guess how much

46:26.040 --> 46:31.800
Are vtuber models costed or like who is the most expensive vtuber model at valer type thing?

46:32.360 --> 46:35.640
And then just reveal all the prices basically

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
Yeah, I don't like the freaking non

46:40.120 --> 46:42.120
I don't like the the the

46:42.280 --> 46:47.640
The short being a question and then the short doesn't even answer the question now. Don't get me wrong

46:47.720 --> 46:55.160
I understand that is that is content 101 you suck them in you give them a non answer and then you scroll away

46:55.560 --> 47:01.880
No one has time to be angry because your attention span is already gone to the next video once you've finished it

47:02.200 --> 47:07.320
Agencies hate her for this one simple trick. She actually tells the behind the scenes

47:07.880 --> 47:09.480
um

47:09.480 --> 47:15.000
Like I my I sent the short girl. I'm not gonna say her name until like I know all is good

47:15.000 --> 47:18.120
And she's fine if I mentioned her name being my editor T

47:18.840 --> 47:25.480
My not my editor being my clip clip editor that I commissioned. I she doesn't belong to me

47:25.560 --> 47:29.160
Okay, she doesn't belong to me, but she's I think she's Australian actually

47:29.640 --> 47:31.000
um

47:31.000 --> 47:34.520
Not me sending messages at 4 a.m. So, uh, anyway

47:35.160 --> 47:36.760
No, um

47:36.760 --> 47:38.840
You play it safe. Well, they get it. Yeah

47:39.160 --> 47:43.800
And before my like straightforward shorts flop, but if I did an edging

47:44.280 --> 47:48.920
Uh one where I'm like, I don't tell the tell the full story. It gets like a cabillion views

47:49.000 --> 47:50.600
I can see that happening

47:50.600 --> 47:55.480
But yes, I actually need to borrow Azura's voice because I'm going to get her to do a

47:56.440 --> 47:58.440
How much do veiler

47:58.520 --> 48:04.520
Uh models cost. Actually, there's this really popular sound right now and it goes. Let's go gambling

48:06.040 --> 48:08.040
Oh dang it

48:08.040 --> 48:08.920
Oh dang it

48:08.920 --> 48:15.720
And I was gonna do that about opening up a VJ for agency and it's just like bank account goes down artists over deadline

48:16.360 --> 48:18.360
everything pushed to the day before debut

48:20.040 --> 48:27.320
Unlimited unlimited stress unending stress like that kind of thing. Um, but I need to make it. Yeah, they're like, oh dang it

48:27.800 --> 48:31.800
Oh, I was gonna do that and like a really quick breakdown of what it was like

48:32.600 --> 48:33.720
um

48:33.720 --> 48:40.360
But yeah, I was one of them have a commission done in having a commission done on time impossible literally

48:41.080 --> 48:43.480
There's like this jigsaw meme where it's like

48:44.040 --> 48:48.120
Uh and for your last challenge have your girl go and it's like, oh hell nah jigsaw

48:48.680 --> 48:55.720
Um literally that but for artists complete your complete your uh commission on time even though you've been given ample time

48:56.360 --> 49:00.280
Sorry, but I cannot tell you I feel like I have been very fair with what uh

49:00.920 --> 49:04.520
Timelines I have given people and like nothing happened. I'm going to lie

49:07.160 --> 49:08.040
Oh

49:08.040 --> 49:11.800
Forgive me reflands. I do love a good run in a ramble. I really do

49:12.280 --> 49:18.200
Um unlimited stress. Well, literally if you ever want to be stressed fucking open up a VJ for agency

49:18.280 --> 49:20.280
It is the perfect

49:20.520 --> 49:22.520
Perfect amount of stress

49:22.520 --> 49:27.160
You could do that self-deprecating applying a corporal short with be allure is jackpot. It's true ready

49:28.120 --> 49:30.120
Um

49:31.480 --> 49:33.480
Yeah, I

49:33.800 --> 49:37.240
Oh, maybe I should do like controversial ones on purpose where it's like

49:37.880 --> 49:39.960
It's like we want to burn the yacht

49:40.120 --> 49:45.720
We want earth like I want to see girls actually get money that they're given like I want them to have good cuts

49:46.280 --> 49:50.840
But then I feel like everyone will be like and you just hate bg sandy. No, I don't hate bg sandy

49:51.320 --> 49:54.840
I hate corporate greed. You are you are crossing the lines

49:55.800 --> 50:02.200
Sistens you are crossing the lines. We don't like corporation greed out here. That's it. That's literally it

50:02.440 --> 50:04.760
I love the insider. Yeah, I think it's terrible. I know

50:06.040 --> 50:10.520
Since that you could use a massage. Are you offering refland? Hmm. Are you offering?

50:11.880 --> 50:18.600
I have just clocked your fucking profile picture. It's a refling with ryan gosselin in the picture. That is hilarious

50:18.920 --> 50:23.160
I've changed my setup so I can see you guys better without my glasses on

50:23.720 --> 50:27.480
Um, so I can actually see your profile pictures now like I can see

50:28.200 --> 50:30.200
um

50:30.440 --> 50:34.120
Like what your profile picture consists of a lot easier now. Yeah, he drives by the way

50:34.840 --> 50:41.480
We don't like the yacht man in the end part. No, like I understand business is business. Don't get me wrong, but

50:42.440 --> 50:45.880
um, I think with how personal and

50:46.760 --> 50:48.360
kind of non-tracks

50:48.360 --> 50:51.000
Transactional streaming should be like

50:51.560 --> 50:57.320
You know how like I always get sensationalized that like this girl demanded from her viewers

50:57.400 --> 51:02.680
That they give her a five dollar sub and she says they're all cheap asses and all that kind of thing

51:03.400 --> 51:05.400
um

51:05.640 --> 51:07.640
type idea

51:08.040 --> 51:09.880
um

51:09.880 --> 51:13.000
Like it shouldn't feel that transactional

51:13.240 --> 51:17.560
But when you have a corporation behind it that makes that transaction

51:18.120 --> 51:23.880
So apparent that releases their stock that releases public notes about meetings and all of that

51:23.960 --> 51:24.840
I'm like

51:24.840 --> 51:27.640
Mate you're just asking for trouble. Like I don't know if legally

51:28.040 --> 51:31.160
Japanese countries. Sorry. I really struggled to say that there

51:31.560 --> 51:35.240
Uh, Japanese countries like have to release these insider notes or something

51:35.320 --> 51:41.080
But what's going on and what's with these claims that like they're hiring 16 year olds for their pr team or something

51:41.080 --> 51:48.120
Like I don't know what is going on. I probably shouldn't even talk about it because I'm not educated enough to talk about it

51:48.600 --> 51:55.960
Um, and I will acknowledge like hey, I'm not educated. Like I probably shouldn't be but like the you know, you know

51:56.920 --> 51:58.440
you know

51:58.440 --> 52:05.000
Um, it's a smash and grip if I'm am I mistaken in saying there's a new hollow live branch coming

52:05.560 --> 52:09.480
Uh, but they were like forced to interact with the male hollow live branch already

52:10.440 --> 52:13.880
Japanese laws are messed up. They always favor the corporal. Hmm

52:16.920 --> 52:23.000
Yes, I think the rise of content creation owned agencies is definitely swapping in

52:24.600 --> 52:26.120
Um

52:26.120 --> 52:30.040
Debut tomorrow, I think really that's fantastic. I wish them well

52:30.920 --> 52:33.400
Uh, there's no reason to believe they were forced to

52:34.600 --> 52:36.600
I thought they I thought yeah

52:36.760 --> 52:38.760
Oh

52:39.880 --> 52:41.880
Well, uh

52:42.040 --> 52:44.040
Curious curious if they weren't forced to

52:44.920 --> 52:46.920
Of course, I don't know about that

52:47.000 --> 52:52.760
I have reason to suspect that not all their tweets are their own tweets. Um

52:55.320 --> 52:58.280
So I actually wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even them

52:59.160 --> 53:01.720
Because uh, depending on how generic the tweet is

53:02.280 --> 53:09.400
Me I'm not I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. I feel like that curate. Mmm. Oh Hannah. Yeah jigsaw. I see two again

53:09.800 --> 53:11.800
That's it. That's the meme

53:12.280 --> 53:16.840
There's a lot of stuff related to japanese corporate structure and how they do things. Oh my god. I

53:17.560 --> 53:20.840
Do you guys ever watch like paulo in japan?

53:21.480 --> 53:26.520
He does like behind the scenes of what it's like to work in like japan and oh my god

53:27.880 --> 53:29.880
Oh my god

53:30.200 --> 53:36.040
These people do not even have time to breathe and the drink culture is so heavy as well

53:36.360 --> 53:40.280
Like if you don't go out drinking with your co-workers after like a 12 hour day

53:40.920 --> 53:42.280
um

53:42.280 --> 53:49.320
A 10 foil scrawny. No, it's not. It's real. It's documented. This is it's actually documented and you can access information at any point

53:49.400 --> 53:50.440
tee he

53:50.440 --> 53:51.240
um

53:51.240 --> 53:55.160
Literally like if you don't go out drinking with your workmates after a 12 hour shift

53:55.400 --> 53:59.240
You're considered to be like a bad sport. You're not a team player

53:59.640 --> 54:07.320
At least youtube won't ban. Oh, right. Oh, okay. Okay. Remember that time I breathed into the microphone and I got a warning for it

54:07.640 --> 54:09.720
good times

54:09.720 --> 54:13.640
That was such a I'm sorry. All I'm gonna say is that video would have went viral

54:14.120 --> 54:17.560
I would have got a cheeky 40k views on that video if it was left off

54:17.640 --> 54:21.880
That's all I'm saying because everyone would have been like what's going on here. Oh, hey, yeah, jigsaw. Bye

54:23.000 --> 54:26.200
Don't even get me started. I started as a um a beachy fan

54:27.000 --> 54:31.800
So literally every corporate beach where I watch save for one leave in the company because of stuff going on

54:32.520 --> 54:39.560
Yeah, no way. There's a lot of unspoken rules in etiquette. So that's absurd would um, we don't oh, no, I don't want to oh, no

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
I'm too late. It's too late

54:43.160 --> 54:45.480
Ah, it's too late. I got 30k bomb feels good, man

54:46.040 --> 54:50.680
I would want to live in japan, but the work attitude would perish me. Yeah working yourself to death

54:51.160 --> 54:57.240
Is quite literally a thing for corporate. Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't relate to that. I want to retire in hobbiton

54:57.880 --> 54:59.800
I want to tend to

54:59.800 --> 55:06.200
Me flowers. I want to tend to my veggie patch. I want a lovely hearth in the evening when it's cold

55:06.520 --> 55:09.880
I want to let the fire warm up the room and

55:11.000 --> 55:12.920
You know have some cheese

55:12.920 --> 55:19.880
and meat and crackers and fall asleep in my little lounging chair in front of the fire then giggle when I wake up and like

55:19.880 --> 55:24.360
Okay, I should probably go to bed now and then I stuff out the fire like that that's

55:24.920 --> 55:30.520
This is what I if you ever get asked. Oh, what's your ideal job and then you go

55:30.840 --> 55:32.840
I do not dream of labor

55:33.000 --> 55:39.160
That is 100 percent valid and please do not think you are weird otherwise for not naturally

55:39.800 --> 55:48.040
Gravitating towards one specific job. It I have terrible news. You're actually not hardwired to want to do something like that

55:48.760 --> 55:55.480
Um, you I don't know if there's evidence for crop hardwiring because of you know about a full crop is

55:56.120 --> 55:58.120
You know good for you these bots coming in

55:59.000 --> 56:01.400
They kind of look like bots. I ain't going away

56:03.720 --> 56:11.960
A full pantry and a full belly and off to snooze land ago that this is what oh, sorry

56:12.120 --> 56:15.240
This is what I long for a simple life truly

56:15.800 --> 56:23.560
These are all bots or altkins for smithing. Oh, there must be a smithing mine. Oh, wait, there's a furnace right there. I see

56:25.720 --> 56:27.720
Uh a full womb

56:29.400 --> 56:33.160
Base give me the simplest job possible and I can forget about it when it's done

56:33.800 --> 56:36.600
Literally, um, like I've kind of said this

56:36.680 --> 56:42.120
I think I'm gonna get into we like ASMR pop-up shop or angle back into education and all of that

56:42.680 --> 56:45.480
Because like I don't dream of doing nothing

56:45.800 --> 56:50.440
But you know if you're able to remove the stress of like, oh my god, I don't have enough money to pay bills

56:51.080 --> 56:51.800
like

56:51.800 --> 56:52.680
Bruv

56:52.680 --> 56:56.440
You're on cloud nine like imagine just being able to completely

56:57.160 --> 57:02.360
Like understand that you can walk away from your job at any time like if you get treated like shit

57:02.680 --> 57:05.880
Who benefits who benefits from poverty?

57:06.760 --> 57:12.360
Business owners because people will put up with shitty conditions people will put up with overworking themselves

57:12.440 --> 57:17.400
People will put up with workplace abuse, which is rife across the board actually

57:18.120 --> 57:22.280
The bullying doesn't stop at high school. It does not stop at high school

57:22.600 --> 57:26.200
Workplace isolation slash bullying is very much a thing

57:26.600 --> 57:31.960
Um, so do not ever be embarrassed if you are ever a victim to it. Don't ever think oh, we're all adults now

57:31.960 --> 57:37.400
I shouldn't have to go through this. You're right. You actually shouldn't but some people never age never

57:37.960 --> 57:39.160
mature

57:39.160 --> 57:42.920
past that high school mentality of you're slightly different from me

57:43.240 --> 57:45.960
I will treat you differently because of that aspect

57:46.280 --> 57:52.200
I feel I feel uncomfortable because you're different from my persp- persp- perspec-

57:53.240 --> 57:54.920
of normal

57:54.920 --> 57:56.520
like

57:56.520 --> 58:01.240
Money doesn't buy happiness, but cover poverty causes the depression poverty

58:02.120 --> 58:07.960
Poverty begets poverty as well as the system putting place up against you. So like that fucking

58:09.240 --> 58:13.080
Where's that tinfoil hat? Oh, I could actually go on one. Um

58:14.680 --> 58:18.600
Yeah, like did you know they also set the fuel prices for regions?

58:18.680 --> 58:23.720
Did you know they purposefully set the fuel price in american region higher than they do for your

58:24.040 --> 58:31.480
Europe they came together in a council to do this. This is public accessible knowledge like poverty begets poverty

58:31.960 --> 58:33.960
If you don't have a car in america

58:33.960 --> 58:35.240
Fuck you

58:35.240 --> 58:42.120
You can't go anywhere because they don't even have uh, how you call them. I think you guys say sidewalks

58:42.280 --> 58:44.280
There's not even pathing

58:44.280 --> 58:50.360
There's not even pathing to walk to work if you so desired and we're so lucky to even actually that reminds me

58:50.360 --> 58:52.200
I saw a video of this guy

58:52.200 --> 58:58.360
Whose house was right across from his work and he chose to drive to work because he couldn't get

58:59.000 --> 59:04.040
He couldn't physically there was no intersection. There was no traffic lights. There was no way across

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
We live in a society

59:07.960 --> 59:14.920
I can't believe that every runescape stream just turns into me complaining about society. Oh, but strongy strongy. What's your solution?

59:15.400 --> 59:17.400
What's my solution?

59:18.040 --> 59:20.040
My solution

59:20.280 --> 59:22.280
You ain't gonna like it

59:22.360 --> 59:25.640
No one's gonna like it because I actually don't have a solution

59:25.960 --> 59:30.600
The thing is we have a disease on our hands

59:32.920 --> 59:34.920
And we have to treat the symptoms

59:36.600 --> 59:42.120
But how on earth do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?

59:44.360 --> 59:50.440
How do you tackle the symptoms on a disease that does not want to be cured?

59:50.520 --> 59:53.000
There is a patient in the bed right now

59:53.800 --> 59:55.800
That is resisting

59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.760
Every single ounce of medication you could possibly administer to them

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.320
You have a syringe

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.800
They move out the way

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800
of that syringe

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.880
You try to put in

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.920
You try to give them a tablet they cough it up behind your back because the string

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.960
Because you can't be watching them. You don't have the power to watch them for 24 hours

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.040
You need to go do stuff. You know

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.240
You try to put an ointment on their back

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.880
It gets wiped off

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.320
It's allowed to stay for a couple of minutes, but the ointment is wiped off the patient remains sick

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.960
The symptoms are present. The disease is still there. How do you treat that?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.280
We don't know

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.680
strongy bringing the tin foil. Is it tin foil time?

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.080
For now

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.080
Veiler will do its best

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.040
That's what sectioning is for

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.280
There's a very famous ultra corporal bro that graduated from my uni made as

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.920
Very needed medicine go from like 25 to 1k. Yes

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.560
I am loving the success stories

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.600
I believe there is a pharmacy that is currently on the rise in america

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600
I cannot for the life of me remember it

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.760
But they publicly said our markup is like I think 10 us dollars whatever you purchase

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.920
We make a 10 us dollar profit on that's it

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.800
That's all we ask that covers the infrastructure that covers the insurance that covers the business that covers

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.680
Everything of our business. We have a markup of 10 dollars. I cannot remember. Oh shit. Did I get an xp bomb?

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.480
Ah, sorry too busy running again

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.640
Uh

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.880
44 000 xp bomb. Wow. We're almost at 80 feels good, man

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.360
Insulin yes the patent for insulin

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.080
The gentleman that created it

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.160
I I apologize his name evades me at this moment in time

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:01.560
The gentleman sold the patent for one dollar because he believed it should be in the hands of the people if you have type

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.080
One diabetes you were born insulin

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
Resistant you can't do a thing about it

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.360
You rely on insulin if you are type 2 you can reverse this through diet exercise change

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.520
But you must be incredibly careful and use your doctor's advice in order to um

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.520
In order to revert the effects that type 2 diabetes has caused

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But insulin patent was sold at one dollar and now is an astronomical fee

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.760
I have heard of horror stories of people passing away

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.480
No one in my opinion should pass away

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.240
for

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.120
Diseases um that are out with their control. What do you mean? I believe in health care for all. Oh, is that controversial?

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.200
Yeah, relax. I grew up in scotland

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.680
Medicine is free if you didn't know medicine and health care is free in scotland

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.440
um

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.080
But think about the odds exactly. Um, I actually uh almost

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.440
that

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.400
I may have almost broken the law twice in australia already

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:09.640
Excuse me for being a a bad girl. That's right. I'm a bad girl. You want to hear my bad girl story?

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.200
I

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.880
may or may not have had to get medicine just for a few things or another like beta block or that kind of stuff from my heart

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.360
um and

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.760
In scotland you do not pay for your medications. You go to the pharmacy

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.880
You hand over your prescription and you walk away with it

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.680
I

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.680
I think I may have already told this story

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:40.520
The look of horror on and shock on the man that was serving me when I started to put the medication in my backpack

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:49.000
He he couldn't even get any words out because he had never seen such blatant theft before and I was like

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.720
Do we have to pay that? I was like like do the australians pay

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.720
for medication

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.560
and he was like

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.520
Yeah, you need to go over there and pay for it and I'm like

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.680
Oh

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.360
Sorry, uh

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.160
In scotland, it's free and like he laughed it off

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.960
But like the look in his face was like

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.200
And then I also did it twice

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.200
And another pharmacy, so I'm probably on a list to be honest

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.600
I started walking out the shop and I'm like wait

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.160
Wait a minute because like I could see the receptionist looking at receptionist the cashier looking at me

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:34.200
Like with eyes open. I'm like I had to like fucking go up to the desk. I'm so sorry. I'm scottish everything's free in scotland

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.800
I feel like repeat and then they always like they're like wait what all medication is free. I'm like, yeah asthma free

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.760
Asthma pump. No, you don't get asthma for free asthma and healer is free

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.240
Insulin is free. You need iron. You got iron deficiency free if on prescription

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.600
You need vitamin deficiency free on prescription like

01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.520
All of it free and everyone is always so surprised whenever I explain that I'm like it's free everything's free

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.640
If you're born with ailments ailments or experiencing illness, it's free

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.120
You shouldn't have to pay to make yourself healthier or to make yourself at the optimum that your body can handle

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:19.000
Some folk come out a bit messed up. That's okay. Here's some stuff that'll help you get through the day

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.920
You know, some people aren't built for you know a classic nine to five

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.160
Some people are built for being a nice little cozy home bed because their body's all messed up and that's fine

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.280
That's just the way it is asthma for freak. No America's

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.440
America Australia's most wanted literally cannot stop thieving medication

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.520
You can't he stopped me man. Can he the actual can he stop me?

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.560
If you have to pay for anything at all it's usually a pittance to

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.000
Cute room. Oh, did I bring strong it was bragging about this mythical land of scotland?

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.360
Do you want to hear another mythical fact about scotland?

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.640
Our national animal is a unicorn

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.200
I'm an iron horn. Yeah, this isn't an iron horn

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.720
For scotland. Yeah

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.920
It's a unicorn. It literally is look up right now typing

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.560
Scotland's national animal and tell me it doesn't say unicorn

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.160
It's a unicorn made up country. It is a unicorn

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.920
Don't tell me I'm I'm not fibbing. It's a unicorn. Yeah

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.920
They are unicorns are quite name. Um

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.800
Our national flower is a thistle, which is a purple

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.120
Flower, it's a very unique looking flower. Um, it is spiky. So don't get too close to it. Um

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.600
I don't know

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.600
I assume the thistle has

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.200
Cross continents by now and you you guys have seen a thistle

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.680
Seeing unicorns is seeing unicorns as everyone is on the mushrooms

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.240
Bre

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.720
I don't know who decided that they're like, oh, we're gonna pull a little prank on them prank. I'm John

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.480
Made up animal for a made up country. No. Oh my god for real. I love scotland. Yes

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:14.840
You probably wouldn't think a magical horn to create your typically seen on children's lunchboxes, but it's true

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.320
The unicorn is the national animal. Yes. I'm I'm horn

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.880
It is true

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.000
I'm not telling fibbers. Okay. I'm not telling fibbers

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.800
prank I'm John. Oh, I love that prank. I'm John

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.800
When are you coming to uh, why are you combining dutch?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:37.080
Uh, when explaining is there German history in scotland? No, there's actually a lot of history between the netherlands and scotland

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:44.280
When it came to the cotton trade, um, if you ever have the pleasure of going to bruge, um

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.920
Do not be afraid to take the touristic boat canal rides

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:57.080
Um, they explain all these like cross-reference of history and apparently scotland and the netherlands were pretty hand-in-hand at one

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:02.680
Point which was really nice. Um, don't ask where the netherlands actually sourced the cotton from

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.720
Our bell jump for that matter. Um

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.440
But, uh, you know all went well, um

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.680
Hello, hi for anyone joining. I'm just going on another rant again about society

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.160
Hello about us living in a society

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:22.360
Also that I may or may not be a wanted criminal in Australia due to the fact I can't stop stealing medicine. Um

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960
Because it's really hard to

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.680
unlearn everything

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.480
And it's like hard to unlearn like oh wait medicine costs money. Oh dear

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.800
We don't ask those questions

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.800
English is a germanic language

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:44.280
Someone said netherlands sourced some and yeah, uh, does netherlands. Oh wait, of course. I'm german when I say that

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.960
netherlands mensen. Oh you praten netherlands for me

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.600
Wait, do you say yeah

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.760
No

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.760
Yes, yes

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.280
No, what's yes in dutch?

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.240
Pratic

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.320
My beloved is a kleptomaniac steals your boy cherry. What you gonna do about it, huh?

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.360
Oh, maybe we should have a thief design

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.480
Oh

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.280
That would be interesting

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.080
Um

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.280
English is in a language

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.840
It's three dialects in a trench coat honestly. This also is beautiful as a wild flower. Yeah

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.000
The cherry seed is it stealing if it's a willingly offer?

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.520
Boy cherry. I just love that term my boy cherry

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.000
My boy cherry. Oh, yeah, your boy cherry

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:46.280
Wait, what are you going to do when a five two scott breaks into your room asking for the boy cherry?

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.520
I

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Shawnee cut was wanted for

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:59.160
Wanted for 8.06k counts of ink theft. Honestly. I just give up damn straight

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.200
Damn straight. I've broken you well, even though I've not even gotten started

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.600
And you're right. Actually, I had the right to ace more clubs

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.360
Because I've left two girls on red, but no, I have ignorance out of me being a dumb dumb

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:22.840
Sorry, my boy cherry is with another woman. Sorry less. How dare you?

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.280
How dare you?

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Athernity

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.880
What are you doing? I'm curious. What are your thoughts on this return to the office?

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440
So office real estate

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.400
Um is a very competitive market

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.640
But if there's no value in an office, there can't be astronomical rental prices

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Wait, you mean the whole

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.440
Market is rigged even for offices as well because people would just say well if offices aren't needed anymore

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.680
Why not turn them into more homes?

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.120
Oh, wait a minute, but that would lower the demand

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.160
Uh the artificial inflated demand by the way, um

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.120
And this all come back to office people got a lick of freedom

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:20.520
Um people got a lick of freedom of what it's like to be able to have a decent work balance type thing

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.920
And when you give people too much freedom

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.240
Uh, they might just get cheeky and revolt and the last thing we want is a cheeky revolt. Um

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.080
So if everyone's topic of conversation is

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:42.200
We have to go back to work. That's the people distracted on this conversation for a while 91. I'm jealous. I'm not there yet

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.520
Well, scum ass

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.400
Proposterous, thank you for the 10 of 30. Um

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.600
But yes, if all if imagine right now that every office building

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:58.280
Um that you can think of is lying empty and dormant right now

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.400
Because everyone can work from home do it take now. Obviously, that's not how all offices work

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:10.920
But think of the real estate. I would you could probably argue office space may be even outweighs what uh

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.040
A living space like no, well, probably not like not actually but you know what I mean

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.520
Um, I think you need to log in and out to update the horrors

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.160
The high score. Oh, sorry

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.480
I read that's horoscope for some reason. I might want you to use that to

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.120
In doing the horoscope

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.520
Uh, god forbid the peasants revolting as elites can't cycle money between yourself. Well, wasn't there a recent?

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160
post that proved that um

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:44.200
The stock market the only way you can make money in the stock market is by doing daily trading type thing

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.840
Because everything is rigged already

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:54.840
Like I'm sorry. I've never trusted the stock market. I don't I look you can be a dumb woman doesn't know what she's talking about

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.480
Absolutely. Dumb woman does not know what she's talking about

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.360
Something about the stock market concept does not sit right with me

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Like it just

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:11.720
I can't make heads. I just something is not right call me bricks and mortar because like at least something

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.640
It's physical and attainable

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.840
Sun does not sit right with me with the stock market especially

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.920
After the what was it game stock shenanigans the people basically went

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.280
We see you hedge funds. How about we counteract this and then they locked it down

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.640
So wait a minute. We're not allowed to do free trading

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.800
The people are not allowed to participate in the trading

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.320
Like sorry if that's not evidence enough or doesn't at least have your spider senses going off

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.800
Like i'm sorry you're just asking for it

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.840
Like I understand like I think the 401k for americans is actually in the stock market

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.920
Um instead of like a pension pot. Now, don't get me wrong. Australia, uk all participate in that pension pot

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.440
Fucking scamas. Then you get me wrong any private pension fund again. Oh scamas. Then you get me wrong

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.280
I get it the world is rigged

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:08.600
But like saws there's no free trade if congress is losing money 401k is a scam stocks is just legal gamble

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080
Like i'm not being funny

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.480
um

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:19.320
When that game stop like let's go against the hedge funders like oh, this is abuse of the stock market

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.400
No, it's not it's the people

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:27.640
Um having a choice and the the choice was removed. So does that mean everything else is a scamas?

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:35.400
Most likely. I mean, I just can't trust it. I I can I can't I can't go after everything I witnessed during that

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.040
Little funny tee he let's go against the hedge funders

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.960
uh

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.080
like

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.640
You can't eat it like they blocked anyone from signing up you couldn't invest in it

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:52.360
So it had they forced it to crash again. They forced it to crash like no, it's not even tin foil

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440
It's documented in real time

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.480
Like the the evidence is there

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.280
I'm sorry. It's not even tin foil. Sorry. I can't put a tin foil hat on that one

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:12.120
There's something. No, right. There's something fishy. I get on my cuttlefish, but that smells no coming from me because something smells fishy

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And it's no this

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.680
No, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's evidence

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.400
And I'll wait until stormy hears about how the us can take away our freedom of speech during wartime

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.520
Oh, don't even get me started on like wars and all that stuff

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.840
Don't even get me that eat

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.760
How unbelievably sad wars are

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.920
um

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.720
What after what did they call it it's sheep leading lion

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.560
And I feel so sorry for like anyone that's even been roped into the like army and all that

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.680
Oh, that's another thing on population control

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.320
as well, um

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:59.320
You know who uh army sign-up rates of their lowest they've been because everyone is like so educated now

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.120
Who the fuck wants to die for the capitalist cog?

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.480
Ne one

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.680
Absolutely, ne one. So ne wonder your how your recruitment rates for the army are as low as piss

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.200
But when you make people desperate enough for money

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.960
Um i.e. getting them born into poverty cycle getting them like down on their luck like having to tolerate all these like

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.840
Crappy jobs having to pay these bills that are extortionate and aren't officially inflated and all that

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.720
Uh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a few more army sign-ups because people are literally like homeless type shit

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.800
They don't have a choice type shit, you know and how unbelievably profitable it is. Oh my god

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040
Like it's just

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.360
Oh, that's good enough bread to migrate to australia to join your farm eventually

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.240
Enjoy the rain. Oh, no, we're going back to sculling for the farm. Sorry. I'm in australia for business means

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.640
Uh, but once the business wraps up

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.560
Uh, do not start a business in the uk you get absolutely taxed and you hardly get in and good going for you

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.680
Uh, australia though poggers start business in australia

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:13.320
Uh, but thank you so much tiny spiny for the tip. Uh, yes, please do. I am playing with mercy later

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:20.920
Um, scottish farm. Yes scottish farm the army. Oh, if you can join the army, you can retire for 30. No, you cannot. No

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.040
um

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.040
Like it's just no it's just

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.040
It's just no and i can't but i can't believe i'm going absolutely mental

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.320
I just feel sorry, but anyway migration to sculling got it. Yeah, it's actually really easy to migrate to sculling

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160
Broly legend

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.840
I did it

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.080
Not my rant making your hour of work super easy to get by that's hilarious

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.280
I'm glad that my little rants can do so

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.880
Right, maybe I should focus on cute v-tubers instead of the revolution that i'm secretly planning behind the scenes

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.840
What's that? You thought the siren wanted to drown you? No

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.720
I wanted to make you

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.640
influenced

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:11.320
And then we revolt. No, we don't revolt. We just make a little farm and live a good life. Sorry. It's it's

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.080
I don't want to stress you out any more than you have to be a little reefling

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.840
So let's let's just have a nice little farm together

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.040
We have a beautiful horse that we can enjoy

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.600
We have

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:31.880
Food the food is stocked in the pantry. We have all my freeze-dried fruit that last 20 years in case the collapse of society occurs

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.760
We have our little bug out bags

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.000
um

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.360
And during the day we go harvest and chop down trees so we can keep the heating on

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.640
And uh, yeah

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:51.320
Let loose the dogs of war. I'm ready my siren queen. Oh, yes. Yes, of course the farm. Yes. Yes

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960
like yes

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:59.960
Valor is a company of peace the rev one message the revolution begins here the next message

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.960
We are reefling valor is a company of peace. Yes

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.480
The revolution section will not be live stream. No

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.280
It will not the revolution

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.920
It started all because I wasn't allowed to

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.160
clap my

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.560
Do clapping ASMR without my hands

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.560
Smile

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.360
That's that was the final straw that broke the camel's back

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.320
Making a little farm under

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.480
Capitalism is considered insurgents, but don't worry. We already have to fight for the cause

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.520
Do you guys did you guys ever read pig farm?

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.240
um

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.240
It was about how

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.440
It's really like it's really depressing and dystopian

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.640
But it was about how the people like seized the means of productions and worked for themselves and it was bliss

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.960
Now say it again for the people in the back strong. Oh

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.160
Bless the shimei. Thank you for the 20

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.120
Look, I'm only allowed to go on a little tinfoil rant for like maybe five minutes at a time

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.120
And then I'm not allowed to do it any further

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.800
um

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.600
But okay, so animal farm long and short

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.280
Instead of that. It's very fantasy based. So instead or well fantasy based

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:16.280
The animals on the farm revolt against the farmer and then they run the farm

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
But lo and behold

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:25.480
Someone cannot help themselves to just start making ranks and be a higher level and get special treatment and

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.320
um

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.720
The end of the book basically goes

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.280
um, the higher animals

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.720
um, we're no different than the men that once

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.280
um, like uh

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:45.720
You know ruled them as like a thingy. It just it's so depressing, but I love depressing endings. I'm sorry

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.840
1984 had my head like I was in a vice reading that book

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.480
I could not get away spoilers mate. The book's been out for how long

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:03.560
Is is big george orwell still with us? No, I don't even think orwell is still breathing unfortunately because he

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440
is an old man

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.400
Is orwell still breathing?

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:17.480
Yeah, 1984 had me in a vice grip orwell has passed. Yes, I do believe the gentleman has passed um

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080
and like

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.000
It's just crazy the comparisons

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:32.600
Especially actually, you know what one of the biggest hints should be if any book gets subdued publicly at any point in any country

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.720
Especially any book that gets subdued in like russia for example china for example

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.200
Pay extra heat to that book

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.840
1984 was banned in certain countries

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.320
Um, and if you read it, it is mortifying. Um when you start connecting some of the dots now. Don't get me wrong

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.760
It's just a book

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.360
But at the same time

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.280
Reflings at the same time as I make my countless wines

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.640
It is more than just a book. What's your favorite dystopian novel?

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.040
Oh, I think I'm gonna have to be basic and say 1984 like I was

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:14.920
Hooked on that book when I started it. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I did read fahrenheit

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:22.120
I enjoyed it. I fahrenheit. I get it. I'm I believe in it. I do get I do get um

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240
Stay away

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.560
Uh

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.000
I have to say 1984 was a warning news as the blueprint

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.480
Yes, like I don't want to get too crazy on you. It's like I know I'm a wee bit crazy

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:40.360
But I didn't want to get too crazy. Like I you know, I'm still memeing away on ASMR and that like then I get too

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.680
Don't get scared to me. I promise. I'm not gonna uh

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.200
You know hypnotize you so we take down black rock

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.240
um

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.640
But yes, uh 1984 was published in 1949 an animal form with 1945. Yes, it's quite

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.840
scary the contrast

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:04.680
Uh that or the um similarities that you can pull from a book

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.440
from

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.800
X many years ago. Um and then

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.120
you know

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.120
You know, you know, you know

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.680
It's stroney getting crazy as hot though

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:24.600
Stroney, have you read pendulum? I have not read full cults pendulum. I don't have time to read books

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:30.120
I'm trying to get through the handmaiden's tale because I see it referenced everywhere and I'm like, what's this book even about?

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:38.600
I've only got a few chapters in but I don't have time to read books. It's so annoying unless like we play an audio book together

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.920
whilst I do rinse game

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:47.320
Leveling up in a past life. I was so close to buy a farm in honor of some radishes

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.520
Unfortunately, I lost my bid but I'm still aiming for the dream wait for really

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.560
We're gonna get a farm or you need to make sure it's not too unmanageable though farms can get a hand quick

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800
Pentium. Thank you for the tip

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.520
Frickin stroney me to chat. I mean sometimes are you allowed to do that?

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.280
um

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.560
Who would have thought the anti capitals revolution would be led by an anime girl literally

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.440
I'm uh, uh, definitely need to give needy streamer

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.440
I watched the god ending on needy streamer

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.480
But she was like we need to take down 10 percent of the population wrong. We need to take down

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.800
Unless that 10 percent of the population

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.800
No, there's no way it's 10 percent. It's like 0.1 percent that pulls all the strings

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.880
Must be

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.760
It cannot be it cannot be that higher percentage of 10 percent. All right and needy streamer

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.880
She was like, yeah, let's just call 10 percent of the population is like, oh sit down there. I'm not sure I can get behind that one

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.880
Uh 10 percent would take out a lot percent anything

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.360
wink wink

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.520
It's 1 percent. It's the one but is it really that high? I don't think

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:05.960
For those who pull the strings. I feel like one percent is so high and in an eight billion population

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320
Or do you mean it's the one percent?

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.000
Ah, okay. Okay. I understand. Sorry. Uh, yes

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.040
you know

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:22.680
See if she came out with that rhetoric, I would be giggling in my seat. No, I do not actually believe we should be

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.240
Um

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:34.120
Tally whacking people at will. No, that's absolutely not what I'm saying. Relax reeflings. We're not that serious about it

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:41.320
It's just um, it's a very how do you treat the symptoms of a disease that does not want to be cured and will do everything

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:47.240
And it's will not to be cured and actually does everything in its will to get sicker and sicker

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.080
and that's why 1984 was actually so, um

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.440
Shawnee making wines with the grapes of wrath honestly, um

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.560
Um

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.560
Shawnee if you stop at pull the strings

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.160
It just goes to their friend who are willing to take over got cleared the entire

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.480
Hedge growth not a branch. Oh steady. You can't be talking to me like that reefling. You'll turn me on

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760
Stop um

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:20.120
Yes, what do you do about a patient that wants to get sicker and sicker and lets themselves get sicker and sicker

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.320
The thing about 1984

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.240
was

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.240
the people

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.320
outnumber

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.880
The bigger uppers if you will buy an extortionate amount

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.960
And the book basically was like the uprise is coming the uprise is coming the uprise is coming

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.360
But the uprise never came because they dealt with it as problems occurred

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:51.400
Obviously now that was very think police stop police. There is a game called we happy few

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.160
I feel like if I ever booted up the game we happy few

01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.480
I would need to shove that tinfoil hat on before the stream even started because I don't know what to expect from it

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.720
But from what of herge

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.400
it is

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.400
kind of like that

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.800
Gotta get all the heads off of hydra. I wish all the string pullers are very

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.520
Adri chrome shortage

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.080
Adrena chrome source

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.880
I don't even know what that one is instant heart attack

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.200
Like if the death note was like a thing honestly

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.960
Honestly, I wonder like just oh no, they had a heart attack because they're old. Oh no

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960
We Flynn you can't say that

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.440
She lacks critical information. I actually do for once we well always let's be honest

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:47.240
We have few gameplay mids, but the story is so the gameplay is bad, but the story is good curious

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.040
Curious, we might give it a shot. How what does if you type in we happy few how long play time?

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.040
What does it say? How many hours does it say?

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.680

We had so we happy few so buggy. It had such a good premise though

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:14.840
Actually, I might play a ridiculous game with you. It's an orwell game or well inspired game

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.040
It's a tech space game. I might get mercy on it if I'm allowed

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.920
Because I know she likes kind of clicker games that don't

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.720
Because of our emotion sickness and all that. I might get merch you to play out and be a

I think are we redirecting into sheebie or is a is a zura coming on?

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.920

Is she not a nightmare?

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.200
Wait, she's supposed to do little nightmares at 10 a.m

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.680
She says she's doing little night nightmares, but I don't see the stream. Is she not put up a thing?

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.240
Is she not putting up her her wee lobbies?

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:10.040
If if uh, we will redirect into a zura's

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.080

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:19.080
Little nightmares in t-minus four hours and 30 minutes. We're gonna do wine for four hours 30 minutes

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.320
She be she be starts. Oh, she's starting a bit later. That's fine. Um

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.480
I am not going to redirect into emmers out of

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.160
Um

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:37.720
Respect because she's doing a collab with an outside person. I'm actually not familiar with them. So I should I should get to know

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:42.840
I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to like have mental capacity to be like, oh, is that friend of

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:48.040
Thingy's right. Okay, right. This is their details. Like this is their design. This is how they sound like type thing

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.720
Well, like I'm trying to give a mental note

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:55.320
So like the girl it's like I know about the girl's friends and you know, um, and they're all having a good time, which is good

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:01.240
Um the veal or a tentacle spreading. She hasn't put the weight in room up Danny to put it up for her

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:20.840
Uh, hold on. I'm gonna see if I can get her thumbnail and put it up. Oh no, I can't on this freaking computer gosh darn it

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.160
Oh

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320
I don't have access to her thumbnails either

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.680
Ah

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.680
Azura

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.920
I can't put Azura's chat up for her either

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.640
Unless I unless I go and make a cup of tea

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:41.880
I can go put up Azura's weight in room for her

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:48.200
I mean, I assume she's okay. She's just forgotten to put everything up. Has she been putting them up like on the day of

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.760
Because you're supposed to she was supposed to put full week up

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.200
Um, like the management like makes all the thumbnails and that for the girls

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.400
So all they have to do is put the room up

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.040
Try to make it as least stressful as possible. Yeah, she be is playing inscription today

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:15.560
Never gonna get a massive wine xp draw. Oh, I mean we popped on a we popped on 79 as well

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:19.160
Like it's not I'm just getting distracted. Okay. I'm not gonna be

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:27.480
She was very sleepy yesterday to be honest. Okay. Okay. Um

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.920
Right she be doing inscription. I think Azura normally puts the week but the past few days should be a little rough

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:42.920
We finally figured out what a fucking pc problem was thank god because spent a pretty penny on that pc. Um

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.560
Ah

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.360
But it's still not resolved, but we know what the problem is at least or I think

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.160
I think maybe I might be resolved soon again

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.600
But it means um her streams will no longer cut off in the middle of the stream where she disappears for a couple of minutes

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.720
Once she fixes the problem thank yad

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.120
Um, I don't want to embarrass her by saying what the problem was

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.240
But dear lord Azura

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.480
You're playing with fire

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:19.640
Yeah, and she doesn't sleep well well. Have you ever watched friendly jordies?

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.520
Yes, I watched his video where the politician

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.640
Uh did a pipe bomb in his house

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.000
And he sent one of his goons to put a pipe bomb in front of his house and burn it down

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.000
Uh, and thank god he was on tour because that's an ambassador

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.960
Did she watch naughty stuff on the side what?

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.360
No, she didn't no, um

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:56.600
If she's I don't know if she's comfortable with me saying it because um, it's not like mean or anything

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.560
Um

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.480

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.160
I don't know if it's an image. It would market promo

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.040
I don't know if it's an image or not and the computer's gonna see it or not or

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.920
Oh my god, wait, does it not see it?

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:05.160
Oh my god, check me out professional strummer. Can you guys even read that? I feel like it's so tiny

I don't even think you can read make it a bit bigger

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.280
Yeah, I can't even fucking read it the tape. I know the text is so small. Wait. How did the girls have on display then?

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.640
Even market

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:44.360
Uh, I've got my hoodie and my key chains on the way. I'm so happy

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:52.280
And then I can do my little hand cam stream. Well, it's just gonna have to be tiny and down there. I know you can't read it. Um

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.840
I might edit that so it just says merch

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.520
Oh my god, I can see it. Yeah, because that make it massive in the middle of the screen

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.480
Yeah, you want me to impede the gameplay with it? Sure

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760
um

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.600
I can only read merch. Yeah, I think I'll I'll edit it so it only says merch

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.640
Because that's the uwu. I think people are starting to recognize uwu market

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:25.560
It's pretty hand-in-hand with v-tubers at this point. They give it edit the text and paint. Oh, no, that's not gonna work

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.600
I would have to like craft it into a gif as well

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.760
I'm terrible

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.120

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.120
For level 81

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.280
We're in the 80s

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400
Yeah, we can recognize the symbol. Yes

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.760
I will edit that but oh my gosh, look how professional I am. I actually have like a little merch window

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.960
To be like, oh you can you could support my merchandise

You can wear the hoodie that I'm wearing

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.400
Well, not right now because I don't have my hoodie yet, but we can wear the same design together

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.440
Yeah, no, we can't sacrifice 100% high octane high quality. Captivating gameplay exactly

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.920
Next level you can cook turtles. I don't think I want to cook a turtle. That's not very nice

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.440
I would assume people know how to look in the description at this point. Yes. Oh my god

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:31.960
Bring comfort to people naturally and like they feel comfortable enough like the Vietnamese lady that I tipped

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.120
She gave me a hug and she was like come back any time because I tipped her and all that

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.800
Like I think maybe I just exude like that kind of hang in folk where they're like, I just feel so comfortable around you

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.800
And I was like, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.360
Shawnee's very squishable, literally. Um, like because I got Christmas

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.880
um

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.880
chocolates for chinese auntie

01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.600
And she was like, oh, thank you so much. Um, and she like gave me wine back and all that and I'm like, oh, thank you

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.400
Um

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.800
But like she always looks at she feeds me well though

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.080
Like I'm not being funny whenever chinese auntie clocks me

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.000
She always like fills up the food extra and gives me like extra things away

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.040
With friends like these

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.040
Squishy that uh that you do it's because you treat people like humans

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.520
God we are absolutely waning it up in this place. She's slow. Oh shit. How did you even tail all that?

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.600
You've paired. Oh my god. You put it in. Anyone got a spear jar going?

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.120
Um

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.120
chinese auntie fill it up mommy. Oh

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.880
It's literally she feeds me so much and she gives me a discount and she gives me extra food

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360
Like just to look after me

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.040
And I'm like, bro. I'm sorry, but everyone's like so lovely

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.000
Um

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.320
Everyone's so lovely in australia. I've never had one bad interaction. Actually, I tell you I had one bad interaction in australia

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.400
Tell jeff over there. Hey, um, I'm sure it was just like a long bad day. Um

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.360
But um in the uk when you use your card

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600
It does not ask for a prompt

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:21.160
To take it from your savings account a debit account or something like that

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.040
For some reason when you use a card in australia

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.560
It gives a prompt and it's like take the money out of these three areas and I'm like, but it's a debit card

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.560
It can only come out of one area

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:37.800
And and basically I was holding up the till and um, I asked her I was like, I'm so sorry

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.320
But what does this mean like, um, this is just a debit account the money's in the account what one day I hit

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:48.040
Um, and like she did explain it to me with like a big huff and a size type thing

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.240
Um, and I was just like, I'm really sorry, but in scotland

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.480
We don't have anything like that. You just use your card and then she like can't not pass

01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.640
I guess it was passive aggressively. She was like, well, you're no in scotland anymore. Are you and I was like, oh, okay, um

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:07.720
But I'm sure it was just a bad day and she was overworked like give people the benefit of the doubt empathy

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.400
Get be empathetic. Exactly. Oh my god. I wanted to do an empathy stream

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:17.320
Empathy this is a perfect example. Someone made a snarky remark towards me

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.000
How can we be empathetic to someone that may have said something that was a bit of a negative experience?

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:29.480
To show empathy we think to ourselves. Well, this person's working odds are minimum wage. They're exhausted

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:35.160
They most likely have a family issues going on behind the scenes. They've probably not been well rested

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.160
Um, so their filter to be polite had gone for that moment

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:45.320
If only for a moment we give someone the benefit of the doubt and we practice empathy. Whoa, just like that

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.040
Cut their brake tyres

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:55.320
Steady on maybe that's not rather empathetic of you, but we will try our best to be more empathetic to situations like this

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.560
um

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.160
Shout out to chinese aunties

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.280
There's this old chinese woman that owns her shop down the road and work and she brings me free stuff whenever I have a bad day

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:11.480
Literally chinese aunties look after you so selflessly and she works so hard. Like I absolutely adore my auntie. Um

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.280
Like we're on a first name basis and everything and I don't know when our birthday is and all that but I should maybe ask

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.440
I can get her something nice

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.800
Talking about that if you ever go to a convention in real life, would you be comfortable hugging the refunds? Oh my god? Yeah

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.320
I'm sorry. I don't know why people would be

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.840
Uncomfortable. I mean, I guess I'm just maybe I'm naive. Let me be naive. I'm sorry, but

01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.960
Let me be naive. Let me enjoy

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:46.040
Reflings at a convention. Let me hump them. That's all I'm saying. I'll have security. I'll handle

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:51.160
I'll hire the security guard. So if things get out of hand, I'll be like no, no, but I'm gonna be honest

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.840
Um, I did get a bit of feedback where folk were like I'd be too

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.720
I'd be too scared to like look her in the eyes if you're too scared to look me in the eyes

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.480
I feel like my voice is going to be like a thum in Skyrim and if I say it right back off

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.680
Like everyone's gonna be like whoo because you're not used to me being like

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:16.280
Like expressing negative emotions that you need to back off right now. I'm being serious

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.680
Like I feel like everyone would be like, oh

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.560
Did anyone a deal with strong a like that?

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.120
um

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.560
I heard all of them. Well, I don't know what convention we could possibly go to but um

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:34.200
I contact a little bit of naïve. He goes a long way. Oh my girl

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.920
Well, all of my girlfriends have been long distance, which means I've always been at risk of organ traffic

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.960
Stereo and let's like keep our organs intact

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:48.680
As much as living with one kidney is possible. It does put down your function down a little bit. Oh, sorry

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.720
Um

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.760
Yes yell at me more sexy squash woman

01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.680
I don't even know about being scared but physical contact with a bunch of strangers seems like an easy way it gets like

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:04.760
I mean I'd have hand sanitizer with me as long as no one's like

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.720
I bet you someone would take it a contest being like this streamer hates the reeflings because she has hand sanitizer

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.040
It's like no motherfucker. I want to stream when I get back home

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I want to stream

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.280
I don't want to be sick

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:24.680
So I need to use hand sanitizer whilst we're all touching each other not like that

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.880
When we hold hands and stuff and like do high fives and hugs or whatever

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:36.440
Oh my god, should for like the severely tism should I get a little chart for you so you can point on the chart?

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.360
What interaction you want from me?

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.360
So the first one's like a high five

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:46.360
The second one is hold your hand. The third one is a hug and then the fourth one is me sitting on you

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.280
Should I do that? So for those of you who struggle to speak

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.600
To whammy don't worry. I got you covered. I'm one of the bros for one and two

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.400
I've got a little pictorial chart so you just point to what interaction you want nice and simple

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:03.560
See you don't even have to talk if you're too shy that you can't get words out or you have a starter

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.800
I got you covered man

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.000
Oh, it'd be a big poster board for what we're wanting

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.880
I'd bring a sign saying strongy. Please great me bruv. I think they'd take that sign off you

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.840
I'm pretty sure conventions take signs off of people

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:24.600
Um, which I didn't know about they also take away like fake weaponry if it doesn't have the orange tip on the weapon

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.600
um

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.240
Yeah points at high five and nods like oh, yeah

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.160
Secret hidden minis like no, no

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.520
Uh, I don't think we're getting the ASMR booth rip rip and piss you shan't be missed

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:46.680
Oh my god, I'm gonna have to get nice and fit for the the convention me and I work on my glutes make them even bigger for you

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:54.120
Different con different rules. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. Mommy is so thoughtful. Hmm

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.160
I know some people seem to like struggle with whammy, but like didn't struggle with me like then yeah

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.800
You didn't have to worry about me me. Uh, should you I'm as brain dead as you are if anything

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.360
I'm actually more brain dead. You're smarter than me. So you really shouldn't have to be worried

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.600
Uh

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.120
If I met you in real life, I'd go feel scott's and only you'd understand might probably

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.440
No, the refland you guys have been learning my scottish accent very well

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560
You guys have been getting used to

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.560
um

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:29.880
Like I was eating my burger and someone pointed out I said canny passively like I've I don't know if you've noticed

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.120
I've slowly been slipping into using a tiny bit more scottish slang

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.200
Just because uh, you guys are getting used to it. So I don't really feel forced to like

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.160
I don't know

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:49.160
Annunciate my words more like I've been a bit more mumbly in recent streams because that's kind of where I naturally lie

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.720
um

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.080
Line-up reflings mean to help mommy with her squats, honestly

01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:01.960
I'm fairly expecting my boss to ask me. What is what's for that scottish accent a refling message with that?

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.480
They were like

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.720
They were working and they spoke at their work

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360
um, and uh

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.440
basically

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.800
um

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.800
Long story short

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:18.360
Uh, they've been developing an accent because they've been like mimicking because you mimic what you hear

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:22.280
It's very natural to mimic what you hear. It's completely natural. Don't ever be embarrassed

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.360
and

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.840
Passport bros like that. What's a passport bro?

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.920
Like that accent passport bros like that accent

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:35.160
I'm so sorry. I don't know what that terminology is. Are you teaching me something new refling?

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.040
A passport bro

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.640
I've been using me haps unironically. Yes, it's happening

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.120
me haps

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.600
Would you kindly a passport bro is a person that marries women from overseas?

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.160
A passport was when you move to a foreign country and find a more traditional way

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.080
She doesn't know a passport bro passport where men who look for women overseas. Oh

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:08.680
Like 90 day fiance as a retail worker one of my most memorable moments was when some lady apologized for her friends

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.440
Ridiculously insulting attitude when she didn't like my answer

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:18.520
Thank you to anyone with even a minuscule amount of empathy. Oh, I know I'm a miss. Thank you for the tip

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.840
I'm sorry. You had to experience that bra

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:26.520
I'm literally always on the side of like the fucking retail worker. I'm

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:34.520
Maybe because you know I worked as a waitress. Um, but like it's freaking terrible like with some of the stuff you have to go through

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:38.760
I am very lucky. I was in a tourist cafe

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:44.520
Which meant I had a lot of um people who were you know, having a good time. Um,

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Didn't really have any issues. I was just looking for the authentic like Scottish experience type thing

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:55.720
With the the food on the menu and that so there really was no issues. Um

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.320
I actually can hardly think of one really bad experience. I had

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:08.760
Essentially an American Karen, but it honestly wasn't that bad. So in American table culture

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.760
the

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:12.760
waitresses I believe

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:18.840
Make money via tips so they want to serve as much tables as possible to make as much tips as possible

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:26.120
So I think once you're finished eating they give you the bill and spank your butt and out you go in the UK

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:31.480
um, if you're a patron, um, it is very common just to sit and enjoy

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:38.280
Your lovely jubbly meal. Um, you can sit and digest for a little bit and continue the conversation with your party members

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.280
Um, unfortunately, we did have a an American family come in

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:50.600
peak peak tourist season, uh, no reservation had uh walked on by and came on in and

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:56.200
We very we I say we because um, I had to get boss man in on it

01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:01.640
We very politely had to explain bro. We are fully booked. Uh, we have tables out the wazoo

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:09.800
Um, if you just take a left down the street, you will find tons of cafes that have much bigger capacity type thing

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.920
Um, I'd love to debate strongy. Good because I'd like to master debate you. Thank you. Thank you

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.600
Yes, um and

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:23.240
basically

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.640
She in front of guests

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:32.120
It's pointed at them pointed at guests at table and said their plates are empty. We want a seat there

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.920
And I was like, oh

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:41.720
This is a culture clash because one that's highly inappropriate and two that is highly inappropriate and three that's highly inappropriate

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:47.880
Um, and basically obviously we're like, yeah, we don't have capacity like off your pop

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:53.080
And um, and she went somewhere else that was like for in terms of Karen's story. Yeah

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.320
I really ain't that bad. I really ain't that bad

01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:00.760
This is why I'm going to be late for work tomorrow despite working from home

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:05.240
Wait, do you need to go to sleep? If anyone needs to go to sleep, please rest well

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.000
I believe she be and eme are about to go live eme is doing a wonderful wonderful collab with someone

01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:17.640
Unfortunately, I forgot the name on please apologies. Um, and she be is going live with inscription

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:20.120
Um, a little card based her base

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.080
Thinking my barber

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:32.200
There was that fort folk out. I want to eat it was very like, oh, this is definitely a culture clash because that is like you cannot do that

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:33.640
and

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:39.720
You cannot be pointing around at people's empty plates demanding that we kick them out in quotation marks

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.680
So you can get a seat. Yeah, I don't want like that. She be has delayed until a later time

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.160
That is not my time zone. So that is

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.840
Emme isn't live for another two hours. She be is delayed. Okay. There are harem

01:54:53.400 --> 01:55:00.200
Harem on standby harem. Don't worry. You don't have to be on copium for long. It's one hour. She's asking for one hour. Okay

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:08.280
Once she be goes live, I'll take a break question mark and I'll go get a tea question mark and some snacks question mark

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.840
um

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.560
Yeah, that sounds rude doing that is the fastest way to get thrown out of an establishment in the cobs called

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:22.040
Thankfully, I have never ever been in a situation where like police had to get involved

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440
um, the weirdest situation

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.320
Doing a tango or having a square

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:31.480
the weirdest situation ever was

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.240
um

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:33.960
so

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.400
um a member of staff overheard this table

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:41.960
Talking to amongst themselves that they were going to skip on paying the bill

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:46.360
Like they were going to do a runner. I think it's called dine and dash as the terminology

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.560
Doesn't listen to her huff that copium. It's going to be a one hour. You can hold on for one hour

01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:55.560
Or here. I'm sorry. You can hold on for one hour here

01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:59.480
You've held on for longer for she be okay. Um

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:06.760
Uh, basically overheard someone do a dine and dash. So then someone had to fucking guard the door

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.360
Um in order to prevent them from doing that and paying and they looked so sheepish

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.400
Like when they were paying they looked so scared

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:21.320
So I think they genuinely were going to do it. They were just idiots and said the crime part out loud for some reason

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.600
Whoa that voice

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:31.880
Uh, yeah, don't don't ever say your crime out loud for some reason. I don't know why people think that's okay

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.480
Um

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.920
Yes, sorry, I got just I'm I'm reading the replies on my my little mean uh

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.520
My little mean post on twitter and I'm giggling away on my head

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.440
I am I'm so funny. I'm so humorous sometimes

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.600
Boss mom stroney prepares everyone for the girls looks like mommy you should play bread and fred for a collab. What the heck is bread and fred?

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.440
Unless your name's fred. I ain't getting bread in this scenario

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.640
What's bread and fred? Is it like a joe? Must be a joe

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.840
Don't say it alone. Don't record it

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.120
I suck on blue

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.600
We're officially on

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:21.480
53,000

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:28.120
Wines surely this is not going to get tedious. Um next week. We are doing uh endurance runescape

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.040
We are doing the full john wick series in order to save my voice

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.200
um

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.880
because

01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:42.920
Yeah, we're basically i'm gonna mute the game and you're just gonna hear my mouse and my reaction to the movie um

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.080
Because i'm needing i'm needing a bit of a break

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:53.720
But i'm needing to make progress towards cooking because we've not made the best amount of progress we're on the 21st

01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:57.320
Oh, I should have an audio coming out. What today?

01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.840
I have an audio coming out tomorrow on patreon

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.040
I can't remember the plot though. Oh

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.520
but

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.520
I

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.160
Can't is it is it blow bob?

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.080
I don't know what my plot is tomorrow

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:24.600
I forgot I forgot I can't remember. Um, we are going to write my fourth script together next week

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.680
Um, which is a honey tea plot, uh, honey ink tea plot

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.400
Yeah, we get to do it together. Um, so I'll I'll say what you want me to say

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.120
Yeah, we're gonna write it together in a member stream

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:45.560
Speaking of audios alt twitter audio is possibly my favorite thing right now feels good man feels good

01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:52.200
I go so freaking shy. I was so annoyed. Literally. I remember looking over the

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.760
I actually recorded it in obs which was dangerous. I shouldn't have but I did anyway

01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:02.920
Um, and I remember looking at the timer and it was like two minutes and 11 seconds and I was like

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:10.120
Bro the allegations that I'm a quick shot. This is getting a bit too much now. Um

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:16.440
I was like, oh, right. Okay. I'll keep going but then ended up getting shy

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:21.720
Which artificially extended the time feels good, man. So now I did a normal amount

01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.520
I'm so normal I'm a normal

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.320
There are no allegations

01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.280
But what about the noises

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:37.960
In the background. Oh, no, that's my chair. I did it in my chair. This one right here that I'm sitting in right now

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:43.320
That's what all the squeaking and all that was because I had both my legs up on the desk

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480
That's what all the squeaking was

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:49.640
my wee my wee gamer chair

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:52.040
I did it right here

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.440
Right here is where I did it

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920
I finished my stream

01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:59.320
I got my figurine

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:05.240
Uh looked up some absolutely devious plots and went to them

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:10.440
Is there proof on the chair? No, there's not proof on the chair

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.840
Uh

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:18.360
Although possibly there could have been now that I think about

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:24.680
But never use the pc that someone lives on at least not in keyboard and mouse

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.640
Yeah, you do not want to be touching anything of mine

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:35.000
I was actually gonna do a washing my keyboard asmr type thing because it's like absolutely filled with gunk

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.920
Washing my keyboard cleaning my keyboard asmr

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.920
How much for the chair

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.640
No, you're not getting this chair. It's had everything on it swear ink

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.680
most probably traces of

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:53.240
Uh

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:59.880
Um, I wouldn't be surprised because I like uh, just I never wear clothes. I'm wearing clothes because it's cold today, but

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.080
I really struggle

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:08.440
Why are you selling it to us? I'm not selling it. I'm keep it. I need a chair to sit on to stream on

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:16.040
Sorry, we already want the tree. You don't actually need to sell. Oh, should I bring it to the convention? Someone can just wheel it away

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.760
Yeah, no, that's gonna happen

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.160
Hi guys, everyone sniffing the seat

02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.080
50 cents to smith to sniff my chair

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:27.880
my gamer chair

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.160
You have us though. Oh

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.680
We'll be the chair. Okay. Okay. Maybe some of you guys are into chair stuff more than I thought

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:40.840
Hey, sorry. What is it furniture furniture? Is that furniture your bank?

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:43.880
Any furniture your bankers

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.840
You're naughty naughty boys, right

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.400
Stranny you can sell the seat and just cut it into a small piece and sell it. Uh

02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.600
Put on a wee keychain

02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:01.960
I am a throne feels good. Yeah, sorry

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.480
What was that about chairs my face? Oh, okay. I get that I get that

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:13.480
Wow, we have 800 wine brewing. This is like the longest I've ever gone

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.040
I think I don't know what my biggest exp pop was or what it can go to but it looks like we're at 900

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.440
Unformented wine right now

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.400
Tag you're it tag you're it boom boom boom. We're at a

02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:36.520
Eight eight two. I don't know what that is. Did you get that chair oil?

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:39.960
Now it's still squeaky chair

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.640
I sent you some late reading on marshmallow. Oh, I actually no check marshmallow yet

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:51.960
Um, I cannot check marshmallow for the tame being

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:54.520
Oh, no

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:59.160
Oh, no, what does that mean sonic? I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have to be cryptic

02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:07.160
To have to have access to the marshmallow. Oh, no. Oh, no, I have to be cryptic. Oh, no

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.360
Anyway, about it. It's not a big deal

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.000
Um

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.520
But yes, again, thank you to any youtube clippers

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:25.720
You are making my job so much easier because I need to send clips on to johnny forgot her pass for the end along

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.800
Yeah

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:34.360
Um, I will right so she be comes up in 46 minutes

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.080
We'll get a break. I'll get a snack. I actually don't need to pee because I'm so severely dehydrated right now

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.880
Yep, eighties what it is

02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:53.560
What's the model of your keyboard? I'm so sorry. It just says corsair. I don't actually know what it is

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:58.360
It might be the Australian version. I didn't know that

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:05.560
British keyboards and Australian keyboards are different because there's a key binding that's in a different place or location

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.920
And I'm like, why why is it not universal?

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:16.760
So I might have an Australian corsair keyboard. Um, it lights up. That's all I know. I'm trying to look for a label on it

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.360
Oh, wait, I can turn it over. Hold on. I'm turning my keyboard over right now

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.880
Uh, hold on. I want to make sure I don't accidentally

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.720
De-wine myself, which is not what we're wanting to do

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.640
Hold on the keyboard has been turned over. I'm looking at spare bottom

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.520
the keyboard says

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:44.840
Corsair k70 rgb mk2 mechanical gaming keyboard. Is that what you wanted? Did I do it right?

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:49.080
That's surely what you wanted, right? That's surely what you needed the information you seek

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.360
Well

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.960
Uh, it does have a uk. Wait, is this a british keyboard or not?

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:00.280
Identify yourself. Are you a british keyboard? Did I bring you?

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.360
You british

02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.360
It says uk in canada

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:08.520
It says uk and c8. Okay. I think this is a british version of the corsair

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.880
Corsair is shit

02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.560
Okay, what do you want me to cry about it?

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:21.800
What was that? How is it bad? Am I being pepega? Why is it bad? It does what I need it to do

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:24.840
You don't know you just don't like it

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:27.800
Oh, did a mod tickle your message?

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.920
Get right

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:32.360
Get right

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.360
You can tell it's british if the keys are cr-

02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.360
A riflin

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:42.760
Riflin that's too funny. I can't even laugh at that

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.320
Riflin

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.360
That's terrible

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:58.040
Now you're fine. Well, I was the me that did it. I was the me that did that didn't mean I didn't remove your message

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:05.320
The british teeth humor and sham will stop because I've got messed up teeth. The allegations aren't looking good for me

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:10.840
I can't believe it. I can't believe I wasn't sponding with veneers attached

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.360
Um, oh, we should do the veneer ramble one day

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:22.040
When I say we should do the veneer rant one day, do I mean should I do it right now?

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:25.880
What happens if we go on the root canal rant? Oh

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:31.160
But wait, but I'm british so I'm not sure I can start on anyone's teeth to be honest

02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:37.640
I'm british you have no mercy. My favorite one is the fish

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:43.960
It's like a fish and it goes well at least our schools and then that's the meme. It just cuts off

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:50.120
There's nothing else to the meme. It's just like a fish. We're really messed up teeth and it goes well at least our schools

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:57.000
Um, I wonder if I can find it and put it on the screen. Oh, I don't think I have enough time to

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:00.520
Do my way. Oh god. I've already had a root canal

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.160
Oh

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:09.400
So root canal is has a very high success rate of failing

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:13.160
And if your tooth is at the point root canal is advised

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:17.080
You're probably better just getting it removed to be honest

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:19.960
um

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:29.320
I think I didn't understand anything the peeler allegation. Oh my god, merci freaking joined in the peeler allegations

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:34.520
I'm now giving shift the ice to zura because if a zura does it it's on me next

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.800
And I'm like, oh no

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.880
So it's on a zura the ball is in a zura's court

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.440
If a zura does it

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:51.080
Then unfortunately, I will not hold up the allegation. No, I will hold up the allegations and do my part

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:58.280
The last literally think of it like a rat a baton rally race. I think she be was first and then it went emmy

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:02.360
Then it went icy then now it's mercy

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:07.320
So the baton is is the baton has been extended to a zura

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:14.040
Will she pick up will she grab the baton and run to me is the question because this rally race is getting intense

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:19.000
It's getting a bit. I'm getting nervous. This rally race looks like it might actually we might actually win

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:26.760
Strongly needs soon. Well, if we were gonna do it, I was I was thinking I would purposefully

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:32.680
Hydrate as much as possible and like hold it in while we do a stream type thing and then afterwards

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:34.920
all of it

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.920
Every last drop in 4k

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.120
I mean, I could even get my 3d o over that's how

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:46.600
Um, like because I have a task cam that feeds into the 3d o so I can you know if you wanted to hear it

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:50.680
By neural I could like flip the mic around was them doing it. Why not?

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.080
I

02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:58.040
Had to get oh, I can read that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry to go on. I don't know what you said, but it's already gone

02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:03.720
Huh, please don't give in the thought of you joining in on it is not good for my mental health

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.600
Wait, are women not allowed to pee?

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.440
Am I going crazy?

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.560
Does that make me

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:23.640
Yeah, I think you're crazy. I actually don't know the

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.800
I remember when I remember I remember when a reflin traded me

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.120
And he got really shot what

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:45.480
A reflin. I don't need any runescape money though. I have 22 million. I'll take it though. Don't get me wrong

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:47.560
I'll take it though, but refling

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:53.080
Oh, you're such a sugar daddy reflin. What the heck 82. Let's go

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.800

Reflin actual sugar. Oh my god. You bowed you gave me money and bowed

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:10.920

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.080
Not just some of it

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:15.720
I remember when

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.880
I remember when I

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.840
That's the work though

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:27.320
Yes, my goal was to get to 85. I think in the stream

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:32.040
Um, we do have time. I think we have time to get to 85

02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:35.240
in game fendom

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.320
Someone was like, are you gonna do fendom?

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.480
Oh

02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:46.120
That would literally do what emmy did. That's her injury. Oh was it. Thank you for a broly legend. Thank you for the five

Is that new? Oh, you are giving me more. Why do you want to give me more? Hold on

02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:02.280
I need clear some inventory via waning in order to do it. That stream was legendary

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:09.320
Well, she sent me a clip. She wanted highlight of it and it was one of you guys absolutely terrorizing her

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:14.600
Wait, why are you giving me more money? You've already given me some. I mean, I'll take it though, but

02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.600
Are you sure?

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.360
Thank you

I'll just have 25 million in the bank. I have all the wines I need to get to 99 and you're telling me women don't have it easier

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:41.160

Lamal

02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.480

Thank you very oh, I've just taken out. Oh

Wait more you're joking

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:54.680
You're joking

02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:02.680
No, no, I'm not accepting that. I am not accepting that. I don't care. I am not accepting that

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:09.560
No, you're not giving me 2 billion in game currency. I do not accept that's outrageous

02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.360
That is outrageous. You're not giving me 2 billion in game currency

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Value loss. Holy crap

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:19.880
2 billion

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.680
2 billion that's an oiler

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:29.960
What is your you've got construction 99. Are you laughing? Oh, no. Are you sad because I rejected your stats

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:36.920
2 billion. How long did that take you to even get? Eat the rich. Yeah, you're getting eaten out first bend over

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:40.040
2 million gp

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:44.840
Do you do like the arena gamble possibly?

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:49.480
Stroney's gonna single-handedly crash the runescape economy. I should

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:58.600
But now don't don't get me wrong. I love a cheeky bribe here and there 2 billion is outrageous

02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:03.800
It's a grievous amount of uh currency that I will never burn through

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.880
So I don't want to yank it gold digger would be an understatement

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.120
um

02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:13.480
I don't know at that point. It's like a planet made of gold

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.640
Extraction that's not even gold digging. That's insane

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:25.240
Per refling got rejected, but not in a bad way. Just in a do not give me that kind of money because I would never utilize it

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:27.640
Kind of way. There's no I wouldn't even know what to do with that

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.280
Fletching 99 question mark like that's probably it

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:39.960
Shawnee if you ever play Final Fantasy, I'll pay your sum. I don't know what Final Fantasy is about. I'm so sorry

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:47.560
It's a as right. Don't be mad when I say this out loud. Is it like World of Warcraft or am I mistaken?

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.040
Night name prayer and construction would be like one fourth of that

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:58.360
Uh, wouldn't 99 prayer be you guys running dragon bones to me?

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:02.040
Is that not how you're supposed to do it?

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.600
Is that not how night name prayer works in Rinscape that you guys run dragon bones to me to the altar?

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.920
And we and whoever perishes with it. We just accept it

02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:17.320
Shawnee join the peeler. I only need you and Azura. Then my collection will be complete

02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.960
The balls in Azura's court. I'm not kicking that ball

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.560
I'm not kicking that ball

02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:29.160
Um

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:31.160
It is in Azura's court

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:36.200
I will be the finishing seal. I will break the last seal if you will because

02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:39.640
Why I'm in love to go on about how don't break seal. Don't break seal

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:45.720
It's different from World of Warcraft and everywhere. Okay. It's a tap targeted MMO like well, but it's about

02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.320
Eh, I think it's a large Azura's last pick. Oh, did you see Azura's picture? Oh my god

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.560
It was so good

02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.920
How did I get so lucky with all these porters?

02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:00.840
Um

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:06.440
Yeah, if you haven't seen Azura's picture, uh, it's on our all-town of twitter right now. You're welcome to check it out

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.320

Absolutely. It's delicious

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.480
um

02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:16.680
Yeah, she bought thigh highs, but they hardly go up to her thighs. So

02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:19.640
she uh, really uh the

02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:24.040
It's really fit in the lore to be honest because Azura is really tall

02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.240
Wait, did you see Aisy's most recent picture?

02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.160

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:34.520

I was not going to take two billion. I would never even be able to do anything with it. Are you serious?

02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:45.000
So honey, you got to think like a capitalist to beat the capitalism

02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:52.040
What should we raise funds so we can bribe politicians to put in actual policies that are good for the people?

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.000
Whoa, no, you can't say such things

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.360
Whoa, should we become billionaires?

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.400
But rule the world forget

02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:06.440
And we'll destroy billionaires from the inside out. Is that how we should do everything?

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:12.280
And all started with a little are you giving me more money? Right? No more money. No more money after this

I don't have to pay for fuel

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:12.120

That is a very nasty price

02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:42.200
Nasty nasty nasty

02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.760
I used to ride a bike to and from work every day. It was amazing. Then I got COVID and didn't have the breath for it

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.800
I got COVID and it messed me up good

02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:59.320
Um as much as I would love to talk about the conspiracy series behind COVID. I can

02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:04.440
I can

02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:09.240
Um, but yeah, COVID absolutely got me in a chokehold. It was um not fun

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:13.240
Um, I was very ill and I was actually considering

02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:20.040
Calling the doctor to come out. Well, I don't know if they would call you'd call a doctor out for

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:24.200
COVID because then you could contaminate the doctor

02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.400
Um

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.400
But yeah, oh please don't remember Schumer's on

02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.360
Um, I had to I don't know if you guys remember this Australia shut down its borders

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:40.840
Um, and the requirement of getting into Australia was being vaccinated. Believe it or not. Do you remember? Um,

02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.960
No, Vak Djokovic the tennis player he got booted out the country

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.440
Um for no being vaccinated

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.520
But then it got leaked later whilst the whole country was in shutdown

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.680
That these tv stars were coming over to record a movie or something

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.160
Whilst like the entire country was in shutdown. So it was like, aye rules for us, but no for you

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.240
Classic, I mean the hand in the uk as well. They were was it?

02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:10.280
They were hosting like parties and Downing Street whilst they were telling the nation like don't go outside

02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:16.040
No, you're not allowed to go visit your past away family member at a funeral type thing. I was like

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:20.040
Talk about rules for you and no for me much

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.560
Yeah, I remember that. I don't know. I got it for like one day. You got one day or no

02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.360
COVID like absolutely decimated me. I was down and out on my arse for about a week

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:32.760
I remember on the worst day

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.680
I woke up and I said to myself if I even feel a

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.520
Fraction of a worse than I do right now like worse than I do right now

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:25.640
Did I even have a short stream coming up or am I fubbering up for the next few days?

02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:30.440
I think we might be having um

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.120
A few sleepless nights coming up

02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:38.600

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:43.160

Even I'm doing old school and then I'm playing. Oh, I actually have an announcement

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.520
um

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:52.840
I am not doing the uno collab

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:54.200
um

02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:59.400
She be because um, so originally the club actually didn't even have me in it in the uno collab

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:03.640
Um, she be was originally going to be in it, but her work clashed with it

02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:08.840
Um, so I stepped in um because it was supposed to be like kind of a we send off for em

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.920
Because she's about to go on holiday

02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:13.720
on holiday

02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:15.480
um

02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:20.120
Because I wanted um, you know embers to feel our love unanimously. Um

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:27.480
So she be is stepping in I am not doing that uno club. So I'm changing the schedule

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:31.000
I do have a member's ASMR stream, but I'm going to change it

02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:33.880
um

02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:36.120
I am going to play

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:37.160
Baltro

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:42.760
I think we'll do two hours of Baltro and then two hours of member stream ASMR. Um

02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:50.520
And then that four hour day will allow me to catch up on all my editing that I'm missing out upon

02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:57.000
Um, because yes, she just quit her in real life drop. Not streaming. Oh, did I say it the wrong way around? Sorry

02:30:57.640 --> 02:30:59.640
She be quit her in real life job

02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.360
Not valour

02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:09.080
Um, so she be is taking my spot in the uno club. So it is she be mersey emmy

02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:15.720
And azura together having fun shenanigans. Um, so please do look forward to that

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.360
Um, I will be doing a member's

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:23.320
stream

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:28.760
Which will be redirect remembers ASMR. Oh, did I redirect a hundred of members ASMR?

02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.760
Um

02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:35.000
Decisions decisions. I think I will because I don't think anyone sleeps during my ASMR

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Let's be honest. None of us are sleeping during it. Um

02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:43.480
I will redirect into them and you guys can watch them. I will then go and catch up on all my editing

02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:45.800
and

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:49.800
I'm really really excited for the ASMR stream. I don't even have anything planned for anything special

02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:55.640
It always turns into the same thing where we're being really inappropriate with one another, but I don't mind it. I like it

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.440
um

02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:01.240
Yeah

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:07.160
Very curious, very curious. Take care of the madness running. Actually your ASMR is the only ASMR that puts me out

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:10.680
Is it because my voice is so monotone naturally like

02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:15.880
Yeah, you like it. You're like a monotone voice. Oh, you feel so sleepy, don't you?

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:19.800
And sometimes my accent makes me say a funny word

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:26.360
And it's rather humorous, but yet you can't stop listening because it slowly brings you down

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:29.240
And to ever lie

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:37.480
Your eyes riefling your eyes they feel so heavy heavy heavy eyes

02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:43.880
But that's okay riefling. It's all gonna be okay. Just relax

02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:48.440
No, I'm not gonna put you to sleep right now, but

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.040
That is

02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:55.720
Yeah, like when you talk like that. Yeah tingle when you talk like that brain

02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:59.800
I like when you go between soft spoken and whispering. Hmm

02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:03.080
I I'm having a fun time

02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:09.960
Collabbing with other creators because I put in the script. Please whisper and then they do soft spoken and I'm like, ah

02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:17.000
Plus no cigar. I think I might need to make a little audio tutorial and be like, this is general talking

02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:19.400
This is

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:25.320
Soft whispering because you can actually still hear me. It's soft spoken. Sorry soft spoken is when you can still hear that

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:32.200
And the voice okay, and then whispering is when you're actually whispering and there's no grip to your voice because there's not enough

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:35.080
voice

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:37.320
Um

02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:39.560
Yeah, I've asked for people like please whisper through the script

02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:43.800
So I've recorded my lane's whispering and they've done it soft spoken even though I asked for whisper

02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:45.800
I'm like you goofy goober you

02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.120
yard

02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:51.880
The one thing I hated about the ASMR community is that people label stuff ASMR, but it's really audio

02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:53.080
Don't

02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:54.600
What do you mean?

02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:02.760
What my ASMR streams have me laughing because I stuck a stick up my nose and completely break any ASMR aspect of it

02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:06.280
What are we talking about? No

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:12.040
Yeah, it's me. It's me that abuses the ASMR tag

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:16.120
Sorry, I'll start naming my stuff not ASMR. Okay

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:25.160
Yeah, it's hilarious and cute. I sent a way to get clipped. I don't know if it's appropriate for if it will turn into a clip, but uh, yeah

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.240
At lol, I love the snores the ASMR snores

02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:32.600
Peppa pig

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:36.840
No, no, no, that's not what meant. Oh, did I misunderstand? Sorry, my apologies

02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:42.680
Most ASMRs put a lot of work into learning not to whisper because it's really bad for your vocal record me on the other hand

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.280
fuck them

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:50.920
Tear my vocal chords apart. I will do whatever makes you happy if my my whispering makes you happy

02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:54.520
I will whisper

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:56.040
I was fighting millennia

02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:57.880
Well, that was happening and it made me

02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:04.760
It made the fight impossible you giggling away at yourself ASMR not ASMR essentially. Yes. That's how I'm going to start labeling it

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:07.720
ASMR is just

02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:13.560
Shit wasn't time for scrawny honestly. I love a good ASMR meme. Sorry. I do I can't get away from it

02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.040
I love it. I'm so like I completely understand don't get me wrong

02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:23.560
I completely understand why that butt clapping video got taken down, but it was so fun

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:28.040
It was such a funny idea. You know what youtube

02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:29.560
a

02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:35.960
Five years ago or whatever four years ago three years ago. No, actually all this freaking breathing stuff is recent

02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.160
YouTube three months ago with a he-hod at that and then all of a sudden there's been the stealth update

02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:43.640
Breathing bad women breathing bad

02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:51.160
Afternoon strongy house cooking. We're cooking by via fermentation of wine. Um, we are just

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:54.360
um

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:59.000
We're level 82. I did want to become level 85

02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:04.840
The reeflings have completely stalked me out the wazoo for all the wine. I'm gonna actually need

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:09.080
I've got Gandalf over here. What's going on? Gandalf the yellow

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:12.600
Check it out. Oh, we got uh, no

02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.080
Oh, you're pimped out in a different costume

02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:18.120
I thought it was a new refund. You tricked me

02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:21.160
You tricked me. You look mildly different than before

02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:24.200
You must be a whole new person

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:31.000
At first I was a little disappointed at the meme ASMR, but whenever it's an ASMR is ASMR especially from strongy

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:37.240
Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't kind of like it. But I don't know. I just I just I like the non serious stuff, you know

02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:43.640
Like literally I have an ear cleaning ASMR and it starts with me going the std clinic is two doors down

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:49.400
And then you come in and it's actually you're getting your ears cleaned like I'm sorry. I love a little tea heat

02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:55.880
I love a little mischievousness a little bit of tomfoolery. I do I do. I love it. I can't help it

02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:01.560
Stronger your one k ramble ASMR is now my go-to for sleep. I'm glad you liked it

02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.680
That's what happens if I don't give myself a script. It just turns into an absolute mess

02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:09.480
Um, absolute mess. Um

02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:14.600
I just like start rantin about anything that comes into my head

02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:18.120
Fuck you

02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:21.240
No, I love all the ASMR's all of them. Oh feels good man

02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.520
Rip the video, but it was worth it. It was worth it. At least the audio's on patreon

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:28.840
Um

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.080
Uh, but yes, that is me

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:39.960
That's me take I'll at me means, but I do actually have some serious ASMR is coming out. Oh, I can't believe it

02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:46.760
I actually need to record tapping ASMR. We'll still have my my nails. Can you? Oh, yes

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:54.040
Oh, that's right. Tingle for me. Tingle for me, baby. Yeah, you're tingling all over aren't you? Yes

02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:56.040
Um

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:04.200
I actually need to record tingle ASMR tapping ASMR because I have my nails done which produces a really nice tapping sound

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.960
a live ASMR would be profit for clippers though

02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:12.360
I

02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:17.000
I went through my clips not many people are like clipping on youtube, which is perfect to find

02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:20.120
Please don't actually feel like you have to do it. But if you ever like watch

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.000
Um by like a like if you're watching a vod and you've found a funny moment

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:31.080
Like clip it because I can see it and then send it on to an editor. Hi we fling something smells fishy. It's me. I'm sorry

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.200
Oh, is it fire we fling over there?

02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.600
Sorry

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:42.680
Um, I literally cannot find the clip button. I do is it is it even on mobile phones?

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:47.800
On your wee iphone or your wee samsung or your wee

02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:49.480
uh

02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:51.480
I've forgotten the name of the chinese brand phone

02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:54.200
Clipping is a hassle live. Is it?

02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:01.560
There used to be a bunch of live ASMR videos and then youtube called them all. Yeah, I'm not surprised. I don't know what's

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:08.200
There's definitely a stealth thing like everyone's getting hit. I saw this other creator got hit with an ASMR thing recently as well

02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:10.440
And I'm like bruv. Sorry, but this is just too obvious

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:13.160
There's definitely been a stealth update

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:15.240
um

02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:18.440
And they're going buck wild for it because yeah

02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:22.520
Who are you? I think yeah, that seems like a who are you?

02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:25.480
It is the scissors above chat

02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:28.440
Scissors above chat the clip button is available on the phone

02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:32.440
But yeah, um

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:36.440
But don't be shy if you're ever watching a vod and you're like, oh that was mildly humorous and pro

02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:42.040
It could possibly be turned into a clip. Thank you. Please. Uh, let me who where what I can't say who I

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:44.680
who I

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.640
No fun allowed on youtube once again. I'll be surprised legit

02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.800
It used to be the wild west and as time progresses it just goes less

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:01.560
Also little annoying thing about the button if you join a stream

02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:06.680
Where you were there since the waiting and you won't have a clip on because it's dumb so refresh

02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:11.880
My only complaint. Sorry. My voice is starting to die. I think I need to get hydration shortly

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:19.240
Um, my only complaint with clips is that you can't share them anonymously your count is tight. Yes. I'm almost say that's also not

02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:24.520
A fun element in before I'm going to start noticing that the people are clipping

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:30.040
You're just called straw knees clipper straw knees clipper clipper of straw knee because you guys are making like side accounts to clip

02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:32.600
That would be cute

02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:41.080
So about the tingles them are gonna fuse kinst ones. Oh, yeah, you're gonna keep I cannot believe I defeated the boss

02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:44.040
in Legend of Zelda the first time

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.600
I thought we were in for a rage fest like I ate my burger. I stuffed it down my throat

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:57.160
I had my my cola on standby had some cheesy chips because I was like we're in for the long haul

02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:04.360
I suck at this and oh my gosh like the patience the timing like everything couldn't have gone better

02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.440
That was amazing. I was so happy with the results of that

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:16.360
A certified gamer moment. Vati isn't that hard? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't say that part out loud. Hold on a minute

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:22.280
Yeah, I I defeated the boss in one try. That's what you say. You don't say that the other part there

02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:29.480
Refling, let me place my fingers on your lips. Refling. Don't ever say that again out loud with such confidence

02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:33.720
Do I make myself clear the boss is hard? I defeated the boss in one. Okay

02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.360
I

02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:40.120
Watched the voice

02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:47.000
You did so well. Thank you so much. I adore that game. I really do. I have absolutely no idea where the missing hearts are

02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:56.200
Um, I I thought I could 100% it but now that the fail is like in the corrupted state of like everything is terrible

02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.560
Ah, yes Skyrim on legendary

02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:04.680
Look, I got a skyrim achievements to work. So I hope you're getting ready for some gamerscore collect in in july

02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:11.000
Um, I have a bit of a bit of news. So as you know, my dad is coming home. Um

02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:16.360
So I think my streams are gonna I can't believe I'm saying this

02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:20.440
I'm going to be doing uh in quotation marks

02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:23.720
regular stream of four hours

02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:26.120
Daily

02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.960
I probably can't go more than four hours without interrupting my dad. Um

02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:41.960
So I know it's shocking. It's truly it's regular stream. I can't it's mortifying news and all honesty

02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:44.680
Um, I'll see what my

02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:49.400
The situation when my dad is because he's wanting to like take me

02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:55.640
To like the shops and like go in like father daughter date type stuff because I've no seen him in a bit. Um

02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:01.160
Um, I'm getting I'm gonna take me to a petting zoo. I think

02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:07.560
Uh praying there's like actually animals there or it's just going to be like a goat in a field with like one of those like

02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.600
Put 50 cents in here and turn the style and feed the animal

02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:14.760
Can your stream addiction handle the it's going to be really weird

02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:22.600
Because like in the most respectful way like I'm just so used to like talking all day long to you reeflings

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.200
So the thought of being like, oh no, I'm actually time gated

02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.120
Like I I don't experience time gated like yesterday. I thought I was only going to stream for four hours

02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:38.120
It turned out to be nine because yeah, like I'm not time gated. Um

02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:43.080
Spend time with your dad. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for understanding. Um

02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:45.320
I

02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.440
It's gonna be weird

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:52.040
Like I need to pick out games that are short or games that can be done under eight hours because basically

02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:58.680
I want like if we do like four hours for the first stream then the other four to complete the game in the next one

02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:00.920
um

02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:02.920
Like it's gonna be weird

02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:06.360
You literally shoot him all the time. You think you're gonna accidentally talk to chat

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:11.480
What like when I'm talking to my dad? No, I'm gonna like show my dad everything. I'm going like these are the reeflings

02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:14.760
These are all the like fan arts that have made of me. Maybe not the other stuff

02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:19.960
Uh, this is like me and these are the girls and the girls will say hi and all that jazz

02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:25.320
Let's call the jury campaigns. We're pretty short. Oh, maybe maybe

02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:30.120
Make sure you pay a sheebie and a fondle in person for us

02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:38.440
I didn't realize if someone gifts mercy member like if someone does membership gifts on mercy stream

02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.160
The audio queue is me screaming fondle opism

02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:47.080
I like mercy. Where did you even grab that from?

02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:52.680
So, yeah, if you ever wanted to know what happens if you gift a membership on mercy stream

02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:54.760
It's just me going fondle opism

02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:56.440
Like

02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:00.600
She yanked I had no idea she did that. I must have tickled her pink

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:06.760
I didn't it tickled everyone pink. I didn't think the name was that bad. I thought it was funny

02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.760
Like oh, you're going to remember if a vtuber comes out and calls themselves fondle a bosom or you know, like

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:18.200
If I can only stream for four hours and who's going to yap to the reeflings for the other five

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:24.360
Literally, I'm like veal or girls girls besties. You're going to need to step up the reeflings are going to be uh needing

02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:26.120
A yap off

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:30.200
Okay, you all start better start yapping about your special interests to put them asleep

02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.960
They the reeflings cannot go to sleep unless they've heard of either one a capitalist rant

02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:38.520
Two a rant about some random subject that

02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:42.120
Reminded me of something because someone mentioned something really obtuse

02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:48.600
Um or some sort of like video game relation thing. Okay, so girls get on it. Uh, I'm sure they'll do just fine

02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:51.160
um

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:54.360
Yes, it's terrible, but it's absolutely hilarious. She's a memer too, you know

02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:57.240
listen first is a

02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:00.120
Family first, but you're my family reefling

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.120
It feels it feels horrible being pulled apart

02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:06.440
like but

02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:09.080
Still four hours. I think is more than adequate

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:11.080
Hopefully

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:16.840
Hopefully I don't have reefing I'm coping on now. There are times I will see what my dad's wanting to because there'll be days where

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.360
We don't go out and do anything. So I might be able to squeeze in a cheeky endurance here and there

02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:26.120
um

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:28.120
But I'll probably have to

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.160
Go and like talk to him or like five minute intervals at like every hour or something

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:38.280
Just so he's just so I'm I'm still here dad. I'm still here. I'm just yapping away

02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:40.200
uh

02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:46.280
Him listening to the absolute ridiculous conversations we get up to he'll be like what's been sest

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.840
What is bindo about you don't want to know dad? You don't want to know

02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:53.480
So

02:46:55.080 --> 02:47:00.200
I say that as if my dad isn't uh doesn't know about internet culture to be honest. So it doesn't really matter

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:02.600
It doesn't matter in the end. Um

02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.360
We need every five minutes of your dad because we need to thank him. Oh, no

02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:10.920
He's like insert legal name here and legal address kind of uh parent

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:17.000
So yeah, no not happening. Um, he might knock on door. He told me I was um

02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:20.120
What's that talking to him a wee bit ago?

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.440
Um, and he was like I might bang on the door just so you know, I'm awake and I'm like great

02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:28.680
So I get to have a heart attack and freak out. Sure. Give him a patreon subs

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:33.400
Meet that refund right there meet that refund right there. No

02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:35.640
um

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:41.720
No, he didn't he doesn't he doesn't know those kind of no, then he knows that um, you know a voice slag

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:48.520
Um and all that but no, uh, he no no, you know, you know, no none of that none of that

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:54.840
Uh, no, not that kind of path. No, he's not a step dad. Um, put it that way. He's not step dad. He's he's mad at

02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:56.440
mad at

02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:02.520
Um, but yes, I need to think of like shorter games. I think stray is probably going to be on the roster

02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:04.920
Um

02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:09.800
You're wrong for that one chief. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna you're you kind of wrong for that one

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:13.720
Um, like actual dad, but not a dad. I like I see

02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:19.000
Hope we get are you winning strongy? Oh, do you want him to do voice lines just for the hell of it?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:26.680
I was gonna see if I can do that halo playthrough with them, but I don't know if it's possible because

02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:30.520
Um

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:33.880
It's take it. I don't know if I could set them up on it or not

02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:37.080
I might just do like the classic interview

02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.000
Thing like if you guys have any questions for my dad because I'm sure when I was going to be like

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:46.040
What was it like that your daughter's a slag and then he goes well the house is paid off and I get to retire next year

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.000
So feels pretty good. And then it's like, oh, everyone gets rolled in smoke that has ever said anything nasty

02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:58.840
Um make it a video. Yes. I thought about doing like an interview video where it's like because vtubers make it such a big deal

02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:01.480
My parents know I'm a vtuber

02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:05.320
Like

02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:10.040
Would they not know that you work at Tescos as well? Am I missing some key elemental factor?

02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:13.640
Do your parents like not just you know

02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:21.000
Do your parents not root for you and everything you do like are they not in your corner being like? Yeah, that's amazing. Go strongy go

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.880
No

02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:26.920
Well, that's what I have anyway, so it's not it's never been like a

02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:34.120
Oh my god, my parents don't know what I'm doing. Please don't tell it. Well, of course my parents know what I'm doing

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:36.120
I'm having a fucking carry on

02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:40.520
Do you think if you think I can't stop yam to you guys I'd be telling everything

02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.400
My parents know every little detail

02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:48.120
Well, I tell you a secret

02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:52.600
A strongy mama strongy like she be

02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.760
I

02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:00.360
Mama strongy is a harem

02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:02.120
and

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:06.200
She really likes her voice and she finds her voice quite soothing

02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:09.720
And she's like oh, she has a really good voice really good voice. Yeah

02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:12.840
um

02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:19.400
She got on at me about emi's chest, so I don't talk to emi about I don't talk about emi to her

02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:25.080
Because she was like a strongy. I'm no sure about that and I'm like look mom

02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:28.520
Mom you have to understand

02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:31.640
Peytan is in Peytan stonks are in

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.520
What does dad think about she be?

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.720
I don't think dad really has much of an opinion. He doesn't really say much

02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:43.000
He like knows everyone's designs. I tell you what I'll get him to record his reaction to the designs

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.480
I could probably do that in the interview type thing with him

02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:51.160
And be like because I've told them countless times. I'm called strongy

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.840
He knows I'm called strongy

02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.960
And I know for a fact if I sit him down and record and be like name this feature bar he'll go

02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:00.760
um

02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:01.960
Oh

02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:03.960
And he can't come out of them

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:09.560
strongy's mum's a hates flies. No, she doesn't hate that she's flat

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:12.760
She dislikes the

02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:15.480
Young girl appearance

02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:19.800
Um of emi and she thought it was a bit messed up and I'm like like I can see it

02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:24.840
But I've been staring at icing emi for over a year now. It's just thing. I like it doesn't mean anything

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:29.320
Like I tried to be like well, it's just the opposite of a cleavage really

02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:33.320
It's just a concave chest because she's got nothing there and mum was named

02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:39.560
She was kind of seeing it and she was kind of no seeing it and she was like right as long as yous are all safe and happy

02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:43.400
That's all she's as long as yous are all safe and happy. That's my mum

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:47.160
The fact that it's a lollipop I

02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:49.960
aim my mum's

02:51:50.120 --> 02:51:54.120
Experience with like japanese and anime and that I forced her to watch kill the kill with me

02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:58.920
Which has a lot of fan service and she was like strongy. What is this fish and I'm like honestly

02:51:59.800 --> 02:52:03.640
It is actually quite embarrassing watching anime in front of your parents. So don't recommend that

02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:06.360
Oh

02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:13.080
Lollipop love everyone involved is an adult the end end of story. Yes, everyone is safe. Everyone is happy everyone

02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:17.960
Ah, yes, yeah kill kill son. I love kill kill

02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:23.080
There's a very good video game and kill kill

02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:27.800
I uh a fan game

02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.640
A fan game of kill kill

02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:35.080
And it is it is insane quality

02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:40.760
It's not a fighting game. No, um, we're a bit tied up in the game

02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:47.000
Is it by zone it might be because the quality was off the charts of the game

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:52.600
Like honestly like something the development team for the anime made themselves. I was like good. Oh, I know that one

02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:59.560
I used to go absolutely nuts for that. I cannot have countless times. I have spilled my ink to it

02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:01.960
It is a fantastic game

02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:08.040
Um, it's outrageous. I know but I don't care

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:17.560
Fun fact, bible black was my introduction. Have I seen that? I don't think I have

02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:21.080
My dad likes to watch anime with me sometimes the one he likes the most

02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:25.640
Was his high school at the dead. I wonder why oh, no, is it bad?

02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:31.400
Gaming bless your heart. I'm trying. I'm trying

02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:35.800
Oh, I know you mean gaming isn't it?

02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:43.000
Do you see yourself playing on elsewhere? Yeah. Um, there's this orc game that I'm absolutely tantalized by that

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.280
I've never played it. I absolutely want to do like a

02:53:47.400 --> 02:53:53.000
Type of like live like we play it and do stuff together live type of stream

02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:55.560
um

02:53:56.600 --> 02:54:00.760
Uh, my only issue

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:06.360
I wanted it to be free

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.400
But someone raised the issue

02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:22.040
That having it accessible like that negates the audios and I'm like, oh, well I kind of agree

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.920
Which is a bit shitty. I don't know what the solution is to that situation is

02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:33.240
I don't have a solution yet. I still have time july is kind of when it you know things start to break

02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:40.440
What do you mean by that? Um, so patreon's appeal is because you get very unique audios of scenarios

02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:43.320
um

02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:46.600
But I really don't want another subscription

02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:49.160
I

02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:53.080
Um, I don't want to charge anymore

02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:58.440
Because the fucking membership was one dollar more than I wanted it to be so I'm already raging at that

02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.920
And I don't have a solution yet. I don't have a

02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:06.040
How does it negate it?

02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:08.680
Because it's like here's free access

02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:11.320
to this content

02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:14.280
That arguably could be a lot better

02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.720
Um, because some people aren't into the audios for like the rp aspect

02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:23.480
And it's like well, you can

02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:25.480
you know

02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:31.080
It's uh, it's a bit tricky to navigate at this stage. I don't have a solution

02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:34.280
I don't have a

02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:36.280
finality either

02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360
I

02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.600
Cheap vods via subscription

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:46.440
Now vauding I might agree to a very small even if it's like a dollar

02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.360
I kid you not a dollar for vods. I think is agreeable

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.760
For the actual live stream. I think all you would have to do is follow

02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:59.080
And that's it. I'm quite happy with that solution. That might be the solution

02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:02.120
A dollar for vod access

02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:05.640
I think is fair

02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.120
And then free access to the actual live if you can get it in time

02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:14.120
If it's all strong even that punishes people that have worked that punishes people in this time

02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:17.240
Rob

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:22.680
Look at any other agency and be like, are you getting value for money compared to us? Yes or no

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:28.760
Please I am trying. I'm trying to make everyone happy. It is not possible. Please work with me

02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:35.080
Work with me. These girls need to move out. These girls need to eat these girls need to find success these girls

02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:36.760
You know

02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:38.760
Fucking give them your money

02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:46.520
Be nice to the girls. They're trying to achieve stuff. Okay. I've already got everything I need with my wiflings. Okay

02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.960
You'll be to watch small fee votes is a pretty common setup. Okay

02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:01.960
There's no perfect solution, but that is one. Yes, there is no perfect solution

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.840
In the wise words of captain

02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:12.120
I cannot remember his name of the star chick enterprise

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:19.160
Captain Picard you can do everything right and still it goes wrong or something like that. I can't remember

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.800
I don't see if it will affect patreon stuff. Okay. Well, hopefully it doesn't if it does then

02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:27.560
I

02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:32.200
Because um patron if you didn't know uh if you ever feel but oh, it's only five dollars

02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.680
And patreon statistically and very shortly should and will be the girl's biggest income source

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.040
Um very quickly. So don't be afraid to support mom patreon

02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:48.840
Uh undercut in the market undercut the market five dollars for four audios undercut in the market as well as access and archive to anything

02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:50.840
They produce on youtube. Yeah

02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:53.720
Okay

02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:59.880
Undercut the market. Um, yes, it should actually be their biggest income source. Um, that's the plan anyway

02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:02.040
It looks like it's actually happening. You know that

02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:04.040
and

02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:07.560
I can only speak for myself at this point

02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:11.560
But

02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:13.560
Yeah, my harry on

02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:19.960
Are you kidding me right now hit by the pope. I wanted to stay up for your stream since it starts at 2 a.m

02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:26.440
Here, but I ended up heaping out of comfort of your voice. Thank you for rambling. Thank you flaws for the super chat

02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:32.520
Are you got floppy as your profile picture? That's floppy, isn't it? It is. Um

02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:38.200
Thank you for the super chat and uh, please rest well unless you're up already

02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:40.600
You tried to stay up for the stream but passed out

02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:42.200
Oh

02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:44.200
We've got a thousand wines bomb

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:49.960
Flop a little big flop like who's gonna go. Hmm. Now that this free. I don't want to sell up on patreon hard

02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:52.600
You'd be surprised. Um

02:58:53.640 --> 02:58:57.400
Some of the patreon feedback is like that shit insane

02:58:57.480 --> 02:59:02.040
I could probably talk about it a bit more as time develops. I might even make a short out of it, honestly

02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:04.840
um, you would be surprised how

02:59:05.480 --> 02:59:11.720
People's like exit survey you can leave it if you leave someone's patreon. You can leave a message and it's like an exit survey

02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:14.680
You would be surprised on the reasons

02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:18.680
Why someone is like i'm no longer supporting you type thing

02:59:19.640 --> 02:59:22.440
My biggest problem is if I want to watch all the girls

02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:27.560
I don't have time to have to make sacrifices that I don't yet know if I am ready to make

02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:30.600
Oh, thank you our own reaper

02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:33.880
for the five and um

02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:37.800
Yeah the

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:45.000
Yeah, it's kind of hard to keep up with all the girls at once. Uh, definitely not that easy. Um

02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:49.400
But what was I saying? I've completely forgotten. No

02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:56.040
My brain's too small to do multiple things at once. Can I give an example an example of what i'm so sorry

02:59:56.040 --> 02:59:58.040
I've completely forgotten what I was talking about

02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:00.920
um

03:00:01.160 --> 03:00:03.160
I

03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:08.200
Hearing the girls are really happy about how they are doing. Hopefully they can all make their situation better. Yeah, like I think

03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:13.800
Emmy's want to move out. Aces want to move out. Azura's want to move out. Shuby's want to move out. Everyone's want to move out

03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:17.560
Uh mercy wants to move out because

03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:20.680
Her parents make it a nightmare to record

03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:24.120
I'm not even I'm not even gonna pretend

03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:26.840
It should be like oh my parents are up. Sorry

03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:31.160
No, that's fine. That's fine. Just leave it. Leave it last minute. It's fine. It doesn't make a difference

03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:33.800
Oh crazy

03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:39.320
Patreon feedback. Uh, yeah stuff like uh no longer want to support because

03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:42.200
um

03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:46.280
You made this one audio that I don't enjoy and it's like

03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:51.080
Now don't get me wrong

03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:53.400
Please don't ever feel forced to like throw your money at

03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:56.120
Creators if you genuinely don't enjoy what they put out

03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:02.600
But some of the stuff is like you made one audio. I do not like out of so many audios that you have made

03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:04.840
I am gone and it was like, okay

03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:10.120
Why would you even leave that in the feedback like don't be realistic? I don't know if it like you need to be told to your face

03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:14.680
There's no way in heck one creator can make something that you enjoy a hundred percent of the time

03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:21.880
Like as soon as I come out saying that I didn't mind sounding. Oh, oh, strongy bad. Oh, right. That's it. Get it out right now

03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:24.440
I've got straw. Um

03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:27.800
I'm teasing I'm teasing

03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:36.040
Uh five minutes and 56 seconds into the audio you made a mouth sound. I did not like honestly it can be like that

03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:40.520
Um, I'll definitely show some examples strongy's a bad girl

03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:46.840
Who made you listen to that audio like come on. Yes, it definitely feels a bit like

03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:48.440
I

03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:51.320
Don't know if people feel forced to put something

03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:55.400
I don't know how it looks when you like disengage from someone's patreon subscription

03:01:55.880 --> 03:01:58.920
But I don't know if people feel forced to put an answer down

03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:04.440
You do not have to put an answer down and insult the creator on the way out just uh, just a quick tip for you

03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:06.760
You know, you don't have to insult the creator on the way out

03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:10.680
Even though like you literally put your money where your mouth was and supported the creator like is

03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:15.960
I will definitely make a short about it and show some examples because it's uh rather humorous

03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040
It can be rather humorous

03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.640
Or when they make an assumption about everything you'll make in the future off of two posts

03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:26.360
Bruh, I felt so bad for she be

03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:36.040
I felt so bad for she be she was getting a bit of flak because the first audio just happened to be an s scenario

03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:39.480
And she made three

03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:43.960
d scenarios and one s and it was voted on the one s

03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:49.800
And she got so much flak and I'm like do I have to like come out and explain like how this works?

03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:52.040
like

03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:57.880
I am I am happy to say we do have a schedule that will be posted next month

03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:00.760
Where you can see what's coming up ahead

03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:03.800
So um, if you are on a monthly

03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.360
basis like you

03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:09.960
You sign up and then sign off again. You'll be able to see what's coming up

03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.520
I will try my best to put the tags, but I'm absolutely rubbish at making tags. I'm not used to it

03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:21.880
So it's hard to get used to it because I'm struggling me. I'm struggling. I'm not smart enough for this

03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:28.200
Okay, when this pops we're going to make a cup of tea and get some food in our belly because I'm getting a bit hungry

03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:34.680
Yeah, I think that would have changed the results. There is going to be that first plot d

03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:36.600
scenario

03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:37.640
I

03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:45.080
I just I didn't write it at the time because I at the point I had actually wrote 3d for her

03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:47.640
And then I was like, okay

03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:54.840
She needs one s at least and somehow you guys miraculously voted on the one s. I was literally the odds were what one in four

03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.320
But anyway, I thought it was really funny her first audio was sd

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.600
I mean you do have to remember

03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:06.040
Am I allowed to say that?

03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:08.040
No, maybe no

03:04:08.840 --> 03:04:12.440
Maybe another time. Have you thought about posting demos? Um

03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:20.600
No, um, I actually no, I don't mean this in a bad way. Please do not think I'm

03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:23.720
83

03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:25.560
That's fantastic

03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:31.320
Um, please do not think I am honing in on your comment. Um, even though I am responding to your question though

03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:34.280
I do not believe

03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:39.800
In the need this sounds terrible and I hope it doesn't come across as bad as it sounds

03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:44.840
I don't think a preview is needed for such a low

03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:53.800
Undercut of the market as well as you can try it for for you can trial it for five dollars

03:04:55.320 --> 03:04:58.360
You can trial it. You don't have to keep it on afterwards

03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:00.760
um

03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:09.800
I do under like and the girls already post stuff for free on the alt twitter like I feel like you get enough of a

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Situation of is this going to be worth it or not? And if it's not worth it

03:05:15.560 --> 03:05:21.320
Hopefully that fight, you know, you're not going to spend five dollars that you actually need like so

03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:23.560
It's kind of like

03:05:23.560 --> 03:05:25.080
It's not even a lose

03:05:25.080 --> 03:05:30.440
There's like no loss as well because you've actually directly supported the girl like that you've helped them like

03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:35.960
Move out. You've helped them maybe upgrade their equipment that um, they didn't want to ask management for

03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:38.440
isura

03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:43.720
Per isura. She was too shy to ask for a new iphone. So I had to buy her one like right before debut

03:05:44.920 --> 03:05:46.920
um

03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:50.600
But she got it so our iphone's all juicy as far as i'm aware

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:57.880
Is there a no yeah, it just seemed like there's a lot of extremes for the first people

03:05:58.600 --> 03:06:00.360
and

03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:02.600
I

03:06:02.600 --> 03:06:04.600
Actually can't make a comment

03:06:08.600 --> 03:06:11.800
I mean the first the first month is always chaos. Um

03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:17.480
People getting used to folk folk filtering themselves folk getting filtered like it's just the way it is

03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:20.760
Um, but like once things settle down, I mean

03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:24.520
I mean she I think I was in the the reef lines are all settled down

03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:29.480
Are we not like we're already jumping straight into endurance stream. We've got elden ring next week. Hello. No

03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:32.040
We've got elden ring in a couple of days like hello

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:37.480
Um, I'm ordering take away on elden ring day. Yeah, you don't have to tell me twice. I assure you

03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:39.560
um

03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:44.040
I will absolutely like I feel like we're we're settled and you guys already know where the start score is with me

03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:49.640
Um, you know, you have to let the girls cook a little bit, you know, let them get comfy and all that jazz

03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:56.360
You're gonna catch she be stream. Oh she'd be live anything for any harem members. Sheepster's live mercy collab

03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:01.160
Uh, see you in the mercy collab. Yes, I will see you in the mercy club. Thank you for the tip. Bye

03:07:02.200 --> 03:07:08.840
Um, please do watch emmy is collabing with uh a person's name that I forget right now

03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:16.280
Unfortunately, and she be is live with inscription if you enjoy inscription. Yes, the elden ring dlc is coming out. Um

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.240
I bloody hope I've done it on the right day

03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:28.120
I will download the dlc. We are starting a fresh save. Um, I don't know if it's one of those things where you can

03:07:29.240 --> 03:07:35.720
Just run to the dlc area. I mean, maybe if it's appropriate or unless it's like harder than kaolin type thing

03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:40.440
Can't wait to play elden ring. It's out today

03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:46.040
That I purposely push it a day back is elden ring tomorrow

03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:48.280
Eaps

03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:52.200
Oh, no, I don't want ashes

03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.440
Elden ring today

03:07:56.520 --> 03:07:59.160
Show me my youtube channel so I can look at my own

03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:02.280
Um

03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:04.280
So I can look at my own

03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:09.160
Schedule all children. Yeah, elden rings tomorrow. I'm heart rate monitor and all that. Yeah

03:08:12.200 --> 03:08:15.400
Elden ring dlc unlocks in like two hours. Yes, make sure you

03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:18.120
purchase

03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:22.200
Um, yeah, don't be surprised

03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:29.560
Um, when you see a ton of vtuber's playing elden ring, I think all of us are about to go fucking mental for it

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:36.920
Man, it breaks my heart. Strone's providing so much literally and figure out the quality and quantity why sometimes even for free

03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:38.920
And some people are still asking for more

03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:45.480
Uh, it's human nature to want more. It's fine. I understand how it works. Like there's no point in being like, you know mad

03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:48.040
um

03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:53.320
Like you can only do so much and um, you know, you know, you're in yourself your limitations

03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:58.440
Like I wouldn't push myself to like have a silly goal of like one asmr video pair

03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:03.240
A 1000 subs type thing is the most dangerous of all the girls

03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.320
She sounds so sweet and innocent and then you look at her patreon

03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:12.920
And I feel like I should report myself to the police. What steady on I wrote her plots

03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:19.080
Uh, I will say they're they're my plots. I've been written for roughly two to three months

03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:21.080
Some of them are actually only two months

03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:26.200
Uh, and then the scriptmaster comes in and I think the scriptmaster will just work as far better than mine

03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:29.800
Um, so I think you'll like them a heck of a lot more

03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:36.600
Which reminds me I actually need to send off an editing batch away because me completed her july audio space

03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:40.680
Shawnee you're maoshi, but I do love all the girls and care about them

03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:47.880
I want all of yours to be happy. Yes. I want them to be happy too. It's um, it's very interesting some some um

03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.280
I you know

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.440
I thought it was a pretty

03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:59.480
Honestly, it just feels like I've spawned in another five strongies and you know reeflings

03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:02.200
If that makes sense like, you know

03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:03.640
Mercy snippets

03:10:03.640 --> 03:10:07.640
Strongly reeflings like it feels like I've just spawned in another five that just do their own thing and have a good time

03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:10.200
And I mean that's what it's all about at the end of the day

03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:12.520
I don't think it's you know

03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:14.520
Fucking chasing numbers and oh my god

03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:18.280
Must must must have this must do this must do that and it's like no, I really have fun

03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:23.480
Like I get to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey, I'd love to do ASMR with you

03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:29.080
I'll write the script. It's like a fun little small goofy thing. You know no stress no fuss like it lets me

03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:35.080
You know interact with people in the vtuber community like it's it's like such a little blessing. Um

03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:37.320
I mean like our

03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:44.120
Holy shit. I get to claim that this is work. I get to claim that sitting in edgeville on world three eight right now

03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:46.280
uh doing wine

03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:51.720
Uh talking to reeflings is work in quotation marks like nah nah the same work

03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:59.000
Less like a corporal more of a guild of indies honestly, it's probably a more accurate thingy. Um

03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:04.280
Just that there was a lot of massive money back in to be honest. Um

03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:08.440
Yes, I'm going to try and get the girls at least 5k subscribers this

03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:14.200
Month, so I'm going to send Icy and Azura an ASMR. I'm going to get Azura to do heartbeat ASMR

03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:16.920
and kissing

03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:22.120
Maybe not kissing because I actually saw an ASMRist got their video removed for kissing

03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:30.840
I think Azura sleep aids heartbeat cuddle sound soft breathing would go very well

03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:35.720
She be actually has a sleep aid audio coming out. I ordered the artwork

03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:41.800
Um, and it's already here and I need to edit and get it ready to click send

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.560
What do you mean? I'm doing far too much

03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:50.200
Work all at once. What are you talking about? No, not the kissing. Yeah, I don't know

03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:56.200
No, so you can do like soft breathing, but for some reason if you've got a 3d or you can't go up in the ear

03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:01.640
Make it make sense. Like I I've no got clue. Make it make sense. Thank you again iron reaper for the tip

03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:05.400
I'm pretty sure I didn't read your name out because we were all thinking about how evil emmy is

03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:07.560
But emmy's a good kind of evil

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
Um, oh my tummy is rumbling

03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:15.720
I can't believe it. I may actually my human body needs to eat and hydrate

03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:20.600
Um, do you have a sleep aid audio coming out? Yes, I

03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:23.400
Haven't made it. I haven't written it

03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:27.800
But if there's anything you want in a sleep aid audio, let me know

03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:33.400
Um, I was probably just going to do the old classic route. Is there a cat in this room?

03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:38.520
Vigo

03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:40.920
I'm losing it

03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:44.120
I'm so dehydrated. I'm losing it and I think Vigo's in the room right now

03:12:44.680 --> 03:12:49.960
Uh, I might have to start making a lot of the sus ASMR member only

03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:57.480
Hmm

03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:01.720
I don't want to overwhelm the girls. Um with work requirements

03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:08.760
Um, like for me, you know streaming doing three member streaming weekend streaming every day is not problem

03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:12.040
But I am aware that people have limitations

03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:14.120
that I don't

03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:15.800
um

03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:17.800
And they experience things that I don't

03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:20.120
um

03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:24.200
So it makes it kind of like not a dangerous playing field

03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:32.120
But like I try to make things as super easy and simple like that ASMR. I got she be to talk to make sorry

03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:34.200
um

03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:39.800
I think it was like less than five minutes of dialogue and I know people might be like, oh my god

03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:42.280
Why aren't you giving us a massive amount of dialogue?

03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:47.560
And it was like I need to manage the girl's stress levels like needy streamer overload

03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:51.640
I cannot overload them with work whilst they're trying to stream

03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:57.320
I'm trying to entertain because they might struggle with things that I don't experience because I don't feel uncomfortable

03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:00.520
Or like I just feel literally right at home. Um

03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:07.480
But humble brag. No, I'm not even like in a mean way. I just like I need to be so careful and so cautious

03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:10.600
And like it's scary because like

03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:15.240
It's not like the girls have a hp bar and a stress bar that I can look at

03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:20.280
And be like, are you telling me the truth? Like I was checked in on emmy and emmy's like, I'm fine

03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:24.440
I'm cloud nine. I was like pinky promise me right now because I I don't know

03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:28.200
I actually don't know if you're good, but I think emmy is good and she was good and all that, you know

03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:32.520
Like if the girls had freaking hp bars and stress bars

03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:35.080
I would be a lot easier to navigate what I want them to do

03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:40.920
But like at the moment I'm having to be like patient and let them settle and like they've taken break days

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:44.600
And maybe on break days they'll record the youtube ASMR's for me like

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:47.080
It's um

03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:50.920
And who's thinking about you the reeflings are thinking about me silly

03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:55.320
The reeflings give me energy the reeflings give me life

03:14:55.960 --> 03:14:57.960
Hmm

03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:04.440
Literally I rolled out of bed 10 minutes before stream. I was moody. I made a cup of tea

03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:12.200
Um, I got set up the moment I come on live. I go in a massive round in rave. You guys fill me with with energy

03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:16.360
With determination. I've been filled with your determination

03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:18.600
Um

03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:23.720
Like yeah, you don't you don't you don't all worry about me. I get life like when you guys comment

03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:28.680
Oh, your ASMR was so cute. All the stream was so cute. I'm a vod watcher. Here's a clip like

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:33.800
Uh fun facts Johnny. We love you. Love you to replay

03:15:34.680 --> 03:15:39.400
If they had hp bars emmy's would enjoy if hers was low munkos

03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:45.400
Uh, I would actually mess around with the idea of a feature management game

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:49.160
I think that's very on topic, but uh, I don't have the development team

03:15:49.240 --> 03:15:52.600
I don't have a development team at all for video games, but I do have the funds

03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:57.160
But I would have to write out the game and I don't have time to write out the game right now

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.640
I wrote out the bare bones of my cookie clicker game

03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:04.200
um

03:16:04.200 --> 03:16:06.760
Totally not inspired by legend of zelda by the way, uh

03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:10.680
Yeah, I do not have time to write video games

03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:14.920
Which is annoying because it's one of the projects I'm gonna do as that what the call the kids call it now

03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:20.760
She steals our energy. He's like, he's real emmy's hp bar has an inverse relationship. We're a happy bar

03:16:21.800 --> 03:16:27.240
Gen two game just saying oh, I already know what the gen two game is and the gen three game is I've already picked it out

03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:34.040
Um, I realized very quickly whilst I was commissioning the gen one game

03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:39.800
Oh wait games actually take a lot of money and time to produce. Um, so I already know what the

03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:46.200
The gen two is uh free to play video game of an alternative nature is um

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:50.920
I'd be very surprised if anyone would guess it's because

03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:56.440
It's based on pre-established games, but we've

03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:00.840
We've borneified it and you basically can

03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:05.100
Swing with the girls in the generation in that game

03:17:05.580 --> 03:17:07.100
I

03:17:07.100 --> 03:17:09.100
Will go like

03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:13.900
She's 10 steps ahead of us when I say it took a year for the girls to pop up

03:17:13.980 --> 03:17:17.900
I wasn't kidding like you have to think ahead like you have to think of events

03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:22.140
You have to think of their birthdays. You have to think of their doughnut thongs. You have to think of alternative outfits

03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:23.820
You have to think

03:17:23.820 --> 03:17:28.540
Right, uh, we've made the offer if they sign on another year. They can get another alternative outfit

03:17:28.540 --> 03:17:32.460
All right, the girl's gonna want a group alternative outfit of a certain theme like

03:17:33.020 --> 03:17:37.580
There's like a possibility of a timeline that next year in june

03:17:38.540 --> 03:17:44.140
If we're all standing we might all have like goth variations of our designs something like that. Um

03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:50.060
Like there's a lot. Please not candy crush. No, it's not candy crush

03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:53.660
You're welcome

03:17:53.660 --> 03:18:00.940
Read and list bonus months. Yes, like we so the split is 80 20 and if they sign on another year that increases to

03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:02.460
um

03:18:02.460 --> 03:18:04.460
85 15

03:18:05.100 --> 03:18:06.540
um

03:18:06.540 --> 03:18:09.420
And they also get an alternative costume

03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:12.620
on the house by

03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:14.620
Like the development team

03:18:15.420 --> 03:18:19.420
But they can like dictate what all outfit they want. That's perfectly fine. We don't have an issue with that

03:18:19.420 --> 03:18:23.020
But we pay for it as I like thanks for signing on for another year. Yippee

03:18:25.180 --> 03:18:28.060
Will it be a card game? No, there's not a card game

03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:31.660
I actually can only remember the first two

03:18:32.460 --> 03:18:34.220
um

03:18:34.220 --> 03:18:36.220
The first two generations game

03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:39.260
type

03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:43.660
Based well, it'd be a mobile. No, it's a mobile. Are you joking me?

03:18:45.020 --> 03:18:48.220
Hi, I just got home from working realize I missed sharing a smart any chance

03:18:48.220 --> 03:18:55.820
It's currently on patreon at this moment in time. Um, I'm going to upload it to twitter

03:18:56.540 --> 03:19:00.540
I need to buy twitter

03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:03.500
Oh, we popped. Yay

03:19:04.380 --> 03:19:05.820
What are we?

03:19:05.820 --> 03:19:10.780
We're 83. Wait, we may actually make 85. My prediction is true. I can't believe that

03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:13.500
Wow, what's that? Yeah

03:19:13.660 --> 03:19:20.300
Cuttles turns into a sea jargon just like pokemon evolution cleolix and animal. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good split. Yes, um

03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:25.100
because of the freedoms and how low is the

03:19:25.980 --> 03:19:32.940
As I've said this before the actual upkeep the up. Yeah. Yeah, the upkeep the upkeep really ain't that much

03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:37.180
Ain't that much at all? I don't know what to tell you. It does not cost that much. Um

03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:46.700
Probably the biggest cost right now is clippers unironically sending away these clip edits to be made

03:19:47.420 --> 03:19:48.460
um

03:19:48.460 --> 03:19:51.340
I have three clippers for the girls and they all unanimously

03:19:51.820 --> 03:19:55.740
Unanimously needed a break all roughly at the same time

03:19:56.460 --> 03:20:02.380
Um, which has led me to seek out a clipper for my own strongy stuff at the moment

03:20:03.020 --> 03:20:06.380
Uh, because I've completely abandoned like my youtube shorts

03:20:06.700 --> 03:20:13.500
Um in favor of the girls at the moment. Um, shebe's shorts are currently all getting limited

03:20:14.220 --> 03:20:17.980
So I can't promote her shorts. I can't put advertisement money into her shorts

03:20:18.380 --> 03:20:24.460
Um her praise short was supposed I was going to put money into for advertisement. I can't because she's got too much

03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:31.180
About 1.8k wines. Oh god. I don't know if I'm gonna make it in this room. Um

03:20:32.940 --> 03:20:34.940
But yeah, we we struggle

03:20:37.180 --> 03:20:42.940
Remember to rest by the way you have a collab too. Yes. No, I am I am I'm going offline when

03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:51.420
Uh, Azura comes on which gives me two hours rest, which is more than adequate. Um, I'm talking to mercy one hour before

03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:53.660
the stream starts

03:20:53.660 --> 03:20:55.900
um, and

03:20:55.900 --> 03:21:01.020
I just wanted to get some cheeky runescaping in because there's a few levels. We uh, definitely need to get up

03:21:01.980 --> 03:21:05.900
How do you work on their videos or what? Um, maybe like an edit and thumbnail

03:21:06.700 --> 03:21:09.100
um, so I basically

03:21:09.980 --> 03:21:11.020
um

03:21:11.020 --> 03:21:13.660
Go through their clips and if I find something clippable

03:21:13.900 --> 03:21:18.860
I will send it to an editor, but I've actually asked them to do that because I can't scour all their clips at once

03:21:18.860 --> 03:21:20.860
It's not possible. Um

03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:28.300
But I have pre-made shorts I make of them that's like insider knowledge about the vtuber agency or insider vtuber stuff

03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:32.060
Like mercy's shorts. Oh my god. I'm so sorry to expose mercy like this

03:21:33.340 --> 03:21:36.140
Mercy never wrote any of her shorts. That's all me

03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:42.380
The short about like senpai am I blonde did you look should I been blonde or like this is what goes wrong as a v

03:21:42.380 --> 03:21:45.580
These are that's me. I'm sorry. It's all me

03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:49.100
I'm telling her what to say

03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:56.140
Exposed called it. Yes. Um, but it's me. That's pulling the strings. It's me. That's wrote these scripts and

03:21:56.700 --> 03:22:01.980
It's me piloting her mecca and sending it off to the editor because I don't want to stress the talents out

03:22:02.380 --> 03:22:09.420
With like having to do all these bits and bobs in between streaming. It's not good for it to reduce their stress as much as possible

03:22:09.580 --> 03:22:11.100
I'm like

03:22:11.100 --> 03:22:16.140
Putting it on me because I can handle these stress levels. Like I don't even feel stress

03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:22.940
You know what I feel frustrated that I've let the girls down with a short scenario, but it's slowly evening out like what we're

03:22:23.980 --> 03:22:28.060
I think I'm probably gonna try and see if I can find another editor to have on standby

03:22:29.100 --> 03:22:30.460
because

03:22:30.460 --> 03:22:34.220
We've got someone that skill isn't quite there yet and I'm like

03:22:34.540 --> 03:22:38.940
I've need to pay the big bucks to get the edits. I want a new pair. You're such a hard-working beast

03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:41.500
Stroney is actually all a veeler

03:22:42.860 --> 03:22:46.620
Yeah, I wasn't kidding when I said I was icy snow paws

03:22:47.420 --> 03:22:50.620
Fuck I can't do our accent right now because I'm smiling

03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:53.340
I'm doing the most stereotypical accent

03:22:54.300 --> 03:23:00.140
Dada, do you like my photos on twitter at twitter.com slash

03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:03.100

Do you like my tummy data?

03:23:08.540 --> 03:23:12.220
I can't do it. I can't do it. It's terrible. If we ever do

03:23:12.940 --> 03:23:16.940
Like april fools. I have to go on ic because I can't do anyone else's voice

03:23:17.500 --> 03:23:19.500
Okay, real Michael. Hi

03:23:19.580 --> 03:23:23.020
Wow, yeah, like I can't do mersey's voice. I can't do emmy

03:23:24.060 --> 03:23:27.420
I can't do she be our reserves for that, but I'm gonna sneeze in a second

03:23:29.260 --> 03:23:31.260
Okay, sorry

03:23:31.500 --> 03:23:33.500
I sneezed and I hiccuped

03:23:34.940 --> 03:23:36.460
Um

03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:38.460
Oh, I can feel another sneeze

03:23:39.580 --> 03:23:41.580
Bless you. Thank you

03:23:41.580 --> 03:23:46.380
A little cheeky hiccup after sneeze anyone gauge on hate. Salut. Bonjour

03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:49.340
Bonjour ça va

03:23:49.580 --> 03:23:53.900
Oh, oui, bien bien. Merci à toi. Oh, oui. Je jouais

Euh, lundskip

Uh, yeah, sorry, that's me just absolutely losing it. I think I am gonna actually have to get some food and hydration

03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:06.380
Because I am starting to get a wee bit delirious

03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:11.580
We've got a tunnel vision is occurring my outside viewing point. Definitely not as good

03:24:13.020 --> 03:24:15.340
Uh, qu'on a mschit qu'on a mschit messes. Um

03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:17.100
Um

03:24:17.100 --> 03:24:20.700
You just got some snacks you really can't wait anymore like god damn it streamer get off

03:24:20.940 --> 03:24:29.820
Yes for any harem members that are lurking in the shadows, please be advised that none other than she be cotton boom is live right now

03:24:31.020 --> 03:24:33.260
Now you get yourself water and food correction. Yeah

03:24:35.820 --> 03:24:40.860
I'm so focused on the wines though. You'll make it. It's less than an hour if you lock in. Okay

03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:44.700
Right, we'll have a very quick break. I'm gonna make honey tea

03:24:45.020 --> 03:24:51.980
Um reefling if you could just uh start preparing for the ink for the tea. That'd be great. Um

03:24:53.500 --> 03:24:55.500
Yeah, ready? Okay

03:24:55.500 --> 03:24:57.500
Such an ASMR announcement

03:24:57.580 --> 03:25:03.020
Hmm reefling sometimes you have to force this woman to take care of herself. Remember that. Thank you for the great yap fest

03:25:03.180 --> 03:25:08.700
Gonna give she be some love. Yes, please do not be afraid to show any of my gen mates love. I have absolutely no

03:25:09.500 --> 03:25:11.500
Whatever the word is is a jealousy

03:25:11.900 --> 03:25:18.140
What is it? You know what we should actually create a name for the vtuber jealousy phenomenon

03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:22.380
I'm here for it. We should create a new term right now in the english language

03:25:23.660 --> 03:25:25.660
for when a vtuber is like

03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:32.540
Don't watch other vtuber's but like not because they're like yandere and like mercy doesn't count because she's yandere, you know what i'm saying

03:25:33.180 --> 03:25:38.140
But like we should actually call it and it's like it's the female vtuber phenomenon

03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:43.580
Where they get jealous envy tuba. Maybe envy. Mmm

03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:47.340
Envy cute possessive girlfriend

03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:51.660
Extranged tuba possessive. It's literally called a vendetta. Wait

03:25:52.380 --> 03:25:54.140
What's the definition of it?

03:25:54.140 --> 03:25:55.660
Vendetta

03:25:55.660 --> 03:26:01.740
The effort initiative all done. Let's pull up google for this one lads because I actually don't know it off the top of my head

03:26:01.740 --> 03:26:03.740
What a vendetta is

03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:11.660
Let me just brew some wine then you make me vendetta a blood feud in which the family of the murdered person seeks vengeance

03:26:15.500 --> 03:26:24.060
Or a prolonged bitter quarrel with with or campaign against someone. Okay. That one seems more like it

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:30.060
A bit of a a bit of a bitterness. How about that a bit of bitterness?

03:26:30.620 --> 03:26:32.620
Yeah, it's probably a bit more

03:26:33.100 --> 03:26:34.780
Don't be self-centered

03:26:34.780 --> 03:26:38.220
Wrong definition. Isn't that called parasocial? I don't

03:26:39.660 --> 03:26:43.180
No, isn't parasocial when someone wants to show up to your house?

03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:47.980
I thought that's what parasocial the definition of parasocial is

03:26:48.620 --> 03:26:51.500
When someone genuinely wants to show up to your house. It's like

03:26:52.460 --> 03:26:54.460
Serion mate. Serion

03:26:54.780 --> 03:27:01.420
The convention sure show up to the convention my house. No, sorry. Uh, gimme. He's gonna start freaking out. No, that's the stalker

03:27:01.980 --> 03:27:06.780
Okay, no, that's talk. Wait, so then what's parasocial parasocial is getting attached online

03:27:09.740 --> 03:27:11.740
There's levels, but yeah, that would be better

03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:17.660
Yeah, I used to have people that said they were going to show up to my house. Uh, maybe don't do that

03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:20.620
Maybe don't do that

03:27:21.180 --> 03:27:26.460
Parasocial is projected one-sided friendship. Parasocial would be me saying strone's my best though when she doesn't even know my name

03:27:27.180 --> 03:27:29.420
And yet I can read your name in chat right now shopping behavior

03:27:30.860 --> 03:27:34.060
Is it is it like warped perception of reality?

03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:41.820
One-sided relationship with someone you've never met so you actually see yourself as someone's significant other. Ah, okay. Okay

03:27:44.140 --> 03:27:45.500
So

03:27:45.580 --> 03:27:50.700
It would be reality is not in check. I remember sweet Anita talking about her stalker situation

03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:52.380
I don't know Benny you guys heard about it

03:27:52.540 --> 03:27:58.140
It was like the guy literally bought a house across the road from her and would sleep in her garden in that and like peep through

03:27:58.140 --> 03:27:59.580
her litter box

03:27:59.580 --> 03:28:05.260
And like wake her up during the night and all that and she's just the police refuse to do anything and she's just like

03:28:05.900 --> 03:28:08.460
Oh wait, I don't know if there is an update. Maybe I'm making that up

03:28:08.700 --> 03:28:14.860
But she basically has accepted that the only way the guy's ever gonna be dealt with via the law

03:28:15.180 --> 03:28:19.580
Is she'll be murdered, which is actually quite a common case

03:28:22.140 --> 03:28:29.260
For stalking situations, I wouldn't be surprised if there might be new stalking laws coming out in the next few years because

03:28:30.540 --> 03:28:32.540
uh, yeah

03:28:33.100 --> 03:28:38.220
The parasocial knife cuts both ways because just just as we get attached to vtuber vtuber get attached to us

03:28:38.780 --> 03:28:40.860
Yes, I agree with that sentiment

03:28:41.820 --> 03:28:44.540
And like we said strong, he's my wife and I wasn't joking

03:28:45.180 --> 03:28:47.180
Ah, right

03:28:47.260 --> 03:28:49.260
But you know my husband

03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:52.060
Husband riefling husband riefling has

03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:55.020
husband

03:28:55.020 --> 03:28:55.980
sling

03:28:55.980 --> 03:28:57.500
husband

03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:59.500
Reef bend reef bend

03:29:01.660 --> 03:29:08.140
Don't be co-dependent to the corporal. Oh, no. Oh, if I guess it's out of the peeler allegations. I might allow it

03:29:08.540 --> 03:29:11.420
I just make the honey tea around here

03:29:15.500 --> 03:29:16.940
That's curious, it's curious

03:29:16.940 --> 03:29:21.580
It's like one of those forbidden topics you're not supposed to talk about but when you open when you openly talk about it

03:29:21.580 --> 03:29:26.940
It's like, okay. Okay. We're just getting perspectives in everyone's thought process. Well, it's almost like when you openly discuss things and

03:29:27.420 --> 03:29:29.580
Instead of just assume things behind closers

03:29:30.620 --> 03:29:32.620
like wild wild

03:29:33.580 --> 03:29:36.780
Husbandling husband, that's kind of cute

03:29:37.740 --> 03:29:43.020
And we're played runescape. So I have no idea what's going on. It seems like a just-chan. It is absolutely a just-chan

03:29:43.180 --> 03:29:45.820
We are basically doing the crazy crazy task

03:29:46.620 --> 03:29:47.980
of

03:29:47.980 --> 03:29:49.020
reducing

03:29:49.020 --> 03:29:50.220
Oh, it popped

03:29:50.220 --> 03:29:51.740
84

03:29:51.740 --> 03:29:56.940
Let's go. Okay. Maybe I should go for food now like actually go for food this time

03:29:58.300 --> 03:30:03.740
Um, yes. No runescape is just an opportunity for me to yap your ear off for hours on end

03:30:03.820 --> 03:30:10.780
I'm so sorry. You have fallen for my pranks yet again. You have fallen for my ruse. Um, I have misled you astray

03:30:11.420 --> 03:30:17.100
And to think that this is just a regular game. It's not. It's just another excuse for me to tell you about the capitalist

03:30:19.500 --> 03:30:23.340
I keep thinking that level sound is actually a jumpstart. Oh, I'm so sorry. How loud do you listen?

03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:27.980
Do you not listen on a low volume? Please make sure you're not listening too loud

03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:35.580
Um, because I will break your eardrums. Uh, when I get too excited. Do I make myself clear that husband briefly?

03:30:36.140 --> 03:30:37.260
Aw

03:30:37.260 --> 03:30:43.020
Thank you for the tip Zarian that husband literally me. Have I seen any that come literally me?

03:30:43.820 --> 03:30:48.620
No, I think our new version is that baby is literally me and I'm the father. I like that

03:30:49.260 --> 03:30:52.780
I'm enjoying that quite a lot right now. Um

03:30:53.740 --> 03:31:00.220
The husband and the baby is me. I like that hydration check right. Okay fine fine. I'm freaking I'll go get food

03:31:00.300 --> 03:31:04.540
I can't believe it. I can't believe my bodily functions need to take priority

03:31:04.860 --> 03:31:09.260
Man, why can't I just stream for hours on end? Like honestly, don't be so rude

03:31:10.460 --> 03:31:13.820
But your voice even if excited is fine at high volume the level up is not

03:31:14.220 --> 03:31:17.900
Okay, even great football you happen. If I had a headless headset

03:31:18.060 --> 03:31:21.260
I would like take you to the kitchen with me and I'll be like, hi Gimli

03:31:21.740 --> 03:31:24.860
I bet you Gimli's gonna come flying around the corner the moment I leave this room

03:31:25.420 --> 03:31:27.980
Thank you for tip, right? I'll be give me four minutes

03:31:27.980 --> 03:31:32.380
It takes like four minutes for the kettle to boil and I'll see if there's anything I can microwave if not

03:31:33.260 --> 03:31:39.740
I might be ordering a cheeky takeaway after um, I'll host a I'll be direct into Azura Azura is playing

03:31:41.980 --> 03:31:43.980
That one game I've already forgotten

03:31:44.540 --> 03:31:47.500
What's the name of the game Azura is playing?

03:31:48.780 --> 03:31:53.660
A whole four minutes. I have you on 5.1 surround system. Please bless me. That's Scottish boys. No

03:31:54.780 --> 03:31:59.580
Yeah, yes Azura is playing Little Nightmares, which is a fantastic 10 out of 10 game

03:32:00.060 --> 03:32:04.220
Um, I'm very excited to see her playthrough of that and I will be

03:32:04.860 --> 03:32:09.420
Hopefully if it's a good stream, I might be able to get highlight reel made of that stream

03:32:09.660 --> 03:32:15.260
I'm gonna see if I can get a buckshot roulette highlight reel made of my stream possibly

03:32:15.820 --> 03:32:18.220
I think you deserve more takeaway. That's just because

03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:23.100
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's mm-hmm. Yeah

03:32:23.820 --> 03:32:28.540
Okay, I will actually go get food and get a drink. Oh, I'm lightheaded because of dehydration

03:32:28.620 --> 03:32:34.300
I just shook my head up and down there. Okay. I will actually go that was scary. I will be back in four minutes

03:32:39.420 --> 03:32:41.420
So

03:33:10.300 --> 03:33:12.300
Are you squiddling me right now?

03:33:30.940 --> 03:33:32.940
Are you squiddling me right now?

03:33:39.420 --> 03:33:41.420
You

03:33:53.420 --> 03:33:55.420
Are you squiddling me right now?

03:34:09.420 --> 03:34:11.420
Are you squiddling me right now?

03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:41.420
You

03:35:09.420 --> 03:35:11.420
You

03:35:39.420 --> 03:35:41.420
You

03:36:09.420 --> 03:36:11.420
You

03:36:39.420 --> 03:36:41.420
You

03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:11.420
You

03:37:39.420 --> 03:37:42.380
Oh

03:38:09.420 --> 03:38:11.420
You

03:38:25.980 --> 03:38:27.980
Yeah, I kind of scared myself

03:38:28.140 --> 03:38:33.580
With a lightheaded moment. I have so much food with me right now. It's like funny. I think so before though

03:38:33.980 --> 03:38:35.980
This is Gimli and Bebo are

03:38:36.300 --> 03:38:39.420
Waiting to launch themselves in the down room

03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:43.340
Okay

03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:47.580
So if you hear some my awing it's very possible. I can still hear him

03:38:48.220 --> 03:38:51.420
I ain't going to do it. We need to be sure she takes care of herself

03:38:52.140 --> 03:38:54.940
Yeah, I'm good to go. Okay. Oh

03:38:55.740 --> 03:38:57.740
Hold on ain't it bro

03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:02.060
Okay, I have uh leftover yippies

03:39:03.020 --> 03:39:05.020
There's five had enough to actually cook them away

03:39:09.500 --> 03:39:11.500
I've got tea

03:39:11.900 --> 03:39:16.780
I want a Nutella bar. I've got a bowl of leftover cheesy chips. I've got my

03:39:17.740 --> 03:39:21.660
Chocolate covered raisins, which I've yet to successfully eat. I've taken them out twice now

03:39:22.300 --> 03:39:27.660
The novel I've got wee blueberry muffin. I don't know if you can hear me spank it a little bit and then

03:39:28.220 --> 03:39:33.420
The piece de resistance. I have a um fruit juice and a glass because you know

03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:36.460
Um

03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:40.060
It's good for you and it's got like seven different types of fruit and it's the only thing that's

03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:43.980
Probably keeping me alive right now. Um successfully

03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:46.060
and

03:39:46.060 --> 03:39:50.140
Yeah, I'm about to stuff my face and drink and get a ton of sugar in my body because that's scary

03:39:52.140 --> 03:39:54.460
I feel this one's a good girl damn straight good girl

03:39:58.620 --> 03:40:05.020
I'm inhaling these chips, please you're welcome to eat with me if you so desire, itadakimasu

03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:11.500
It's like actual fruit. This has apple coconut water

03:40:12.540 --> 03:40:15.020
and mango passion fruit dragon fruit

03:40:15.820 --> 03:40:16.780
and

03:40:16.780 --> 03:40:18.780
It's like really healthy

03:40:18.940 --> 03:40:20.940
Uh try and eat one

03:40:21.500 --> 03:40:27.740
Eat one I try and drink one at least every week because I don't eat a lot of fruit

03:40:27.740 --> 03:40:32.780
But I eat tons of vegetables. She says that she eats cheesy chips that doesn't count. Um

03:40:34.940 --> 03:40:40.300
But I'll try and have one every week because I think it's keeping the scurvy away

03:40:43.340 --> 03:40:44.700
Um

03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:48.460
I just never seem to buy fruit like I feel like it always goes off where it's always like

03:40:49.180 --> 03:40:54.300
Not like a way too late to eat it and I don't want to be wasteful, you know

03:40:56.860 --> 03:40:59.340
What percent is juice? What does that mean?

03:41:01.820 --> 03:41:06.140
A hundred percent no concentrate zero added sugar zero artificial

03:41:07.180 --> 03:41:10.140
Um it says on the the patent game

03:41:12.140 --> 03:41:17.740
So it's supposed to be super good for me. Hopefully if not, I've been lied to how dare you how dare I be lied to

03:41:18.940 --> 03:41:20.940
Mm-hmm

03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:29.180
Yeah, you have to eat on the day you get it literally like sauce but

03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:34.460
I've been so disappointed with supermarkets lately that I've been using like

03:41:35.020 --> 03:41:40.060
independent stores and the quality of the and it's so cheaper and so different quality as well

03:41:41.580 --> 03:41:46.540
Like these super fucking mental national chains is just like nothing

03:41:49.340 --> 03:41:51.340
My god

03:41:51.580 --> 03:41:57.340
You forget how good food tastes until you eat it. Oh, yeah, this should this should bang him

03:42:01.980 --> 03:42:06.460
Let me shake up my fruit juice so I can uh confirm that I've had my five a day for today

03:42:08.620 --> 03:42:09.260
Mm

03:42:09.260 --> 03:42:13.580
They say the Mediterranean diet is the best one you can do because they have like so much fruit and veg in it

03:42:13.580 --> 03:42:14.940
And fish as well

03:42:14.940 --> 03:42:21.340
Fish is good for you, but the only fish I can eat the sun's terrible. I'm just so pretty. Oh, I just spilled my juice

03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:29.340
I spilled a little bit on my mouse mat. So now it gets to be on me and yeah, oh have a napkin. Thank god. I have a napkin

03:42:31.820 --> 03:42:34.780
Okay bottoms up I uh, we support local businesses

03:42:38.060 --> 03:42:39.660
Mm-hmm

03:42:39.740 --> 03:42:43.740
Oh this shit busting for real. I love mango mangoes delicious fruit

03:42:44.940 --> 03:42:50.380
Yeah, like cod fish and chips haddock is the only fish I can eat because it's fucking battered and fried and I'm like, bro

03:42:50.460 --> 03:42:55.820
How how how more British can I get? I tried to eat salmon couldn't have it. I don't mind shrimp

03:42:56.220 --> 03:42:57.500
um

03:42:57.500 --> 03:43:03.260
Shrimp isn't that bad, but there's not really many things. I have it with a baked potato, but I don't have it with any else

03:43:04.220 --> 03:43:09.260
Maybe I should try and make a shrimp salad to get more fish in me because fish is like really good for you

03:43:10.140 --> 03:43:16.140
When it's not full of mercury thanks to humans and dumping things in the water where it doesn't belong

03:43:20.300 --> 03:43:22.300
Oh good

03:43:24.540 --> 03:43:26.540
Oh fucking good

03:43:27.580 --> 03:43:29.580
Almost finished it

03:43:29.580 --> 03:43:31.580
And then we'll move on to the next items

03:43:32.540 --> 03:43:34.140
who will

03:43:34.140 --> 03:43:37.420
So who will be the refund to clean the mouse pad? No, not you

03:43:40.140 --> 03:43:44.060
Lost genuinely thank you for being a caring person strongy

03:43:44.460 --> 03:43:48.380
Be sure to get enough rest for yourself. We love you underscore love

03:43:49.020 --> 03:43:51.020
Oh, thank you little reflin

03:43:51.740 --> 03:43:57.500
And thank you Brian for announcing little refling's words. Thank you for so it's very kind of you not you don't need to worry about me

03:43:57.820 --> 03:43:59.820
Okay, you don't need to worry about me

03:44:00.460 --> 03:44:02.460
I

03:44:03.740 --> 03:44:08.460
Have the tism and it enables me to do things and that's why I can do all this stuff

03:44:08.460 --> 03:44:10.460
So don't worry about me. Okay

03:44:10.620 --> 03:44:14.780
If you mean forgetting to eat and drink that's literally because I'm having such a good time

03:44:15.260 --> 03:44:19.740
Like streaming and I don't really want to like interrupt that moment for a few moments, you know

03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:29.020
What a strange pee is it polska? I don't know what it is. I actually don't know what currency that is

03:44:29.020 --> 03:44:31.980
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Is it peso weaponized?

03:44:34.780 --> 03:44:36.780
I know that feeling yes

03:44:36.940 --> 03:44:40.300
Like I'm just getting something like I'm sure you guys have been lost in the sauce

03:44:40.300 --> 03:44:45.740
Like if you've ever played a video game and then like you kind of wake out wake up from your trance on the other side

03:44:45.820 --> 03:44:49.260
You're like, oh my god, I haven't eaten or drank and like a couple of hours type thing

03:44:49.260 --> 03:44:51.900
Like it's kind of like that with streaming like I just cannot shut up

03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:56.380
Uh, I love it. I'll have an amazing time with the reflins. Hopefully the content is good

03:44:56.380 --> 03:45:01.900
I know some people runescape residents sleeper. But look, it's one of my goals. Okay. Once it's once it's done

03:45:01.900 --> 03:45:04.540
We don't have to come back. Okay. Once it's done

03:45:05.500 --> 03:45:10.860
And we're doing a watch along and the next one. So we have like a topic of conversation

03:45:10.860 --> 03:45:14.620
So don't worry about having to like talk and we are going to do the

03:45:15.900 --> 03:45:19.420
Is it john wick is john wick. We're going to do the john wick series

03:45:20.220 --> 03:45:25.900
Whilst I do wines in the background and we might do it like that until we get very close to the end

03:45:26.540 --> 03:45:31.260
And I'll just do one big massive. Yeah, because I kind of saw myself six there. Thank you for coming and remember

03:45:31.900 --> 03:45:36.300
I appreciate it. I'll try the member ASMR in two days time. Wink wink

03:45:38.220 --> 03:45:43.500
I'm here for shawty not for the game. What do you mean? You're not here to watch me put wine and water to get

03:45:43.740 --> 03:45:45.740
Sorry grapes and water together

03:45:46.620 --> 03:45:48.300
Don't be silly

03:45:48.300 --> 03:45:54.940
Don't be silly. This is the elusive gameplay that you have always craved your entire life. No vtuber has done it before

03:45:55.020 --> 03:45:59.980
Yes, a vtuber most likely has done it. Apparently john wick five is in production. That better be a joke

03:46:00.060 --> 03:46:02.540
I wanted to watch a series that had a finished end

03:46:04.380 --> 03:46:08.540
Uh, should we watch a different type of series then? What could we watch?

03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:11.660
What is something that has free free films? That's good

03:46:13.580 --> 03:46:17.820
Does transformers was there like five transformers or am I making that up?

03:46:20.940 --> 03:46:24.300
No john wick isn't finished. Oh come on, right

03:46:25.180 --> 03:46:27.180
Maybe we'll pick something else then

03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:31.980
I want a start of a story and I want an end of a story. Is that too much to ask for?

03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:35.180
Because it clearly is

03:46:37.820 --> 03:46:41.020
Just a a cheeky series spider-man

03:46:45.580 --> 03:46:50.220
No, I don't think spider-man would do honestly watching story play runescape makes me question getting back into that

03:46:50.220 --> 03:46:54.460
I'm only concerned with that keeper runescapes that you can pick it up and drop it at any time

03:46:54.540 --> 03:46:57.100
And like get a feel for like doing the free stuff

03:46:57.580 --> 03:46:59.900
Like I don't think you need membership to buy wine

03:46:59.980 --> 03:47:03.580
So if you wanted night night cooking like you can do it whilst like getting items and all that

03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:12.060
Um kung fu panda if you ignore the force. I've actually not seen the other kung fu pandas. I only saw the first one

03:47:13.260 --> 03:47:17.500
Maybe we should watch kung fu panda and we just pretend the force doesn't we do not see the four

03:47:17.500 --> 03:47:19.500
I'm

03:47:19.740 --> 03:47:25.100
Before we end up nerding out on star wars, but that's about nine installments technically

03:47:26.780 --> 03:47:30.780
The godfather I've never seen the godfather before it's like a three installments

03:47:34.940 --> 03:47:36.940
Wow

03:47:39.420 --> 03:47:45.180
Okay, fruit juice is finished. I am now being nutritionalized in fruit juice with natural sugars

03:47:45.180 --> 03:47:48.780
And um all the goodness and five a big

03:47:49.660 --> 03:47:56.140
Vic the victim vitamin that come with my life has become so not sure how many movies apparently that's the golden cap

03:47:56.220 --> 03:48:02.140
Godfather is so good. I don't care for the godfather. Oh, I'll chance a bit chance a bit. I'm not sure about the godfather. Um,

03:48:02.540 --> 03:48:04.540
It's a bit well

03:48:05.260 --> 03:48:07.260
The dark night

03:48:07.260 --> 03:48:09.260
Is that got free installments?

03:48:09.820 --> 03:48:15.500
Maybe we do the dark night. I wouldn't mind the dark night with it with Heath Ledger that one

03:48:16.540 --> 03:48:19.900
Did it finish did he did the Heath Ledger finish the series didn't I?

03:48:25.340 --> 03:48:30.300
Oh, I do want to watch austin powers. Why please do it before the peeler. Oh, no

03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:33.260
We have to watch austin power

03:48:35.980 --> 03:48:37.980
Hmm

03:48:38.700 --> 03:48:40.700
I've never seen back to the future actually

03:48:43.020 --> 03:48:47.020
All I know is that his mum wants to bone him when I'm like, oh, this is my kind of pot

03:48:48.860 --> 03:48:50.540
Oh, who was it?

03:48:50.540 --> 03:48:54.540
Oh, who goes there identification? Sorry. I'm like, uh, my fork is hitting the ball

03:48:57.100 --> 03:48:59.820
It passed away are you squinting me right now?

03:49:01.340 --> 03:49:06.060
I subbed to your patreon to listen to the clapping hands clapping hands

03:49:06.380 --> 03:49:10.460
I'm just ASMR and I have to say it was a great listen

03:49:10.940 --> 03:49:15.580
Yeah, I've never heard anything like this in my years of being of tuber. Oh my god

03:49:15.580 --> 03:49:21.900
I hope you do this again in the future. Yeah, sure. Jeez. Thank you for the 20 jason. I'm glad you enjoyed it

03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:27.580
Thanks for the support on patreon as well. That's hilarious. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was just a stupid idea

03:49:28.860 --> 03:49:34.380
I was like, oh, I can clap without using my hands. So I'll make an ASMR about it like ha ha ha

03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:38.940
Um, and I just went for it. It was just like a silly idea

03:49:39.820 --> 03:49:42.060
I'm glad you enjoyed it. That's funny as anything

03:49:46.620 --> 03:49:47.980
Hmm

03:49:47.980 --> 03:49:49.420
Okay

03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:53.660
All my chips are gone. I've eaten chips. I've finished a drink. I'm gonna have a sip of water now

03:49:54.860 --> 03:49:57.740
Could watch alien if you ignore the force no one likes the force

03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:00.140
Hmm

03:50:00.140 --> 03:50:05.420
Yeah, that audio wrecked me. Who lost to the audio admit it right now. I want to know if you lost

03:50:05.900 --> 03:50:08.300
Can you it's just me jumping up a boom

03:50:16.700 --> 03:50:20.380
I lost to the audio I lost you lost you nailed

03:50:21.660 --> 03:50:23.660
Yeah

03:50:23.980 --> 03:50:28.460
Not beating the alley the alley gunkies about having a dump being veal or

03:50:30.060 --> 03:50:32.060
I am going to do a big burp

03:50:40.940 --> 03:50:44.060
This is why I can't eat and be on make at the same time

03:50:45.020 --> 03:50:47.020
Oh

03:50:52.620 --> 03:50:55.420
Please tell me someone just taped my dick twitched

03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:02.300
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

03:51:04.300 --> 03:51:11.340
Like I just um, I do apologize, but I can't help but that had reverb and everything

03:51:11.820 --> 03:51:13.340
I

03:51:13.340 --> 03:51:18.380
Was so fun that one had depth to it. I could feel it coming. I was like, well, that's gonna be a burp

03:51:19.500 --> 03:51:20.940
Yeah

03:51:20.940 --> 03:51:22.940
Mukbang ASMR is going to be 30%

03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:27.980
Oh, maybe I should upload the burp in ASMR is by 2k or should I make it a normal one?

03:51:28.140 --> 03:51:32.780
No, I posted a normal one for one key. So for the second one, I'm going to put another meme one

03:51:32.780 --> 03:51:38.540
I have a burp in ASMR that I've already recorded. It's just me drinking coal and water and burping all the way through it

03:51:38.780 --> 03:51:42.140
And before that gets a warning

03:51:42.620 --> 03:51:49.100
No, that wouldn't get surely surely someone can burp on youtube.com surely does not get that bad

03:51:50.780 --> 03:51:54.780
I'll see I'll edit and see if I think it's bad or not because I don't want another warning

03:51:56.220 --> 03:52:00.940
Uh burping ASMR. Yeah, that's right. We have no manners here. I was raised in a barn

03:52:01.820 --> 03:52:05.580
I'm just probably gonna get some weird comments. Look as long as you guys are happy. I'm happy

03:52:05.820 --> 03:52:11.420
I provide the weirdness you indulge in the weirdness. Oh, oh my god. It's my gen name indulge

03:52:11.500 --> 03:52:14.860
Wow, I wonder why a name does indulge. It's almost like you're to indulge in the girls

03:52:15.580 --> 03:52:17.580
Crazy concept. All right muffin time

03:52:20.460 --> 03:52:22.460
You're breathing it's not like

03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:28.300
So on it. I don't want a burping interest, but you may give me one. Have mercy, please. That's hilarious

03:52:29.580 --> 03:52:31.340
I remember

03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:35.580
Someone was like, wait, why are you guys in a burping and they're like imagine

03:52:37.180 --> 03:52:41.660
She slobs down. She finishes the ink sample and then burps

03:52:43.420 --> 03:52:47.980
Because uh how hard she was eating the the ink sample

03:52:52.700 --> 03:52:54.700
I do have mercy in around five hours

03:52:55.900 --> 03:52:57.900
Uh

03:52:58.460 --> 03:53:03.900
Did I even hit that properly? Sorry, let me do that again. I do have mercy in five hours

03:53:06.860 --> 03:53:08.380
Thank you

03:53:08.380 --> 03:53:12.380
I'll be here for a couple more hours until we read into Zoro so I can take a quick break

03:53:12.860 --> 03:53:14.940
And then I'll make sure me and mercy can see

03:53:15.980 --> 03:53:19.580
I even connect to the same game server and before I show you the internet

03:53:23.900 --> 03:53:25.900
Boo

03:53:28.860 --> 03:53:31.820
I set her up for that. Thank you. I'll steal it myself. Um

03:53:33.580 --> 03:53:37.900
The real funny is actually the reeflings and not me. I just yank your jokes and then play that

03:53:40.060 --> 03:53:43.500
I was thinking of adding a few more sound effects, but I'm not done it yet

03:53:45.260 --> 03:53:47.260
Ah, my muffin's falling apart

03:53:50.780 --> 03:53:52.300
Ah

03:53:52.300 --> 03:53:54.780
I'm almost there. I'm okay. I'm going for muffin

03:53:55.580 --> 03:53:59.500
Yeah, what's next on the roster of fucking eating?

03:54:05.820 --> 03:54:07.820
Maybe

03:54:07.980 --> 03:54:09.820
Maybe one more

03:54:09.820 --> 03:54:15.020
I need one k more wines and then I've reached my goal as Zoro comes on in three hours. I've got plenty of time

03:54:15.340 --> 03:54:17.340
What were we even sweating for?

03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:20.700
Burping is only when

03:54:21.180 --> 03:54:24.540
It's someone you're attracted to it's the same with the peeler stuff. Ah

03:54:26.620 --> 03:54:28.620
You know on the golden

03:54:29.820 --> 03:54:34.700
Uh, I think I might be pushing the upper limits of the AI at the moment

03:54:34.700 --> 03:54:37.580
So please do excuse me if I drop any conversation. All right, I'll do it

03:54:38.620 --> 03:54:39.820
um

03:54:39.820 --> 03:54:44.380
As I said, I literally do not have one piece of content that's limited ads because of um

03:54:45.500 --> 03:54:49.340
The upper I'm very aware of how the AI works. Um

03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:55.420
And you know how it can do like live transcriptions or whatever type thing

03:54:55.580 --> 03:54:58.460
Um, I am able to skirt them one because of my accent

03:54:58.460 --> 03:55:03.180
Which is fantastic because it cannot for the life of itself figure out my accent for a wee bit

03:55:03.420 --> 03:55:06.380
However, AI technology is adapting at a incredibly fast rate

03:55:06.380 --> 03:55:09.260
Which makes me nervous for when it does catch up with the old Scottish accent

03:55:09.660 --> 03:55:14.460
Um, which is why we're probably going to just become multi-cultural and just have like a billion different

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:17.100
things

03:55:18.060 --> 03:55:20.060
Uh, Scottish accent doesn't count

03:55:20.060 --> 03:55:23.660
Hey, literally if you ever look at the closed captions on my streams

03:55:23.660 --> 03:55:27.340
Like especially when I go super scots like I'm mucking about with that accent or whatever

03:55:27.340 --> 03:55:31.420
It it doesn't have an it does not even comprehend one earth. I'm trying to say

03:55:32.460 --> 03:55:36.220
I don't understand it. Um, which I think helps me with all my

03:55:36.780 --> 03:55:40.620
Skirting of the the conversations we may or may not be having

03:55:47.660 --> 03:55:49.660
Mm-hmm

03:55:49.980 --> 03:55:51.980
Okay, I've had some water

03:55:52.300 --> 03:55:56.060
Yeah, in general it happens wherever AI fears the scots. Can you understand us?

03:55:56.780 --> 03:56:02.700
Scottish accent is an enigma to the human brain as well. So I think you're safer a bit until you all become scots with me

03:56:02.940 --> 03:56:04.300
so

03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:10.460
All right, I'm gonna finally open up this bag of raisins. So I commit to eating some of them because I've had them for how long

03:56:11.740 --> 03:56:13.740
Oh, jeez I can't oh, it's

03:56:14.540 --> 03:56:16.540
Oh, okay, we're in we're in

03:56:17.980 --> 03:56:19.980
Oh that smell rather

03:56:20.140 --> 03:56:22.140
My smell of smell smells delicious

03:56:23.580 --> 03:56:28.860
All right, let's who wants a chocolate covered raisin and please don't make fun of me for liking chocolate covered raisins

03:56:28.940 --> 03:56:31.820
I really like chocolate covered raisins. Okay. They're a nice snack

03:56:32.380 --> 03:56:34.380
um

03:56:34.940 --> 03:56:36.940
Oh, no, there's shit

03:56:37.900 --> 03:56:39.900
I spent so much money on the

03:56:40.620 --> 03:56:42.620
really shit

03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:50.540
No, this can't be I spent so much money on it. Can you be shite? I'm not loving it to be shite

03:56:52.620 --> 03:56:55.580
Yeah, the reason reasons are nice. You guys don't like raisins

03:57:00.140 --> 03:57:01.900
Oh

03:57:01.900 --> 03:57:08.780
I'll tell you something that might filter you from me. I like oat and raisin cookies. I actually think they're the bee's knees

03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:13.660
You get a nice buttery oate cookie. It's delicious

03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:17.740
You get filtered get filtered get filtered

03:57:20.300 --> 03:57:23.180
I think they're nice. You get a nice buttery homemade one. They're so good

03:57:27.660 --> 03:57:29.660
Hmm

03:57:32.460 --> 03:57:38.140
I think some variant of scots was used in world war two for announcements so the germans couldn't keep up

03:57:38.300 --> 03:57:41.500
That's hilarious. You know that you've no been talking on this. Have you?

03:57:44.300 --> 03:57:50.220
Those aren't rabies raisins she be was over earlier. Oh my god. This is like completely off topic

03:57:51.420 --> 03:57:53.820
I think I've said this before maybe I haven't

03:57:55.260 --> 03:57:59.420
When I was a child I used to poop like rabbit poop

03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:02.460
And you may be like what?

03:58:02.540 --> 03:58:06.540
Yeah, and my my little poopies look like little rabbit poops

03:58:06.700 --> 03:58:11.580
I don't know what the heck was wrong with me as a child, but I just thought you should know that fun fact

03:58:14.140 --> 03:58:16.540
And now you know you're cursed with the knowledge

03:58:17.260 --> 03:58:18.780
um

03:58:18.780 --> 03:58:20.780
I don't know what it means

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:23.740
Actually, you know what let's google it. We're in the

03:58:24.620 --> 03:58:26.620
We're in the age of technology

03:58:27.420 --> 03:58:33.340
Um, let's google it. Why do my I look like rabbit

03:58:33.340 --> 03:58:35.340
Um

03:58:38.220 --> 03:58:43.740
Signs of a low fiber diet. Wow. I had no fiber as a child. Am I surprised? No, um

03:58:44.860 --> 03:58:47.180
No, I am not surprised I had any fiber as a child

03:58:48.060 --> 03:58:49.420
um

03:58:49.420 --> 03:58:55.020
I was a bottomless pit as a child. Um, I've been very lucky

03:58:56.380 --> 03:58:59.740
And was blessed with the skinny milinky long legs gene

03:59:00.220 --> 03:59:03.420
Um, but I put it to good use by giving myself a returned butt

03:59:04.220 --> 03:59:06.220
You have no fiber now

03:59:07.420 --> 03:59:10.060
Google's gonna say it's claude or something

03:59:11.420 --> 03:59:14.940
I substituted that word. I know what word you did use but the mall is funny

03:59:16.620 --> 03:59:18.620
Um

03:59:18.700 --> 03:59:20.700
Wait, are you a rabbit in real life? Yeah

03:59:21.420 --> 03:59:25.900
You are not a cull. You are here. I remember it took me so long

03:59:25.980 --> 03:59:29.100
I was like, why on earth did she be called a fan base hero? I don't get it

03:59:30.060 --> 03:59:32.060
um

03:59:34.780 --> 03:59:36.780
I could get it. I don't understand

03:59:41.660 --> 03:59:45.980
Hmm this is a shit cup of tea. I can tell you that much

03:59:48.700 --> 03:59:54.460
I'm definitely adequately fed and warred though. I don't even need the nature valley bar. I don't even need it

03:59:56.460 --> 03:59:58.460
Um

04:00:00.700 --> 04:00:06.300
Okay, thank you for allowing me to do the one of the nastiest burps I've done so far on stream

04:00:06.540 --> 04:00:13.340
Um, and rehydrate and refueling. I no longer feel lightheaded. So we're we're doing good. Thank you for

04:00:14.540 --> 04:00:19.900
Putting up with me. I know some people don't like eating sounds. Uh, do apologize if that is not your hang

04:00:20.380 --> 04:00:21.900
um

04:00:21.900 --> 04:00:28.460
And I completely look at different strokes different folks. Okay different tickles of pickles and all that jazz. You know how it works

04:00:30.620 --> 04:00:31.980
Who's that?

04:00:31.980 --> 04:00:35.180
You can do better. I trust you. I don't know if I could freaking out do that

04:00:35.740 --> 04:00:39.500
The the biggest burps I have is when I eat because I get trapped wind as a swallow

04:00:40.380 --> 04:00:45.100
Thanks for the stream mom my fish. Good luck when meeting. Bye. Bye. We eat me getting ready for stream

04:00:45.740 --> 04:00:48.620
Yeah, you're getting ready for stream. We eat me. I bet you are

04:00:53.260 --> 04:00:55.260
Strokes and pickles cool knowledge of you

04:00:55.900 --> 04:00:59.420
I'm okay with your burps. You're conditioning me towards it. That's terrible

04:01:00.860 --> 04:01:04.620
I prefer the aid burping so disgusting this entire agency burps. Yeah, okay

04:01:05.260 --> 04:01:07.740
You don't burp. You don't burp when you're at home. Chief

04:01:08.220 --> 04:01:11.020
You have to remember we sit in our bedrooms memeing on games

04:01:11.740 --> 04:01:13.820
But what makes you think we're uncomfortable here?

04:01:14.700 --> 04:01:17.260
From around these parts we burp with our mouth wide open

04:01:18.220 --> 04:01:22.460
I don't know where you're from where you're all you all got your your little uh manners

04:01:22.780 --> 04:01:28.380
You got manners and stuff chief get your manners out of here. They did you know manners are set and I'm just

04:01:30.220 --> 04:01:33.180
Burping makes you real you need to more spinach or whole grains and

04:01:33.580 --> 04:01:37.820
General also I found out during the mid-diet granola bars are terrible for nutrition

04:01:38.300 --> 04:01:39.820
Oh, are they?

04:01:39.820 --> 04:01:44.620
I freaking bought some for stream for when I do endurance days with I can't like I can't make foods

04:01:46.540 --> 04:01:48.540
That food literally

04:01:49.020 --> 04:01:51.180
Did you know AI so advanced I can make music now

04:01:51.820 --> 04:01:55.820
It was only a matter of time. Oh, there will be there will be a song made out of only my burps

04:01:56.540 --> 04:02:01.020
I actually so obviously in the day and age of AI technology

04:02:02.060 --> 04:02:09.500
Um, obviously it is a very hard field to navigate because of the implications of how many jobs it can take and how many

04:02:10.060 --> 04:02:12.060
livelihoods it um affects

04:02:12.540 --> 04:02:13.820
um

04:02:13.820 --> 04:02:16.860
And I am no exception. Um, you know

04:02:17.820 --> 04:02:25.740
If you want to be like mega serious the biggest example of like AI taking your jobs as v-tubers

04:02:25.820 --> 04:02:28.540
There's none other than uh neurosama

04:02:29.180 --> 04:02:37.180
And people like thousands of people watching AI to stream. Um, it's quite it's really magnificent if you look into it

04:02:37.180 --> 04:02:39.180
It really is um

04:02:39.180 --> 04:02:42.860
But like it obviously, you know artists, you know artists any like it

04:02:42.940 --> 04:02:47.420
I mean freaking hell me for example, like I didn't really want you to feed my voice

04:02:48.300 --> 04:02:55.820
And then I did consider possibly AI singing of my voice because I cannot sing um due to

04:02:56.860 --> 04:03:04.220
Um vocal damage. Uh, unfortunately, I've damaged my vocal cords successfully. Um in all my journeys that I

04:03:06.780 --> 04:03:09.100
I can't sing the way others can sing, you know

04:03:09.180 --> 04:03:12.940
Um, if you didn't know you can't actually train yourself to sing over time

04:03:13.180 --> 04:03:18.060
But I have like perma damaged myself and I've nerfed myself basically

04:03:18.780 --> 04:03:23.180
So I did think I did think like would AI song be

04:03:24.140 --> 04:03:28.700
Acceptable in that instance because I can't produce what the song is but I can feed

04:03:29.500 --> 04:03:35.100
An algorithm my voice to make that song and then it makes it sound like I'm singing type thing. Um

04:03:35.340 --> 04:03:36.540
Um

04:03:36.540 --> 04:03:38.060
But then I'm like

04:03:38.060 --> 04:03:44.060
No, because that's kind of like it's it's a very interesting like morals are coming into economies coming into it

04:03:44.460 --> 04:03:50.300
Everyone's got a wee piece and a wee side thing. Um, and it's very curious. I'm I'm interested to see where it's gonna go

04:03:50.780 --> 04:03:56.940
It's very nerve-wracking as a content creator. However, um, because um

04:04:00.140 --> 04:04:03.900
Content creation basically relies on

04:04:05.740 --> 04:04:08.540
People to fund it. Um

04:04:09.500 --> 04:04:14.460
type thing like obviously I'm a bit different because I'm already like self-funded if that makes sense. Um

04:04:16.700 --> 04:04:23.340
But like if people were to like just straight up stop supporting and being like well this AI posts it for free exactly what I'm looking for

04:04:23.420 --> 04:04:25.180
It's like these are real people

04:04:25.180 --> 04:04:32.060
But then you could start to argue like well that happens with any sort of medium like if there's a better competitor that comes up

04:04:32.060 --> 04:04:35.260
Well, yeah, they've lost out on their business and their pension and their business shuts down

04:04:35.500 --> 04:04:37.500
That's just the way it is in this market

04:04:38.140 --> 04:04:39.100
um

04:04:39.100 --> 04:04:41.580
So it's kind of hard to even get into a real

04:04:42.380 --> 04:04:48.220
Mitty bit of whatever the conversation might be when it comes to AI because there's so many nuances that can come up

04:04:48.540 --> 04:04:52.380
But these nuances are valid in the conversation topic. Um

04:04:53.100 --> 04:04:58.380
It's a double edged sword really it can help smaller game studios or indies produce games faster

04:04:58.700 --> 04:05:03.500
On the other hand it can put others out of business. Yes, the creative field

04:05:04.140 --> 04:05:06.140
it it's very

04:05:07.340 --> 04:05:13.260
Obviously we're kind of aware about the sinister nature of what AI has been up to recently with creating um

04:05:14.220 --> 04:05:18.620
fakes which is a shame because I don't think anyone should be subjected to that. Um

04:05:19.820 --> 04:05:23.020
You know, I'm I mean obviously as a creator

04:05:23.980 --> 04:05:27.340
I mean I have a bias and I'm like if no one wants that stuff out there

04:05:27.340 --> 04:05:31.020
Don't put it out there if they delete it then let it be deleted type thing

04:05:31.660 --> 04:05:35.340
Um, but that's just my two cents. Um, but I

04:05:35.980 --> 04:05:42.220
I'm aware that on the other side of a viewer being like this person provided me a lot of comfort these videos provided me a lot of comfort

04:05:42.940 --> 04:05:45.020
and

04:05:45.020 --> 04:05:49.340
Yeah, the world ends when AI can write software that actually functions at a high level without tweaking

04:05:49.740 --> 04:05:51.740
I'm about to tweak it

04:05:51.900 --> 04:05:59.020
Uh, I can burp in without holding my hand in front of me. I got hit too much on the back of my head when I was young from

04:05:59.500 --> 04:06:01.500
Oh, sorry. You got whacked as a child

04:06:02.300 --> 04:06:04.300
That's not good

04:06:04.700 --> 04:06:10.300
Did you know it actually throws your nervous system out if you get whacked as a child for correction reasons

04:06:10.940 --> 04:06:14.940
Content creation is enjoyed for the creator's personality or knowledge. So I doubt AI

04:06:15.340 --> 04:06:20.540
Well, see you say that but then my counter argument is Neurosama right now

04:06:21.980 --> 04:06:23.980
Thousands of people watching

04:06:24.940 --> 04:06:28.060
Algorithm essentially a machine learning algorithm

04:06:28.700 --> 04:06:30.220
um

04:06:30.220 --> 04:06:32.220
It's fascinating. It's really fascinating

04:06:32.700 --> 04:06:35.340
It is and obviously, you know, you can be like

04:06:35.900 --> 04:06:39.980
Oh, you're just to be here. You're mad because bought it bought doing better than you and it's like no

04:06:39.980 --> 04:06:42.780
I'm trying to I'm trying to explain the side of like

04:06:43.580 --> 04:06:46.140
This is a a machine

04:06:47.660 --> 04:06:49.660
That has been programmed

04:06:50.620 --> 04:06:55.740
Blade blade runner blade runner there there. That's how I'll connect the dots blade runner

04:06:56.460 --> 04:06:58.460
How about that?

04:06:58.540 --> 04:07:00.540
you know

04:07:00.780 --> 04:07:02.780
I think AI is an inevitable

04:07:02.780 --> 04:07:03.980
It needs

04:07:03.980 --> 04:07:09.500
It's very it's probably what I think is going to happen with AI is it's going to explode

04:07:09.660 --> 04:07:16.700
Everyone has access to it. Then laws and regulations catch up to the explosion, but the damage will already have been done

04:07:16.940 --> 04:07:18.460
I think

04:07:18.460 --> 04:07:25.660
That is what's going to happen my the reasoning. I think it is a blow up and then catch up but damage is done

04:07:26.940 --> 04:07:28.700
YouTube

04:07:28.700 --> 04:07:31.660
In the internet as a whole starting off as baby

04:07:32.620 --> 04:07:39.820
Everyone is catching up to what in real life laws there are because the internet and in real life are two different things

04:07:39.820 --> 04:07:41.820
I think we can all agree on that

04:07:42.220 --> 04:07:45.980
And a reflection of this is the current ongoing

04:07:46.700 --> 04:07:47.820
card

04:07:47.820 --> 04:07:51.100
Sorry, my throat was burping card payment processors

04:07:52.060 --> 04:07:54.060
They are actually

04:07:54.780 --> 04:07:57.500
catching up to almost in real life

04:07:58.460 --> 04:08:00.220
laws and things

04:08:00.220 --> 04:08:06.460
And it's not treating the internet differently. So one of the biggest examples right now is patreon is no longer allowing

04:08:07.340 --> 04:08:09.340
um

04:08:10.060 --> 04:08:12.780
artwork that depicts um

04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:17.100
Any possibility of cnc

04:08:17.740 --> 04:08:20.780
Even though the artworks are artworks and not real people

04:08:21.500 --> 04:08:27.820
But that's because mastercard is bending their arm behind their back because of in real life laws

04:08:27.980 --> 04:08:32.220
Like the internet is being caught up to in real life laws. Does that make sense?

04:08:32.300 --> 04:08:33.740
Hopefully that makes sense

04:08:33.740 --> 04:08:40.780
Doesn't the people watch uh dj and stuff like pranksters you use an ai to enhance your content wouldn't be that bad in the grand scheme of

04:08:41.900 --> 04:08:48.380
Yes, but I didn't what what what makes me hold back from aiing my voice to do song covers is

04:08:49.020 --> 04:08:51.660
One it loses its charm because it's not my croaky voice

04:08:52.380 --> 04:08:53.260
two

04:08:53.340 --> 04:09:02.300
It's it's not a statement of endorsement. No, however, I think it's definitely a like, uh, that's a shame she uses ai

04:09:03.420 --> 04:09:05.420
cncio

04:09:05.660 --> 04:09:06.860
content

04:09:06.860 --> 04:09:08.860
uh con con

04:09:09.500 --> 04:09:12.620
Is what cnc is someone someone type I can't type what it is what you

04:09:13.420 --> 04:09:18.940
Laws become uh antiquated fast even when they do come out. Yes, it's um very interesting to see how the

04:09:19.420 --> 04:09:26.460
Interwebs are being navigated at this moment in time. Oh, I lost it because I was reading we got 72 000 pop. That was fantastic

04:09:27.820 --> 04:09:29.100
um

04:09:29.100 --> 04:09:30.460
Yeah, it's a

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:35.180
I like the deep diving in the convo is like this. I know like people like shout out shout away

04:09:35.260 --> 04:09:39.820
Oh, I don't want to get into it. I don't want to get into it. I want to get in a I want to see what your thoughts are

04:09:39.820 --> 04:09:44.060
I want to tell you what my current thoughts are you might change my mind. We might come to a different thing

04:09:44.060 --> 04:09:47.260
We may talk about this. I don't mind talking about these things

04:09:47.660 --> 04:09:52.300
I think it's nice. I think it's refreshing being able to talk about it. But I mean, that's for me

04:09:53.180 --> 04:09:55.260
Fake version of that. I am she's making winds with

04:09:58.620 --> 04:10:00.620
I don't I can't even translate that

04:10:01.980 --> 04:10:03.980
but yes, um

04:10:04.060 --> 04:10:06.060
l'ma the least ethical players are

04:10:06.860 --> 04:10:10.220
Are stealing their data. Yeah, I think a france

04:10:10.700 --> 04:10:11.900
um

04:10:11.900 --> 04:10:18.140
A french like art school got done for using AI and it was like the most ironic moronic thing and everyone was like, bro

04:10:19.580 --> 04:10:26.060
The AI conversation goes into politics easily. It's because the laws need to actually catch up, which I think maybe

04:10:26.460 --> 04:10:28.460
um, why?

04:10:29.260 --> 04:10:31.260
Probably leaks into that a lot

04:10:32.380 --> 04:10:34.380
But anyway, what do I know? I'm just

04:10:34.780 --> 04:10:39.740
Uh, a cuttlefish that wants to drown all of humanity to he what happens if it wasn't humanity

04:10:40.220 --> 04:10:45.260
Oh, sorry, someone wants to trade my apologies. Hold on. Let me make space. Hold on. Let me just connect these winds

04:10:45.740 --> 04:10:48.300
What's going on here? What's going on here? Right? What's going on here?

04:10:48.940 --> 04:10:52.380
Oh, you give me a what wait? Why is that worth 15k for that one wine?

04:10:53.500 --> 04:10:54.460
What is

04:10:54.460 --> 04:10:56.460
half full wine jug

04:10:57.340 --> 04:11:01.820
What wait, can I half drink? Why is that so much money? Am I going crazy?

04:11:04.300 --> 04:11:06.300
Wine of jug four

04:11:07.100 --> 04:11:09.100
Oh

04:11:09.500 --> 04:11:12.060
Half wine jug 18k

04:11:13.340 --> 04:11:15.340
Infinite moneymaker glitch

04:11:16.140 --> 04:11:20.300
Question mark. Can I like half drink these wines and make like a stupendous amount of money?

04:11:23.420 --> 04:11:25.420
Um

04:11:26.060 --> 04:11:28.060
Am I going crazy?

04:11:28.380 --> 04:11:34.620
Half wine. Why how do I get half a wine? Can you drink used drug used jug? Sorry

04:11:34.940 --> 04:11:39.020
No, dang it. Wait, how do you do half?

04:11:41.020 --> 04:11:43.020
What that's bizarre

04:11:43.660 --> 04:11:45.660
What is it?

04:11:45.820 --> 04:11:51.100
How do you get half you have 25 million? Why do you need look we're here to be billionaires so we can

04:11:51.820 --> 04:11:56.140
bribe the politicians to put in stuff that's actually against it for our interests

04:11:57.260 --> 04:12:03.740
It's a rare item that comes with events. How bizarre. Okay. It's the same reason burnt fish sells for something. Oh, I guess

04:12:04.620 --> 04:12:09.580
Well, it's main. No, thank you. Or do you want the wine back? You're allowed to have it back. By the way, you can just ask

04:12:10.860 --> 04:12:13.420
I'm not actually going to keep it. I'm just surprised. I didn't understand

04:12:15.900 --> 04:12:19.420
A brave politician. Oh as long as it interests their bank account

04:12:20.460 --> 04:12:26.140
And uh, you can pretty much pass whatever you want. As long as you got the the funds to cough up

04:12:28.140 --> 04:12:32.940
Which is why velour is going to be a billion dollar enterprise so we can change the world

04:12:33.020 --> 04:12:37.980
I'm just kidding. We are just anime girls on the internet. We're looking for some ink. Okay

04:12:39.420 --> 04:12:41.420
Yeah, it's called lobbying. Yeah

04:12:42.060 --> 04:12:45.820
And not the good kind of cod lobbies the bad kind of cod lobbies

04:12:46.700 --> 04:12:51.980
Back in my day wine used to be drunk in two gulps leaving behind the half wine after

04:12:52.780 --> 04:12:54.060
We're getting old

04:12:54.060 --> 04:12:59.340
We're getting oh, sorry. Just put that momentary again. We're getting og old scoop lore

04:12:59.580 --> 04:13:03.340
Geez, can I finish the sense right? I'll finish this cup of tea before I finish my next sense

04:13:05.100 --> 04:13:07.100
Vealers already changed me for sure

04:13:07.900 --> 04:13:09.900
Is it black croc? I've changed show but

04:13:11.100 --> 04:13:15.660
Strani's opinions do not represent veal or yes, I have to say that like unironically every stream

04:13:15.900 --> 04:13:21.500
Please do not be like Strani said this so I'm not supporting any of the girls. One. Don't be a fucking pussy

04:13:21.900 --> 04:13:24.540
Of course, I do not speak for all the girls. You absolute

04:13:25.260 --> 04:13:28.300
Um and two

04:13:30.460 --> 04:13:33.980
Why am I not let's go on an autistic rant by everyone else's there'll be rude

04:13:35.340 --> 04:13:37.340
Is it because I'm Scottish be honest

04:13:41.180 --> 04:13:44.620
On the original older version game the wing joke is upwards of 40 bell

04:13:46.780 --> 04:13:48.780
Literally let me go on my right

04:13:49.740 --> 04:13:54.620
What's these things I'm uneducated about and have a little opinion on what oh you shouldn't talk because

04:13:55.020 --> 04:13:58.540
Because oh you shouldn't have an opinion on things. You're not educated

04:13:58.780 --> 04:14:02.220
Uh, what do you think having a brain is about? Uh, what do you think about the learning is about?

04:14:02.540 --> 04:14:04.540
You know, you can present your information for me

04:14:06.220 --> 04:14:09.020
What you struggling with what concept do you struggle in with quick quick quick?

04:14:09.020 --> 04:14:12.140
What concept are you struggling with tell me and I'll talk about it later, bro

04:14:13.100 --> 04:14:18.140
Sorry, I'm arguing with people that aren't even they aren't even here. There aren't there's no one in this room right now

04:14:18.220 --> 04:14:22.140
There's no one seeing anything mean at all. I'm just arguing with potential

04:14:22.380 --> 04:14:25.420
Arguers. I'm absolutely losing it. I'm so sorry reef lens

04:14:26.380 --> 04:14:27.900
anyway

04:14:27.900 --> 04:14:29.900
Why ain't anyone

04:14:31.740 --> 04:14:36.300
I'm absolutely losing it me at the convention just straight up swinging on reef lens

04:14:37.180 --> 04:14:39.180
Oh, no, that's such an

04:14:39.260 --> 04:14:43.820
Unmeaned thought I don't like that idea on my head. She's arguing my ghost

04:14:44.780 --> 04:14:46.780
You want me to take your meds?

04:14:48.460 --> 04:14:50.460
Arguing with the voices

04:14:50.860 --> 04:14:54.220
She's arguing with the restless spirit of her toenail rip toenail

04:14:55.420 --> 04:14:57.100
It's um

04:14:57.100 --> 04:15:03.580
Not as bad as I I thought I I pushed I I would I would confess my sin

04:15:04.460 --> 04:15:07.340
I pushed through the bandage to see what I'd feel

04:15:08.540 --> 04:15:10.140
um

04:15:10.140 --> 04:15:13.500
I'm not gonna push it for a while because one that hurt uh ow

04:15:13.820 --> 04:15:14.780
and two

04:15:14.780 --> 04:15:16.780
Ow and three

04:15:17.260 --> 04:15:22.540
I don't I couldn't really tell what I feel. I think it just feels like touching a normal flesh really

04:15:24.620 --> 04:15:26.620
And

04:15:27.340 --> 04:15:30.140
But yeah, definitely not touching it again for a while because that's done

04:15:30.540 --> 04:15:33.420
I'm on basic painkillers now. Um, it's it's not

04:15:34.540 --> 04:15:37.660
It's really no that bad. It's really no that bad. Um

04:15:38.140 --> 04:15:39.340
Um

04:15:39.340 --> 04:15:43.500
It's probably just gonna be a patience thing now. Um, because it takes forever to heal

04:15:43.500 --> 04:15:47.580
Actually, I should go out in the garden and get some sunlight and me to help heal it off, but

04:15:48.780 --> 04:15:50.780
I want to play rinse

04:15:50.940 --> 04:15:53.660
And then I want to play goose game with mercy

04:15:57.500 --> 04:15:59.500
You can take your frustrations out on us

04:16:00.060 --> 04:16:05.100
Strenuous myths online that all visitors have a voice in their head. I can like argue with myself

04:16:05.180 --> 04:16:09.340
I'm not even being funny. I can just straight up start having arguments with myself about stuff

04:16:09.660 --> 04:16:13.900
Like that's why I like when I do actually go like off the rails on my wee rants a little bit

04:16:14.140 --> 04:16:18.220
It's because I'm in my head. I'm talking to someone that doesn't believe it

04:16:19.180 --> 04:16:23.980
And I have to explain it from the start like as if you were an alien and you've never heard about this before

04:16:24.220 --> 04:16:28.540
And I'm like and that's why I'm always like and another thing and another part of this like, yeah

04:16:29.340 --> 04:16:33.900
Your britain d levels are probably in the gut. No, the sun is too dangerous for me

04:16:34.060 --> 04:16:36.060
I need to go back to pale scotland

04:16:37.020 --> 04:16:41.900
Um, I'm actually in danger of the sun if you didn't know, um skin cancer in

04:16:42.540 --> 04:16:44.540
Australia is no joke. We

04:16:45.020 --> 04:16:46.700
We uh, hung

04:16:46.700 --> 04:16:50.620
Oh, wait, I don't think you're not let's say that terminology. My apologies. Don't don't mean to offend

04:16:51.100 --> 04:16:58.140
We pasty white ghosts are actually not really supposed to be on Australia because uh, we are not suited for the sun

04:16:58.780 --> 04:17:00.780
The sun's rays are extra strong

04:17:00.860 --> 04:17:02.300
Um

04:17:02.300 --> 04:17:08.780
And uh, yeah, isn't it winter there? It is but the sun is still very strong. It doesn't matter

04:17:11.580 --> 04:17:15.340
The uv rays just because it's cold it's still there. Oh my god. My freaking tea is cold

04:17:17.900 --> 04:17:21.900
Because I can't stop talking I don't think I've had a warm cup of tea in weeks

04:17:21.900 --> 04:17:23.900
Oh

04:17:32.060 --> 04:17:34.060
Ozzie and kiwi bro suffering from the sun

04:17:35.420 --> 04:17:37.420
Yeah

04:17:37.900 --> 04:17:41.340
Half Aussie half Scottish will you actually no no no full scots

04:17:45.260 --> 04:17:48.380
If you ever want to run a business and you can pick between scotland and

04:17:48.940 --> 04:17:51.580
Australia do it in Australia you get to keep more of your money

04:17:52.620 --> 04:17:56.220
And then go back to scotland. I mean I'm going back to Scotland

04:18:00.060 --> 04:18:06.220
I I my my pasty white people need me um, and we're having the refund farm in scotland anyway, so

04:18:07.260 --> 04:18:08.860
Yeah, it's uh

04:18:08.860 --> 04:18:14.460
Don't get me wrong Australia beautiful country. Love it. Love the sun. Love my chinese auntie

04:18:14.780 --> 04:18:17.580
Love my granny. I love all these people

04:18:18.380 --> 04:18:25.580
But I am not suited for this country. I am I am too used to the most oppressive ways of the uk. I really am

04:18:26.460 --> 04:18:32.140
Got a brew of tea forget about it microwave it then. Uh, do not ever suggest microwaving a tea in my presence

04:18:32.460 --> 04:18:35.500
You have to start are we raising shape?

04:18:36.620 --> 04:18:39.740
The farm needs eggs because we need protein

04:18:41.100 --> 04:18:43.100
um

04:18:43.260 --> 04:18:44.940
I don't

04:18:44.940 --> 04:18:46.060
want

04:18:46.060 --> 04:18:48.860
I think we just need eggs on the farm reflands

04:18:49.740 --> 04:18:51.420
and then we can have like

04:18:51.420 --> 04:18:56.620
I can make like scrambled egg pepper like from peppers and we grew in the garden

04:18:57.500 --> 04:19:02.140
And then that can be our wee breakfast and then lunch can be a wee sangha

04:19:03.740 --> 04:19:06.220
Would we have wheat production and flour?

04:19:07.260 --> 04:19:09.420
Would we have a flour mill on the farm?

04:19:10.060 --> 04:19:13.340
Thousands of chickens to feed us. I think we need like eight

04:19:13.980 --> 04:19:17.100
Hens lay us and and say I did my research on chickens

04:19:17.500 --> 04:19:22.700
I actually did my research while I was away on holiday wink wink um for a year. Uh

04:19:23.900 --> 04:19:26.460
So chickens lay eggs for

04:19:27.020 --> 04:19:32.700
One to five years and then they are considered an elderly chicken and no longer lay

04:19:32.860 --> 04:19:35.980
Most people just perish the chicken when it stops laying

04:19:36.380 --> 04:19:41.020
I couldn't do that if a chicken has given me eggs for five years and it stops

04:19:41.100 --> 04:19:44.780
I am not going to perish it because it can no longer do it. I want it to live

04:19:44.860 --> 04:19:49.900
It's happy little chicken life in the garden. Okay, like um, some people are brutal with their way

04:19:49.980 --> 04:19:55.020
Uh, their wings their chickens. I said, I guess the chickens are our wings roofland. Um

04:19:57.820 --> 04:20:01.900
But yeah, I they like can lay a lot

04:20:02.860 --> 04:20:06.780
There's also the possibility that we would need

04:20:07.500 --> 04:20:13.500
Ducks on the farm because ducks are natural pest control for slugs and stuff

04:20:14.060 --> 04:20:16.860
So for because I I want to go like natural

04:20:17.100 --> 04:20:21.020
I don't want to use like harsh chemicals or anything to like grow production wise like

04:20:21.580 --> 04:20:24.620
Um fertilizers all that stuff that's bad for the environment

04:20:25.420 --> 04:20:29.260
Um, but ducks and chicken are fantastic for getting bugs and stuff

04:20:29.260 --> 04:20:35.500
But the chicken could not be allowed near the crop harvest because chickens will destroy the crops

04:20:35.740 --> 04:20:41.100
However, ducks do not destroy the crops. Um, only chickens destroy absolutely everything

04:20:41.500 --> 04:20:45.980
They can pot their little beaks can get on because they are

04:20:47.260 --> 04:20:49.260
Destructors they also

04:20:49.260 --> 04:20:51.500
Stir up stir up the soil

04:20:51.580 --> 04:20:57.420
So if we need natural fertilizer, you can like just straight up scoop it and shove it on a plant bed

04:20:57.980 --> 04:20:59.980
Then it's pretty good

04:21:00.060 --> 04:21:02.380
Your chicken was eaten by weasels weasels

04:21:03.420 --> 04:21:08.940
Aren't weasels small aquatic animals that are like long like a noodle

04:21:10.860 --> 04:21:13.180
A weasel are weasels, but what?

04:21:14.300 --> 04:21:16.300
A weasel weasel

04:21:17.900 --> 04:21:22.940
A little small on aqua a weasel yoink your chicken isn't the chicken bigger than the

04:21:24.380 --> 04:21:26.380
Weasels are land based

04:21:27.660 --> 04:21:29.660
Oh looks like a little noodle

04:21:31.980 --> 04:21:33.980
That yoink to chicken

04:21:34.460 --> 04:21:36.940
That thing can take down a chicken. It's tiny

04:21:38.540 --> 04:21:41.180
Hold on. Let me pull up the picture. I'm looking at right now

04:21:43.900 --> 04:21:47.500
Uh, they look toy they look like a pet

04:21:49.740 --> 04:21:55.740
If I can pull up a picture anytime now, right hold on. Let's let's go be cheeky picture in

04:21:58.220 --> 04:22:00.220
Hmm

04:22:00.620 --> 04:22:02.620
This is what I see

04:22:04.060 --> 04:22:07.820
This yoink to chicken this that yoink to chicken

04:22:09.420 --> 04:22:11.420
It's tiny

04:22:11.900 --> 04:22:13.900
Unless they're like a lot bigger than I imagine

04:22:16.460 --> 04:22:22.140
Weasels are deadly shut up. These are deadly animals. Look at the freaking look a cutie looks

04:22:23.100 --> 04:22:28.860
I've been trolled humans can yoink ostriches. Oh, well you do actually have a point there hold on a minute

04:22:28.940 --> 04:22:31.580
Hold on that reefland speaking the truth. Hold on pause

04:22:35.820 --> 04:22:37.820
Okay

04:22:41.820 --> 04:22:43.820
They're cute till they open their mouths

04:22:45.660 --> 04:22:47.660
Is that like me a matty?

04:22:47.740 --> 04:22:49.340
Yeah

04:22:49.340 --> 04:22:51.340
Okay, maybe if it's like me a matty

04:22:52.780 --> 04:22:58.300
They look like ferrets. That's not a thought. Do you read the red wall series? There's a reason weasels are the villains in it

04:22:58.300 --> 04:23:00.700
No, I haven't read that actually. I don't know what it is

04:23:02.540 --> 04:23:05.260
I don't know what red wall is but that's okay

04:23:07.020 --> 04:23:08.460
Because I

04:23:08.460 --> 04:23:13.420
Means I can experience media that you guys enjoy. No, you're cute even after opening your mouth

04:23:13.420 --> 04:23:15.420
Hmm

04:23:16.780 --> 04:23:23.500
Rod red wall was game of thrones for kids. That is hilarious as a description

04:23:24.140 --> 04:23:26.140
um

04:23:26.300 --> 04:23:31.660
Is there a cat in here or am I losing it? No, it's the heating. Sorry the heating's come on and it's moving the blind

04:23:31.660 --> 04:23:35.580
And it makes me think that Vigo is on the window, but he's not

04:23:37.580 --> 04:23:40.780
And before a cat jumps up on the table and I get heart attack of a lifetime

04:23:41.340 --> 04:23:43.340
It's trying to you're cute when you open your dash straight

04:23:44.700 --> 04:23:46.220
You're not

04:23:46.220 --> 04:23:48.460
No, you're cute, especially when your mouth is open

04:23:50.300 --> 04:23:52.300
Good

04:23:52.300 --> 04:23:54.300
That's the way I like it

04:23:57.980 --> 04:24:01.420
But yes, uh, I will try my best to

04:24:02.060 --> 04:24:07.340
Actually properly update my youtube because now it looks all terribly wrong

04:24:08.220 --> 04:24:15.900
But it's going to be bulk troll for two hours spout roll. Sorry for two hours. And then it's going to be

04:24:17.820 --> 04:24:21.340
Um member stream for two hours and then that's a four hour day

04:24:21.500 --> 04:24:25.420
Which means I might actually have the energy to edit and do all the things I need to do

04:24:27.260 --> 04:24:29.260
um

04:24:29.740 --> 04:24:31.740
I liked moss flower a lot

04:24:31.820 --> 04:24:36.540
In moss flower there was an evil cat who had a bunch of mercenaries who taxed the forest animals and then

04:24:37.420 --> 04:24:39.420
Other folk went and killed them

04:24:40.220 --> 04:24:42.860
I should actually is robin hood

04:24:44.380 --> 04:24:46.380
This is going to sound so silly

04:24:47.500 --> 04:24:53.180
And if it is silly, it's okay. You can laugh is robin hood like um actually based on a novel that

04:24:53.740 --> 04:24:55.740
and not just that disney tv show

04:24:57.100 --> 04:24:58.780
um

04:24:58.780 --> 04:25:00.780
Because if so

04:25:00.860 --> 04:25:02.860
I'm here for robin hood not gonna lie

04:25:03.660 --> 04:25:09.340
He actually kind of he had a few good points, you know take from the rich that I'll never even notice that that's gone

04:25:10.220 --> 04:25:12.220
It is okay. Maybe we should read that

04:25:13.180 --> 04:25:16.460
Would you replace hypnotica? There's a cuttlefish in the game. Oh

04:25:17.740 --> 04:25:19.820
I might give it a cheeky shot. Um

04:25:21.980 --> 04:25:26.380
I don't know how hard should I play the game blind or should I look up

04:25:27.020 --> 04:25:27.820
gameplay

04:25:27.820 --> 04:25:30.620
So I am not completely clueless

04:25:31.020 --> 04:25:37.180
Because the reason I can play velcro on stream confidently is because I've seen someone play it play it blind

04:25:37.420 --> 04:25:39.820
Play it blind blind. It's fine. Okay. I'll trust you

04:25:40.780 --> 04:25:42.780
um

04:25:43.020 --> 04:25:47.420
I will stick it near the end of july for subnautica

04:25:48.140 --> 04:25:50.140
How about that deal?

04:25:50.140 --> 04:25:53.820
Near the end of july we'll do a subnautica. I'll do it blind and

04:25:54.780 --> 04:25:59.260
We'll see if my fish friends are going to be nice to me at all robin hood is not based on novel

04:25:59.260 --> 04:26:02.380
He's a legendary figure in folk folk lore

04:26:03.020 --> 04:26:07.180
The early stories about him dating back to 14th century were shared through oral traditions

04:26:08.220 --> 04:26:10.220
I'm gonna share some oral traditions with me

04:26:12.860 --> 04:26:16.620
Look I had to think about it on the spot. I couldn't change the sentence up that much

04:26:16.700 --> 04:26:19.100
I mean I kind of lose its potency, you know

04:26:20.140 --> 04:26:22.700
Oh, well, I will I try

04:26:24.780 --> 04:26:26.780
Hmm

04:26:29.740 --> 04:26:34.940
Well the character is in public domain is there a robin hood video game are you thinking that

04:26:36.380 --> 04:26:39.340
Robin Hood, but it's a girl the classic twist

04:26:39.980 --> 04:26:42.780
And then people get annoyed because it's gender changed

04:26:42.780 --> 04:26:48.220
But actually it just brings more publicity and yet again we have fallen for the bruce of the marketing campaign

04:26:50.380 --> 04:26:52.380
We can't escape it

04:26:52.780 --> 04:26:54.780
Fools I tell you fills we are

04:26:57.260 --> 04:27:01.020
Yeah, I'm sure you're skilled in oral traditions. Yeah, I want to find out

04:27:02.700 --> 04:27:04.700
I think I'm doing

04:27:06.780 --> 04:27:08.780
I can't remember what me fucking

04:27:09.900 --> 04:27:12.300
Audio supposed to be that comes out tomorrow

04:27:14.220 --> 04:27:19.260
I can't believe I'm actually gonna have to wake up an hour early for stream so I can edit that and get it all ready to

04:27:19.660 --> 04:27:23.020
Publish because I've not edited it yet because I'm a naughty naughty

04:27:27.740 --> 04:27:31.820
Are we talking about that and fire entire fate franchise fate

04:27:33.580 --> 04:27:43.100
Oh my gosh, we're in the 49,000s. We're no longer in the 50,000. Let's go Omri five. Let's go. Sorry. I timed out because I was reading

04:27:43.340 --> 04:27:44.860
Hey

04:27:44.860 --> 04:27:51.900
Congratulations, you just advanced the cooking level. You just advanced our cooking level your cooking level is 85. Let's

04:27:52.780 --> 04:27:54.780
Go. This was my goal

04:27:55.180 --> 04:27:59.580
for today's stream and we did it. I wanted 85

04:28:02.620 --> 04:28:04.940
I'd be self plenty of time for Azor to come along

04:28:05.660 --> 04:28:07.900
You're now a quarter of the weight in a night. Don't

04:28:08.860 --> 04:28:11.260
see such heinous things in my presence

04:28:12.220 --> 04:28:13.660
I am

04:28:13.660 --> 04:28:17.180
Look, if there's any doubters, I'm gonna be honest. I'm doubting a little bit

04:28:17.660 --> 04:28:22.060
We'll see what happens by the end of the movie marathons

04:28:23.420 --> 04:28:25.420
and

04:28:25.420 --> 04:28:29.020
If the movie marathons are fine, we'll see where we are

04:28:30.140 --> 04:28:33.660
But you're making me nervous saying that I'm only one fourth of a way there

04:28:34.300 --> 04:28:37.260
I'm getting a bit shaky and not the good kind because I'm like

04:28:37.980 --> 04:28:39.340
bruh

04:28:39.340 --> 04:28:41.340
This is insane endurance

04:28:42.300 --> 04:28:44.300
I'm not sure like if

04:28:45.100 --> 04:28:48.380
If I finish this batch of 49,000, right?

04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:52.700
Surely that's my 99, right?

04:28:56.060 --> 04:29:00.700
That's 99 if I finish these wine. Yes, you'll be done. Okay

04:29:02.220 --> 04:29:06.140
Okay, I have faith because we started at 53,000

04:29:07.100 --> 04:29:10.540
And we're already in 49 so I have a bit more faith now

04:29:12.140 --> 04:29:18.940
I'm getting my resolve tested roughly 48,000 needs to be done. Right. Okay. If it's 48,000

04:29:19.580 --> 04:29:21.820
I can I can do it. Okay

04:29:23.260 --> 04:29:24.780
Give me one

04:29:24.780 --> 04:29:30.460
Endurance stream where we watch video games where we watch movies whilst we do this then I think we can do it

04:29:30.460 --> 04:29:33.740
I don't know. Maybe there'll be two back-to-back like movie streams

04:29:34.460 --> 04:29:39.340
Just so I don't have to think and I could be like, uh, grape goes in water jug

04:29:41.340 --> 04:29:43.740
Movie on the bunga basically

04:29:44.860 --> 04:29:46.540
um

04:29:46.540 --> 04:29:49.660
For meme ASMR just read the wiki page on the kingdoms of scotland

04:29:51.260 --> 04:29:55.980
Yes, I am going to do a movie watch along the next time we play runescape

04:29:55.980 --> 04:30:01.340
So I don't have to think basically and we'll see how much we clear in one of those streams

04:30:01.740 --> 04:30:06.220
And we can just enjoy the movies for what they're worth copyright laws. Oh, no, no, no, no, no

04:30:06.620 --> 04:30:09.500
You do not know how we do watch alongs in this house

04:30:11.740 --> 04:30:17.900
We have a timestamp and you're gonna see where we are, but we do not get copyrighted in this house. I assure you

04:30:20.300 --> 04:30:26.220
You'll just have to show up to the runescape stream to see what dastardly plans I have in order to do a watch along

04:30:26.540 --> 04:30:28.540
Hmm

04:30:28.860 --> 04:30:32.300
Blade runner or alien watch along strongly expected us to be mine

04:30:32.380 --> 04:30:37.660
Little didn't know it's gonna be me. That's mine broken by the end of this honestly. I thought 99 cooking was easy

04:30:38.300 --> 04:30:43.340
I'm sorry. I actually genuinely thought it was easy. I take it back. I take it all back. It's not easy. Oh, I hate this

04:30:43.820 --> 04:30:45.500
Well, I don't hate it

04:30:45.500 --> 04:30:47.500
I just I'm like

04:30:47.500 --> 04:30:52.940
Feeling a bit overwhelmed because I'm like, oh my god. This is actually going to I can't believe it

04:30:53.260 --> 04:30:58.940
I can't believe this achievement in runescape takes a while that barely any players have actually achieved

04:31:00.220 --> 04:31:02.860
It's a free 99. Is that why it takes so long?

04:31:03.660 --> 04:31:07.180
And before we could like swap to fletching and get it done when the day

04:31:08.540 --> 04:31:09.900
That would uh

04:31:09.900 --> 04:31:14.780
Actually be pretty hilarious. Just be like, all right. We'll do 99 fletch and write runescape series over when we got a 99

04:31:14.860 --> 04:31:18.140
I'll take it. Cooking actually is one of the most common feels good, man

04:31:19.100 --> 04:31:22.860
See everyone just wants to know how go do agility 99. Absolutely not

04:31:23.580 --> 04:31:29.180
I don't know much about agility, but absolutely not. I know for a fact that's a nightmare one. I think

04:31:30.700 --> 04:31:33.180
Is it rune crafting is a nightmare one as well?

04:31:35.500 --> 04:31:36.940
I think

04:31:36.940 --> 04:31:38.940
thieving if I recall correctly

04:31:39.580 --> 04:31:47.420
Thieving is you pickpocket some guard from level 72 onwards. You just do the exact same thing for ages

04:31:48.140 --> 04:31:53.020
I cannot believe this is what prime runescape gameplay is. I'm so sorry, but it actually is as well

04:31:53.020 --> 04:31:55.020
Like it doesn't get better than this

04:31:55.260 --> 04:32:00.460
It doesn't get better than looking into your inventory pulling stuff out putting it back in again

04:32:01.260 --> 04:32:03.580
Mining is actually pretty bad. Hmm

04:32:05.580 --> 04:32:09.980
Is wood cutting the only one that you can like actually or is it sand crabs?

04:32:10.060 --> 04:32:13.500
Is it sand crabs you can afk like you're attacking damage on?

04:32:14.140 --> 04:32:17.980
But you still do need to be on standby or something. I can't remember

04:32:18.380 --> 04:32:23.100
I don't think there's any true afk like unless you count like hitting a tree

04:32:23.820 --> 04:32:25.100
afk

04:32:25.100 --> 04:32:27.100
um, I don't know

04:32:27.100 --> 04:32:29.580
You can afk the knight in combat easy. Oh

04:32:31.580 --> 04:32:35.740
Peak gaming, uh, I prefer pyramid plunder to arby knights, but each of their own

04:32:36.460 --> 04:32:38.220
ardy knights

04:32:38.220 --> 04:32:40.220
You can do alchemy

04:32:43.500 --> 04:32:44.700
I

04:32:44.700 --> 04:32:51.180
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think maybe once we hit 99 runescape. I'm definitely taking a big break from it

04:32:51.260 --> 04:32:55.980
I do genuinely thoroughly enjoy the game. I wouldn't mind doing questing again

04:32:56.060 --> 04:32:58.540
I actually thoroughly enjoyed doing the quest with everyone

04:32:59.100 --> 04:33:00.060
and

04:33:00.060 --> 04:33:05.500
I do not have much experience with the quest and plots so I wouldn't mind doing it like um

04:33:06.220 --> 04:33:11.580
At some point, but I'm talking like this is probably august if we're gonna if we're gonna runescape 99 this

04:33:12.060 --> 04:33:14.460
It's probably august until the next runescape

04:33:15.420 --> 04:33:17.420
content comes out because

04:33:17.900 --> 04:33:20.380
It's um, although the questing would be fun

04:33:21.020 --> 04:33:25.820
You gotta go members request. The real question is without help at what point should we be, you know

04:33:27.100 --> 04:33:30.700
If you didn't have help and did like if you

04:33:33.180 --> 04:33:37.340
And you did like barbarians like salmon maybe if you did salmon

04:33:37.340 --> 04:33:39.340
I

04:33:39.740 --> 04:33:42.220
Mean if he did it whilst I was like streaming other games

04:33:42.380 --> 04:33:48.300
You probably would be near the same level if not farther than me because I've just been grinding on other games

04:33:48.380 --> 04:33:50.380
baby

04:33:55.820 --> 04:33:58.860
I have grown so sleepy after eating all that food

04:33:59.980 --> 04:34:03.500
I'm like man. I could really use a nap before this collab. I don't I don't want to

04:34:04.460 --> 04:34:08.380
I don't want to I want to put make more progress towards my level

04:34:10.060 --> 04:34:13.500
But then again if we're doing like 12 or a shift to watch movies then

04:34:14.460 --> 04:34:16.620
It's not even a shift. Let's be honest

04:34:17.420 --> 04:34:22.860
What did you do for your work today? I did backbreaking work stacking shelves was doing the chill

04:34:23.260 --> 04:34:26.700
The tells had to like clean up like spillages and all that. What did you do?

04:34:27.100 --> 04:34:32.140
Oh, I watched movies while leveling up on old school runescape. Oh

04:34:33.100 --> 04:34:36.300
Like come on come on mate. Get real

04:34:37.740 --> 04:34:44.300
New runescape is like 10 times easier, but the levels are go up to 120. Do they not which is like four times 99

04:34:45.900 --> 04:34:47.900
Unless I'm misunderstanding

04:34:48.860 --> 04:34:51.980
Well, you already reached your goal for today. Do you want us to tempt you to sleep?

04:34:51.980 --> 04:34:57.500
Don't because I think I might actually take a nap. I'm like, well if I need to be full strength for

04:34:58.380 --> 04:35:05.900
Mercy's collab. I'm like if I go how about if I take it to nine o'clock is she be gonna be on at nine or she be on now?

04:35:07.980 --> 04:35:12.860
Oh, I don't want to I don't want to um be a silly billy

04:35:16.620 --> 04:35:18.780
Naps kind of ruined my sleep she'd be live now

04:35:18.780 --> 04:35:24.220
I know she's like, but she's gonna be alive for like another 30 minutes if I round it up to nine a.m

04:35:24.220 --> 04:35:29.900
Which makes no sense for anyone not in my time zone if I round it up for another 25 minutes ish

04:35:31.900 --> 04:35:33.100
Um

04:35:33.100 --> 04:35:38.220
The modern version of the game you get a million xp an hour in the slayer skill and you can get like maybe 50 k an hour on here

04:35:38.220 --> 04:35:40.220
Oh, wow

04:35:40.300 --> 04:35:42.300
You are not messing around

04:35:44.140 --> 04:35:46.140
You can sleep am I ask she be

04:35:47.100 --> 04:35:49.100
Yeah, can um

04:35:49.420 --> 04:35:54.060
Can someone be very kind and bump into she be streaming just say

04:35:54.620 --> 04:35:59.580
Strongly wants to redirect to you in 20 minutes. Will you still be on question mark?

04:36:00.540 --> 04:36:03.820
Uh, I will appreciate it if you notice someone else has already typed that message

04:36:03.900 --> 04:36:08.300
Please don't spam or chat too much because I don't know. I don't know how in sync the reeflings are yet

04:36:08.380 --> 04:36:14.460
I mean you guys are actually pretty in sync. You think you think that yesterday, which means pretty entertaining

04:36:16.700 --> 04:36:18.700
Uh, yes

04:36:20.300 --> 04:36:26.540
I am very tempted for a nap. I've eaten all that food and I'm like I'm unironically barely full of mead and

04:36:27.180 --> 04:36:32.940
Like getting sleepy. This happened last time I played runescape. I think this is just such a like peaceful relaxing game

04:36:33.820 --> 04:36:35.820
It looks like she's just chatting. She's

04:36:36.700 --> 04:36:38.700
She said to late pee don't know

04:36:39.500 --> 04:36:41.500
Give her a pee don't

04:36:42.460 --> 04:36:46.460
So I can redirect into her in 20 minutes. She says probably till late. What's that mean?

04:36:49.100 --> 04:36:51.100
Yes, or no she be a young in 20 minutes

04:36:51.980 --> 04:36:53.260
Yes, I know

04:36:53.260 --> 04:37:00.060
Tell me she be right. I'll take that as a yes. I'll just make sure I redirect and then I'm going for a nap

04:37:03.100 --> 04:37:07.820
And where are you? Oh, Amy's playing with her palace at the level

04:37:08.780 --> 04:37:14.140
Hopefully she's having a good stream together with her. I need to learn her name out of respect

04:37:15.500 --> 04:37:21.900
I'm such a forgetful. Well, she hasn't even started the game yet. Oh, she's not even started. Oh, okay. That's hilarious

04:37:21.900 --> 04:37:30.380
Yeah, I'll it's safe to redirect into sheepsters. Um, right. We will do our 20 more minutes of wines

04:37:31.100 --> 04:37:34.060
and then I'm going to be a cheeky sod and go for a nap and

04:37:34.300 --> 04:37:35.420
uh

04:37:35.420 --> 04:37:39.020
Wake up. Maybe I can edit an ASMR in time. Um

04:37:39.820 --> 04:37:45.580
But my eye, I kid you not my eyes are like, um, yeah sleep sleep. I love sleep. That's a yappy dome

04:37:46.620 --> 04:37:50.620
It's very easy and at 90 if you do members trees, you can afk for like 20 minutes at a time

04:37:50.620 --> 04:37:52.620
Tastes like two weeks more though. Ah, okay

04:37:53.900 --> 04:37:55.900
It's afk though, it's good

04:37:57.020 --> 04:38:02.700
Oh, I need to pee pee because I actually put liquids in my body for once

04:38:04.060 --> 04:38:08.380
I can't believe it. I can't believe hydrating means that you have to pee. It's a terrible cycle

04:38:08.940 --> 04:38:14.780
Terrific one. Wow, this has been four hours. Yes. Sorry if you had anything important to do

04:38:16.620 --> 04:38:18.620
Hope I haven't distracted you too much

04:38:21.820 --> 04:38:24.940
Because I'll level in over here or just stand on a boot

04:38:25.500 --> 04:38:30.060
I assume the the reeflings that stand about like outside have already achieved these kind of things

04:38:30.780 --> 04:38:32.940
And they're just like them just happy to be here

04:38:34.140 --> 04:38:37.180
Because you could be level enough casually on the side, you never know

04:38:42.140 --> 04:38:45.580
You'll be eeping. Don't worry the collab vods will stay up. Um

04:38:47.420 --> 04:38:49.980
Mersey doesn't have a warning. She's actually been very good

04:38:50.540 --> 04:38:54.700
YouTube has not given mersey a warning so I have faith that the vod will not be taken down

04:38:55.340 --> 04:38:58.300
Um, and like I don't really see anything too outrageous

04:38:59.260 --> 04:39:03.820
My main account got wiped. I'm giving up on runescape. Oh, no

04:39:05.580 --> 04:39:09.740
How does an account get wiped if it got hacked they reset it but give you it all back?

04:39:10.780 --> 04:39:12.780
Like they reset the stats

04:39:15.100 --> 04:39:18.060
I don't even know how you'd wipe an account. I don't like your bank, I guess

04:39:19.820 --> 04:39:21.580
Hmm

04:39:21.580 --> 04:39:26.060
Brand new account because of you. No, I'm in it. You're in it too deep. Yeah, I got resets

04:39:26.700 --> 04:39:29.660
I mean, they should get your name back though, but that sucks

04:39:33.180 --> 04:39:39.740
That's all right, our say so cool. Hi, literally mersey the goodest girl. She's like the one I don't have to worry about ever getting banned

04:39:41.100 --> 04:39:44.620
She's just so good. I bet you she does come out with some stuff. I just have no clue because

04:39:45.420 --> 04:39:47.420
when she streams is

04:39:47.500 --> 04:39:51.740
I can catch icy in the morning if I wake up before streams, but recently I've been waking up

04:39:52.700 --> 04:39:56.060
Oh, I was up so late last night waiting for this

04:39:56.540 --> 04:40:02.940
Fuck and file to upload so I can send it to the editor to test her out and see if we're a good fit for each other

04:40:03.660 --> 04:40:07.500
I sent her a women joke. So I hope she doesn't get offended by it

04:40:08.060 --> 04:40:10.300
someone clipped me in the

04:40:11.260 --> 04:40:13.260
legend is Zelda stream

04:40:13.420 --> 04:40:15.660
And so someone was like, oh those

04:40:16.460 --> 04:40:20.860
Those rope jewels always freaked me out as a child because they just take your money or something

04:40:21.340 --> 04:40:23.500
And ask it in the way they read it

04:40:23.820 --> 04:40:27.420
The way they said it was like something along the lines of and then I went oh

04:40:27.580 --> 04:40:29.740
Isn't that just what women are or something like that?

04:40:30.220 --> 04:40:36.860
And I sent the joke. So if I get fired as a commission, I know what I know what a clip was the one too far

04:40:40.460 --> 04:40:45.020
Yeah, someone clipped it and I was like, oh, you know what turn that into a joke and I'll see what happens

04:40:45.500 --> 04:40:47.500
and

04:40:47.580 --> 04:40:52.060
To I explained like oh, this is what the enemy looks like in the video game. That was me

04:40:52.700 --> 04:40:58.780
Yeah, well, I can see your clips. I'm not kidding your clips helped out like I went through my clips and I had a few more to send over

04:40:59.420 --> 04:41:07.580
I sent an audio clip of a someone in the other stream was like, oh, you cannae you cannae clap

04:41:08.780 --> 04:41:11.740
Your cheeks basically and then like I stood up and instantly did it

04:41:12.220 --> 04:41:14.700
I've sent that to be edited in a clip

04:41:14.780 --> 04:41:20.220
So I don't know if this chick's going to be running for the hills when she realized what I've asked her to make for me

04:41:20.620 --> 04:41:23.980
Or if she's like going to be like solid and be like, oh, this is hilarious for me

04:41:24.380 --> 04:41:29.260
Because it's probably quite drastically different from like the regular stuff she gets commissioned for

04:41:29.900 --> 04:41:32.700
And I'm just like, oh, here's me. Here's an audio sound of my

04:41:34.220 --> 04:41:40.540
Basically as I I stand up like it's so silly. So either she'll be down or she won't but she's Aussie so

04:41:40.780 --> 04:41:42.780
I don't actually

04:41:43.100 --> 04:41:44.380
um

04:41:44.380 --> 04:41:47.900
Expect any issues because Aussies are pretty humorous

04:41:48.300 --> 04:41:52.780
Uh got pretty good humor not the clip of the being the boy you're cute

04:41:54.060 --> 04:41:56.060
I wouldn't edit it be like that's cheeky

04:41:56.940 --> 04:42:00.300
And it probably goes through so many emotions when receiving the videos. Yeah

04:42:01.500 --> 04:42:05.340
Uh Aussie internet is terrible. I uploaded

04:42:06.060 --> 04:42:08.380
and

04:42:08.380 --> 04:42:11.980
So, you know youtube shorts. So take mercy shorts, for example

04:42:12.220 --> 04:42:15.980
I have to send off what is known as an mov file, which is

04:42:16.460 --> 04:42:22.940
A full transparent file off to the editor the problem with mov files. They are absolutely

04:42:23.740 --> 04:42:29.100
Humongous for no reason and no need now. I know you might say why don't you use green screen?

04:42:30.540 --> 04:42:35.820
Look at the color of my hair in my outfit. Why don't I use green screen? Don't ever talk to me again. It's such

04:42:36.460 --> 04:42:38.460
useless and I'm just gonna um

04:42:39.500 --> 04:42:43.340
So it's just easier to send mov files like emmy for example

04:42:43.420 --> 04:42:48.700
You say, huh emmy emmy can use a green screen actually emmy can't she has a green jewel on her necklace

04:42:48.940 --> 04:42:57.100
Can't use green screen. Anyway, so I it was like 7 p.m. I was getting 8 p.m. I'm waiting for this file to upload

04:42:57.180 --> 04:43:02.140
I'm like please upload so I can send this per chicken audio of me clapping without my hands

04:43:02.860 --> 04:43:04.460
I was getting

04:43:04.460 --> 04:43:10.220
Exhausted and I was like I'm gonna have me fucking sleep and me energy for runescape and then obviously as soon as I came online

04:43:10.300 --> 04:43:17.340
I'm like, hi guys like I have all the energy in the world. I kid you know, I leech energy from refunds. It's true because seriously

04:43:18.380 --> 04:43:21.900
Billy more, you know blue screen exists too. What's blue screen?

04:43:23.180 --> 04:43:26.700
What if I tell you that you can't clap will you give us another demonstration? No

04:43:27.340 --> 04:43:29.340
I have to only do once

04:43:29.340 --> 04:43:30.380
Cheeky

04:43:30.380 --> 04:43:37.020
Um, I sent away five like pre-made edit shorts type things and then I sent away like seven

04:43:37.420 --> 04:43:44.220
Stream clips that I thought were mildly humorous two of them might not be able to be turned into a clip due to the nature of them

04:43:44.300 --> 04:43:52.380
just like some moments are funny on stream, but they cannot be translated into a youtube short because there's not enough context

04:43:52.380 --> 04:43:56.220
There's not enough time and you're limited to less than 59 seconds

04:43:56.380 --> 04:44:00.620
Basically less than a minute. Sorry blue screen is like green screen, but blue. Oh

04:44:01.500 --> 04:44:06.620
Sorry, I understand what you're saying. Yes. No, I don't know what you mean, but like it's just

04:44:07.020 --> 04:44:10.140
MOV files are just to go to the the easiest to

04:44:11.660 --> 04:44:18.700
Thingy, but anyway, I got it sent off is the long and short of it. Um, and I got pretty poor sleep unfortunately

04:44:19.660 --> 04:44:20.540
Oh

04:44:20.540 --> 04:44:26.540
Cuz I didn't get my my full eight hours. Oh, no. I didn't get ever sleep. I'm a little by me

04:44:26.940 --> 04:44:31.980
And as much as I'd like for you to visit with Jeremy don't come here the internet quality and price are horrible. Oh

04:44:33.020 --> 04:44:38.900
My dad went to Berlin and he absolutely loved it. And he was wanting to go back to Berlin

04:44:38.900 --> 04:44:43.260
I might be doing a Europe tour with my dad on ironic clue. Um

04:44:43.660 --> 04:44:44.780
Um

04:44:44.780 --> 04:44:51.660
It depends what happens next year. Um, my dad might officially be retiring depending on if

04:44:53.980 --> 04:44:57.500
You know if I do you're done basically paying for his retirement long story short

04:44:57.900 --> 04:45:02.620
Um, but I was wanting to celebrate it if he does retire and I was like

04:45:03.180 --> 04:45:05.180
Do you want to go on a european tour?

04:45:05.420 --> 04:45:12.300
Because my dad likes traveling around europe like he really likes the multiculturalism of all even though

04:45:12.300 --> 04:45:14.780
He cannot speak speak a lick of any

04:45:14.940 --> 04:45:16.220
Um

04:45:16.220 --> 04:45:21.020
He cannot speak a lick of any of the languages nor does he bother. He's like the oh

04:45:21.340 --> 04:45:22.860
He my dad is polite as anything

04:45:22.860 --> 04:45:23.900
He's like, oh, hello

04:45:23.900 --> 04:45:28.220
And then he'll point to the menu with a smile on his face and doesn't say anything else and I was like, oh, okay

04:45:28.300 --> 04:45:29.420
okay, dad

04:45:29.420 --> 04:45:30.700
um

04:45:30.700 --> 04:45:37.020
But uh, he wants to go back to germany. So I might actually be in germany at one point to be crazy

04:45:37.980 --> 04:45:42.700
Congrats on whoever loved it. I also came back after I love you and break just to watch the call fish

04:45:43.420 --> 04:45:45.820
I'm dragging yous back into the runescape home

04:45:46.860 --> 04:45:52.220
Probs are proud dad. Yeah, he wants to go to berlin because he loved it. I absolutely loved it

04:45:53.100 --> 04:45:57.500
I can't remember what mom and dad did in berlin though. No before anyone makes any jokes

04:45:59.180 --> 04:46:04.380
I don't want to know what my parents get up to when they're alone in a foreign city. I do not want to know

04:46:05.180 --> 04:46:06.620
Um

04:46:06.620 --> 04:46:10.780
I think they did like the classic tourism stuff in berlin. I don't know

04:46:11.580 --> 04:46:13.580
If they went anywhere

04:46:13.900 --> 04:46:17.100
Because I think my mom's pal came along as well. I'm just trying to remember

04:46:18.460 --> 04:46:23.500
But my mom and my mom's pal went off to go visit some of the

04:46:24.700 --> 04:46:27.900
a monuments like, um

04:46:29.180 --> 04:46:31.420
Outfits and that just to like get all the

04:46:32.380 --> 04:46:35.820
Cause like you can go see like all this the stuff and that

04:46:36.220 --> 04:46:40.620
Um, I think my dad was just alone in the city and he went away for some food and that and the thingy

04:46:40.940 --> 04:46:45.180
And just like laughing at the thought of my dad being alone being like, I love you guys

04:46:45.820 --> 04:46:47.820
God and yeah

04:46:48.060 --> 04:46:52.460
A bit of ironing like uh, uh the thought of my dad trying to speak german of

04:46:53.900 --> 04:47:00.060
Why berlin is the ugliest city? Well, let's say it's where the tourists go and I mean there's all is it's very easily accessible

04:47:00.060 --> 04:47:05.980
It's very, uh, English-ified as well for tourists and you have to understand tourists like familiarity

04:47:06.060 --> 04:47:09.820
So if there's a place that's like, oh, there's got English things about they're gonna be want to go there, you know

04:47:11.660 --> 04:47:13.660
Uh, oh god

04:47:13.980 --> 04:47:15.740
Spotted in europe

04:47:15.740 --> 04:47:21.660
Well, there is the possibility of like going to italy because I want to go and see

04:47:22.300 --> 04:47:24.300
Roma and I want to go see

04:47:25.180 --> 04:47:28.380
Uh venice all because of assassins creed. Yes. I said it

04:47:28.380 --> 04:47:35.180
Yes, I want to go to roma and assassin's creed and uh venice for assassin's creed

04:47:35.420 --> 04:47:40.140
No, I don't care if that makes me some weeb gamer. I don't give a shit. I want to see it. I want to see it

04:47:41.420 --> 04:47:43.420
um

04:47:43.420 --> 04:47:45.420
Going to hamburger to eat the first hamburger

04:47:45.420 --> 04:47:49.340
I don't know if the girls are trying to convince me to come to america. Like I'll do it for them

04:47:51.180 --> 04:47:57.980
Because azura was like I can't I was at azure sheebie one of them was like, oh, I'll take you out to like either

04:47:58.060 --> 04:48:02.540
I'll take you out or I'll make you like a decent. I think azure is actually like a decent cook

04:48:02.780 --> 04:48:06.140
I can't remember. I might be a zura. I might just be making that up and I'm going to get sprang

04:48:06.540 --> 04:48:08.540
most likely the last option

04:48:08.540 --> 04:48:10.300
um

04:48:10.300 --> 04:48:13.980
Germans also don't like speaking german. Yeah, if you go to germany visit

04:48:15.980 --> 04:48:22.060
It's basically a disney castello. Oh my feature revealer. You are an anime girl on the internet. You are the weeb. Ah

04:48:22.860 --> 04:48:24.860
I always say I'm a gamer over a weeb

04:48:25.260 --> 04:48:26.140
and

04:48:26.140 --> 04:48:33.980
Like azura her freaking anime knowledge is like limitless. Holy crap. I'm like, uh, I just play expo 360 games to be honest

04:48:33.980 --> 04:48:37.260
And I'm stuck on the nostalgia of them because I like familiarity

04:48:38.060 --> 04:48:43.500
Uh, although saying that and each of her means I get to like try games for the new time

04:48:43.580 --> 04:48:49.180
Like I will not stop talking about it buckshot relay and needy streamer overload

04:48:49.580 --> 04:48:53.900
These kind of games that are actually smaller in length are so

04:48:55.420 --> 04:48:56.460
um

04:48:56.460 --> 04:49:00.060
Appeasing to the streamer profile if you will

04:49:00.860 --> 04:49:07.660
It's why I'm interested in producing games that are roughly no more than four hours in length like wrap it up

04:49:08.220 --> 04:49:11.020
Wrap it up. I don't I don't want to be playing the same game for like ages

04:49:11.500 --> 04:49:13.500
I think it is very uh

04:49:13.660 --> 04:49:18.540
Obtainable to streamers kind of this four hour thingy, which is why I came up with a cookie clicker game

04:49:18.860 --> 04:49:22.140
That's actually completable. Um, if you didn't know they're

04:49:22.860 --> 04:49:27.740
Uh, the the the og cookie clicker game. Um, it's not completable

04:49:28.220 --> 04:49:34.060
Um within four hours unless, you know, wall hacks are on are you doing 360 noscopes through the map?

04:49:34.700 --> 04:49:35.820
um

04:49:35.820 --> 04:49:39.980
Which is why I concepted a game for the first time in my life like that

04:49:40.540 --> 04:49:41.500
um

04:49:41.500 --> 04:49:47.580
Obviously making via lures games kind of giving me a bit of an insight of what happens, but the reality is I've been very hands off

04:49:47.660 --> 04:49:50.060
I just explained what I wanted and what I needed

04:49:50.620 --> 04:49:56.700
Um and paid for it. Um, I ordered the artwork and stuff. I got some I got an artist that was comfortable with all body types

04:49:56.860 --> 04:49:57.740
um

04:49:57.740 --> 04:49:59.740
mersey actually previewed

04:50:00.140 --> 04:50:02.140
her scene artwork

04:50:02.220 --> 04:50:05.180
If you want to check out mersey's alt, um

04:50:06.700 --> 04:50:10.940
It's currently getting animated right now and then I need to cut up everyone's voices

04:50:11.500 --> 04:50:14.140
And then the game's pretty much ready to ship. Um

04:50:14.780 --> 04:50:18.540
Wait, I don't know how long this animator is going to take. I do not know the animator

04:50:18.620 --> 04:50:24.220
They were outsourced by the developer for me because I didn't have anyone that did this kind of thing

04:50:25.340 --> 04:50:30.780
Um, but it's been a fantastic learning experience behind the scenes of being like I want this I want that

04:50:30.860 --> 04:50:35.820
I will do this you do that and then we just you know and came together with the games there. Um

04:50:36.620 --> 04:50:38.620
Our save file is a thing in this game

04:50:39.580 --> 04:50:41.580
And the VLR game no you don't need a

04:50:42.860 --> 04:50:44.860
Oh, there is actually

04:50:45.980 --> 04:50:48.540
You get rewarded if you replay the game

04:50:50.300 --> 04:50:55.500
I I specifically wanted a 20 minute experience. I think it's maybe each round

04:50:56.060 --> 04:50:59.580
Like finish it. I think it takes like 30 minutes to go over like the

04:51:00.540 --> 04:51:02.540
to finalize the

04:51:02.860 --> 04:51:06.540
Situation I want to be vague on purpose because I don't want to spoil it

04:51:07.100 --> 04:51:10.300
Um, but the more you replay it the more you can unlock

04:51:11.580 --> 04:51:16.220
Something and not scenes you have access to all of the scenes right off the bat

04:51:16.860 --> 04:51:18.860
If you through your first playthrough

04:51:18.940 --> 04:51:23.340
But for people who enjoyed it or just want to see you know what the other stuff is

04:51:23.820 --> 04:51:30.380
There is a small amount of replayability. Um, and it was a bit important to have a bit of replayability because

04:51:30.780 --> 04:51:34.300
Um, yeah, no one I mean 30 minutes and then you're done. I mean

04:51:34.940 --> 04:51:36.060
Yeah

04:51:36.060 --> 04:51:38.700
Can you save in the game? I assume so

04:51:39.900 --> 04:51:43.100
Uh, the game is free to play but I think you can save your progress

04:51:43.100 --> 04:51:46.380
So if you are looking forward to a certain

04:51:47.100 --> 04:51:54.140
Scene or animation with one of your favorite girly pops from velour then uh, yes, I believe you can access that right away

04:51:54.780 --> 04:51:56.620
um

04:51:56.620 --> 04:51:58.620
Resident evil you think I play

04:51:59.580 --> 04:52:05.020
It do you know it cost millions to develop these kind of games you think I had millions in my back pocket

04:52:05.100 --> 04:52:10.220
No, it's a free to access game. I've got cute little artwork to go with it

04:52:11.740 --> 04:52:16.540
Girls are voice acted at the cost through this much like okay. Can you save in game? I don't know

04:52:17.340 --> 04:52:19.340
Was there a hoon for it? I don't know

04:52:19.980 --> 04:52:22.540
I really need a pee but I'm about to end stream

04:52:23.420 --> 04:52:29.660
Ah, I can't believe it the peeler allegations. Oh, I can't do it. I actually really need a tinkle now that I know

04:52:29.660 --> 04:52:31.660
All right. I've got eight minutes. I can hold on

04:52:32.380 --> 04:52:37.740
Oh my god, it's not pee. It's a two. Oh, it's both. It's both at the same time. I'm not gonna make it

04:52:39.020 --> 04:52:41.340
So you're super excited millions of gp

04:52:42.460 --> 04:52:47.980
You don't have millions. How are you gonna buy the castello? Um, I'm gonna work for it

04:52:48.940 --> 04:52:53.820
I will I'm gonna work hard for it. I need to pay my ASMR debts

04:52:53.820 --> 04:52:59.180
I need to pay my ASMR collab debts because there's three girls still waiting on my dang edit and I do apologize

04:53:00.060 --> 04:53:02.140
But I did record my lines, which is the best part

04:53:04.300 --> 04:53:06.620
Pixely rpgs games remind me of

04:53:07.740 --> 04:53:11.820
Wow pixel games. Oh, that's so cool. What pixel? Oh

04:53:13.100 --> 04:53:15.100
pixel

04:53:15.180 --> 04:53:17.180
Pixel oh, that's amazing

04:53:18.860 --> 04:53:20.860
Hint hint cough cough nudge nudge

04:53:22.540 --> 04:53:25.020
For the gameplay. Anyway, not the actual art. Um

04:53:26.300 --> 04:53:28.300
Working on things in this economy

04:53:29.340 --> 04:53:31.340
No, I say we steal a castello

04:53:32.620 --> 04:53:39.100
Well, we just steal castello santian. We can live in italy surely are the lines fairtile in italy

04:53:40.060 --> 04:53:46.700
Shawnee take the mic where you go. No, not yet. As I said, azura has to pass the baton to me if azura doesn't pass the baton

04:53:47.660 --> 04:53:53.340
I can I am confirming or denying the aligank the aligankies the aligankies um

04:53:54.380 --> 04:53:56.380
of peeler

04:53:57.260 --> 04:53:59.260
Uh

04:53:59.980 --> 04:54:04.780
Working on things in this. I know I need to work hard. She works hard for the money

04:54:05.820 --> 04:54:07.020
and

04:54:07.020 --> 04:54:10.060
I need to do azura and ac script next

04:54:10.220 --> 04:54:15.020
That's probably one of my top priorities because I want everyone to be 5k by the end of this month

04:54:16.860 --> 04:54:18.860
um

04:54:18.860 --> 04:54:20.860
And at least 5k

04:54:22.940 --> 04:54:28.140
I'll see what happens if I can get some editors to do some clips of the girls and fart some money into them

04:54:28.140 --> 04:54:30.140
But me me editors they're gone

04:54:30.940 --> 04:54:35.500
All of them are like one of them's like i'm sick other ones like uh, I've got in real life stuff

04:54:35.660 --> 04:54:39.020
Other ones let my pc just fucking explode and i'm like, okay. Thanks. Um

04:54:40.780 --> 04:54:43.820
We're getting hints. I feel so special and sorry for all the rooflings out here

04:54:44.300 --> 04:54:47.820
I always give like a little peeper preview or something in between streams

04:54:47.820 --> 04:54:53.980
It's just as a a special thank you for like listening in because I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea type thing. Um

04:54:54.860 --> 04:55:00.940
But uh, thank you for tolerating me. Here's some insider knowledge that you everyone gets to know about in about a month's time

04:55:02.380 --> 04:55:07.660
You know, I can't I can't stop yapping and releasing all my projects. Okay. I just get so excited

04:55:08.780 --> 04:55:10.780
Man, I'm a lot of excitement for my project

04:55:14.060 --> 04:55:16.700
They're all lying. They're all gonna play elton ring. I'm calling it now

04:55:18.700 --> 04:55:20.700
Wait, who's playing elton ring the girls?

04:55:22.140 --> 04:55:24.860
Or did I misunderstand? I mean I misunderstood your message

04:55:25.820 --> 04:55:28.220
That's a very high probability. Thank you for tolerating me

04:55:29.500 --> 04:55:32.140
A month it's so close. Yeah, the the game

04:55:33.180 --> 04:55:36.300
The game production started in february all the everything's there

04:55:36.380 --> 04:55:39.820
We're just waiting on the animation sequence because there's an animation scene

04:55:40.540 --> 04:55:42.540
when you

04:55:44.540 --> 04:55:46.700
Uh, complete the objective

04:55:47.420 --> 04:55:52.060
Um, I think I almost just spoiled the game there. You know that. Um

04:55:53.740 --> 04:55:55.740
Yes, when you

04:55:56.620 --> 04:56:02.940
Do the mission objective? Yep, that's fine to say. Uh, you unlock a scene with a girl

04:56:04.220 --> 04:56:06.220
And you take it from there

04:56:08.060 --> 04:56:11.020
You take it from there you do that now you play one handed

04:56:11.980 --> 04:56:15.180
Um, I'll be very surprised

04:56:17.020 --> 04:56:21.420
Uh, yeah, it's unfortunate how many editors are in disposed as

04:56:23.020 --> 04:56:25.020
scottles lunches

04:56:25.100 --> 04:56:26.780
Yeah

04:56:26.780 --> 04:56:33.580
As a game dev myself, is it cool if I attempt to you can absolutely make a fan game. No problems at all. Um

04:56:34.540 --> 04:56:40.940
I honestly don't I don't I don't know why all these fucking companies have so many rules as long as it's not like derogatory

04:56:41.180 --> 04:56:43.340
Or you're saying shite about the girls like

04:56:45.020 --> 04:56:47.980
It's all good. All your editors are playing elden ring right now. Oh

04:56:49.100 --> 04:56:51.100
probably

04:56:51.500 --> 04:56:54.460
I'll actually have like three guys have a new guy on board. Um

04:56:56.780 --> 04:56:58.780
And just like

04:56:59.740 --> 04:57:02.780
It takes a while, but I'll see how I go with my

04:57:03.820 --> 04:57:10.220
Me me me Aussie editor my girl editor. Actually, I wouldn't mind talking about her on stream if she's comfortable with it

04:57:10.220 --> 04:57:13.420
That sounds really weird though. Hey, can I talk about you on stream?

04:57:15.020 --> 04:57:17.020
The way you edit my clips

04:57:19.660 --> 04:57:23.420
So, okay. All right, you freak give me a moment. Just pay me the money. I'll shut up

04:57:28.780 --> 04:57:30.780
Oh

04:57:35.020 --> 04:57:40.460
No, it's Johnny spoil in the ending. What tries you to someone no, it's not even the ending. There's like there's rounds

04:57:41.580 --> 04:57:47.660
There's rounds and you got pick you gotta pick the girl and there's rounds and if you succeed in your mission objective

04:57:47.740 --> 04:57:49.740
You get to

04:57:51.020 --> 04:57:54.940
Um, there's also it's not really hidden dialogue

04:57:55.020 --> 04:58:01.020
But you can pick the girls in a different order and you'll hear a different line depending on what order you pick them in

04:58:01.180 --> 04:58:03.180
but it's not like a

04:58:03.260 --> 04:58:05.100
Oh, there's like super hidden

04:58:05.100 --> 04:58:09.660
Crazy lore. It's like no you you won't hear that sentence unless you pick that girl in that sequence

04:58:09.820 --> 04:58:12.700
It's that kind of thing. You don't actually miss out on anything and then

04:58:15.980 --> 04:58:21.820
Um for the ending scene unfortunately the ending scene didn't go the way I wanted it to fucked up

04:58:21.980 --> 04:58:23.980
Um

04:58:24.620 --> 04:58:28.940
But it's all good in the hood. I actually think it's quite adorable. I think you guys will like it rounds like pokemon

04:58:30.140 --> 04:58:34.460
Rounds no, no not like strategy turn base. It's a freak. Yes, boys. Go

04:58:35.340 --> 04:58:38.460
It's trying to break in NDAs motherfucker. I am the NDA

04:58:40.540 --> 04:58:42.140
No, I don't even

04:58:42.140 --> 04:58:47.740
There was a contract signed with the game developer unfortunately because of how much money was passing through the hands

04:58:48.700 --> 04:58:54.220
Um, but I mean it's all I mean everything I've seen what I've seen all looks good to me. Um

04:58:55.580 --> 04:58:59.820
I think mersey's name is actually wrong in the video game right now and I need to tell them

04:59:01.420 --> 04:59:03.180
It's not karam

04:59:03.180 --> 04:59:10.300
I I told you that mersey's name got changed very late in development. It's very possible right now. She's called karam in the game

04:59:11.580 --> 04:59:13.580
I need to check in with the game dev actually

04:59:13.660 --> 04:59:16.940
I've just been running out of time everywhere like everywhere I have ran out of time

04:59:17.340 --> 04:59:23.500
And I'm like it'll settle soon and it will settle soon. I just need to get to the stage where it settles soon

04:59:23.580 --> 04:59:26.380
I'm just not there yet. Like once um

04:59:27.260 --> 04:59:29.740
Especially when my dad comes and sees me

04:59:30.460 --> 04:59:34.060
Um, because I'll be doing those like four hour streams. I have to admit

04:59:34.060 --> 04:59:37.020
It's probably gonna be a lot easier to like keep on top of everything

04:59:37.820 --> 04:59:38.940
um

04:59:38.940 --> 04:59:46.380
But like my plans have an expiration like you know, like aw strongy aren't you stretching yourself too thin doing the 1,000

04:59:47.020 --> 04:59:48.060
uh

04:59:48.060 --> 04:59:51.740
Celebration videos every 1000 one ace more video every 1000

04:59:52.220 --> 04:59:58.220
Yeah, but it ends at a certain point and growth is an infinite like it'll slow down like it's definitely it'll slow down

04:59:58.220 --> 05:00:04.460
There's no doubt about it. I like oh, but what about the um ace more clubs? You're doing what other v-tubers again?

05:00:04.460 --> 05:00:07.580
It's gonna slow down. It's not infinite growth like it's it's

05:00:08.540 --> 05:00:10.700
I have a goal of doing 100 v-tubers

05:00:10.780 --> 05:00:17.340
I can do it all in one month if I really wanted to um or I can take my time and do it over the span of many months

05:00:17.340 --> 05:00:20.220
Like everything everything slows down

05:00:20.460 --> 05:00:22.460
It's just obviously debut happened

05:00:23.020 --> 05:00:27.740
And then everything exploded and now everything's going to slowly come back like once the video game goes up

05:00:27.820 --> 05:00:30.700
Like my next project is getting on a game show for the girls

05:00:31.180 --> 05:00:36.620
And then the next project uh Azura's got her lovely donut song coming up next project like it's not

05:00:37.660 --> 05:00:40.780
It's not like an absolute hammer in like as I said

05:00:40.780 --> 05:00:47.020
We're getting clippers in place now because it was hard to get clippers in place before the girls were producing content because that's not possible

05:00:47.900 --> 05:00:51.900
Um reeflings we aim for a million no no do not aim for a million

05:00:52.140 --> 05:00:54.380
I'll be happy with a play button

05:00:55.100 --> 05:00:59.340
As as myself as strony cuttles and then after that i'm like right we're done

05:01:00.780 --> 05:01:05.660
I mean I'll still keep going but I'm not doing like any more celebratory type stuff

05:01:08.380 --> 05:01:12.220
You spread scrawny scrawny propaganda on tiktok and instagram

05:01:13.820 --> 05:01:15.180
Oh

05:01:15.180 --> 05:01:17.260
Right, okay. It's time

05:01:17.260 --> 05:01:19.260
I need to go for a pp

05:01:20.060 --> 05:01:26.780
Um, I I'm at three million cooking xp. Can you see that you can cooking xp three million?

05:01:28.620 --> 05:01:30.620
Yeah

05:01:30.620 --> 05:01:32.300
That's fantastic

05:01:32.300 --> 05:01:36.060
Okay, I am going to redirect into our lovely

05:01:36.940 --> 05:01:38.940
jubilee

05:01:39.020 --> 05:01:40.300

05:01:40.300 --> 05:01:42.780

05:01:43.820 --> 05:01:46.700
Encrypted or something inscripted or something like that

05:01:47.260 --> 05:01:48.060
Um

05:01:48.060 --> 05:01:52.140
And it's a card game, but it's a bit creepy and thingy

05:01:52.220 --> 05:01:57.180
So make sure you got your blanket on if you get a little scared reefling. Okay. I don't want you to get nervous

05:01:57.260 --> 05:01:59.980
Okay, I'm going to go for the biggest

Um, it's not my usual stream time unless I do a marathon then it is my usual stream time

05:02:18.940 --> 05:02:23.580
Um, but I get the fantastic role of enjoyment

05:02:23.660 --> 05:02:29.260
Sorry opportunity to play with none other than mercy modeste in t-minus four hours

05:02:29.340 --> 05:02:31.820
