Strony! Wait, that's me! You were a pre-selected talent for Vialour, so why did Skitty Cat voice the
audition's open trailer instead of you? Thanks for asking, but the real answer is I'm Scottish mate.
My gen mates already struggle enough to understand me from time to time, so the last thing I wanted
to do was add my accent into the advertisement of the business, okay? But for the meme, here's a bit
of a preview. Want a fresh start in your VTubing career? Vialour auditions are open now until March 31st 2024.
You'll receive a spectacular live 2D mod, and yeah, yeah, you get the point, it's terrible, okay?
