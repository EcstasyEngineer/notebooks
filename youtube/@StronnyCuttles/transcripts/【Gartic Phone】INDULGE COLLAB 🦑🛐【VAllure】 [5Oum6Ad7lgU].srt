1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm live. No one say anything bad because I'm live.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, I'm live. I'm live.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, okay, okay.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is it going?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is it working?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh!

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You two have been kind of lagging in terms of like moving alive.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, it takes like a hot second for me to even

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
appear.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Like when I hit.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Guys, guys, guys, it killed my broadcast room.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You killed your broadcast room?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Right now?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like it suddenly like stopped streaming and then

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
my power wash simulator

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
replay deleted.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm live right now.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm live right now.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm live.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm live.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm live.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My chat is laughing at us.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Chat, I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello, everybody.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're so professional.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's been awful.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How many VLR members

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
do you need

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to do a collab to properly

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
do a collab to properly.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Merci. Well, I'll meet you in your room.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yay, she might need a new room.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hold on.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm just eating arrows called

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
leche live in life.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sip in a ahoritos.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello, everybody.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm gonna go make myself some tea while we're living.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Should I die?

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why?

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why?

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, you're okay. You can go make some tea.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She's like, I'm busy.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, you can fuck this straight.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm gonna go make some tea.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can go make tea.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's fine.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, we need to help Merci.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why did this get first stream on?

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Guys, we have been at this

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for 26 minutes.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We were on Powerwasher

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
for one hour.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And every time we went past

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
four of the girls connecting,

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the connection

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
started timing out for some reason.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But if for some reason

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in Powerwasher,

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if you haven't played the entire campaign,

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it doesn't allow you to have

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
six persons in your lobby.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And it was too late to

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
ship all the coding information

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to send it on

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
on your stream.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so basically,

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shebe rescued.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Shebe was like, right, I'll set this one out.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You guys just do it and we're like, no, we can't do it.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The whole point of this is that we're all together in this.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right?

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't have it, right? Who's got RAF, right?

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Who's got this game? I don't have it.

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was trying my best.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Shebe was like going through the list.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She was flicking them pages like, next page,

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
next page, next game, next game.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Jackbox. Okay, that won't work.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Literally.

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We went, all right, we'll do Jackbox.

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then wait, that requires us

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to screen record the discord.

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm like, we can't have that. We see outrageous things

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the discord. We don't even have a HR department.

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So we can't share.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So then,

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we have a static phone,

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which I've never played before.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's coming in clutch right now.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Amy's currently making a cup of tea.

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Merci

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is just

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
getting

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a room set up for her

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
she accidentally nuked her bot

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
of her

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the collab stream.

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It was a disaster.

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This could have gone

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
any worse.

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So just

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think that's like, pretty on character.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, if someone can insert

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that meme and put all of her hairs on it

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and be like, oh, aren't vTubers cute

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
when they're almost

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
or a little

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's all I'm going to say. Well, you guys

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
can finish the sentence after that.

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But that was

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't? No.

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Not like that.

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The three flings, the snowberries,

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the billion hearts,

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the harem, I remember I was like, okay,

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to be honest when

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the harem told me they were called harem,

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I read it as harem and I was like, that makes

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
no sense for Shiby's character design.

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I did too.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was like, what?

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have a harem

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
of so many people

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that are my little, you know, play things

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and clients and they're my harem

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and that's hair, which is a rabbit.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But it's not a rabbit. Hair and rabbit are different.

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But you know what I mean?

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a good pun.

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a pun, exactly.

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And they're also called harlets.

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Individuals are harlets or harlets.

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I thought you said hairless.

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They're hairless.

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Some of them aren't. I can tell you that.

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Maryse, do you still have that

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
thumbnail, Maryse?

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are we good now?

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Almost.

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Maryse, do you still have

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that thumbnail?

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you just throw up

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on the stream.

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is she going to throw up on the stream?

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is it the are you and what are you streaming?

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, it should default to that.

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you just change to the thumbnail

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and put garlic on,

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm literally telling

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
herself to stream whilst she's streaming.

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
dying.

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I cannot read that.

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh.

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My goodness gracious.

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
When are they too loud?

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, how's the volume?

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, it's my volume.

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can you hear everyone else?

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who said the harlets

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
are waxed in my chat?

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What does that even mean?

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The harlets are waxed.

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I need them to be clean and proper.

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Volume good?

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I see it.

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How do I change the

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
garlic phone?

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
On managed broadcast

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
on OBS?

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We're doing so bad.

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They called.

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We have the column.

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you for the 10

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
members.

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
10 gifts.

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't gift right now.

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is awful.

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Any gift?

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Any gift?

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
2 o'clock.

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, any gifters for my

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
non-monetized?

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, no.

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She, me, and Azur aren't monetized yet.

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, my God.

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm muted.

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was muted the entire time.

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can mute with her.

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We heard you.

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, what is happening?

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, what is this?

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is this stream?

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is awful.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is a

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
fever dream, guys.

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This isn't real.

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We're all in bed.

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't have a garlic phone thing.

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I guess I should change my stuff now.

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What?

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Why do we need to change?

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, you don't have to change anything.

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as the game is on stream, you can change it after stream.

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No one gives a shit what the stream is called.

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As long as we're online right now.

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm just doing it.

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The girl's running around

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
like everything's on fire and I'm like,

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it'll be fine. We're good.

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We're going to play some garlic phone.

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We're going to have a great time.

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think the world is going to end.

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't forget to like and subscribe on this stream

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
if you're enjoying your experience as a viewer.

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Absolutely not.

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Smash that bell to get notifications

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of when you go live.

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I see.

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I see.

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I see.

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I see.

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something.

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, I am.

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Not literally.

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't help myself.

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You love smashing.

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like with the Nigel Thornberry,

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
she just says smashing.

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like that's it, you know?

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are we here?

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
are you here?

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
i'm barely here

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
are you here?

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
i'm sorry for the mess

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
yeah we're here

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
i'm live now

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
we at Veilure have done the holistic approach

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
where none of us will mute

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
so you're just gonna hear

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
everything all at once

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
yeah

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that's how we're all

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
just as a reminder

258
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
my memberships or super chats

259
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
will be addressed at the end of the stream

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
when it's not an absolute cluster

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
of all six of us together

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but yes

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the whole premise of the power washer

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
was i was gonna do a gag and be like

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
oh Veilure isn't doing so well

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we might go bust so everyone

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
put a bikini on and get cleanin

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
well that idea is out the window now

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so instead we're playing Gartik phone

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000

I love it!

512
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thank you. Why is your O.G. kind of such a fat cock?

513
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you think he's funny?

514
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Because he loves me. And he's daggers and slicker with all the love he has for me.

515
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. Man, it's so cheesy. Faster than feet.

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

517
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:49,080
I like that poem. I like that poem. I never was stinky Pete's.

518
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Which is Pete's feet. Oh, may I say it to George?

519
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,080
And then she drew pits.

520
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I can't see. I can't see. Oh my god. That's too good.

521
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Pete's. She's cutting out. Yeah, she's cutting out from you.

522
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
He's screaming so loud. Oh, no, not this one.

523
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Okay, I got it from AC now. I got it from fucking AC. Thank you.

524
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,080
What does that even mean?

525
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,080
When your job is a poo, so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out, it feels good.

526
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
I love hot pees too.

527
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,080
What is this?

528
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Is Amy's stocking?

529
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Every sucker on them hot toes.

530
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Oh wait, is she giving a blow job?

531
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
That's what it looks like.

532
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Percy, what did you draw?

533
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Oh, oh, oh.

534
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Oh my god.

535
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
I love the drills. This is so fucking good.

536
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
The drills are so good.

537
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Oh boy. We are over some pie.

538
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Okay. That's cute.

539
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
I love that. That's a really cute toy.

540
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Is that a cat?

541
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Meow.

542
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Meow winky face.

543
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Okay, it's a winky face. I was like, what is meow us?

544
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I was like, who? No one speaks Spanish. I shouldn't hire anyone.

545
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Speak Spanish?

546
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,080
You're so fucking cute.

547
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Oh, that's good. That's good.

548
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
That's good. I love that.

549
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Oh.

550
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Okay, this makes sense.

551
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

552
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
That's a check out and that's items on the shelves.

553
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,080
I worked really hard.

554
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
I didn't get that.

555
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
This is like a diaper.

556
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,080
I see you understood me.

557
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Oh my god.

558
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Oh, I love the details.

559
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Shut up.

560
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Seriously.

561
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,080
I was coming out of his back.

562
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I was going everywhere.

563
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
I can't.

564
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I had to do the toilet stall gap.

565
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
That's all I see about when I see American memes.

566
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Oh, the toilet is taller.

567
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,080
The toilet is so big you can literally look at people's eyes.

568
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Is it a different version?

569
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,080
We have them closed because it's a private time

570
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,080
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

571
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
It's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

572
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Oh, you're so lucky.

573
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,080
I had people peeking at me in high school through the stalls

574
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,080
and I'm like, can I help you?

575
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Me too.

576
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Is there a check?

577
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Is there a DC check?

578
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Are you in the lobby?

579
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,080
It's going to do it on its own usually.

580
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
No, I'm gone.

581
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
The link should be in the discord.

582
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

583
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,080
They'll see all of our naughty photos

584
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,080
we just sent to each other.

585
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,080
It's mostly memes.

586
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,080
I mean, to be fair, we did share...

587
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,080
We did share some funny memes.

588
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,080
We did share some lucky nudes of ours.

589
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,080
They see my titties.

590
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes.

591
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,080
I was like, this is what Emmy would do.

592
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
This is what AC would do.

593
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,080
The discord is so chaotic.

594
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Also, I did snort out my tea.

595
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,080
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

596
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.

597
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,080
This is what you hear.

598
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Gotta lay off that testosterone.

599
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
It hurts so much.

600
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Are you in game?

601
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I posted the link in the chat.

602
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,080
That's why you guys were in my arms.

603
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
I'm getting another heart beat right now.

604
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Every time she talks.

605
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Avatar nudes are eye around nudes.

606
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,080
What do you think?

607
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Oopsie.

608
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Oopsie.

609
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
I feel like Azura could do a really good

610
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Jennifer Coolidge impression.

611
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Me too.

612
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

613
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Jennifer Coolidge.

614
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?

615
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Jennifer Coolidge.

616
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
I'm such a big titty.

617
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Oh my God.

618
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Oh my God.

619
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Jennifer Coolidge.

620
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
That's so good.

621
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Why are we opening our God for the left way?

622
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
You're a G-boy, they're Razzlers.

623
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Azura!

624
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Drop the base!

625
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Blah, blah!

626
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Azura, click that link in the general discord to re-add.

627
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Is it not letting you back in?

628
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Are you being re-gained?

629
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
No!

630
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
I'm not!

631
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm not!

632
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm not!

633
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Eh?

634
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
What is happening?!

635
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
You're making...

636
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Your make cuts out when you do that Azura, so it just goes

637
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
EW!

638
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
EW!

639
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
EW!

640
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
EW!

641
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
What's happening?

642
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I don't even know what's happening anymore.

643
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
It's constantly loading, it says...

644
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Did you?

645
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
No.

646
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Right.

647
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
It's literally...

648
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Let me do another invite and members.

649
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
I'm sorry.

650
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm sorry.

651
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
Will you guys see the discord if I open it?

652
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Okay, you guys can't see it.

653
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
No, if you do window capture...

654
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
It's open.

656
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I shouldn't see anything else.

657
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I would close the window capture in the OBS just in case.

658
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes, you can open it off.

659
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Are we starting a new lobby?

660
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
A new lobby?

661
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,080
I think we should all invite to this lobby.

662
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
A bit of a...

663
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Lights are too heavy.

664
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Are we going to a different room?

665
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I don't know.

666
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Lights are too heavy.

667
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
What is happening?

668
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I only see one of you.

669
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
No, I'm on my end, sorry.

670
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
A new one?

671
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Ah, there's...

672
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Wait, my voice is in.

673
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Where is it?

674
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Where is it?

675
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Where is it?

676
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Okay, which one should we play?

677
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Which one?

678
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Normal.

679
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Which we just did.

680
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Knock off.

681
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Keep yourself focused.

682
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

683
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Create an animation in a collaborative way.

684
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Icebreaker.

685
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Play with a sentence.

686
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Ask questions and have fun with other drawings.

687
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Exquisite corpse.

688
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,080
Create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

689
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Don't know what that means.

690
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Hold on.

691
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
I have no idea.

692
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

693
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Compliment.

694
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Complete the sketch.

695
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

696
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Masterpiece.

697
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Create a piece of art.

698
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Play in a single turn with no time limit.

699
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I feel like story would be funny.

700
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

701
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Yes, okay, okay.

702
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Story, story, story.

703
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Okay, okay.

704
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
You want to do story?

705
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Okay.

706
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Yeah, let's try story.

707
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,080
What are you doing?

708
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Start writing a story.

709
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

710
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Just a sentence.

711
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Just one sentence.

712
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Okay, okay.

713
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Fuck you.

714
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Do you like write the whole story or no?

715
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,080
No, you have really limited characters.

716
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,080
I don't know it.

717
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
No!

718
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
What did you do?

719
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
There's time.

720
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
There's time.

721
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
15 seconds, love.

722
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Oh my God.

723
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I wanted to write more.

724
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I wanted to write more.

725
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Only write one sentence.

726
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Fuck.

727
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
All these stories.

728
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Shit.

729
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I feel like I should have drowned.

730
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Dude.

731
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
Dude.

732
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Dude.

733
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Dude.

734
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Dude.

735
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Dude.

736
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Dude.

737
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Dude.

738
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Dude.

739
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Dude.

740
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Dude.

741
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Dude.

742
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Dude.

743
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Dude.

744
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Dude.

745
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
Dude.

746
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Dude.

747
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Dude.

748
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Dude.

749
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Dude.

750
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Dude.

751
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Dude.

752
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Dude.

753
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Dude.

754
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Dude.

755
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Dude.

756
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Dude.

757
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Dude.

758
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Dude.

759
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
Dude.

Dude.

762
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Dude.

763
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Dude.

764
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Dude.

765
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Dude.

766
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Dude.

767
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Dude.

768
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Dude.

769
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Dude.

770
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Dude.

771
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Dude.

772
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Dude.

773
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Dude.

774
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Dude.

775
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
Dude.

776
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
What is this?

777
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Something

778
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh, oh the sentence is so small like I want to give a bit more

779
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Me too, but it's too short

780
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
I think I got shorter over time

781
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
I want to be like bibe

782
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I couldn't write until fuck

783
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
What?

784
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
What's that?

785
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Okay

786
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Wow, let's see

787
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Oh no, what?

788
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Fuck

789
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Fuck, I'm so bad at this

790
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm not soft neighboring

791
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Fuck

792
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Her name

793
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
It's funny because like

794
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
I hate this, I can't think of anything else

795
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
The regangs, the snowberries

796
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Fuck my life

797
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
The pin pals

798
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,080
The bleeding hearts and the harem all get to see this unfold

799
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
And we're all just taping like

800
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Fuck it, I don't fucking know

801
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
Wait, is that the fucking

802
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,080
You watch fucking Big Bang Theory

803
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Wait, that's not how you spell it

804
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Paris

805
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Fuck

806
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Give me more

807
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
I need more letters

808
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I need more like

809
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
I can't find anything

810
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
What am I doing?

811
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Writer

812
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
They can't spin song lyrics

813
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
They jerk so hard mother fuckers want to find me

814
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
That sounds like she made me

815
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
No

816
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Did you hear it so hard mother fuckers want to find me

817
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Wait

818
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
I don't know this lyric

819
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
This agency

820
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
We can't just

821
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
This agency

822
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
I spelled it wrong but that's the point

823
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,080
I hate that like they don't give you enough to write

824
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Like

825
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
This is not enough

826
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Bro, fuck off

827
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Oh boy, okay, let's see what's happening

828
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
So how about everybody reads their own story

829
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Whoever did the first line

830
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Okay, cool

831
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Okay

832
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Oh, okay, I go first

833
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,080
In a galaxy far far away there was a goat with big titties

834
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,080
She had so much milkers and started raining milk

835
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Azara then went home to make an empire being milked daily

836
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,080
It was so successful the neighboring kingdoms became champions

837
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
They also wanted so much juicy

838
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Ew cooties, you're not good

839
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Good, good, you're not good

840
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Oh boy

841
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Okay, long time ago in a chemical farm

842
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah

843
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,080
There was a polar bear princess who was trying to fit into

844
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Their love was stronger than any foreign addiction

845
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,080
They couldn't stop chewing on themselves from drinking

846
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,080
They drink so high in my fucking stomach

847
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
I didn't know I would finish it

848
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
I was like, this agency, okay

849
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Ding ding

850
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
That was supposed to be the song like ding ding

851
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Ding ding

852
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Oh my god

853
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Ding ding

854
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Balls so hard

855
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Strani, who was in Paris?

856
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I typed Azara

857
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I typed Azara, I'm sorry

858
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,080
There was a beach of agency that was lit

859
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,080
They all couldn't control their urges to pass

860
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
So they danced the pee-pee dance until they could

861
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,080
And then finally they peed everywhere on the

862
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Floor, the walls, the bed, the kite

863
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,080
We're all full of piss everywhere, but he loved it

864
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
The fact that there was not even a piss prompt before AC came out with that

865
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Literally there was only AC came out with one

866
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
AC came out with one

867
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
AC came out with one

868
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,080
That character added

869
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
This is so good

870
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Okay

871
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Okay

872
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Once upon a time there were whores

873
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
They were the eliters of whores

874
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
A cow from the wild west

875
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
All the really cute cowgirl

876
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Pussycat, so cute, so funny

877
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
So pussywarm

878
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Big bang theory, more like bang bang your mom last time

879
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
You keep my mom out of your home now

880
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
I'm sorry

881
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
10 out of 10

882
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Once upon a time there was a pig

883
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Oh, no

884
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh, no

885
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Oh, no, okay, this one

886
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Oh, no

887
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Please, no

888
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Oh, no

889
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Oh, no

890
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh, no

891
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Oh, no

892
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Oh, no

893
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Oh, no

894
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Oh, my face hurts from blood

895
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Oh, this is so good

896
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Oh, what the fuck

897
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,080
And now you guys know why I rate the scripts in Vila or nothing

898
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Why?

899
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Because we had a zero vote of each other

900
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,080
You were sad because you realized you didn't have a prostate

901
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

902
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
She became so bad

903
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
I hate this

904
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Fuck, no

905
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Pain

906
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,080
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic

907
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Ezra, do you have a make filter on?

908
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
I can never hear you

909
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Turn that mic

910
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Get that SteelSeries

911
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
See that SteelSeries

912
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
I don't have a filter on

913
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Don't have a filter on

914
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
There's no filter on?

915
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
What is happening?

916
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Your SteelSeries filter

917
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Open up

918
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
I don't have a filter

919
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
I definitely can't hear you

920
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
What is happening?

921
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Can't wait for the VOD if they survive

922
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Yeah, these VODs

923
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
They'll be fine

924
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Don't worry about it

925
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
If you guys want to play this one

926
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Or do you want to try another one?

927
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Another one

928
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Please, no more shit

929
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
No more shit in Piss

930
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
No more shit still

931
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
No promises

932
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
No promises

933
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Should we do a compliment?

934
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Compliment

935
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Actions are a mystery

936
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Drawings and sentences are hidden

937
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
You can't hear MercyTest

938
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Sorry

939
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
I was muting because I was coughing

940
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Because I was laughing

941
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
My sides were so badly

942
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Okay, MercyTest complete

943
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Do you want to do compliment?

944
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
What is that?

945
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
We draw on each other's drawings

946
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Basically

947
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I think that would be fun

948
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Wow

949
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
I can't wait to draw so much piss

950
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
That's some basic lines

951
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Start sketching some basic lines

952
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Okay

953
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Let me do this

954
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Maybe I could do some basic lines

955
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Like

956
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Great, now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks

957
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
I just blew that

958
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Picasso

959
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Are you joking?

960
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Who is that?

961
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Fuckers

962
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Do you know exactly what you did?

963
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
No, I don't have the strength to resist

964
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
What?

965
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I got it, I can make this

966
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
I can salvage this

967
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
This is the back legs

968
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
of it

969
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Those huge milkers

970
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
There you go

971
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
You're so dirty

972
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Don't be so dirty

973
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I'll get the girls to tell you off

974
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
if you don't behave

975
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore

976
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
You're so dirty

977
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Rude to me

978
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Wait, am I supposed to finish this off?

979
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Are we supposed to finish it off?

980
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
I think so because it's given us tons of time

981
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Hold on

982
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
I fixed it

983
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I fixed it

984
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Hello

985
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
A big push up bro

986
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Oh my god, I've just made shibby

987
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
What the hell?

988
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
I heard my name

989
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Oh wait, that's the thing

990
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Dang it

991
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Give me the pencil

992
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
There you go

993
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
I saved it

994
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
I saved it

995
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
They give you a lot more time

996
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Yeah, you're to finish it

997
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Okay, I'm fucking stupid

998
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Never mind

999
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
So am I, don't worry

1000
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Saved it

1001
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Oh my god

1002
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Let's put some nice shading in

1003
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
To make this look extra beautiful

1004
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Wow

1005
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Let's put lipstick on them

1006
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
The beauty of nature

1007
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,080
I think

1008
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
I saved it

1009
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
They prank him

1010
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
I think this is the best I got

1011
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I'm good

1012
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

1013
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Come on

1014
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
What the fuck

1015
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
What am I supposed to do?

1016
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Oh these are all

1017
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
The shaft

1018
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Oh, I really know what I want to do

1019
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
But I know I shouldn't do it

1020
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Because we're on YouTube

1021
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
I'm fixing this

1022
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Oh no

1023
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,080
I can't think of one thing

1024
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,080
This is amazing

1025
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Oh wait, maybe

1026
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Hold on, hold on

1027
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
I got it

1028
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
I got it

1029
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Fuck, how do I go back?

1030
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Okay

1031
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
They've got a big head

1032
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,080
This is so fucking good

1033
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Let's fucking go

1034
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
I'm trying so hard right now

1035
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
I can't even think of anything to say

1036
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
I'm trying so hard

1037
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Oh my gosh

1038
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Use your imagination

1039
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Use your imagination

1040
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
There you go

1041
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Look at you all

1042
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm so proud of you

1043
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm gonna kick your head

1044
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Alright

1045
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
We need to be nice to the workers

1046
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Your lap is so cute

1047
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
I see

1048
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Thank you

1049
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
I love you so much

1050
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Aw, that's so sweet

1051
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,080
I think I did mine really well

1052
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Yeah, it's a water bottle

1053
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
That's the best I got

1054
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I need

1055
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
I saved the pair of all sex

1056
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
Did you make it into a dog or something?

1057
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
No

1058
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
I don't know how about you

1059
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Senpai, can you do better? Shut the fuck up

1060
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I love when you do that

1061
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,080
Oh my god

1062
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,080
What is this?

1063
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,080
I got the pair of all sex

1064
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
We can hold on

1065
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
You're asking me not to draw the gynecologist

1066
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
What do I do?

1067
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
What can we do here?

1068
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
What can we do here?

1069
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,080
How do I make this? How do I save this?

1070
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
I need to do this

1071
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
I need to do this all for a minute

1072
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Okay, I won't draw that

1073
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Cause that would be

1074
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Oh my god

1075
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
I just realized

1076
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,080
I'll draw this in the stud

1077
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,080
I'm gonna fucking snip it

1078
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,080
From Star Wars

1079
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Oh wait, no, is it heartbreak on the chest?

1080
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,080
I saved it

1081
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,080
I saved it

1082
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,080
I saw women were less immature than men

1083
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
No

1084
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
I was gonna draw

1085
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
a kuchi or a woman giving birth

1086
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1087
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
I literally don't know what the fuck

1088
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,080
I'm doing right now

1089
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
There we go

1090
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
They need this

1091
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,080
Oh my god, I have time

1092
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1093
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,080
What are you doing?

1094
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,080
What?

1095
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,080
And then

1096
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,080
Pen pals

1097
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,080
Pen pals

1098
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,080
Pen pals

1099
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,080
Quick, quick, quick

1100
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
I'm running out of time

1101
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,080
Oh my god

1102
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,080
This is okay

1103
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,080
This is okay

1104
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,080
These are light ones

1105
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

1106
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
I got it, I got it

1107
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,080
These are light ones

1108
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
I saved it

1109
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
I saved it

1110
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
I saved it

1111
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,080
I saved it

1112
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,080
I think I did a good job

1113
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,080
This is the best I got

1114
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
I ain't got nothing

1115
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
No

1116
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,080
You know what?

1117
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Why do I feel like

1118
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
This is a really specific reference

1119
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,080
And I don't know if anyone's gonna get it

1120
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,080
But there used to be

1121
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,080
A little flash game

1122
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Where your guy was on like a snowboard

1123
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080
I love that game

1124
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
I know what you're talking about

1125
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,080
Someone who literally just drawn that

1126
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080
Literally this is perfect

1127
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,080
That's it, that's the drawing

1128
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,080
Someone says lane raider

1129
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,080
Oh I thought we're just called

1130
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
lane

1131
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,080
What is bear pantsu?

1132
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,080
I thought people were asking me

1133
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,080
To draw a bear wearing underwear

1134
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,080
I was like what the fuck is wrong

1135
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
With you guys

1136
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,080
Cause he had big old pants

1137
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,080
That were fancy

1138
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
You know the story

1139
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,080
You know the story

1140
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,080
I might make that up

1141
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,080
Hydration check girl

1142
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,080
You don't want your balls to shine

1143
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Okay

1144
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
You know the story

1145
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,080
Some water

1146
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,080
He's drooling my balls

1147
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
He had no hair color

1148
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Let me do that

1149
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Do you have a beard? I don't know

1150
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
I drew something

1151
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Yeah you're right

1152
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,080
I don't really know how to do that though

1153
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,080
Can I zoom in?

1154
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,080
No

1155
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,080
Yeah

1156
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
Someone said bear braid

1157
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Braid is pantsu

1158
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
Wait what happens

1159
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,080
No fuck I didn't mean that

1160
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,080
Who drew ball sacks everywhere

1161
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
It's not you shivy

1162
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,080
I only see boobs

1163
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,080
No I didn't draw a ball sack

1164
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,080
I got it

1165
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Who's whispering

1166
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,080
I have no idea

1167
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
What?

1168
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
There is whispering some like

1169
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
Evil incantations

1170
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,080
I'm sorry

1171
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,080
That's not nice

1172
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,080
It was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack

1173
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
100%

1174
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
Why do I feel like this is a lie

1175
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,080
No I didn't draw it

1176
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,080
I'm really drawing over it right now

1177
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
If you guys didn't know

1178
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
Azura's ears actually have

1179
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Gold little jewelry

1180
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
On the end of them

1181
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,080
Pimped out with jewelry

1182
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,080
It's like not a vanity thing

1183
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,080
It's like gifts

1184
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,080
Going for her first

1185
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,080
Bike ride

1186
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Isn't cheating to erase

1187
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Aw fuck it is

1188
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,080
Isn't it cute

1189
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,080
So if you didn't know

1190
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
When a women

1191
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
When a women like tates chat

1192
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
Here we'll have a

1193
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
It goes through the fabric

1194
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
So they'll be like a big lady

1195
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
Oh she's so happy for her

1196
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,080
I know this isn't a piece

1197
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
That looks terrible

1198
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
Get rid of that

1199
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Oh my god

1200
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
What am I doing with my life

1201
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
I was trying to talk about lactation

1202
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,080
Duh

1203
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
This was right before she said

1204
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
Chocolate that was correct

1205
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Milk

1206
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Milk

1207
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,080
Someone's getting a phone call

1208
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Someone's getting a phone call

1209
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
I thought you were drawing a cute bunny face

1210
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Nah they have some titties mate

1211
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,080
Thought I can see

1212
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,080
I have saved

1213
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,080
I have single handedly saved the stream

1214
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Probably

1215
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
This is supposed to be it

1216
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
The liquid

1217
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
The liquid

1218
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
That's cheating

1219
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
That's cheating

1220
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,080
I know what I wanted to draw

1221
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,080
That's nothing

1222
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,080
Fine

1223
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing

1224
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Fine

1225
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,080
I started it and I'm gonna finish it

1226
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
It's me

1227
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,080
Fucking mental

1228
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,080
I don't know

1229
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
I'm already pooped from this

1230
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
It's the old Mac

1231
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,080
Okay

1232
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
Okay

1233
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,080
Okay

1234
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
I would talk

1235
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
But it takes so much brain power

1236
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
To do this and talk

1237
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
Talk

1238
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,080
Kiss your little

1239
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
My cats are fighting

1240
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,080
Stop

1241
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
This is a net

1242
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Ah

1243
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,080
I don't know what I'm doing

1244
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,080
Yeah

1245
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,080
That's a pretty good net

1246
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,080
I think I need to grab it

1247
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,080
How do you spell squelch

1248
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,080
Squelch

1249
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,080
Squelch

1250
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Yeah

1251
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,080
Yeah I am

1252
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,080
Is it the Amazon?

1253
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
Oh my god

1254
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
Is it the reverse Amazon position

1255
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,080
And the girls looking

1256
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,080
What are you drawing?

1257
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,080
What are you talking about?

1258
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,080
Reverse Amazon

1259
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,080
Is it like eBay?

1260
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Yeah

1261
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
That's definitely what she's talking about

1262
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,080
Can they break it?

1263
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,080
Oh my god

1264
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,080
Does anybody need to take a quick break

1265
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,080
Before

1266
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
I'm ready

1267
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,080
Let's do this

1268
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,080
That was yours

1269
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,080
Okay

1270
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Okay

1271
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Aww

1272
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,080
Oh my god

1273
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Oh my god

1274
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,080
Oh my god

1275
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Okay

1276
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,080
Okay

1277
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,080
Okay

1278
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Okay

1279
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,080
Okay

1280
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Someone okay

1281
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
Oh

1282
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,080
It's the same

1283
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
It's the answer

1284
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh that's so good

1285
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
What do you mean you're a bad artist

1286
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,080
That's a very good little bear

1287
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,080
That's beautiful

1288
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,080
He got a boner under the blanket

1289
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,080
And everything

1290
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Oh yeah

1291
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,080
Oh it's the Arthur

1292
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Beautiful

1293
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Okay

1294
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
What else could I draw for this?

1295
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Aww

1296
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Oh

1297
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
Okay

1298
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,080
Okay

1299
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,080

1301
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Bye

1302
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080

I like it

1305
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
I deserve a smoker

1306
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
I'll put it now

1307
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Wait, no the eggs

1308
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Oh my god

1309
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,080
I saved them

1310
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
I lied

1311
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
I didn't save the screen at all

1312
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
If I don't see a snail

1313
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
Oh my god

1314
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080

That's me

1322
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,080
And then there's

00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
I was like get my brain

1324
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Get my brain

1325
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
Get mine broken

1326
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080

Okay

00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
Yeah that looks cute

1331
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
I'm just gonna write more

1332
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080

I don't know what to fucking draw

1523
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,080
Get creative nerds

1524
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,080
Jeez it's not that

1525
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,080
I'm doing that

1526
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,080
Okay miss artist

1527
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,080
I'm playing that

1528
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,080
I'm literally

1529
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,080
It means like I'm just gonna draw myself casual

1530
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,080
And it comes out with like this fucking banger

1531
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
Of a commission it would probably cost like

1532
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,080
500 dollars to do

1533
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,080
And she like bangs it out

1534
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,080
And I'm like oh my god

1535
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
She's like hee hee

1536
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
I'm gonna make a vtuber model hee hee

1537
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,080
I'm gonna ask you

1538
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,080
I wish I could

1539
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,080
I wish I had a finger

1540
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,080
Nerval talent

1541
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,080
Speaking of that someone sent me a fucking marshmallow

1542
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,080
They were like thank you for not tying down

1543
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,080
Your talents

1544
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,080
To the designs that you assigned them

1545
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,080
And they can be more themselves and I'm like

1546
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Yeah well why would I do that

1547
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,080
I was like

1548
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,080
I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic

1549
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,080
Things what the fuck do I need to draw next

1550
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,080
A bleeding heart

1551
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,080
Yeah we're more

1552
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,080
So like building upon the characters

1553
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,080
Rather than

1554
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,080
Changing everything

1555
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,080
Cause in

1556
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,080
Someone rated the vtuber

1557
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,080
They were like the only thing that would have been it better

1558
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Is if you let them design their models

1559
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,080
Like from the start I'm like

1560
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,080
Bro it took me a fucking year to get here

1561
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,080
Like oh my god give me a fucking

1562
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,080
I don't think so

1563
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,080
It's never ever to

1564
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
Draw and rake

1565
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,080
A vtuber model

1566
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,080
You can ask Amy

1567
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,080
She knows how to do it

1568
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,080
It's a lot of work

1569
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,080
Oh my god

1570
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Yeah there's only a select few corpos

1571
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,080
That will let you do that

1572
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,080
Oh shit

1573
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
Man this is rough

1574
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,080
Usually ones that have like artists in house

1575
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,080
Yeah

1576
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
We just

1577
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,080
This is so bad

1578
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,080
Most companies

1579
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
If not all of them

1580
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,080
Say for you

1581
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Will have pre

1582
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
Pre-made

1583
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,080
Pre-made

1584
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,080
So it's not actually standard for people to choose

1585
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Yeah it's really not

1586
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,080
Yeah

1587
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,080
That's why it's usually like cast for the roles

1588
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,080
You have to fit the character

1589
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,080
To the thing more

1590
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
Oh

1591
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,080
It's magic

1592
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,080
Oh

1593
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,080
It's magic

1594
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,080
You know

1595
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,080
There

1596
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,080
What the fuck is that stuff

1597
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,080
It looks like an abomination

1598
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,080
Oh no

1599
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,080
Replicated

1600
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,080
What is this

1601
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,080
Fuck

1602
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Why do you guys have average shit

1603
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Okay

1604
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,080
Now we have to draw it

1605
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,080
Are we ready

1606
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,080
No

1607
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,080
I guess I have to be

1608
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,080
I just

1609
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,080
I have to be ready for it

1610
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Even if I'm not

1611
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,080
It's okay

1612
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,080
Just draw it your way

1613
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,080
Yeah

1614
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,080
Very nice

1615
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,080
I've already forgot

1616
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,080
Which position everyone was in

1617
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,080
This is so bad

1618
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,080
Sorry

1619
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,080
I would talk more but this takes so much brain power

1620
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,080
To do this

1621
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,080
I'm so brain dead

1622
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,080
Like

1623
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,080
I'm reading chat

1624
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,080
I'm reading everything

1625
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,080
But I'm not responding

1626
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,080
I'm so sorry

1627
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,080
I can see everyone

1628
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,080
I'm just really in this

1629
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,080
I feel like I'm just

1630
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,080
Fucking losing it

1631
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,080
Oh my god

1632
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,080
I forgot

1633
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,080
There was a shorter time

1634
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,080
That's far too short

1635
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,080
This is why it's chaotic

1636
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,080
Why was the other one longer

1637
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,080
I don't remember what

1638
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,080
I didn't want to do that

1639
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
Oh my god

1640
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,080
What

1641
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,080
Did someone draw Shiba in jail

1642
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,080
Okay

1643
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,080
Okay

1644
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
I don't know what it was

1645
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,080
Okay

1646
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,080
Oh shit there's like no time

1647
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,080
Fuck the time

1648
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,080
We draw this as fast as we can

1649
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,080
Oh fuck

1650
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,080
No

1651
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
Not like this

1652
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,080
Shit shit shit

1653
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,080
Can't remember what it looked like

1654
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,080
Fuck

1655
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,080
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way

1656
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,080
Cause I don't think I saw it

1657
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,080
There's supposed to be a person in it

1658
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,080
There's already gone

1659
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,080
There's a person

1660
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,080
It's supposed to go really fast

1661
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,080
So it's

1662
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,080
Oh my god

1663
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,080
Okay

1664
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,080
That's easy enough

1665
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,080
That's easy enough

1666
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,080
Oh it's already have

1667
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,080
Okay

1668
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,080
Gotta go fast gotta go fast

1669
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Gotta go fast

1670
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,080
Faster faster oh fuck

Faster

1673
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,080
Oh shit

1674
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Oh my god I am so sorry

1675
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Come on

Faster

1677
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,080
Faster

1678
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,080
Faster

1679
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,080
Oh

1680
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,080
Okay okay okay

1681
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,080
Oh please

1682
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,080
Why is there no black

1683
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,080
Oh no no

1684
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,080
Okay okay okay okay we can do this

Okay okay okay okay

Let's go let's go let's go

1688
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,080
Don't panic don't panic

1689
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,080
The great part is that we are all panicking

1690
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,080
No no no no

1691
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,080
Please

1692
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,080
Give me more time

1693
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,080
What even is that

1694
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
Okay this is easy

1695
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,080
This is easy

1696
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,080
This has to be

1697
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,080
Easy

1698
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,080
Easy easy easy

1699
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,080

Let's fucking go

1701
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,080
Man this looks like shit but oh wow

1702
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,080
Oh fuck

1703
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,080
I mean

1704
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,080
That's close enough

1705
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,080
Oh my god

1706
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,080
That's close enough

1707
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,080
That was rough

1708
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,080
Oh

1709
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,080

1710
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,080
Oh my god

That's amazing

1712
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,080
I love this

1713
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,080
Oh my god

1714
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,080
How does her have all that time

1715
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,080
Okay

1716
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,080
I did not have any time for that

1717
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,080
Yeah I was like this is Mr. Mittens

1718
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,080
At least

1719
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
At least

1720
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,080
At least it stayed a cat

1721
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
At least it stayed a cat

1722
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,080
That did a little campfire

1723
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,080
With all of us together

1724
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
That's so fucking cute

1725
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
That was supposed to be

1726
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,080
That was supposed to be

1727
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,080
That was supposed to be

1728
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,080
We are doing a sacrifice

1729
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,080
We are doing a sacrifice

1730
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,080
Sacrifice

1731
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,080
The dog

1732
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,080
The dog

1733
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Oh we are arguing about the fire

1734
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,080
The angry face

1735
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,080
I can't

1736
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,080
That's so good

1737
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,080
At the end of the day we are all just

1738
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,080
Okay this is good

1739
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,080
This stayed

1740
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,080
Yeah

1741
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,080
That's perfect circle

1742
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,080
That was a good easy game

1743
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,080
He's getting more and more depressed

1744
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,080
What is she doing

1745
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,080
She's not in jail

1746
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
She's at the cage

1747
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,080
I thought she was in jail

1748
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,080
Okay that looks like it

1749
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,080
She is under arrest

1750
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,080
I love this

1751
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,080
He's still got the hooves there

1752
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,080
Help

1753
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,080
That's fucking amazing

1754
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,080
She broke FGO by the end

1755
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,080
Honestly

1756
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,080
He broke it

1757
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,080
He's free

1758
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,080
Oh

1759
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,080
It's one piece

1760
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,080
I was like why the frick

1761
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
Are we just a parent shit

1762
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,080
I was like was someone supposed to be in the boat

1763
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,080
I was like

1764
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,080
Oh no

1765
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,080
Just getting

1766
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,080
Just getting ugly

1767
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Oh my god

1768
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
I fucking can't

1769
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,080
That looked like a fuller punch

1770
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Oh

1771
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,080
She's shooting her piss

1772
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,080
Wait that's supposed to be me

1773
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,080
What

1774
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,080
The piss will revive him

1775
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,080
Oh

1776
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,080
The piss will revive him

1777
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,080
Oh my god

1778
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,080
That was so good

1779
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,080
That was so good

1780
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,080
One more

1781
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,080
Which one

1782
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,080
One more

1783
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,080
Give us one more

1784
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,080
One more

1785
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
What when have we not done

1786
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,080
I don't know

1787
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,080
All the actions are a mystery

1788
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,080
Drawing incidences are hitting during the game

1789
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,080
Secret

1790
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,080
Okay

1791
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,080
I've never done that one before

1792
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,080
We'll try it

1793
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,080
Last run boys

1794
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,080
Last run

1795
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,080
What I can't see what I'm writing

1796
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,080
Oh secret

1797
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,080
How am I supposed to know what I'm writing

1798
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,080
Wait what

1799
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,080
Huh

1800
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,080
Yeah

1801
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Oh no wait you run out of freaking words

1802
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,080
Oh bro

1803
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,080
I can't erase my sense

1804
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,080
I don't know

1805
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,080
What is this

1806
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,080
Oh my god

1807
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,080
What is this it disappears

1808
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,080
Oh we can't see what we're drawing

1809
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,080
What

1810
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
Okay we'll draw fast

1811
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,080
What the fuck

1812
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,080
Okay

1813
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
Hold on

1814
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,080
I don't know I think

1815
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,080
I'm gonna just guess

1816
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,080
Oh no

1817
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,080
What it is where it is

1818
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,080
Oh god

1819
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,080
What the fuck

1820
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,080
Oh no no

1821
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,080
I'm gonna try to draw

1822
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,080
Why is it so hard to draw with a bone

1823
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,080
Ah

1824
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,080
I need food

1825
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,080
These are the past ones

1826
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
Can I

1827
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
Can I go backwards does it work like that

1828
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,080
I didn't give you legs

1829
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,080
Oh sugar

1830
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,080
I think A.C. is somewhere there

1831
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,080
Get out

1832
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
This is

1833
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,080
I have no idea what I drew

1834
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,080
I can't know what those are

1835
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,080
What is this

1836
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,080
Okay

1837
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Okay

1838
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,080
Okay I spelled that all wrong

1839
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,080
No

1840
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,080
I didn't finish

1841
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
What the fuck

1842
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,080
What

1843
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,080
What does that even mean

1844
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,080
What does that even mean

1845
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,080
What the fuck

1846
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,080
I was gonna say

1847
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,080
Okay

1848
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Oh fuck

1849
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Oh fuck

1850
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,080
I don't know what else to draw

1851
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,080
That's exactly what I drew

1852
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,080
I think

1853
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,080
This is a vine reference

1854
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,080
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1855
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Oh fuck

1856
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,080
I locked in

1857
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,080
Did I give

1858
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,080
Wait did I give them bodies

1859
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,080
I don't think I gave them bodies

1860
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,080
Oh my god

1861
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,080
I don't know

1862
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,080
I'm taking a shot in the dark

1863
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,080
Where so you know

1864
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,080
What that is gonna be interpreted as

1865
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,080
And will I stop the creative flow

1866
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,080
Do you

1867
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,080
Stop

1868
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,080
No Amy's got a hoodie here

1869
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
Oh sugar

1870
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,080
I put juice on her

1871
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,080
What the fuck

1872
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,080
I don't even know

1873
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,080
What the fuck I'm doing anymore

1874
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,080
I'm fucking dying

1875
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,080
What is this

1876
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,080
What is this

1877
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,080
Two feet of

1878
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
What

1879
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,080
What is happening

1880
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,080
What is this

1881
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,080
Someone had a stroke

1882
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,080
I hope you're feeling okay

1883
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,080
Make sure you hydrate

1884
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,080
Fuck I didn't have enough time

1885
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,080
To write it

1886
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,080
Oh man how do I even draw this

1887
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,080
This is

1888
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
That's the tongue

1889
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,080
And then this is

1890
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,080
Literally everything

1891
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,080
Wait

1892
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,080
This is so difficult

1893
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,080
Fuck am I drawing

1894
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,080
You need like motion swipes as well

1895
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,080
And a little arrow to indicate

1896
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,080
Yeah

1897
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,080
I don't know what I'm doing

1898
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,080
Yeah there we go

1899
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,080
I think I drew it correctly

1900
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,080
A little bit of lipstick

1901
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,080
Cute

1902
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,080
I don't know

1903
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,080
I just drew anything

1904
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,080
I don't know what I'm doing

1905
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,080
I can't wait to see

1906
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
The end of this

1907
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,080
Yeah this is going to be

1908
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,080
Something else

1909
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
This is going to be fucking insane

1910
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,080
What's going on in the ceiling

1911
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Oh I need to draw it on the ceiling quick

1912
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Oh I think I just got that

1913
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,080
Oh god oh boy

1914
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
I'm so scared of what these look like

1915
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,080
Same

1916
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,080
Oh my god

1917
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,080
What the fuck

1918
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,080
It's the end of the TikTok

1919
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,080
TikTok

1920
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,080
Oh my god

1921
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,080
Oh you're talking

1922
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,080
I completely missed the bodies

1923
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,080
Oh my god

1924
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,080
I was going to write even being cooked

1925
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,080
I was like

1926
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,080
I looked like she was on a stick

1927
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,080
That's rotating

1928
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
Oh

1929
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,080
I feel so hot

1930
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,080
That's everything

1931
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,080
This girl is my child

1932
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Oh that's why you were humming

1933
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,080
Indiana Jones

1934
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,080
I was like where did that come from

1935
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,080
I was trying to write

1936
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,080
Cowboy but I didn't

1937
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,080
Oh that's so adorable

1938
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,080
That's so adorable

1939
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,080
Oh it's Emmy

1940
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,080
Wait

1941
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,080
What is this

1942
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,080
Draw it in white

1943
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,080
Oh colors

1944
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,080
I used the color black

1945
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,080
And I used red as well

1946
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,080
And orange

1947
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,080
What

1948
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,080
What is this

1949
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,080
What the fuck

1950
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,080
No

1951
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,080
No cow

1952
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,080
I can't read

1953
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,080
This is beautiful

1954
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,080
No cow

1955
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,080
Hey

1956
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,080
I like this girl

1957
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,080
She's like

1958
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,080
Is that all

1959
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,080
Oh my god

1960
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,080
Oh

1961
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,080
I used the fucking eraser

1962
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,080
That's why you couldn't fucking see it

1963
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,080
How did we get back to boobs

1964
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,080
I don't know how you managed that

1965
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Honestly

1966
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,080
Well

1967
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,080
That potato was really bad

1968
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,080
Aw

1969
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,080
Awesome

1970
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,080
You were number one

1971
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,080
Oh is that a 3D concert

1972
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,080
Pee Pee's not number one

1973
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
Oh my god

1974
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,080
Oh no

1975
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,080
I think it is short

1976
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,080
Oh my god

1977
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,080
That's amazing

1978
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,080
That's what we got there

1979
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,080
Your mom called me

1980
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,080
Oh no

1981
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,080
I forgot to give up

1982
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,080
Oh no

1983
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,080
You're so sick

1984
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,080
Oh no

1985
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,080
My cheeks hurt

1986
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,080
My cheeks hurt

1987
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,080
Same

1988
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,080
My jaw hurt

1989
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,080
Okay okay

1990
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,080
Glad we could

1991
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,080
No

1992
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,080
Shit

1993
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,080
I just went over by a train

1994
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,080
Oh my god

1995
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,080
Somebody download that one

1996
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,080
Oh my god

1997
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,080
That's fucking amazing

1998
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,080
That's so fucking funny

1999
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,080
I love this

2000
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,080
Glad I got permission

2001
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,080
Glad I got a train

2002
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,080
I know it's a premium car

2003
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,080
They got the premium pass

2004
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,080
AC at the convention

2005
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,080
They got the premium pass

2006
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,080
That trains me

2007
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,080
Tag yourself

2008
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,080
I'm the ropes

2009
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,080
Tying Amy to the tracks

2010
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,080
Oh my god

2011
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,080
I'm not gonna

2012
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,080
Endure the girls to anything more

2013
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,080
Cause our faces are ready to fall off

2014
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,080
After that

2015
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,080
Is anyone in the stream

2016
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,080
Is anyone in the stream

2017
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,080
Are you doing a stream right now?

2018
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,080
I need to pee really bad

2019
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,080
I'm gonna jump out of the call

2020
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,080
Of course you need to pee

2021
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,080
I'm gonna jump out of the call

2022
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,080
I'm announcing my new piss off

2023
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,080
I know

2024
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,080
I'm going to jump out of the call

2025
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,080
And do a little zatsu

2026
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,080
Then I'll redirect into Yuzuru

2027
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,080
I'm a balloon star though

2028
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,080
I might play

2029
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,080
Do you guys want me to

2030
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,080
I might play some call the lamb

2031
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,080
If someone does a pop up stream

2032
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,080
Just tell me

2033
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,080
I'll talk to my refunds for a bit

2034
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,080
Thank you so so much all members and dolls

2035
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,080
For this hilarity that ensued

2036
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,080
After such a miserable start

2037
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,080
It's such a miserable start

2038
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,080
To power wash her

2039
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,080
Shack myself from laughing so hard

2040
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,080
We already know

2041
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,080
Asus panties are soaked

2042
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,080
So let's not

2043
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,080
And Emmy probably

2044
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,080
No

2045
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,080
No

2046
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
Alright let me sniff

2047
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,080
Let me sniff

2048
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,080
Don't do the sniff test

2049
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,080
Rather pungent my dear

2050
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,080
Wait for me to just come out

2051
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,080
You have to take a test

2052
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,080
She just disintegrated

2053
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,080
Oh my god

2054
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,080
Right I'm gonna jump out of the chat

2055
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,080
Thank you so much

2056
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,080
We'll be doing collabs next week

2057
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,080
With each other so look out for that

2058
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,080
And I'll jump out of chat

2059
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,080
Thank you so much my darlings

2060
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,080
My daughters my girls

2061
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,080
I'll talk to you very shortly okay

2062
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,080
I love you my daughters

2063
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,080
That was fucking chaos

2064
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,080
I don't know why there's two of me either

2065
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,080
Bruh

2066
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,080
I mean honestly too for the price of one

2067
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,080
Why is there two

2068
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,080
No that's just the one I actually use

2069
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,080
Why is there two of me

2070
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,080
I wonder if it's picking a game

2071
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,080
Did I even have a chatting screen

2072
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,080
Oh I do

2073
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,080
Thank god

2074
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,080
Did I even have this asset

2075
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,080
Oh that's a lot of chatting

2076
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,080
Oh my goodness

2077
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,080
Oh sorry

2078
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,080
I really badly need to go for a pee

2079
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,080
Is that okay if I can go for

2080
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,080
A pee

2081
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,080
Yes

2082
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,080
And then we'll come back and we'll do some chatting

2083
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,080
I need to catch up on some

2084
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,080
I'm pretty sure someone don't know the stuff

2085
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,080
Oh my goodness

2086
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,080
That was so fun

2087
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,080
After the abysmal

2088
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,080
I kid you not

2089
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,080
The abysmal freaking star

2090
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,080
Oh

2091
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,080
Right give me a few minutes

2092
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,080
I just need to go pee okay

2093
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,080
Are you squinting me right now

2094
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,080

2170
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:58,040
videos that'll go on twitter because youtube's terms of service is sadly updated or being stealth

2171
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:06,360
updated and something is going on with ear licking and breathing in particular I have a sniffing

2172
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:15,560
video coming out soon and it may or may not be limited uh something rather odd going on a

2173
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:20,920
youtube headquarters but they don't want to publicly say it because ASMR is a one of the most

2174
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,440
I think it's like they're in their top 10 searches so I'll be curious to see what uh transforms

2175
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,240
accent isn't too harsh it's buttery smooth I tolerate I can hear pops did you hear that pop

2176
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,040
is it garthik phone is that what that pop is oh it's garthik that's what it is

2177
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:44,920
literally I'm like what what is that pop it's garthik um yeah you should be in dumb stop breathing

2178
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:49,720
your heart let yeah I knew there was a pop I thought it was going freaking mental there I was like what's

2179
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:57,320
going on oh my god the girls recovered that so well thank goodness she be uh had played garthik

2180
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:03,960
phone before that's the first time I've ever played it that was so fun freaking icy seems to

2181
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:11,640
be our muse we were like drawing icy icy icy I wonder if it's because because she's so recognizable

2182
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:16,520
with the blue ears and short blue hair that just makes her like so easily recognizable

2183
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:21,800
and then that's why we kept drawing her over and over again og suns kept getting mentioned

2184
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:31,720
I did get a marshmallow from an og sun that was like thank god for thank you for giving me icy

2185
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,760
like I'm so happy and I'm like oh I told her about it and so whoever og sun sent me that I do

2186
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:46,840
I do relay messages to the girls um you know I told them I've been getting quite a few marshmallows

2187
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:53,320
recently of people thanking me for picking them and it's like no no no no no it's all their work

2188
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:59,640
it's their hard efforts it's their enthusiasm um and they applied do you know how many people

2189
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,360
lurked and didn't apply because they didn't want to be the first in gen one basically um

2190
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:12,040
um so yeah give up give up for the girls for doing it because they they were doing

2191

2193
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:37,880
to be on pc that's my only thing um I do have big stream tomorrow I just have wee streams today

2194
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,680
the reason I have wee streams is because I'm trying to catch up mersey's done her monetization

2195
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:47,400
so she can now upload her meme ace oh well I'll upload it on her channel she can unlist it at

2196
01:38:47,400 --> 01:39:02,920
any time um that's not a problem uh um what was that I thought I've just distracted myself

2197
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:06,600
oh uh my streams yes I think I'm doing runescape tomorrow

2198
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,040
yes okay we have an endurance stream tomorrow so if you've not had enough of mom our mommy

2199
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:19,480
uh freaking other v-tubers are calling me mommy too I'm like yeah damn my influence is spread just

2200
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:30,840
like my in the ASMR booth huh man in the ASMR booth uh stroney I am actually supposed to be blonde

2201
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:41,000
or I'm a ginger because I'm Scottish in me you'd be called a ginger because your your hair's orange

2202
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,480
so you're a ginger and to Scottish people but I don't think other nationalities like really say

2203
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:54,040
ginger you thought you were blonde you're supposed to be orange like a pumpkin emi you're a pumpkin

2204
01:39:55,240 --> 01:40:03,160
you're my you're my little pumpkin emi but she is so blonde wait is she actually but my hair is

2205
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:11,320
blonde wait am I going crazy am I colorblind but emi's ginger that's not blonde you've got a little

2206
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:18,680
pumpkin hair I've shown you your concept though I mean I guess you could say like your hair is

2207
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:27,480
top of your head is quite blondish I'd say your ginger ginger people have red hair don't they

2208
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:34,200
gin that's what ginger people are ginger people have orange hair like you that's what ginger

2209
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:42,920
voice you're a ginger emi you're a ginger emi yeah you know maybe maybe this is like cultural

2210
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,320
different thing but you're ginger in the Scottish eyes it's kind of a strawberry blonde her hair

2211
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:52,120
strawberry blonde the way I see it I thought it was orange myself yeah red hair it really is just

2212
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:57,880
orange yeah I was gonna say you're not like dyed box dyed red hair I think I'm giving emi a complex

2213
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:06,440
over this oops because my hair's got more reddish tint to it um to differentiate me from you

2214
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:12,280
because obviously we we both didn't want ginger hair I've got like a watermelon let's say someone

2215
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:20,040
explained it and there's that watermelon me strawberry has lost the plot once again honestly

2216
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:25,560
I didn't concept you the with your color scheme I just went with it but your orange you're definitely

2217
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:32,040
orange slash ginger in your concept or if you want to take a peek at it again um I don't have it on me

2218
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:40,920
at this point in time oops um I prefer emi she's just discovered she's a yinya oh my wee emi oh dear

2222
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:04,200

subscribes or enjoys the content or whatever um the girls were getting ahead of me which I was

2247
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:06,760
really happy about because I really didn't want to be ahead of everyone um uh but it's freaking

2248
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:11,560
happened and I'm like oh go subscribe to my daughters everyone look in the description right now and

2249
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:17,960
go subscribe but she be just went live I will redirect into Azura because I've actually yet

2250
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:24,360
to redirect into Azura once um so I'm going to make sure I do that I'm just gonna check if there's

2251
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:31,400
any marshmallows um yeah just thank you so much for your patience again as I said for some reason

2252
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:37,000
power washer simulator does allow six people to conglomerate that's not the correct word

2253
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,080
to come together to con congregate into one server however the requirements are you have

2254
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:49,640
had to have completed the campaign mode so I was the only one that had done that so I was trying to

2255
01:46:49,640 --> 01:47:01,160
get everyone in at once it did not work um and we were like literally at the 20 minute mark and I

2256
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:05,720
was like oh my god we're just gonna have to cancel this and do like guerrilla streams and come back

2257
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:13,560
to this a later time but then she be she be kept me me head on me shoulders and um she said let's

2258
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:21,160
do garlic phone and we could do it because originally we were gonna do that other browser based

2259
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:27,960
one which I can't remember the name of oh but it was like we would have to screen record the discord

2260
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:33,800
and like absolutely fucking not with the absolute shit we take jackbox that's it we would have had to

2261
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:40,840
screen record at that I'm like don't don't even think about sharing that discord the amount of

2262
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:51,800
inappropriate stuff we send to one another do not dare even hover over displaying discord

2263
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:59,240
strani you can stream anything and we'd love every second of it thank you I'm glad I'm glad you agree

2264
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:05,320
we're doing uh I think we're doing endurance uh runescape tomorrow I want to try and get level

2265
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:14,040
70 cooking um we're not gonna do movies tomorrow I was actually gonna do marshmallows tomorrow

2266
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:19,240
whilst we stream for a bit and then do the classic I'll start rambling about anything and everything

2267
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,200
and then how we should be able to take over the capitalistic society and hopefully capitalism

2268
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:30,680
eats itself and births a much more yeah you know what I'm saying um I will do that tomorrow so my

2269
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:36,920
voice is gonna be fried my voice is actually fried from the ASMR yesterday um when I was like

2270
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:41,960
roleplaying as AC I don't think AC knows that I was roleplaying as her because she didn't mention

2271
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:48,520
anything of it but I was like like all of that like she didn't none of them knew I roleplayed

2272
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:53,160
and I'm like yeah I should probably stay under the radar because they're like why do you think I sound

2273
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:59,400
like that or something like that the revolution honestly need to see the discord chat it's just

2274
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:05,000
inappropriate it's like I want artwork of me like this I want artwork of me like that oh I want to

2275
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,200
do this with the you know the bleeding hearts I want to do this with the pin pals and I'm like

2276
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:19,880
bruv it's pretty weird so much like break free reflin conspiracy stream tomorrow let's go not

2277
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:26,360
exactly but uh someone said they would actually like to do like a full stream so I would have to

2278
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:32,440
plan for it there's quite a few streams I want to do that require preparation time which sucks

2279
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:39,160
because I have hardly any time I do have a collaboration of the girls coming out soon

2280
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:47,560
one big audio which should hopefully boost everyone past 5k I was checking the statistics

2281
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:54,600
and I was like why is AC and Azura not paying out the same levels and it's not because of like

2282
01:49:54,920 --> 01:50:03,560
this or that I looked at how badly YouTube was culling everyone it was going for AC's jugular

2283
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:10,200
and Azura's throat like seriously the culling was so harsh I got culled 700 subs one day and AC

2284
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:17,240
got 1500 subs culled on one day which explains why um like because the viewership between us

2285
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:26,600
all is pretty much the same reef anarchy oh I quite like that Rafa Rafa and I see yeah AC and

2286
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:33,800
Azura got hit hard the worst um when we were doing that culling but it's over now the culling has

2287
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:40,840
stopped praise uh the lord because that was just getting so rough honestly um

2288
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:54,760
uh it's really cute that you keep the bibutes to yourself why would I share that

2289
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:01,880
I like it strongy silver hand is absolutely genius you would love to play

2290
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:09,160
2077 I'm certain of it okay okay we'll definitely play it I'm like 99 percent sure

2291
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:14,200
Rebecca's gun is in that game as well somewhere I don't know where but Rebecca's gun is somewhere

2292
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:21,640
in that game snowberries are strong yeah college at world at war zombie mode was like that back in

2293
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:28,520
the day we're not getting culled anymore now that we have content out we're monetized yada yada

2294
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:35,800
yada we're not getting culled anymore so thank goodness for that um because that was getting

2295
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:40,760
pretty rough but tomorrow endurance stream with runescape the day after we're playing crash

2296
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:48,440
bandicoot warped um I'm pretty sure they remastered the game but I think that's eight hours long to

2297
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:54,600
complete it so that's a nice uh it's a longer stream not endurance I think endurance is 10 hours

2298
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:59,160
that's what I consider an endurance stream anything less than 10 hours and I'm like meh

2299
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:05,160
that wasn't really wasn't really uh feeling it the only thing the only thing I don't like about

2300
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:10,120
doing endurance streams is that I have to walk away to go tinkle or get a cup of tea or get some

2301
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:15,720
food like I wish I could somehow do it all in this room so I didn't have to go away and like

2302
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:23,400
me or whatever the icy train joked sladia and they were good um that disappearing game mode

2303
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:29,080
was so fun trying to guess like where to draw next did you like the premium passes around the

2304
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:35,640
og suns next I there I was getting bullied and he was bullying me for my scotch accent I can't I

2305
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:42,600
said a word I think it was og suns because of the way it said I was oh no it was a hegeo or whatever

2306
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:49,560
and she was like oh the way you're saying it I'm like surprise surprise I'm freaking scot but

2307
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:55,160
the girls are such fun like mercy was a while ago like when we kind of just first got started

2308
01:52:55,160 --> 01:53:00,280
mercy was like am I allowed to make fun of your accent I'm like yes mercy I sound absolutely

2309
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:06,680
ridiculous I know I sound bizarre it's perfectly fine mercy you can make fun of me you you do not

2310
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,880
have to be scared that I'm gonna be like oh my god you said something that's it you're getting a

2311
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:20,840
stealth suspension or something I don't know Scotland whatever it's okay have fun listening

2312
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:26,360
to your accent and pronouncing stuff yeah you're like the way I see things differently yeah I'll

2313
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:37,000
bet you do surprise surprise what the fuck is that ASMR video going well that I uploaded

2314
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:42,840
I've just refreshed and I've gone up a hundred subscribers am I missing something

2315
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,720
is someone posted that ASMR video somewhere

2316
01:53:54,120 --> 01:54:00,040
or is it just because it's like a complete meme so the way I've recorded that audio I

2317
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,800
don't know if you guys have seen that a girlfriend begs you to let her hold the ASMR

2318
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:11,320
and it probably sounds a bit different because I've purposely left in mistakes normally I like

2319
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:20,680
super edit everything as much as possible but why is it picked up so much traction it should

2320
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:29,320
have only got like 1k views you hit the algorithm the vid is close to 4k views you say 4k on my

2321
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:35,480
end it says it's 5.4k views wait hold on I'll screenshot and show you what I see

2322
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,840
okay I need to refresh the page so I can get the confetti

2323
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:46,920
whoa that is screen recording please do not screen record that's not nice

2324
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:49,640
um

2325
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:53,640
does that not save

2326
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:03,320
this is what I see so if you've never seen like the behind the scenes of a

2327
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:09,880
an ooo to the video type thing uh this if I can redo this really quickly

2328
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:17,240
did that not save it did uh this is what it looks like when you upload a video

2329
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:25,720
uh it literally says like oh in four hours you've ranked by like your viewers if you have a one

2330
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:32,840
out of ten you get like confetti um an impression click through rate percentage you get like

2331
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:38,920
duration of how long they listen so yeah don't mind if I do I've got quite a few comments to

2332
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:49,160
approve on it though I have them comments uh on approval as you can imagine because I knew

2333
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:59,960
I cannot have an an agency that was a bit uh disoriented no that's not right at all um a bit um

2334
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,520
on alternative side you know I knew the girls were gonna get harassment and stuff so everything

2335
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,640
for us it shows 3.90 that's very cute

2336
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:21,640
up next someone commented up next girlfriend begs you to let her put donuts on it honestly that's

2337
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:31,320
probably the sequel um that's probably the very valid sequel don't think my comment got approved

2338
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:34,120
yeah the comments are really bugged out

2339
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,800
yeah the comments are like super bugged out for some reason when it comes to like needing to

2340
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:56,120
approve them oh my god I'm not used to seeing my my uh extremities I'm not used to seeing my my

2341
01:56:56,120 --> 01:57:03,080
personality oh wait no that one wrong one sorry I'm not used to seeing my personality that's so

2342
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:16,760
weird um I just admire in the art for the art honestly um but yes that collab was fantastic

2343
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:21,720
um I did kind of do a little spoiler you know but next week the girls are doing one-on-one

2344
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:27,160
collabs do you want to know who I'm taking on have a guess who you think I'm collabing with next

2345
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:34,200
week from vealer from vealer take again have a gander

2346
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:43,560
me and mersey oh my cat's at the door um I don't know if you can hear it it's good

2347
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:50,120
um I'm playing with mersey and we're gonna be playing a game where we can go

2348
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:57,800
we're gonna be playing goose game together and I'm so excited I have no idea what it's gonna go

2349
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:05,720
like but I freaking love mersey um I was showing my co-worker while I'm watching brov me who just

2350
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:14,600
took off my you cat oh oh so that's what you're seeing is you picked mersey I should have picked

2351
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:24,920
any kind of door we ended up playing in goose game and honking out all the people I've never

2352
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:33,160
played goose game before but I think I think um it's like a puzzler timing type thing so hopefully

2353
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:37,400
I don't get too region as long as mersey can carry me hopefully she's played it before if she's not

2354
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:44,040
played it before then we'll be looking at the snippets and the reef links to help us up through the

2355
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:57,320
game um oh my god goose game yeah you split the first collab by size didn't you yes I did um that's

2356
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:03,240
also how the collab or alternative audios are split for the first time I don't know if people

2357
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:10,440
are gonna like isra and shabby's collab audio there will be some people who are like gonna

2358
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:16,040
levitate but I know it's not for the masses please don't be mad at them be mad at me because it's

2359
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:25,400
what I came up with and I quite like the idea um vealer and yumi plus um soon I can't really

2360
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:29,160
say when but soon um I don't know when we can say when

2361
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:38,440
it's good chaotic okay oh lord the old overwatch meme song is in psd well I was worried about name

2362
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:44,120
and mercy mercy because she had a uh I think I told you I did tell you guys um she was originally

2363
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:50,920
called karam beats uh in few all the way up to development about a month then I was like

2364
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:58,200
I need to rename her this isn't gonna work um I knew it was a bad name but there were so many

2365
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:05,800
developmental issues behind the scenes that kind of left me a bit helpless like I only had myself

2366
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:13,640
to rely on for certain sections and the naming kind of ended up with me um which I can like look back

2367
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:18,840
and laugh at now like that's why like I'm like oh fondle of bosom that's funny or like she be caught

2368
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:26,040
in bottom oh that's funny type thing but at the time like I could cry thinking about like the stress

2369
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:31,640
I was under and I felt like I couldn't like reach out to anyone in the development team side of things

2370
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:37,400
because I was having a really difficult time so karam beat made it all the way through until we

2371
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:43,800
got modest which means is frenched for your dressmaker and mercy if you didn't know her lore

2372
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,760
is she's actually a fashion designer which is why her outfit is so out there and is so unique

2373
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:56,360
um because it's handcrafted all that jazz um and um

2374
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:04,920
mercy obviously mercy is a very big overwatch character but there's no vtuber called mercy

2375
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:11,560
and I'm like mm mercy modest sounds so good and especially the yandere element of like the last

2376
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:17,400
thing you'll be screaming for is mercy I think I came up with that in the development team and

2377
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:23,480
like everyone just unanimously agreed there is another sentence we really like for mercy which is

2378
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:31,800
um fear is a top shelf aphrodisiac that came up by largely came up by one of the audio editors so

2379
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:38,280
shout out um to them they just came out with it and I was like yep we're gonna take that thank you

2380
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:43,640
and I think it's in her trailer um because it was such a good sentence uh you nailed the names in

2381
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:50,600
the end oh well I'm glad you agree thank god I'm not naming gen 2 or gen 3 um I don't have to do any

2382
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:58,120
of that gen 2 is getting named uh for me how many people are on the development team so they're not

2383
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:04,840
all listed on the website um I think uh we had a lot of comments like that they were like oh the

2384
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:10,600
the team's so small the team's so this the girls don't have access to the full development team for

2385
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:18,040
safety reasons and the development team do not have access to them um there's quite a lot of um

2386
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:28,600
advisors I guess is the best way to call them um and it's kind of just information fetching think

2387
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:34,600
of it like a fetch quest and uh like a video game just like here can you go tell this person this

2388
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:40,040
deliver this letter it's kind of like that um there's a lot of people who give influence in

2389
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:48,840
overall advice uh some of them are content creators some of them are long-term artists some of them

2390
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:57,400
um are editor the editors give a bit of feedback which is decent the audio editors they're

2391
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:05,880
um but yeah there there's a lot there's no um employees it's all contract based um

2392
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:10,280
and that was one of the feedbacks like oh the company's gonna go under because

2393
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:17,320
how are they gonna pay all these employees don't be so fucking stupid and that was that was probably

2394
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:24,520
one of my most used phrases when violor hadn't started up yet was that phrase whenever I read

2395
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:29,080
something it was like how are you how are you gonna pay all these salaries and all these

2396
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:38,120
medical expenses because you'll have to offer healthcare don't be so fucking stupid seriously

2397
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:47,400
don't be so daft in the head to to genuinely think that it's employee based when it is an

2398
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:52,680
international company dealing with international talents like none of us have fucking met in

2399
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:59,480
real life that's not how it works um like honestly some of the stuff it was like how

2400
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:09,560
are they gonna pay into their pensions don't be so fucking stupid it's obviously contract

2401
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:16,440
based work it's self employment contract based work like oh how are they gonna pay for all the

2402
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:25,320
editors uh when we go to them and commission the job like you think we have editors on on

2403
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:33,080
employee employee salary what so if they if I only give them three audios for an entire month

2404
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:43,880
I'm I'm still gonna give them a full salary don't be so fucking stupid honestly some of the

2405
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:50,520
feedback some of some of the feedback or that would be like the negative feedback do not even

2406
02:04:50,520 --> 02:05:00,920
have a fraction of a clue on how to like run stuff and it's the confidence that like to even type

2407
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:10,520
such messages honestly unionize not like 401k benefit yeah like it's like it's an international

2408
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:18,040
company uh what do you mean you expect us to have private healthcare for our employees it's

2409
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:28,200
contract self employment based work oh my goodness oh my goodness like it's okay not to know about

2410
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:34,360
this stuff that's perfectly fine that's different but to wrongly announce and criticize the company

2411
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:41,480
before it had even launched and just to be so blatantly wrong oh it was my favorite

2412
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:47,240
phrase in development just just take a screenshot and like show the development team and be like

2413
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:56,200
oh some of this stuff was ridiculous um so it's been I have to admit it's been bloody satisfying

2414
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:02,680
it's been very satisfying being like yeah we're one weekend 5k subs oh yeah one weekend monetized

2415
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:07,880
oh yeah I have to admit that's been satisfying just to be like because everyone was like oh

2416
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:15,400
one of the biggest feedbacks actually was that uh the girls are gonna get harassed by the development

2417
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:23,320
team or something like that and I'm like don't be so stupid it's so easy not to give any developmental

2418
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:28,600
staff access to the talents and what to do I've done it and it's super easy turns out all you have

2419
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:34,680
to do is be an owl that's it you just have to relay messages to one team to another it's that easy

2420
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:43,320
like honestly some of the feedback was like oh then it'd be so stupid me anyway that's my rant

2421
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:49,240
over and done with thank you for living me to rant for one day what do you mean your

2422
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:54,200
Vtuber agency doesn't have a retirement plan oh literally it was like stuff like that like

2423
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:58,920
I can set the girls up long term and tell them what to do and like this is how I did it and this

2424
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:08,280
is how you should do it type thing um but yeah only one man can harass them exactly like um

2425
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:16,360
I spoke to like another agency owner and they were like oh everyone in their development team

2426
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:21,480
like had to go through um HR training as well as the talents and I was like

2427
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:29,800
I was who literally just like sexually harass each other and the discord and like send in

2428
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:33,640
the front like I was like straight up sending pictures of myself and I'm like this is what I

2429
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:42,760
literally like smile um so yeah the moment you called me a big girl literally I was like how

2430
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:45,880
that was really creepy I'm like why did those words slip past my mouth

2431
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:52,200
going to sleep right at rest well I'm gonna redirect into Azura very shortly um I'm

2432
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:59,880
I'm just yapping for a little bit a little recap um why would the dev team even want to

2433
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:07,240
well it happened in other high profile agencies let's just say um one agency in particular came

2434
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:14,280
out and were like her talent was uh had misconduct with a team member and I was like wait you mean

2435
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:19,720
your team member preyed upon your talent like the way they twisted that I was like oh that's

2436
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,880
our that's rough to try and navigate that one mate honestly just shut up and let them go

2437
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:30,360
uh stop apologizing that graphic collab is one of the best tunes I've had in five years

2438
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:36,280
awww strongy love ac love emmy love shebe love azura love velia via lura love but best of all

2439
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:43,400
mommy love free fling love uh hi strongy have you seen the kagaguri one six sale that's out

2440
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:50,360
for pre-order can you put it on throne oh that's very kind of you but I don't think I would get

2441
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:57,480
much use out of it I can't hot glue it unfortunately and I said what I said I want to hear strongy

2442
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:05,000
look at her there's also that popular streamer her editor admitted to jork into yeah that kind of stuff

2443
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:12,040
literally you know how you prevent all of that from happening in an agency have one person

2444
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:19,560
be an owl that's it have one person relay back and forth from the talents to the development team

2445
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:24,440
and that's it that's all you have to do it's super simple and easy but no one seemed to have

2446
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:30,200
figured it out before me so I actually feel pretty proud of myself for just knowing off the bat how

2447
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:38,920
to do that uh huh whenever something bad ish happens you should post a white paper note

2448
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:43,720
some vealers official twitter the tweets wording should be ambiguous and the right on the paper

2449
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:48,600
should be formal looking but tiny so people can't make out what it says from the preview but then

2450
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:53,080
they open it full screen it says nobody's getting suspended and you forgive the girls for whatever

2451
02:09:53,080 --> 02:10:03,240
she did bro the girls cannae do any wrong like I'm sorry but like I don't know like ooh they did

2452
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:10,840
a kink that's frowned upon ooh so bad ooh like oh go and just let them play video games and shut

2453
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:20,440
the fuck up honestly anyway um something else to call that is a singular point failure a singular

2454
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:32,360
point of failure just one okay um but they did know how to be an owl but they were too lazy to do that

2455
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:42,840
uh it it it deboggles my mind um how there's not owls in other agencies all you need is a really

2456
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:49,400
basic owl did you know that in magic the gathering there was a creature type called cephalid referring

2457
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:56,440
to humanoid cephalopods I mentioned this because of the because tomorrow on June 14th wizards of the

2458
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:01,720
coasters officially removing them from the game albeit without a public announcement only through

2459
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:06,840
you know funny you mentioned magic the gathering I wanted to get into that when um

2460
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:12,280
I'm no longer busy but I'm not allowed to say it

2461
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:19,640
but they complained about sheebie to whom huh

2462
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:28,280
oh no it's something I don't like better light the beacons honestly it's like

2463
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:34,600
why don't you shut up like I feel like we're all just like on the same page where it's like

2464
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:40,600
just shut up and walk away if you don't enjoy the content it's really no that hard

2465
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:47,880
like I will continue to engage in the content that makes me upset and outraged and then you wonder

2466
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:53,720
why like you've got anxiety you've got depression you've got a fucking array of a list and then you

2467
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:57,800
keep participating in the shit that puts your body into fight or flight because you feel so

2468
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:11,320
passionate about the thing that upsets you like brav just fuck off and see what who what a message is

2469
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:26,040
this and I enjoyed your girlfriend begs you to let it hold it is the mom oh

2470
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:36,920
is someone who's writing poetry and my freaking marshmallow my hygiene is better than a frenchie

2471
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:47,880
is the one manager enough for six talents

2472
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:55,800
well let me reverse the question if you have an agency where the girls do not need to come to you

2473
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:00,200
for approval for streams approval on what they need to do approval for this approval for that

2474
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:08,600
what do you need to manage is my question the only thing was audios was my job but it's no longer

2475
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:15,160
my job because I have an audio manager in place so I don't even have to do that now so my question is

2476
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:20,360
what do the girls need help with because Azura's got her donut on coming up so I'm gonna work with

2477
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:26,040
her one-on-one on that and it's like you don't need a full-time person to come in and manage you

2478
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:31,480
know I don't mean that in a mean way I don't mean to be like I just mean like like seriously if you

2479
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:37,800
are genuinely curious like if you run an agency where the girls need permission for you every single

2480
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:42,120
week when they submit their games to you or like what they want to do that week yeah of course you're

2481
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:47,000
going to need a manager because you've forced that you've forced the hand of needing a manager

2482
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:55,000
running your agency like that if you say you know what girls you are adults I'm going to treat you

2483
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,360
like an adult you can decide on whatever you want to do if you need advice you come to me I'll tell

2484
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:09,000
you what I did or what I think would work well for you and yeah it completely negates the need of a

2485
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:18,040
a general manager now if the girls ever came to me and said I cannot think for myself I don't

2486
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:25,800
I want to stream but I can't think that's when I would create schedules for them and notes about

2487
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:33,000
what game I've selected or what zatsu or what theme I can do that you know it's very hands-off the more

2488
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,720
controlling you are the more the more headache you're causing for everyone the talents become

2489
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:42,280
insecure in their choices if you're rejecting their schedules and

2490
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:51,480
management itself will start to feel burned out and tired because they're having to abide by these

2491
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:55,800
rules of saying like oh this girl isn't allowed to play this game because of this reason but that

2492
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,840
girl that girl's fine she's allowed to do that because of this reason no you're just causing

2493
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:08,600
headache and heartache for no reason these girls that have applied for your agency they

2494
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:15,800
have saw a vision they have saw success in your plan for you to turn around and not let them cook

2495
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:24,680
as the as the saying is is just ridiculous you're just causing upset among all the ranks like if

2496
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:29,560
the girl if the girls ever came to me and said look I'm struggling to pick games guess what I've

2497
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:34,440
already wrote them a guide with loads of listed out games and if that's not enough then guess what

2498
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:37,960
I'll work one on one with them and pick out their schedule and pick games out that I think are

2499
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:42,040
accessible to them or what they'll enjoy I'll do my research like it's really not that hard to

2500
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:52,440
enable your talents it's really not that hard um potentially tech upgrades yes so that's up to

2501
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:58,360
the girl with the 80 20 split so it's just just turning into agency stream again I'd like to I

2502
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:03,160
like talking about the behind the scenes though because I don't mind yes when it comes to technology

2503
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:11,000
so some agencies will take a percentage out of their earnings to put back into technology

2504
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,960
we have said to the girls look the split is 80 20 whatever you do with your 80 percent is up to you

2505
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:24,600
and you know if you choose not to upgrade your equipment if you're not satisfied with it

2506
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:31,160
honestly that's not on us you know that's not on us at that point um like I'll say it to their feet

2507
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:36,040
like they already know like the girls are all on the same page if you're getting an 80 split 100

2508
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:43,080
merch sales um and a few other things coming up um yeah if if their technology's bugging out or

2509
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:51,320
they need something new and they don't pay for it themselves look brov brov we did offer a streaming

2510
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:58,200
kit so if the girls needed like basic iPhones for track in or microphones or a pc in someone's case

2511
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:04,600
um yeah we did purchase it on their behalf type thing but yeah mommy is doing so great and good

2512
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:09,800
job as you can hear so glad she caps about all literally I don't know why like any of it should

2513
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:15,800
be a secret it's just like this is how the agencies run I'm sure no one is surprised um

2514
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:22,520
um I love listening to you talk about these things really love getting to see your passion

2515
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:30,360
um it's um like literally like I'm giggling away being like oh I've just turned the ic stream off um

2516
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:42,680
that's wrong but uh sorry there's a ic just added me on timing um

2517
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:48,920
um yeah no I honestly don't mind talking about it oh obviously development took a year and I've

2518
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:55,080
kind of said like one of the criticisms we got was that the girls weren't allowed to pick their designs

2519
02:17:55,960 --> 02:18:02,120
it took a year for the models to get here it took a year for the concept or it took a year like

2520
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:09,080
brov in the nicest way I am very aware that idol in lets their talents pick designs and that I can

2521
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:16,360
hear Gimli meowing um pics or designs and all of that we do not have a development team like that

2522
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:22,920
I do not have six model artists and six model rigors on standby at this time at this schedule

2523
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:29,880

2524
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:35,960
offer that the cut would not be 80 20 that's just not possible in such a budget we would have to pay

2540
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,040
tism going off like spider said she's just like me for real for real or I can thank you for the 10

2541
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:26,360
um yeah like I honestly don't mind like uh some of the other feedback we got was like oh no males

2542
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:31,880
absolutely nothing's stopping you for opening up a male agency mate good fucking luck for that the

2543
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:37,720
only reason I can do chicks is because I have chick experience isn't isn't that crazy man blowing

2544
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:42,440
concept Gimli isn't it she's currently rubbing my chair right now it's absolute mind blowing

2545
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:48,840
concept where I can't manage guys because I've never made content as a guy my staggering beyond

2546
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:56,040
belief absolutely earth shattering information revealed yeah the only reason I can hire chicks

2547
02:20:56,040 --> 02:21:00,920
is because I've got experiences of chick like my god what am I gonna say I did oh yeah just

2548
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:08,680
fucking I don't know what do what games the guys play that girls don't play um oh yeah go play

2549
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:14,120
Tarkov for eight hours like what am I supposed to do I don't I don't what do you want from me

2550
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:21,720
go make your own freaking VTuber agency then like go divided have fun just remember to plan

2551
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:25,480
like double the money whatever money you think it'll cost double it and then add some more because

2552
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:34,760
that's exactly what happened to me um wait strong is a girl oh my god she knows what we're doing no

2553
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:42,600
oh no Tarkov players and shambles I've never played Tarkov but I or like rust but I think

2554
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:49,240
those are very very guy games we'll make her own refling agency with men in black jackets

2555
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:57,640
this is all there was like such random feedback sorry I think oh no she's not she's still in the

2556
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:04,520
room are you okay so my cats are neutered but it looks like she's peeping and she when she

2557
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:10,120
shakes her tail and she just did it there because she thought I was getting up to feed her you've

2558
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:16,200
got dry nibbles down Gimli don't don't make the reeflings think I starve you they're gonna burst

2559
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:22,040
