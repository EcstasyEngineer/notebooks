1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This? Okay.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wow.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Me prancing and going sick.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where are my wheels?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That was a stretch.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That was like a random dinosaur noise I wanted to make.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Turns out I can actually be a lot louder than I first anticipated.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My dad had no idea I streamed.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I finished the stream and I went back down.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I got off again.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And obviously he was off at that point.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I was like, oh yeah, no, I enjoyed my stream.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sadly I was motion sick.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And he was like, huh?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He streamed.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I'm like, yeah, you didn't hear me.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I was like having a carry on and stuff.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But apparently he never heard nothing.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, well, I guess I can be a hell of a lot louder.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I will because yesterday I was like, I was ill as anything though.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for understanding.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was so freaking ill.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, we're going to play this little silly goofy thing.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's called will you press the button?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Basically, apparently it gives you scenarios and either you press it or not.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then it'll give you statistical percentages of who pressed it and who didn't.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is he a heavy sleeper?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, I thought because of the flight he basically passed out for ages.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But yeah, we went to the shops and we got food.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He was so mad at me for the food that I had in my fridge or the lack thereof.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He was pissed.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I showed him the short that I made of Sheebie.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So on my channel there's a short.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I'm like, if I had a willy, I know that Sheebie's design is a 10 out of 10.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I showed it to him.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And he was like, oh, I didn't want to hear you talking about a willy.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I was like, damn, Papa Cuttle said no to food.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Which is absolutely mean and both funny.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I showed him Amy's rats.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was like, all right, this is Amy.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She has rats and they're adorable.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And he found them quite funny.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Esteban is his favorite rat for yanking all this stuff.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because there's a one point like Amy's doing something.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I think it's the burger one.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And he's like, OK, we have a burger here and then Esteban yanks it.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And she's like, we have half a burger.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Please tell your dad to try and force you to enjoy.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, but he's cooking me steak.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We went to the shops and he's like, right, you're eating better.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you need?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I was like, well, I kind of need a steak, I guess.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And we've got chicken to marinate overnight.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've never marinated a chicken before.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That sounds like a marinate chicken.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Like, no, I've not got time to marinate chicken

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and put it in a Ziploc bag.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I had to buy Ziploc bags for the first time.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was like, what do I even need these for?

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The less he knows the better.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, no, he finds it hilarious what I do.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, my hell, yeah.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Marinate.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's good to see you having a good time with your dad.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was telling him about how you guys call him father-in-law.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And he was like, oh, I don't know if he's going to write a letter for me to say on stream.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll see if he wants to do it.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He mentioned leaving you as a message.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I was like, do you mean like a physical one?

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or like, what do you mean?

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like, I need to take down the transcript.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But he was like, no, no, I'll write.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, he approves of you guys.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, he approves of you all right.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was basically like, oh, so they're called Reflings.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because he still says Radish Boys, which is an old name.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But yes, he's definitely three weeks of real food.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your body isn't going to know it.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Literally, I'm going to have so many bill movements.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But yes, today's just a chill stream.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm just meming away.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're going to enjoy just, just chatting, doing our thing.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's no major rush for anything.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I believe Sheebie is on today.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So we'll redirect into her.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's nice and chill.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then I'm going back to Charlotte.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's going to invite us for a mission next week.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, my dad's know the camping tape.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Just say, what is my dad?

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe I'll walk.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Maybe a bit of the foodie.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
She's doing a member streamer for a regular streamer.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, well, someone else is getting redirected, isn't it?

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's not Sheebie.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sure there's someone we can find.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I need to buy some more bait and tackle.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's this gamer tag?

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, my God.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, he was talking to me about gaming because I was telling him,

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
like, oh, I got to play cameo again.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And he was like, you know what?

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Cameo was hitting my dad's got stronger accent.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So he's like, oh, by the Pope.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mama, I vanquished a possum last night for you.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He lived by the saying, you are what you eat.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And he was eating roadkill.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Strong enough.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you kidding me right now?

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, you eat?

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait, you killed a possum?

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm glad to hear he approves,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but I'm going to work so not going to be interacting for now.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, don't worry if you have to work.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Enjoy work.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Make sure you hydrate.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you, Broly Legend for the tit.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Orvon Biscotti.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you for the super chat.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You killed a possum?

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You didn't have to perish him.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He was just freaking doing it.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Papa Cuddles is going to get stream sniped, honestly.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nah.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are possum bad in America?

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're not supposed to perish the wildlife.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're supposed to feed it.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I had, I fed the birds yesterday.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wah.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I kid you not.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There must have been a hundred birds in that garden.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Listen, during work.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, I'm not going to be acting up too much, so you probably can.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is probably the most say so I'm going to be for the next three weeks.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Although I do have bad news.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't think I can do that ASMR stream.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's planned tomorrow.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think I can actually do any ASMR stream for three weeks.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can literally hear the walls reverberating right now from my dad snoring.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So yeah, I really don't want my dad's fart while he sleeps memorized.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Clipped and shipped.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
As hilarious as that would be.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's rather weird to explain.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like, oh, dad, by the way.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Someone clipped your fart whilst I was like streaming ASMR.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, I don't really want that to go down in history.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I think we're going to pause on ASMR for three weeks.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know how boring.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, and the complete sabotage.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But obviously I will make it up when my dad goes.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will keep you up to date when we're going to do it.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's all good.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But seriously, okay, if you can't do it, it must have been the wind.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Honestly, the freaking walls are vibrating from how intense his snoring is.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Old man fart ASMR.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Honestly, imagine me try to be all cute in that.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then you just hear like meh in the background like, okay, you're done.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Make sure you hide all your figures well.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, I fucking made sure that was done.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The perfect set up for don't wake up appearance.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My dear sibling ace.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, yo, you thinking like a pin pal here?

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Chill three weeks and then endurance marathon after marathon after marathon.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, pretty much that's the plan.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It all looks good to me.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, surely that was a lot of stuff that even the thought of it is like, oh, no.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm having me cup of tea.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wait, you need to try and be cute.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, so whenever I do like ASMR, I feel a lot of pressure.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Actually, like when I do it live, I don't know how to explain it.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't get like stage fright or anything.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I feel like with ASMR, I can't really be my goblino self.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It normally does end up me just straight up talking to you by the end of it.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But I feel like I have to try and choose my words carefully to not ruin the ambiance

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or what's going on type thing.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not a pin pal.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm loyal to my mate.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I never doubted you for a second.

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ASMR, your Scottish girlfriend brought you to meet her parents

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and she's trying to relax you while her dad snores louder than a motorcycle on the net.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, because it's true.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's actually true.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like, I was gonna play Ring Fit next week.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Next week, I'm playing a lot of Nintendo games

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
because I found my Ildeado.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm gonna...

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know what kind of choke hold that Sakuya game,

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the fruit game on Nintendo has on VTubers,

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but I'm joining the ranks and seeing what that game's all about.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I swear to God, if I'm about to spend,

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't know how much it costs,

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
if I'm about to spend a ridiculous amount of money on this little Nintendo fruit game

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and it's absolutely the most piss-borne thing I've ever played,

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
all VTubers unanimously are getting bent over my knee and spanked

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
because you all make that game look so addicting.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Everyone in their nan was playing that game

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and you all made it look so addicting.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I swear, I swear.

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If I pay three quid, three whole quid,

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
someone says in that game's piss,

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
everyone's getting spanked.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Everyone unanimously, okay?

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Johnny's 100% getting addicted to it as much as Belchro.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is that actually becoming a VTuber right now?

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, I'll spank the VTubers,

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but I'll ink you guys from behind

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
if it was you guys that said that it was a good game, okay?

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I never got the sucker hype.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't even know how to say it.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Three quid to US dollar.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't, er, fucking six dollars.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think, well, the old conversion rate was great,

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
British pounds to dollars was two,

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the other way about one to two.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I always said it like,

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Get that watermelon.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Aye, so we're going to play that next week.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The Streams Dave game's going to be Mario Kart.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Who goes there? Identify yourself.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And then I was going to do Ring Fit as well

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
because I need some exercise.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I walked to the shops with my dad.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Motherfucker, I was telling him to slow down

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and I'm like, fucking hell, I'm a gamer.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You need to relax, dad.

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like, relax, I'm in no rush.

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I got to show my magpies

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and there's also a crow I am now feeding.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I got to show him that and he was like,

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
oh, damn, that crow's pretty badass.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I'm like, yeah, me and dad both have the bird autism.

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We're like, yeah, birds are cool.

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Honestly, we're the same damn person.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We were like, watch Star Trek last night

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and I have something very adorable.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going to cry if I think about it too much.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My mom found my childhood toy

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and I'm going to take a picture and you can all see it.

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It needs a big wash, but his name is Charlie

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and he's a wee monkey and I absolutely adore him.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, yeah, I was like, oh, did you bring me any books?

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because last time my dad visited me,

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
he brought me books all my family.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I asked my family, like, oh, if you have any favourite books,

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
please just give them to my dad and he'll give them to me.

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And he was like, no, sorry, no books this time.

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I'm like, oh, no, that's fine, that's fine, don't worry about it.

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then he's like, oh, but there is one thing though.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And he whips out Charlie from behind them

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and I was like, you know if I wasn't so violently motion sick,

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll right now, I would burst out in tears.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have not seen my childhood Teddy since I was about 12 or something.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I sent my mom a text and I was like, you found Charlie

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and she's not replied to me yet, but oh my God,

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I've got my childhood toy and I love them to smithereens.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I remember he's got a little toy, he's got a speaker in him

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and he goes, because he's a monkey.

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They love monkeys. I love gorillas.

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Shout out to any viewer named Charlie right now, literally.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Charlie's not a cat. Charlie's a monkey.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Return to monkey.

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But I'll take a little photo of him

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and I can show you my childhood toy.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Maybe someone from the UK might have a Charlie too.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's Charlie on your bed.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, I have to put Charlie away in case Gimli and Vigil destroy him.

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't want any trouble. I don't want any trouble.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
My uncle did a funny, he gave me a toy monkey as a kid

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and told me his name was Spank.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You guys spank the monkey.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh wait, no, that's, you guys taught me,

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that doesn't mean what I think it means.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Monka? Monka? Are you okay?

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I feel that passing down a childhood bear to my kid.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, honestly, I'm so happy with Charlie.

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was like, honestly, if I didn't feel so violently sick,

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I would have burst out crying there.

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes, I remember what it means though,

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
but I forgot what I meant yesterday.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I didn't know any better.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay, great.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I actually played this game before I end up just turning into a rant,

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
a rant, a ramble about everything and anything.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Pardon me, boys.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Right.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, I can also make that short about how much money I earn.

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I was explaining to my dad, like, oh,

295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm going to make this short because I'm showing him what,

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
he knows what YouTube shorts are,

297
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
but I was just showing him like, oh, because I'm a,

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was like, all right, you're getting dusted upon the world of VTubers,

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and I showed him like Rin Penrose's stuff,

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and I was like, see how it's all like insider knowledge.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Like, people are genuinely interested in the ins and outs

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
of like, how being a VTuber is.

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And I was saying to him, like, I'm going to show my income for the month,

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and he was like, is that wise?

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like, aren't people going to think you're bragging?

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I'm like, no, it's not for bragging.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's to show like, this is how much you, you know, you can earn.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Fucking put your head down and, you know,

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
work your booty off type thing.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I was like, a lot of it is also, you have to remember,

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YouTube generates like free money when people watch VODs back

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and the ASMR videos, for example.

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But anyway, shut the fuck up, Johnny.

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No one cares.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You'll get a short soon about how much I earned in my first month of it all.

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I've a Gen 2 update.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Five.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
One of them is a very unique design.

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
A female concept artist.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The chick concept artist is giving me her batch by August 1st.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We've just received the second one from her.

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And we are looking fucking solid.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's all I'm saying.

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Sorry, I just sucked my finger because I opened up a can of cola.

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But five designs have been...

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What is going on with my cola?

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is there all exploding recently?

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Unique in a good way?

329
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, unique in a good way.

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't think there's like absolutely nothing where someone's like,

331
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
this person looks like this person.

332
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No, get to fuck.

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And then two, there's no one that's got the same bloody lore.

334
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can tell you that much.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Coca-Cola for Gen 3.

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Although the concept artist was fucking pranking me, man.

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It goes horse.

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm like, no, absolutely not.

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And it goes unicorn.

340
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No, absolutely not.

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Do not fucking turn around and give me a bloody unicorn.

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I swear, God, I was getting raging.

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But the female concept artist, she's giving me too.

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I look very adorable.

345
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm just waiting.

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, no fucking horse confirmed.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No horse, no unicorn.

348
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Donkey.

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Mule, you guys are such trolls.

350
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll spoil a stream that's coming up.

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm drawing your shitty suggestions for Gen 2 live on MS Paint.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're doing that not next week, but the week after the first one.

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So you guys can literally write what you want and I'm going to draw it live.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And then I'll show you what your line-up's going to look like.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm going to take a screenshot.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And then next year, when they actually come out, I'm going to be like,

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
hmm, I wonder whose suggestions were better.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Mine are yours.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Who goes there?

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Pegasus.

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, no.

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But show me a roly-poly vetiver.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
She's going to draw a million slime girls.

364
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Honestly, I'm going to be like, what color do you want the slime girl?

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Pick a color.

366
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Emu.

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Emu.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
She'd have to be Aussie if it was an Emu.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We get to comment on your drawing.

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, you can annihilate my drawing skills.

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't have any.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Literally, the title of the stream is like drawing Gen 2 suggestions,

373
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
but I never learned to draw.

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I never put those down.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Although that would be a fun idea.

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All the other girls have like fucking capabilities to doodle or doosh it.

377
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm going to have to tell them like,

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
hey, go have some fun streams.

379
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Emu couldn't be Aussie after the war.

380
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Cephalopod.

381
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Vetiver when?

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Kangaroo girl on Alpaca.

383
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And Alpaca, no.

384
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Right, when we actually do this,

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the whole reason we're here today,

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
your doodles are cute.

387
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Did you like the DEMPA birthday card on Twitter?

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh my god, I can be a real streamer.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Please remember to like and subscribe,

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
even though I've not done the thing I said I was going to do.

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Smile.

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
A honey badger.

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Honey badger, don't give up.

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Giraffe with that long neck?

395
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Absolutely not.

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, you can change your physical appearance in any way at any time,

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
including swapping genders,

398
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
but you will never be able to look the same way twice.

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I feel like that is like so minuscule.

400
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like it could be like, yeah,

401
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want an extra freckle on my butt cheek.

402
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like, I feel like that's so minuscule,

403
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it's not even necessary.

404
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd press, yeah, I'd press the crap out of that.

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you know how much money I could make on only fans

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
with this ability?

407
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Literally, I'm pressing the shit out of that.

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, I was, I think these people have overthunk it by far.

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
27% have overthunk it.

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Literally, you could be like, yeah,

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want a freckle in between my toes.

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's different, okay?

413
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
They played themselves.

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay?

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
100% would press, no brainer.

416
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This could be exploited to basically rule the world.

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You have the ability to cure cancer with touch,

418
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
but you will die of cancer.

419
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
See, now, there's no...

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh my god, I can...

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh my god, that's a white one, guys.

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can open them up.

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So, it says you'll die of cancer,

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but it doesn't give a timeline.

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I'm not being funny.

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Odds are, you actually do perish from cancer

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
the older you get.

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Other than Alzheimer's.

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Alzheimer's will fucking grab your brain

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and shake it real good and make it full of protein

431
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
so it doesn't function and you stop eating, basically.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, see, because it doesn't specify die immediately,

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm like, I could probably get a good solid 80 years

434
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
on this planet before the microplastics just annihilate me.

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Until it's over for me and all the lead and the clothes and that.

436
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think sacrifice for the gain of others as well

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
is quite a noble thing.

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Like, you know, my life is never going to amount to anything,

439
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
so if I could just cut about in the hospitals for a bit,

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
sure, fuck it, press that shit.

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh wow, 40% said no.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
St. Strawny, let him know.

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Whatever comforts you, okay?

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Whatever comforts you.

445
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Altruistic question.

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Cure everyone else but die a few years later.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, I feel like, because my life ain't going to be, you know,

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
about on general modification.

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Delicious lead and microplastic lunchables.

450
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay, sandy clothes is real.

451
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Every other holiday, you know, never get celebrated again.

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If, okay, that's definitely not the dad's up,

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I guess I'll open them up.

454
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean, like, oh, my dad sleeps through everything.

455
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
My dad who's literally slamming the cupboards right now.

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay, Santa Claus is real,

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
but every other holiday, you know, does they get celebrated?

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What are their other holidays?

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Valentine's Day, you could be romantic any day of the week

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
to me, Refland.

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Santa spawns capitalistic.

462
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Santa Claus is actually just a capitalistic front

463
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
to part with more of your money and put yourself in debt

464
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to the credit card companies.

465
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I will not press that button.

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Fuck you.

467
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Damn straight.

468
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's right, my people rise up.

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We identify against the capitalist pigs of society.

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
How dare you?

471
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay, all food tastes twice as good,

472
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but you're permanently constipated.

473
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I really like food though.

475
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, no.

476
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Did I get to relieve myself with my booty?

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
My wee douche, my wee pot douche?

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No, it's not worth it. I mean, you're always constipated anyway.

479
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I was going to say, like, I mean,

480
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
this is literally me right now.

481
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I really enjoy food, so I think I already have enhanced taste points.

482
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then, like, if ever, you know, get constipated,

483
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm just like, oh, just squish some water on my boot.

484
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's as simple as.

485
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Time to break out the colossal thing.

486
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait, don't you just implode you would die out of the food?

487
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't think I need it, actually.

488
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I think food's already enhanced for me.

489
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I will not. I will refrain, because I don't want to be full.

490
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, wow. Okay.

491
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
74% agreed.

492
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Mmm.

493
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Damn straight.

494
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You save the world and make it a better place,

495
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
but you go down in history as a bad person?

496
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I mean,

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
if you save the world and make it a better place,

498
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
again, this is the nation and good of the people,

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
but if you go down as a bad person in history,

500
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I mean, think of how much history gets lost to time.

501
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like, name one fact in the 1300s.

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Go. Like, you cannae off the top of your head.

503
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
History continues to develop,

504
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and people are forgotten, and that's just how life is.

505
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's not a big deal to be forgotten,

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and if you're remembered as a bad person,

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
guess what?

508
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Every time someone dies,

509
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
the percentage of people that know you and are aware of you

510
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
are just so unlikely.

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You know?

512
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So don't worry about being remembered as a baddie, okay?

513
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Save the planet, my final message.

514
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Goodbye.

515
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Will you press the button?

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You will get super ability to read minds.

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I can already do that with the reeflings.

518
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If you read their mind for too long,

519
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
they know you're doing it.

520
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Are you joking me? That's the best thing ever.

521
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Can you know how much torment I can do with you?

522
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'd be like, I know what you're thinking, reefling.

523
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then you know that.

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You know that I know that you're thinking of certain things.

525
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How is that any bad?

526
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That's not bad at all.

527
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That is not bad.

528
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Literally, whoever said 16%, come on.

529
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Imagine how red your face is gonna go.

530
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You're gonna be blushing.

531
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You're gonna be blushing.

532
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You're just gonna love every second of it.

533
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Mommy, please, I can't right now.

534
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Can you control when you do it?

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If so, 100% yeah.

536
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, hydration check.

537
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm getting, getting, getting.

538
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh.

539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I agree that some people's thinking my ball,

540
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but I would never stop thinking with things.

541
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What they're gonna do is stop thinking exactly.

542
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Although apparently guys can like zone out really easily.

543
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So maybe you just need to like zone out.

544
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And I'm like, damn, I can't get nothing off of you.

545
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'd use that against you.

546
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I could make,

547
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I could think of things that would make you blush.

548
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Okay, no, I'm here for it.

549
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm here for that kind of reverse psychology.

550
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You can perfectly torment someone

551
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
because you know what their picture in.

552
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm zoning out right now.

553
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I just started thinking of me.

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Sorry, I'm dumb.

555
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You can't get anything from my mind.

556
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, yeah.

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Ah, yes, or nothing box.

558
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Being empty-headed is just male superiority.

559
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My strongest skill versus strong disassociation.

560
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I cast this association.

561
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay.

562
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Everyone in your family would be taking care of

563
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
for the rest of their lives,

564
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
but you will be homeless for the rest of your lives.

565
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I have terrible news for you,

566
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but already take care of my family.

567
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I will not press that button.

568
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The fam are good.

569
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, I was gonna say that's quite a high percentage.

570
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean, I guess you could get around it

571
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and being like Colin, you can be homeless.

572
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You can never own a house under your legal name

573
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
if you want to get technical like that.

574
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But already look after the fam,

575
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
so that was a much of a thing.

576
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Homeless, no mad lifestyle in a van.

577
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I've seen that.

578
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The rise of people living in a van.

579
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I've seen that.

580
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I've seen a few tech talks about it

581
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and they're like, van life is good for me and all of that.

582
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, homeless doesn't necessarily mean it in a house.

583
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I agree, I agree.

584
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

585
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And like obviously you have the freedom to bop about in that van

586
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and you didn't have to pay like property taxes

587
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
or nothing on that bad boy

588
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
because you're living in a van.

589
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't know how you get mail though.

590
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Like if you need mail.

591
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Okay.

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You can bring any musician from the dead for one last show.

593
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You won't be able to see and hear it.

594
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I mean, if it's something for people to enjoy,

595
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't always have to enjoy everything myself.

596
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I can appreciate other people enjoying it.

597
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know?

598
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If someone wants big beef oven to come out of the ground,

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
go for it.

600
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know?

601
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm not going to ruin the night for someone else

602
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
just because I can't even get the goods of it.

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Like relax.

604
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Why would you say no?

605
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There's literally no downside.

606
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I mean, you could sync up on,

607
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
like literally you can have headphones in

608
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and sync up the music to what it's supposed to be.

609
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Relax.

610
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why is everyone so selfish?

611
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That's a shame.

612
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Imagine they off themselves and they were forced,

613
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
they off themselves and they're forced to come back.

614
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh wait.

615
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Did beef oven take his life?

616
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Beethoven?

617
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't know.

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Monkers.

619
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Meatloafs.

620
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You go back in time and change one thing in history,

621
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
but you remain to the timeline.

622
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You return to your timeline at any given moment.

623
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Wait.

624
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So like in theory,

625
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I could be 80 years old in the past

626
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and then it puts me back here.

627
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I kind of be AA.

628
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It'd be like,

629
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Reflings.

630
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Reflings.

631
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Do you like gilf?

632
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Do you like gilfs?

633
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'd take two-third.

634
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't think I can hit that.

635
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm like,

636
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
sorry,

637
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
but I need to be with the Reflings.

638
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Born too late to,

639
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know,

640
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
C-sutton.

641
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Born too early to C-sutton in the future.

642
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Born at the right time.

643
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I don't know.

644
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I don't know.

645
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't know.

646
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Born at the right time to have my Reflings.

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm not pressing.

648
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm not touching anything with the timeline.

649
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm keeping it the way it is.

650
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I like this timeline.

651
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I want to stay on it.

652
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I want to be with my Reflings.

653
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I got,

654
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I got the happy ending.

655
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Okay.

656
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I got the happy ending.

657
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Take care of Granny.

658
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Would you love me with Granny Strongzo?

659
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh,

660
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
would the sweetie,

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
would,

662
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
oh wait,

663
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't know why I'm fucking turning English.

664
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh,

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
would the sweetie like Sa Sweetie?

666
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

667
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You want to suck on my hard boiled sweet day?

668
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
After you and three friends get kidnapped,

669
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Wilson,

670
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you're in trouble and held hostage.

671
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
One of the nappers decides to let you go,

672
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but you have to choose which one of your friends get,

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
um,

674
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
by what,

675
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
if you don't choose,

676
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
both will die.

677
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh no,

678
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm not doing none of that.

679
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm not doing that.

680
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You do not put your friends to death.

681
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's crazy.

682
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That's crazy.

683
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm not even,

684
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm not even participating in this.

685
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Um,

686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
if it results in death,

687
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm,

688
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm not touching it.

689
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's,

690
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
will they both die?

691
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Wait,

692
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
if I click the button,

693
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
they both die?

694
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No.

695
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah.

696
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So I did that right.

697
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Surely I did that right.

698
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Uh,

699
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
hopefully I did that right.

700
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know.

701
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Right, hold on.

702
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
How'd you say?

703
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Shawnee killed everyone.

704
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Honestly.

705
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Jokes on you,

706
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I only have,

707
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't have two friends.

708
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Wait,

709
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
if you bring one friend,

710
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
do you beat the system?

711
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You both get away,

712
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
scot-free.

713
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That was worded awfully.

714
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay.

715
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Thank goodness.

716
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Cause I was like,

717
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
damn,

718
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I have not woken up yet.

719
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Right.

720
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You will receive a lifetime supply of meals

721
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
from your favorite restaurant,

722
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
but you will lose the sense

723
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
of taste and smell.

724
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That defeats the entire

725
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
purpose of enjoying meals

726
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
from your favorite restaurant.

727
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Hi,

728
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
from the dead,

729
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
can you use that

730
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
bring back a dead person button

731
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
for the next one?

732
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Thank you.

733
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Sorry,

734
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
son.

735
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But you would lose

736
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
your sense of taste and smell.

737
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This is redundant.

738
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's not an option.

739
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's redundant.

740
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You have negated the effects

741
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
of even pressing the damn thing.

742
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No point in pressing it.

743
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll just pay for the meals myself.

744
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Okay,

745
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll just work extra hard

746
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
so I can feed myself.

747
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
God damn.

748
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That,

749
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
what if they're very nutritious meals?

750
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean,

751
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
no longer having to pay for food

752
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
sounds like a dub.

753
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Honestly,

754
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
true.

755
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Texture and,

756
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean,

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I didn't even put my tongue

758
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
on a lasagna

759
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
in between the milty cheese

760
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and be like,

761
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
yeah,

762
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
that satisfies me.

763
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No,

764
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
that satisfies me is the taste

765
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and combination

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
of swallowing.

767
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay.

768
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
My,

769
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
my tongue might be

770
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
an exploratory sense,

771
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but like,

772
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I need something

773
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to work off of

774
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
when it comes to food.

775
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Right.

776
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
All new born children

777
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
from here on

778
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
will be born

779
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
perfect

780
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
with immunity

781
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to all diseases

782
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
incredibly intellect,

783
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
incredible intellect

784
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and good locks.

785
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
all single people

787
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
over the age of 30

788
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
will die

789
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
instantaneously.

790
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No.

791
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Relax.

792
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's,

793
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it's okay to have

794
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
natural selection.

795
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Look,

796
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm sorry.

797
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I said it.

798
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's okay to have

799
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
natural selection

800
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
within the populace.

801
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's perfectly normal.

802
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It comes with nature.

803
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Like,

804
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I mean,

805
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
relax.

806
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Why is it 30?

807
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They decided the wall.

808
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
They literally said,

809
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
hags out.

810
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
They said,

811
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
lollipops in hags out.

812
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No,

813
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm not pressing the button.

814
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Relax.

815
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The eugenics button.

816
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Stop.

817
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's crazy.

818
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm 29.

819
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So press it.

820
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hag.

821
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Literally,

822
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
they said hags out.

823
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Relax.

824
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Lollipops in.

825
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Okay.

826
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Everyone's in.

827
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Fine.

828
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That was a bizarre button.

829
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Some of these are getting

830
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
rather,

831
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
rather crazy.

832
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
No hags.

833
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Hag discrimination.

834
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Me dead.

835
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Hollow life would not

836
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
survive such a loss

837
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to their audience.

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Wait,

839
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is hollow life full

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
of hags?

841
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No way.

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't even think

843
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we have one hag.

844
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't think

845
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we have one hag.

846
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Are we the youngest

847
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
agency?

848
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Wait,

849
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
is hollow life full of hags?

850
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
No.

851
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
A lot of VTuber fans

852
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
are third plus two.

853
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The audience.

854
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh,

855
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the audience.

856
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Sorry.

857
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I thought they sent the VTuber.

858
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I was like,

859
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
oh my God,

860
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
are we like a really young agency

861
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
compared to the

862
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
thingy?

863
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They're all hags

864
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
with high voices.

865
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Hag love.

866
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Hag love.

867
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Karuna's 40.

868
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No, she's not.

869
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're,

870
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
you're pulling my leg.

871
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
No one's 40

872
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
in hollow life.

873
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
30 ain't,

874
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
no,

875
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that's hag life.

876
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What are people smoking?

877
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You and she be on high?

878
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
No,

879
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
well,

880
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you think I'm 30?

881
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm not over 30.

882
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm not being funny.

883
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I act like I'm over 30.

884
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You think I'm a hag?

885
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Me more she be?

886
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't think any of us are hags.

887
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Kenda.

888
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh my God.

889
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Danny,

890
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm over there.

891
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You think I'm over there?

892
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Can't wait until you're a gilf.

893
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I literally,

894
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
a gilf gliss go granny.

895
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That alliteration though.

896
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You're done.

897
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
A bit.

898
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh my God.

899
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
A 20-something year old

900
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
with five kid does sound a bit crazy though.

901
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay.

902
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Thank you.

903
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's over for that refling.

904
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Mauds,

905
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
give that refling a backshot.

906
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Old lady's 20.

907
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
At minimum,

908
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you're older than me.

909
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hmm.

910
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A bet face connect is the youngest average talent,

911
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
to be honest.

912
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Hmm.

913
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What's wrong with being over 30?

914
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Absolutely nothing,

915
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
but I don't think I act like I'm,

916
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I feel like 30 is when you mature.

917
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm not over 30.

918
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Wasn't 25 hack?

919
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Or expired Xmas cake?

920
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What?

921
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's just new terminal,

922
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
expired Christmas cake.

923
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Who is walking around

924
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
calling VTubers expired Christmas cakes?

925
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You need to come back

926
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and explain yourself for that comment right now.

927
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What does that even mean?

928
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
A Christmas cake?

929
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh,

930
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that,

931
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
it's a common term.

932
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Matureing is for vegetables.

933
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You have to,

934
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
oh my God.

935
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Hag older than me,

936
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
therefore the age goes up every year.

937
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Okay, that's funny.

938
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Wait, Christmas cake is a term?

939
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
No,

940
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
that's hilarious.

941
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I've not heard of that.

942
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You might as well just start calling people prunes

943
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
while you're at it.

944
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, you're a wrinkly old prune.

945
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
What age is that?

946
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh, oh, it's 20.

947
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What?

948
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Like,

949
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that is hilarious.

950
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
A Christmas cake is a Japanese term

951
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
for a woman past her prime.

952
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's shocking.

953
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's,

954
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
that's,

955
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
fermented VTuber agency.

956
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That is hilarious.

957
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I am closing down VLR

958
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to open that up right now.

959
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's just dedicated to hags only.

960
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Imagine getting called a reason.

961
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Honestly,

962
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Shawnee is the least wee VTuber

963
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I've ever seen.

964
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
True.

965
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm a gamer over a weeb.

966
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Does that mean I'm shunned?

967
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Am I shunned?

968
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But I do want to watch enemies with you.

969
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Actually, that's a side note.

970
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I do want to watch enemies with you guys.

971
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So,

972
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
there'll be a wave three confirmed.

973
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Gen three full of hags.

974
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I mean,

975
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
well, it can't be gen two

976
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
unless you want a hag and a lollipop

977
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
because there's two lollipops.

978
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
VLR lasts long enough

979
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
it'll become a hardcore.

980
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Honestly,

981
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I mean,

982
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
if you guys didn't know,

983
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the girls will renew their contract

984
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
in May 2025

985
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and as an incentive

986
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to stay on,

987
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the split goes to 85.15

988
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and we also purchase them

989
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
an alternative outfit

990
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
they can ask for what they want

991
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and we'll pay the costs for it.

992
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So yeah,

993
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
if you watch JoJo's,

994
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll stop by watching right now.

995
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, isn't JoJo's long?

996
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean,

997
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm talking like 12-episode stuff.

998
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I mean,

999
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
we can even watch a bit of Bentay

1000
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
if you want.

1001
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Like, calm down.

1002
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes.

1003
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Lollibaba gen,

1004
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
just all of them.

1005
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It depends.

1006
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It has various seasons.

1007
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
If you think about it,

1008
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Hale is around for like seven years.

1009
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1010
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Is it that halo you were talking about?

1011
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Is my dress up darling possible?

1012
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Is it long?

1013
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
12?

1014
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, like I'm talking like

1015
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
we sit down for the day

1016
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and watch a 12-episode anime together.

1017
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's what I want to do.

1018
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They said holo, not halo.

1019
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, sorry!

1020
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Sorry.

1021
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I wasn't kidding when I said

1022
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I was a gamer.

1023
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,960
I said it was a gamer, okay? I read Halo. I thought you were talking about Halo, the

1024
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:47,480
hit video game, okay? Master Chief from Fortnite. Sorry. Sorry. Based in gamer build, honestly.

1025
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:54,720
Right. You can get a ton of candy that you love. You'll never be able to read a book.

1026
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,080
Oh no, I'm in a reading book. Sorry. I'm in a reading book. I've been enjoying reading

1027
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,840
a few books. I will abstain from this button. I've been enjoying a good book. And I've

1028
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,880
still not even read Lord of the Rings with you yet. Reading isn't for Mummy today and

1029
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,680
this entire stream is about reading so it's not going well. I don't know what to replace

1030
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:20,200
tomorrow's stream with yet. I don't know if I'll bring up the honey. I don't know if

1031
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,640
you guys saw the schedule. I'm playing Honeycam Studios. That game used to have everyone in

1032
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,320
a freaking grip. Ooh, we're going to do reading stream. Well, this is technically reading,

1033
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,520
is it not? I'm reading chat and I'm reading, will you press the button? You want the bent

1034
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,880
high stream tomorrow? Hmm. Wait, you said Lord of the Rings would be when you graduate.

1035
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,680
Oh, did I? For the book? Okay, we're not reading Lord of the Rings anytime soon then. I still,

1036
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,240
put me back in the ring, Chief. I still got it. I still got it, okay? I got that doll.

1037
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,840
Let me back in the ring. Bunny Garden. It's no for me. It's no for me. I'll have a hunt

1038
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,720
around and see if I can find a few shorter games. I just stopped being sad when I watched

1039
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,600
Johnny. No pass on this. Okay, you can make all the world feel happy, but you become sad.

1040
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:21,880
I become sad. Um, I don't think I can stream very well if I'm in a bad mood. A cheese, oh,

1041
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:30,320
a chess blitz stream when? Um, there's a solid one here, you like that? What remains of Edith

1042
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,600
Flint? I'm playing that in three weeks. I wrote that down because someone recommended it and

1043
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,440
it was short. Already depressed, I'll push the button. Oh, I'll be fine. Nothing changes for

1044
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,120
me, but the world gets better. Why not? Oh, no, I'm not that sad. I'm quite, I'm always quite

1045
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,720
neutral or happy. I don't think it, wait, I don't, can I make you as happy if I'm depressed?

1046
00:40:51,720 --> 00:41:00,360
I don't know. I feel like I can't do it because if I'm depressed, I can't even stream. An actual

1047
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,160
dilemma for once. This is probably the first one that I've actually had a dilemma with.

1048
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,320
Have you played Sucker for Love? I have not. I can't be sad when watching you pass. Press the

1049
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,520
button. I'm already at that stage. If Stroni was sad, I would be sad. Yeah, literally, I'd be

1050
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,240
greeting over anything and making you guys upset. So no. Oh, wow, I'm in the minority. This is the

1051
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,800
first question I've been in the minority. Wow. Oh, no, I couldn't be sad. I feel like I'd wrought

1052
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:36,320
away, I'd waste away. Oh, no, that's the first one I failed where I don't, I'm not with the

1053
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,600
majority. Oh, wait, what did I just do? Oops. Oh, sorry. I thought I was on the same one. I'm so

1054
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,800
sorry. I thought I was on the same one. What did I say no to? Half Life 3 comes out, but you never

1055
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,320
get to play it. And I said, no. Oops. Okay, let's actually do it. Sorry. The Byzantine

1056
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:10,360
Empire is revived. What? What kind of question is that? What kind of question is this? Oh, my

1057
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:18,080
god. I thought this is like a funny thing. Yeah. Oh, this is bizarre. How did that even get in?

1058
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:31,600
Did they not review the submitted questions? What the fuck? That's bizarre. That's bizarre. We're

1059
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:38,800
skipping, we're skipping this. We're not, this isn't a submission or anything of anything. What the

1060
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,040
fuck? What the fuck? We're skipping. We're not even looking at the results. Okay. That was bizarre.

1061
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,800
Anyway, unlimited supply of your favorite cereal for the rest of your life, but you can't have any

1062
00:42:50,800 --> 00:43:00,160
milk with it. This, people love submitting things that negate the benefit of the first one. Like,

1063
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,720
here's the benefit. Oh, by the way, we're gonna negate it. Okay, so there's pointless then. There's

1064
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,200
no point to it. Like, I'm lactose intolerant. Anyway, let's go. Press. I don't even use milk.

1065
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,240
Water and cereal, it is. Don't ever speak for the rest of the stream. Don't make me ever think

1066
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:28,720
about watery Cheerios. I don't want to think about watery Cheerios, okay? Okay, you're allowed to

1067
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:36,000
speak, but don't do that again. Okay. Juice and cereal. What kind of juice? How do you put juice

1068
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,080
in Cheerios? Substitute with yogurt. Time out that reflint. Never cook again.

1069
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Wait, we can give it to the people who need it. Oh, if it's boxed up, then sure, I'd donate that

1070
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:55,440
stuff. I don't eat cereal anyway. Yeah, that's fine. We'll box it up and we'll give it to food

1071
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,440
banks. I have no problem with that. I'm not fussed for cereal. It's just like sugary thingy anyway.

1072
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,600
Wait, hold up. Is Cheerios your favorite? I like Honey Cheerios. I like Frosted Shreddies,

1073
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:16,640
and I like Crunchy Knot. It's called Crunchy Knot in the UK. Stop laughing. Stop it Americans.

1074
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,960
I know you're laughing right now. It's called Crunchy Knot. It's the name of the cereal.

1075
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,320
It's not your sock, okay? It's not your crusty sock. It's called Crunchy Knot. It is. It's what

1076
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:39,440
the cereal's called. Stop. That nut, oh man. Base, I love those Crunchy Knot. Laugh at her. No,

1077
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,480
it's what it's called. My nuts a bit more chewy, sadly. You're right. It's our Crunchy Socks. I

1078
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,000
was going to make the most disgusting ASMR. Someone tweeted something hilarious, and it was like a

1079
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,240
crunchy sock, and I was like, I really want to make an ASMR of me munching, and it's like girlfriend

1080
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,160
munches on your crusty sock ASMR at the bottom of your bed while you sleep or something like that,

1081
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,000
and it's absolutely disgusting. Actually, I'm going to write that down before I forget. Write that down.

1082
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:25,680
Write that down. Girlfriend munches on your crusty sock ASMR, and it's just me like, that's delicious,

1083
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,880
and all of that, and I'm munching away. That's disgusting. No way, that's foul, but it's so funny.

1084
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,120
It is foul. That's why I want to make it. Okay, you've become the funniest person on the planet.

1085
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,360
You can only talk in jokes, and they're always Chuck Norris jokes. Again with the negation.

1086
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,680
I'm going to need you to come up with abstract concepts that these two don't relate, but they're

1087
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:02,560
on a level, whether that be philosophical, physical, some sort of same level. But Chuck Norris jokes

1088
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,200
are funny. I can't even remember. Can we just go back to unbirth? You know what, you're done.

1089
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,560
Are you saying Chuck Norris isn't funny? What's the Chuck Norris thing? I can't remember.

1090
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,480
I've literally forgotten the Chuck Norris memes. Stroni's already the funniest person on the planet.

1091
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,360
You stop that, you give me an ego. We all know women can't be funny.

1092
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm accidentally humorous. That's why I am. That's by accident. Does that make you the only person

1093
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,400
on the planet? Chuck Norris jokes are really not. Chuck Norris doesn't eat honey. He chews bees.

1094
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:42,080
Ah, right. Okay, I remember. I remember. I remember. I remember. Get on with the funniest.

1095
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:50,160
The sin of greed is not here. Again, I'm going to say no. I don't know. I will not press. You

1096
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:56,240
cannot tempt me, devil. But yeah. Oh, wow. Okay, majority vote there. Only 19%. We're like, yeah,

1097
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:05,760
that's good. Okay, you become completely immortal. I don't like that. If humanity hasn't made it to

1098
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,640
interstellar travel and sun has gone supernova, you will drift in space alone still. No,

1099
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,480
absolutely not. See, the reason why I like vampires is because you know, if you've ever had enough,

1100
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,880
you can just go to someone, go and do as a favor pal. See this bit of wood, go and just hammer it

1101
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,440
through my chest. That'd be great pal. Just stay up, right? But this version, absolutely not. It's

1102
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:36,080
the most horrific thing I have ever seen. Like vampire, you take it, you're crazy. Just jumping

1103
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,800
to a black hole. A bit of cheeky spaghettification to solve the problem. Why not? Being stuck in

1104
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,240
space doesn't sound so bad. There's no internet in space. Who wants to become immortal? Are you crazy?

1105
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,920
Understand all truth of the universe but can never talk to others again. Well, good thing,

1106
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,080
I know sign language. Boom. And I can write stuff down on paper. Boom. Press that,

1107
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,960
motherfucker. Oh wait, how am I supposed to livestream? Would you guys still watch me if

1108
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,320
the way I communicated was by doing, like, I like to do sign language and write stuff down?

1109
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,440
Can I still make noises? It says talk. If I can still make noises, all you're gonna hear is like

1110
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:33,680
just use a talk text to speech stream, morse code stream. I have no idea what I've just said

1111
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:41,360
if I actually said anything. If TTS has a Scottish accent, I mean, I wouldn't understand you one bit

1112
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,520
but sure. But imagine all of the conspiracy theories I can tell you about. Come on, that's like

1113
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:57,200
unlimited content. Wait, how would we get ASMR? It would just be non-talking ASMR. So congrats to

1114
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,560
the people that don't like talking ASMR. I got you covered. You press the button but the button

1115
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:09,040
doesn't work. Go for it then. Wait, why did no one press that? She chose knowledge over us. No,

1116
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:18,880
I'll give you the details, okay? Eh, no talking ASMR. I don't like it. You gain the power to stop

1117
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:27,840
time as long as you want and as often as you want but while time has stopped, you age normally

1118
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,360
and each time you restart, you age, bruv, again with the negation.

1119
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:45,920
I mean, I guess it's optional. I can't imagine I'm up to anything but to skip six months of health

1120
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:54,640
is insane though. You guys are saying easy press? You gain the power to stop time as long as you want.

1121
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,840
What would I need to do with that? I mean, I guess if I had just all lined up at convention,

1122
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,880
it'd be worth it. Nah, I don't think I like that. I guess if it's optional to have it as a back

1123
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,000
pocket ability, like say you wear, I think someone said car crash there. Yeah, say if you knew you

1124
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,960
were about to be in a car crash. Mugging the car crash? Okay. I'm pressing it because it's an optional

1125
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:28,560
ability. You don't have to activate it but it could be life or death. So I'm actually not too

1126
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:38,560
raging at it. You can ink with any women you want just by pointing at them and asking but you must

1127
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:44,960
watch the notebook each time. This is just an OG, son. What's going on here? You guys, I'm pretty

1128
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:56,080
sure that Snowberries just watched the notebook with icicle. Can we change this to a reflin instead?

1129
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,120
You can have... Oh, I said the word sorry, I did. I just slapped my mouth there. If you heard that,

1130
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,480
you can have... You can ink. Hey, Strani, never made me pointing at you but I need to ask you

1131
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,120
something. We can already do this. Don't need to do that one more minute. That's all good. I

1132
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,320
literally just smacked my mouth there. Right, let's just pretend this says refling. Thank you. I'll

1133
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:29,760
take it. Thank you very much. Yeah, 60% said I. Well, Strani doesn't want to ink with me. No, because

1134
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:40,480
it specifies every time you ink. Yeah, but with a partner. I mean, that could be the aftercare.

1135
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,040
Oh, let's slap on the notebook. How long's the notebook? I've never seen it. I don't know what

1136
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,680
it's about, to be honest. Apparently, refling's your in it. You're featured in it.

1137
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,640
Strani, you just need to ask. I'd cry every time. It's too long. It's two hours.

1138
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,840
It would be wild if the movie just flashed in your head during... Google says it's two hours and 10

1139
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:10,240
minutes. Oh, that's quite a lot. Can't be aftercare. You need to watch before. But someone said it

1140
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:18,080
makes you cry. You have an unlimited amount of cash, power, and good looks. But Justin Bieber is

1141
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:24,240
your roommate for the rest of your life. He acts like a massive douchebag. Is this... How old is

1142
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:31,920
this website? Is this like an old-ass question? Do you remember the hate that Justin Bieber used to

1143
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:41,760
get? Oh my god. Mail on stream. Literally not having that. Like, I feel like... Right, this is just

1144
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:49,520
me. I feel like if you never work towards something, like, you never get that satisfaction of trying

1145
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,760
hard and getting it to pay off. Like, if it's just handed to you, so is but. This is just me. If it's

1146
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,720
just handed to you, you've got nothing to work towards. Like, now don't get me wrong. Capitalism,

1147
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,040
bad and all that. But if you had unlimited money, what experiences do you get other than making

1148
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:14,400
poor people miserable and, like, squandering over, like, falling out your feet to try and get a tip

1149
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:22,960
from you type thing? Like, is that what gives, you know, billionaire? I would literally... You know,

1150
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,200
actually, if I had unlimited money, I think I'd bring back the arts. I want architecture. I want

1151
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,760
sandstone architecture back in. I want rid of this new age buildings. I want historical, beautiful

1152
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,160
features. I want the arts back. Have you seen the churches made in the 15th century? Stunning,

1153
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:50,880
beautiful, still standing. And then churches today are, like, ugly. I'm here for the culture. When we

1154
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:58,480
play Civilian Civilization 5, I'm here for the culture, okay? I want culture. I like culture,

1155
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,320
okay? Done with modern architecture, exactly. Using limited money to lobby every Congress,

1156
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,080
parliament on earth to do your bidding. Now you're talking, like, a real refling. I like that, I like

1157
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:20,400
that. Holy Bacus, bring back past architecture. Cultural victory, reject modern return to Ziggurats.

1158
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,720
Cultural victory. No way to get rid of him means you can kill him. You can kill him?

1159
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,960
Actually, yeah, he doesn't have to be alive. And if I have unlimited power, I mean, no one's gonna

1160
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,520
find out. He acts like a mess and... Oh, there's no way to get rid of him. Oh, no, sorry. It's not worth it.

1161
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,880
It's not worth it, okay? You can choose to save the life of any loved one or friend at will,

1162
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:59,120
but they will no longer remember who you are. I don't... I'm not one for meddling with nature. I

1163
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:08,000
find it quite rather... I think when you're, you know, I don't believe in, like, fate or, like,

1164
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,240
you know, you're destined for this or that. But I'm not a fan of, like, Trump and nature. Like,

1165
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:20,800
I'll let nature do its course, you know? I'd press it for you. Oh, Riefling! What the...

1166
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,480
Don't say that. Are you trying to make us cry? It's like first thing in the morning. Are you

1167
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,920
trying to make us cry? Oh, my God. I press it to love someone. You sometimes you have to be a stranger.

1168
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,680
Well, literally, I don't know if you guys remember Harry Potter where Hermione had to

1169
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,920
get her parents to forget or I'm like, oh, my God. I hope she can reverse that.

1170
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,400
Um, Spider-Man already did that. I doubt my friends are getting into many life or death,

1171
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:56,400
but I could re-meet them and check they existed. I don't know. Imagine saving a parent. Oh,

1172
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,280
it didn't sound... Oh, I don't know if I can even speak on that because I've not lost a parent.

1173
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,680
I'd probably feel way different at a later date, but

1174
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:18,560
that route forgetting you as well is like really... It's not... Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not touching

1175
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,400
that. I'm not touching it. Well, yeah, I'm in the minority with that one. That scares me. That

1176
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:35,680
kind of stuff scares me. That one was a hard one. That was not an easy one.

1177
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,480
Johnny, I would also press it for you. I would make you happy even if I meant I could never...

1178
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,120
You never knew who I was. That's so sad though. Are you trying to make me great? I'll greet

1179
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,720
first thing in the morning. Don't think I want. Learn to love yourself and then save yourself,

1180
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,600
but they will remember everyone else close to them. That was not easy. I didn't like that. Better

1181
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,560
have it than not to have it. No one can say you got to use it. Oh, that's true. Well, I've just

1182
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:10,160
passed on it. Learn to love... Yes. You get to make friends all over again if you press it. That's

1183
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:21,360
true. You get to download as many songs as you want. How old is this question? iPod? You get to...

1184
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,840
I have never... That's an ancient relic by today's standards. It's not even a thing anymore.

1185
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:37,520
You get to download as many songs as you want on your iPod. The songs have... Again with Justin...

1186
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:44,160
This is old. We're skipping. This is so old. The age is showing of this question. That's crazy.

1187
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:54,560
I'm literally lying while I go brrrrr. I'd press this. It doesn't say you have to listen to any of it.

1188
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,880
You young ones don't even know what an iPod is. Easiest press to get an iPod. It's an iPod

1189
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:08,800
with a headphone jack. I still use an iPod for work. Oh, replaying. Are you an OG son?

1190
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:17,520
All right. We've found the ancient tip. You can see through all holding, but you cannot turn the

1191
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:27,360
power off. Oh, no. That's not for me. I feel like you'd get desensitized very quickly, but that's

1192
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:39,520
not for me. No. Yeah, I'm skipping. Well, 41% said I. No, that's no right. That's no right. You're

1193
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:47,040
getting done for that. That's indecent. I'd press it only if I'm filthy rich. Oh, so you could pick

1194
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:54,240
and choose who's around you. We've got an Asian population, so nah, I'll pass. You have incredible

1195
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,200
art skills, but you're unable to share it on the internet for your entire life. That's funny,

1196
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:07,760
because I actually wanted to pick up art when I retire and become a wee artist. I'm going to skip

1197
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:15,440
because you can develop art skills over years. Yes, it takes years, but that's the progress. That's

1198
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,720
the journey. It's a part of the journey. It's not about when it comes to Lord of the Rings,

1199
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:26,240
you didn't skip to Mount Doom, did you? And pop the ring in. No. You take the journey. You

1200
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:34,560
watch your progress. You watch your craft evolve. Just have someone else share it. You know what?

1201
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,360
See your reef lens and your smart ways of just getting around the rules. That's actually really

1202
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,800
smart. Please don't type that again. You're going to start ruining these if you get the lip around.

1203
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:54,320
And that is hilarious. NDA forbids me from sharing art online. You can share art in any other way.

1204
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,840
Loop polling it. Honestly, I'll get you guys to loop poll it for me, because I'll take that. I love

1205
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,760
art. I think it's amazing. Emi drew that one piece of artwork for herself. Well, she's actually

1206
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:12,080
drawn multiple with it. That one banner-esque one, it was absolutely insane quality. Like insane.

1207
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:22,400
72% of the people have pressed this button whilst 27% did not. Yeah, literally skirt the rules.

1208
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,480
We create a new internet. We're toppling the system, strongy. Just for me. Stop it. You're making me

1209
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,480
blue. It feels good to see people improve their skills over time. Press equals sell to some random

1210
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,200
private collection. It's easy and rich. Speed runs. Reeflings pull together to make a strongy

1211
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:50,480
art. Oh, you can be anywhere you want in your room right now. Reefling under your desk. But you have to

1212
01:00:50,480 --> 01:01:03,040
be a pawn. What is- I don't understand how that's even- Oh, do you want to become a horse? It's

1213
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,760
basically asking do you want to become a horse? No, there's not going to be a horse girl for Jen

1214
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:14,480
too. Stop asking. It doesn't- Like, aw, you just randomly turn into a horse for the rest of your

1215
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,960
life. Bruv. That's not how none of this works. Again, the freaking horses. I can't escape.

1216
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,600
Even pony calls. You're done. Strongy pony. Strongy show horse.

1217
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:36,560
MLP brunies winning. Any cloffers, honestly. A pony cannot watch streams. This sucks.

1218
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:43,200
The writer barely disguised- The writer's barely disguised fish. That is hilarious. No, we're not

1219
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,600
becoming a freaking pony. Are you joking? Yeah, let-

1220
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,160
Oh, some people have had enough of the system if they'll happily become a pony.

1221
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:00,960
What's the downside? Oh, honestly. Instead of a cuttlefish I'm a seahorse. Oh, that's kind of cute.

1222
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:10,400
Friendship is magic and magic is heresy. There's 32,000 brunies. We're on to them. We've caught them

1223
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,000
in 4K. You understand every human language in existence? That's a good one, but you are a mutant

1224
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:25,280
can never- Again with the negation! Here is cool thing. Here's negation. Am I like ruining this

1225
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:32,640
little fun website by pointing out the major flaws of the questions? I'm passing on that. Sorry,

1226
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,880
I need my communication skills. Unless, you know, the only other exception is I get to learn everything

1227
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,720
and then I get to do my tinfoil hat stream with full confidence.

1228
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:52,640
Yeah, 65% said no, which is right. You make one horrible event in the past cease to exist,

1229
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,440
but you will be responsible for a hor- No, that-

1230
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:03,840
This is just a circle! Remove one to gain one. You have given us a circle. Give us a better one.

1231
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:10,320
You have given us a dang circle. Just write or use a TTS absolute dub, honestly.

1232
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:20,560
Can you choose the event? I don't know. I mean, this makes you an A tier translator,

1233
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,960
but yeah, 90% of superpower with downsides is literally just coolest thing ever, followed by

1234
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,880
wow, this sucks, yeah. If I get to pick the horrible event I'm responsible for,

1235
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:37,840
I don't know what kind of human event I would be comfortable causing. Can we call it, like,

1236
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:44,000
the mass inking maybe? And be like, all guys around the world couldn't go to work that day

1237
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,360
because they can't feel their thighs after how hard they just inked, you know? Like,

1238
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:55,760
something like that? Would that work? Is that fine? I'd be fine causing that, like, catastrophe.

1239
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,360
I'm fine with that. That's fine. I'll take one for the team. I'll make some of the most

1240
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:06,640
great collapse of capitalism. Steady. We don't have a system yet to swoop in with. You get to

1241
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,040
be a world-famous vtuber, but you're a Scottish cuttlefish. Stop! That's so funny. Not exactly

1242
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:19,280
world-famous, steady on. Strani, aren't you planning on killing humanity via siren feeding?

1243
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:26,880
Look, you've caught me in a bit of a pickle, but maybe there was some talk of that. Not at the

1244
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,800
moment, though. Not at the moment. I'm just bing-chinging. Dang it. Bing-chinging. She's gonna

1245
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:40,960
make us ink. Domain expansion, infinite inkworks, honestly. Strani, I wish to be responsible for

1246
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:50,080
coming again. Ink again. The Great Brown Noise incident of 54. The day Strani made the entire

1247
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:59,280
population ink. Eh, right. Yeah, but she's kind of bad at it. Okay, okay. Your ability to listen,

1248
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:08,560
touch, taste, smell, and conversation are improved. You lose the ability to say,

1249
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:14,640
nah, I can't be blind, so I need my bowls. I think if I had to pick between losing a sense,

1250
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:23,760
first is smell. Couldn't... first is smell. Then... so touch is actually a really dangerous one to

1251
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,640
lose because that's how you tell you're injured or whatever, but thankfully I don't do anything that's

1252
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:36,720
injury-based. You just become the daredevil. I'd lose my sense of pain. Five head, lose your sense

1253
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:44,560
of temperature because you're... was it... didn't Vsauce? Vsauce was like, oh, I swear God, if my

1254
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,600
dad's about to burst in this room, I can hear him listen. Right, no, we're skipping that one. I'd like

1255
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:56,560
to keep my eyeballs, please. Right, you can turn into any animal that you've seen with your own eyes,

1256
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:02,480
not in a photo. Right, so we've become the green guy from Team Titans, I've forgotten his name,

1257
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,360
but you have to die in the animal form to go back. You have to die in the animal form

1258
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:18,240
to go back. That's so bizarre. That doesn't make sense. If you lose your sense of touch,

1259
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,440
you can't ink. I take it back, I don't want that one. Smell is an easy one to lose, yeah.

1260
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,800
Would I experience the pain? Yeah, like, a zoo? Beast... oh, Beast Boy's name, okay, that makes sense.

1261
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,480
Um, bunch of the electric cables, honestly, that's pretty... I wonder how easy it would be

1262
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,360
to pop your clogs if you're an animal. Being like, hmm, I will walk in front of this car now. No,

1263
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:51,600
I'm skipping this. I'm skipping, I don't like it, I'm scared. Oh wow, we're in the minority, oh my.

1264
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,000
You have the fastest internet for free, you can play any game online for free and never

1265
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,200
have to pay for membership. So literally VTuber, but ultimate VTuber, but you must watch a minimum of

1266
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:19,040
this age terribly. This is such an old, oh no. If I had to waste three hours a day on anything,

1267
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,240
I don't have enough time to stream. That's not a benefit, okay? It's, I'm already doing it. Someone

1268
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:31,840
says, oh okay dude, okay dude, no downside. That is far too much time commitment, literally three

1269
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:40,560
hours is insane. I'm stretching, I already do it. Okay, yous are all done. I would watch

1270
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:48,480
all the popcorn, Elizabeth's popcorn. I'd press it plus, I can just send it to my friends as a joke.

1271
01:07:48,480 --> 01:08:00,160
Does ASMR count? Is there, is there Lebanese ASMR of like two chicks together? I didn't even know

1272
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:10,400
that was a thing. Oh girls, are you ready for off collab? That's awful, we're skipping that one.

1273
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,600
I do not have three hours a day. I, I need to give everything to the refunds, okay?

1274
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:22,080
Lebanese, yes. The clam, slammy, smart. There's definitely female for female ASMR.

1275
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:31,040
And then everything exists. I don't think I've ever looked up. Hmm, it's sad people don't have time

1276
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:38,160
for popcorn anymore. That's terrible. You can temporarily take over the body of any person

1277
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,720
on earth, and you can turn back into yourself whenever, but they die, oh,

1278
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:52,000
Merve, Merve. Okay, hold on. If I want to become an assassin to take down,

1279
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,280
you can temporarily take over the body and turn back, but they die.

1280
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:07,600
They die after you leave their body. So I'm a walking death note. Yeah, I'll do it. I'm down with

1281
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:14,080
stop and refling the high table down with the high table reeflings. Yes. Yes.

1282
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,880
End me pl- No! End me PLS. Reefling, Brian. KFP Spidey. Thank you for the five. No.

1283
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,360
We're not doing that. Ain't that basically what siren does anyway? True. So it's not really

1284
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,520
anything too particularly new concept wise. Strone's body hopping across the world

1285
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,440
and fast tracking her goal of ending the world, honestly. You can foresee the future

1286
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,720
reeflings. I predict an inking for you. Yes, yes. Did I guess right? Are you inking?

1287
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:58,160
Okay, soon you will ink within the next week. You cannot prevent anything that will occur.

1288
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:04,480
I think having foresight would be good. I get the- Wait, no, you can't prevent it.

1289
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,080
Are you serious? Are you serious? So you can only what? Mentally prepare? Get inside me?

1290
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,880
Get inside me, mama. Brian, you're not supposed to say that out loud. Thank you, boy.

1291
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:24,000
I mean, I can. I'll do it right now. Okay, there we go. I'm inside. Do you feel me?

1292
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,120
Just means you can prepare for it. So I can't prevent it from occurring, but I can prepare

1293
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,440
around it. I'd say that's a benefit. If I can prepare around it, I'll take it.

1294
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:44,160
Yeah, I inked. Or someone else could defy fate for you. Yeah, yeah, again, definitely. Get ready

1295
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,720
to see a lot of death. This would put me in such a defeats mentality. I cannot change the future,

1296
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:56,640
so what does it matter? I don't know. I guess like, it says you can't prevent it. So say you

1297
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,600
put a hundred bucks in the stock market and saw ahead like where it would go. You can't change

1298
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,280
what the stock market is going to change to. Anyway, damn it, the stock markets won't want it,

1299
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:11,040
but just as an example off the top of my head, stop wiggling your toes while in there. It tickles.

1300
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:16,080
I can't help it. The weird thing was, I was actually violently wiggling my toes when you typed

1301
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:22,240
that. Are you in my room? Refling? Refling? Are you here? I'm getting nervous. How did you know

1302
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:28,400
I was wiggling my toes the moment I said that? Hey, Astroni, you can be in me whenever you want

1303
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:34,880
and replay. Right. You have the power to teleport anywhere at any time, past or future. You are

1304
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,000
doomed to be a homeless person and can't change your fate. So again, we can just get around this.

1305
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,560
I don't have to have a legal like in the legality of having a freaking thing in my name. Like,

1306
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,280
it's just a bingty name. Traveling with zero ain't got to be a home. Yeah, literally like

1307
01:11:54,240 --> 01:12:00,000
sure, it's already after the Baloch, Balochu stream, hotel, yeah, hotel. Again, we can get around this.

1308
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:08,080
Like, I think that would be really good to cut about. You become the emperor of earth,

1309
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:15,440
ruling over the entire human, wait, people will listen to me and we can set up a system that's

1310
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:22,880
sustainable. Hold on a minute. Other spacefaring civilizations, many of them hostile, discover

1311
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,760
earth and we'll try to conquer the planet. I don't know if I could submit people to defend

1312
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:38,400
and get put to death. I don't like that. For the m, is this a warhammer 40k reference?

1313
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:45,840
I will kneel to emperor stroney and die in her honor. No, I don't want to send just the war

1314
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:52,640
purge the Zenoes. This is just 40k for the empire for mommy. No, I don't want to send

1315
01:12:52,640 --> 01:13:02,320
just the war and defend me. Surely if I can get the planet to all agree on the mission objective,

1316
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:10,160
then we'd maybe get away with it. It says many of them hostile. You know what? In theory,

1317
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:18,160
we could make pals with someone who's really nice. We'll try. We are the emperor's hammer. No,

1318
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,600
you're fine. The planet broke before the garden. Hey, it's self defense coming on. Let us and

1319
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,360
let's stop. You're not supposed to defend me to the death. You're supposed to live a good and

1320
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:34,880
happy life. Okay, right next. You are granted the scientific knowledge needed to produce

1321
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,000
limitless energy for the rest of the world at an affordable cost. Yes, because public sectors

1322
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:49,920
should be owned by the public. Shocking. I know. You must live as a pauper and end your days with

1323
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:58,400
the solitary death in a remote shack in the woods. Yeah, you mean the the inking, the inking

1324
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:06,880
shack in the middle of nowhere? Yes. You're trolling, right? What's the downside? Oh, you're poor.

1325
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:14,400
Aspondent, poor, relax. It's not that big a deal. It's honestly not that big a deal,

1326
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:21,680
sauce. It is not that big a deal. Relax. Infinite energy and I get the farm with the reeflings.

1327
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,680
It doesn't mean you guys can't own a PC in there and we can all meme on the internet

1328
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,520
and play games like we can finally play couch co-op games together.

1329
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,000
I'm the old man in the movies that gives advice to the main character. No internet in the shack.

1330
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,040
Well, you guys can own internet. I've said none, but you're not owning it.

1331
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,280
Oh, my God. Why are we asking that?

1332
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,120
Oh, my God.

1333
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,600
What is with these questions? Oh, by the way, Al Qaeda never did that. Relax. I'm not touching

1334
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:05,920
that. I'm not touching that word. Do these not get screened? If you press the red button, you gain

1335
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:13,680
a quadrillion dollars offered by the president. But you are told by the president to buy only

1336
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:19,920
things that are cheaper than candy. Well, there's like, oh, sorry. There's like, sorry, I dropped my

1337
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:26,560
pen on the thing. There's like gold candy. I'm sure there's like some ridiculous, this candy bar

1338
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,960
costs 12,000 US dollars due to the importation. We covered it in gold, all that pitch. Sorry,

1339
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,560
it's free money. It's free money and I can do so much with it. There'll be one candy bar out there

1340
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,840
that's covered in gold. I assure you, look up right now, type in most expensive candy in the

1341
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,440
world and it'll be some pitch from Dubai and covered in gold. Free money. I can do a lot

1342
01:15:49,440 --> 01:16:04,000
with that money. Okay. Did you say cheapest candy? Oh no. That doesn't make sense then.

1343
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:18,000
That makes, wait, you can only buy things that are cheaper than one cent. So nothing.

1344
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,560
So you have negated the button.

1345
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,640
What's the point? The lip hold would require the government to artificially inflate the price

1346
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,160
of candy. But then again, it really depends on what market. Cheapest can, it'll be a sin. There's

1347
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:42,560
no, there'll be mass produce. That was absolutely rubbish. Terrible button. Go back to the drawing

1348
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:50,240
room. Be in rule of your own country. Can we get a strongy island? But you will become the most

1349
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,760
hated rule in the history of the world. I don't want you guys to hate me though. Is it because I

1350
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:02,240
do too much mandatory inking? Be honest, is it the mandatory inking? And I have the right to not

1351
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:08,480
be prosecuted for anything I may or may not do to you? Smile. Is that why you hate me? And then

1352
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:15,680
the rest of the world hates me because they couldn't get an invite to strongy islands, okay? So that's

1353
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:21,520
the reason why people hate me. It's because they're like, I'm not, I'm not a reflander. Don't get an

1354
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:31,280
invite to the islands. Yeah? Yeah? Come on, shouldn't bless. Yeah, I'm pressing it. The reason the world

1355
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:40,800
they hated her because she did what she wanted. Yeah, I'm pressing that. Every girl you meet

1356
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,360
will fall in love with you. I'll swap the genders. So every refling you meet will fall in love with

1357
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,280
you, but you will never fall in love with them. Oh, that's sad. No, I don't like that one. No,

1358
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,080
I don't like that one. I wouldn't try as hard as much if like I wasn't in love with my reflins.

1359
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:02,960
Hmm. I don't like that one. You have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere. Oh my god,

1360
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:12,800
the button predicted Fortnite. Under Fortnite, Battle Pass. I just shit all my ass and I booted up my

1361
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:23,440
PC because I need me to get that Fortnite Battle Pass. Tada. I like Fortnite. It's nighttime.

1362
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:31,120
You remember that show, Adventure Time. What's the point? Some of these, they do be negating

1363
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:38,560
pretty hard after a while. Get out of my head. Continually blue folds. By stormy going, no,

1364
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:47,200
you have the ability to build anything, any time, anywhere at Fortnite. You lack the materials

1365
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,160
needed and always have to find or buy them in order to build what you want.

1366
01:18:52,400 --> 01:19:00,160
I'm, I'm going to say something controversial, but isn't that what joiners do? This button says,

1367
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:06,640
do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Yes. Okay, go to B&Q and pick up the stuff. That's

1368
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,640
literally what the, it's just said. And for the Aussies, your version is bunnings. I don't know

1369
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:20,400
what B&Q is in America. That literally said, do you want to become a joiner? Yes or no? Okay,

1370
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,520
go pick up the materials for the job. Okay. You mean like everyone else in the world?

1371
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:34,080
So yeah. Okay. I'll take the, I'll take the joiner skill. Sure. Did you just say a real sense?

1372
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:43,440
What? B&Q? Is this an ad? No. Be an architect, I guess. Wouldn't you need, need any materials you

1373
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:48,320
can make? Do you want to be Bob the Builder, but slightly worse? You lack the materials and always

1374
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,440
have to find or buy them. That's nonsense. Do you want to become a joiner? Sure. I'll take,

1375
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,760
I'll take a stab at it. You had the CEO at Facebook. You can't make an account.

1376
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:11,520
Are you kidding me? He's aged terribly. It's just, a joiner is a construction worker. Oh,

1377
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,720
do you guys not say joiner? What do you say? What's a man that comes into your house and like fixes

1378
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:31,280
stuff? A handyman, a contractor. Okay. A mechanic, handyman, repairman, a plumber.

1379
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,280
Force promote veiler in the algorithm? Ah, you've got me. I'm pressing that yank. I don't even have

1380
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,600
a Facebook account. That stuff was bad news many years ago. You should delete your Facebook account

1381
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,880
if you have one. Bad, bad, bad. Very bad. No, no, no, no, no. Bad, bad, bad. I said,

1382
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,920
I'm not allowed an account, but I didn't say I'm not allowed a veiler or a fan account. Okay. I

1383
01:20:53,920 --> 01:21:03,520
said what I said. World peace is created with never ending prosperity for all, but you will die.

1384
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,720
No one will ever know what you did. Okay, but how quickly do I die? Like,

1385
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:12,480
does that still get a chance that the 80 years or the microplastics get me or is it like I die

1386
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:22,800
instantly? Hmm. I don't want to die right now. I've not even like, come on. Gen two is almost

1387
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,280
created. The concept art's almost been accepted. Like, at least let me get gen two and three out

1388
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,160
so I can help these girls, you know, become full time content creators. Once, once they're all set

1389
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:40,560
up, I'm happy I can pop my clogs. Okay. Goodbye, strongy. No. If I can't enjoy it, no one gets

1390
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:47,040
prosperity. Okay, that's funny though. Can I wait to press skip? It says prosperity for all.

1391
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,320
That includes gen two and three. I know, but I need to pick them. I need to pick the girls.

1392
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,400
I need to be able to pick the girls. Honestly, it was really fun going through applications.

1393
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,680
I cannot tell you how many times I got so needed. Yeah, I got sang to so much. And like,

1394
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,360
people were trying to speak Japanese and I'm like, we're not that kind of agency where you need to

1395
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:16,400
speak Japanese randomly. Like, no, you can speak English. Gen two already? No, in a year. It takes

1396
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,720
a year to produce a generation. For me anyway, I give, I like to think I give artists fair time.

1397
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,320
We're just getting the concepts and then confirmation will be at a later date that it's going to be

1398
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,200
there. How can there be peace of strongy's not there? I will never know peace. Oh, are you flying?

1399
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:40,880
Um, one year of gestation. Yes, I will confirm when the lights are off. I repeat, I will confirm

1400
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,680
when the lights are off. I'll give you a date, a time. We do it at the exact same time. And yeah,

1401
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:50,720
there'll be buns in this oven all right. There'll be six in the oven this time. Last time it was five.

1402
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,520
They're still cooking. Yeah, they're they're not even a twinkle in your eye yet because no one's

1403
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,560
like production doesn't start back and I can tell you all about production.

1404
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:12,320
One year sounds very fast. Actually, it's not. One year apart isn't fast at all in terms of

1405
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:21,280
gents. There's only going to be three gents. So yeah, one year apart, roughly, roughly, not not

1406
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:28,080
gin first, relax, but one year apart, roughly. Not even. If you're reincarnated, then you are born

1407
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:35,200
into a world of peace and prosperity. I wish it was possible. The breeder refling didn't let her cook.

1408
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:39,680
Yes. No, I'm happy to talk about all the behind the scenes stuff. Obviously, I can I'll can talk

1409
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:46,400
about it a bit more when gen two is confirmed for production. We're currently working on a

1410
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:52,640
clipping program. Damn, three gents literally walking out of your I'm whistling as I whenever I

1411
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:57,360
ride a bike, I'm whistling. That is how that's how terrible it is. One year is not fast at

1412
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:03,600
standard at least via hall. Yeah, one year apart, I'm happy with that. When you're without mega

1413
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:09,440
resources overworked in house artists and stuff. Yeah, no, I'm everything's getting done. Everyone's

1414
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,160
getting a timeline, getting more than enough time. June second, got it, right, you're done.

1415
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,800
You're done. Sorry, I'm itching my head. My head sits in funny. Are there different body types

1416
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:31,520
like gen one? Yes, there are. Will you stop streaming after gen three? I honestly cannot answer.

1417
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,640
I don't know what the future holds. And we are going to do a clipping program kind of like idle

1418
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:42,400
and there's a new agency that came out in that came out with it. I'm hoping to get it set up in

1419
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:48,320
September, possibly. So if you have a clipping YouTube channel, keep keep us in mind, we'll pay

1420
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:57,200
you for clips. I just need to set it up first. And I, I need to, you know, sort out the freaking

1421
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,560
website and all that and write it all up so I can get passed on to the team.

1422
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,440
Don't number strong these days. She's here to stay forever. She'll leave us. Relax,

1423
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:14,720
if not, it's only been a month. And a little more effort this time since the sixth literally.

1424
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,680
You need to give me it. You're all reeflings. Okay. Hope it's a long time before you stop streaming.

1425
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,840
Keyfabe is real and I'm addicted. Keyfab. Oh, I think I said it wrong. Keyfabe,

1426
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:31,280
Keyfab. Keyfab? Keyfab you looosa. I already missed her. It's like she's still streaming for it.

1427
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:38,080
Right. Right. You're done. Stop. Right. I don't want to die. I can't die yet. So I'm not pressing it.

1428
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,240
I ain't got time to die yet. There's too much on the line. You go on a massive adventure,

1429
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:50,880
but all fights are rap battles. I cannot rap a battle for anything. What does that even mean?

1430
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,040
All fights? Why am I getting into fights? Can I not just be left alone?

1431
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:05,440
That's bizarre. Oh yeah, you stink. You look like you don't ink. For real, you need to go see a shrink

1432
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:12,800
and then close your eyes or I'ma make you blink with my fists of fury. Yeah, got them. Got them.

1433
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:18,160
Friday Night Funkin. These are my rap battles. Honestly, that's awful. As long as it's not a

1434
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:26,880
rap battle to the death. End boss. M&M. Oh, fire. 100%. Big rap battles of history. She's spitting,

1435
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:36,800
though. World wars and rap battles. I guess I'll learn to rap. What happens if I lose? I mean,

1436
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,280
you get to go on a massive adventure. Sure. I assume that, oh sorry, I assume that means like

1437
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,080
holidays and stuff like that. I don't think I'm going to be fighting anyone. Let's go on holidays,

1438
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:51,680
reflings. We should go on a cruise. Did you know? Oh my god, this is terrible. Did you know there's

1439
01:26:51,680 --> 01:27:00,640
a thing called ink cruises? We're like people that like to go on swings. There's cruises for

1440
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:06,640
that specific genre of people, reflings. We should rent one of those and go on it. We just rent one

1441
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:12,960
out for ourselves. Ink cruises? I'm not kidding. There's a thing called ink cruises because it

1442
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,800
popped up on my TikTok. It was this check and she had a pineapple and she was like,

1443
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,360
do you like my room? I decorated it in pineapples. And then I learned what pineapples meant.

1444
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:30,080
Pineapples are a symbol for adults who like to swing on a swing set in the back garden.

1445
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:36,800
You'd be so damn tired. I think, I don't know, I feel like I would like somehow

1446
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,640
absorb your ink and it would like fill me with nutrients. I mean think of the vitamins.

1447
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:48,720
Rich people added again, strunniless ink on a boat together. I love pineapples. Tasty.

1448
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,840
Did they offer a group discount? Oh, they're swinging all right. Just brain wash the captain

1449
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,720
and steal the cruise. I have no idea if we're talking about literal swings. No, there's a

1450
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:05,520
terminology but I can't quite spell it out because all my streams have been limited ads recently

1451
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,520
and I'm trying to be on my my best behavior. Somehow pineapple pizza isn't appealing to me

1452
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:21,200
anymore. How dare you? Okay. Wait, are we, we've already, I've seen this one before. We've been

1453
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:30,160
here before. What? No, we've already seen you. Okay, next one. You gain the powers of your favorite

1454
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:35,680
superhero. Oh, I don't even know who mine is. The hero's entire rogue's gallery will hunt you down

1455
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:45,200
until they're defeated. I mean, just pick a hero that doesn't die. I mean, does Deadpool count?

1456
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:51,680
Deadpool can't die. Oh, wait, no, wait, that's eternal. I don't think that's good. Just defeat

1457
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:58,000
them five heads, literally. Oh, brother, this website stinks. Deja vu, I've been in this place

1458
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:05,840
before. Hire on the streets and I'm out of my time to go. The button just says you are your

1459
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:13,440
favorite hero. Yeah, literally because um, Deadpool has, sorry for being late. I don't

1460
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,520
worry. How are you doing? We're doing good. We're getting a few interesting questions,

1461
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,960
but it's going good. You can't pick and choose. You have to take your favorite. I don't know who

1462
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:28,000
my favorite is. I like Wolverine. I have to admit, I'm a bit biased with Wolverine.

1463
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:36,800
I think, you know what, I wouldn't mind being Wolverine. I like his wee claws. I like that I

1464
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,280
could be a wee wolf on the inside somehow. Nah, fuck it, I'll be Wolverine. Go for it.

1465
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:51,360
You become the physical embodiment of death. You can hurt anyone you want with no consequences.

1466
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:56,720
Everything and anything you touch will perish. Okay, no, because how are we supposed to ink?

1467
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:01,920
That's not possible. No, I'm skipping. Why would you, why would you want to perish without

1468
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:09,040
consequences unless I did it for the high table? But I would want to be able to like hug you and

1469
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:15,360
hold you. How am I supposed to do the convention under these conditions? I can't thrive. I can't

1470
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:20,800
thrive. Yeah, literally everything you touch perishes. That's such a harsh one. I don't like that.

1471
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:27,760
Pogs, Johnny, press the button and give me a high five. No, reeflings! You're supposed to enjoy

1472
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:35,680
life and thrive and stuff. Stop it. You become death. You are magically clean every time you...

1473
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:41,520
Oh, you know what? I have something funny to say. I've taken showers in a row and it's all because

1474
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:50,720
my dad's here. I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Yippee! Well, we enjoy Johnny. Oh wait, what's the

1475
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:56,640
name of that Elden Ring character you hug and she takes a part of your life? Johnny not pheromone

1476
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:03,920
max? Literally, I'm not pheromone maxing anymore. Since I started streaming, I probably went days

1477
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,160
without showering. This is the first time I've like triple showered, like every day in a row,

1478
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,960
like day day day. Unsubscribe, no! You are magically clean every time you wake up. Every

1479
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:20,240
bed you sleep on will be very uncomfortable. That's awful. Sorry, I need a comfy bed.

1480
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:27,440
Not to be dramatic, I need a comfy bed. Sorry, I'm so dramatic. Yeah, I'm glad that everyone

1481
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:34,640
freaking agrees on this one. Can't sleep on a net? Is maxing like that a thing? Oh, it's like I

1482
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:40,320
think it's made up. I hope it's made up anyway. Basically, you see, I'm pheromone maxing when

1483
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:47,760
you've not washed yourself in a while. I don't think it's real though. I hope people don't actually

1484
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:56,240
do that. Sleep in a chair? Oh, nothing bad will ever happen, but nothing good either. No, that

1485
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:06,960
means I don't get my reeflings. No, my reeflings are good. How do you? I got a reefling pregnant.

1486
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,760
You're having the baby. If I press the button, I may be able to fix that. I don't, yeah, I don't

1487
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,800
want you to be pregnant reefling. That's hilarious. I don't want you to be pregnant.

1488
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:24,480
So, your reefling is pregnant. I need to change it so it's you.

1489
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:32,160
I'm sorry I made you pregnant, but I'm yonking it, okay? Unless you want to burst Jen. Jen,

1490
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:37,280
you have burst a spin off, Jen. I'm pressing. Yeah, I'm probably pressing to

1491
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:43,920
strunnies against them. No, no, the fucking male pregnant emoji. What were they? I'm sorry,

1492
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,080
but what were they thinking unironically posting that? A male pregnant emoji? What?

1493
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:57,280
Man's not got ovaries. The fuck? I told you. Burthing Jen 1.5. I will shit it out. They weren't

1494
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:03,600
thinking. Oh, actually, it's the most bizarre thing. Like, all right, he's full from eating.

1495
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:11,680
Okay, okay, let's do it that way. It's not pregnant. He's full from eating. You can become a

1496
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:17,680
super powered god lake anytime you want. The source of your power is that life energy. Oh,

1497
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:22,400
I don't want to steal people's life. That's not nice. Sorry, that's a really easy one. I don't

1498
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:29,520
want to take people's life just so I can be strong. It can get me pregnant any day. This is so good.

1499
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:38,960
Oh, yeah, food, baby. It's just a succubus. Yeah, I don't really want to perish you. Like,

1500
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,760
if it was energy in terms of like, I can't hurt you, it's just you get really tired,

1501
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:48,400
but then you can recover. Sure, I'll do that until I won't become a succubus. Don't mind.

1502
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:54,800
You can pass me around one by one, refland. It's not a problem with me. You learn anything

1503
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:00,000
and everything that you possibly could all life, all life quit. Sorry, I'm having another like

1504
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:07,120
live fixes. All life questions are revealed to you. You cannot write. We keep getting some

1505
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:13,760
variations of this. Stop giving me variations of this. I've had enough. This is the third of

1506
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:23,440
these questions. Yeah, literally, you can undo enough. Give me something new. Are there you

1507
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:33,760
have incredible enough? Enough. You will meet the person of your dreams. You lose the ability to speak.

1508
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:41,280
I assume temporary. So if we did a convention, we can just use like a little a little chart. I can

1509
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:47,440
get pictures. And you like to you touch the picture and then and then when I go back on

1510
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,600
stream because you're not physically in front of me, I can talk.

1511
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,840
Would that be unacceptable? I met strong and can't speak. She can speak for me.

1512
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:05,760
You want to be aerial? It's perma. You meet the per, you meet you meet refling, but you lose the

1513
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:11,120
ability to speak. But it says meet only. It's not like you perma lose ability to speak.

1514
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:17,280
With the person know the deal. You meet them, but because you can't speak, they walk away from

1515
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:23,760
you refling. No, come back. Oh, how about how about if we're like 10 meters apart? There's

1516
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,480
like an AOE to this. Okay. If we're 10 meters apart, I'll like start shouting. I am a high

1517
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,200
refling, but you like walk in nine meter radius and then and then nothing comes out of my voice.

1518
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:39,840
How about that? It means like finding the love of your lay. What, TTS on your phone?

1519
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,360
Ah, so I can't speak after meeting strong. You're adding conditions. Okay, fine, fine.

1520
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,560
I'm skipping then. If I can't talk to you, it's not, it's not going to work.

1521
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,560
Because I need to be able to direct you in what position I want you in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1522
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:02,080
Everyone, everyone you have ever had a crush on falls in love with you, but they try to kill

1523
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:07,520
each other the moment they know that others in love with you. No, we're not having a brawl. Okay,

1524
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,920
we're not having a bar fight. All right, we're not having a bar fight. Strongie would make me

1525
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:18,400
splinter us any who she's getting. No, we're not having a bar fight. So we're skipping this bad boy.

1526
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:24,080
It's a free for all stop. It's not free for all. You will get your dream refling. She

1527
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,480
no, why are these so terrible? Oh my God.

1528
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,840
We're skipping that. That's terrible. A year with you. That's awful.

1529
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:44,320
Receive $100 million. Every one of your loved ones including yourself has a 1% higher chance

1530
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:50,080
of death each year. Oh no, I don't, I don't like odds. I do not play with odds. Nope. Easy skip.

1531
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,680
Half of these are just movie plot lines. Are they actually? So we wouldn't have to worry about

1532
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:02,400
being found while inking you since you can't make noise. Moncaise, moncaise. Gamba. No, I'm not

1533
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:09,200
Gamba on that. You don't felt true then. You can maintain your mental focus. You are not

1534
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:15,040
afflicted with ADHD. Okay, but you cannot maintain your optical focus. So you need really strong,

1535
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:19,600
heavy glasses. I already have to wear glasses.

1536
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:36,640
Remove ADHD. Wear glasses. Oh no. You've got me. It's just, what? Sure, I'll wear glasses. It's

1537
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,880
not a problem. Hey, we were in the minority?

1538
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,440
Like, I assume I don't need glasses outside of doing any tasks. So yeah, what? Do you know

1539
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:57,520
how much work I would get done if I could maintain focus? I love strong, heavy things

1540
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,360
upgrade from my current ones. Glasses bet it should exist. Should I get some art of me commissioned

1541
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:09,520
with my Glexon? Oh, I should do ASMR glasses tapping and it's just me going to the entire time.

1542
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,760
No, like really heavy ones. Well, heavy subjective because heavy for me is like anything.

1543
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,920
You can turn into any one animal that will. It happens whenever moonlight hits you.

1544
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:30,800
Sure, I'll turn into a werewolf and jump on you. I don't mind that. That's not a bother.

1545
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,320
It happens whenever moonlight hits you. Literally, I'd have to be outside on purpose and I don't

1546
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:44,320
go outside. So kind of just lie, can't throw me in a way. Yes, become the knot. Who's getting

1547
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:52,560
nod now, refling her? Because it's no me. Please make that an audio, please. I just might. I wish

1548
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,320
I would have to be a Twitter one.

1549
01:38:54,400 --> 01:39:05,120
Hmm. You will be the next Shakespeare. No, you cannot use auto correct. I'm already

1550
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:12,160
afflicted with this. So I guess if I wanted to make some like absolutely amazing scripts

1551
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:19,840
for the girls, yeah. And I'm already afflicted with non auto correct. So sure. Oh no, people

1552
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:29,760
know I spell phonetically. Oh no. How embarrassing. Oh, no, no one cares. Oh, you spell that thing

1553
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,560
wrong? Point and laugh. Relax. Life is not that serious. Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of

1554
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:45,760
water. Please hydrate, little we flings. Doth thou ink of the earth, refling, Earl Mouse?

1555
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:51,680
Are you arriving, refling? That's right, arrive for me. Get close. Arrive, arrive, arrive.

1556
01:39:54,480 --> 01:40:00,160
You'll live the exact same life, but you have one save and load from any point you can load

1557
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:05,360
after death. At some point during your life, you have to kill someone, pair the request of some

1558
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:16,000
unseen deity. Oh, I'm not sure I like that. But if you're working for a deity, I don't know,

1559
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:24,000
the deity seems like they're doing the right thing. I'm guessing I could do a save and load

1560
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:32,800
to do the deed. Just one. I feel like if a deity's sending you on a mission, they kind of know.

1561
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,680
Even if it isn't right, I'll accept. Strongly no, maybe press, I'm down. That's just warlock and

1562
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:45,920
D&D. This save scum, literally, I think I just saved scum it. Wait, no, if I have the save

1563
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:53,440
scum in order to get out of this, then there's no point. But you have one from any, but you

1564
01:40:53,440 --> 01:41:00,000
can load after death. So if I'll live the riskier life, I don't, I'm not risky though. I think this

1565
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:08,480
isn't... I'm the deity's top guy, blood for the blood god. Well, you'll have something to gain.

1566
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:13,200
Don't press, we don't know what that is. Yeah, I'm gonna skip that. If there's only one save

1567
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:21,520
scum given, there's no point, really. I'm not gonna do it. Sorry. Wow, minority. The minority,

1568
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,960
that was the right thing. The devil made me do that.

1569
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:38,560
Load before Bitcoin exploded. Honestly, take over the world with that. You'll be able to

1570
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:47,440
jerk your pentas for a day. If you do anything dirty, you'll stay there. Aww. What's the point?

1571
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:53,440
That's, that's literally the whole point of swapping teams.

1572
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,640
That is the whole point in swapping teams.

1573
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:11,280
No, I'm not, I'm, no, I can't unless you guys want me a fanboy for the rest of my life. But

1574
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:23,040
that's not happening. What? It's a perfect 50-50? I'm so surprised.

1575
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:34,880
I'll be fine with press and just to see the other side of the world. That 50-50 is crazy.

1576
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:43,040
Uh, I mean, easy, no hassle transition for those who want it. You get a lifetime supply of any type

1577
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:52,720
of food. You become, I don't like, why? Oh, you're, you're rate of debt. I mean, I think heart attacks

1578
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:58,720
are super painful as well. Like, nah, it's fine. I'm gonna skip. I don't even want to increase my

1579
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:04,480
random odds of a heart attack. Like, imagine midstream, I'm like, oh, my left arm. Oh, like,

1580
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:16,080
what? That's so, no. Okay, next, next, next, let's go. You become immortal no longer age. You spend

1581
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:24,160
the next 50 years. No, no, I don't want to become immortal. Stop it. Family history of heart attacks?

1582
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:31,200
Oh, no. Yeah, heart attacks suck. MonkaS, you had one? Oh, G-Stan, is that you?

1583
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,080
You need some chest compressions? I can give CPR. I can break your ribs for you.

1584
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:45,840
Left arm is usually a symptom. In women, the pain is across the back and chest and shoulder.

1585
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:53,040
That's ego death. I've heard women have different symptoms. Yes, a lot of things. That wasn't the

1586
01:43:53,040 --> 01:44:01,040
ribs. Oh, yeah, what did I break? Can I be a mortal that doesn't age? Chest or hips? I guess I'll

1587
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:07,600
have to break into a maximum security prison. Pop me out. You become immortal but no longer age.

1588
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:14,960
Nah, nah, nah. It's not for me. I want to be able, and I wouldn't mind living longer if I could be

1589
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:20,560
young, like the same age, and I can perish at any point. That's why I like vampires,

1590
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:28,160
because you can perish yourself if you really want. My pentas! You can control people with

1591
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:36,720
your thoughts. I can already do that. Hold on, hold on. Okay, you have three legs and five arms.

1592
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,440
I assume I can just get them chopped off.

1593
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:48,960
I think there is no way I have conditioned you already. I already have three legs.

1594
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:55,280
That is hilarious. Hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Let's pretend we're reading this for the

1595
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:02,160
first time. You can control people with your thoughts and you have three legs. I already have three legs.

1596
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:12,960
Oh, thank you. Thank you. I assume you can get an amputation. I look like, was it Godfrey,

1597
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:20,080
the grafted? Literally, you can control people with your thoughts, but you become

1598
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:29,680
Godfrey the grafted. Okay then. Can I amputate it off? I'm giving Mummy's third leg the glug glug!

1599
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:35,520
You say that with so much confidence. Always so clever making this joke. Sometimes it feels like

1600
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,000
you steal them because the timing is just so perfect. Nope, never, never, never stolen a joke

1601
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:47,520
in my life. Oh, it's Godfrey the grafted. You get to be in real life in my champ. I mean,

1602
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:53,760
I assume you can just amputate it off. I think it would be, what would I need to control people's

1603
01:45:53,760 --> 01:46:00,000
thoughts for? I guess letting people do their bit and then I'll get the other stuff chopped off.

1604
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:06,800
You know, technology is really a mess. You know what? Five arms would be so handy.

1605
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,760
So, honey, how many technicals do you have? You're already pressed.

1606
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,360
I can hear my dad singing if you can freaking hear him. Hold on, I don't know if he's on the phone.

1607
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,680
I'm just, I'm going to go out there and tell him to shut the fuck up. Oh, he's put the TV on now.

1608
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,560
I'm sorry if you can hear Star Trek in the background. He's watching Star Trek Enterprise.

1609
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:44,800
Okay. Anyway, yeah, definitely cannot do ASMR streams. Can't hear anything through the background

1610
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,040
music. I'm pressing the button. Okay, anyway, everyone will have big anime eyes. Give me anime

1611
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:55,760
eyes. I hear nothing. Okay. Yeah, we watched Star Trek Enterprise last night. Oh no, not Enterprise.

1612
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,840
The one with Leonard Nimoy Hoffman, the Spock, the original Spock, that one.

1613
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:08,240
I can never remember the name of the pilot and the fucking captain in that one for some reason.

1614
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:15,840
It never comes to mind. But he's live long and prosper. Captain Kirk. Yes, Captain Kirk. Oh my

1615
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,520
God, we were watching that last night. I don't know if you guys have seen it or not, but it was the

1616
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:26,000
one where there was like this lava monster that was in pain all the time and Spock touched it.

1617
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,920
And he was like, pain, pain. It's screaming an agony type thing in the heel up and, you know,

1618
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:36,640
lived happily ever after. And that's the one we watched last night together. Be me up, buddy.

1619
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:42,240
I'm already balding. You're allowed to be bald. Everyone will have anime eyes. You'll be bald.

1620
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:50,000
I mean, I don't see the benefit of everyone having anime eyes. That's weird. That's strange.

1621
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:58,560
You'll be bald. No, it's fine. But I don't think the world would be scary if everyone

1622
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:05,360
had anime eyes, honestly. Anime eyes aren't real. They're flat. Anime eyes in real life

1623
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:11,200
would be scary. Yeah. Other VTubers have that title. You would get stuff in your eyes so much

1624
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,600
with how big they are. I remember that. Doesn't it end with them working with the miners? Yes,

1625
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:26,720
it does. Whoa. Yes, that's exactly the episode. Yeah, they had to tell Dr. Scotty came and

1626
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:32,400
healed the thing and they had to hold back the miners from coming in. Wow, I can't believe

1627
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:37,520
you actually hear that. You get to physically enter a book for 30 minutes. The book is hungry.

1628
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:43,280
No, it's literally life or death. Stop. You get to enter a book that is going to kill you. No.

1629
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:51,120
Yeah, I was worried because they found it's like, yes, that was it. Not Scotty.

1630
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,880
Heart eyes in real life would be fun, but Stronny needs hair to pull.

1631
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:04,800
Refling. A refling. That's terrible. I would never press that one. You have unlimited

1632
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:14,720
writ. Everyone makes Among Us jokes. Everyone, this is, everyone makes Among Us jokes anyway.

1633
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:21,920
And stop staring at me with them big eyes. Imagine Stronny doing Among Us jokes all

1634
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:29,920
the time. Something that you already have, Riz. Fine, I ain't pressing the button if I've already

1635
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:41,280
got Riz. Call me a cracker because I've got Riz. Oh, come on. I did that one off the top

1636
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:47,840
of my head for once. I didn't even steal it. Come on. I'm not pressing the button.

1637
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:55,920
I don't get it. There's like a cracker called Ritz Cracker. There's a Rizzler Among Us

1638
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:01,600
first time catching you live and the first thing you come into a pun is the very first thing.

1639
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:06,400
A for effort. Thank you. I did try my best. Sheeks too big for the toilet is all the Rizz you need.

1640
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:12,240
Is that because I told you guys I have to stand up to wipe my ass sometimes?

1641
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,200
I like my cheek. I need to part my cheeks like the fucking Red Sea, honestly.

1642
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:29,200
I don't know if you guys have to do it, but yeah. That was burned into my brain, maybe. Yep. Sorry.

1643
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:35,440
Okay, your current best friend is saved from their terrible fate, but your true best friend,

1644
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:45,280
you haven't met him yet, will never meet you. What? You save sin sister from a terrible fate,

1645
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,400
but refling will never meet you.

1646
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:57,520
Oh, I don't like that one. I think I'm skipping that one. I don't like that one. It's flattering.

1647
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:07,440
I saw you just said best friend. Best friend? Best of friend. How do you even know if they even have a

1648
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:15,200
terrible fate since sister can suffer? You can't say that about sin. I met her mom.

1649
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:23,280
Shocking behavior. Shocking. Don't say that about sin. She's mine.

1650
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:37,920
Jokes. It was not that bad. Tiny Spidey. Thank you for the tip. It was not that bad.

1651
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:45,920
Call me a cracker because I've got wrists. Come on. That one's not that bad. So red.

1652
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:53,440
You have unlimited oil that you can sell or use. Pirates and thieves want you and your family dead.

1653
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:00,080
No. Stop. You're such a rubbish one. Press the button and she won't suffer.

1654
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:06,240
Oh, you know sin. I've watched her some. She's cute. Yeah, sin sister.

1655
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:14,080
My, her supermarket. She streamed and she's actually really good at Elden Ring. We're

1656
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,280
going to play Elden Ring together at one point. We're going to do a seamless co-op and we have

1657
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,840
short callers. I know. I don't know why we, look, we came up with the idea and we're going for it.

1658
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:27,440
Okay. It's happening in July. I think. Oh, probably August actually. Sorry, sin, if you're working.

1659
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:38,320
Oh, my tummy's getting sore. I don't know why. I was like, because I haven't eaten. I've got a sore tongue.

1660
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:48,240
You can eat your favorite food anytime you want. You can never eat anything else again.

1661
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:54,720
I mean, it depends how you want to categorize this because you could be like, oh,

1662
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:01,440
peshia, you know? Go eat. I'll eat shortly. I'll eat shortly. Kiss Tommy better. I think it's hunger.

1663
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,120
I'm rubbish at telling like, if I've got an upset stomach or if it's hunger pains,

1664
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:12,320
I can hardly ever tell the difference, I swear. So only ink for strongy. I need,

1665
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:17,520
you guys would need to step up. If I, if I hit this button, you guys need to step up and give

1666
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:26,560
me a good supply. Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear? I need a big supply. Big supply.

1667
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:33,200
I volunteer. Okay, good. I'm clicking it. We've, we've done it now. We're in the minority,

1668
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:42,000
but we've done it now. Okay, you'll be able to speak any language you want fluently as a native

1669
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,120
speaker would. You can only ask questions in whatever language you choose. I mean,

1670
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,680
that's better than nothing. You can still do stuff in the language. That's not really a problem.

1671
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:58,960
Let me be clear. Let me be transparent. Yes, ma'am, I'll set it up for you. Thank you. I feel like

1672
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:03,520
you could get around this by saying sentences, but ending it with a question. So being like,

1673
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:08,560
how are you? Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. You can be a journalist.

1674
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:23,680
What's that accent? Scottish. Yes. Wow. Normally I get, I get called Irish first.

1675
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:30,400
Whenever someone hears that, they're always like Irish. I'm like, no, Scottish.

1676
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:38,640
It's a good guess. Just say in it at the end of, in it, in it, brav. Being in a relationship

1677
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:43,200
would be horrible and would make your girlfriend wait. What's this? Is that, you know every language

1678
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,840
in the world, if anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to, and everyone in

1679
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,360
the world knows you have this ability and are constantly asking you to translate things.

1680
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:57,840
So was this made, this is a question made before Google translate occurs or after?

1681
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:07,120
If anyone asks you to translate something for them, you have to. I feel that your entire life

1682
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:12,960
would be caught up by people trying to get a bit of, yeah, no, I'm skipping that. So my job

1683
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:18,720
as a translator, skip, I'm not a translator. Yeah, like, I want to, your internet is never slow.

1684
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,640
You will never get a better computer ever.

1685
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,200
I'm in a looom.

1686
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,680
Pop, you are Google translate. You can never get a better computer. My computer is a bit of a beast,

1687
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:37,680
but it's going to be outdated in 10 years time, so there's no way. I mean, the internet's not bad

1688
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:50,560
anyway. Just play RuneScape 5H. Skip solo games. It didn't say anything about swapping

1689
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:54,000
for computer powers. Ah, you're trying to skirt the rules though. That's noody.

1690
01:55:55,120 --> 01:56:02,800
Okay, Canada becomes a global empire, but doughnuts are illegal. I am going to say something so

1691
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:12,080
controversial. I don't like doughnuts. I don't like them. I've tried to like them. I've tried to

1692
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:18,320
enjoy them. There is something about them that I don't like the taste of. I don't know why,

1693
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:25,680
because it's deep fried bread or slash cake, so why do I know unfollowed, blocked, unmembered?

1694
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:31,120
I don't know why. My taste buds just don't like doughnuts. I don't know. I like your doughnut.

1695
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:35,120
Okay, thank you. That was really quick. Okay, that was really quick.

1696
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:43,760
But jelly filled doughnuts. I tried so hard to like custard filled doughnuts,

1697
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:48,000
like I used to force myself to eat them. You know why I could eat custard filled doughnuts?

1698
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,920
It's because I like custard. That's the only reason I could eat the damn things.

1699
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:59,040
Like I try so hard to like doughnuts. I just can't eat. Yeah, I can click that button. Maybe it's

1700
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:04,000
the oil used to fry them. I've just never had a good doughnut. I don't know. Maybe if we end up

1701
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:13,120
meeting up in America, we can go to Dunkin' Donuts. Yeah, not Canada. Oh, come on, Canada.

1702
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:19,600
We can like a Canada be a powerhouse, can't we? You can bake them. You have to deep fry

1703
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:24,240
the doughnuts to make them. That's why they're kind of like got that on the outside.

1704
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:30,800
You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you teleport, you must walk down a long hallway

1705
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,200
full of creepy clowns that grop you.

1706
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:42,480
I mean, if it's just the hallway, the average hallway is like, what, three meters?

1707
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:49,120
Yeah, it's unnerving, but I mean, I can come to your house and, you know,

1708
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:57,280
barely disguise fetish strikes again. Yeah, it is giving a wee bit of that. Press the button.

1709
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:05,440
Push the button and let me know. What is that? Is that sugar? Sugar babes? That British band?

1710
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:09,040
Push the button and let me know. You've got to.

1711
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,160
What is that? It's a long hallway. Okay, I guess longer than average, then.

1712
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:23,920
Just have Reefling's dresses clowns. No, Krispy Kreme is better. That clown? Yeah, sugar babes. Oh

1713
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:29,200
my god, I knew it. I knew it. Push the button and let me know. You've got to.

1714
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,440
You can teleport anywhere in the world. Every time you tell.

1715
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:42,240
Wait, idiot. Idiot, sorry. I thought I was on the next one. Sorry.

1716
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:49,600
You live in a world of your favorite video game or movie. Lord of the Wings. We can have Hobbiton.

1717
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,040
You are ambushed every year where little chances survive.

1718
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:00,240
What's the point of giving me if I'm perishing? The odds are against me. Sorry, but I'm a rubbish Hobbit.

1719
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:09,120
I'm a rubbish halfling. You can make money with the snap of your fingers. Isn't that just

1720
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:13,760
spindome? Yeah, that's right. Give me another five bucks. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, give me five bucks.

1721
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:23,600
Snap, snap, snap. But the money you make up here is taken from Charity. Oh.

1722
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,000
Is this where we go in a tinfoil rant about how a lot of Charities are set up?

1723
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:36,640
Because I'll get into it. I don't think I'm not educated enough about how much

1724
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,600
little Charities actually go towards their fucking thing.

1725
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:46,480
So the odds are we can use this money for better. Okay. So we're going to hit the button

1726
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:52,480
because we can use it for a heck of a lot better as you win. No, that's not fair, bro.

1727
01:59:53,600 --> 02:00:00,800
That's not a fendom. Broly legend. No, we do not participate in fendom around these parts.

1728
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,960
Are you squiddin' me around?

1729
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,520
Ched!

1730
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,080
The best I can do is $2 take it or leave it.

1731
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,400
No, we're not fricking done enough.

1732
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:18,720
Enough. Thank you, Ched and Broly Legends. Kindly. No fendom, only fendom.

1733
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:25,200
Okay, you're the smartest person. Oh, I don't want to be smart. The smarter you are,

1734
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,880
the more depressed you are about how life works. It is not for me.

1735
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:34,800
Absolutely not for me. I do not want to be smart. I do not want to be aware of anything.

1736
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:40,400
I would rather live in ignorance for the most part. Everyone else is incredibly stupid. No,

1737
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:46,000
I will, I'm skipping. I am not wanting to be smart. The mental burden of all of that.

1738
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,920
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1739
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:49,520
Brian?

1740
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:50,800
Took these from Charity.

1741
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:55,520
No, Alessandro, stop it. We did not take anything from Charity.

1742
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,080
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1743
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:58,560
Brian?

1744
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,960
You're welcome, Mama. Love you.

1745
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,160
Probably Legends. Love you to the little meeting.

1746
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:10,000
Thank you again for the tip. You can discover the meaning of life. There isn't one. You give

1747
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,520
life your own purpose. You may never communicate. No! Bro, I can answer this in literally five

1748
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,600
seconds flat. It's what you make it. You're so lucky to even have a conscious being at this point.

1749
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,200
I can enjoy life for what it's worth.

1750
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:24,640
Oops. I tripped. I swear.

1751
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:28,560
Reluctantly sane. Thank you for the tip. Now stop it.

1752
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:36,080
We're not doing syndrome in here. The meaning of life is for you to literally plenty of fish.

1753
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,400
I've not even seen that movie yet.

1754
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:46,880
Anon! There's not even a message. How does this happen? Right. How do I

1755
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:49,440
unironically get you guys to stop when you start?

1756
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:55,680
Because I am a goods and service exchange kind of person. You can't just keep throwing money

1757
02:01:55,680 --> 02:02:01,440
at me. It makes me uncomfortable. I'd rather be like an exchange of something. Thank you for the

1758
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:10,160
tip, Anon. My goodness. I can't. The meaning of life is inking. Literally, you're not supposed to

1759
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:17,920
have your name in a memorial statue and be nice. That's it. The small everyday deeds

1760
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:23,120
keep the evil at bay. That's it. That's all you gotta do. There's nothing to it. You don't have

1761
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:26,880
to do anything. You don't have to achieve anything. You don't have to become anything.

1762
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,360
You are just you and you do your thing. That is what it's all about, okay?

1763
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:38,640
Pokemon is in real life, including all logic, technology, and Pokemon. All animals in real

1764
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:44,480
life. No, I don't like that. Are you squinting me right now? Scott Thunder. This is just to show love.

1765
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:50,800
Nothing else. You better not be inking right now at the thought of freaking Findo. Thank you for

1766
02:02:50,800 --> 02:03:00,800
the super chat, Scott Thunder. You can replace cats with cat Pokemon. No! Gimli and Beagle.

1767
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:05,840
I'm not getting rid of my puddles. I don't care how much you want to

1768
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:13,360
they pour you on. I'm not getting rid of Gimli and Beagle. You took his super chair. Give me that

1769
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:21,680
super chair. What would you do if someone gave you a 10k super chat? One, I'd be mad because

1770
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:29,200
you're splitting it to YouTube. Two, I would probably confirm that Gen 2 is in production.

1771
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:36,960
A guard of hour moment. Also, you would have to eat them. No, I don't want to eat them.

1772
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:43,200
I'm catching a little bunny. I love little bunny. She's so sexy for no reason. Oh no,

1773
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:47,200
this reminds me if she'd be smash her past Pokemon stream. How bad was that out of 10? Are you

1774
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:53,920
squinting me right now? Ms. Tomaki. I heard this is where I give away money. No, anonymous.

1775
02:03:54,400 --> 02:04:01,920
Anonymous. Thank you for the tip. That's very kind of you. Don't start spanking money. Anonymous.

1776
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:12,320
Edit again with the white bands. She doesn't know about the little bunny meme. No, she was drawn

1777
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:18,560
as little bunny. I'd have to eat the Pokemon. That's just Powell world. I actually wanted to give

1778
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:23,680
Powell world a shot. Milk tank though. I caught a little bunny Batman. Stream elements gives the

1779
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:30,320
girls a much bigger cut than super chats. These are facts. Are you squinting me right now? Oh,

1780
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:35,360
you don't like my notification sign? What do you prefer? I'm Scottish. And then bagpipes. Is that

1781
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,920
what you want? No, you don't want that. Are you squinting me right now because I'm a cephalopod?

1782
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,040
There's no laws against it Batman. We could play Powell world. Is Powell world multiplayer?

1783
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:54,800
Can I play with you? Is Powell world multiplayer? And you guys can come in?

1784
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:59,680
Is it like a code?

1785
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:11,600
Oh my god, I did not know. Will we play in Powell world? I did not know it was like that. Oh my

1786
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:20,640
god. I'm so in love. I finally got the words I want to say like, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1787
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:25,520
complete Powell world with me. Yeah, you just need a server. Okay, a Powell world server can do

1788
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:34,160
60 reef flings. Okay, that's good. That's a law. You're jerking your pentas in Powell world.

1789
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:40,480
Think of it kind of like arc. I have absolutely horrific news to you. I'm so sorry.

1790
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:46,480
Wait, so actually I've never played Powell world, but it blew up and everyone was like,

1791
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:52,320
oh my god, they're going to get sued by Pokemon. You can catch us reeflings and put us to work.

1792
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,880
Stony's going to have her icy moment in Powell world. Oh yeah, you're going to run a train on me?

1793
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:03,120
Gentoo confirmed via Powell world. You can do what you want without consequences,

1794
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:07,040
but you'll pop your cogs in five years not need more time to cook. I need more time to cook. I've

1795
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:11,920
got too many meme videos I want to make. You will rule the world, but you have to kill. Oh, no.

1796
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:19,840
I don't think so. You invented human computer communications, allowing to learn any skill or

1797
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,960
knowledge in an instant, but your invention leaks to the public allowing human computer viruses to

1798
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:31,920
kill as often as no. You're so violent. Are you squiddling me right now? Gentoo confirmed.

1799
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:40,080
What a random amount. What are you giving me? Why that number? Thank you. Oh my god. He's

1800
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:52,160
spelled it anonymous. Anonymous? Why 2345? That's so specific. 2345. Wait, what does it mean?

1801
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:57,920
Is that a code? Do I need to look it up on the website? A little cheeky code.

1802
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:03,520
Why that number though? Does it have a significant meaning or am I being dumb?

1803
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,280
Here's a good thing, but you're just going to die. I think it's just ascending. No, it's just

1804
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:16,960
the sequential numbers. You didn't hear that. I love the fact that Nintendo got so many emails

1805
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,760
in regards to Powell world. They essentially had to release a statement. I was like, yes,

1806
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:25,680
we know about it. Stop messaging us. Nah, just numbers. Someone sent 177013 would be funny.

1807
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:30,560
Isn't that the one about the poor girl that gets corrupted? My sin, the numbers.

1808
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:37,520
Because it's more money than 1234. Okay, you're done. Right, I'm not pressing the button.

1809
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:45,360
You become an immortal demon and rule over the known universe. The only weapon that can

1810
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:49,120
perish you is in the hands of a guy who's pissed at you for that.

1811
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,600
I mean, no.

1812
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:02,560
No. Okay, what time is it? Oh, it's been two hours.

1813
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:09,280
Okay, I think that's all I've got time for. Is that understandable? Have a good day?

1814
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:15,760
Or am I going to get in trouble? Am I going to get spanking from you as if I go off too early?

1815
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,360
Am I getting the spanking if I go off too early?

1816
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:29,840
I feel bad that it's so short. I'm trying. Oh, I'm going to get spanking. Don't try me with

1817
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:30,800
a good time refill.

1818
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,520
Now you can go eat and spend time with your dad. Okay. I mean, the spanking will commence.

1819
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:51,280
My dog collar is here. The short collar, not the dog part. It just happens to be a dog collar.

1820
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:54,800
But I arrived, so I hope you're ready for the shockin' in.

1821
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,000
We'll never stop. We love you. So take my money like a good girl.

1822
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:06,000
I know that was. Thank you for the tip. Goddamn. I'm getting praised out here.

1823
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,880
Shocking. Shocking.

1824
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,360
Um, okay, what we're doing?

1825
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:24,640
Okay. I don't think there's any Vela member online, which is a bit of a shame.

1826
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,120
But we'll work on it. We'll work on it. Okay. Let me just,

1827
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:38,160
let me just figure out what I'm trying to do. Okay, who's on? Rhea's on. What is she playing?

1828
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:45,600
Let trip my bosses in heat. What are you playing? I have no idea what she's playing,

1829
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:53,840
but you're, you're meant to be. Yeah. Thank you anonymous for the tip. I'll say my dad said,

1830
02:09:53,840 --> 02:10:01,280
hi anonymous. Have fun with your fam. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna get him to,

1831
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:08,320
I think I'm gonna record his voice. Ooh. Ooh. I know. Um,

1832
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:25,360
anonymous. Anomalous. Anomalous. Anonymous. I'll miss you. Yes. Tomorrow, tomorrow is not ASMR.

1833
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:29,280
I'm gonna substitute that for something else because there's absolutely no way I can do ASMR.

1834
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:36,720
However, we're doing Watch Along, uh, Monty Python, uh, Life of Brian for membership strum.

1835
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,800
Are you squiddling me right now? I get it, but get ready for the spanking moment.

1836
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,640
I guess it's, but get ready for the spanking moment. I don't think I shouldn't thank you.

1837
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:49,360
Um, yes I can. Are you squiddling me right now?

1838
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:56,160
Wow, another, another. Go and send our daughter time. Tell him we said hi-ya-oo. Hi-ya-oo.

1839
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:03,520
Dad, the reeflings say hi-ya-oo. He may have heard that.

1840
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:13,360
Thank you reluctantly saying, right? I'm gonna end it. You're gonna get redirected through here.

1841
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:18,960
He's gonna be like, what the fuck was that? What do you want? It is, I can, okay, when you guys act

1842
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:23,840
up, I'm gonna start saying I'm gonna get my dad on you. I'm gonna get my dad on you. Okay,

1843
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:26,880
I will change tomorrow's stream. I don't know what it's gonna be, but there is a

1844
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,400
one membership stream this week, which is a Watch Along of, uh, Life of Brian.

1845
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,760
Um, okay, I love you little reeflings. Please look after yourself and please

1846
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,760
pucker your lips for what comes next.

1847
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:49,920
Right, I'll see you. Enjoy what on earth Rhea is playing. I have absolutely no idea what she's

1848
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,640
playing. I'll see you tomorrow, you goofy goobers, for something different. It's not ASMR, so no

1849
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:03,760
get excited, okay? Bye-bye. Enjoy Rhea. Bye-bye. I said you're a game? Oh, sorry. Sorry for redirecting,

1850
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:10,000
but there's no other way to remember on, okay? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
