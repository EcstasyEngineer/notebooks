03:28.400 --> 03:34.240
via youtube chat so you need to if you want to answer there's gonna be a few polls okay

03:34.640 --> 03:40.400
okay and then remember to sign your name at the top of the piece of paper reeflings you know who

03:40.400 --> 03:44.960

03:44.960 --> 03:54.240
months now for months i have been trying my gosh darn diddly horridest for you to remember to put

03:54.240 --> 04:00.160
your name at the top of the paper you're old enough reefling come on now it's the one thing i can't

04:00.240 --> 04:08.560
keep identifying your work via your handwriting reefling okay okay now i've completely lost the

04:08.560 --> 04:14.560
scene of where the next slide is hold on let me find it school is in there we go i've got it

04:14.560 --> 04:24.720
it's got it's called school is in okay now in america if you didn't know americans have to

chair shuffle dot mp3 that's because i'm standing up now please place your hand over your heart

04:37.600 --> 04:43.760
because i think that's what americans do instead of i pledge allegiance we're doing the reefling

04:43.760 --> 04:47.200
velour coulda conduct this is totally not why i asked her on twitter yesterday

04:47.280 --> 04:55.600

05:11.040 --> 05:19.920
into temptation amen beautiful right sit by down sit by down fantastic thank you thank you fantastic

05:19.920 --> 05:30.160
participation okay that was beautiful thank you for doing our national anthem right let's get into

05:30.160 --> 05:37.760
the education let me let me take a sipping tin of my tea topic one ovulation now a little reefling

05:37.760 --> 05:43.760
i'm gonna need you to point a little around for me so the first topic's ovulation and then we've

05:43.760 --> 05:49.680
got a little yeah that's how you know i'm a cool teacher okay that's how you know i'm a cool teacher

05:49.680 --> 05:57.920
because i've got little emojis and stuff in the in the the presentation okay so there are no silly

05:57.920 --> 06:05.920
answers reeflings just uneducated ones okay we are in the digital age of information so let us learn

06:05.920 --> 06:13.440
together all right i have the very first poll for you now don't be embarrassed if you get anything

06:13.440 --> 06:21.680
wrong that's not how any of this works it's not how any of it works okay let's do a poll you're

06:21.680 --> 06:32.960
just to guess okay start a poll now the question is how many days in a month is a woman fertile

06:32.960 --> 06:40.000
so how many how many days in a month can she get pregnant okay again there's no wrong questions

06:40.000 --> 06:47.760
just there's no wrong answers um just uneducated ones and it's not your fault if you're uneducated

06:47.760 --> 06:53.200
in anything the school system is not set up for the most successful if you're any sort of way

06:53.200 --> 07:00.720
so please feel free to use the chat how often sorry how often how many days in a month do you

07:00.720 --> 07:07.680
think a woman is fertile please again there is no wrong answers just uneducated ones okay

07:07.680 --> 07:14.480
just uneducated one do not be embarrassed if you get anything wrong who said oh we've got a question

07:14.480 --> 07:23.920
thank you for raising your hand are the three holes real um yes it is uh there's the p-hole the urea

07:24.720 --> 07:32.480
there is the um vaginal entrance hole and then there is the anus for release of stool yes that's

07:32.480 --> 07:38.640
a good question thank you thank you okay we're just getting some some of the results back some of

07:38.640 --> 07:45.360
the results back okay we're going to end the poll results thank you everyone for participating in

07:45.360 --> 07:55.600
that poll i am about to blow your mind little reeflings because c is actually not correct no a

07:55.600 --> 08:03.760
woman is not fertile uh as soon as as soon as a woman experiences um periods no she's not

08:03.760 --> 08:12.880
fertile at all moments but the next uh voted result b is seven days in a month she is fertile no

08:13.680 --> 08:25.040
reeflings no a woman technically at a maximum per month at 48 days has a chance to get pregnant

08:26.080 --> 08:34.640
now where do we even start with the reproductive system of a woman it is insanity no no please

08:34.640 --> 08:42.400
don't worry please do not worry at all i will be taking any brian not now i'm teaching i will

08:42.400 --> 08:48.000
respond to anything at the end of the uh the lecture thank you please do not blurt out in the middle

08:48.000 --> 08:52.240
of class about your uh deadlift bench press thank you thank you reeflings keep it to yourself

08:52.240 --> 09:01.120
also and reply after soon so technically during the monthly cycle of a woman okay there you know

09:01.680 --> 09:07.120
when when a woman goes oh i'm ovulating you know how she can tell a certain type of slain

09:07.120 --> 09:13.920
evacuates okay that's how a woman can tell she's ovulating she can only get pregnant

09:13.920 --> 09:21.120
now i've been i've been very generous to say two days because on a technicality yes but the actual

09:21.120 --> 09:28.400
egg that is ready to be fertilized before it falls too far from the fallopian tube down into the

09:28.960 --> 09:36.320
the womb area 20 you've pretty much got 24 hours so you know when people say it's really hard to

09:36.320 --> 09:42.160
conceive and they've been at it for ages because they're looking for the tiniest slither of a window

09:42.160 --> 09:48.320
okay and and there's a bit of a misconception that the first time you ever have coyotes that

09:48.320 --> 09:54.080
you cannot get pregnant this is a misconception please do not be embarrassed if you thought

09:54.080 --> 09:59.280
these things the reason i am bringing it up is because that's what people think and i want to

09:59.280 --> 10:04.720
discuss it and um you know give you so you can get pregnant the very first time uh you quote you

10:04.720 --> 10:13.280
have quite us um but um the reason why i'm giving you a two-day time frame to impregnate your uh

10:13.280 --> 10:22.640
consenting adult is because sperm can stay alive in the womb for over five days so in theory

10:23.600 --> 10:31.360
you could do the dance with someone okay and they are they're not in their fertile period

10:31.360 --> 10:37.120
so they cannot get pregnant but then the egg moves into position causing them the ability

10:37.120 --> 10:44.640
to get fertile from your few-day old sperm conception is an absolute miracle even happens

10:44.640 --> 10:52.960
in the first place it is a fantastically uh unique thing um so again so this is the tight

10:52.960 --> 10:58.880
clam syndrome one point to here and then this is where the cervix begins and the eggs come from

10:58.880 --> 11:06.080
this ovary and it gets grabbed and it goes down the fallopian tube and into the cervix and if

11:07.200 --> 11:12.240
if you're lucky so this is you many years ago however old you are this is you right now because

11:12.240 --> 11:17.920
you were the first one to reach the egg so the first person to reach the egg wins everyone else

11:17.920 --> 11:27.520
dies perishes and fire and no um and then there you go so this is where the tight clam entrance

11:27.520 --> 11:36.640
is and then there's a little um length chamber now in hand you don't actually access the inner

11:36.640 --> 11:42.000
cervix this would be incredibly painful you do not access this area but the sperm you

11:42.480 --> 11:49.360
access the area and they swim up and then they touch the egg and then it's you it's fantastic

11:49.360 --> 11:56.160
so yeah uh you've got 24 you're 24 hours to impregnate a woman monthly that is why when

11:56.160 --> 12:02.400
people say they have a one-night stand and then a baby is the result of that oh my god you're so

12:02.400 --> 12:12.640
unlucky that's really terrible but it was your choice not to wrap it so consequences of your

12:12.640 --> 12:22.880
actions you know how it is okay next topic dun dun dun dun dun dun dun seeds glorious seeds

12:24.160 --> 12:28.720
right i'm gonna drink my tea before it gets cold we're doing seeds take a look at the photo these

12:28.720 --> 12:34.240
are my real seed collections as you can see you have a lot of samples drying before i put them away

12:34.240 --> 12:42.080
in jars um oh we have a question thank you for raising your hand refilling is that a drawing

12:42.080 --> 12:48.480
of your specific one no mine is a lot different mine is tilted it is a lot skinny milinky skinnier

12:48.480 --> 12:55.040
and it really hurts so okay let me finish my tea you're not a teacher if you don't have a cup of

12:55.040 --> 13:01.760
tea so i mean myself i'm okay okay you're not a real teacher if you don't like slurp the absolute

13:01.760 --> 13:04.640
shit out of your tea are you ready for the slurpage are you ready

13:09.440 --> 13:13.760
yeah literally why is it teacher slurps so loudly like yeah damn i thought i slurped loudly but

13:13.760 --> 13:21.760
teachers are on some other level you can as long as you raise your hand uh you're feel feel free to

13:21.760 --> 13:28.720
interrupt and ask a question as long as you raise your hand okay tilted yes uh just like the fortnight

13:28.720 --> 13:34.080
tilted towers apparently my cervix is tilted so uh i'm extra good for doggie style let's go

13:36.640 --> 13:41.680
hmm how is it tilted i just spawned in like that it's like why is your left one bigger than your

13:41.680 --> 13:46.000
right one look i don't come at you and say stuff about your ball sack please do not come for my

13:46.000 --> 13:53.440
tilted cervix i'd appreciate that this is ridiculous honestly

13:56.080 --> 14:02.480
you're making me want a cup of tea again straight oh you got oh reefling got me an apple delicious

14:02.480 --> 14:06.720
thank you i will have that apple at break you're such a teacher's pet there you go good reefling

14:07.040 --> 14:16.160
okay our first uh our next question again remember do not be embarrassed

14:17.520 --> 14:22.000
uh oh shit i can only have four options thank you nissa did alpha bravo charlie

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
uh the question i would like to ask you and again don't be afraid to be wrong don't there's nothing

14:28.000 --> 14:32.960
wrong with being wrong you'll be shocked at how many things i'm wrong with and say it with full confidence

14:33.600 --> 14:43.120
disperse my question for you is how many ways can seeds disperse this is our next topic seed

14:43.120 --> 14:47.840
now it is unrelated to the previous topic but ovulation and impregnation uh i mean actual

14:47.840 --> 14:53.440
seeds that come from plants and stuff now please don't be afraid to tell me how many types of

14:53.440 --> 15:01.200
seed dispersal do you think there are well oh you need oh you've got a reason can we see your

15:01.680 --> 15:08.960
serve it no okay next good will you the fact that you're is a part of the test will note it down

15:08.960 --> 15:19.760
regardless that's hilarious i'll just give you more than the apple okay let's see what we say

15:19.760 --> 15:27.040
we're saying there are four types is what the majority is saying oh we should have played

15:27.040 --> 15:32.400
fucking cahoots you know that the cahoots have ip i will fucking make another stream like this

15:32.400 --> 15:45.760
of cahoots doesn't have ip showing um yeah okay end poludes so the reeflings collectively decided

15:45.760 --> 15:53.440
there's four types of seed dispersal that's curious okay can anyone please raise your hands

15:53.440 --> 16:01.200
but can anyone tell me any type of seed dispersal because there are five types of speed seed

16:01.200 --> 16:08.960
dispersal now if i've done this correctly i should actually have a certain there we go five types

16:08.960 --> 16:18.400
can anyone in the class name any type of seed dispersal um or any type of example of a seed

16:18.560 --> 16:24.080
dispersal please go on wow i missed a poll see that's what happens if you don't stay awake during

16:24.080 --> 16:28.880
my class young man you need to wake up it's first thing in the morning you're being forced to be

16:28.880 --> 16:38.800
educated um oh someone said explosion well done explosion is ballistics well done reefling

16:40.000 --> 16:46.080
someone said spores now spores is related to mushroom very good answer not quite correct

16:46.080 --> 16:53.280
but mushrooms aren't seeding seeding type of um thing so very good uh call out though don't worry

16:53.280 --> 17:00.640
wind wind dispersal fantastic we have ballistic and wind someone says air i guess wind air

17:00.640 --> 17:05.680
absolutely same someone says animal fantastic please remember to raise your hand if you are

17:05.680 --> 17:13.360
shouting out it's hard to hear you all at once please do raise your hand fantastic now i'm looking

17:13.360 --> 17:21.520
for two more we have animals ballistic and wind i'm looking for two more answers i'm trying to hear

17:21.520 --> 17:36.160
it oh i'm looking i'm looking uh put dispersal that goes under animal very good very good

17:36.960 --> 17:42.480
we have water dispersal fantastic that's four out of five there's one more type of dispersal

17:42.480 --> 17:49.600
we have yet to unlock we have animal water ballistic wind don't worry pollination from insects

17:49.600 --> 17:55.200
and animals now you're going you're going steps ahead you're going steps ahead so pollination is

17:55.200 --> 18:03.280
how the seed is created the ovum and stem from the flowers come together oh we have falling fruits

18:03.280 --> 18:09.920
well done we have discovered all five kinds of seed dispersal fantastic reeflings the delay is

18:09.920 --> 18:16.080
20 seconds is it are you being for real right now why the fuck is it the least 30 seconds hold on

18:17.360 --> 18:24.080
pause the role play is the dis is it 20 why is it 20 seconds are you serious setting

18:26.880 --> 18:31.120
hold on hold on can i change this live or is it not gonna let me do it live

18:32.160 --> 18:33.840
dinner karmia

18:34.160 --> 18:41.920
why is it not ultra oh my god i can't change it because we're in the middle of a freaking stream

18:41.920 --> 18:48.000
are you serious i can't change it midstream you're right we are on a 22nd delay why are we on a

18:48.000 --> 18:55.680
22nd delay it's never been a 22nd delay before oh for goodness sake okay well anyway fantastic work

18:55.680 --> 19:06.080
yes that is the five kinds of seed dispersal so gravity can be a type of a i think it's a sycamore

19:06.080 --> 19:10.880
plant is that twirly one that comes down i'm so sorry i apologize i i don't know why it's not

19:10.880 --> 19:25.440
on reactive wind example is a dandelion okay okay ballistic is an okra okra i probably

19:25.440 --> 19:33.040
saying it horrifically wrong but basically it shoots out and it goes like okay and then water

19:33.920 --> 19:38.560
is coconut did you know coconuts float and they were perfect for floating in the ocean

19:39.280 --> 19:43.120
and coconuts are very unique thing i could probably go into a big massive rant about the

19:43.120 --> 19:47.120
uniqueness of seeds and plants that's for another day and then an example of animals

19:47.120 --> 19:54.560
dispersing seeds is an apple you eat the apple you eat the seed and then it's fantastic everyone's

19:54.560 --> 20:00.080
having a good time thank you thank you and then this is my actual seed collection um i pick up seeds

20:00.080 --> 20:06.160
on a wild walk i just go on a walk i grab seeds i have i'm gonna confess here um i have gone into

20:06.160 --> 20:10.000
people's gardens just to grab seeds off of their plants and then run off their property again

20:11.280 --> 20:15.600
but like these ones for example are drying out you must have a dry seed sample before you put

20:15.600 --> 20:22.800
them away in these test tube thing uh little tube things or um you risk actually getting mold and

20:22.800 --> 20:28.560
stuff like you can see this these tiny little black specks those are the seeds that's how tiny

20:28.560 --> 20:35.440
they are in that sample but you can see the stain that the fruit um like the innards of the dispersal

20:35.440 --> 20:40.560
method was i was actually uh i really enjoy seed collection uh unfortunately it's winter so there's

20:40.560 --> 20:47.520
like nothing to collect right now um but that's safe this this seed band it look i don't only

20:47.520 --> 20:52.640
steal seeds from flowers okay i steal your seed as well well i'm at it relax i'm doing

20:52.640 --> 21:03.680
i'm molly tasking right back to school boom next topic region locked capitalism also known as

21:04.240 --> 21:11.680
feudalism now let's just take a yes have you again i'm a cool lecturer so here's the king of the land

21:11.680 --> 21:18.080
it goes it's free real estate and then it's michael from vsauce and then it goes or is it

21:18.080 --> 21:27.200
vsauce theme plays boom boom now feudalism occurred within the ninth ninth century ninth yes

21:27.200 --> 21:36.320
ninth century to the 15th century fantastic stuff it lasted a very long time so first

21:36.320 --> 21:43.840
reef links i would like you to imagine not having full access to the world map okay the reason

21:43.840 --> 21:51.440
for this is because the globe was the globe was unlockable however um the humanity did not put

21:51.440 --> 21:57.600
enough perk points into transportation yet to unlock globalism so we weren't at that stage we

21:57.600 --> 22:06.400
were region locked capitalism which is called feudalism okay um so feudalism is the dominant

22:06.400 --> 22:17.520
social system in medieval europe okay where the disgusting nasty disease ridden peasants us were

22:17.520 --> 22:26.480
forced into labor on farms right but in the exchange of this labor uh oh let me just read

22:26.480 --> 22:33.920
how the the how it's phrased online we're obligated we're obliged to live on the lord's land and give

22:33.920 --> 22:43.760
him homage labor and share of the produce notionally in exchange for military protection okay because

22:43.760 --> 22:48.400
people used to pillage and stuff back in them times right and nay one once shanked everyone was

22:48.400 --> 22:53.440
minding their own business nay one once shanks but you don't like the stories and nights nights

22:53.440 --> 23:00.000
are real okay nights are actually a thing that happened okay so if we look at our beloved pyramid

23:00.640 --> 23:07.280
um of region locked capitalism um we are the peasants and the serfs we are down here this is

23:07.280 --> 23:16.880
us down here we would be telling the soil in the fields producing all of the food um what did i walk

23:16.960 --> 23:26.880
into i'm becoming a teacher um so we made all the food in exchange that we could have basically

23:26.880 --> 23:35.120
have board and protection from being shanked okay okay um so there's craftsmen there was farmers

23:35.120 --> 23:40.640
and merchants now those were above us that's what we were trying to obtain to be it was not possible

23:40.640 --> 23:46.160
to spawn it it was so hard if you were a peasant and to spawn in and then to become a knight or a

23:46.160 --> 23:56.240
battle but with any form of shitty capitalism there's always a high table and the high table

23:56.240 --> 24:04.080
tier begins at the nobles and the monarchs and then the pope and the church they are all high tier

24:04.080 --> 24:13.040
table and above do not be mistaken okay you ate your homework what do you mean you ate your homework

24:13.040 --> 24:22.160
i've not even given you your homework yet shish but yeah um this is a high table and above so nobles

24:22.160 --> 24:31.040
monarchs pope and church untouchable to us filthy disgusting leprosy infected no peasants okay okay

24:31.040 --> 24:37.360
the pope above the monarch what do you mean the church is above the state hmm oh we have uh

24:37.360 --> 24:41.760
thank you for putting your hand excuse me is first by it's first dream by the way is learning

24:41.760 --> 24:48.800
this okay for the channel or is this what monetization oh what oh no you can learn what you want

24:50.080 --> 24:53.120
i ain't here for the money i'm here for the education you're getting educated against your

24:53.360 --> 25:01.840
pop up okay so that is how it used to be you used to get shanked back in the day you'd be

25:01.840 --> 25:07.840
randomly getting stabbed minding your own business so in exchange for safety on someone's land

25:08.800 --> 25:13.200
you would do all the work reap hardly any benefit so this is a really shitty disgusting

25:13.200 --> 25:19.120
version of capitalism unfortunately capitalism kind of popped off today but i do want to note

25:20.000 --> 25:29.600
why did feudalism fail does any refling have any idea or inclination why feudalism failed

25:29.600 --> 25:37.120
and became old and became outdated that out no longer reflected the society that the world

25:37.680 --> 25:43.520
was in hmm can any remember there's no wrong answers it's okay if you actually don't know

25:43.520 --> 25:51.120
you are more than welcome to suggest a reason why you think feudalism uh was timed out in the 15th

25:51.120 --> 26:00.240
century um hmm i spelled capitalism wrong damn straight i did there must be always

26:02.640 --> 26:10.080
oh thank you we've got corruption and oh okay okay nobility industrial revolution very good

26:10.080 --> 26:18.160
french people i like it i like it because of fast travel we're getting there trade yet rise of

26:18.160 --> 26:23.200
trade the black plague that did really mess up europe that's a different i did not put that in this

26:23.200 --> 26:30.320
lecture because of the rise of the merchant class now what has been identified was the

26:30.320 --> 26:40.400
decline of knights and castles because knights were such a prolific enemy to your life they were

26:40.400 --> 26:46.880
such a danger to your life and kind of having knights to order around to execute willy nilly

26:46.880 --> 26:55.200
people left and right but because of the falling of castles of kingdoms of locations the decline

26:56.000 --> 27:04.080
people started to say hold on a minute i can go do all of this myself and reap a heck of a lot more

27:04.080 --> 27:12.080
than what you're willing to give me so uh it did fail so i have hope all i'm saying is that between

27:12.080 --> 27:15.920
the ninth and the fifth oh did i say the eighth it's the ninth century sorry between the ninth and

27:15.920 --> 27:22.080
the 15th century six hundred years give or take a new form i'm feeling sick can i go to the nurse

27:22.720 --> 27:26.080
okay you can go to the nurse take the whole pass okay but come back with it when you're finished

27:28.560 --> 27:35.120
okay next stage boom topic four since we were looking at a pyramid earlier okay

27:35.920 --> 27:43.920
since we're looking at a pyramid we're gonna move on to big boy maslow's hierarchy of needs let's

27:46.080 --> 27:50.080
okay as you can see i'm hiding up my emote that's behind me right now but we're looking at

27:50.080 --> 27:58.400
maslow's hierarchy of needs now have you ever felt kaka before okay have you ever felt like you do

27:58.400 --> 28:05.760
not belong are the brain worms just winning as these are the questions i have for you stop

28:07.200 --> 28:11.360
don't take your medicine just yet okay don't take your medicine just yet

28:11.360 --> 28:19.040
let's get to the bottom huh or the pyramid okay so you can reach the top

28:19.680 --> 28:26.560
uh uh uh so let us come up with a problem together and find the solution let's find the solution

28:26.560 --> 28:32.640
together to a problem a hypothetical problem so we're gonna take a little little dive into

28:32.640 --> 28:42.640
maslow's hierarchy of needs boom all right refling take it away problem strongy i can't

28:42.640 --> 28:51.520
ink anymore something's wrong and my lust is gone well we have found our problem worry not

28:51.520 --> 28:58.240
i will have you touching yourself in no time let's try out the pyramid method to this thing now don't

28:58.240 --> 29:05.600
throw up in my class go it's vomiting face now right go vomiting face thanks brine go i will

29:05.600 --> 29:12.160
read at the end okay so we have maslow's hierarchy of needs here okay we have psychological uh

29:12.160 --> 29:20.320
psychophysiological needs hey we got there in the end i'll take that we have safety needs

29:20.320 --> 29:26.400
belonging self-esteem and then self-actualization okay so if you cannot ink we're gonna take this

29:26.400 --> 29:34.400
problem physiological needs so this is your physical stuff you need your to achieve homeostasis

29:34.400 --> 29:40.320
homeostasis is when your body is maintaining yourself fine it feels good it's happy things

29:40.320 --> 29:47.680
are good okay so what aren't we achieving together what needs to change dany to tuck you into bed

29:47.680 --> 29:53.760
for rest have you rested that is my question for you do i need to feed you are you hungry okay it's

29:53.760 --> 30:01.600
first thing in the morning and you're uh getting educated against your will okay um what do you say

30:01.600 --> 30:05.440
but oh thank you for putting your hand up but mummy maslow's hierarchy needs have been showed to be

30:05.440 --> 30:10.720
overly simplistic and not no i don't want to hear it okay i don't want to hear i like maslow i really

30:10.720 --> 30:15.680
like maslow okay do i need to feed you could i could bring you a toothbrush if you didn't brush your

30:15.680 --> 30:21.600
teeth in bed i'm not gonna judge no no problem with me i just want your needs to be met because if

30:21.600 --> 30:29.440
your needs are met in big old maslow a big abraham maslow said if you have met all your homeostasis

30:29.440 --> 30:38.800
needs we get to move up a tier okay we get to move up to your safety needs security safety okay so

30:38.800 --> 30:45.360
security can come in a form of different ways okay so i have are you able to socialize well with who

30:45.360 --> 30:52.480
you like hold on i'm gonna have to move my big old head where's my moose oh sorry my cursors

30:52.480 --> 30:57.760
having a hold on let me move myself i'm in the way i'll sit on the i'll just camp down here okay

30:57.760 --> 31:04.240
sorry i'm i'm camping in chat um are you able to socialize well with who you like maybe can you

31:04.240 --> 31:09.040
give your family member a quick call even if you even if you have absolutely nothing new to say under

31:09.040 --> 31:13.840
the sun guess what neither did they they have nothing new under the sun to talk about either

31:13.840 --> 31:18.320
it's just a five minute phone call just because you don't have news refland doesn't mean they don't

31:18.320 --> 31:23.360
do you feel secure in what you're doing that could be related to your job that could be related to

31:23.360 --> 31:31.760
memeing around try and be kind to yourself okay because that is how we achieve uh safety needs

31:31.760 --> 31:37.200
okay security is related to socialization as well okay so don't be don't be too worried don't be too

31:37.200 --> 31:44.880
worried okay now there's one thing being secure in your social relationships and then if we have

31:44.880 --> 31:52.000
done that we get to unlock belonging and needs belongingness and love and needs okay intimate

31:52.000 --> 31:56.480
relationships friendships community okay this is where we're getting really this is where we're

31:56.480 --> 32:04.240
starting to be like we need this okay so i hope you feel as accepted as you can be here okay

32:04.240 --> 32:10.880
okay i am dumb i'm silly i don't understand what's going on in the world you guys have accepted me

32:10.880 --> 32:16.160
without a shadow of a doubt i could have easily been rejected you guys have accepted me i hope

32:16.160 --> 32:27.440
i extend the exact same environment back towards you okay um i don't expect you to be perfect

32:27.440 --> 32:33.680
just as you do not expect me to be perfect okay this is the kind of

32:35.600 --> 32:42.400
socialization that enables both the previous tier so the previous safety needs of security

32:42.400 --> 32:50.240
as well as the intimacy of being accepted as a person you don't have to hide that

32:50.240 --> 32:55.920
you're on the spectrum you don't have to mask you don't have to do anything you can put the most

32:55.920 --> 33:01.440
cringeyest message in the world out there and i will giggle and be like hee hee whatever you're on

33:01.440 --> 33:10.000
about that can you copy no you can't copy off someone okay so if you feel secure you have

33:10.000 --> 33:16.800
belongingness in a community you you feel loved you feel all this good stuff okay then you can

33:16.800 --> 33:22.960
move on to the next tier which is esteem needs prestige and feeling of accomplishment okay

33:23.120 --> 33:30.880
so this is this one is uh a bit more difficult to achieve because not everyone can do it hell even

33:30.880 --> 33:37.440
i'm not really getting there but we're working on it we're getting there do you feel like you are

33:37.440 --> 33:43.520
getting life xp at the moment that is what if you are not that's what's preventing you from being

33:43.520 --> 33:50.960
unable to ink that's it that's the answer um so do you feel like you're getting life xp xp

33:50.960 --> 33:57.440
how would we get you some even if it's super small amount of xp you could learn a new skill

33:57.440 --> 34:04.480
you could investigate a topic that you're interested in and gain new knowledge um working with others

34:04.480 --> 34:10.640
can thrust you into so much easy xp literally the minecraft xp on the floor if you go work in a

34:10.640 --> 34:18.480
coffee shop just picking up all that minecraft xp on the floor okay um working with others or

34:18.480 --> 34:23.360
putting yourself in a situation where you can enable others too to achieve what they need to do

34:23.360 --> 34:28.240
okay um this sounds really silly but you can how your mum does all the dishes

34:29.520 --> 34:36.240
unload the dishwasher once okay she'll be she'll be shocked and in a good way not in a bad way

34:36.240 --> 34:41.360
but just you have enabled your mum one less thing she has to think about in the household okay

34:41.360 --> 34:49.200
these are just the other thing okay and then um you can also enable you can be the secret hero

34:49.200 --> 34:53.280
that doesn't get acknowledged in the credits of the movie but deep down you know it was your

34:53.280 --> 34:59.680
refling that these things can give you life xp that is what gives you self-esteem well it says

34:59.680 --> 35:05.920
esteem needs they don't necessarily mean self-esteem but esteem is quite a big social you need to be

35:05.920 --> 35:10.640
confident in yourself to you know be able to put yourself out there get confident do things okay

35:12.320 --> 35:16.960
so oh i've got a question but if the problem is the fact that you have nothing more to get from

35:16.960 --> 35:23.600
one of your passions you just went so deep there's nothing left um so you have created then in that

35:23.600 --> 35:31.760
scenario um pathways or positivity you have ease of pathways in your head when it comes to nostalgia

35:31.760 --> 35:37.680
in that particular topic just means you have to find something new are you telling me little

35:37.680 --> 35:45.920
reefland in this whole wide world you can um think of one thing to get educated in okay now if you

35:45.920 --> 35:56.400
have a completed esteem needs self-actualization you can beat your shmeat right now if you're at

35:56.400 --> 36:05.440
this stage of self-actualization ink for me after this stream look at the comic that's on my alt account

36:06.400 --> 36:14.240
look at you taking over you can do whatever you want whatever you say i'll do and i'll take it

36:14.240 --> 36:24.080
off so just keep laughing there we go we have solved the problem that we came up with

36:24.720 --> 36:30.560
fantastic stuff so that's how mazla works you can use it um if you're ever facing any difficulties

36:30.640 --> 36:37.920
yourself okay can we do it right now no not during my class after class after class but that is an

36:37.920 --> 36:43.120
example of how you can tackle a problem you may or may not be having with mazl's hierarchy of needs

36:43.120 --> 36:47.760
okay so all these if you're at the bottom tier obviously you're blocked off from doing anything

36:49.040 --> 36:58.560
and we just do it like that okay right next boom bones who doesn't love them ladies and gentlemen

36:58.560 --> 37:08.240

45:17.760 --> 45:25.600

45:25.680 --> 45:32.960
clam slam how do i sign up to be a participant yeah do i ask after class no that did not happen

45:32.960 --> 45:39.600
unreal untrue also me who's releasing a freaking foot of teacher audio today after the stream this

45:39.600 --> 45:50.320
is so messed up and oh this topic i'm very passionate about okay how peter jackson made the clutch of

45:50.320 --> 45:58.560
the century and no one knows about it but now you are being knowing about it you are being

45:58.560 --> 46:05.600
knowledge okay you're being knowledge so this is the hobbit in particular this is the hobbit

46:06.320 --> 46:14.160
so big totoro uh toro was originally going to be the director but warner brothers refused to

46:14.160 --> 46:20.880
give a finalized budget causing insane planning issues okay so this was originally going to be

46:20.880 --> 46:27.280
the director but instead is peter jackson thank goodness but in his defense how on earth can you

46:27.280 --> 46:34.560
plan for a movie at the time it was going to be two movies um if you don't even know what you can

46:34.560 --> 46:42.960
afford so peter jackson stepped in what a legend okay from the stress alone of creating the hobbit

46:42.960 --> 46:47.520
i think it was like 299 days to shoot it that doesn't include pre-production and anything

46:47.520 --> 46:54.000
afterwards from stress alone he developed a stomach ulcer and then when he got healthy again

46:54.000 --> 47:01.360
he jumped straight back into why is this man not getting acknowledgement for having insanely hard

47:01.360 --> 47:08.000
working he is okay you thought that was gay but honestly i can see what you mean okay

47:08.960 --> 47:15.760
um he was diagnosed with a perforated ulcer um he lost a serious amount of weight like an unhealthy

47:15.760 --> 47:20.720
amount of weight if you have rapid weight loss that's actually not good for your body it shocks your

47:21.360 --> 47:27.280
homeostasis abilities okay so originally the hobbit was actually going to be two films but quickly

47:27.280 --> 47:34.000
into production um peter jackson and fran walsh realized that they were going to have to far out

47:34.000 --> 47:44.000
an entire third movie overnight they had lost so much sleep so much sleep over this it's insanity

47:44.000 --> 47:53.760
okay and it was the worst budget i will never forgive warner brothers i like such greedy bastards

47:53.760 --> 47:59.920
they had seen how much lord of the rings earned and they went right do the hobbit but here's a

47:59.920 --> 48:05.680
fraction of the fucking budget as if they didn't have the returns of lord of the rings sitting

48:06.480 --> 48:12.080
in their wee book um uh literally i was typing this last night and i started vibrating in my

48:12.080 --> 48:18.080
chair and like i was getting really aggressive with the keyboard and stuff i was raging okay so

48:18.080 --> 48:25.600
peter jackson spent years on the pre-production of lord of the rings okay for the hobbit he had four

48:25.600 --> 48:37.280
months four months pre-production for a trilogy is insane no wonder that poor man developed a

48:37.280 --> 48:43.360
freaking stomach also okay stress in the workplace is real it's it's absolutely horrific what he went

48:43.360 --> 48:50.880
through okay and i just want to say tariel might not be for you in the movie but she's for me and

48:50.880 --> 48:57.200
then i'm spanking you okay i will not take tariel slander don't upset me okay not all characters

48:57.200 --> 49:02.880
have to be lore friendly but i genuinely like her and i think the forbidden love thing is really cute

49:02.880 --> 49:09.280
okay and anyway let's make out before i start crying at the hobbit okay and then i said i would

49:09.280 --> 49:13.360
like to watch the hobbit on boxing day with you if that's okay and then on christmas we're gonna

49:13.360 --> 49:16.800
watch lord of the rings but because this was about the hobbit i didn't really mention lord of the

49:16.800 --> 49:25.360
rings that much but yeah okay let me let me get back into the correct side my lecturing side okay

49:26.320 --> 49:32.240

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:07.600

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.520

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.200
be followed to that i always have on low latency but uh i guess youtube doesn't like me today

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.560
this stream was actually really good you like it did your brain get new wrinkles my brain has

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.520
three more wrinkles i messed up the day that's okay i'm in the future so technically it's not that

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.160
bad we got skilled gonna frame my strong to some degree on the wall i feel somewhat more knowledgeable

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.640
stroney if you look up the medical journal topic of pregnancy it says the window of ovulation

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.520
why are you saying it's too so i'm saying it's too because the reason why it's so extended is

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.280
will you accept pictures of our notes and quiz in marshmallow yeah wait did you actually do it

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:20.560
the reason why i say is two days is because the actual amount of time the egg can be fertilized

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.960
is is such a tiny tiny window so you know when couples are like oh we've been trying to get

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.520
pregnant for ages it's because you literally need to plop plop plop plop plop every single day if

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:41.280
you're serious about wanting a wane okay like if you're actually wanting a baby then you need to

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:47.520
plop every single day like days straight um but you know if by the third month you've plopped

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.920
every single day and no child has been born um all right sorry no um egg has taken you know

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.040
probably one partner's got infertility it's really not a big deal i don't know people make a really

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:06.960
big deal about that but oh someone said the bit about tomatoes and the prostate was good stuff

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.680
you learned something new yes it's because of the antioxidants um it really helps like do something

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.640
to your balls and stuff no your prostate which is i don't know i'm sure okay can i test out with you

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.600
not yet gen two is not in the oven yet okay i'll tell you when gen two is in the oven

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.240
you seem to have a lot of research on getting pregnant i find it really fascinating um

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:37.040
i like i looked into IVF and all of that no for me i'm not birthing a child anytime soon i can

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:45.040
assure you that much these nips stay pink in this corner um but it's um infertility is a very

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.840
so i need to choose my words carefully because i don't want to offend anyone

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.360
um some people see that not having children is the be all end all of their life and it can

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:07.520
completely decimate any uh semblance of confidence of self-esteem of um ego now it's

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.480
actually good to have ego believe it or not and it is really fascinating stuff the psychology

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.160
that plays in being told that you're infertile or you can't spawn your own offspring uh some

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:28.960
people that me if i was told that i cannot bear children reeflings that ASMR boost is happening

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:40.720
i don't give a fuck no risk are you joking like i don't give a fuck um micro plastics have messed

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.880
up or reproductive i would not be surprised if that is why there's a lot of people facing um

the tip yes you can marshmallow it and then annom nom said hi strony i didn't know if you know you

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:58.640
can ask away for bandsley okay so i come to a terrible realization um so the girl i violor

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:07.040
are not taking a cut from bandsley um that was an oversight by me um because originally i said it

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:16.640
was going to be free access but i we violor do not dictate what if the girl streams on fansley or

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.760
not so they keep a hundred percent of the earnings so whatever price range is what they put on but

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.800
they earn a hundred percent we do not take any of a cut so i don't know what they're going to charge

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.440
i don't know what they're going to do it's on an individual basis i apologize but it's just how it's

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.440
going to be um it was a massive oversight for me to say that it was going to be free to view

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:44.560
because i don't like that's their stuff that's what they do the contract doesn't stipulate for the

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.400
girls to stream on uh bandsley or any kind of website like that so they get a hundred percent

01:09:50.400 --> 01:10:00.400
of their earnings um as always pretty much um so i do apologize um for my previous misinformation

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.840
i spoke before i actually thought about the situation but the girls are getting access on

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.560
august 1st i don't know what they're doing but as long as they have fun that's the main thing um

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:19.280
yes the girls have also come out with gamer subs um we are all getting sent pure packages so i don't

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:25.840
know if they're going to be a few handcam streams but i plan on doing a handcam stream um and gamer

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.120
subs were actually very kind and said that i'm allowed to say out loud that if um there's a

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:38.240
certain amount of sales number reached then vealer can potentially get a cup or a waifu

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:47.200
shaker baker maker producers um uh so yeah if you drink it in general or you ever wanted to try it

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.560
out please don't be afraid to use anyone's code at any point um hundred percent of the earnings

01:10:52.560 --> 01:11:00.400
go to them again vealer does not take a cut um it is a hundred percent to them um and yeah uh that

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:06.560
was like a really big news we were sitting on that news for a while um i can finally talk about it

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:15.680
and i'm so happy for the girls like they got the codes and um she be uh she was so happy um thank
