0	5040	You wanted a fero-kusou gaki, I gave you a ferrokusou dente.
5040	10300	You wanted a doten hag, I gave you a doten hag.
10300	15260	You wanted a dorky yandere, I gave you a dorky yandere!
15300	20340	You wanted a masochistic brocon, I gave you a masochistic drozon.
20340	23980	You wanted a mild dominatrix, I gave you a mild dominatrix.
23980	33980	And now I bring you the VTuber that no one asked for, a goddamn hypnotic cuttlefish.
33980	55980	Did I kick or did I f***ing kick, ladies and gentlemen?
55980	59980	I hope you enjoyed your evening so far.
59980	62980	Let me formally introduce myself.
62980	66980	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Strony Cuttle.
66980	69980	The surname is because I'm a cuttlefish.
69980	76980	And Strony because I am the daughter of the gamer Strontium, my dad's gamer tag.
76980	79980	And I wouldn't be here without him, you know, because he came from his b***h sack.
79980	81980	Anyway, age, age, ladies and gentlemen.
81980	87980	Oh, yet again, I have failed the VTuber challenge of tell us your age.
87980	91980	Cuttlefish normally live to a year, so time's ticking.
91980	97980	Anyway, my birthday is October 10th, which is actually National Sweden Cuttlefish Day.
97980	100980	They're both step-for-the-pod, so I don't mind sharing that birthday.
100980	108980	My height is 162 centimetres, which makes me 5'3", because I forgot to update this hi-ho over here now.
108980	111980	For my languages, turns out, if you're born in Scotland,
111980	115980	the British government recognises Scottish slang as its own language,
115980	118980	so in your face, I can speak two languages.
118980	121980	Grace, I am a cuttlefish, and I'm also good at the 100-metre sprint.
121980	123980	Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.
123980	126980	My likes and dislikes.
126980	130980	ASMR, if you like ASMR, you're going to get spoiled, rotten on my channel.
130980	133980	Or any of the VLOR girls' channels.
133980	135980	Shows your plasters.
135980	138980	Oh God, can you see it? Wait, you're not supposed to see that part!
138980	143980	I like seeing victory on my screen because I could use any tiddly wink of serotonin.
143980	146980	And I also like plasters and band-aids.
147980	149980	I wonder why.
149980	151980	For no nefarious reason.
151980	153980	For my dislikes.
153980	155980	I don't like bullies in video games.
155980	158980	Your teammates aren't all going to magically be MLG pros, so relax.
158980	161980	I don't like serious people, I don't like seriousness.
161980	163980	I think my gen mates can all pray for a bunch of bouts.
163980	165980	I can't be serious, it's terrible.
165980	168980	I'm the most unprofessional person they've probably ever worked with in their entire life.
168980	169980	My hi-ho.
169980	173980	And I don't like mongolian throat singing, I'm so sorry.
173980	177980	People seem to really like it, but I don't.
177980	178980	It doesn't sound nice.
178980	182980	Apologize to the one mongolian throat singer that's watching right now.
182980	184980	Huggy, I'm nice and generic.
184980	187980	Sorry, there's nothing interesting about my taste.
187980	188980	Movies, Lord of the Rings.
188980	189980	Definitely come.
189980	192980	Animes, nice and generic again.
192980	194980	Books, I actually started reading books this year.
194980	198980	I know this sounds crazy as a sentence because people read books in general.
198980	200980	Me, however, I started this year.
200980	206980	I really like dystopian books that talk about human nature and how humans are stinky poo poo heads.
206980	212980	For my music, Hatsunomiku and Atarashigako, I want to see them live if it's possible.
212980	215980	Oh, yeah, just a wee bit of a gamer.
215980	216980	It doesn't mean I'm good at games.
216980	218980	Now before there's that one person that's like,
218980	221980	eh, you've played all these games, that means you're an MLG pro.
221980	223980	No, relax, relax.
223980	225980	I've played games full stop.
225980	230980	Okay, these are the games that I remember playing or just kind of like have a good,
230980	232980	yeah, play them type thing, okay.
232980	236980	See who's been an Xbox gamer to apologize for my goals.
236980	240980	I want to get monetized on YouTube, so feel free to subscribe
240980	243980	because we have been called like crazy since then.
243980	249980	I want to stream so much that you can basically read everything in my voice.
249980	254980	You know, you'll be Scots yourself and you can apply for citizenship and all that good stuff.
254980	258980	I also want to create a Mega A Smart collab with my gen mates,
258980	260980	which I've already got quite a few on the way.
260980	262980	So don't worry, it's coming.
262980	263980	You just got to wait.
263980	267980	I have a childhood dream actually of 100,000 gamer score
267980	270980	and it's actually possible now with Xbox Game Pass.
270980	275980	I would absolutely love to explore a heken amount of childhood games
275980	278980	and I would love to play like your childhood games as well.
278980	280980	There's a little fun factoid about me.
280980	283980	I'm a wee bit of a workaholic.
283980	288980	So I would like to say that for every 1,000 subscribers I get on my YouTube channel,
288980	291980	I'm going to upload a celebratory.
291980	292980	Really hard to say that if you're Scottish.
292980	295980	ASMR video pair 1,000 subscribers.
295980	300980	I've already got like tons ready to go, so don't be shy.
300980	302980	You know what to do, wink, wink.
302980	305980	I also want to challenge myself.
305980	306980	I want to collab.
306980	310980	I want to make ASMR collabs with over 100 different v-tubers
310980	313980	and I'm actually so much of a workaholic.
313980	319980	I already have three confirmed with v-tubers outside of VLR, so I'm very serious about that.
319980	322980	If you ever have a 3DO, you're a v-tuber, I'm coming to find you in your DMs.
322980	325980	I would love if we could read Lord of the Rings together.
325980	327980	I think it would be so fun.
327980	331980	I'm not a very strong reader, but I think it would be really cute to do like a little
331980	335980	before the end of stream, read one chapter or something like that.
335980	339980	And last but certainly not least, I would love to get stream sniped.
339980	341980	I absolutely adore it.
341980	344980	I love playing multiplayer games where you can join me.
344980	347980	You can have an amazing time and have so much fun.
347980	349980	It's just one of my favorite things, okay?
349980	350980	So please do not be shy.
350980	351980	These are my goals.
351980	352980	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
352980	353980	I'm dumb.
353980	354980	Okay, I'm really dumb.
354980	356980	I don't know how to come up with tags.
356980	357980	I'm not funny.
357980	358980	I'm not good with puns.
358980	362980	So I am more than happy to take any suggestions.
362980	366980	My ushi marks are squid, but I'm a cuttlefish.
366980	370980	And then the second emoji kind of looks like a man bowing.
370980	371980	Hmm?
371980	372980	Hmm?
372980	376980	Maybe that is a hint to what I might try to make content-wise.
376980	380980	And for fan names, there is only going to be one option.
380980	381980	Come on.
381980	383980	Let's not beat around the bush.
383980	386980	You are my refling.
386980	388980	You will always be my refling.
388980	390980	And thank you so much for waiting.
390980	392980	I have bloody missed you.
392980	396980	Special shout out to Nari and Squishy Goal.
396980	400980	You may have noticed a bit of a trending pattern.
400980	406980	Squishy Goal that conceptualized us all and now I helped out and made us come to life,
406980	407980	which is beautiful, beautiful.
407980	412980	So thank you everyone who came together to make this fantastic gen of indulge.
412980	414980	Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
414980	419980	Most people get to do, oh, this is my gen mate's impression.
419980	420980	Me.
420980	421980	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
421980	424980	I picked my gen mates.
424980	425980	Do you understand?
425980	427980	I picked them, okay?
427980	429980	Now I'm going to tell you why I picked them.
429980	431980	Mercy's determination.
431980	434980	She was going to make it no matter what.
434980	438980	The definition of mercy in the dictionary, if you look up, it just says determined, okay?
438980	441980	There was no way in heck she was not going to get in.
441980	443980	That's all I'm going to say on that one.
443980	445980	Emi.
445980	452980	Emi said to someone who's being rude to her to keep themselves safe and Minecraft
452980	455980	and then she instantly got the part, okay?
455980	462980	I say, I say, oh, I say has fantastic experience and history and she's such a hard worker.
462980	465980	She had the most professional application.
465980	471980	Even though English is in her first language and now I got them, I say you're impressive.
471980	472980	Then Azura.
472980	476980	Okay, I describe Azura as my little diamond in the rough.
476980	479980	Now hear me out before you're like, it's not an insult, relax.
479980	481980	I'm not told the full story yet.
481980	488980	I was going to cross off Azura's stream as I was reviewing her because she wasn't talking.
488980	489980	She wasn't interacting.
489980	493980	And then she said three words in that voice.
493980	495980	Azura.
495980	497980	She instantly became Azura.
497980	500980	She said three words and she got the damn part.
500980	501980	Sheebie.
501980	502980	Sheebie is everything.
502980	504980	I should have been in another life, okay?
504980	507980	I could not have asked for better gen mates.
507980	513980	I am blown away that these girls even have freaking applied to such a crazy idea.
513980	520980	And here we are, debut and you guys have shown nothing but love and support and we are all so thankful.
520980	524980	I'm sure I speak for all of us when we were like, holy fuck, thank you.
524980	527980	Right, let me take you to Zabbit.
527980	529980	I forgot to pull it.
530980	531980	It's for decoration.
531980	533980	Okay, the tentacle in the back is for decoration.
533980	535980	Let me do the full body.
535980	536980	Let's start with the full body.
536980	540980	It may have a bandaid on for reasons.
540980	543980	But as you see, I got some swivelly hips.
543980	545980	Thank you, Nari.
545980	550980	So if you didn't know, I actually have what's known as a French manicure and pedicure.
550980	551980	Again.
551980	554980	Don't even be careful with my thighs because of the bandaid.
554980	555980	Is this smart?
555980	556980	Is this what?
556980	557980	Okay, okay.
557980	558980	I don't think that's smart.
558980	563980	As you can see, if you look really close to the elbows, I have pearlescent to my outfit.
563980	566980	My outfit isn't white, it's pearlescent.
566980	568980	So I shimmer as I move about.
568980	569980	It's fantastic.
569980	571980	And so does my seashells at the top too.
571980	578980	But yeah, I'm in the Yukata because it's a homage to Japanese culture because without Japanese culture, let's be honest.
578980	579980	Any VTubers would be here.
579980	581980	Okay, let me get real close.
581980	583980	Hopefully this isn't uncomfortable.
583980	586980	I know some people aren't like the best with eye contact.
589980	592980	If I open my eyes, it opens too.
592980	594980	Oh, and I'm sad.
594980	595980	I'm sad.
595980	597980	I have pupil restrict.
597980	599980	What did you say?
599980	601980	I'm on a muse.
601980	602980	You failed me.
602980	604980	These are my heart eyes.
604980	605980	I love them.
608980	610980	You ever seen a blushing cultfish before?
610980	613980	You know how cultfish have hypnotic patterns?
613980	615980	May I please do this for you?
615980	616980	Are you ready?
619980	620980	Hey.
621980	624980	We're going to be using this for a lot of ASMR.
624980	625980	I don't know.
625980	629980	But if you're really struggling, like if you're really struggling, how about this?
633980	634980	Yeah, it's over for you.
634980	636980	Just admit it, it's over for you.
636980	638980	I mean, how can you resist?
638980	640980	How can you resist this little Scottish accent?
