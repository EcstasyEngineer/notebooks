0	9000	What is that noise? It sounds like the fire. Oh, there we go.
9000	14000	Oh, he's like, this world is free.
14000	27000	Whoa, this is too loud.
27000	29000	3 A believes it.
29000	32000	Brave.
32000	37000	Obviously, I've jumped into the game.
37000	39000	Oh, wait a minute.
39000	46000	Oh, wait, can I hear myself?
46000	49000	I can't hear myself.
49000	52000	Get the oof.
52000	53000	What am I?
53000	57000	Mommy's here.
57000	63000	I'm going to open it.
63000	69000	Hi, good morning. Good evening.
69000	72000	Good afternoon.
72000	77000	How is that all fit to scale?
77000	81000	Oh wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Roonlight.
81000	84000	Was that like that last stream?
84000	89000	It doesn't. Wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?
89000	92000	No, don't do that. That's even worse.
92000	95000	Go below.
95000	97000	Why is there two Roonlight?
97000	102000	Is it the game capture's nice and loud?
102000	107000	Okay, no, that looks correct. I just need to do that.
107000	110000	Okay, Rinscape's just a funny-shaped game, okay?
110000	111000	It's going to be scoff.
111000	113000	It's just a funny-shaped game.
113000	117000	I'm too dumb for to figure out.
117000	119000	Is that a reflin?
119000	122000	Reflin, you're already in?
122000	125000	Other player has accepted?
125000	126000	Okay.
126000	128000	I'm like, that's a reflin, you're quick.
128000	130000	We are in World High...
130000	132000	Oh, it's replays.
132000	134000	Hi, Red E. Blink.
134000	136000	That's how I spell it.
136000	138000	Damn, reflins are shown off.
138000	140000	I'm not even freaking set.
140000	143000	Oh, this is my update for today.
143000	145000	No way, they have freaking Gangnam style
145000	148000	and freaking Rinscape 07.
148000	149000	Old school.
149000	152000	I don't know why I said 07 though.
152000	155000	Oh, my Gangnam style.
155000	157000	Sexy reflin.
157000	160000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
160000	162000	Gangnam style.
162000	164000	Howdy-ow.
164000	168000	Good morning, good evening, and good after noon.
168000	173000	I hope you guys are ready for a cheeky endurance stream.
174000	175000	Hi, reflings.
175000	177000	Hi, Strawny, I guess.
177000	181000	Yeah, I hope you're ready for a cheeky endurance today.
181000	186000	I had a bit of business going on behind the scenes,
186000	188000	business, business, business,
188000	192000	so I hope to have quite a fun update soon.
192000	195000	I've just told the girls what the business was,
195000	198000	and someone's very excited.
198000	200000	I just read their message,
201000	204000	but I can't say or else spoilers.
204000	207000	Let me open up my inventory so you guys can see what's up.
207000	209000	Yes, we are business, business, business.
209000	215000	Honestly, it feels really weird doing straight-up business, business, business.
215000	220000	The only thing I'm used to is sponsorship people reaching out to me
220000	222000	and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,
222000	224000	I will pay you this much.
224000	227000	This is what is going on.
227000	229000	And then I'm just like...
229000	231000	I can't.
231000	236000	But this time I got...
236000	239000	I will talk about it a bit more.
239000	241000	I'm going to ask permission if I can talk about it
241000	246000	because the person is associated with an agency that helped out to...
246000	247000	And if they're comfortable with it,
247000	248000	I'm happy to talk about it.
248000	249000	Obviously, nothing.
249000	251000	Azur got monetized?
253000	255000	Are you telling me Azur got monetized?
257000	260000	I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.
260000	264000	Sheevee was, which made me think within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.
264000	268000	I just hope her massive fucking honkers don't...
273000	276000	I know Denpa isn't in here right now.
276000	278000	Denpa's just messaged me.
278000	279000	She's...
279000	281000	Sean, I know you have a lot on your plate.
281000	282000	Do you think AceMars is?
282000	284000	What do you need Denpa?
284000	286000	I won't charge.
286000	287000	Denpa...
287000	290000	I won't charge, darling.
290000	293000	Oh Denpa, you're so adorable.
293000	295000	Never charge friends.
295000	299000	Always do it for free because when you have friends like these,
299000	301000	life is good.
301000	304000	I have not even known Denpa for more than two weeks
304000	306000	and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.
306000	310000	Right, I am going to go to the bank and clear out all my fissies in the background
310000	312000	whilst I ramble to yours.
312000	315000	I have absolutely terrible news.
315000	318000	Just upshotting news.
318000	321000	I tried to take a Jobay,
321000	323000	but the Jobay wouldn't have come.
323000	328000	So I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer in the middle of the stream,
328000	331000	which I'm raging because I hate...
331000	332000	Right, I don't...
332000	336000	I'll always go for a shower after I do a big Jobay
336000	338000	because I can't...
338000	340000	Wait, should I just make a...
340000	342000	I think it would actually be faster.
342000	343000	Hold on, Refluence.
343000	346000	I think it's going to be faster if I take wood out and...
350000	352000	Do I even have wood?
354000	356000	Do I even have an axe?
356000	357000	It must...
357000	359000	I do have an axe.
359000	362000	Okay, then I need a tinderbox.
362000	364000	Okay.
364000	366000	I don't actually have a bit of wood.
366000	367000	Right, that's fine though.
367000	368000	We're going to go get it.
368000	372000	Right, we'll chop here and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now
373000	375000	and eliminate all of my inventory.
378000	381000	Oh, tiny cuttles wants to trade with you.
381000	382000	What's your name?
382000	384000	Little baby cuttles.
387000	388000	Hi.
388000	390000	Oh, you already given me one.
390000	391000	Thank you.
391000	393000	Yes, I will be needing these.
393000	395000	Thank you very much.
395000	398000	The best way to ruin friendship is to get money involved.
399000	403000	I went until you learned about the development team drama.
403000	405000	Oh my God!
405000	407000	I've got a really funny fucking comment.
407000	410000	So, you know how I'm always telling you about like,
410000	414000	all I have on hand for wood right now,
414000	417000	your wood is more than enough.
417000	420000	Little Refling, I assure you.
420000	423000	A winky face, because we all know what we're talking about.
424000	425000	I'm a mod.
425000	426000	Oh, damn, bullshit!
426000	428000	I was talking about you.
432000	433000	I'm so scared.
433000	435000	I never streamed on YouTube.
435000	437000	Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.
437000	440000	It's like customary to make you a mod
440000	446000	so that you stand out more in chat.
446000	447000	DEMPA, I'm so sorry.
447000	448000	I was just exposing you.
448000	451000	I just said that you wanted an ASMR script
451000	453000	and I'm offering it for free
453000	455000	because I would never charge you for that.
455000	457000	You're freaking sick of just not...
457000	458000	Wait, wait, wait.
458000	459000	Let me pick up...
459000	460000	I'm doing two things.
460000	462000	Right, let me finish up the...
462000	464000	Why did that only take out one?
464000	466000	Oh, it's not looking good.
466000	468000	Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.
470000	472000	Oh yeah, YouTube custom.
472000	473000	Yes, you're learning right.
473000	475000	Use Tinder box on the logs.
475000	478000	Oh my God, you got a little cabbage head going on.
479000	481000	Okay, right.
481000	483000	Oh, I don't want to brag but I'm leveled to a fire making.
483000	485000	Right, we are going to just get rid of...
485000	487000	Not rid of, but...
490000	491000	But yeah, you don't...
491000	494000	Yeah, so as I was saying,
494000	497000	we got a little hate comment today on YouTube
497000	500000	but do you want to know why it's so funny?
500000	503000	It's because most of the comments were like,
503000	506000	vealers aren't going to last a month.
506000	509000	And then it went to two months and it went to six months.
509000	513000	Do you want to know what today's hate comment and quotation marks was
513000	515000	that I had to delete?
515000	518000	Vealers aren't going to last two years.
518000	521000	Motherfucker, if vealers last two years,
521000	524000	all three generations are successfully out.
524000	525000	I don't...
525000	526000	What?
526000	528000	Are you dumb?
528000	530000	I like how it went from not even going to last a week,
530000	532000	not even going to last a month.
532000	533000	Two years?
533000	535000	Two years, all three gents are out.
535000	538000	Vealers and I have succeeded in what I wanted to do.
540000	544000	Literally just multiplied the time dramatically.
544000	546000	And literally, it's a supportive message.
546000	548000	I'm like, nice try, but...
548000	551000	Wait, sorry, I think a reflim was trying to trade me.
551000	553000	Sorry, sorry.
553000	556000	I'm sorry, Brov, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.
556000	557000	What?
559000	561000	10,000 swordfish?
561000	563000	Isn't that not like 99 right there?
563000	564000	Am I going crazy?
564000	566000	Are you sure?
566000	568000	Oh my god!
570000	572000	Oh my god!
572000	574000	Wait, wait, wait, another reflim?
576000	577000	Oh no.
577000	579000	Oh my god, reflim.
579000	581000	Alright, I'm getting drunk.
581000	583000	I'm getting drunk as a skunk.
583000	584000	Actually,
584000	588000	I think we're doing drunk stream near the end.
588000	590000	Helps make the job happen.
591000	592000	I literally got like,
592000	594000	freaking 10 kabillion.
594000	596000	Right, thank you, let's go for a job.
596000	598000	Let me drink that, let me eat.
598000	600000	Oh, love the little bubble sound effect.
600000	602000	If I ever make a song, like an actual song,
602000	604000	like a custom made song,
604000	606000	oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.
610000	612000	Oh my gosh.
612000	614000	Right, in order
616000	618000	to make this super simple,
618000	620000	I'm so sorry for anyone who like,
620000	623000	is really good at organizing their shit.
623000	624000	I'm not.
624000	626000	I'm literally just going to shove
626000	628000	all the fish items to the top.
628000	630000	Please don't judge me.
630000	632000	Please don't judge me.
632000	634000	Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.
634000	636000	Raw trout, you as well.
636000	638000	Raw herring, you as well.
638000	640000	And that's cooked salmon.
640000	642000	Oh god, what a bank.
642000	644000	Gee, gee, willikers, I sure hope no one
644000	646000	cracks into a skullfish.
646000	648000	I think members later, it'll get faster.
648000	650000	One morban, literally.
650000	652000	Right, shrimp, we're going to cook
652000	654000	all the shrimp right now.
654000	656000	Unless the fire is out, I think the fire is out.
656000	658000	Okay, wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.
658000	660000	Gondor calls for aid.
660000	662000	We're just going to clean up our inventory.
662000	664000	I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000
664000	666000	freaking fish, thank you very much.
666000	668000	Desme, I'm glad I could help, thank you.
668000	670000	Bank tabs and shambles, I'm so sorry.
670000	672000	I know people are really good at like,
672000	674000	organizing their tabs.
674000	676000	I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out, let's go.
676000	678000	She's a hoarder.
678000	680000	But she's our hoarder.
680000	682000	Vsucky is done for.
682000	684000	They can't compete with Vila,
684000	686000	literally.
686000	688000	I bet you Vila won't last until
688000	690000	Vila's stuff exists then.
690000	692000	Isn't it interesting?
692000	694000	It's cooking me right now.
694000	696000	Well, you might only last two years,
696000	698000	but that's still a year.
698000	700000	22 months, 30 days,
700000	702000	23 hours,
702000	704000	59 minutes and 59
704000	706000	seconds longer than he probably lasts
706000	708000	when he touches a woman.
708000	710000	Bro, literally, oh wait,
710000	712000	whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just,
712000	714000	did you just roast him?
714000	716000	Thank you for the tip, Toria.
716000	718000	I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until you
718000	720000	I heard the very last sentence.
720000	722000	I was like, Brian?
722000	724000	Brian?
724000	726000	Oh my gosh.
726000	728000	That was,
728000	730000	I didn't expect that at all.
730000	732000	I can put this away because there's a kind
732000	734000	reflin makin' fires, right?
734000	736000	We'll do anchovies, we'll do
736000	738000	the...
738000	740000	No, don't eat.
740000	742000	Oh wait, they're cooked.
742000	744000	My apologies, such a fake
744000	746000	gamer, for I cannot hide.
746000	748000	Oh my god, reflies are like starting a
748000	750000	frickin' fire outside the bank.
750000	752000	Wait a minute, I'm not the rock
752000	754000	well uprising.
754000	756000	I was naughty.
756000	758000	I'm not there all the time.
758000	760000	I'm just, I'll put my hand up
760000	762000	and I'll say I'm not there all the time.
762000	764000	I had a little peek yesterday
764000	766000	about what you've all been
766000	768000	anonymously chatting about
768000	770000	and someone said,
770000	772000	yes, Johnny, I understand
772000	774000	Blackwell
774000	776000	headquarters.
776000	778000	And I was like, ah,
778000	780000	that's so fuckin' funny.
780000	782000	So yeah, your comment got me excited.
782000	784000	I just seen someone,
784000	786000	someone's like ritual posting
786000	788000	about Shoebe and it's like, I am nothing but trash.
788000	790000	Under Shoebe's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.
790000	792000	Then the OG
792000	794000	Sands, I was checking the OG Sands out.
794000	796000	They were spoiling, I see.
796000	798000	Absolutely spoiling it. Hey, Johnny, off topic question.
798000	800000	What's your tip
800000	802000	for Germany, Scotland today?
802000	804000	Is there a football match on?
804000	806000	Use logs on fire to make
806000	808000	bonfire, we'll not go out.
808000	810000	Isn't that all RuneScape 3?
810000	812000	I don't think that's a thing here.
812000	814000	What about having
814000	816000	many fires?
818000	820000	Any thoughts on doing an Iron Man
820000	822000	so chat can't just give you everything?
822000	824000	V-Bop
824000	826000	you have far too much
826000	828000	faith in me. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
828000	830000	I know I'm not
830000	832000	supposed to name chatters,
832000	834000	but my guy,
834000	836000	you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do.
836000	838000	The only way I could do this on my own
838000	840000	is by picking up
840000	842000	dropped fish in Barbarian Village.
842000	844000	That is the only way I know how to do it.
844000	846000	Because I don't have the funds.
846000	848000	I don't know how to make money in this game.
848000	850000	And we'd be at this for hours.
850000	852000	Squidding me right now.
852000	854000	Since
854000	856000	strong debut, something about her reminded me
856000	858000	of a Pokémon.
858000	860000	It has been on the tip of my tongue for an entire week.
860000	862000	And I finally figured it looks
862000	864000	like a Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.
866000	868000	A Cray Dilly? Hold on.
868000	870000	You're actually getting me a look up something.
870000	872000	A Cray Dilly Pokémon.
876000	878000	Oh!
878000	880000	I know them. They're in Groovy.
880000	882000	Kill things to make money.
882000	884000	Kill go-
884000	886000	Bro, goblins don't drop money.
886000	888000	The most expensive item
888000	890000	goblins drop is Goblin Mail,
890000	892000	which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.
892000	894000	Thank you, Thierry, for the other tip as well.
894000	896000	Honestly, I could see that.
896000	898000	Yeah, the fossil type.
898000	900000	Goblins are the best.
900000	902000	You're trolling me.
902000	904000	I'm getting trolled.
904000	906000	There's no way you guys actually think that.
908000	910000	I got my first Bond via marbles on stream.
912000	914000	I wish you could do marbles on stream
914000	916000	on
916000	918000	thingy.
918000	920000	On YouTube.
920000	922000	But things are very slowly getting
922000	924000	integrated to YouTube.
924000	926000	But I
926000	928000	I definitely feel YouTube
928000	930000	is becoming stronger and stronger
930000	932000	for streamers.
932000	934000	And like
934000	936000	I think what we're saying
936000	938000	that discoverability
938000	940000	who dare at
940000	942000	DEMPO
942000	944000	I don't know if you're still lurking.
944000	946000	DEMPO goes, I didn't think that far ahead.
946000	948000	What do you think would be cute? I think she likes the kind of
948000	950000	creepier it is. I'll write some creepy stuff.
952000	954000	You were strong, we were rooting for Scotland today
954000	956000	for years. Oh, we're going to do shite.
956000	958000	But it's fine. It's fine.
958000	960000	The life of a Scottish
960000	962000	national
962000	964000	Wait, no, hold on. Nationality of a Scottish person.
964000	966000	Because we understand we're just terrible.
966000	968000	Although we're decent at rugby
968000	970000	I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.
970000	972000	But the fit ball
972000	974000	The fit ball, if you didn't know
974000	976000	and to say football
976000	978000	in Scotland, you say fit
978000	980000	like FIT. But no pronunciation
980000	982000	on the T. And then ball.
982000	984000	How?
984000	986000	I'm okay with that.
986000	988000	I feel like
988000	990000	YouTube could make discoverability so much better.
990000	992000	See, I think it does
992000	994000	enough. It's Twitch that has poor
994000	996000	discoverability. However,
996000	998000	people disagree with me when I say that.
998000	1000000	And I'm like, oh, okay.
1000000	1002000	I actually thought
1002000	1004000	Shawnee literally never leaves
1004000	1006000	her arms until she may.
1006000	1008000	I just believe.
1008000	1010000	Bond lid, thank you for
1010000	1012000	coming. I remember.
1012000	1014000	Enjoy the emotes back.
1014000	1016000	The girls emotes have been ordered.
1016000	1018000	I do have a bit of bad news
1018000	1020000	about it though. The person
1020000	1022000	that I get them done by, they're like
1022000	1024000	it'll take me a month. And I'm like
1024000	1026000	excuse me?
1026000	1028000	A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.
1028000	1030000	Is that okay? And I'm like, I guess.
1030000	1032000	And then
1032000	1034000	they're like, oh, but
1034000	1036000	we've also put the base price up. And I'm like, oh,
1036000	1038000	okay then.
1038000	1040000	Okay, that's fine then.
1040000	1042000	And I'm like, okay,
1042000	1044000	that's just kind of the worst of all worlds.
1046000	1048000	But yeah, everyone else
1048000	1050000	is going to get emotes before me.
1050000	1052000	I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me
1052000	1054000	because I don't think it's fair.
1054000	1056000	My reeflings, you know how
1056000	1058000	unbelievably well
1058000	1060000	behaved you are for me and how patient.
1060000	1062000	And it's nicer for the girls
1062000	1064000	to have something to celebrate
1064000	1066000	because you already know I'm going to be
1066000	1068000	here every day.
1068000	1070000	Oh, I was saying
1070000	1072000	that my first drunk stream
1072000	1074000	I'm not sure how much people
1074000	1076000	are going to like this. And I can already see
1076000	1078000	some of you typing and rolling your
1078000	1080000	eyes. Keep your eyes to the
1080000	1082000	front of your head. I don't want one eye
1082000	1084000	rolling to the back of the skull.
1084000	1086000	What was I saying?
1090000	1092000	My first drunk
1092000	1094000	stream was going to be
1094000	1096000	a
1096000	1098000	drunk apex, but I don't go
1098000	1100000	offline until we win.
1100000	1102000	But, okay.
1102000	1104000	How did you time that?
1104000	1106000	There's a stream delay. How did you
1106000	1108000	even time that?
1108000	1110000	Fucking reefling in game said
1110000	1112000	eye roll. How did you time that?
1112000	1114000	A 30
1114000	1116000	hour stream. Oh, I thought that.
1116000	1118000	But then I was like, would you guys rather
1118000	1120000	jellybean game? Some sort of drunk
1120000	1122000	multiplayer game.
1122000	1124000	So the stream is just never going to end, pretty much.
1124000	1126000	Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1126000	1128000	Everyone is like dunking on apex.
1128000	1130000	Well, there's other multiplayer games
1130000	1132000	we can play if you'd rather drunk
1132000	1134000	that. But I feel like drunk jellybean
1134000	1136000	is just going to be me like
1136000	1138000	please, please
1138000	1140000	please let me, let me
1140000	1142000	get to the past and first level
1142000	1144000	please
1144000	1146000	I don't want to spectate.
1146000	1148000	And I'll be drunk and hold up.
1148000	1150000	Why is so much fire? You had drunk
1150000	1152000	runes. How is drunk runescape fun?
1152000	1154000	I put the
1154000	1156000	shrimp on the
1156000	1158000	fire.
1158000	1160000	It cooks the shrimp
1160000	1162000	and my level
1162000	1164000	gets higher.
1164000	1166000	Drunk fire cave.
1166000	1168000	Oh, got drunk.
1168000	1170000	Accidentally achieved 99
1170000	1172000	fletching.
1172000	1174000	Runescape is never fun.
1174000	1176000	You drink every time you make an alcoholic
1176000	1178000	drink.
1178000	1180000	Don't let you get past level one
1180000	1182000	this time around.
1182000	1184000	That's what I'm worried about
1184000	1186000	the true endurance stream for real
1186000	1188000	for real. Well bank the bank
1188000	1190000	runescape is a job
1190000	1192000	but honestly, that's funny.
1192000	1194000	Oh wait, no, that's kik chuna
1194000	1196000	but you're unkik
1196000	1198000	true herring.
1198000	1200000	Castle wars is
1200000	1202000	for you play. Hydration, I need
1202000	1204000	to finish my tea.
1208000	1210000	Which
1210000	1212000	yes
1212000	1214000	I
1214000	1216000	I've
1216000	1218000	also planned out
1218000	1220000	the membership
1220000	1222000	streams for next week. Again
1222000	1224000	if you are unable to member, please don't
1224000	1226000	worry.
1226000	1228000	Dear little reeflings, I stream
1228000	1230000	every single day free access.
1232000	1234000	What movie did I pick?
1234000	1236000	I think I might have picked
1236000	1238000	Austin Powers
1238000	1240000	for the movie
1240000	1242000	question mark. How are you keeping this
1242000	1244000	up?
1244000	1246000	I don't know. I thought you could only have one
1248000	1250000	or she'll start leaking secret.
1250000	1252000	No, I shut off about all the insider
1252000	1254000	stuff now. I'm starting to leak it.
1254000	1256000	Well, I've not said anything that I've
1256000	1258000	regret saying. I don't
1258000	1260000	regret being like, yeah, we
1260000	1262000	don't need talent managers
1262000	1264000	because it turns out if you give
1264000	1266000	it a try.
1266000	1268000	Actually, I would like to expand upon that
1268000	1270000	point. Now that you've got me on that
1270000	1272000	subject, hold on a minute little reefling.
1272000	1274000	The reason why talent
1274000	1276000	managers aren't necessarily needed
1276000	1278000	is because these girls have streamed
1278000	1280000	and they have plenty of experience.
1280000	1282000	Who goes there?
1282000	1284000	And
1284000	1286000	to
1286000	1288000	go from independent
1288000	1290000	where you pick your streams and you pick
1290000	1292000	everything and then you're on a one week
1292000	1294000	interval every week to stream what you want.
1294000	1296000	It just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make
1296000	1298000	sense to me, okay?
1298000	1300000	So, yeah.
1300000	1302000	Sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream.
1302000	1304000	I mean, you can always go back and watch the VODs.
1304000	1306000	At any point you become
1306000	1308000	a member, you can access the VODs
1308000	1310000	on the membership
1310000	1312000	strums. I just need to
1312000	1314000	once I make
1314000	1316000	the lobbies for them,
1316000	1318000	I just need to make sure I do it for the correct
1318000	1320000	membership here.
1320000	1322000	Holy crap, we're creeping on the next level.
1322000	1324000	I actually don't know what level we are.
1324000	1326000	We're level 52. We're about to be
1326000	1328000	53. We're slowly creeping
1328000	1330000	up.
1330000	1332000	Wait, are they flirting? What's going on here?
1332000	1334000	Agility. Construction
1334000	1336000	and slayer.
1336000	1338000	Oh, we're all debating on what... I thought
1338000	1340000	runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst.
1340000	1342000	It's
1342000	1344000	stressful with a manager.
1344000	1346000	I just feel very strongly
1346000	1348000	that
1348000	1350000	I mean, obviously in my instance
1350000	1352000	the girls in that are happy for me
1352000	1354000	to say all of them streamed way longer
1354000	1356000	than me. Why would they need to come
1356000	1358000	to me for permission to stream?
1358000	1360000	It just seems rather odd,
1360000	1362000	you know?
1362000	1364000	It just doesn't make any sense.
1366000	1368000	Mooncrafting has
1368000	1370000	a minigame now. Oh, to make it faster?
1374000	1376000	I'm thinking of how many watch hours I need
1376000	1378000	to pack up when I get home though. Honestly though...
1380000	1382000	I've planned out
1382000	1384000	the
1384000	1386000	Elden Ring streams
1388000	1390000	but
1390000	1392000	I just realised I might have to delay it by a day
1392000	1394000	because of time zones. I don't know
1394000	1396000	if the DLC has a time zone release
1396000	1398000	but from being
1398000	1400000	an upside down land
1400000	1402000	whenever there's an ad for a game
1402000	1404000	and it's like, this game comes out on this day
1404000	1406000	and I'm like, well that's a lie
1406000	1408000	because it's not time synced
1410000	1412000	because I'm in the future, right now I'm in the future
1412000	1414000	it's 4am on the 15th
1414000	1416000	like I'm in the future, you know?
1418000	1420000	So I might have accidentally planned
1420000	1422000	my Elden Ring stream a day too early
1422000	1424000	before the DLC comes out
1424000	1426000	but then again
1426000	1428000	we could play it
1428000	1430000	early. Actually, no
1430000	1432000	there's not going to be a problem
1432000	1434000	with being able to be at the DLC anyway
1434000	1436000	because we're starting fresh
1436000	1438000	How's the future?
1438000	1440000	I mean
1440000	1442000	it's alright
1442000	1444000	I ain't got much of a quarrel with it
1446000	1448000	That's a lot of marks of grace
1448000	1450000	yes, that's going to be
1450000	1452000	a major endurance stream
1452000	1454000	back to back
1454000	1456000	I've planned 4 days
1456000	1458000	around it
1458000	1460000	it might leak into a 5th day
1460000	1462000	but I'm sorry to anyone watching that
1462000	1464000	Elden Ring isn't your thing
1464000	1466000	you know?
1466000	1468000	Arise, you tarnish
1468000	1470000	Do you have a save file ready?
1470000	1472000	No, I was going to start fresh
1474000	1476000	I was going to start from the beginning
1476000	1478000	yeah, because I like when you guys get to
1478000	1480000	hold my hand
1480000	1482000	through the stream
1482000	1484000	and someone said a marshmallow
1484000	1486000	and I was like, can we invade?
1486000	1488000	and I'm like, that's actually what we do
1488000	1490000	and then one reekling comes in
1490000	1492000	as an invader or enemy
1492000	1494000	and it means we can safely walk around
1494000	1496000	the areas and stuff
1496000	1498000	I didn't know if I should bring out the shock caller
1498000	1500000	so every time I perish
1500000	1502000	you guys get to shock me
1502000	1504000	I don't know if that's a bit too weird though
1504000	1506000	for what we're...
1506000	1508000	I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run
1508000	1510000	of all of us being like, I remember this
1510000	1512000	I remember that, I remember when we did this
1512000	1514000	remember when we did that
1514000	1516000	and then I've just got a shock caller going
1516000	1518000	every time
1518000	1520000	every time I mess up
1524000	1526000	I will probably be on here rinsking
1526000	1528000	during that, oh I need to finish my tea
1534000	1536000	I've been making my teas
1536000	1538000	with far too much honey, it's rubbish
1538000	1540000	alcohol poisoning
1540000	1542000	no, I cannot
1542000	1544000	drink and play rinsking
1544000	1546000	Elden Ring, there's no chance of that
1546000	1548000	the shock caller
1548000	1550000	is with Sin, I actually need to message her
1550000	1552000	because unfortunately
1552000	1554000	I need to delay that stream due to
1554000	1556000	obligations
1558000	1560000	because essentially week 3
1560000	1562000	is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4
1562000	1564000	Elden Ring with Sin and
1564000	1566000	I think that would
1566000	1568000	alienate
1568000	1570000	too many
1570000	1572000	supporters being like, oh god
1572000	1574000	get off that game already
1574000	1576000	you can do it, don't let
1576000	1578000	you get in the way
1578000	1580000	don't let yourself get in the way
1580000	1582000	honestly
1582000	1584000	I do have a fun update for those of you
1584000	1586000	who enjoy seeing my hands
1586000	1588000	I have successfully ordered
1588000	1590000	the Uwu Market
1590000	1592000	keychains
1592000	1594000	and merchandise
1594000	1596000	I bought my own merchandise
1596000	1598000	but I got a discount code and all that
1598000	1600000	I've got the keychains
1600000	1602000	of all the girls coming
1602000	1604000	so I'm going to do
1604000	1606000	a little hand ASMR soon
1606000	1608000	for anyone
1608000	1610000	now don't worry this content
1610000	1612000	will be made public that I'm about to discuss
1612000	1614000	for anyone who is currently on
1614000	1616000	Patreon
1616000	1618000	they got early access to
1618000	1620000	a YouTube video
1620000	1622000	which was absolutely outrageous
1622000	1624000	but I'm just wanting to know
1624000	1626000	if anyone in chat did
1626000	1628000	listen to that outrageous
1628000	1630000	audio and what were your thoughts about it
1632000	1634000	I'm also using my Patreon
1634000	1636000	as a big
1636000	1638000	archive of anything that I produce
1638000	1640000	sadly
1640000	1642000	four audios are unable to be
1642000	1644000	uploaded to it because I was
1644000	1646000	very dumb
1646000	1648000	I've made a four part
1648000	1650000	series
1650000	1652000	that has hypnosis in it
1652000	1654000	but Patreon actually doesn't allow
1654000	1656000	that so I'm going
1656000	1658000	to upload it on my alt
1658000	1660000	twitter for free not a problem
1660000	1662000	I just need to edit it and get out the way
1662000	1664000	but it means
1664000	1666000	I'm now missing four audios
1668000	1670000	raw tuna
1670000	1672000	that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked
1672000	1674000	that's cooked so lobster
1674000	1676000	tuna and then we tackle the
1676000	1678000	10k freaking
1678000	1680000	sword fish
1680000	1682000	this is going to be interesting
1682000	1684000	I keep running out of love
1684000	1686000	are the hoodies
1686000	1688000	no nothing is
1688000	1690000	limited by ubu market
1690000	1692000	actually I need to talk to them
1692000	1694000	again because
1694000	1696000	Azura is coming up
1700000	1702000	y'all
1702000	1704000	why does he not like hypnosis
1704000	1706000	Mastercard our
1706000	1708000	unloved overlords
1708000	1710000	have deemed that hypnosis
1710000	1712000	is in
1712000	1714000	consensual for some reason
1714000	1716000	even though it fully is like you will never do
1716000	1718000	something that you don't want to do
1720000	1722000	and unfortunately
1722000	1724000	Patreon always have to bend the knee
1724000	1726000	a lot of people have issues with Patreon
1726000	1728000	but the reality of the situation is
1728000	1730000	our overlords that we despise
1730000	1732000	the ones who are on Epstein island
1732000	1734000	all the time but
1734000	1736000	deem hypnosis as non consensual
1736000	1738000	so it cannot be
1738000	1740000	uploaded to Patreon however
1740000	1742000	for some
1742000	1744000	I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial
1744000	1746000	but guess what
1746000	1748000	Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely
1748000	1750000	fine with that kind of content
1750000	1752000	so I'm sorry but one up on Elon Musk
1752000	1754000	because he couldn't give less of a rat's arse
1754000	1756000	and to be honest
1756000	1758000	that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to
1758000	1760000	just making content
1760000	1762000	we're all adults here we're all doing our thing
1762000	1764000	like there's no need
1764000	1766000	for all these things going on
1766000	1768000	but yeah
1772000	1774000	so unfortunately
1774000	1776000	it means I have four missing
1776000	1778000	oh I shouldn't say those words
1778000	1780000	sorry four inkable audios
1780000	1782000	so I need to go
1782000	1784000	record so
1784000	1786000	I'm not actually sure what my fourth upload
1786000	1788000	this month is going to be on Patreon
1788000	1790000	because
1792000	1794000	originally it was supposed to be
1794000	1796000	part one of the series
1796000	1798000	but it's not possible
1804000	1806000	but yeah did you like the audio
1806000	1808000	for those of you who are on Patreon
1808000	1810000	because it was absolutely outrageous
1810000	1812000	you can probably monetize Twitter eventually
1812000	1814000	oh you need five million
1814000	1816000	impressions I'm not sure we're there
1816000	1818000	unless like well she
1818000	1820000	stirs
1820000	1822000	and Mercy
1822000	1824000	can't get caught in the algorithm
1824000	1826000	when
1826000	1828000	this new meta came up
1828000	1830000	so they actually probably do
1830000	1832000	have that
1832000	1834000	but
1834000	1836000	yeah like
1836000	1838000	if Twitter is like yeah this is
1838000	1840000	four I've burnt all of them
1840000	1842000	I have five
1842000	1844000	lobbies out of that that's terrible
1846000	1848000	that was a really rough run right lobbies
1848000	1850000	we've got 500 let's see
1850000	1852000	how much we just absolutely
1852000	1854000	waste honestly
1854000	1856000	we'll do
1858000	1860000	it was very unhinged the ASMR
1860000	1862000	yeah I thought it was hilarious
1862000	1864000	I was like freaking jumping around
1864000	1866000	the mic
1866000	1868000	I was doing like backflips trying to come over
1868000	1870000	and like get it louder and stuff
1870000	1872000	do you know how many I put so many
1872000	1874000	like noise dampening filters
1874000	1876000	on the audio as well
1876000	1878000	but the clap was so loud
1878000	1880000	it was outrageous
1880000	1882000	um
1882000	1884000	I don't know if it'll survive on YouTube
1884000	1886000	but I'll still upload it as a YOLO anyway
1886000	1888000	because it's hilarious and I don't care
1888000	1890000	and to be honest I never really
1890000	1892000	did anything that outrageous because it's just
1892000	1894000	sound like to me it's like just
1894000	1896000	the sound of someone clapping their hands okay
1896000	1898000	it's just what's actually happening
1898000	1900000	that's a bit outrageous but because
1900000	1902000	there's no audio it's fine
1902000	1904000	so because there's no visual
1904000	1906000	unhinged isn't a negative thing
1906000	1908000	Sony the audio is the reason
1910000	1912000	I'll have to
1912000	1914000	go stuff to see the 7th grade
1914000	1916000	yeah basically
1916000	1918000	I did clapping ASMR
1918000	1920000	but I didn't use my hands
1920000	1922000	hmm
1922000	1924000	I want her
1924000	1926000	well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish
1926000	1928000	I don't need any more fish if it's for me
1928000	1930000	I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish
1932000	1934000	um but yeah
1934000	1936000	that's the audio I made
1936000	1938000	oh my god
1938000	1940000	we've almost leveled up again
1940000	1942000	54
1942000	1944000	that's fantastic
1944000	1946000	what a genius entrepreneur truly
1946000	1948000	I've turned
1948000	1950000	I fell asleep to the begging one
1950000	1952000	really?
1952000	1954000	that got so popular
1954000	1956000	I'm like I definitely hit the algorithm
1956000	1958000	because
1958000	1960000	well someone said on one of my
1960000	1962000	ASMR stream
1962000	1964000	wait what happened there
1964000	1966000	someone said on my ASMR stream
1966000	1968000	that
1968000	1970000	I was on tiktok feature
1970000	1972000	page
1972000	1974000	but Vailer doesn't upload
1974000	1976000	to tiktok we've reserved everyone's name
1976000	1978000	on tiktok just in case
1978000	1980000	but it's more important
1980000	1982000	to do youtube shorts vs tiktok
1982000	1984000	like over that kind of thing
1984000	1986000	um
1988000	1990000	what liquid you put on your
1990000	1992000	not hands I heard you spree something at the beginning
1992000	1994000	oh it's coconut oil
1996000	1998000	it's oil
1998000	2000000	in the audio like literally in the audio
2000000	2002000	you can hear me take off my prel
2002000	2004000	I left that in on purpose
2004000	2006000	because I breathed
2006000	2008000	like heavily through it and I was like
2008000	2010000	I'll edit this out but then I was like
2010000	2012000	oh maybe someone would enjoy it
2012000	2014000	so I just left it in so you can literally
2014000	2016000	hear me take off my weapon drew
2016000	2018000	and armour
2018000	2020000	nudge nudge
2022000	2024000	tiktok clippers
2024000	2026000	no like so on tiktok
2026000	2028000	it's called
2028000	2030000	a video format is called tiktok
2030000	2032000	where's youtube it's called the short
2032000	2034000	and twitch it's a clip
2034000	2036000	but it's all the same thing
2036000	2038000	oh I leveled up I got 54
2038000	2040000	oh my gosh
2040000	2042000	maybe 70 is gonna be like
2042000	2044000	way before like at the rate we're
2044000	2046000	doing these lobbies
2048000	2050000	um
2050000	2052000	my beloved
2052000	2054000	thank you
2054000	2056000	oh my god that voice crack
2056000	2058000	70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe
2058000	2060000	I might have
2060000	2062000	underestimated how much we're gonna get
2064000	2066000	the little extra sounds add a lot
2066000	2068000	oh right so I can actually tell you
2068000	2070000	the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping
2070000	2072000	let's call it the coconut clapping
2072000	2074000	that'll be our code word for it
2074000	2076000	um
2076000	2078000	the reason why you hear me go
2078000	2080000	oh and then
2080000	2082000	I do it is because I had to hold on
2082000	2084000	to my
2084000	2086000	my gooblies because they were
2086000	2088000	bumping
2088000	2090000	and jumping because of like
2090000	2092000	in order to make
2092000	2094000	um your buns of steel
2094000	2096000	clap you have to like go up and down
2096000	2098000	quite not violently
2098000	2100000	but you have to make it quite fast that's something
2100000	2102000	sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes
2102000	2104000	it's like one after
2104000	2106000	I'd clap that coconut I mean what
2106000	2108000	the cool thing is
2108000	2110000	that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent
2110000	2112000	doesn't mean it tastes like coconut
2112000	2114000	I mean right now probably
2114000	2116000	oh I should do that smell trend
2116000	2118000	I keep forgetting coconut clapping
2118000	2120000	like 1 to 5 of them
2120000	2122000	if you cook at a range next door you're burned
2122000	2124000	I can't be bothered moving though
2124000	2126000	I want to stay with my reef limbs at the fire
2126000	2128000	I was gone for 5 just strong
2128000	2130000	he died no I'm level
2130000	2132000	54
2132000	2134000	I just came to realise I've probably
2134000	2136000	severely underestimated that we're
2136000	2138000	achieved 70s this stream
2138000	2140000	we are most likely going to have
2140000	2142000	a lot more than that
2142000	2144000	um
2144000	2146000	aggressively clapping coconut
2146000	2148000	well at one minute I was like I feel like
2148000	2150000	um saw
2150000	2152000	I think I said saw but what I meant was
2152000	2154000	jaws that shark like that
2154000	2156000	because I was away I went
2156000	2158000	walked further away from the microphone
2158000	2160000	and then came closer and it was like
2160000	2162000	ding ding ding clap clap
2162000	2164000	ding ding ding clap clap clap clap clap
2164000	2166000	it's one of the most
2166000	2168000	ridiculous audios I've ever made but
2168000	2170000	I got halfway
2170000	2172000	through editing my
2172000	2174000	first
2174000	2176000	1k thank you
2176000	2178000	oh wait I've got salmon sugar
2178000	2180000	I didn't notice that salmon there wait I'll finish
2180000	2182000	off the salmon
2182000	2184000	um
2184000	2186000	I got halfway through
2186000	2188000	finishing my first like 1000
2188000	2190000	special ASMR and it's just
2190000	2192000	me rambling
2192000	2194000	and doing tingles it honestly
2194000	2196000	probably feels like a live stream like when I
2196000	2198000	just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles
2198000	2200000	but like I was having so much fun
2200000	2202000	like um being like

2346000	2348000	literally the girl
2348000	2350000	as far as I'm aware the girls are happy
2350000	2352000	they can pick what they want do what they want
2352000	2354000	unfortunately
2354000	2356000	because
2356000	2358000	Azura and Emi
2358000	2360000	are on a warning
2360000	2362000	um
2362000	2364000	by juicy youtube thanks to their

2374000	2376000	um
2376000	2378000	oh
2378000	2380000	unfortunately I've not
2380000	2382000	I've kind of discouraged them
2382000	2384000	for doing ASMR until the warning is up
2384000	2386000	because it's very dangerous
2386000	2388000	if they get a strike um
2388000	2390000	I'm like brav
2390000	2392000	youtube please
2392000	2394000	I'm back
2394000	2396000	I got distracted oh don't worry I'm literally here
2396000	2398000	for 12 hours don't worry
2398000	2400000	we're doing an endurance today I have had
2400000	2402000	so many short streams this week
2402000	2404000	it felt so weird
2404000	2406000	like I do have a lot
2406000	2408000	of time to like finally start editing
2408000	2410000	I have a heck of a lot of vtuber
2410000	2412000	ASMR collabs coming through
2412000	2414000	I wrote an ASMR collab
2414000	2416000	for two the girls would be allure together
2416000	2418000	um
2418000	2420000	and
2420000	2422000	the girls
2422000	2424000	one of them reacted
2424000	2426000	and thought the plot was adorable
2426000	2428000	it's just super basic short plot
2428000	2430000	I never want to overwhelm the girls
2430000	2432000	with anything that I assign them
2432000	2434000	so please don't think it's like some super mega
2434000	2436000	do do do do do
2436000	2438000	eh
2438000	2440000	I know that there is a collab with Mercy
2440000	2442000	that's both audio and
2442000	2444000	55
2444000	2446000	um that's both audio
2446000	2448000	and we get to play this game tomorrow

2452000	2454000	um I am going to play RuneScape
2454000	2456000	before it because
2456000	2458000	I am going to stream on
2458000	2460000	Mercy's time zone like when she
2460000	2462000	normally streams um
2462000	2464000	so basically we're gonna play RuneScape
2464000	2466000	for a solid
2466000	2468000	chunk and then I'm gonna go offline and
2468000	2470000	rest my voice for like an hour
2470000	2472000	or two no probably
2472000	2474000	two hours because I'll be in voice call
2474000	2476000	with Mercy one hour before
2476000	2478000	eh the collab if you didn't know
2478000	2480000	it is common courtesy for vtuber
2480000	2482000	to show up one hour before
2482000	2484000	eh a collab which is where you
2484000	2486000	do all of your um
2486000	2488000	technical
2488000	2490000	failures as I had with
2490000	2492000	flipping
2492000	2494000	eh again special shout out to sheebie
2494000	2496000	for keeping my head on my shoulders
2496000	2498000	I was panicking when
2498000	2500000	we could not do up
2500000	2502000	eh
2502000	2504000	she's grinding so fast
2504000	2506000	baby won't you
2506000	2508000	grind on me
2508000	2510000	relax your mind
2510000	2512000	turn your time
2512000	2514000	with me
2514000	2516000	that's all I know of that song
2516000	2518000	I got one cake
2518000	2520000	carambua
2520000	2522000	when you start cooking
2522000	2524000	members first
2524000	2526000	I have like
2526000	2528000	10,000 swordfish to go through
2528000	2530000	I have no idea what even potential
2530000	2532000	xp that might is
2532000	2534000	that might is ok well
2534000	2536000	one you're done what english was that
2540000	2542000	eh is that a threat or a promise
2544000	2546000	eh I was gonna
2546000	2548000	do marshmallows
2548000	2550000	actually I got such nice
2550000	2552000	marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me because
2552000	2554000	if I get emotional
2554000	2556000	and start reading them I start getting
2556000	2558000	teary eyed and I'm like I can't handle these
2558000	2560000	right now because it's gonna like make me cry
2560000	2562000	like happy tears
2562000	2564000	so you guys need to stop being so nice to me
2568000	2570000	there's currently a reflin
2570000	2572000	ehm
2572000	2574000	who's keeping me updated about their addiction
2574000	2576000	right now and they're like
2576000	2578000	I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction
2578000	2580000	I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction
2580000	2582000	I'm like how are you
2582000	2584000	what how
2584000	2586000	like that's amazing like I could get
2586000	2588000	into the nitty-gritty of like how insane
2588000	2590000	addiction is and look
2590000	2592000	your brain once it creates
2592000	2594000	a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep
2594000	2596000	repeating that it's nice and easy it's why
2596000	2598000	nostalgia is so powerful because you don't
2598000	2600000	have to like learn the new lore of something
2600000	2602000	it sounds silly but
2602000	2604000	ehm
2604000	2606000	like it's very easy
2606000	2608000	to fall into addiction
2608000	2610000	and especially
2610000	2612000	your makeup your genetic
2612000	2614000	makeup can make you predisposition
2614000	2616000	for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating
2616000	2618000	because it's like it's kind of like
2618000	2620000	gamba like I spoke previously
2620000	2622000	I had a
2622000	2624000	advertisement offer
2624000	2626000	of four thousand US dollars
2626000	2628000	to insert a 60 second
2628000	2630000	gamba ad
2630000	2632000	and I said no because
2632000	2634000	it's gamba
2634000	2636000	but it's very interesting
2636000	2638000	how
2638000	2640000	severely gamba seems to
2640000	2642000	affect individuals
2642000	2644000	now this is just an observation
2644000	2646000	but whenever I've seen
2646000	2648000	gamba ads that are like stop when the fund
2648000	2650000	stops a ten thousand
2650000	2652000	swordfish should get you to level 78
2652000	2654000	let's go
2654000	2656000	oh my god 78 by 9 to the stream
2656000	2658000	ehm
2658000	2660000	whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't
2660000	2662000	is like stop stop when the fund stops
2662000	2664000	they always show a guy
2664000	2666000	and I'm wondering
2666000	2668000	ehm
2668000	2670000	is the predisp... not the pre
2670000	2672000	the socialization
2672000	2674000	because obviously if we're being
2674000	2676000	very stereotypical of society
2676000	2678000	we live in a society
2678000	2680000	guys are normally more interested in sports
2680000	2682000	and is the
2682000	2684000	environment around it that it's normal
2684000	2686000	to gamble
2686000	2688000	and kind of like put a cheeky
2688000	2690000	10 or here on this
2690000	2692000	bet a 20
2692000	2694000	quid here on this bet type thing
2694000	2696000	before it snowballs out of control
2696000	2698000	it's quite
2698000	2700000	fascinating I actually had someone
2700000	2702000	in real life I knew
2702000	2704000	that
2704000	2706000	they weren't a family member but
2706000	2708000	they were like an acquaintance and I learned
2708000	2710000	of their story
2710000	2712000	and basically
2712000	2714000	the guy gambled away their mortgage
2714000	2716000	and
2716000	2718000	it's just
2718000	2720000	it's such a shame what kind of grip
2720000	2722000	it has
2722000	2724000	on certain people because for me
2724000	2726000	right now I
2726000	2728000	I am
2728000	2730000	I'm like confident that I don't have
2730000	2732000	that kind of addiction
2732000	2734000	I
2734000	2736000	it doesn't appeal to me
2736000	2738000	I would walk away
2738000	2740000	like angry that I wasted
2740000	2742000	my money type thing like my brain
2742000	2744000	doesn't go oh
2744000	2746000	if I gamble again I'll make back
2746000	2748000	what I lost like no my brain's like
2748000	2750000	I'll waste the time that was I'd rather play
2750000	2752000	like a video game or something else like that
2752000	2754000	you know
2754000	2756000	I wish I could join you but not on RuneScape
2756000	2758000	wait what's wrong with RuneScape
2758000	2760000	it's old school
2760000	2762000	look these are all Reeflings we're all just hanging
2762000	2764000	out outside the we're all hanging
2764000	2766000	out in Edgeville for no particular
2766000	2768000	reason
2768000	2770000	um
2770000	2772000	yeah sorry I don't know if
2772000	2774000	I need to turn down the
2774000	2776000	that sound
2776000	2778000	effect
2778000	2780000	I'll turn down the sound effect just because
2780000	2782000	it's very repetitive
2782000	2784000	but hopefully you can still
2784000	2786000	hear it but
2786000	2788000	sorry
2788000	2790000	we're in Edgeville together where you can do better
2790000	2792000	90% of gamblers quit
2792000	2794000	before they've been big now I have seen those
2794000	2796000	memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny
2796000	2798000	but it is
2798000	2800000	just a very curious
2802000	2804000	predicament that people seem to get themselves into
2804000	2806000	I mean that's kind of what
2806000	2808000	kick the website kick.com
2808000	2810000	if you heard about it
2810000	2812000	the only
2812000	2814000	reason they are able to be fueled
2814000	2816000	so high is because of
2816000	2818000	Gamble
2818000	2820000	there's no other
2820000	2822000	reason and it's perfectly
2822000	2824000	fine to say that
2826000	2828000	but it just kind of goes to show
2828000	2830000	you how big the house always
2830000	2832000	wins if they can offer this business
2832000	2834000	model on the side
2834000	2836000	I don't know if you guys remember
2836000	2838000	when Twitch officially announced
2838000	2840000	it's like banning Gamble
2842000	2844000	it's just very curious
2844000	2846000	because
2846000	2848000	there's a lot of
2848000	2850000	discussion you can get into and you can say
2850000	2852000	well the person that's Gamble
2852000	2854000	and it's their money
2854000	2856000	it's their life
2856000	2858000	it's their choice
2858000	2860000	but if like
2860000	2862000	I'm trying to think
2862000	2864000	and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a sense
2864000	2866000	so
2868000	2870000	is it the
2870000	2872000	hold on let me put my sense together
2874000	2876000	when is it not a choice
2876000	2878000	when is it not a choice is the question
2878000	2880000	why is it it's addiction
2880000	2882000	and not a choice when it comes to
2882000	2884000	Gamble but it might be
2884000	2886000	a choice when it comes to other bad actions
2886000	2888000	you might do in your life
2888000	2890000	why is Gamble marked out for one
2890000	2892000	why is alcoholism marked out for one
2892000	2894000	obviously when it comes to alcoholism
2894000	2896000	your body does change the tolerance
2896000	2898000	but you could argue the same for Gamble
2898000	2900000	because your brain literally
2900000	2902000	lights up like fireworks
2902000	2904000	when you win
2904000	2906000	and it's just very
2906000	2908000	interesting because where's the line
2908000	2910000	drawn from someone is consenting
2910000	2912000	to do this activity and someone
2912000	2914000	isn't able to consent to do this activity
2914000	2916000	because it's causing harm
2916000	2918000	you could argue sitting on runescape
2918000	2920000	for 12 hours well that's causing harm
2920000	2922000	oh well
2922000	2924000	we'll need to take her offline
2924000	2926000	because she's not well because she's doing this
2926000	2928000	for 12 hours because that's bad
2928000	2930000	for her health sitting for 12 hours
2930000	2932000	type thing you know
2932000	2934000	do you know what I'm trying to say out loud
2934000	2936000	I struggle to say the words
2936000	2938000	thank you for coming
2938000	2940000	I'm a member tier
2940000	2942000	destructive behaviours that have historically
2942000	2944000	been deemed as vices that's where it is
2944000	2946000	yeah like
2946000	2948000	we're being called out literally all runescapers
2948000	2950000	getting called out from across the line
2950000	2952000	wow we're about to level up again
2952000	2954000	oh my god just let me do
2954000	2956000	one ramble and we're going to be
2956000	2958000	99 overnight like just
2958000	2960000	give me one subject to ramble about
2960000	2962000	and we're done there is a logout
2962000	2964000	timer after 6 hours I will
2964000	2966000	most likely log me out when I go for the big job
2966000	2968000	but I don't need one right now
2970000	2972000	but yeah
2972000	2974000	in college maxing on runescapers did it
2974000	2976000	on homework real
2976000	2978000	the lines do get but well that's
2978000	2980000	it's the interesting thing it's like when
2980000	2982000	where do laws come into place to protect
2982000	2984000	gamble
2984000	2986000	gamblers sorry
2986000	2988000	because when you lose
2988000	2990000	your money you're told tough
2990000	2992000	tough bananas
2992000	2994000	yay 56
2994000	2996000	yatta
2996000	2998000	when you lose all your money you're told
2998000	3000000	tough bananas
3000000	3002000	when you lose your money to scam
3002000	3004000	the bank says see tough bananas
3004000	3006000	but yeah there's laws in place
3006000	3008000	to protect you in quotation marks
3008000	3010000	and to get the
3010000	3012000	scammers put in jail to get
3012000	3014000	well you can't really put
3014000	3016000	casinos in jail so that doesn't work
3016000	3018000	that's a terrible
3018000	3020000	comparison
3024000	3026000	hmm
3026000	3028000	well I've kind of shot myself in that
3028000	3030000	line of thought I've completely undone
3030000	3032000	that line of thought there I do apologize
3032000	3034000	um
3034000	3036000	there's really
3036000	3038000	no good answer no there isn't
3038000	3040000	that's the thing
3040000	3042000	that's the thing that's the thing I want to
3042000	3044000	highlight there is
3044000	3046000	no answer and yet
3046000	3048000	we still have some laws such as
3048000	3050000	you know obviously twitch isn't
3050000	3052000	law but twitch is a reflection
3052000	3054000	of the community views
3054000	3056000	or the views of the masses
3056000	3058000	now do you remember
3058000	3060000	when a
3060000	3062000	pokemon was like yeah gamma bad
3062000	3064000	and then all of a sudden twitter blew up
3064000	3066000	and then twitter was like
3066000	3068000	gamma bad and then twitch was like
3068000	3070000	okay now we'll remove
3070000	3072000	gamma like
3072000	3074000	that is a perfect
3074000	3076000	example of
3076000	3078000	the most basic movement
3078000	3080000	now don't get me wrong movement isn't world changing
3080000	3082000	but it is the basic example
3082000	3084000	of someone who definitely
3084000	3086000	is on a larger platform
3086000	3088000	going hey this thing
3088000	3090000	bad and then everyone going
3090000	3092000	wait a minute yes
3092000	3094000	this thing is bad
3094000	3096000	and then boom
3096000	3098000	twitch
3098000	3100000	got rid of the category
3100000	3102000	and outlawed it and said no bad
3102000	3104000	now that is
3104000	3106000	and just
3106000	3108000	a bloody perfect example
3108000	3110000	of how
3110000	3112000	the community
3112000	3114000	the community
3114000	3116000	in specific areas and pockets
3116000	3118000	do have a voice
3118000	3120000	and do have a say
3120000	3122000	as much as you might not think on an individual level
3122000	3124000	you don't have a voice
3124000	3126000	it might be true but have you ever seen
3126000	3128000	planet of the apes
3128000	3130000	monkey on own
3130000	3132000	weak
3132000	3134000	monkey together strong
3134000	3136000	it is true
3136000	3138000	you can't even deny it there's so many examples
3138000	3140000	of this
3140000	3142000	like think of revolutions
3142000	3144000	such as the french revolution
3144000	3146000	one individual would get their head
3146000	3148000	guillotined ok
3148000	3150000	I'm not being funny I'm being so
3150000	3152000	true this is my rabbit hole
3152000	3154000	but like literally the french
3154000	3156000	revolution one person stands up
3156000	3158000	and gets their head chopped off right
3158000	3160000	no revolution no movement
3160000	3162000	community is not you know
3162000	3164000	community is not going to rise up
3164000	3166000	but hold on a minute the people are revolting
3166000	3168000	the people
3168000	3170000	are revolting the masses are outraged
3170000	3172000	how can society continue
3172000	3174000	if everyone bands together
3174000	3176000	and
3176000	3178000	historically every 400 years
3178000	3180000	society
3180000	3182000	shifts and what do I mean by
3182000	3184000	society shifts something new
3184000	3186000	comes up for society to be
3186000	3188000	a part of ok
3188000	3190000	so before capitalism
3190000	3192000	which is when global
3192000	3194000	economics became a thing ok
3194000	3196000	like kinda the industrial revolution
3196000	3198000	global economics there was
3198000	3200000	region locked capitalism
3200000	3202000	ok and it's called feudalism
3202000	3204000	or something like that it's like
3204000	3206000	it's not feudalism it's like feudalism
3206000	3208000	ok
3208000	3210000	which was when
3210000	3212000	lords owned
3212000	3214000	the plots of land and permitted
3214000	3216000	peasants to generate food
3216000	3218000	on those lands ok
3218000	3220000	that was region locked capitalism
3220000	3222000	before we know capitalism today ok
3222000	3224000	but that got outdated when
3224000	3226000	the revolution came in
3226000	3228000	because you know
3228000	3230000	people learn fast to
3230000	3232000	grow certain crops and if you breed
3232000	3234000	crops I can't remember who did the crop breeding
3234000	3236000	what's his name
3236000	3238000	ah sugar I
3238000	3240000	forgotten feudalism
3240000	3242000	is with lords yes yes
3242000	3244000	the chickens are revolting
3244000	3246000	finally we agree on something
3246000	3248000	bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade
3248000	3250000	stuff changes all the time
3250000	3252000	but like another massive example
3252000	3254000	shift in society and you're not gonna like
3254000	3256000	some of yous are not gonna like this but
3256000	3258000	you're in for a rambling stream
3258000	3260000	you know you've got me for 12 hours as if
3260000	3262000	I'm not gonna get on my high horse and teach you history ok
3262000	3264000	if you
3264000	3266000	did not know
3266000	3268000	in Christianity
3268000	3270000	there's the old testament
3270000	3272000	and there's the new testament
3272000	3274000	the new testament
3274000	3276000	is was created
3276000	3278000	I believe in
3278000	3280000	roughly the 15th century
3280000	3282000	the church got together and went
3282000	3284000	look the old testament
3284000	3286000	isn't doing it for the masses
3286000	3288000	people are starting to question that
3288000	3290000	because people are becoming aware
3290000	3292000	that you know
3292000	3294000	some things aren't working out in the
3294000	3296000	story
3296000	3298000	and basically the new testament
3298000	3300000	is just
3300000	3302000	friggin made up
3302000	3304000	1500
3304000	3306000	years later after
3306000	3308000	Jebus the source supposedly
3308000	3310000	passed away
3310000	3312000	you're so right Strony let's eat the rich
3312000	3314000	yes! fun blue thank you for the two
3316000	3318000	like some people can't conceptualize
3318000	3320000	the difference between a million and a billion
3320000	3322000	dollars
3322000	3324000	now take that million and add one
3324000	3326000	and then add one and then add one
3326000	3328000	and then add one and keep going and keep going
3328000	3330000	and keep going and keep going
3330000	3332000	anyway
3332000	3334000	casually red fill in the masses
3334000	3336000	I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning
3336000	3338000	in the game
3338000	3340000	needy streamer overload I cannot even believe
3340000	3342000	they put that in the game that kind of thing
3342000	3344000	okay
3344000	3346000	but anyway
3346000	3348000	anyway that's just me
3348000	3350000	I don't know what you guys are thinking
3350000	3352000	but that's just me
3352000	3354000	but I could really get on my high horse
3354000	3356000	I should actually I want to do an education stream
3356000	3358000	about feudalism because
3358000	3360000	and like kind of
3360000	3362000	how history and how society used to work
3362000	3364000	because bargaining used to be how it was
3364000	3366000	done! bargaining used to be like
3366000	3368000	hey I have
3368000	3370000	two weeks would you
3370000	3372000	trade me one potato for two weeks
3372000	3374000	that's how it used to be done
3374000	3376000	that's how there was value in things
3376000	3378000	that's how humans did it
3378000	3380000	and and freaking
3380000	3382000	there are
3382000	3384000	there are some examples today
3384000	3386000	of it kind of thriving
3386000	3388000	and
3388000	3390000	so runescape is historically
3390000	3392000	accurate yes! you guys
3392000	3394000	trading me right now
3394000	3396000	you are calling upon your ancestors
3396000	3398000	to give me the resources that you don't
3398000	3400000	need in the moment you are looking
3400000	3402000	after me and in return
3402000	3404000	I will scratch your back later
3404000	3406000	it's literally why I'm such a big believer
3406000	3408000	and you scratch my back I scratch yours
3408000	3410000	because that's how it used to be
3410000	3412000	return to monkey
3412000	3414000	replays return to monkey
3414000	3416000	we were so nice

3420000	3422000	it's so nice
3422000	3424000	the old test schools
3424000	3426000	oh right okay you're done
3426000	3428000	out of curiosity

3438000	3440000	can track your things
3440000	3442000	there are good bad examples of this
3442000	3444000	one stick is weak
3444000	3446000	many together are strong
3446000	3448000	like the 1940s

3690000	3692000	aww but I couldn't say that
3692000	3694000	when I was playing Assassin's Creed
3694000	3696000	Brotherhood someone did a
3696000	3698000	text post and it was like
3698000	3700000	be me pic related 1500

3736000	3738000	I'm sorry

3792000	3794000	I didn't want to alienate anyone
3794000	3796000	if they can't do members at the moment
3796000	3798000	and we're not cooking
3798000	3800000	wait a minute

3818000	3820000	another reflin
3820000	3822000	gave me 10,000 friggin sword fish
3822000	3824000	I don't know how long it's going to take to get through that
3824000	3826000	I don't know if that might actually take us
3826000	3828000	to the end of the
3828000	3830000	stream
3830000	3832000	10,000 fish
3832000	3834000	since a lot
3834000	3836000	you betrayed Gimli I know
3836000	3838000	you don't know French
3838000	3840000	I've been lied to

3842000	3844000	I can't
3844000	3846000	I can't do it
3846000	3848000	I can humorously do
3848000	3850000	what are you doing today
3850000	3852000	what are you doing
3852000	3854000	what are you doing
3854000	3856000	I can do French
3856000	3858000	Scottish
3858000	3860000	just to mess with you
3860000	3862000	but the actual French
3862000	3864000	speaking
3864000	3866000	like
3868000	3870000	I'm trying to think of a sense
3870000	3872000	to say
3872000	3874000	Montichons
3874000	3876000	Machichons
3876000	3878000	I think is French for my
3878000	3880000	Yiddies
3880000	3882000	oh my brain
3882000	3884000	my brain can't parley the French right now
3884000	3886000	it's too hard
3886000	3888000	my roommate that showed me
3888000	3890000	your content just DM'd me that
3890000	3892000	because of that super chat
3892000	3894000	they're like I know
3894000	3896000	what you are
3896000	3898000	oh Gimli
3898000	3900000	I can't have you in the room
3900000	3902000	she's just gonna
3902000	3904000	go back to sleep
3904000	3906000	I was playing with my
3906000	3908000	cats before a live stream
3908000	3910000	to tire them out
3910000	3912000	but I couldn't play with her too long
3912000	3914000	so she's currently going nuts right now
3914000	3916000	but she'll go down for a sleep because she wasn't sleeping
3916000	3918000	when I was sleeping so she'll
3918000	3920000	don't worry, don't worry about my pooders
3920000	3922000	and whenever I go make a tea in that
3922000	3924000	I'll go give her some attention
3924000	3926000	baby boy is really independent
3926000	3928000	though he's like not
3928000	3930000	caring I don't know if it's because he's half
3930000	3932000	a munchkin that he's more
3932000	3934000	tired than the usual cat
3934000	3936000	you can get depending on the breed of your cat
3936000	3938000	it can be really tired in general
3938000	3940000	and need like more sleep
3940000	3942000	I'm pretty sure there's a type
3942000	3944000	of dog that's known for sleeping
3944000	3946000	oh wait it's Greyhounds
3946000	3948000	Greyhounds are like the laziest
3948000	3950000	dog ever but they can do like
3950000	3952000	one burst sprint type thing
3954000	3956000	21 million
3956000	3958000	literally I got sugar daddy
3958000	3960000	out the wazoo because of reeflings
3960000	3962000	they were throwing them coins
3962000	3964000	to me I was like I'm not gonna say
3964000	3966000	no this is gonna fund the
3966000	3968000	I don't know if we're doing wine
3968000	3970000	I don't know if wine is the fastest
3970000	3972000	level up once I've
3972000	3974000	like cooked everything
3974000	3976000	if I push it I can finish
3976000	3978000	my first save file in November
3978000	3980000	oh I haven't even finished a save file
3980000	3982000	I was considering doing some eating runs
3982000	3984000	just to show you guys what
3984000	3986000	the binding of Isaac
3986000	3988000	is all about
3988000	3990000	who needs a bot farm
3990000	3992000	when you have a cult giving you everything
3992000	3994000	you need literally though
3996000	3998000	when I had a Saint Bernard
3998000	4000000	it felt like it slept for 20 hours a day
4000000	4002000	yeah like depending on the breed
4002000	4004000	but she's just moody
4004000	4006000	I fed her and I played with her
4006000	4008000	mouse but
4008000	4010000	the problem is because I let her
4010000	4012000	in yesterday
4012000	4014000	she now thinks she can come in whenever she wants
4016000	4018000	you're a bit of a diva
4018000	4020000	Gimli you're a bit of a diva
4020000	4022000	I have to admit
4022000	4024000	but I love her
4024000	4026000	I love her
4026000	4028000	you're always cooking
4028000	4030000	oh I ain't just cooking a runescape
4032000	4034000	I can't
4034000	4036000	tomorrow's crash bandicoot
4038000	4040000	yes
4040000	4042000	I think
4042000	4044000	July streams
4044000	4046000	I'm gonna focus on Xbox games
4046000	4048000	to get my gamer score up
4048000	4050000	I've done
4050000	4052000	decent progress on my goal
4052000	4054000	of collabing with 100 vtubers
4054000	4056000	with a 3d old thing
4056000	4058000	like 3 ASMR collabs
4058000	4060000	I have absolutely no issue
4060000	4062000	with actually collabing on stream
4062000	4064000	yeah good luck with that
4064000	4066000	I'm too shy
4066000	4068000	I've made great progress
4068000	4070000	I think I'm just shy of
4070000	4072000	6 ASMR collabs
4076000	4078000	and then I need to reach out
4078000	4080000	and do
4084000	4086000	I want to make all of my goals
4086000	4088000	happen before the one year mark
4088000	4090000	which means I have to work hard now
4090000	4092000	and
4092000	4094000	so
4094000	4096000	and
4096000	4098000	we've got membership coming up as well
4098000	4100000	because we've got a lot of lost time
4100000	4102000	to make up for but I hope
4102000	4104000	you can see with my efforts
4104000	4106000	and all my hard work there
4106000	4108000	I'm making up for lost time
4108000	4110000	it's going good
4110000	4112000	I want content out the wazoo
4112000	4114000	I want it to be
4114000	4116000	good funny times
4116000	4118000	literally uploaded that meme ASMR
4118000	4120000	please let me hold it
4120000	4122000	any plans for halo?
4122000	4124000	yes I would love if I could actually
4124000	4126000	do
4126000	4128000	a vtuber collab on halo
4128000	4130000	but I don't know
4130000	4132000	anyone who's played halo
4132000	4134000	I will ask the vlo girls
4134000	4136000	first before I ask around
4136000	4138000	and see if anyone's played halo
4140000	4142000	not that you need to be
4142000	4144000	good at halo
4144000	4146000	to play it like you need to know about it
4146000	4148000	but I'd rather
4148000	4150000	I think if you're playing a nostalgic game
4150000	4152000	I'd rather like two people who are
4152000	4154000	familiar with it play
4154000	4156000	I know that sounds really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude
4156000	4158000	but I mean
4158000	4160000	I'm sure there's another halo vtuber
4160000	4162000	that's freaking good
4162000	4164000	random question are you playing any drg streams?
4164000	4166000	what?

4258000	4260000	like nothing on earth
4260000	4262000	like I wake up on the other side of the ramble
4262000	4264000	and we're literally 58
4264000	4266000	that's fantastic
4266000	4268000	oh my goodness

4278000	4280000	why would you
4280000	4282000	why would you play the game and be like
4282000	4284000	uh I'm not gonna do that ending
4284000	4286000	no the whole point is to like
4286000	4288000	be fine with human curiosity
4288000	4290000	like as long as you don't produce any offspring
4290000	4292000	no one gives a rat
4292000	4294000	anyone geyser
4294000	4296000	honestly
4298000	4300000	hmm
4300000	4302000	halo would be a fun way to do community games
4302000	4304000	uh like the halo molly player
4304000	4306000	I never actually played much of it
4306000	4308000	I heard
4308000	4310000	the bat
4310000	4312000	was it a halo battle pass came out
4312000	4314000	and it was just an absolute shambles
4314000	4316000	like it was just a terrible multiplayer
4316000	4318000	launch
4318000	4320000	and then they did battle pass
4320000	4322000	and then it just became
4322000	4324000	like this terrible
4324000	4326000	thing I don't know

4516000	4518000	market has been absolutely fantastic
4518000	4520000	to work with um
4520000	4522000	they are super good
4522000	4524000	I am aware that
4524000	4526000	they got a bit of flat because of some production issues
4526000	4528000	but they actually
4528000	4530000	moved um
4530000	4532000	they moved locations
4532000	4534000	quite a few times because their business
4534000	4536000	expanded so fast that they basically
4536000	4538000	had growing pains but I
4538000	4540000	have never personally had an issue with them
4540000	4542000	now I know that's kind of being like
4542000	4544000	well you never had an issue with others that's
4544000	4546000	just dismissing the others relax
4546000	4548000	I understand how it works but
4548000	4550000	um to work with oobu market
4550000	4552000	they've been they were so understanding from
4552000	4554000	the get go because I messaged them
4554000	4556000	and I'm like hey violers
4556000	4558000	the thing I'd love it if the girls can
4558000	4560000	keep a hundred percent of the earnings
4560000	4562000	uh we as the company
4562000	4564000	don't want to take a cut and they're like yeah
4564000	4566000	we can set that up no problem and I was
4566000	4568000	like here here's all the references to the artwork
4568000	4570000	yeah we can do that no problem
4570000	4572000	um and just they've handled
4572000	4574000	everything and it has been
4574000	4576000	really nice to not have
4576000	4578000	to deal with anything it makes things
4578000	4580000	nice and juicy and easy
4580000	4582000	um
4582000	4584000	uh one of the thing
4584000	4586000	few things about violers the lack of
4586000	4588000	corporation greed yeah I just
4588000	4590000	I I mean
4590000	4592000	scrawny scrawny can your
4592000	4594000	patterns go in reverse
4594000	4596000	no they can't they can
4596000	4598000	they only go in reverse if I
4598000	4600000	do that it'll like
4600000	4602000	should yeah see how it goes in reverse
4602000	4604000	it's because it has to reset
4604000	4606000	to the top of my head in order
4606000	4608000	to do that reverse thing
4608000	4610000	we can test that again
4610000	4612000	yeah see how it reverses to the top of my head
4612000	4614000	that's to make sure it works thank you for the
4614000	4616000	ten barrel you know you could
4616000	4618000	ask that for free uh you
4618000	4620000	guys don't have to ask questions
4620000	4622000	via um

4624000	4626000	it's not necessary

4628000	4630000	ask questions via money you're more than welcome
4630000	4632000	to ask in chat or on marshmallow

4638000	4640000	a very strong believer
4640000	4642000	in um the girls
4642000	4644000	earned the money they get to keep the lines
4644000	4646000	share um
4646000	4648000	because I don't
4648000	4650000	I don't think it's very nice
4650000	4652000	if the girls were only
4652000	4654000	earning like the standard 50-50
4654000	4656000	rate like what's your motivation
4656000	4658000	to work if every time you make
4658000	4660000	100 bucks uh management
4660000	4662000	take 50 for doing a fall

4998000	5000000	scottish lad
5000000	5002000	killets are always the first thing
5002000	5004000	folk hone in on but
5004000	5006000	you only wear killets during
5006000	5008000	special events like weddings are
5008000	5010000	probably the biggest kill thing
5010000	5012000	is gimme inside my door
5012000	5014000	gimme inside my door
5014000	5016000	but yeah

5018000	5020000	kilt in elden ring
5020000	5022000	so
5022000	5024000	so then you guys can show up in a kilt
5024000	5026000	and we can all get married in elden ring together
5028000	5030000	that would be cute you know you're not
5030000	5032000	supposed to wear boxers under a kilt either
5034000	5036000	easy access
5036000	5038000	easy access
5038000	5040000	gimme I'm pretty sure gimme's going nuts
5040000	5042000	outside my room right now I'm so sorry
5042000	5044000	you can hear him yelling
5044000	5046000	she gets attention
5046000	5048000	I promise
5048000	5050000	baby boy and baby girl get attention
5054000	5056000	we're already
5056000	5058000	at the 10.3
5058000	5060000	we started at 10.5
5064000	5066000	strongy shows up in elden ring like a blue
5066000	5068000	power ranger I'm
5068000	5070000	scottish
5070000	5072000	like that dress from ds
5072000	5074000	worm it's for the ventilation
5074000	5076000	literally you cannot
5076000	5078000	get swamp ass via a kilt
5078000	5080000	congrats
5080000	5082000	um but
5082000	5084000	your tatty bojangles
5084000	5086000	will be bojangling I think
5086000	5088000	I don't know how elastic
5088000	5090000	yeah okay gimme lays me
5090000	5092000	on out my door I can hear her go nuts
5092000	5094000	she might start hammering on the door
5094000	5096000	because she opens him by
5096000	5098000	going up on her back legs and like pushing
5098000	5100000	with her front paws so if you start hearing
5100000	5102000	like that's her
5102000	5104000	currently like opening the
5104000	5106000	well attempting to open the door
5106000	5108000	but I think
5108000	5110000	you need to listen to this song
5110000	5112000	donal where are your truzers
5112000	5114000	it's a joke song about kilt I'd play it
5114000	5116000	but I'd probably get copyright
5116000	5118000	ridiculous oh my
5118000	5120000	burn rate is 9%
5120000	5122000	well hopefully that can get lowered
5122000	5124000	because missing out on 10%
5124000	5126000	xp on full inventories
5126000	5128000	is rough
5128000	5130000	is rough
5130000	5132000	but we're getting there
5132000	5134000	so how do I use it on the thing
5134000	5136000	ta da
5136000	5138000	let the boys be free
5138000	5140000	as nature intended
5140000	5142000	true yes
5142000	5144000	I love wearing a kill always makes me feel confident
5144000	5146000	I remember that one scene from the carry on
5146000	5148000	films where the scott shows their
5148000	5150000	to scare
5150000	5152000	to scare people
5152000	5154000	I'm sure it probably
5154000	5156000	like get it up here
5156000	5158000	I got the skirt
5164000	5166000	18,000
5166000	5168000	to climb a level
5168000	5170000	we're starting to get there
5170000	5172000	where it's taking
5172000	5174000	a wee minute
5174000	5176000	but that's okay
5176000	5178000	we've got lots of time
5178000	5180000	we've got all the time in the world
5180000	5182000	but yes

5258000	5260000	like bottles of water every hour
5260000	5262000	but I don't go to the toilet
5262000	5264000	like it was their thing
5264000	5266000	like they wanted me to be like
5266000	5268000	ah I'm so full

5278000	5280000	carry out with such a request
5280000	5282000	however it was rather
5282000	5284000	interesting learning about that because that was the first time I had ever been exposed to it

5622000	5624000	swordfish which was which was not
5624000	5626000	cheap at all not cheap at all
5626000	5628000	we are currently cooking through that
5628000	5630000	and I am ranting and
5630000	5632000	raving my head off
5632000	5634000	just about anything
5634000	5636000	and everything
5636000	5638000	but yes I was currently
5638000	5640000	gushing about the girls doing hand cam
5640000	5642000	streams now that she
5642000	5644000	is monetized I actually don't know when
5644000	5646000	she's doing her monetization stream
5646000	5648000	hold on let me just
5648000	5650000	let me just ask her
5650000	5652000	when are you
5652000	5654000	doing monetization stream
5654000	5656000	cause I might need to put her monetization live
5656000	5658000	um
5658000	5660000	oops cause I've not put her monetization live
5660000	5662000	um
5662000	5664000	and before you're like wait you control monetization
5664000	5666000	no in order for the girls
5666000	5668000	to be less stressed I do
5668000	5670000	the kind of boring stuff
5670000	5672000	which is opening up memberships and setting
5672000	5674000	the price and adding her emotes
5674000	5676000	to her badges for example
5676000	5678000	um hey fart head
5678000	5680000	hey shit
5680000	5682000	sorry um
5682000	5684000	yes so if she
5684000	5686000	be plans on doing it
5686000	5688000	day I will have to quickly run away
5688000	5690000	for 5 minutes and quickly set that up
5690000	5692000	because I don't have access to her account
5692000	5694000	on the cc
5694000	5696000	your cash is 20 times the cost of that
5696000	5698000	swordfish though I know but I didn't do
5698000	5700000	anything for the cash or the swordfish
5700000	5702000	I just came I just got here
5702000	5704000	um
5704000	5706000	wow level 60
5706000	5708000	wow
5708000	5710000	that's amazing
5710000	5712000	frickin 60
5712000	5714000	how many are we burn
5714000	5716000	or burn percentage is going up
5716000	5718000	oh cause I know swordfish is a bit harder
5718000	5720000	than what was cooked
5720000	5722000	we are still doing
5722000	5724000	1000 an hour
5724000	5726000	it is possible I will beat
5726000	5728000	the swordfish stack before
5728000	5730000	um
5730000	5732000	um
5732000	5734000	just saying the chat that
5734000	5736000	gave you the JP is 20 times
5736000	5738000	killer than me
5738000	5740000	um
5740000	5742000	yeah basic management stuff
5742000	5744000	um
5744000	5746000	yes
5746000	5748000	I'm putting their stuff live
5748000	5750000	probably after the stream
5750000	5752000	um because I need it to go up
5752000	5754000	24 hours because
5754000	5756000	so youtube says they need to approve the membership
5756000	5758000	tiers but they don't approve
5758000	5760000	nothing they literally
5760000	5762000	um can go for it
5762000	5764000	level 99 by the end of the stream
5764000	5766000	trust just doing endurance stream right after
5766000	5768000	closing the endurance stream honestly
5768000	5770000	uh
5770000	5772000	I could never do this
5772000	5774000	I'm just giving it a shot it's always been a childhood
5774000	5776000	dream of kind of like
5776000	5778000	reaching 99 in any level
5778000	5780000	as you can see we haven't even touched
5780000	5782000	any of the member skills
5782000	5784000	but um
5784000	5786000	my combat is so low
5786000	5788000	but literally having it up here
5788000	5790000	is really nice um
5790000	5792000	and I picked cooking because
5792000	5794000	um I have incredibly
5794000	5796000	baby memories
5796000	5798000	of me being outside
5798000	5800000	the back of lumbridge castle
5800000	5802000	and I had
5802000	5804000	my pickaxe
5804000	5806000	I had my tinder box I had my
5806000	5808000	my little basic bronze
5808000	5810000	sword and I used
5810000	5812000	to um kill the big
5812000	5814000	rats outside the back of the castle
5814000	5816000	cook them and I think
5816000	5818000	the highest cooking level I ever got
5818000	5820000	was 40 as a child
5820000	5822000	um which is
5822000	5824000	just freaking adorable which is
5824000	5826000	why I want cooking 99
5826000	5828000	first because I've just enjoyed it
5828000	5830000	literally these gender norms have hands
5830000	5832000	of course the whamen picks cooking
5832000	5834000	oh we're about to get to 9000
5834000	5836000	the stack is getting
5836000	5838000	weir it's getting smaller
5838000	5840000	getting a wee wee stack
5840000	5842000	burnt swordfish is probably
5842000	5844000	worth more than cooked on the open market
5844000	5846000	these burnt food collectors are pretty
5846000	5848000	oh I'm aware about the burnt food
5848000	5850000	collectors um
5850000	5852000	and they just give you a price for it
5852000	5854000	which is pretty crazy
5854000	5856000	um fire making is
5856000	5858000	probably the next fast this is
5858000	5860000	winter tod yes
5860000	5862000	that was a ghost fires in winter tod
5862000	5864000	or am I making that up
5864000	5866000	I might be making that up
5866000	5868000	I'm gonna be honest
5868000	5870000	I might be going crazy
5870000	5872000	uh my current level
5872000	5874000	is 60 on the dot
5874000	5876000	I did title the stream
5876000	5878000	70 question mark
5878000	5880000	but someone did napkin math
5880000	5882000	and said if I finish cooking all these
5882000	5884000	swordfish I might be
5884000	5886000	78 which is just
5886000	5888000	fantastic truly
5888000	5890000	um
5890000	5892000	but I thought the cooking
5892000	5894000	thing was a meta meme like mommy knows
5894000	5896000	how to cook here is the proof
5896000	5898000	I mean honestly we could do it that way as well
5898000	5900000	but I kinda did it as like oh these gender
5900000	5902000	norms have hands I just really enjoy cooking
5902000	5904000	like I know there's
5904000	5906000	this in real life runescape chick
5906000	5908000	and she has massive knockers
5908000	5910000	I'm talking a zero level knockers
5910000	5912000	and I used to just sit and watch her cook
5912000	5914000	lobsters
5914000	5916000	and like so many people would come in the chat
5916000	5918000	and say such horrendous things
5918000	5920000	when would it be the best food for winter tod
5920000	5922000	so we keep
5922000	5924000	oh gimli give it a rest
5924000	5926000	darling I cannae have you in the room
5926000	5928000	she's
5928000	5930000	she's losing it
5930000	5932000	she's losing it I don't know if it's coming up in the
5932000	5934000	microphone or not but she's losing it
5934000	5936000	and this is
5936000	5938000	I shouldn't have let her in because now it's gonna take
5938000	5940000	a couple of days for her to unlearn that she's
5940000	5942000	allowed in this room
5942000	5944000	ah gimli I can't hear her
5944000	5946000	okay she's currently behind the door going
5946000	5948000	meh
5948000	5950000	basically
5950000	5952000	um
5952000	5954000	she should have given up by now
5954000	5956000	and it's been
5956000	5958000	it's been quite a while
5958000	5960000	she should have gone to sleep I'm gonna be
5960000	5962000	honest
5962000	5964000	I should have played with her more
5964000	5966000	I thought I ran out of time because I was making a cup
5966000	5968000	of tea but I did feed her and
5968000	5970000	I threw the mouse a few times to give her a few laps
5970000	5972000	around through her dog
5972000	5974000	she's not a dog she's a cat
5976000	5978000	heaven forbid some tatas
5978000	5980000	admit it we're all gimli

5994000	5996000	oh baby boy and I was petting him

6008000	6010000	between them
6010000	6012000	between us

6030000	6032000	but she's got the
6032000	6034000	she got that dog you know
6034000	6036000	real cat girl is someone from
6036000	6038000	Gimli when I was actually
6038000	6040000	gonna do an in real life
6040000	6042000	video where I put
6042000	6044000	um
6044000	6046000	a licky lick on the 3d o ears
6046000	6048000	and then both my cats will lick it
6048000	6050000	I don't know if YouTube will be weird
6050000	6052000	about it because I
6052000	6054000	don't know what's going on with your lickin in YouTube
6054000	6056000	right now it's absolutely terrifying
6056000	6058000	um
6058000	6060000	I don't
6060000	6062000	oh I keep messing that up
6062000	6064000	sorry oh my god I'm not
6064000	6066000	time maxing okay she's now knocking on the door
6066000	6068000	Gimli
6068000	6070000	don't do that
6072000	6074000	ah
6074000	6076000	mommy's no impressed Gimli didn't he do that
6076000	6078000	he didn't have litter in yesterday
6078000	6080000	it opened a can of worms
6080000	6082000	oh
6084000	6086000	um but yeah I thought
6086000	6088000	can we see them the next hand cam
6088000	6090000	you saw Gimli's back
6090000	6092000	in the food
6092000	6094000	in the celebration stream near the end of it
6094000	6096000	you saw Gimli come in the room but had to take her out
6096000	6098000	she was gonna knock over the webcam
6098000	6100000	um I do have a picture of them
6100000	6102000	um
6102000	6104000	they killed a rat
6104000	6106000	um so I thought
6106000	6108000	Gimli was the hunter but no
6108000	6110000	uh Vigo was the hunter
6110000	6112000	he caught a rat
6112000	6114000	in the garden I didn't even
6114000	6116000	know it was there
6116000	6118000	and he destroyed it
6118000	6120000	so quickly
6120000	6122000	um I'm pretty sure he like
6122000	6124000	so if he didn't know
6124000	6126000	the way that cats hunt
6126000	6128000	is they apply pressure on the throat
6128000	6130000	of the prey
6130000	6132000	so basically
6132000	6134000	it gets either suffocated
6134000	6136000	or you know damaged
6136000	6138000	out which is a shame to say
6138000	6140000	Vigo
6140000	6142000	I let him out in the garden
6142000	6144000	and within 10 seconds
6144000	6146000	he had perished
6146000	6148000	the the rat
6148000	6150000	I didn't I have a picture of it I'll maybe post it
6150000	6152000	but I know people don't like seeing dead animals
6152000	6154000	so maybe it's not too nice
6154000	6156000	maybe I'll put like a little black bar
6156000	6158000	over the rat's eyes just to
6158000	6160000	protect its identity you know
6160000	6162000	and it respect its wee family
6162000	6164000	um
6164000	6166000	damn though put it in me base
6166000	6168000	cat almost
6168000	6170000	stalks you honestly
6170000	6172000	um
6174000	6176000	wait cat almost stalks me
6176000	6178000	are you that fucking fanny
6178000	6180000	honestly if you are go and just leave me alone
6180000	6182000	um
6182000	6184000	but yeah we
6184000	6186000	uh
6186000	6188000	we Gimli we Vigo
6188000	6190000	um
6190000	6192000	is there somewhere we can
6192000	6194000	send cat pics I mean you can just
6194000	6196000	at me
6196000	6198000	it's fine on twitter
6198000	6200000	uh
6200000	6202000	honestly honestly
6206000	6208000	my cat is being a menace to the local bird
6208000	6210000	population it's illegal
6210000	6212000	to let your cats outside
6212000	6214000	in Australia or
6214000	6216000	I don't know if it's just in
6216000	6218000	Victoria but it's illegal
6218000	6220000	to let them out
6220000	6222000	so I have a caged off
6222000	6224000	background
6224000	6226000	which is such a shame but I'd rather
6226000	6228000	they get outside time than know outside time
6228000	6230000	at all because I actually don't think it's natural
6230000	6232000	for cats to be inside
6232000	6234000	um
6234000	6236000	but yeah they made it illegal
6238000	6240000	um
6240000	6242000	Australia does have a wild cat problem
6242000	6244000	oh my god it's so sad I wish I didn't
6244000	6246000	learn about it but they basically
6246000	6248000	call wild cats instead of just
6248000	6250000	doing capture and release because it's
6250000	6252000	like so out of control type thing
6252000	6254000	and I'm like
6254000	6256000	bruh bruh
6256000	6258000	although it's kind of like learning
6258000	6260000	about cat island in Japan
6260000	6262000	there's a tourist state island
6262000	6264000	called cat island but the problem
6264000	6266000	is none of the cats are
6266000	6268000	fled or looked after or new urge so the
6268000	6270000	population is completely out of control
6270000	6272000	oh my god Gimli
6272000	6274000	she's
6274000	6276000	doing my head and
6276000	6278000	oh my
6278000	6280000	god
6280000	6282000	Gimli
6282000	6284000	I know you guys might not be able to
6284000	6286000	hear her she's going to absolutely
6286000	6288000	desert right now she should have given up
6288000	6290000	like a long time ago and gone back to sleep
6290000	6292000	what have I done I've created a monster
6292000	6294000	because nobody wants to see
6294000	6296000	mushroom no more he's chopped live
6296000	6298000	I don't know the rest of the words
6298000	6300000	I'm back
6300000	6302000	baby
6304000	6306000	um
6306000	6308000	oh my god I can't think when she's
6308000	6310000	me on wait hold on
6312000	6314000	right she be I don't need to
6314000	6316000	do her monetization
6322000	6324000	okay I don't need to worry about sheepsters
6324000	6326000	but I will be putting
6326000	6328000	me and AC's thing
6328000	6330000	live
6330000	6332000	praying that a speller member names right
6332000	6334000	but I'm pretty sure it's
6334000	6336000	snow bear ease
6336000	6338000	and
6338000	6340000	pin pals
6340000	6342000	snippets to me and
6342000	6344000	moose
6344000	6346000	should have picked any kind of youtube
6346000	6348000	to be further driving the birds
6348000	6350000	extinct yes I just think
6350000	6352000	it's very dramatic
6352000	6354000	to not only cast it
6354000	6356000	you've been telling me I've been breaking the law for the past
6356000	6358000	23 years and didn't know
6358000	6360000	yeah like apparently it's gonna slow and
6360000	6362000	England just made it that your cat has
6362000	6364000	to get microchipped now
6364000	6366000	and I'm like interesting
6366000	6368000	but what's
6368000	6370000	the real reason behind that because
6370000	6372000	is it just like another tax on pet
6372000	6374000	owners
6374000	6376000	oh if you're a pet owner and you need
6376000	6378000	to use litter by the way like a litter box
6378000	6380000	you know how it's really
6380000	6382000	expensive for litter box
6382000	6384000	like pellets and all that
6384000	6386000	play sand
6386000	6388000	cats love to take big massive dookies
6388000	6390000	in play sand which is the cheapest thing
6390000	6392000	ever it lasts so long
6392000	6394000	especially if you can have an
6394000	6396000	outside litter tree for them if they have
6396000	6398000	access to outside
6398000	6400000	you will save literally hundreds
6400000	6402000	upon thousands of dollars over
6402000	6404000	the years
6404000	6406000	it costs 8 dollars
6406000	6408000	for a bag of sand and it costs
6408000	6410000	20 for a decent cat grit
6410000	6412000	just give them sand
6412000	6414000	they love it you can scoop it
6414000	6416000	it's super good
6416000	6418000	and it saves your pockets
6418000	6420000	so much money because
6420000	6422000	there's such a tax on pet owners
6422000	6424000	the only thing I haven't figured out yet
6424000	6426000	is how to get good quality food
6426000	6428000	because
6428000	6430000	I was actually thinking
6430000	6432000	of making like homemade cat
6432000	6434000	the fire
6434000	6436000	is gone no
6436000	6438000	rifling what happened
6438000	6440000	wait let me pick up the ashes hold on
6440000	6442000	wait I can't I've got too much swordfish
6442000	6444000	wait hold on hold on
6444000	6446000	I'll pick up the ashes and take them out the way
6446000	6448000	I need to put them out the way ok
6448000	6450000	now the ashes are out the way
6450000	6452000	no the embers have went out
6452000	6454000	I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident
6456000	6458000	slim cuttles
6458000	6460000	or strong shady
6460000	6462000	excellent cuttle sounds better
6464000	6466000	always thought it would be cute to have a big
6466000	6468000	chunky cat
6468000	6470000	oh well thanks for the tip
6470000	6472000	I can't even remember what the tip was
6472000	6474000	thank you for putting the fire back on again rifling
6474000	6476000	it's over
6476000	6478000	they didn't kindle the fire
6478000	6480000	now it's the age of darkness
6480000	6482000	crazy concept
6482000	6484000	go fishin
6484000	6486000	the riflings would happily taste test
6486000	6488000	your homemade cat food yeah
6488000	6490000	I wanted to make homemade thank you for getting me back
6490000	6492000	on the subject because I completely forgot
6492000	6494000	what I was rambling about
6494000	6496000	I
6496000	6498000	wanted to make homemade cat food
6498000	6500000	because they were struggling to eat
6500000	6502000	like that pre-made stuff
6502000	6504000	and the thing
6504000	6506000	this sounds really bad
6506000	6508000	but on the boxes of cat food
6508000	6510000	it says not fit for human consumption
6510000	6512000	ok
6512000	6514000	now the reason why that
6514000	6516000	alarms me is because I would never
6516000	6518000	want to give my cat something that I couldn't
6518000	6520000	eat and cats eat meat cats are
6522000	6524000	wow 61
6524000	6526000	thank you
6526000	6528000	thank you riflings for funding my
6528000	6530000	cooking habit
6532000	6534000	yeah I just find it
6534000	6536000	a bit hmm
6536000	6538000	and sus
6538000	6540000	that
6540000	6542000	it's not fit for human consumption
6542000	6544000	when the content is just supposed to be meat
6544000	6546000	that's possible for
6546000	6548000	cats to eat
6548000	6550000	which I don't like
6550000	6552000	VV buys a rotisserie chicken
6552000	6554000	cats didn't like
6554000	6556000	I fed them it
6556000	6558000	you know who liked
6558000	6560000	more than my cats
6560000	6562000	the magpies
6562000	6564000	which I've yet to name
6564000	6566000	it's
6566000	6568000	a husband magpie
6568000	6570000	a wife magpie and a daughter magpie
6570000	6572000	that visits me
6572000	6574000	oh no
6576000	6578000	rifling
6578000	6580000	is the rifling afk that normally does
6580000	6582000	like the big log pile
6582000	6584000	wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on
6584000	6586000	there you go it's out of the way
6586000	6588000	I keep clicking collect

6604000	6606000	pet food in general
6606000	6608000	is a rarity
6608000	6610000	affordable
6610000	6612000	mmm it's like ridiculous pricing
6612000	6614000	as well like I'm not happy with the price as well
6614000	6616000	but I thought it would be really cute
6616000	6618000	to make like
6618000	6620000	homemade cat food for them
6620000	6622000	it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen
6622000	6624000	this youtube channel
6624000	6626000	I think it's called June's Kitchen
6626000	6628000	and it's literally dedicated
6628000	6630000	to feeding the cats
6630000	6632000	gourmet homemade food
6632000	6634000	and it's the most adorable thing ever
6634000	6636000	and I'm like that's what I want to do for V going in
6636000	6638000	cats are hyper carnivores
6638000	6640000	yes carnivores
6640000	6642000	I almost said omnivores

6856000	6858000	video I guess
6858000	6860000	okay
6860000	6862000	and then pick this one on my desktop please
6862000	6864000	is that it
6864000	6866000	this video
6866000	6868000	wow
6868000	6870000	what on earth
6870000	6872000	do you see that
6876000	6878000	holy
6878000	6880000	what on earth
6880000	6882000	that got pushed so much
6882000	6884000	look at browse feature
6884000	6886000	76 percent
6886000	6888000	browse feature my goodness
6888000	6890000	but look
6890000	6892000	it says I got 300 subscribers
6892000	6894000	for it the money hasn't
6894000	6896000	updated because it takes like 48 hours
6896000	6898000	for the money to show
6898000	6900000	wow I did not expect that
6900000	6902000	the fact
6902000	6904000	the watch time is 1.8k
6904000	6906000	hours if you didn't know to get monetized
6906000	6908000	you need 3k watch hours
6908000	6910000	holy crap
6910000	6912000	maybe
6912000	6914000	maybe gen 2 should come out with an ASMR
6914000	6916000	video before debut but kind of ruins the
6916000	6918000	voice although saying that you hear the voice
6918000	6920000	in the trailer in the shorts anyways
6920000	6922000	that much of a deal because it might help with the culling
6922000	6924000	if the girls came out with an ASMR video
6924000	6926000	for gen 2
6926000	6928000	nice when quality
6928000	6930000	is rewarded but look at that
6930000	6932000	a browse feature
6932000	6934000	source that's pretty
6934000	6936000	that's pretty nice
6936000	6938000	sorry my tummy is rumbling if you heard that
6940000	6942000	literally I've not even got my first thank
6942000	6944000	you for 1k out yet
6944000	6946000	oh
6946000	6948000	oh my god
6948000	6950000	yeah whoa
6950000	6952000	I'm 5800 I literally
6952000	6954000	tweeted like thanks for 5k yesterday
6954000	6956000	holy crap
6956000	6958000	that's insane
6958000	6960000	your trailer hooked me pretty hard
6960000	6962000	yeah you're like I'm Scott
6962000	6964000	oh yeah
6964000	6966000	oh cloud he's Scott
6966000	6968000	win win
6968000	6970000	well I wasn't lying during debut
6970000	6972000	and I was like you'll be eating good if you're an ASMR
6972000	6974000	enthusiast
6974000	6976000	it's unlikely
6976000	6978000	I'll get that first video out today
6978000	6980000	because
6980000	6982000	I'm doing AC and Emmys membership
6982000	6984000	when I get offline
6984000	6986000	and then I'm probably collapsing
6986000	6988000	unless although I will say it's really
6988000	6990000	fun editing my
6990000	6992000	thank you videos because
6992000	6994000	I'm like
6994000	6996000	I'm not making it super professional
6996000	6998000	and like editing out all the bumps I'm just
6998000	7000000	lowering the bumps in that so it's still
7000000	7002000	like on the same level
7002000	7004000	the culling was so silly
7004000	7006000	it was absolutely insane
7006000	7008000	on AC
7008000	7010000	I mentioned this yesterday so don't worry
7010000	7012000	if you didn't hear it but AC
7012000	7014000	got called
7014000	7016000	1500 subscribers and on the same
7016000	7018000	day I got called 700
7018000	7020000	subscribers even though
7020000	7022000	she had more shorts out like I was
7022000	7024000	pushing shorts on AC
7024000	7026000	at the time
7026000	7028000	that's just crazy
7028000	7030000	do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR?
7034000	7036000	it was so rough on AC
7036000	7038000	but she's been doing fantastic honestly
7040000	7042000	I
7042000	7044000	am
7044000	7046000	still interested in a clipper program
7046000	7048000	for the girls
7048000	7050000	I'm just waiting for
7050000	7052000	the first month of income to come in
7052000	7054000	and then I can kind of open up pie charts
7054000	7056000	and be like right is this
7056000	7058000	going to be possible
7058000	7060000	for Vehler to do a clipping program
7060000	7062000	like Idol N has done because I really
7062000	7064000	like it I think it's a really good way
7064000	7066000	to get clippers involved and
7066000	7068000	help promote the girls
7068000	7070000	and all that jazz I think it's fantastic
7070000	7072000	so we are still looking into that
7072000	7074000	and hopefully it will
7074000	7076000	give the girls a cheeky boost
7078000	7080000	I've had to re-sub
7080000	7082000	three times yeah like every really
7082000	7084000	I had to freaking subscribe back onto the girls
7084000	7086000	at one point as well I was like bruh
7086000	7088000	we were literally all each other's first subscribers
7088000	7090000	and I got booted off and I'm like great
7090000	7092000	you've stolen it from me
7092000	7094000	you too
7094000	7096000	absolutely stolen it
7098000	7100000	I hope those missing 1,500
7100000	7102000	would you sans find their way to her
7102000	7104000	honestly though
7104000	7106000	I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like
7106000	7108000	hey wasn't there a cute polar bear around here
7108000	7110000	at one point
7110000	7112000	if you interact with the content
7112000	7114000	leave a like on stream
7114000	7116000	or leave a comment
7116000	7118000	then the algorithm will show the girl
7118000	7120000	more to you
7120000	7122000	so if you are an OG
7122000	7124000	you're like her streams are never showing up
7124000	7126000	please do consider like
7126000	7128000	just going on her short feed
7128000	7130000	for example
7130000	7132000	don't like the stuff right away
7132000	7134000	genuinely sit and watch it because if you don't
7134000	7136000	sit and watch it then the algorithm
7136000	7138000	knows that you are just sitting there
7138000	7140000	it's really annoying
7140000	7142000	but the algorithm is now too
7142000	7144000	advanced
7144000	7146000	because before way back
7146000	7148000	and much older youtube days
7148000	7150000	if you left a like
7150000	7152000	you left a like
7152000	7154000	but now the algorithm is like
7154000	7156000	this person left a like at the 2 minute mark
7156000	7158000	maybe something interesting happened 2 minutes in
7158000	7160000	ok because of that statistic
7160000	7162000	we're going to now
7162000	7164000	promote this video to
7164000	7166000	people who
7166000	7168000	have interacted with this vtuber
7168000	7170000	the algorithm just gets so
7170000	7172000	silly
7172000	7174000	I'm dying for the hypnovis
7174000	7176000	the hypnovis
7176000	7178000	can actually go on youtube
7178000	7180000	youtube allows hypnosis
7180000	7182000	patreon doesn't
7182000	7184000	make it make sense
7184000	7186000	but we love youtube out here for that reason
7186000	7188000	it's very
7188000	7190000	strange
7190000	7192000	probably the first hit
7192000	7194000	sorry
7194000	7196000	take this burnt swordfish
7196000	7198000	the first
7198000	7200000	ASMR I'm going to do is
7200000	7202000	forget your name
7202000	7204000	and replace it with reefling
7206000	7208000	I will not make it a permanent
7208000	7210000	effect
7210000	7212000	I will make it a session
7212000	7214000	I think maybe a 30 minute session
7214000	7216000	if you will
7218000	7220000	and I'll maybe give it like 2 hour
7220000	7222000	effect I really do not want to
7222000	7224000	mess around with permanent effects too much
7224000	7226000	it kind of scares me permanent effect
7226000	7228000	stuff I have to be honest I'm a bit of a scaredy cat
7228000	7230000	ooh our burn percentage
7230000	7232000	is up to 15
7232000	7234000	I think it's holding
7234000	7236000	steady at 15 though
7236000	7238000	and hopefully it'll lower as we
7238000	7240000	get more leveled up
7242000	7244000	wait no hypnosis no
7244000	7246000	hypnosis is ban
7246000	7248000	it is a bannable
7248000	7250000	offense
7250000	7252000	suspendable offense if you will
7252000	7254000	there was
7254000	7256000	a ASMRist actually that got
7256000	7258000	their entire patreon taken down
7258000	7260000	not even a chance to
7262000	7264000	appeal or
7264000	7266000	get suspended and then delete the content
7266000	7268000	sometimes patreon will suspend
7268000	7270000	your account until you
7270000	7272000	your content
7272000	7274000	applies to their tos so if it's not
7274000	7276000	too offensive whatever you've done or made
7276000	7278000	but
7278000	7280000	there wasn't ASMRist recently who got their
7280000	7282000	entire thing just taken down which was
7282000	7284000	pretty crazy
7284000	7286000	just making me permanently less procrastinate
7288000	7290000	yeah honestly only a bit of mind break
7290000	7292000	I feel you
7292000	7294000	yeah a chubby
7294000	7296000	weight gain that got
7296000	7298000	taken away
7298000	7300000	which was crazy
7300000	7302000	absolutely crazy I'm not sure
7304000	7306000	I mean I
7306000	7308000	I can see
7308000	7310000	why because sometimes this stuff is
7310000	7312000	like tied down to a chair and funnel fed
7312000	7314000	or whatever but
7314000	7316000	it just gets ridiculous because whoever's
7316000	7318000	participating or creating especially
7318000	7320000	for when it comes to audio side of stuff
7320000	7322000	like no visuals no nothing
7322000	7324000	like it gets pretty ridiculous
7324000	7326000	like that you can't
7326000	7328000	do it like but anyway
7328000	7330000	all hail her master
7330000	7332000	card overlords yes yes
7332000	7334000	yes yes you win yeah again you win
7334000	7336000	you win again
7336000	7338000	hey ho you win again
7338000	7340000	um
7340000	7342000	who's thinking
7342000	7344000	up all these rules and restrictions are overlords
7344000	7346000	don't you not know about them
7346000	7348000	see there's this company called
7348000	7350000	black rock and then there's a second
7350000	7352000	company called I've forgotten the name of the
7352000	7354000	second company and they own everything
7354000	7356000	um
7356000	7358000	and uh oh wait until you
7358000	7360000	learn about politics oh my goodness
7360000	7362000	can't wait to get started about the
7362000	7364000	political side of thing and no I'm
7364000	7366000	not getting into politics but I'll get into
7366000	7368000	destroying the economy and
7368000	7370000	we should restart society
7370000	7372000	or run away to a farm together
7372000	7374000	I'm more opting for the farm
7374000	7376000	side of things um
7376000	7378000	because
7378000	7380000	yeah the farm would be a heck
7380000	7382000	of a lot better option
7384000	7386000	um
7386000	7388000	CNC is not okay with Patreon
7388000	7390000	which hit me yes the
7390000	7392000	oh 62
7392000	7394000	thank you 62
7394000	7396000	it's nice to see you 62
7396000	7398000	um
7398000	7400000	but yes um
7400000	7402000	so people
7402000	7404000	from an outside perspective think
7404000	7406000	hypnosis
7406000	7408000	um
7408000	7410000	you don't do anything you don't want to do when it comes
7410000	7412000	to hypnosis I am a full believer
7412000	7414000	in that I absolutely do not
7414000	7416000	think but because of the way
7416000	7418000	it seemed comedically in the public eye
7418000	7420000	like for example when
7420000	7422000	a magician does hypnosis
7422000	7424000	oh look they made this person
7424000	7426000	drink a bottle of vinegar
7426000	7428000	type thing um because
7428000	7430000	it's seen that way publicly when the
7430000	7432000	reality is when you participate
7432000	7434000	in an alternative context
7434000	7436000	you do not do anything you don't
7436000	7438000	want to do this is a fact
7438000	7440000	it's just how it works
7440000	7442000	you like people
7442000	7444000	seem to think like you completely just
7444000	7446000	like oh you're inhibitions
7446000	7448000	you can't control anything you're so
7448000	7450000	like no mother
7450000	7452000	that's not how it is
7454000	7456000	all reeflings pull together and put a money
7456000	7458000	in a oh should we buy
7458000	7460000	a castle
7460000	7462000	should we where should we
7462000	7464000	what country though I want
7464000	7466000	to say a castle in Scotland but um
7466000	7468000	it's very hard to although
7468000	7470000	saying that if we had a green
7470000	7472000	glass house a greenhouse
7472000	7474000	then we could have tons of
7474000	7476000	um produce
7476000	7478000	maybe we should get a castle in
7478000	7480000	Scotland
7480000	7482000	and then we can have a big garden
7482000	7484000	and we have like we feast on the meals
7484000	7486000	every night and we can try and make
7486000	7488000	me for the first time
7490000	7492000	black rock van garden
7494000	7496000	those are the names quick tooth
7496000	7498000	um squiddle kingdom
7498000	7500000	anyway if I can't get a span because I've started
7500000	7502000	talking about black rock it's been a good run
7502000	7504000	yeah make sure you support the girls
7504000	7506000	all hail our overlords
7506000	7508000	um
7508000	7510000	yes um
7510000	7512000	we can try and learn to make me
7512000	7514000	but I feel like I'd poison everyone
7514000	7516000	if I did it
7516000	7518000	oooh someone just leveled up
7518000	7520000	congrats
7520000	7522000	15.8
7522000	7524000	did that go off I thought it was 15.3
7524000	7526000	I was hoping it was going to go down
7526000	7528000	it was fun
7528000	7530000	it was fun while I lasted it was
7530000	7532000	let's go castle with a farm
7532000	7534000	could you imagine
7534000	7536000	we all have our little bedroom and stuff
7536000	7538000	and then when we need gen 2 to be made
7538000	7540000	we just turn the lights off
7540000	7542000	and see what happens
7542000	7544000	hehehe
7544000	7546000	mmm
7546000	7548000	I just want to say some things
7548000	7550000	but I refuse to say it
7550000	7552000	that might get you banned
7552000	7554000	shove it in my marshmallow then
7554000	7556000	show me what I want to see
7556000	7558000	mmm

7572000	7574000	and you guys can make me my special honey tea
7574000	7576000	see there's honey tea in general
7576000	7578000	and then there's special reefling honey tea
7578000	7580000	I need special reefling honey tea
7580000	7582000	because my throat is perishing and I'm sure it'll help
7582000	7584000	I could just fill a vitamins

7610000	7612000	mummy needs her special honey tea
7612000	7614000	although I should actually
7614000	7616000	write an audio like that holy crap
7616000	7618000	why have I not done that yet
7618000	7620000	I'll do it this month because there's a myth in there
7620000	7622000	oh I just really started really hard
7622000	7624000	I said myth in there if you hate that
7624000	7626000	oh my god there's a myth in audio this month
7626000	7628000	I'll make that plot
7628000	7630000	the audio this month please
7630000	7632000	can I make that the plot for a patreon this month
7632000	7634000	where I need my special honey tea
7636000	7638000	oh my god yes
7638000	7640000	I'm in February
7640000	7642000	I know February is so far away
7642000	7644000	but I actually have a meta audio role play
7644000	7646000	month as well
7646000	7648000	but yeah I'll make it my missing thing
7652000	7654000	I do want to care for a little garden
7654000	7656000	yes so
7656000	7658000	there's a lot of hardy plants
7658000	7660000	so hardy plants are considered plants that can
7660000	7662000	tolerate close to frost
7662000	7664000	or very low temperatures
7664000	7666000	these hardy plants
7666000	7668000	are things such as potatoes
7668000	7670000	leeks
7670000	7672000	these root vegetable type things
7672000	7674000	what's another root vegetable
7674000	7676000	turnip very big
7676000	7678000	neeps and tatties
7678000	7680000	is turnips and potatoes
7680000	7682000	these are very successful
7682000	7684000	hardy plants in Scotland
7684000	7686000	so these are probably what we'll focus on
7686000	7688000	and make up the main majority
7688000	7690000	berries
7690000	7692000	strawberries
7692000	7694000	and blackberries for example
7694000	7696000	these berries are actually
7696000	7698000	quite successful in Scotland
7698000	7700000	against all odds
7700000	7702000	because
7702000	7704000	they're quite resistant
7704000	7706000	which is really quite fascinating
7706000	7708000	there's a lot of
7708000	7710000	strawberry production and manufacturers
7710000	7712000	in Scotland if you didn't know that
7712000	7714000	a little fun factoid
7716000	7718000	potatoes
7718000	7720000	boil and mash them stick them in a stew
7720000	7722000	and we make a big dinner
7722000	7724000	and we have nice yummy dinners every night
7724000	7726000	a carrots
7726000	7728000	yes carrots
7728000	7730000	fantastic example a ground vegetable
7730000	7732000	yes yes yes
7734000	7736000	wow
7736000	7738000	9.4
7738000	7740000	about to hit 9.3
7740000	7742000	about to hit 8
7742000	7744000	we're getting so close
7744000	7746000	gollum would be fuming right now
7746000	7748000	leeks are a winter crop
7748000	7750000	yes
7750000	7752000	and we can also have garlic
7752000	7754000	we teach you about the drying process
7754000	7756000	of garlic as well
7756000	7758000	but we would need a shed for that
7758000	7760000	surely one of us reeflings
7760000	7762000	or DIY can make a shed
7762000	7764000	although oh my god
7764000	7766000	we're getting two steps away from being Amish
7766000	7768000	at this rate I'm not even being funny
7768000	7770000	because the Amish are known
7770000	7772000	for building stuff really fast
7774000	7776000	but I'm sure if all of us reeflings
7776000	7778000	came together on the castle farm
7778000	7780000	we could build a shed
7780000	7782000	we could teach you all about garlic
7784000	7786000	you need to dry out the garlic
7786000	7788000	because if it's wet it will rot
7788000	7790000	but if you dry it out successfully
7790000	7792000	the garlic will last an entire year
7792000	7794000	from harvest season to the next
7794000	7796000	it will last an entire year
7796000	7798000	absolutely fantastic
7798000	7800000	and we need to get massive freezers
7800000	7802000	to freeze all our produce
7802000	7804000	so we can do massive meal preparation as well
7804000	7806000	how big of a shed are we talking
7806000	7808000	it would need to be decent
7808000	7810000	I'm too scared to learn about canning food
7810000	7812000	because I've heard about
7812000	7814000	it literally perishes people
7814000	7816000	if you mess up the canning process
7816000	7818000	however there's one process
7818000	7820000	I really like and it's
7820000	7822000	D
7822000	7824000	dehydrated food
7824000	7826000	so you're left with the dry
7826000	7828000	husk of the food
7828000	7830000	basically but I trust that
7830000	7832000	and apparently that stuff
7832000	7834000	lasts 20 freaking years
7834000	7836000	if you put it away right
7836000	7838000	dehydrating food lasts 20 years
7838000	7840000	I'm like
7840000	7842000	oh my god
7842000	7844000	I'm like
7844000	7846000	this is just me being a weirdo
7846000	7848000	I absolutely love the idea
7848000	7850000	of a zombie apocalypse
7850000	7852000	don't get me wrong I will perish within the first few days
7852000	7854000	I will be bitten
7854000	7856000	I'm sorry I'll just admit it there's no way
7856000	7858000	I'm not that good
7858000	7860000	trust me I'm not that guy
7860000	7862000	but I really like the idea
7862000	7864000	of having food reserves
7864000	7866000	and like
7866000	7868000	I think they're called a bug out bag
7868000	7870000	yes a bug out bag
7872000	7874000	I freaking love the idea
7874000	7876000	of a bug out bag and all this
7876000	7878000	food that's good to go
7878000	7880000	is it MRE kits?
7880000	7882000	I wouldn't mind trying an MRE kit
7882000	7884000	taste testing stream that would be funny
7884000	7886000	like a hand cam MRE thing
7886000	7888000	that would be
7888000	7890000	curious and then we can
7890000	7892000	judge it from different places
7892000	7894000	apparently South Korea has the yummiest
7894000	7896000	MRE kits
7896000	7898000	America has neutral
7898000	7900000	I think UK is neutral
7900000	7902000	maybe France might have something better
7902000	7904000	MRE
7904000	7906000	clogs your intestines oh no
7906000	7908000	does it? I don't know
7908000	7910000	oh like space food just add water
7910000	7912000	yeah like space food
7912000	7914000	we can try space food as well when we try the MRE kits
7914000	7916000	rating MRE kits live cam
7916000	7918000	I just rate it
7918000	7920000	and then like say like a bunch of like
7920000	7922000	stereotypical stuff about the nation that I'm
7922000	7924000	waiting
7924000	7926000	my life wouldn't change
7926000	7928000	if a zombie apocalypse happens
7928000	7930000	just close in the house
7930000	7932000	if we're still in yeah I really
7932000	7934000	like the idea of dehydrating
7934000	7936000	food because it lasts
7936000	7938000	years which is just a
7938000	7940000	mind boggling thing to me like I absolutely
7940000	7942000	love the concept of it
7944000	7946000	I just find it so fascinating
7946000	7948000	that we could preserve food like
7948000	7950000	if you think of our ancestors
7950000	7952000	who had to live on a yearly crop
7952000	7954000	basis and like if your
7954000	7956000	crops were messed up you were in
7956000	7958000	trouble you had to find a trade quick
7958000	7960000	like if you were a lumberjack
7960000	7962000	and you cut wood or you sold
7962000	7964000	I don't know you sold yourself
7964000	7966000	but
7966000	7968000	that trade really didn't
7968000	7970000	still doing it today baby
7970000	7972000	keeping my ancestors proud
7972000	7974000	if they're
7974000	7976000	lumber probably
7976000	7978000	fire choppin probably
7978000	7980000	root harvesting like harvesting
7980000	7982000	mushrooms from a forest like if you knew
7982000	7984000	what ones didn't hurt you
7984000	7986000	it's like 4,800
7986000	7988000	calories shoved into a box I wouldn't be
7988000	7990000	surprised wait really maybe
7990000	7992000	I should eat our MREs
7992000	7994000	because I don't eat properly
7994000	7996000	recently I've been really
7996000	7998000	I don't know
7998000	8000000	reflin reflin reflin
8000000	8002000	do not tape
8002000	8004000	doom
8004000	8006000	do not tape doom
8006000	8008000	I will talk to you
8008000	8010000	openly and honestly
8010000	8012000	I've been struggling to eat a little
8012000	8014000	bit until things settle
8014000	8016000	down
8016000	8018000	I'm very happy to say my A-bomb
8018000	8020000	has calmed down
8020000	8022000	it has calmed down
8022000	8024000	it was preventing me from eating properly
8024000	8026000	basically
8026000	8028000	I could start eating
8028000	8030000	but then I got adrenaline burst
8030000	8032000	which stops me from eating
8032000	8034000	I'm not hungry when I get adrenaline burst
8034000	8036000	but I'm very thankful to say
8036000	8038000	it is subsiding
8038000	8040000	I've managed to eat a bit better recently
8040000	8042000	but no doom
8042000	8044000	no doom
8044000	8046000	okay
8046000	8048000	9.2
8048000	8050000	we're doing it
8050000	8052000	the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream
8052000	8054000	mark my words
8054000	8056000	you keep activating our worry mode which is why
8058000	8060000	what level are you now
8060000	8062000	level 62
8062000	8064000	62 which is fantastic
8064000	8066000	no doom here
8066000	8068000	we're only winning glad to hear you're eating
8068000	8070000	but yes and I think
8070000	8072000	because now the girls are getting monetized
8072000	8074000	I feel a lot of relief
8074000	8076000	a lot of
8076000	8078000	like all of it off my shoulders
8078000	8080000	because I was worried
8080000	8082000	that the designs that I had given
8082000	8084000	Shibi and Azura are going to prevent them
8084000	8086000	from earning money for a month
8086000	8088000	but it's not happening
8088000	8090000	I'm so happy to say it's not happening
8090000	8092000	because Shibi got monetized
8092000	8094000	which is absolutely fantastic
8094000	8096000	truly fantastic
8098000	8100000	I am very happy about that
8100000	8102000	please take care of yourself
8102000	8104000	yes I am doing fine
8104000	8106000	still feels like doom stop it
8106000	8108000	reflying stop it no doom
8108000	8110000	it was because I was so worried
8110000	8112000	about monetization
8112000	8114000	because the girls
8114000	8116000	um
8116000	8118000	I've kind of said it a lot of them
8118000	8120000	are wanting to move out
8120000	8122000	and I think it's
8122000	8124000	actually very possible
8124000	8126000	after the first month
8126000	8128000	but we needed youtube monetization
8128000	8130000	just to really elevate it
8130000	8132000	because and the thing
8132000	8134000	with youtube monetization as well
8134000	8136000	is that the vods can be
8136000	8138000	the vods
8138000	8140000	the streams like if someone watches back the stream
8140000	8142000	well the girls get
8142000	8144000	some of the money from the ads as well
8144000	8146000	so it's like generated free income
8146000	8148000	you do not have to actually physically
8148000	8150000	you know hand over money to the girls
8150000	8152000	because
8152000	8154000	you generate money for free
8154000	8156000	watching their asmr's
8156000	8158000	their asmr's are going to go up shortly
8158000	8160000	and I forgot to do mercies I'll need to give mercies her
8160000	8162000	so that's what I'm doing
8162000	8164000	I'll put emmy and aces membership live
8164000	8166000	and I'll put mercies meme video unlisted
8166000	8168000	so she can upload it whenever she desires
8168000	8170000	and I'm gonna doom
8170000	8172000	no
8172000	8174000	no don't doom
8176000	8178000	how about a tiny speck of doom
8178000	8180000	why would you doom
8180000	8182000	everything is going so well the girls are getting monetized
8182000	8184000	emmy and aces
8184000	8186000	are about to do their celebration
8186000	8188000	mercies celebration was fantastic
8188000	8190000	someone was gifting her 50 bombs
8190000	8192000	which was insane
8192000	8194000	no doom in on main
8194000	8196000	literally no doom in on main
8196000	8198000	like everything
8198000	8200000	is just going so fantastic
8200000	8202000	like I tweeted out like thank you for 5k
8202000	8204000	and I was saying like all that
8204000	8206000	self doubt and everything is just
8206000	8208000	melting away overnight which is true it has
8208000	8210000	like
8210000	8212000	generate money for free
8212000	8214000	yes oh my god
8214000	8216000	please don't ever feel bad if you can't
8216000	8218000	genuinely like give money you don't understand
8218000	8220000	like you interacting with posts
8220000	8222000	you're promoting them more in the algorithm
8222000	8224000	em
8224000	8226000	you're watching their asmr
8226000	8228000	you're watching ads that goes to the money
8228000	8230000	the girl gets money for that
8230000	8232000	em like
8232000	8234000	please don't ever worry
8234000	8236000	if you can't hand over money
8236000	8238000	that's why I always say
8238000	8240000	oh I'm always streaming for free
8240000	8242000	you don't have to be a member
8242000	8244000	like the membership stream start up next week
8244000	8246000	but you don't have to be a member to consume at all
8246000	8248000	em
8248000	8250000	type thingy
8250000	8252000	I care about you and the girls too much
8252000	8254000	I'm always gonna worry
8254000	8256000	I was worrying over them I was like

8262000	8264000	oh my god
8264000	8266000	it's why
8266000	8268000	I probably sound a bit tired
8268000	8270000	I woke up at the last
8270000	8272000	possible minute for stream
8272000	8274000	not because I don't love you because you guys

8284000	8286000	and I'm so freaking glad I got a full 8 hours
8286000	8288000	I'm like oh I feel so good
8288000	8290000	it feels so good to get
8290000	8292000	a full 8 hours of sleep
8292000	8294000	em
8294000	8296000	but yeah mummy loves us
8296000	8298000	is the mercy meme video
8298000	8300000	be a problem did youtube
8300000	8302000	unlist it no it's not out yet
8302000	8304000	I need to upload it to her channel
8304000	8306000	because I subtitled all the
8306000	8308000	meme videos
8308000	8310000	em
8310000	8312000	63
8312000	8314000	63
8314000	8316000	edgeville bank
8316000	8318000	that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane
8318000	8320000	which is a british tv
8320000	8322000	show or it was
8322000	8324000	I don't know if they make new episodes
8324000	8326000	but yeah
8326000	8328000	so if we like commenting streams
8328000	8330000	that helps yeah it helps
8330000	8332000	like immensely like
8332000	8334000	so to give you an example
8336000	8338000	ic does an asmr stream
8338000	8340000	you like
8340000	8342000	that stream and then emmy
8342000	8344000	does an asmr stream you like that stream
8344000	8346000	youtube goes youtube
8346000	8348000	algorithm goes hmm there's
8348000	8350000	a connection between these two girls
8350000	8352000	they've both done asmr and this viewer
8352000	8354000	both enjoyed them to leave a like
8354000	8356000	and then the
8356000	8358000	algorithm goes hmm
8358000	8360000	this other youtube
8360000	8362000	user both enjoyed these two
8362000	8364000	girls I'm going to start
8364000	8366000	recommending this user
8366000	8368000	these girls
8368000	8370000	and then it's kind of a knock on effect
8370000	8372000	so
8372000	8374000	em youtube
8374000	8376000	will recommend
8376000	8378000	someone who's never consumed ic's asmr
8378000	8380000	before because they liked
8380000	8382000	emmy's asmr
8382000	8384000	and then that also goes
8384000	8386000	further ahead to other vtuber asmr
8386000	8388000	is for example the algorithm
8388000	8390000	is like an insane
8390000	8392000	tangled spider web
8392000	8394000	of a mess
8394000	8396000	and anything you do
8396000	8398000	will affect it so
8398000	8400000	for example
8400000	8402000	if you
8402000	8404000	go on twitter right now and you type in
8404000	8406000	emmybzu and it'll pop up her twitter
8406000	8408000	you've just affected your algorithm
8408000	8410000	on youtube because unfortunately
8410000	8412000	em websites
8412000	8414000	completely cross platform everything
8414000	8416000	whatever you type in even
8416000	8418000	if you go to rule 34
8418000	8420000	and type in the girls name
8420000	8422000	you will affect the
8422000	8424000	results of your youtube browsing
8424000	8426000	experience because
8426000	8428000	of what you've typed in on other websites
8428000	8430000	as well
8430000	8432000	em
8432000	8434000	it goes very deep
8434000	8436000	but unfortunately your websites are
8436000	8438000	all interconnected whether or not you want
8438000	8440000	to whether or not you say
8440000	8442000	no to cookies no to this
8442000	8444000	they are connected it's undeniable
8444000	8446000	em
8446000	8448000	does youtube listen in the chat too
8448000	8450000	so youtube will
8450000	8452000	see you interacting
8452000	8454000	with me on chat and it'll say
8454000	8456000	this user like strony will
8456000	8458000	funny enough this other
8458000	8460000	vtuber is like
8460000	8462000	strony I will recommend this person
8462000	8464000	strony
8464000	8466000	another version of strony type thing
8466000	8468000	sorry I'm not very good with my words at the moment
8468000	8470000	em
8470000	8472000	we'll probably we'll get we'll do a
8472000	8474000	tinkle and a refuel at the 3 hour mark
8474000	8476000	em
8476000	8478000	I'm definitely gonna make another tea and I'm gonna get some
8478000	8480000	yummy snacks
8480000	8482000	em
8482000	8484000	I bought a nature valley bar
8484000	8486000	and I'm like is that the worst snack to eat
8486000	8488000	on stream there's just gonna be dust everywhere
8488000	8490000	and you
8490000	8492000	stop looking at me misspelling your name
8492000	8494000	how can you not
8494000	8496000	strony kittles
8496000	8498000	strony
8498000	8500000	kittles
8500000	8502000	strony cuttles
8502000	8504000	how can you spell it wrong
8504000	8506000	but yeah like literally if you
8506000	8508000	go on twitter
8508000	8510000	and you search
8510000	8512000	vealour
8512000	8514000	again you're manipulating the algorithm
8514000	8516000	when you go on youtube odds are you'll probably
8516000	8518000	have a few more vealour streams recommended
8518000	8520000	to you on your page or down the side bar
8520000	8522000	because
8522000	8524000	the algorithm knows that you have an interest
8524000	8526000	in vealour it's it's it goes so deep
8526000	8528000	unfortunately cookies are just
8528000	8530000	websites are such
8530000	8532000	liars being like oh we don't track you
8532000	8534000	via cookies only the essential ones
8534000	8536000	you liar
8536000	8538000	you liar it's just the way the internet is
8538000	8540000	these days we're just such shame
8540000	8542000	for the last
8542000	8544000	week I've been getting ads
8544000	8546000	regarding the Scotland
8546000	8548000	honestly
8548000	8550000	come visit Scotland
8550000	8552000	Scotland tourism
8552000	8554000	industry come to
8554000	8556000	Edmund
8556000	8558000	actually I think Edmund is the most
8558000	8560000	more expensive than Glasgow although it's
8560000	8562000	probably
8562000	8564000	a small amount of
8564000	8566000	different so if we're watching like
8566000	8568000	Scottish VTubers we should get
8568000	8570000	more Scottish VTubers
8570000	8572000	I actually don't know about
8572000	8574000	getting they're like
8574000	8576000	super rare I'ma just say this
8576000	8578000	on behalf of all Scottish VTubers
8578000	8580000	right now a lot has to go wrong
8580000	8582000	in your life in order to become
8582000	8584000	a Scottish VTuber
8584000	8586000	now to become a VTuber in general
8586000	8588000	that's perfectly normal if you're any other
8588000	8590000	nationality if you're Scottish
8590000	8592000	and a VTuber
8592000	8594000	bruh whatever happened in your life
8594000	8596000	I feel for you hen so if you're a Scottish VTuber
8596000	8598000	listening in I feel for you hen
8598000	8600000	don't worry I went through it too
8602000	8604000	you know
8604000	8606000	I
8606000	8608000	am only aware of two other
8608000	8610000	Scottish VTubers
8610000	8612000	unfortunately they are not
8612000	8614000	for me content-wise
8614000	8616000	definitely not for me
8616000	8618000	but that's just my
8618000	8620000	being me
8620000	8622000	definitely not on the same page
8622000	8624000	when it comes to
8624000	8626000	thought process
8626000	8628000	or like
8628000	8630000	how we were raised and all that
8630000	8632000	you can kinda tell when you
8632000	8634000	hear someone talk
8634000	8636000	you can kinda tell the way they've been raised
8636000	8638000	in Scotland which sounds terrible
8638000	8640000	sounds almost classic so I'm not trying
8640000	8642000	to be like that I'm just trying to be like
8644000	8646000	I don't know you can
8646000	8648000	you can tell when someone doesn't
8648000	8650000	gear and then you can tell when someone
8650000	8652000	geyser and I
8652000	8654000	much better with people who didn't geyser
8654000	8656000	you know
8656000	8658000	so how do I infect other people's
8658000	8660000	algorithm
8660000	8662000	I suppose
8662000	8664000	the only way you can do it
8664000	8666000	oh we're almost at 8k
8666000	8668000	is
8668000	8670000	by posting
8670000	8672000	YouTube shorts in particular
8672000	8674000	in locations where it's appropriate
8674000	8676000	so just that you're in a general
8676000	8678000	VTuber fan discord
8678000	8680000	if someone were to watch that short
8680000	8682000	fully
8682000	8684000	you have successfully infected them
8684000	8686000	algorithm-wise
8686000	8688000	because
8688000	8690000	they consume that content
8690000	8692000	it's fascinating
8692000	8694000	and honestly I actually am quite interested
8694000	8696000	in the infection side of it
8696000	8698000	but yes you can successfully
8698000	8700000	infect someone with the veiler virus
8704000	8706000	I am
8708000	8710000	sorry I just read that comment
8710000	8712000	yes you can infect someone
8712000	8714000	by doing that if they have never consumed
8714000	8716000	veiler content
8716000	8718000	but you
8718000	8720000	maybe make clips of the girls and they click it
8720000	8722000	for the first time because they got recommended
8722000	8724000	or you post in a discord that's appropriate
8724000	8726000	to post the VTuber stuff
8726000	8728000	or maybe a VTuber read it
8728000	8730000	actually they're
8730000	8732000	I think there's
8732000	8734000	so
8734000	8736000	veiler do have the veiler read it
8736000	8738000	but it's not being publicly posted yet
8738000	8740000	but I don't know
8740000	8742000	I mean literally I was just going to put everyone's
8742000	8744000	oh sorry
8744000	8746000	this is why I can't talk and think at the same time
8746000	8748000	there is a possibility
8748000	8750000	of just posting it for memes
8750000	8752000	but we were going to have to put it on approved posts
8752000	8754000	only because it can get nasty
8754000	8756000	pretty quickly
8756000	8758000	and I do not want any of the girls
8758000	8760000	to be subjected to anything
8760000	8762000	nasty
8762000	8764000	let's go infect some
8764000	8766000	replays
8766000	8768000	I have no idea what you're saying but I'll take your word for it
8768000	8770000	thank you
8770000	8772000	it's Edinburgh a bad place no it's not
8772000	8774000	it's just more rich
8774000	8776000	and
8776000	8778000	sometimes rich people
8778000	8780000	are not very empathetic
8780000	8782000	but that was such a mean and nasty
8782000	8784000	generalization
8784000	8786000	when I say rich people I'm talking like
8786000	8788000	multi-billionaires
8788000	8790000	type stuff rich
8790000	8792000	the average duo everyone's empathetic
8792000	8794000	but if you're not very empathetic
8794000	8796000	please don't worry I'm actually going to do an
8796000	8798000	educational stream on human nature
8798000	8800000	and empathy, empathy is a practice behaviour
8800000	8802000	you need to practice empathy to get it
8802000	8804000	you need to
8804000	8806000	flip the switch
8806000	8808000	and be able to have abstract thoughts
8808000	8810000	about empathy as a whole
8810000	8812000	and I'm actually going to challenge you guys
8812000	8814000	and I'm going to
8814000	8816000	make up scenarios where you need to be empathetic
8816000	8818000	and you need to give me a reason
8818000	8820000	why you feel empathetic
8820000	8822000	but I'm going to make the scenarios super hard
8822000	8824000	so at a glance you're like
8824000	8826000	that's disgusting behaviour
8828000	8830000	but
8830000	8832000	we have to learn to be empathetic
8832000	8834000	and we have to think about why
8834000	8836000	the person may have behaved that way
8838000	8840000	it'll be an interesting concept
8840000	8842000	either the stream will go terrible and everyone can laugh at it
8842000	8844000	which is fine I don't mind you guys
8844000	8846000	or I'll have to laugh at my stream ideas
8846000	8848000	because I have pretty bizarre concepts sometimes
8850000	8852000	oh man we have a place like that too
8852000	8854000	in Milan, never got Milan
8854000	8856000	so it's like London but smaller and prettier
8856000	8858000	it's pretty old, it's pretty old
8858000	8860000	there's a lot of older architecture
8860000	8862000	Edinburgh is turning people
8862000	8864000	into an English city in regards to the most posh people
8864000	8866000	I definitely feel more comfortable
8866000	8868000	in Glasgow
8868000	8870000	and good old Glasgow
8870000	8872000	mutual comfy
8872000	8874000	and then
8874000	8876000	I'm going to pull the lever and make everything worse
8876000	8878000	what does that mean
8878000	8880000	the Scottish accents kind of come from
8880000	8882000	wealth and class
8882000	8884000	so the more slang
8884000	8886000	you speak statistically
8886000	8888000	the more polvo you are
8888000	8890000	and it's completely normal to be
8890000	8892000	in poverty in Scotland
8892000	8894000	the statistics are 1 in 5
8894000	8896000	children are growing up
8896000	8898000	in poverty however
8898000	8900000	I actually think the statistics
8900000	8902000	are in 3 now
8902000	8904000	so it's completely normal
8904000	8906000	to be impoverished
8906000	8908000	when you grow up
8908000	8910000	it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary
8910000	8912000	no one's rich type idea
8912000	8914000	I like that, I like human psychology
8914000	8916000	that sounds pretty interesting
8916000	8918000	are you trying to get us to empathise with some scoundrels
8918000	8920000	no nothing bad
8920000	8922000	but I want to
8924000	8926000	oh no
8926000	8928000	oh no the fire
8928000	8930000	pick up the ashes
8930000	8932000	I will clear it
8932000	8934000	oh no you've already cleared the campsite for me
8934000	8936000	thank you refling
8936000	8938000	wow we're at 8.9
8938000	8940000	we are getting through it
8940000	8942000	oh look I burn
8942000	8944000	you dancing
8944000	8946000	who's dancing back there
8946000	8948000	I burnt 98 lobsters
8948000	8950000	because I had 500
8950000	8952000	hold on
8952000	8954000	thank you fire maker
8954000	8956000	you're so on fire
8956000	8958000	in hot hot hot
8958000	8960000	in hot hot hot
8960000	8962000	you so on fire
8962000	8964000	anyway
8964000	8966000	look at the drip, I forgot about my drip
8966000	8968000	my goodness
8968000	8970000	look at the eyes, that is hilarious
8970000	8972000	that they're just blobs
8972000	8974000	I love this game
8974000	8976000	that's so good
8976000	8978000	I heard a lot of good stuff about Glasgow
8978000	8980000	firepaw, flames, yes
8982000	8984000	it's currently British
8984000	8986000	only a thing, wait sorry
8986000	8988000	isn't current British English only a thing
8988000	8990000	because they didn't want to be associated with the nobility of the plagues
8990000	8992000	yes
8992000	8994000	there is a very viral clip
8994000	8996000	that a guy
8996000	8998000	is being interviewed
8998000	9000000	and
9000000	9002000	oh god what was the word
9002000	9004000	I can see the interview in my head
9006000	9008000	it's an English interview
9008000	9010000	and the guy speaks
9010000	9012000	what we call posh English
9012000	9014000	and then the guy replies
9014000	9016000	tomorrow, that's it
9016000	9018000	the guy goes like tomorrow
9018000	9020000	and then the guy replies tomorrow
9020000	9022000	and he's like not trying to
9022000	9024000	correct him but he's trying to be like
9024000	9026000	wow look at the difference in this
9026000	9028000	regional accent
9028000	9030000	but the problem
9030000	9032000	with it, it's not that problematic
9032000	9034000	relax before you're like well steady on
9034000	9036000	you've got blue hair haven't you, nah relax
9036000	9038000	I ain't got blue hair, can't I
9038000	9040000	if anything I'm the opposite of you
9040000	9042000	the kind of thing
9042000	9044000	with it is because posh English
9044000	9046000	accents are associated with wealth
9046000	9048000	are associated with grammar
9048000	9050000	schools for example, a grammar school
9050000	9052000	is a rich person
9052000	9054000	school, high education
9054000	9056000	school, public education
9056000	9058000	is kind of associated with
9058000	9060000	not necessarily pro but if you can't
9060000	9062000	afford public education
9062000	9064000	you can't afford it
9064000	9066000	so the guy was like
9066000	9068000	look at this accent
9068000	9070000	this man clearly
9070000	9072000	you know, wasn't
9072000	9074000	educated in a grammar school type thing
9074000	9076000	and that's when it becomes a wee bit of an issue
9076000	9078000	received
9078000	9080000	pronunciation
9082000	9084000	it's them also calling it the queen's English
9084000	9086000	just finding out it's not
9086000	9088000	Glasgow
9088000	9090000	it's a shame
9090000	9092000	it's fine if you accidentally
9092000	9094000	name a city wrong like Edinburgh
9094000	9096000	Edinburgh is normally
9096000	9098000	pronounced Edinburgh
9098000	9100000	by
9100000	9102000	folk who don't come from here
9102000	9104000	that's perfectly normal
9104000	9106000	I'm sure I say all these locations
9106000	9108000	in different countries wrong as well
9108000	9110000	like Arkansas is Arkansas
9110000	9112000	and like Mississippi
9112000	9114000	and what's another state
9114000	9116000	in America
9116000	9118000	Rhode Island
9118000	9120000	Colorado
9120000	9122000	I'm sure I say it funny so please don't ever be embarrassed
9122000	9124000	if you say it funny
9124000	9126000	I always said Glasgow
9126000	9128000	but in the regional dialect
9128000	9130000	it can also be Glasgow
9130000	9132000	don't ask why it's Glasgow
9132000	9134000	it just is Glasgow
9134000	9136000	Texas
9136000	9138000	I'm sure I'll say
9138000	9140000	I don't know if there's some locations
9140000	9142000	in the states that I can name
9144000	9146000	Anaheim is a place in
9146000	9148000	California
9148000	9150000	because they hold
9150000	9152000	conventions
9152000	9154000	I'm pretty sure there was some Anaheim convention
9154000	9156000	at one point
9156000	9158000	if I ever visit the UK I'll go to Glasgow
9158000	9160000	honestly it's such a nice
9160000	9162000	although Edinburgh is pretty good for
9162000	9164000	tourist stuff like the Edinburgh Castle
9164000	9166000	and the Edinburgh Museum
9166000	9168000	are pretty close together
9170000	9172000	did you say Wales is associated with
9172000	9174000	Posh? No, Wales
9174000	9176000	is associated
9176000	9178000	with the mining towns and all of that
9178000	9180000	and the
9180000	9182000	Welsh accent
9182000	9184000	I can't do
9184000	9186000	what is the Welsh accent?
9186000	9188000	I can't think of a Welsh
9188000	9190000	sentence to say
9190000	9192000	to start the accent
9192000	9194000	a bit of coke
9194000	9196000	and rum please
9196000	9198000	the only example
9198000	9200000	of Welsh accent I have
9200000	9202000	is this little Britain
9202000	9204000	skit where the guy's like
9204000	9206000	I'm the only gay in the village
9206000	9208000	because he was so proudful
9208000	9210000	he'd be silly that guy's
9210000	9212000	or that girl or that lass
9212000	9214000	and he's like I'm the only gay in the village
9214000	9216000	that's the only exposure to the
9216000	9218000	Welsh accent to be honest
9218000	9220000	which is absolutely terrible
9220000	9222000	all of a sudden we're drifting up to the
9222000	9224000	Northern Ireland
9224000	9226000	Heavenly Father who art in heaven
9226000	9228000	hallo to be thy name
9228000	9230000	today we're gathered with the reeflings at Hedgerville
9230000	9232000	we're currently cooking up a storm
9232000	9234000	with swordfish but we still have a high
9234000	9236000	burn rate
9236000	9238000	100% now are you joking
9238000	9240000	why is my burn rate getting higher
9240000	9242000	I'm leveling up
9242000	9244000	Wales is associated with sheep
9244000	9246000	I will tell you
9246000	9248000	the reason why Wales are associated with sheep
9248000	9250000	it's illegal
9250000	9252000	to steal a farmer's sheep
9252000	9254000	it wasn't at the time
9254000	9256000	many a year ago
9256000	9258000	to have
9258000	9260000	actions with the sheep
9260000	9262000	which is why
9262000	9264000	people would pretend
9264000	9266000	that they had had
9266000	9268000	action with a sheep
9268000	9270000	instead of stealing it
9270000	9272000	because you can't get arrested for actions
9272000	9274000	but you could get arrested for stealing at the time
9274000	9276000	okay that is why
9276000	9278000	poor Welsh people
9278000	9280000	have to deal with that stereotype
9280000	9282000	and it's such a shame
9282000	9284000	because it's not true
9284000	9286000	you just need to know a little bit of history
9286000	9288000	to understand a little bit more
9288000	9290000	Aberdonians
9290000	9292000	profusely sweating
9292000	9294000	what is it
9294000	9296000	Aberdeen
9296000	9298000	absolutely short in behaviour
9298000	9300000	stealing was the death penalty
9300000	9302000	yes okay
9302000	9304000	that would be it
9304000	9306000	it was even more severe than I originally had anticipated
9306000	9308000	I shan't be in Scottish
9308000	9310000	I'm getting the football off
9310000	9312000	I said
9312000	9314000	oh my god sin I have bad news
9314000	9316000	I might have to delay our collab
9316000	9318000	into July

9320000	9322000	and each of our agency reasons
9322000	9324000	you'll have to forgive me but I do have my shock
9324000	9326000	caller for it
9326000	9328000	but you're going to have to give me some time

9334000	9336000	and we've got a total level of
9336000	9338000	150, level 2000

9392000	9394000	literally see my heart spike every time you go

9408000	9410000	I don't know how you're not exhausted by the end of it
9410000	9412000	honestly I'd be shattered after like 30 seconds
9412000	9414000	of moving around I'd be like right that's all

9436000	9438000	did you
9438000	9440000	kicked my toenail off the wall a few times
9440000	9442000	oh no
9442000	9444000	what
9444000	9446000	what's your community name again
9446000	9448000	because I remember when I
9448000	9450000	when I saw you getting started
9450000	9452000	it had been named something
9452000	9454000	but I don't know
9454000	9456000	if you're still named that and I don't want to say the name
9456000	9458000	okay it's imps now
9458000	9460000	okay it was something else
9460000	9462000	um
9462000	9464000	it was something else way at the start
9464000	9466000	and I didn't want to say it
9466000	9468000	I was seeking suspicion I know who's getting banned
9468000	9470000	just
9470000	9472000	do a couple of them clapping with no hands audio
9472000	9474000	sounds like you got a good workout
9474000	9476000	and bruh I was so out of breath
9476000	9478000	recording that like
9478000	9480000	horrifically out of breath
9480000	9482000	I was like
9482000	9484000	like you can literally here we go like
9484000	9486000	ah
9486000	9488000	clap clap clap clap clap clap basically
9488000	9490000	I was so bad
9490000	9492000	I was so bad
9494000	9496000	man
9496000	9498000	wait what level did I just get
9498000	9500000	64
9500000	9502000	64 bro wait why can I not kick this
9502000	9504000	yes oh my god
9504000	9506000	it was 64
9510000	9512000	I was suggested sin cells that was
9512000	9514000	it I didn't yeah I'm pretty sure
9514000	9516000	isn't incel and
9516000	9518000	what's that other word
9518000	9520000	like a ban phrase on twitch
9520000	9522000	now do they still do that
9522000	9524000	do they still moderate that
9524000	9526000	because I remember it got banned
9526000	9528000	and I was like isn't that
9528000	9530000	like I don't like the word
9530000	9532000	simp because I feel like it's used anytime
9532000	9534000	where a guy just genuinely enjoys content
9534000	9536000	from a girl which is so
9536000	9538000	like it's quite frustrating because it's just like
9538000	9540000	I don't like the terminology
9540000	9542000	but to like outright ban it
9542000	9544000	is like what oh did I
9544000	9546000	miss a few cents yeah twitch doesn't
9546000	9548000	allow those words but I've never really tested it out
9550000	9552000	you can get banned for it that's
9552000	9554000	pretty
9554000	9556000	yeah like I'm pretty
9556000	9558000	tired of the word simp because I think it's
9558000	9560000	used whenever someone just genuinely enjoys
9560000	9562000	content that just happens to be from
9562000	9564000	a chick like it's really
9564000	9566000	but anyway I think outright
9566000	9568000	banning it is like a bit severe
9568000	9570000	I just hope that the
9570000	9572000	definition slowly changes over time
9572000	9574000	did someone just talk there
9574000	9576000	maybe later
9576000	9578000	oh wait was that for me
9578000	9580000	oh my god I wasn't paying attention
9580000	9582000	was that for me
9586000	9588000	the moderation is inconsistent
9588000	9590000	to say the least yeah it's why I don't
9590000	9592000	really enjoy twitch
9592000	9594000	a lot of people write why not twitch
9594000	9596000	but I have seen countless examples
9596000	9598000	of what have how they don't
9598000	9600000	apply the rules fairly
9600000	9602000	at least with youtube
9602000	9604000	it does seem like a
9604000	9606000	overall blanket
9606000	9608000	which is very easy to be like okay
9608000	9610000	right because like
9610000	9612000	now I'm aware that you're looking
9612000	9614000	isn't allowed now I don't know why
9614000	9616000	older videos that are made
9616000	9618000	eons back are fine but recently
9618000	9620000	not know like Azura
9620000	9622000	was eating a cookie
9622000	9624000	Azura was eating a cookie
9624000	9626000	and she got a warning for
9626000	9628000	enjoying a cookie just because
9628000	9630000	her voice is so silky smooth
9632000	9634000	it's definitely been
9634000	9636000	generalized to any sort of kindness towards a person
9636000	9638000	but especially women
9638000	9640000	yeah like it's why I'm pretty
9640000	9642000	tired of hearing about it to be honest
9642000	9644000	like I think it's overstayed it's welcome
9644000	9646000	cause it just gets used to
9646000	9648000	oh you enjoy any type of
9648000	9650000	content from women
9650000	9652000	and it's like bruv I'm just here
9652000	9654000	enjoy the runescape streams like my god
9654000	9656000	I'm here enjoy the rambles and how we're going to take down
9656000	9658000	the big banks
9658000	9660000	um
9660000	9662000	I prefer youtube
9662000	9664000	twitch raising sub prices
9664000	9666000	oh my gosh yes at least
9666000	9668000	with youtube you can decide on membership
9668000	9670000	price I say that as if I didn't
9670000	9672000	begrudgingly raise my price by a dollar
9672000	9674000	of pure rage
9674000	9676000	but I will make it up I will do as much
9676000	9678000	streaming as I can to
9678000	9680000	earn that money
9680000	9682000	um
9682000	9684000	but yeah twitcher just seems
9684000	9686000	to be taking a sin
9686000	9688000	moving to youtube
9688000	9690000	if you type in
9690000	9692000	twitch that you're
9692000	9694000	an age you get banned 100%
9694000	9696000	yeah
9696000	9698000	it was a very
9698000	9700000	cookie indeed
9700000	9702000	can't eat a cookie on stream
9702000	9704000	youtube is really crumbling apart
9706000	9708000	thank you
9708000	9710000	I came up with that myself thank you
9710000	9712000	hi reeflings

9714000	9716000	like five hours hi reefling reefling
9720000	9722000	no no I came up with that joke myself I promise
9722000	9724000	it totally

9726000	9728000	how is she looking sideways is she
9728000	9730000	supposed to be looking sideways
9732000	9734000	I just realized she's never looking
9734000	9736000	why are you looking to the side
9736000	9738000	I don't know maybe she's got like a sore neck
9738000	9740000	or something that's okay
9744000	9746000	I didn't miss the
9746000	9748000	yeah it turns out all
9748000	9750000	had to do was open the application
9750000	9752000	in order for it to make noise
9752000	9754000	I accidentally closed it the other time I tried
9754000	9756000	it and couldn't figure it out
9756000	9758000	she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes
9758000	9760000	honestly like look into my eyes
9760000	9762000	not around my eyes
9762000	9764000	yeah
9764000	9766000	it's like when you see a guy call
9766000	9768000	someone a simp for watching a girl
9768000	9770000	and then you look and they watch some big muscle
9770000	9772000	male streamer for nine hours a day
9772000	9774000	but that doesn't count
9774000	9776000	literally glorkin
9776000	9778000	hard on it
9778000	9780000	but because it's a whammin bad
9780000	9782000	but male good
9782000	9784000	bruv we're tired
9784000	9786000	bruv let's just enjoy
9786000	9788000	let's just enjoy the conspiracy through
9788000	9790000	okay let's just enjoy him
9790000	9792000	it makes you a simp for listening
9792000	9794000	to me coconut
9794000	9796000	my cheeks
9796000	9798000	and make them clap for 15 minutes and hey ho
9798000	9800000	then hey ho
9800000	9802000	snakes and stones
9802000	9804000	may break my bronze
9804000	9806000	but you'll never get more quality content
9806000	9808000	from another streamer
9808000	9810000	when it comes to ASMR
9810000	9812000	no that's a lie that's a lie
9812000	9814000	oh 8.6
9814000	9816000	8.6
9816000	9818000	bronze
9818000	9820000	bronze
9820000	9822000	my issue with twitch at the moment is
9822000	9824000	something about the vtuber
9824000	9826000	yes that was a recent to us update
9826000	9828000	if you did not hear the news
9828000	9830000	vtubers now
9830000	9832000	must
9832000	9834000	conform
9834000	9836000	to the attire
9836000	9838000	rules of in real life streamers
9838000	9840000	but the problem with that is a lot of vtuber models
9840000	9842000	you know
9842000	9844000	they have a bit of appeal to them
9844000	9846000	show if you will
9846000	9848000	and because of twitch's
9848000	9850000	who goes there inconsistencies
9850000	9852000	it's very hard
9852000	9854000	to ascertain
9854000	9856000	if
9856000	9858000	uh oh sorry
9858000	9860000	hold on
9860000	9862000	hold on
9862000	9864000	I'm just gonna check if any of the
9864000	9866000	girls are streaming

9928000	9930000	until 11 hours and 55 minutes
9930000	9932000	because that is exactly when the vod breaks
9932000	9934000	em
9934000	9936000	so please do not be afraid
9936000	9938000	to watch my gen mates and enjoy them
9938000	9940000	and then you are welcome
9940000	9942000	to come back to me at any time
9942000	9944000	wow this person got gardening
9944000	9946000	gardening
9946000	9948000	you got a freaking cabbage on your back
9948000	9950000	aww you got green cake
9950000	9952000	aww I forgot to buy his green cake
9952000	9954000	we should probably buy green cakes
9954000	9956000	aren't the twitch attire standards
9956000	9958000	based on what you are
9958000	9960000	doesn't that mean vtubers need to
9960000	9962000	yeah so on twitch
9962000	9964000	you can
9964000	9966000	stream in a bikini if you are in a pool
9966000	9968000	or a hot tub
9968000	9970000	so that is like saying
9970000	9972000	I could pop up on my bikini toggle
9972000	9974000	right now and put like a hot tub
9974000	9976000	asset and then I am good to go
9976000	9978000	question mark like that seems pretty redone
9978000	9980000	this
9980000	9982000	I'll close that because it is kind of covering up
9982000	9984000	me me me
9984000	9986000	em
9986000	9988000	don't forget
9988000	9990000	that twitch has the hot tub category
9990000	9992000	which is only worth watching
9992000	9994000	when some insane guy in a lab coat
9994000	9996000	show oh no the fire we got so distracted
9996000	9998000	we got so distracted
9998000	10000000	talking about the um
10000000	10002000	let me
10002000	10004000	let me take the ashes so they don't get in the way
10004000	10006000	I thought ashes got in the way of cooking
10006000	10008000	am I going crazy did I make that up
10008000	10010000	fire
10010000	10012000	er yes thank you
10012000	10014000	much more depreciation
10014000	10016000	em
10016000	10018000	I completely forgot what I was saying
10018000	10020000	in real life youtube is barely having a time
10020000	10022000	I feel like they get away with anything
10022000	10024000	youtube is definitely more
10024000	10026000	late wait am I dumb
10026000	10028000	I am em youtube is definitely
10028000	10030000	like so much nicer than me
10030000	10032000	em
10032000	10034000	it's just the facts
10034000	10036000	bro I'm sorry you can argue
10036000	10038000	to a wall
10038000	10040000	god my burn rate keeps going up
10040000	10042000	stop
10042000	10044000	stop stop burning
10044000	10046000	you shouldn't be burning
10048000	10050000	em
10050000	10052000	I'm here for the long haul oh yeah
10052000	10054000	you got endurance for 12 hours
10054000	10056000	abusing mods
10056000	10058000	streamer abusing mods
10058000	10060000	but they like it though
10060000	10062000	don't you mods
10062000	10064000	but you can't speak
10064000	10066000	ha ha ha this is a one-sided
10066000	10068000	conversation
10068000	10070000	em
10070000	10072000	I think
10072000	10074000	all the girls got extra mods by the way
10074000	10076000	so do check your discord
10076000	10078000	or whatever you applied with
10078000	10080000	I have no idea I didn't handle the mods
10080000	10082000	so if you got picked as a mod congrats
10082000	10084000	wasn't it me
10084000	10086000	em
10086000	10088000	but do check because I think
10088000	10090000	3 people didn't respond
10090000	10092000	even though they were super keen
10092000	10094000	em
10094000	10096000	twitch admins have their favourite
10096000	10098000	mods and shambles
10098000	10100000	tell me
10100000	10102000	about the dude with the lab coat in the bikini
10102000	10104000	wait is that real
10104000	10106000	gotta get your hair blower up
10106000	10108000	there are potions
10108000	10110000	to help you last longer
10110000	10112000	oh my god that's terrible
10112000	10114000	mods aren't real they're like birds
10114000	10116000	post what you want
10116000	10118000	no I'm not here I do have mods
10118000	10120000	we need to keep things above board
10122000	10124000	another mod flexing on you
10124000	10126000	by deleting your message
10126000	10128000	lmao
10128000	10130000	lmao
10130000	10132000	and slap
10132000	10134000	I don't know what the lab coat thing is though
10134000	10136000	twitch feels better as a dedicated streaming site
10136000	10138000	but the actual infrastructure management
10138000	10140000	is awful yeah I would say
10140000	10142000	discoverability on
10142000	10144000	youtube is so much better
10144000	10146000	em in my opinion
10146000	10148000	especially with the shorts algorithm
10148000	10150000	I would say on twitch
10150000	10152000	the only way I could
10152000	10154000	you know
10154000	10156000	foresee someone
10156000	10158000	em
10158000	10160000	for
10160000	10162000	foresee
10162000	10164000	foresee someone
10164000	10166000	being
10166000	10168000	um
10168000	10170000	discovered is the
10170000	10172000	raid option which is called
10172000	10174000	redirect on youtube
10174000	10176000	if you get a streamer that is kind
10176000	10178000	enough and is massive and raids into you
10178000	10180000	it can
10180000	10182000	literally make or break
10182000	10184000	you as a streamer like it's pretty insane
10184000	10186000	it really is
10186000	10188000	like I have told
10188000	10190000	the girls please to always raid
10190000	10192000	into each other to keep a train going
10192000	10194000	em if
10194000	10196000	no other talent is online then you're more than
10196000	10198000	welcome to raid into
10198000	10200000	another agency
10200000	10202000	no problem at all like I
10202000	10204000	yesterday called
10204000	10206000	in a favor with a friend
10206000	10208000	mimosa and
10208000	10210000	she was so polite was it
10210000	10212000	yesterday no it must have been the other day
10212000	10214000	em she was so polite
10214000	10216000	and I said look I'll raid into you
10216000	10218000	but do me a favor when you finish up
10218000	10220000	your stream raid back into a violor girl
10220000	10222000	and she said that is more than
10222000	10224000	I'm more than happy with those terms and I was
10224000	10226000	like yeah I'm more than happy calling
10226000	10228000	a favor for a friend
10228000	10230000	em
10230000	10232000	yes
10232000	10234000	I absolutely don't mind
10234000	10236000	it at all em the VNU girls
10236000	10238000	have been absolutely fantastic
10238000	10240000	some of them have been raiding into me
10240000	10242000	I actually need to start messaging some of them
10242000	10244000	and being like hey you have 3D or microphone
10244000	10246000	question mark question mark
10246000	10248000	em yeah
10248000	10250000	I still find the violor mentality of mods
10250000	10252000	please do this thing thank you now please be quiet
10252000	10254000	affectionately
10254000	10256000	eee
10256000	10258000	yes em it's very
10258000	10260000	I don't want to say
10260000	10262000	jarring
10262000	10264000	em but for someone who maybe
10264000	10266000	is new to stream
10266000	10268000	and em
10268000	10270000	the streamer
10270000	10272000	is having a repertoire
10272000	10274000	but a back and forth with mods that are named
10274000	10276000	is a bit not isolated
10276000	10278000	but it's like you've it feels like
10278000	10280000	you've missed out on lore and it just gets harder
10280000	10282000	to enjoy the streamer like someone
10282000	10284000	could be lurking watching me for the first time
10284000	10286000	right now em
10286000	10288000	and just being like what's she all about type
10288000	10290000	thing and if I'm like oh mod X
10290000	10292000	mod this mod Y mod B
10292000	10294000	you can see and like crack and like you jokes all the time
10294000	10296000	em like
10296000	10298000	it's not very
10298000	10300000	enabling to come in
10300000	10302000	for the first time
10302000	10304000	em
10304000	10306000	whereas I quite like the
10306000	10308000	mods don't speak but we are
10308000	10310000	incredibly appreciative for you you know
10310000	10312000	mopping
10312000	10314000	mopping the floors and making sure everything
10314000	10316000	is good to go in the stream yeah
10316000	10318000	em
10318000	10320000	do shorts still work for discovery
10320000	10322000	emory said
10322000	10324000	they attach dead people to the channel
10324000	10326000	now
10326000	10328000	emy isn't entirely
10328000	10330000	wrong but she isn't entirely right
10330000	10332000	shorts
10332000	10334000	definitely have a
10334000	10336000	subscription
10336000	10338000	subscriber count effect
10338000	10340000	em and they also
10340000	10342000	have discoverability effect
10342000	10344000	now not all shorts
10344000	10346000	people who will subscribe to you
10346000	10348000	will show up in a live stream that's just
10348000	10350000	back some people purely
10350000	10352000	enjoy shorts mind
10352000	10354000	and they will just watch shorts and nothing
10354000	10356000	else that's perfectly fine
10356000	10358000	so emy is both right and both a wee bit
10358000	10360000	wrong it's very good
10360000	10362000	em I do have
10362000	10364000	brah
10364000	10366000	I have three shorts editors
10366000	10368000	and all three of them are busy for a couple
10368000	10370000	of weeks and I could absolutely
10370000	10372000	smash their faces in because I need help
10372000	10374000	I don't have editing skills
10374000	10376000	em
10376000	10378000	I think I'm going to have to reach out to an editor
10378000	10380000	that I like to style of
10380000	10382000	it's because I'm
10382000	10384000	I'm drowning I need help with shorts
10384000	10386000	and I do not have the skills for it
10386000	10388000	nor do I have the time for it
10388000	10390000	but I'm now that the girls are monetized
10390000	10392000	I'm wanting to
10392000	10394000	actually scroll
10394000	10396000	em I'm wanting to start pushing out
10396000	10398000	shorts for the baby girls now
10398000	10400000	em to help with overall sub count
10400000	10402000	em we are going to
10402000	10404000	put some advertisements into the shorts
10404000	10406000	as well so some might have more views
10406000	10408000	and others and we'll
10408000	10410000	take it from there look it's just a kind
10410000	10412000	of em my current
10412000	10414000	goal once everyone has done their celebration
10414000	10416000	monetization stream is
10416000	10418000	my current goals I'm going to get everyone to
10418000	10420000	5k subscribers
10420000	10422000	em
10422000	10424000	which
10424000	10426000	shouldn't really be too hard
10426000	10428000	em I do
10428000	10430000	have a collab ASMR that's going to go on
10430000	10432000	AC's channel
10432000	10434000	which should help boost her a little bit
10434000	10436000	em because the culling was just so
10436000	10438000	oh 65
10438000	10440000	wait we're going to
10440000	10442000	approach the naughty numbers
10442000	10444000	any naughty number approaches
10444000	10446000	me
10446000	10448000	em new viewers feel like
10448000	10450000	they are walking into a friend group
10450000	10452000	yes
10452000	10454000	it definitely is
10454000	10456000	kind of like especially
10456000	10458000	whenever I
10458000	10460000	kind of talk I like to
10460000	10462000	say oh I spoke about this
10462000	10464000	yesterday but don't worry if you weren't
10464000	10466000	there because it's also
10466000	10468000	quite nice and kind
10468000	10470000	language to use for people who may
10470000	10472000	genuinely who couldn't have been
10472000	10474000	there
10474000	10476000	types that
10476000	10478000	how did I keep doing that I don't know
10478000	10480000	how I keep doing that I'm being such a silly
10480000	10482000	bully with that
10482000	10484000	whoa 8.4
10484000	10486000	ok at 8000 I will
10486000	10488000	call a break and I'm going to
10488000	10490000	get a cup of tea get some snacks
10490000	10492000	em and
10492000	10494000	hopefully Gimli doesn't come flying into the room
10494000	10496000	the moment I open the door
10496000	10498000	but I think she may
10498000	10500000	em if the streamer is only talking
10500000	10502000	to their mods that's for the rest of the chat
10502000	10504000	hmm
10504000	10506000	your self count will be inflated but it's still a net positive
10506000	10508000	it's a positive overall
10508000	10510000	I'm happy to see this
10510000	10512000	publicly I really want to get play buttons
10512000	10514000	for the girls I think
10514000	10516000	I would absolutely
10516000	10518000	love that
10518000	10520000	em it will take time
10520000	10522000	it will take hard work
10522000	10524000	it will take dedication but
10524000	10526000	em I will
10526000	10528000	show the girls what is working for me
10528000	10530000	what has worked what is working
10530000	10532000	em and
10532000	10534000	you know if they do shorts with me
10534000	10536000	if they do ASMR collabs with other girls
10536000	10538000	em if they
10538000	10540000	do stream collabs with the girls
10540000	10542000	em I think
10542000	10544000	it is very possible
10544000	10546000	I actually do not see it as an impossibility
10546000	10548000	if the girls let me cook
10548000	10550000	and equally they also cook
10550000	10552000	em
10552000	10554000	I think it would be absolutely lovely
10554000	10556000	to get the girls play buttons and
10556000	10558000	before anyone asks this viewer
10558000	10560000	holding the play buttons
10560000	10562000	no why
10562000	10564000	I'll say it again
10564000	10566000	I would never
10566000	10568000	ever
10568000	10570000	hold a beautiful
10570000	10572000	symbol of their hard work
10572000	10574000	their dedication
10574000	10576000	their love for their craft
10576000	10578000	their love for their community
10578000	10580000	from the girl
10580000	10582000	absolutely not pointing fingers
10582000	10584000	but I think
10584000	10586000	it is very clear
10586000	10588000	there is corporate greedy
10588000	10590000	agencies
10590000	10592000	that care about accolades
10592000	10594000	to prevent them
10594000	10596000	to prevent their talents from holding
10596000	10598000	such a beautiful symbol
10598000	10600000	and then there are agencies like Vila
10600000	10602000	that says do whatever you want
10602000	10604000	here's the money
10604000	10606000	basically here do me one
10606000	10608000	have fun here's your money
10608000	10610000	here's your play button
10610000	10612000	yes
10612000	10614000	you don't want the play button on your giant mega yacht
10614000	10616000	no
10616000	10618000	I absolutely do not care for that
10618000	10620000	right I have to ask
10620000	10622000	I actually don't know if it's real
10622000	10624000	I only hear it from the memes
10624000	10626000	is the yacht real, is there actually a yacht
10626000	10628000	or is it just a meme
10628000	10630000	hello
10630000	10632000	do you plan on playing Titanfall 2
10632000	10634000	absolutely it is a fantastic game
10634000	10636000	I would love to give it
10636000	10638000	a shot
10638000	10640000	for the first time as Stronu
10640000	10642000	calls
10642000	10644000	and we can see BT
10644000	10646000	together
10646000	10648000	and this time I will get uppies from
10648000	10650000	the correct BT and not an enemy
10650000	10652000	that freaked me out
10652000	10654000	because I could have sworn it was
10654000	10656000	um
10656000	10658000	nah it's a meme, okay it's a meme
10658000	10660000	I thought it was real
10660000	10662000	I thought it was actually real
10662000	10664000	and someone was like oh my god
10664000	10666000	this person owns an actual yacht
10666000	10668000	on the back of these vtuber's hard work
10668000	10670000	and
10670000	10672000	I don't know who it is
10672000	10674000	you know who you are
10674000	10676000	whoever keeps telling me to save the blue one
10678000	10680000	I can't

10682000	10684000	and two Lamal
10684000	10686000	I'm starting to think you're just daily
10686000	10688000	asking that in my
10688000	10690000	marshmallow so I keep bringing it up
10690000	10692000	I cannot save anyone
10692000	10694000	I cannot save them all
10694000	10696000	but those
10696000	10698000	who seek the violor route
10698000	10700000	I will do anything
10700000	10702000	and everything in my power
10702000	10704000	to help you achieve your dreams

11004000	11006000	no you have to type her full name
11006000	11008000	we've only been out for a week the algorithm
11008000	11010000	isn't gonna know you're asking for Azura Delay
11010000	11012000	the vtuber you have to type
11012000	11014000	Azura Aze Ure A Space De Ule Ete
11016000	11018000	there you go Azura Delay
11018000	11020000	I know it has a T in it unfortunately
11020000	11022000	it is French so you drop the T
11022000	11024000	wow wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa
11024000	11026000	French and Scottish people
11026000	11028000	drop in the T in their pronunciations
11028000	11030000	what's going on here
11030000	11032000	no I simply type the surname
11032000	11034000	with the double L that's the problem
11034000	11036000	Katoos
11036000	11038000	you gotta give them the government
11038000	11040000	aww silly how silly
11040000	11042000	how could you forget
11042000	11044000	Scrolling Pinterest
11044000	11046000	and it's just
11046000	11048000	AI generated pics of koalas
11048000	11050000	with big what
11050000	11052000	wait what
11052000	11054000	did you type in one of her vtuber names
11054000	11056000	and then came up with that by the way strongy
11056000	11058000	since I never played Runescape
11058000	11060000	could you sell me on it
11060000	11062000	number go up
11062000	11064000	yippee
11064000	11066000	it is a slow incremental game
11066000	11068000	although it well depends on how you want to play it
11068000	11070000	I am literally just
11070000	11072000	cooking I'm cooking away look
11072000	11074000	see this little progress bar
11074000	11076000	cooking
11076000	11078000	I'm literally level 65
11078000	11080000	and cooking and
11080000	11082000	I
11082000	11084000	I'm watching the bar
11084000	11086000	slowly go up
11086000	11088000	and it's beautiful
11088000	11090000	and I get dopamine every time
11090000	11092000	as I level up in the game
11092000	11094000	it's gorgeous I just can't help it
11094000	11096000	I'm gonna be real
11096000	11098000	I'm not even here for the gameplay
11098000	11100000	I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac
11100000	11102000	I thought about doing Eden Isaac Runs
11102000	11104000	shortly for like a shorter stream idea
11104000	11106000	if you didn't know
11106000	11108000	most Isaac Runs
11108000	11110000	last one hour so I thought maybe
11110000	11112000	for a shorter stream
11112000	11114000	I would purposely do a four hour stream
11114000	11116000	so I can redirect into Emi
11116000	11118000	because I never redirect into Emi
11118000	11120000	I finally got to redirect into Azura
11120000	11122000	yesterday
11122000	11124000	but I never do it for Emi
11124000	11126000	and I can never do it for Icy
11126000	11128000	unless I pulled an all-nighter
11128000	11130000	I might pull an all-nighter so I can
11130000	11132000	say I redirected into Icy just to be a smug little
11132000	11134000	hmm about it
11134000	11136000	but I
11136000	11138000	wanted to do a four hour stream
11138000	11140000	so I can redirect into Emi at one point
11140000	11142000	because poor Emi never gets redirected
11142000	11144000	and my reeflings are never exposed
11144000	11146000	to Emi
11146000	11148000	what sentence?
11148000	11150000	I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it when I say sentences
11150000	11152000	and sometimes the sentences just
11152000	11154000	happen
11154000	11156000	I thought dropping tea was an American tip
11156000	11158000	not the harbor
11158000	11160000	don't remind me of all that beautiful tea
11162000	11164000	this is a preparation
11164000	11166000	but she's cooking for real for me
11166000	11168000	everybody feeding the fire to keep up
11168000	11170000	yes special thank you
11170000	11172000	to the reeflings
11172000	11174000	that are just helping stock the fire
11174000	11176000	this is making this go so fast
11176000	11178000	like so so fast so thank you
11178000	11180000	for all your help do it, I appreciate it greatly
11180000	11182000	hmm
11184000	11186000	but yes
11186000	11188000	ok say no more I'm sold and yeah Isaac all day every day
11188000	11190000	in November I'm warning you
11190000	11192000	all now November stream sniping
11192000	11194000	week I'm not even kidding
11194000	11196000	I want to play Isaac back to back to back to back to back
11196000	11198000	to back to 12 hour injurances
11198000	11200000	oh I've not
11200000	11202000	done that oh no
11202000	11204000	I would have to do all my membership streams
11204000	11206000	in one go
11206000	11208000	unless I make a deal
11208000	11210000	with membership people
11210000	11212000	hello strongy first time chatting
11212000	11214000	just came here from sheeby stream
11214000	11216000	hi harem
11216000	11218000	she wasn't holding up no she has
11218000	11220000	a migraine
11220000	11222000	I honestly I don't know what reason she has
11222000	11224000	a migraine for because I'm pretty sure migraines
11224000	11226000	have no rhyme or reason
11226000	11228000	but I'm like 99% sure
11228000	11230000	she was crying happy tears might have
11230000	11232000	affected it and she maybe is pretty dehydrated
11232000	11234000	right now
11234000	11236000	an hour for a run
11236000	11238000	mine lasts like 5 minutes I suck at the game
11238000	11240000	oh don't worry

11386000	11389920	Which leg? Your massive third leg? Oh yeah, you want me to have a big third leg for you?
11391120	11393680	Come here, wiefling. Mommy wants to play.
11397120	11400400	Some things I say, things that I'm like, that's creepy, not the other way around.
11400400	11402960	Um, put it on the table right now.
11405520	11411200	Strawny, I can't die. I'm too busy. Literally, I am too busy to die. I'm not even being funny.
11411200	11415520	Have you ever heard those stories where people are like in a coma and they're like close to passing
11416000	11420400	away, but then they go like, I'm sorry, I can't die right now. Like my family member is going to be
11421840	11426080	or like, oh, I'm too busy to die right now. And then they wake up from the coma.
11427040	11431680	Have you ever heard those stories? They're pretty crazy. You can't do that. I was caught off by
11431680	11439040	surprise. Oh wait, I worked. We will kill to, we will kill death to keep you safe, Strawny. Thank you.
11440000	11446000	I appreciate it. No, I am far too busy. I'm not going to say too much,
11447040	11451760	because I want to respect my girls, my Jen once. I've obviously been doing a lot of cooking,
11451760	11455520	actually. That remains, I need to go ask for a collaboration from another VTuber,
11455520	11458080	and I have no idea if they're going to accept, they might accept, they might not.
11459280	11467840	Hey ho, we'll try. Currently, Jen too is cooking, and yeah, no, I'm not naming them.
11468000	11475280	You'll be happy to know I'm not naming them. But it's very busy trying to maintain everything
11475280	11486240	all at once. But I did say I'm a workaholic, and I really enjoy working. I enjoy giving value for
11486240	11492160	money as well, especially in this day and age where everything's getting greedier and greedier.
11492160	11496720	I'm like, no, we're going to do a business tactic called undercut in the market.
11498480	11504640	Undercut, undercut, like that kind of thing. Damn, the hey ho gets moved. Hey ho,
11504640	11512160	hey ho, let me finish on my point, hey ho. Yeah, I really like pushing myself to offer value for
11512160	11517280	money. It's why even with membership streams, like on days where we do a membership stream,
11517280	11523520	I'm still going to do a cheeky two over stream before it, and then we can enjoy our more cuddly
11523520	11527680	membership streams. Like, I have absolutely no issue with that. It doesn't bother me none,
11529040	11538880	and life, life is good. We, we are bingchining. Undercut in the market, love. Yeah, like I,
11539600	11544800	as I said a bit earlier, but for the harem, that might not have been here when I was rambling
11544800	11550560	about it. I was saying that even if you cannot physically give any money to the creator you're
11550560	11556960	watching, just liking the stream or subscribing to them, or just hanging out and lurking,
11556960	11564400	all of this contributes to the algorithm and leads for the girls to more success, especially
11564400	11572160	VOD watchers, special shout out to VOD watchers, especially if the girl streams in a not good
11572240	11578640	time zone for you. I don't know, if you go into Mercy's comment section, there's like one dedicated
11578640	11584560	VOD watcher and I'm like, you are helping her out so much. I understand watching live stream
11584560	11590560	VODs is not the funnest thing because the person isn't live, but a lot of you are saying you kind
11590560	11597360	of listen to me ramble in the background. That is perfect because you, you engage with the content
11597360	11603200	for long periods of time, again, boosting the algorithm for the girl, boosting it, having
11603200	11611040	cross promotion with the vealor girls, it's just fantastic. It really is. 12 hours of content for
11611040	11618160	free, that is value. Yes, like I don't mind it, like now it's absolutely, it's not, I'm very serious
11618160	11624720	when I say this, this is absolutely not a reflection on any other VTuber streamer, whoever, whatever.
11625440	11636800	I do not find this to be a job, okay? This is fun, I'm enjoying myself, I am breaking my voice,
11636800	11642560	rambling to you, talking about all these plans, I've got cooking, talking about how things are,
11642560	11649840	like this doesn't feel a job, feel like a job and I feel sorry for streamers where it does feel
11649840	11660480	like a job and they can't publicly come out and be like that. Wow, 66! Maybe that should be my
11661680	11666560	donation, like a tip sound instead of, are you squiddin' me right now? Although actually,
11666560	11674000	I quite like are you squiddin' me right now. No thanks to the time stampers. Oh yes, special
11674000	11679360	thank you to time stampers as well, VOD watchers for any of the girls, the supplies to any of
11679360	11689280	the girls, seriously. You do not go unnoticed, especially on ASMR stream, time stamping on ASMR
11689280	11699280	streams is very good for me because I do have plans to clip the girls ASMRs. I'm currently in talks
11699280	11706480	with someone to do it for me, but the problem is, you know, the profits aren't, the profits won't be
11706480	11711120	there for the clipping ASMR things, but you know what, we'll get there, we'll get there.
11713040	11718480	All of the Vealoo girls are perfect for background noise, you all have very beautiful voices, oh thank
11718480	11724240	you! I'm sure all of us appreciate such a kind comment, like I love her mixer voices accents,
11724320	11737120	all of that. 1700 to go. Wait, what's 1700 to go? The fish? Oh no, wait, what's 1700 to go?
11738240	11746160	Clipping ASMR is a good idea. Yes, ASMR is a very popular category, so Emmy! Did Emmy get the right
11746160	11752800	route? Pen, pals and Emmy, did you get the right route? Did you get the right row? I said row instead
11753520	11758800	of row. Hi Emmy, hi pin pals. Don't worry, you don't have to talk too much because I think you're
11758800	11764320	bursting at the seams, so please feel free to go to the toilet at any time. The pin pals mouths
11764320	11769600	are open. We got the right route, that's what I raised you for, that's what I birthed you from
11769600	11779360	my loins for, Emmy, that's my Emmy. Hi pin pals, hi pin pals. Yeah, a pin pal came into my stream
11779360	11787440	and tattletailed on Emmy, saying that the pin pals are not giving her permission to tinkle.
11788000	11797120	Pin pals, what do you see to such accusations pin pals? Per Emmy's bladder is about to break,
11797120	11805440	so it's a traitor. No, no, you've been tattletailed on. Oh, she went snitch. Oh no, scared, that's right,
11805440	11809760	I'm on it, you pin pals, you don't think I'm watching you? You, as much as you watch over my
11809760	11817280	little sister, I need to watch over you too. No one was supposed to tattle. We were discussing it,
11817280	11823760	we were like, uh, yeah, it's quite an interesting, uh, interest. Snitches get stitches. Well,
11823760	11827840	pin pals already have stitches, haven't you seen your adorable design? You know, little,
11827840	11832640	little stitches over here. I plead the fifth, yeah, you better plead the fifth pin pals,
11832640	11840800	you're in trouble. Just to keep you up to date with what is going on on this lovely occasion,
11840800	11849440	Acey has finished her stream. Shibi has also finished her stream, unfortunately Shibi isn't
11849440	11853280	feeling so well today, so don't be afraid to send your love to Shibi. We gave her good
11853280	11860320	altitude care, we took care of her with her sister, Mama. Okay, I'll trust you or that you
11860320	11870880	look after your little sister. Um, why only do you want Amy's love? Bruh, has Amy mine corrupted
11870880	11875280	you so much that it's not even English? We only do what Amy loves. Oh right, sorry, I'm just
11875280	11879680	going in a quandary. So, oh, that was me, that was me, that was on me, that was on me, I'll
11879680	11885440	apologize. Apologize, pin pals, that was on me. I'm getting mine, I'm getting mine corrupted,

11902800	11912000	the streams? Wait, is there no Mercy stream? No, tell me you're lying, Mercy modis, is there no
11912000	11921760	Mercy stream? Shoulda picked Mercy, is there no Mercy stream? She's playing, no, there is a
11921760	11927840	Mercy stream. You should play in a prank on me, she's playing Harvester part two. I'll bean
11927840	11934880	machine, thank you for becoming a member. She's playing Harvester part two, um, so don't worry,
11935840	11944800	in T minus snippets, any snippets in the chat, T minus one, two, three, four, five-ish hours,
11945440	11953520	Mercy's coming online. I am just playing RuneScape, please do not feel forced to watch it,
11953520	11956480	I understand it's not the most exciting thing if you are not into RuneScape.
11956640	11965200	Um, we are currently in World 380 at Edgeville Bank, uh, Edgeville, that's right, Edge, Edge for me
11965200	11979520	right now, um, Bank and Hydration. Did I forget to put that burnt swordfish away? Um, we are currently
11980640	11985920	Azur's playing straight, wait, Azur's playing, why does it not display? YouTube is really,
11985920	11992160	okay, sorry, Azura, sorry, YouTube is really struggling to show me when the girls are going
11992160	12000800	live, oh, her thumbnail is adorable, oh, look at what Azur's thumbnail is, oh, it's adorable, she's
12000800	12007120	got a little, her hair on the cat, okay, Azura is up in three hours, just reach 69, how are you a
12007120	12014800	higher level than me? Did we not start at the same time? How are you a higher level than me? You can't
12015520	12023680	be, reeflings are a higher level than me. Uh, yes, T-minus, for the Bleeding Hearts, T-minus
12023680	12031120	three hours for Stray, a lovely, a little meow meow game, um, and then Sniff It's Warning in
12031120	12035680	five hours for Harvester, who is putting, are we getting drunk? Hold on, hold on, we're getting
12035680	12042160	drunk out in here, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me drop this, let me get drunk right now, go, go, go,
12042640	12048800	go! Oh that actually made, I love that noise, go, go, go, go, go, go, Reeflings, you're allowed to
12048800	12059440	go take a drink if you like, right, let's use it on the fire, did you select the funny all bell
12059440	12065040	on the sub button? Exactly, I don't see Azura's stream, I didn't display for me either, I only
12065040	12075840	displayed mercies there. I am under the impression that we are going to be added to Holodex soon,
12075840	12083680	which is a website which will list all of our streams and automatically do it to your time zone.
12083680	12097840	So that will be coming soon if I'm not mistaken. I don't know how it works,
12097840	12104760	but it means that it will auto show you everyone's stream. Veal or we did consider running our own
12104760	12112720	website, but it was like another expense that you know what, Holodex does it for free and I'd rather
12112800	12120000	put any expenses like back into the girls, back into shorts, back into promotion. There is for
12120000	12127040	those pinpals that are listening in and any snowberries, there may or may not be an ASMR
12128320	12135920	coming for snowberries and pinpals. I hope you enjoy it when it does come out, but there's a
12135920	12145120	little hint for you. Holodex takes an average of 20k on all channels as prerequisite. Okay,
12145120	12152160	well we're coming for it. For any yappening that you may have missed out on, because you are
12152160	12166960	watching the good ending on an Emmy stream. Long story short, Azura is the last one that we are
12166960	12174720	waiting for monetization on and all of the girls have been successfully monetized. I really started
12174720	12182000	through that one and the monetization streams will be happening soon. TM, you can become a member
12182320	12189360	as a reefling, you can become a member as a snippet and tomorrow snowberries and pinpals,
12190080	12197840	you can also become a member because the girls are doing their membership celebration. So please
12197840	12202800	do not worry though, the girls will always be streaming for free as well. They will not be
12202800	12209040	exclusively doing membership streams, that's not how it works around these parts, but please do
12209040	12213840	look out for it because once my endurance stream ends, I'm streaming for 12 hours, I'm doing a
12213840	12219360	cheeky endurance stream, once my stream ends I am going to be the one pulling the strings behind
12219360	12224960	the scenes and opening up membership, so if you really wanted to get it before the stream you can,
12224960	12231680	but it's better to do it on stream because the girls will say your name. Do you want to hear
12231680	12239680	the girls say your name? Don't be silly, let the girls say your name. My wallet isn't paying
12239680	12246960	waiting for membership to become available. Oh okay, this isn't Emmy in game before anyone
12246960	12252960	thinks it's actually Emmy, that's hilarious though. We've got a pinpal and they're waiting on Emmy
12253040	12261680	um singing. Say mommy would you like us to send you Emmy's latest dealie at audio and marrow?
12261680	12267440	What did she do? What did she do? What did my daughter do?
12270720	12274240	What did she do? What did she do? What did I miss?
12275200	12284160	Peeler did she just did she just end stream and then give you the audio of
12285200	12292880	the bruh bruh snitch it she didn't do anything
12295680	12296720	shut up shut up shut up
12297120	12302800	hey guys I knew it I knew she was doing it
12313280	12316000	she may or may not have been forced to. I'm like
12316880	12323600	Danny to join in too but I feel like my my peeler um isn't going to be very fun because I hardly
12323600	12329280	have any liquids because I sweat it from my hands and feet so much oh I need to clip that
12329280	12334560	actually I need to clip that fucking part of stream where the pop rocks popped to prove how
12334560	12340080	sweaty my feet are. I'm probably gonna have to make that clip myself actually now that I think
12340080	12347520	about it. Join them mommy the allegations are unfounded. No who hasn't tinkled yet?
12348320	12353120	I have not tinkled. Has Azura? I don't think Azura is tinkled.
12354240	12361840	Can we return to burpler and not be pissy? Honestly as long as the girls are happy
12361840	12369360	and uh you guys are happy then everyone's happy. Couldn't give less of a. Couldn't give less of a

12549520	12556880	like like check out these girls strongy there is an actual chance that this being an endurance
12556880	12562320	stream will get you to 6k I don't know if the video has got much steam right now you should all
12562320	12569920	hit the like and subscribe button right now exactly this weekly news was up um wait I could
12569920	12576720	let me show you what the stat says now on the video I'm happy I I don't mind I'm happy to share so
12577280	12584720	hold on let me screenshot this yes so this is what I see as the leecher on the other side of the map
12586800	12595040	um and then file save as blah blah blah too right so this was hold on I'm freaking accidentally
12595040	12600880	screen recording I keep actually on the screen recording I don't know why it does that oh hold
12600880	12606320	on the refunds are talking also hit the little bell icon see you guys are better at pushing that stuff
12606400	12613200	than me I like I forget to say like oh like and subscribe in this stream oh like I always forget
12613200	12619840	to say it even though I'm live for 12 hours I have 12 hours to remember to say one sentence
12619840	12624640	and I fail the challenge every single time you guys are just gonna have to do it in the chat for me
12624640	12632720	it's kind of ridiculous um right so this is currently uh oh I guess it didn't update so
12632720	12638720	you can see like all the stats wait I'll update it to the new one hold on um it didn't update too
12638720	12645840	much because I'm live so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before this is what it looks
12645840	12652720	like when you upload a youtube video these are the statistics you get you get your viewers you get
12652720	12658640	your watch time you get the subscribers that were directly earned from that video so people
12658720	12662720	discovered that video for the first time and they click subscribe because they really enjoyed
12662720	12671280	me pleading with you to let me hold it ASMR um the reason why estimated revenue is not visible
12671280	12676880	is because it takes 48 hours for that statistic to update if you guys really want to see it I'm
12676880	12683360	more than happy to share it doesn't bother me noon um I and then you guys can kind of see the fun
12683360	12691360	behind the scenes but uh yep um that's what it looks like it says the video has got 19.751 views
12691920	12698480	um like subscribe smash the smash the bell member to share the video yes um
12700160	12706000	but yeah that that is fantastic uh you can see the little trend if you see that right right side
12706000	12711680	trend and you can see when the video was released it had the highest viewpoint and then now it's
12711680	12719520	still actually going pretty strong it's it's not doing bad at all it really isn't um but yeah I'm
12719520	12726400	more than happy to show that kind of cool behind scene stuff uh you have went from 555 to 5.8 the
12726400	12732720	stream um like that video is like propelling me forward I'm hoping the same happens for the other
12732720	12740960	girls meme ASMRs because I am not putting any advertisement money into myself I had to at
12740960	12748480	debut because we kept getting called below the 1k and we needed the 1k for uh redirecting into each
12748480	12758640	other um crowdsourced self-promotion question mark oh my tummy's rumbling I forgot to get some
12759600	12768400	that's okay I can ramble for a bit more um but yeah I'm gonna miss the chat you're gonna miss
12768400	12774640	the fact the chat is slow oh no no no no no no no no no no no no you see I know how to gatekeep
12774640	12779120	myself and do you want you guys want to hear I'll repeat this story as many times as you like
12779840	12785440	if I start throwing out ASMR videos people are gonna subscribe for ASMR videos and then they're
12785440	12793280	gonna say oh strongy cuddles lives I'm gonna go listen in hold on a minute this this vtuber
12793920	12801280	is rantin about how we need to take down black rock this is an ASMR I'm not watching this shit live
12802240	12807760	and then they'll only just watch the ASMR videos and just like that I have gatekeep myself successfully
12807760	12815120	because I know how to do it so you're welcome you're welcome that's right I've been sitting on
12815120	12820240	this plan for a year and I will spoon it from the rooftop but that's the best part yes because
12820240	12826000	people will be like I want I want ASMR but you're not doing ASMR live stream and it's like no no I'm
12826000	12831600	not what you're gonna do about it you're gonna leave oh dear oh no might and what was it how do
12831600	12837600	you call it a tight knit community oh no my tight knit community terrible we're in shambles even though
12837600	12843120	I'm finding major success truly in shambles I'm on my knees but yeah you're welcome don't think that
12843120	12850240	will work for long well you'll be surprised um I've spoken to other ASMR creators especially
12850240	12861760	twitch ASMR creators um I had a friend who used to stream ASMR and she got 700 viewers concurrent on
12861760	12869680	ASMR and then she went and played a video game and she got 40 viewers and the entire chat was spamming
12869680	12873680	like someone would come in and spam when's your next ASMR stream and then leave again
12875840	12885760	tried and true I I'm aware this and it's gonna happen it's just it's just facts okay that logic
12885760	12892480	is flawed how dare you how dare you say I'm dumb even though I'm clearly dumb but I've seen it happen
12892480	12901280	on twitch yeah mm-hmm yeah it's not that uncommon for ASMR streamers to branch out yes no it's it's
12901280	12905200	it's a tactic because I'm always gonna be a gamer I'm always gonna be gaming every day
12905200	12910080	actually we're playing lego lord of the rings I can't keep quiet about it because I'm so excited
12910080	12918000	to share lego lord of the rings with you guys it's two back-to-back streams again I'm so excited
12918000	12926720	because on the first day we play through all the missions and and get like a hundred percent and
12926720	12931760	then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun and I'm so excited so yeah we get to play um
12931760	12936560	lego lord of the rings and and it's like one of my top games because it's just so fun and perfect
12936560	12941280	although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place I will show you what I am always
12941280	12944800	glitches out and it annoys me to high heaven because I have to let me play the game also
12945360	12952480	and lego lord of the rings is super good like will you still play hobbit afterwards yes um I'll
12952480	12963760	play hobo hobo 467 I'll play lego hobbit um at a later date it's not my favorite because if you
12963760	12968880	didn't know well now you're gonna know because I'm gonna insert my knowledge into your mind
12969600	12978720	um lego hobbit is only two games long and it just abruptly ends there's no public
12979360	12987120	um explanation that has been released um there are only theories as to why only the two lego
12987120	12997200	hobbit two hobbit first movies were made into the lego and not the third um but warner brother
12997200	13004880	bean shit heads um yeah it's just a mystery why the game abruptly ends at the two movie mark um
13006160	13012960	but it just is what it is um so unfortunately I do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way I
13012960	13021360	enjoy lord of the rings I apologize I do apologize um they lost the source code no I'm pretty sure
13021360	13030800	warner brothers were is it warner brothers it's one of them were being they were being very there
13030800	13035520	was a lot of production issues with the movie hobbit and then to base something off of the
13035520	13040480	movie to get the rights to do something it probably was just getting even worse like the
13040480	13047040	production issues on the hobbit were insane like um I've kind of spoken about it but Peter Jackson
13047120	13055200	he's the director he became so violently ill tending the fire for mummy thank you briefly um
13055840	13061760	he became so violently ill he like lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers honestly
13061760	13067440	I felt like Peter Jackson when we were developing gen one I was getting ill um I'll honestly convince
13067440	13072080	myself at a few points I was like this is it this stomach pain I feel right now I've done it I've done
13072080	13079120	a Peter Jackson and I've got myself a freaking ulcer in my stomach um do you like the hobbit yes
13079120	13085040	I love the hobbit movies I love lord of the rings and hobbit movies and we're gonna watch um if um
13086080	13091760	on christmas day we're watching lord of the rings extended and then on boxing day we're
13091760	13098480	watching the hobbit extended so I can sing all the songs um because buffer has an amazing song
13098480	13104720	when they're with the elves um if I can remember the first sentence of his freaking song
13104720	13112480	oh and oh and also had a tipsy cat who paid the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored
13112480	13116640	any quickness tune oh wait I'm I'm I'm skipping the lyrics someone needs to put the lyrics to
13116640	13128240	the ball for song oh well there's an end there's an end there's a merry old in beneath the old gray
13128240	13134720	hill and there they brew a beer so brown the man on the man himself came down one night to drink his
13134720	13143920	film oh the ulcer had a tipsy cat who played the five string fiddle he squeaked and he scored
13143920	13149760	any quickness tune and the landlord shook the man on the minutes after three he said I can't
13149760	13154000	remember the lyrics you'll need to put the lyrics so I can sing it but I freaking love that and I
13154000	13163760	also hate um and that's what bill bull baggins hates was it blunt the nice bend the forks
13164480	13168080	did and burn the corks
13170960	13178160	that's what bill bull baggins hates oh I love it so much and then obviously misty mountain far
13178160	13187680	over the mist misty mountains go I just forgot I'm supposed to be a dwarf when I sing I'm not
13187680	13190640	supposed to be all the way up here but I'm so excited I'm all the way up here but I need to
13190640	13192640	bring it back down here

13376640	13388400	that's planet air turns slowly it's hard to stay say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
13389120	13395920	actually I'm going to do a meme song cover and you guys inspired me during my James Cameron's
13395920	13404720	avatar stream and I am going to make a meme song cover of drumroll a secret tunnel but Scottish
13405280	13412560	and the artwork for it and someone drew a meme artwork of me which I need to reach out and ask
13412560	13421600	for permission to use for it um but someone drew me like going and then in the next frame
13421600	13430480	I'm blasting a Scottish beam and I want to use that artwork in the music video um so I'm going to
13430480	13436960	see if I can do it so basically two lovers I'm going to get someone to mix it so at least I'm
13436960	13444320	not monotone deaf on it forbidden be one another and I'm actually going to have to write the lyrics
13444320	13450640	out for the music video maker because they're going to be like what is Faye from Faye
13452080	13462960	uh secret tunnel secret tunnel through the mountain secret secret secret secret tunnel
13462960	13468320	basically it's going to be like less than 50 seconds but I think it's funny a little question
13468320	13472960	for mome are we eventually going back to needy streamer overload for other endings
13475520	13482480	maybe a membership stream I don't want to play games I've already done before but a short game
13482480	13487360	like that is very good for membership streams in my opinion and again if you're not membered and
13487360	13491440	you're listening please don't worry I stream for free every single day you get free content you get
13491440	13495760	content out of the wazoo with me okay just let me cook give me time I just need a bit time
13496480	13499760	just need a bit of time yes give me some time
13501760	13504080	yes a bit of time um
13506240	13512880	wait when are you planning to do the first membership stream next week once the schedule
13512880	13518720	goes up you will see the membership streams I will have it listed on the schedule there are
13518720	13524720	three membership streams next week they are all at different days as well to try and enable
13525440	13536880	members to try and get a little cheeky uh little cheeky um shot on a come in to join I will vary
13536880	13545120	the days as well and I'll vary the plots but it is a watch along a member ASMR and a tier list
13545120	13550560	rating for the first membership stream week we're gonna spend an awful long time on that
13550560	13555760	tier list rating so I do apologize it's gonna be a bit of an epic bit of an epic
13559040	13567680	thank you oh how's the toe um I I might I might be losing my toenail
13568000	13581840	so I went to the doctor man she goes up there all good um and um they've given me an option
13582640	13589120	they've given me an option I can either remove a side of my toenail or I can get the whole thing
13589120	13598320	taken off and they told me that um if I get the side of it taken off
13600480	13605440	because of the shape of my nails I have what's known as c-shaped nails I have no idea if anyone
13605440	13613120	listening knows what that means I have c-shaped nails which means I am more prone to this issue
13614000	13618720	so they basically said yeah ingrown toenail that was it that's what they said I thought
13618720	13625440	she cut into my skin but she cut into my skin and down the side of my nail which is why it was so
13625440	13634000	messed up so uh I have an option to either get it cut on the side a little bit or get the whole
13634000	13640000	thing taken off um and I've opted to get the whole thing taken off because I can't be arsed
13643680	13650080	would you still love me if I didn't have 10 toenails um they said it doesn't grow back
13650080	13658720	for some reason your fingernails grow back but your toes don't um so yeah I they said the risk
13658720	13665520	because of my nail shape the risk of me having this problem occurring is pretty high um but I
13665520	13670400	thought I had normal toes but apparently I have unique c-shaped toes wherever that means yeah
13670400	13677360	you still love me okay yeah for some reason if you lose your fingernail it will grow back
13677360	13684720	your toenails do not have this ability uh today I have learned um so I have opted just to get it
13684720	13693440	yanked off um it's coming up in a few days um I think after my buck shot roulette I am perfectly
13693440	13699040	fine to stream I asked I was like is this gonna put me toes built different literally I said is
13699040	13705280	this gonna put me like at a disadvantage like will I be able to um I need to be in bedrest
13705280	13716880	and they said as long as um it feels fine I feel well I am okay to set up um I am completely okay
13716880	13724560	to set up and stream because I was like I still want to stream smile um because uh yeah I'm just
13724640	13730800	asked if I needed bed rest but I don't need bed rest for it which is good for me um just means
13730800	13736640	we can paint your toenails faster honestly do you should I show what it looks like once it's
13736640	13743920	healed up they told me the healing takes a long time so I'm gonna be taking uh vitamins um I'm
13743920	13750080	also uh have been advised I need to go sit out in the sun for five minutes to get my vitamin D up
13750080	13756320	if you didn't know your vitamin D is what dictates if your scars heal faster uh if winds heal fast
13756320	13762800	not scars sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast it becomes a scar but um I looked up some pictures
13762800	13770480	of what toes look like that don't have a toenail it doesn't look that gross to me it just looks unique
13771920	13778720	um oh no the feet lovers are in shambles with me I'm so sorry if you're a foot lover I recommend
13778720	13786000	M.A.B. Zoo she's on a foot cam stream this week I'm afraid I can no longer take over um yeah
13787280	13792960	so um that's probably never gonna get a pedicure again I'm sure that surprises no one
13793760	13801200	the funny thing was I had looked up stories about going and getting pedicures done and I was like
13801280	13809760	oh that sounds so silly that's never gonna happen to me the one time I go and get my freaking toes done
13811040	13815840	but I'm not mad honestly I find it quite funny like some I know some people might be like oh my
13815840	13822160	god how are you laughing at this I don't know it's just funny like I feel like your body tells stories
13822160	13829600	and like my story is like oh I got a pedicure done for my reef lens and now I have nine toenails
13829840	13835760	like I think that's a funny story like I think that's hilarious like your body is telling all
13835760	13845120	these stories of all the fun you had in your life like I have a scar um on my boob um because I
13845120	13850320	handled a feral kitten uh don't recommend ever picking up a feral kitten but unfortunately
13850320	13855680	there's an emergency situation so I have a big scar uh a little uh well it's not big sorry it's a
13855680	13861040	light white scar that goes along my chest and I just think these kind of things are like
13861760	13867360	little funny things being like oh I remember when that happened uh I burnt myself on my mum's lamp
13868400	13872800	she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing and I burnt myself on it and I've got a burn on the
13872800	13878080	back of my elbow like I think these are like funny kind of things like some people might be embarrassed
13878080	13883440	about scars or things going on with their body but I'm like that's me that's that's what makes me me
13884400	13893520	um yeah I've got like a scar on my knuckle um because I rode my bike into a event at my grand's
13893520	13900880	house and it's like that it's just how I'm made up it's just part of me as a little child uh oh sorry
13900880	13907920	I just kicked the mic sorry I'm lifting my feet up hold on let me put my feet up yeah I don't think
13908000	13913680	anyone should be embarrassed um about like scars or your body like it's it's you it's what
13913680	13924240	makes you a silly goober um you know so my father was a gamers gotta kick it well you can kick me
13924240	13930640	again mummy well if I get a plushie I hope you're ready for the amount of ASMR you guys are gonna
13930640	13935840	see my hands so much if I get a plushie I'm not even kidding I'm gonna make so much hand cam ASMR
13938000	13943600	um yeah got a scar on my right pinky no clue right from Millie Tindley saying Brian
13943600	13951040	have appeared today to celebrate the life of strongest tone it died how it lived making content
13951040	13956240	honestly though I think that's like a pretty cool story oh wait I did that way to prematurely
13956240	13961920	pardon me thank you so much for the the tip reluctant to say yes I have it right now
13962480	13968320	um I did tell you guys I am on painkillers unfortunately it is it's throbbing and not
13968320	13976800	the good kind of throbbing um I got it assessed and booked me in um but like the doctor was super
13976800	13982480	lovely he was so nice um I've not had him as a doctor because I had normally have a chick doctor
13982480	13988080	and she's really nice um but like all the doctors in Australia you guys shout out to the to the
13988080	13992800	healthcare in Australia you guys are like actually nice what the heck you guys actually want to help
13992800	13998400	people with their problems what the heck um so yeah ripped to my my ill fable but I'll keep you
13998400	14005520	guys updated um it's after the buckshot roulette stream um so after buckshot roulette originally I
14005520	14009360	was going to do a foot cam I'm going to be honest I think I'm probably going to be on an ice pack
14009360	14013840	by the time we're on buckshot roulette I think we'll do heart cam for but uh heart cam no we will
14013840	14020720	not do heart cam that's just my chest um we will do heartbeat um I think Azura has a heartbeat monitor
14020720	14028320	on I was watching her play stardew and I'm like what's 86 what's 82 what's 76 what's 81 I was like
14028320	14035520	oh my god it's our heartbeat she has a heart rate monitor on I was like what open heart surgery
14035520	14043440	cam honestly the toe not growing back could be different per person whoa your toe came back
14043440	14049520	oh they told me what they need to do is like they completely I'm not looking forward to it though
14049520	14054000	because they said they have to do like two injections and then yank your freaking nail out which is
14054000	14061680	kind of gross but hey oh recovery I think they said roughly two weeks so if you guys really want to
14061680	14069440	see it I'll show you but yeah kind of gross are you squiddling me right now anonymous maybe a new
14069440	14077200	pedicure will fix the old one is that not how it works no anonymous sadly um the reason why I had a
14077200	14084000	plaster over my toe is because when they give you a pedicure they cut around the skin and they cut
14084000	14092480	your nails super short because they're going to apply gel to it and the girl accidentally cut into
14092480	14100960	the side of my skin and then cut into the nail itself which is why it's causing all these problems
14100960	14108720	and basically acting infected because it's now growing into my skin which sounds really gross
14108720	14117200	said it like that um but unfortunately um not happening my my poor ill fable
14119600	14124640	did they say anything about putting a chemical on it to prevent I think so I can't remember the
14124640	14131760	full conversation basically the conversation was like you've got this what do you want to do this
14131760	14135920	is what happens if you cut the side of it it's a possibility of coming back and because of your
14135920	14141040	nail shape it's much more likely to happen again or if you just get it off it's one and done you
14141040	14147280	don't have to come back um everything should be fine um I don't need antibiotics it's not like
14147280	14154800	that um it's just bad um so I uh I'm just like get it over and done with I'm like I want to be in
14154800	14159680	and out I want to be back streaming I don't want to have to like go back in and all that now it
14159680	14163680	literally I just said now just take the whole thing off take off we gotta go bald take it off we
14163680	14175520	gotta go bald um thankfully because I get to sit while I stream as opposed to someone who's forced
14175520	14183440	to stand while they stream question mark anyway um the healing process isn't an issue uh because I
14183440	14189200	explained I was like oh I'm I'm stronger uh I don't have to be bedridden for this and he was like
14189200	14195360	nah you're fine uh if you're sitting for the full day then just sit um I need to change the bandages
14195360	14201120	though which I'm a bit hmm I don't know if it's gonna be gross but I'll try my best to behave
14203040	14209520	uh don't worry even if it doesn't grow back I don't care yeah I still like my my nine toenails
14209840	14218240	um bandage changing oh you're feeling brave I think I think it's going to be very um
14220160	14226480	not pleasant you'll have to wrap the toe up when you take a shower I could probably take a bath
14226480	14231120	easier than a shower because I can just like dive into the water with my my leg out of the bath
14232240	14237680	mommy's streaming from the hospital bed I probably would I'm not even joking I'd probably
14238640	14242400	if I was ever in a hospital for a long time because of whatever reason
14242400	14247920	I'd probably just buy a gaming laptop and port my model on it and be like right that's so let's go
14247920	14252880	and then like the nurses come in and and they're like what are you doing I'm like oh don't worry
14252880	14258480	about it I need me a chat need me need me up my rooflings hospitals that's who would go hard not
14258480	14269200	gonna lie well we're almost at seven thousand fishies god we are getting through it the question
14269200	14274240	is are we gonna finish the fishes by the endurance well you keep streaming from the shows how you
14274240	14281840	raise the nurses for real for real why is it nurses are so caked up for like no reason I have a
14282560	14288640	that's it I'm becoming a nurse only to get an even larger rump okay I'm gonna become a nurse
14288640	14294800	so I can get a larger rump my friend had his removed forever ago it doesn't look that different
14294800	14301920	just an indent where the nail was okay so true nurses have that you can play old school rinscape
14301920	14308240	on your phone but I kind of stream it though oh it's the bunny reefling that I thought was telling
14308320	14315360	me to hurt myself because they gave me fish food and poison the one thousand and two smelly
14315360	14323840	socks in your bank that's reeflings giving me a bit but let's just say there was no there was no
14323840	14331680	ink left and then strong it's your body your decision but are you feeling you might regret it
14332000	14343120	I couldn't give less of a about my toes I'm gonna be honest um I don't uh they don't do anything for
14343120	14349360	me I don't paint them I I'm not very feminine in terms of getting my nails and you know toes done
14350160	14355760	it doesn't affect me they told me it doesn't affect my balance in any way my feet will adjust
14355760	14363200	very quickly to applying pressure while walking um I'm not trying to just miss your thing but
14364000	14372160	the fun part is if you put the mesh you stick thing on the bed if it comes off yeah um that
14372160	14378720	hurts to take that off yeah I just it doesn't bother me I've never been into doing my nails or
14378720	14383120	anything like I literally have fake press on nails to do ASMR with when I do show my hands

14560400	14565520	have you not been looking after yourself refling how are we supposed to look after each other
14567120	14575200	if you don't look after yourself that's right I'm gonna guilt trip you into looking after
14575200	14581200	yourself and there's nothing you can do about it I'm gonna it's over for you refling it's over
14581200	14587600	before it even started okay this is true real hmm well I've already been permanently affected by
14587600	14599280	you mom I stood at attention I turned up refling time to line up it's time for your daily inking
14600800	14607840	what hole are you gonna get it's a surprise that's terrible why do I see these things at
14607840	14614800	learn also me when my content gets limited ads hmm curious I wonder why
14617920	14622560	angst on you the game is rigged my name's already been refling for a week oh wait it has
14622560	14628080	literally because you're called refling in game well I like surprises sounds like a bit
14628800	14632480	the game is right from the start it's inking tame not yet
14635600	14640800	not yet because we like it the algorithm must be haunted
14643840	14650160	actually I need to tell the girls to be careful and say more substitute words so if you didn't know
14651040	14656320	youtube alt caption streams doesn't even matter for the full 12-hour reshoot triple alt caption up
14656320	14662400	okay and the problem with that is that's why you need to do substitute words because it will
14662400	14668400	identify the rate of things being said and it'll be so you can swear sometimes but if you swear too
14668400	14675680	much you're in trouble you know what I mean so I'll need to tell the girls to maybe do some
14676640	14679760	better just hear a really weird noise though is that in game
14684400	14685120	anonymous
14686240	14691680	strongy I was in a meeting at work today and my boss asked me if I was intentionally putting
14692640	14700480	no it's over for me I'm done for anonymous no way
14703360	14707680	anonymous no way you've freaking assimilated the slang
14709440	14713760	are you being saying like oh are you being saying that oh I instead of like yes
14713760	14721520	you're like mmm I can do that oh my god we're doing oh hang on can you um can you do this
14721600	14728240	excel sheet ah I can and they're all looking at you like what you didn't tell us you're Scottish
14728240	14735760	you're like uh uh uh just pull the old Brian assimilation any percent that's amazing
14739760	14746320	oh Amy's Vod is totally not going to be kept off even after editing out she's already on a warning
14746880	14751920	so I'm very worried about her and Amy at the stage I don't want to tell the girls like hey you
14751920	14757680	need to like knock it off because that's not fun for anyone sorry my microphone is just playing
14757680	14762000	a prank on me they're pranking me John the Scottish accent is funny until it's too late
14764400	14767520	to be honest I've started typing I a lot more
14767760	14768960	hmm
14771280	14775680	how do warnings work so none of the girls have a strike on their youtube channel
14776400	14785280	but they have a warning that lasts 90 days three months so if they were to do something against
14785280	14792000	TOS they get a full strike which limits them for a week they can't do anything for a week
14792720	14797040	um like they can't upload they can't update they can't do this they can't do that um
14798000	14806560	and I am a bit nervous but as soon as the warning expires at the 90 day mark um I think
14806560	14817200	all is good at that but what the heck is that what the hell oh my there's no way
14817440	14820160	I'll just hold on big ass he's right
14823600	14830160	um it's not messed up because it gives a warning and not a strike
14831520	14837760	but the length being 90 days is pretty rough I have to admit considering youtube haven't
14837760	14843200	announced their new updated TOS or their stealth TOS wherever you want to call it at this rate
14843200	14849520	um it's a bit messed up because they've updated it but because they gave a warning
14850160	14853520	if they gave a strike then yes I would agree and say that's really not
14854240	14860800	fair because you've not you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking is against the rules yet even though
14860800	14870320	you're applying it um type thing uh but yeah so I have to confess I've reached night nine cooking
14870320	14874880	three times before this stream you cannot have I only started like a week ago
14877840	14882960	you can't you mean before though like before you can't have done 99
14884400	14888560	because that's like they say it tastes like 81 hours to do 99 or something
14890160	14893840	oh Azura got a warning for Ian a QQ unfortunately yes like Azura
14894400	14900960	I don't know what's going on with Azura she wanted to do an exercise ASMR stream
14902000	14908480	and unfortunately management was like bruv you're gonna get a strike for that you literally
14908480	14914560	got in trouble for eating a cookie what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR working out
14914560	14921440	and it's such a shame because I never want to say no to the girls but I don't want to risk her
14921840	14925520	like her income because I know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be
14925520	14933920	I do not want to risk her monetization um like if she wanted to record it and upload it like on
14933920	14939520	Twitter that's fine I have no issues with that the cookie embargo honestly yeah the sounds YouTube
14939520	14947520	sucks um yeah she wanted to do workout ASMR but that would result in like heavy breathing in the mic
14947520	14953840	and huge I don't know what is going on at YouTube headquarters but it is absolutely
14954960	14959600	going to the dogs I wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't
14959600	14965040	instead of playing this weird guessing game of like oh but that's fine oh but that's not fine
14965840	14967840	oh
14973440	14982960	oh my god they very curious very curious well I got a thousand likes on that ASMR video hold on
14983680	14992960	in the money you may not have a cookie YouTube literally I think because Azura's voice is so
14992960	14999040	silky perfection in sexu is why she got walloped with it which is a shame because it's not fair
14999040	15006800	that's not fair at all um because that is just her voice I I'll tell you something in the interview
15006800	15012560	with her I thought she was putting it on and she was gonna like reveal her voice to me in the
15012560	15017680	interview no that's just her voice she's just straight up a goddess uh no questions asked
15018400	15020400	hmm
15021920	15028000	purple burglar and you're the second one you're the seven I see you see taking that
15029040	15035600	um literally punished her for a default voice I thought literally um there was a lot of actually
15035600	15040240	there's a really interesting thing about the uh introduce yourself videos a lot of people did
15040240	15045200	their character voice that they currently like do as a vtuber and then they were like
15045200	15052000	hi viewer and their actual voice um and it was quite interesting it was nice seeing the swap
15052560	15056880	um and I was convinced I was like oh Azura is like yeah putting on a voice and then I did the
15056880	15062880	interview and I was like oh I didn't even know people had goddess voices like this um do you
15062880	15066160	know how much money I would make with your voice yes thank you uh give it to me now
15067040	15073360	oh actually I was like if I could grab all the girls voices yank because uh you guys seen that
15073360	15078160	movie with a mermaid in it and where her voice gets stolen oh it's called the little mermaid
15078160	15086400	yeah uh her voice gets stolen there's a ha ha ha ha meat she did 40 push-ups yesterday and the noise

16119120	16126960	entire life oh being in debt bad debt bad and yet the most American infrastructure you have to put
16126960	16133040	a down payment to get a car type thing and debt you can buy things online in four installments
16133040	16144240	that's a debt and then the the worst offender of all mortgages mortgages are just normalized debt
16144240	16151600	for over for norm normalized debt enslavement there is no way you can guarantee you're gonna
16151600	16160960	have a perfect income for 30 years and it ah ah I could absolutely explode off the planet
16162400	16168560	um they also close your account if you don't use your card anyway oh sorry what are mortgages
16168560	16173680	so a mortgage is when you go to a bank and you say hello bank I would like to purchase this house
16173680	16182000	the bank will then own your house that you pay a monthly mortgage into with astronomical fees
16182000	16188480	over the years with the charged interest by the time you have finished off paying your lovely jubbly
16188480	16197120	25 year mortgage with interest you have paid an astronomical amount that isn't even houses aren't
16197120	16204560	even valued the materials of houses aren't even at that value the construction isn't even at that
16204560	16215120	value the entire system is rigged it is rigaton needs to high heavens do not ever feel embarrassed
16215120	16221680	about still living at home with your parents do not ever feel embarrassed if you're in real life
16221680	16230720	friends from high school or whatever have moved out are able to rent do not ever feel embarrassed
16230720	16239360	about any of these aspects you the system is rigged against you do not feel a shred of it
16240000	16249280	multi-generational living was incredibly common for centuries way before capitalism came into the
16249280	16255920	picture do not be embarrassed about living with your maw living with your grand that is your sense
16255920	16263280	of community is beautiful to even have that and I would absolutely love to see the uprising of
16263280	16270400	multi-generational households I would absolutely love to see the uprising of people going back to
16271040	16281840	another thing in world war one in world war two people on mass were instructed on how to grow
16281840	16290880	vegetables at home with the rise of supermarkets capitalism who here knows someone who grows
16290960	16299040	produce themselves I know no one I know no one that grows produce themselves
16299920	16307680	because of how how much lack of time people have maybe your grand might do it because she has time
16307680	16315280	because she's retired did you know how common it was to have a farm to have farm animals such as
16315280	16322160	chickens how common it was to grow even the most basic of vegetable such as potatoes such as
16322160	16334160	tomatoes such as peas okay you I want to see this become a thing I want another thing another
16334160	16342720	thing notice how tiny gardens are getting for houses hmm I wonder put your tin plastic someone
16342720	16349440	give me a tin foil png right now hold on tin foil png I'm not even kidding hold on let me cook
16350160	16356000	tin foil hat png get me on this right now get me on this right now I'm not even kidding we're doing

16366560	16374960	jeez louise one real png you look like a real p- oh you look like a real png hold on a minute
16375920	16386400	not club penguin tin foil hat png there's no way hold on hold on hold on oh pause pause
16387280	16396320	where is it hey let's go okay let's clip it to my my head hold on you feel like right and well um
16396320	16404160	at it sorry I just jumped up there in excitement um and well I'm at it hmm isn't it curious that
16404160	16410640	garden spaces for the average house have been lessening and lessening every year I wonder
16411440	16417600	do they want the people not to have the ability to grow produce in the means of their own production
16417680	16426160	for survival isn't that curious isn't that curious that flats but massive sky scraping
16426160	16432640	building blocks have no garden space so people cannot produce their own produce their own vegetables
16432640	16442480	their own fruits their own herbs so people are forced to rely on supermarkets yet again capitalism
16442560	16450800	strikes isn't that curious I find that so curious at this day and age with all these
16450800	16455840	advancements and buildings so many houses the garden spaces are getting so tiny you cannot
16455840	16462400	even have a produce producing tree and isn't it curious that even when there are fruit producing
16462400	16470160	trees um that they purposely don't have fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down
16470160	16475280	instead they use pollen trees um which are good I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs
16475280	16482080	but they never give free produce producing trees I freaking saw a story where someone um got given
16482080	16487200	lemons from the garden and she didn't know that you could just straight up cut the lemon open and add
16487200	16492960	it to the juice they thought it had to be produced isn't it interesting that in school you hardly
16492960	16498720	learn about the cycle of the farmers and how you never are encouraged to go to farmers markets
16498800	16502880	instead of the big freaking Tescos are big as their big this or big that
16503920	16510320	talk your shit damn straight I'll talk my shit isn't that interesting that you hardly even learn
16510320	16516880	about seeds seeds I will tell you about seeds right now to remember the three threat factors
16516880	16524080	of growing seeds it's what wot water oxygen temperature that is how you grow seeds
16524480	16531200	um the other part of fun is when Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds
16531200	16536960	and another thing there's states where you can't even collect rain water it is illegal to collect
16536960	16544480	rain water what would you use for rain water hmm you would water your own crops with rain water
16544480	16558320	bro the system is beyond bull don't look too deep into it or you're not gonna enjoy what you see
16559120	16565200	you have to look around and say we live in a society that's all we can do we flings
16566640	16573680	we live in a society amen okay i'ma get off my soapbox for a minute there
16574800	16581200	let me remove this asset no let me remove my tinfoil hat but don't think I won't put that
16581200	16588640	hat back on hold on actually I have this hat okay we can put this hat on we're back to meman
16591440	16598480	okay it's a bit wonky but that's really wonky right above calm down we live in a society
16598800	16605680	oh thank you for letting me rant about that but it makes you think wait it's illegal to
16605680	16613040	collect rain water yes but is that because it might drinking water might be contaminated
16613040	16621360	why do you think that's contaminated is it because these mega corporations bribe their way into being
16621360	16628080	allowed to pollute the waters did you know in the uk there is no swimmable rivers
16629920	16638640	that are not toxic for they're all actively being polluted in did you know that all in the name of
16638720	16648800	what reaplings capitalism shopping behavior sorry I took my tinfoil hat off zero yes zero
16653040	16656240	by the way I also have a friend who has like 20 different crops growing in his
16656240	16662880	basement so a garden is technically not needed and that should that gentleman be having those crops
16663200	16669600	right I'll get oh pardon me I'll get off my horse um I think I may need to eat for I haven't
16669600	16674080	eaten anything at all to do in fact I've only had a cup of tea and a half bottle of water it's not
16674080	16686640	looking good for me so yes um I will do another batch so when strong is farm airing on BBC
16686640	16691840	oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts yeah actually well I'll go back for a little bit
16691840	16696480	it's not too tinfoil hat during world war one and world war two where food scarcity was a thing
16697040	16700640	in the modern day age food scarcity is not a thing please do not be under the impression
16700640	16710000	is scarce is a lie um food scarcity was a thing so people were encouraged to grow farms and to do
16710000	16717440	very unique plots to do legumes to do potatoes to do cabbage the most staple foods you can imagine
16718000	16725520	and with the uprising of supermarkets people stopped doing it and who benefits who benefits
16725520	16733200	when we the individuals the small communities no longer grow our own crops no longer have
16733920	16742080	thingy we are fully reliant on the system which is not good you never want to fully rely on the
16742160	16747840	system but guess what if you don't want to rely on the system what do you need oh well you need
16747840	16754400	a plot of land to grow okay and you need time but wait a minute even if I fully outright buy
16754400	16761920	my plot of land wait a minute I still have to play some to pay some sort of yearly land tax
16762640	16770080	um towards the place that I'm living in because there's no place that's truly free there you can
16770080	16776000	you buy a house in UK and every year you pay council tax even if you don't participate in the
16776000	16782880	services that they provide um you do it in Australia they have a thing called land tax in America they
16782880	16790960	have a thing called something tax even when you want to fully no longer be a part of the system
16790960	16797360	they already got you hook line and sinker um and it doesn't matter what you do you can't escape it
16797360	16807680	anyway um that's me property ownership tax yet farmers are struggling yep so um every time uh
16809200	16815840	there is a there was a shortage in Australia recently this happened a couple of months back
16815840	16821920	now though um there was a shortages of eggs and the prices went up because there was a shortage
16821920	16825600	of course that makes sense so more people are wanting eggs but there's less eggs uh
16826080	16833600	hold on a minute what's going on here we're in the information age a major um a major
16834480	16841040	major um egg producer in Australia came out and said um actually there's nothing wrong with
16841040	16847680	production at all if you want to know the truth um they're actually not giving us um as much money
16847680	16852480	as they used to and yet the prices are going up and we don't get to see any of that benefit
16853280	16860640	are you telling me these mega corporations are artificially hold on let's be honest
16861600	16867920	are you telling me these mega corporation wait how is there two how did i do that hold on a minute
16867920	16876880	hold on a minute i need to put my tinfoil hat back on no it can't be that all these mega corporations
16876880	16885280	are actually hand in hand with one another no wait you mean the cost of living crisis
16885280	16892640	is actually artificial because if one shop raises their prices the other shop can justify that
16893440	16899760	but then the major no that can't be right because capitalism obviously brief what the
16899760	16905680	frick is that rune play that's very grand sitting on that table but that oh no that can't be right
16905680	16918080	no the good businesses aren't wait a minute coca cola owns all of the market wait but i thought
16918080	16925840	capitals and bread competition no no everything i've been told that's not right wait a minute
16926720	16933520	hmm something's not adding up coca cola seems to own literally everything wait a minute who is
16933520	16941920	the sole business owner because everything seems to be getting acquired wait wait a minute it's a
16941920	16948560	conglomerate everything is a fucking conglomerate and they can put up the prices as much as they
16948560	16956160	please because there's no true competition even if there were cheaper brands that wanted to get on
16956160	16964560	the shelves brands have to pay to be on the shelves in your common supermarkets holy moly
16966000	16974160	my head's spinning just thinking about how deep this rabbit hole goes maybe we should focus on the
16974160	16980320	one rabbit hole that's important to us and that's shebe's hole we love you shebe we hope you feel
16980320	16987840	better after your migraine what a way to end that okay okay i'll take the hat off i'll take the hat off

17512480	17514480	You've got to hold three minutes. I was away.
17514480	17517480	Day 100, still no mummy in sight.
17517480	17520480	She died of a leafling.
17520480	17527480	Oh boy. Do you hear it? Reefling's Blackrock is coming for strongy. She knows too much. And they are coming for you too. No!
17527480	17532480	Thank you for the tip boy.
17532480	17538480	No, I think I have got my mesh back.
17538480	17548480	I will refrain from any more tin foil unless you guys get me started again then I just can't help myself.
17548480	17555480	I have a can of cola. I have a honey tea which I need some help with the reference with.
17555480	17563480	I have a Nutri-Grain Bar, a Nature Valley Crunch Bar and a blueberry muffin. I can't really make it make a noise.
17563480	17569480	I can smack the bottom of the casing. I don't know if you can hear that.
17569480	17578480	But that is pretty much what's going on in my food. That's still too much.
17578480	17584480	I really remember it being that one. Maybe it's my head set. I wouldn't be surprised.
17584480	17587480	She came back. She loves us. Of course I do.
17587480	17593480	Remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back? That was rough. That was rough.
17593480	17596480	And then I come back. I come back even stronger.
17596480	17607480	Yes, for endurance streams it's not possible for me to prepare food. Unless I did it in advance but I'm a lazy fud.
17607480	17614480	So I've bought a load of drive food or food that is zero prep time.
17614480	17622480	I don't have any boiled eggs. I ate all my boiled eggs. And my meat sticks have kind of overstayed their welcome.
17622480	17627480	No, no, no. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin though.
17627480	17635480	I did not realise I had been streaming for five hours and I've literally had nothing but a cup of tea and a half bottle of water. That's outrageous.
17635480	17640480	That's how distracted you guys get me. That's how much I freaking love it.
17640480	17649480	Oh my goodness. I'm going to take a bite of my muffin. I do apologise if I'm not talking for a few moments.
17649480	17652480	I eat my muffin. Itadakimasu.
17657480	17663480	Oh my goodness. It's mason jelly.
17663480	17667480	Oh yeah, we distract you. Yeah.
17667480	17675480	I can't believe it. I can't believe we really enjoy each other's company. It's crazy. It's a crazy concept.
17675480	17681480	I honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber that hates our audience.
17681480	17684480	Why are you even streaming?
17684480	17689480	Because I'm pretty sure I have heard a few stories like that where they're like, oh I hate what I do.
17689480	17695480	I'm like, well if you hate what you do, go clock out and do something else. What the fuck?
17695480	17699480	You don't enjoy your time? The fuck? How can you not enjoy your time?
17699480	17704480	Actually, while I'm on my high horse about VTubers now, how can you not enjoy your time?
17704480	17708480	You dictated everything you get to do. You don't have to do a single thing.
17708480	17711480	If you want to play a game, play a game. If you don't want to play a game, don't play a game.
17711480	17715480	If you want to zazoo, zazoo. If you don't want to zazoo, don't zazoo.
17715480	17721480	Wait a minute. What's going on? I refuse to believe there's any VTubers that stream that actually don't like streaming.
17721480	17726480	Because you get to pick everything. Does that make sense?
17727480	17735480	The Elden Ring DLC comes out and I get to do nothing but play with you guys for, friggin, what?
17735480	17741480	Half a week more? Maybe more? Actually, maybe five sessions. I have no idea how big the DLC is.
17741480	17746480	I don't even know if they've given an indication on how big the DLC is.
17749480	17751480	I just want money for existing proof rule.
17751480	17757480	And another thing about capitalism. I'll stop. No more hi-hat. No more tinfoil for now.
17757480	17760480	I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories.
17760480	17772480	T minus one hour, I believe, for our lovely goat goddess, the goddess of fertility.
17772480	17778480	Or mummy, literally she is your mummy canonically, lore-wise. She is quite literally your mum.
17782480	17788480	It was enough to be nearly a full game. Okay, might need to change up my plan for the fourth week.
17788480	17794480	Do you want to hold it, strongy? The DLC. I want to stack donuts on it, and don't say no.
17794480	17799480	Okay, if it's like, wait, are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then?
17800480	17801480	Hmm.
17803480	17809480	If we do a full week of Elden Ring, on the fourth week, I will make up for any membership content.
17809480	17813480	Like, I will literally do back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back, member streams.
17813480	17817480	Like, you know, I'll do it. I'll do it to make up.
17819480	17822480	Shora, thank you for becoming a member.
17822480	17824480	And everything.
17824480	17827480	Does that sound like something you'd find in stacked donuts?
17836480	17841480	Oh, I tell you what, I was doing my research on a game that I might play.
17841480	17848480	It's called Boutro. It is a poker-type game.
17848480	17855480	And, unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with the old straight flush, flush, royal flush, or whatever.
17855480	17859480	The only flush I do is after I drop a big jobby in the toilet.
17859480	17867480	And I was, it looks pretty easy to play, in terms of me actually being good, that's a different story.
17867480	17872480	However, it looked like a cam to our game experience.
17872480	17876480	So, I was doing my research, I was watching people play, and I'm like,
17876480	17880480	Oh, yes, I understand none of this. So, I'm going to look at a few more tutorials.
17880480	17884480	But we might give Boutro a little try. I'll be one of my shorter streams.
17884480	17888480	Not the new Tinkle.
17888480	17892480	The guys, whenever you poop, do you always pee as well?
17895480	17897480	I think it's the same for guys.
17897480	17904480	I do know a secret, though. If you move your fireman's hose, your butthole clenches.
17904480	17911480	I've never been the same since I learned that fact on the internet. The internet has scarred me for that fact.
17911480	17916480	See, you're all twitching your buttholes right now, I can tell.
17916480	17920480	Reef flings. I can't believe you're doing it in unison.
17921480	17922480	Okay.
17922480	17926480	I have finished my mini muffin.
17926480	17930480	I'm going to open up my cola to wash it down.
17933480	17939480	Honestly, I was worried about eating on stream, but it's really easy to eat in Playbroonscape at the same time.
17939480	17944480	I twitch butthole for a moment. Reef flings together strong.
17944480	17950480	We can also manually twitch your fireman's hose, but can you do it without twitching the butthole?
17950480	17954480	No, you can't. Apparently, it's guys' biology that you can't.
17962480	17963480	Wah.
17963480	17966480	Wah, bit of cola.
17966480	17969480	Man, by the po- wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.
17969480	17975480	I was just calling me hypocritical because I just talked about corporations, and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola.
17975480	17980480	Man, as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild.
17980480	17985480	Who else is going to give me my sugary nectar?
17985480	17987480	What's that? I got you.
17987480	17994480	I'm currently open my nature valley. I have a bowl to eat it in because I just know it's going to go everywhere.
17995480	17999480	Wow, we're almost at a million eggs P.
18002480	18006480	Look, 730,000.
18010480	18016480	Tea? Did you just snipe that? I think he just snipped that little thing there.
18019480	18022480	I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley.
18022480	18026480	I thought a certain type of exercise could give you that kind of control over the muscles.
18026480	18029480	Do you guys want to do kegels together?
18029480	18035480	And whole, two, three, and release, two, three, and whole, two, three.
18035480	18039480	That's terrible. Don't encourage me. Don't get me started.
18039480	18045480	Not only will we have, oh my god, I'm trying to take the nature valley out without it crumbling everywhere.
18045480	18052480	I have the, I have a Canadian maple syrup flavor at nature valley.
18052480	18058480	I got a box that has like three different flavors inside and I just grabbed one because I had to tinkle.
18058480	18061480	Whoa, wait, how fast is this one?
18062480	18067480	Mmm, it's a ham. Oh, gosh.
18072480	18075480	I'm sorry if we got like eating time.
18080480	18087480	I'm off to buy groceries, enjoy the shop, try your best to shop local, smile.
18088480	18093480	Whoa, that's like respawn so fast. That's 30K every second.
18098480	18103480	Mmm, am I going crazy? Why is that spawning so fast?
18103480	18106480	Is it like in a van or something?
18106480	18113480	Mommy's through it, she doesn't need a lift of 22 million and I'm like, oh my god, is that 30K? That's amazing.
18114480	18121480	Mmm, yes, I'm enjoying. Is Gimli still fine? No, she's asleep. I'll just sneak around her.
18124480	18128480	What was that? Oh no, it wasn't me that leveled up. I take another big bite.
18128480	18131480	Wow. Wow.
18132480	18135480	Mmm.
18135480	18145480	Bye bye, don't worry if you have to go, this is an endurance stream. I did not expect anyone to sit for 12 hours with me on RuneScape Wall.
18145480	18147480	Mmm.
18147480	18152480	Someone's dropping them. Why would they do that?
18152480	18155480	How rather odd.
18156480	18161480	Is he just giving them a week?
18161480	18164480	But what if we wanted to?
18164480	18166480	Ah, we're not supposed to.
18174480	18176480	How bizarre.
18177480	18185480	Mmm, no, I think it might be bad for your health to watch me for 12 hours. I'm going to be gone in.
18185480	18188480	Mmm, 70.
18188480	18191480	Oh my god, we hit 70.
18191480	18198480	We're only just over the five hour mark. Can we do 80? Is that too much of a reach?
18198480	18201480	To do 80?
18207480	18212480	Mmm.
18212480	18218480	This shit fucking flaky is anything, man. Nature Valley, count your days.
18218480	18222480	That's outrageously crumbly.
18225480	18230480	Chat summary shocked you. What does chat summary say?
18237480	18242480	What's your favorite snack?
18242480	18251480	I don't even know, that's just too many to choose from. Something salty probably. It went from 70 to 76.
18251480	18256480	Good 6am morning, never woke up this early.
18256480	18261480	Wait, you're up early to watch the stream? Don't do that, get rest, you need rest.
18261480	18268480	Wait, where did the time go? Last I looked it was 97 minutes in. No.
18268480	18275480	Can you guys see what the chat summary says? Can you post it? Or is it not going to let you post it? Cause I can't see it.
18275480	18279480	Cause I'm strumming. I'm strumming my badge.
18280480	18285480	Ah.
18288480	18292480	I haven't played whole night, is it good?
18300480	18307480	Wait, well, that's what the chat... That's what the chat says?
18310480	18314480	That's what the chat summary is on my freaking stream?
18314480	18321480	Wait, wait, another conspiracy theory, but I did not mention that we want to take them...
18321480	18325480	Rockwell. Hold on a minute.
18325480	18329480	I went to play Old School RuneSafe, what's a good reason to give it a try?
18329480	18335480	Number go up, serotonin, every time number go up, yippee. That's your summary.
18336480	18341480	What's your favorite Pokemans? I don't know, there's too many.
18341480	18344480	There's too many Pokemans to decide from, and you know that.
18344480	18349480	There's literally, isn't there not like over a thousand now? I'm pretty sure.
18353480	18358480	Autism game, to be honest. No, is it actually?
18358480	18362480	Oh, you know who I like?
18362480	18367480	You know who I like, what Pokemon I like, but it sounds like a freaking racist name.
18367480	18370480	Sorry, that was so off topic.
18370480	18380480	Yeah, so there's this Pokemon called Qing Ling, and it sounds so racist, and I'm like, bruv, it's ridiculous.
18386480	18390480	But it's a cute Pokemon, I like the way it looks, it looks really adorable.
18390480	18393480	Yeah, the cute little bell one, yeah.
18393480	18398480	I just, the name just like, I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
18398480	18401480	17 point name, Burnry. Oh, it has gone down.
18401480	18405480	Only Tism Havers here, we only have Tism around these parts.
18405480	18408480	We don't have them functioning brains.
18409480	18412480	Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
18416480	18419480	Qing Ling is the sound it makes, what are you saying?
18421480	18426480	That sounds like a weird name.
18426480	18429480	My favourite Pokemon is Mega Yum.
18429480	18432480	I quite like, what's his name?
18433480	18437480	Is it Aaron? Aaron?
18437480	18441480	The wee Aaron guy, he's so cute and tiny.
18441480	18445480	And he eats Aaron, he's so cute.
18445480	18448480	You thinking of Penicillin, what?
18448480	18451480	Penicillin, Penicillin.
18453480	18455480	Absol, Absol?
18456480	18459480	Aaron is cutie.
18460480	18462480	Where am I getting distracted?
18462480	18467480	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not Mega, ugh, I'm not maxing on my swordy fishies.
18467480	18472480	I definitely am going to finish all the swordfishes though, which is amazing.
18472480	18475480	I'll need to go buy something at the Grand Exchange.
18475480	18479480	Sorry, if you heard my stomach rumble, they are illichid and internal fire.
18479480	18483480	Those plate bodies are getting suspiciously close to us now.
18483480	18486480	What an error, they're getting so close.
18487480	18490480	Mine is Nidoran.
18490480	18492480	Oh really?
18492480	18496480	I remember when Pokemon Go came out, I was really digging it.
18499480	18501480	Look at the bunny's dancing.
18501480	18505480	Oh, they're doing like a perfect, you know, I can't remember what it's called,
18505480	18509480	but that's like English culture when you stand around a pole and all dance around it.
18509480	18512480	That sounded like another type of dance,
18512480	18517480	but no, it's like actually English culture, like back in the old days type thing.
18519480	18522480	Why are we on the same wavelength again?
18522480	18524480	God damn it, streamer.
18525480	18527480	I'm just trying to, you can't keep doing this,
18527480	18530480	you can't keep saying everything that I'm thinking.
18533480	18535480	Gardevoir, Hypno-R.
18535480	18538480	I do, I've always enjoyed Gardevoir thoroughly.
18538480	18540480	Enjoyed Gardevoir.
18540480	18544480	Very cool, unique and different design.
18544480	18547480	Color scheme as well, very unique.
18547480	18550480	God damn it, how many plate bodies does this person got?
18552480	18556480	Oh my god, wait, everyone's like walking towards the, as well.
18559480	18561480	What, how much was that, 3 million?
18562480	18564480	Is this a refling doing this?
18564480	18566480	Am I going crazy?
18567480	18569480	What's plate body 4 for defense?
18569480	18571480	They are free.
18572480	18575480	But why give it away for free, didn't you know?
18575480	18577480	Are you squinting me right now?
18577480	18578480	What?
18583480	18585480	Thank you, boy, for the tip.
18585480	18587480	Wait, we can't both be holding at the same time.
18588480	18591480	Well, my hands are relatively small.
18592480	18594480	Thank you for the tip.
18596480	18599480	You probably like her art too, huh?
18599480	18601480	Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
18601480	18602480	One look.
18602480	18604480	Sorry, I only mow my hands.
18604480	18606480	Two hands is fine.
18606480	18608480	He keeps answering you strongly, but yeah, it's a refling.
18608480	18609480	Okay.
18611480	18614480	I think he's trying to give you a nice valuable thing.
18614480	18615480	It wasn't me.
18615480	18617480	Oh wait, am I supposed to chase after it?
18617480	18620480	I'm so sorry, refling, if I'm supposed to chase after it.
18620480	18622480	Oh my god, streamer distracted.
18622480	18624480	I'm so dumb, I'm a streamer.
18624480	18626480	I'm just a streamer.
18626480	18630480	I stream my life away.
18632480	18633480	Away.
18635480	18637480	I'm just a refling.
18637480	18642480	I stream snipe my life away.
18644480	18645480	Away.
18647480	18649480	68, 16 points.
18649480	18650480	Oh, the burn rate went up.
18650480	18651480	I got a little too excited there.
18651480	18652480	Hold on a minute.
18652480	18654480	I think it's because it's reset.
18654480	18657480	The burn rate will kind of go up until...
18657480	18659480	M.E.B. so you're under arrest?
18659480	18661480	That guy said it at the NPC says.
18661480	18663480	I'm focused on the grind.
18663480	18665480	You don't want me a grind?
18665480	18667480	Come on, mate, come on, mate.
18670480	18672480	Why would M.E.B. under arrest?
18672480	18674480	There should be pin pals under arrest.
18683480	18687480	I'm not really enjoying this bar anymore.
18687480	18690480	Rather flavorless, isn't it, bro?
18691480	18694480	I'm tempted to order takeaway, I'm going to be honest.
18694480	18695480	I'm like...
18695480	18697480	I'm doing an insurance stream.
18697480	18699480	I deserve a cheeky takeaway.
18699480	18701480	I'm such a good girl.
18701480	18703480	Why should I not get cheeky takeaway?
18704480	18706480	Pizza, nah.
18706480	18708480	Not pizza.
18708480	18711480	Australian pizza, I'm sorry, Australia.
18711480	18713480	And any Australian Muslim?
18713480	18715480	Australian pizza is...
18715480	18716480	No, thank you.
18716480	18718480	I've not had one pizza I've enjoyed here.
18718480	18720480	It's just full of grease.
18720480	18723480	The grease is dripping off the thing.
18723480	18727480	They could have blotted it or patted it or whatever, but they don't.
18730480	18732480	Cheeky little treat, perhaps.
18732480	18736480	I'm bringing you all with me as I buy a pizza before a storm hits.
18736480	18738480	Oh, you're actually getting a pizza in real life.
18742480	18744480	Didn't Emmy burn down buildings?
18744480	18749480	Look, Emmy needs XP in order to summon her brother back.
18749480	18752480	It's, look, whatever she does, as long as we can look the other way.
18752480	18756480	The fact she's not, actually, now that I mention it, the fact she's not even in jail.
18756480	18762480	How would she be evading jail when she just uses her magic on people who try and stop her?
18762480	18765480	Or maybe she has, like, influential magic.
18765480	18769480	I wouldn't be surprised if she had, like, turned the other eye type of spells.
18770480	18773480	Where it was like, oh, must have been the wind.
18773480	18777480	I wouldn't be surprised if she had access to that.
18777480	18779480	And her wee totems.
18782480	18784480	High charisma, yeah.
18786480	18790480	She has to rescue Nissan from the devil herself.
18790480	18792480	Like, Maggie Thatcher?
18792480	18794480	I think people were so confused.
18794480	18798480	They were like, why'd the devil herself, and then Maggie Thatcher?
18798480	18800480	And it was a surprise.
18800480	18804480	There was a Scottish person on the development team, and we thought the gag was hilarious.
18804480	18806480	So, there you go.
18810480	18814480	I drink a wee bit of cola, and then we're gonna get on my honey tea.
18815480	18817480	Any honey tears?
18817480	18820480	Me, me, I'm honey tea.
18821480	18826480	And we can just be a peeler on them, and...
18826480	18828480	Okay, they can't do anything.
18828480	18829480	I cracked up.
18829480	18831480	Wait, what was my joke?
18833480	18836480	Wait, what joke did I just say? Hold on.
18837480	18840480	Wait, what did I say? That was funny. Go again.
18840480	18843480	Go again, tell me, remain me. I'm ready for going.
18844480	18849480	Oh, the Maggie Thatcher.
18849480	18853480	Alright, sorry, I thought it was a pun. I'm not gonna lie, I had my fingers ready to do that.
18853480	18855480	Okay, my apologies.
18855480	18859480	I thought I made a pun, and I was like, what did I make? That was funny.
18859480	18861480	I forgot.
18862480	18863480	Okay.
18864480	18869480	Chewing fish and chips for my...
18871480	18873480	I...
18874480	18878480	So, do you want to hear the saddest story in all the land?
18878480	18881480	I really like Mexican food.
18881480	18883480	You know what I don't like?
18883480	18884480	cilantro.
18884480	18886480	And that stuff tastes awful.
18886480	18892480	Do you want to know what cilantro is primarily used in?
18893480	18896480	That's right, Mexican cooking.
18897480	18900480	Man, I hated you.
18901480	18905480	It tastes awful to me. Absolutely awful.
18905480	18907480	I tried a...
18907480	18909480	I tried a rice wrap.
18909480	18913480	I think it was Vietnamese inspired rice wrap.
18913480	18917480	No, rice cake wrap with chicken in it and all that.
18917480	18920480	And it sounded so good and I took a bite and I was like...
18921480	18928480	In Australia, there's a lot more access to Asian foods
18928480	18931480	that are authentic or really good type thing,
18931480	18934480	which is why I'm currently addicted to local Chinese.
18938480	18940480	And so, I've been adventurous.
18940480	18942480	I've been like, oh, I'll try this, I'll try that.
18943480	18948480	And I couldn't figure out why I hated it until I finally figured out it's cilantro.
18948480	18951480	I can't handle cilantro. It tastes nasty.
18951480	18953480	I'm so sorry.
18953480	18958480	I apologize to those who do enjoy cilantro.
18958480	18960480	Yes, I have the soap gene.
18960480	18965480	I cannot even describe to you how nasty and completely ruins
18965480	18969480	and any trace of it in the food completely ruins the food as well.
18969480	18974480	It is an unlucky and unfun gene to have.
18974480	18977480	Isn't it genetic?
18977480	18979480	I don't know if it's genetic.
18979480	18983480	My dad, I think, eats it fine.
18983480	18988480	Because one time he made, like, is it Pico de Mayo or something?
18988480	18991480	I'm so sorry. I think I butchered that.
18991480	18994480	He made it and I tasted it and I was like, this is nasty.
18994480	18995480	But I never said that to him.
18995480	18998480	I just said, oh, I don't think my taste buds agree with that,
18998480	19001480	but he never said anything because of the cilantro in it.
19001480	19003480	Pico de gallo.
19003480	19005480	Okay, sorry.
19006480	19008480	Pico de gallo.
19008480	19011480	Yes, I think my dad tried to make some of it at home.
19011480	19015480	And, yeah, I was like, hmm, nope.
19021480	19023480	I better buckle up in Pico.
19023480	19025480	No, buckle up in Pico.
19025480	19030480	I've had my fair share of absolutely horrific things I've consumed.
19032480	19034480	Where's the yellow thing?
19034480	19036480	Oh, that reminds me of it.
19036480	19039480	We need to do a watch along of Kevin Bridges.
19042480	19044480	Kevin Bridges is a Scottish comedian.
19044480	19046480	You might know someone called Frankie Boyle
19046480	19049480	or what's the other Scottish comedian's name
19049480	19052480	and I've forgotten his name and he's got Parkinson's right now,
19052480	19055480	but he's still alive, I'm pretty sure.
19056480	19060480	And he's got a beard and kind of big,
19060480	19063480	not curly hair, but wavy hair.
19063480	19066480	And he's older, oh my God, what's his name?
19069480	19071480	Billy Conley, oh.
19071480	19073480	Billy Conley.
19073480	19075480	It took me so long to get there, holy crap.
19075480	19076480	Billy Conley.
19076480	19079480	Hold on, I need to drink my tea before I get sick.
19085480	19087480	So I put far too much honey in my first team
19087480	19089480	and I put far too much little.
19089480	19091480	I can never find the balance.
19091480	19094480	Billy Conley is like real Scots.
19094480	19097480	I'm going to do watch alongs of like,
19097480	19099480	Scottish comedy so you guys can laugh
19099480	19101480	and I can be like,
19101480	19104480	why are the reeflings running in an X pattern?
19104480	19107480	So they are assigned each other to follow each other
19107480	19109480	which is causing this four way.
19109480	19112480	Oh my God, what are you doing over there?
19115480	19117480	So they're not actually clicking anymore.
19117480	19119480	Their characters are following each other
19119480	19121480	which is causing an infinite loop.
19121480	19123480	Which is pretty cool.
19125480	19128480	Wait, you don't pronounce the second Billy Conley?
19128480	19130480	Oh, Billy Conley, sorry.
19130480	19132480	Billy Conley.
19132480	19134480	I'm not good with names so don't expect any,
19134480	19137480	don't expect a miracle with me, okay?
19137480	19139480	It's a strong summoning ritual.
19139480	19142480	Down with black rock.
19145480	19146480	I love Kevin Bridges,
19146480	19148480	my brother served him at a local club.
19148480	19150480	Oh, that's amazing.
19150480	19153480	I really enjoy Kevin Bridges' humour
19153480	19155480	because it's quite deadpan.
19155480	19158480	British humour is quite deadpan
19158480	19160480	so we'll probably do a watch.
19160480	19162480	Again, sturdy with it.
19162480	19166480	Hold on, let me just get the fish out of the bank first.
19166480	19168480	Reefing getting sturdy with it.
19168480	19174480	Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah hiddah.
19174480	19176480	I love all these emotes in the game.
19176480	19180480	I haven't unlocked any more but other than the default ones.
19180480	19182480	Hmm.
19182480	19186480	This stomped-on Rottra really sells me on the cult vibes.
19186480	19190480	Aw, she be playing cult of the Lamb, did she finish it yet?
19190480	19193480	I think she was so close to finishing it at last I knew
19193480	19196480	but maybe she did it.
19196480	19198480	Ehm
19199660	19201660	Hydration
19203280	19208260	Gears are quid, oh you're getting stabbed. It's a great one. It is. Oh my god and
19209560	19215780	Oi fat boy right? I know this makes no I'm gonna. I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges is joke, okay?
19216280	19222220	So Kevin Bridges is a man, and he's quite large in size. I think he'd lost the weight since or whatever
19222220	19228580	but he said he was like 25 stone or something which is big and he was telling
19228580	19234100	the story where he's out late at night waiting on the bus and some net comes up
19234100	19240340	and goes oh fat boy Gia's a quid or you're getting stabbed and then he's
19240340	19244980	like I saw I start calculating my BMI with the other people around me type
19244980	19249940	thing and then he ascertains that it's him that's been picked on by this
19249940	19258900	person and he's like in order to avoid this heinous act against me for the
19258900	19264900	mere price of a quid and I think that's a pretty good bargain and so he did not
19264900	19269020	get stabbed that night that's the best I can do for telling the joke but it's a
19269020	19274380	really good joke I'll get us to do a watch along Kevin Bridges call the
19274380	19277780	lambs getting local co-op I know I'm gonna play it with sheebie and we'll force
19277780	19284020	her to play with me and he used to weigh about 350 pounds
19284020	19291380	there's an American place that lets you eat for free and if you're over like
19291380	19295860	heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry I look at videos a heart attack grill
19295860	19302780	I think it's so fascinating and there's like a way outside the restaurant and if
19302780	19310020	you are over that weight you get to eat for free I'm like wow 25 stone equal to
19310020	19318660	160 kg mm-hmm what you gonna do oh he says as he gets shanked I was a bit

19334580	19342980	buy some I have a terrible feeling they are a membership only item so we might
19342980	19346260	have to swap to a membership world which is a shame for anyone who's not a
19346260	19350020	member the heart attack griffin
19350020	19357300	mm isn't heart attack girl just a place because the owner hates fat people and
19357300	19363520	wants them to do what is that the lore or

20601960	20610000	in like oh no this is a lot and the next time we do runescape stream we are
20610040	20613360	gonna be watching a movie series so I don't have to talk and I can rest my
20613360	20616560	voice a little bit because I do have quite a few ASMR clubs coming up and I
20616560	20623120	need to keep my voice steady need my voice to be steady and ready wines are
20623120	20636440	like 480k if you're consistent per hour I mean it's alright you need 87k sword
20636480	20647000	fish so waitings are still faster in the end oh my gosh oh we flins I think I'm
20647000	20652200	gonna messed up picking cooking but I really want 99 I've never had my first
20652200	20660520	99 before I'm getting nervous I'm gonna shake you just drink back what's with a
20660520	20664000	ritual dance at the top of the screen those are reeflings they're just dancing
20664000	20670440	each other we're all hanging out of the fire remember level 92 is halfway stop
20670440	20684520	is it actually no I will not give myself that I'll see what happens after the
20684520	20693120	movie marathon xp wise it's halfway I know what happened to the legendary
20693120	20698680	stamina I'm getting nervous I don't know if I have an end in stamina now I'm
20698680	20703480	getting shaking way right empty boom boom
20703480	20710000	boy fat boom boom cooking is the fastest without completely rune like cooking
20710000	20719160	fish isn't it good that we'll be there with it yeah next runescape stream though
20719160	20723840	I'm gonna be watching movies so I'm not talking too much because my voice is
20723840	20730880	getting shredded but I love it can't help can't stop talking okay
20731440	20739160	well making wines is faster with the reeflings here 99 shouldn't be a problem
20739160	20748480	okay okay okay although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time
20748480	20755200	I spent I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking I don't
20755200	20760480	know if I'm gonna be able to do 99 cooking in one month though because of
20760480	20765200	the streams that I've got planned out it doesn't really work that well because of
20765200	20774760	Elden Ring because of Elden Ring I would have been able to put more time into
20774760	20780160	Rinscape but because of Elden Ring 99 cooking that's all because of a mediocre
20780160	20786920	joke that you're a whammin you got this Johnny we'll make you and we'll get
20786920	20794720	your master chef but it would be kind of cool to look back at like this the
20794720	20800480	stream thumbnails and see how much time it took obviously we did some questing
20800480	20803840	the first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for
20803840	20808800	everyone and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this night and so if I do
20808800	20814680	achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of RuneScape then pardon me I'm burping
20814680	20823240	away here I actually wouldn't mind and I wouldn't mind what I wouldn't mind doing
20823240	20826080	some more quests than again together because that's quite fun and it's more
20826080	20832760	interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a koambas I can
20832760	20837480	never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as and are
20837480	20846640	they better XP than wine is the question that need combat for that quest by
20846640	20857600	any chance 50 subs away from 60 stop is that video still getting traction yeah
20858600	20870600	sticking at my yet for the river only by tick manipulating right no if wait so
20870600	20878560	I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig oh no it's only faster if
20878560	20884120	you're paying attention I'm just doing wings for the rest oh this is terrible
20884120	20891080	stream content you guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines wait
20891080	20896800	so then why was that chick doing lobsters we're the one with a big jibblies out
20896800	20902480	why did she do lobsters for cooking is lobsters cheaper cheaper can always
20902480	20907880	switch it up yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish once this batch for minutes
20907880	20912600	I'll swap back to the swordfish just so like everything the reflins gave me and
20912600	20917560	being used up that seems like the wisest thing it's come oh yeah you're like
20917560	20926240	when I yeah for you oh yeah pull over your face your stomach your thighs fish
20926240	20932320	would be we floor but we less attention yeah I'm the Wayne attention batch is

20955800	20963760	no right I think we can finish off the swordfish and the Wayne also it was
20963760	20966680	actually really funny that you just straight up handed me like your wine

21448100	21454180	bother me none seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they
21454180	21457580	think they call the shots and it was like no you're at the mercy of your
21457580	21464900	workers let's let's not get it twisted let's not get it twisted are you doing
21464940	21469260	marshmallow later yeah of course I'll do marshmallow more than happy to I would
21469260	21473740	I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the
21473740	21482700	winds require a lot more and like fast clicking every time I move to the left
21482700	21490780	I need to do and I'm getting nervous now not to be a minger but when I tried to
21490780	21495540	go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried I'm gonna have to go toilet
21495540	21502300	in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet I normally take a
21502300	21514500	shower after I fell off my most thought what time come in here oops I will do
21514500	21520220	marshmallow it's not problem use your gamer bucket please do not ever type
21520220	21528420	again gamer bucket now pee bottles I can tolerate gamer bucket like Eric
21528420	21537700	Cartman style ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom ma'am you gotta go for a
21537700	21544180	job eh the birthday girl my team leader in quality assurance didn't sell their
21544180	21548180	their premiums since months because the workers are more made and didn't get
21548180	21554780	trained properly literally just because you in the manager position does not
21554780	21557820	make you a leader
21557820	21574340	magi playing runescape into 24 without a refunds you know the gamer bucket
21574340	21584780	yes yes on a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use
21584780	21596900	gamer ball I I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main
21596900	21603980	stinks actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor he forgot to
21603980	21607740	mention it what was that also if you try to do a last night name fletching your
21607740	21612020	wrist would die after a few minutes unless you learned mostly I don't have
21612020	21619980	that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it good dinner ruined
21619980	21629980	sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the sort the swordfish just
21629980	21635980	for a little bit because this is like one after the other your mace your face
21635980	21648700	melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses oh I don't have that
21649140	21653620	that's it how about we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh
21653620	21659680	my god you leveled up congrats I'm kidding by the way we're not born I don't
21659680	21663420	know how bad the box are in runescape I heard they're really bad in World of
21663420	21675260	Warcraft but bots apparently keep prices low and cheeky runescape so gamer girl
21675260	21681260	uses P-Bollies more long I'm already in trouble by YouTube actually should check
21681260	21687780	out wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish not well this is being in
21687780	21707220	the way I will check it after I've done this batch of wines which I just know
21707220	21710340	some people say like oh the reason why the box are actually good is because they
21710340	21714540	keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same
21714580	21720380	resources type thing and I was like honestly that is actually valid
21720380	21725340	feedback right we'll go down to five thousand water and then I'm gonna swap
21725340	21731780	to fish just to like use up all the fish because it's just and and I'll read
21731780	21744060	some marshmallow Q&A's if you want to say something say something sorry I know
21744060	21749460	I'm not doing that the good way but they there are bots that kill some of the
21749460	21757620	hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands yeah but keep runescape
21757620	21766260	economy from hyper inflating mmm can't believe it capitalism wins again even in
21766260	21773620	my video games and I can't escape didn't they just catch some box and wow by
21773660	21779500	placing a single rope oh wait I seem to remember something like that I think
21779500	21785140	you're right also just gold farmers who are boss they just sell the money later
21785140	21792700	on oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like
21792700	21799220	you get given the money or something because of the there's like a Venezuelan
21799220	21808100	meme so the Venezuelan Venezuelan economy went to shambles and and
21808100	21818180	basically it became profitable for those individuals to play runescape and sell
21818180	21822780	the in-game currency or something yeah my brains like can remember that they sell
21822780	21832220	on a third-party set for anyone which is against us oh okay okay okay I get I
21832220	21837780	guess it's against us on World of Warcraft as well that could be wrong I

22965820	22974300	you who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not
22974300	22978940	easy it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um
22981580	22987260	it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the
22987260	22994860	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months
22995660	23002860	and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're an
23002860	23009020	artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine
23009740	23020140	but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be
23020140	23025020	where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of
23025020	23030060	picking up the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage
23030060	23035980	like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it
23035980	23044140	just a nightmare nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually
23044140	23058140	850 um yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey well I still have two ideas for a gen two
23058140	23063980	what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon
23064060	23071100	there's no lollipop dragon feature bros curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything
23071980	23079580	also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional Japanese geisha who uses her own
23079580	23084540	self to make her clothes would be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea
23089180	23099580	uh I think I need a job I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going
23101580	23107340	hold on a minute refund uh I've a hydrate and then I'm gonna go for a few minutes
23110380	23115260	I think there's a loaf of bread in the oven if you know what I'm saying hold on any open up my
23115260	23119580	other bottle of water to hydrate you need hydrate to make it come out like easy
23122860	23127020	unmute so we can hear you screaming from the bathroom you scream when you take a job or
23131820	23137580	I'm so sorry I can like feel my my my bills shifting about and I'm like I don't
23140540	23147180	okay let's do one more bank run and I'll start cooking and then I'll mute because the toilet is

23447180	23449180	Just thought you should know
23451180	23453180	The amount of ink that just came out of me
23453180	23454180	Holy shit
23459180	23461180	So I don't mind talking about this cause it's got hands on
23461180	23462180	Check

23464180	23466180	When whamming ovulate
23466180	23469180	You get a clear ink that comes out of you
23469180	23471180	Produced naturally

23550180	23552180	I was a dino chicken

23557180	23559180	Oh thoughts
23559180	23561180	Not quite close enough
23561180	23564180	But a few more evolutionary factors in there
23564180	23567180	Multiple reefling
23567180	23569180	Producers, feature, activity
23569180	23572180	Sorry I'm starting
23574180	23577180	Well we have over 200 volunteers

23589180	23591180	I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream
23591180	23593180	But we're already a million XP
23593180	23595180	That's fantastic
23596180	23598180	Seriously we're making
23598180	23600180	I think the wines really is the vehicle
23603180	23605180	Aw someone said thank you for existing
23605180	23607180	You're so awesome reefling
23607180	23609180	Thank you for existing
23619180	23621180	Aw
23621180	23623180	I don't know
23623180	23626180	Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls
23626180	23628180	But they don't want any credit
23628180	23630180	But we are gonna upload the videos
23630180	23632180	You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it
23632180	23634180	Subtitling don't take long on
23634180	23636180	The videos are like 3 minutes long
23637180	23639180	So
23639180	23642180	Are the gen 1 models quintuplets
23643180	23645180	I like to joke
23645180	23647180	That I had the girls in my stomach
23647180	23649180	For like how long
23649180	23650180	12 months
23650180	23652180	Yeah I guess 12 months on the dot
23654180	23656180	Nearly there 598
23656180	23658180	Oh my god I owe you guys so much
23658180	23660180	There's some more videos I'm not even uploading the first one
23663180	23666180	I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though
23666180	23669180	To edit and upload the
23669180	23671180	First one
23673180	23676180	Oh my god problems are being an overachiever
23676180	23678180	For now
23679180	23682180	Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?
23682180	23684180	I don't think I've played it
23684180	23686180	But I've definitely heard of it
23686180	23688180	Game suggestion
23688180	23690180	Mad Rat Dead
23690180	23692180	It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo
23692180	23694180	How odd
23694180	23695180	Creaks
23695180	23697180	It's a puzzle game with a rare art style
23697180	23699180	The storyline is decent and you can use it
23699180	23701180	To interact with chat if you get sucked
23701180	23704180	I do it like when chat holds my hand through game
23704180	23707180	How'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab
23707180	23709180	Hopefully it works well for you
23709180	23712180	No whenever Azura talks to me
23712180	23715180	I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura
23715180	23718180	Whenever Azura talks to me via discord
23718180	23721180	Her make always cuts out and can't handle her
23721180	23724180	And I'm like Azura get that noise gate off
23724180	23726180	And she's like I've not got anything on
23726180	23728180	And I'm like what is?
23728180	23730180	Cause I can never hear her
23730180	23732180	I think the other girls can hear her
23734180	23737180	But I can never hear her when we have a collab
23737180	23739180	On discord or anything
23739180	23742180	And when she gets excited it cuts into her even more
23742180	23745180	But I don't know if she has discord fillers on maybe
23746180	23749180	Which is why I'm like ah Azura are you in that SteelSeries
23749180	23751180	Cause I've said to her a few times now
23751180	23752180	I'm not annoyed or anything
23752180	23755180	It's more like a meme where I'm like ah SteelSeries
23757180	23759180	Someone has sent me a cat box
23759180	23760180	Should it open up?
23760180	23762180	Fuck it I'm feeling risky
23762180	23763180	What is it?
23763180	23764180	It's a picture
23764180	23765180	Whoa!
23765180	23766180	Okay!
23766180	23767180	Yep
23767180	23769180	That's the picture alright
23772180	23776180	Okay I'm not gonna open up any cat box
23777180	23778180	Links
23779180	23780180	Well I'm true
23785180	23786180	Okay
23786180	23788180	Okay swordfish
23788180	23789180	Swordfish yes
23794180	23796180	Share it with a class male
23798180	23799180	Hi
23799180	23802180	Would you be okay with me using this whole smegment?
23802180	23804180	Smegment? Oh my god
23804180	23805180	I've got cocks on my mind
23805180	23806180	What the fuck
23806180	23810180	So small segment of the clapping audio for a meme
23810180	23811180	Yeah sure
23811180	23812180	If so would you rather wait now
23812180	23814180	Now you can post it it's fine honestly
23814180	23817180	It's cause it's gonna be publicly posted
23817180	23820180	It's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme
23820180	23821180	I'm so sorry
23821180	23822180	Ah frickin
23822180	23823180	That was
23823180	23825180	That would poke your eye out
23825180	23826180	That's what I'm saying
23826180	23827180	That's what I'm gonna leave out
23827180	23828180	That would poke your eye out
23828180	23829180	Um
23831180	23834180	Oh she's so damn bad just like us
23834180	23836180	Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are
23836180	23838180	Oh thank you Reefling
23838180	23840180	Strony
23840180	23841180	Reefling
23841180	23844180	I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow
23844180	23847180	I remembered you apologizing but no editing as much
23847180	23850180	I think at least in this case less editing
23850180	23852180	I think added to the quality
23852180	23855180	I'm so frickin glad you agree Reefling
23855180	23861180	I have been enjoying like not doing scripted stuff and try hard in
23861180	23862180	Um
23864180	23865180	Um
23865180	23869180	Like I have been enjoying recording ASMR
23869180	23873180	That isn't scripted and I'm doing it off the top of my head
23873180	23874180	Wait what do you say
23874180	23876180	There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say
23876180	23878180	Let me hold your fireman
23878180	23880180	Then wait let me hold your hose Mr. Fireman
23880180	23881180	It felt so natural
23881180	23883180	Cause of how frantic you were becoming
23883180	23886180	Yeah cause I did it all off the top of my head
23886180	23887180	Um
23887180	23890180	I don't know if it was scripted but you also yawned at one point
23890180	23892180	If it was intentional or adlib it was so natural
23892180	23896180	No I've been enjoying doing like non hyper edited
23896180	23898180	Super production of the wazoo
23898180	23900180	I've been enjoying doing like such casual
23900180	23902180	Um it's been so lovely
23902180	23904180	I've been enjoying it thoroughly
23904180	23907180	I really hope you enjoy the first like thank you for 1000 subs
23907180	23909180	Cause it's just me meemen
23909180	23910180	Um
23910180	23912180	I'm back from work
23913180	23916180	Okay but how many scrawny hands big was it
23916180	23918180	I mean
23918180	23921180	There wasn't a ruler in the picture but
23921180	23924180	From the glance I got before I closed it
23924180	23927180	It was pretty
23929180	23931180	I laughed so much in that part
23931180	23934180	I don't know if it was scripted or not
23934180	23937180	But if any of it was scripted
23937180	23939180	That kind of reinforces my point
23939180	23940180	So much of the audio scripted
23940180	23942180	Or not felt natural even the mistakes seemed
23942180	23944180	No no that was just me
23944180	23946180	That's just me being unable to read
23946180	23947180	Unable to read
23947180	23950180	Unable to formulate my thoughts
23950180	23952180	Into our proper sentence structure
23952180	23954180	I know it was just the meme but it was really fun
23954180	23956180	And good I think it would be neat
23956180	23958180	To do the natural style more
23958180	23959180	I freaking agree
23959180	23961180	I 100% am doing natural style
23961180	23963180	Open natural style
23963180	23965180	A
23965180	23967180	Six a lady
23967180	23969180	What
23969180	23971180	It was too early sorry
23972180	23974180	Okay we're all
23974180	23976180	As I said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish
23976180	23978180	And then we'll go back to wine
23978180	23981180	Just cause wine is so demanding
23982180	23984180	Um
23985180	23987180	If you want to help hold the hose
23987180	23989180	During a number one does that mean
23989180	23991180	I get to hold you up when you go number one
23991180	23992180	Bruh
23992180	23995180	I would go everywhere if you did that
23996180	23998180	Um
23999180	24000180	Strony
24000180	24002180	I felt it's imperative to let you know
24002180	24004180	There's a fortnite skin called Tropical Punch Zoe
24004180	24006180	That looks shockingly like you
24009180	24012180	I swear to god if I look like a fortnite character
24014180	24016180	If I look like a fortnite
24017180	24019180	Ahh
24021180	24023180	I can
24023180	24025180	I can cane to see it
24025180	24027180	I know what you mean with the bows on our heads
24029180	24030180	I get it
24030180	24031180	Yeah I get it
24031180	24032180	No that's not bad
24032180	24034180	Thankfully I don't look too much
24034180	24036180	Like
24036180	24038180	But I get it
24040180	24043180	Would only need to ask once to hold off
24044180	24046180	By the way the subtitles were actually fun
24047180	24049180	But why didn't you
24049180	24051180	Make someone else do them
24051180	24053180	Well when I do all that stuff
24053180	24054180	There's like
24054180	24055180	No
24055180	24057180	Subtitling takes so much time
24057180	24059180	It's just such a waste of money as well
24059180	24061180	Cause not everyone reads subtitles
24063180	24066180	To like outsource that work even further
24066180	24067180	Is just like
24067180	24069180	I'd rather just save the money
24069180	24071180	And spend it on the girls type thing
24071180	24073180	Because I could have sent that to an editor
24073180	24076180	And I could have sent that to a video renderer type thing
24076180	24077180	It's just like
24077180	24079180	I'll just do it myself
24079180	24081180	You know
24085180	24087180	Ooh I've got 14 more questions
24087180	24089180	Don't mind me
24089180	24091180	Or is it even a question
24096180	24098180	Let me know what you think of that in people
24098180	24100180	I'm not doing live reviews right now
24100180	24101180	Are you joking me
24101180	24103180	You guys are gonna like start hearing yourself
24103180	24105180	In the death of audio
24105180	24107180	On the topic
24107180	24109180	Conspiracy series
24109180	24111180	One game would be a hit to what you play
24111180	24112180	Disco Asylum
24112180	24114180	It's basically a spruced up visual novel
24114180	24116180	Where you play as a deeply
24116180	24118180	Schizophrenic police officer having a small
24118180	24121180	Solve a murder while constantly arguing with the voices
24121180	24123180	All that's interesting
24123180	24125180	Hold on that looks like nice and niche
24125180	24127180	Let me give that a cheeky go
24127180	24129180	Oh god I was preemptive again
24130180	24132180	We're at 4.8 on our
24133180	24135180	But nothing happens at all
24143180	24145180	Okay I can't open that on stream
24145180	24147180	But you know what you've sent
24147180	24149180	I love your long streams
24149180	24150180	I can do my thing
24150180	24152180	Even go to sleep when I'm back
24152180	24153180	And you're still there
24153180	24154180	Thank you for your work
24154180	24156180	Oh you're more than welcome
24156180	24158180	I'm glad I can help you
24158180	24160180	Get ready for working stuff
24160180	24162180	Listen to me in the background
24162180	24164180	And then I'm bing-ching when you get back
24165180	24167180	The kicking sound in old school
24167180	24168180	Runescape is printed
24168180	24170180	Oh do you want it off?
24176180	24177180	Do you want it off?
24177180	24179180	Or do you want it a little?
24180180	24182180	I can't even hear it at 2%
24182180	24184180	You know that 4%
24186180	24187180	There
24188180	24190180	I'm gonna like blast your ears
24192180	24194180	The voices in my head stop
24194180	24195180	Thank you
24195180	24196180	Wait why do you
24196180	24197180	Oh I like them
24197180	24198180	Ah please
24198180	24201180	Wait why do you guys not tell me so much earlier
24201180	24203180	I'm sorry I didn't mean to subject you
24203180	24205180	To such
24205180	24207180	Fallacies?
24207180	24208180	Fallacies?
24208180	24210180	I don't think that's the correct word
24210180	24212180	But I'm glad you're trying to use words
24212180	24214180	Outside your comfort zone
24215180	24217180	Hey Strone
24217180	24219180	Just wondering when you plan on sitting on my face
24219180	24220180	Right now
24221180	24222180	Lie down
24227180	24229180	Since AI is blowing up
24229180	24230180	Right now
24230180	24232180	Any ideas of implementing it in your content?
24233180	24234180	No
24234180	24236180	And do you even want to implement it?
24236180	24238180	I
24243180	24245180	The only
24245180	24247180	I wouldn't put
24247180	24249180	AI content
24249180	24250180	Like monetize it
24250180	24252180	I don't think that's right
24252180	24254180	I don't mind like AI memes of myself
24254180	24255180	Or something like that
24255180	24256180	Like that's funny
24259180	24260180	But like
24260180	24261180	Actually AI content
24261180	24263180	Like I wouldn't use AI content
24263180	24264180	On a thumbnail
24264180	24265180	And then earn money from it
24265180	24267180	Like I don't think
24267180	24268180	I don't think that's very nice
24268180	24270180	Because as a content creator
24270180	24272180	Like someone can literally
24272180	24273180	You know yank your voice
24273180	24275180	And then make money off of it
24275180	24277180	And it was like well why would I do the same
24277180	24278180	To someone else
24278180	24279180	Like that's not nice
24279180	24281180	You know
24281180	24283180	Can you hold it?
24283180	24285180	Do you think you can handle it?
24287180	24288180	And
24288180	24290180	Have you considered trading a chat box
24290180	24291180	From your stream?
24291180	24292180	Absolutely not
24292180	24293180	Are you kidding me?
24293180	24294180	That all that thing we'll see is
24294180	24295180	Use the other hole
24295180	24296180	Refling
24296180	24297180	Other hole
24297180	24298180	Other hole
24298180	24299180	Other hole
24299180	24301180	That all that chat box is going to say
24304180	24306180	I don't really use Marshmallow very often
24306180	24309180	If someone wanted to send you a bibliote
24309180	24310180	How it says
24310180	24311180	Oh you do
24311180	24314180	What's called a cat box link
24314180	24316180	And then you send me the link
24316180	24318180	And then I look at the link
24319180	24321180	And the rest is history
24323180	24325180	Hmm
24328180	24330180	ASMR Booth Hypnoscript
24330180	24332180	I've already recorded the
24332180	24334180	ASMR Booth
24334180	24335180	Plot
24335180	24337180	Which was funny as anything
24337180	24339180	I haven't
24339180	24341180	Done too much
24341180	24342180	Hypno
24342180	24343180	Because
24343180	24345180	Of Patreon's restrictions
24345180	24347180	But I do have a four part series
24347180	24349180	That will go up
24350180	24352180	On the alternate Twitter for free
24352180	24355180	Because it's not welcome
24355180	24357180	And the replacement audio
24357180	24360180	Is going to be my honey cup of tea
24360180	24362180	Oops sorry
24363180	24365180	I'm losing it
24365180	24366180	I don't know
24366180	24368180	I don't know why I'm like so sleepy
24368180	24369180	After eating
24369180	24371180	I thought you were supposed to get energy from food
24371180	24373180	You lied to me
24373180	24375180	Will you permanently scramble my brain
24375180	24376180	Pretty pretty please
24376180	24377180	Aw I can't do that
24377180	24379180	You're supposed to
24379180	24381180	Be having a good time
24385180	24386180	Just
24386180	24387180	Pinching
24387180	24389180	Hypnosis as a concept
24391180	24394180	Make great hypnotic focal point
24394180	24395180	As you sway back and forth
24395180	24396180	And burn yourself and down
24396180	24397180	Have you seen
24397180	24399180	The derriere VTuber models
24399180	24401180	That you can get
24401180	24403180	I wouldn't mind that honestly
24403180	24405180	I think that would be good
24406180	24407180	Hey mom

24471180	24472180	Litter box
24472180	24473180	Or something like that
24474180	24476180	Is for long enough
24476180	24477180	Asking for a friend
24477180	24478180	Replay

24524180	24525180	Who do I think I am?
24525180	24526180	Just wasting
24526180	24527180	Litter box
24528180	24530180	Is time for a cat box
24530180	24531180	Is the three days
24534180	24536180	Why is this website Japanese?
24536180	24537180	I can't speak Japanese
24537180	24538180	Can you speak Japanese?
24538180	24539180	No
24540180	24542180	Why did you pick a Japanese website then?
24542180	24544180	I thought you were the gamer of the six
24544180	24545180	Not a weeb
24545180	24546180	I still love you, you dork
24546180	24548180	The other websites that offer
24548180	24549180	This kind of Q&A thing
24549180	24551180	Are very broken
24551180	24552180	Cat box
24552180	24554180	Curious
24554180	24555180	Cat
24555180	24557180	Is very broken
24557180	24559180	So however
24559180	24560180	This Japanese website
24560180	24561180	Called Marshmallow
24561180	24562180	Isn't broken
24562180	24564180	It's actually very highly functional
24564180	24566180	Other than the filters
24566180	24567180	You have to be a smart level
24567180	24568180	Refling
24568180	24570180	And bypass the filters
24572180	24573180	Have you thought of more games
24573180	24575180	You can play in stream snipes
24575180	24576180	With the whole chat
24576180	24577180	In the future
24577180	24578180	After you get 99k
24578180	24579180	Absolutely
24579180	24580180	Every week
24580180	24581180	I plan on doing
24581180	24583180	Some version of a stream snip game
24585180	24586180	You burn swordfish
24586180	24587180	Until 80 on a range
24587180	24589180	And 86 on a fire
24591180	24592180	Yes, no
24592180	24593180	There's plenty
24593180	24594180	So Elden Ring
24594180	24595180	Is our next stream snip game
24595180	24596180	That we'll be doing
24596180	24597180	Tons of
24597180	24598180	November
24598180	24599180	I know it's quite far away
24599180	24600180	November
24600180	24602180	Definitely lots of Isaac
24602180	24603180	And
24604180	24606180	I was going to do
24606180	24607180	Drunk Apex
24607180	24608180	But everyone rolled their eyes
24608180	24610180	At me at the same time
24610180	24611180	So maybe not Drunk Apex
24611180	24612180	I don't know
24613180	24615180	Some sort of drunk multiplayer game
24615180	24616180	I think Valorant
24616180	24618180	Also gets shot on as well
24618180	24619180	And I'm like
24619180	24620180	But I can have
24620180	24621180	Four other
24621180	24623180	Reflings in the lobby
24628180	24629180	But you
24630180	24631180	Ugh
24631180	24632180	How do we
24632180	24633180	I guess
24633180	24634180	So sleepy after I ate that food
24634180	24635180	I don't understand
24635180	24637180	I had eight hours of sleep
24647180	24648180	Uhh
24652180	24653180	You didn't answer
24653180	24654180	The question
24654180	24655180	How BB is four enough
24655180	24656180	Yeah
24656180	24657180	Don't be silly
24657180	24658180	Of course it is
24660180	24661180	Are you going to have
24661180	24663180	A password set up on Elden Ring
24663180	24664180	So you can only summon
24664180	24665180	Reflings
24665180	24666180	Yeah, of course
24667180	24668180	Maybe call it shell
24670180	24671180	Or eyes
24671180	24672180	Because I hypnotise you
24672180	24673180	With my
24673180	24674180	Eyes
24676180	24677180	But yes
24677180	24678180	There'll be two
24678180	24679180	Good reflings
24679180	24680180	And one bad refling
24680180	24682180	Like an invader
24682180	24683180	So we can
24683180	24684180	We don't get a bonsai
24684180	24685180	Bonsai
24686180	24688180	I thought you needed ten hours
24688180	24689180	Maybe that's why
24690180	24691180	A big
24691180	24693180	It wasn't even a big meal
24693180	24695180	I literally had a muffin
24695180	24697180	In a nature valley bar
24697180	24698180	A cup of tea
24698180	24699180	A cold-out which I've not even
24699180	24700180	Finished in some water
24700180	24701180	And my brain's like
24701180	24702180	Okay, let's go down again
24702180	24703180	I'm like
24703180	24704180	Bro
24704180	24705180	We're not even halfway
24705180	24706180	Through this endurance stream
24710180	24711180	So I heard
24711180	24712180	Mummy was ovulating
24712180	24714180	Ambient refling
24714180	24715180	Cicero
24715180	24716180	Cicero
24717180	24718180	Cicero?
24719180	24720180	Refling
24720180	24721180	Did you take this correctly
24721180	24722180	Or did you take it so fast
24722180	24723180	You didn't
24723180	24724180	You didn't check
24724180	24725180	Your spell
24725180	24726180	And now I can't read it
24726180	24727180	Because I'm too dumb
24729180	24730180	Women are EP girls
24730180	24731180	I can't believe it
24731180	24732180	Someone said
24732180	24733180	Plop plop plop plop
24733180	24734180	Get pregnant
24734180	24735180	Get pregnant
24735180	24736180	Get pregnant
24736180	24737180	Yeah, you want gen two?
24739180	24740180	Johnny
24740180	24741180	I can't wait to be permanently
24741180	24742180	Under your influence
24742180	24743180	Oh wait, I already am
24743180	24744180	Under your influence
24744180	24745180	I can't get over this trance
24745180	24746180	Love you mumme
24746180	24747180	Love you refling
24749180	24750180	Someone says
24750180	24751180	I want you
24752180	24753180	Good thing I'm ovulating
24753180	24754180	I want you too
24754180	24755180	Refling
24763180	24764180	On your my fire
24764180	24765180	It's gone
24765180	24766180	I distracted the refling
24766180	24767180	So much we forgot
24767180	24768180	To keep up the fire
24769180	24770180	Thank you for the fire
24772180	24773180	GGs
24773180	24774180	That'll be well lasted
24776180	24777180	Even the runescaper
24777180	24778180	Is there one handed right now
24780180	24781180	Why do you stream at 4am
24781180	24782180	And why is this the time
24782180	24783180	You wake up to stream
24783180	24784180	Is it just a spay
24784180	24785180	Be in particular
24786180	24787180	No
24787180	24788180	Also thoughts on Aussie
24788180	24789180	AFL
24789180	24790180	Very violent
24790180	24791180	Very violent
24792180	24793180	I've seen some slaps
24793180	24794180	I've seen some slaps
24794180	24795180	I've seen some slaps
24795180	24796180	I've seen some slaps
24797180	24798180	I've seen some slow mo
24798180	24799180	Nox
24799180	24800180	Or the AFL
24800180	24801180	It's pretty scary
24801180	24802180	I want to go see a match
24802180	24803180	Like in person
24803180	24804180	Just to be like
24805180	24806180	I'm a real Australian citizen
24807180	24808180	Wink wink
24809180	24810180	Why do you stream at 4am
24811180	24812180	I stream at 4am
24813180	24814180	Because I'm normally
24814180	24815180	An endurance strummer
24816180	24817180	Wait, I'm not cooking anymore
24818180	24819180	And
24821180	24823180	If I need to go to a doctor's appointment
24823180	24824180	Or if I need
24824180	24825180	No DOOM
24825180	24826180	No DOOM
24826180	24827180	Refling
24828180	24829180	Or I need to
24829180	24830180	You know, go shopping
24830180	24832180	Or I need to go
24833180	24835180	See my Chinese grandma
24835180	24836180	At the shop
24836180	24837180	I look squid in mirror right now
24837180	24838180	Wah!
24841180	24842180	Oh, Brian doesn't read it out
24842180	24843180	Don't worry, I'll read it out
24844180	24846180	KFP Spidey says
24846180	24848180	Thank you for the stream so far
24848180	24849180	It's been great listening
24849180	24851180	While I pack for my move
24851180	24853180	I was also the red guy
24853180	24855180	Dancing at the saddle too
24856180	24857180	Thank you, Brian
24858180	24859180	And thank you
24859180	24860180	KFP Spidey
24860180	24861180	For the five
24861180	24862180	I appreciate it
24862180	24864180	I'm sorry, I can't do Brian's voice
24866180	24867180	I'm so sorry
24867180	24868180	I tried my best
24871180	24872180	My sister
24872180	24873180	Pleased in the AFL
24873180	24875180	She's messed up with a bump
24875180	24876180	She too
24876180	24877180	It is so dangerous
24877180	24878180	Like the head trauma
24878180	24879180	You can get
24879180	24880180	Or like cauliflower ears
24880180	24881180	If you get blunt force
24881180	24883180	Trama to your ears by the way
24883180	24885180	You get a condition called
24885180	24886180	Cauliflower ears
24886180	24887180	Where they like spike up
24887180	24888180	Spike up?
24888180	24889180	Did he spike up?
24889180	24890180	Is that right?
24892180	24893180	But yeah, thank you so much
24893180	24895180	But please do not feel forced
24895180	24896180	To hang about
24896180	24897180	If you're getting a bit tired
24897180	24899180	Azura Dooley is currently playing
24899180	24900180	Meow
24902180	24903180	Meow
24903180	24904180	A bit of stray
24904180	24905180	A bit of meow
24906180	24907180	Oh wait
24907180	24908180	No, not on the ashes
24908180	24909180	On the fire
24910180	24911180	Don't be silly
24911180	24912180	Scottlefish
24915180	24917180	What is Arsonist Rufland in?
24918180	24919180	The Wayne certainly helped
24919180	24920180	With the burn rate
24921180	24923180	Down to 13.7
24924180	24926180	Actually, yeah, you're right
24926180	24927180	I thought you were a meme in there
24927180	24928180	You said that
24929180	24930180	But no, I do not stream
24930180	24932180	At 4am to spay any Aussies
24933180	24934180	I do it because
24936180	24938180	I'm actually a knight
24938180	24939180	I will
24941180	24942180	Buy default
24943180	24945180	So it's actually quite helpful
24945180	24947180	That I stream at this time
24947180	24949180	If I were to stream at 10am
24949180	24951180	Because that was the other slot
24951180	24952180	Imagine being an Aussie at like
24952180	24954180	Oh no, shock of behaviour
24954180	24956180	Imagine getting granted citizenship
24956180	24958180	Wouldn't that be crazy?
24959180	24960180	Wouldn't that be crazy?
24960180	24962180	I say that as if I'm not going back to Scotland
24962180	24963180	You know that
24963180	24965180	Fuckin' spend how much money on that?
24965180	24966180	I'll say this again
24966180	24968180	If you ever want to run a business
24968180	24969180	And you're either
24969180	24971180	You can do it in the UK
24971180	24972180	Or you can do it in Aus
24972180	24973180	Do it in Aus
24973180	24974180	You will make
24974180	24975180	You will get to keep a lot more
24975180	24976180	Of your money
24976180	24978180	Because of tax purposes
24978180	24980180	If you set it up in the UK
24980180	24981180	You're just
24981180	24983180	Getting absolutely blasted
24987180	24988180	Brian should now work
24988180	24989180	On those super chats
24989180	24990180	If you want to replay
24990180	24991180	Wait, hold on
24991180	24992180	Can I replay?
24993180	24995180	Thanks for the stream so far
24995180	24996180	It's been great listening
24996180	24998180	While I've had it for my move
24998180	25000180	I was also the red guy dancing
25000180	25001180	At the start of the stream
25001180	25003180	Yay, Brian works though
25003180	25004180	Okay, I do apologize
25004180	25006180	To any super chatters who didn't
25006180	25007180	Wait, hold on
25007180	25008180	Wait, I can replay the super chats
25008180	25009180	Are you squinting me?
25009180	25011180	I love Stronee as my mommy wife
25011180	25013180	And she has boing bully
25016180	25017180	I wear her
25017180	25019180	Okay, these are replays
25019180	25020180	Wait, what?
25020180	25022180	Are you squinting me right now?
25023180	25025180	I love Stronee as my mommy wife
25025180	25027180	And she has boing bully
25027180	25028180	And she has boing boing
25028180	25030180	She has boing boing
25031180	25033180	Thank you, Brian, for your...
25035180	25036180	Oh, no
25036180	25038180	Is camp log refling gone?
25039180	25040180	Paramount camp log?
25040180	25041180	I can't believe it
25041180	25043180	I can't believe
25043180	25045180	My poor refling has things to do
25047180	25049180	Do you have a VR headset?
25049180	25050180	I don't
25050180	25051180	Not yet
25051180	25052180	It might be plausible
25052180	25053180	I'll be getting one
25053180	25055180	Because I think...
25059180	25060180	75?
25060180	25061180	Oh, my God
25061180	25063180	Members can now cook
25063180	25064180	Rock-aids fish
25064180	25065180	And
25066180	25067180	Bats
25067180	25069180	Are you squinting me right now?
25070180	25072180	Guess who's back, Stronee?
25072180	25073180	It's me
25073180	25075180	How are things going here?
25075180	25077180	I'm level 30
25077180	25078180	75
25078180	25080180	Sorry, I have numbered dyslexia
25082180	25084180	I was going so well
25085180	25086180	I'm at 75
25089180	25090180	Jack
25090180	25092180	Thank you for the two
25093180	25094180	I appreciate it
25094180	25096180	Wait, where the heck did that one go?
25098180	25100180	And tiny spain-ee
25101180	25102180	Tiny spain-ee
25103180	25104180	Thank you
25104180	25105180	For the...
25105180	25106180	Sorry, I'm a bit...
25106180	25107180	I'm not flustered
25107180	25108180	That's the wrong...
25108180	25110180	I'm just eating food at the bank
25110180	25111180	Sorry
25111180	25112180	I'm not flustered
25112180	25115180	I don't know why my brain is telling me to shut down
25115180	25116180	Right now
25116180	25118180	I'm literally in the middle
25118180	25119180	I'm like, I'm...
25119180	25120180	Can you not?
25120180	25121180	I'll tell you what
25121180	25122180	I'll order food
25123180	25124180	I'll order food
25124180	25127180	And then I will automatically stay up for that food
25127180	25128180	Because I'm like...
25129180	25130180	By the way, this is...
25133180	25134180	Oh, my God
25134180	25136180	I'm gonna say this in stream
25137180	25139180	The scriptmaster has just messaged me this
25141180	25143180	If I write something about Brocon
25143180	25144180	But
25144180	25147180	They do not specifically say Big Bro or Sis
25147180	25148180	But
25148180	25149180	Wait, what?
25149180	25150180	Or Big Bro
25150180	25152180	But make reference to the same...
25153180	25154180	Mother
25154180	25155180	Is that against the rules?
25155180	25156180	Yes, you can't say that
25156180	25157180	Yes
25157180	25159180	You can't say that
25160180	25162180	Try rephrasing, please
25164180	25166180	Don't worry, the scriptmaster has your back
25166180	25167180	That's all I'm saying
25167180	25169180	He knows the interests of the pinpals
25169180	25171180	And we're gonna try our best to...
25172180	25173180	Be up at port
25175180	25176180	But there you go
25178180	25180180	Strani, what if you want to get comfy in bed
25180180	25181180	And then get...
25181180	25182180	Oh, my God
25182180	25184180	Are you seeing that meme that's like
25184180	25185180	When you're...
25185180	25186180	What's it?
25186180	25188180	When your sushi roll is sad
25188180	25190180	Just take your sushi roll
25190180	25191180	And
25191180	25193180	Deer her down
25195180	25196180	Base script...
25196180	25198180	Bro, the script quality is gonna like
25198180	25199180	Go up dramatically
25199180	25201180	After the three month mark
25201180	25203180	You're gonna know when the scriptmaster came into play
25203180	25205180	Because you can tell it's like
25205180	25207180	Not me writing that shit anymore
25207180	25210180	You're like, oh, God, finally, Strani's not doing it anymore
25211180	25214180	I say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff
25214180	25216180	But I want to write my own stuff
25216180	25217180	Because I'm passionate about it
25217180	25220180	Not to say that scriptmaster isn't passionate
25220180	25221180	But I quite like writing my stuff
25221180	25222180	Because it feels...
25222180	25224180	It feels more intimate
25224180	25227180	When I can like do it between me and Beefling, you know
25227180	25229180	And we do it together
25229180	25230180	And I have you in mind
25230180	25231180	You are my muse, Beefling
25231180	25232180	You are my muse
25233180	25235180	Feed the fire for Mumme
25235180	25237180	Thank you
25241180	25242180	Oh, that's it
25242180	25244180	When your girlfriend is sad
25244180	25245180	Lira in a blanket
25245180	25246180	A ruler
25246180	25247180	Yeah, yeah, yeah
25247180	25248180	That's the one
25248180	25250180	Sometimes it's nice being a little bro
25250180	25252180	Well, little bros are for zero
25252180	25254180	Big bros in me
25258180	25260180	Yours are exceptionally good
25260180	25261180	Aw, that's very kind
25261180	25263180	I like...
25263180	25265180	I did have the option to hand over
25265180	25267180	My scripts to someone else
25267180	25270180	But I like doing it between us
25270180	25272180	Really need this fire
25272180	25274180	Making XP for real, for real
25277180	25279180	I imagine you and the other girls
25279180	25280180	Write their own stuff
25280180	25283180	There was a handful of girls
25283180	25285180	Who wanted to give their hand at it
25285180	25287180	I absolutely did not expect it
25287180	25290180	Because it's just more time
25290180	25292180	And I don't want the girls like
25292180	25294180	Stressing out over that kind of thing
25297180	25298180	But yeah
25301180	25303180	I just don't want to stress the girls out
25303180	25306180	If they want to do it of their own violation
25306180	25308180	Violition? Violition?
25308180	25310180	Then that's perfect
25310180	25312180	Did I just hear them?
25316180	25317180	I guess she's not happy
25317180	25319180	I fed her
25319180	25320180	Oh well
25322180	25324180	Day 10 of eating celery daily
25324180	25325180	It's so bad
25325180	25327180	Oh no, don't put yourself through
25327180	25328180	Celery for that
25328180	25330180	Celery is nasty
25330180	25331180	I've never enjoyed it
25331180	25332180	I'm sorry
25332180	25334180	Doesn't matter how much humus
25334180	25335180	You put on it
25335180	25337180	Violition? Violition?
25337180	25339180	Did I just say it funny?
25339180	25340180	Volition
25340180	25341180	Volition!
25341180	25342180	There's no I
25342180	25343180	Okay, we're getting there
25343180	25345180	Stopped to fluster us
25345180	25346180	Exactly
25349180	25350180	Oh my goodness
25351180	25352180	Violation
25352180	25354180	Oh no, now you're getting me confused
25355180	25357180	Yeah, I love your scripts
25357180	25358180	On Patreon Strony
25358180	25360180	Thank you!
25360180	25363180	I did them off the top of my head myself
25367180	25369180	I'll be very curious to see
25369180	25371180	What the donathon results in
25371180	25372180	I have
25372180	25376180	I imagine the week after the donathon concludes
25376180	25378180	I will be having very short streams
25378180	25381180	So I can focus on the rewards one at a time
25381180	25385180	I know some agencies had a bit of problems
25385180	25388180	Trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out
25388180	25392180	Obviously, because I'm such an unbelievable
25392180	25395180	Bad workaholic or good however you want to
25395180	25398180	Good for people who like content, content, content
25398180	25402180	Bad for the actual workaholic themselves
25402180	25404180	Because they just non-stop keep going
25404180	25408180	But I think I definitely am in a position where
25408180	25411180	I can get stuff out relatively quick
25411180	25415180	Whether that be an audio, a collab audio
25417180	25418180	Yeah
25419180	25421180	Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds
25421180	25426180	I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing forest streams
25426180	25428180	Short streams, like 10 hours instead of 12
25430180	25433180	For me, a short stream is 2 hours
25433180	25434180	Which I think someone said
25434180	25436180	That's literally what the regular stream time is
25436180	25438180	For the average YouTuber
25438180	25439180	And I'm like
25440180	25443180	2 hours is me doing stuff in the background
25443180	25445180	I'm not being funny
25447180	25449180	If you look and you see I've done a 2 hour stream
25449180	25450180	And nothing else that day
25450180	25453180	That means I am doing so much work in the background
25454180	25455180	Type thing
25456180	25458180	Is that these strony culls?
25459180	25461180	There's only one of them in this world baby
25463180	25465180	Time to cook through my 3k swordfish
25465180	25468180	Literally that's what I'm doing
25468180	25469180	Just getting through it
25470180	25474180	It takes her 2 hours just to start playing the lamo
25477180	25478180	Management got me there
25478180	25479180	Hydration check
25486180	25487180	Hi strony
25487180	25488180	In the most loving way possible
25488180	25491180	I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out
25491180	25493180	While you hmmm yourself
25493180	25494180	You're too hot
25496180	25499180	Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes
25499180	25500180	When you talk about other hot things
25500180	25502180	I need a moment to calm down
25502180	25503180	Oh my god Rythme
25504180	25506180	Got me blushing and shit
25506180	25507180	Stop
25508180	25510180	I'm glad I have that control of you
25511180	25512180	That power
25513180	25515180	Makes me very happy
25517180	25518180	I'm a bit too happy
25518180	25520180	I think I take a little bit too much
25521180	25523180	Pleasure from such a thing
25523180	25525180	Is that terrible?
25529180	25531180	I'm sure do have powers
25531180	25532180	Terrorist to boot up
25532180	25533180	What is this a Windows 95?
25533180	25535180	No cause I want to stop yapping
25538180	25539180	I love to eat sushi
25539180	25541180	I could do it for hours
25541180	25542180	Oh yeah
25544180	25545180	Is that because I'm a cutlery?
25547180	25550180	Oh I keep wanting to freakin make that
25550180	25552180	What does your Oshii smell like meme?
25553180	25554180	Because
25555180	25557180	The reason is
25559180	25560180	What's the reason?
25561180	25564180	Oh because I use a lemon scented soap
25564180	25566180	I wanted to post it and be like
25566180	25568180	This cutlery comes pre-seasoned
25569180	25572180	And then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it
25572180	25575180	And then everyone knows what the whole revealer smells like
25576180	25578180	6,000 subscribers reached
25579180	25580180	What?
25580180	25582180	We celebrated 5k
25585180	25587180	Oh my gosh
25587180	25588180	Fish
25594180	25595180	Ah
25604180	25605180	What?
25607180	25609180	I'm really excited
25618180	25623180	Why is it getting so hot?
25624180	25626180	I'm so confused
25626180	25628180	It shouldn't have been
25628180	25630180	Statistically yet
25630180	25633180	It should have only been pushed to 5k people
25633180	25634180	It's bizarre
25634180	25636180	I didn't expect that at all
25636180	25638180	Are you squiddling me right now?
25638180	25639180	Yeah
25644180	25646180	Thank you for the tip
25646180	25648180	Milk Cadmus
25649180	25651180	Any milk cadmets?
25651180	25653180	Thank you for saying it
25653180	25654180	I'm so confused
25654180	25656180	I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like
25656180	25658180	I can't believe it but under 24 hours
25660180	25663180	The one thing, I've mentioned this in another stream
25663180	25668180	The one thing I do not like about being a VTuber in this context
25668180	25671180	Is you have to play the numbered games
25671180	25673180	And you have to play the
25673180	25676180	Oh thank you for this
25678180	25681180	In terms of milestones
25682180	25685180	And it's a hard one to navigate
25685180	25688180	Because if you don't say thank you thank you
25688180	25691180	You look almost ungrateful
25691180	25694180	But if you do say thank you thank you
25694180	25697180	It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone
25697180	25699180	Just so you can spam thank you thank you
25700180	25703180	You don't have to say thank you
25703180	25705180	Well the problem is
25705180	25708180	I'm trying to get like
25708180	25710180	Gratis on 6k a moment
25710180	25712180	Thank you Luthe Reefling
25713180	25714180	The thing is
25714180	25717180	It would be really good to get on VTuber news
25717180	25719180	Or any kind of source like that
25719180	25722180	Because it brings more attention to the girls in general
25723180	25726180	Which is why it's like
25727180	25730180	I don't want people thinking I'm counting
25730180	25735180	But what I'm thinking about is the probability
25735180	25738180	That it could gain new eyes to the girls
25738180	25740180	Because I want nothing for them to succeed
25740180	25742180	I've got everything I want right here
25742180	25743180	I've got my Reeflings
25743180	25744180	We're freaking meman
25744180	25746180	We've got member streams
25746180	25747180	We've got multiplayer games
25747180	25749180	We've got ASMR
25749180	25750180	The Wazoo coming out
25750180	25751180	I've got collabs of other VTubers
25751180	25753180	That are willing to interact with me
25753180	25755180	Like I've got everything I need
25755180	25757180	I'm so freaking happy
25757180	25760180	I want the girls to achieve their dreams
25760180	25763180	And the truth of them achieving their dreams
25763180	25765180	Is one to have enough money to be a content creator
25765180	25767180	Some of them are looking to move out
25767180	25770180	Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own
25772180	25774180	You know, Emmie was fantastic
25774180	25776180	She's already designed her 2.0 model
25776180	25778180	Because it feels more like her
25779180	25781180	That kind of thing
25781180	25782180	I want the girls to have it
25782180	25784180	Some of them wanted 3D models
25784180	25786180	I wanted them to get it
25786180	25789180	And the truth of the matter is
25789180	25791180	In order to get these things
25791180	25794180	There needs to be eyes on the girls
25794180	25799180	So I can help them achieve their 3D goals and stuff
25799180	25800180	Although someone said that
25800180	25803180	Someone was like, what do you mean by the 3 year mark?
25803180	25807180	Whenever I mention the 3 year mark
25807180	25809180	Congrats to whoever leveled up there
25809180	25812180	Whenever I mention the 3 year mark
25812180	25814180	The reason I say 3 years
25814180	25817180	Is because statistically 3 years
25817180	25819180	And you're done
25819180	25822180	You're persona, you're whatever you want to call it
25822180	25823180	Emmie Bezos
25823180	25826180	Oh my god, you really look like Emmie as well in games
25828180	25833180	The reason why 3 years is this mysterious number
25833180	25834180	Placed on someone's head
25834180	25836180	Is because that statistically
25836180	25838180	If you do find success
25838180	25840180	By the third year
25840180	25843180	The success goes unless you make
25843180	25846180	You change your content up dramatically
25846180	25848180	And the reason I say 3 years
25848180	25850180	Is because
25850180	25852180	Before you're like wait
25852180	25853180	So Strongie's only got 3 years
25853180	25855180	Relax, stop doing it
25855180	25858180	Relax, no
25858180	25860180	No, that's not
25860180	25864180	It's very possible that Strongie and
25864180	25866180	Like once we're all satisfied
25866180	25869180	Like I won't stop until you guys are ready for me to stop
25869180	25870180	Like please don't
25870180	25871180	No, don't do it
25871180	25874180	But please don't think I'm just going to abruptly stop
25874180	25875180	Overnight
25875180	25878180	Like that's not the reality of the situation at all
25878180	25880180	It's very likely
25880180	25883180	I will want to focus on hypnosis
25883180	25886180	Audio is like way down the line
25886180	25888180	It's over
25888180	25889180	No, so never
25889180	25890180	No, if you don't want me to go
25890180	25893180	I'll be streaming in my little retirement home
25893180	25895180	Doing my thing
25895180	25898180	I've got an end in stamina
25898180	25901180	Like seriously this is
25901180	25905180	Just it took so long to get here
25905180	25907180	And everything worked out in the end
25907180	25911180	And it just feels so nice to be
25911180	25914180	I don't know, I just
25914180	25917180	Like to be accepted
25917180	25919180	To be just having fun
25919180	25921180	Folk want to hang out
25921180	25922180	It's just casual
25922180	25924180	It's none of this like
25924180	25926180	You know
25926180	25928180	Art say fart say like
25928180	25932180	Oh this VTuber is giggling their head off every two seconds
25932180	25934180	And this VTuber is like
25934180	25935180	Putting on this like
25935180	25937180	Horrifically fake personality
25937180	25940180	Pina, thank you for becoming a member
25940180	25943180	The first year is an introduction
25943180	25946180	The second is establishing and third is plateau
25946180	25948180	That is quite literally what it is
25948180	25951180	That is what most people experience
25951180	25953180	If you've ever been like
25953180	25957180	Why did that one in the VTuber
25957180	25961180	Go on a new account
25961180	25964180	That's basically remaking a persona
25964180	25966180	Because you plateau
25966180	25968180	And it's perfectly natural to plateau
25968180	25971180	There's no issue
25971180	25973180	Only 155 more
25975180	25978180	Thank you Peter Everingham
25978180	25980180	For becoming a member
25980180	25981180	I appreciate it
25981180	25983180	I'll be honest with you all for a sec
25983180	25985180	Let's see what's up
25985180	25987180	Question mark
25987180	25989180	What's up
25989180	25992180	Or does this refling share with us
25992180	25994180	We will
25994180	25996180	Strony until we die at 99
25996180	25998180	Because it's part of our little heart
25998180	25999180	I fart
25999180	26001180	Okay you're done refling
26002180	26004180	Deeply departed
26004180	26006180	He came and he farted
26007180	26011180	Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully
26011180	26014180	Without ever needing any variation in their content
26014180	26016180	I haven't seen examples of that before
26016180	26017180	Yes
26017180	26020180	I really like the behind the scenes psychology
26020180	26022180	About it all
26022180	26024180	Monster girls
26024180	26025180	Please
26025180	26027180	Thank you for becoming a member
26027180	26030180	Is that you asking for gen 2 designs to be monster girls
26030180	26033180	Oh boy you're in for a treat
26033180	26035180	Um
26035180	26037180	Yeah
26037180	26041180	There's been 2 designs that have been accepted
26041180	26043180	Lololololol
26043180	26045180	Um
26045180	26048180	Mods take some of his pennies
26048180	26050180	And scatter them across his home
26050180	26052180	Wait that's so specific
26053180	26055180	Oh I don't know
26055180	26058180	I feel like you feel happy streaming
26058180	26060180	I can see that
26060180	26062180	I can't imagine mome
26062180	26064180	Without this
26064180	26066180	There was obviously
26066180	26069180	Right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes
26069180	26072180	And you're not gonna like it but it's no longer the case
26072180	26074180	Because I got script manager in
26074180	26076180	If and when gen 2 came around
26076180	26079180	There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming
26079180	26082180	And trying to organize all the script stuff
26082180	26084180	Um
26084180	26087180	But thank you to script master for coming into play
26087180	26089180	Because without them
26089180	26091180	Being there
26091180	26093180	With gen 2 starting
26093180	26095180	I probably couldn't daily stream
26095180	26097180	So
26097180	26099180	That's the honest truth
26099180	26101180	I was gonna stream my ass off for an entire year
26101180	26103180	Like non-stop back to back double streams
26103180	26105180	On some days doing like endurance this
26105180	26107180	Endurance that
26107180	26109180	But thankfully that's no longer the case
26109180	26111180	Um
26111180	26113180	Obviously
26113180	26115180	When
26115180	26117180	Gen 3 were to occur
26117180	26119180	That's a lot
26119180	26121180	Of girls to manage
26121180	26123180	And I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams
26123180	26125180	Will be at that point
26125180	26127180	Is my only concern
26127180	26129180	And the thing is none of us have a crystal ball
26129180	26131180	To look into the future
26131180	26133180	So I can't tell
26133180	26135180	By 0 by 0
26135180	26137180	By 0 every day is a blessing
26137180	26139180	No don't cry don't do him don't do him
26139180	26141180	We're not even there we've not even
26141180	26143180	We've not even got the first model of gen 2
26143180	26145180	Literally we have fucking 2 approved concepts
26145180	26147180	That's the
26147180	26149180	Don't burn out in spite
26149180	26151180	See that's the thing spite can get you very far
26151180	26153180	Maybe I will
26153180	26155180	Spite everyone and just say
26155180	26157180	I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it
26157180	26159180	It's so jovert nyo
26159180	26161180	Less than 6kxp
26161180	26163180	For 80 million hp
26163180	26165180	And I'm just chillin here
26165180	26167180	Banned from shame
26167180	26169180	Braptuber allegations have not been been
26169180	26171180	No
26171180	26173180	The future in the game background is making me feel more
26173180	26175180	Okay no no no happy thoughts
26175180	26177180	Happy thoughts
26179180	26181180	If you can do this
26181180	26183180	In not even 2 weeks
26183180	26185180	I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year
26185180	26187180	I mean
26187180	26189180	It's not really gonna change
26189180	26191180	Sorry
26191180	26193180	This is
26193180	26195180	Me having happy times
26195180	26197180	We do have some monthly events planned
26197180	26199180	Um
26199180	26201180	Type things
26201180	26203180	Going on got ASMR collabs planned
26203180	26205180	I think ASMR is like a bread and butter
26205180	26207180	Please
26207180	26209180	Please consider ASMR
26209180	26211180	As a bread and butter viewer
26211180	26213180	Some people kinda get annoyed when ASMR
26213180	26215180	At ASMR
26215180	26217180	VTubers dabble
26217180	26219180	In ASMR and don't always like commit to it
26219180	26221180	Fully but no it's bread and butter
26221180	26223180	I think everyone's gonna be participating in it
26223180	26225180	Juicily
26225180	26227180	Can you spit on us
26227180	26229180	Yeah you want me to spit all over your face
26231180	26233180	Open it
26233180	26235180	Open your mouth
26235180	26237180	Let me spit on your face
26237180	26239180	Um
26239180	26241180	Yeah don't
26241180	26243180	Don't worry like
26243180	26245180	Ah frickin you know how open and honest
26245180	26247180	I'm gonna tell you what it looks like
26247180	26249180	And what things are like and you know
26249180	26251180	People who do watch you can get little
26251180	26253180	Tip bits of information
26253180	26255180	Early access information
26255180	26257180	VTubers ASMR
26257180	26259180	Finally someone combined two of my favourite things
26259180	26261180	Well I actually got a lot of feedback
26261180	26263180	Where people were like
26263180	26265180	I am so tired of like VTubers
26265180	26267180	Blue bowling
26267180	26269180	And they'll participate in something
26269180	26271180	And then withdraw
26271180	26273180	And
26273180	26275180	Because they never really had a thing for it
26275180	26277180	And I was like oh my goodness
26277180	26279180	Aren't we hitting the
26279180	26281180	Hammer on the head with a nail
26281180	26283180	And the nail on the head with a hammer
26283180	26285180	Wait other way around
26285180	26287180	Finally hitting the nail on the head with a hammer
26289180	26291180	Because
26291180	26293180	It's quite literally
26293180	26295180	Like all of us are completely fine
26295180	26297180	Thankfully things are coming
26297180	26299180	A member

26445180	26447180	Takeout honestly

26493180	26495180	Honestly
26495180	26497180	Maybe that would work out
26497180	26499180	I feel like that's got potential
26499180	26501180	A wee bit of potential not too much
26501180	26503180	Get your hands off

26589180	26591180	Pick the memes right
26591180	26593180	And it's probably got a lot of potential
26593180	26595180	I thought about doing like
26595180	26597180	Reading the most bizarre
26597180	26599180	Reddit stories
26599180	26601180	Cause there's a really famous one
26601180	26603180	Where this guy broke both his arms
26603180	26605180	But I can't say the rest of it
26605180	26607180	But I wanted to read it
26607180	26609180	Cause I thought it was alright
26609180	26611180	But I'm not sure it would work out
26611180	26613180	Maybe it would be like a twitter series
26613180	26615180	I guess
26615180	26617180	I'll be like oh go subscribe to my youtube
26617180	26619180	My youtube

26741180	26743180	Didn't you get
26743180	26745180	With all the girls at the same time
26745180	26747180	In the ASMR booth with the eyes covered
26747180	26749180	Yeah basically that's how it happens though
26753180	26755180	But yeah I've got a sea queen audio
26755180	26757180	I think it'll be a donut on reward
26757180	26759180	Like cause the girls
26759180	26761180	Are all gonna like help each other out
26761180	26763180	With their donut on rewards like
26763180	26765180	As a
26765180	26767180	As a like yeah let's go
26769180	26771180	Sea queen that's the only way we can
26771180	26773180	That's the new saying
26775180	26777180	POV all the girls are fighting over you
26779180	26781180	The one human left on earth that hasn't
26781180	26783180	Decided on which girl
26783180	26785180	I thought about
26785180	26787180	I see an Emmy doing something like that
26787180	26789180	Where they're fighting over
26791180	26793180	Where the ink goes
26793180	26795180	Or who the ink goes to
26799180	26801180	Sea queen
26801180	26803180	Yeah I mean that's pretty creative
26803180	26805180	I'll give you that that's pretty creative
26805180	26807180	Yeah I see an Emmy with a hundred percent
26807180	26809180	Fight over it but I find it really
26809180	26811180	Hard
26811180	26813180	To do that kind of
26813180	26815180	Seven
26815180	26817180	Five hundred swordfish and I burned two
26817180	26819180	K of them I burnt so much swordfish as well
26819180	26821180	Don't worry
26821180	26823180	Where the ink goes yeah
26823180	26825180	If Emmy and I see ever collab like that
26825180	26827180	I would be so happy
26827180	26829180	I mean they already got a collab audio on the way
26829180	26831180	Of that nature
26831180	26833180	But it's a bit
26833180	26835180	Different
26835180	26837180	Do you want spoilers or do you not want
26837180	26839180	Spoilers I don't mind doing spoilers
26839180	26841180	I think it's coming up
26841180	26843180	Is it August the collab audio start
26843180	26845180	Of I think it might be
26847180	26849180	It's got to be really hard to do
26849180	26851180	I want spoilers
26851180	26853180	No spoilers
26853180	26855180	Oh no you guys are split
26857180	26859180	Go hard with spoilers
26861180	26863180	So in the plot
26863180	26865180	Close your ears if you don't want
26865180	26867180	Any spoilers in the plot
26867180	26869180	AC and Emmy fell out
26869180	26871180	And you
26871180	26873180	The listener
26873180	26875180	You can either be a pin pal
26875180	26877180	Or a snowberry
26877180	26879180	You force them to
26881180	26883180	To make up
26883180	26885180	By
26885180	26887180	Using a massage gun
26887180	26889180	To relieve their muscle tension
26889180	26891180	Because their muscle
26891180	26893180	Tensions the reason why they fell out
26893180	26895180	Hmm
26895180	26897180	Hmm
26897180	26899180	Okay
26899180	26901180	Then me and Mercy have one
26901180	26903180	Where we're
26903180	26905180	Nurses that shouldn't be qualified
26905180	26907180	Because of what we do
26907180	26909180	And then
26909180	26911180	Azura and Sheeby's one
26911180	26913180	I don't think the masses
26913180	26915180	Are gonna like it
26915180	26917180	I'm not gonna change it
26917180	26919180	Because I like the script
26919180	26921180	I like it but I'm not sure the masses
26921180	26923180	Are gonna like it
26923180	26925180	Can Sheeby
26925180	26927180	Catch you in public
26927180	26929180	Um
26929180	26931180	Cross-grossing
26931180	26933180	And they m-word you
26933180	26935180	And I don't know if it's gonna
26935180	26937180	Go down well or not
26937180	26939180	It's a very unique scenario
26939180	26941180	But please
26941180	26943180	And before you're like oh my god I hate it
26943180	26945180	Oh my god Strony I hope you die in a fire
26945180	26947180	Because you wrote that
26947180	26949180	Do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again
26949180	26951180	Don't be so silly
26951180	26953180	The first one that I gave
26953180	26955180	Yeah it was pretty sp- it was pretty
26955180	26957180	Out there I don't know it's just the
26957180	26959180	Inspiration I got to write for them
26959180	26961180	Till I wrote it and there it was
26961180	26963180	And they what
26963180	26965180	Holy moly this is spicy meatball
26965180	26967180	A massage gun yes
26967180	26969180	A massage gun I'm excited for that
26969180	26971180	It's spicy
26971180	26973180	Oh boy that one does sound very uh
26973180	26975180	Yes uh
26975180	26977180	That sounds like something
26977180	26979180	Patreon would get no they don't
26979180	26981180	They don't care um
26981180	26983180	I know what's uh good
26983180	26985180	To go and what's not good to go on Patreon
26985180	26987180	So damn y'all really pretty
26987180	26989180	Yeah
26989180	26991180	There's a few things I wanted to cover um
26995180	26997180	Having the freedom to explore a
26997180	26999180	Bunch of scripts
26999180	27001180	Is something the scripts have
27003180	27005180	Yeah like um
27005180	27007180	It's just different things were hitting along
27007180	27009180	The way like as I said
27009180	27011180	I kind of said it from the start
27011180	27013180	I'm not pigeon
27013180	27015180	Holding any girl
27015180	27017180	Into a particular
27017180	27019180	Category because doing so
27019180	27021180	Will limit their
27021180	27023180	Income source and their income source
27023180	27025180	And longevity are related
27025180	27027180	To their success of the allure
27027180	27029180	And I do not want
27029180	27031180	To kneecap anyone
27031180	27033180	That's not fair
27033180	27035180	It is what it is
27035180	27037180	In spaces scenarios compared to anything else
27037180	27039180	I've seen this is some top two content
27039180	27041180	Yes and
27041180	27043180	Literally when the girls do collab audios again
27043180	27045180	They still have three other audios
27045180	27047180	Going out that month as well so it's not like
27047180	27049180	You know not everything can be for you
27049180	27051180	We live in a society
27051180	27053180	Of burnt fish
27055180	27057180	I like to try different stuff yeah
27057180	27059180	Literally just give it a shot either
27059180	27061180	You'll listen to it and you'll be like this isn't for me
27061180	27063180	Or you'll be like okay
27063180	27065180	I'm reacting
27065180	27067180	Smile
27067180	27069180	There's only two outcomes
27069180	27071180	It's either no thank you and turn it off
27071180	27073180	Or I'm reacting smile
27075180	27077180	We'll get
27077180	27079180	We'll all get something at some time
27079180	27081180	Yeah basically literally everyone
27081180	27083180	Is here for
27083180	27085180	It's not possible
27085180	27087180	For a creator to come out with something you love 100%
27087180	27089180	At the time it's just not possible
27089180	27091180	Unless they do the same thing over and over
27091180	27093180	Again but then that is like
27093180	27095180	Really pigeonholing and it's
27095180	27097180	For the success of my girlies
27097180	27099180	Okay
27099180	27101180	They gotta succeed
27101180	27103180	Or what's gonna make them wanna sign their
27103180	27105180	The second year of the contract huh
27107180	27109180	Can't wait to find out
27109180	27111180	What it is I love
27111180	27113180	AC and Katelyn so much
27113180	27115180	Aw I'm glad
27115180	27117180	Thanks
27117180	27119180	Thanks for reading it
27119180	27121180	Anyway
27121180	27123180	They just misspelled
27123180	27125180	Something that said it wrong or something
27125180	27127180	It's okay
27127180	27129180	I'm not into feet but I like curious
27129180	27131180	Oh yeah
27131180	27133180	I love everything
27133180	27135180	Viewers done so far thank you
27137180	27139180	You know I had a year
27139180	27141180	In the making and
27141180	27143180	Just everything has fallen into place
27143180	27145180	So beautifully
27145180	27147180	I spoke to
27147180	27149180	I'm gonna butcher her name
27149180	27151180	So badly
27151180	27153180	The beach of her obaque
27153180	27155180	That's definitely not how you say it
27155180	27157180	But
27157180	27159180	She was talking about a project
27159180	27161180	Finally coming together and
27161180	27163180	You know I was like oh I can completely
27163180	27165180	Relate to that so I replied to it
27165180	27167180	And I was like
27167180	27169180	When the puzzle pieces finally arrive
27169180	27171180	And you can start slotting them into place
27171180	27173180	It's so satisfying
27173180	27175180	And
27175180	27177180	And I felt that to my very core
27179180	27181180	Obaque
27181180	27183180	Yeah it's not obaque
27183180	27185180	There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it
27185180	27187180	Sounds like I'm trying to say tobacco
27187180	27189180	Obaque
27189180	27191180	That's exactly how you say obaque
27191180	27193180	Oh wow
27193180	27195180	Not me
27195180	27197180	Accidentally being smart
27197180	27199180	I can't believe it
27199180	27201180	Obaque
27203180	27205180	It is the first try
27205180	27207180	I'm so smart with the heck
27207180	27209180	Yeah she put up a tweet
27209180	27211180	Saying her projects are finally coming together
27211180	27213180	And I'm like oh I can relate to that
27213180	27215180	On such a deeper level
27217180	27219180	And
27219180	27221180	When we succeeded to be
27221180	27223180	Five moods ahead in her main chess game
27223180	27225180	I can't wait to
27225180	27227180	One be one years in chess actually
27227180	27229180	I'm not ready
27229180	27231180	Tobacco stream
27231180	27233180	No, no tobacco
27233180	27235180	I can't smoke
27235180	27237180	I can hardly drink
27237180	27239180	To the life of me
27239180	27241180	I get one beer in me and I'm gone
27241180	27243180	That's why I wanted to do drunk apex
27243180	27245180	Because we can all do Salt Lake city server again
27245180	27247180	Because no one's in it other than us
27249180	27251180	I don't know what drunk game
27251180	27253180	I wanted to do drunk game
27253180	27255180	But I don't go offline until we win
27255180	27257180	Type of thing
27257180	27259180	But I didn't know what game to do
27261180	27263180	If I lose
27263180	27265180	I get to see discord route
27265180	27267180	What?
27269180	27271180	Wait
27271180	27273180	What if you lose the one be one chess
27273180	27275180	You get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff
27275180	27277180	To each other
27277180	27279180	Say no in that one chief
27281180	27283180	I've been a lazy reflin
27283180	27285180	You haven't
27285180	27287180	Have you not checked any of them out
27289180	27291180	Actually the highlight
27291180	27293180	Reels are from debut
27293180	27295180	Or right around the corner
27295180	27297180	I think there's one more girl that needs to be made
27301180	27303180	And then the debut highlight
27303180	27305180	Things can be made
27307180	27309180	Can be uploaded
27309180	27311180	Check them out
27311180	27313180	What opening do you use in chess
27313180	27315180	I call it the twat move

29145180	29147180	No he won
29147180	29149180	I can't go back
29149180	29151180	And won't let me go back on him
29155180	29157180	Right okay what can I do
29157180	29159180	I can't even go forward or anything
29159180	29161180	I just did that
29161180	29163180	Game ends when all the pieces are taken
29163180	29165180	How can they be taken
29165180	29167180	We can't go backwards
29167180	29169180	I don't get it
29169180	29171180	I'm so confused
29171180	29173180	He's not won yet
29173180	29175180	What
29175180	29177180	I don't know what's going on
29179180	29181180	Wait so if he comes here
29181180	29183180	I can only jump forward one
29183180	29185180	Oh
29187180	29189180	This is too hard
29189180	29191180	Oh no what happened
29191180	29193180	Something changed
29193180	29195180	I don't know
29195180	29197180	So I can't go backwards
29197180	29199180	I can only go forward
29199180	29201180	Well then I might as well push forward then
29201180	29203180	Surely
29203180	29205180	Surely that's how it works
29207180	29209180	Okay
29209180	29211180	And now then I take you
29211180	29213180	No I can't take you
29213180	29215180	You're too far away from me
29217180	29219180	Then I push you forward
29219180	29221180	To play
29221180	29223180	I guess
29223180	29225180	No I don't one at a time
29225180	29227180	Sorry one move at a time
29227180	29229180	Apologies one step
29229180	29231180	Oh this is so hard
29231180	29233180	Oh no my guy got taken
29233180	29235180	Wait how do you
29235180	29237180	So I can only go one way
29237180	29239180	Then that would push
29239180	29241180	What that pushes him there
29241180	29243180	And then I can't push up so I need to do that
29243180	29245180	Oh no that blocks him
29245180	29247180	Oh I didn't mean to do that
29249180	29251180	What does a knight do
29251180	29253180	I don't know
29253180	29255180	I'm not sure
29255180	29257180	Can he take everything now
29261180	29263180	And then can go backwards
29263180	29265180	Oh wait
29265180	29267180	So I just need to move him forward
29267180	29269180	Like here
29269180	29271180	Okay I'll push him forward
29271180	29273180	Oh he got taken
29273180	29275180	Wait hold on I'll push him forward then
29275180	29277180	Wait am I going to perish
29277180	29279180	I think I'm going to perish
29279180	29281180	I don't think I can win
29281180	29283180	And then you move up
29283180	29285180	Oh no I didn't mean that
29287180	29289180	And then I push up
29289180	29291180	And then what
29291180	29293180	What happens then
29293180	29295180	In the head
29295180	29297180	Yeah I'm not winning that one

29347180	29349180	Oh no this Riefling is thinking
29349180	29351180	You're not supposed to think against me

29365180	29367180	I don't know what he's doing
29367180	29369180	I can't see it if he's doing something

29373180	29375180	Here
29375180	29377180	I don't know what Riefling is planning
29377180	29379180	Riefling is planning
29383180	29385180	I'll take that then
29385180	29387180	You're not getting a 4 in the rule of me
29387180	29389180	I don't know
29389180	29391180	If I do this

29683180	29685180	I'm ready for Friday.
29686180	29689180	Okay, I'm going to be eating and doing this at the same time.
29689180	29691180	So you must forgive me if I'm extra dumb.
29691180	29694180	Thank you the tonnethou for the two.
29694180	29696180	I'm currently getting wrecked at RuneScape.
29697180	29700180	It's not looking good. How do I counteract this?
29700180	29702180	I need to go here.
29705180	29709180	And then I need to stop you from making a four over here.
29710180	29712180	This is such a big...
29713180	29718180	I got a chicken wrap with sugar.
29718180	29720180	Why are you so tall?
29720180	29722180	I feel like I'm going to lose this one as well.
29722180	29724180	You feel like I can't do it?
29726180	29729180	Oh my god, I'm eating chips and it's so good.
29731180	29733180	It's so yummy.
29737180	29739180	Chicken wrap with sugar?
29740180	29742180	Wait, is that a thing?
29742180	29744180	No, it's just a chicken burrito wrap.
29745180	29747180	Oh no, this is a lot of red.
29747180	29750180	I don't like it. I see red, I see red, I see red.
29751180	29753180	Here?
29754180	29756180	I don't know what I'm doing.
29760180	29762180	I'm too busy munching.
29763180	29765180	Delicious.
29766180	29768180	I said sugar. Oh, I said oh sugar.
29768180	29770180	I said oh sugar instead of oh.
29773180	29776180	I'll stop you right there criminal scum.
29783180	29785180	I'm not going to mess this up.
29785180	29787180	No, you're going to play there.
29787180	29789180	What? How do you not play there?
29793180	29797180	No, you smell my fricking connection.
29798180	29800180	I don't really want to place it there.
29803180	29807180	I wasn't even paying attention.
29807180	29810180	No, come on man.
29810180	29813180	Come on, I'm getting rolled.
29813180	29815180	Are you squiddling me?
29815180	29816180	Who do you please me?
29816180	29818180	Please share, mama.
29818180	29820180	Oh, you guys not Ian, thank you for the tip boy.
29820180	29822180	You guys not Ian, you want to go ah?
29823180	29825180	I'm not pleased you.
29826180	29830180	You win.
29830180	29832180	Oh, you didn't mean that.
29835180	29837180	Sniffer, sniffer Ian.
29839180	29843180	Everyone's are going to starve because we're getting so distracted trying to win.
29843180	29845180	Why did I not work?
29850180	29852180	Here. Oh no.
29852180	29854180	I'm blue.
29854180	29857180	Abba de abba die, I'm blue.
29857180	29860180	I would be off a guy.
29860180	29863180	Now listen up, here's the story.
29863180	29868180	I found a little cuttlefish in the deep blue sea.
29868180	29872180	Everything was blue and visited the minimum.
29872180	29875180	Yeah, nobody to listen.
29875180	29880180	I knew I would meet up a guy.
29885180	29888180	Wow, it's cold on my hands.
29888180	29890180	That guy literally.
29894180	29897180	Hold on, I'm getting my burrito at my weebops.
29901180	29903180	I can't do that.
29904180	29906180	I need to do that, don't know.
29906180	29908180	I do, I do.
29910180	29911180	Oh no.
29911180	29914180	You're not supposed to do that, I'm going to hear them.
29914180	29916180	Yeah wait, far.
29918180	29921180	No, you're not supposed to win against me.
29923180	29925180	Okay, I'm opening up my burrito.
29925180	29928180	My burrito with no cilantro.
29928180	29931180	Because we do not like cilantro on the top.
29932180	29934180	Wow, oh yeah, hold on.
29936180	29938180	Oh no, what is this?
29939180	29944180	Mmm, oh my god, it's delicious.
29944180	29947180	Oh shiisa, shiisa.
29947180	29950180	He's doing that, he's gunning for that.
29950180	29953180	I can tell Riefland, I can see right through your thought process right now.
29953180	29955180	No, I was going to put there.
29955180	29959180	Wait, why can I not put here?
29959180	29962180	He puts here, I put there.
29962180	29965180	No, I put there, he puts there.
29965180	29967180	I win.
29968180	29970180	But why would you do that?
29970180	29974180	One, two, one, two, three, he wins.
29974180	29976180	Reh.
29979180	29982180	You could have had it, spare.
29986180	29987180	Here?
29988180	29990180	Oh wait, oh no!
29991180	29996180	Oh no, I did, I remembered like literally as I put that down.
29996180	29998180	Oh my god.
29998180	30002180	Bruv, I literally just threw that game, I could have won that.
30002180	30004180	Bruv.
30004180	30007180	I could have won it, Grimble.
30012180	30017180	It is too hard, it's so freaking hard to win Grimble, thank you for the tip.
30017180	30020180	Literally Hypnosis is the only reason I can get away with it.
30020180	30022180	Have I played with D-Riefland?
30022180	30024180	I don't think so.
30024180	30027180	Go again, boom.
30027180	30029180	No, my turn.
30031180	30034180	A well deserved loss.
30034180	30038180	Okay, look, I have room temperature IQ, I'm trying my best.
30042180	30045180	Right, no, don't do that.
30048180	30050180	Mmm.
30058180	30062180	But, I think you've played them all at least once now.
30062180	30064180	Yeah, go away.
30065180	30069180	Our darling low IQ Veeche bar, honestly.
30069180	30073180	More like our dangerously low IQ Veeche bar.
30074180	30076180	Hmm.
30076180	30079180	Oh my god, this is like a wish.
30084180	30087180	Yeah, I fucking love pepper.
30087180	30090180	You know what, chicken is the MVP, I'm not even playing.
30090180	30095180	Oh no, that is a good one, two, three, four.
30095180	30098180	What if I go here then?
30103180	30106180	I don't know what happened if I do for them.
30108180	30112180	Ah, I freaking love chicken sauce, it's like the best meat sauce ever.
30115180	30119180	Girls are cute when they're almost reeflings.
30119180	30121180	Wait, is that my turn?
30121180	30123180	What did you do?
30123180	30125180	What did you do?
30125180	30127180	Thank you for the game, strong.
30127180	30129180	Oh, you're welcome, you don't have to take me for that.
30129180	30131180	I have no idea what you did though.
30131180	30133180	Oh wait, this reeflings the end.
30133180	30135180	What did you do?
30135180	30137180	Is there something here?
30137180	30139180	I think I'm having something here.
30143180	30145180	Papago?
30149180	30151180	Alright, what happened if I go here?
30151180	30153180	I don't know, maybe I need to go down here?
30153180	30155180	Alright.
30160180	30162180	Here maybe?
30162180	30164180	I don't know.
30166180	30168180	If I go here then I'll lose, I hope not.
30172180	30174180	One, two, three, eh.
30174180	30176180	So eh.
30177180	30179180	Eh.
30180180	30182180	Ah, it's a fucking thing!
30183180	30186180	I have a fucking way to stay, it's so hard.
30187180	30189180	I don't even see it.
30190180	30193180	I literally can't even see it at all.
30195180	30197180	This is so hard though.
30197180	30200180	Is there any reeflings I haven't gone against?
30201180	30203180	I haven't gone against everyone here.
30207180	30209180	That's so hard.
30209180	30211180	Right, have I gone against everyone here?
30211180	30213180	I may have, you know that.
30215180	30217180	Are you a reefling? All fans?
30217180	30219180	All fans?
30220180	30223180	Maybe they're just confused why there's so many people here.
30224180	30226180	Does anyone want to go again?
30226180	30228180	Because I can play while I eat.
30230180	30233180	I think we're on run two, I think everyone's having a fair share.
30237180	30239180	Eh.
30239180	30242180	Look how all of you guys have numbers and stuff now,
30242180	30244180	because you've been beating me.
30244180	30246180	Hold on, eat, eat.
30246180	30248180	Um.
30249180	30251180	I'm eating my time.
30251180	30254180	I'll pass, I've been meant to do it in that one.
30255180	30257180	Mmm.
30258180	30260180	Yeah? Yeah.
30260180	30263180	That's the best counter in location I pay out.
30264180	30266180	Mmm.
30266180	30268180	You're shooting both of them.
30271180	30273180	The same thing is, you actually could have won three times
30273180	30275180	if you weren't placing tails randomly.
30276180	30279180	I'm trying to think ahead of my moves, okay?
30279180	30281180	It's hard.
30284180	30286180	Oh my god, this is delicious.
30288180	30290180	Reeflings, do you want me to baby barge you?
30290180	30292180	Because I'll do it.
30293180	30295180	Mmm.
30304180	30307180	Uh, don't like the look of that.
30307180	30310180	I'm getting nervous, I'm getting shaky.
30314180	30316180	I'm trying to do that then.
30316180	30317180	Get ready.
30317180	30318180	Oh no!
30318180	30319180	No!
30319180	30321180	No!
30322180	30324180	Why do I not see it?
30324180	30326180	Why do I not see it coming?
30327180	30329180	Why do I not see it coming?
30329180	30331180	I'm being so for real right now.
30331180	30332180	Right.
30332180	30334180	The next one I am not losing.
30334180	30335180	I don't care what happens.
30335180	30337180	I am not losing.
30338180	30340180	I am tryharding so much.
30341180	30343180	I am not losing this one.
30343180	30345180	I'm so serious.
30346180	30348180	Are we bimbo max?
30348180	30349180	I literally don't see it.
30349180	30351180	Right, you've placed it in the middle.
30351180	30353180	That's fine.
30353180	30354180	Is it?
30354180	30355180	I don't know.
30355180	30357180	We'll place it next to you then.
30359180	30361180	That's fine.
30361180	30364180	So I'll counter you from doing four in a row on the bottom.
30365180	30367180	And then I'll do this.
30369180	30371180	Alright.
30371180	30373180	One, two, three.
30373180	30375180	So you can't go anywhere there.
30375180	30377180	But I can progress by going here.
30380180	30382180	And that's fine.
30382180	30384180	You're allowed to do that.
30386180	30388180	Right.
30389180	30391180	Did I do it?
30392180	30394180	Oh, wait.
30395180	30397180	I thought I won there.
30397180	30398180	Wait.
30399180	30401180	Wait, why did I not win there?
30402180	30404180	Like this?
30404180	30406180	Did I counter them by going that way?
30409180	30411180	I will redeem myself.
30411180	30413180	Oh no, right.
30413180	30415180	One, two, three, four.
30415180	30417180	So drop it here.
30420180	30422180	I'm tryharding.
30422180	30424180	I'm looking.
30427180	30429180	Alright, if you're there,
30429180	30431180	one, two, three, four.
30431180	30433180	Fuck you.
30433180	30435180	Wait.
30436180	30438180	One, two, three, four.
30441180	30443180	What are you trying to do?
30443180	30445180	One, two, three, here.
30445180	30447180	So I can't put it in this column.
30450180	30452180	Right, you've put it up there,
30452180	30454180	which is fine.
30454180	30456180	Oh, fuck you.
30456180	30458180	You've blocked me.
30458180	30460180	Uh.
30460180	30462180	Wait.
30463180	30465180	So what happens now?
30466180	30467180	What did that do?
30467180	30468180	No, you're getting blocked.
30468180	30469180	I don't know what you're doing,
30469180	30471180	but don't do it.
30473180	30474180	I don't know what you're doing there,
30474180	30476180	but don't do it.
30478180	30480180	What are you doing over here now?
30483180	30485180	That's fine.
30487180	30489180	Whoa!
30489180	30491180	Whoa!
30491180	30492180	Get wrecked.
30492180	30493180	Get wrecked.
30493180	30495180	Get absolutely wrecked.
30495180	30496180	Oh my God, I did it.
30496180	30498180	I was like trying so hard.
30498180	30500180	I was trying to see what you were trying to do.
30500180	30502180	I was playing two characters at once on the board.
30502180	30504180	Oh, we did it.
30505180	30507180	I have lower connect for IQ.
30509180	30511180	Okay, let's try again.
30511180	30513180	Hold on, let me take a bite of my food.
30513180	30515180	Oh my God, I had to try so hard for that.
30516180	30518180	Mmm.
30519180	30521180	Okay.
30523180	30525180	Oh my God, that was so hard.
30526180	30528180	I don't know how people play logic games all the time.
30528180	30530180	I feel like my brain just gets so tired.
30530180	30532180	I'm like, oh, I'm done.
30532180	30534180	Mmm.
30536180	30538180	Mmm-hmm.
30540180	30542180	Mmm-hmm.
30543180	30544180	Here, here, here.
30544180	30546180	Oh, shit.
30546180	30548180	Oh, this is not looking good.
30550180	30552180	Mmm-hmm.
30555180	30556180	Am I going to throw?
30556180	30558180	I don't know what you're trying to do.
30559180	30561180	What are you trying to do?
30563180	30564180	Don't feel bad.
30564180	30566180	My brain is still at nice capacity.
30566180	30567180	Oh, no, what did you do?
30567180	30568180	I wasn't paying attention.
30568180	30569180	Right, you get blocked.
30576180	30577180	Mmm-hmm.
30578180	30579180	Oh, fuck!
30579180	30582180	Oh, for fuck's sake, it seems so hard.
30583180	30587180	Bro, when you go back to cooking swordfish, this is so hard.
30587180	30588180	How?
30589180	30590180	I never see it.
30590180	30593180	I, like, physically can't see it coming.
30594180	30595180	Until I hear the...
30599180	30600180	Bro.
30600180	30602180	Girlfriend is pouty and frustrated and upset.
30602180	30604180	She's got destroyed and fucking...
30604180	30606180	Not even just destroyed and runescaped.
30606180	30609180	Destroyed and runescaped, like, side player gate.
30609180	30611180	Oh, God, I'm first. Sorry.
30612180	30614180	Wait, how did that double down there?
30614180	30615180	I didn't even need to...
30615180	30616180	Oh, fine, I'm tripling down.
30622180	30623180	Mmm-hmm.
30629180	30632180	Oh, so I'm choking on my burrito in anger.
30634180	30636180	Because I'm so bad at this game.
30636180	30637180	Mmm-hmm.
30639180	30640180	I don't know.
30643180	30646180	No, you're gonna win!
30647180	30649180	Oh, look how freaking low my score is!
30649180	30650180	I started on a third.
30650180	30652180	Oh, my God, you're so good at winning.
30652180	30653180	What are you doing?
30654180	30656180	One, two, three, two, two.
30657180	30659180	I don't know what I'm doing, either, to be honest.
30661180	30662180	Ah, Saishayuma.
30663180	30665180	Ah, Saishayuma.
30672180	30674180	Ow, what are you doing?
30675180	30676180	Stop.
30677180	30678180	You're stressing me out.
30678180	30679180	This refland's gonna win.
30679180	30681180	They're, like, genuinely stressing me out.
30682180	30683180	Right, get blocked.
30685180	30687180	No! Oh, my God!
30687180	30688180	I hate...
30688180	30689180	Wait, we're going...
30689180	30690180	No, I'm sorry.
30690180	30691180	We're going back to Edgeville.
30691180	30692180	I'm actually fucking done.
30692180	30693180	I'm actually...
30693180	30694180	I'm done.
30694180	30696180	We're going back to Edgeville.
30696180	30697180	I'm not even kidding.
30697180	30698180	I'm not even joking.
30698180	30699180	We're going back to Edgeville.
30699180	30700180	I'm so done.
30700180	30701180	I'm so done.
30703180	30705180	We're going back to Edgeville to cook
30705180	30706180	freaking swordfish.
30706180	30708180	This is so hard.
30709180	30710180	This is so hard.
30710180	30712180	It's a surprise exam.
30712180	30713180	Get to fuck.
30713180	30715180	I've got the lowest IQ in the...
30716180	30718180	Freaking lower than room temperature water.
30718180	30719180	Oh, my God.
30721180	30723180	Why is that game so hard?
30724180	30725180	Freaking...
30726180	30728180	To no one's surprise,
30728180	30730180	the 1v1 chess stream has been delayed
30730180	30732180	due to the fact that I'm probably
30732180	30734180	gonna have to actually watch some chess tutorials
30734180	30736180	because I don't know how the rules work.
30738180	30740180	If she starts speaking...
30740180	30741180	If she starts speaking German,
30741180	30742180	she should really stop playing.
30742180	30743180	I respect your dedication
30743180	30745180	not to apply mind bullets to them
30745180	30747180	to gain a victory.
30747180	30748180	Is that what it should have done?
30748180	30749180	I should have done.
30749180	30751180	I should just start taking the bikini off
30751180	30752180	and all that.
30753180	30755180	I was so hard for no reason.
30756180	30757180	Take the random event.
30757180	30758180	Oh, is it good?
30758180	30759180	Sorry.
30761180	30762180	Hello.
30762180	30763180	Yeah, sure.
30763180	30764180	I'll find soon an exam.
30764180	30765180	Right.
30765180	30766180	What's my...
30766180	30767180	What is this?
30767180	30768180	Ah, it's your skullfish.
30768180	30769180	You've been slacking in your studies.
30769180	30770180	It's time for an exam.
30770180	30771180	In some case, Johnny,
30771180	30773180	once gay players are built different.
30773180	30774180	Bro, they are.
30774180	30775180	Thank you for the tip, boy.
30775180	30777180	They literally are, though.
30778180	30779180	There are two types of questions.
30779180	30781180	One requires you to find the next object
30781180	30782180	in a pattern.
30782180	30783180	And the second,
30783180	30785180	I will present you with 15 cards and a hint.
30786180	30787180	That's so specific.
30787180	30788180	What are we doing?
30788180	30789180	What comes next?
30789180	30791180	Shoes, shoes, shoes.
30791180	30792180	Shoes.
30792180	30793180	That's correct.
30793180	30794180	Next question.
30794180	30796180	Pick the object that should come next to a pattern.
30798180	30799180	A banana,
30799180	30800180	a dookie,
30800180	30801180	a pineapple,
30801180	30803180	a slice of watermelon.
30804180	30805180	Finally,
30805180	30807180	a apple that uses her brains.
30807180	30808180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
30808180	30809180	Sure, sure.
30810180	30812180	These are gardening tools,
30812180	30813180	so we need a rake.
30814180	30815180	To the exit.
30815180	30816180	Okay, we did it.
30816180	30817180	We did it.
30817180	30818180	Please don't fail.
30818180	30819180	Imagine if I did this.
30823180	30824180	Oh, my God.
30824180	30825180	Did you hear that?
30825180	30827180	The burrito just kissed me
30827180	30828180	from the way I bit it.
30828180	30830180	What's the book of knowledge to do?
30830180	30831180	Ah!
30831180	30832180	Fishing?
30832180	30833180	It took him.
30836180	30837180	Wait.
30837180	30839180	Oh, that wasn't cooking.
30839180	30840180	Oh, my God.
30842180	30843180	Oh, my God.
30844180	30846180	Just when you think I couldn't get dumber,
30846180	30849180	I just put XP into firemaking
30849180	30851180	instead of cooking.
30851180	30852180	Bruv.
30852180	30854180	Can this get any worse?
30855180	30857180	I don't think it's any more obvious
30857180	30858180	how low my IQ is.
30858180	30859180	Holy crap.
30859180	30860180	It's even a miracle I can breathe
30860180	30862180	and eat at the same time.
30863180	30866180	Oh, my God.
30866180	30867180	Reefling's about to get jealous
30867180	30869180	over a burrito for real, for real.
30869180	30870180	Did you not hear?
30870180	30871180	Did it come up in the make?
30871180	30872180	It literally went...
30873180	30875180	when I bit into the burrito.
30877180	30878180	It's fine, you're a fish.
30878180	30880180	You are the goofiest of goobers.
30880180	30881180	We love you immensely.
30881180	30884180	The firemaking will warm up your IQ.
30885180	30887180	Small brain after all.
30887180	30889180	That was so hard.
30889180	30890180	I don't know how to play this.
30890180	30891180	Ah, jealous of a piece of fish.
30893180	30895180	Shawnee out here looking like process.
30895180	30896180	Bruv.
30896180	30898180	That was terrible.
30898180	30900180	I literally rage quit.
30900180	30902180	I'm like, no, I need to walk away.
30902180	30903180	Thank you very much, Reefling,
30903180	30905180	for making the fire.
30905180	30907180	Any arsonists?
30907180	30909180	Absolutely.
30909180	30910180	Let me keep eating this burrito
30910180	30911180	before it gets cold.
30916180	30918180	Are you squidding me right now?
30919180	30921180	Strowme, we're hungry.
30921180	30923180	Can you get back in the kitchen?
30923180	30925180	I mean, level in cooking.
30925180	30927180	Love you, you goofball.
30927180	30929180	Thank you, anonymous.
30929180	30930180	Love you too, little Reefling.
30930180	30932180	Yes, I will feed you well and good.
30933180	30934180	That was...
30934180	30935180	Thank you for the tip.
30935180	30937180	Oh my god, my hand's covered in sauce.
30942180	30943180	See, I'm not afraid to, like,
30943180	30945180	sauce off after Reefling.
30945180	30947180	As I choke on a piece of corn,
30947180	30949180	I can't talk and frickin...
30950180	30952180	...eat at the same time.
30958180	30960180	Oh my god.
30961180	30963180	That was so hard for no reason.
30963180	30964180	I've never played Connect 4 like that
30964180	30966180	in a very long time.
30966180	30968180	Bruv, I suck at anything logic-based.
30970180	30972180	Oh my god.
30973180	30975180	Is there Connect 4 championships?
30976180	30978180	Could you imagine?
30978180	30980180	You know how you get a rank in chess?
30982180	30983180	Can you imagine?
30983180	30985180	It was fun content, though.
30985180	30987180	Strowme gets absolutely destroyed by...
30990180	30992180	...viewers live on stream.
30992180	30994180	Rage quiz.
30995180	30996180	Mm-hmm.
31002180	31003180	Wow.
31004180	31006180	I almost finished this brutal.
31006180	31007180	My hand is covered.
31007180	31009180	I don't think I have a napkin.
31010180	31012180	Reeflings, do you want to come lick my fingers
31012180	31014180	and call me KFC?
31015180	31017180	Cause I'm finger-licking good.
31017180	31018180	Oh, hold on.
31018180	31020180	Cause I'm finger-licking good!
31022180	31023180	Thank you.
31029180	31032180	I have to lean over with my other hand to do that.
31033180	31035180	It's like a call offering.
31037180	31040180	I want KFC not to imagine that almost.
31043180	31045180	Cuttlefish pounded from four angles.
31045180	31047180	Yeah, that could be the title of the stream
31047180	31049180	cause I played that frickin...
31051180	31053180	Connect 4 more like...
31053180	31055180	Connect my shite.
31063180	31065180	Right, we'll finish the...
31066180	31067180	We'll finish eating.
31067180	31069180	And we'll finish the swordfish.
31071180	31074180	Snippets, 20-minute warning for Mercy.
31076180	31078180	Azura, I think, is still going to be live on stream.
31078180	31080180	Cause stream is a six-hour game.
31086180	31087180	If you're going to do emotes,
31087180	31089180	you should do questionable ones like this.
31089180	31091180	Is that questionable?
31091180	31093180	Oh, maybe if you're like under the table.
31093180	31095180	Then, yeah.
31096180	31098180	Yeah, Azura is still live.
31098180	31099180	Okay, that's good.
31101180	31102180	I'm eating.
31105180	31107180	Architect bros winning.
31111180	31113180	And do you want to know the calorie count
31113180	31115180	of my meal, Architect bros?
31118180	31120180	Just the thought of my stomach expanding
31120180	31122180	with all that food and sticking out,
31122180	31124180	going from a flat stomach
31124180	31126180	to all big and engorged...
31127180	31128180	Architect.
31131180	31132180	I'm sorry.
31133180	31135180	I don't know why I'm just talking about that.
31136180	31138180	No, Architect bros.
31139180	31141180	I hate it now, I'm teasing you.
31141180	31143180	I'm teasing your pickles.
31148180	31149180	I do not judge.
31151180	31153180	Don't be sorry, we enjoy it.
31153180	31154180	I should get a hydration.
31154180	31156180	Well, I'll say hydration as if it's not cool over.
31164180	31165180	Big burp.
31166180	31167180	Maybe a big burp.
31168180	31169180	We burp, we burp.
31169180	31170180	Not much force.
31170180	31171180	Not much fist room.
31171180	31172180	Dah, behind that burp.
31174180	31175180	Pause.
31176180	31178180	Yeah, we're now munching on the leftover chips
31178180	31179180	because I finished my burrito.
31179180	31181180	Some of the filling of the burrito spilled out,
31181180	31182180	so I'm like...
31182180	31184180	I'm using my chip as a vessel
31184180	31186180	to spoon it into my mouth.
31187180	31189180	Not the in-game rate in a mubbock.
31195180	31197180	Strawny feeds everyone equally.
31197180	31199180	That's why she's queen for it.
31202180	31204180	Your interests are my fascination.
31204180	31206180	Your curiosities are my challenge.
31207180	31209180	Chicken or beef?
31211180	31212180	Chicken.
31214180	31216180	I struggle to eat a lot around me
31216180	31218180	and then I wonder why I'm so ill.
31219180	31221180	It's literally got all the iron in it that I need.
31224180	31226180	I'm always a chicken boy.
31226180	31228180	I'm a chicken boy mubbock.
31231180	31233180	Do you know some Gomez person?
31233180	31234180	No, sorry.
31238180	31239180	Am I supposed to?
31241180	31242180	I love vision.
31242180	31244180	I think I've ever had vision before.
31245180	31246180	I'm heading to sleep at 6am.
31246180	31247180	Oh my goodness.
31247180	31248180	Please rest well.
31248180	31250180	Is that 6am America?
31250180	31251180	Must be.
31253180	31256180	Because it's like midnight in the UK, roughly.
31260180	31261180	Are you good?
31261180	31262180	Oops.
31263180	31264180	Who goes there?
31264180	31265180	I identify yourself.
31266180	31268180	No, it's only 8pm on the west coast.
31268180	31269180	Oh!
31270180	31271180	Sorry, I can't stop burping.
31271180	31272180	Good night, EU.
31273180	31275180	Thank you for absolutely reckoning
31275180	31277180	decking me on Kinect 4.
31278180	31279180	I live in Turkey.
31279180	31280180	Oh, okay, okay, okay.
31281180	31282180	It's 6am.
31283180	31285180	It's 11pm for me and I'm Midwest.
31285180	31286180	Yee-haw!
31286180	31288180	Nah, it's 4am in the UK.
31293180	31295180	Sorry, I'm still really enjoying my food
31295180	31297180	so I apologise if I'm not talking too much.
31298180	31300180	I'm trying to eat as fast as I can.
31305180	31306180	I keep doing that.
31306180	31308180	I'm just going to click on the booth.
31310180	31311180	Let's go to the booth.
31313180	31315180	Am I dumb, but can I ask what munkah means?
31315180	31316180	Munkah.
31316180	31319180	Munkah S is a twitch emote
31319180	31321180	where Pappy looks really stressed out
31321180	31324180	and he's like, oh, like, like, nervous.
31324180	31327180	And I reduce it to munkah.
31327180	31328180	Munkah!
31330180	31333180	But if you type in munkah S on Google
31333180	31335180	it'll just show you what Pappy looks like.
31335180	31336180	He's all stressed out.
31339180	31341180	Almost 4am and I'm slowly losing it.
31341180	31343180	Please go to sleep!
31344180	31345180	Oh my god.
31346180	31348180	Please don't worry about going to sleep.
31348180	31350180	Like, seriously, I don't want you guys, like,
31350180	31352180	risking your health to watch me stream.
31352180	31354180	Like, I'm literally stuffing my face.
31354180	31355180	I just got wrecked and connect 4
31355180	31357180	and I'm going straight back to cooking.
31357180	31359180	Like, you ain't missing out on too much, I assure you.
31362180	31364180	Time for a hypnotic slumber.
31374180	31376180	Sleep is for the weakest weekend now.
31378180	31380180	Sleep equals exp wasted.
31382180	31384180	Oh my god, really, really close to level.
31384180	31385180	I'm not next batch.
31385180	31387180	I don't know what level.
31387180	31388180	40.
31388180	31390180	Eh, 74?
31398180	31400180	I hate arching on mobile.
31403180	31406180	See, we've got like a billion different things to click to do or anything.
31407180	31408180	And...
31409180	31410180	Ah!
31410180	31411180	76!
31411180	31414180	Oh my god, how much did Wine Boosters?
31415180	31417180	I thought we were selling like 72.
31421180	31425180	Wine is faster, but I want to use all the fish that the reeflings gave me.
31426180	31428180	Because I don't want it to go to waste.
31428180	31431180	I don't want it to be, like, rotting in my bank.
31436180	31439180	Four more levels and you can cook sharks.
31445180	31447180	I have a good night.
31447180	31449180	Please rest well.
31450180	31453180	Wine got me 72 at 65 in, like, under an hour.
31457180	31459180	Only power...
31460180	31465180	Only power to bring me back to this Godforsaken game is like cute fish!
31467180	31470180	It's a good game, but...
31470180	31475180	If you've got stuff to do, it's not the easiest game to, like, keep up the excitement.
31475180	31480180	I think RuneScape, I would say, is probably similar to, like, people say,
31480180	31484180	like, when you start up a Minecraft server, um...
31484180	31490180	Pardon me, and you play for, like, a week and then you all get burnt out and never go on it again type thing.
31490180	31493180	Wine got you from 69 to 70.
31493180	31495180	It feels good, man.
31497180	31499180	Nooo!
31499180	31501180	Not cooking and doing your species.
31501180	31505180	There's plenty to go around in the RuneScape economy.
31505180	31508180	More than enough, actually.
31508180	31512180	In fact, the waters are so infested with shark, they're everywhere.
31514180	31515180	Thank you.
31515180	31517180	Uh, boi- boi!
31518180	31521180	Can I say thank you and I'll miss for the other tips?
31522180	31527180	Love you, you're good for all. Love you too, love everything.
31527180	31530180	Or love you too, uh, Anonymous.
31530180	31534180	I don't know if I'm supposed to guess, I'm supposed to call you Anonymous or everything.
31539180	31541180	A rainbow fish!
31544180	31545180	Okay.
31545180	31549180	I've almost finished eating, I'm so sorry if it feels like I've been chewing for ages.
31549180	31551180	I was too busy getting- oh!
31551180	31553180	That's how many times have I done that now?
31553180	31555180	No, stop eating!
31555180	31557180	What are you doing?
31558180	31560180	Jeez, Louise woman.
31563180	31564180	Okay.
31564180	31566180	We've almost finished...
31566180	31568180	the...
31569180	31571180	the fishy.
31571180	31574180	Oh my god, sorry, I can't think I'm just too busy eating.
31574180	31578180	I've almost finished eating, I promise I'll finish eating soon.
31579180	31581180	How did you take so long to eat?
31584180	31587180	Walked into an eater's room, thank goodness I'm not late.
31587180	31590180	I'm gonna have her.
31591180	31594180	For the architect bros, this one's for you.
31594180	31598180	I order two meals because I have the second meal the next day,
31598180	31602180	so tomorrow I'll be eating my next meal.
31602180	31605180	So I'm gonna go put it in the fridge, in the-
31605180	31608180	and wash my hands because they're covered in grease.
31608180	31610180	They're covered.
31613180	31615180	She knows about that.
31615180	31618180	So, when Azura got released,
31618180	31620180	I read up a little bit and people were like,
31620180	31622180	oh my god, architect chocolate, and I'm like,
31622180	31624180	wait, I thought you were-
31624180	31626180	and I was like reading, I'm like,
31626180	31628180	oh okay, right, I get it now.
31628180	31631180	Why architect is such a random word for it though?
31633180	31636180	I still don't get the origin, but hey ho.
31636180	31638180	Anyway, I'm gonna very quickly wash my hands
31638180	31641180	because they're covered in freaking grease from the burrito.
31641180	31644180	That was absolutely inhaling and getting rolled on.
31644180	31648180	I'll be literally a millisecond, I don't need to do anything special.

31808180	31831420	I have six set, where does my head start, I've lost it, okay, I've just sat down and
31831420	31844100	I need a two, damn you, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna sneeze actually, okay,
31844100	31855500	what a wake up, okay, you're done, am I getting sick, I better not be, I am not
31855500	31860100	getting sick when I've not even done a month full of streaming yet, I do not tell
31860340	31868780	tolerate any sickness, I haven't even done it a full month yet, I'm getting sick, damn you, the
31868780	31884900	taskmasker, for me, no not for me, for any, maybe better streaming hours would help you,
31885420	31891740	what, you mean don't do 12 hours naturally, what are you talking about refling, don't say
31891740	31899100	such nonsense, are you trying to upset me refling, you're trying to make me feel it's
31899100	31907300	because you left us, okay, I won't feel sick anymore, you're laughing but I have separation
31907300	31917100	anxiety with you guys, it's been getting better but I feel an immense amount of anxiety at the,
31917100	31925420	before I click go live and then it goes away when I am live, I'm not sure what that means,
31925420	31934420	I mean I had it last time, wink wink, and then it subsided and it was back again so I don't
31934500	31939700	have to plan as it's going to subside over my body so sooner, we love you too, hey,
31939700	31945540	scrawny, when are the Elden Ring Streams, when the DLC releases, you've been playing for a while,
31945540	31953620	consider taking a break, do you insult me Jagex, do you think me some prepubescent child that can't
31953620	31964140	handle a little gaming session, Jagex please do not dare interrupt my flow, do you ever
31964340	31970740	get anxiety when it comes to ending streams, I get nervous about ending the stream because
31970740	31975100	of what I'm going to say and I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same
31975100	31981020	every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow, like I love you reflings, a few kisses on that
31981020	31987140	but I get worried about it and I don't know why, I think it's because I am saying goodbye and it's
31987140	31995220	like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know, and too much of a grimoire you somehow
31995220	32006340	groomed yourself, hear a veal or you don't grimoire, what a slogan to have for a, every time I do
32006340	32010900	that, what a slogan to have for a visa reasons that, I can't believe I said that out loud with my
32010980	32019540	fulche, ain't that true though, yeah, oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't
32019540	32024500	realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other, it's not
32024500	32029460	for the reflings that are addicted to each other, no, refling and strongy aren't addicted to each
32029460	32037460	other, I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming calls, those are so awkward doing so,
32037460	32044100	mmm, well like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream, I can't even remember
32044100	32050580	what it was, the entire ending got caught but I was like trying to say so much all at once just
32050580	32056900	because like I wanted to, you know, and I wasn't expected to be groomed but I'm glad you did,
32056900	32060580	oh that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence, I'm gonna be honest, it makes me
32060580	32072580	sound like Chris Hansen, take a seat moment, yeah, kind of true though, I think pre-stream
32072580	32078820	anxiety is normal, you're talking to an auditorium worth of people, I actually don't get nervous to
32078820	32088900	stream in that sense, it doesn't, I don't look at the numbers like I don't actually know, it's not
32088900	32097060	like on display for me, it's just me and reflings playing multiplayer game and that's it, like that's
32097060	32103700	what it is, it's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform, I don't have any kind of
32103700	32110500	imposter syndrome, I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough, I just like straight up have
32110500	32120980	separation anxiety and that's it pretty much, like I don't get nervous to stream, I don't get like oh
32120980	32129140	my god what happens if they don't like it, no, I'm just like just getting nervous, I'm like oh god
32129140	32136420	I don't feel well, like I feel sick, like my stomach feels ill sometimes, but like I've started
32136420	32141220	up streams and I've said to you like oh guys it's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it
32141220	32147060	ends up turning into like six hours type thing um when I only had the intention of two because I
32147060	32151780	wasn't feeling well, but as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind,
32152420	32158580	like I'm super energetic, I'm super engaging, like I'm having like so much fun, I'm enjoying myself
32158580	32165300	like right now we're looking at pixels over and over again putting, pardon me for being so rude,
32165300	32170340	it was not me, it was my food and like I'm having so much fun, like look at all the reeflings that
32170340	32177700	are in the bank with me right now, like all of us goofing off and like uh Mack, mackerel or maker,
32177700	32189940	Mack maker, thank you for coming to Memba, um it's just like, it's like me with social anxiety,
32189940	32194660	I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun, yeah it's kind of like getting over the hump
32194660	32204660	if you will and and like I especially enjoy my endurance streams, like I kind of spoke on it the
32204660	32212740	other day, um one time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me
32212740	32219460	and this isn't now, this isn't now, this is like way in the past, um and we played a song and it's
32219460	32225860	called Mr Kitty, um and it's like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song
32226980	32232500	and I heard it and I was listening to it and it made me feel a certain way, it made me feel
32232500	32237940	quite negative, like it was quite a depressive song, Mr Kitty After Dark, yes that was the song
32238820	32243780	and I listened to it and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time?
32244740	32250500	because of the way the song had like resonated with me, it felt as rough as I had felt in that
32250500	32254340	moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind the scene, um
32256020	32264900	and it kind of like made me realize like if me hanging out, having a carry-on, rambling,
32264900	32270020	coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate
32270020	32276580	stuff and all of that and like it makes you not feel like that when I stream, like how blessed
32276580	32286260	and how lucky like we're on this timeline, like you know you can feel, I don't know, like accepted
32286260	32292020	to just like do your own thing, like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length, you can be
32292020	32296980	attached at the hip, you can be on my head type thing, it's completely up to you Viflin, um
32297940	32302340	but I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that, like when
32303380	32306660	just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come
32307620	32313860	on stream and like you come and you you make me laugh, you make me giggle, we tell terrible puns
32313860	32320900	while going like and we're just hanging out type thing, you know it's like even when like you feel
32320900	32326500	so rough you're so willing to like come to me, be so accepting of me, like say such nice things to me
32326500	32334260	and encourage me to do stuff and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like

32341300	32348180	and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth and sometimes you need a song like that
32348180	32353380	to marinate in your thought, yeah like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the
32353700	32362100	dumps music or emotional music, like I listen to Atarashi Gako and like Tokyo Calling, Tokyo Calling
32362100	32365940	um like I listen to Hatsune Miku, I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen
32365940	32371140	to Hatsune Miku but like the music's so upbeat, it's so up-pop, like I never listen to anything
32371140	32378100	depressive, like like goofy, like literally I'm listening to a Dutch song, I have no idea what's
32378180	32385940	being said, other than the lyrics suck ma, type thing, you know, I love that thing
32388420	32394500	thanks for the stream strong, I'm off to watch Mercy, yes any snippets, Mercy Modiste is live
32394500	32400980	and she is playing with my willy, she's not, maybe in another life
32401700	32402900	um
32406580	32409700	right hold on let me check, Hatsune Miku has become a legendary figure
32411140	32417540	of Mickey and homework, right hold on what is Mercy playing, is Azura still live, Azura is
32417540	32427060	still live, she's playing Shrey live, Mercy Modiste, Mercy is playing Harvester part two, I already
32427060	32432900	knew that because I said that earlier and yeah I forgot, see you brain, see you brain
32439940	32448340	I got a comment on the new the ASMR video and someone's like why is this being recommended to me
32448900	32454420	hey hey hey hey hey you can't resist the ASMR
32459620	32463140	the most I felt like that after dark was when that um
32465060	32471540	when you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream
32471540	32479460	and maybe next stream we're doing members world unfortunately although wine isn't members is it
32480580	32483940	no maybe not, I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end
32485460	32488420	if we're doing wines all the way to the end, people say wines is faster
32489860	32495380	literally get algorithmed, honestly what did you miss I stuffed my face and then
32496180	32503220	uh let uh let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind
32508020	32511220	um yeah hold on, hold on
32513300	32517140	the begging ASMR is peak ASMR honestly, wait what does it say now
32517860	32526420	uh it's still going, oh my god is that 23,000 views, that doesn't make sense
32527940	32534020	architect bros eating good just like strongy honestly what does it mean architect architect
32534020	32544180	is a terminology used for people who enjoy bigger body types or eating type of content
32545140	32554260	or gaining weight type of content but there's different levels to it um so Azura delays
32554260	32559780	body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky I keep opening this freaking
32559780	32568420	collection box um VTuber so she would get referred to as someone for the architect bros
32569380	32574500	look at all the swordfish they're so purple
32576340	32577380	they're so purple
32579620	32585220	uh architect bros specifically vtubers I think
32586900	32594500	she shuffled herself in the ink yes uh again Azura Duly is live with a stray
32595460	32601540	hopefully her pc doesn't explode um and merci mondice is playing harvester part two
32601540	32607060	which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one
32607940	32611700	which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get a highlight reel of part two
32615700	32619700	I love strongy I love reeflings what you're gonna do about it huh you're gonna kiss me on my
32619940	32627220	lips you know let me hold your hand actually I have something to ask the reeflings are

32875700	32880500	and the zero I might not make her do the weird side of things I might do the weird side of things
32880900	32884820	but yeah
32890020	32892580	no plo no plunging not even a little
32894420	32901940	you can plug me up whoa wait hold on I was like so direct my brain was like oh this will this is
32901940	32907380	fine this is clearly beating around the bush nope no it's not it's absolutely not I just straight
32907380	32916180	upset what what I uh sorry you know actually I can tell you something that was really terrible
32917300	32925300	so if all the development issues hadn't occurred I actually fully was going to
32928660	32931700	are you squinting me uh hold on I don't know what you think
32931780	32934420	giant s for content one day totally
32936660	32941220	um I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous it doesn't bother me like I like it I don't
32941220	32947380	mind at all um I don't like the you die ones I don't like that I like the ones where you just
32947380	32952100	kind of appear on the other end all fine and good maybe a bit moody because you accidentally
32952100	32958420	got swallowed or something like that um she's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though
32959140	32964180	this is terrible so if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting
32964180	32969380	like all these audios on twitter and I was like oh I should probably do one as well but like
32969380	32976820	after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really terrible if I may or may not have been
32976820	32978820	um
32979780	32990020	plug uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record and like
32990020	32996660	do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know so that was my idea but
32996660	33003140	obviously that all crumbled apart thanks to development issues um but yeah I thought it would
33003220	33010500	be pretty good but that would have been amazing unfortunately it's not possible it's not possible
33011540	33016660	um there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people but
33016660	33022820	that's just what happens like literally um oh sorry there was a refling that messaged me that
33022820	33029700	apologized for criticizing the company for saying like oh it'd be better if the girls could make their
33029700	33036900	designs please don't feel bad I absolutely completely get where you come from um just for
33037540	33044260	how do I keep doing that I'll give up um please don't feel bad about saying that like you said
33044260	33050660	it in a nice way we had some negative criticism that was like oh premade model actually one of
33050660	33059540	the most bizarre criticisms we got um was what was it it was like oh they don't even have talents
33059620	33065780	ready when we opened up auditions and it was like yeah you're fucking Egypt we didn't have talents so
33065780	33070340	we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency but when we do it it's bad but when
33070340	33076180	everyone else does it it's fine and that was like what it was the most bizarre thing I had ever read
33076180	33086100	honestly um we have plenty of time for future fun literally opened up auditions and someone was like
33086100	33091540	what's she be 2.0 look like this I mean she was getting an update to our model I don't know how
33091540	33095860	much she said I'm not gonna say anything if she doesn't say anything I'm not gonna say anything
33095860	33103220	hey thank you for the tip as well anonymous sorry I almost forget to thank you um I won't say anything
33103220	33110420	until she be said something but yeah ghetto outfit she said outfit
33114420	33119460	right I'll I'll leave it at that if she's not directly said what it is I'm not gonna say
33120500	33121460	she said outfit
33125380	33132420	we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly it was bizarre like I remember
33132500	33139140	reading it actually there's a reflin it must have been a reflin it must have been a reflin
33139140	33144660	because you made me he haul my arse off and I can remember the quote because I used to quote it
33144660	33149380	because someone defended the agency they must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone
33149380	33154500	who's enthusiastic about the girls in general so someone criticized the company because they were
33154500	33161540	like oh another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their
33161700	33167060	premade models or whatever and then someone commented and replied to them and there was like
33167780	33174020	no one wants your ugliest sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model oh
33175300	33181540	I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he haul so badly
33181540	33189780	is that no one wants your ugly as sin model oh my god I literally was like getting so close
33189780	33195780	to printing that out and putting it on my fridge because it was just so hilarious to me like it was
33195780	33211380	so hilarious um like I just oh my god um uh vin miss vin san vin san vin sin vin sin
33212340	33217060	vin sin thank you for becoming a member that took me so long to figure out I'm so sorry
33217140	33222820	no not sin sister it was just the terminology the guy used because someone was like oh I don't
33222820	33227460	want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this I don't want that like basically complaining
33227460	33231300	about the agency and it was like rub one you've not even applied two you're not interested so
33231300	33237460	three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swiping in
33237460	33243140	and replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like
33243860	33250340	it's so good it's so funny anyway so you made my day whoever whoever like came
33250340	33256340	sweeping under to defend the agency you have made my day um hellscape thank you for becoming a
33256340	33263460	member I appreciate it the membership stream start next week uh you've got plenty uh it's a bit warm
33263460	33268980	not gonna lie a bit hot in here yeah a bit bit sweaty out here surprised the bank hasn't caught
33268980	33275620	on fire honestly um I forgive her she's tired and forgot how to read oh no what did I miss me
33276180	33282580	oh what are you yapping about scrawny is she be cooking so I think she has allured to something
33282580	33287780	which I'm more than happy for her to um but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't
33287780	33292100	want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the
33292100	33301940	most basic common courtesy thing um allured she'd be allured to it there were some abysmally uh stupid
33301940	33311220	to take from a flume it's just the way the guy typed the message I just constantly remember the
33311220	33320580	phrase ugliest sin model I like oh my god talking about like catching straight like oh my god I don't
33320580	33329300	think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model ah oh my god love it love it love
33329300	33340020	it love it um mommy you have broken youtube we are going for 6.1 subs oh my god the video what is
33340020	33346500	the video honestly that funny I'm like I'm second guessing myself I'm like what's the video truly that
33346500	33350180	entertaining like I was just kind of saying please a lot by the end of it and started like
33350180	33356180	breathing in the mic really weird I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models
33356180	33365220	literally I've only heard one other agency do it as well um but I'm quite happy for the girls like
33365220	33369540	to design their 2.0 like Emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy if she wants if that
33369540	33374900	makes her happier and all that then jeez what am I gonna fucking say about it nothing oh guys as
33374900	33381060	long as the girls are happy they're happy um I made mommy ink herself has my whole life been a
33381060	33388500	mistake is this peak content for you from uh also the amount of people that could not read oh I felt
33388500	33398100	so bad actually we had one Japanese girl um apply and I felt so bad because she had such a lovely
33398100	33404740	voice but she could hardly speak any English and I was like it's not gonna work it's such a shame
33405460	33413700	she had worked for a previous agency um and I think google translate was helping her through
33413700	33420340	the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like bro you can't speak English
33420340	33427220	I can't have you there is actually a Russian person that reached out as well she was like I know you
33427220	33432980	I know your agency's English but can I stream in Russian and have a Russian audience and I'm like
33433620	33438980	ah yes let us the English VTuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like
33438980	33445540	moderate what you're doing or saying like what some folk had like don't get me wrong we're lenient
33445540	33452900	but we do have to say like that's not even possible like what you're asking for isn't even possible
33454100	33460660	um that was a shame I loved Amy's 2.0 design I'm glad I'm glad I think she had a lot of fun
33460660	33472660	designing her 2.0 um so yeah how good was good as application what good is still a thingy
33472660	33477380	oh you want to trade with me hold on let me put my swordfish away I'll trade with you what's up
33478260	33488980	what's up low leaflin maybe oh it's so what is this are these donuts to put around your
33489380	33495460	disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves what
33497860	33500980	what have you given me what does it look like activate
33502580	33510260	you can only enter thordor's black hole from the dwarven mains are you sitting literally I
33510260	33516340	thought this is a weebie ring as well are you giving me your weebie ring am I putting shoes on
33517300	33525460	okay I got shoes on I've got gloves on oh now I look like I really work I think it's a helpful
33525460	33531940	tool that will come in handy later that's so ominous this is a helpful tool that'll help you later
33531940	33535940	what do you mean that's so ominous what am I supposed to do about that
33536500	33548340	I I get you miss 100% of the shots but some people just don't get it it was a shame like I felt
33548340	33555140	really bad for the Japanese girl she was nothing but polite well mannered um and like obviously I
33555140	33559860	can't say too much of the message but basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work
33559860	33566180	out and and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience
33566180	33573540	type thing but she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like given lead script examples where
33573540	33578020	she mimics what I'm seeing because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing when it
33578020	33583220	comes to trying to mix it was a shame it was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix
33584180	33593380	you can stack donuts on it Japanese branch when no there will be no spin-offs
33594500	33604420	absolutely no spin-offs at viola um I am I am three gents and I am done I have nothing else to
33604420	33611940	produce or give to this beautiful world I will give my daughters um my gen one my gen two my
33611940	33619140	gen three and I am done I cannot handle anymore I am I'm at capacity there is too much lights off
33619140	33623620	a plappening happen I can't keep up with you as refluence I can't keep up with you as
33624260	33630260	and someone was worried about a male branch I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the
33630260	33639060	ditch I am not even touching it with a ten foot pole um someone asked I did get a few inquiries
33639620	33646180	on the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch um the answer is no
33647620	33653300	I don't mean to sound so blunt with that but the answer is no you might as well go to any other
33653300	33658260	agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work the reason
33658260	33662260	why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons but that's okay
33662260	33668260	though because you know is what it is no point in no point in beating around the bush no point in
33668260	33676340	beating around the bush um safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that
33676340	33687140	point might as well just start like a whole different agency and all that jazz um but I am done I have
33687140	33696420	experienced it it's been fun um Veeler is my child and so are my daughters and the reeflings
33696420	33701380	are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr and I forgot to commission
33701380	33707540	that art I've still not done it I don't do it shouldn't Veeler too electric boogaloo but

34003620	34008260	fuck you you tangled me I tangled you that was an ASMR that was just me man
34009620	34010900	singing a little lullaby
34013460	34019380	strongy was streaming when I came to bed now I wake up and I continue continue watching hell yeah
34021620	34026340	all of a sudden I feel super hyper well after the lullaby my favorite saying apologies if I
34026340	34031460	bit you it oh as if I can read that
34040420	34045060	they really said loose lips sink ships I can't believe it you almost got me
34045940	34048900	it was lovely though oh your whispers can tingle alone
34049460	34056980	and I bet you like my whispers I start saying you just get ready to go to sleep
34056980	34066020	yeah normally these ones I'd stay up go to sleep or just play summer escape a little without
34071700	34075620	the hypnosis then just made me imagine you gengar
34076580	34081700	yeah gengar the hypnosis
34085060	34091300	might be the lullaby or the two kilograms of cocaína just no no I'll sleep when mom

34099220	34102340	emi and ac's memberships are gonna go
34103940	34110420	live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer
34112660	34118100	such a good little streamer streamer no this doesn't make me a streamer
34119700	34126980	manager no I'm a little manager I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them
34126980	34132420	as long as the girl's stress levels are low and I will I will be very happy
34139620	34144500	the point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually
34144500	34148980	taking over a decade from when I became interested until I felt my first vision
34149460	34153220	mmm it was drowsy
34155060	34166500	yes I will my bedtime is 5 p.m. actually it's 1 p.m. right now and we've still got another what
34166500	34176660	two and a half hours yeah so then that would take me to what four p.m so I have one hour
34176660	34184820	basically to do all the stuff that I'm supposed to do and then I pass out and then when I wake up
34184820	34191940	I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea and then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make
34191940	34198820	sure you guys can hear it and see it and then we go again and I believe tomorrow is eight hour
34198820	34205140	stream it's not endurance to finish the game it's eight hours would it be mean to let you know
34205140	34217460	you're 10% of the way to 99 what 10% of the way
34220500	34224420	I thought I could get it finished this month I don't think so
34224820	34235860	10% there oh yay oh no do you want to know the amount of exp required
34237540	34245780	it's 13 million oh I'm 10% of the way that so every million is like I guess
34246340	34258100	what 1.3 percent every million wait every million is 10.3 percent surely that's how it works is that
34258100	34269700	how math works break it down into chunks um 98 to 99 is like 1.2 million oh my god
34270020	34275780	peanut the forest is here you should be able to do it
34278020	34284900	every 1.3 million is 10 percent okay so we're just over 10 percent now okay that's not bad
34284900	34292740	we'll finish the sword fish I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then
34293700	34302580	we'll tackle wine I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff and we're basically gonna watch a movie
34304900	34311380	while we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie um I think we'll do John Wick
34312900	34318340	this is perfect zatsu content and rambling yeah I did look at marshmallows I don't know
34318580	34323220	have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows I can't really read for obvious reason
34323940	34330180	because refillings are a little okay let me check if there are any more
34331380	34337540	marshmallows oh okay definitely a few more marshmallows hold on let's go uh
34341220	34344660	oh no are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row
34348820	34352660	uh
34355860	34362660	uh I was split between giving my veal or membership uh cherry to emmy or to mercy
34363300	34367460	because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with
34367460	34372340	other girls then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third
34372340	34378900	option you me no you're supposed to support my daughters strongy sometimes during or after
34378900	34382980	emmy's membership opening I'm going to make a decision you're a strong prick I won't overlook
34382980	34390740	you when deciding refling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be um please always support
34390740	34397780	my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time um please pick either daughter if you
34397780	34403140	struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design you like the most
34403780	34408740	that's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go I like this
34408740	34413300	design the most or I like that oh my god I thought Gimli was in the room there I had a heart attack
34413300	34418340	I always get nervous about spiders uh I don't like them um mostly there's a spider like a
34418340	34427140	working in the room can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows um you can via cat box um
34428580	34433540	if you want to show me something but you have to do the link and you have to make it easy
34434260	34439780	just remove the dot and put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way I'm too
34439780	34444020	pepega and can't open it off it's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link with when you
34444020	34449940	don't give me the link it's okay strongy we'll comfort you after this losses there there
34449940	34455620	head pads good girl hey wait didn't did you want us to help with those frustrations

34476740	34480020	that's a offline one you know what I'm saying that's that's between me and offline
34480580	34486340	uh right let me let me scroll down to the next one uh hey strongy just wanted to thank

34529700	34531860	no you can't call me cameo she
34534580	34540020	well you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows yes I've been wanting to do it
34540020	34546180	and update it terribly terribly badly for a long time because I really enjoy writing the scenarios
34546180	34550740	to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something and I just take it way
34550740	34558420	too far it's my favorite thing to do uh yes I will definitely be doing that again soon it's just
34559140	34565220	every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed
34565220	34569940	out the way then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two
34569940	34575220	other streams I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot
34575220	34584740	roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit um so ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a
34584740	34590980	board game a bunch till we let you win and then space you time to celebrate the victory honestly
34590980	34600660	that's quite funny um you being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to
34602340	34607860	run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you I would hug you and roll around under the covers
34607860	34611540	and never let you go where's can I explain how much I love you you're my sunshine oh you're my
34611540	34620180	sunshine are you playing uh you like when I'm dumb you like when I show how unbelievably
34620180	34628740	braindead I am yeah is that what you like sorry but you're being hard locked as my wishy-dus
34630660	34636500	we sure do oh allegedly why is it so hard to play freaking connect four
34636500	34639940	I don't know why it's so hard
34643780	34649540	she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged okay she
34649540	34656740	be she's doing better with her migraine you are more of a mother to me than my own parents and
34656740	34662420	I hardly even know you you are welcome well I didn't mean you're welcome like that but um
34662980	34672180	um sometimes it's a bit sucky but some people might not necessarily be the best parents
34672820	34682580	and sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath and sigh and say they did the best with
34682580	34690980	what they had at the time with what they got and sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and
34691060	34699780	be like oh that really wasn't as nice because you know when you watch media it's like oh the loving
34699780	34708100	parents they they're so supportive they're so this or so that sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow
34708100	34714900	to say that you drew an unlucky hand and that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love
34714900	34723460	for your primary caregivers um but there are some phrases in the English language that's like
34723460	34729620	the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb which basically just means the
34729620	34739860	connections that you seek out in life that are outside of your family can be just as valid if
34739860	34746580	not more loving than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and
34747620	34754740	sometimes it's just easier to it's not easy to swallow the pill but sometimes it's easier to
34754740	34764020	just take a deep breath let out a big sigh and be like okay that's just how it is and I hope you're
34764020	34773300	doing okay yeah it it sucks but I'm I'm glad um you can feel a degree of motherly love um
34774500	34781780	you know I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or uh what's the word kind of like it's only human
34781780	34792340	nature to crave um to crave attention to crave love to create to crave these positive reinforcers
34792900	34798900	that show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted so don't ever
34798900	34805140	you know don't feel embarrassed about that just you know if you're needing kind of a way to to
34805140	34811860	put it away uh deep down inside you just let one big sigh and say yeah you know what that's
34811860	34818500	fucked that situation's fucked but I'm here I'm doing it I'm crushing life you know I've gotten
34818500	34824500	through the worst days of my life every every worst day of every experience yet you're still here

35164100	35170580	else however the exception is that a the stupid sentence i've heard is uh love yourself first
35170580	35173860	before you love someone else or something like that shut the fuck up that's the most nonsense
35173860	35179140	statement i've ever heard everyone can share the love to any degree and that's my take on that sense

35394500	35400020	penicillin did it by a complete accident as well which was rather interesting uh it was just a
35400020	35405060	complete accident it casually discovers something that saves literally millions of lives can't uh
35405060	35409860	you know just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives
35409860	35417140	saved because of little accidental petri dish discovery um truly fascinating fascinating

35704980	35713940	hi strongy hi refling did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish
35713940	35724180	actor pierce raw brosnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife gain 100 pounds over
35724180	35731300	the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote made on the architects of peace home page
35731300	35737300	a world without wheels it's too terrible to imagine he did not write a book and call it that
35738820	35744500	stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote
35747060	35752900	oh my god that's outrageous outrageous but really funny

35769140	35775780	hi strongy your way of gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers i think if you did scott's
35776500	35786260	it'd be amazing is there a way to control my well on stream on youtube funny you mentioned that
35797220	35804580	have you considered using uh bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming
35804580	35809300	for the viewer something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when
35809300	35814980	they're low don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and
35814980	35820020	just want to order out strongy would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life

35829620	35836580	hypnosis and then after you've fallen asleep then i would do like that kind of
35837700	35846500	in in in planting you've got me thinking a lot of each one you've got me thinking the cogs are
35846500	35854820	turning you got me at help you go to sleep yes i think you could do it if you establish triggers
35854820	35865220	outside of youtube and use of any issue asi is way more insane i thought emi was uh having fun
35868500	35873620	asi's just yeah she doesn't like sharing of g fog sand sands or something that
35873620	35881300	has been sent somewhere else she doesn't like that that would be perfect imprinting on me oh my god

37095380	37100420	feel accomplished when you get night and then cooking i hope so i'm in the trenches right now
37100420	37101460	on this swordfish
37104820	37108020	she accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this
37114900	37118980	oh you can pass away if you drink too much water she actually uploaded it to me
37119460	37119940	ah
37122420	37128740	uh okay okay okay okay she already has a warning on her channel
37130180	37134260	Amy playing with fire but then again she is the pyromaniac of uh
37135140	37140660	veal or so right i'm right on par i can't believe i can't believe i found such a
37140660	37142820	lower friendly girl's smile
37146420	37153700	i have to admit i think i'm starting to lag a bit it's not looking good for me slowly
37153700	37161140	perishing i'm like dad make a tea but i don't think it's gonna wake me up but i think it's gonna
37161700	37167540	uh oh my stomach's making freaking weird ass noises can you hear that
37173140	37176980	what will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn
37176980	37181860	honestly i feel like i'm getting so close to it and i'm getting although the burn percentage
37181860	37189700	is 9.4 it used to be 18.9 she cut it out from the vod we're safe question mark i'm firmly of the
37189700	37199460	opinion there's such a thing as being too big what's 99 after cooking no we're just doing cooking
37199460	37206340	we might do some questing together because i'm not familiar with a lot of quests um but that would
37206340	37213380	just be very casual um probably level up combat a little bit before that um once we've achieved
37213380	37224100	99 cooking um i am not 99ing anything else i have severely underestimated how much this is
37229220	37235540	a strong expect full to the kaboom if you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a
37235540	37241380	kitten or it runs away that's so specific i'm probably never gonna retain this information
37244180	37248660	i'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time oh you're brave
37250260	37256980	and the other version of runescape levels go up to 120 did they take even longer to achieve
37260500	37265940	oh that's crazy sorry oh i'm having a wee on sorry
37266900	37282500	oh my god i'm in the money lads i'm sorry i really don't want to flex on you guys but we're in the money
37283220	37284740	oh
37293460	37299940	look ah whoa fill inventory no burn get ready get ready to ever said no burn
37302980	37307940	hold on hold on hold on so this is what it looked like a minute ago
37308260	37316260	so that was the last time i shared it with you 19.8 okay and the money didn't register but now the
37316260	37325460	money's registered are you ready to get flexed on where is it are you ready to get flexed on how
37325460	37333300	much money i made on that video boom that's right get flexed on to say that gen 2 has been funded
37333300	37337780	is an understatement that's how much money i've made what are you gonna do about them
37341620	37347940	it got limited ads so it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads
37347940	37352740	but you know what 10 bucks i'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes make sure you move
37352740	37359700	to a safe area or log out now your mama right i am going to go make a cup of tea then if it's
37359700	37366740	going to log me out so i can come back in getting 120 is getting 99 about eight times
37367300	37372100	pass on that no thanks how do people make a living off of youtube oh it's much better than
37372100	37380340	this when you have like a a lot of ASMR videos to offer um you make like money generated in the
37380340	37385620	background right i'm going to go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out um i will be back
37385620	37388100	i would just take me about three minutes because you can't leave the world

37679780	37681780	You
37709780	37711780	You
37739780	37741780	You

37776660	37778660	Hope no one's sleeping through this
37779260	37782580	Her account has gone too. Wait, who's the count? Look at that
37788020	37790020	What was I doing?
37790020	37792020	fish fish fish
37792660	37797740	I am starting to pass out. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting very tired. I'm a throats way of sore
37799780	37802100	Which is why I need refling tea
37803140	37805140	Not just any kind of honey tea
37806180	37808180	Log out timer is five minutes
37808340	37813060	The music was pretty loud. Okay, man. I apologize. I've got honey on my freaking finger as well
37814660	37820660	I'm not the good- I'm not my refling honey. I need a special refling honey. The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah
37822580	37824580	Monkey badness
37824580	37826580	I
37827220	37834740	Sleepy little refling because we're already snows together honestly. Oh, I'm I'm getting tired myself
37844740	37849940	Oh gee Hermes, thank you for becoming a member as a remainder
37851140	37853140	All membership streams
37853860	37854820	No
37854820	37858660	Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week
37859460	37861460	Next week is very busy
37862580	37864580	is next week when
37866100	37866980	Uh
37866980	37872180	Elden Ring comes out. It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so
37873300	37875300	The start of the week is gonna be like a
37876260	37880900	multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes
37884100	37888260	Refling tea you mean ink tea? Exactly. That's what my refling tea is
37889700	37891700	Passed it four times, but I got the tea
37893940	37895220	I bet oh my god
37895220	37900580	I love the stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god
37901460	37904660	Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after
37905380	37909300	How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up
37910740	37912740	What's good
37913860	37915860	Uh
37916580	37922660	Was good. Uh, we're going 10 and a half hours strong. We're wrapping up an hour
37923700	37931140	In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available
37931940	37933940	to read into or a zero
37934820	37936820	and
37936980	37941700	Oh, my tummy keeps making noises. It's because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?
37942260	37947620	No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adjubi, which is why my stomach's making
37948420	37954340	Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing
37954980	37959540	Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undetected brieflings? Oh, no
37959780	37962820	Is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?
37963620	37965620	But I don't have any money
37966020	37971460	How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done for me?
37971700	37973700	I
37975220	37977460	Get wrecked and connect for apparently
37980020	37982980	Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie
37983860	37985860	Hard hard to get me to crack
37986260	37990100	When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. Am I I wasn't kidding?
37991060	37995220	I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week. We've got like four. Maybe even five
37996020	37997620	Oh
37997620	38002980	Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick
38003700	38006180	I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick
38010980	38016980	Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah
38019860	38021860	Poor little
38022420	38024420	Needing something
38030980	38034020	One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered
38034740	38036340	bro
38036340	38042580	I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut
38043380	38053940	We formally request snitches. Mmm. Thank you for being my sugar daddy on RuneScape
38056100	38060740	Thank you for making it super easy real emmy versus strony connect for
38062900	38064900	The real
38065860	38072100	Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hasty. Oh my god, that's such a good
38073620	38078100	Uh, there's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?
38078100	38084340	There's a connect for minigame in RuneScape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once
38085060	38091620	Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake
38092020	38094280	Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention
38096580	38098900	And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like
38099860	38101860	With my mouth full of a burrito
38105620	38108980	If you're going to do agility there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it
38109780	38111780	I think when we do 99
38112420	38116660	Cookin will probably take a solid break from any RuneScape streams for a bit
38117060	38122340	Because there are a few other like multiplayer games I want to like focus on like Elden Rings like the next big
38123140	38125140	Like a thing we're taking on
38125700	38127700	and
38128260	38130260	I don't even hear my stomach
38132260	38135300	No, you can't the mic's not cover it is covering up
38136660	38142100	The stronies milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like
38142900	38147300	Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?
38149380	38151380	I think it may be silky
38153220	38155220	Worthing
38155300	38157140	Love these 20 things
38157140	38159140	Thank you for the smoothies
38159220	38161220	Also need to be on a members world for uh
38163460	38167780	I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay
38168660	38175620	Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings or stronies clearly the reeflings clearly
38183540	38188740	Wow, we're at 1.4 on the swordfish we may be able to finish it
38190340	38193860	We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However
38194820	38198260	You need to give strony the monkey not items. That's so specific
38199540	38201540	and
38201700	38206260	Eng would be salty if it's anything like squid ink. You've eaten squid ink before
38208420	38217460	You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6k territory at 1.6 million monkey not 287
38218260	38220260	I blame all my eyes
38220820	38226020	I'm on are you eating your fellow reeflings? What's going on here?
38242340	38243620	See be honest
38243620	38246740	You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't law
38246900	38251380	I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part
38251540	38256340	I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making
38256660	38263060	I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing
38266500	38274420	Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy
38274980	38279700	Oh emmy cannot see oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for
38282980	38285700	A reefling's gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo
38287940	38293460	Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like
38294100	38297700	I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right
38297700	38300660	So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget
38301620	38303620	I
38303940	38305940	Mods creases jays
38307380	38309380	You really want me to believe that? Yeah
38310740	38312740	I was like trying to think ahead
38320020	38322420	I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us always
38323860	38325860	Feels good, man
38331620	38333620	Wow
38334020	38336820	Okay, these swordfish are giving me like what
38337860	38340900	7k a batch that's not bad
38342340	38346180	Honestly not that bad. I know wine is more which is fine
38346900	38352020	But I think that's like 7k exp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay
38353620	38355620	Well spoke too soon on that one
38356580	38358580	I
38359140	38366820	Got some level up. It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time
38374420	38379860	What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I'm logged out
38380980	38384180	I got logged out against me will yeah, um
38385140	38391700	Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks
38392820	38394820	Not an endurance
38395060	38400260	Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor
38403220	38407460	And uh, I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe
38407460	38411460	But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette
38412020	38414980	You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe
38416100	38418100	It's been a good run, but
38418420	38421380	I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?
38422420	38424420	To me
38424980	38426980	To me
38428740	38430580	Riptoe
38430580	38433060	It's a great lineup. Yeah, I did um, I
38433700	38437140	Want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered
38437540	38442660	I need to go put emmy and icys memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream
38444100	38446100	So I need to
38446500	38448500	What do I need to do?
38450260	38452260	I need to
38453380	38455380	Do that
38455860	38460580	I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game
38461140	38464020	I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first
38464500	38469940	I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it
38471140	38474340	Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?
38475300	38478820	Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating. I don't know
38479620	38483860	Rips a big gripper. You will be missed literally both of them. No, no just the one
38485460	38490020	Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh no, do you think I've got da budus?
38490340	38492340	Um
38492420	38493940	Oh my god
38493940	38498500	streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within
38499460	38501220	one week
38501220	38503220	Diabetes hits hard on streamer
38507060	38510580	How many features do you see how many where we get no burns?
38514900	38519540	How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week
38520740	38525380	Um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then
38527140	38529140	Probably jellybean
38530580	38533860	I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it
38534500	38538820	Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago. I don't know how that would work
38540340	38546260	I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end
38546580	38552420	I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite
38552420	38554900	But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad
38555700	38559860	As far as i'm aware, they've like added in different game modes and stuff
38560980	38562980	um
38565140	38569540	I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and
38570740	38574100	Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it
38574180	38576340	Like we have to like turn left and right well
38578420	38580920	Call it momay win the jellybean game
38584100	38586900	It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point
38598020	38599700	It's just
38599700	38602340	Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it?
38603300	38609620	Is this the real life or is this just fantasy?
38611460	38618500	Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
38621380	38625220	Look in your eyes. I don't know the words and see
38628020	38630020	uh

38650740	38652740	Oh baby
38654100	38659700	Just can't wait to go just can't wait to go here. Is that the word?
38659700	38663700	I don't know. I don't know.
38663700	38665700	Um...
38665700	38668700	I was thinking about the in-game song. Oops.
38668700	38670700	My bad.
38670700	38673700	Where does- where does that go?
38673700	38678700	Easy come, easy go, little high, little low
38678700	38684700	Anyway the wind blows, it doesn't matter to me
38684700	38689700	I'm just a poor boy from a poor family, he's just a poor boy
38689700	38693700	Spare him his life from this monstrosity
38693700	38696700	Uh, how else does it go?
38696700	38701700	Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo, Galaleo
38701700	38704700	Oh no, no, no, let him go
38704700	38706700	Don't let him go
38706700	38710700	I can't remember how that freaking goes
38711700	38715700	What to unlock it so you can listen to it?
38715700	38719700	Though I finished these freaking swordfish before I fall asleep
38719700	38723700	I'm like so tired, my eyes are bulging out of their skull right now
38723700	38726700	I'm ready to snooze
38726700	38729700	Although I might level up actually, before I snooze
38729700	38732700	Best cover, let me go, we will not let you go
38732700	38734700	No, no, no, no, no
38734700	38737700	No, it's important, it's good
38738700	38742700	Best cover, oh yeah, did you enjoy that, me guessing all the lyrics of that entire thing
38742700	38745700	Cause I completely forgot how it works
38745700	38747700	That's like full level now
38747700	38752700	Wow, we're gonna be 78 by the end of this, feels good man
38752700	38755700	Feel good man
38759700	38762700	Oh excuse me for yelling
38762700	38765700	I'm so going to bed, oh my god
38768700	38772700	I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy
38776700	38780700	I'm just a perv, we fun, I need no sympathy
38783700	38785700	Wait what?
38785700	38788700	I wonder, I'm just a perv
38788700	38793700	Cause I have a mummy, mummy's losing the plot, that's what mummy's doing right now
38793700	38799700	I'm starting to get about H2O delirious up in here
38799700	38805700	There's a bird outside my window, the magpies are probably wondering why I haven't said them today
38809700	38812700	I can do it, I promise
38812700	38815700	I can do it, I can stay up, I'm totally not exhausted
38815700	38817700	But it's okay
38818700	38821700	I can make it happen
38821700	38823700	I can make it happen
38829700	38831700	Yay!
38831700	38834700	I didn't get any seratonin but I think it's cause I'm so tired
38834700	38836700	There's no seratonin left in my system
38836700	38839700	You don't have anything to burn on the fire, I do so
38839700	38843700	Level 78, let's go
38843700	38846700	Level 78
38846700	38849700	Well now I gotta adapt the learn
38849700	38852700	Yeah eventually seratonin only comes from netting it
38852700	38855700	Man this game was rigged from the start
38855700	38858700	Reach for the start
38859700	38860700	Yippee!
38860700	38865700	78, well I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on
38865700	38870700	But I'm still back at level 62
38870700	38872700	That's fine
38872700	38877700	Maybe Wayne cost a lot of money though, that's the only problem
38882700	38885700	Are we friends? I can do it
38885700	38888700	I can do it, you kid
38888700	38893700	I could also cook and not waste exp, she's passing out, oh yeah
38893700	38898700	Oh my god I'm actually, like this sleep is really starting to hit me
38898700	38900700	I don't even have my tea yet

38924700	38927700	I have my copper tea in my hand right now
38927700	38930700	I should probably go to sleep, I'm freaking ready to go

38934700	38937700	Are you squidding me right now?
38938700	38942700	Are you squidding me right now?

38984700	38986700	Didn't make it sad
38986700	38989700	What's your take on levelling up without OO, only to your level?
38989700	38992700	Oh no, you can level up all you want, it's perfectly fine too
38992700	38996700	For me personally, I'm not going to level up offline
38996700	39000700	Thank you again KFP Spidey for the gifted mumber

39057700	39062700	I've got 2 more hours until bedtime and I'm perishing
39062700	39066700	I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be the same
39067700	39072700	I don't want to end early though, the whole point is supposed to be endurance
39072700	39076700	Oh my god, this is like whacking me for the sake of my head
39079700	39083700	Normally I don't do

39165700	39171700	I'm like sipping honey tea, it's got caffeine in it, it's going to do absolutely nothing for me
39172700	39177700	A sugar crash, did I eat? Would that take away half sugar in it?

39375700	39377700	What does that mean?
39377700	39379700	What does that mean?
39380700	39382700	But the game ends up going offline
39382700	39385700	Oh, like the game updates for patches
39385700	39387700	Yeah, there he tags that, there he won
39387700	39390700	So on death's door, no!
39390700	39393700	Witchy-sans are supposed to be fairies
39394700	39398700	I don't know, we ended up being...
39398700	39403700	It's all in four, your tears are what I live for
39404700	39409700	Cause you should have picked Mercy
39410700	39415700	Should have picked any kind of girl of your...
39416700	39418700	Yeah, my tummy!
39418700	39420700	I don't know if you can hear those internal farts
39420700	39422700	But if you can hear the internal farts
39422700	39424700	I'm sorry, I had to be this way
39427700	39429700	Didn't I see this stream this morning?
39429700	39431700	Kinda was, yeah, yeah, you did
39431700	39432700	I'm a wee bit addicted
39432700	39434700	I'm starting to lose the plot though
39434700	39438700	So you're welcome to watch my Descent Into Madness
39438700	39440700	My filter is also gone
39440700	39444700	Because I'm starting to see things I know I'm not supposed to see
39444700	39447700	They're kinda just coming out, just like your ink, you know?
39449700	39450700	Only so much I can do
39450700	39453700	We're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorbys
39455700	39457700	Internal farts? No, they are internal farts
39457700	39459700	Well at least something's digested
39460700	39463700	But this must mean I'm discussing
39465700	39467700	To make myself wealthy
39467700	39470700	She's slowly dying from my innocence
39475700	39478700	I came in at work quite tired and feisty
39478700	39481700	Wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar
39481700	39485700	Are we done it? Are we taking down the big companies?
39486700	39490700	Eleven hour grind set, interest of thoughts are in taking the wheel
39491700	39493700	Take the wheel
39495700	39497700	Man, really?
39497700	39499700	Oh, I completely started to do that
39499700	39501700	Man, RuneScape is really...
39501700	39502700	OG
39502700	39504700	Yes, old school RuneScape
39504700	39507700	RuneScape 3, which is the new one, I think
39507700	39510700	Not really played that at all
39510700	39512700	I didn't actually understand
39513700	39515700	When it came out, there was two different games
39515700	39518700	And I think I actually ended up playing RuneScape 3
39518700	39520700	For a little bit like a dummy
39520700	39522700	Because I was like, why is the game so different?
39522700	39524700	Why did they do that?
39525700	39527700	Or was it they made RuneScape 3
39527700	39529700	And then everyone was like, ooh, go back
39529700	39532700	And then they were like, okay, there's now two games
39534700	39536700	These are the golden hours
39536700	39537700	So this is the last bit
39537700	39540700	Uh, not quite, we've still got...
39543700	39545700	50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes
39545700	39547700	50 minutes ago, but...
39547700	39548700	There's three?
39548700	39550700	I thought there was like RuneScape 3
39550700	39553700	Wasn't the new RuneScape called RuneScape 3?
39553700	39555700	It's really OG-san
39557700	39559700	Get it? Cause that's how I say OG
39560700	39563700	RuneScape 3 is the original server from that
39563700	39565700	Old-school RuneScape is them
39565700	39567700	We put in the old game back
39567700	39569700	Oh, okay
39569700	39572700	Cause they did a World of Warcraft do that as well
39572700	39575700	There's like an old world warcraft
39575700	39576700	Oh my god
39576700	39581700	My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do
39581700	39582700	Wah!
39586700	39588700	You said three batches before, this is a lot...
39588700	39590700	No, come on
39593700	39596700	Oh, almost just knocked over my cola everywhere
39597700	39599700	I really should clean this up
39599700	39601700	But what happens if I feel not...
39601700	39603700	Stop opening up the collection
39603700	39605700	And stop eating the swordfish
39605700	39607700	We're gonna sell that, we need that money
39607700	39609700	Okay, we're at 900 now
39610700	39611700	Wah
39614700	39615700	Wah
39615700	39617700	How big is an inventory?
39617700	39622700	4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28
39622700	39623700	Okay
39623700	39626700	By the 28, that's like...
39626700	39629700	4 for every 100
39634700	39636700	Refling on time
39642700	39644700	Play both just...
39644700	39646700	Wait, what did you say?
39646700	39647700	Just play both
39647700	39650700	It's not like this game is grindy or anything
39650700	39652700	Are you gonna disappoint us or not?
39652700	39655700	No, I'm not gonna disappoint and I'm freaking doing it
39655700	39657700	I'm freaking...
39657700	39659700	I'm cooking the swordfish
39659700	39664700	I'm cooking my ancestors and my cousins and stuff
39664700	39666700	Cause get it? Cause I'm a cultfish?
39670700	39672700	Are you refling?
39672700	39675700	You're requesting us to go open it
39675700	39676700	Wah!
39678700	39680700	Are you refling?
39681700	39684700	Are you even losing that ability to read right now?
39684700	39686700	I don't think you said that
39686700	39688700	Holy crap
39688700	39691700	As you're refling, you're requesting me to go open it
39691700	39693700	Okay, that looks more like English
39693700	39696700	Go to sleep... No, you go to sleep
39696700	39698700	Go to sleep when...
39700700	39702700	When something happens
39702700	39704700	Go
39708700	39710700	I'm gonna... I can do endurance stream
39710700	39712700	Literally, I don't want to lose my endurance title
39712700	39715700	Like 2 cent meters of playing the game
39715700	39717700	Wah
39718700	39721700	I'll only go to sleep if you come with me
39721700	39723700	Come with me
39723700	39726700	Oh no, it's the wrong one, it's that Japanese song
39726700	39728700	Stay with me
39733700	39736700	Ta-da-da-da-da
39736700	39738700	I don't know how the rest of it goes
39741700	39744700	I'll only sleep if you decide to sleep as well
39744700	39746700	Yeah
39746700	39748700	Self-hypnotism by exhaustion
39748700	39750700	This is working apparently
39750700	39752700	No
39752700	39755700	You've been streaming for 11 hours
39755700	39758700	Nobody's taking your endurance stream title from you
39759700	39764700	I'm just gonna eat this little cheeky
39764700	39767700	Cheeky swordfish on a Sunday afternoon
39767700	39769700	I don't even know what day of the week is
39769700	39771700	You know what day of the week is?
39771700	39773700	Stream day
39773700	39776700	I like it, it'll be more and more weekly
39780700	39782700	Imagine if I could swim
39782700	39784700	Oh
39786700	39788700	Then for that time I got hired to sing
39790700	39793700	Right, stop it, that's naughty
39794700	39796700	That's naughty
39796700	39798700	Okay, we're almost finished with the swordfish
39801700	39807700	You're beginning to feel very, very sleepy
39807700	39811700	Why are you talking like a vampire
39813700	39815700	Hmm
39816700	39818700	Stay with me
39827700	39829700	What are they even talking about, honestly?
39829700	39832700	I feel like I'm eavesdropping to see what they're talking about
39832700	39834700	I'll wait for their new message to pop up
39834700	39838700	And I'll start commenting on what the rooflings are talking about to each other
39838700	39841700	They'll never expect it
39841700	39844700	Oh, for goodness sake, I don't know how to keep them up
39847700	39849700	Boom, boom, look at that name
39849700	39851700	They're teak, no
39851700	39853700	Please leave it alone
39854700	39856700	She collected again
39856700	39858700	Oh, I'm not late to collect
39859700	39861700	It's because I'm a waman
39861700	39863700	My mistakes is I'm even in runescape
39863700	39865700	I'm sorry, that's not nice
39865700	39868700	You can just play the waman card whenever you want
39868700	39870700	That's kind of funny though
39872700	39880700	I don't know why you're right-clicking at
39880700	39882700	I don't know, maybe I'll right-click you
39882700	39884700	What are you gonna do about that?
39884700	39886700	Right-click is funny enough
39889700	39891700	Collect your ink
39892700	39895700	Look into the mirror, you're not giving
39895700	39898700	We're talking about time-spanning games
39898700	39901700	Is your rune-crafting world still up?
39901700	39903700	I remember the old rune-crafting
39903700	39905700	I don't know what that means
39905700	39907700	But thank you for your question
39907700	39909700	The answer is probably no, smile
39909700	39912700	I don't know anything about runescape
39912700	39914700	Good night, scrawny and everyone
39914700	39916700	I'm going to sleep
39916700	39918700	Rest well
39918700	39920700	Go
39920700	39922700	Twinkle, twinkle
39922700	39924700	Look for
39924700	39926700	How I wonder
39926700	39928700	What you are
39928700	39932700	Up above the world so high
39932700	39936700	Like a diamond in the sky
39936700	39938700	Twinkle, twinkle
39938700	39941700	I swear if anyone puts anything under 18
39941700	39943700	To that question, you're all done
39950700	39953700	Okay, we've got 45 minutes or something like that
39953700	39955700	Oh no, now we've got 50
39955700	39957700	No, we've got less than 50 minutes
39957700	39959700	We've got 49 minutes
39959700	39961700	Because the board breaks all of them
39972700	39976700	Should I write the girl's marrows as a prank?
39976700	39978700	We could do that
39979700	39983700	You pretend to not be me and write the girl's marrows
39983700	39986700	And say the most terrible stuff in there
39994700	39996700	Do it, do an extremely spicy one
39996700	39999700	Okay, who should we do for us?
39999700	40001700	Mods, can I give you permission to speak
40001700	40003700	So you give me the girl's links and I'll write some stuff
40003700	40005700	And then I'll wash my hands as I should
40014700	40016700	And
40018700	40021700	So I only mentioned things that only you would know
40021700	40023700	The girls aren't gonna know who we're doing
40023700	40025700	Azura, oh my god, okay
40025700	40027700	Let's go to Azura
40031700	40035700	Big, juicy, choco knockers
40037700	40039700	You are so beautiful
40039700	40042700	Your voice is so beautiful
40042700	40045700	Your personality so beautiful
40045700	40048700	Beautiful
40048700	40054700	You are a blessing upon my life and yet
40054700	40059700	You are the goddess who gives blessings
40059700	40062700	But I am already blessed
40062700	40068700	You didn't have to give me, you didn't have to give me the blessing
40068700	40070700	God, I love you
40070700	40072700	Chocolate milkers
40072700	40074700	Good night, Azura
40074700	40076700	You are loved
40076700	40078700	Okay, that's Azura done

40115700	40117700	Okay, I'm stressed
40117700	40120700	Wait, oh, where did you go?
40121700	40124700	You're so tiny and cute
40125700	40128700	Oh my god, I'm going to be an OG-san
40128700	40132700	I'm a self-identified OG-san
40132700	40136700	And my god, you're so tiny
40136700	40140700	I want to care for you forever
40140700	40146700	I want to do what I can to make you happy, little cub
40147700	40151700	I love that you call yourself cub
40151700	40154700	It's too adorable
40154700	40159700	My old man, OG-san, heart can't take it
40159700	40163700	As long as you're happy
40163700	40166700	I am happy, little cub
40167700	40176700	Let me make you happy with my OG-san
40176700	40178700	Oh, no, you can't say that
40178700	40183700	Let me make you happy with OG-san's body
40183700	40185700	OG-san's body
40185700	40187700	Okay, there we go, send
40190700	40192700	Okay, more swordfish
40193700	40196700	Who's next?
40200700	40203700	I'd like to burn the swordfish, please
40203700	40204700	Who's next?
40204700	40207700	Emi, oh, where'd I even begin?
40210700	40213700	I wish for you to perish me
40214700	40219700	Then laugh in my face as you raise me
40219700	40223700	Back and forth with your, with your what?
40223700	40227700	With your, your powers, your powers?
40227700	40230700	With your powers
40230700	40234700	I want to be humiliated
40234700	40235700	Oh god, she's going to notice me
40235700	40237700	Because I can't spell humiliated
40237700	40241700	I want to be humiliated by you over and over
40241700	40244700	I want to see that
40245700	40250700	Shit, shit, eaten, grin
40250700	40257700	As I disappoint you and take any punishment you deserve
40257700	40260700	I love you, holsys
40265700	40266700	Like three?
40266700	40267700	Yeah, three
40267700	40270700	I need to send one to myself
40270700	40273700	I need to send one to myself
40277700	40279700	Where is that?
40279700	40281700	We've got mercy
40283700	40285700	Okay, I'll go, go to site
40289700	40293700	I can't wait for the day you break in
40293700	40299700	and catch me watching another VTuber
40299700	40301700	that isn't you
40301700	40304700	It's one big mistake, of course
40304700	40309700	but you can't help but become feral
40309700	40312700	at the switch of a button
40312700	40315700	No, you can't help but become feral at the site
40315700	40318700	and completely enraged
40318700	40324700	before you know it, we're, we're dancing
40325700	40330700	Before you know it, we're, we're, well
40330700	40334700	I don't have clothes, I don't have clothes
40334700	40339700	clothes on in this scenario
