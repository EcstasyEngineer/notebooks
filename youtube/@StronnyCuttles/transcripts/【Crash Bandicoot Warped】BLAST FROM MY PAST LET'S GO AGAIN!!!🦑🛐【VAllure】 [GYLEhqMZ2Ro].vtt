00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Mummy, the mummy hasn't abandoned no thing.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Mummy is in a foolish, foolish streamer.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
When I did the footstream, I put my ring light,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I had to move my ring light so I could,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
a little bit of shit and it would be done with the wall.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
As it eliminate that mummy started streaming on her hands and knees,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
it's not what she did.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh, I need the ring light.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
The thing that's happening is the goofy and it's jumping about everywhere.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Everyone, hold on.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, but it's going to be light.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Please, it's going to be light.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Okay.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Alright, my face is eliminated.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm also on reactive mode, so I'm actually going to react to the game.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Everyone knows I have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
with 10,067 megabits.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, good morning.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Let me put on live chat, any live chatter.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I apologize if I sound tired.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I passed out after that RuneScape stream,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
and I woke up 45 minutes ago.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I hope Icy's monetization stream went fantastic.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I believe Emmys is also today,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
so if there's any pin pals or snowberries,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
they're down the hall.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Into the lift.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I apologize if I sound tired.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I am exhausted.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't know how.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I slept for so long.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't know what earth is going on with me.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
But I've got cup of tea, I've got two waters,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I've got a wee muffin,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
and then we can jump into Crash Bandicoot.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
As for any updates, since I slept,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I have absolutely nothing.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
A Riefling sent me a three page story,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
which I really liked,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
but for legal reasons,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I cannot speak any of it here.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
I've also put together a little folder of Bibbius,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
which I don't know why I didn't think to do earlier.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
But now, now I'm putting it all together.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, and a Riefling sent me a five minute audio.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And he was like, talk, yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I was like, oh my God,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Rieflings are getting so brave, honestly.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And before I die a lot, probably,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
probably, I'm not even going to put it behind me.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't know what level the desktop,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
how loud the game's going to be compared to me,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
but give me a three page story.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
It was about me, obviously.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
But yes, you guys have been doing fantastic.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I believe AC's doing well.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
There's, I don't really have any updates

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
about anything else at the moment.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Other than my freaking ASMR meme video,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I've got 30 key views and I'm like, right,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
this has definitely left the target audience,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
because I had 5,000 subscribers when I posted that,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
and now we're at 6,000.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm like, bro, that like propelled my channel.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So I'm waiting,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Mercy's is going to go up after the stream

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
or, or it's going to go up after

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
she finishes her stream today.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And then AC's is ready to go up.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I may, actually, I'm going to message her

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
right now so she can reply to me.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Now let's see, when you finished stream,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
do you want me to upload your meme ASMR

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
on your behalf question mark?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And before you're like, wait,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
why are you asking the girls permission

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
to do stuff that you made for them?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Because it's their channels.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I don't want them to be unhappy.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I want them to be happy little ducklings with me.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Who up?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Bandy their cooter.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Whoa.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm getting a bit too close with that one.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Any Bandy girls.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's running such a sweetheart.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Yes, I don't want to do anything that upsets the girls.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
And if they're like, no,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
now's not the time to upload the meme ASMR.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I won't upload the meme ASMR.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That's fine.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
So I'll get permission from them

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
and then possibly after the stream.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Apparently it takes eight hours to do this game.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Now, I'm going to just say,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I was a atom when I played this game.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I have barely any recollection.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
My dad didn't buy it for me.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
He bought it for himself.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Johnny, congrats on 6.5K.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
No, I also made ASMR videos.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I was going to try and get my first thank you video out.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Or maybe after a buckshot roulette after the doc.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because I've got buckshot roulette.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Then I've got a couple of hours.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Then I go to the doctor.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Is this a rhythm game?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It is not.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's Crash Bandicoot.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It is an adventure platformer.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I know you can't hear the background of the game right now.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So it's just my voice in this room.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Do forgive.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Johnny, when in a gang?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Any ganky desks?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Hold on.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Let me hydrate with my tea.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I owe so much ASMR.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I do have it all recorded.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I just need to sit and edit it.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And I can't upload the clapping without

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
using my hands ASMR.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yet.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I need to have some things in between it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Strongly winning much in everything, right?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It's a never-ending move.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Every time she releases an ASMR, she gains 1K

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
and she gets to go back to square one.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Honestly, I'm like, I hope not.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I think it will definitely calm down a bit.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It's going to have to calm down.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Because as much as our capitalist overlords

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
love infinite growth, that's just not plausible here.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Is it something that is healthy or thingy?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Because if you start measuring yourself by numbers

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and that kind of thing, that's when...

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I think that's when VTubers probably get it in their head.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
They're like, oh, I'm not doing well enough.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm not performing well enough.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
And it's like, brav.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You haven't even given yourself a chance.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Just have fun.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
People can tell you're sweating on trends

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
if you're trying to sweat on trends, you know?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And then people can tell when you're just memeing around

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
or you're just memeing around, you know?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And guess what?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Some streamers...

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Sorry, this is just turning into a philosophical...

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Let's digest and get to the roots of why streamers are streamers.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Some people are just...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
What's the word?

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Optimised to have a nice, cosy, tight-knit community.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Some people, some of your personalities, other streamers,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
you're just supposed to have a nice little tight-knit community.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You're not supposed to be for the masses, you know?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
So don't always be reaching for the fricking stratosphere, the stars.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Don't always be reaching for the stars when you do just fine in the stratosphere, you know?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Every time you gain 1k, you release an ASMR that gains you 1k.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's an infinite feedback loop you'll be at.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Infinity subs by the end of the week.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Not quite.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Especially those looking to extract numbers from TikTok

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
that only have 100 subs but say they deserve a million views on every post.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yes.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I can actually get into the psychology on why people

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
feel they deserve subscribers

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
versus others who feel unworthy

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
of what they get because of what they've done.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I could definitely go on an algorithm stream that in...

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Not tinfoil time!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
No, it's not tinfoil! It's not tinfoil!

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's not tinfoil.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It's like actually, it's like human psychology

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
as well as the damage that the internet does to the mind.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Because if you didn't know, you're actually not supposed to be exposed to...

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
I think you're not supposed to actually know more than 100 faces at once.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And your brain is just not wired for any other way.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
After that, your brain can only be wired to recognize tribes,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
which sounds terrible, but that's just how it is.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So it's like, ah, I am approaching the AC clan, you know?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Or the tribe.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Are you studying psychology?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Absolutely not.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I have had enough of education.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm not...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I say that I might be going back to beauty school,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
but that's for...

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm talking like five years down the line beauty school type thing.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Because I might want to run an ASMR room studio type thing.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But that's just me.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
That's just me.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Neither tinfoil hat or more.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Do the reeflings?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Honestly, I'm so down for that.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I need the meds to moat back.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I need the thigh gripper moat back.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
All other emotes that I need back.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I was actually going to ask if a reefling has any batch to emotes,

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
wink, wink, if you could send me a cat box file of the batch itself.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So I know what to reorder.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Because I picked what I wanted.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Just so you know.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Just so we're all on the same...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I picked what I wanted.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh yeah, Crash Bandicoot 3.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes, so I was bought an atom and my dad bought this game for himself.

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
And the only thing I remember doing on this game is playing Coco on China

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and using the horse all the time.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Eh, the horse?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
The tiger all the time.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Eh, I'll have to catch stream later as I'm working on 80 slides of insurance termed out.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Ooh!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Even the thought of that is terrible.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I don't know what's going on with my tees.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I've not been enjoying them as of late.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm getting a bit...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm getting nervous.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm getting a bit shaky why I'm not enjoying my tees.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Because normally I'm all over them.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Although I have been enjoying this fruit juice company thing

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
and they put loads of fruit in the juice

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
and then they juice it

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and then I drink the juice

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
and then I get all the goodness in me.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I've had too many teas.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
This is a very plausible and realistic sense.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Although I've only had one tea the day.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I literally only...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I woke up like...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, I woke up an hour ago now.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I woke up, spammed the PC on,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
started spamming pre-chat for a few moments,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
checked out AC to see what's going on with her.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
She's fine.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Checked out the Discord to see if the girls are fine.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
They're fine.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Refillings lacking flavour lately.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
You're not enjoying the tea because it's all just special, aren't you?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh my god.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
It sounds terrible, but should I just get a cola?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't think drinking a cola first thing in the morning

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
is a good idea, though.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
It's a terrible idea.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Okay, let's get into Crash Bandicoot.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Any Crash Bandicooters?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Is that too loud?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Or is that fine?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh my god.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
How do I leave?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, my controller isn't even awake.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Hold on.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, plug my controller in.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
So there's three games in it.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I've only ever played Warped.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't know what the other two are about.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I guess the game.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Override save.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Is it too loud?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Guys, groovy as anything.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Maybe turn it down a little.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, I'll do it in the start menu after the cutscene.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
We're crashing?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I guess we are called Crash Bandicoot.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Thank you.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Free at last.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh my god, that's so beautiful.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh, it kind of looks like a snowberry.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Ooga, ooga is free.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
No, it cannot be.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Evil, great evil has come.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh my god, this is so beautiful, this game.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Bandicoot.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Wait, it's a Tiki Mask, like Earth Tiki Mask.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I know we've had a few unfortunate setbacks.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Insane.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Insane.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, I don't remember any of this.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Fuck it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That was a flashbang first thing in the morning.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Did you see that?

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
I can't see anymore.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Oh my god, this game is so beautiful and cool.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
For real, I think I just got a virus.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I remember something like that.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh my gosh, that was so beautiful.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Wait, hold on.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I need to turn down the volume a little bit.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
My apologies.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
Game option, music 8.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Wait.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I could do this all day.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
We'll do 8s.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh my god.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Oh wait, you can't control the camera angle.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
What does Y do?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Y shows me my light, what does B do?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
No.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
Oh my god, POV, I'm coming for AC.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I'm a Snow Berry going for AC.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh my god, on the prowl, on the prowl.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh my god, this is so precious.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
This is so cool.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh my god, wait, I remember these symbols a little bit.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh look, I have a mask helping me too.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
No.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I'll find out which one is more powerful.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Soon enough.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean, it's more powerful because I'm the goodie.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You're the baddie.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh my god.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Wait, where does this work?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh my god.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh my god, this is like, you can.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh my god, we flints, we're already on the farm.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
10 out of 10 game, we're already on the farm.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Right, how do I do that?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
To jump, to spin, to crouch for inventory.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Why would I need to see my inventory?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I guess if you're going for like 100%, but...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Wee!

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh my god, we can bomb.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
This game is beautiful.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I remember that I don't need to hurt it.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh no, we spanked the goat.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Right, we spanked it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
We didn't kill it.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
We spanked it away.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay, it's fine.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
What's this?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh my god.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh my god.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh no.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Thank you for the 5.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay, I can definitely take full damage.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh my...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Checkpoint!

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm remembering.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Wait, go back on the farm.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
What does this do?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Okay, if you hit it at a certain time.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh my god, we're on the farm.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Right, frogs.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Frogs can hurt us.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Go back on the farm, where you belong.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Go ahead.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Oh my god, I can spank everyone.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Oh, I love this game.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Wait, how about if I get 2 to go because...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, he's glowing.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh, you are glowing.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
What the heck is it?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
What did I do?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Where am I going?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Oh no.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
What's this?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Oh, it's bone.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I got an achievement for doing this.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It's a bonus level.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Wow, what?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Bum bum bum.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Bum bum bum.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Is this just like free apples?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh my apples.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I never picked them up.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh my god, that's so cool.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Who found the dream?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The bleeding hearts are getting spanked.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
For real.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
A wimpa fruit.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
A wimpa fruit.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
One puff fruit.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Go back to the farm.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, we trick shot with it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
The bleeding heart.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
We trick shot it.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Go back to the farm.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
No frog for Gen 2.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Uh...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Oh my god, Sheebie really wants a slim girl for Gen 2.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't know how to break it to her.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
She really wants a Gen 2.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm just like, maybe I'll give Sheebie a Halloween outfit.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Wait, have we already been here before?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Or is this just kind of the same layout?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Okay, and it's spanked.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
What?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Pink!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Why is there a gap in this bridge?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
We need someone who works with stone to fix the bridge.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
No slim girl?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
No, maybe I'll give Sheebie a slim Halloween outfit.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
How about that?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Slim girls.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I get the...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Oh, wait, so if you miss it, you'll...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Okay!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I missed a box!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Stinky, I don't know where it was.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Slim girls are my favorite monster girl.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, but slimes are hot.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm not sure.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I don't know.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh, they came out of my earhole.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Oops.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And then we just go back in Ninja 2?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Oh my gosh, that's cool.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
This game is easy.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I like how fun and easy it is.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Lamia is all my favorite.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I would entertain a Lamia.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, the fisher thing.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
To kick fast.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Whoa!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Whoa! Okay, wait, that was very dumb.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Sorry. That was incredibly dumb.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Whoa!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
This game is so pretty.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Sorry.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I've not got much accuracy under the war,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
even though I'm a cuttlefish.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I don't want to...

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
That just like will pass them.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Wait, that's a checkpoint.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh my gosh!

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I remember something like this.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I used to be so scared of it as a child.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I thought I only remembered Coco.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I can hear a box back there.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Wait, what does that shark do?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Please email him.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Oh, there's a sand dollar.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
On the ground.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Wow, there's...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Jeez, this game is so cute.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I can't believe I didn't play this before.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Well, I mean...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Sorry, I got scared.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I don't know if I can hurt those pufferfish.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Checkpoint.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Why checkpoint?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
What's here that shouldn't be here?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Is there something below that's going to kill me?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Because why did I get a checkpoint?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You can switch to play Coco!

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh!

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Oh my gosh!

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
What? I don't wonder this game did so good.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like so creative.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh, there is hidden boxes under the coral reef!

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's okay.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
We're not going for 100%

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
because I don't know how to 100% this game.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
But we can go for lots of fruit.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, yummy yummy fruit.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh, I can beat shark up in this.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And I can explode things in this.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Let's go.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh no, I broke it.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm sorry.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I'm a bit of a klutz. I accidentally broke it.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Dun dun dun.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh wait, that's not the song anymore.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's whatever the underwater.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Sure, we'll get these boxes.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I think it's safe for now.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Oh my god.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What do you mean I'm so in love with a game

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
that's got the difficulty for literal children?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I can't believe it.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
The accusations are unfounded.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I play Skyrim on Legendary mode just because you can.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It doesn't mean you need to be...

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Wait, can I hurt this?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Oh no, I can beat up the little puffer fish.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh, the purple puffers.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Okay, there we go.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, there's the prank crystal.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Okay, let's get it.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Wait, is that going to explode?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Oh wow!

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
If you don't do it in time, it becomes a solid.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay, that's curious.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Is it hard to get 100%?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, I missed a lot of boxes this time.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Didn't do that good this time.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That's okay.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I'm happy just loving everything.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The scene remains me so much of Jack and Dax though.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Jack and Dax.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Oh, I threw that one up this time.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So it doesn't always come out your ear.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Wee!

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The Orion Express.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Coco!

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, this is the mission!

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Oh my god, this is the mission!

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Ah!

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Coco!

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And what's the tiger's name?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh my god!

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh my god!

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh my god!

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I know it's like first thing in the morning,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
but I'm so happy!

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh my god, this is the mission that I always

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
remember from childhood.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh my god, go Coco!

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Go Coco!

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
You did it!

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You're so beautiful!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Oh my god, it's the music!

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Ah!

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh my god, get it, get it, get it!

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Yes!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Oh no, I hurt myself.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I didn't know what I was supposed to do there.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I forgot, but I got a checkpoint.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh, I jumped into it!

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Coco, no!

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Oh, but it's okay.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
The tiger forgives me for being a terrible driver.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Oh, I did it again!

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Oh shit, stop jumping!

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Stop jumping!

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Okay, no more jumping.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
No jumpies, jumpies now.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But no jumpies.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And then big boy jumpies!

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Oh, I missed!

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
What the heck, I was so close!

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oh, if I run ahead, I can attack.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Wee!

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Rawr!

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Tiger!

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Ah, how can you...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh no!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It's so bad!

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh my god!

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Wait, what happens if I run out of lives?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Is it over?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Is it over for me?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
This is over for Mesh.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Wait, can I just run ahead and hurt them?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Wee!

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Rawr, there was a freaking leap in a half!

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Call me Jewel Leeper,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
because one tiger run is all it takes.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Wee!

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh my god!

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
This is such a good machine!

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, my little tiger!

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Soft kitty, warm kitty,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
little ball of fluff.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh, that's the best mission

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
in the entire game.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Okay, we can end stream them.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
That's all we needed to do.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Wee!

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
That's all we needed to do.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh!

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know what the diamond is.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Right, what we got next?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
The Boneyard!

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
There are like three more of that?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Oh my god!

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
What?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Oh no!

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Neurons activated from childhood.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh no!

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I think I get chased

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
this entire mission!

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh no!

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Oh no!

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
There's lava everywhere!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It's jumping faster!

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Oh, I don't know, I'm jumping faster!

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh my god!

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Why did you do that? Crash!

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Crash, why did you do that?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Crash, jump! Crash!

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Crash, you need to jump!

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Like, double jump!

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Whoa, wait, I can't do it!

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Wait, can I just stay here forever

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
in the tower?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Is that a Tyrannosaurus talk or something like that?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Wait, why can I not jump that?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Can you double jump it again?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Is it...

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, is it that? Jump, spin?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Whoa, I could hardly get over that!

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh no!

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I can't believe it, childhood

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
me strikes again.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Can I not double jump?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Hold the jump!

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Hold the jump?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
What the heck? I'm not going to make it!

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I'm going to run out of lava!

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh no!

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Wait!

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Wait, it's not doing anything!

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Hold on, let's practice.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Jump, uh!

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Uh, uh, uh!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Ah!

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know how to double jump!

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Uh, uh, uh!

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Uh, uh, uh!

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
It's not letting me double jump!

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Oh, it is letting me double jump!

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Wait, but I jumped right into it!

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Oh my god!

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
It's so over and the stream

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
hasn't even freaking started!

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I can't figure it double jump!

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Is my input wrong?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm holding A on my controller.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
There is no double jump.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Uh, uh!

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I'm getting so confused.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Is this a child's game or not?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Answer me!

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Is this game for kids to complete or not?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It's not looking good.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Can't even get through the first freaking jump!

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Woo!

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Hey!

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Dash jump is one way.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Is for kids.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm getting filtered by level 3.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I actually am!

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't know how to go through this.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Level 3, I actually am!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I don't know how to do it!

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm, like, trying to extend the jump.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
But there's nothing to extend it.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's just a straight magma jump!

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Woo!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You unlock double jump after beating a boss.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Wait, so leave and then go to see a boss

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
and come back?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Are you holding your jump button

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
down instead of tapping?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
If I tap, hold,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
tap.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Holding, tapping.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Right, hold A.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Holding A!

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Fuck!

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Holding A!

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
This is me holding A!

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Okay.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It just seems to be, like, so tiny and

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
slate.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Like, minuscule.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Woo!

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Right, this is the furthest I've ever got.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Don't mess up now.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Okay.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I need a breather, honestly.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Right, I'm just going to keep going.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Oh my god!

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Why is that so hard?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, that's TNT!

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Wee!

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That's more TNT!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
They explode!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Okay, we did it.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Oh, gee willikers, I sure hope we don't have to do

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
that segment again, because, uh,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
what the heck? Why is that so hard?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I literally have no double jump open.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
You should try jumping over them.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Taming matters.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
What's this?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Oh, a platform?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't have access to it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Golly, you scared me.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Oh my god, it's discord nature!

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Is this...

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
What does that do?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Okay, well,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I remember what it does now.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Wait, can I do this?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Go away, you're so creepy!

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
What are you?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Oh, bonus time, bonus time!

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
That's what it does.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Don't touch the nature.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
No discord daddies.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Or no discord groomers in the velar.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Good luck.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Wow.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Bence?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Bounce?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh my god, I get free life.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Well, I definitely needed that after how...

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh!

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
He just scooted.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Why is he so slow when he crouches though?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay, I like the bonus distance.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Where's the key?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Try to tap crouch

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
when walking to get faster.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Tap crouch while walking.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Oh, every hundred apples,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I get a life.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Ah, those things are so scary.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
For a duke.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Exclamation mark.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What the heck did I just do?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Oh no, I was supposed to jump.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I missed the jump.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Oopsies, I was supposed to jump on top of them.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Oh good.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I don't like this camera angle.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
No, this is why I didn't like the camera angle.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It felt like I was going to get chased again.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Okay, give me the checkpoint at least.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, there's...

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Gate the way up.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Oh no!

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
What was that?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Crash?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Did you just stand on lava and let me win?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh my god, the game feels so bad for me.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That is letting me win.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It feels so bad for me.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Please don't slow me down.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Oh my god, get me out of here.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh, get me out of here.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I'm not playing this level again.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Wampa Fruits, they're wampas.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Oh my god, the game felt so bad

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
it let me walk on lava.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Oh, that came up more.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Honestly, me right now.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Did I do four there?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Yes, I did. Right, we're not playing that one again.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That one was stinky. We're doing five.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
We're doing...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Oh, Coco!

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
What's this one?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It's me.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Eh?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
To accelerate, right trigger.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
There's no backwards.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Oh my god, it's so wobbly, wobbly.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Whee!

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Jump shot.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Wah!

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yoo-hoo!

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Oh my god, this is...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh, there's a bomba.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Wait, wait, let me get the bomb.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh, 360.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That's okay. 360!

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
She's actually doing spins.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm not doing any input for her

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
to do those spins, by the way.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm just jumping on it.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, there's bombas!

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Bomba!

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Oh no, I've only got seven lives.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Oh well, I just regained a new one.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Okay.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
This is a child's game. Children can play this.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
So I can play this.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm wise enough to play a child's game.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Surely.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Surely I won't have to run out of lives.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
If I play at the same level

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
over and over,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Dad just gets infinite lives.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because we might have to farm lives

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
unironically.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Right, hold on. What's going on here?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
No. Yes.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Yes. Okay, we made it and we're going to get this checkpoint.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Wah!

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Eh, excuse me.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I said we're going to get this checkpoint.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Oh my god.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It's edging me right now.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Wah!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Oh, that was close. That was close.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I was a bit too close for comfort.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Timon's going to be fine. It's fine.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Oh, there's a seagull!

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Slow it down. Slow it down.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Slow and steady.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
When's the race?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Then you need to go 100 miles per minute.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Wah!

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Honestly.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Good game.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I am going to drop into the bomb.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
But I didn't because I'm so

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
emotional at this child's game.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Wah!

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Oh, there's two bombs. That's cheeky.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
The devs did that for a reason.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
They knew I was going to be greedy

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
and go for the bomba.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Hello?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Okay. Holy crap.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I was like, can I even go near that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
wall?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Steady, easy, easy.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Take it easy.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Steady.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I'd say someone steady when's the race.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
But sometimes, sometimes you got to

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
just send it and get out of here.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Oh my god.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Oh, this is so good.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Who suggested this game?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Congrats on you if you suggested it.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Just kidding. I picked it

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
because it's a childhood game.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Okay.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Okay.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The boss fight.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Oh, no.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Tiny Tiger.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Oh, no.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm not going to get perished by a boss.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Crash.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Crash.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Sometimes he has...

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh, no.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Oh, the music is banging, though.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh!

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh, no.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
MonkaS?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
MonkaS? What'd I do?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Ah!

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Please leave me alone.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Oh my god, he's got J's on like me.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Spank.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Okay. It's fine.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
One and three.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
What does that mean?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
What does that mean?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
There's Tigers!

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm to avoid...

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
everything?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
What?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm to avoid all those Tigers?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Spank

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And then Tigers, right? We can do this.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
We can do this.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Okay. Take your time.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Uh-huh.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Uh-huh.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Okay. Okay. I just got a little caught up in this.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
The last one.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Okay. Just keep running.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Just keep running. Just keep running.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Just keep running. Spank!

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And then we do it all over again.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Okay.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Let's go. This is so much faster

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
than the second phase.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But that's okay!

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Okay.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just keep running.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Just keep running around.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
He'll come to me.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We did it. We're doing it. We're doing it.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
We're doing it. We're doing it.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Spank! Oh, we did it!

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
What did we get?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
What is this?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Boo! Tomato! Tomato!

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Boo!

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Beat him while he's down! Beat him while he's down!

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Argh!

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Take this.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Okay. What is this?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Supercharged body slam

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
for a more professional belly flop.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Press A and B

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
to the top of the jump.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Please! I love this so much!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, that's so good.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I love it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Momay domination.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Dang straight.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Dang straight!

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Well done, children.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
By defeating Tiny,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
you have unlocked the gate to the next time travel area.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Go back to the center of this time, Trister,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
and save your progress if you wish.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
From there, you will see

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
that the gate to the second time travel area

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
is now open.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Okay. Thank you.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Okay.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Okay, so I've unlocked everything in this one.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
In the castle segment.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
How do I save the game?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Left trigger, save.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Uh, sure.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh, auto-save is already active.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
That's fine.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah, just save that though.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, okay.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Just in case.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
What is this?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
So we've got Arabia,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
China,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Egypt,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
the future,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
South Korea then,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
for the future.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Are you squidding me right now?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Tiny, Spiny!

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I would just like to formally say that I,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Tiny, Spiny, am not associated with

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Tiny, Tiny in any way,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and do not endorse his actions.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
No.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Way to go with the game so far.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It's going so good.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I love it.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It means you get access to the moots.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm going to very quickly grab a can of cola.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I'll be literally in those seconds

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
because I couldn't finish my tea,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
so I'll just get cola.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Surely we can't be no weak to me at all.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Sure.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
My question,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
briefly,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
is surely not all commissions are that short

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
because there's only five locations.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
And if there's only five locations,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I don't...

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I think they were going to be finished with Game in two hours

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
and redirect him into Sheevie

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
because there's no way.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Thank you for the gifted membership

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
for Jinger, and thank you for

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
the tip, Tiny, Spiny,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
if.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
They're short, but you'll die a lot.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
What happens if I get zero lives?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Like, I genuinely lose?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
This is called

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
G-Wiz

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and...

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It deletes your save file?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Am I being trolled right now?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Or did I genuinely lose all progress?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Because this is an old game

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and that's exactly what old games did.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
They make you lose your...

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Whoa.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Go back to the farm!

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Go back to the farm!

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Back to the farm!

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Back to the farm!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Oh!

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Barely float!

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Ah!

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Okay.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Oh!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Ah!

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
The way I absolutely

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
decimated that poor man.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It's not that old.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
You just lose your score and start from your latest level.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Oh!

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
A game over. The player is given the option to either restart the game

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
from the beginning of the level.

42:47.000 --> 42:54.680
kind of with the standard number of lives for or to quit to the title screen okay so I don't lose

42:54.680 --> 43:01.080
all my progress that's good because if I lost all my progress we're actually going to play a game

43:01.080 --> 43:08.280

ending where you win this crash bandicoot the game was like that but I've

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:33.000
vomit up there was this enemy Dr. Entropy isn't Entropy when you're

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:43.040
like skinny I'm I think it's not in our way too stupid to understand what you're

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:48.600
getting yourself into this time you've done it

01:44:51.600 --> 01:45:03.040

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:10.360
does that mean what does that mean what does it mean I don't know

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.920

spoke far too soon I admit it I confess to my sin right let's try that again

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:21.000
okay let's try that again I never made it this far into the game as a child I

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:31.920

wow I love that move first try yeah yeah first try first try first try

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:56.920
you must realize that this time twister machine is very delicate without Dr.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:01.560
entropy's constant care and control and she's trying to what it will do and she's

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:08.760
trying to guilt truck was into losing who knows what it'll do oh no right we're

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:38.620
are they by like the same developers or was it just they happened to come out

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:48.540
kind of closely the same time, right what did I do wrong here again, I had nothing to protect me,

01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:55.100
I'm wondering if I have more time if I do that, oh wow I do, right,

01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:03.420
and let me guess that doesn't explode the T, oh no it does, I was gonna be like oh let me guess it

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:17.420
doesn't do anything, again, oh no, oh we're struggling with this one,

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:27.420
goodness gravy, am I making this look easy, no sorry am I making this look hard,

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:36.300
right and then wait for it to come back and then jump on it and then defeat the mummy twice

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:48.780
or the sarcophagi, jeez, let's try this again, right and then I can just double jump here

01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:54.700
because I'm out of range and then he's gonna drop that which explodes that one first just fine with

01:51:54.700 --> 01:52:06.060
me, right don't send it, don't send it reflings, if you ever replay this game don't send it at

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:11.020
that section because that's what I thought I had to do there and it did not pay off, I need to wait

01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:17.820
until he spawns the second blow, we'll get there it just takes me a few moments, can't believe it

01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:25.740
they made me flat, the lollipop model confirmed first Ronnie, right again just jump over this

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:31.260
which is fine, oh there's not even TNT this time the game said yeah you're struggling, right send it

01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.780
send it send it send it right and you would work if I sent it, oh I've got a checkpoint goodness

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:45.420
that'll be very welcomed I assure you, there's really enemies behind this, yeah there's freaking

01:52:45.420 --> 01:53:05.980
TNT, oh take your time, take your time, there will be a mummy, okay we're good, we're good, we're

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:14.860
doing it, we're doing it, we are doing it, oh why would they randomly have a natural there

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:24.220
oh oh send it send it send it send it, I like how he just looks at me as if I'm not about to

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:41.820
kablamo him, uh this seems suspiciously easy, rather this is suspiciously, oh wait hold on, oh

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:51.100
crystal let's go on the bonus map, don't send it no idea I'm literally giving you the strats live

01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:59.580
because uh I'm struggling, okay there's lots of TNT, I'll just let it pop and then run away again

01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:10.380
what oh there's too many oh dear

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.580
there's lots of freaking

01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:28.700
oh well that's the best I can do, the best I can do is what I've got,

01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:39.980
cuckoos don't look at the explosion because she's so cool, I start off a guy, oh I'm just a

01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:50.780
bit rude of me but uh I did the job, oh there's like monkeys in these pots, sling your shit elsewhere

01:54:50.780 --> 01:55:04.700
oh my god he's quaking, his little ankles are gone, he's quaking in his boots

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:23.580
oh I've got another life, thank you, okay, perish, perish, yeah yeah yeah, start quaking more, boom

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.620
I don't know what that does, I think you're supposed to like go back when you do that but

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:35.740
I don't go back, there's a message in the discord, I need to be worried

01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:53.500

uh oh my god, yeah, oh well okay we did it, we did the ramp, I was like oh I missed the

01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:05.980
timing on the ramp, we still did it, oh right we're safe, we're safe, man this freaking game is

01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:14.620
just like so unapologetically good, like yeah suck at the racing ones but that's fine, sorry Mr. Seagull

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:27.100

freaking seagull, um this game is like so unapologetically good, like it's such a chaotic

01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:41.340
fun experience, it's so good, I didn't know the seagulls could hurt me like that,

01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:49.180
I mean is he even there, he's not even here this time, so he didn't really care that much about the boxes,

01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:50.060

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:22.220

01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:31.900
way, you're a cuttlefish after all, I'll, I'll cuttle your fish in a minute if you don't, I don't know,

01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:39.420
please leave me alone Mr. Shark, I think I'll just do this checkpoint, yeah let's do the checkpoint

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:44.460
because I don't trust this, this is, they're starting to really fill it out with enemies though,

01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:50.380
it was like bear the first time you played this map, the bombs were moving, there's like enemies

01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:58.460
everywhere, I mean I know games are supposed to, please leave me alone Mr. Seagull,

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:06.700
nope, nope, that bomb is teasing, that bomb is teasing and teasing me,

02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:17.420
but this is like a perfect remaster, oh there it is,

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:24.060
that's what we need, oh I don't want to do, I don't have a checkpoint, I don't have a checkpoint,

02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:05.420
okay just jump over again, okay we're learning, we're learning, we're observing, we're using

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:13.260
our brain mass against her wills, hold on I can double jump over this, oh okay

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:19.260
and then we'll butt bounce that, no we won't, we'll double jump over this, oh I almost messed

02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:25.500
it up, oh my god that was the first checkpoint was like so long into this, um on the flyer and

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:31.660
saucer you guys I hate them too, people are waiting for a review with me at a stream to be

02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:38.460
announced and I agree, I would want some sort of remaster or get the same dev team in because

02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:50.140
we were so precious, go away, oh sugar, let's try that again, go away, wow what, yeah that's

02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:57.980
exactly what I thought was gonna happen Coco and I was forced to do that stinky game, that guy's red

02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:08.380
and go green, I think, go away, oh

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:20.860
oh I'm to fly, oh right, oh sorry I thought that was gonna explode, wait we'll do the bonus level

02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:27.500
I thought that was gonna explode the moment I came near it, okay we're safe, oh no the game's

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:33.820
telling me to like double triple quadruple jumps and stuff, wait well double jump and then

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.980
okay we're fine, we're fine, kendo

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:51.500
okay and we got an extra life, double jump, right we're not doing bonus levels anymore

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:56.780
if there's a chance that I can perish in them, I will not stand for such slander, thank you

02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.420
Vajingo for the five gifted members, shit, and congrats to those who caught it, enjoy the emotes

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.900
I have four 10 emotes up for it, wait

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.380
I'll just cross, I have um

02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:17.820
10 emotes, the girls are getting their batch of 10 before me because the emotes artist

02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:23.500
is gonna take a month to do them and I'm crying internally when she told me that because

02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:29.420
ouch why a month, it hurts, and they increased the price as well, it sucks even more

02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:35.020
because I like when emotes all look the same, like where it's clearly, what the heck am I supposed to do

02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:39.020
oh wait was that on note to spam eh?

02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:44.140
um

02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:46.940

02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:49.420
oh man

02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:53.020
you don't lose lives in bonus levels though, eh

02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:03.020
what am I supposed to do, yeah that's exactly what I just tried to do but it didn't like it, oh sorry I'm like

02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:05.580
hanging all these away, so go up and then

02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:13.100
Coco, Coco, Coco Chanel, I'm gonna start, I need a word with your manager because what's going on here Coco

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:17.180
I'm double jump and then xxx and then that's exactly what, oh

02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:22.380

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:30.380
right we're not gonna double jump, oh Coco, Coco

02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:37.980
Coco Chanel number five is the top leading women's perfume in sales

02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:40.940
just the fun fact

02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.100
I think it is anyway, right go away

02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:52.620
double jump, I don't know why this is getting so hard, right

02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:03.580
right so you do it that way, so go and do it that way then, Coco, oh my god why are you not doing it that way

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:13.980
why are you not doing it that way, why are you not doing it that way, you did it the other way, so why won't you do it that way

02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:28.700
right double jump, oh sorry I'm like throwing all these apples away, right not apples

02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:35.340
so fly and then x, no right that didn't work, so fly up and then, no why

02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:40.540
sorry I need to practice doing it this way but it's actually not doing it that way

02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:44.460

02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:54.380

02:12:54.380 --> 02:13:04.140
I just do wow is it this I just unlocked I think I probably just did that yeah ain't no way I'm

02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:11.340

02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:32.860
100% it and like go back and do everything um

02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:40.220
but yeah I think we're probably gonna be redirecting to any of this right if I'm blasting through the

02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:47.180
game like this it honestly would do me quite well because I need to go upload the girls ASMR

oh my god I didn't really had a rocket launcher and crash bandicoot I definitely did not get this

02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:22.940
far into the game as a child as a wean as a speckle honestly I was probably a molecule

02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:29.820
when I was playing this I'm just a bastard bandicoot with a rocket launcher I thought of that mean

02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:36.300
but there is like nah there's no way I can bring it up I'll have to let everyone bring it up because

02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:43.500

02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:27.660
but because I'm dumb and couldn't figure out

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:40.460
thank you for coming on member and lord of strums again for the gifted membership me and the reeflings

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.220
just as I was complaining about a race in the mission

02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:53.180
it's the last one though

02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:00.060
it's the last race in mission surely

02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:07.660
surely two and then go right I got the boost

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:18.060
the police are doing nothing other oh I never even saw that oh my god I need my glasses on so badly

02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:22.620
we'd just still love me as a streamer if I never put my

02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:34.860
I'm trying to hold it together I'm trying to hold it together I'm at the absurdity that is these maps

02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:39.420
for racing I'm literally seventh place there's no way

02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:47.660
I there's no way I've got this I refuse yeah get in my way Yabu

02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:55.900
okay everyone's using the ramp which is fine I'll use it too okay you're gonna have to use

02:24:55.900 --> 02:25:05.020
the ramp because of the bro these AI police cars bro you can't even reverse in this game

02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:12.460
the reeflings I'm gonna have to send my game file to one of you right now

02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:16.860
and then you send me it back complete and I'll do the other missions while I'm at it

02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:23.980
because this is ridiculous uh why did they make the freaking driving one so hard

02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:31.740
and crash if you didn't stop skating everywhere across the map we're actually gonna have issues

02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:38.220
out my road okay well that was terrible please don't ever do that again

02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:42.220
I'm fifth place oh and I missed it

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:48.620
okay the AI can actually go off road which is interesting I didn't know that

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:57.420
the AI is adapting and I'm getting nervous why are they oh and I missed it again

02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:05.100
I'm fourth place honestly that wasn't awful I'm wondering right we'll keep doing it we'll

02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:08.620
keep doing it we'll keep doing it that was the first time I played the map and the first thing

02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:16.540
I did was fall off okay reeflings are always thrilled to princess carry me honestly I just wish

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:24.940
I just I just I'm getting filtered by a child game three two and then hold boost okay and then

02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:32.700
on the left side there is already an issue so the AI is actually choosing to go off the map

02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:38.140
which is curious I didn't think the AI did such a thing

02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:45.180
very curious indeed yeah they're all avoid in the polis

02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:53.420
so just take it easy these corners didn't do so yeah I didn't do so hot in these corners

02:26:54.060 --> 02:27:01.180
wow I'll take that boost though I'll take that boost thank you

02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:06.620
I have to take this ramp because there is a gap you will not make it

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:15.340
go minasori you will not make it if you take that gap it's okay no fender bender fender bender

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:22.380
that's illegal you have to stop and call the police oh fuck this

02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:32.620
okay hold on can you fender bender elsewhere please elsewhere okay

02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:39.900
okay

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:50.540
I'm trying reeflings I'm actually trying so hard right now I'm sweating my my cheeks off

02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:54.860
I say I'm sweating my panties off but you all know what's happening with that oh I might do it

02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:59.180
oh my god I might do it oh my god just don't just don't

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:08.860
my mouth is the gate from how hard I'm trying right now

02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:18.380
oh oh my god I did it in two oh thank god thank god oh my god that was so freaking hard

02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:26.540
literally maximum mouth breathing all all wrinkly parts of my brain were locked in

02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:34.300
all the smooth parts of my brain were told to be quiet momentarily oh my goodness gravy thank god

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:47.180
I never have to do a racing mission again victory victory oh lol oh such a good game

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:53.500

got some money to spare right now and you want to give a gamers hey I was on top of your heat

02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:07.820
um I heavily recommend getting the v-master crash band to cook because this is just fun

02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:12.620
I have to wait until the nice man goes away and then I don't come back

02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:22.700

that camera angle but now I'm like I get it now this is actually pretty pretty nice this is pretty

02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:51.260
rewarding

03:09:02.780 --> 03:09:09.740
how like the economy is rigged against them especially because like um they may or may not

glad i could mind break you though i've not even done that part of the hypnosis yet

03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:14.060
i mean we ain't even done the tear list yet where i explain in detail every scenario i want to do to you

03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:15.020
because of that tag

03:10:19.020 --> 03:10:19.980
hydration check

03:10:24.460 --> 03:10:27.820
strongy you make me fragile when you talk like that that's why i do it

03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:36.940
they're gonna be a little me mark and be all happy and stuff but i do like the juxtaposition

03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:43.340
as well as many other positions hold on a minute thank you

03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:49.260
here all week dear mommy oh i did beat that one

03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:07.260
oh wow someone's analizing my ovulation cycle so a normal ovulation cycle lasts about 24 hours

03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:12.860
each month this is correct once an egg is released from an ovary it will dissolve within 12 to 24 hours

03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:17.980
if it's not fertilized and the window is about a week before ovulation since it survives for

03:11:17.980 --> 03:11:25.580
almost a week so basically if i was trying to fertilize you i would need to do it the day before

03:11:25.580 --> 03:11:32.540
for optimum success chance which means the 13th of the month i'll refling you went gen 2 already

03:11:33.420 --> 03:11:37.580
you missed your window of opportunity you're gonna have to try again next month with me huh

03:11:38.380 --> 03:11:41.820
and we'll just keep trying and trying and trying

03:11:46.140 --> 03:11:50.220

03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:21.740
attempt scripts it's not that it's not like saying honestly the behind the scenes is rather boring

03:13:24.220 --> 03:13:32.460

that's so terrible i hope no other beach ever comes in stream and sees that oh my god that's

03:19:14.220 --> 03:19:21.340
terrible why are we like this together we bring out the worst side in each other like the the

03:19:21.340 --> 03:19:32.780
degenerate side in each other honestly um are you gonna take the but it's a little test again

03:19:32.780 --> 03:19:41.900
yeah i'll take it um we can 100% do that stuff i have no problem with that stuff

03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:48.380
whereas you mean best he speaks the truth and they hated him for he spoke the truth i can't

03:19:48.380 --> 03:19:55.660
i'm not gonna add it into that jesus meme uh hi stroney i want you to bite me all over and leave

03:19:55.660 --> 03:20:01.900

03:20:03.340 --> 03:20:09.500

at you now chat what are you gonna do about it huh what are you gonna do sorry i'm burping away over

03:20:14.380 --> 03:20:21.900
here we're a match made in something probably not heaven because we can't make it into heaven

03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:28.860
with this stuff that we go on about we can't make it into heaven oh no stare back

03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:40.060
i feel like i could uh i'm terrible at blinking contests i remember everyone in the playground

03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:46.860
was like oh i do do stare contest and i would always lose because i suck i'm already in heaven

03:20:46.860 --> 03:20:54.300
no need to go elsewhere will the member streams be archived i may not be able to tune in i'm not

03:20:54.300 --> 03:21:04.460
gonna try and get them banned no i think we'll be okay we're gonna use our euphemisms where i go

03:21:04.460 --> 03:21:16.380
tentacle and ink and i want to ink on the tentacle because we're cuttlefish out here we're cephalopods

03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:22.940
but together we're a cephalopog because we're so cool like that yeah pogger

03:21:25.020 --> 03:21:33.020
um have i ever heard about the gates by asa rock i'm so sorry i've never heard of that in my

03:21:33.020 --> 03:21:40.700
life we're all stuck in perigatory keep that in mind because there may or may not be a collab

03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:46.140
with a va and all villa members that is related to purgatory so keep that in mind

03:21:48.220 --> 03:21:56.140
funny you brought a funny you brought that up yeah um imagine pieta but it's the virgin marie

03:21:56.140 --> 03:22:01.500
given jesus whoa we we can't be saying that stuff out loud those are inside thoughts

03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:07.900
so oh sounds interesting yeah you better be excited

03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:17.900
i like when strony spoils i try my best i do i the dust is definitely settling on my list of

03:22:17.900 --> 03:22:26.940
stuff to do like a lot of things are becoming a lot easier um and it's getting to the point where i

03:22:26.940 --> 03:22:37.180
can fully be strummer yes i can be strummer um i i wouldn't mind having a clip manager but sadly um

03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:49.340
i don't have anyone um i trust to be in that position um because clip manager needs access

03:22:49.340 --> 03:22:53.900
to the girls accounts to see what people have been clipping and it ain't gonna happen so

03:22:54.620 --> 03:22:59.580
unfortunately i am still clip manager at this point in time but it's not too bad because literally

03:22:59.580 --> 03:23:03.500
i just take a clip and then i send it to editor then editor comes back and then i upload it on

03:23:03.500 --> 03:23:12.300
girls channel and it's all hunky dory stop problem strummer i like when strony you didn't finish your

03:23:12.300 --> 03:23:22.300
sentence mommy protecting her doors yes um i will be your shield i know not a lot you play

03:23:22.300 --> 03:23:28.620
Overwatch i used to play it quite a lot sadly i fell out of love with it um when Overwatch 2 came

03:23:28.620 --> 03:23:40.620
out but uh there is a girl called Brigitte Lentol and her slogan is i will be your shield and yes

03:23:40.620 --> 03:23:49.740
i am Brigitte for my gen mates because i don't want anything happening to them um so i'm the i

03:23:49.740 --> 03:23:58.300
am both the owl and the shield i love when strony does anything yes uh tomorrow's stream

03:23:58.300 --> 03:24:07.500
i'm gonna see if i can get my heart rate monitor working um so i should be able to do that and

03:24:07.500 --> 03:24:12.620
then you can see my heart rate during buckshot roulette i didn't manage to watch any more

03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:20.700
cultural content because i literally i finished stream i did i see an me's memberships and then

03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:27.180
then what would i do i don't know um and then i went on twitter i think i liked one thing and

03:24:27.180 --> 03:24:35.260
then passed out and then i woke up like 45 minutes before stream i probably needed a big

03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:39.500
sleep like that like it was coming it was coming that i needed a sleep like that

03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:46.700
strony that was the whole scene wait what was the scene that's the whole scene

03:24:48.140 --> 03:24:55.580
i also like when strony i do like when strony but why are clips private i don't know youtube

03:24:55.580 --> 03:25:03.820
doesn't let people see what people have clipped on uh livestream or any content really if it was

03:25:03.820 --> 03:25:10.460
public then i could get a clip master but i can't get a clip master because they're not public

03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:17.100
but hopefully youtube changes that in a couple of months because that would then negate me even

03:25:17.100 --> 03:25:25.180
needing to be a clip master um and then i can spend even more time we're briefly wait they're not

03:25:26.060 --> 03:25:32.780
do you remember sending marshmallows to the girls i remember completely crashing on yesterday's

03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:38.780
stream for anyone who wasn't watching the runescape stream i hit the 11 hour mark and became

03:25:39.340 --> 03:25:45.100
delirious i spilled all my chips on the floor when i ended stream and i just left them until

03:25:45.100 --> 03:25:54.780
this morning to clean up eat i was gone with the wind i i don't know what happened i ate food

03:25:54.780 --> 03:26:01.820
and i was like oh this will wake me up this will wake me up no it freaking didn't day one day we'll

03:26:01.820 --> 03:26:10.940
hit 12 hours for old school runescape honestly um no i didn't have any issues with it playing it but

03:26:10.940 --> 03:26:16.620
i like completely crashed the ending of the stream was so funny i just remember being like oh let me

03:26:16.620 --> 03:26:21.820
send the girl some marshmallows and then i started typing and i don't really remember what the contents

03:26:21.820 --> 03:26:30.860
of it were but hopefully all is good um but yeah i remember just drinking losing it basically

03:26:31.580 --> 03:26:36.940
i crashed way before that part of stream you used up all your energy trying to win connect for

03:26:36.940 --> 03:26:42.460
unironically oh my god you if you didn't see runescape stream quick recap in runescape you

03:26:42.460 --> 03:26:52.460
can play connect for i was getting decimated like the reeflings were like ganging up on me just

03:26:52.460 --> 03:26:59.260
fucking one at a time one after the other like bro i just accepted my fate i could not win at connect

03:26:59.980 --> 03:27:07.420
one i won one because i tried so hard and burnt my brain the second one i won by accident because

03:27:07.420 --> 03:27:14.940
a reefling couldn't see what i was doing um i was gonna absolutely destroy yeah i remember my

03:27:14.940 --> 03:27:23.100
sleep fading and then some strange noises coming up um sounds like a fun time bro i was perishing

03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:28.220
i don't know what happened because normally i can last 12 hours and i had an eight hour sleep

03:27:28.220 --> 03:27:34.300
before it but my brain oh my stomach just made a noise have you heard that my brain just perished

03:27:34.300 --> 03:27:40.380
like it had enough it was like i'm sorry i can't hold out anymore checkers oh no i'm not playing

03:27:40.380 --> 03:27:45.740
checkers again that was the most confusing thing i couldn't even bro we were playing checkers and i

03:27:45.740 --> 03:27:54.780
couldn't even move on the board because i didn't know what was like going on um with the dang thing

it was a redonkiller hold on i'm just gonna pin the marshmallow oh my god that's me

03:28:11.420 --> 03:28:19.100
length hold on a minute that's the that's what the reefling said wait a minute who are you

03:30:04.860 --> 03:30:10.060
said for the brother or die i think uh i played it for like 30 minutes and i was like oh this ain't

03:30:10.060 --> 03:30:16.780
for me um but there seems to be quite a lot of fans that are distraught at the reveal because

03:30:16.780 --> 03:30:22.860
they don't like it but i thought it was just uh i think why do we hate brazil no it's a meme

03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:29.020
where it's like oh come to brazil do a concert in brazil but brazil's really dangerous for foreigners

we don't actually hate brazil hi starney i agree with that one riff riefling when you rage i always

03:30:36.140 --> 03:30:43.180

03:34:42.620 --> 03:34:48.140
couldn't do the watch longs but uh methos tal seemed to be kind of already leaning on the

03:34:48.140 --> 03:34:54.940
alternative side which makes me quite comfortable with them as creators as for actual corporation

03:34:55.740 --> 03:35:03.100
tubers uh i'm just if the person's happy with me i'm happy with them i never want to encroach

03:38:32.860 --> 03:38:42.300
ensuing um i do ah what's that game um it's hard because there's not a lot of six-man games so i

03:38:42.300 --> 03:38:48.700
think it might have to be stuff like among us or lethal company i know residency for everyone

03:38:48.700 --> 03:38:53.580
plays it but the problem is there's six of us there were many i think there's a back rooms game

03:38:53.580 --> 03:39:01.740
that we can play together possibly um i do want to do monthly six-man collabs but after that um

03:39:01.740 --> 03:39:08.220
it will be like two on two collabs maybe three three collabs angry scottish drunk karaoke went

03:39:08.220 --> 03:39:19.740
soon i was gonna do a drunk karaoke um on um i don't know when i don't know when um but i was

03:39:19.740 --> 03:39:25.660
going to do it on a weekend so like you guys can you know work work hard and then get all the relief

03:39:25.660 --> 03:39:33.340
on the weekend and we get steamboats and all that when the talents are sourced jackbox would be great

03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:39.900
but just with only one pop so you don't have to stream discord yes i am open to doing that um shebe

03:39:40.540 --> 03:39:45.340
when we were first meeting for the first time i got the girls to play a game together and we

03:39:45.340 --> 03:39:49.820
played jackbox and we all got addicted and we're like stuck i was like because it was only supposed

03:39:49.820 --> 03:39:55.020
to be like a one hour icebreaker so the girls could get used to like each other because like from my

03:39:55.020 --> 03:39:59.820
pov i knew the girls like i had consumed their content i knew kind of about them who they are

03:39:59.900 --> 03:40:05.420
how they kind of are and all that jazz um and then we ended up playing for like two hours and i'm

03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:09.660
like oh i'm so sorry like i didn't mean to steal all the time but then like it went two hours and a

03:40:09.660 --> 03:40:16.300
half um in poor ac's tame zone i picked a really bad tame zone so she was so tired but she was

03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:23.580
having so much fun she didn't want to get off um which was so cute and cute and good which says

03:40:23.580 --> 03:40:30.540
cute if you put it dictionary oh we we're gonna possibly do a dictionary there's a new jackbox

03:40:30.540 --> 03:40:37.820
18 that's released um okay i was gonna say i'm not sure we can hmm but we had fun on jackbox

03:40:37.820 --> 03:40:44.620
it was so mean against ac though because english isn't her first language and one of the game modes

03:40:44.620 --> 03:40:50.540
was like asking all these really like hard questions like even english speakers can't get it i felt so

03:40:50.540 --> 03:40:57.820
bad for her and she kept like dying in the game i felt so bad um i see no one to get off that's

03:40:57.820 --> 03:41:04.780
definitely not true whoa did i say that's in it deep rock galactica has a more players mod

03:47:23.980 --> 03:47:27.500
you're gonna have to let me start digesting producing it first before i can answer these

03:47:27.500 --> 03:47:31.580
kind of questions um i'm staying away from the permanent stuff because it makes me a bit nervous

03:47:31.580 --> 03:47:37.980
doing any permanent effects stuff but i already have a public release audio that will undo any

03:47:37.980 --> 03:47:43.020
effects i may or may not do on you what did you ask me in particular reinforcement loop for triggers

03:47:43.820 --> 03:47:51.660

03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:15.580
bit of my heart into that i like that okay i'll enjoy how it came out um hi strawnee how do you

03:48:15.580 --> 03:48:27.100
feel about male figurines being used in bibbute videos yeah you can do that um but maybe maybe

03:48:27.100 --> 03:48:39.900
in the future you can use official veiler merch association figurines that's not something i

03:48:40.140 --> 03:48:46.460
need a fixation oh i got five at 10 i got seven i got nine at 10 i like the transparency though

03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:50.540
because you're just a normal person at the end of the day yeah actually can i say something

03:48:50.540 --> 03:48:57.420
that's really disrespectful and i mean no disrespect when i say it you know those vtuber's that have

03:48:57.420 --> 03:49:02.940
those donations where like items get thrown at the vtuber model when they get a donation and then the

03:49:02.940 --> 03:49:13.900
vtuber goes like the the every time i consume any of that i this is very disrespectful and i don't

03:49:13.900 --> 03:49:20.380
mean it this way it makes me cringe to think that they're in a room on their own with the iphone

03:49:20.380 --> 03:49:33.580
tracking them and going i'm so sorry i'm like actually so sorry for me for me it's a no but

03:49:33.580 --> 03:49:38.620
people find it entertaining which is really cute i like that people can get so entertained and so

03:49:39.420 --> 03:49:47.500
enveloped um that it's humorous so i do apologize to anyone that i made him uh i think yeah i've seen

03:49:47.580 --> 03:49:55.180
it too twitch integrated throwing system oh okay is that what it's called and yeah and here you are

03:49:55.180 --> 03:50:01.900
veiler figures that well adjusted people could be normal don't think about it harder it makes the

03:50:01.900 --> 03:50:08.140
cringe yeah i remember seeing a clip about it and i was like don't get me wrong i'm a cringe fest if

03:50:08.140 --> 03:50:14.780
you sit through one stream of mine but i remember seeing it and i was like oh that's rough that's

03:50:14.860 --> 03:50:21.740
rough even for me to digest but i mean absolutely no disrespect when i say that like whatever

03:50:21.740 --> 03:50:28.780
works for you works for you some people are balls to the wall in immersion and that's fantastic

03:50:28.780 --> 03:50:34.780
for me um i am absolutely in love that reeflings are in love with pilot in america it makes me

03:50:34.780 --> 03:50:42.380
incredibly comfortable um like streaming and acknowledging like oh i need to only go put my

03:50:42.380 --> 03:50:51.100
boots on uh instead of like being like i love you so much feeling like bro ain't no one here for that

03:50:51.100 --> 03:50:57.180
well some people might be here for that but me i'm not here for that you know um

03:51:00.220 --> 03:51:06.140
yeah it's basically just beautiful but i don't mind like the roleplay like if i had a 3d model or

03:51:06.140 --> 03:51:11.740
i'll be roleplaying at the wazoo so i'm probably gonna be hypocritical with that statement it's

03:51:11.740 --> 03:51:17.740
not even a statement it's just me blabbering any blabberers the heart eyes yeah i love that my

03:51:17.740 --> 03:51:23.660
heart eyes are so different like oh my god my squiddles where'd my squiddly pupils go give me my
