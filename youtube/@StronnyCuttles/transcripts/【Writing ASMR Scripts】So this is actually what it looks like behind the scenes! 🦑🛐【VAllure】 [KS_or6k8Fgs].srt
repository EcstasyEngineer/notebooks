1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
I don't know how to put me, I don't know if I should put myself in the middle or not.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
This link's awful!

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,360
I don't know how to do it though, right?

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,240
I honestly don't know how to do it but we're doing it, we're doing it, it's fine, we'll

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
get there.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Wow, hi momay, hi replays!

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, we thought you forgot us.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,760
No, you know for a fact, I take like two freaking minutes to get my coffee tea, I've got a hot

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,240
water bottle with me today, I don't know if you can hear me, give a good spank.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,240
I've got a hot water bottle on my tummy.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Hi!

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,740
Are you ready?

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,540
I was killed more than five minutes ago, I'm able to carry you again, let's go!

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,620
We aren't even going to play Elden Ring until like, I don't know, maybe August when we put

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,740
up Elden Ring again.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,740
But good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:16,860
Today I'm going to show you the secret to making money, a good old ASMR collab, okay?

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,860
So on today's agendination, okay, I am going to write one-on-one collabs with none other

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,060
than the members of Vehler and Dolj, and before you're like, when do these drop, relax,

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:36,100
I've not even finished writing the damn thing, okay, relax, I don't want to see, when is

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,220
it, when does it drop, one, Amy's away on holiday, right, relax, two, AC's voice is

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,740
fucked, three, Mary's trying to move out, fucking, five, wait, no, four, Azura, Azura's

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:57,420
trying to move out, five, she be, she be fucking on Elden Ring, okay, she's doing endurance.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,340
These girls ain't going to drop everything to get this shit done, it doesn't have to

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,020
be done right now, relax, I got ASMRs coming out of the wazoo, relax, okay, ooh, oh shit,

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:16,100
okay, I've already decided what mine and Amy's plot is, so I can just write out little,

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,100
well, I would actually be big sister, I'm also so big sister, because it's going on

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,740
my channel, so it's big sister and, like, the fancy and sign, nah, that's awful, and

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,340
little sister tingle you to sleep, that would be mine and Amy's plot, because if you didn't

30
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,620
know, if I had a lighter voice, it'd be fucking over for you lollipop lovers, your fucking

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
dick would explode, I'm doing a big sister and little sister club with Denpo, fuck,

32
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:55,380
fuck, right, okay, new plan, new plan, new plan, new plan, right, shit, I can't do a

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:05,340
lighter voice, do I, do I do two little sisters tingle you, fuck, what do I do, what do I

34
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:13,340
do, of course I fucking accidentally guessed what you're doing with someone else, shit,

35
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,380
who's the big sister, you're both wee, it's okay, it's step sister, so I can make it real

36
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,380
sisters for this one, aye, I knew it, yeah, I knew it, picture, right, that's amazing,

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:34,380
right, okay, we're doing, we're doing real big sister and real little sister, obviously

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,980
it makes no fucking sense, because one of us was randomly Scottish on the plot, but

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:47,980
hey ho, totally real for real for real, A.C., A.C. and Snowberries, thank you for joining

40
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,780
A.C. and Snowberries, I'm currently writing down the name of the plots that I'm forcing

41
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,580
the Vila members to create with me at a later date, right now, not right now, not right

42
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,980
now, that's what I'm trying to say, I've still pinned that I'm not live yet, but there's

43
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,460
a short on, Emmys rats, actually it was a really good short, girl friend and step sister,

44
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:21,820
of course, could we get away with that? I'm tempted, anonymous, hold on a minute, hold

45
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:31,100
on a minute, I'm kind of tempted, does the notification come up for that? That is kind

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:38,220
of genius, I feel like it's really taking the, I don't know, I'll put in brackets, I think

47
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,380
we're getting really fucking cruel, so I don't know how cheeky I'm feeling, step sister,

48
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:52,820
tingle, yum, I'll put in brackets that, okay, now for me and A.C., this is just an excuse

49
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,300
for me to get A.C. commissioned in a schoolgirl outfit, I'm sorry, I said what, I said Snowberries,

50
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,700
I don't give a fuck, okay, I wanted to do something like, it's an after school club,

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:12,420
and we're all three of us are forced into making this after school club, so we qualify

52
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,380
for the school not being mad at us for not doing an after school club, and then basically

53
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,580
we're like, well, well, it literally sounds park like, well, what are we doing there? What

54
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:32,300
are we doing there? And then it's just like, ooh, let's go through your phone, oh my god,

55
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:45,300
you freak of nature, wait, nature, you nasty boy, what is this? It's ASMR, oh my god, oh

56
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:57,420
my god, the shock, the horror, the lag deli, I'm basically a retinkler, right, so what's

57
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:06,860
that called? Is it Tussanderis? Tussanderis, wait, Tussanderis, find out, you like tingles,

58
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:14,620
so it's like alliteration, Tussanderis, detect, fuck, this has got a T in it, Tussanderis,

59
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,780
detect you, get tingles, it's a marker, wait, what's the T word that begins with detect,

60
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:34,500
to find out, to sleuth, wait, no, not the delay, I can't imagine AC as a Tussander, Tussanderis,

61
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,700
trace you, trace, trace you, get tingles, it's like, shut the fuck up, this is awful, Tussanderis

62
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,740
with an S, okay, that's all right, that's so scoff, right, okay, the next, I'll highlight

63
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,020
it in, I'll outline it in red so you guys can see what we're probably gonna work on,

64
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,620
thank you again anonymous for that tip, I've never even thanked ya, I was just like, thanks

65
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,420
anonymous for the idea, mine, as if you didn't just give me your worldly money, triangulate,

66
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:15,660
wait, Tussanderis, triangulate, stop, that's so funny, that you get tingles, that you get

67
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,740
tingles, okay, that's good, I'm taking that, right, mercy, should I pick mercy, oh sugar,

68
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,140
I'm in the way a little bit, hold on, I'm sorry chat, chat, can my hair go on you a little bit,

69
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,620
it was mercy to geese practice their honking ASMR, honestly, I uploaded a short that someone made,

70
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,340
that short that was made was someone's submission that they're good enough to edit, like shorts in

71
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,940
general, and management sent it on to me and I was like, wait, who edited that, because that's

72
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,620
not in the editing style of who got on board, and they were like, no, this is someone submitting

73
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,620
themselves to be an editor, and I'm like, wait, they did this for free, like, obviously we paid

74
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,100
them, but it's very rare to ever get an example of work, via an actual example of work on your

75
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,620
content, so yeah, smell the laughter, I'm already right, what are we doing with the yandere, are

76
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:14,380
we becoming yandere too, I really wish it wasn't offensive, but obviously both me and

77
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,180
mercy's lore eventually you perish in it, and it would be kind of funny to do like a you perish

78
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,060
in the end of it, Scottish, Scottish laughter, I don't have an accent when I'm Scottish laughing,

79
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:34,380
that doesn't make sense, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what the, no, that's not a thing,

80
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:44,540
you want to hear yandere lines with a Scottish accent, I thought you said that I was your yandere,

81
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,300
wait, how about what, like two yandere's confused on who the real, no, because then we're like

82
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,380
arguing with each other, that's not relaxing, both of us are like, listen up you slag,

83
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,380
this is how the facts are, see that guy right there, he belongs to me, I'm the yandere in this

84
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,860
situation, no, that's not going to put anyone to sleep, okay, let us tingle, no, it's not going

85
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:14,940
to put anyone to sleep, two girls make you comfy until the darkness, oh, okay, some of you have

86
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:24,060
your tastes, we're not quite there, ASMR Viking funeral, oh my god, oh wait, how about a sleep aid,

87
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:32,380
hear me out, a sleep aid, but it's yanderefied, okay, so yandere tied up, sleep aid, and I'll get

88
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:40,780
an artwork of you being tethered to me and mercy in bed, and like, it's like basement, like ambience,

89
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,020
ASMR, you can hear it's like breathing in your ear, and we're doing like some sleep talking, we're like,

90
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,740
oh you senpai, you're always ours, whatever, like that kind of thing, so like you can hear like

91
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,100
basement jingle, and then like the little furnace goes on in the corner, because that's where the

92
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,660
furnace thingy is kept in a house, I don't know, two yandere's take care of their pet human, that's

93
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,700
actually gonna most likely end up in more clicks, so let me just steal that too, yandere's, I've lost

94
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:19,340
it, two yandere's take care of the pet human, okay, and then sheepsters, this is not sheepsters,

95
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:31,500
this is azura, right, azura was going to be a sleep aid as well, but my problem is the artwork,

96
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,660
I wanted to get artwork where you are embraced by the both of us at a certain location,

97
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:49,260
two crazy cultists, for me and merchie, two mommies, yandere flashes, oh sorry,

98
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,540
sorry, I just made that word up, but there's not even, hold on, I'm gonna drink my tea,

99
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:00,780
because it's gonna get cold, if azura embraces us, she embraces you too technically, honestly,

100
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I get swallowed up alongside, I'd be like, hold on a minute, aren't I supposed to be doing the

101
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,900
freaking tingling, goddesses, fuck it, let's both be goddesses, I'll get myself drawn with

102
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:29,500
like body paint and that, goddesses, like sleep aid ASMR, sleep aid ASMR, oh no, thank you Oregon

103
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,220
for the vibe, wait do you guys actually want yandere's Scottish ASMR, like a solo, I'll do it,

104
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,300
what did you say, if I find out you're fucking cheating Senpai, I'll kick your fucking cunt in,

105
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:48,380
honestly, you want that, okay, okay, okay, I'll gie you, I'll gie you, let me kick, let me kick,

106
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,180
I would have to whisper it so fast though, I'll be like, I'm gonna fucking kick that cunt in,

107
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,460
I swear I'm going Senpai, you're supposed to only be for me, so where the fuck is

108
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm gonna go in your social media, I can see you following all these other

109
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,540
like, I would have to whisper it so fast, should I do that, like the fastest whisper, like yandere

110
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:15,180
Scottish ASMR, like a muster, mommy being mean to us, oh I'm not normally mean but, goddess is

111
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:25,740
pamper, goddess is pamper, they're servant to sleep ASMR, I don't know, okay, as long as it's a

112
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,940
work in progress, don't wait, who goes there, identify yourself, are you squiddin' me right now,

113
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:39,180
a goat goddess and a sea goddess, Brian, wow Brian, you said that so fast, I don't know why

114
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,380
my brain couldn't really keep up, thank you for your love for the five, how about that, I don't,

115
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:55,180
so lower wise that doesn't make any sense, because as there is your mohen, does your,

116
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:03,980
does every audio have to be whispers, no, but if I'm like straight up bit posting then I do,

117
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,620
I do like to say it's not ASMR, but if we are gonna slap ASMR, you can do soft spoken ASMR,

118
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:15,580
that's actually true, very true, Freya did fantastic soft spoken ASMR collab, that's coming out

119
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:27,660
soon TM, oh be friends, I got an eight hour sleep, because I hired a maid, so my location

120
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,340
is in a disarray and I don't want my dad to see it before he comes over, so I had to stay awake

121
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:41,020
for this lovely maid to come over and I was passing out in my little gamer chair, I was like

122
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,500
when you're finished please just come on through, I'm just doing some work,

123
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:54,620
and yeah she likes me, because she said you've clearly never hired a maid before,

124
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,140
I don't know, I don't know if I said this story from last time or not, I can't remember,

125
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,260
but basically are we talking asmongold room untidy, no, no, no food, no mold, none of this stuff,

126
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,900
just like it's a mess and I need help type stuff, a normal maid or a naughty maid, well considering

127
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,420
the host is clean, I'm gonna say a normal maid, she being strongly tried to lure you into the

128
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,180
respective domains, Wonderland or sorry, oh what would you pick, a nice warm hotel or a cold,

129
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:33,980
freezing cold cave, even I'm picking Wonderland, but where will the rats live, it's any who has

130
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,700
rats, are you saying for me to get a pet rat, I wish I could get a pet rat but they have very

131
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:49,020
limited lifespans and I can't handle it, I cannot handle it, you picking the cave because of hypnosis,

132
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,500
okay right sheepsters, right me and a rabbit, what would me and a rabbit do when we get together

133
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,380
is the question, hmm, wait I'm halfway finished with tea, what would me and she be do, hmm,

134
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:11,900
office worker, you want like an office worker meme, HR training ASMR, oh my god it will go like

135
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:20,860
completely meme route, HR, you have to be HR trained ASMR, question mark or is that two Mimi,

136
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,500
double domination is fun, goddess is reward and somnatic followers for their devotion to

137
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,780
sleep ASMR, oh this is good, when you collab with Mercy do the mickey mouse, no, it's because I can't

138
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:43,580
do Mercy's voice, don't do ironic jokeies, no do I run, don't, I run a jokeies one, two office ladies

139
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:49,660
and you do overtime, that sounds like an alternative plot line I'm gonna be honest, how do I make it

140
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,940
back to wholesome, the only way I can make that back to wholesome hold on

141
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,100
angel and devil on your shoulders, one whispers negative affirmations, the other whispers positive

142
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,460
affirmations, that is so mean, because then who's the bad guy, I can be your angel or your devil,

143
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,740
ASMR, I mean on shibi made like that because she mentioned the meme,

144
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,780
shibi a baddie, thank you so much Anonymous for the tip,

145
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,340
wait I just stole something what did I steal, it's so tiny what did I steal,

146
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,660
hold on let me let me make it big and let me make it readable, nope that was a highlight I

147
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,860
didn't mean to do that, hold on wait hold on, I'll show you this, two office ladies and you do

148
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,700
overtime, right now let's, if I was to expand on this one this is quite easy to do because it

149
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:53,020
would be the classic, oh my god you look so tired XD and then that's when you confess you have not

150
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:07,500
slipping at all and then we go oh no we must help for you at once, ASMR continues, listener falls

151
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:20,780
a sweep, no a sweep, all is good in the world, amen, that would be how that plot would go,

152
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:28,860
if we did too, I think HR trained, I think HR trained is more of a meme solo plot to be honest

153
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:41,180
that's not really although, decisions how I want them all, I can't get them, I want to eat the whole

154
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:53,660
cake, I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing, anyone listen to Borg or, oh it's been a many a year,

155
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,860
you can't keep doing overtime if you aren't well rested, okay okay yeah yeah because we're still

156
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,660
we're still office kind of things in here, okay okay this, I know it looks terrible, just relax,

157
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:12,540
relax, okay so we've got the ideas done about what we're gonna type okay so and then we just get

158
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,060
let's get to it, so basically break them up, break them up, give them a little room, give them a

159
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:25,020
little space, so this is what actually happens behind the scenes, so just pretend I am sending

160
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,380
Emmy a script okay, so this is what Emmy will see, first thing she will be greeted by is the title

161
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,020
of the plot so she understands what kind of thing is about to go down, now if you really want you

162
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,100
can also give a premise, I don't necessarily always write a premise but because the title's so

163
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,500
explanatory there's no need for it, this is the key part okay, this is the key part

164
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,260
and you're not ready for it, I write this in every collab script and it doesn't work

165
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,860
please, well we're not going to do it at this, oh maybe we should please

166
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:16,860
whisper through the whole script, now I know this might seem crazy to have this so big and so

167
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,060
center, I cannot tell you how many collab scripts I've sent away, what is this, are you explaining

168
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,740
your job, I am showing you how to make infinite money glitch on YouTube, you're welcome

169
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:38,940
so this always gets ignored without fail and it's fine, I'm used to it, so if I ever get a

170
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:50,140
script back and like I'm whispering but the other person isn't, it always happens, it's fine, I'm

171
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,780
used to it, I don't get mad or anything, I don't ask the girl to redo the lines either because it

172
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,820
takes a lot of time especially when really in this exchange the only exchange happening is like

173
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,500
hey can I put an ASMR on my YouTube channel so the exchange isn't that good of an exchange rate

174
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,260
okay, please whisper, well you want me to whisper right now or do you mean like I like begging them

175
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,940
so normally you are supposed to start off your own script by yourself to have the guest, the guest

176
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,140
person that is going to show up on your channel start is not wrong, it's not a negative if they

177
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:37,740
do, I mean heck the plot might evolve quite well if you were to but you want to give your collab

178
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:44,620
partner less work than what you do, that makes sense, you know if you're going for a straight 50-50

179
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:52,540
on words then sure go for it but you never really want to make them in the trouble, Dumbledore said

180
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,140
can't we, hi, did you put your name in a cup? okay so

181
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,500
okay I've almost finished my tea, there's a bubble in my tea, I must have put a bubble in it

182
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,260
Dr. Crush tries to give you migraine relief, Dr. Crush, get it, reindeer listener

183
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:25,020
what does that mean? ASMR is begging you to whisper in a collab ASMR please, please read the start

184
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,580
oh actually I should explain the difference between

185
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,020
me, it's strongy, here is the new collab script, the title is we kiss and make out for 10 minutes

186
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:43,260
straight, let me know what you think, anonymous, one you're wrong for that, two that's hilarious

187
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:53,260
that's terrible, that's terrible, no you cannot send a script away asking for 10 minutes of kissing

188
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:01,660
sounds okay and then call it ASMR, you'll get limited ads and it'll be suppressed like heck

189
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,940
although it'd be really funny to do like six girls kissing ASMR and then when you click on it I was

190
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,780
like careful you're not to jerk your pintas to death or something right strongy right what's the

191
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,300
plot real big sister and real little sister tingly asleep right what are we doing are we creeping

192
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:27,100
into your bedroom or do you give us a cheeky text saying you can't sleep or are we already in your

193
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,500
bedroom or do we need to make our way to your bedroom slurping raman ASMR feed the void what

194
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,500
it wants mother and the fire everyone please kiss throughout the whole script 10 minutes

195
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:50,620
okay we're gonna creep into the bedroom okay so i'm gonna remind emmy remember we have to be super

196
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,140
dooper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed right now but

197
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:06,060
however wait okay wait remember we have to be super super quiet oh actually here's an example so

198
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,340
this is just me regularly talking you can start an ASMR regularly talking but then you can also

199
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:17,020
do what's called soft spoken ASMR when you're the thumb in your voice is still present so you see

200
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,780
that uh that's what i call thumb from skyrim uh you can continue to do that with soft spoken so

201
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,260
i can get closer to you but you can still hear the uh and my voice this is soft spoken ASMR

202
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,380
that's how it'd be and then whispering ASMR when there is no thumb present in your voice at all

203
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:43,580
you hear the uh when i whisper what do you know there's absolutely no well i would have to retake

204
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,580
that line for example but as i whisper and there should be no thumb present i constantly have to

205
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:56,940
retake lines when i whisper because i have quite a voice so yeah little sister breaks down your

206
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,180
door remember we have to be super dooper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed right now

207
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:15,420
i don't want to i don't want to get caught because i'll i'll end up getting more chores just to

208
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:24,060
really set the whole our parents are asleep in bed plot okay i don't want to end up getting more

209
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,860
chores i don't want to get caught because i'll end up getting more chores uh as their fucking birds

210
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:38,380
are going wild um i want to get caught because i'll end up getting more chores does that make sense

211
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,460
wait hold on let me recalibrate remember we have to be super dooper quiet we're not

212
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,580
supposed to be at bed right now i don't want to get caught because is it because i've said

213
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:57,020
a slang term which is because i'll end up getting more chores you you always get a waste

214
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,020
is it scott free get it because i'm scottish oh shit is my soundboard not up hold on

215

shit my soundboard hold on pause right was it stream deck hold on hold on hold that thought

216
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,740

217
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,740
you always get a waste scott free get it because i'm scottish

218
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,140

220
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,580
of your making out sessions but you all you always get a waste scott free

221
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,740
i don't want to be like because i'm because i'm the parents favorite no that's not nice

222
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,860
let's not say that i mean um you're the only one laughing here

223
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:57,100
what do you mean that joke was terrible it's funny because scott is uh both a noun and a verb

224
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:06,060
yeah a verb is a doing word a noun is a naming word an adjective is a describing word there you go

225
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,180
a little bit of english for you that's how i remember you always get a waste scott free

226
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:19,580
it's because i know exactly what to say and what they want to hear

227
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,500
because emi's so emi's a wee smartical thing it's because i know exactly what to say and

228
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:34,220
what they want to hear you have to think past what they immediately want you to do

229
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:46,620
you realize that right dammit anyway let's not get caught up in that right now let's not get caught

293
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:35,500
was it ethically eth ethically you don't have to worry so much about me brother

294
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,660
brother fuck macho man rendy savage you're in here with me brother you don't stand a chance

295
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:50,220
against the tingles i like the way you think emmy's a little thief she's a mischievous little thing

296
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:57,740
okay big brother are you implying i i procured them through scrupulous unscrupulous means

297
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,460
should i do that should i make emmy's words like really articulate and then mine just like basic

298
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,620
slang are you mean where did i get i sourced them ethically okay wait hold on i just like

299
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,980
straight up yonk to sentence ah that's the only thing i hate about yonkin sentences is for some

300
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,220
reason it does not like it are you implying are you implying that i produced them through

301
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:27,340
unscrupulous means you don't have to worry so much about me brother laughter see so i can't

302
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,980
replicate a laugh for any of the girls so when i give them like a bracket like that they must

303
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,460
follow it or it gets completely taken out of the script um obviously i can't go like i don't

304
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:45,820
know where the fuck emmy laughs like i think she goes i think she's a bit like that ethically

305
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:51,660
sourcents unethically someone cringe greedy streamer versus giga chad buy yourself food mummy

306
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:01,180
i acquired them from a generous patron yes the fact she is even little makes it hilarious

307
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,940
she's a wrestling fan please do ASMR like that snapping into a slim gym it's macho man randy

308
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,780
savage that my voice would be gone within a millisecond but you don't have to worry so much

309
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:23,980
about me brother okay so the good thing about this kind of ASMR is it really doesn't have to be that

310
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,660
long at all hold on let's get that let's get that word count in so we've got 83 words do you know what

311
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:38,860
that means it means almost two minutes of dialogue i'll teach you a little trick so 100 words normally

312
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:46,140
equals one minute of dialogue but there's an exception to this rule which is whispering

313
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:53,340
whispering extends dialogue dramatically it it completely flips it on its head because when

314
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,780
you whisper duggle remember we have to be super duper quiet we're not supposed to be out of bed

315
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,940
right now i don't want to be no that's not relaxing strongy hold on that's not relaxing so i have to

316
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:15,020
go remember let's be super duper quiet okay we're not supposed to be out of bed right now which is

317
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,580
a lot faster than going remember we've got to be super duper quiet we're not supposed to be out of

318
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:26,380
bed right now okay so whispering is always an exception to the the unwritten rule that normally

319
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,780
a hundred words equals a minute whispering extends yes completely it means you need to add more big

320
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:41,740
brother findom appreciators and shambles thankfully i don't care for findom yeah i'm not i need to yeah

321
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:50,780
yeah remember remember the 5th of november we're gonna blow up parliament uh i was out of context

322
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:58,620
for the 5th of november um that is a memorial date where guy fox's plot failed uh some nations

323
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:05,980
celebrate the failure other nations scorned uh like to celebrate the attempt um but you know

324
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:12,060
that is just how easy it is what it is strongy's plot this girlfriend begs you for five dollars so

325
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,940
she can gamble on on voucher room honestly felt that right we're not doing i see i see you pop down

326
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,700
there we're not doing you right now okay right whispering what do you mean where did i get them

327
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,940
from are you implying i produced them through unscrupulous means you don't have to worry about

328
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:35,100
me so you don't have to worry so much about me big brother laughter you know you know i can take care

329
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:46,460
myself you view no i see who emi's like emi's this but i see who you know ten out of ten

330
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,780
impression we were robbed of the good ending guy fox mentioned live on stream emi yanked them

331
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,100
from her pay piggies in school oh my god do you think emi would do that emi would have like some

332
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,460

338
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:58,940
stronzo emi's i was actually gonna write emi's um so now that we've kind of set up the plot

339
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,460
so again i'll just kind of quickly go over it so this is what emi's gonna see when i send her

340
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,860
she's not gonna see all of this like notes this is like this is a different document i'll send her

341
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,980
a different google doc link so she's gonna see the title she's gonna see please whisper please i'm on

342
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:21,820
minis um so we're in we're talking in the middle of the microphone here um i'll just put a little

343
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,620
middle i mean i think emi's pretty familiar with how i write scripts at this point in time i mean

344
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,700
they all are because they were forced to use my terrible scripts for a little while but thank

345
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,140
god they don't have to anymore um so the plot is we're outside your room um we noticed we don't

346
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,660
want to get caught because parents bad um but emi's got some tools and knows how to get it because

347
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,300
she's just so amazing she knows how to get out and then we go inside your room right now brian

348
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:59,580

00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:23,500
jet you've got some tastes okay now here's the fun part here's the fun part so we've set up the

352
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:29,420
plot we're in bed we're all gonna sleep together right so i'll actually i'm gonna ask emi for

353
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:37,660
five minutes of soft breathing five minutes of soft breathing in the ear ASMR please but don't

354
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:47,340
do like too much breathing that it becomes ear breathing ear blowing ASMR you know what i mean

355
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,300
emi oh i just realized you can't hardly see that there you know what i mean emi there you can

356
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,500
kind of see there that ain't move over but i don't want to be like humping chat well hold on a minute

357
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:06,780
okay spoke a little bit too soon um right so this is me asking emi for soft breathing because

358
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,700
at the end we're both gonna pass out okay um strong so you too i need five minutes soft

359
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,700
breathing but i know what i mean when i say that so it doesn't come you don't okay let's compromise

360
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:25,980
for six minutes of making out this is terrible right this is where the fun part comes in what

361
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:33,260
what do you what tingles do you want us to do to you hmm or do you want us to do tingles at the

362
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:40,220
same time so like i'll do like i don't know ear cupping and then emi's like i'll do finger fluttering

363
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:46,460
you want hair brushing how about hair brushing and hair play we can do like two at the same time

364
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,980
or do you want one ear difference like for example i can do ear tapping and then emi can do ear

365
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:59,340
blowing um and then i can do like i don't know scrunching something against your ear i mean there's

366
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,500
a few but if you want safer work how about sniffing brav sniffing is the market's limited ads any kind

367
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,180
of fucking breathing orientated shite is like getting absolutely hammered right now i think it

368
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:19,020
should be one at a time okay you want one at a time should we do should we do dual wheeled heartbeat

369
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:30,620
oh uh uh dual wheeled heartbeat somewhere though i don't know oh it'd be fun if you did hair

370
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,820
brushing and hair play at the same time warm breathing into our ears as if our ears were

371
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:43,100
cold and you had to warm them up like that is that what you want you want golem i'm joking i

372
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:50,380
know what you mean thank you anonymous okay um right i'll do warm breathing uh ear ASMR

373
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:59,340
i'll get emi's to do cold blowing which is it right i don't know if we'll finally stop talking at

374
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:09,340
this point hold on uh right let me just think uh right i never sleep better unless it's all three

375
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:15,740
of us together i want to be like you're such a souk emi but i don't think you guys say souk the

376
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:22,140
way we say souk if i say to emi you're such a souk it just means she really likes her big brother

377
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,940
which is my little brother in the plot because i'm the big sister yeah you're i don't think you

378
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,940
say souk in anywhere else but it basically just means that emi really likes brother

379
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,340
rare metro man randy savage a souk a sucker no em a souk means

380
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,500
it's like slang for you you just really like them i've never heard of the word souk right

381
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,180
let's take that out then because literally no one's gonna get it um you're such a i don't want to be

382
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,700
like the word doesn't suck up that's not the word it's that's a different word souk sounds different

383
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,940
here what do you think of some fabric sounds i don't mean in the naughty way but like a blanket

384
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,780
oh yeah yeah blanket rustling ASMR yeah i've got that um brocon would be better no no that's that's

385
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:13,580
not how it works both you and emi warm breathing first then both you and emi cold breathing after

386
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:24,060
i mean i can get that dude uh the only problem is it's gonna come be a bit of a headache for emi

387
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,180
if i'm asking her to do all these different sound effects

388
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,020
all right hold on what is an anonymous one uh thank you for the tip uh both you and emi want

389
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:40,060
warm breathing right okay fuck it we'll do warm breathing together take that out you you're such a

390
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,660
emi okay good sense you want to try again maybe i don't know have a have another shot okay first

391
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:58,380
we are going to warm your ears up cut because i can already tell you're freezing in here that's why

392
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:13,260
it's it's better we stick together because because because more strongy that's why it's better we

393
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:24,380
stick together because we can look after you after you and in turn your extra no that should

394
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:30,060
get rid of that yeah see this is like live correcting myself like oh that's a terrible

395
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,540
sentence get out of here clingy oh clingy yeah clingy it would work warm breathing is a put

396
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:44,940
okay so um so when you do your blowing ASMR it's like your your lips are pierced together and like

397
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,460
as if you were gonna whistle okay so it's like oh sorry sorry i didn't mean to whistle sorry um

398
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:57,580
it's like like that but if you want to warm someone's ears up i have to open my mouth and go

399
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:04,540
you know um so that's the difference between those two tingles and especially in the three

400
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,100
video is a very big difference you can you can hear the unwanted whistle whistle ASMR when

401
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:17,340
right fucking now oh my god i'm the wind i'm the i'm the cold wind rushing past your window right

402
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:25,020
now um okay first we're gonna warm up your ears because i'm going to tell you you're freezing

403
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,420
in here that's why it's better we stick together because we can look in after you so then both

404
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:37,180
me and emmer emmer oh no don't start that brain please don't me and emmy are gonna do

in the bed yes all three of us are together in bed and we're going to sleep and we're just

522
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:01,900
going to be a little bit of a sleep aid at the end i may add like rain the rain comes on and it's

523
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:08,140
just gently pitter pattering outside the window i love a good bit of rain and a smart plot but i

524
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,980
wouldn't do it during i would only be like oh the rain the rain just came on mm i was falling

525
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:19,260
asleep too but i didn't want to say anything what what exactly do you want me to say i love you too

family two whole family kisses like that part two on twitter right you're done you're done

528
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,220
you're getting rolled in smoke they could be killing him off because he's getting too hot

529
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:46,380
having both step sisters pressed against him i want to see you know step in this house

530
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:53,980

531
01:02:53,980 --> 01:03:00,220
around here not around these parts you want emmy to say i love you in timo's voice

532
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:11,100
i love you like this having both blood related sister he's also blood related

533
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:17,580
wouldn't you make the rain in the background make more sense for cooling down mid audio

534
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:25,100
i'll see i don't really i don't know when to shove the rain in

535
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,780
our family tree is a circle

536
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,700
it's a fucking roundabout at the rate it's heading

537
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,940
eh they're right what are we doing looping okay they're they're they are and i didn't

538
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,100
they are as implying their facial massagers they are and i didn't score them they just

539
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:59,660
belong to me now why not focus on how refreshing i don't know why refreshing they are on your face

540
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:06,860
and the looping around you instead of thinking about the little detail the

541
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:15,100
little details that don't matter that's probably why you can't sleep dummy

542
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:22,700
you oh my god please oh my god the english please you just need to tune the world out

543
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:33,820
and focus on both of us of both your sisters pampering you to sleep okay hold on what the

544
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:38,860
fuck was this word supposed to be okay i've got there in the end we got there in the end i love

545
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:45,020
hearing dummy in role plays yeah you're welcome this is probably why you can't sleep dummy

546
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:52,700
but i'm your girlfriend and she's your step sister and on the best part and

551
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:27,020
reminds me of a great german song called mine stab him is in christ i can't read german i'm sorry

552
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:34,940

because it's first thing in the morning oh yes we need help always pin pals and every band from

579
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:22,540
shoni's chat no you're not banned but like i'm trying to get through one script idea and it's like

580
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:33,580
let's make it for 10 minutes oh yeah testosterone's peak in the morning it's 3 p.m est is that still

581
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:40,300
technically morning put us to sleep we're getting killed no to sleep sleep like ASMR sleep oh my god

582
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:46,460
in some ways the pin pals are keeping hard by like a lot let's do the script step by step is that

583
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:55,740
fucking is that a step sister joke pretty sure we are trolling unless the pin pals are suffering

584
01:08:55,740 --> 01:09:01,260
from an MA deficiency no i know exactly what the pin pals and embers have been up to don't think i don't

585
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:09,580
know that both of you's made an agreement a two weeks i'd be two weeks two whole weeks on both parties

586
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:16,060
yeah i'm not surprised you guys are in here asking for kissing make out ASMR two weeks that's what you

587
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:28,460
get two two two sander's triangulate that you get tingles ASMR well well if we're going to make

588
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:36,940
this group work we have to convince them we actually hang out there's no all right remember this plot

589
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:42,220
is just an excuse for me to get ac in a drawn in a school uniform okay that's what i'm going

590
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:52,220
i said it i said it shoni why do you pronounce to sunday like that oh shit too san dairy oh is

591
01:09:52,220 --> 01:10:03,900
it not how you say to to sunday so yandere to sunday as it's not that it's like sunday oh no

592
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:17,180
to is is sin oh it's sunday wait no my alliteration it has to be with the tea the tea is silent no my

593
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:28,380
alliteration the tea is silent why with the tv silent to sunday's triangulate that you get tingles

594
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:38,860
my alliteration no sorry it's called to sunday's triangulate no wait you said this all your life

595
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:45,260
yeah i just thought it was tea it's called tea why don't you put a tea in it if the tea doesn't belong

596
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:54,620
there words are hard oh my god everyone billy to sunday it's not the tea is not silent yeah i thought

597
01:10:54,620 --> 01:11:03,740
it was to sunday alliteration no i love alliteration like this i mean at least title wise it looks good

598
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,540
right we're not gonna use this word in the script because i'm probably gonna end up forgetting it's

599
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:14,860
not said like with the tea god damn well if we're gonna make this group work we have to convince

600
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:24,300
them we actually hang out there's no uh wait i honestly think we can get away with it but

601
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:31,260
we're gonna have to learn some i don't know i don't know how to phrase this so the whole point

602
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:37,660
the whole premise of this plot plot is it's japanese you can't use the same rules as english

603
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:47,100
me i can't even speak english it doesn't it doesn't count let me be ignorant in my Scottish ways

604
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,620
a fucking poor emi whenever i've written a like something for her for some reason i always

605
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,260
spell stuff horrifically wrong thank god she can correct on the spot when she's reading a script

606
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:03,740
but i'll always like the biggest case is so she had to say the word kitty that begins with a p

607
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:12,460
and instead of a u instead of a u i put this so her sentence was like um my juicy

608
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:22,780
and i completely fucked up and i didn't catch it and thank god she could change it in time um

609
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,780
because some people read over my mistakes because they're like oh that's the way strongy wanted it

610
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,540
and then others are like no this is clearly wrong and we'll change it and i'm like thank god

611
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:41,740
too sundry on the other hand you can do a new alliteration soon no that no this title looks good

612
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:49,740
because it's got all the t's in it it's trouble in terrorist town oh it's a soon oh my god i just

613
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:59,340
leaked a collab idea with it indulge i've never actually played gary's mod but um sheebie has

614
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,900
and i really want to get into it because i think that stuff is hilarious moment what oh no don't

615
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:12,540
say don't mummy me it makes me nervous the title's good oh my god this is how i say it t sundery

616
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:20,620
all right to sundry that's exactly what i'm saying what are you talking about tct is the og

617
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:25,980
among us game is actually feels good i want to do that and i want to do prop hunt i've never done prop

618
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:33,020
hunt before um but it looks hilarious like i can just imagine me accidentally being a mattress or

619
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:37,740
something like being sideways on a wall and i can't figure out how to change and then they're

620
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,820
just coming in the room and i'm like uh it's not what it looks like and i'm like skedaddle

621
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:48,620
right well if we're gonna make this right so the whole plot is basically we need to form an after

622
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:56,700
school grip club so the so then we can be left alone to our own devices but then eventually

623
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:03,500
we find out you like asmr and then we do asmr on you whilst kind of bullying you so for those who

624
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:11,660
like a bit of bullying but not too far it's not like we don't like it's not like we like you or

625
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:21,100
anything like that kind of shite aye that's this kind of thing to to sundry's trouble you to tingletown

626
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:29,020
okay oh i always wanted to learn how va's make script oh it's it's an absolute nightmare um ignore

627
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:35,740
all of this so that this is oh shit i should lay out properly so this is what acy's gonna see

628
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:45,260
see she's gonna see this and then we're gonna do soft spoken in the middle of the mic please

629
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:51,500
because we're just gonna talk like normal at the start okay so this is what emmy's gonna see a

630
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:56,540
big old warning sign that goes i'll be squiddin me right now i swear god this is makeup such

631
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:04,060
sensational sense you asunder a sister seek to soften your sulk and soul oh no even brian

632
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:11,980

633
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:19,500
are you squiddin me right now such sensational sense you asunder a sister seek to soften your

634
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,380
sulk and soul no how does brian know it but i don't

635
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:39,340
how does brian know i'll give brian my tip fake weeb oh no i'm definitely the gamer

636
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,980
over a weeb i think someone asked that in marshmallow i'm so sorry a while ago someone

637
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:54,860
asked who's um brian studied as japanese honestly um someone asked who the biggest

638
01:15:54,860 --> 01:16:05,180
weeb is and who's the least weeb the ranking of weeb i think goes azura and then emmy and then

639
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:12,380
mersey then shebe then me however the gap between shebe and me is astronomical i have such little

640
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:18,300
anime under my belt i mean if you guys want to watch anime together i wouldn't mind um if if it's

641
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:23,980
a short like 12 episode only kind of anime we could probably just spoon it out in one day um

642
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:30,300
i wouldn't i wouldn't mind that i'd be down for that the gap between me and shebe from weeb to

643
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:37,180
gamer by is like massive like i am just by far a gamer i've consumed an astronomical amount of

644
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:44,220
benti um i used to be a puddin addict so that's kind of where my exposure really comes from um

645
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:52,780
i know that's gross but it's just the truth so it is what it is that's really my exposure

646
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:59,260
to the japanese weeb culture um i i mean i was like into i mean i'm still in a hatsunumiki like

647
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:07,660
what a vocal miki hatsunumiki um um and like vocaloid i'm in a vocaloid quite big um puddin

648
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:17,660
what's that a what addict yes yes um i used to actually um yeah i used to have quite the

649
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:23,340
collection and then my pc became corrupted hmm i wonder why anyway puddin is still around

650
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:28,140
i closed so then i gave it up but then it opened up again apparently but i don't want to start again

651
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:36,780
because i got very i used to get very like i used to be like right what's uploaded what's new today

652
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:42,220
right let's get today what's recommended this week like i use every day i used to be reading

653
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:48,940
one-shot dojins and all of those puddin read along stream when no seriously uh puddin

654
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:57,260
is a unique website i do not recommend typing in oh my god she's literally me oh i was daily i

655
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:06,860
was at it i was going fucking feral for um what is it called right so take emi's lore so that was

656
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:13,340
like the tag the main tag was emi's lore but then it had to be like oh what are those japanese

657
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:20,060
tables called where it has the tablecloth that goes over it um so like you're hidden underneath it

658
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:27,020
those plots i used to froth at the mouth if i used to get some of those oh i used to go

659
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:34,460
absolutely ape shit um i used to go fucking feral for that i just brainwrote on that shit

660
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,700
yeah the warm ones yeah yeah yeah i read the english dojins

661
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:45,020
um uh kotatsu yes not to be confused with

662
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:54,380
i don't know any any was that katsu katsu yeah chicken idea for a future stream watch out emi

663
01:18:54,380 --> 01:19:00,460
oh i'm not being funny but if the girls allow me when it comes to their donutons to commission

664
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:10,140
one-shot dojins i'm gonna go absolutely feral on that stuff emi plot the alabama or the kandu

665
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:17,740
where's the candy on emi

666
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,620
emi's albima

667
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,700
tonkatsu chicken

668
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:30,380
kotatsu warm table

669
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:36,060
um emi is both emi's candy wait am i being dumb

670
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:46,700
um oh lollipop got it no um i never particularly seek that out um i used to be really into

671
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:54,620
bottom i don't know why i really loved um i guess i just really enjoyed the height difference

672
01:19:54,620 --> 01:20:04,620
and all that jazz and like the motherly aspect um he means the lollipop yeah i figured it out

673
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:09,500
i got there in the end okay right we've written one sentence of this ace more collab that's

674
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,180
probably not i'm gonna well if we're gonna make this group work we have to convince

675
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:25,100
the teachers the teachers we actually hang out i hope i honestly think we can get away with it

676
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:33,980
but we're gonna have to learn a little bit about each other so we don't seem awkward or non

677
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:44,940
interactive with one another when we're in class or walking down the halls through i don't know

678
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:51,020
american schools always portray the hallways as like never fucking ending and like a lot of stuff

679
01:20:51,020 --> 01:21:02,940
occurs a lot of stuff non interactive non net on a non interactive i don't know i'm sure there's

680
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,700
better word i'll fix it later as i said when we write the stuff live i'll fix it later when i come

681
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:12,060
back to it which line is the start that ac lets you go through the phone

682
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,740
ac hasn't gone through the phone yet ac is gonna yank the phone you know her posable claws are

683
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:25,900
quite good for yonking shit it yeah classes can be really far apart literally all the time

684
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:31,020
like american shows like uh it takes 20 minutes to get to the next class and it's like what how

685
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:40,700
was that efficient for anyone at first they yank the main hall in my high school was 400 meters

686
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:46,700
long the fuck you mean non interactive non interactive oh wait isn't that going e that's

687
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:53,340
what i said non oh do you drop the e oh because an e before i unless something something i've

688
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:58,540
already forgotten the rule but anyway that's english for you it's cost efficient for companies to

689
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:01,180
build a school like that

690
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:09,100
yeah i have classes that were like five minutes between it really wasn't enough time

691
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:13,660
oh i bet you the teachers were like where were you then and it was like walking from one classroom

692
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:18,140
to another and they probably never expected it i like learned about hall passes as well we must

693

01:32:56,700 --> 01:33:08,140
normal well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not normal but i don't really

783
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:18,380
i well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not normal but i personally wouldn't go around

784
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:31,180
making it obvious i get tingles i don't i don't know i think bullies might pick on you if they

785
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:35,340
were to find out remember we are high school students so obviously we care about what the

786
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:40,860
bullies think oh the bullies someone please think of the bullies oh the bullies any bullies

787
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:49,020
where the bullies around these parts again these are drafts i am most likely gonna fix the absolute

788
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:53,340
crap out of them offline i can't i can't think of this stuff off the top of my head for too long

789
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:59,100
i'm boozy yeah you're the bully or you want to get bullied because i can make the girls say whatever

790
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:06,540
you want you don't really watch asmr so instead put you like listening to asmr

791
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,980
hmm wait so you're on your phone all day long you have this playing in your exchange

792
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:13,740
i would never have assumed you seem so normal well maybe liking asmr doesn't mean you're not

793
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:18,460
normal but i personally wouldn't go around making it obvious i get tingles i don't know i think bully

794
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,900
uh wait so am i is this

795
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:33,740
i think bullies might pick on you there so i guess you uh no more guessing what did you say

796
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:44,060
is that why you shivered randomly in class yesterday i picked up on it but i didn't want

797
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:56,540
to say anything because i thought i gave you a jump scare when i texted you this after school plan

798
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:09,900
in all honesty in all honesty um have you ever tried giving the 3d or what really i have um

799
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:16,140
i'm actually gonna upload all those videos on twitter when i get a second to breathe unfortunately

800
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:23,100
things still haven't quite settled down behind the scenes um we might need to hire a thumbnail maker

801
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:32,780
but i don't know i don't know how much like thumbnail makers cost or like not it's not like

802
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:38,540
draw a whole new thumbnail it's like no take these pngs of all the girls take the game they're playing

803
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:44,780
and then give us a thumbnail okay like i i think we might need to post that we need that at the

804
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:55,100
moment um and then it frees up a lot of um jobs behind the scenes no no make one of your thumbnails

805
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:01,740
mass producing thumbnails that's super easy to learn i don't even know if there's like a

806
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:07,980
going rate for it or like is it like you pair you pay per thumbnail i don't know that's a lot

807
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:19,420
if this character a zoomer why use jump scare oh wait what the term jump scare

808
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:29,740
i'm sorry i'm not following jump scare is a generational term am i being dumb pay them

809
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:36,860
and in me strongy makers that's terrible that would be hilarious agency exposed for paying

810
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:45,900
contractors via audios audios of a unique variation i picked up on it i didn't want to say

811
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:53,820
because i thought you gotta jump here and then this is where a a phone tapping ASMR

812
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:02,940
wait so if i do this it might make you shiver all right i'll have it we do it like that you

813
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:08,060
keep shivering and then we're as like spurs us on to do it more to you and like have a giggle with you

814
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:15,820
i think that'll do it if so we discover you shiver with ASMR because some people have like a

815
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:23,260
visceral reaction if you will and their body goes like and then it spurs us on to actually try hard

816
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:28,460
as well because it's so entertaining but then eventually we're like um okay this is getting

817
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:34,460
weird now we need to go home smile how about she reacts to the listener being nervous as he's gonna

818
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:39,980
unlock the phone with her taps no so we've just taken the phone off the listener and discovered

819
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:46,140
that they like ASMR so we're kind of discussing it a little bit without being too details with it

820
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:54,220
so if i do this it might make you shiver wait that's so cute is acl out to call you cute even

821
01:37:54,220 --> 01:38:02,540
though she's an adorable one get a kick from teasing huh yeah what are you going to do about it huh

822
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:05,260
you're gonna cry you're gonna ink

823
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:14,780
exactly you having a rake ago cute nose no boundaries barriers of course

824
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:20,300
it's roleplay let her let us have her call as cute yes okay phone tapping is that wait if i do this

825
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:27,820
it might make you shiver wait that's so cute i just realized i'm gonna have to get ac commissioned

826
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:34,220
with her big paws in this artwork it's gonna be it's just me being chilling in my outfit next to

827
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:39,900
her and she's got a big claws on can we get ac to whisper sucable yet in our ears honestly i'd be

828
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:46,300
down for that uh lollipop whisper sucable yet in your ears for half a half an hour ASMR when

829
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:55,980
the phone looking small in her paws exactly so this is how people script interesting well

830
01:38:55,980 --> 01:39:02,940
college was so strict whenever it scripts i'm in communication oh this is like please do not think

831
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:09,340
this is how actual people write scripts this is how my brain processes and slams stuff down

832
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:16,620
it is a it is a complete nightmare the only way my brain can like slam this down like when i send

833
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:22,300
this to emmy for example what i do is i highlight like her words as well so she knows what she needs

834
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:29,580
to see um etc like this is not professional in any way shape or form i'm just showing you how i do it

835
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:37,180
and you have to take everything i do with a pinch of salt because ac sph big paw humiliation

836
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:45,580
honestly that's so cute i want to write that um wait so if i do this it makes you shiver

837
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:50,940
wait that's so cute do it again and then so this is where ac is kind of figuring out wait

838
01:39:51,660 --> 01:40:04,380
wait wait you huh so it can't be done over and over again do i have to switch it up like how

839
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:18,620
they do in the videos no i'm not going to bully you over this i am genuinely curious i don't

840
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:31,980
i don't think hearing sounds would ever make my body jerk whoa make my body shiver the way

841
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:38,940
you just did there how about that you remember that weird ass song

842
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:47,820
you're a jerk you're a jerk jerk jerk are you squid me right now brian then suddenly out of nowhere

843
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:53,740
they started making all right yous are actually fucking done and on thank you for the tip for

844
01:40:53,740 --> 01:41:04,460
folk sick for folk sick no um this is totally how people write scripts it's just they go through

845
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:10,140
infinite revisions with co-writers and editors yes what you're seeing is basically what a draft

846
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:16,220
looks like but i will be honest there's some stuff doesn't really get changed that much but like for

847
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,660
example the emi collab i need to extend it dramatically but i also don't want to give

848
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:28,860
emi too many words to say because then it becomes like a nightmare to record you never like i i would

849
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:35,100
highly recommend never giving more than a thousand words that is becoming a very intense collab

850
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:40,940
now with the nature of emi at ic's collab with me because we're doing soft spoken we're actually

851
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:47,900
about to do whispering next which is even worse on the voice so give me all the words it's okay

852
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:54,540
oh shit emi's here for the challenge um but in general for a collab partner you do not want to

853
01:41:54,540 --> 01:42:01,020
overwhelm them like there's nothing worse than you know being like oh i'm so excited to do a collab

854
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:04,780
and then you turn around and give like over a thousand words and it's like what the fuck this

855
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:12,060
is gonna take me like so long to record and so long to edit to give you the correct lines um

856
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:19,020
yeah i usually write out the first like an outline first with the key phrases i want and then end up

857
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:26,140
yeah that's the way i do it i'm just intro middle ending shiplash yeah she's also really young so

858
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:31,900
many words are dangerous for her oh what did he say i've already written over one key words for

859
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:39,020
my collabs oh no well i mean my i always try and do them tiny but like as i said if you want

860
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:42,700
us to do like a collab with me and you and me obviously you can just give me whatever you need

861
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:51,580
because yeah that's not a problem but uh in general um i would say try and no i just i mean

862
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,300
then again emi's fucking collab like absolutely cooked i think it's approaching like 30 case

863
01:42:56,940 --> 01:43:03,100
viewers which is insane um which is absolutely doing fantastic so maybe i should shut my trap

864
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:09,180
and take a note out of emi's book huh huh you ever thought about that strawny huh huh do you have you

865
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:14,540
okay sometimes you think of a banger lane and then you write a script at the same time it's

866
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:20,540
fun to have parts in the skill play emi going hard it's fine you can take breaks from speaking

867
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:27,260
when yours are to make it okay you're all done you're all fucking done fighting the demons again

868
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:35,740
um i have a really i have given really long one sister only sister i'm sorry what

869
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:39,180
oh what did he say

870
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:50,140
shocking behavior honestly i love my hard-working daughter emi the hat that hat is in the merch shop

871
01:43:54,780 --> 01:44:00,060
the merch is we've got standees we've got keychains and we've got hoodies and trusers if you want

872
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:07,820
trusers don't don't be afraid to support the merch because it means we get more merch later smile

873
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:18,060
if the merch is supported now smile is there a preferred length to asmr um now so i've got a

874
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:24,380
collab coming out with uh right you know what dempo the dempo collabs already out me and dempo

875
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:30,620
only actually had about five minutes of speaking but the audio is 15 minutes extended because of

876
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:38,700
the plot i wrote whole merch whole merch it's coming okay i need to i need everyone's stats

877
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:47,500
to be up just a teeny tiny bit and then i'll contact uh the uh location i love dempo i rigged

878
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:55,020
shut the fuck up she told me she drew it and got it rigged you rigged her model

879
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:06,940
that's insane i did not know that lore no way i freaking yanked her tentacles she gave me her

880
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:12,140
tentacles for a collab it's really hard to see in the video but i have tentacles on my back

881
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:18,140
yeah me and dempo are a model birth and dream team oh my god that's so precious

882
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:25,980
he did fantastic yeah i like i went to dempo i was like is it okay if i can borrow your um

883
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:32,540
i can i borrow your tentacles for this um collab and she was like yeah here take

884
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:37,180
off and i was like she needs a looking good i'm very proud of those tentacles yes

885
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:42,940
wow oh my god it's like a family reunion in here god damn

886
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:49,260
yeah i know the collab with dempo was a hooten holler honestly um

887
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:55,580
etchy and dempo bret well when you put it like that she

888
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:03,820
right so we've done phone tap and let me highlight it just so we know i mean i think ac makes sense

889
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:09,820
to do like nail kind of related stuff like because you know she got big massive clothes

890
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:18,300
mommy needs tentacles uh wait until i get an alternative outfit okay i i think uh i'm definitely

891
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:25,500
gonna have tentacles coming from somewhere and it's not my tailbone but it's somewhere behind me

892
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,180
mm-hmm

893
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:35,660
oh maybe i should make the tentacles green like your legs riefling and imply that i have sat on

894
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:41,660
you oh okay we're developing that i said what said eldritch priestess nah

895
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:49,340
um nope nope around the back not the belly button i should have

896
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:55,580
um ultra killer reference when i don't know what ultra killers i'm so sorry forgive me

897
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:01,580
reeflings become your plug yeah i think i want to do something like that model wise

898
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:08,700
even if it's just a toggle because i wouldn't have the tentacles out all the time but i think

899
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:15,100
it would be very nice to have like your tentacles like wrapped around my legs and stuff and that

900
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:20,780
i think that would be really cool that's just my opinion anyway reeflings stuck in her ass

901
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:28,220
how did she sell it no no because i was gonna get that commissioned that would be so sick honestly

902
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:32,940
for example there are more or less around 200 tentacles right now

903
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:38,060
can never escape the spelunking allegations honestly right we should make a bit more progress

904
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:44,540
do i have to switch it up like uh how do they do in the videos oh actually i have terrible news for

905
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:51,340
any reefling that is currently waiting for the membership asmr stream i'm gonna have to cancel

906
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:57,820

907
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:02,060

914
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:51,980
talking stop talking okay uh well a sheepster's live right now i mean she i'm not even i'm not

915
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:58,860
even being funny we've not even finished like 50 of a script it's just it's just not undone

916
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:04,780
all the way down but to give you an idea of how you write a collab script like the mersey

917
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:10,060
two yandere's take care of their human pet i'm gonna turn it into a sleep aid because i think

918
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:19,580
it'd be cute if we're like snoozing together i'm gonna be like chainsounds.sfx fucking rope sfx

919
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:25,660
i don't know shuffling soft breathing like all that jazz that's a long ass script no no no it's

920
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:33,340
five collabs it's five collabs it goes emmy and then it goes icers uh icie here and then it goes

921
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:38,220
mersey which is two yandere's tied you up because you guys want scottish yandere

922
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:48,300
i you like that i bet you do uh azure uh goddesses i get upgraded to goddess status um i'll work on

923
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:54,620
it i might come back and do something different sheepsters two office ladies uh and you do overtime

924
01:49:54,620 --> 01:50:00,300
i think that's a really good title um and then basically oh my god you look so tired

925
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:06,300
you have confessed you have not slept at all oh no we must pamper you at once asimar continues

926
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:12,780
listener falls asleep all is good in the world amen yeah

927
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:19,260
they give her all the love and she's just down atrocious shake in my head my head

928
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:27,180
yes yandere's johnny is good i thought i was the only love of your life what do you mean is

929
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:35,260
any like my accent what do you mean and you don't find it intimidating are you no scared of me are

930
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:42,140
you no fear of what i'm going to do to you if i catch you with another girl that's what i thought

931
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:48,140
so sit down senpai and take it like a good boy yeah that's what you want

932
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:55,980
a scottish yandere who would want that definitely release date when question mark i don't know when

933
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:01,980
the girls will be available it sounds like emi's absolutely tag teamed up the wazoo doing asimar

934
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:07,260
scripts asmar collapse so i'm gonna let her cook for a bit there's no major rush on these as i said

935
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:12,300
like i think there was just straight up hoping to move out so is mercy um before any of this stuff

936
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,340
this is this is just kind of goofing off and showing you what it's like congrats on 9k oh

937
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:24,540
i o seven videos now yes but thank you so much for all the support and the subscriptions

938
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:29,100
it's kind of crazy honestly freaking nine percent of the way to a play button

939
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:32,860
and like all i've been doing is farting about on kids games and shit and being like yeah this is

940

944
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:08,700
which is why this has taken me two hours to write not even a full script lol and i get

945
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:14,220
super distracted and you guys wouldn't stop freaking tipping saying and now they make out like

946

980
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:58,380

981
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:05,180
pick it up again can we get a veal or stank tier list so everyone thought mersey was the stinkiest

982
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:11,100
because she like made reference to something and me was like sitting behind the scenes like

983
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,180
i haven't showered or washed in all these days and i don't even wear deodorant behind the

984
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:20,060
sea like because if i don't go outside what's the point of wearing deodorant uh and i'm like the

985
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:27,420
pu allure agatius imagine scented candles that's i've actually seen that there's like this brand

993
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:26,940
if i'm gonna nap so the only problem with that eight hour sleep fix is i am not awake in the

994
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:37,980
middle of the night to to record ASMR because it gets really loud uh because of traffic and stuff

995
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:43,420

heard one of them was that he would spit blood and wipe it on the wall no no please elaborate

1017

what about how i wash my butt after i poop i never feel clean i don't know if you guys have

1018
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:07,020
a big butt but i have to stand up to wipe sometimes thank you for the tip for all the legend i don't

1019
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:11,740

1020
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:19,260
up and wipe sometimes i can't sit down and do it it doesn't work because my cheeks are so big

1021
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:27,260
so i have to go for a shower as well well i stand yeah that's why i'm like i want a japanese toilet

1022
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:36,060
the lord thickens honestly i always squat it doesn't make me clean no i just get a shower like

1026
02:01:54,380 --> 02:02:00,620

1028
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:14,540
let's wrap it up we'll redirect into sheebie who is definitely not talking or articulating about

1029
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:20,620
any of these types of conversations um she uh tell me you brush your teeth no i actually have no

1030
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:26,700
problems with brushing my teeth i genuinely have no problems flossing etc um so i'm quite happy

1031
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:33,180
to report in on that it's just the pheromone maxim no wonder you can give a round of applause

1039
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:26,540
like this but i could probably show you a finished collab script like i'm sure dempa uh would be

1040
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:33,740
comfortable with me showing what i sent her to record um all that thingies um that's why they

1041
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:40,860
did it oh yeah um the noise of me clapping without my hands wasn't offensive or against the rules it

1042
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:46,380
was me breathing in the ear when i did it when i leaned in it said like around the 10 minute 58

1043
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:52,620
seconds or something i breathed into the microphone and did it and that's what got me taken down so

1044
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:59,660
