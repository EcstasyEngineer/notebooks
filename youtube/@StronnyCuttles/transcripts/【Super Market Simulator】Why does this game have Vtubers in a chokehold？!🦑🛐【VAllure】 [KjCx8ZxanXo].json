yes thank you I'm just a little guy I pay taxes did you know that when you're fucking when you know when supermarkets prompt you to donate don't ever do it they claim that as their taxes because they get a tax rebate on a donation and they put it against the taxes they should be paying but because they're a freaking conglomerate thank you for supporting a small business do appreciate you oh oh big order thank you what do you need $5 change there is that was our biggest sale yet thank you paying taxes and my strongy stream this man loves this cereal donations are tax loopholes so whenever fast food joint that is massive or a supermarket that is massive goes would you like to donate to the starving children no but not for that reason okay you're allowed to donate in general but not via the supermarket because they use it as a freaking tax rebate okay so don't don't support via the supermarket if you want to support in general that's fine but say now let them kids starve they're literally guilt-tripping you let them motherfuckers yes if you really wanted to donate to directly to charity but the biggest way I think the biggest way you can help out the community is unironically

I don't sell cheese! There's no indication of cheese being sold in the shop. You're not allowed to ask for products, ma'am, that we don't sell. Miss, get back here. I will fistfight you in the back in the parking lot. Get back here. We don't sell cheese. There's no indication we should be selling cheese. Do you know what my license is? Are you the person I bought the freaking license from? Relax. It's not that serious. It honestly isn't. Oh, I can't even find the cheese. Yeah, nay, shite. There's nay fucking fridges. Of course there's nay cheese. Do you know how hot it is outside? Like, honestly, the whole world doesn't revolve around you, ma'am. Strong behavior. I didn't know... I didn't know they were allowed to be demanding, like, oh, but she could sell cheese. Now, it'd be different if they were like, oh, I can't wait for you to expand to sell cheese, but oh, there's nay cheese. Of course there's nay cheese. Are you gonna pay for the fridge? It's 200 quid. I've not got 200 quid via flour sales unless you want to, like, open up a bakery and use me as your supply chain. Sure, you can complain then, but are you freaking kidding me? Like, honestly, that absolute cheek of some folk. Good afternoon, sir. Sorry about that outburst. I was just talking to my co-worker on the headset. I promise I wasn't having a random mental health breakout burst. Right, we are gonna need more products. Just shove anything in here. Right, we can't sell cheese because everything needs water. Eh, I need a shelf apparently. No, not right now! Okay. Could you imagine a customer and we're just going, you can take your money back by right-clicking on the bills on the cash register. Oh, did I make a mistake? I don't know. Change a dollar. Did I make a mistake? Couldn't find the sliced bread. Yeah, because I don't sell it! Jeez. Jeez, you guys are like so needy, honestly. Right, bread? You want bread? What, you want cereal? Cereal's $41? Oh my lord, I don't have that kind of money. Oh my god, I need to hire someone else to do the machines, honestly.

I need your help. I don't have time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The cheese. Why is everyone addicted to cheese? I thought you were all lactose intolerant by like 50% of the nation become, who knocked over my packages? I thought everyone becomes lactose intolerant like so quickly. Okay, drop. Just shove it on the floor. Good afternoon. Hello, thank you for your custom. You would like $2 change. Oh, here it is. Thank you, veiler lover for the extended membership. Just imagine these are needy reeflings waiting for your next audio, honestly. Everyone like excited for the next audio and then it's me with a dick. Oh, everyone was like absolutely like, oh, so disappointed. Oh, thank you for the exact change, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Who is knocking over my packages? Please don't do that. Can I restock?

All yours. All yours, baby. I'm restocking whilst on the job. I'm actually so good at this. Sorry. I'm such a good multitasker. Did you know that it is a common misconception that women can multitask more, but actually it's just practice behavior because yeah, you can't, I don't sell tea. I didn't know they could be so cheeky and ask for stuff I didn't even sell, honestly. I've got nothing but the cheek you lot do, honestly, honestly, honestly. I'm on to you. I'm on to you. Didn't think I'm on to you. Sorry, I need to clean up the storage. Excuse me, sir. Sorry, just a moment. Just a moment. Can you run in this game? That'd be really helpful. Don't ding that bell. Don't ding the bell on the register. I'm just about to be there. Please give me a second. Thank you. Buy a boh here. I bet him buy a boh here. I know you couldn't find the bottled water because it's in a package that you'll never know about. No. I'm just buying everything. Okay. I'm here and the lights are getting Friday nights and the lights are low. Hold on. I need to put the lights on. It's so dark, my lady. That audio is not my cup of tea, but I'm still gonna listen to it. Are you even though you don't like it? Thank you. It's not for everyone. It's not for everyone, but I do have some outrageous audios coming out soon. Thank you, Broly Legend for the tip and for giving it a shot. I mean, some people are like, so they're like, I would never listen to this. It's disgusting. I'm like, bro, relax. I'm literally pretending to have a willy. It's not that serious. What do you mean you don't want me to clap your cheeks? If reeflings come work for you, you require good benefits. You can't provide those right? Winking face. What kinds of benefits would you like anonymous is the question? I mean, there's not as long as you don't report it to HR. There's not much that I'm not happy with, you know? $9, $5, 1, 1, 1, 1. Boom. If I read cheese one more time, I'm gonna shove cheese up someone's arse. Let's just very quickly purchase all this shit and then I can put it on the shelves. Oh, no, let's stay open because there's a customer. Open. I was anything but disappointed with the latest audio, Mama. In fact, I was elated that I had the house to myself so I could use my new figureine to it. No. My figureine died, though, and I have to try again another day. No. Your figure died? I would love to work in your store, Mama. I'll handle the heavy packages as long as you handle my heavy package. You don't even have to pay me. I just want to ogle at my little seed. Okay, that was actually really good. I'll give you that. That was really good. God, some late night shoppers, huh? Burning the midday oil. Go home. Jeez. Oh my. What? How? It must be because they're spawning around the corner. Jeez, you guys don't love your families? My goodness. Thank you so much. Anonymous. I have really weak wrists and hands, so unironically, I will take that help. I'm so freaking weak. I'm a weakling, okay? I'm a weakling. A weak little seaweed. It's shocking behavior. The Rizzler. Thank you. Orvon Biscuit as well. How did it die is my question. And what? How did it die? It's got a... Not that word. It's got a battery in it. Is that my question? What was that meme that it's like, oh, so a woman can have a d-d-d-d-d-9000, but if I have a d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-x elemental pee, I'm the weird one. What is that meme that has just reminded me of that meme? I can't remember it though. Family who sent them to the corner. Oh my god, my mom used to send me the corner shop to get cigarettes all the time. Actually, I will say one thing about the Belgians. You guys are so nice, because I didn't have my ID in this Belgian lady. Let me buy cigarettes. And she was like, you look too young. And I'm like, hee hee, but I'm from Scotland though. I was like, I'm from Scotland, so no one's going to get you in trouble. And like, I literally started speaking to her and I was like, yeah, I don't speak Dutch. I'm not from here. I literally just need cigarettes. Smile. Thank you, Maycule, for becoming a member. I appreciate it. I'm sorry for butchering your name. Please forgive me. Right, tomorrow we can purchase the fridge. So our beloved package of, that's just, that's being chilling in the corner. Right, we can have cheese tomorrow. Okay, let's go to bed. Oh wait, no, do we have bills? Alone? No, we're not taking out a loan. We hate the banks. Oh my god, 67 cents. Wait, every day it's gonna cost me 20 bucks. Judy, that's rough. I don't make 70 bucks on every purchase. Right, new name, new date. Stop, I'm getting ready to write that plot. Stop, you're getting me ready to write that plot. Oh, don't think I won't do it. Don't think I won't write that plot. That's absolutely hilarious. Oh, I like a little guard as well. I don't even notice I've got a little guard to protect me from the customers from this side. I will literally thank you for the tip and honest. I will write that. Please don't think I won. I'm literally, I love like freaking plots that we do together. It's my favorite thing. This woman truly will do it. Do it, you won't know boss. Shake bag if you didn't. Shake bag if you didn't. Don't throw it at us with a good time. Hello, any customers? Are you my first customer? Actually, I've never even, we must be in New York because those things like the fire exit things always look like they're from New York. Oh, we have a customer. Are you squidding me right now? Hi, mama. I just tuned in. I just wanted to say you stole my heart during yesterday's stream when you read my morrow before you logged off. Turning on your hypno eyes and talking about control was so unbelievably hot. Now I really want to ink in your clown. I mean, I can make something like that. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, honestly, I can. Don't think I won. Yes, it had a battery. I thought it would work better than the unpowered ones I tried in the past, but didn't find enjoyable using them by myself. Oh, we're getting a live review. I need mommy's help to enjoy my cheeks being clapped. That is terrible. Amazing. Thank you. Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous and out of on biscuit. No, so obviously, I can't really make anything and I can't record new ASMR until my dad goes away, but he goes away next week. I'm actually going to be so depressed. So don't be surprised when I when I stream and for like 12 hours, and then I'm like, I don't want to go offline because I don't want to be sad in my emotions the moment I go offline because like I'm never sad when I'm like streaming to you. And like I'm always happy like just like having the time of my life. So I just know I'm going to be so depressed, but I'm happy on stream. But as soon as I end stream, like it's literally going to be that meme where it's like with the music, like I'm not going to I'm not going to be having a good time next week, but you guys will make it that have a good time. And you know, I know you guys will make a good time. So I need just as needed as we fling. I mean, I think that's why we work so well together. We fling. I mean, you know, you don't report me to HR. We do some things in the break room, you know, I don't report you for something, something, something, something, something. I am happy to help you in the shop. And as payment all I ask is that you give me some cream like you did in the recent order. Honestly, do you want some creamer for your coffee in the morning at my supermarket? We'll call it. What would we call it? Oh, you can't rename it. Oh, I thought what is city gates? City gates. Um, I what would we name the shop though? If we had one. Squid ink. A dollar for you, madam. Thank you for your custom. Right. We're at 100 bucks. We just need a few more sales, please. Squirts. You want, you want this supermarket to be called squirts? Oh no, this can't be. You can see ink. Coldstone creamery. I'm not sure we're going to get a wave. Although, can we make one of those cringy American ads? Jones, barbecue foot massage. And then our version is like, uh, Strone and Reflings, Inc. Emporium or something like that. I don't know what we'd call it. Ink mark. Well, like ink mark. Strone and Reflings, ink mark. Come on down to get your things. Come on down to get your things. We're anti-capitalist, but we still have to participate in society. But it's okay because our prices are lower than the monopolies. That's our theme song. It's like the worst jingle you could imagine. And everyone's like, why did they put ads into this? This is awful. Honestly. Thank you. Oil, oil, oil. I know you Americans like your oil. Take it. Take all my oil. Right, $137. We're almost there. Thank you for your purchases. $17. Oh, nope. I almost messed up so bad. Sir, you have no idea how much I about overcharged you. You're so welcome. I was on it. Are you squidding me right now? You charged him $0.09? Hi, Mama. I remembered you once said that Reflings are able to hypno you just like you can hypno us. Yes. Can you teach us how? A mind broken straw knee would be amazing to see, to see our cheeky little less get addicted to Reflings ink. I'm already addicted to, you only send a man of marshmallows. I demand marshmallows. So technically you can hypnotize me at any time, but in my head, I've done it that you prefer to do it via a mirror because you like when I do it to myself, like it's more satisfying for you that way. I'm not going to run out of freaking things. Thank you for the hypno. Top tier servicing. No matter how big or small, we work until you're satisfied. And I don't think the work is talking about the average nine of five. Call it ink and drink. Thank you. Lars the dude for the tip. Yeah, I'm not convinced you're talking about the average nine to five work. I think we're talking about another kind of work. You know what I'm saying? How's the weather in Australia? Are you okay Reflings? Did you get a little nervous typing that out? Thank you for letting me pop your super cherry. Oh, no, no, you're, I said that wrong. I said that wrong. Sorry. Other me. Thank you for letting me pop your super cherry. No, you're super cherry. I'm so sorry. That sounded like an insult. I didn't mean it like that. It's winter. So it's cold. It's cold. Okay, eight dollars. Did that charge anything for that? Did I just let you walk out for free? I think I did. I think I messed that up. Your mega chair, your super mega cherry is main boy. You're not getting away from me that easily. Right. Okay, we're done. We can buy a fridge. I assume I can buy a fridge or do I need to do it in the morning? Here is the fridge. A mini fridge. Okay. Oh crap. I have to do it in the morning. We'll also add a product into it. What are we missing? Oh my God, please. You're welcome to buy anything you like. Buy everything. Yes, yes. Okay, I'll take it. Three items are better than one. You know what I'm saying? Thank you for your custom. I couldn't find sushi, even cheese. How come you didn't mention that you can speak French? Because I can't. I can say like one or two sentences and I can throw stuff together. It's pretty much it. I can't actually speak French. I can say like, oh, je voudrais, you know, tabit. I can ask for your cock. I can ask for your horse in French. To say butt in French, you say cool. Thank you, dindle shit, 500. What a name for the super chat, by the way. You're super chat cherry. Yeah, to say your butt, you say mon cul. Are you squiddling me right now? So, Strani, if we already have the capability to hypno you, does that mean we can turn on mind broken Strani whenever we want? Do we snap our fingers? Say a certain phrase? Um, so if you've ever looked, ah, you know what? I'll show you. This is my loading screen. Look at you in the loading screen. Oh wait, this is my ending screen. I know you can still hear me in this, but yeah, you can. See how you're on my head right now in here? Wait for it. Wait for it. Look at you. Look at you on the top of my head. Ready, steady. We both have hypnosis. Look, you have the hair thing like I do. Yeah, you got the little hair thing, little hypnotic thing. Yeah, it's real. That's you. You can do that to me and I can do it to you. I forgot which gaming thing I was on. Like I'm on this one. Oh, where's my game? Well, we're not doing that again. That was scary, please. That scared me. Right, we've got a fridge and we've got 13 bucks so we can order bread and then tomorrow we can purchase it. Okay, and it's only $2 for delivery. That's fantastic. Closed. New day. New day. Right, we're going to very quick. Products found expensive, so is, but no from the, not from around here, partner, not from around here. Right, hold on. Give me the fridge right now. It's a fridge. Oh my head, rotate with mouse wheel. Okay, can I slot you right here? Oh my god. Display is full. Wait, the fridge is tiny. She said she was 12. Sorry, I said it like that. Hold on. Open. No, draft. Some products went down in price but you didn't follow. How dare they? They're making, they're making a mockery of me. They're making a mockery. Right, I only have two dollars. Right, let's set a price for the water. Water. Market price is $2.13, so we'll do two bucks. What are you? We need to lower the oil. Of course, I invest in tons of oil in the games like, yeah, we're going to just artificially lower the price. Right, bread's up at four bucks. Yeah, nine. What's flour? Okay, flour's fine. Flour's fine, don't worry about it. Okay, hydration check, reeflings. Hydration check. Hydration. I'm gonna burp okay. Open your mouth, reefling. Open wide. All yours, baby. Good boy for opening your mouth. It's fucking disgusting. That's actually disgusting. You know what, you know what the worst part is when I do something like that, like a gag like that? Oh, hit me on one. Hi, I'm a first-time customer for this establishment and I was wondering if you sold any exotic items. Maybe a dog, collar, and bowl. Sound familiar, Stronny? Okay, if you didn't know, I may or may not have an alternative Twitter account, okay, and I may or may not have purchased a collar. Oh, give me that back. Oh, you know what, fuck it, you can have it for free. Thanks for your custom. I may or may not have bought a dog bowl and a dog collar with your name on it because you own me. So some people were like, oh, you need to put like Stronny on it. But if you own me, I should technically have your name on me. So I have a bowl coming with your name on it. And that's, I don't know if the collar's going to say property of refling or just refling. I hope it says property of refling because I'm going to come so fucking hard whenever I, you guys are getting the audio where you can literally hear it like jingling on my chest. Or maybe I should put it on and then you can hear me put it on. I like it. Bit bread, bit bread, a little dollar change for you ma'am. Stronny, what? No, Ms. Mano, you're not supposed to be here. Ms. Mano, Ms. Mano, I'm just, I'm confessing, Ms. Mano, I'm confessing. The accuser, purchase a new section in your computer. I heard all that. No, Ms. Mano, that's even more embarrassing. Oh, I'm just gonna, I need to expand growth. I could probably change it. I have enough time. Did I goof? Shit. Did I mess that up? Am I supposed to be strong on it? Am I that brain dead? The answer, yes. I unknowingly pulled up to the freaky store apparently. Stop. No, this is Squid Mart. Welcome to Squid Mart where all your needs are met. Are you okay? Ma'am? Oh my God, is she okay? Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am? What do you need? Are you being assigned? I think she's been assigned something on the shelf. I'll help the AI. Don't worry, I'm here. Oh, oh, she, I didn't know they had, you know, crackheads in this game. That's terrible. Do not use such derogatory terms for people who are afflicted with the older addiction. That's terrible. I don't think she's feeling that good, I'm gonna be honest. Oh, my needs, go on. Can't make up her mind. Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip. Okay, I will get that changed. There's more than enough time. I promise there's more than enough because I only just did it. So I'm sure I can like change it because it gets custom made and they had like a big warning that was like, oh, you need to give us like plenty of time. And vitamins to ensure our inks of THR best quality and potency. You only get two days a month after all. Squid mark for all your inking needs. Not you guys learning. Oh, reluctantly saying that was such a good bit. I love that. Not you guys learning about ovulation. Thanks to me. Oh, are you guys okay? God, there's two now. What have I done wrong? I'm not sure what I've done wrong, if I'm being honest. Right, the light's going on now. So this place isn't freaking dark. And you just put it on all the time. Damn, you and Belgan called it. She's undecided on what's a better product. Bro, they're literally, I don't, the AI is having a hard time with the oil right now. I'm not really sure why. Come on, AI. Look at them heels though, heels. Oh, and they put in height differences. Honestly, this has been quite a decent bit of, considering this is early access, I mean, I would say it's pretty polished. Am I, am I going crazy? I know I shouldn't encourage, but if it's not like a mega-cabillion thingy, I don't think it's actually a bad rate. If you two, are you two, can you get out of me right now? Don't listen to them. I like property of reefling on the collar. I can imagine giving it a little tug and pull you in for a deep, passionate kiss and a hard spank to your cuttlefish arse. Be a good little pet for me, strongy. Are you squiddin' me right now? Right, well, I get two versions. I can get two versions. No cheese, one star review. Stop. I'm working on the cheese, okay? A customer's out the, you guys weren't there for ages. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I can't read chat. Oh, no, no. Fuck it. Take it. Take the change. You're welcome. Oh, you're going to complain after I give you extra change? Go away. Thank you so much. Red flame kraadin. Kraadin? Where are you from? Kraadin. Red flame kraadin. What? Why do I think you're European? That's right. I've sussed you out. I'm coming to your house. What are you going to do about it? I can just shortchange that person. You're selling a product without... Oh, and you would buy four of them. I've not set the price. Oh, jeez. How do you do this? Oh my god. Oh my god. I've not set the price. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese. I've not set the price. Cheese. Three bucks. Go. Of course you'd buy the fucking cheese. I've not set the price. Your mum, yeah? Customer Greg? No way your name is actually customer Greg. Please tell me you changed that to do that super chat. Is your name actually customer Greg? That's your online handle. That's hilarious. Thank you for your one star review. I'm trying my best, okay? Couldn't find the black... That's what I think about you, honestly. I'm fucking getting tired of this shit. Everyone's so needy for a product I don't sell and they should have no indication that I freaking sell it, honestly. Snowberries. Skippity. Why did you put on skippity? That's going to be stuck in my head now. No, don't type that. Hi, snowberries. How is acicle stream? Was she having fun with you? Was she tormenting you? Was she teasing you? Was she pleasing you? That's what I like to hear. How could this delicious brat be so gorgeous? Yeah, actually it's the other way around to do. I think the tormenting was the other way around. You tormenting my precious little acicle? How dare you? Unless she likes it and that's different. Well, there's cars in this game. I mean, in all honesty, what do they have to do to polish off this game? I mean, the method seems to work of the shop. Am I going crazy and saying that this game really isn't that bad? Storage? I'm not going to bother with that. Just seems like $800 for nothing. I don't know. Maybe it comes more... Is this a staff room? Unironically, is this a toilet? This is where me and the reeflings go after a long day. It's just a helping hand. It's levitating. Look at that PC. What are the specs? There's a 1080 inside that for ordering stuff? Why do businesses get all the tax rebates? Why can't I like an average show? I was in the snowys earlier and I came over here when your stream started because I haven't seen a second of a velar stream before today. Oh, no. Oh, no. You picked the worst. Don't start with me. Start with anyone else in velar. I'm the worst fucking choice to start your velar experience with because I'm wildly inappropriate at all times. Are you squinting me right now? Wildly inappropriate at all times. Since you seemed so excited about the property of reeflings part, maybe the caller can say that and the bowl has your name so you know it's your bowl that we let you use when you're hungry for ink. Either way, it's about what gets you going more. I think, why is it 55 bucks for that? Better be a big moneymaker. I think we're gonna get both. You're super wholesome. Oh, yeah. I'm the one of the few Americans who can understand the Scottish accent. Like, I'm very lucky that you guys can understand it, but I do confess you're not gonna like this part reefling. I purposefully annunciate more. I'm sorry. I do. It's just a tooth. Oh, shit. I hate when I do that honestly. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, that was a lot of product. Do you sell puppy tails? I need the plug type in three different training sizes. My cuttlefish puppy girl is getting uppity and needs some correction via banal training. Okay, I may actually be buying that soon as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I'm going to be buying that soon. I need a new one. Okay, I need a new one. Thank you Anonymous for the tip and thank you Zarian as well. I might be getting that product. All right, I didn't want to be outrageous, but I kind of want to show you guys all the things I want to buy in like a week's time, but it's going to be really bad. Like, it's going to be really fucking bad. Excuse me, Ms. where do you keep the cucumbers and the lube? Why you ask for no reason? I'm sure. Hold on, Anonymous. I'm sure I've seen that meme that is like by bomb bombs, by a cucumber and by lube and then look the cashier dead in the eyes while you do it. Are you squinting me right now? For no particular reason. Does this mean Stronny will be getting a tail soon? To go with the collar, we need to make sure the collar is nice and tight around her neck so you can always feel like reeflings are gripping your throat and telling you to behave. Are you squinting me right now? I'm trying to do my job here, not get away. What the fuck's going on? Hi, Stronny just wanted to let you know I walk my dog every day, but it makes me sad because I wish it was in his tent. Oh my god. I'm going to need a slippery caution, slippery one wet sign on the floor in a minute. What the fuck? We're not getting sued, okay? We're not getting sued because someone had a little fumble. I'm not having it. Whoa, what did I just give you? Ten bucks? Okay, that was really lucky. I still don't know how to retract the money. I've yet to figure it out. Stronny, if you put them on throne, would be happy to buy it for you? Oh, I don't know. I find it so hard to accept gifts like that. I don't know. Like, I don't mind buying it. Am I weird for considering you're fairly normal and wholesome? I mean, for the most part, you know, we've been chaining, don't you mind? I don't think, um, flower is too expensive. I'm so sorry. My flower does not reflect today's prices. No, it does not get aim. Two dollars for the flower. I apologize, my good sir. All yours, no change. Thank you for your exact card. Yes, 19 dollars. Awesome degeneracy is what my wife and I call it, honestly. Stronny with a short color refill. Well, I have a short color stream coming up very quickly. So basically, there's going to be multiple streams for a little while. So don't be surprised if some of them are outrageous. I'm literally going to have to explain to my dad that I'm doing a ring fit stream. So whatever he overhears, if he is awake, he is to ignore because I'm going to be like a bus of ass. I have not exercised since debut. No, I am not exaggerating. Bro, I'm getting you stuck in, man. Give me a chance to have some freaking stock. Right, we need more stock of something. I don't know what yet. Cheese, milk, dark roast coffee is how right. We'll get eggs as well. We've not had eggs. I'm getting a variety. I promise I'm getting a variety. I promise. This puppy cuttlefish is going to need a muzzle to keep her quiet when reeflings breed her like a bitch in heat. I'm at my job and you're in my earpiece telling me these kinds of things. How am I supposed to look these customers in the eye and say have a good day? I am trembling. I am quaking at this till right now. I'm trying my hardest to focus. I am trying my hardest to focus and I'm quaking right now. It must be placed in a fridge. Okay, that's fine. Oh my god, that is so sad. Pop that there because I want to make sure, I want to make sure, okay. Mummy, now you know how all the reeflings who listen to you at work still, it's still my favorite thing. Sorry, I'm making an audio for it. I don't care. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't care. I need to make an audio for it. I need you. I have a matey. Don't buy the coffee. I've not set the price. Nine dollars. That's a big profit. Three dollars per unit sold. I'm doing it right now. Whoa, this is our biggest freaking thing ever. Thank you. Thirty two dollars. The pleasure is all mine. I assure you the pleasure is all mine. Why is of course. Cheeky dollar change. All yours sir. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa. Okay, let's get that light on. I can already see it getting dark. Don't think I don't know your games. Not again. Why are they struggling? Are you squiddin' me right now? With a pathing. What's the problem? The next day, still no cheese. No, no, no, no. Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. Okay, cheese, cheese, cheese. Boom. Cheese is in the cart. Cheese, cheese is in the front door. Freeze, cheese is in the front door. Oh my God, what are you talking about? I have no idea. Customer Greg, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, my good sir. Look at that. You even have two shelves of cheese. Your claims of not having cheese, unfounded customer Greg. How dare you? Completely unfounded. I have absolutely no, your accusations against my store. I ask you instantly to remove your one-star review and a trip advisor to my freaking supermarket. It is unfounded and it is damaging the sales and my profit margins. Change, no change, exact change. Thank you, good sir. Couldn't find the cereal. Yeah, you're right. You can't find the cereal. You want to know why? Because there's none in stock. Boom. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean. Thank you, customer Greg. And thank you Anonymous for all the tips. You guys are playing with fire because the efficiency of the gameplay is about to severely go down if you keep this up. Okay, card. Yes, $19. Thank you, good sir. All yours. Oh, thank you for your costume. No, appreciate it. Your change. $50, $20. Go. Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you. Cheese. Yes, cheese. Take the cheese. There's customer Greg right there in the making. There he is. He's picking up some products. Oh, there you go. There's your cheese. Yep. Thank you. Please remove that terrible review you left on the supermarket. Would appreciate it. I'm going to start slacking off at work. Slacking off. Oh my God, that should be the name of the title. Slacking off with your co-worker at work. Oh my God. I love it. Don't worry about being late, you goofy goober. You have a sheebie ace of art to look forward to. Be kind, reeflings. Over exposure to work times, mud can lead to premature ink ejaculation. It's a serious issue and affects one in every five cephalopods. Are you squiddin' Maria? It's okay, my little cephalopods, I believe you. I can imagine Strani as a puppy girl. I mean she has the tongue belicking, of course. And she did tell us yesterday that her cervix is good for doggy. Stop! If you don't use juice, cetentical bone, you are gonna have to bake like a good puppy. Are you squiddin' me right now? Stop! Strani, you are a good girl. Stop! But don't worry, even if you misbehave, we'll still take you on walkies. You'll just have to be muzzled, blindfolded, and have an egg vibing in the clam for correction purposes. I am interested. You can't be saying the stuff in my head, peas. We're getting explicit 50 nine. I can't focus on the numbers, Mason! Me next. Thank you anonymous and reluctantly seen. Stop it! You're making me embarrased. God, you guys are really having... Why is it only women have problem with the shelf? I'm starting to think something's going on here. What are the odds that both women are known for window shopping and they can't decide on what product to buy at the stage? Stop. How is this on YouTube? Why? We're in a supermarket. What are you all about? We're in a supermarket. Excuse me, miss, you seem to have a wet patch. It is in aisle one, it had an odd taste to it, and also it smells like clowns. No! Strani, I think we need to get a clicker to help you stay motivated while working and be a good girl. No! Stop it! Thank you, anonymous and rent desolation. Stop! Right, I didn't focus. You're getting redirected into Sheebie's ASMR anyway, so she gonna keep you going. Right, I'm sorry but what is going on here? Seriously, three of you make up your mind. Your husbands are at home wondering where you are and you're just going nuts over the oil. There must be something wrong with the shelf. I don't know. Can I push it forward? Carry? Okay. I'm just gonna move it forward. No, it didn't make them adjust. Huh. What? What's wrong with the pathing? I don't see it. It must be the product then. Hmm. User confusing me, ladies. I don't know what's the matter. I'm afraid I don't know what the matter is. Right, I'm gonna try and sell out of my product to buy the next upgrade to expand the shop. They're bugging. Yeah. They're bugging? I don't know what's going on with them. Oh crap, we have bills to pay. Oh, come on. We're like all the way down again. This game is actually hard. Sorry, I said it. Last time you bought Flour, it fixed. Are they wanting Flour? Is that why everyone's having a hard time? I'm gonna try and sell out my product so I can expand the store. If everyone buys everything that I've got right now, then boom, we can do the next objective. We will never make money at this rate. Typical Scottish corner shop, actually, though. Our money. That game literally made the game wants us to take along because we don't do that here. No, we don't borrow from the banks. We blow them up. Stop. Refling. You can't say that out loud. But you were thinking it. All right, hydration check, refling. You need hydrate. Honestly, the begging girlfriend ASMR made you laugh your ass off. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was so fun to come up with. I came up with everyone's meme ASMR ideas, but I didn't want to risk anyone's channel. I came up with that idea myself and I was like, okay, I'll risk my channel by saying something silly like that. It popped off. It might hit 100K, which is insane. It's insane to say your first uploaded ASMR video might get 100K views. That's insane. I actually think we're gonna be... Oh, thank you for all your... Your... Yes, thank you, custom. Thank you. Love you. The gamble has played off, honestly. You did this to yourself, Strone. I remember you once challenging reflings that if they wanted to dominate you, they'd have to do a lot better. Now we have finally found your weakness, Puppy No! No, no, no, no. I literally just got tingles. Like, my body literally reacted to that. What the fuck? No! Thank you, anonymous, but no! Stop. I'm trying to freaking run a supermarket. Le supermarch\u00e9. J'ai travaill\u00e9. Le supermarch\u00e9, mes yeux. Non jou\u00e9 dans la travailler. I'm fucking trying so hard to say stuff in French. Bro, right, relax. I don't know what's going on. We're gonna need to move it. Can you guys let me put it down before you come over and glitch out again? How do I take the stuff off the shelf? It's messing up my game. How do I take the stuff off the shelf? Okay, you know how I said the game's polished? I take it back. I take it back. The game's not polished. The women are stuck again. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I think the game needs a little bit more work, but overall, we're getting there. There's definitely something glitched out on that shelf. I'm gonna see if I can take the stuff off it, like the products off of it, maybe. I don't really know what the issue is. $24! All yours, sir. Thank you. We need $350 before the end of the day. And because you are all being assigned here, I think we're getting less customers as well, because the game can't assign too many customers at work. She's hypnotizing that. They're baffled by the low prices. They can't comprehend. I think you need an empty box to remove stuff. Right, okay, let's grab a box. We'll just buy whatever. It's on cheap. Right, bread. Let's go. Purchase. Let's go. And then... No! Just wait a second, please. Close through, drop, take. Are you squiddin' me right now? The box doesn't match the size, are you jokin'? I bet you all it would take is a surprise slap to her arse or an extreme shock to her collar. And she would be whimpering and panting and drooling at the mouth for her eflings. I must have them hypno eyes rolling in the back of your head ahead of our style. What am I even s- What do I even see? What was I supposed to see? Thank you, Rufeland, for the tips. And on to the mid-today, clearly. I thought I'm the one that's supposed to be coming up with the scenarios, not you. Right, oil. Buy it and then get fricking rid of it off the dang shelves. Okay, yes, yes, yes, thank you. Thank you, Ruf. So got another week. Man, I'm sick of this TTS spam. I want to watch a Stranny Cutler stream, not Brian's, each. Are you had enough of Brian? Brian! Right, Brian, that's enough out of you, young man. Do you- Did I make myself clear? Brian, no more. Okay. All right, as Brian dealt with, don't worry, I got you, Rufeland. Right, you, all. How do I put it in? Take. See you all glitching out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they all- Right, I'm leaving this box here in case it's glitchy, because what the heck was all that about, honestly? Oh, it's getting dark in the shop. Ah, it's getting dark. I'm scared of the dark unironically. Are you squidding me right now? This place is too small and crowded. Two stars. Are you helping me? Are you- Wait, are you helping me gameplay-wise via role-playing as a customer? Are you helping me gameplay-wise role-playing as a customer? I think you are, because we do need to expand. We just need the 350. Thank you, customer Greg's- Wait, what? There's no way. There's actually no way. I'm $1 short from expanding. This is meta. This is why I like backseat gaming. That is so creative. That is so creative. I can even do that myself. Oh my gosh, right. Management, growth, section two. Purchase this section to expand. There we go, we did it. Oh my gosh, that is hilarious. Thank you, customer Greg's fucking way to dollars change, ma'am. Thank you. Couldn't find- No, you're not going to find nothing in this shop. Look at it. Oh my god, our scene got upgraded. It's getting so big. Yay. Okay, I need to push the products back on the shelf. This is not backseat and you are in a video game. No, because some features don't like it when you tell them what to do and I'm like, please help me so much. Thank you again for the tip. That was so creative. Customer Greg's wave, that's hilarious. Honestly, hilarious. Right, we're going to push some stuff back. We need to- I wonder if you can buy the supermarket radio. Right, all the frozen products are going to go along this- well, or cold products, I guess. I'm going to keep the boxes in case something glitches out again, because that was a bit of a nightmare to fix. Nice, it's not an average customer shop anymore. It's not. Look how big the windows are as well. We are up. We- oh my god, sorry. Can I just say the serotonin boost of like physically seeing your shop getting bigger because all of your hard work paid off? I love these kind of games. Oh my god. I love these kind of games. I said it. I said it. I'm sorry. I don't care. I said it. Right, what's the next objective? Oh, we haven't been assigned one. Right, what are the bills? I'll pay the seven dollars. I can't pay rent. Stronny be a good girl. Roll onto your back and I will give you a some tummy rubs. Then if you keep being good, maybe I will give you this bone. No! You called yourself Stronny's trainer! Reef- wait, we only have oil. Reef-ling! You can't- oh, maybe that could be a nickname for you guys. You can be my personal trainer. Could we get away with that? Could we? Should we? I don't know. Right, if I bought one of everything, how much is that? Are you squidy? We can do 200 bucks. Remember, Stronny, if you want something, you are going to have to bark for it. A good girl likes you knows that you can't speak English. Years are done. Years are done. No more. Anonymous. Thank you. Me no, thank you. Hey, I'm far in the back of this seat. Maybe keep a box for each product in the storage for any more glitch shelves? Good girl. Okay. What is this? Is this a break room? Are you squidin' me right now? Is this a break room? I got a bowl with her name on it so she can shlop. Shlop oman na ala corn on the cup. This should give me hate. I only have oil to sell. This is literally an American supermarket now. America kanya! TTS was a mistake. Stop! Thank you, Tharia. IBW. Anonymous. Are you squidin' me right now? Knock, knock, mom, are you okay? Why are you salivating in front of your monitor? This puppy salivating. Okay, everyone is buying oil. Literally. Yeah, I know you can't find nothing. I ain't got no stock. Everyone please purchase the oil at your next convenience, okay? Because we are running low on the market prices lower than three bucks. Okay, hopefully it changes as well. Oh my god, I think we're gonna have to like... Oh, there's a customer. You spawned out of nowhere. You were not even in my shop a moment ago. Please. Okay, everyone. Okay, yes, just buy oil. Thank you. This is helping so much. I'm not even kidding. Please continue to buy oil. Does someone say oil's American screeching? I have a really funny clip of Azura, actually. Thank you Momo for the tip as well. I have actually a really funny clip of Azura. I might send it to her and see if she will let me post it. It was us before we did the group collab on debut. She randomly starts singing the American national anthem, but Azura's got some lungs on her. She's like, and I'm like in the background. I'm like, make check, make check, and she's like, I'm like, Amy, Amy, make check, make check, just so we can hear you. It was really funny, so I'm gonna see if she's happy with me post it because it was hilarious. I'm like being super serious. Like, oh, that was good guys, right? Make check, mercy, make check, check, check, and then buy the drones early night. It was absolutely hilarious. So, okay, I'm gonna have to buy some product. That isn't like a squadillion dollars because, right, 64 bucks. Yeah, just, yeah, one oil. Yep. I know you can't find anything, sir. You're gonna, you'll never guess why because we don't have anything in stock. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. We need an American flag bikini cookout, Azura. I think that is a fantastic alternative outfit for Azura. I actually fully agree with that. I'm not even kidding. I actually fully agree. I want to see those bedonkers bedonking in an American bikini outfit. I'll take it. You can sing pretty damn well too though. Well, I got Emmy, we finally got Emmy's song cover, which I've not paid the guy for yet. Actually, sorry, if you're watching right now, I will pay you after the stream, and I just need some time to nap after the stream, and then I will deal with the rest. Gonna grill them dogs, honestly though. Are you squidding me right now? Just thinking about how a strong themed Tenga would go hard, and so would I. What's a Tenga? Oh, that's the wrong number. Thank you, Tharia, for the tip, or the super trot. I don't know if I have to say super trot tip. I don't know. It's the same thing. What's a Tenga? It sounds like a Konga. Konga, Konga, Konga, Konga. Tenga, Tenga, Tenga. Tenga is an honor hall. Oh, I've been singing about it. I've been singing about it. Okay, then. That's what it's called. I've never heard that terminology. Oh, you've just absolutely messed me up. Give me that back, and then put it down there. She's a degeneracy built into her blood. No, why did I buy more oil? We have more than enough oil. I'm gonna have to hire a reflin to go on the checkout, because this is getting tricky. This is getting tricky. Insufficient change. Oh, what? Giving six bucks. Okay, make it four, and then do 120, then one. Jeez. Sorry, sir. I can't count, but thank you for giving me the patience to count. Kind of blue. Come on, I need to restock here. Stop buying stuff. Give me a freaking moment to breathe. No change. Thank you. Change two dollars. Thank you. Please, I need to like quickly buy stuff like right now, because everything is so empty. I'm literally just buying anything. Please. I don't know. Bread? I've not had bread in a while. Go. Boom. We love bread. Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love bread around these parts. She's an oil. Change. Oh my God. Sorry. I love this game. I'm addicted. I'm not gonna lie. I think I could easily play 12 hours of this. I'm not sure anyone wants to actually sit and watch 12 hours of this. I didn't take this phone like the good girl you are. Reflex where I played Supermarket Simulator. I didn't know the flubber aisle really got you going. Hey, Stronny, if you are a puppy girl, what breed would you want to be? I haven't thought that far ahead. I don't know. I have black hair, so this is an interesting TTS room. Literally, I'm like, is the bakery aisle really getting you going that good? I mean, shit. I'll take it. I'm glad that you guys are enjoying it. Thank you so much. Stronny's trainer and anonymous. I am working on the stock issues, man. Please have patience for the love of God. I just get paid minimum wage. I just show up and I'm trying. I'm actually getting stressed by my virtual job. I can't believe it. I can't handle stress. Oh, God, the packages, please. Will someone please think of the packages? Milk is only two dollars? What? I'm coming, please. Wait. I was gonna say three dollars seems a bit more, a bit more economy related. Oh my God. I'm actually getting stressed. I can't keep up. Actually, unironically, can't keep up. Oh my God. I need help. I need help. I need an adult. I need an adult. Wait. I'm the adult. No. I don't have time for all of this. Right. We've got sugar again. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. Ninety. Why would you give me such big number of change? The milk is French. Wait, is it? Does it say delay on it? Does the milk say delay? Milk semi-skilled. Boulay. What? It is French. Well, zero isn't French. Okay. We're gonna unpack everything that we purchased. I have no idea what we purchased. I was just busy panicking, but okay. Not to ruin it. Right. Close your ear canal if you don't want to hear a spoiler on what one of the zero shorts are. She played supermarket simulator and one of the things she said was like, do you want my milk basically? Because she was selling milk product. But it was like such a good clip and it's getting made and I'm so excited for it to come out. A British woman selling French product. Disgusting, honestly. What will they think? Is there a Boulay? No. Don't call her that. I'm just kidding me right now. If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oils. Omega. Wait, what does that mean? Azu Ryuji. Oh, come on. You need to make your names easier for me to say. What is that? Azu Re Ya Uji. Thank you for, thank you for letting me take your cherry yonk. My cherry now. What are you gonna do about it? Yonkers. My super chat cherry now. I'm fucking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fond de la bosom. Well, you should have heard of one of the names. Right, I can tell you later but I can't tell you right now. Cover myself in oil? What? If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oil. I'm to cover myself in oil? Hard-ass names, honestly. Oil up. Stronnycuddles oiled up when? Right now. I technically already made that ASMR but I got taken down but I'm gonna put it back up on September because it wasn't the clapping that got the video taken down. It was the breathing in the ear. Yes, that is true. How much is cheese? Cheese is three bucks. How much is pasta? Pasta is three dollars. How much is bread? Bread, I am overcharging for bread. Very big. Very big overcharge? No, I will not say why. Right, tea. I made a good profit from, we've not got, I think we need another fridge. You know that. Oh, there's a thing as a double fridge. Oh, I mean, where are the floors? Oh, we can change the floor? I mean, I'm not really fussed for changing the floor. I'm not sure that's gonna make a difference to sales, is it? Unless the carpet is like absolutely minging, I think we're okay just to leave the carpet as it is. Right, pay my bills, pay my rent. I can't pay rent. Hiring, right, what's going cashier? One, automated checkout, daily wage, 80 bucks, hiring cost, 100, complete checkout. What? Complete checkout, it requires store level 10. I can't hire you refling until store level 10? It's an old troll science comic. Oil floats on water. So to fly, you cover yourself in oil, wait for it to rain, then you can fly for free. What? How was I supposed to get that reference? Thank you, tiny spiny. There's no way. Hire a reef stalker. Oh, that's actually pretty good. I'll take that. Please understand that algorithm is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the concept of breathing. Literally, though. Pass the three bucks outrageous, honestly. How? Right, so I can't hire anyone yet. That's fine. Storage, I don't want customization. Oh, I can change the name by cost, money. Change entrance. No, thank you. I'll take my tight clamp and elsewhere. Growth, right. Section three, four. So this is for the sigh. How much? How can I make this much profit selling eggs? How big can this game get? Product license. Peanut butter, flour. Oh my, this game is like way bigger than I first imagined. Banknot, market, furniture, a new shelf maybe? How much is a shelf? 100 bucks? Maybe a shelf for more, although the... Oh! A checkout. Right, a checkout means we can hire a reflin at level 10. Okay. Okay, let's just focus on getting our money up. Okay, we can do that. Clamps to take, you need industrial pliers. Stronny, your bakery always gets me going. I will eat all of your cake. Once I am done, all that will be left is some cream. Are you... Are you fucking naming Stronny's cake on us, sir? That's amazing. Thank you for the tip. The bakery, the bakery's not open. All we have is sugar. We don't even have flour. I'm out of flour already, literally. No, even started and I'm out of products. Where's flour? Go. Order. Oh no, there's something else in here. $60. Let's just get the flour in. Let's just get it in. Okay, a yolk now. Hee hee hee. Oh, I do have flour. Right, I'm just blind. I'm sorry I'm blind. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Okay, I'm blind. Grilla's out of cake. Stronny provides the egg for the bakery. Did you know you spawn in with like 10,000 eggs and literally only like 100 or viable or something silly like that? There's like some, honestly, I could talk about like pregnancy and ovulation cycle and all that. Speaking of ovulation, thank you very much for your custom goods, sir. Oh no, the conversation I'm having in the headset, it's just with my co-workers. They're locked in the room right now in the staff room. I just don't have access to my co-workers yet. It's fine. No, no, don't report me for the conversations. I know you can't find the cereal. I can't afford the cereal. That's why you can't find it, sir. Okay, I can afford it this time. Okay, you just spend your time at the shelves a lot, but no, no, no, don't go to the- thank you. They're so quick. Like, they honestly didn't give you like, I'm sorry, but you can actually see me restocking and trying to do all these jobs at the same time. And they're like, servicing now, please. I don't know your marks. I'd be too shy to say anything though. I don't know if that's the component, but like, you have no filter, by the way. I know I'm aware. I'm sorry. I apologize. How do we restock your eggs? No, you spawn in with them. You spawn in with all the eggs. You don't generate any new eggs at birth or anything like that, like after birth or anything. You spawn in like that for genetic material. It's actually really fascinating. I don't know. I don't know how you felt about the education stream yesterday. I had a blast, okay? I'm gonna be honest. I had a blast. Sorry, I like education. I think it's fun. And I didn't know if you guys knew I was gonna give you a little quiz at the end, but I was like giggling away, kicking my feet under the table when I was making my wee thing up for years. I was like, I'm gonna get him. This is how I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do that. Are you squeezing me right now? And I'll do that. I bet Stronny would love a refling growling in her, like a predator ready to turn her into prey. Little pup will learn her place under her alpha refling. What? The list, how wet is the fabric of your chair from this teasing? Stop! I'm in the supermarket! Les supermarch\u00e9s! Arr\u00eate! Arr\u00eate! J'attends la fucking supermarch\u00e9, man. Fucking hell, reflins. Why are we all, why are we so, what happened? What, is it filming? Why are we all so revved up? Give us a week. Give us a week. Give us a week, okay? A week and then it all starts up again, okay? Because we, something's going on with us right now. It is a film. It's a full moon, clearly, because what's going on? No, I'm just purchasing stuff. Please, give me a sec. I swear the game makes them teleport as soon as you look away for a millisecond. Out my way, ma'am. You're in my way. Right, coffee. Oh my god, that's so satisfying the way they stalk. Oh, I just walked into them. Okay, small age happy break. If us reflings were to work in your store, what type of uniform would we have? Just the hat or would we have a little shirt as well? Would you have a shirt? I don't think I'm a uniform. That's a good question. I need an easy access uniform. I said what I said. I don't care. I'm sorry. I said what I said. I need an easy access. That's it. That is how I will deal with the nine to five. Most people need alcohol at the end of the day to deal with their nine to five. Some people need smoke cigarettes for the nicotine hit. Some people, you know, recreational drugs to deal with the nine to five at the end of the day. I just need easy access. That's all I'm asking. Velcro? Velcro? That would be hilarious. I'm sorry. That's absolutely hilarious. Velcro all constantly like every 10 minutes, all you hear is and then in the break room, just every two seconds. That's honestly hilarious. I let you weren't you were not even approaching this till I swear you were not even approaching this. There's no way and it's getting No, stop. I'm just turning the lights on, please. Turn the lights on. Why is there so many customers? Apologies, Mamalaz-Riflin saw a cute supermarket worker working the cash register and we couldn't resist. See her blush. Stop. Okay, that was a compliment. So I'll take it. Why is there so many customers? What's going on? Don't you all have like wife and kids to go home to juice? What do you mean you're getting milk to go home? Thank you Anonymous for all the tips. You're all called anonymous, but I don't want to grip you together. I will thank you individually. Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. I'm under the counter. It's raining some strange liquid and I'm hearing some wild shite. You're not hearing anything. This place is empty. Needs more items. Three stars. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're getting up. There we're getting up. Wait, wait, that's a new, you're making new YouTube accounts because that's your first super chat registered on the account. There is no way you're going to all that effort. You're making new YouTube accounts to stream snipe in game. Thank you customer Gregson. Oh my God. That's amazing. Momo, thank you for the tip as well. There's strange liquid stuff. Oh my God. How are you going to such efforts? Right. I'm just going to completely sell out a product. I know I should probably order before. Order. Have you guys been on TikTok to that Scottish Chinese shop? I'm so sorry to completely derail with brain rot. So on TikTok, there's this Chinese Scottish shop and she like packs the orders, but she's got a funny accent. So she goes, come pack this customer's order with me. This family needs 100% discount and some special treatment. Yeah. Oh, thank you. This family needs 100% discount honestly though. Order. Yes, fucking sin sister knows what it is. It's Becca's takeaway. And she's like, come with me today to pack this customer's order, but it's like a vocal fry on order. So it's like order. Because it's not really that common to have a vocal fry in Scotland. It's rather, it's very Americanized if you will. Oh my God. Don't talk about America Challenge failed yet again. Honestly, I can't believe it. Right. What have we got? I definitely need in a much bigger fridge. I'm needing a bigger refrigerator. Right. We are going to preemptively pay all of our rent issues. I don't feel like I'm making any profit. Am I going crazy? But I feel like I'm like losing money somehow. Like I'm struggling to pay these bills. Me and Strone are going to do an really Scottish tourist stream and we're going to go to a mukbang at Becca's. But I'm packing this order for two v-chippers. Would you guys still love me if I had a vocal fry? Okay. Wait. How can I do a vocal fry on a Scottish accent? Order. Good afternoon, Henry Flings. I hope you're doing well. I could not maintain that. That's hideous. Right. Let's buy the big wall of ours. What have we got? $200? Oh, we're doing math with my order. Oh my God. That's awful. Please do not speak for the rest of the stream. I'm sorry. Thank you. Are you squiddin' me right now? Wow. At this point, forget the ASMR booth. Just open a store staffed by Reeflings. Okay. You can stay in the break room and be in charge of Team morale. We may be hard, but you can take it. No need to be a good girl. You can be our bad girl. Wait, but would that actually boost morale? Like, unironically, you know how like businesses are all like, I'm trying to boost the morale of the staff without increasing their wages or whatever. I'm like, I feel like that might work. You know, just me sitting in the staff room being like, how are the sales good? And then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. This is the most inappropriate conduct a store has ever. I think business would be booming though, you know? And like, as like, as a customer, you come in and then like, all you hear is like muffled like, like behind the door is like, is everything okay back there? It's just like, yeah, we're just expanding the shop. We're drilling. We need to drill holes in the walls. So that's what that noise is. Thank you, Zarian, for the tip. I think I've seen that video on a certain way. So, Chinese, Scottish, YUMMY. I miss a Chinese. Right. I'm going to buy all the products tomorrow and I'm going to go crazy and stack all the motherfucking jobs. Products found expensive, products not found. Right, relax. Right, we can't all fricking, right. I know the market price is changing. I'm sorry, but I ain't got time. Okay. Order. Oh, you can- I mean, you're not wrong. You're not, I didn't realize you can run in this game. Oh my gosh. How long have I been on this game for? And I didn't know you could fricking run. Look how fast I am. Are you serious? You can run in this game the whole time? I am so fast. I am so fast. Is this a joke? Oh, I can't sell the egg. Sorry. Right. I am so fricking fat. Oh my god. Wait, why did I buy so many fridge stuff? I don't have room in the fridge. Everyone watching the products expire. Oh my gosh. I didn't know you could move in this- Oh, open, open. I was wondering why the customers aren't coming. Wait, how do I clean the outside of the shop? It's dirty. Oh my god. This is not, this is not raising my beleveliness. Oh, whatever that word is in Japan, beleveniminess. Oh, if we're going to say belevenus, that's the word belevolne. What is that word? Your belevolence. Your belevolence? Benevolence. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Right. Change 30 bucks. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on the oil. Okay. I'll order oil, jeez. I'm trying. I'm trying. Okay. I have time. I have time because I can run. Bruh. Why did I not figure out you could run? Can you crouch? No, you can't crouch. Are you squiddin' me right now? Okay, you can't crouch. It's fine. It's fine. No, don't bug out. I feel out of place here as a sub. You're allowed to be a sub. I'm pretty, I'm pretty alright. I mean, if you've listened to the new Patreon audio, ain't no way you're a, you're a dumb in that audio. Look at the state of this place. Riefland should be picking up the boxes. I'm going back to Tescos, honestly. Benevolence. Benevolence. Okay, that sounds right. That sounds correct. I wish, I'm going to have to order, order freakin' tea so I can put these away again. I don't know. There seems to be something about the bottom, like, left or, I don't know. Sliced bread is too expensive. Okay, I agree with you. I'm sorry. I agree. I do agree. I agree. I agree. I'm sorry. Look, the prices change every day. Isn't it funny how the prices change every day, but they continue to go up and they never go down, even though there might be moments in time where things aren't as expensive as they should be. Isn't that curious? Curious, curious. Yeah, that's what I think about you. Right, bread. We need more bread. Bread, bread, bread, bread. Oh my God, fast. I'm fast as fuck, boy. Oh my God, sorry. This is so sad. It's fine to re-stock as well. I'm so fast. I'm so fast. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so fast. Sorry. This is the most efficient shop. Sorry. Sorry. I need to unlock that break room, like, right now because the reflins are waiting on my thoughts. Either the reflins are waiting on me or I'm waiting on them. You know how it is around these parts, baby. Oh, I need the coffee box and tea box. Are you squidding me right now? I need the tea. Give me the tea. No wonder Dad doesn't come here. There are no items. No, no, there is. There is. I'm waiting for people to freaking buy this. Are you squidding me right now? There's milk and water, but no one's buying. ASMR, Scottish Cuttlefish Attempts to Learn Her Second Language, English. Stop! It's true. It's actually true. No, it's true. It's true. Thank you, tiny Spanish. That's actually so true. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm working on it, daughter. I'm working. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I need to fix the glitch that's going on right now. I can't believe reflins are about to turn Strani into a free-use public owner. Hold. I don't think we can say that. Can we say that out loud? I don't know. Greg got a nuclear family. Literally, Greg is winning at life. Right, put all of this shit in the box. Stop. Whatever it, stop. Literally, stop. Whatever you guys are doing, knock it off. I'm getting fed up. I'm getting, I'm not putting anything bottom right because it seems to be some sort of weird glitch. $12. Thank you, ma'am. Are you squidding me right now? I apologize for my remarks. I was getting frustrated that none of... Bark, bark. Growl. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now that add-on is being the Doug Customer Greg's daughter's dog. Are we role-playing as a meta role-play as I'm getting advice to play this game? This is, this is getting insane. It's just getting insane. This is amazing. Oh my god, look at the money rolling in now. Oh, I need to hire, refland. I need to hire you so badly to get on the till. This is like, it's never ending. It's never ending. There's so many of you. What's going on? Why? Because I fixed the glitch, I think. Boom. Right, we've have $150. Can people start buying from the fridge? My products are going to go, they're going to spoil. I'm not even kidding. I need a new fridge. It's better to buy the 375. I don't have 375 though. Thank you, Anonymous. I can't believe reliefans are about to turn strong in there for you. Ah, no, I'm not reading that out loud. Stop it, Anon. Bad Anon. Spank. Tell me when Shibi goes live, by the way, just because she's doing ASMR today. And Shibi is so close to 10k and I'm so excited. I'm about to... I'm so excited for my genmei's success. Please give love and support to my genmeis. I'm so proud of them and they're so hardworking and I love them and I'm going to kiss them on the mouth. Anyway, that's just me. Shibi's live. Oh, I think her supermarket enterprises might be over with. I don't know. I'm going to record that. My dad guessed in each of her names shortly. Right, I'll play another day. I'm totally not addicted to this game, by the way. But yes, my dad is going home in like a week's time, so I'm going to be depressed. But the good news is there's going to be tons of streams. But deep down, I'm going to be sad inside. But you cheer me up. And I get to play loads of games with you again and I get to do all the ridiculous plans again. And I get to record all the ASMRs because I have tons of people waiting on me to do collab ASMRs. So there's going to be content out there. But the only exchanges that my dad has to go on. But that's okay because that's how life works sometimes. Okay, let's very quickly buy new stock. Can I very quickly do this? Stock, you, you just shove everything in. Literally shove everything in. Are you squiddin' me right now? Please. I think we're going to get in trouble. You guys are going to have to start substituting the way I do. You guys are going to have to start substituting because I'm getting, stop buying milk! Oh my gosh, stop buying milk. Stop buying refrigerated products. Please, I'm begging. Please, brain, stop messing up so badly. Right, you. Right, you guys are going to need to start substituting because I'm getting nervous for this board now. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous, but I'm glad you enjoyed the boot although. Because not everyone does it. Some people are like, oh my god, I hate it. I hate it. It's like, bruh, bruh! Let's just role play. Close your eyes. It's not real. Close your ears. Close your ears. You're subjecting yourself to something you don't like. Close your ears. Honestly, my dad literally listened to this conversation being like, what the fuck is going on in that room? What do you mean I have product? No! You're not supposed to do that. I'm glad you went flower all yours. And you gave me a perfect change. Thank you, sir. Have a good night. Have a good evening. I appreciate you. Can I please? Why are people not buying? I mean. Strongly, I will gift so many memberships if one day you can do an alternative outfit of you as a puppy girl. I'm begging you. I don't, I mean, so my donathon is coming up. I've said like, my donathons more like group activity stuff or like free access stuff. I've got about free use on my mind now. Like, accessible stuff. You don't have to pay to access it. If you guys wanted to like, I'm not going to stop you from like picking out because Azura is going to pick out what she wants to do for her donathon. I assume she's going to do the same thing she needs next after. Strongly cut us oiled up in 4K is currently the search suggestion. Thank you so much for letting me yank your boy chair. Wait, what? Did I not yank your boy chair like two minutes ago? We are good fish, believe us, maybe. We are good fish. We're the goodest fish in all the land. We just mind yourself swimming and stuff. Yeah, if you guys want to, as if I'm going to say no to a fucking alt puppy outfit, if you guys want to, you know, you know, hit me up, dab me up. Are you joking? I'll be a puppy VTuber. Are you joking? Like, literally, I will get the custom collar and it literally says property of reefling and then I'll get a toggle and everything and please don't think I'm not going to do that because I'm a laundry serious. Right. Okay, let's do this and then pop that down and then let's sell these eggs because they are literally rotting. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, eggs are only one. Free you zone a hole? No, she's still in charge, but I'm about to make her into a Twinkie. Reeflings, right, we're about to get in trouble. We're about, we're unironically about to get in trouble. Stop it. I'm going to have to spank you, okay? You've been naughty right now. Oh, hold on, hold on, right, put the cheese in, right, the cheese has probably expired like half a century ago, but hey ho, and that's not going to stop us. Came back just in time for the pet play, rip Vod. Honestly, I'm starting to get, I'm getting nervous for the Vod. If we can all take a deep breath and get ready to be redirected into Sheebie's lovely. Four dollars for eggs? Sheesh, don't mind if I do. I mean, honestly, this isn't that badly stopped in all consideration. Right, we'll play one more day and then we're redirected into Sheebie. No, I'm not addicted. Are you squidding me right now? Hey, are you guys hiring? I have no experience. Unemployed Greg's grandson. Look, you have to start somewhere with experience. Don't you love it when places require you to have experience, but they won't hire people who've never had experience before? Isn't that a fascinating point of them being in a part of this society? Hmm, isn't that curious that they make it really impossible for you to even get an entry level job without having a freaking PhD in fucking Yunnan? Honestly, it's getting outrageous. Don't you just love that part of society in the community at large? Don't you just fucking love it? Literally, don't you love it? This is getting a bit too real, honestly. Are you squidding me right now? Might be the cutest Twinkie I've ever seen. You think I'm a cute Twinkie? Thank you as a Rijie for letting me pop your cherry again. I don't know why YouTube said let me do it twice, but it did. Anonymous. Bit of strong eats. Oh, not whole. Oh my god. I think I missed that. Oh, I didn't realize you called yourself that. Thank you, Momo. Thank you, Zion. Thank you, unemployed Greg's grandson and Momo again. Literally five years experience for an entry level job, like fucking calm down. Honestly, I could absolutely kick. I was going to say the C word, but you're not allowed to say the C word. Graduate with a bachelor's degree, and I can't even get an entry level retail job. Honestly, ma'am, why are you giving me that much change? Don't do that again. That made myself clear. Don't do that again. Four bucks change. Let me think. All yours. I'll always just go for the dollar bill. Searching for 10 years experience in a 25-year-old is a while. Are you squidding me right now? It is. That didn't answer my question. Yes, I will hire if you don't have experience because I'll teach you everything I can teach you. Okay, now that's a tall order. Thank you for your custom search. This is our biggest order. $29 reduced. Thank you. Thank you for your custom. That's our biggest sale yet. I can't believe it. I can't believe having an array of products leads to people purchasing it multiple versions of it. Shocking behavior. Honestly, shocking. Absolutely shocking. Good girl, strongy. I knew you could be a good if you tried. Keep this up and I will give you a treat later. Okay, that's acceptable because that's implications, but it's not going to get as bad. Yes, I will hire, I will teach you everything I know, and then you can be, and I'll vouch for your CV. I saw, oh my god, I should get a throwaway number that you guys can use for a CV, and then they'll phone up and they'll be like, hey, Anon says that you worked, they worked for you for like a year. Can you tell us about their experience and all that, and I'll just like straight up like guess you up. I'll be like, yeah, he was absolutely fantastic. I cannot recommend the employee. I was really sad to see him go, but unfortunately, because I, you know, I had a few complications with my health, I could no longer employ him, but Anon's perfect 10 out of 10. I so want to do that. That'd be the funniest thing ever. Like I'll give you an email. I wonder why Grandpa hates this place. No, Grandpa likes it. Look, I've got tons of products. Like come on. So I actually, this, I'm doing really well, so I'm actually doing so well. So I don't believe you. I don't believe you first, I think. I definitely need like a double fridge though. This is getting like outrageously. Oh, I'm about to be able to afford a double fridge. Don't mind if I do. Any references? Yeah, I'm the reference. She's such a sweetheart. I'll get you guys on a job somewhere. I know exactly what they want to hear because, you know, if you didn't know. Well, now you know, hydration check, refling. I'm waiting for my application to be approved. I need to be level 10 before I can hire a refling, unfortunately, Greg. Grigory. I wish I wasn't so scared. I would love to play Fanaf, but I get very scared. I literally have a heart attack at the concept of the game. So we shan't be playing Fanaf. But we can definitely watch the Fanaf movie. Hear me out. Fanaf movie and a karaoke thing. Watch along. And we'll watch. I'll tell you what, I'll get Emmy to play Fanaf, right? And then I'll watch her play it. And then we'll do the Fanaf movie and then we'll do Fanaf karaoke. How about that? So I don't have to play it. I don't have to be. It's just we shit in my panty loons. You know what I'm saying? Change 44. Oh my God, I'm so smart. What? Oh, wow. Sorry. Business is actually booming. What do you mean a fully stocked shop equals business booming? Because I can, I literally am so busy now. Oh, are you squidding me right now? Are we flings? No, you spelled it wrong! My flings, I missed hearing that. Violetton, Violetton, the other spelling. We're under the water, Violetton. Violetton, the other spelling, the other spelling, the other spelling. Honestly, it's genuinely not a big deal. I literally paid for your concept and created you type thing. Nothing was a sign. So literally saw his butt. But we spell it ee, r-e-e-fling. Thank you so much, Violetton, for the 20. And it's nice to see you again. Nice to see you. Nice. Any old refling, any new refling. Don't worry, you're all equally getting shagged. Shut the fuck up! Sorry, I'm hyper. I'm really enjoying this game right now. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm enjoying this game thoroughly. It's the game. It's, it's the game. Okay, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Right, we're gonna order, I dare, the double fridge, and then we're gonna order some product. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Right, hold on, how do I do that? Are you squidding me right now? You are? Yeah. Reflings are down bad. Uh-huh. Sorry, Strani, we've been very bad boys. You have, yeah. Whatever could we do to make up for it, underscore sweat, and then you just said that. Like, like chat reflects the streamer, okay, and streamer reflects the chat. So maybe, sorry, and thank you. I am so sorry. That was wildly inappropriate. Me, when the stream gets taken down, like, ah, okay. Are you squidding me right now? Truly, wholeheartedly. I'm sorry too. Sorry that we aren't in the straight line right now. Like, it's locked. I don't know how to get into it. I think if we expand the store and off and let me do that, I'm gonna very quickly buy some more products. I like to sing, I like to dance, but I can't do it with a pew pew in my pants. Got focused. Look, I'm working out, look, the reason why stock is low, you're gonna shit your pantyloons when you realize stock is low because you guys are buying all the stock and I am a one-man army, please. Lose, just buy the tea. Okay, he's actually buying like tons of tea though. Thank you. Eggs and tea, that's what I like to sing. I'm down for apocalyptic. What? I'm down apocalyptic for strong. What? Apocalyptic? What? Apocalyptic. Oh, apocalyptic is a word. Yes, it is a word, actually. Now that you mentioned it, apocalyptic is a word. Okay, I'm done. I'm not speaking for the rest of the stream. Whoa, I can't even speak English. Right, water. Pop it there. Eggies. Pop it there. Okay. Whoa, I thought we were finished with customers. Jump scare, honestly, geez. Down the apoliptical, honestly, isn't that a machine in a gym? The apoliptic is? I cannot freaking speak right now. I'm starting and stammering. Someone clipped when I was very kindly gifted like 10 memberships and I was like, I was just an absolute shambles. It was a shambles. Right, let's clean this up. We've got a few, just a few deliveries, just a few deliveries. Right, we'll clean all this up, we'll do one more date and then I'm redirecting into Sheebie and there's nothing you can do about it. You're getting loved on by the bun. She got buns of steel, okay? You're getting loved on by the bunny. She's an ASMR. Please subscribe. She's almost hit 10,000 subscribers, which is freaking awesome. As I said, the girls are like, they're just so fantastic and they're so excited to reach these milestones because it's like, that's right, Strani give up on speaking English and just bark for us. Stop! Make sure you get a good reward. It's so anonymous. Stop. I have another week to wait. I have a whole week. I can't do anything for a week. Knock it off. I'll start barking orders at you. Thank you for the tip though. And Momo, thank you for the tip with the pew pew. Any purers? Any self-identified purers? I pee. I pee my pants. Sorry. I don't know why I always make that joke. I don't know. I find it funny. Yes, also Sheebie's dream. Well, Sheebie said she wanted a play button. So I told all the girls I will do everything I possibly can to achieve a play button for you goofy gibbers. So if you didn't know, I have fantastic news. If you're a clipper, Veilure is coming out with a clipping program very soon TM. And the current, now you do have to apply and be accepted for it. You can't just automatically get it overnight. But, but for every 1000 views you get, we have, we are going to trial $2 per every 1000 views you get in the clipper program because we want to say a special thank you for taking the time to go through VODs and edits. So we're going to offer $2 per 1000 views and the ceiling price is 100k. So for one clip you could in theory get $200. However, it does have to have an expiry date because we can't like pay you out like three years after, you know, the clips are, you know, the girls are, you know, um, but if the clip gets over 100k views, but it reaches like a next milestone, you also get like a bonus on top, but it's not 2000 per views. Like cause I didn't, I didn't want to insult why am I standing here? Bro, it's the end of the day. Right. One more day. Well, just give me one more day. Just give me one more day. What do I need?

He was like laughing at that and he was like reading all your chat and he was like, your chat, my chat. Sorry, I'm trying to do it from his perspective. He was reading it and he was like, whoa, they're really interactive. And I'm like, yeah, like that's like the fun of streaming is like you get to talk live.

And then I'm not going to play this offline but please don't be surprised if I go nuts for another version of this, like another stream of this game. I'm sorry but this gameplay, money go up and then I can unlock a refling and I can like sexually harass you at the till and stuff. Like come on, come on. That's right, grab that war. Buy my products. You love the store. You love the store. Get off the stage. 100 bucks. Oh come on, be realistic. Be realistic. You're lucky I can do math. Oh I'm level 10. I can hire a refling but I'm not going to have enough money to do it. But we'll do it again, okay? I can afford, you can afford a cashier. Well I need to buy the thing as well. I actually, you need to buy the cashier and you need to, what do I need to, I don't know, I don't know. Oh my god, I'm getting stressed again. There's too many customers. Why do you all come at once? I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous. Why do you all come at once? She says, she said, aha that's what she said. No seriously, why do you all pile up? By the last moment please. I'm getting stressed. Thank you for your custom but I'm getting stressed. Right there's one more, one more customer and I think we're done. What is it? Oh no it's 8 p.m. There's a whole flock of new customers about to come in. Mummy likes tycoon games. Look, I do. You know what game I really enjoy? And literally no one's played it. On the Nintendo DS there's this game called Zoo Tycoon and you can like make all the animals happy in it and I adore that game. It's like such a simplistic one. I don't know if I can make a stream out of it though. I think it's a bit too boring but I love it. Folk leave in their offices there's a lot of them. It's trying to get more vague Rievelin.
